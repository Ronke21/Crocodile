<text>The term Pool of Siloam (, ) refers to several rock-cut pools located southeast of the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem. The pools were fed by the waters of the Gihon Spring, carried there by the Siloam tunnel.

The Lower Pool or &quot;Old Pool&quot; (, according to Isaiah 22:11) was historically known in Palestinian Arabic as Birket el-ḥamra &quot;the Red Pool.&quot;

==History==

During the Second Temple period, the Pool of Siloam was centrally located in the Jerusalem suburb of Acra (), also known as the Lower City.
Today, the Pool of Siloam is the lowest place in altitude within the historical city of Jerusalem, with an elevation of about above sea level. The ascent from it unto the Temple Mount meant a gradient of in altitude at a linear distance of about , with a mean elevation in the Temple Mount of above sea level. According to the Jerusalem Talmud, Hagigah, the Pool of Siloam was the starting point for pilgrims who made the annual pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and where they ascended by foot to the inner court of the Temple Mount to bring an offertory to the Temple Court. The Pool of Siloam (perhaps referring to the Lower Pool) was used by pilgrims for ritual purification before visiting the Temple enclosure.

===Hezekiah===
The Pool of Siloam was built during the reign of Hezekiah (715–687/6 BCE) to leave besieging armies without access to the spring&#x27;s waters. The newly constructed Siloam tunnel fed the pool. An older Canaanite tunnel had been vulnerable to attackers, so, under threat from the Assyrian king Sennacherib, Hezekiah sealed the old outlet of the Gihon Spring and built the new underground Siloam tunnel in place of the older tunnel (Books of Chronicles, ).

During this period the Pool of Siloam was sometimes known as the Lower Pool according to Isaiah 22:9, as opposed to the more ancient Upper Pool mentioned in 2 Kings 18:17 and Isaiah 7:3 formerly fed by the older Canaanite tunnel.

===Second Temple period===
The pool was reconstructed no earlier than the reign of Alexander Jannaeus (103–76 BCE), although it is not clear whether this pool was in the same location as the earlier pool built by Hezekiah – if so, all traces of the earlier construction have been destroyed. The pool remained in use during the time of Jesus. According to the John 9, Jesus sent a man blind from birth to the pool to complete his healing. As a freshwater reservoir, the pool would have been a major gathering place for ancient Jews making religious pilgrimages to the city. Some scholars, influenced by Jesus commanding the blind man to wash in the pool, suggest that it was probably used as a mikvah (ritual bath). 

The pool was destroyed and covered after the First Jewish–Roman War in 70 CE. Dating was indicated by several coins discovered on the stones of the patio near the pool to the north from the days of the War. The latest coin is dated &quot;4 years to the day of the Great Revolt, &quot; meaning 69 CE. In the years following the destruction, winter rains washed alluvia from the hills to the valley and down the slopes of Mount Zion to the west of the pool; the pool was filled with silt layers (up to 4m in some places) until it was covered completely.

===Late Roman and Byzantine periods===

Roman sources mention a &quot;Shrine of the Four Nymphs&quot; (&quot;Tetranymphon&quot;), a nymphaeum built by Hadrian during the construction of Aelia Capitolina in the year 135 and mentioned in Byzantine works such as the 7th-century &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot;; other nymphaea built by Hadrian, such as that at Sagalassos, are very similar. It is unlikely that this shrine was built on the site of the Second Temple Pool of Siloam, but it may have been a precursor to the Byzantine reconstruction.

In the 5th century, a pool was constructed at the end of the Siloam tunnel at the behest of Aelia Eudocia, empress consort of the Byzantine Empire. This pool survives today, surrounded by a high stone wall with an arched entrance to Hezekiah&#x27;s Tunnel. The pool is around from the Second Temple period Lower Pool and is significantly smaller. Until the discovery of the Second Temple pool, this pool was wrongly thought to be the one described in the New Testament and Second Temple sources.

==Discovery in the 21st century==
The pool was rediscovered during an excavation work for a sewer in the autumn of 2004, by Ir David Foundation workers, following a request and directions given by archaeologists Eli Shukron accompanied by Ori Orbach from the Israel Nature and Parks Authority. Archaeologists Eli Shukron and Ronny Reich (working with the Israel Antiquities Authority) uncovered stone steps, and it became obvious that these steps were likely to have been part of the Second Temple period pool. Excavations commenced and confirmed the initial supposition; the find was formally announced on August 9, 2005, and received substantial international media attention.

The excavations also revealed that the pool was wide, and that steps existed on at least three sides of the pool. Close to two decades after the initial discovery a portion of this pool remained unexcavated, as the land above was owned by a nearby Greek Orthodox church and was occupied by an orchard known as the King&#x27;s Garden (compare ). During 2023 the unexcavated portion was revealed through excavations directed by Nahshon Szanton of the Israel Antiquities Authority.

The pool is not perfectly rectangular, but a soft trapezoid. There are three sets of five steps, two leading to a platform, before the bottom is reached, and it has been suggested that the steps were designed to accommodate various water levels. The pool is stone-lined, but underneath, there is evidence of an earlier version that was merely plastered (to help it retain water). Coins from the reign of Alexander Jannaeus were found embedded in the plaster lining of the pool, and therefore provide a secure earliest date for the pool&#x27;s (re-)construction.

===Earlier excavations===
Archaeologists excavating the site around the Pool of Siloam in the 1880s have noted that there was a stairway of 34 rock-hewn steps to the west of the Pool of Siloam leading up from a court in front of the Pool of Siloam. The breadth of the steps varies from at the top to at the bottom.

The remnants of an ancient wall dating to the Bronze Age were unearthed near the older Pool of Siloam, known also as the &quot;Lower Pool,&quot; and locally as &quot;Birket al-Ḥamrah&quot;, during the excavations conducted by F. J. Bliss and A. C. Dickie (1894–1897). At the &quot;Lower Pool&quot; of Siloam there was a weir (levee), used to raise the level of water upstream or to regulate its flow. Conrad Schick&#x27;s research in connection with a partially rock-hewn aqueduct related to the water system of Siloam has led researchers to conclude that the Lower Pool, &quot;Birket al-Ḥamrah&quot;, received water directly from the &quot;Fountain of the Virgin&quot; (Gihon Spring) at some period and which Schick places prior to the completion of the Siloam Tunnel.

<text>Ralph Cook Craig (June 21, 1889 – July 21, 1972) was an American track and field athlete. He was the winner of the sprint double at the 1912 Summer Olympics.

Craig began his track career as a hurdler at Detroit Central High School and only later developed into a sprinter at the University of Michigan. In 1910, he won the IC4A 220 y championship, repeating this the following year.

In 1912, Craig qualified for the Olympic team and went to Sweden, where he reached the final of the 100m. A big favorite was his compatriot Donald Lippincott, who had set a world record of 10.6 in the heats. After no less than seven false starts, Craig won the race in 10.8 – Lippincott only finished third. Craig fought another battle with Lippincott in the 200m, edging him to win the 200 m title. Craig was not a part of the American 4 × 100 m relay team, which was disqualified.

Immediately after the Olympics, Craig retired from the sport. His younger brother, James B. Craig, also ran track at Michigan and starred for the Michigan Wolverines football team, earning a consensus selection to the 1913 College Football All-America Team.

In 1948, Craig returned to the Olympics as an alternate on the US yachting team. Although he did not compete, Craig (59) carried the American flag at the opening ceremonies in London.

Craig was employed for many years as an administrator with the New York State Unemployment Bureau. He died at Lake George, New York.

In 2010, he was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.

==Competitions==
*In March 1911, Craig set a new record by running the 40-yard high hurdles in 5.2 seconds, breaking the prior record held by Forrest Smithson.
*In May 1911, at his last competition wearing the Michigan uniform, Craig helped the Wolverines to a third-place finish in the inter-collegiate meet. He tied the inter-collegiate record in the 100-yard dash with a time of 9.8 seconds. He also tied the world record in the 220-yard dash with a time of 21.2 seconds. The Wolverines finished the meet with 24 points, trailing only Cornell (30 points) and Yale (24-1/2 points).

<doc id="69577" wikidata="Q181261" url="?curid=69577" title="Charles Albert of Sardinia">
<text>Charles Albert (; 2 October 1798 – 28 July 1849) was the King of Sardinia and ruler of the Savoyard state from 27 April 1831 until his abdication in 1849. His name is bound up with the first Italian constitution, the &quot;Statuto Albertino&quot;, and with the First Italian War of Independence (1848–1849).

During the Napoleonic period, Charles Albert resided in France, where he received a liberal education. As Prince of Carignano in 1821, he granted and then withdrew his support for a rebellion which sought to force Victor Emmanuel I to institute a constitutional monarchy. He became a conservative and participated in the legitimist expedition against the Spanish liberals in 1823 known as the &quot;Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis&quot;.

Charles Albert became king of Sardinia in 1831 on the death of his distant cousin Charles Felix, who had no heir. As king, after an initial conservative period during which he supported various European legitimist movements, he adopted the neo-Guelph idea of a federal Italy, led by the Pope and freed from the House of Habsburg in 1848. In the same year, he granted the Albertine Statute, the first Italian constitution, which remained in force until 1947.

Charles Albert led his forces against the Imperial Austrian army in the First Italian War of Independence but was abandoned by Pope Pius IX and Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, and was defeated in 1849 at the Battle of Novara, after which he abdicated in favour of his son, Victor Emmanuel II. Charles Albert died in exile a few months later in the Portuguese city of Porto.

The attempt to free northern Italy from Austria represents the first attempt of the House of Savoy to alter the equilibrium established in the Italian peninsula after the Congress of Vienna. These efforts were continued successfully by his son Victor Emmanuel II, who became the first king of a unified Italy in 1861. Charles Albert received several nicknames including &quot;the Italian Hamlet&quot; (given to him by Giosuè Carducci on account of his gloomy, hesitant, and enigmatic character), as well as &quot;the Hesitant King&quot; (&quot;Re Tentenna&quot;) because he hesitated for a long time between the establishment of a constitutional monarchy and the reinforcement of absolute rule.

==Early life and studies==
Charles Albert was born at the Palazzo Carignano in Turin on 2 October 1798 to Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Carignano, and Maria Cristina of Saxony. His father was the great-great-great-grandson of Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano, youngest legitimate son of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, and founder of the Carignano line of the House of Savoy. Since he did not belong to the main line of the House of Savoy his chances at birth of succeeding to the kingdom were slim. Although the reigning king, Charles Emmanuel IV, had no children, at his death the throne would pass to his brother Victor Emmanuel and then to the latter&#x27;s son Charles Emmanuel. After that, in the line of succession there were two further brothers of Charles Emmanuel IV: Maurizio Giuseppe and Charles Felix. In 1799, two of these heirs died: the young Charles Emmanuel (aged only three years) and Maurizio Giuseppe (from malaria in Sardinia).

===Napoleonic period===
Charles Albert&#x27;s father, Charles Emmanuel of Carignano, had studied in France and had been an officer in the French army. Sympathetic to liberalism, he travelled to Turin in 1796, in the wake of the French invasion of 1796 and King Charles Emmanuel IV&#x27;s flight into exile. There Charles Emmanuel of Carignano and his wife joined the French cause. Despite this, the pair were sent to Paris, where they were placed under surveillance and forced to live in poor conditions in a house in the suburbs. These were the circumstances in which their children, Charles Albert and his sister Maria Elisabeth (born 13 April 1800), grew up.

On 16 August 1800, Charles Emmanuel of Carignano died suddenly. It was up to Charles Albert&#x27;s mother to deal with the French, who had no intention of recognizing her rights, titles or property. She nonetheless refused to send her son to the Savoy family in Sardinia for a conservative education. In 1808, Maria Christina married for a second time, to Giuseppe Massimiliano Thibaut di Montléart, whose relationship with Charles Albert was poor.

When he was twelve years old, Charles Albert and his mother were finally granted an audience with Napoleon, who granted the boy the title of count and an annual pension. Since it was no longer appropriate for him to be educated at home, Charles Albert was sent to the Collège Stanislas in Paris in 1812. He remained at the school for two years, but did not attend regularly; instead, he attended only to sit exams, apparently with success. In the meantime, Albertina had moved to Geneva, where Charles Albert joined her from March 1812 to December 1813, and she was married to the Protestant Pastor, Jean-Pierre Etienne Vaucher (1763–1841), a follower of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813, the family left Geneva, fearing the arrival of Austrian forces and returned to France. At the beginning of 1814, Charles Albert enrolled in the military school in Bourges, hoping to become an officer in the French army. He was sixteen years old. Napoleon named him a lieutenant of dragoons in 1814.

== First period in Turin (1814–1821) ==

After Napoleon was defeated for good, the new king Louis XVIII celebrated the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty in Paris on 16 May 1814. Among those present at the festivities were Princess Maria Christina di Carignano and her children Charles Albert and Elisabetta. Despite their past, the family was treated well, although Charles Albert had to renounce the title of Count of the Empire, which had been conferred upon him at the military school in Bourges and the annuity which Napoleon had granted him.

The re-establishment of peace in Europe meant that Charles Albert could return to Turin, and he was advised to do so by his tutor, count Alessandro Di Saluzzo di Menusiglio, and by Albertina. He left Paris (and his step-father) and arrived in Turin on 24 May. There he was welcomed affectionately by King Victor Emmanuel I (Charles Emmanuel IV had abdicated in 1802) and his wife Queen Maria Theresa, by birth a Habsburg archduchess. His property and lands were restored to him and he was granted the Palazzo Carignano as a residence. Given the dynastic situation (neither Victor Emmanuel nor his brother Charles Felix had male children) Charles Albert was now the heir presumptive.

Thus he was assigned a mentor to counter the liberal ideas that he had learned in France. The first of these was Count Filippo Grimaldi del Poggetto, and after he had failed, the dragoon, Policarpo Cacherano d&#x27;Osasco. Although he was better equipped for the task, he was not able to influence the mindset of Charles Albert, who began to suffer from anxiety at this time.

=== Marriage and personality ===

The court decided that marriage would provide the prince with internal equilibrium. The chosen bride, accepted by Charles Albert, was the sixteen-year-old daughter of Ferdinand III of Tuscany, Archduchess Maria Theresa, a relative of Queen Maria Theresa. Charles Albert travelled to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and then to Rome on 18 March 1817 and, after a 6-month engagement, married Maria Theresa on 30 September in Florence Cathedral. The wedding was followed by a ball organized by the Sardinian embassy in Florence. After that, on 6 October, the couple departed for Piedmont. On 11 October, they reached Castello del Valentino and from there they made their formal entrance into Turin.

The young Maria Theresa was very shy and religious, quite different from Charles Albert&#x27;s temperament. The couple resided in the Palazzo Carignano, to which Charles Albert began to invite young intellectuals with whom he shared liberal ideas. The most intimate of these friends were Santorre di Rossi de Pomarolo, Roberto d&#x27;Azeglio, Giacinto Collegno, Cesare Balbo, Guglielmo Moffa di Lisio Gribaldi and Carlo Emanuele Asinari di San Marzano.

In these years, Charles Albert also suffered from a deep religious crisis. This led to a friendship with the French diplomat Jean Louis de Douhet d&#x27;Auzers and a visit by the prince to Rome in 1817 to visit the former king Charles Emmanuel IV, who had retired to a monastery. In the years following his marriage, however, Charles Albert had extramarital affairs with several women, including Marie Caroline de Bourbon, widow of the Duke of Berry. Maria Theresa had two miscarriages – the second in 1819 as a result of a carriage accident – but gave birth to a son on 14 March 1820, Victor Emmanuel, the future King of Italy.

=== Participation in the Revolution of 1821 ===

After the 1820 uprising in Cadiz, King Ferdinand VII of Spain was forced to grant the Spanish Constitution of 1812. The hope of obtaining similar constitutions arose in many European states. Insurrections broke out in Naples and Palermo. On 6 March 1821, Santorre di Rossi de Pomarolo, Giacinto Provana di Collegno, Carlo di San Marzano and Guglielmo Moffa di Lisio (all military officers, officials, or sons of ministers) and Roberto d&#x27;Azeglio met with Charles Albert. The young liberals were ready to act and had identified the prince as a new type of man for the House of Savoy — one ready to break with the absolutist past.

The conspirators had no desire to abolish the House of Savoy, but claimed, on the contrary, that they hoped to force it to grant reforms which would grant it the gratitude of the people. During the months of preparation, Charles Albert had assured them of his support and on 6 March he confirmed this, declaring that he supported armed action. They were to raise troops, surround King Victor Emmanuel I&#x27;s residence at Moncalieri and demand that he grant a constitution and declare war on Austria. Charles Albert was to play the role of mediator between the conspirators and the king.

On the morning of the next day, 7 March, Charles Albert had second thoughts and informed the conspirators of this. Indeed, he summoned the Minister of War, Alessandro Di Saluzzo di Menusiglio and told him that he had discovered a revolutionary plot. There was an attempt to halt the conspiracy, which nevertheless continued to grow bolder on the next day, with another visit by di Rossi and di Marzano. Yet, they grew uncertain and gave orders to cancel the insurrection, which was due to break out on 10 March. The same day, Charles Albert, full of regret, raced to Moncalieri, where he revealed everything to Victor Emmanuel I and begged for a pardon. The situation had reached a tipping point. In the night, the garrison of Alessandria, commanded by one of the conspirators (Guglielmo Ansaldi), rose up and took control of the city. At this point, the revolutionaries decided to act, despite the abandonment of the prince.

=== Regency and Spanish Constitution ===
On 11 March 1821, Victor Emmanuel I called a meeting of the council of the Crown, in which Charles Albert also participated. Along with the majority of those who were present, Charles Albert declared his willingness to grant the constitution. Rumours spread however that armed intervention to restore order in Italy by a joint Austrian and Russian force were imminent. The king decided to wait, therefore, but the next day, the Citadel of Turin fell into the hands of the rebels. Victor Emmanuel I then asked Charles Albert and Cesare Balbo to negotiate with the Carbonari, but the latter refused any contact with the two. That evening, as the armed uprising spread, the king abdicated in favour of his brother Charles Felix. Since the latter was in Modena at the time, Charles Albert was appointed regent.

Only 23 years of age, Charles Albert found himself in charge of resolving a serious political crisis which he himself had been responsible for provoking. The old ministers abandoned him and he was forced to nominate a new government: the lawyer Ferdinando dal Pozzo as Minister of the Interior, the general as Minister of War, and as Minister of Foreign Affairs. He tried to negotiate with the rebels, with no results. Terrified, he claimed that it was impossible to make any decisions without the agreement of the new king and therefore sent Charles Felix a letter with an account of the events that had taken place and a request for instructions. But he was also afraid that he would become the object of popular anger if he continued to delay and so, on 13 March 1821, Charles Albert published a proclamation conceding the Spanish Constitution, with the reservation that this grant was pending the approval of the king.

On 14 March, the regent decided to form a Junta which would be able to act as guardians of the parliament. The head was Canon Pier Bernardo Marentini, a Jansenist, who was Vicar-General of the Archdiocese of Turin and had been chosen as Bishop of Piacenza in 1813 but denied the role by the Pope. Charles Albert replaced the minister of war he had appointed the previous day with Santorre di Rossi, the leader of the armed uprising. On 15 March, in the presence of the Junta, Charles Albert swore to observe the Spanish Constitution, which had been amended with a few clauses requested by Victor Emmanuel I&#x27;s queen, Maria Theresa.

Meanwhile, the representatives of liberals of Lombardy had arrived: Giorgio Pallavicino Trivulzio, , and . They asked Charles Albert to declare war on Austria in order to free Milan, but the prince refused. Instead, he accepted the advice of Cesare Balbo, who reported the discipline of the armed forces, stopped excesses and firmly established the troops loyal to the king. Charles Felix himself, however, had responded very badly to the news of his brother&#x27;s abdication, which he considered an &quot;abominable act of violence&quot; and, from Modena, he sent an order to Charles Albert, ordering him to come to Novara, and declaring any actions taken in the name of the king after the abdication of his brother, including the concession of the Spanish Constitution, to be null and void.

==Reactionary period (1821–1831)==

At midnight on 21 March 1821, Charles Albert secretly departed from the Palazzo Carignano. His departure was not discovered by the revolutionaries until the next day. From Rondissone, on 23 March he made for San Germano, from which he intended to travel to Novara, which remained loyal to the king. At Novara he remained for six days before a dispatch arrived from Charles Felix on the 29th, ordering him to depart immediately for Tuscany.

=== Florence ===
On the afternoon of 2 April 1821, the prince arrived in Florence. His wife and son, who had been in France, followed on the 13th. The Prince&#x27;s father-in-law, Grand Duke Ferdinand III granted them the Palazzo Pitti as a residence. In May, Charles Felix, who had successfully secured Austrian assistance to restore order, met with Victor Emmanuel I at Lucca. The two discussed Charles Albert&#x27;s conduct for a long time and, although the new queen Maria Christina spoke in his defence, they decided that he was responsible for the conspiracy.

As a result of this decision and the circumstances, Charles Albert decided to disavow his liberal ideas, especially as Charles Felix had entertained the idea of eliminating him from the line of succession and passing the crown straight to his son Victor Emmanuel. Charles Felix asked the opinion of Metternich on this, who was unexpectedly opposed to the idea.

On 16 September 1822, the infant Victor Emmanuel barely escaped from a fire in his cot, exposing the tenuous nature of the line of succession, which was taken out of danger by the birth of a second son, Ferdinand, on 15 November. In Florence, Charles Albert cultivated various cultural interests. He became a collector of old books, but was also interested in contemporary authors, acquiring the poetry of Alphonse de Lamartine and the conservative Joseph de Maistre.

=== Spanish Expedition ===

At the beginning of 1823, Duke Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême assumed command of the French expeditionary force which the European powers had entrusted with the task of suppressing the liberal revolution in Spain and restoring King Ferdinand VII to the Spanish throne after he had been captured by Spanish revolutionaries in Cadiz. Charles Albert wished to demonstrate his penitence and therefore asked to be part of the contingent. He wrote to Charles Felix on this subject for the first time on 20 February 1823, but only received permission to depart on 26 April.

On 2 May, Charles Albert embarked on the Sardinian frigate &quot;Commercio&quot; at Livorno, which arrived in Marseille on 7 May. The next day, Charles Albert set out, arriving in Boceguillas on the 18th. By the time he arrived there, he had been assigned to the division of the French General Étienne de Bordesoulle. on the 24th, he arrived at Madrid, where he remained until 2 June, and then he set out for the south. At a clash with the enemy during the crossing of the Sierra Morena, he demonstrated courage and the French made him a member of the Legion of Honour. He proceeded to Córdoba, Utrera, Jerez de los Caballeros and El Puerto de Santa María, where he waited for the order to attack the fortress of Cadiz, the Trocadero, which was the last remaining refuge of the Spanish constitutional government.

At the end of August 1823, with the French fleet aiding from the sea, the troops launched an assault on the Trocadero. Charles Albert fought at the head of the troops crossing the canal—the sole point of entry to the fortress. He plunged into the water holding the flag of the 6th regiment of the royal guards, forded the canal and leapt into the enemy trenches. He sought to prevent the enemy prisoners from being killed, and the French soldiers gave him the epaulettes of an officer killed in the assault, so that he might be distinguished from a regular grenadier.

Charles Albert remained at his post until nightfall, and the next day he was among the first to break into Trocadero. King Ferdinand VII and queen Maria Josepha, his cousin, were freed and embraced him in joy at seeing him. On 2 September there was a grand military parade, after which the Duc d&#x27;Angoulême decorated Charles Albert with the Cross of the Order of Saint Louis.

=== Visit to Paris and return to Turin ===
With the dissolution of the expeditionary force, Charles Albert travelled from Seville to Paris, arriving on 3 December 1823. In the French capital, he participated in balls, receptions, and parties, and developed a close relationship with Marie Caroline, widow of the Duc de Berry. On 15 December, King Louis XVIII held a grand reception for the victors of Trocadero, at which Charles Albert was among the guests of honour.

King Charles Felix of Sardinia decided that, as a result of his success, it was time for Charles Albert to return to Turin. The prince was required to swear &quot;to respect and religiously maintain all the fundamental laws of the monarchy when I ascend to power, which have led to fortune and glory over the centuries.&quot; On 29 January 1824, Charles Albert received permission to depart for Turin. At a final meeting with Louis XVIII, he received some advice on rulership and was enrolled in the Order of the Holy Spirit, the most prestigious chivalrous order of the French monarchy.

On 2 February, Charles Albert departed and on the 6th he reached Mont Cenis, where he received orders to enter Turin by night, in order to avoid protests. Charles Albert did so, probably on the 23rd. Once he had returned to Turin, Charles Albert resided mainly at Racconigi Castle, where he began preparations for reigning. He began to study a subject which received little attention at court – the economy – and in 1829 he received permission to visit Sardinia. As a result of this visit, he gained an accurate understanding of the conditions on the island. He was a prolific writer. In 1827, along with his wife, he wrote 38 fairy tales for their children in French, the language which the family used at home, entitled &quot;Contes moraux&quot; (&quot;Moral Tales&quot;). The next year, he tried his hand at comedy and after that, he occupied himself with literary criticism and history. He would publish three works: &quot;Notes on the Waldensians&quot;, &quot;Records of Andalusia&quot; and &quot;Voyage to Sardinia&quot;. Charles Albert regretted all of these and subsequently ordered them to be withdrawn from circulation. He also wrote a great volume of letters and literary exercises.

Despite the conservative attitudes of the period, Charles Albert supported literati who held liberal ideas, such as Carlo Giuseppe Guglielmo Botta, whose books were banned in Piedmont. He owned the works of Adam Smith and the &quot;Collection of Classic Italian Writers on Political Economy&quot;, edited by , a supporter of Napoleon.

=== Accession to the throne ===

In 1830, Charles Felix became very ill. He summoned Charles Albert to his sick bed on 24 April 1831. The entire government was present in the room as the king said to the ministers, &quot;Behold my heir and successor, I am sure that he will act for the good of his subjects&quot;.

Charles Felix died on 27 April at 2:45 pm. Charles Albert closed the corpse&#x27;s eyes, kissed its hand and then assumed the throne. He received the dignitaries of court and brought his sons into the Royal Palace. At 5:00 pm, the troops rendered their oaths to the new king at the direction of Governor , who published the proclamation relating to this. Thus the throne passed to the House of Carignano and the direct line of Savoy came to an end.

==Pro-Austrian period (1831–1845)==
Thus Charles Albert came to the throne aged 33. His health was poor; he had liver disease. His faith added to his suffering; he wore a cilice and slept alone on an iron bed, waking at 5:00 am every morning and celebrating two masses per day. He worked from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm every day without interruption. He ate little and suffered from frequent religious crises, but never renounced extramarital affairs even so. The most significant of these was his relationship with Maria Antonietta di Robilant (1804–1882), daughter of Friedrich Truchsess zu Waldburg (1776–1844), the Prussian ambassador to Turin and wife of Maurizio di Robilant (1798–1862).

=== Conflict with Louis Philippe&#x27;s France ===
The new king was affected by the July Revolution, which had deposed Charles X of France and led to the accession of Louis Philippe, an ex-revolutionary, and as a result, he decided to make an alliance with the Austrian Empire. The treaty, signed on 23 July 1831 and ratified in 1836, entrusted the defence of the Kingdom of Sardinia to Austria. However, in the event of war, the commander of the joint forces was to be Charles Albert. He wrote to the Austrian ambassador, Ludwig Senfft von Pilsach (1774–1853), &quot;... the most beautiful day of my life will be the day on which there is war with France and I have the good fortune to serve in the Austrian army.&quot;

In accordance with this legitimist position, Charles Albert lent support to his close friend Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, duchesse de Berry in December 1823 when she sought to place her son, Henri, on the French throne. She was the widow of the Duc de Berry, second son of Charles X, whose eldest son, Louis Antoine had renounced the throne. Henri&#x27;s claim to the throne had been denied by the king.

Despite the advice of the French ambassador to exercise prudence, in 1832, Charles Albert loaned Marie-Caroline a million francs and placed a steamer at her disposal for transporting legitimist volunteers to France. The plot was discovered and failed; the steamer was stopped at Marseille and the volunteers were defeated at Vendée in a few hours. Marie-Caroline fled, but was soon arrested in Nantes and imprisoned in the Citadel of Blaye, near Bordeaux.

=== Philosophy of rule ===
Charles Albert displayed similar conservativism in internal politics. When the minister of war, Matteo Agnès Des Geneys (1763–1831) died, he replaced him with Carlo San Martino d&#x27;Aglie, who was not very popular at the time. He retained as Minister of Foreign Affairs until 1835, when he replaced him with the extremely conservative Clemente Solaro. These appointments were made with the intent of restoring a ministerial oligarchy. In 1831 he appointed Gaudenzio Maria Caccia, Count of Romentino (1765–1834) as minister of Finance, as Minister of Justice, and the reformer, Antonio Tonduti, Count of Escarèna (1771–1856), as minister of the Interior. On 5 April 1832, d&#x27;Aglie was replaced as Minister of War by .

In June 1831, Giuseppe Mazzini, who was in exile in Marseille, addressed a letter to Charles Albert as &quot;an Italian,&quot; in which he encouraged him to focus on the unification of Italy, in vain. For the moment, the new King of Sardinia cleaved to almost the same ideas as his predecessors.

=== Reforms and cultural initiatives ===
Notwithstanding this conservatism, Charles Albert established a Council of State of 14 members who were to investigate the laws and make some moves to modernize the country. He abrogated the special exemptions on import duty for members of the royal family and royal officials, abolished torture, prohibited the mutilation of the corpses of executed criminals and the confiscation of the property of criminals. He also gave notable attention to culture. In 1832, he established the &quot;Pinacoteca Regia e della Galleria Reale&quot; in the Palazzo Madama (now the Turin City Museum of Ancient Art) and the library of the Palazzo Reale, he built several monuments and palaces, refounded the Academy of Art as the Accademia Albertina in 1833 and established the &quot;Royal Foundation for the Study of the History of the Fatherland&quot;, which would become the model for all the similar foundations for historical studies established in the nineteenth century, in the same year.

Charles Albert accompanied these measures with an economic policy of liberalization of commerce. In 1834, the tax on grain was reduced and the next year, the export of raw silk was made legal. Duties on the import of raw materials (coal, metals, textiles) were subsequently reduced and the acquisition of industrial machinery from abroad was supported. Despite having impinged on some minor sources of state income, the balance of the kingdom was positive from 1835, and it was possible to entertain ambitions for the improvement of agriculture, roads, railroads, and ports.

Charles Albert also reformed the army, reformed the law codes, instituted a Court of cassation, and eliminated feudalism in Sardinia, in 1838. He enabled the opening of institutes of credit, reformed the public agencies and the state, and reduced the control of the religious hierarchy somewhat. The royal court was full of clerics—at least fifty of them—and the court was sumptuous for such a small kingdom. There were a great number of cooks, butlers, waiters, carpenters, squires, stallers, pages, footmen, masters of ceremonies, etc.

=== Support for Spanish and Portuguese reactionaries ===
After the death of king Ferdinand VII of Spain, the nation was divided into two factions: the anti-liberal reactionaries who supported the legitimist aspirations of Don Carlos and the constitutionalists who defended Maria Christina&#x27;s regency on behalf of Isabella II. The Holy Alliance of Russia, Austria, and Prussia supported Don Carlos; Great Britain, France and Portugal supported the constitutionalists. Charles Albert sides with the former group, but in the Carlist War of 1833–1840, the constitutionalists prevailed. Similarly, in the Portuguese Liberal Wars (1828–1834), which followed the death of John VI, Charles Albert sided with the absolutists under Dom Miguel, who spent time in Piedmont. In this case, too, the liberals, led by Dom Miguel&#x27;s brother Dom Pedro, enjoyed the support of Great Britain and Louis-Philippe&#x27;s France and were ultimately successful.

=== Opposition to &quot;Young Italy&quot; ===

At the time of Charles Albert&#x27;s ascent to the throne in 1831, there were riots in Rome, the carbonari revolt of Ciro Menotti in Modena, and an insurrection in Bologna and Parma which led to the flight of Francis IV and Marie Louise. Austria was able to restore order and Charles Albert decided that his alliance with the Habsburgs was essential. The Kingdom of Sardinia was also troubled by the plots of revolutionaries in these years, and even by an attempted invasion. In April 1833, in Genoa, two low-ranking officers were arrested for a scuffle and it was discovered that they belonged to Giuseppe Mazzini&#x27;s Young Italy. They supplied various names and investigations were expanded to other garrisons. Charles Albert, who considered Mazzini&#x27;s association the &quot;most terrible and bloody&quot;, ordered the investigation to continue until it got to the bottom of the matter, acting in accordance with the law but with the utmost severity.

In the end, twelve people were executed by firing squad, and two committed suicide in jail. Twenty-one were condemned to death but could not be executed because they had escaped or, like Mazzini, had been abroad the whole time. Charles Albert granted no pardons, and the ambassadors of France and Britain in Turin protested at court about the severity of the punishment and the lack of any mercy. The King of Sardinia showed his gratitude to the investigators by granting honours to those who had played a leading role in the repression.

Since the insurrections had failed, Mazzini began to plan a military expedition. In 1834, he attempted to organize a force in Switzerland, which would attack Savoy (then part of the Savoyard state) and the population would simultaneously rise against the king. But information about this plan was leaked and Charles Albert arranged an ambush. The invasion, undertaken on 2 February 1834, failed completely. This was partly due to disorganization, and partially to Swiss efforts to prevent Mazzini&#x27;s expedition. Only a few conspirators attacked a barracks in Les Échelles. Two of them were captured and executed by firing squad. Carabiniere was killed in the process, and to honour him Charles Albert instituted the first gold medal in Italian history. Meanwhile, Giuseppe Garibaldi, who was preparing to lead a rising in the city, received a report that it was all over and fled. He was condemned to death &quot;in absentia&quot;.

=== Law reform ===
In these circumstances, Charles Albert realized the necessity of granting reforms to make the kingdom more modern and to satisfy the needs of the populace. Immediately on ascending to the throne he had named a commission which had been tasked with creating new civil, criminal, commercial and procedural laws. This process of reform took a very long time, but eventually, on 20 June 1837, the new civil code, partially inspired by the Napoleonic Code, was promulgated. The king also participated in the drafting of the new criminal code, which was published on 26 October 1839. During the process, Charles Albert insisted on the concept of corrective justice, limiting the death penalty as much as possible. Nevertheless, he ordained very severe penalties for those guilty of sacrilege or suicide (whose last wills and testaments had no legal power). In 1842, finally, the commercial code and the code of criminal procedure, with innovative guarantees of the rights of the accused, were promulgated.

=== Beginning of crisis with Austria ===
In 1840 the Oriental Crisis, which placed Louis Philippe&#x27;s France in conflict with the other European great powers, inspired Charles Albert to begin thinking about a program of territorial expansion in the Po valley. In the same year, a commercial crisis erupted between Turin and Vienna, regarding an old treaty in which the Kingdom of Sardinia undertook not to provide salt to Switzerland. Following the breach of this treaty, Austria increased the customs duty on Piedmontese wine entering Lombardy-Veneto by 100%. Charles Albert&#x27;s response was to threaten to build a railroad from Genoa to Lake Maggiore, in order to capture the German commerce which sustained the Austrian port of Trieste for the Ligurian ports.

These were still only minor disputes and diplomatic relations between the two states continued to be generally good, culminating in the magnificent wedding of Charles Albert&#x27;s eldest son, Victor Emmanuel and Adelaide of Austria, daughter of Ranier Joseph of Habsburg-Lorraine, who was the Austrian Viceroy in Lombardy-Veneto and Charles Albert&#x27;s brother-in-law, since he had married his sister Elisabeth in 1820. Victor Emmanuel and Adelaide were thus first cousins.

== Liberal sovereign (1845–1849) ==
In 1845, revolutionary movements erupted in Rimini and in the Papal States. To Massimo d&#x27;Azeglio, who had gone to report on the events, Charles Albert said, &quot;that on the day of conflict with Austria, he would throw himself in with his sons, with his army, with all his substance, to fight for the independence of Italy.&quot;

On 8 June 1846, on the orders of Chancellor Metternich, the Austrian ambassador to Turin, Karl Ferdinand von Buol, asked Charles Albert to clarify his position on whether he was with Austria or with the revolutionaries. The King of Sardinia hesitated. In the meanwhile, on 16 June, Pope Pius IX had been elected as Pope. His first order of business was to grant an amnesty to those condemned of political crimes. The new pope then protested against Austria for having occupied Ferrara, in the Holy See, without its consent. Charles Albert, who saw in Pius IX a way of reconciling his loyalty with his old liberal ideas, wrote to him offering his support.

In the same way, in September 1847, , Charles Albert&#x27;s secretary, was authorized to write a letter on 2 September, in which the king expressed his hope that God would grant him the power to undertake a war of independence in which he would take command of the army and the Guelph cause. These declarations made Charles Albert far more popular. However, he continued to break up anti-Austrian demonstrations because the court and government remained divided. De La Tour, Foreign Minister Solaro della Margarita, and Archbishop considered the anti-Austrian policy exceptionally dangerous, but it was supported by Minister of War , Cesare Alfieri di Sostegno, Cesare Balbo, Massimo and Roberto d&#x27;Azeglio, and the young Count Cavour.

Meanwhile, the demands of the people became pressing and were not always accepted. In this period, for example, Charles Albert did not accept a Genoese delegation which called for the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Kingdom, whom he had already banned from political writings. He did, however, implement the so-called Perfect Fusion of the Savoyard state on 29 November 1847, which extended the reforms carried out on the mainland to the island of Sardinia. At the beginning of 1848, news arrived that following the outbreak of the Spring of Nations, Ferdinand II had granted a constitution in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. In Turin there were acclamations for the King of Naples and the Pope, while Charles Albert remained bound by the oath he had sworn to Charles Felix to respect religiously all the fundamental laws of the monarchy, and to retain absolutist rule.

=== Albertine Statute ===


On 7 January 1848, at the hotel &quot;Europa&quot; in Turin, there was a meeting of the city&#x27;s journalists at which Cavour, director of the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;, proposed to request a constitution from the king. The majority of the ministers were also in favour of the concession of a constitution, and of ensuring that one was not imposed by the people. Charles Albert was not sure what to do, unwilling to make the wrong decision and considered abdicating as Victor Emmanuel I had in similar circumstances. He sent for his son to prepare him for the succession, but his son managed to convince him to retain his position.

On 7 February, an extraordinary Council of State was convented. Seven ministers, the holders of the order of the Annunciation, and other high dignitaries were present. All of them spoke and the discussion went on for many hours. Charles Albert, pale, listened in silence. De La Tour, , and were opposed to the constitution. During the lunch break, Charles Albert received a delegation from the capital, which asked for the constitution for the good of the people and in order to safeguard order.

It was now necessary to make a decision and, at last, Giacinto Borelli, Minister of the Interior, was appointed to draft the Constitution immediately. The document was approved and was named the &quot;Statute.&quot; Charles Albert had stated that he would not approve the document if it did not clearly state the pre-eminent position of the Catholic religion and the honour of the monarchy. Since he had received these things, he approved it. The meeting was dissolved at dawn.

Around 3:30 in the afternoon on 8 February, a royal edict was published in the streets of Turin, which laid out the 14 articles which formed the basis of the Statute for a system of representative government. By 6:00 pm, the city was entirely lit up and massive demonstrations in favour of Charles Albert were held.

The edict specified that the Catholic faith was the sole state religion, and that executive power belonged to the king, as did command of the armed forces. Legislative power was vested in two chambers, one of which would be elected. The free press and individual liberty were guaranteed. The full version of the Statute, with all its articles, was finally agreed on 4 March 1848 and approved the same day by Charles Albert. The announcement of the Statute was met with great enthusiasm throughout Piedmont. The first constitutional government, presided over by Cesare Balbo, was sworn in on 16 March 1848, two days before the beginning of the Five Days of Milan.

=== Spring of Nations ===

Elected in 1846, the new pope Pius IX had caught the imagination of the liberals of Italy when he began to dismantle the archaic Vatican institutions: granting a free press, instituting the civic guard in place of foreign mercenaries, and creating a council of ministers. On 12 January 1848, there was a revolt in Palermo and King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies was forced to concede a constitution, but all of Europe was further convulsed when, in February 1848, there was a Revolution in France, King Louis Philippe was deposed, and a Republic was established. The revolution spread to Milan on 18 March, then to Venice, and finally to Vienna, where riots forced Metternich to flee and the abdication of Emperor Ferdinand I.

In Milan, it was expected that Charles Albert would take the opportunity to declare war on Austria. A clear message from Turin was delivered by the Milanese liberal, on 19/20 March:
Although the Kingdom&#x27;s resources were small, the Piedmontese army began to mobilize. The majority of the troops were deployed on the western border since the eastern border was safeguarded by the treaty of alliance with Austria. But Charles Albert realised that this was a unique opportunity to expand his holdings into Lombardy. Thus he told the Milanese that he would intervene on their behalf if they agreed to join the Kingdom of Sardinia.

On 23 March 1848, the Piedmontese embassy to Milan returned to Turin with news that the Austrians had been forced to evacuate the city and that a provisional government headed by Gabrio Casati had been established, which asked Charles Albert to become an ally. Clearly not very enthusiastic about the idea of annexation, the Milanese asked the king to keep his troops outside the city and to adopt the tricolour of the Cisalpine Republic as his flag. Although he had received no guarantee that the Milanese would agree to annexation, Charles Albert accepted the conditions of the Milanese and asked only that the flag of the house of Savoy be placed in the middle of the tricolour (This would henceforth be the flag of the Kingdom of Sardinia and then the Kingdom of Italy until the fall of the monarchy in 1946). He was about to enter into a war with a major power, whose troops in Italy were commanded by one of the greatest living generals, Joseph Radetzky von Radetz. His reactionary past forgotten, the king appeared on the balcony of the royal palace, flanked by the Milanese representatives, waving the tricolour, while the people applauded and shouted, &quot;Long live Italy! Long live Charles Albert. Within a year his reign would be over.

=== First Italian War of Independence ===

On 23 March 1848, the proclamation of Charles Albert to the people of Lombardy and Veneto was published, in which he assured them that the Piedmontese troops, &quot;... go now to offer, in the final trials, that help which a brother expects from a brother, a friend from a friend. We will comply with your just requests, trusting in the aid of God, who is clearly with us, of God, who has given Italy Pius IX, of God, whose miraculous prompting places Italy in the position to act for itself.&quot; Thus, the war began. The federalist Carlo Cattaneo was not impressed, &quot;Now that the enemy is in flight, the king wants to come with the whole army. He should have sent us anything − even a single cart of powder − three days ago. There was heard, in Piedmont, for five days, the thundering of the guns which consumed us: The king knew and did not move.&quot;

==== Initial campaign ====

Charles Albert left Turin on the evening of 26 March 1848 for Alessandria, to take command of the army and then advanced to Voghera. He was preoccupied with the delay of the provisional government of Milan&#x27;s acceptance of annexation by the Kingdom of Sardinia. The Austrians however had regrouped on the River Mincio, at one corner of the Quadrilatero. On 29 March, the king entered Pavia in triumph, where he was met by some envoys of the Milanese government. On 2 April, Charles Albert was in Cremona, on 5 April at Bozzolo, on 6 April at Asola, on 8 April at Castiglione delle Stiviere, and on 11 April at Volta Mantovana, only four kilometres from the Mincio. After nearly two weeks, he had made it to the front.

At the opening of hostilities, on 8 and 9 April, Italian sharpshooters had achieved success in the first battle of the campaign at the Battle of Goito. After crossing the Mincio with his army, Charles Albert achieved another victory on 30 April at Pastrengo, where he saw the front lines. The units under his command attacked some Austrians who had been dispersed by a charge of the carabinieri on horseback. On 2 May, in the midst of this triumphant atmosphere, news arrived that Pius IX had withdrawn his military and political support for the Italian cause.

Nevertheless, the Papal soldiers in the army did not withdraw, choosing to remain to fight as volunteers, but Charles Albert had lost the moral justification for his mission. His dream of becoming the sword of the papacy and king of an Italy united under the Pope, as Vincenzo Gioberti had proposed, was thwarted. Yet the king was undiscouraged and continued to advance towards Verona, where a harsh and indecisive battle was fought with the Austrians at Santa Lucia on 6 May.

Two further events followed in the next few days. On 21 May, the contingent of 14,000 men from the Neapolitan army which were &quot;en route&quot; to fight against the Austrians, were ordered by Ferdinand II to return home in light of Pius IX&#x27;s decision. Then on 25 May, the Austrian reinforcements which had been traveling through Veneto, joined Radetzky&#x27;s troops at Verona. Charles Albert was ambitious but had only modest strategic abilities and he could not realistically continue the war alone. The Battle of Goito and the surrender of Peschiera on 30 May were his last successes. The Austrians conquered Vicenza on 10 June, dispersing the Papal volunteers and finally obtained a decisive victory over the Piedmontese in the Battle of Custoza, which lasted from the 22 to 27 July.

In the meantime, on 8 June, the Milanese and Lombards had voted with an overwhelming majority to join the Kingdom of Sardinia, as had the citizens of the Duchy of Parma on 2 May. But for Charles Albert, things were going sour: the soldiers were angry about the recent defeat and were hungry and exhausted. A council of war suggested seeking a truce.

==== Events in Milan and armistice of Salasco ====
On the evening of 27 July 1848, the Austrians agreed to grant a truce if the Piedmontese withdrew to the west bank of the Adda (a little more than 20 km east of Milan), surrendered all the fortresses, including Peschiera and yielded the Duchies of Parma and Modena, whose rulers had been forced into exile. Charles Albert, who disagreed with his son Victor Emmanuel on the conduct of the war, exclaimed &quot;I would rather die!&quot; and prepared to make a stand at the Oglio (about 25 km further east than requested by Radetzky).

Although the Austrian proposal had been rejected, his troops ended up having to withdraw to the Adda river anyway, because the Oglio river was held to be an inadequate defensive line. At the river Adda, some manoeuvres taken by a general on his own initiative left a division isolated and made it necessary to withdraw again, in order to retreat inside the walls of Milan. Charles Albert went to the , ignoring the Milanese desire to resist, he negotiated the surrender of the city to the Austrians in exchange for permitting the safe withdrawal of the army to Piedmont.

The next day, the Milanese learned of the agreement and revealed their fury. The crowd protested in front of the Palazzo Greppi and when the King came out on the balcony, they fired their rifles at him. According to the noblewoman Cristina Trivulzio di Belgiojoso, who participated actively in the riots in Milan:
 Charles Albert&#x27;s second son Ferdinand and general Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora carried the king to safety. In the night he departed from Milan with the army. On 8 August, general returned to Milan and negotiated an armistice with the Austrians, known as the Armistice of Salasco, which was signed on 9 August. Charles Albert ratified the armistice despite some opposition, including from Gioberti, who remained confident of aid from France. The king said that the former French foreign minister, Alphonse de Lamartine, had declared that the French would only give such aid to Republicans.

==== Second campaign and abdication ====

The king was not proud of the campaign and, once he had written a record of the first campaign, Charles Albert decided to break the armistice. On 1 March, at the inauguration of the legislature, he spoke clearly about war and Chamber responded positively. For the imminent resumption of hostilities, the king was convinced to renounce effective command of the army, which he continued to hold formally. Rather than appointing a Piedmontese general, he selected the Polish general Wojciech Chrzanowski as commander of the army. On 8 March, the council of war in Turin decided that the armistice would be broken on the 12th. According to the terms of the armistice, hostilities would then begin eight days later on 20 March.

The war did indeed resume on that day. On 22 March, Charles Albert arrived at Novara and a day later, Radetzy attacked the city from the south with superior numbers, near the village of Bicocca. Chrzanowski made some significant tactical errors and despite the bravery of the Piedmontese and Charles Albert himself, who fought along with his son Ferdinand in the front lines, the Battle of Novara proved a disastrous defeat.

Returning to the Palazzo Bellini in Novara, the king declared, &quot;Bicocca was lost and retaken three or four times, before our troops were forced to yield... the Major General [Chrzanowski] employed all his strength, my sons did everything they could, the Duke of Genoa [Ferdinand] lost two horses from under himself. Now we have withdrawn within the city, on its walls, with the enemy below, with an exhausted army – further resistance is impossible. It is necessary to request an armistice.&quot;

Austria&#x27;s conditions were very harsh: occupation of the Lomellina and the fortress of Alessandria, as well as the surrender of all the Lombards who had fought against Austria. Charles Albert asked the generals if it was possible for a final push to open a path to Alessandria. They said it was not: the army was in pieces, discipline had crumbled, many soldiers fighting in the campaign were despoiling the houses in the countryside and they feared an attack on the king himself.

At 9:30 pm on the same day, Charles Albert summoned his sons, Chrzanowski, generals Alessandro Ferrero La Marmora, , Giovanni Durando, (who had negotiated the armistice) and minister Carlo Cadorna. He confessed that he had no choice but to abdicate. They tried to dissuade him, but, in the hope that Victor Emmanuel could get better terms, he ended the discussion, &quot;My decision is the fruit of mature reflection. From this moment, I am no longer the king; the king is Victor, my son.&quot;

== Exile (1849) ==

Charles Albert&#x27;s eldest son became king of Sardinia as Victor Emmanuel II and agreed to an armistice with Radetzky on 24 March 1849 at Vignale, effectively obtaining more favourable terms than previously offered. The Austrians were to occupy Lomellina for a while and only half of the fort of Alessandria, with &quot;permission&quot; rather than &quot;by right&quot;.

=== Voyage to Portugal ===
Charles Albert, however, had left Palazzo Bellini in Novara a few minutes after midnight on 23 March. His carriage travelled to Orfengo (on the road halfway between Novara and Vercelli), probably without any specific destination in mind, but after a little while he was stopped at an Austrian roadblock. Charles Albert identified himself as the Count of Barge (a title which he actually possessed) and a colonel of the Piedmontese army. General Georg Thurn Valsassina (1788–1866) interrogated him and it is not clear whether he recognized him or not. Having been confirmed as the Count of Barge by a captured sharpshooter (when asked &quot;can you confirm that this is the Count of Barge?&quot; the soldier responded, &quot;He is the Count of Barge.&quot;), Charles Albert was allowed to pass and continued his journey to the southwest.

The former king continued via Moncalvo, Nizza Monferrato, Acqui, Savona, Ventimiglia and Monaco, which he reached on 26 March. At Nice in France, he dispatched instructions to organize his family affairs, without adding any information for his wife. On 1 April, he was at Bayonne, near the Atlantic coast, and on 3 April he received a message from Turin in order to get him to legally confirm his abdication.

Charles Albert continued through Torquemada, Valladolid, León, and A Coruña, which he reached on 10 April, and which was the end of the carriage road. On horseback, suffering from illness, he reached Lugo on 15 April and entered Portuguese territory at Caminha. From there he went to Viana do Castelo, Póvoa de Varzim and, finally, on 19 April, at noon, he arrived in Oporto. From there he may have planned to travel to America, but he was forced to stop because he had become ill with a liver complaint.

=== Final days in Porto ===
Once his arrival in Porto became known, Charles Albert was hosted at the &quot;Hotel do Peixe&quot;, where he remained for two weeks, as his condition worsened. Then he accepted a new residence from a private individual on the &quot;rua de Entre Quintas&quot;, with a view of the ocean. On 3 May, he hosted Giacinto Provana di Collegno and Luigi Cibrario, who brought him greetings from the Piedmontese government. To them, he said: 
During this time, Charles Albert suffered from progressive decay, coughing and abscesses. He had two heart attacks, but the doctors considered the condition of his liver the most serious issue, for which the former king abstained from eating very much and fasted on Wednesdays. He read the letters and newspapers which arrived from Italy. He wrote occasionally to his wife, but regularly and with feeling to the Countess of Robilant. He forbade his mother, wife, and children from visiting.

In the month after his arrival, his health had deteriorated irreparably. From 3 July, he was assisted by the doctor Alessandro Riberi, whom Victor Emmanuel had sent from Turin. He was no longer able to get out of bed and coughing fits were ever more frequent. He passed the night of 27 July in great difficulty. On the morning of 28 July, he seemed better, but then deteriorated as a result of a third heart attack. The Portuguese priest don Antonio Peixoto, who had assisted him spiritually, met with him and administered extreme unction. Charles Albert whispered in Latin, &quot;In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum&quot; (Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit). He fell asleep with the crucifix on his chest and died at 3:30 in the afternoon, a little over 51 years old.

His body was embalmed and displayed in the Cathedral of Porto. On 3 September, the ships, &quot;Mozambano&quot; and &quot;Goito&quot; arrived under the command of his cousin Eugene Emmanuel. On 19 September the corpse was brought on board the &quot;Monzambano&quot;, which departed for Genoa that evening. It arrived on 4 October. The funeral took place in Turin Cathedral on 13 October, with Alexis Billiet, Archbishop of Chambéry, presiding along with five Piedmontese bishops, and was well-attended by the people. The day after, the body was solemnly interred in the crypt of the Basilica of Superga, where it still lies.

<text>Fulla (Old Norse: , possibly &#x27;bountiful&#x27;) or Volla (Old High German, &#x27;plenitude&#x27;) is a goddess in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. Fulla is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry. Volla (&quot;Folla&quot;) is attested in the &quot;Horse Cure&quot; Merseburg Incantation, recorded anonymously in the 10th century in Old High German, in which she assists in healing the wounded foal of Phol and is referred to as Frigg&#x27;s sister. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.

== Name ==
The Old Norse name &quot;Fulla&quot; has been translated as &#x27;bountiful&#x27;. It stems from Proto-Germanic &quot;*fullōn&quot; (&#x27;fullness, plenitude&#x27;; cf. Gothic &quot;fullo&quot; &#x27;fullness&#x27;, OHG &quot;folla&quot; &#x27;plenitude&#x27;), itself a derivative of the adjective &quot;*fullaz&quot; (&#x27;full&#x27;; cf. ON &quot;fullr&quot;, Goth. &quot;fulls&quot;, OHG &quot;foll&quot;, all meaning &#x27;full&#x27;). The latter derives from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;plh₁-nó-&quot; (&#x27;filled, full&#x27;; cf. Skt &quot;pūrṇá&quot; &#x27;full&#x27;, Lith. &quot;pìlnas&quot;, OCS &quot;plьnь&quot; &#x27;filled, full&#x27;), a past participle of the verbal root &quot;*pelh₁-&quot; (&#x27;to fill&#x27;).

==Attestations==
===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
In the prose introduction to the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, Frigg makes a wager with her husband—the god Odin—over the hospitality of their human patrons. Frigg sends her servant maid Fulla to warn the king Geirröd—Frigg&#x27;s patron—that a magician (actually Odin in disguise) will visit him. Fulla meets with Geirröd, gives the warning, and advises to him a means of detecting the magician:


===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
In chapter 35 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur. High lists Fulla fifth, stating that, like the goddess Gefjun, Fulla is a virgin, wears her hair flowing freely with a gold band around her head. High describes that Fulla carries Frigg&#x27;s &quot;eski&quot;, looks after Frigg&#x27;s footwear, and that in Fulla Frigg confides secrets.

In chapter 49 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High details that, after the death of the deity couple Baldr and Nanna, the god Hermóðr wagers for their return in the underworld location of Hel. Hel, ruler of the location of the same name, tells Hermóðr a way to resurrect Baldr, but will not allow Baldr and Nanna to leave until the deed is accomplished. Hel does, however, allow Baldr and Nanna to send gifts to the living; Baldr sends Odin the ring Draupnir, and Nanna sends Frigg a robe of linen, and &quot;other gifts.&quot; Of these &quot;other gifts&quot; sent, the only specific item that High mentions is a finger-ring for Fulla.

The first chapter of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Fulla is listed among eight ásynjur who attend an evening drinking banquet held for Ægir. In chapter 19 of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, poetic ways to refer to Frigg are given, one of which is by referring to her as &quot;queen [...] of Fulla.&quot; In chapter 32, poetic expressions for gold are given, one of which includes &quot;Fulla&#x27;s snood.&quot; In chapter 36, a work by the skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir is cited that references Fulla&#x27;s golden headgear (&quot;the falling sun [gold] of the plain [forehead] of Fulla&#x27;s eyelashes shone on [...]&quot;). Fulla receives a final mention in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; in chapter 75, where Fulla appears within a list of 27 ásynjur names.

===&quot;Horse Cure&quot; Merseburg Incantation===

One of the two Merseburg Charms (the &quot;horse cure&quot;), recorded in Old High German, mentions a deity named Volla. The incantation describes how Phol and Wodan rode to a wood, and there Balder&#x27;s foal sprained its foot. Sinthgunt sang charms, her sister Sunna sang charms, Friia sang charms, her sister Volla sang charms, and finally Wodan sang charms, followed by a verse describing the healing of the foal&#x27;s bone. The charm reads:

:Phol and Wodan went to the forest.
:Then Balder&#x27;s horse sprained its foot.
:Then Sinthgunt sang charms, and Sunna her sister;
:Then Friia sang charms, and Volla her sister;
:Then Wodan sang charms, as he well could:
:be it bone-sprain, be it blood-sprain, be it limb-sprain:
:bone to bone, blood to blood,
:limb to limb, so be they glued together.
==Theories==

Andy Orchard comments that the seeming appearance of Baldr with Volla in the Merseburg Incantation is &quot;intriguing&quot; since Fulla is one of the three goddesses (the other two being Baldr&#x27;s mother Frigg and his wife Nanna) the deceased Baldr expressly sends gifts to from Hel. John Lindow says that since the name &quot;Fulla&quot; seems to have something to do with fullness, it may also point to an association with fertility.

Rudolf Simek comments that while Snorri notes that Baldr sends Fulla a golden ring from Hel in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, &quot;this does not prove that she plays any role in the Baldr myth, but merely shows that Snorri associated her with gold&quot; because of kennings used associating Fulla with gold. Simek says that since Fulla appears in the poetry of Skalds as early as the 10th century that she was likely &quot;not a late personification of plenty&quot; but that she is very likely identical with Volla from the Merseburg Incantation. Simek adds that it is unclear as to who Fulla actually is, and argues that she may be an independent deity or simply identical with the goddess Freyja or with Frigg.

John Knight Bostock says that theories have been proposed that the Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. As a result, this notion has resulted in theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of the goddesses Sinthgunt and Sunna, in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.

Hilda Ellis Davidson states that the goddesses Gefjun, Gerðr, Fulla, and Skaði &quot;may represent important goddesses of early times in the North, but little was remembered about them by the time Snorri was collecting his material.&quot; On the other hand, Davidson notes that it is also possible that these goddesses are viewable as aspects of a single Great Goddess. Davidson calls Fulla and Volla &quot;vague, uncertain figures, emerging from odd references to goddesses which Snorri has noted in the poets, but they suggest the possibility that at one time three generations were represented among the goddesses of fertility and harvest in Scandinavia.&quot;

<text>Tatra is a Czech vehicle manufacturer from Kopřivnice. It is owned by the TATRA TRUCKS a.s. company, and it is the third oldest company in the world producing motor vehicles with an unbroken history. The company was founded in 1850 as &quot;Ignatz Schustala &amp; Cie&quot;. In 1890 the company became a joint-stock company and was renamed the &quot;Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau-Fabriksgesellschaft&quot;. In 1897, the &quot;Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau-Fabriksgesellschaft&quot; produced the Präsident, which was the first factory-produced automobile with a petrol engine to be made in Central and Eastern Europe. The First Truck was made a year later, in 1898. In 1918, the company was renamed &quot;Kopřivnická vozovka a.s.&quot;, and in 1919 it changed from the Nesselsdorfer marque to the &quot;Tatra&quot; badge, named after the nearby Tatra Mountains on the Czechoslovak-Polish border (now on the Polish-Slovak border).

In the interwar period, Tatra came to international prominence with its line of affordable cars based on backbone tube chassis and air-cooled engines, starting with Tatra 11 (1923). The company also became the pioneer of automotive aerodynamics, starting with Tatra 77 (1934). Following the 1938 German-Czechoslovak war and Munich Agreement, the town of Kopřivnice was occupied by Nazi Germany and Tatra&#x27;s production was directed towards military production. Trucks like Tatra 111 (1942) became instrumental both for the German Nazi war effort as well as post-war reconstruction in Central Europe and Soviet Union.

Today, Tatra&#x27;s production focuses on heavy, off-road trucks based on its century-long development of backbone chassis, swinging half-axles, and air-cooled engines. The core of its production consists of the Tatra 817, intended primarily for military operators, and the Tatra Phoenix (Tatra chassis with DAF cabin and Paccar water-cooled engine), aimed primarily for the civilian market. In 2023, the company plans to produce over 2,000 trucks.

==Early years==


In 1850, Ignaz Schustala founded &quot;Ignatz Schustala &amp; Cie&quot; in Kopřivnice, and the company entered the business of manufacturing horse-drawn vehicles.

In the 1880s, the company began manufacturing railroad cars.

In 1890, the company became a joint-stock company, and was renamed the &quot;Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau-Fabriksgesellschaft&quot;. Also that year, Hugo Fischer von Röslerstamm became the company&#x27;s technical director. After Schustala&#x27;s death in 1891, von Röslerstamm took over the management of the business.

In 1897, the company began creation of an automobile with an internal combustion engine. Using a Benz automobile purchased by von Röslerstamm as inspiration, the company built its first car, the Präsident, under the direction of engineers Hans Ledwinka and Edmund Rumpler. The Präsident was exhibited in Vienna later that year. The company began taking orders for cars, and between 1897 and 1900, nine improved cars based on the Präsident were made.

The first car to be completely designed by Ledwinka was the , which was produced in 1900. The Nesselsdorf A was equipped with a rear-mounted engine, and had a top speed of . 22 units were built.

The Nesselsdorf A was followed in 1902 by the Type B, which featured a central engine.

Ledwinka then left the company to concentrate on steam engine development. He returned in 1905, and designed a completely new car, the Type S, which was equipped with a 4-cylinder engine.

In 1912, production was badly affected by a strike that lasted 23 weeks, and von Röslerstamm left the company. In 1916, Ledwinka left the company again, this time to work for one of its competitors, Steyr-Werke in Graz.

==Tatra concept==
In 1919 the company began using the Tatra brand for its cars.

In 1921 the company was renamed &quot;Kopřivnická vozovka&quot;. That year, the company&#x27;s director, Leopold Pasching, convinced Ledwinka to return to the company to run its new car plant.

Ledwinka&#x27;s next design, the Tatra 11, which was released in 1923, featured a rigid backbone tube with swinging semi-axles at the rear giving independent suspension. The Tatra 11 was fitted with a front-mounted, air-cooled two-cylinder engine.

In 1924 the company was renamed &quot;&quot;Závody Tatra&quot;.

The Tatra 17, released in 1925, featured a water-cooled six-cylinder engine, and fully independent suspension.

In 1926, the Tatra 11 was succeeded by the Tatra 12, which was similar to the Tatra 11, but was equipped with four-wheel brakes.

In 1927 the company was renamed &quot;Ringhoffer-Tatra&quot;&quot;.

==Prewar streamliners==
Tatra&#x27;s specialty was luxury cars using the most recent technology, going from air-cooled flat-twins to fours and sixes, culminating (briefly) with the OHC 6-litre V12 in 1931. In the 1930s, under the supervision of Austrian engineer Hans Ledwinka, his son Erich and German engineer Erich Übelacker, and protected by high tariffs and absence of foreign assemblers, Tatra began building advanced, streamlined cars after obtaining licences from Paul Jaray, which started in 1934 with the large Tatra 77, the world&#x27;s first production aerodynamic car. The average drag coefficient of a 1:5 model of the fastback Tatra 77 was recorded as 0.2455. It featured (as did almost all subsequent big Tatras) a rear-mounted, air-cooled V8 engine.

==Tatra and the conception of the Volkswagen Beetle==
Both Adolf Hitler and Ferdinand Porsche were influenced by the Tatras. Hitler was a keen automotive enthusiast, and had ridden in Tatras during political tours of Czechoslovakia. He had also dined numerous times with Ledwinka. After one of these dinners Hitler remarked to Porsche, &quot;This is the car for my roads&quot;. From 1933 onwards, Ledwinka and Porsche met regularly to discuss their designs, and Porsche admitted &quot;Well, sometimes I looked over his shoulder and sometimes he looked over mine&quot; while designing the Volkswagen. There is no doubt that the Beetle bore a striking resemblance to the Tatras, particularly the Tatra V570. The Tatra 97 of 1936 had a rear-located, rear-wheel drive, air-cooled four-cylinder boxer engine accommodating four passengers and providing luggage storage under the front bonnet and behind the rear seat. Another similarity between this Tatra and the Beetle is the central structural tunnel. Tatra launched a lawsuit against Volkswagen for patent infringement, but this was stopped when Germany invaded Czechoslovakia. At the same time, Tatra was forced to stop producing the T97. The matter was re-opened after World War II and in 1965 Volkswagen paid the Ringhoffer family in an out of court settlement.

Tatra and Volkswagen&#x27;s body design were preceded by similar designs of Hungarian automotive engineer Bela Barenyi, whose sketches resembling the Volkswagen Beetle date back to 1925.

==War years==
After the 1938 invasion of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany, Tatras were kept in production, largely because Germans liked the cars. Many German officers died in car accidents caused by driving the heavy, rear-engined Tatras faster around corners than they could handle. At the time, as an anecdote, Tatra became known as the &#x27;Czech Secret Weapon&#x27; for the scores of officers who died behind the wheel; at one point official orders were issued forbidding German officers from driving Tatras.
Tatra was instrumental in the production of trucks and tank engines for the German war effort.

==Postwar management==
The factory was nationalised in 1945 almost three years before the Communist Party came to power and in January 1946 was renamed &quot;&quot;. Although production of prewar models continued, a new model, the Tatra 600 Tatraplan was designed—the name celebrating the new Communist planned economy and the aeroplane inspiration (Colloq. Czech: aeroplán). It went into production in 1948. In 1951, the state planning department decided that the Tatraplan should henceforth be built at the Škoda plant in Mladá Boleslav, leaving Tatra free to concentrate on trucks, buses and railway equipment.

==The Tatra 603==

In 1953, amid much dissatisfaction among Communist party leaders with the poor-quality official cars imported from Russia, Tatra was again given permission to produce a luxury car, the Tatra 603. Much like Tatra&#x27;s prewar cars, it was driven by a rear-mounted, air-cooled V8 and had the company&#x27;s trademark aerodynamic styling. The Tatra 603 initially featured three headlights and the first prototypes had a central rear stabilising fin, though this feature was lost on production vehicles. It was also fitted with almost American-style thick chrome bumpers with bullets (a.k.a. Dagmar bumpers). Almost entirely hand-built, Tatras were not available for normal citizens as they were not permitted to buy them. The cars were reserved for the Communist Party elite and industrial officials, as well as being exported to most other communist nations as official state cars. Notably, Cuban President Fidel Castro had a white Tatra 603, custom-fitted with air conditioning.

Tatra 603s were built until 1975, a twenty-year reign as one of communism&#x27;s finest cars. Numerous improvements were made during its production run, although not all vehicles built were actually new but rather reconditioned. In exchange for a newer model year car, the older vehicle was returned to the factory. There, it was upgraded to current model year specifications, refinished, and sent out again as a putatively new vehicle to replace another older T603. This makes it difficult to trace the history of surviving vehicles.

==1970s makeover—the Tatra 613==
In 1968 a replacement was developed: the Tatra 613. It was styled by the Italian styling house of Vignale and was a more modern, less rounded shape. It was not until 1973 that the car went into production, and volume production did not begin until the following year. Although the layout remained the same, the body was all new, as was the engine, which was equipped with four overhead camshafts, a higher capacity motor (3495 cc) and an output close to . In addition, it had been moved somewhat forward for improved balance. These cars were built in five series and went through several modifications until production ceased in 1996. Over 11,000 cars were built, and sales slowed to a trickle of just a few dozen per year towards the end of production as Tatras began to seem more and more outdated.

==1990s Tatra 700==
The Tatra 700 was a large luxury car released in 1996 by Tatra. It was essentially a heavily restyled version of the Tatra 613 model it replaced, with updated body panels and detailing. The T700 was offered as both a saloon and coupé with either a 3.5 or 4.4 litre 90° air-cooled V8 petrol engine.
The model was neither successful nor produced in large numbers, with a total of 69–72 cars manufactured. The T700 was the last passenger car made by Tatra with production halting in 1999. At this point, Tatra abandoned automobile manufacturing in order to concentrate on truck design and manufacture.

==1990s Tatra MTX V8==

The Tatra MTX V8 was the fastest Czech car of all time. Production started in 1991 in Kopřivnice. It has a Tatra 623 V8 engine with inlet manifold injection producing 225 kW at 6500 rpm. It accelerates from 0– in 5.6 seconds. The top speed is . The Czech designer Václav Král designed this vehicle, with only five ever produced.

==2000s==
In February 2008, Tatra announced the world&#x27;s first and only air-cooled engine meeting the then forthcoming Euro 5 emissions standards. The press release claims 7.5 times lower emissions of particulates and 3.5 times lower emission of nitrogen oxides compared to the previous engine. Further, production of air-cooled engines should significantly reduce the production of greenhouse gases due to the absence of liquid cooling systems. All Tatra vehicles from February 2008 onwards should use the new engine. A month later, Tatra CEO Ronald Adams told &quot;The Prague Post&quot; Tatra could return to producing passenger cars, saying: &quot;We would not come back to compete with the large automobile mass producers such as Volkswagen, Škoda, Toyota etc. But we might come back with a replica of the old Tatra cars using a current undercarriage and driveline from one of the major automotive producers.&quot; The company has launched a feasibility study, hoping to produce one thousand replicas of their legendary Tatraplan and 603 cars in 2010.

In July 2008 pictures of a fuel cell concept car designed by Mike Jelinek, the Tatra 903, were shown.

A Tatra 87 is on exhibit at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.
==Trucks==
===1898–1914 beginning===

The first truck manufactured at Kopřivnice in 1898 was a flatbed with two liquid-cooled side-by-side-mounted two-cylinder Benz engines each at 2.7 L capacity with total power output of 8.8 kW (12 hp) placed after the rear axle and cargo capacity of 2.5 ton. The unique feature of the engines setup was that the engines could be operated sequentially depending on the load requirements. No 1 engine was started via a cranking handle and had a flywheel attached and No 2 engine without the flywheel was connected via a gear clutch and started by the first engine already running.

The second truck manufactured was once again a flatbed R type of 2.5 ton cargo capacity built in 1909. Powered by liquid-cooled petrol four-cylinder engine of 4.1 L capacity and power output of 18.4 kW (25 hp) with the engine placed above front axle which is the conventional design to this day. The vehicle featured solid rubber tyres and semi-elliptic leaf spring suspension. In 1910 Tatra manufactured its first bus the Omnibus type SO with total production of five units.

===1914–1922 serial production===

The first true serial truck production at Tatra was instigated by the beginning of World War I. In the year 1914 there were only two trucks made, type T 14/40 HP; however by 1915&#x27;s end the production jumped to a total of 105 TL-2 units, and the following year, 1916, the numbers rose to a total of 196 TL-2 and 30 TL-4. Production peaked in 1917 with 19 TL-2 and 303 TL-4 models, but then production declined, and a similar number of vehicles of one type manufactured in a year was not achieved or surpassed until 1936 with the T 27 model.

Technically models TL-2 and TL-4 were almost identically designed; in fact TL-4 evolved from TL-2 where both had liquid-cooled OHC engines of max power output of . The TL-2 had a GVM and GCM, TL-4 had GVM and GCM respectively. Both types remained in production in small series until 1927. The TL-4 is considered the first truck to come out of NW (Nesselsdorfer Wagen-bau) to carry the name Tatra in 1919.

===1923–1938 Tatra concept===

After the introduction of Tatra 11 and Tatra 12 cars with their distinctive backbone tube design and swing axles, Tatra introduced its first truck on the same basis, the light utility Tatra 13 powered by 2-cylinder air-cooled petrol engine with power output 8.8 kW (12 hp) and cargo capacity. Further models followed, and in 1926, T23 and T24 were introduced, nicknamed &quot;bulldogs&quot;, which could be considered Tatra&#x27;s precursors to COE designed trucks. Improved version T13 was introduced as T26 with a more powerful 4-cylinder flat air-cooled engine and in six-wheeler chassis created capable offroad light utility truck which later evolved into T72 model which was heavily used by Czechoslovakian army at the time and was also manufactured under license by the French company Lorraine-Dietrich. In 1933 Tatra built a limited series of T25 heavy artillery hauler with 4 and 6-cylinder petrol engines. The most popular Tatra truck before World War II was type T27 powered by 4-cylinder petrol or diesel engines, which remained in production for nearly 17 years (1930–1947) with total production of 7,620 units. By adding an extra axle to the rear the type T28 was created; however, it was not successful and only limited production resulted in a mainly bus chassis. In the period from 1931 to 1938 Tatra also built a small utility truck based on the chassis from T30 named Tatra T43 which remain popular with small business owners. T72 model successfully continued the line to T82 built mainly for military in cargo and personnel transport between 1935 and 1938 and further to T92 and T93 built for the Romanian army from 1938 to 1941 which were identical except T93 had also a driven front axle.

===1939–1956 World War II and beyond===
Following the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia the production at Kopřivnice was annexed by the Germans for the supply of trucks needed by the Wehrmacht. Apart from the existing line up of T27, T92/92 a new heavy truck, the T81, commenced production featuring liquid-cooled 12.5 L V8 diesel engine with a power output of , in 6×4 axle configuration. This vehicle evolved in 1942 into the T111 which continued in production until 1962, with the total of 33,690 units made. The T111 also featured Tatra&#x27;s first air-cooled diesel engine, a massive V12 originally designed for the armoured Sd.Kfz. 234 Puma. In the latter stages of World War II Tatra was instrumental in the development of air-cooled diesel engines for German tanks. In late 1944 General Heinz Guderian ordered that production of the Type 38(t) Hetzer tank be modified to incorporate a Tatra Type 928 V-8 air-cooled diesel engine, though this order was delayed so production could continue uninterrupted. After the war the T111 contributed heavily to the rebuilding effort in Central and Eastern Europe and a memorial was built at Magadan, Siberia, for its exploits in the Far East of the USSR.

===1957–1982 moving forward===
The decision to replace the reliable but ageing T111 was taken in 1952 based on central planning economy of socialist government where directive was made to Tatra N.P. that it should concentrate on the manufacture of 7 to 10 ton capacity commercial vehicles and in 1956 first T137 and T138 trucks were exhibited at the Czechoslovak machinery expo in Brno. Production of the T111 continued alongside the T138 series until 1962. The T138 itself continued in production until 1969 when it was replaced by the T148, which provided an increase in power output, reliability and product improvements.

In 1967 Tatra began production of the T813 off-road truck using its modular construction technology; the model incorporated the latest trends in commercial vehicle design such as cab-over-engine (COE) and wide profile tyres. It featured a new V12 engine and all military versions had a central tyre inflation/deflation system as standard equipment. The T813 was designed to tow loads up to 100 ton GCM and it was a familiar sight on the roads in Czechoslovakia hauling large, often over-sized loads.

===1982–2008 T815 and beyond===

The Tatra 815 was designed for extreme off-road conditions, and its road versions are derived from the off-road original. After the 53rd session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, a directive was issued that Tatra N.P. would be the sole supplier of off-road commercial vehicles of &lt;12 ton capacity for Eastern Bloc countries, leading to a modernization of the company and its production models. Following extensive testing at different sites, including Siberia, the type T815 was introduced in 1982 with production starting in 1983. The T815 was made of 142 main assembly components as opposed to the 219 main assembly components of its predecessor. The engine&#x27;s power output was increased by up to 45% and a new COE tiltable cabin was introduced. Modular engine designs resulted in offerings of V8, V10 or V12 engines with or without turbocharger.

T815 was upgraded to T815-2 with minor cosmetic changes and improved ergonomics and safety – the biggest change was the engine emissions accordance with the &quot;Euro0&quot; limits and to Euro I limits in 1993 (turbocharged V8 engine only since this time for the full legislation; the Deutz 513 air-cooled V8 engine was offered as an alternative). The TerrNo1, introduced in 1997, featured a redesigned cabin as well as better sound and heat insulation than the previous models. The TerrNo1 was based on the same frame as the previous models, so its cabin could be retrofitted to all type T815s built since 1993. In 2000, the TerrNo1 cabin was again redesigned, and for the first time there was an option to fit liquid-cooled engines.

The TerrNo1 model introduced the &#x27;KingFrame rear axle suspension setup. Another step in evolution for the T3B engine came with the Euro II emission limits. Following further improvements in 2003, the T815 had the new Euro III T3C V8 engine mated to all new 14-speed range+split gearbox as well as an option for engines from other suppliers such as Caterpillar, Cummins, Detroit Diesel, Deutz and MTU to be fitted. In September 2006, Tatra introduced its Euro IV compliant turbocharged T3D engine with the SCR exhaust technology and in February 2008 the company introduced the world&#x27;s first Euro V-compliant air-cooled diesel engine based on the T3D engine.

The T816 (T815-6) Armax and Force series, derivatives of Tatra 815, were introduced in 1993 after Tatra participated in the tender process to supply heavy duty off-road trucks to the UAE armed forces. After two years of bidding, the company secured a contract worth $180 million.

The resulting model became known as T816 &quot;LIWA&quot; (Arabic for &quot;desert&quot;). The latest model intended for military customers is the T817 (T815-7), marketed primarily toward the armed services of NATO member countries as a high-mobility heavy-duty tactical truck with a low profile cabin for C-130 Hercules transportability.

During the 1990s, Tatra decided to produce a bonneted CBE heavy duty off-road truck to continue the successful line started with the T111. This resulted in the T163 Jamal, which was put into full production in 1999 after the first prototypes were built in 1997 and following extensive testing. The T163 was purpose-built to be a heavy duty dump truck due to demand, and was based on Tatra&#x27;s signature backbone tube chassis construction with its cabin being designed by Jiří Španihel. The truck is used mainly on construction sites and in quarries.

Tatra was also a successful bidder for the Czech Army replacement of aging Praga V3S (with the Tatra I6 air-cooled engine – one half of the T111 V12 one) medium off-road truck with T810 which technically is not a &quot;genuine&quot; Tatra as its origin goes back to when former Czech company ROSS, in partnership with Renault Trucks, obtained a contract to supply the army with medium size off-road trucks, the &quot;ROSS R210 6×6&quot;. The company however went bankrupt in 1998 and Tatra bought full rights to the design, then modernized and reintroduced it as T810 while continuing cooperation with Renault. Under the deal Renault supplies the cabins and the engines and Praga supplied axles and transmissions for the prototypes; however, the whole project has been dogged by controversy due to the way Tatra had obtained the contract, its relationship with supplier Praga and the subsequent court case brought against it by Praga.

The serial T810 vehicles are equipped with the new design Tatra rigid axles with the WABCO disc brakes, with the ZF Ecolite transmission and Steyr drop box.

===Navistar and Tatra===
Tatra and Navistar Defence introduced at Eurosatory Exposition in Paris, France (Jun 14–18 2010), the results of their strategic alliance since October 2009, the models ATX6 (universal container carrier) and ATX8 (troop carrier). The vehicles appear to be based on Tatra 815-7 (T817) 6×6, 8×8 chassis, suspension and cabins while using Navistar engines and other components. Under the deal Navistar Defence and Tatra A.S. will market the vehicles in North America, which includes sales to the United States military and foreign military sales financed by the United States government. Tatra will source parts and components through Navistar&#x27;s global parts and support network for Tatra trucks delivered in markets outside of North America as well as market Navistar-Tatra vehicles around the world in their primary markets.

==Ownership==
The Terex Corporation, an American company, acquired the majority ownership (71%) of Tatra in late 2003. As of late 2006, however, majority ownership (80.51%) was in the hands of Tatra Holdings s.r.o., an international consortium comprising Vectra Limited of UK, Sam Eyde of the U.S., KBC Private Equity of Belgium, Meadowhill s.r.o. of Czech Republic and Ronald Adams of the U.S. On 15 December 2006, a contract was signed between Tatra and the Czech Republic for 556 trucks at roughly $130 million, or 2.6 billion Czech crowns. This contract was signed in lieu of replacement of older military vehicles.

In April 2007, Tatra announced that it had already matched its production in 2006 and produced 1,600 vehicles. In 2007, Tatra planned to produce between 2,300 and 2,500 vehicles. In contrast to previous years, Tatra has increased employment by the hundreds within the past two quarters, has reversed previous errors, and was growing again.

In August 2011, DAF Trucks announced it had built up a 19% stake in Tatra to tighten up cooperation between the companies. DAF&#x27;s cabs and Paccar engines became mainstay of the civilian Tatra 158 Phoenix, while DAF dealerships started selling Tatra trucks.

In early 2013, Tatra was facing mounting financial problems. Even though the company had sufficient orders for new trucks, manufacturing was halted as banks refused to provide further loans and company was facing imminent bankruptcy. In March 2013, majority stake in Tatra was acquired by major Czech defense contractor Czechoslovak Group and Czech metallurgy company Promet Group, which provided company with necessary financial stability. With new owners, Tatra focused its production primarily towards building specialist vehicles tailored to buyers&#x27; custom orders. While in 2013 sales amounted to 722 units, in 2023 the company plans to sell over 2,000 trucks, with future increases in sales requiring enlarging of manufacturing capacity.

== Current models ==
Tatra mostly supplies individual, highly specialized custom-made vehicles and also sells just the backbone chassis for use in other manufacturer&#x27;s trucks or specialized vehicles. The current serial production models are:

* Tatra 810 &quot;Tactic&quot; – medium off-road truck based on conventional frame, portal axles and equipped with Renault water-cooled engine and cabin. Primarily intended for military operators, also offered on civilian market.

* Tatra 817 &quot;Force&quot; – heavy off-road truck based on Tatra backbone chassis, Tatra air-cooled engines (other engines also possible) and Tatra cabin. Primarily intended for military operators, also offered on civilian market.

* Tatra 158 &quot;Phoenix&quot; – heavy off-road truck based on Tatra backbone chassis and equipped with DAF cabin and ZF water-cooled engines. Primarily intended for civilian operators, also offered on military market.

== Worldwide distribution ==
=== Germany ===
Several fire brigades and civil protection (THW) mostly in eastern Germany are traditionally using Tatra trucks. Tatra&#x27;s own conversion company THT build vehicles for fire brigades and civil protection. Popular in Germany is a large Water tender and pumper based on the Tatra 815. The vehicle&#x27;s water tank has a volume of 4,000 liters or more and a separate tank for foam agent. The 4×4 transmission and a gear wading depth of 1.20m make it suitable for rough terrain. In German use the vehicle is called &quot;TLF4000&quot; (Tanklöschfahrzeug 4000) and is primarily used at airports and to fight forest fires.

In 2021 the Bundeswehr fire brigade ordered 76 Tatra firefighting vehicles to fight forest fires (ordered by BwFuhrparkService GmbH). They are based upon the Tatra T 815-7 4×4 chassis, with equipment by Austrian Rosenbauer Group.

=== India ===
Tatra had a truck-building joint venture in India called Tatra Vectra Motors Ltd, formerly called Tatra Trucks India Ltd. It is a joint venture between Tatra and the Vectra Group from England. In 2002, the company received a 1,070 trucks order from the Government of India. Tatra&#x27;s growing involvement in India&#x27;s defense industry has been cited as an example of growing relations between Czech Republic and India.

In 2009, Vectra announced a new joint venture with Russia&#x27;s Kamaz to form Kamaz Vectra Motors Limited to manufacture Kamaz trucks in India. This joint venture replaced the former Tatra Vectra venture. The manufacturing plant is located in Hosur, Tamil Nadu. The fully integrated manufacturing facility includes an engine assembly and testing plant, a cabin welding shop, a frame fabrication shop and a test track. Most Tatra trucks for sale in India are manufactured in collaboration with Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML).

Tatra was part of a 2012 investigation in what has been described a &quot;procurement scam&quot; involving former BEML chief VRS Natarajan.

=== Israel ===

Reportedly following one of the Israeli-Arab conflicts, Israel tested some Tatras captured from the Egyptian armed forces. The Israel Defense Forces&#x27; command was apparently quite impressed with their performance, independent air cooling, and their capabilities as military trucks in long-range raiding operations in desert terrain, and became interested in including these trucks in their arsenal. As direct purchase from Czechoslovakia was impossible due to its alignment with Israeli foes, the lore has it that Israelis used the well-paid services of Nicolae Ceauşescu-led Romania, in cooperation with an American Company called ATC (American Truck Company) to purchase military trucks, including desert-equipped Tatras, leading to jokes that &quot;Romania has a new desert&quot;. Current photos of various Israeli weapon systems, including SPYDER slated for India, show new Tatras as the carrier vehicles.

A number of Tatra trucks entered service in the Israeli Army&#x27;s various sectors, with the brand mark of &quot;American Truck Company&quot;, under which Tatras were sold from the U.S. market and exported to Israel.

=== United States ===
&quot;American Truck Company&quot; was a quasi-independent company set up by Terex, when they controlled Tatra, to import Tatra vehicles in both knock down kits or fully built and carry out assembly operations, repair and service, body building on chassis in the United States. These trucks were offered to the military and other government organizations and were badged and sold in the United States under the ATC brand. ATC badged Tatras were fitted with American Cummins turbodiesel engines in place of the Tatra&#x27;s air-cooled diesel.

==Tatra aircraft==
The Ringhoffer-Tatra Works Ltd. produced several aircraft and aero-engines in the 1930s and 1940s before annexation by Germany, and after under the orders of the RLM. Among the aircraft produced were the following:-

===Built under licence===

<doc id="69581" wikidata="Q16513962" url="?curid=69581" title="Gná and Hófvarpnir">
<text>In Norse mythology, Gná (Old Norse: ) is a goddess who runs errands in other worlds for the goddess Frigg and rides the flying, sea-treading horse Hófvarpnir (O.N.: , &quot;he who throws his hoofs about&quot;, &quot;hoof-thrower&quot; or &quot;hoof kicker&quot;). Gná and Hófvarpnir are attested in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholarly theories have been proposed about Gná as a &quot;goddess of fullness&quot; and as potentially cognate to Fama from Roman mythology. Hófvarpnir and the eight-legged steed Sleipnir have been cited examples of transcendent horses in Norse mythology.

==Attestations==
In chapter 35 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the enthroned figure of High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur. High lists Gná thirteenth, and says that Frigg sends her off to different worlds to run errands. High adds that Gná rides the horse Hófvarpnir, and that this horse has the ability to ride through the air and atop the sea. High continues that &quot;once some Vanir saw her path as she rode through the air&quot; and that an unnamed one of these Vanir says, in verse:

:&quot;What flies there?
:What fares there?
:or moves through the air?&quot;

Gná responds in verse, in doing so providing the parentage of Hófvarpnir; the horses Hamskerpir and Garðrofa:

:&quot;I fly not
:though I fare
:and move through the air
:on Hofvarpnir
:the one whom Hamskerpir got
:with Gardrofa.&quot;

The source for these stanzas is not provided and they are otherwise unattested. High ends his description of Gná by saying that &quot;from Gna&#x27;s name comes the custom of saying that something &quot;gnaefir&quot; [looms] when it rises up high.&quot; In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Gná is included among a list of 27 ásynjur names.

==Theories==

Rudolf Simek says that the etymology that Snorri presents in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; for the name &quot;Gná&quot; may not be correct, yet it is unclear what the name may otherwise mean, though Gná has also been etymologically theorized as a &quot;goddess of fullness.&quot; John Lindow calls the verse exchange between the Vanir and Gná &quot;strange&quot; and points out that it&#x27;s unclear why it should specifically be the Vanir that witness Gná flying through the air.

Ulla Loumand cites Hófvarpnir and the eight-legged horse Sleipnir as &quot;prime examples&quot; of horses in Norse mythology as being able to &quot;mediate between earth and sky, between Ásgarðr, Miðgarðr and Útgarðr and between the world of mortal men and the underworld.&quot; In the 19th century, Jacob Grimm proposed a cognate in the personified rumor in Roman mythology; Fama. However, Grimm notes that unlike Fama, Gná is not described as winged but rather that Hófvarpnir, like the winged-horse Pegasus, may have been.

<doc id="69583" wikidata="Q1254651" url="?curid=69583" title="Hlín">
<text>In Norse mythology, Hlín is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. Hlín appears in a poem in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. Scholars have debated whether the stanza referring to her in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; refers to Frigg. &quot;Hlín&quot; serves as a given name in Iceland, and Hlín receives veneration in the modern era in Germanic paganism&#x27;s modern extension, Heathenry.

==Etymology==
Scholars frequently explain the meaning behind the goddess&#x27;s name as &#x27;protector&#x27;. The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; section &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; derives the name from a verb found in a proverb in an obscure and otherwise unattested Old Norse proverb: &quot;Þiaðan af er þat orðtak at sá er forðask hleinir&quot;. Scholars generally accept that the theonym &quot;Hlín&quot; derives from the verb &quot;hleina&quot;. However, the verb &quot;hleina&quot; in which the section claims a derivation is obscure (a &quot;hapax legomenon&quot;), and translators have attempted to work around it in a variety of manners, in some cases leaving the verb untranslated. Examples include the translations of Anthony Faulkes (&quot;From this comes the saying that someone who escapes finds refuge (&quot;hleinir&quot;)&quot;, 1995 [1987]) and Jesse Byock (&quot;From her name comes the expression that he who escapes finds &quot;hleinir&quot; [peace and quiet]&quot;, 2005).

Scholars have proposed a variety of derivations for the verb. The verb is most commonly linked to Old English &quot;hlinian&quot; and &quot;hlænan&quot;, ancestors to the modern English verb &quot;lean&quot;. 19th century scholars, including Jacob Grimm, linked &quot;hleina&quot; to the rare Old Norse noun &quot;hlynr&quot;, meaning &#x27;maple tree&#x27;. Grimm links this derivation to a variety of tree figures found in folklore from the modern era in northwest Europe. Joseph Hopkins (2017) comments that this derivation may deserve further investigation in light of the potential connection between the Old Norse goddess name &quot;Ilmr&quot; and the Old Norse common noun &quot;almr&quot; (Elm tree), and says that &quot;the potential of a protective tree goddess brings to mind a mysterious passage in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; involving the rowan, in which the tree is referred to as [Thor&#x27;s] &quot;bjǫrg&quot; [&#x27;aid, help, salvation, rescue&#x27;]&quot;.

==Attestations==
In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, Hlín receives a mention regarding the foretold death of the god Odin during the immense battle waged at Ragnarök:

:Then is fulfilled Hlín&#x27;s
:second sorrow,
:when Óðinn goes
:to fight with the wolf,
:and Beli&#x27;s slayer,
:bright, against Surtr.
:Then shall Frigg&#x27;s
:sweet friend fall.
The death of Odin (the stanza&#x27;s &quot;second sorrow&quot;) implies a first death. Scholars all but universally view this as a reference to the death of the god Baldr, Frigg and Odin&#x27;s son. Some translators replace the reference of Hlín to a mention of Frigg due to their interpretations of the stanza (see discussion in &quot;Scholarly reception and interpretation&quot; section below).

In chapter 35 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Hlín is listed twelfth among a series of sixteen goddesses. High tells Gangleri (earlier in the book described as King Gylfi in disguise) that Hlín &quot;is given the function of protecting people whom Frigg wishes to save from some danger.&quot; High continues that, from this, comes the saying that &quot;someone who escapes finds refuge (&quot;hleinar&quot;).&quot; The verb &quot;hleina&quot; in this passage is obscure and has yielded a variety of translations (see &quot;etymology&quot; section above).

In chapter 51, the above-mentioned &quot;Völuspá&quot; stanza is quoted. In chapter 75 of the book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; Hlín appears within a list of 27 ásynjur names.

In skaldic poetry, the name Hlín is frequent in kennings for women. Examples include &quot;Hlín hringa&quot; (&#x27;Hlín of rings&#x27;), &quot;Hlín goðvefjar&quot; (&#x27;Hlín of velvet&#x27;) and &quot;arm-Hlín&quot; (&#x27;arm-Hlín&#x27;). The name is already used frequently in this way by the 10th-century poet Kormákr Ögmundarson and remains current in skaldic poetry through the following centuries, employed by poets such as Þórðr Kolbeinsson, Gizurr Þorvaldsson and Einarr Gilsson. The name remained frequently used in woman kennings in rímur poetry, sometimes as Lín.

In a verse in &quot;Hávarðar saga Ísfirðings&quot;, the phrase &quot;á Hlín fallinn&quot; (&quot;fallen on Hlín&quot;) occurs. Some editors have emended the line while others have accepted the reading and taken Hlín to refer to the earth.

==Modern influence==
In line with a cultural practice to use Old Norse theonyms as personal names, &quot;Hlín&quot; appears as a given name for females in Iceland. Like other goddesses from the North Germanic corpus, Hlín receives veneration in Heathenry.

==Scholarly reception and interpretation==
Although the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; identifies Hlín as a separate goddess than Frigg, many scholars identify Hlín as another name for Frigg. For example, Andy Orchard says that in &quot;Völuspá&quot;, Hlín appears to be just another name for Frigg, and adds that &quot;the numerous occurrences of the name in skaldic poetry in poetic periphrases or kennings for women do nothing to dispel the confusion.&quot; Rudolf Simek agrees that Hlín seems to appear as another name for Frigg in &quot;Völuspá&quot;, and that in skaldic poetry Hlín was a well-known mythological figure by the 10th century. Simek states that Hlín is likely simply another name for Frigg, and that Snorri &quot;misunderstood her to be a goddess in her own right in his reading of the &quot;Völuspá&quot; stanza.&quot;

However, in the same work, Simek also says that the goddesses Sága, Hlín, Sjöfn, Snotra, Vár, and Vör should be considered vaguely defined figures who &quot;should be seen as female protective goddesses&quot; that are all responsible for &quot;specific areas of the private sphere, and yet clear differences were made between them so that they are in many ways similar to matrons.&quot;

Some scholars express uncertainty at identifying Hlín as another name for Frigg, and others reject the identification altogether. In a 2017 paper on the topic, Hopkins agrees with Simek&#x27;s comparison to the matrons and compares the scholarly reception of the goddess Fulla, another goddess closely associated with Frigg, to that of Hlín:

:&quot;Like Hlín, the name &quot;Fulla&quot; [&#x27;full, bountiful&#x27;] may be tempting to dismiss as a reading error on the part of a &quot;Prose Edda&quot; author or as a poetic invention ... Were it not for the preservation of the cognate theonym Volla in the Second Merseburg Charm, Fulla would remain in a similarly ambiguous position like that of Hlín, easily overlooked, dismissed, or deconstructed ... the correlations between the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and the Second Merseburg Incantation provide something of a cautionary tale: namely, by dismissing information found solely in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, one risks violating the foundational maxim of &quot;absence of evidence is not evidence of absence&quot;. There is no reason to doubt that Hlín was an independent entity in Old Norse mythology and no positive evidence to suggest that Hlín was merely a by-name of Frigg.&quot;

Referencing the iconography of the early Germanic matrons, Hopkins proposes an alternate reading of the &quot;Völuspá&quot; stanza in line with the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; description of the goddess. In Hopkins&#x27;s reading of the stanza, Hlín&#x27;s sorrows are her inability to protect figures close to Frigg: the first sorrow would therefore be the death of Baldr, and the second sorrow the foretold death of Odin.

<doc id="69584" wikidata="Q2776756" url="?curid=69584" title="Pi-HaHiroth">
<text>Pi-HaHiroth ( &quot;Pī haḤīrōṯ&quot;), is the fourth station of the Exodus mentioned in . The fifth and sixth stations Marah and Elim are located on the Red Sea. The biblical books Exodus and Numbers refer to Pi-HaHiroth as the place where the Israelites encamped between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baal Zephon, while awaiting an attack by the Pharaoh, prior to crossing the Red Sea.

==Etymology==
Some Egyptologists think the name reflects the Egyptian &quot;pr-ḥwt-ḥrt&quot;, a place mentioned in &quot;Papyrus Anastasis III&quot;. In fact, part of the mystery can be resolved by understanding the initial syllable ′Pi,′ which corresponds to the Egyptian word &quot;Pr&quot; or &quot;Pi&quot;, as &quot;House of&quot; such as in ′&quot;Pithom&quot;′ or ′&quot;Pi-Ramesses&quot;′. The next literary fragment ′Ha′ (&quot;ḥwt&quot;) would indicate the ′temple′, representing an Egyptian convention beginning with the hieroglyphic &quot;pr-ḥwt&quot;, “estate of the temple”, while the fact that the name ends with the goddess determinative indicates that the final element, &quot;ḥrt&quot;, is theophoric.

The Revised Version of the Bible at the first use of the name Pi-HaHiroth has a link to a footnote that says &quot;Or, where the desert tracks begin&quot;.

==Identification==
The Egyptologist David A. Falk suggests that Pi-HaHiroth was located somewhere on the way from the Sea of Reeds (&quot;pȜ ṯwfy&quot;) towards Pi-Ramesses, based on the description of the site&#x27;s location in &quot;Papyrus Anastasis III&quot;. &quot;Strong&#x27;s Concordance&quot; simply locates Pi-HaHiroth as &#x27;a place on the eastern border of Egypt&#x27;.

<doc id="69585" wikidata="Q691626" url="?curid=69585" title="House of Savoy-Carignano">
<text>The House of Savoy-Carignano (; ) originated as a cadet branch of the House of Savoy. It was founded by Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano (1596–1656), an Italian military commander who was the fifth son of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy. His descendants were accepted as &quot;princes étrangers&quot; at the court of France, where some held prominent positions. Upon the extinction of the main Savoy line, they eventually came to reign as kings of Sardinia from 1831 to 1861, and as kings of Italy from 1861 until the dynasty&#x27;s deposition in 1946. The Savoy-Carignano family also briefly supplied a king each to Spain and Croatia, as well as queens consort to Bulgaria and Portugal.

==Origin==
Born in Turin, Thomas Francis of Savoy was the youngest of the five legitimate sons of Charles Emmanuel I, sovereign Duke of Savoy, by his wife, Catherine Micaela of Spain (daughter of King Philip II of Spain and his consort, Elizabeth of Valois, a French princess). While still a young man, he bore arms in Italy in the service of the king of Spain.

Although in previous reigns younger sons of Savoy had been granted rich appanages in Switzerland (Genevois and Vaud), Italy (Aosta), or France (Nemours and Bresse), the Savoy dukes found that this inhibited their own aggrandizement while encouraging intra-dynastic strife and regional secession. Not only did Thomas Francis have older brothers but he was just one of the twenty-one acknowledged children of Charles Emmanuel. While only nine of these were legitimate, the others, being the widowed duke&#x27;s offspring by noble mistresses, appear to have been generously endowed or dowered during their father&#x27;s lifetime.

The fief of Carignano had belonged to the Savoys since 1418, and the fact that it was part of the Principality of Piedmont, only twenty kilometers south of Turin, meant that it could be a princedom for Thomas in name only, being endowed neither with independence nor revenues of substance. Instead of receiving a significant patrimony, Thomas was wed in 1625 to Marie de Bourbon, sister and co-heiress of Louis, Count of Soissons, who would be killed in 1641 while fomenting rebellion against Cardinal Richelieu.

==France==
In anticipation of this inheritance, Thomas Francis and Marie did not establish themselves at his brother&#x27;s ducal capital, Turin, but dwelt in Paris, where Marie enjoyed the exalted rank of a &quot;princesse du sang&quot;, being a second cousin of King Louis XIII. It was arranged that Thomas Francis, as son of a reigning monarch, would hold the rank of first among the &quot;princes étrangers&quot; at the French court—taking precedence even before the formerly all-powerful House of Guise, whose kinship to the sovereign Duke of Lorraine was more remote.

Thomas Francis was appointed &quot;Grand Maître&quot; of the king&#x27;s household, briefly replacing the traitorous &quot;Grand Condé&quot;. He engaged the services of the distinguished grammarian and courtier Claude Favre de Vaugelas as tutor for his children. The prospect of Marie&#x27;s eventual succession to the Swiss principality of Neuchâtel, near Savoy, was foiled in 1643 by the king&#x27;s decision to legitimate Louis Henri de Bourbon, &quot;chevalier&quot; de Soissons (1640–1703), a son of Marie&#x27;s late brother. Although this prevented the substitution of Savoyard for French influence in that region, it left Thomas with little more than the empty title of prince de Carignan. Marie eventually inherited her brother&#x27;s main holding in France, the county of Soissons; this would be established as a secundogeniture for the French branch of the family. After Thomas Francis, the senior branch of his descendants repatriated to Savoy, alternately marrying French, Italian, and German princesses.

==Service with Spain==
The first recorded military service of Thomas Francis is as a commander in the Savoyard army under his father against France during the War of the Mantuan Succession in 1630. Cardinal Mazarin induced him to become in effect a French agent at the Savoyard court between 1630 and 1632. When the new Duke Victor Amadeus I was forced to accept French occupation of Pinerolo in the Peace of Cherasco in 1631, there was widespread dissatisfaction in Savoy, and Thomas Francis, with his brother, Prince Maurice, withdrew from the duchy to join the forces of Spain, prompting Victor Amadeus to confiscate his uncles&#x27; Italian revenues. Although his kinship to both the French and Spanish royal families suggested that he could be useful to Spanish interests, Thomas Francis was not entirely trusted, and was obliged to send his wife and children to Madrid as hostages.

When France launched the Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659), Thomas Francis served under the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand, brother of Philip IV in the Spanish Netherlands. Savoy was reluctantly dragged into the fighting alongside the French, consequently Thomas Francis was strictly fighting against his own homeland. He was completely defeated and his army entirely killed, captured, or scattered—the first in an unbroken career of military defeats. He managed to rally the remnants at Namur, then retreated before the numerically superior French and Dutch forces, and he probably served the rest of the campaign with Ferdinand. In 1636, Thomas Francis served with the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand who organised a joint Spanish-Imperialist army for a major invasion of France from the Spanish Netherlands. The invasion was initially very successful, and seemed capable of reaching Paris, where there was a great panic; if Ferdinand and Thomas had pushed on, they might have ended the war at this point. Instead, they both felt that continuing to Paris was too risky, so they stopped the advance. Later in the campaign, Thomas had problems with the Imperialist general Ottavio Piccolomini, who refused to accept orders from the Prince as a Spanish commander, arguing that his Imperialist troops were an independent force. In this year, when his brother-in-law Louis de Bourbon, comte de Soissons, fled from France after his failed conspiracy against Cardinal Richelieu, Thomas Francis acted as intermediary between Soissons and the Spanish in negotiations which led to a formal alliance between the count and Philip IV of Spain concluded 28 June 1637, although within a month Soissons had reconciled with France. In 1638, Thomas served in Spanish Flanders, helping to defend the fortress-city of Saint-Omer against a French siege.

==Piedmontese Civil War==

After seeking Spanish support late in 1638 for action against the Regent Christine of Savoy, &quot;Madame Royale&quot;, Thomas went to Milan early in 1639, and alongside Spanish forces invaded Piedmont, where many towns welcomed him. He took Turin by knavery but the French continued to control its citadel. In 1640, he held the city in the multi-layered siege of Turin. After repeated bouts of negotiations with the Regent and the French, Thomas Francis made peace with both in the first half of 1642, unblushingly changed sides, and started fighting with the French against the Spaniards.

===Service with France===
For the rest of 1642 and part of the 1643 campaigns, Thomas Francis commanded Savoyard forces fighting alongside the French under Henri II d&#x27;Orléans, duc de Longueville, against the Spanish, generally along the Piedmont–Milan border; when Longueville was recalled home, he succeeded him as allied commander-in-chief, with Henri de la Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne, as his second-in-command. Thomas Francis was given the supreme command only because of his birth; another French general, César de Choiseul du Plessis Praslin, observed a few years later that French marshals would only serve under someone who was superior to them in social rank, and Thomas Francis, with his blood relationship to the French and Spanish royal families, was the only candidate.

By late summer, both Thomas Francis and Turenne were seriously ill and du Plessis Praslin was in temporary command. Thomas Francis led the joint armies again in 1644, taking Santya and Asti; he also tried to take Finale Ligure but gave up the attempt, apparently because he feared this valuable port would end up under French control rather than Savoyard. In 1645, now commanding with du Plessis Praslin, he took Vigevano, and repulsed a Spanish attempt to block his withdrawal at the River Mora, the nearest he ever came to a success in the field. In 1646, Thomas Francis was put in command of the French expedition sent south to take the Tuscan forts, after which he was to advance further south to Naples, drive out the Spanish and put himself on the throne of the kingdom; but the expedition set off late, and when he besieged Orbetello, the supporting French fleet was defeated by the Spanish and he was forced to raise the siege and conduct a difficult retreat, which he performed poorly. In the 1647 campaign, Thomas Francis is mentioned as commanding alongside the French general in the forces sent across north Italy to work with the Duke of Modena Francesco I d&#x27;Este who had just allied with France and opened up a &#x27;second front&#x27; against the Spaniards in Milan, though Mazarin confessed that he had appointed Thomas only because he feared that, if left behind in Piedmont, the Prince&#x27;s restless spirit would make more trouble.

During his absence, Regent Christine had gained control of the fortresses granted to Thomas Francis as part of the settlement of the Piedmontese Civil War (legally, these reverted to ducal control when the Duke came of age, which under Savoyard law Charles Emmanuel did in 1648, though his mother remained in control of the government; Christine, accompanied by her son and part of the ducal army, entered Ivrea and dismissed Thomas&#x27; personal garrison; she appointed Thomas Francis instead as governor or Asti and Alba, positions which sweetened the blow but were entirely under ducal control, not guaranteed by treaty. When he returned to Piedmont, Thomas had no choice but to accept the fait accompli, and soon after this he went to live in Paris. During the Fronde, Thomas Francis linked himself closely with Cardinal Mazarin who, although effectively chief minister of France, was like him an Italian outsider at the French court. In the early 1650s, Thomas Francis was seen as an important member of Mazarin&#x27;s party, closely linked to the Cardinal, regularly seen in conference with him, and active in his support. In 1651 when Mazarin had been forced into exile, the Prince was for a time brought onto the &quot;conseil du roi&quot;, and an admittedly very hostile contemporary Marie de Nemours, the Duchess of Nemours, described him as a &quot;prime minister without being aware of it&quot;. There were suggestions that Mazarin&#x27;s opponents within the court had raised him up as a rival to the cardinal with the Queen Regent Anne of Austria; this is unlikely, especially since Mazarin himself urged the Queen to follow Thomas&#x27; advice, and it is more probable that Mazarin backed the Prince as someone who would keep other rivals from gaining control in his absence but who would never have the status within France to set himself up as a permanent replacement for the Cardinal. By the time Mazarin returned from his second and last exile in February 1653, Thomas Francis, who accompanied the court to St Denis to welcome the Cardinal home, was insignificant again—an analysis of Mazarin&#x27;s close colleagues at this time by the later historian Pierre Adolphe Chéruel made no mention of him.

In January 1654, when the last of the ceremonial offices formerly belonging to the rebel leader Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé, were disposed of, Prince Thomas Francis was made &quot;Grand Maitre&quot;. The Franco-Spanish war had been continuing in north Italy, and late in 1654 the increasing Savoyard hostility to the current French commander Grancey led to a search for a new allied commander-in-chief; the French would have preferred to send the Duke of York (later King James II); as he was unacceptable to Turin, Thomas Francis was appointed as joint commander, akthough his wife was held in France almost as a hostage for his good behaviour. On 16 December 1654, he arrived in Turin to a ceremonial welcome by the French troops and an unexpectedly friendly reception by Duke Charles Emmanuel. After the 1655 campaign, Thomas Francis returned to Turin where he died the following January.

==Second generation==
Among the children of Prince Thomas Francis and Marie de Bourbon-Soissons were:
*Princess Louise Christine (1627–1689), who married in 1654 to Ferdinand Maximilian of Baden-Baden (1625–1669).
*Emmanuel Philibert, 2nd Prince of Carignano, lived in Italy, becoming governor of Ivrea in 1644, and of Asti in 1663. In 1684, he married in Racconigi, Princess Angela Catherina d&#x27;Este (1656–1722), granddaughter of Cesare I d&#x27;Este, Duke of Modena. Because he was deaf-mute, the marriage shocked his mother, infuriated his sister-in-law Olympia Mancini, injured the inheritance prospects of his French nephews and nieces, and so offended Louis XIV that Francis II, Duke of Modena, felt obliged to banish from his realm the bride&#x27;s kinsman, who had acted as the couple&#x27;s intermediary. 
*Prince Eugène Maurice of Savoy (1635–1673), Count of Soissons and Dreux, married Olympia Mancini, most notorious of the Mazarinettes, &quot;intrigante&quot; of the &quot;affaire des posions&quot; and exiled in succession from both France and Spain. He also the progenitor of the House of Savoy-Soissons. This couple&#x27;s son, Prince Eugene of Savoy, spurned by France due to his mother&#x27;s disgrace when he sought to take up his place there as a &quot;prince étranger&quot; and military captain, defected to the service of the Holy Roman Emperor, where his generalship afflicted France for decades.

==Subsequent generations==
The subsequent Princes of Carignano, with their respective dates of tenure in brackets, were as follows:
*Emmanuel Philibert, Prince of Carignano (1656–1709), married Angélique Catherine d&#x27;Este.
*Victor Amadeus I, Prince of Carignano (1709–1741). married Maria Vittoria of Savoy, illegitimate daughter of Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia and his mistress Jeanne Baptiste d&#x27;Albert de Luynes .
*Louis Victor, Prince of Carignano (1741–1778), married Landgravine Christine of Hesse-Rotenburg.
*Victor Amadeus II, Prince of Carignano (1778–1780), married Joséphine of Lorraine.
*Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Carignano (1780–1800), married Princess Maria Christina of Saxony .
*Prince Charles Albert (1800–1831) married Maria Theresa of Tuscany and was the father of Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia and Italy and Ferdinand, Duke of Genoa, who succeeded as King of Sardinia in 1831.

<text>Thomas Francis of Savoy, 1st Prince of Carignano (; ; 21 December 1596 – 22 January 1656) was an Italian military commander and the founder of the Carignano branch of the House of Savoy, which reigned as kings of Piedmont–Sardinia from 1831 to 1861, and as kings of Italy from 1861 until the dynasty&#x27;s deposition in 1946.

==Background==
Born in Turin, Thomas was the youngest of the five legitimate sons of the sovereign Duke Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy by his consort Caterina Micaela of Austria, a daughter of King Philip II of Spain and the French princess Elisabeth of France. His mother died the following year. While still a young man, Thomas bore arms in the service of the king of Spain in Italy.

Although in previous reigns, younger sons had been granted rich appanages in Switzerland (Genevois, Vaud), Italy (Aosta), or France (Nemours, Bresse), the Savoy dukes found that this inhibited their own aggrandizement while encouraging intra-dynastic strife and regional secession. Not only did Thomas have older brothers, he was but one of the twenty-one acknowledged children of Charles Emmanuel. While only nine of these were legitimate, the others, being the widowed duke&#x27;s offspring by noble mistresses, appear to have been generously endowed or dowered during their father&#x27;s lifetime.

The fief of Carignano had belonged to the Savoys since 1418, and the fact that it was part of Piedmont, only twenty km. south of Turin, meant that it could be a &quot;princedom&quot; for Thomas in name only, being endowed neither with independence nor revenues of substance. Instead of receiving a significant patrimony, Thomas was wed in 1625 to Marie de Bourbon; she was sister to and co-heiress with Louis, Count of Soissons, who would be killed in 1641 while fomenting rebellion against Cardinal Richelieu.

==France==
In anticipation of this inheritance Thomas and Marie did not establish themselves at his brother&#x27;s capital, Turin, but dwelt in Paris, where Marie enjoyed the exalted rank of a &quot;princess du sang&quot;, being a second cousin of King Louis XIII. It was arranged that Thomas, as son of a reigning monarch, would hold the rank of first among the &quot;princes étrangers&quot; at the French court—taking precedence even before the formerly all-powerful House of Guise, whose kinship to the sovereign Duke of Lorraine was more remote. He was appointed &quot;Grand Maître&quot; of the king&#x27;s household, briefly replacing the traitorous &quot;Grand Condé&quot;. He engaged the services of the distinguished grammarian and courtier Claude Favre de Vaugelas as tutor for his children.

The prospect of Marie&#x27;s eventual succession to the Swiss principality of Neuchâtel, near Savoy, was foiled in 1643 by the king&#x27;s decision to legitimate Louis Henri de Bourbon, &quot;chevalier&quot; de Soissons (1640–1703), a son of Marie&#x27;s late brother. This prevented the substitution of Savoyard for French influence in that region, but left Thomas with little more than the empty title of &quot;prince de Carignano&quot;. Marie did eventually inherit her brother&#x27;s main holding in France, the county of Soissons, but this would be established as a secundogeniture for the French branch of the family. After Thomas, the senior branch of his descendants repatriated to Savoy, alternately marrying French, Italian and German princesses.

==Public career==

===Early actions and service with Spain===
Thomas&#x27; first recorded service is as a commander in the Piedmontese army under his father in the war against France in 1630 (see War of the Mantuan Succession). It was probably around this time that he first encountered Mazarin, who (though his public position was quite complex) was during 1630-32 in effect a French agent at the Piedmontese court. When the new Duke Victor Amadeus I was forced to accept a French occupation of Pinerolo (Peace of Cherasco, 26 April 1631, and associated secret agreements, implemented 1632), there was widespread dissatisfaction in Piedmont, and Thomas, with his brother Maurice, went to join the Spanish, at which Victor Amadeus confiscated their revenues. (The exact date of the move is unstated, but was probably 1632, certainly no later than 1634.) Though welcomed by the Spanish given that he was related to both the French and Spanish royal families, Thomas was not entirely trusted by them, and had to send his wife and children to Madrid as hostages.

Spain, during the burst of confidence after its unexpected great victory at Nordlingen in 1634, made plans for major operations in Germany to end the war against the Protestants there and in the Netherlands; these plans included Thomas leading an army in Westphalia, under the overall command of the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand, brother of Philip IV. Nothing came of this, but in 1635, when France declared war on Spain (Franco-Spanish war of 1635-59), Thomas served under Ferdinand in the Spanish Netherlands: he was given command of a small army (variously given as 8,500 or 13,000) sent against French forces that had advanced into Luxemburg, his orders either to observe them or to prevent them from joining up with a Dutch army. On 22 May 1635 at Les Avins, south of Huy, in what was then the bishopric of Liège, he was defeated by the French army commanded by Breezé and Chatillon. He managed to rally the remnants at Namur, then retreated before the numerically-superior French and Dutch forces; and he probably served the rest of the campaign with Ferdinand. Late in the year, the refugee Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine arrived in Brussels and met Thomas; they may have formed a joint court, and Thomas certainly participated in jousts organised by the Duke. (In this Franco-Spanish war, Piedmont was reluctantly dragged into the fighting alongside the French, though initially it avoided a full declaration of war; consequently, Thomas was technically fighting against his own homeland.)

In 1636, the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand organised a joint Spanish-Imperialist army for a major invasion of France from the Spanish Netherlands, and Thomas was initially in charge, defeating the French army commanded by Soisons, at the Somme, though Ferdinand soon took over supreme command. The invasion was initially very successful, and seemed capable of reaching Paris, where there was a great panic; if Ferdinand and Thomas had pushed on, they might have ended the war at this point, but they both felt that continuing to Paris was too risky, so they stopped the advance. Later in the campaign, Thomas had problems with the Imperialist general Ottavio Piccolomini, who refused to accept orders from the Prince as a Spanish commander, arguing that his Imperialist troops were an independent force. Military action for Thomas is not recorded in 1637, but in this year, when his brother-in-law Soissons fled from France after his failed conspiracy against Cardinal Richelieu, he acted as intermediary between Soissons and the Spanish in negotiations which led to a formal alliance between the count and Philip IV of Spain concluded 28 June 1637 - although within a month Soissons had reconciled with France! In 1638, Thomas served in Spanish Flanders, helping to defend the fortress-city of Saint-Omer against a French siege; in mid-June, he managed to get reinforcements into the place, then with the rest of his small army entrenched about 15 km. to the north-west at Ruminghem, opposite the French army under Jacques-Nompar de Caumont, duke of La Force at Zouafques; after being joined by Imperialist reinforcements under Ottavio Piccolomini, he marched to attack La Force, and was defeated with the loss of 2,000 men killed or captured (action at Zouafques, exact date unknown but around 21 June). However, he then marched back with his remaining troops to the continuing French siege of Saint-Omer, where he put in more reinforcements and then entrenched himself so securely in the vicinity that the French found it impossible to continue the siege and gave up. Thomas and Piccolimini subsequently stuck so close to La Force that the French were unable to undertake any serious operations.

===Piedmontese Civil War===
After seeking Spanish support late in 1638 for action against Regent Christine Marie, &quot;Madame Royale&quot;, Thomas went to Spanish Milan early in 1639, and alongside Spanish forces invaded Piedmont, where many towns welcomed him. He took Turin by trickery, but the French continued to control its citadel. In 1640, he held the city in the multi-layered siege of Turin. After repeated bouts of negotiations with the Regent and the French, Thomas made peace with both in the first half of 1642, and unblushingly changed sides and started fighting with the French against the Spaniards.

===Service with France===
For the rest of 1642 and part of the 1643 campaigns, Thomas commanded Piedmontese forces fighting alongside the French under Henri d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Longueville against the Spanish, generally along the Piedmont/Milan border; when Longueville was recalled home, Thomas succeeded him as allied commander-in-chief, with Turenne as his second-in-command. (Thomas was given the supreme command only because of his birth; another French general, Du Plessis Praslin, noted a few years later that French marshals would only serve under someone who was superior to them in social rank, and Thomas, with his blood relationship to the French and Spanish royal families, was the only candidate.) By late summer, both Thomas and Turenne were seriously ill and Du Plessis Praslin was in temporary command. Thomas led the joint armies again in 1644, taking Santya and Asti; he also tried to take Finale Ligure, but gave up the attempt, apparently because he feared this valuable port would end up in French control rather than Piedmontese. In 1645, now commanding with Du Plessis Praslin, he took Vigevano, and repulsed a Spanish attempt to block his withdrawal at the River Mora, the nearest he ever came to a success in the field. In 1646, Thomas was put in command of the French expedition sent south to take the Tuscan forts, after which he was to advance further south to Naples, drive out the Spanish and put himself on the throne of the kingdom; but the expedition set off late, and when he besieged Orbetello, the supporting French fleet was defeated by the Spanish and he was forced to raise the siege and conduct a difficult retreat, which he performed so poorly that Cardinal Mazarin subsequently despised his command ability, viewed him as incompetent, and declined to appoint him to the expedition that France sent to support the Naples revolt late in 1647 (this did not stop Mazarin from considering him as a potential candidate for a French-backed King of Naples, though Paris was so slow to move on this that Henry II, Duke of Guise was adopted by the Neapolitans instead). In the 1647 campaign, Thomas is mentioned as commanding alongside the French general in the forces sent across north Italy to work with the Duke of Modena Francesco I d&#x27;Este who had just allied with France and opened up a &#x27;second front&#x27; against the Spaniards in Milan, though Mazarin confessed that he had appointed Thomas only because he feared that, if left behind in Piedmont, the Prince&#x27;s restless spirit would make more trouble. By spring of 1648 however he was back in Piedmont, fighting on the Piedmont-Milan border to distract the Spanish from their pressure on Modena; in the summer, he was put in charge of an army sent on a fleet to Naples - the Naples revolt had already collapsed by then, so the expedition found no support when it landed and after some pointless actions it re-embarked, a complete failure (some details in Naples revolt). On his return with the French fleet, Thomas was delayed in Provence and unable to join the great siege of Cremona where he was expected.

During his absence, Regent Christine had gained control of the fortresses granted to Thomas as part of the settlement of the Piedmontese Civil War (legally, these reverted to ducal control when the Duke came of age), which under Piedmontese law Charles Emmanuel did in 1648, though his mother remained in control of the government; Christine, accompanied by her son and part of the ducal army, entered Ivrea and dismissed Thomas&#x27; personal garrison; she appointed Thomas instead as governor or Asti and Alba, positions which sweetened the blow but were entirely under ducal control, not guaranteed by treaty. When he returned to Piedmont, Thomas had no choice but to accept the fait accompli, and soon after this he went to live in Paris.

During the Fronde, Thomas linked himself closely with Cardinal Mazarin, who, although effectively prime minister of France, was like him an Italian outsider at the French court. In the early 1650s, Thomas was seen as an important member of Mazarin&#x27;s party, closely linked to the Cardinal, regularly seen in conference with him, and active in his support. In 1651 when Mazarin had been forced into exile, the Prince was for a time brought onto the conseil du roi, and an (admittedly very hostile) contemporary the duchesse de Nemours described him as a &#x27;prime minister without being aware of it&#x27;; there were suggestions that Mazarin&#x27;s opponents within the court had raised him up as a rival to the cardinal with the Queen, but this is unlikely, especially since Mazarin himself urged the Queen to follow Thomas&#x27; advice, and it is more probable that Mazarin backed the Prince as someone who would keep other rivals from gaining control in his absence but who would never have the status within France to set himself up as a permanent replacement for the Cardinal. By the time Mazarin returned from his second and last exile in February 1653, Thomas, who accompanied the court to St Denis to welcome the Cardinal home, was insignificant again - an analysis of Mazarin&#x27;s close colleagues at this time by the later historian Chéruel made no mention of him. In January 1654, when the last of the ceremonial offices formerly belonging to the rebel leader Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé were disposed of, Prince Thomas was made Grand Maitre.

The Franco-Spanish war had been continuing in north Italy, and late in 1654, increasing Piedmontese hostility to the current French commander Grancey led to a search for a new allied commander-in-chief; the French would have preferred to send the Duke of York (later King James II), but he too was unacceptable to Turin, so Thomas was appointed as joint commander - though his wife was held in France almost as a hostage for his good behaviour. On 16 December 1654 he arrived in Turin, to a ceremonial welcome by the French troops and an unexpectedly friendly reception by Charles Emmanuel. On 4 April 1655 Thomas Francis commanded the Waldensians to attend Mass or remove to the upper valleys, giving them twenty days in which to sell their lands. The Duke of Savoy sent an army and on 24 April, at 4 a.m., the signal was given for a general massacre so brutal, that it aroused indignation throughout Europe. Oliver Cromwell began petitioning on behalf of the Vaudois, and John Milton wrote his famous poem about this, &quot;On the Late Massacre in Piedmont.&quot; In the 1655 campaign, he led an invasion of the Duchy of Milan, though already ill with malaria, and besieged Pavia, where the attack went so badly that he was forced to leave his sick-bed to take direct control of the siege, and even then it had to be raised after nearly two months of fruitless effort.

==Death==
After the 1655 campaign, Thomas returned to Turin where he died the following January; the suggestion in Spanheim that he died &quot;at&quot; the siege of Pavia is not supported - malaria, a common problem in the marshes of the Po valley, carried him off, as it carried off his successor as allied commander-in-chief, Francesco I d&#x27;Este.

==Family==
Thomas and Marie de Bourbon had seven children (Italian names in parentheses):

# Princess Christine Charlotte of Savoy (27 April 1626 - 22 October 1626) died in infancy.
# Princess Louise Christine of Savoy (1627–1689), married in 1654 to Ferdinand Maximilian of Baden-Baden (1625–1669)
# Prince Emmanuel Philibert Amadeus of Savoy (Emanuele Filiberto Amedeo) (1628–1709), 2nd Prince of Carignano; he lived in Italy, becoming governor of Ivrea in 1644 and of Asti in 1663. At Racconigi in 1684, he married Princess Maria Angela Caterina d&#x27;Este (1656–1722), granddaughter of Cesare I d&#x27;Este, Duke of Modena. Since he was deaf-mute, the marriage shocked his mother, infuriated his sister-in-law Olympia Mancini, injured the inheritance prospects of his French nephews and nieces, and so offended Louis XIV that Francis II, Duke of Modena felt obliged to banish from his realm the bride&#x27;s kinsman, who had acted as the couple&#x27;s intermediary.
# Prince Amedeo of Savoy (12 May 1629 - 2 October 1629) died in infancy.
# Prince Joseph Emmanuel of Savoy (24 June 1631 – 5 January 1656), Count of Soissons, died aged 24. Never married or had children.
# Prince Eugene Maurice of Savoy (1635–1673), Count of Soissons and Count of Dreux, married Olympia Mancini
# Prince Ferdinand of Savoy (15 November 1637 - 29 November 1637), died young.

<text>In Norse mythology, Eir (Old Norse: , &quot;protection, help, mercy&quot;) is a goddess or valkyrie associated with medical skill. Eir is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry, including a runic inscription from Bergen, Norway from around 1300. Scholars have theorized about whether these three sources refer to the same figure, and debate whether Eir may have been originally a healing goddess or a valkyrie. In addition, Eir has been compared to the Greek goddess Hygieia.

==Attestations==

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;, the watchman Fjölsviðr presents a list of the maidens that attend the lady of the keep—Menglöð—that includes Eir, and states that they all sit on the hill Lyfjaberg (Old Norse &quot;hill of healing&quot; or &quot;healing mountain&quot;). The exchange between the hero Svipdagr and Fjölsviðr mentioning Eir is as follows:

After the exchange, Svipdagr asks if these figures will give aid if blót are made to them. Fjölsviðr responds that Svipdagr is correct:


===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
In chapter 35 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the enthroned figure of High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur. High lists Eir third, and says no more about her other than noting that &quot;she is an extremely good physician.&quot; In chapter 75 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; Eir appears within a list of valkyrie names, but Eir is not included in the list of ásynjur in the same chapter.

===Skaldic poetry and runic inscription===
In skaldic poetry, the name Eir is frequent in kennings for women. A sample construction is &quot;Eir aura&quot; (&quot;Eir of riches&quot;), occurring in &quot;Gísla saga&quot;. The name is already used in this way by the 10th century poets Kormákr Ögmundarson and Hallfreðr vandræðaskáld. Similarly, the name Eir is used in a woman kenning in a runic inscription inscribed on a stick from Bergen, Norway around the year 1300. The stick records a common mercantile transaction followed by a verse from a displeased scribe (edits applied per the translator&#x27;s notes):

:&#x27;Wise Var of wire [&quot;woman of filigree,&quot; meaning &quot;wise bejeweled woman&quot;] makes (me) sit unhappy.
:Eir [woman] of mackerels&#x27; ground [likely gold] takes often and much sleep from me.&#x27;

Mindy Macleod and Bernard Mees posit that the first line of the inscription essentially means &quot;women make me miserable&quot; or potentially &quot;marriage makes me miserable,&quot; whereas the second line means &quot;women often take a lot of sleep from me.&quot;

The name remained frequently used in woman kennings in rímur poetry.

==Theories==
Regarding the seemingly three different, seemingly conflicting, mentions of Eir, Andy Orchard says that the etymology of the name &quot;Eir&quot; may appear to fit the role of Eir as a goddess and servant of Menglöð best, but that one should consider that the valkyries also have the ability to waken the dead. John Lindow is skeptical of there having been a belief in Eir as a goddess, stating that &quot;whether we should trust Snorri and imagine the existence of a goddess Eir is problematic&quot;. Rudolf Simek says that Eir may originally have been simply a valkyrie rather than a goddess, and lists the servant of Menglöð by the same name as a separate figure.

Hilda Ellis Davidson comments that &quot;virtually nothing&quot; is known about Eir outside of her association with healing, and points out that she is &quot;singled out as one of the Norns who shape the lives of children&quot;. Davidson adds that &quot;no satisfactory conclusions&quot; have been drawn from her name, and considers all mentions of Eir as of the same figure. Davidson says that, in reference to Eir&#x27;s appearance among Menglöð&#x27;s maidens, that the names of these maidens &quot;suggest that they are guardian spirits, and [they are] said to &#x27;shelter and save&#x27; those who make offerings of them. They could be akin to protective spirits of the house, guarding both men and women.&quot; She additionally draws a link between these spirits and Lyfjaberg:

Lyfjaberg is where the goddess sits surrounded by her helpful spirits. Although healing by a goddess—or indeed by a god either—has left little mark on Norse myths as they have come down to us, there is no doubt that the healing power of goddesses was of enormous importance in daily life in the pre-Christian period, as was that of many women saints in Christian times. The goddess who presided over childbirth was held to possess power over life and death, and was revered as a lifegiver, both in the family home and in the courts of kings, though she might also pass sentence of death.

Henry Adams Bellows proposes a relationship between Eir and the place name &quot;Lyfjaberg&quot;, which he translates as &quot;hill of healing&quot;. Bellows notes that manuscripts vary about the spelling of the place name, and that he, like others, has followed 19th-century scholar Sophus Bugge&#x27;s choice. Bellows states that the stanza mentioning Lyfjaberg &quot;implies that Mengloth is a goddess of healing, and hence, perhaps an hypostasis of Frigg, as already intimated by her name [...]. In stanza 54, Eir appears as one of Mengloth&#x27;s handmaidens, and Eir, according to Snorri (&quot;Gylfaginning, 35&quot;) is herself the Norse Hygeia. Compare this stanza to stanza 32.&quot;

<doc id="69593" wikidata="Q2997596" url="?curid=69593" title="Economy of the Gambia">
<text>The economy of the Gambia is heavily reliant on agriculture. The Gambia has no significant mineral or other natural resources, and has a limited agricultural base. About 75% of the population depends on crops and livestock for its livelihood. Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of peanuts, fish, and animal hides.

Short-run economic progress remains highly dependent on foreign aid, and on responsible government economic management as forwarded by International Monetary Fund technical help and advice.

== Economic history ==
Current GDP per capita of the Gambia registered a peak growth of 23.3% in the 1970s. Economic growth slowed by 8.30% in the 1980s and a further 5.20% in the 1990s.

Re-export trade normally constitutes a major segment of economic activity, but the 50% devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 made Senegalese goods more competitive and hurt the re-export trade. The Gambia has benefited from a rebound in tourism after its decline in response to the military&#x27;s takeover in July 1994. Lately, Indian global health expert Dr Edmond Fernandes stated that Gambia presents a global investment opportunity and dissected various areas of business interests.

==Macro-economic trend==
This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Gambia at market prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of Dalasi (currency used in Gambia).
For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar is exchanged at 4.35 Dalasi only.

The Gambia&#x27;s economy is characterized by traditional subsistence agriculture, a historic reliance on peanuts or groundnuts for export earnings, a re-export trade built up around its ocean port, low import duties, minimal administrative procedures, a fluctuating exchange rate with no exchange controls, and a significant tourism industry. Average wages in 2007 hover around $1–2 per day.

== Economic sectors ==

=== Agriculture ===

Agriculture accounts for 23% of gross domestic product (GDP) and employs 75% of the labor force. Within agriculture, peanut production accounts for 5.3% of GDP, other crops 8.3%, livestock 4.4%, fishing 1.8%, and forestry 0.5%.

=== Industry ===
Industry accounts for 12% of GDP. Manufacturing accounts for 6% of GDP. The limited amount of manufacturing is primarily agriculturally based (e.g., peanut processing, bakeries, a brewery, and a tannery). Other manufacturing activities include soap, soft drinks, and clothing. Services account for 19% of GDP.

=== Tourism ===
Tourism in Gambia has three major strands. There is the traditional sun seeking holiday making use of the hot climate and wonderful beaches. The Gambia is also usually the first African destination for many European birders, due to its easily accessed and spectacular avian fauna. There are also a significant number of African Americans tracing their roots in this country, from which many Africans were taken during the slave trade. While not that many American slaves came from Gambia it was made popular by Alex Haleys historic novel and TV miniseries 

The tourist season is the dry season, during the Northern Hemisphere winter.

== Trade ==
In 2020 The Gambia&#x27;s major export markets were Senegal, Mali, Guinea-Bissau, India and China, accounting for 84% of all exports. Neighboring Senegal accounted for 50.5% of exports. This contrasted with 1999 when the UK and other EU countries were The Gambia&#x27;s major domestic export markets, accounting for 86% of all exports.

In 2020 Norway, China, Cote d&#x27;Ivoire, Brazil and Turkey were the major sources of imports, accounting for 49% of the total. This contrasted with 1999 when the UK and other EU countries were the major sources of imports, accounting for 60% of all imports.

<doc id="69594" wikidata="Q444189" url="?curid=69594" title="Charles III, Duke of Savoy">
<text>Charles III of Savoy (10 October 1486 – 17 August 1553), often called Charles the Good, was Duke of Savoy from 1504 to 1553, although most of his lands were ruled by the French between 1536 and his death. Ruling for nearly 49 years, he is the third longest reigning Savoyard monarch, behind Charles Emmanuel I and Victor Amadeus II.

== Biography ==

He was a younger son of Philip (Filippo) the Landless, an aged younger son of the ducal family, and his second wife Claudine de Brosse of the family that unsuccessfully claimed the Duchy of Brittany. His grandparents were Duke Louis of Savoy and Anne of Cyprus. As a child, there were next to no expectations for him to succeed to any monarchy. He was christened as a namesake of the then-reigning Duke, Charles I of Savoy, the Warrior, his first cousin.
However, when he was ten years old, his father unexpectedly succeeded his grandnephew Charles II of Savoy as duke and head of the Savoy dynasty, which had now also received the titles of the kingdoms of Cyprus, Jerusalem and Armenia. However, Charles&#x27;s father was not the heir general of the deceased duke, only the male heir. Jerusalem, Cyprus and certain other claims and possessions could go to a different heir, and they did, in principle, going to Charles II&#x27;s sister Yolande Louise. Charles&#x27;s father was not ready to relinquish those, and he took such titles to his own titulary, staking a claim. He also had Yolande marry his son, Philibert the Handsome, in 1496, to ensure the male line of succession.

In 1497, Charles&#x27;s half-brother Philibert succeeded their father as Duke of Savoy, etc. Philibert however died childless in 1504, surprisingly, and now Charles succeeded, at age eighteen.

Charles faced down challenges to his authority, including from Philibert Berthelier.

After Yolande&#x27;s death in 1499, the &quot;de jure&quot; rights of Jerusalem and Cyprus were lost to the Savoy family. Charles however, as some sort of heir-male, took those titles, which his successors also used. In 1713, Charles&#x27;s great-great-great-grandson Victor Amadeus II of Savoy received confirmation to that title from the Kings of Spain and France, who also claimed it. The rights, according to succession of heirs general, i.e. not excluding female lines, had gone, until Charles&#x27;s death, to the House of La Trémoille, the French lords of La Tremoille, Princes of Talmond and Taranto.

In response to the riots between Catholic and Protestants within Geneva, Charles launched a surprise attack in July 1534, but his army was beaten back. A second siege in October 1535 was attempted, and again Charles&#x27;s army was defeated when forces from Berne arrived to assist Geneva. Charles was allied with the Habsburg camp in Western European politics, where Francis I of France and Emperor Charles V battled for ascendancy. France invaded Savoy in 1536, and held almost all of Charles&#x27;s possessions. He spent the rest of his life practically in exile, at the mercy of relatives. He died in 1553 and was succeeded by his only surviving child, Emanuele Filiberto.

He was the duke who imprisoned François Bonivard, the &quot;prisoner of Chillon&quot; in 1530.

== Issue ==

Charles married the rich, beautiful and ambitious Infanta Beatrice of Portugal (1504–1538), daughter of the richest monarch in Europe at the time, Manuel I of Portugal, and Maria of Aragon. Beatrice was both first cousin and sister-in-law of Emperor Charles V. They had nine children, but only one child, Emmanuel Philibert, would reach adulthood:

* Adriano Giordano Amadeo, Prince of Piedmont (19 November 1522 – 10 January 1523)
* Ludovico, Prince of Piedmont (4 December 1523 – 25 November 1536)
* Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy (8 July 1528 – 30 August 1580), married Marguerite, Duchess of Berry, sister of Henri II, King of France
* Caterina (25 November 1529 – May 1536)
* Maria (12 June 1530 – 1531)
* Isabella (May 1532 – 24 September 1533)
* Emanuele (May 1533; died young)
* Emanuele (May 1534; died young)
* Gianmaria (3 December 1537 – 8 January 1538)

<doc id="69595" wikidata="Q1154671" url="?curid=69595" title="Politics of the Gambia">
<text>Politics of The Gambia takes place within the framework of a presidential republic, whereby the President of The Gambia is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliaments.

The 1970 constitution of The Gambia, which divided the government into independent executive, legislative, and judicial branches, was suspended after the 1994 military coup. As part of the transition process, the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC) established the Constitution Review Commission (CRC) through decree in March 1995. In accordance with the timetable for the transition to a democratically elected government, the commission drafted a new constitution for The Gambia which was approved by referendum in August 1996. The constitution provides for a presidential system, a unicameral legislature, an independent judiciary, and the protection of human rights.

Historically, The Gambia was one of Africa&#x27;s most stable democracies. The 1994 military coup led to the semi-authoritarian regime of Yahya Jammeh who held power until he was defeated at the ballot box in 2016–2017. 

==Political conditions==

Before the coup d&#x27;état in July 1994, The Gambia was one of the oldest existing multi-party democracies in Africa. It had conducted freely contested elections every 5 years since independence. The coup led to the start of the semi-authoritarian Yahya Jammeh regime After the military coup, politicians from deposed President Jawara&#x27;s People&#x27;s Progressive Party (PPP) and other senior government officials were banned from participating in politics until July 2001. 

The People&#x27;s Progressive Party (PPP) project preparation plan, headed by former president Jawara, had dominated Gambian politics for nearly 30 years. The last elections under the PPP regime were held in April 1992.

Following the coup, a presidential election took place in September 1996, in which retired Col. Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh won 56% of the vote. The legislative elections held in January 1997 were dominated by the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC, the new incarnation of AFPRC), which captured 33 out of 45 seats. In July 2001, the ban on Jawara-era political parties and politicians was lifted. Four registered opposition parties participated in the 18 October 2001 presidential election, which the incumbent, President Yahya Jammeh, won with almost 53% of the votes. The APRC maintained its strong majority in the National Assembly in legislative elections held in January 2002, particularly after the main opposition United Democratic Party (UDP) boycotted the legislative elections.

In 2005 the political scenario was changed, as five opposition parties united under the umbrella of the National Alliance for Democracy and Development (NADD). NADD thus represented virtually all political opposition forces in the country. Following the registration of NADD, the High Court ruled that dual party membership was unconstitutional, and as NADD had been registered as a political party all four opposition MPs were dismissed from the National Assembly. By-elections were held on 29 September, in which NADD retained three of the four seats. On 15 November the same year, three high-ranking NADD leaders (including the Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly, Halifa Sallah) were arrested on the grounds of subversion.

On 21 and 22 March 2006, amid tensions preceding the 2006 presidential elections, an alleged planned military coup was uncovered. President Yahya Jammeh was forced to return from a trip to Mauritania, many suspected army officials were arrested, and prominent army officials, including the army chief of staff, fled the country.
There are claims circulating that this whole event was fabricated by the President incumbent for his own devious purposes—however, the veracity of these claims is not known, as no corroborating evidence has as yet been brought forward. It is doubtful whether the full truth will ever be known, however, as anyone with any evidence would not be likely to come forward with it in light of the poor human rights record of the National Intelligence Agency, and their well-known penchant for torturing and detaining indefinitely anyone who speaks up against the Government.

The next presidential election took place on 22 September 2006. The nominations for party presidential candidates were held on 28 August 2006, amid reports of the Government intimidating and unfairly detaining Opposition members and sympathisers, and of using the machinery of state (including the national media arm of the Government, GRTS), to gain an unfair advantage during political campaigns. These reports follow a widely publicised signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and Opposition parties, initiated by the Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo during a recent visit to the country. Incumbent president, Yahya Jammeh, was reelected.

On 31 December 2014, a coup was attempted when a military deserter along with supporters attacked the presidential palace. The coup failed and the alleged ringleader, Lamin Sanneh, was amongst those killed by forces loyal to Jammeh.

Following the 1 December 2016 elections, the elections commission declared Adama Barrow as the elected president who won the presidential election to take over the Nation from the former president. Jammeh, who had ruled for 22 years, first announced he would step down after losing the 2016 election before declaring the results void and calling for a new vote, sparking a constitutional crisis and leading to an invasion by an ECOWAS coalition. On 20 January 2017, Jammeh announced that he had agreed to step down and would leave the country allowing Barrow to take up office.
On 4 December 2021, Gambian President Adama Barrow won re-election in the presidential election. Opposition candidates rejected the results because of unspecified irregularities.

==Executive branch==


|President
|Adama Barrow
|Independent
|19 January 2017
|Vice-President
|Muhammad B.S. Jallow
|Independent
|15 March 2019
 
The President is elected by popular vote for a five-year term; the number of terms is not restricted. The President appoints the members of the Cabinet.

==Legislative branch==

The National Assembly has 53 members, 48 members elected for a five-year term, and 4 members appointed.
The Gambia was effectively a one party dominant state when the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction was in power. Opposition parties were allowed but were widely considered to have no real chance of gaining power.

==Judicial branch==

Supreme Court of the Gambia (since 1998).

Until 1998, there was a right of appeal from the Court of Appeal of The Gambia to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London.

The last case from The Gambia to be decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was &#x27;West Coast Air Limited v. Gambia Civil Aviation Authority and Others U.K.P.C. 39 (15 September 1998). West Coast Air Limited contested the Gambia Civil Aviation Authority&#x27;s rulings in this matter, claiming that several of the decisions were illegal and harmful to their company&#x27;s operations. A pivotal point in The Gambia&#x27;s legal history occurred before the nation eliminated appeals to the Privy Council when the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which at the time was the country&#x27;s highest court of appeal, rendered a decision on the case. This case emphasizes the intricate relationship that exists between corporate interests and regulatory bodies, as well as the value of judicial supervision in guaranteeing the impartiality and constitutionality of administrative decisions.

Local government in The Gambia varies. The capital city, Banjul, has an elected town council. Five rural divisions exist (Lower River, Central River, North Bank, Upper River, Western), each with a council containing a majority of elected members. Each council has its own treasury and is responsible for local government services. Tribal chiefs retain traditional powers authorised by customary law in some instances.

<text>The Pharisees (; ) were a Jewish social movement and school of thought in the Levant during the time of Second Temple Judaism. Following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD, Pharisaic beliefs became the foundational, liturgical, and ritualistic basis for Rabbinic Judaism. Although the group no longer exists, their traditions are of great importance for the manifold Jewish religious movements.

Conflicts between Pharisees and Sadducees took place in the context of much broader and longstanding social and religious conflicts amongst Jews (exacerbated by the Roman conquest). One conflict was cultural, between those who favored Hellenization (the Sadducees) and those who resisted it (the Pharisees). Another was juridical-religious, between those who emphasized the importance of the Temple with its rites and services, and those who emphasized the importance of other Mosaic Laws. A specifically religious point of conflict involved different interpretations of the Torah and how to apply it to Jewish life, with Sadducees recognizing only the written Torah and rejecting Prophets, Writings, and doctrines such as the Oral Torah and the resurrection of the dead.

Contemporary Jewish historian Josephus, believed by many historians to have been a Pharisee, estimate there were around 6,000 adherents to the Pharisee movement before the fall of the Second Temple. He claims that Pharisee influence over the common people was so great that anything they said against the king or the high priest was believed, apparently in contrast to the more elite Sadducees, who were the upper class. Pharisees claimed Mosaic authority for their interpretation of Jewish religious law, while Sadducees represented the authority of the priestly privileges and prerogatives established since the days of Solomon, when Zadok, their ancestor, officiated as high priest.

Pharisees are notable by the numerous references to them in the New Testament. Although the stance of &quot;the Pharisees&quot; towards Jesus was antagonistic, individual Pharisees who believed in him or his merits or both include Nicodemus (who said it is known that Jesus is a teacher sent from God), Joseph of Arimathea, an unknown number of &quot;those of the party of the Pharisees who believed,&quot; and the Apostle Paul, a student of Gamaliel who warned the Sanhedrin that opposing the disciples of Jesus could prove to be tantamount to opposing God.

==Etymology==
&quot;Pharisee&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek (), from Aramaic (), plural (), meaning &quot;set apart, separated,&quot; related to Hebrew (), plural (), the Qal passive participle of the verb (). It may refer to their separation from Gentiles, sources of ritual impurity, or from irreligious Jews.Alternatively, it may have a particular political meaning as &quot;separatists,&quot; due to their division from the Sadducee elite, with Yitzhak Isaac Halevi characterizing the Sadducees and Pharisees as political sects, not religious ones. Scholar Thomas Walter Manson and Talmud expert Louis Finkelstein suggest that &quot;Pharisee&quot; derives from the Aramaic words or , meaning &quot;Persian&quot; or &quot;Persianizer,&quot; based on the demonym , meaning &#x27;Persian&#x27; in the Persian language, and further akin to and . Harvard University scholar Shaye J. D. Cohen denies this, stating: &quot;Practically all scholars now agree that the name &quot;Pharisee&quot; derives from the Hebrew and Aramaic or .&quot;

== Sources ==
The first historical mention of the Pharisees and their beliefs comes in the four gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, in which both their meticulous adherence to their interpretation of the Torah as well as their eschatological views are described. A later historical mention of the Pharisees comes from the Jewish-Roman historian Josephus in a description of the &quot;four schools of thought,&quot; or &quot;four sects,&quot; into which he divides the Jews in the 1st century CE. (The other schools were the Essenes, who were generally apolitical, and may have emerged as a sect of dissident priests who rejected either the Seleucid-appointed or the Hasmonean high priests as illegitimate; the Sadducees, who were the main antagonists of the Pharisees; and the Zealots.) Other sects may have emerged at this time, such as the early Christians in Jerusalem and the Therapeutae in Egypt. However, their status as Jews is unclear.

The Books of the Maccabees—two deuterocanonical books in the Bible—focus on the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucids under King Antiochus IV Epiphanes, and concludes with the defeat of General Nicanor in 161 BCE by Judas Maccabeus, the hero of the work. It includes several theological points: prayer for the dead, the last judgment, intercession of saints, and martyrology. The New Testament apocrypha, known as the Gospel of Peter, also alludes to the Pharisees.

Judah ha-Nasi redacted the Mishnah, an authoritative codification of Pharisaic interpretations, around 200 CE. Most of the authorities quoted in the Mishnah lived after the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE; consequently, it marked the beginning of the transition from Pharisaic to Rabbinic Judaism. The Mishnah was important because it compiled the oral interpretations and traditions of the Pharisees (and later the rabbis) into a single authoritative text, thus allowing oral tradition within Judaism to survive the destruction of the Second Temple. However, none of the rabbinic sources include identifiable eyewitness accounts of the Pharisees and their teachings.

==History==
===From ===
The deportation and exile of an unknown number of Jews of the Kingdom of Judah to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar II—starting with the first deportation in 597 BCE, and continuing after the fall of Jerusalem and destruction of the Temple in 587 BCE—resulted in dramatic changes to Jewish culture and religion. During the 70-year exile in Babylon, Jewish houses of assembly (known in Hebrew as a , or in Greek as a &quot;synagogue&quot;) and houses of prayer (Hebrew ; Greek , ) were the primary meeting places for prayer, and the house of study () was the counterpart for the synagogue.

In 539 BCE, the Persians conquered Babylon, and in 537 BCE, Cyrus the Great allowed Jews to return to Judea and rebuild the Temple. He did not, however, allow the restoration of the Judean monarchy, which left the Judean priests as the dominant authority. Without the constraining power of the monarchy, the authority of the Temple in civic life was amplified. It was around this time that the Sadducee party emerged as the party of priests and allied elites. However, the Second Temple, which was completed in 515 BCE, had been constructed under the auspices of a foreign power, and there were lingering questions about its legitimacy. This provided the condition for the development of various sects or &quot;schools of thought,&quot; each of which claimed exclusive authority to represent &quot;Judaism,&quot; and which typically shunned social intercourse, especially marriage, with members of other sects. 

The Temple was no longer the only institution for Jewish religious life. After the building of the Second Temple in the time of Ezra, the houses of study and worship remained important secondary institutions in Jewish life. Outside Judea, the synagogue was often called a house of prayer. While most Jews could not regularly attend the Temple service, they could meet at the synagogue for morning, afternoon, and evening prayers. On Mondays, Thursdays, and Shabbat, a weekly Torah portion was read publicly in the synagogues, following the tradition of public Torah readings instituted by Ezra. Although priests controlled the rituals of the Temple, the scribes and sages, later called &quot;rabbis&quot; (Hebrew for &quot;Teacher/master&quot;), dominated the study of the Torah. These men maintained an oral tradition that they believed had originated at Mount Sinai alongside the Torah of Moses; a God-given interpretation of the Torah.

The Hellenistic period of Jewish history began when Alexander the Great conquered Persia in 332 BCE. The rift between the priests and the sages developed during this time, when Jews faced new political and cultural struggles. This created a sort of schism in the Jewish community. After Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BCE, Judea was ruled by the Egyptian-Hellenic Ptolemies until 198 BCE, when the Syrian-Hellenic Seleucid Empire, under Antiochus III, seized control. In 167 BCE, the Seleucid King Antiochus IV invaded Judea, entered the Temple, and stripped it of money and ceremonial objects. He imposed a program of forced Hellenization, requiring Jews to abandon their own laws and customs, thus precipitating the Maccabean Revolt. Jerusalem was liberated in 165 BCE, and the Temple was restored. In 141 BCE, an assembly of priests and others affirmed Simon Maccabeus as high priest and leader, in effect establishing the Hasmonean dynasty.

===Emergence of the Pharisees===

After defeating the Seleucid forces, Judas Maccabaeus&#x27;s nephew, John Hyrcanus, established a new monarchy in the form of the priestly Hasmonean dynasty in 152 BCE, thus establishing priests as both political and religious authorities. Although the Hasmoneans were considered heroes for resisting the Seleucids, their reign lacked the legitimacy conferred by descent from the Davidic dynasty of the First Temple era.

The Pharisees emerged largely out of the group of scribes and sages. Some scholars observe some Idumean influences in the development of Pharisaical Judaism. The Pharisees, among other Jewish sects, were active from the middle of the 2nd century BCE until the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE. Josephus first mentions them in connection with Jonathan Apphus, the successor of Judas Maccabeus. One of the factors that distinguished the Pharisees from other groups prior to the destruction of the Temple was their belief that all Jews had to observe the purity laws (which applied to the Temple service) outside the Temple. The major difference, however, was the continued adherence of the Pharisees to the laws and traditions of the Jewish people in the face of assimilation. As Josephus notes, the Pharisees were considered the most expert and accurate expositors of Jewish law.

Josephus indicates that the Pharisees received the backing and good-will of the common people, apparently in contrast to the more elite Sadducees associated with the ruling classes. In general, whereas the Sadducees were aristocratic monarchists, the Pharisees were eclectic, popular, and more democratic. The Pharisaic position is exemplified by the assertion that &quot;A learned takes precedence over an ignorant High Priest.&quot; (A —literally &quot;bastard,&quot; according to the Pharisaic definition—is an outcast child born of a forbidden relationship, such as adultery or incest, in which marriage of the parents could not lawfully occur. The word is often but incorrectly translated as &quot;illegitimate.&quot;)

Sadducees rejected the Pharisaic tenet of an Oral Torah, creating two Jewish understandings of the Torah. An example of this differing approach is the interpretation of &quot;an eye in place of an eye.&quot; The Pharisaic understanding was that the value of an eye was to be paid by the perpetrator. In the Sadducees&#x27; view, the words were given a more literal interpretation, in which the offender&#x27;s eye would be removed.

The sages of the Talmud saw a direct link between themselves and the Pharisees, and historians generally consider Pharisaic Judaism to be the progenitor of Rabbinic Judaism, that is normative, mainstream Judaism after the destruction of the Second Temple. All mainstream forms of Judaism today consider themselves heirs of Rabbinic Judaism and, ultimately, the Pharisees.

===Hasmonean period===

Although the Pharisees did not support the wars of expansion of the Hasmoneans and the forced conversions of the Idumeans, the political rift between them became wider when a Pharisee named Eleazar insulted the Hasmonean ethnarch John Hyrcanus at his own table, suggesting that he should abandon his role as High Priest due to a rumour (probably untrue) that he had been conceived while his mother was a prisoner of war. In response, he distanced himself from the Pharisees.

After the death of John Hyrcanus, his younger son, Alexander Jannaeus, made himself king, and openly sided with the Sadducees by adopting their rites in the Temple. His actions caused a riot in the Temple, and led to a brief civil war that ended with a bloody repression of the Pharisees. However, on his deathbed, Jannaeus advised his widow, Salome Alexandra, to seek reconciliation with the Pharisees. Her brother was Shimon ben Shetach, a leading Pharisee. Josephus attests that Salome was favorably inclined toward the Pharisees, and their political influence grew tremendously under her reign, especially in the Sanhedrin or Jewish Council, which they came to dominate.

Following Salome’s death, her elder son, Hyrcanus II, was generally supported by the Pharisees. Her younger son, Aristobulus II, was in conflict with Hyrcanus and tried to seize power. The Pharisees seemed to be in a vulnerable position at this time. The conflict between the two sons culminated in a civil war that ended when the Roman general Pompey intervened and captured Jerusalem in 63 BCE. Josephus&#x27; account may overstate the role of the Pharisees. He reports elsewhere that the Pharisees did not grow to power until the reign of Salome. As Josephus was a Pharisee, his account may represent a historical creation meant to elevate the status of the Pharisees during the height of the Hasmonean dynasty.

Later texts, like the Mishnah and the Talmud, record a host of rulings by rabbis, some of whom are believed to be from among the Pharisees, concerning sacrifices and other ritual practices in the Temple, torts, criminal law, and governance. In their day, the influence of the Pharisees over the lives of the common people was strong, and their rulings on Jewish law were deemed authoritative by many.

===Roman period===

According to Josephus, the Pharisees appeared before Pompey, asking him to interfere and restore the old priesthood, while abolishing the royalty of the Hasmoneans altogether. The Pharisees also opened Jerusalem&#x27;s gates to the Romans, and actively supported them against the Sadducean faction. When the Romans finally broke the entrance to Jerusalem&#x27;s Temple, the Pharisees killed the priests who were officiating the Temple services on Sabbath. They regarded Pompey&#x27;s defilement of the Temple in Jerusalem as a divine punishment of Sadducean misrule. Pompey ended the monarchy in 63 BCE, and named Hyrcanus II high priest and ethnarch (a lesser title than &quot;king&quot;). Six years later, Hyrcanus was deprived of the remainder of political authority, and ultimate jurisdiction was given to the proconsul of Syria, who ruled through Hyrcanus&#x27;s Idumaean associate, Antipater, and later, Antipater&#x27;s two sons, Phasael (military governor of Judea) and Herod (military governor of Galilee). In 40 BCE, Aristobulus&#x27;s son, Antigonus, overthrew Hyrcanus, and named himself king and high priest, whereafter Herod fled to Rome.

In Rome, Herod sought the support of Mark Antony and Octavian, and secured recognition by the Roman Senate as king, confirming the termination of the Hasmonean dynasty. According to Josephus, Sadducean opposition to Herod led him to treat the Pharisees favorably. Herod was an unpopular ruler, perceived as a Roman puppet. Despite his restoration and expansion of the Second Temple, Herod&#x27;s notorious treatment of his own family and of the last Hasmonaeans further eroded his popularity. According to Josephus, the Pharisees ultimately opposed him, and thus fell victims (4 BCE) to his bloodthirstiness. The family of Boethus, whom Herod had raised to the high-priesthood, revived the spirit of the Sadducees, and thenceforth the Pharisees again had them as antagonists.

While it stood, the Second Temple remained the center of Jewish ritual life. Jews were required to travel to Jerusalem and offer sacrifices at the Temple three times per year: Pesach (Passover), Shavuot (the Feast of Weeks), and Sukkot (the Feast of Tabernacles). The Pharisees, like the Sadducees, were politically quiescent, and studied, taught, and worshiped in their own way. At this time, serious theological differences emerged between the Sadducees and Pharisees. The notion that the sacred could exist outside the Temple, a view central to the Essenes, was shared and elevated by the Pharisees.

=== From Pharisees to rabbis ===
Following the Jewish–Roman wars, revolutionaries like the Zealots had been crushed by the Romans, and had little credibility (the last Zealots died at Masada in 73 CE). Similarly, the Sadducees, whose teachings were closely connected to the Temple, disappeared with the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. The Essenes also disappeared, perhaps because their teachings so diverged from the concerns of the times, or perhaps because they were sacked by the Romans at Qumran. Of all the major Second Temple sects, only the Pharisees remained. Their vision of Jewish law as a means by which ordinary people could engage with the sacred in their daily lives was a position meaningful to the majority of Jews. Such teachings extended beyond ritual practices. According to the classic midrash in &quot;Avot D&#x27;Rabbi Nathan&quot; (4:5):

Following the destruction of the Temple, Rome governed Judea through a procurator at Caesarea and a Jewish patriarch, and additionally levied the Fiscus Judaicus. Yohanan ben Zakkai, a leading Pharisee, was appointed the first patriarch (the Hebrew word &quot;nasi&quot; also means prince or president), and he reestablished the Sanhedrin at Yavneh (see the related Council of Jamnia) under Pharisee control. Instead of giving tithes to the priests and sacrificing offerings at the destroyed Temple, the rabbis instructed Jews to give charity. Moreover, they argued that all Jews should study in local synagogues, because the Torah is &quot;the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob&quot; (Deuteronomy 33:4).

After the destruction of the First Temple, Jews believed that God would forgive them and enable them to rebuild the Temple—an event that actually occurred within three generations. After the destruction of the Second Temple, Jews wondered whether this would happen again. When the Emperor Hadrian threatened to rebuild Jerusalem as a pagan city dedicated to Jupiter in 132 AD, some of the leading sages of the Sanhedrin supported a rebellion led by Simon Bar Kosiba (later known as Bar Kokhba), who established a short-lived independent state that was conquered by the Romans in 135 AD. With this defeat, the Jews&#x27; hopes that the Temple would be rebuilt were crushed. Nonetheless, belief in a Third Temple remains a cornerstone of Jewish belief.

Romans forbade Jews to enter Jerusalem (except for the day of Tisha B&#x27;Av), and prohibited any plan to rebuild the Temple. Instead, it took over the Province of Judea directly, renaming it Syria Palaestina, and renaming Jerusalem Aelia Capitolina. Romans did eventually reconstitute the Sanhedrin under the leadership of Judah haNasi (who claimed to be a descendant of King David). They conferred the title of &quot;nasi&quot; as hereditary, and Judah&#x27;s sons served both as patriarch and as heads of the Sanhedrin.

===Post-Temple developments===
According to historian Shaye Cohen, by the time three generations had passed after the destruction of the Second Temple, most Jews concluded that the Temple would not be rebuilt during their lives nor in the foreseeable future. Jews were now confronted with difficult and far-reaching questions:
* How to achieve atonement without the Temple?
* How to explain the disastrous outcome of the rebellion?
* How to live in the post-Temple, Romanized world?
* How to connect present and past traditions?
Regardless of the importance they gave to the Temple, and despite their support of Bar Koseba&#x27;s revolt, the Pharisees&#x27; vision of Jewish law as a means by which ordinary people could engage with the sacred in their daily lives provided them with a position from which to respond to all four challenges in a way meaningful to the vast majority of Jews. Their responses would constitute Rabbinic Judaism.

After the destruction of the Second Temple, the sectarian divisions ended. The rabbis avoided the term &quot;Pharisee,&quot; perhaps because it was a term more often used by non-Pharisees, but also because the term was explicitly sectarian. The rabbis claimed leadership over all Jews, and added to the Amidah the , a prayer which in part exclaims, &quot;Praised are You O Lord, who breaks enemies and defeats the wicked,&quot; and which is understood as a rejection of sectarians and sectarianism. This shift by no means resolved conflicts over the interpretation of the Torah; rather, it relocated debates between sects to debates within Rabbinic Judaism. The Pharisaic commitment to scholarly debate as a value in and of itself, rather than merely a byproduct of sectarianism, emerged as a defining feature of Rabbinic Judaism.

Thus, as the Pharisees argued that all Israel should act as priests, the rabbis argued that all Israel should act as rabbis: &quot;The rabbis furthermore want to transform the entire Jewish community into an academy where the whole Torah is studied and kept ... redemption depends on the &quot;rabbinization&quot; of all Israel, that is, upon the attainment of all Jewry of a full and complete embodiment of revelation or Torah, thus achieving a perfect replica of heaven.&quot; Rabbinic Judaism, at this time and afterwards, contained the idea of the Heavenly Academy, a heavenly institute where God taught scripture.

The rabbinic era is divided into two periods. The first period was that of the Tannaim (from the Aramaic word for &quot;repeat;&quot; the Aramaic root TNY is equivalent to the Hebrew root SNY, which is the basis for &quot;Mishnah.&quot; Thus, Tannaim are &quot;Mishnah teachers&quot;), the sages who repeated and thus passed down the Oral Torah. During this period, rabbis finalized the canonization of the Tanakh, and in 200 AD, Judah haNasi edited together Tannaitic judgements and traditions into the Mishnah, considered by the rabbis to be the definitive expression of the Oral Torah (although some of the sages mentioned in the Mishnah are Pharisees who lived prior to the destruction of the Second Temple, or prior to the Bar Kozeba revolt, most of the sages mentioned lived after the revolt).

The second period is that of the &quot;Amoraim&quot; (from the Aramaic word for &quot;speaker&quot;) rabbis and their students, who continued to debate legal matters and discuss the meaning of the books of the Bible. In Judea, these discussions occurred at academies at Tiberias, Caesarea, and Sepphoris. In Babylonia, these discussions largely occurred at academies that had been established at Nehardea, Pumpeditha, and Sura. This tradition of study and debate reached its fullest expression in the development of the Talmudim, elaborations of the Mishnah and records of Rabbinic debates, stories, and judgements, compiled around 400 AD in Judea and around 500 AD in Babylon.

Rabbinic Judaism eventually emerged as normative Judaism, and in fact, many today refer to Rabbinic Judaism simply as &quot;Judaism.&quot; Rabbinic scholar Jacob Neusner, however, stated that the Amoraim had no ultimate power in their communities. They lived at a time when Jews were subjects of either the Roman or Iranian (Parthian and Persian) empires. These empires left the day-to-day governance in the hands of the Jewish authorities: in Roman Palestine, through the hereditary office of patriarch (also simultaneously the head of the Sanhedrin); in Babylonia, through the hereditary office of the &quot;Reish Galuta&quot;, the &quot;Head of the Exile&quot; or &quot;Exilarch&quot; (who ratified the appointment of the heads of Rabbinical academies.) According to Jacob Neusner:

In Neusner&#x27;s view, the rabbinic project, as acted out in the Talmud, reflected not the world as it was, but the world as rabbis dreamed it should be.

According to historian Salo Baron, however, there existed &quot;a general willingness of the people to follow its self-imposed Rabbinic rulership.&quot; Although the rabbis lacked authority to impose capital punishment, &quot;Flagellation and heavy fines, combined with an extensive system of excommunication, were more than enough to uphold the authority of the courts.&quot; In fact, the rabbis took over more and more power from the Reish Galuta, until eventually, R&#x27; Ashi assumed the title rabbana, heretofore assumed by the exilarch, and appeared together with two other rabbis as an official delegation &quot;at the gate of King Yazdegard&#x27;s court.&quot; The Amorah (and Tanna) Rav was a personal friend of Parthian King Artabenus IV, and Shmuel was close to King Shapur I of Persia. Thus, the rabbis had significant means of &quot;coercion,&quot; and the people seemed to have followed the rabbinic rulership.

==Beliefs==
At first, the values of the Pharisees developed through their sectarian debates with the Sadducees; then, they developed through internal, non-sectarian debates over the law as an adaptation to life without the Temple, and life in exile, and eventually, to a more limited degree, life in conflict with Christianity. These shifts mark the transformation of Pharisaic to Rabbinic Judaism.

No single tractate of the key rabbinic texts, the Mishnah and the Talmud, is devoted to theological issues; these texts are concerned primarily with interpretations of Jewish law, and anecdotes about the sages and their values. Only one chapter of the Mishnah deals with theological issues; it asserts that three kinds of people will have no share in &quot;the world to come:&quot; those who deny the resurrection of the dead, those who deny the divinity of the Torah, and Epicureans (who deny divine supervision of human affairs). Another passage suggests a different set of core principles: normally, a Jew may violate any law to save a life, but in Sanhedrin 74a, a ruling orders Jews to accept martyrdom rather than violate the laws against idolatry, murder, or adultery. (Judah ha-Nasi, however, said that Jews must &quot;be meticulous in small religious duties as well as large ones, because you do not know what sort of reward is coming for any of the religious duties,&quot; suggesting that all laws are of equal importance).

=== Monotheism ===
One belief central to the Pharisees which was shared by all Jews of the time is monotheism. This is evident in the practice of reciting the , a prayer composed of select verses from the Torah (Deuteronomy 6:4), at the Temple and in synagogues; the begins with the verses, &quot;Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God; the Lord is one.&quot; According to the Mishna, these passages were recited in the Temple, along with the twice-daily offering; Jews in the diaspora, who did not have access to the Temple, recited these passages in their houses of assembly. According to the Mishnah and Talmud, the men of the Great Assembly instituted the requirement that Jews both in Judea and in the diaspora pray three times per day (morning, afternoon, and evening), and include in their prayers a recitation of these passages in the morning () and evening () prayers.

=== Wisdom ===
Pharisaic wisdom was compiled in one book of the Mishna, . The Pharisaic attitude is perhaps best exemplified by a story about the sages Hillel the Elder and Shammai, who both lived in the latter half of the 1st century BCE. A gentile once challenged Shammai to teach him the wisdom of the Torah while he stood on one foot. Shammai drove him away. The same gentile approached Hillel and asked of him the same thing. Hillel chastised him gently by saying, &quot;That which is hateful to you do not do to another; that is the entire Torah, and the rest is its interpretation. Go study.&quot;

=== Free will and predestination ===
According to Josephus, whereas the Sadducees believed that people have total free will and the Essenes believed that all of a person&#x27;s life is predestined, the Pharisees believed that people have free will, but that God also has foreknowledge of human destiny. This also accords with the statement in 3:19, &quot;Rabbi Akiva said: All is foreseen, but freedom of choice is given.&quot;

=== Afterlife ===

Unlike the Sadducees, who are generally held to have rejected any existence after death, the sources vary on the beliefs of the Pharisees on the afterlife. According to the New Testament, the Pharisees believed in the resurrection of the dead. According to Josephus, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal, and the souls of good people would be resurrected or reincarnated and &quot;pass into other bodies,&quot; while &quot;the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.&quot; Paul the Apostle declared himself to be a Pharisee, even after his belief in Jesus.

== Practices ==

=== A kingdom of priests ===
Fundamentally, the Pharisees continued a form of Judaism that extended beyond the Temple, applying Jewish law to mundane activities in order to sanctify the everyday world. This was monumental as a practice during this era, as it helped the Jews of the time to truly align themselves with the law, applying even to the mundanities of life. This was a more participatory (or &quot;democratic&quot;) form of Judaism, in which rituals were not monopolized by an inherited priesthood, but rather could be performed by all adult Jews individually or collectively, whose leaders were not determined by birth but by scholarly achievement.

Many, including some scholars, have characterized the Sadducees as a sect that interpreted the Torah literally, and the Pharisees as interpreting the Torah liberally. R&#x27; Yitzhak Isaac Halevi suggests that this was not, in fact, a matter of religion. He claims that the complete rejection of Judaism would not have been tolerated under the Hasmonean rule, and therefore Hellenists maintained that they were rejecting not Judaism but Rabbinic law. Thus, the Sadducees were in fact a political party, not a religious sect. However, according to Neusner, this view is a distortion. He suggests that two things fundamentally distinguished the Pharisaic from the Sadducean approach to the Torah. First, Pharisees believed in a broad and literal interpretation of Exodus (19:3–6), &quot;you shall be my own possession among all peoples; for all the earth is mine, and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation,&quot; and the words of 2 Maccabees (2:17): &quot;God gave all the people the heritage, the kingdom, the priesthood, and the holiness.&quot;

The Pharisees believed that the idea that all of the children of Israel were to be like priests was expressed elsewhere in the Torah, for example, when the Law was transferred from the sphere of the priesthood to every man in Israel. Moreover, the Torah already provided ways for all Jews to lead a priestly life: the laws of kosher animals were perhaps intended originally for the priests, but were extended to the whole people; similarly, the prohibition of cutting the flesh in mourning for the dead. The Pharisees believed that all Jews in their ordinary life, and not just the Temple priesthood or Jews visiting the Temple, should observe rules and rituals concerning purification.

=== Oral Torah ===
The standard view is that the Pharisees differed from Sadducees in the sense that they accepted the Oral Torah in addition to the Scripture. Theology professor Anthony J. Saldarini argued that this assumption has neither implicit nor explicit evidence. A critique of the ancient interpretations of the Bible are distant from what modern scholars consider literal. Saldarini stated that the Oral Torah did not come about until the 3rd century CE, although there was an unstated idea about it in existence. In a way, every Jewish community possessed their own version of the Oral Torah which governed their religious practices. Josephus states that the Sadducees only followed literal interpretations of the Torah. To Saldarini, this only meant that the Sadducees followed their own way of Judaism, and rejected the Pharisaic version of Judaism. To Rosemary Ruether, the Pharisaic proclamation of the Oral Torah was their way of freeing Judaism from the clutches of Aaronite priesthood, represented by the Sadducees. The Oral Torah was to remain oral but was later given a written form. It did not refer to the Torah in a status as a commentary, rather had its own separate existence which allowed Pharisaic innovations.

The sages of the Talmud believed that the Oral law was simultaneously revealed to Moses at Mount Sinai, and the product of debates among rabbis. Thus, one may conceive of the &quot;Oral Torah&quot; as both based on the fixed text and as an ongoing process of analysis and argument in which God is actively involved; it was this ongoing process that was revealed at Mount Sinai along with the scripture, and by participating in this ongoing process rabbis and their students are actively participating in God&#x27;s ongoing act of revelation.

As Neusner explains, the schools of the Pharisees and rabbis were and are holy:
&quot;...because there men achieve sainthood through study of Torah and imitation of the conduct of the masters. In doing so, they conform to the heavenly paradigm, the Torah believed to have been created by God &quot;in his image,&quot; revealed at Sinai, and handed down to their own teachers ... If the masters and disciples obey the divine teaching of Moses, &quot;our rabbi,&quot; then their society, the school, replicates on earth the heavenly academy, just as the disciple incarnates the heavenly model of Moses, &quot;our rabbi.&quot; The rabbis believe that Moses was (and the Messiah will be) a rabbi, God dons phylacteries, and the heavenly court studies Torah precisely as does the earthly one, even arguing about the same questions. These beliefs today may seem as projections of rabbinical values onto heaven, but the rabbis believe that they themselves are projections of heavenly values onto earth. The rabbis thus conceive that on earth they study Torah just as God, the angels, and Moses, &quot;our rabbi,&quot; do in heaven. The heavenly schoolmen are even aware of Babylonian scholastic discussions, so they require a rabbi&#x27;s information about an aspect of purity taboos.

The commitment to relate religion to daily life through the law has led some (notably, Saint Paul and Martin Luther) to infer that the Pharisees were more legalistic than other sects in the Second Temple Era. The authors of the Gospels present Jesus as speaking harshly against some Pharisees (Josephus does claim that the Pharisees were the &quot;strictest&quot; observers of the law). Yet, as Neusner has observed, Pharisaism was but one of many &quot;Judaisms&quot; in its day, and its legal interpretation are what set it apart from the other sects of Judaism.

=== Innovators or preservers ===
The Mishna in the beginning of Avot and (in more detail) Maimonides in his Introduction to records a chain of tradition () from Moses at Mount Sinai down to R&#x27; Ashi, redactor of the Talmud and last of the Amoraim. This chain of tradition includes the interpretation of unclear statements in the Bible (e.g. that the &quot;fruit of a beautiful tree&quot; refers to a citron as opposed to any other fruit), the methods of textual exegesis (the disagreements recorded in the Mishna and Talmud generally focus on methods of exegesis), and Laws with Mosaic authority that cannot be derived from the Biblical text (these include measurements (e.g. what amount of a non-kosher food must one eat to be liable), the amount and order of the scrolls to be placed in the phylacteries, etc.).

The Pharisees were also innovators in that they enacted specific laws as they saw necessary according to the needs of the time. These included prohibitions to prevent an infringement of a biblical prohibition (e.g. one does not take a Lulav on Shabbat &quot;Lest one carry it in the public domain&quot;) called , among others. The commandment to read the (Book of Esther) on Purim and to light the Menorah on Hanukkah are Rabbinic innovations. Much of the legal system is based on &quot;what the sages constructed via logical reasoning and from established practice&quot;. Also, the blessings before meals and the wording of the Amidah. These are known as Takanot. The Pharisees based their authority to innovate on the verses: &quot;...according to the word they tell you... according to all they instruct you. According to the law they instruct you and according to the judgment they say to you, you shall do; you shall not divert from the word they tell you, either right or left&quot; (Deuteronomy 17:10–11) (see &quot;Encyclopedia Talmudit&quot; entry &quot;Divrei Soferim&quot;).

In an interesting twist, Abraham Geiger posits that the Sadducees were the more hidebound adherents to an ancient Halacha whereas the Pharisees were more willing to develop Halacha as the times required. See however, Bernard Revel&#x27;s &quot;Karaite Halacha&quot; which rejects many of Geiger&#x27;s proofs.

=== Significance of debate and study of the law ===
Just as important as (if not more important than) any particular law was the value the rabbis placed on legal study and debate. The sages of the Talmud believed that when they taught the Oral Torah to their students, they were imitating Moses, who taught the law to the children of Israel. Moreover, the rabbis believed that &quot;the heavenly court studies Torah precisely as does the earthly one, even arguing about the same questions.&quot; Thus, in debating and disagreeing over the meaning of the Torah or how best to put it into practice, no rabbi felt that he (or his opponent) was rejecting God or threatening Judaism; on the contrary, it was precisely through such arguments that the rabbis imitated and honored God.

One sign of the Pharisaic emphasis on debate and differences of opinion is that the Mishnah and Talmud mark different generations of scholars in terms of different pairs of contending schools. In the first century, for example, the two major Pharisaic schools were those of Hillel and Shammai. After Hillel died in 10 CE, Shammai assumed the office of president of the Sanhedrin until he died in 30 CE. Followers of these two sages dominated scholarly debate over the following decades. Although the Talmud records the arguments and positions of the school of Shammai, the teachings of the school of Hillel were ultimately taken as authoritative.

==Relations with Christianity==


The Pharisees appear in the New Testament, engaging in conflicts with John the Baptist and with Jesus, and because Nicodemus the Pharisee (John 3:1) with Joseph of Arimathea entombed Jesus&#x27; body at great personal risk. Gamaliel, the highly respected rabbi and, according to Christianity, defender of the apostles, was also a Pharisee, and according to some Christian traditions secretly converted to Christianity.

There are several references in the New Testament to Paul the Apostle being a Pharisee before converting to Christianity, and other members of the Pharisee sect are known from Acts 15:5 to have become Christian believers. It was some members of his group who argued that gentile converts must be circumcised and obliged to follow the Mosaic law, leading to a dispute within the early Church addressed at the Apostolic Council in Jerusalem in 50 CE.

The New Testament, particularly the Synoptic Gospels, presents especially the leadership of the Pharisees as obsessed with man-made rules (especially concerning purity) whereas Jesus is more concerned with God&#x27;s love; the Pharisees scorn sinners whereas Jesus seeks them out. (The Gospel of John, which is the only gospel where Nicodemus is mentioned, particularly portrays the sect as divided and willing to debate.) Because of the New Testament&#x27;s frequent depictions of Pharisees as self-righteous rule-followers (see also Woes of the Pharisees and Legalism (theology)), the word &quot;pharisee&quot; (and its derivatives: &quot;pharisaical&quot;, etc.) has come into semi-common usage in English to describe a hypocritical and arrogant person who places the letter of the law above its spirit. Jews today typically find this insulting and some consider the use of the word to be anti-Semitic.

Hyam Maccoby speculates that Jesus was a Pharisee and that his arguments with Pharisees is a sign of inclusion rather than fundamental conflict (disputation being the dominant narrative mode employed in the Talmud as a search for truth, and not necessarily a sign of opposition). However, Maccoby&#x27;s views have been widely rejected by scholars.

Examples of passages include the story of Jesus declaring the sins of a paralytic man forgiven and the Pharisees calling the action blasphemy. In the story, Jesus counters the accusation that he does not have the power to forgive sins by pronouncing forgiveness of sins and then healing the man. The account of the Paralytic Man and Jesus&#x27;s performance of miracles on the Sabbath are often interpreted as oppositional and at times antagonistic to that of the Pharisees&#x27; teachings.

However, according to E. P. Sanders, Jesus&#x27; actions are actually similar to and consistent with Jewish beliefs and practices of the time, as recorded by the rabbis, that commonly associate illness with sin and healing with forgiveness. Jews (according to Sanders) reject the New Testament suggestion that the healing would have been critical of, or criticized by, the Pharisees as no surviving rabbinic source questions or criticizes this practice, and the notion that Pharisees believed that &quot;God alone&quot; could forgive sins is more of a rhetorical device than historical fact. Another argument from Sanders is that, according to the New Testament, Pharisees wanted to punish Jesus for healing a man&#x27;s withered hand on Sabbath. Despite the Mishna and Gemara being replete with restrictions on healing on the Sabbath (for example, Mishna Shabbat, 22:6), Sanders states that no Rabbinic rule has been found according to which Jesus would have violated Sabbath.

According to Chris Keith, there have been many scholars on both sides who were either highly critical of the historicity of the controversy narratives between Jesus and the scribes and Pharisees or found the stories to be historically credible. Some of the former went as far as to claim that these narratives tried to hide the truth that Jesus in actuality was a Pharisee. Keith agrees with the latter and agrees that conflicts between Jesus and the literate interpreters of the text happened as the Gospels say and can be traced back to the historical Jesus, disputing Sanders in particular. While he acknowledges that the Gospels&#x27; stories are a &quot;product of the time(s) in which they were formed&quot; and were affected by later struggles between Christians and Jews, he argues that such symbolism that drapes the Gospel narratives does not mean they are not historical and that there are convincing arguments Jesus did have such debates.

Paula Frederiksen and Michael J. Cook believe that those passages of the New Testament that are seemingly most hostile to the Pharisees were written sometime after the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE. Only Christianity and Pharisaism survived the destruction of the Temple, and the two competed for a short time until the Pharisees emerged as the dominant form of Judaism. When many Jews did not convert, Christians sought converts from among the Gentiles. Some scholars have found evidence of continuous interactions between Jewish-Christian and rabbinic movements from the mid to late 2nd century to the 4th century.

<doc id="69597" wikidata="Q502291" url="?curid=69597" title="Catherine Wheel (band)">
<text>Catherine Wheel were an English alternative rock band from Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft. The band was active from 1990 to 2000, releasing five full-length albums in their career, embarking on many lengthy tours and experiencing fluctuating levels of commercial success. Their early music was associated with the shoegazing scene, but gradually evolved to a more aggressive style influenced by hard rock and metal. Initially receiving attention and success after releasing their debut album &quot;Ferment&quot; in 1992, the band achieved peak success with the release of &quot;Crank&quot; and their album &quot;Chrome&quot; in 1993. The band also achieved minor success with other albums, including &quot;Happy Days&quot;, which featured a popular song &quot;Judy Staring at the Sun&quot; as a collaboration with Tanya Donelly. Catherine Wheel also scored heavy rotation on MTV and performed there several times. Despite never having any albums or songs that achieved major success in their homeland, Catherine Wheel continue to be popular among alternative rock and shoegaze fans and critics.

==History==
Catherine Wheel formed in 1990, comprising singer-guitarist Rob Dickinson (cousin of Iron Maiden&#x27;s Bruce Dickinson), guitarist Brian Futter, bassist Dave Hawes, and drummer Neil Sims. Hawes had previously played in a Joy Division-influenced band called Eternal. They took their moniker from the firework known as the Catherine wheel, which in turn had taken its name from the medieval torture device of the same name. The band was sometimes included in the shoegazing scene, characterized by bands that made extensive use of guitar feedback and droning washes of noise, as well as their continuous interaction with extensive numbers of effects pedals on the stage floor.

The band performed a Peel session in early 1991 while still unsigned; two 12&quot; vinyl EPs were released on the Norwich-based Wilde Club Records, named after the regular weekly Wilde Club gigs run by Barry Newman at Norwich Arts Centre. They signed to major-label Fontana Records after being courted by both Creation Records and the Brian Eno-run label Opal Records. The band&#x27;s debut album, 1991/92&#x27;s &quot;Ferment&quot;, made an immediate impression on the music press and introduced Catherine Wheel&#x27;s second-biggest US hit, &quot;Black Metallic&quot;, as well as the moderate hit &quot;I Want to Touch You&quot;. The album features re-recorded versions of some of the Wilde Club-issued EPs. &quot;Black Metallic&quot; was later featured in the film &quot;S. Darko&quot;.

The more aggressive &quot;Chrome&quot; followed in 1993, produced by Gil Norton. With this album, the band began to shed its original shoegazing tag, while still making skillful use of atmospherics, such as on the song &quot;Fripp&quot;. In a 2007 interview, Rob Dickinson said that members of Death Cab for Cutie and Interpol told him that without this album, their bands &quot;wouldn&#x27;t exist.&quot;

1995&#x27;s &quot;Happy Days&quot; saw the band delving further into metallic hard rock, which alienated a portion of their fanbase, even as it increased their exposure in the United States during the post-grunge era. The single &quot;Waydown&quot;, and especially its plane-crash themed video, received heavy play in the US. A more sedate strain of rock known as Britpop was taking over in the UK, causing Catherine Wheel to continue to have greater success abroad than at home.

The B-sides and outtakes collection, &quot;Like Cats and Dogs&quot;, came out the following year, revealing a quieter, more contemplative side of the band, spanning the previous five years. This carried over into &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; in 1997, wherein the band scaled back the sonic force of their sound from its &quot;Happy Days&quot; levels, with clean playing on some songs that featured extensive use of keyboards and acoustic guitars. Alternately, songs like &quot;Satellite&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Fat Controller&quot; were lush and orchestral in scope.

In 2000, Catherine Wheel re-emerged with a new record label, a new bassist (Ben Ellis); a modified name (&quot;The&quot; Catherine Wheel); and a new album, &quot;Wishville&quot;. After mixed reviews, record company turmoil and lacklustre sales, the band went on a hiatus. In January 2022, the band began updating a new Instagram account, suggesting that the band had reformed in some capacity.

In March 2010, &quot;Ferment&quot; was re-released, containing bonus tracks and extensive sleeve notes.

==Post-Catherine Wheel work==
Futter and Sims have an ongoing project called 50 ft Monster. Ellis was in a band called Serafin, and went on to play with Iggy Pop. After working with/ playing live with Tracy Bonham for several years, Dickinson released a solo album in 2005 called &quot;Fresh Wine for the Horses&quot;. Dickinson retired from recording and founded a Porsche restoration company called Singer Vehicle Design in 2009.

<doc id="69598" wikidata="Q1075286" url="?curid=69598" title="Rounders">
<text>Rounders is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams. Rounders is a striking and fielding team game that involves hitting a small, hard, leather-cased ball with a wooden, plastic, or metal bat that has a rounded end. The players score by running around the four bases on the field.

Played in England since Tudor times, it is referenced in 1744 in the children&#x27;s book &quot;A Little Pretty Pocket-Book&quot; where it was called Base-Ball. The name baseball was superseded by the name rounders in England, while other modifications of the game played elsewhere retained the name baseball. The game is popular among British and Irish school children, particularly among girls. , rounders is played by an estimated seven million children in the UK.

Gameplay centres on a number of innings, in which teams alternate at batting and fielding. Points (known as &#x27;rounders&#x27;) are scored by the batting team when one of their players completes a circuit past four bases without being put &#x27;out&#x27;. The batter must strike at a good ball and attempt to run a rounder in a counter-clockwise direction around the first, second, and third base and home to the fourth, though they may stay at any of the first three. A batter is out if the ball is caught; if the base to which they are running is touched with the ball; or if, while running, they are touched with the ball by a fielder.

==History==

The game of rounders has been played in England since Tudor times, with the earliest reference being in 1744 in &quot;A Little Pretty Pocket-Book&quot; where it was called base-ball. In 1828, William Clarke in London published the second edition of &quot;The Boy&#x27;s Own Book&quot;, which included the rules of rounders and also the first printed description in English of a bat and ball base-running game played on a diamond. The following year, the book was published in Boston, Massachusetts.

The first nationally formalised rules were drawn up by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in Ireland in 1884. The game is still regulated in Ireland by the GAA, through the GAA Rounders National Council (). In Great Britain it is regulated by Rounders England, which was formed in 1943. While the two associations are distinct, they share similar elements of game play and culture. Competitions are held between teams from both traditions.

After the rules of rounders were formalised in Ireland, associations were established in Liverpool, England; and Scotland in 1889. Both the &#x27;New York game&#x27; and the now-defunct &#x27;Massachusetts game&#x27; versions of baseball, as well as softball, share the same historical roots as rounders and bear a resemblance to the GAA version of the game. Rounders is linked to British baseball, which is still played in Liverpool, Cardiff and Newport. Although rounders is assumed to be older than baseball, literary references to early forms of &#x27;base-ball&#x27; in England pre-date use of the term &quot;rounders&quot;.
The game is popular game among British and Irish school children, especially among girls, and is played up to international level. It is played by seven million children in the UK.

==Rules==

Gameplay comprises a number of innings, in which teams alternate at batting and fielding. Nine players constitute a team, with the fielding side consisting of the bowler, the catcher, a player on each of the four bases, and three deep fielders. Points (known as &#x27;rounders&#x27;) are scored by the batting team when one of their players completes a circuit past four bases without being put &#x27;out&#x27;. The batter must strike at a good ball and attempt to run a rounder in an anti-clockwise direction around the first, second, and third base and home to the fourth, though they may rest at any of the first three.

While there are differences between the rules set by Rounders England and by the GAA, they share much in common. The bowler, or &#x27;feeder&#x27;, bowls the ball with an underarm pendulum action to the batter. According to Rounders England rules, the ball is deemed a &#x27;good&#x27; ball if it passes within reach on the striking side between the batter&#x27;s knees and the top of the head. Otherwise, it is called a &#x27;no-ball&#x27; or &#x27;bad&#x27; ball. The ball is also regarded as bad if it is thrown into the batter&#x27;s body or wide of the batting box. A batter may try to hit a bad ball but is not required to do so. A player is not out if a no-ball is caught and cannot be called out on first base.

When a batter leaves the post, each runner on a base may run to the next and succeeding base. A post runner cannot be declared out when standing at a base. The batter must keep in contact with the base to avoid being declared out. A rounder is scored if one of the batting team completes a circuit without being out. The Rounders England rules state that a half rounder is scored if half a circuit is completed by a player without being put out, or if the batter has not hit the ball but makes it all the way to the fourth base. A batter is out if a fielder catches the ball cleanly; the batter reaches a base that had been &#x27;stumped&#x27; (touched while holding the ball) by a fielder; the bat is dropped whilst the batter is running; the batter leaves the base before the bowler has bowled the ball; or the batter is &#x27;run out&#x27; (overtaken) by the next batter.

===Rounders England-specific rules===
In the UK, the rules of rounders are regulated by Rounders England. Games played under these rules use smaller bats and balls and are played on a smaller pitch compared to GAA games. The bases are marked with posts, which batters must keep in contact with and fielders must &#x27;stump&#x27;, and only one &#x27;good&#x27; ball needs to be thrown before a batter must run. &#x27;Half-rounders&#x27; are also counted in scoring.

The fielding team must field a minimum of six players (one on each base plus bowler and catcher). The total number of players on a team is limited to nine.

The ball circumference must be between and and the bat no more than in length and in diameter. Rounders England place a weight-limit of on the bat. The bases are laid out in a manner similar to a baseball diamond, except that batters run to a separate fourth base, at right-angles to third base and the batsman&#x27;s base. Each base is marked with poles, which must be able to support themselves and stand at a minimum of .

If a ball is delivered well, batters must try to hit the ball and must run regardless of whether the ball is hit. If the ball is hit into the backward area, the batter may not pass first post until the ball is returned to the forward area. A batter that hits a no-ball may not be caught out or stumped at the first post. Batters may run on &#x27;no-balls&#x27; but do not have to. Each batter, except the last in each inning, is entitled to receive one good ball: the last batter is entitled to receive three good balls unless he or she is caught out.

One rounder is gained if the player hits the ball, then reaches the fourth post and touches it before the next ball is bowled and is not caught out and hit by the ball. A half rounder is gained if: the player reaches the fourth post having missed the ball; the player reaches the second post having hit the ball; if a batter is obstructed by a fielder whilst running; or if the same batter has two consecutive no balls.

A batter is out if a fielder catches the ball after it has been hit and before it touches the ground, a fielder touches the post of the base halfway up (or higher) with the ball while the batter is running to it, the batter deliberately drops or throws the bat, or another batter runs to the same base or overtakes a batter, in which case both batters are out.

Two innings constitute a game. Each batting team&#x27;s innings continues until nine outs are made or the numbered innings is over.

===GAA-specific rules===

In Ireland, the rules of rounders () are laid down by the Gaelic Athletic Association. The GAA rules are the earliest nationally organised rules of play, being formalised in 1884. It is played on a larger pitch compared to the Rounders England game and consequently uses larger bats and slightly larger balls. A GAA rounders pitch is a square field and bases are apart, compared to for the Rounders England game. Foul ground runs along two adjacent sides of the pitch with a home base at the intersection of these sides.

Five substitutes may be made to the list of nine players at any time during play. A maximum of nine players are allowed to field at one time. Once one team has fielded, then they take their turn at batting following a pre given batting order.

The ball (or ) circumference is and bats may be long and up to in diameter. There is no limit on bat weight. Bases and pitchers stand are normally marked with temporary square mats 64 cm (28&quot;) square.

Each batter is entitled to three good balls. A good ball is one that travels the whole way across home base and between the batters knee and shoulder. A batter can try to hit any good balls that are pitched but need not run once hitting the ball or the first two good balls.

A batter can run on any hit ball that lands in good ground or which is made good by touching a fielder then landing in foul ground. On a third good ball a batter has to run (move from batters box) whether they hit it or not.

Batters may run, but if the sliotar lands in foul ground then the referee calls them back as no play can happen on a foul ball.

A batter is out if:
* on a third good ball, the batter fails to strike the ball and the catcher holds the ball before it touches the ground;
* the bat is thrown or tossed in a dangerous way;
* on a third good ball, the batter strikes the ball into the foul area;
* the bowler or catcher&#x27;s view is obstructed for a second time, after a warning given on the first instance;
* Tagging a runner – i.e. deliberate contact is made with a fielder carrying the ball;
* the batter touches a base that has been &#x27;tagged&#x27; by another fielder carrying the ball, in which case the batter must return to the previous base if it is still unoccupied;
* the batter attempts to occupy a base occupied by someone else.

Batters must run in straight lines between bases and fielders must not obstruct their way or stand on bases. Disobeying this rule is considered unsporting behaviour and may result in up to two bases being awarded to the batting team or a batter being sent out. Normally, one batter may not overtake another while running between bases, although there are exceptions to this rule.

Five innings constitute a game, depending on the level of the match. Each batting team&#x27;s inning continues until three outs are made.

==Comparison with softball and baseball==

The GAA version of rounders is very similar to softball, the main difference being that the game is played with baseball-sized bats, balls and field. However, baseball-style gloves are not allowed. The main differences between baseball and the English version of the game are that the rounders bat is much shorter and is usually swung one-handed; misses or strikes are not called, so there are no walks or strike-outs; each batter receives only one good ball and must run whether they hit it or not. Other differences include the posts for marking the bases, which should be wooden, and are preferably encased in plastic sheaths, the layout of the pitch, especially the location of the last base; and the bowler&#x27;s arm motion, which is an underarm pendulum action, as in softball. It is similar to cricket.

<doc id="69599" wikidata="Q211613" url="?curid=69599" title="Sif">
<text>In Norse mythology, Sif is a golden-haired goddess associated with earth. Sif is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in the poetry of skalds. In both the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, she is known for her golden hair and is married to the thunder god Thor.

The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; recounts that Sif once had her hair shorn by Loki, and that Thor forced Loki to have a golden headpiece made for Sif, resulting in not only Sif&#x27;s golden tresses but also five other objects for other gods. Sif is also named in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; as the mother of Þrúðr (by Thor) and 
Ullr.

Scholars have proposed that Sif&#x27;s hair may represent fields of golden wheat, that she may be associated with fertility, family, wedlock and/or that she is connected to rowan, and that there may be an allusion to her role or possibly her name in the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Sif&quot; is the singular form of the plural Old Norse word . only appears in singular form when referring to the goddess as a proper noun. is cognate to the Old English and modern English (meaning &quot;affinity, connection, by marriage&quot;) and in other Germanic languages: Gothic (), Old High German , and modern German . appears not only in ancient poetry and records of law, but also in compounds ( means &quot;to marry&quot;). Using this etymology, scholar John Lindow gives the meanings &quot;in-law-relationship&quot;, scholar Andy Orchard provides &quot;relation&quot;, and scholar Rudolf Simek gives &quot;relation by marriage&quot;.

== Attestations ==

=== Poetic Edda ===

In stanza 48 of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot;, Hárbarðr (Odin, father of Thor, in disguise) meets Thor at an inlet of a gulf. The two engage in flyting, and Hárbarðr refuses to ferry Thor across the bay. Among numerous other insults, Hárbarðr claims that Sif has a lover at home. In response, Thor says that Hárbarðr is speaking carelessly &quot;of what seems worst to me&quot; and also lying.

In stanzas 53 and 54 of the poem &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, after pouring Loki a crystal cup of mead during his series of insults towards the gods, Sif states that there is nothing Loki can say only in regard to her. In response, Loki claims that Sif has had an affair with him:

Sif does not respond, and the exchange turns to Beyla. Sif is additionally mentioned in two kennings found in poems collected in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;; &quot;Hymiskviða&quot; (where Thor is referred to as the &quot;Husband of Sif&quot; thrice), and &quot;Þrymskviða&quot; (where Thor is once referred to as &quot;Husband of Sif&quot;).

=== Prose Edda ===

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Sif is mentioned once in the Prologue, in chapter 31 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, and in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; as a guest at Ægir&#x27;s feast, the subject of a jötunn&#x27;s desire, as having her hair shorn by Loki, and in various kennings.

Sif is introduced in chapter three of the Prologue section of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;; Snorri&#x27;s euhemerized account of the origins of Norse mythology. Snorri states that Thor married Sif, and that she is known as &quot;a prophetess called Sibyl, though we know her as Sif&quot;. Sif is further described as &quot;the loveliest of women&quot; and with hair of gold. Although he lists her own ancestors as unknown, Snorri writes that Thor and Sif produced a son by the name of Lóriði, who &quot;took after his father&quot;.

In chapter 31 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Ullr is referred to as a son of Sif and a stepson of Thor (though his father is not mentioned):

As reported in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Thor once engages in a duel with Hrungnir, there described as the strongest of the jötnar. Prior to this, Hrungnir had been drunkenly boasting of his desire to, amongst other things, kill all of the gods except Freyja and Sif, whom he wanted to take home with him. However, at the duel, Hrungnir is quickly killed by the enraged Thor.

Further in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Snorri relates a story where Loki cuts off Sif&#x27;s hair as a prank. When Thor discovers this, he grabs hold of Loki, resulting in Loki swearing to have a headpiece made of gold to replace Sif&#x27;s locks. Loki fulfills this promise by having a headpiece made by dwarfs, the Sons of Ivaldi. Along with the headpiece, the dwarfs produced Odin&#x27;s spear, Gungnir. As the story progresses, the incident leads to the creation of the ship Skíðblaðnir and the boar Gullinbursti for Freyr, the multiplying ring Draupnir for Odin, and the mighty hammer Mjöllnir for Thor.

Sif also appears in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; listed as a heiti for &quot;earth&quot;, appears in a kenning for a gold-keeping woman, and once for Hildr. Poetic means of referring to Sif calling her &quot;wife of Thor&quot;, &quot;mother of Ullr&quot;, &quot;the fair-haired deity&quot;, &quot;rival of Járnsaxa&quot;, and as &quot;mother of Þrúðr&quot;.

=== Swedish folklore ===

19th-century scholar Jacob Grimm records that in his time residents of Värmland, Sweden &quot;call[ed] Thor&#x27;s wife &quot;godmor&quot;, good mother.&quot;

== Theories ==

=== &quot;Beowulf&quot; ===

In Old English, &quot;sib&quot; (&quot;family&quot;) is cognate with Old Norse &quot;Sif&quot; and &quot;sif&quot;. In the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; (lines 2016 to 2018), Hroðgar&#x27;s wife, Wealhþeow, moves through the hall serving mead to the warriors and defusing conflict. Various scholars beginning with Magnus Olsen have pointed to the similarity with what Sif does at the feast described in &quot;Lokasenna&quot;. Richard North further notes that unusually, &quot;sib&quot; is personified here and in lines 2599 to 2661, and suggests they may be references to Sif in Danish religion: &quot;Both instances may indicate that the poet of &quot;Beowulf&quot; was in a position to imagine a sixth-century Scandinavia on the basis of his knowledge of contemporary Danish legends.&quot;

=== Hair as wheat and potential cognates ===

19th-century scholar Jacob Grimm proposes a reconstruction of a Germanic deity cognate to Sif in other Germanic cultures and proposes a similar nature to that of the goddesses Frigg and Freyja:

The Goth. , OHG. , , AS. gen. , denote peace, friendship, kindred; from these I infer a divinity &quot;Sibja&quot;, &quot;Sippia&quot;, &quot;Sib&quot;, corresponding to ON. gen. , the wife of Thôrr, for the ON. too has a pl. meaning cognatio, sifi amicus (OHG. , ), sift genus, cognatio. By this sense of the word, &quot;Sif&quot; would appear to be, like Frigg and Freyja, a goddess of loveliness and love; as attributes of Oðinn and Thôrr agree, their wives Frigg and Sif have also a common signification.

Grimm connects Eddic references to Sif&#x27;s golden hair (gold is referred to as ; Sif&#x27;s hair) with the herb name (&quot;Polytrichum aureum&quot;). Grimm says that &quot;expositors see in this the golden fruits of the Earth burnt up by fire and growing again, they liken Sif to Ceres&quot;, and Grimm says that &quot;with it agrees the fact that O. Slav. is a gloss on &quot; but cites etymological problems between the potential cognate. Grimm says that Thor&#x27;s mother was the earth, and not his wife, yet &quot;we do find the simple &quot;Sif&quot; standing for earth.&quot; Grimm adds that he is inconclusive regarding Sif and that, &quot;we ought to have fuller details about Sif, and these are wholly wanting in our mythology. Nowhere amongst us is the mystic relation of the seed-corn of Demeter, whose poignant grief for her daughter threatens to bring famine on mankind (Hymn to Cer. 305–306), nor anything like it, recorded.&quot;

Citing the etymology of her name, 19th century scholar Guðbrandur Vigfússon theorizes that Sif &quot;betokens mother earth with her golden sheaves of grain; she was the goddess of the sanctity of the family and wedlock&quot;.

Scholar Rudolf Simek theorizes that Sif likely originated as a complement to Thor through his fertility associations, and that the name &quot;Sif&quot; (Simek provides the etymology &quot;relation by marriage&quot;) may have originally simply meant &quot;the wife (of Thor)&quot;. Simek rejects notions of a &quot;vegetation cult&quot; venerating Sif, says that Sif does not appear to have a function, dismisses theories proposing connections between Sif&#x27;s hair and grain as &quot;over-zealous interpretation[s]&quot;, and theorizes that Snorri invented the story of Sif&#x27;s shorn locks in attempt to explain the attributes of various gods.

Scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson states that Sif may have been an ancient fertility goddess, agreeing with a link between her lustrous hair and fields of golden wheat. Regarding Sif, Thor, and fertility, Davidson says:

Scholar John Lindow proposes that a potentially understated mythological importance of Sif&#x27;s role in the story of her sheared hair exists; her headpiece is created along with the most important and powerful items in Norse mythology. Lindow further states that it may be easy to lose sight of the central role Sif plays in the creation of these objects.

=== Rowan ===

Sif has been linked with Ravdna, the consort of the Sami thunder god Horagalles. Red berries of rowan were holy to Ravdna and the name &quot;Ravdna&quot; resembles the North Germanic words for the tree (for example, Old Norse &quot;reynir&quot;). According to &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, the rowan is called &quot;the salvation of Thor&quot; because Thor once saved himself by clinging to it. It has been theorized that Sif was once conceived in the form of a rowan to which Thor clung.&quot;

=== &quot;Lokasenna&quot; accusations ===
Regarding the accusations that Loki makes to Sif in &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, Carolyne Larrington says that Sif is not elsewhere attested as unfaithful, though notes that Odin makes a similar accusation in &quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot;, and theorizes a potential connection between the story of Loki cutting off Sif&#x27;s hair with these references. Larrington says &quot;how he got close enough to carry this out might be explained by this verse.&quot;

=== Identity of Sif&#x27;s first husband ===
Several identities have been suggested for Sif&#x27;s first husband, the father of Ullr, but since neither &quot;Edda&quot; names this husband, most scholars continue to consider him unidentified. N. A. Nielsen suggests that she was married to Njord before the Æsir–Vanir War, an interpretation which depends on considering Ullr identical with Freyr, which Rudolf Simek characterizes as &quot;very precarious.&quot;

== Modern influence ==

Sif has inspired the name of a volcano on the planet Venus (Sif Mons).

Sif&#x27;s characterization in modern media tends to be much more martial than in the original sources. The Marvel Comics character, Sif, is based on the Sif of Norse myth and is portrayed by Jaimie Alexander in the Marvel Studios film &quot;Thor&quot;, its , the &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; television series, and the &quot;Loki&quot; streaming series episode &quot;The Nexus Event&quot;, where the hair shearing incident has loosely been adapted.

Lady Sif appears in Santa Monica Studio&#x27;s 2022 video game &quot;God of War Ragnarök&quot;, where she is voiced by Emily Rose.

<text>In Norse mythology, Snotra (Old Norse: , &quot;clever&quot;) is a goddess associated with wisdom. Snotra is attested in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.

A character named Snotra also appears in a darkly comedic tale at the start of &quot;Gautreks saga&quot;, in which she is a human woman, the youngest daughter in a family of foolish farmers. Her parents in this story are called Skafnörtungr (&#x27;Skinflint&#x27;) and Tötra (&#x27;Tatters&#x27;), and she has three brothers (Fjolmod, Imsigull, and Gilling) and two sisters (Hjotra and Fjotra). The family is visited by King Gauti of West Gotaland, the eponymous ancestor of the Geats and Goths, by whom Snotra becomes pregnant with Gautrek.

==Attestations==
In chapter 35 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur. High lists Snotra thirteenth, and says that Snotra &quot;is wise and courteous&quot;. In addition, High adds that, after Snotra&#x27;s name, a wise man or woman can be called &quot;snotr&quot;. In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Snotra is included among a list of 27 ásynjur names. Apart from these two sources, Snotra is otherwise unattested.

==Reception==
Andy Orchard and Rudolf Simek state that, as Snotra is unattested beyond the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Snotra may be an invention of Snorri&#x27;s. Orchard theorizes that, otherwise, Snorri may have had access to a lost source, and that the little information Snorri presents may be derived from the meaning of her name.
Simek says that Snorri may have invented Snotra from the Old Norse word &quot;snotr&quot; (&quot;clever&quot;) and &quot;placed [her] next to other insignificant goddesses.&quot; However, Simek also writes that the goddesses Snotra, Sága, Hlín, Sjöfn, Vár, and Vör should be considered vaguely defined figures who &quot;should be seen as female protective goddesses&quot; that are all responsible for &quot;specific areas of the private sphere, and yet clear differences were made between them so that they are in many ways similar to matrons.&quot;

<text>Alfonso I of Asturias, called the Catholic (&quot;el Católico&quot;), ( – 757) was the third king of Asturias, reigning from 739 to his death in 757. His reign saw an extension of the Christian domain of Asturias, reconquering Galicia and León.

He succeeded his brother-in-law Favila, and was succeeded by his son, Fruela I. Alfonso&#x27;s illegitimate son, Mauregatus, also became king, and his daughter Adosinda was consort to King Silo of Asturias. The dynasty started by Alfonso was known in contemporary Al-Andalus as the Astur-Leonese dynasty.

==Biography==

As the son of Duke Peter of Cantabria, Alfonso held many lands in that region. He is said to have married Ermesinda, daughter of Pelagius, who founded Asturias after the Battle of Covadonga in which he reversed the Moorish conquest of the region. He succeeded Pelagius&#x27; son, his brother-in-law, Favila, on the throne after the latter&#x27;s premature death.

Whether Pelagius or Favila were ever considered kings in their own lifetime is debatable, but Alfonso certainly was. He began a lifelong war against the Moors. In 740, he took advantage of the Berber Revolt and expanded his domain. The cities of Lugo and Tuy in Galicia, who had remained unoccupied by muslim forces joined his domain and, in 754, he conquered the City of León. He went as far as La Rioja. However, the few urban populations of these frontier regions fled to his northern dominions, leaving a depopulated buffer between the Christian and Muslim states.

This created the so-called &quot;Desert of the Duero&quot;, an empty region between the River Duero and the Asturian Mountains. Alfonso intended it this way; he wished to create an area in which any invading army would find survival difficult. Besides the martial aspects, the demographic and cultural effects of this policy on later Asturian, Spanish and Portuguese history is large. It was over a hundred years before the region was repopulated (an event known as the &quot;&quot;).

The Arab writers speak of the kings of the northwest of Iberia as the &quot;Beni Alfons&quot; (descendants or House of Alfonso), and appear to recognize them as a Galician royal stock derived from Alfonso I. Alfonso is credited with establishing the shrine of Our Lady of Covadonga, in commemoration of his father in law&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Covadonga. He and his queen are interred there. Their epitaph reads:

: &quot;AQVI YAZE EL CATOLICO Y SANTO REI DON ALONSO EL PRIMERO I SV MVJER DOÑA ERMENISINDA ERMANA DE DON FAVILA A QVIEN SVCEDIO. GANO ESTE REY MVCHAS VITORIAS À LOS MOROS. FALLECIO EN CANGAS AÑO DE 757.&quot;

: &quot;Here lies the Catholic and Holy King Don Alfonso the First and his wife Doña Ermesinda, sister of Don Favila whom he succeeded. This king won many victories against the Moors. He died in Cangas in the year 757.&quot;

==Family==
Alfonso had four children. Three were through his marriage to Ermesinda, and one, Mauregatus, was born to a Muslim slave, Sisalda.

*Fruela I of Asturias (722-768): succeeded Alfonso as king (757-768).
*Vimarano: assassinated in 765 by Fruela.
*Adosinda: queen consort of King Silo of Asturias (reigned 774-783)
*Mauregatus of Asturias: succeeded Silo as king (reigned 783-789).

<doc id="69604" wikidata="Q2632580" url="?curid=69604" title="Perseverance of the saints">
<text>Perseverance of the saints, also known as preservation of the saints, is a Calvinist doctrine asserting that the elect will persevere in faith and ultimately achieve salvation. This concept was initially developed by Augustine of Hippo in the early 5th century, based on the idea of predestination by predeterminism. In the 16th century, John Calvin and other reformers integrated this idea into their theological framework. The doctrine of perseverance of the saints is rooted in this understanding of predestination and continues to be a central tenet of Reformed theology today.

==Definition and terminology==
=== Definition ===
The doctrine of perseverance of the saints asserts that the elect will persevere in faith until the end of their lives and ultimately achieve salvation. Those who are truly born again are the elect who will persevere to the end.

===Terminology===
The alternative term &quot;preservation of the saints&quot; emphasizes God&#x27;s role in determining the elect&#x27;s perseverance. Conversely, &quot;perseverance of the saints&quot; highlights the human act of perseverance, which is a consequence of God&#x27;s preservation. However, &quot;preservation of the saints&quot; is a broader concept that can describe how God preserves the elect, whether deterministically or not. The non-deterministic view, known as &quot;conditional preservation,&quot; refers to God protecting the believer’s relationship with Him from external forces, contingent upon the believer’s continued faith.

Because one practical interpretation of the Calvinist doctrine of &quot;perseverance of the saints&quot; leads to &quot;eternal security&quot;, over time, the term became synonymous with the doctrine itself. By the early 20th century, &quot;eternal security&quot; was used as a strict synonym for &quot;perseverance of the saints&quot;. However, given the theological significance of the term &quot;eternal security&quot; in common usage, it&#x27;s important to distinguish them. Indeed, some Calvinist theologians reject the use of &quot;eternal security&quot; for their doctrine of perseverance, as do proponents of non-Calvinist forms of eternal security.

==History==
=== Augustine&#x27;s doctrine of perseverance ===

Before his conversion to Christianity in 387, Augustine of Hippo (354–430), adhered to three deterministic philosophies: Stoicism, Neoplatonism and Manichaeism. After his conversion, he taught traditional Christian theology against forms of theological determinism until 412.

During his conflict with the Pelagians, however Augustine seemed to reintroduce certain Manichean principles into his thought, a shift notably influenced by the controversy over infant baptism. His early exposure to Stoicism, with its emphasis on meticulous divine predeterminism, also shaped his views. According to Manichean doctrine, unborn and unbaptized infants were condemned to hell due to their physical bodies. Augustine asserted that God predetermined parents to seek baptism for their newborns, linking water baptism to regeneration, and ultimately predetermining which infants are damned and which are justified.

Augustine had to explain why some baptized individuals continued in the faith while others fell away and lived immoral lives. He taught that among those regenerated through baptism, some receive an additional gift of perseverance () enabling them to maintain their faith and preventing them from falling away. Without this second gift, a baptized Christian with the Holy Spirit would not persevere and ultimately would not be saved. Augustine developed this doctrine of perseverance in (). While this doctrine theoretically gives security to the elect who receive the gift of perseverance, individuals cannot ascertain whether they have received it.

=== Proponents of Augustinian soteriology before the Reformation ===
Between the 5th century and the Reformation in the 16th century, theologians who upheld Augustinian soteriology, included: Gottschalk (c. 808–868), Ratramnus (died 868), Thomas Bradwardine (1300–1349), Gregory of Rimini (1300–1358), John Wycliffe (1320s – 1384), Johann Ruchrat von Wesel (died 1481), Girolamo Savonarola (1452–1498) and Johannes von Staupitz (1460–1524).

=== Development of the Calvinist doctrine of perseverance ===

John Calvin (1509–1564) among other Reformers, was deeply influenced by Augustinian soteriology. The soteriology of Calvin was further shaped and systematized by Theodore Beza and other theologians. It was then articulated during the Second Synod of Dort (1618–1619) in response to the opposing &quot;Five Articles of Remonstrance&quot;. The Calvinist doctrine of perseverance is present in Reformed confessions of faith such as the Lambeth Articles (1595), the Canons of Dort (1618-1619) and the Westminster Confession of Faith (1646).

==Doctrine==
=== A consequence of the Calvinist doctrine of predestination ===
Orthodox forms of Calvinism view God&#x27;s providence as expressed through theological determinism. This means that every event in the world is determined by God. As the Westminster Confession of Faith put it: &quot;God, from all eternity, did, by the most wise and holy counsel of His own will, freely, and unchangeably ordain whatever comes to pass.&quot;

Concerning salvation, Calvin expressly taught that it is God&#x27;s sovereign decision to determine whether an individual is saved or damned. He writes &quot;By predestination we mean the eternal decree of God, by which he determined with himself whatever he wished to happen with regard to every man. All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that he has been predestinated to life or to death.&quot; Indeed, human actions leading to this end are also predetermined by God. In accordance, Calvin held to the doctrine of perseverance of the saints, contending for the unconditional preservation of the elect.

===Practical interpretations of the doctrine of perseverance of the saints===
==== Practical interpretation rejecting an absolute assurance of salvation ====
According to Calvinism, apostasy is not possible for those who are true Christians. However, being a true Christian is only demonstrated by perseverance to the end. This arises because there are instances where individuals appear to come to God but later display definitive apostasy. To address this phenomenon, Calvinist theologians have postulated that common grace might include effects that cannot be distinguished from effectual calling and subsequent irresistible grace. About that issue, Calvin formulated the concept of a temporary grace (sometimes called &quot;evanescent grace&quot;) that appears and works for only a while in the reprobate but then to disappears. According to this concept, the Holy Spirit can create in some people effects which are indistinguishable from those of the irresistible grace of God, producing also a visible &quot;fruit&quot; in their life. Temporary grace was also supported by later Calvinist theologians such as Theodore Beza, William Perkins, John Owen, A. W. Pink and Loraine Boettner. This suggests that the knowledge of being a true Christian is theoretically not accessible during life. Thus a first interpretation of the doctrine of perseverance of the saints acknowledges explanations of apparent apostasy like &quot;evanescent grace,&quot; which avoids offering to the believer absolute assurance of salvation during life. Several Reformed theologians have expressed a non-absolute assurance of salvation view.

==== Practical interpretation supporting an absolute assurance of salvation ====

Calvin heavily drew upon Augustinian soteriology. However, both Augustine and Luther, an Augustinian friar, held that believers, based on their own understanding, cannot definitively know if they are among the &quot;elect to perseverance.&quot; Despite Calvin&#x27;s inability to offer a clear rationale, he was more optimistic than Luther regarding this possibility. Calvin suggested that some assurance of being an elect might be possible. This possibility of assurance, based on personal introspection, was also expressed by later Calvinist theologians. It was mentioned in the Heidelberg Catechism (1563) and the Westminster Confession of Faith (1646). In the 18th century, Hyper-Calvinism encouraged introspection as a means for adherents to determine their election. The concept persisted into the 19th century. This assurance forms the foundation of unconditional eternal security within Calvinist circles.

The process leading to eternal security unfolds as follows: Initially, the believer must embrace the Calvinist system, emphasizing unconditional election and irresistible grace. Subsequently, through self-examination, they must discern the spiritual influence of the Holy Spirit. This introspection may lead to a faith in their own predetermined election. In this context, the concept of the perseverance of the saints may prompt the believer to believe in their irresistible perseverance.

Because this practical interpretation of the doctrine of &quot;perseverance of the saints&quot; leads to &quot;eternal security&quot;, within Reformed Christianity, the term has become synonymous with the doctrine itself over time. By the early 20th century, &quot;eternal security&quot; was used as a strict synonym for &quot;perseverance of the saints&quot;. However, in broader Protestantism, &quot;eternal security&quot; often carries a distinct meaning. It&#x27;s then important to differentiate the two due to their respective theological significance.

Groups such as the Primitive Baptists, originating in Georgia in the early 20th century, officially embraced this form of eternal security due to their strong Calvinist beliefs. 

==== Historical acknowledgment of the interpretations ====
In Calvinist circles, thus, two practical interpretations emerge regarding &quot;perseverance of the saints&quot;: One interpretation accept explanations of apparent apostasy such as &quot;evanescent grace,&quot; which does not offer believers absolute assurance of salvation during life. The other interpretation rejects these explanations, asserting that believers, through introspection, can know with absolute certainty that they are elect, thus allowing belief in eternal security. These two perspectives were already observed in the 16th century. Jacobus Arminius, (1560-1609), a pastor of the Reformed Church, encountered both perspectives stemming from the doctrine of perseverance of the saints. He labeled the first perspective &quot;despair&quot; () and the second &quot;security&quot; (). This &quot;eternal security&quot; interpretation of perseverance of the saints was also explicitly condemned by the Council of Trent (1545-1563).

==Objections==
=== Perseverance of the saints hinders assurance of salvation ===
The doctrine of perseverance of the saints can suggest that a believer have some assurance of final salvation. However, this interpretation faces criticism for its perceived inconsistency. In orthodox Calvinism, while the elect will persevere to the end, believers cannot know they are elect until they persevere to the end. This reality, regardless of explanations for definitive apostasy, undermines the practical utility of &quot;perseverance of the saints,&quot; hindering assurance of salvation. This critique has been advanced by various non-Calvinist sources, including proponents of free grace theology, and advocates of conditional preservation of the saints, such as Arminians.

=== Inconsistencies in explaining definitive apostasy ===
Within the perseverance of the saints framework, the phenomenon of definitive apostasy is generally explained by Calvinist theologians by the &quot;evanescent grace&quot; concept. This concept implies that the Holy Spirit voluntarily gives temporary faith and related &quot;fruits&quot;. Non-Calvinist Christians find this explanation contrary to the revealed character of God and inconsistent with the overall revelation.

=== The eternal security interpretation introduces a tension in the subject of faith ===
The &quot;eternal security&quot; practical interpretation of perseverance of the saints asserts that an individual can believe he is an elect and will thus irresistibly persevere. Arminians often highlight a tension in this view between present faith in Jesus and faith in a past event, namely, election. They argue that such faith in a past event is given equal significance in ensuring final salvation as present faith in Jesus. Arminians contend that genuine faith should be unique and focused solely on Jesus.

===The eternal security interpretation can lead to antinominianism===
The &quot;eternal security&quot; practical interpretation of perseverance of the saints asserts that an individual can believe he is an elect and will thus irresistibly persevere. Such an interpretation can lead an individual to abandon a dynamic understanding of sanctification in favor of a static, antinomian perspective.

== Debated exegetical aspects ==
=== Warning passages of the book of Hebrews ===
Several warning passages in the book of Hebrews, especially and seem to contradict the Calvinistic doctrine of the unconditional preservation of the elect. The debate over these passages centers around the identity of the persons in question, with the following main interpretations proposed:

* The hypothetical view: The warnings are genuine but hypothetical, intended to jar believers into moral rectitude and perseverance.
* The phenomenological-false believer view: The warnings are real and directed toward people who can genuinely commit the sin, but those who can do so are not true believers.
* The phenomenological-true believer view: The warnings are given to true believers who can genuinely commit the sin.
* The covenant community view: The warnings concern the rejection of a covenant community by God when the community as a whole turns away from God&#x27;s will, rather than individual believers.
There are several less common interpretations. One suggests that the warnings do not refer to a loss of salvation but rather a loss of eternal rewards. Another posits that the warnings could refer to Jewish Christians reverting to Judaism.

=== Hebrew 6:4-6 interpretations supporting Calvinist unconditional preservation ===
&quot;Hypothetical view&quot;: Hebrews 6:4-6 can describe those who temporarily backslide in their faith but does not address the issue of permanent loss of faith. This interpretation has faced strong criticism from non-Calvinists.

&quot;Phenomenological-false believer view&quot;: Hebrews 6:4-6 does not refer to regenerated individuals, but to unbelievers who have received God&#x27;s gifts and benefited from His grace yet remained skeptics. This view has also been strongly criticized by non-Calvinists.

=== Hebrew 6:4-6 interpretation contradicting Calvinist unconditional preservation ===
&quot;Phenomenological-true believer view&quot;: Oropeza asserts that the recipients of the letter to the Hebrews had faced persecutions, and the author acknowledges that some members had become apostates despite their genuine conversion experiences. The author warns the current audience that despite their past benefits and experiences confirming their faith, they too could fall away if they continue in their state of malaise and neglect, with dire consequences for apostasy. While some argue for an irremediable apostasy interpretation, others, contend that apostasy by a regenerated Christian is possible but not systematically irremediable as long as they are alive. According to this view, McKnight suggests that the author of Hebrews describes an apostasy that exceeds the grace period given by God, which is irremediable, not the remediable apostasy that can occur during a person&#x27;s life.

== Differing Protestant views ==
=== Anabaptist view ===
Anabaptist theology traditionally teaches conditional preservation of the saints.

===Lutheran view===
Lutherans believe that a true Christian can lose his or her salvation.

===Arminian view===
Arminians teaches conditional preservation of the saints.

=== Free Grace view ===
Free grace advocates believe that believers are promised eternal security, but not guaranteed perseverance. Those who do not persevere will face temporal discipline and loss of rewards.

<doc id="69605" wikidata="Q3946" url="?curid=69605" title="Cantabria">
<text>Cantabria (, ; ) is an autonomous community and province in northern Spain with Santander as its capital city. It is called a , a historic community, in its current Statute of Autonomy. It is bordered on the east by the Basque autonomous community (province of Biscay), on the south by Castile and León (provinces of León, Palencia and Burgos), on the west by the Principality of Asturias, and on the north by the Cantabrian Sea, which forms part of the Bay of Biscay.

Cantabria belongs to &quot;Green Spain&quot;, the name given to the strip of land between the Bay of Biscay and the Cantabrian Mountains, so called because of its particularly lush vegetation, due to the wet and temperate oceanic climate. The climate is strongly influenced by Atlantic Ocean winds trapped by the mountains; the average annual precipitation is about .

Cantabria has archaeological sites from the Upper Paleolithic period, although the first signs of human occupation date from the Lower Paleolithic. The most significant site for cave paintings is in the cave of Altamira, dating from about 37,000 BCE and declared, along with nine other Cantabrian caves, as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. Historically, the territory sits in the area of Cantabria in the ancient period, but from the late Middle Ages to the early 19th century, the name Cantabria also referred to the territory of the Basques, especially the lordship of Biscay.

The modern province of Cantabria was constituted on 28 July 1778 at Puente San Miguel, Reocín. The yearly Day of the Institutions holiday on 28 July celebrates this. The Organic Law of the Autonomy Statute of Cantabria, approved on 30 December 1981, gave the region its own institutions of self-government.

==Etymology and usage==

Numerous authors, including Isidore of Seville, Julio Caro Baroja, Aureliano Fernández Guerra and Adolf Schulten, have explored the etymology of the name &quot;Cantabria&quot;, yet its origins remain uncertain. The Online Etymology Dictionary states the root &quot;cant-&quot; is said to come from the Celtic for &quot;rock&quot; or &quot;rocky&quot;, while &quot;-abr&quot; was a common suffix used in Celtic regions. Thus, &quot;Cantabrian&quot; could mean &quot;people who live in the rocks&quot; or &quot;highlanders&quot;, a reference to the steep and mountainous territory of Cantabria.

The name &quot;Cantabria&quot; could also be related to the Celtic root &quot;kant&quot; or &quot;cant&quot; meaning edge or rim thus &quot;coastal district,&quot; or &quot;corner-land&quot;, &quot;land on the edge&quot; thus having the same probable derivation as the name of the English county of Kent and Canterbury, one of its major cities.

During the Spanish liberal regimes of the 19th century, the term came to be increasingly associated to the province of Santander. However, in late medieval and Modern Period literature, &quot;Cantabria&quot; and &quot;Cantabrians&quot; refer to the Basque Country, especially the lordship of Biscay, and the Basques.

==Geography==

===Relief===

Cantabria is a mountainous and coastal region, with important natural resources. It has two distinct areas which are well differentiated morphologically:

*Coast. A coastal strip of low, wide and gently rolling valleys some 10 kilometres in width, the altitude of which does not rise above 500 metres, and which meets the ocean in a line of abrupt cliffs broken by river estuaries, forming rias and beaches. Santander Bay is the most prominent indentation in the coastline. To the south, the coastal strip rises to meet the mountains.
*Mountains. This is a long barrier made up of abruptly rising mountains parallel to the sea, which are part of the Cantabrian Mountains. The mountains are mostly made of limestone with karst topography, and occupy most of Cantabria&#x27;s area. They form deep valleys running north–south. The torrential rivers are short, fast flowing and of great eroding power, so the slopes are steep. The valleys define different natural regions, delimited physically by the intervening mountain ranges: Liébana, Saja-Nansa, Besaya, Pas-Pisueña, Miera, Asón-Agüera, Campoo. To the &#x27;mountain&#x27; region belongs the Escudo Range, a mountain range of high that covers in a parallel line to the coast in the West part of Cantabria.
Towards the south are higher mountains, the tops of which form the watershed between the drainage basins of the Rivers Ebro, Duero and the rivers that flow into the Bay of Biscay. These peaks generally exceed from the Pass of San Glorio in the west to the Pass of Los Tornos in the eastern part: Peña Labra, Castro Valnera and the mountain passes of Sejos, El Escudo and La Sía. The great limestone masses of Picos de Europa also stand out in the southwest of the region: most of their summits exceed , and their topography is shaped by the former presence of glaciers.

===Climate===
Due to the Gulf Stream, Cantabria, as well as the rest of &quot;Green Spain&quot;, has a much more temperate climate than might be expected for its latitude. The region has a humid oceanic climate, with warm summers and mild winters. Annual precipitation is around 1,200 mm at the coasts and higher in the mountains. The mean temperature is about . Snow is frequent in the higher zones of Cantabria between the months of October and March. Some zones of Picos de Europa, over 2,500 metres high, have an alpine climate with snow persisting year-round. The driest months are July and August. The mountainous relief of Cantabria has a dominant effect on local microclimate in Cantabria. It is the main cause of the peculiar meteorologic situations like the so-called &quot;suradas&quot; (Ábrego wind), due to the foehn effect: the southerly wind coming down from the mountains blows strongly and dry, increasing the temperature closer to the coast. This causes a decrease in air humidity and rainfall. These conditions are more frequent in autumn and winter, and the temperatures are commonly higher than . Fires are often helped by this type of wind: one example is the fire that destroyed part of the city of Santander in the winter of 1941. In these specific cases in the southern part of the mountain range the dry adiabatic gradient produces different conditions to the rest of the region: the wind there is fresher and more humid, and there is more rain.

===Hydrology===

The rivers of Cantabria are short and rapid, descending steeply because the sea is so close to their source in the Cantabrian Mountains. They flow perpendicular to the coastline, except for the Ebro. They also generally flow year round due to constant rainfall. Nevertheless, the rate of flow is modest (20 m3/s annual average) compared to the other rivers of the Iberian Peninsula. The rapidness of their waters, caused by their steep descents, gives them great erosive power, creating the narrow V-shaped valleys characteristic of Green Spain. The environmental condition of the rivers is generally good, although increasing human activity due to rising population in the valleys continues to pose a challenge.
The main rivers of the region, sorted by drainage basin, are:
*North Basin (flows into the Cantabrian Sea)
**Agüera
**Asón
**Besaya
**Deva
**Miera
**Nansa
**Pas
**Saja
*Ebro Basin (flows into the Mediterranean Sea)
**Híjar
**Ebro
*Duero Basin (flows into the Atlantic Ocean)
Cantabria is the only autonomous community whose rivers flow into every one of the seas which surround the Iberian Peninsula: the Cantabrian Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.

===Vegetation===

The variation in the altitude of the region, which in a short distance ranges from sea level to 2,600 meters in the mountains, leads to a great deal of diversity in vegetation and a large number of biomes. Cantabria has vegetation typical of the Atlantic side of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by forests of leafy deciduous trees such as oak and European beech. Nevertheless, human intervention dating back to ancient times has favored the creation of pastures, allowing the existence of large areas of grassland and prairies suitable for grazing cattle. These grasslands are mingled with plantations of eucalyptus and native oak. The southern part of Cantabria, including the &quot;comarca&quot; of Campoo the fringes of the Castilian plateau, is characterized by the transition to drier vegetation. Another diversifying factor which contributes to local variation within the region is the Mediterranean ecotone, giving rise to species unique to the region, such as the holm oak and arbutus trees, which are found in poor limestone soils with little moisture.

In Cantabria there are several zones of plant life:
*The coastal strip, including sandy dunes with minimal vegetation. Adjacent to these are steep cliffs with plants unique to that type of terrain.

*The maritime region, near the coast and including altitudes up to 500 metres. Originally it had mixed deciduous forests containing ash, linden, bay laurel, hazel, maple, oak, poplar, birch, holm oak, and others. The riparian parts were filled with forests of alder and willow. Today these native forests have almost completely disappeared, leaving only reserves in area of poor arability. In their place there are grasslands which are quite productive in the temperate climate and which sustain the economy of rural Cantabria. Next to these are very large monoculture plantations of eucalyptus for paper production, of disastrous ecological consequences to the biodiversity and climate of the region.

During the last two decades of the 20th century, and due mainly to European agricultural policies (CAP), many farmers substituted forestry for livestock farming, so as to avoid unemployment and poverty. This provoked a surge of eucalyptus – see eucalyptus article on Spanish Wikipedia – plantations (and to a less extent of pines) which often hid the illegal destruction of native forests, just as the spread of livestock farming had done in the past by the endemic conversion of forest into prairie. These acts have been laxly controlled by the local councils or the central governments, in a process that clearly follows the saying: &quot;Pan para hoy, hambre para mañana&quot; (which translates as &#x27;Bread for today, hunger for tomorrow&#x27;; i.e., &quot;short-term gain, long-term pain&quot;).

The plantation of pines has given way in the last decades to that of eucalyptus because this non-indigenous species has no natural attacker within the European ecosystem (while pines are highly vulnerable to the pine processionary).
Both in relative and absolute terms the use of woods for forestry has increased in Cantabria, and is now almost 70% of all woods in the region.

*The foothills, from 500 to 1,100 metres altitude are colonized by monoculture forests of oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot; and &quot;Quercus petraea&quot;) on the sunnier slopes. In more shaded areas and especially from about 800 metres there are forests of European beech which are the main food source in winter for many animal species.

* The subalpine plane, in this high country, the plant life is composed of birch, scrub, and grasses which are especially important for the economy because during the summer they serve as pasture for grazing cattle and horses.

Along with these characteristics it would also be necessary to mention peculiarities of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Liébana, which has a microclimate very similar to the Mediterranean, allowing to grow cork oaks, vines and olives, and which is still very well conserved from human activity.
The other remarkable &quot;comarca&quot; is Campoo, in southern Cantabria, with its Pyrenean oak.

===Natural parks===

There are seven natural areas in this autonomous community designated as Natural or national parks:
*Picos de Europa National Park
*Collados del Asón Natural Park
*Santoña, Victoria and Joyel Marshes Natural Park
*Macizo de Peña Cabarga Natural Park
*Oyambre Natural Park
*Saja-Besaya Natural Park
*Dunes of Liencres Natural Park

The most important of these is the Picos de Europa National Park, which affects Castile and León and Asturias in addition to Cantabria, the three autonomous communities sharing its management. Santoña, Victoria and Joyel marshes are also Special Protection Areas for the birds (ZEPA).

Furthermore, nine Sites of Community Importance (LIC) have been declared: Western Mountain, Eastern Mountain, Western Rias and Oyambre Dunes, Dunes of Liencres and Estuary of the Pas, El Puntal Dunes and Estuary of the Miera, Ria de Ajo, Marshes of Noja-Santoña, Escudo de Cabuérniga Range and several caves with important bat colonies.
==Demographics==


According to the 2009 census, the region has a population of 591,886 which constitutes 1.29% of the population of Spain, with the population density numbering 106.8 people per kilometer. The average life expectancy for male inhabitants is 75 years; for female inhabitants, it is 83 years. Eight years later in 2017 the population has fallen to 581,477 according to INE.

In relative contrast to other regions of Spain, Cantabria has not experienced much immigration. In 2007, only 4.7% of the population were immigrants. The predominant countries of origin for immigrants to Cantabria are Colombia, Romania, Ecuador, Peru, Moldova, and Morocco.

The majority of the population resides in the coastal area, particularly in two cities: Santander, with 183,000 people, and Torrelavega, the second largest urban and industrial centre in Cantabria, having a population of around 60,000. These two cities form a conurbation known as the Santander-Torrelavega metropolitan area. Castro Urdiales has an official population of 28,542, making it the fourth largest in the region because of its proximity to the Bilbao metropolitan area, there are a large number of people not registered in Castro Urdiales, and the true count may be double the official figure.

The most populated municipalities of Cantabria as of 2018 are the following:
# Santander (pop. 172,044)
# Torrelavega (pop. 51,687)
#Castro-Urdiales (pop. 31,977)
# Camargo (pop. 30,263)
# Piélagos (pop. 25,223)
# El Astillero (pop. 18,108)
#Santa Cruz de Bezana (pop. 12,964)
# Laredo (pop. 11,148)
#Santoña (pop. 11,050)
# Los Corrales de Buelna (pop. 10,910)
# Reinosa (pop. 9,095)

==History==
===Roman Empire===

The first written reference to the name Cantabria emerges around 195 BC, in which the historian Cato the Elder speaks in his book &quot;Origines&quot; about the source of the Ebro River in the country of the Cantabri:

There are about 150 references to Cantabria or the Cantabri in surviving Greek and Latin texts. The Cantabri were used as mercenaries in various conflicts, both within the Iberian Peninsula and elsewhere. It is certain that they participated in the Second Punic War, from references by Silius Italicus and Horace. When C. Hostilius Mancinus was besieging Numantia, he withdrew upon learning that Cantabri and Vaccaei were present among his auxiliaries. The Cantabrian Wars began in They were defeated by Agrippa with great slaughter in , but they revolted again under Tiberius and were never entirely subdued.

In older geographers, the term Cantabria referred to an expansive country bounded by the Cantabrian Sea (the Bay of Biscay), the western side of the Sella valley in Asturias, the hillfort of Peña Amaya in Burgos, and along the Aguera River almost as far as Castro Urdiales. It thus included areas of Asturias, Santander, Biscay, and Guipuzcoa. Following the Roman conquest of Spain, however, it was restricted to the area of Santander and eastern Asturias, forming a part of Hispania Tarraconensis (&quot;Tarragonan Spain&quot;). The principal tribes of the area were the Pleutauri, the Varduli, the Autrigones, the Tuisi, and the Conisci or Concaui, who were known for feeding on their horses&#x27; blood. The area was well settled, with the largest city being Juliobriga, and the local mountains exploited for lead mines.

===Middle Ages===

Following the collapse of the Roman Empire, Cantabria regained its independence from the rule of the Visigoths. In 574, King Liuvigild attacked Cantabria and managed to capture the south of the country, including the city of Amaya, where he established a Visigothic province called the Duchy of Cantabria (see picture), which would serve as a limes or frontier zone to contain the Cantabri as well as their neighbors the Vascones. To the north of this cordon, however, the Cantabri continued to live independently until the Arab invasion. In 714, a mixed Arab/Berber army of Muslim Moors invaded the upper valleys of the Ebro and succeeded in capturing Amaya, the Cantabrian capital, forcing the Cantabrians back to their traditional frontiers, where they joined forces with the Kingdom of Asturias. In the first chronicles of the Reconquista, Cantabria still appears to be acknowledged as a region. In the &quot;Albendense Chronicle&quot;, when speaking of Alfonso I, it says, &quot;This was the son of Peter, the duke of Cantabria&quot;.

During the 9th century, on mentioning the monastery of Saint Zacharias, in a letter sent to Wiliesind, bishop of Pamplona, Eulogius of Córdoba pinpoints it in &quot;Seburim&quot; (maybe Zubiri) on the river Arga, &quot;waters all of Cantabria&quot;, suggesting a region stretching out far into the east. From this period on, source documents barely reference Cantabria by name, with &quot;Asturias&quot; featuring in names of the &quot;comarcas&quot; called &quot;Asturias de Santillana&quot;, &quot;Asturias de Trasmiera&quot; and &quot;Asturias de Laredo&quot;.
From a central core formed by the &quot;Hermandad de las Cuatro Villas&quot; (&quot;Brotherhood of the Four Cities&quot;) (Santander, Laredo, Castro Urdiales and San Vicente de la Barquera), the &quot;Hermandad de las Marismas&quot; (&quot;Brotherhood of the Marshes&quot;) was created, thereby uniting all the important seaports to the East of Asturias. During the period of the Reconquista, the Four Cities actively participated in the re-settling of Andalusia, dispatching men and ships. The coastal port cities of Cádiz and El Puerto de Santa María were settled by families from the Cantabrian Sea ports. Ships from the Four Cities took part in the taking of Seville, destroying the ship bridge linking Triana and Sevilla, a victory that is represented by the Carrack and the Torre del Oro of Sevilla in the coat of arms of Santander, Coat of arms of Cantabria and Avilés (Asturias).

===16th to 18th centuries===

In the 16th century, the name &quot;La Montaña&quot; (&quot;The Mountain&quot;) was widespread in popular usage and in literature, as a designation of the Ancient Cantabria, as opposed to Castile, which referred solely to the Central Plateau. This distinction has survived into modern times.
With the rise of the Catholic Monarchs, the Brethren of the Marshes disappeared, leaving the Coregiment of the Four Villas, which included the whole area of influence of the old Brethren of the Four Villas (almost all of Cantabria). During the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, the greatest jurisdictional lordships of Cantabria were mainly under the control of three of the Grandee families of Spain: that of Mendoza (Dukes of Infantado, Marquises of Santillana), of Manrique de Lara (Marquises of Aguilar de Campoo, Counts of Castañeda), and to a lesser extent that of Velasco (Dukes of Frías, Constables of Castile).

From the 16th century on, there was renewed interest in studying Cantabria and the Cantabri, particularly concerning the precise location of the territory that this people had occupied. It was not until the 18th century that the debate about the location and size of Ancient Cantabria was settled in a series of works which described the history of the region such as &quot;La Cantabria&quot; by the Augustinian father and historian Enrique Flórez de Setién. Concurrent with the resurgence of this interest in the Cantabrians and the clarification of the aforementioned polemic, many institutions, organizations and jurisdictions in the mountainous territory received the name of &quot;Cantabrian&quot; or &quot;of Cantabria&quot;.

In 1727, the first attempt to unify what would later become the province of Cantabria occurred. Despite this, the high level of autonomy that the small entities of the fractured estate of Cantabria enjoyed, combined with a lack of resources, continued to be the main reason for Cantabria&#x27;s weakness, aggravated by the progressive advance of the Bourbonic centralism and its administrative efficiency. The latter continually emphasised the impossibility of the smaller territories facing a multitude of problems on their own: from communications to the exercise of justice, from putting aside adequate reserves for hard times to the indiscriminate levees for soldiers, and above all the progression of fiscal impositions. All of this led to an acceleration of contact between villas, valleys and jurisdictions, which tended to focus on the Assemblies of the provinces of the Nine Valleys, led by the deputies elected by the traditional entities of self-government.

There were two events that triggered the culmination of the integration process in this second attempt:
*On the one hand, the collective interest in avoiding making contributions to the reconstruction of the bridge of Miranda de Ebro, imposed by order of the Intendant of Burgos on 11 July 1775, the same year that Cantabria suffered two tremendous floods, on 20 June and on 3 November. There was a need to face as the banditry that operated with impunity in Cantabria as a result of a lack of local juridical resources. After the General Deputy of Nine Valleys gathered the affected jurisdictions to the assembly that was to take place in Puente San Miguel on 21 March 1777, they sent their respective deputies with sufficient authority to join with the Nine Valleys.

In this General Assembly a framework was established and formal steps began to be taken, leading to administrative and legal unity in 1778. This all culminated in the success of the Assembly held in the Assembly House of &quot;Puente San Miguel&quot; on 28 July 1778, where the province of Cantabria was constituted. It was achieved by passing the common ordinances which had been developed to that end, and which had been discussed and approved previously in councils of all the villas, valleys and subscribed jurisdictions. They were, in addition to the Nine Valleys: Rivadedeva, Peñamellera, the province of Liébana, Peñarrubia, Lamasón, Rionansa, the Villa of San Vicente de la Barquera, Coto de Estrada, Valdáliga, the Villa of Santillana del Mar, Lugar de Viérnoles, the Villa of Cartes and environs, the Valley of Buelna, the Valley of Cieza, the Valley of Iguña with the Villas of San Vicente and Los Llares, the Villa of Pujayo, the Villa of Pie de Concha y Bárcena, the Valley of Anievas, and the Valley of Toranzo.
Having learned lessons from the failed attempt of 1727, the first objective of the new entity was to obtain approval from King Charles III for the union of all the Cantabrian jurisdictions into one province. The royal ratification was granted on 22 November 1779.

The 28 jurisdictions that initially comprised the province of Cantabria were clear in their intention that all the other jurisdictions that formed the &quot;Party and Baton of the Four Villas of the Coast&quot; should be included in the new province. To this end they set out the steps needed for this to happen as soon as those jurisdictions should request it. They would have to abide by the ordinances, having the same rights and duties as the founders, all on an equal footing. Thus, the following joined in quick succession: the Abbey of Santillana, the Valleys of Tudanca, Polaciones, Herrerías, Castañeda, the Villa of Torrelavega and environs, Val de San Vicente, Valle de Carriedo, Tresviso, and the Pasiegan Villas of La Vega, San Roque and San Pedro, as well as the city of Santander with its abbey.

Competition between the townships of Laredo and Santander led to the latter, having initially allowed the name of Cantabria for the province created at the beginning of the 19th century, later retracting its consent and demanding that it bear the name of Santander, so there would be no doubt as to which was the capital. When in 1821 the Provincial Council presented before the constitutional Courts its definitive plan for the provincial borders and legal entities, it proposed the name of province of Cantabria, to which the Township of Santander replied that &quot;this province must retain the name of Santander&quot;. However, many newspapers still showed in their headings the name of Cantabria, or Cantabrian.

===19th century===
During the War of Independence (1808–1814), Bishop Rafael Tomás Menéndez de Luarca, a strong defender of absolutism, promoted himself as the &quot;Regent of Cantabria&quot; and established the &quot;Cantabrian Armaments&quot; in Santander, a section of the army whose purpose was to travel to all the mountain passes from the Central Plateau to detain any French troop.

Although defeated, he managed later to regroup in Liébana under the command of General Juan Díaz Porlier, calling his forces the &quot;Cantabrian Division&quot;, in which there were various regiments and battalions, such as the &quot;Hussars of Cantabria&quot; (cavalry) or the &quot;Shooters of Cantabria&quot; (infantry). During the Carlist wars they formed a unit called the &quot;Cantabrian Brigade&quot;.

===20th century===

The use of terms with ancestral resonance through the 18th and 19th centuries continued during the 20th century, taking on a political tone that was distinctly regionalist, until 1936. In fact, the &quot;Republican Federal Party&quot; produced an autonomy statute for a Cantabrian-Castilian Federal State that year, which would include present-day Cantabria and any neighbouring areas from Castile and Asturias willing to join it. It could not be passed because of the Civil War. Following the war and the subsequent marginalization of such efforts under the Francoists regime, the use of the name of Cantabria decreased, to the point that for official purposes it was relegated to sports associations, the only arena in which Cantabria was noted as a region.

In 1963, the president of the Provincial Council, Pedro Escalante y Huidobro, proposed reapplying the name of Cantabria to the Province of Santander, as suggested in an academic report written by the historian Tomás Maza Solano. Although further steps were taken and many of the townships were in favour of the move, the petition did not succeed, mostly due to the opposition of Santander City Council. On 30 December 1981, a process that had been started in April 1979 by the Council of Cabezón de la Sal, under the presidency of Ambrosio Calzada Hernández, culminated in the granting of self-rule to Cantabria, outlined in Article 143 of the Spanish Constitution.
Cantabria based its claim to autonomy on the constitutional precept that made provision for self-government for &quot;provinces with a historic regional character&quot;.

A Mixed Assembly formed out of provincial deputies and national members of parliament began the task of drawing up an Autonomy Statute on 10 September 1979. Following the approval of the General Courts on 15 December 1981, the King of Spain signed the corresponding Organic Law of Autonomy Statute for Cantabria on 30 December of the same year. Thus, the province of Santander broke its link to Castile, and left the former region of Castile and León to which it had belonged up to that time, together with the provinces of Ávila, Burgos, León, Logroño, Palencia, Salamanca, Segovia, Soria, Valladolid and Zamora.

On 20 February 1982, the first Regional Assembly (now Parliament) was formed, with provisional status. From this time, the former province of Santander has been known as Cantabria and has thereby regained its historic name. The first home-rule elections were held in May 1983. The 4th Legislature (1995–1999) brought into effect the first great reform of the Autonomy Statute of Cantabria, approved by all the parliamentary groups.

==Government and administration==
The Autonomy Statute of Cantabria of 30 December 1981, established that Cantabria has in its institutions the desire to respect fundamental rights and public freedom, at the same time as consolidating and stimulating regional development through democratic channels. This document gathers all competences of the Autonomous Community that were transferred from the Government of Spain. As in other Autonomous Communities, some competences were not transferred, for example, Justice. The Statute also defines the symbols that should represent the region: The flag, the coat of arms and the anthem of Cantabria.

The Parliament of Cantabria is the principal self-government institution of the Autonomous Community, being the representative body of the Cantabrians. Presently it is constituted by thirty-nine deputies elected by universal, equal, free, direct and secret suffrage. The primary functions of the Parliament are: to exercise the legislative power, to approve the budgets of the Autonomous Community, to motivate and control the actions of the government, and to develop the rest of the competences that the Spanish Constitution, the Autonomy Statute and the rest of the legal order bestow on it. The President of the Autonomous Community holds the highest representation of the Community and ordinary representation of the Country in Cantabria, and presides over the Government, coordinating its activities.

The Government of Cantabria is the body in charge of directing the political activities and exercising the executive and regulatory powers according to the Constitution, the Statute and the laws. The Government is made up of the President, the Vicepresident (in which the President can delegate his executive functions and representations) and the Councillors, who are appointed and ceased by the President.

After several legislatures presided by the Partido Popular or by Juan Hormaechea&#x27;s UPCA, the Regional Government of Cantabria was directed by a coalition of the Regionalist Party of Cantabria and Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) from year 2003 until 2011. The President was Miguel Ángel Revilla of Partido Regionalista de Cantabria (PRC), and the Vice President was Dolores Gorostiaga of the PSOE. As a result of the absolute majority of the Partido Popular in the regional elections of 2011, the president from 2011 to 2015 was Ignacio Diego Palacios, and the Vice President was also the healthcare Councillor, Maria José Sáenz de Buruaga. After the 2015 regional elections, Miguel Ángel Revilla of Partido Regionalista de Cantabria (PRC) was invested president for a third tenure with the support of PSOE.

==Territorial organization==
The autonomous community of Cantabria is structured in &quot;municipios&quot; (municipalities) and &quot;comarcas&quot; (regions).

===Municipalities===

There are 102 municipalities in Cantabria generally comprising several townships, and from these, several districts. A number of municipalities bear the name of one of their townships (be it its capital or not), but not all them do. Each municipality is governed by its own city or municipal council, and two of them, Tresviso and Pesquera, did it by &quot;concejo abierto&quot; (&quot;open council&quot;) until 2011, having fewer than 250 inhabitants.

The Mancomunidad Campoo-Cabuérniga is not a municipality, but a communal property, singular for its size and characteristics, of shared management between the municipalities of Hermandad de Campoo de Suso, Cabuérniga, Los Tojos and Ruente. This mountain estate is used as a grazing ground for Tudanca cattle and also for horses in less amount, in its &quot;brañas&quot; or grass prairies, and even nowadays transhumant cattle farming traditions survive in this region.

*List of municipalities in Cantabria

===&quot;Comarcas&quot; (regions)===
The Cantabrian legislation divides the autonomous community in administrative regions called &quot;comarcas&quot;, but traditionally, other subdivisions of the territory have been used.

*Administrative regions
&quot;Law 8/1999 of &quot;Comarcas&quot; of the Autonomous Community of Cantabria&quot; of 28 April 1999 establishes that the comarca is a necessary entity, integral in the territorial organization of the region. This law opens the development of the &quot;comarcalization&quot; in Cantabria promoting the creation of &quot;comarcal&quot; entities, which have barely begun to appear. The law establishes that the creation of comarcas will not become mandatory for the whole territory until at least the 70% of it had not been &quot;comarcalized&quot; by its own will. It also adds that Santander will not ruled by comarcalization and should establish its own metropolitan area instead.

&quot;Comarcas&quot; in Cantabria have not reached administrative nature and barely have definite borders. Only Liébana for its geographic position in Picos de Europa, Trasmiera and Campoo, in the Ebro basin are established are clearly defined &quot;comarcas&quot; in the region. Nevertheless, functional differences in the territory can be distinguished, dividing it in the following areas: Santander Bay, of industrial and urban nature; Besaya, also industrial; Saja-Nansa, eminently rural; Western Coast, which has urban character; Eastern Coast, vacational; the traditionally renowned Trasmiera; rural Pas-Miera; Asón-Agüera, also mainly rural; the very well defined Liébana, and Campoo-Los Valles, rural and industrial by regions.

*Natural regions (regarding geographical features)
**Coastal strip
**Central strip (Cantabrian valleys perpendicular to the coast): Liébana, Saja and Nansa, Besaya, Pas and Miera (or Valles Pasiegos), and Asón-Gándara valleys.
**Southern strip (Rivers Ebro and Duero&#x27;s basins): Campoo and Southern valleys
*Historic regions
Until the 13th century, Cantabria was organized in valleys, as was typical in all of northern Spain. From then on, it was substituted by the organization in cities, towns or historic &quot;comarcas&quot; that grouped several valleys.

==Economy==
The economy of Cantabria has a primary sector, now in decline, employing 5.8% of the active population in the industries of cattle farming, traditional dairy farming, and meat production; agriculture, especially corn, potatoes, vegetables, and roughage; maritime fishing; and the mining of zinc and quarries.

The secondary sector which employs 30.3% of the active population is the sector with the most productivity in recent years due to construction; that of ironworking (Reinosa being the most important city), food service (milk, meat, vegetables and seafood), chemistry (Solvay, Sniace), paper production (Sinace, Papelera del Besaya), textile fabrication (Textil Santanderina in Cabezón de la Sal), pharmacy (Moehs in Requejada), industrial groups and transport, etc. The service sector employs 63.8% of the active population and is increasing, given that large concentrations of the population live in the urban centers and the importance that tourism has acquired in the recent years. As of July 2014, the unemployment rate in Cantabria is 19.3%, compared to 24.47% in Spain; while as of April 2010 its purchasing power parity was €25,326, compared to €26,100 in Spain and €25,100 in the EU25. In 2007, Cantabria&#x27;s growth of real GDP was 4.1%, compared to a 3.9% average for Spain. The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 13.8 billion € in 2018. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €25,500 or 84% of the EU27 average in the same year.

==Transportation and communications==

The most significant consequence of the strong relief of the Cantabrian territory is the existence of topographic barriers that condition decisively the courses of the linking infrastructures, as much in the north–south orientation in the accesses to the Castilian Mesa, as in the east–west in the communication between valleys. Moreover, the cost of their construction and maintenance is much higher than average.

The main communications infrastructures of the region are:
* Santander Airport
* Cantabrian Motorway (Autovía A-8, European route E-70)
* Cantabria-Meseta Motorway (Autovía A-67)
* Narrow-gauge railway Santander-Oviedo (Renfe Feve)
* Narrow-gauge railway Santander-Bilbao (Renfe Feve)
* Broad-gauge railway Santander-Palencia-Valladolid-Ávila-Madrid (Renfe)
* Broad-gauge high-speed railway Santander-Torrelavega-Valladolid-Segovia-Madrid (Renfe)
* Ferry line Santander-Plymouth

==Mass media and public opinion==

In Cantabria, there are two daily regional newspapers in addition to the national ones: &quot;El Diario Montañés&quot; and &quot;Alerta&quot;, as well as many weekly, fortnightly and monthly publications. The main national radio stations have transmitter stations in places like Santander, Torrelavega, Castro-Urdiales, or Reinosa. There are also numerous local and regional stations. For the moment, there is no Cantabrian autonomic television with public financing, although some local channels exist (including Canal 8 DM, TeleBahía, Telecabarga, Localia TV Cantabria, etc.). In recent years, the Internet has allowed new informative proposals to emerge in the shape of digital diaries or blogs, which contribute to enrich the mediatic panorama of the region.

==Culture==
===Language===
Spanish is the official language of Cantabria. The eastern part of Cantabria contributed to the origins of Medieval Spanish in a significant way. In western areas, there are remnants of the Cantabrian language, also called &quot;montañés&quot;, and it is also somewhat preserved in parts of the Pas and Soba valleys in its eastern zone. Cantabrian can be viewed as a dialect of the wider Astur-Leonese language continuum, and is mutually intelligible with varieties in neighbouring Asturias.

===Monuments and museums===

*Caves: Altamira Cave, El Soplao, Del Valle, El Pendo, La Pasiega Cave, Las Monedas, El Castillo, Morín, and others.
*Civil architecture: Magdalena palace in Santander; Capricho de Gaudí, Pontifical University of Comillas and Sobrellano palace in Comillas; Bárcena palace in Ampuero; Castle of Argüeso in Campoo; Hornillos palace in Las Fraguas del Besaya; etc.

===Fairs and festivals===

Regarding the fairs, understood as big markets of products periodically celebrated, it is remarkable the &quot;Livestock Fair of Torrelavega&quot; taking place in the National Livestock Market &quot;Jesús Collado Soto&quot;, the third biggest of Spain, that groups the buy and sell of all kinds of cattle in the region itself and the adjacent ones, being the bovine the main product. All over the region cattle and typical products fairs are celebrated weekly, monthly, or annually to gather the neighbours of the land. There are many different festivities in Cantabria, some of them limited just to small villages, but there are also festivals that attract tourism from all over the country. The most important are the following:

*&quot;La Vijanera&quot; (Winter Carnival), celebrated during the first Sunday of the year in Silió. It celebrates the end of the short winter days and the arrival of the sun. The representation of a white bear hunt takes place all over this little village. The traditional dressing of the characters in the play, the trapajones and the zarramacos, is one of its main features.
*&quot;Carnaval marinero&quot; (Sailor Carnival), in February in Santoña. Commonly known as &quot;the carnivals of the North&quot;, in this carnival, started in 1934, many people of the town participate dressing themselves up as fish. The main event is the &quot;Trial at the bottom of the ocean&quot;, where the &quot;besugo&quot; is judged before the last act, &quot;The burning of the &quot;besugo&quot;&quot;. (A &quot;besugo&quot; is a foolish person besides a type of fish).
*&quot;La Folía&quot;, April in San Vicente de la Barquera, a parade of local fishing boats following one with a statue of the Virgin.
*&quot;Coso Blanco&quot;, first Friday in July in Castro Urdiales. Colorful parade with carts.
*&quot;Cantabria Day&quot;, second Sunday of August in Cabezón de la Sal. Traditional Cantabrian music, ceramics fair, local foods, bolo palma championships, ox dragging contests and public speeches.
*SAUGA folk music festival, celebrated the third weekend of August in Colindres.
*&quot;Floral Gala&quot;, August en Torrelavega. A festival of international touristic importance with carts decorated with flowers.
*&quot;Battle of Flowers&quot;, August, in Laredo. Carts decorated with flowers and fruit. Fireworks in the evening.
*&quot;Campoo Day&quot;, September in Reinosa. Tourist fair of regional importance since 1977 and celebrated since the 19th century, it shows customs and traditions of the Campurrians in their capital. Cattle shows, local products market and regional costumes are the items in this festival.

The following festivals are also remarkable in modern Cantabrian culture: Santander International Festival (Arts festival), Santander Summer Festival (Music festival), Sotocine (Film festival)

===Mythology===
The north of the Spanish state is a rich area for mythology. From Galicia to the Basque Country, passing by Asturias and Cantabria, there are rites, stories and imaginary or impossible beings.

Cantabrian lore turns its forests and mountains into magical places where the myths, beliefs and legends have been present as an essential part of the Cantabrian culture, either because they have been living in the popular heritage through the oral tradition transmitted from father to son, or because they have been recovered by scholars (Manuel Llano and others) who have worried about preserving the cultural heritage.
Its mythology and superstitions present a great Celtic influence that has diluted with the pass of time, being romanized or Christianized in many cases.

There is a heavy presence of fabulous beings of giant proportions and Cyclopean features (the &quot;ojáncanos&quot;), fantastic animals (&quot;culebres&quot;, &quot;caballucos del diablu&quot; (lit. horses of the devil, damselflies), &quot;ramidrejus&quot;, etc.), færies (&quot;anjanas&quot;, &quot;ijanas&quot; of Aras), duendes (&quot;nuberos, ventolines, trentis, trasgus, trastolillos, musgosu, tentiruju&quot;), anthropomorphic characters (the &quot;sirenuca&quot; (little mermaid), the fish-man, the cuegle, the wife-bear of Andara, the &quot;guajona&quot;), etc.

==Cuisine==
*Typical dishes: &quot;Cocido montañés&quot; (&quot;Highlander stew&quot;) made with beans and collard greens; &quot;cocido lebaniego&quot; (&quot;Liébanan stew&quot;) made from chickpeas and marmita).
*Meat dishes: Beef, ox, deer, roe deer or boar. Cooked on the grill, stewed or with vegetables.
:The livestock farming reputation of the region and its climatological conditions favouring cattle breeding allowed the European Union to pass the &quot;Meats of Cantabria&quot; denomination as a &quot;Protected Geographic Denomination&quot; for the beef of certain kinds of native races (&quot;Tudanca&quot;, &quot;Monchina&quot;) and others adapted to the environment or integrated by assimilation (&quot;Brown Alpine&quot;).

*Fish and seafood: Anchovies, angler, hake, sea bass, sole, mackerel, sardine, European anchovies, bonito of the North (of Spain), gilt-head bream, sea bream, red mullet, and scorpionfish, as well as some river fish such as trout and salmon. &quot;Rabas&quot; (fried calamari) and &quot;cachón en su tinta&quot; (cuttlefish cooked in its own ink) are local specialties. Clam, mussel, muergos (jackknife), cockle, velvet crab, spider crab, goose barnacle, periwinkle, Norway lobster and European lobster are available.
*Desserts: &quot;Quesadas&quot; and &quot;sobaos&quot; of the Pas valley; Unquera&#x27;s Corbatas and Torrelavega&#x27;s polkas (both basically puff pastry); Palucos de Cabezón de la Sal; and Pantortillas of Reinosa.

==Sports==
The traditional sport of Cantabria is the game of &quot;bolos&quot; (skittles) in its four forms: &quot;bolo palma&quot;, &quot;pasabolo tablón&quot;, &quot;pasabolo losa&quot; and &quot;bolo pasiego&quot;. The first one is the most widespread, exceeding regional nature and reaching the eastern zone of Asturias and also being the most complex in its game rules. The existence of &quot;boleras&quot; or skittle rings is important in every Cantabrian township, often being near the church or the village pub. Since the late 1980s, skittle play has consolidated with the reinforcement of skittle schools, revamped by different town councils and Cantabrian institutions, various competitions, and media coverage.

The remo (rowing) is a very traditional sport in the coastal towns. The origins of rowing in Cantabria go back many centuries, when several &quot;traineras&quot; (traditional fishing longboats) competed for the selling of the caught fish, which was reserved for the first ship to arrive to the fish market. At the end of the 19th century, work became sport and people started to celebrate regattas between Cantabrian townships. The sport clubs of Cantabria, especially the Astillero, Castro Urdiales, and the Pedreña belong to the most prize-winning teams of the history of this sport, and nowadays they are having one of the best moments after a decades-long period of trophy drought.
The Pasiegan jump is another of the outstanding rural sports of the region and a clear example of how the use of a work skill that disappears with the pass of time, gives rise to games and competition. Similar to other forms, like the Canarian shepherd jump, in the beginning this technique was used in the Pasiegan valleys to cross the stone walls, the fences, the creeks or the ravines that bordered the fields and obstructed the pass in the abrupt geography of the highland areas of Cantabria.

Referring to mass sports, Cantabria is present in national and international competitions through teams such as the &quot;Racing de Santander&quot;, the &quot;RS Gimnástica de Torrelavega&quot; and the Cantabria autonomous football team in football or the &quot;Independiente RC&quot; in rugby union. The &quot;Club Balonmano Cantabria&quot; that won Leagues and King&#x27;s Cups as well as IHF Super Globe, EHF Champions League, EHF Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and EHF Cup in handball or the Cantabria Lobos that played in the ACB in basketball represented the highest level of the Cantabrian sport in the recent past.

<doc id="69607" wikidata="Q235080" url="?curid=69607" title="Alfonso VI of León and Castile">
<text>Alfonso VI (1 July 1109), nicknamed the Brave (&quot;El Bravo&quot;) or the Valiant, was king of León (10651109), Galicia (10711109), and Castile (10721109).

After the conquest of Toledo in 1085, Alfonso proclaimed himself (most victorious king of Toledo, and of Spain and Galicia). This conquest, along with El Cid&#x27;s taking of Valencia would greatly expand the territory and influence of the Leonese/Castilian realm, but also provoked an Almoravid invasion that Alfonso would spend the remainder of his reign resisting. The Leonese and Castilian armies suffered decisive defeats in the battles of Sagrajas (1086), Consuegra (1097) and Uclés (1108), in the latter of which his only son and heir, Sancho Alfónsez, died, and Valencia was abandoned but Toledo remained part of an expanded realm that he passed to his daughter.

==Life==
===Birth and early years===
The son of Ferdinand I, King of León and Count of Castile and his wife, Queen Sancha, Alfonso was a &quot;Leonese &quot;infante&quot; [prince] with Navarrese and Castilian blood&quot;. His paternal grandparents were Sancho Garcés III, king of Pamplona and his wife Muniadona of Castile, and his maternal grandparents were Alfonso V of León (after whom he was probably named) and his first wife Elvira Menéndez.

The year of Alfonso&#x27;s birth is not recorded in the medieval documentation. According to one of the authors of the &quot;Anonymous Chronicle of Sahagún&quot;, who met the monarch and was present at his death, he died at age 62 after reigning 44 years. This indicates that he was born in the second half of 1047 or in the first half of 1048. Pelagius of Oviedo wrote that Alfonso was 79 when he died, but that would place his birth around 1030, before his parents&#x27; marriage.

According to the &quot;Historia silense&quot;, the eldest child of Ferdinand I and Sancha, a daughter called Urraca, was born when her parents were still Count and Countess of Castile, so her birth could be placed in 1033–34. The second child and eldest son, Sancho, must have been born in the second half of 1038 or in 1039. The third child and second daughter, Elvira, may have been born in 1039–40, followed by Alfonso in 1040–41, and finally the youngest of the siblings, García, sometime between 1041 and 24 April 1043, the date on which King Ferdinand I, in a donation to the Abbey of San Andrés de Espinareda, mentions his five children. All of them except Elvira signed a document in the monastery of San Juan Bautista de Corias on 26 April 1046.

All the children of King Ferdinand I, according to the &quot;Historia silense&quot;, were educated in the liberal arts, and the sons were also trained in arms, the &quot;art of running horses in the Spanish usage&quot;, and hunting. The cleric Raimundo was in charge of Alfonso&#x27;s early education. Once king, Alfonso appointed him Bishop of Palencia and referred to him as &quot;magistro nostro, viro nobile et Deum timenti&quot; (&quot;our master, a noble man who fears God&quot;). Alfonso probably spent long periods in Tierra de Campos, where, along with Pedro Ansúrez, the son of Ansur Díaz and nephew of Count Gómez Díaz de Saldaña (both members of the Banu Gómez lineage), he learned the art of war and what was expected of a knight.

===Ascension to the throne===
As the second son of the king of León and count of Castile, Alfonso would not have been entitled to inherit the throne. At the end of 1063, probably on 22 December, taking advantage of the fact that numerous magnates had gathered in León, capital of the kingdom, for the consecration of the Basílica of San Isidoro, Ferdinand I summoned a &quot;Curia Regia&quot; to make known his testamentary dispositions, under which he decided to distribute his patrimony among his children, a distribution that would not become effective until the death of the monarch in order to prevent any disputes arising after his death:

*Alfonso inherited the Kingdom of León, &quot;the most extensive, valuable and emblematic part: the one that contained the cities of Oviedo and León, cradles of the Asturian-Leonese monarchy&quot;, which included Asturias, León, Astorga, El Bierzo, Zamora with Tierra de Campos as well as the &quot;parias&quot; of the Taifa of Toledo.
*His elder brother, Sancho, was given the Kingdom of Castile, created by his father for him, and the &quot;parias&quot; of the Taifa of Zaragoza.
*His younger brother, García, received the entire region of Galicia, &quot;elevated to the rank of kingdom&quot; that extended south to the Mondego River in Portugal with the &quot;parias&quot; of the Taifa of Badajoz and Seville.
*Their sisters, Urraca and Elvira, both received the &quot;Infantazgo&quot;, that is, &quot;the patronage and income of all the monasteries belonging to the royal patrimony&quot; on the condition that they remained unmarried.

The historian Alfonso Sánchez Candeira suggests that the reasons leading King Ferdinand I to divide the kingdom (with Alfonso VI inheriting the royal title) are unknown, but the distribution was probably made because the king considered it proper that each son should inherit the region where he had been educated and spent his early years.

===Reign===
====Consolidation of the throne (10651072)====
After his coronation in the city of León in January 1066, Alfonso VI had to confront the expansionist desires (although Alfonso would prove himself as having the same or more so) of his brother Sancho II, who, as the eldest son, considered himself the sole legitimate heir of all the kingdoms of their father. The conflicts began after the death of their mother Queen Sancha on 7 November 1067, leading to seven years of war among the three brothers. The first skirmish was the Battle of Llantada, a trial by ordeal in which both brothers agreed that the one who was victorious would obtain the kingdom of the defeated brother. Although Sancho II was the winner, Alfonso VI did not comply with the agreement; even so, relations between them remained cordial as evidenced by the fact that Alfonso was present at the wedding of Sancho II to an English noblewoman named Alberta on 26 May 1069. This was the same event where both decided to join forces to divide between themselves the Kingdom of Galicia that had been assigned to their younger brother García II. In the wake of the fratricidal war waged between the successors of al-Muzaffar, ruler of the taifa of Badajoz, upon the latter&#x27;s death in 1068, Alfonso managed to exploit the situation in order to extract economic profit, even though the taifa nominally fell under García&#x27;s sphere of influence.

With the complicity of Alfonso VI, Sancho II invaded Galicia in 1071, defeating their brother García II who was arrested in Santarém and imprisoned in Burgos until he was exiled to the Taifa of Seville, then under the rule of Al-Mu&#x27;tamid ibn Abbad. After eliminating their brother, Alfonso VI and Sancho II titled themselves kings of Galicia and signed a truce.

The truce was broken with the Battle of Golpejera on 12 January 1072. Although Sancho II&#x27;s troops were victorious, he decided not to persecute his brother Alfonso, who was imprisoned in Burgos and later transferred to the monastery of Sahagún, where his head was shaved and he was forced to wear a chasuble. Thanks to the intercession of their sister Urraca, Sancho and Alfonso reached an agreement under which Alfonso VI was able to take refuge in the Taifa of Toledo under the protection of his vassal Al-Mamun, accompanied by his childhood friend, the faithful Pedro Ansúrez and his two brothers Gonzalo and Fernando.

Alfonso VI, from his exile in Toledo, obtained the support of the Leonese nobility and his sister Urraca, who remained strong in the city of Zamora, a lordship that Ferdinand I had granted her previously. When Urraca refused to exchange Zamora for other cities that Sancho had offered her in an effort to control the fortress of Zamora, &quot;key to the future expansion south of the Duero&quot;, Sancho besieged the city. However, during the siege, Sancho II was murdered. According to tradition, during the siege a nobleman named Vellido Dolfos appeared before the king, claiming to have changed his loyalty from Urraca to Sancho. Under the pretense of showing him the weak parts of the city&#x27;s walls, Dolfos separated the king from his guard and killed him with a spear. Although there is no clear evidence that Sancho II&#x27;s death was due to treason rather than deceit, since Dolfos was Sancho II&#x27;s enemy, his murder occurred in a warlike attack during the siege, not near the city walls, but rather in a nearby forest where Dolfos lured the Castilian king away from his armed protection. The violent death of Sancho II, who had no descendants, allowed Alfonso VI to reclaim his throne as well as Sancho&#x27;s and Garcia&#x27;s original inheritances of Castile and Galicia, respectively.

Although Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar (El Cid), the standard-bearer and confidant of King Sancho II, was present at the siege of Zamora, the role he played in this event is not known. Neither can Sancho II&#x27;s death be blamed on Alfonso VI, who, when his brother was killed, was in exile far from the events. However, this did nothing to prevent speculation that Alfonso was somehow involved in Sancho&#x27;s murder; despite a paucity of evidence, &quot;minstrels and ballads filled this void with beautiful literary creations devoid of any historical reality&quot;.

The lingering suspicion over this event would later become part of the &quot;Leyenda de Cardeña&quot;, a set of legendary narrative materials concerning El Cid which began to develop in the 13th century.

According to legend, Alfonso VI was forced by El Cid to take an oath denying that he had been involved in his brother&#x27;s death, thus giving rise to mutual distrust between the two men, despite Alfonso VI&#x27;s efforts at rapprochement by offering his kinswoman Jimena Díaz to El Cid in marriage as well as the immunity of his patrimony. These events and their consequences would eventually come to be considered historical by many later chroniclers and historians; however, most modern historians deny that such an event ever took place.

Thanks to Sancho II&#x27;s death, García II could regain his own throne of Galicia; however, the following year, on 13 February 1073, Alfonso summoned García to a meeting, whereupon he imprisoned his younger brother. Garcia was held at the castle of Luna for seventeen years, where he eventually died on 22 March 1090. With his two brothers out of the way, Alfonso VI was able to secure the loyalty of both the high clergy and the nobility of his territories with ease; to confirm this, he spent the next two years visiting them.

====Territorial expansion (10721086)====
Now established on the Leonese throne, and with the title of &quot;Emperor&quot;, a relic of the Gothic tradition, Alfonso VI spent the following fourteen years of his reign expanding his territories through conquests such as that of Uclés and the lands of the Banu Di-l-Nun family. In 1072 he entitled himself &quot;rex Spanie&quot;.

In 1074, in alliance with Al-Mamun, ruler of the Taifa of Toledo, Alfonso waged an offensive against the Zirid ruler of the Taifa of Granada, Abd Allâh, taking the strategic fortress of Alcalá la Real.

Following the assassination of Sancho IV of Navarre in 1076, leaving only minor sons, the local Navarrese nobility divided over the succession to the Navareese crown. Alfonso VI had immediately taken possession of Calahorra and Najera, and also received the support of the nobility of Vizcaya-Álava and La Rioja, while the eastern nobility supported Sancho Ramírez of Aragon, who moved into the remainder of the kingdom. After the two kings reached an accord, Sancho Ramírez was recognized as king of Navarre and Alfonso VI annexed the territories of Álava, Vizcaya, part of Guipúzcoa and La Bureba, adopting in 1077 the title of &quot;Imperator totius Hispaniae&quot; (&quot;Emperor of all Spain&quot;).

His great territorial expansion came at the expense of the Taifa Muslim kingdoms. Alfonso VI continued their economic exploitation by means of the system of &quot;parias&quot;, and succeeded in subduing most of the Taifa kingdoms as his tributaries, enforced by the threat of military intervention. In 1074, he probably recovered payment of the &quot;parias&quot; of Toledo, and the same year, helped by troops of that city, he cut down trees on the lands of the Taifa of Granada, which consequently also began to pay him taxes. In 1076, the Emir of Zaragoza, who wished to seize Valencia without being disturbed by Alfonso VI, agreed to resume payment of the &quot;parias&quot;. In 1079, he conquered Coria.

One of the initiatives of these years, known as the &quot;Treason of Rueda&quot;, ended in failure. It took place in 1083 in the castle of Rueda de Jalón, when Alfonso VI received news that the governor of that stronghold, which belonged to the Taifa of Zaragoza, intended to surrender it to the Leonese king. The king&#x27;s troops were ambushed when they entered the castle and several of the most important magnates of the kingdom were killed.

In 1074, Alfonso VI&#x27;s vassal and friend Al-Mamun, king of the Taifa of Toledo died of poisoning in Córdoba, and was succeeded by his grandson Al-Qádir, who asked for help from the Leonese monarch to end an uprising against him. Alfonso VI took advantage of this request to besiege Toledo, which finally fell on 25 May 1085. After losing his throne, Al-Qádir was sent by Alfonso VI as king of the Taifa of Valencia under the protection of Álvar Fáñez. To facilitate this operation and to recover payment of the &quot;parias&quot; owed by the city, which had failed to pay him since the previous year, Alfonso VI besieged Zaragoza in the spring of 1086. In early March, Valencia accepted the rule of Al-Qádir; Xàtiva resisted requesting the aid of the rulers of Tortosa and Lérida until he was forced to do so. Their raid of the region failed, and they withdrew under harassment by the troops of Fáñez.

After this important conquest, Alfonso VI was entitled &quot;al-Imbraţūr dhī-l-Millatayn&quot; (&quot;Emperor of the Two Religions&quot;) and as a gesture to the important Muslim population of the city, he promised them, in addition to respecting their properties, the right to use the main mosque. This decision was later revoked by the newly appointed archbishop of Toledo, Bernard of Sédirac, who took advantage of the king&#x27;s absence from Toledo and with the support of Queen Constance.

The occupation of Toledo—which allowed Alfonso VI to incorporate the title of King of Toledo with those he already used ()—led to the taking of cities such as Talavera and fortresses including the castle of Aledo. He also occupied Mayrit (now Madrid) in 1085 without resistance, probably by capitulation. The incorporation of the territory situated between the Sistema Central and the Tajo river would serve as the base of operations for the Kingdom of León, from where he could launch more attacks against the Taifas of Cordoba, Seville, Badajoz and Granada.

====Almoravid invasions (10861109)====
The conquest of the extensive and strategic Taifa of Toledo, the control of Valencia and the possession of Aledo, which isolated Murcia from the rest of Al-Andalus, worried the Muslim sovereigns of the Iberian Peninsula. The military and economic pressure on the Taifa kingdoms led the rulers of the Taifas of Seville, Granada, Badajoz, and Almeria to seek help from Yusuf ibn Tashfin, the Almoravid Emir who ruled the Maghreb. At the end of July 1086, Almoravid troops crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and landed in Algeciras.

In Seville, the Almoravid army joined the troops of the Taifa kingdoms, and together they marched to Extremadura. There, on 23 October 1086, they faced the troops of Alfonso VI (who had to abandon the siege of Zaragoza) in the Battle of Sagrajas. Álvar Fáñez, who had been called from Valencia, came and joined the king&#x27;s forces. The battle ended with the defeat of the Christian troops, who returned to Toledo to defend themselves. The Emir, however, did not take advantage of the victory since he had to rush back to Africa because of the death of his son. The defeat marked the beginning of a new era in the Iberian Peninsula that lasted about three decades, in which the military initiative was taken by the Almoravids and Alfonso VI had to remain on the defensive. Nevertheless, he was able to retain Toledo, the main target of the Almoravid attacks.

Alfonso VI asked the Christian kingdoms of Europe to organize a Crusade against the Almoravids, who had recovered almost all the territories he had conquered, with the exception of Toledo, where the king remained strong. To reinforce his position, he reconciled with El Cid, who came to Toledo in late 1086 or early 1087. As a consequence of the serious defeat, the Andalusian taifas stopped paying the &quot;parias&quot;. The Cid, however, succeeded in re-subjugating the rebel Taifas over next two years.

Even though the crusade did not finally materialize, a large number of foreign knights came to the Iberian Peninsula. They included Raymond and Henry of Burgundy, who married Alfonso VI&#x27;s daughters Urraca (1090) and Teresa (1094), respectively, which led to the establishment of the Anscarid and Capetian dynasties in the peninsular kingdoms. Some of the crusaders unsuccessfully besieged Tudela in the winter of 1087, before withdrawing. That same year, the king crushed a revolt in Galicia aimed at releasing his brother García II.

In 1088 Yusuf ibn Tashfin crossed the Strait of Gibraltar for the second time, but was defeated at the siege of Aledo and suffered the desertion of many of the rulers of the taifas. When the emir came again to the peninsula, he decided to depose all the taifa rulers and became the sole king of the entire Al-Andalus territory. Thanks to the Muslim defeat in Aledo, Alfonso VI had been able to resume the collection of the &quot;parias&quot; by threatening the ruler of the city that he would chop all the trees in the territory of Granada and then went to Seville to subjugate the city again. Abdallah ibn Buluggin of Granada had distanced himself definitively from Yusuf ibn Tashfin and Alfonso VI promised to help him in exchange for his submission.

In June 1090, the Almoravids launched a third attack, deposed the king of Granada, defeated the governor of Córdoba, and after the Battle of Almodóvar del Río, entered Seville and sent King al-Mutamid into exile. In the second half of the year, all the southern taifas had been conquered by the Almoravids and Alfonso was not able to fulfill his promise to help the king of Seville. The king suffered setbacks on all fronts: in the east he failed to seize Tortosa due to the late arrival of the Genoese fleet that was to take part in its capture; further south, Al-Qádir was deposed in a revolt; in the south, his relation with Zaida, daughter-in-law of the king of Seville failed to enhance his image as the champion of the Muslims of the peninsula against the Almoravids; and, finally, in the west, the alliance with the king of Badajoz did not stop the North Africans from conquering this territory. As the price for this alliance, Alfonso VI had obtained Lisbon, Sintra, and Santarém, but lost them in November 1094 when his son-in-law Raymond of Burgundy, responsible for defending these cities, was defeated by the Almoravid army that had taken Badajoz shortly before. The only good news for Alfonso VI was the recovery of Valencia in June by El Cid, who had defeated the Almoravid army that had advanced against him in the Battle of Cuarte on 21 October. This victory set the eastern border for about a decade.

According to some historians, Alfonso VI later defeated a conspiracy of his sons-in-law Raymond and Henry who had plotted to divide the kingdom at his death. To turn them against each other, he gave Henry and Teresa the government of the County of Portugal, until then ruled by Raymond, which comprised the lands from the Minho river to Santarém, while the government of Raymond was limited to Galicia. Other scholars, however, have shown that the pact could not have been made before 1103, suggesting instead that Henry&#x27;s appointment was made in response to the military defeat of 1094.
In 1097, there was a fourth Almoravid invasion. Alfonso received the news when he was on his way to Zaragoza to assist his vassal Al-Mustain II in his confrontation with King Peter I of Aragon and Navarre. Once again, the Almoravid objective was Toledo, and they defeated the Christian forces at the Battle of Consuegra on 15 August, thus confirming the decline of the reign of Alfonso VI that had begun in 1086 with the defeat at Sagrajas.

In 1099, the Almoravids conquered a large number of the castles that defended Toledo and the surrounding areas and, in the following year, they tried unsuccessfully to seize the city. Henry of Burgundy, Alfonso&#x27;s son-in-law, was in charge of defending Toledo since the king, at that time, was in Valencia inspecting its defenses. El Cid had died the previous year and his widow, Jimena, was governing the city.

In 1102, Alfonso VI sent troops to help Valencia against the Almoravid threat. The battle took place in Cullera and ended without a clear winner, although Valencia fell into Almoravid hands regardless because Alfonso decided it was too expensive to defend. Alfonso VI supervised the evacuation of Valencia in March and April and set fire to it before leaving; in May, the Almoravids took possession of the remains. The same year, he undertook the repopulation of Salamanca, which protected Coria, and Ávila, which defended the mountain pass that was more accessible from Guadarrama, trying to prepare for an eventual loss of Toledo. To protect the area from the east, in 1104 he besieged and conquered Medinaceli, a key location from which the region of Toledo could be attacked from the east along the valley of the Jalón River. In 1104, 1105, and 1106, the king made several incursions into Andalusian territory, reaching Málaga in 1106, and returned with many Mozarabs, who settled in his kingdom.

In 1108 the troops of the Almoravid Tamim, governor of Córdoba and son of Yusuf ibn Tashfin, attacked Christian territories, but this time the chosen city was not Toledo but Uclés. Alfonso VI was in Sahagún, recently married, elderly and with an old wound that prevented him from riding. Álvar Fáñez, governor of the lands of the Banu Di-l-Nun, was the commander of the army. He was accompanied by Sancho Alfónsez, the king&#x27;s only son and heir. The armies clashed in the Battle of Uclés on 29 May 1108 and the Christian troops suffered another defeat. The young Sancho Alfónsez, heir to the throne, was killed in battle. As a consequence, the &quot;reconquista&quot; came to a 30-year standstill, and the County of Portugal eventually became an independent kingdom. The military situation was also serious since the Almoravids almost immediately seized the entire defensive border of the Tagus valley from Aranjuez to Zorita and there were uprisings of the Muslim population in this region.

===Succession crisis===
Alfonso VI, already old, had to deal with the problem of his succession. Berta had died without giving him an heir at the end of 1099; shortly after, Alfonso married Isabel who gave him two daughters, but no sons. To further complicate the situation, in March 1105 his grandson Alfonso Raimúndez, son of Urraca and Raymond of Burgundy, was born, a possible contender to the throne in detriment to Sancho Alfónsez, the king&#x27;s son with Zaida. Montenegro thinks that Alfonso VI legitimized Sancho probably coinciding with the meeting of a council in Carrión de los Condes in January 1103 because from that date onwards, Sancho began to confirm royal charters before his brothers-in-law Raymond and Henry of Burgundy. In May 1107, Alfonso imposed the recognition of Sancho as heir, despite the probable opposition of his daughters and sons-in-law, in the course of a &quot;Curia Regia&quot; held in León. The situation improved for the king with the death of Raymond of Burgundy in September and the agreement with Urraca so that she remained as sovereign Lady of Galicia, except in the case of remarrying since, in that case, Galicia would pass to her son.

The death of Sancho in the Battle of Uclés on 29 May 1108 left Alfonso VI without his only male heir. He then chose his eldest legitimate daughter Urraca as his successor, but decided to marry her to his rival and famous warrior King Alfonso I of Aragon and Navarre in the autumn of 1108. Although the marriage was celebrated at the end of the following year, it did not lead to the expected stability, but to a long civil war that lasted eight years.

===Death and burial===
Alfonso VI died in Toledo on 1 July 1109. The king had come to the city to try to defend it from an imminent Almoravid attack. His body was taken to the locality of Sahagún, and was buried in the Royal Monastery of San Benito, thus fulfilling the wishes of the monarch. The mortal remains of the king were deposited in a stone sepulchre, which was placed at the feet of the church of the Royal Monastery, until the reign of Sancho IV, who deemed it unseemly that his ancestor was buried at the foot of the temple and ordered the tomb to be moved inside and placed in the church&#x27;s transept, near the tomb of Beatriz, Dowager Lady of Los Cameros and daughter of Infante Frederick of Castile who had been executed by orders of his brother, King Alfonso X the Wise in 1277.

The sepulchre that contained the remains of the king, now having disappeared, was supported on alabaster lions, and was a large ark of white marble, eight feet long and four wide and tall, being covered by a smooth black lid. The tomb was usually covered by a silk tapestry, woven in Flanders, bearing the image of the king crowned and armed, with the representation of the arms of Castile and León on the sides, and a crucifix at the head of the tomb.

The tomb that contained the remains of Alfonso VI was destroyed in 1810, during the fire at the Royal Monastery of San Benito. The mortal remains of the king and those of several of his wives were collected and preserved in the abbey chamber until 1821, when the monks were expelled, and were then deposited by the abbot Ramón Alegrías in a box, which was placed in the southern wall of the chapel of the Crucifix until January 1835, when the remains were collected again and placed in another box and taken to the archive where the remains of the wives of the sovereign were at that time. The purpose was to place all the royal remains in a new sanctuary that was being built at that time. However, when the Royal Monastery of San Benito was dissolved in 1835, the monks delivered the two boxes with the royal remains to a relative of one of them, who kept it hidden until 1902, when these were discovered by Rodrigo Fernández Núñez, a professor at the Institute of Zamora Rodrigo.

The mortal remains of Alfonso VI are now in the Monastery of the Benedictine nuns of Sahagún, at the foot of the temple, in a smooth stone ark and with a cover of modern marble, and in a nearby sepulchre, equally smooth, lie the remains of several of the king&#x27;s wives.

==Wives, concubines and issue==
According to Bishop Pelagius of Oviedo, contemporary of the king, in his &quot;Chronicon regum Legionensium&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of the Kings of León&quot;), Alfonso VI had five wives and two concubines &quot;nobilissimas&quot; (most noble). The wives were, according to the bishop, Agnes, Constance, Berta, Isabel, and Beatrice and the concubines Jimena Muñoz and Zaida. Some chroniclers from north of the Pyrenees report an earlier espousal, to a daughter of William the Conqueror, King of England and Duke of Normandy named Agatha.

===Agatha of Normandy (?)===
Several northern sources report that Alfonso was affianced to Agatha, the daughter of William the Conqueror, King of England and Duke of Normandy, an arrangement negotiated in 1067. She is said to have been sent to Iberia, but to have died before the marriage could take place. There is scholarly dispute over whether Alfonso was the Iberian king involved, and if so, whether the daughter of William involved was Agatha or a different daughter, Adelaide.

===Agnes of Aquitaine===
In 1069, the betrothal with Agnes, daughter of Duke William VIII of Aquitaine, was signed. At the time, she was barely 10 years old and so it was necessary to wait until she reached age 14 for the official wedding, which took place in late 1073 or early 1074. She appears in royal diplomas until 22 May 1077; from that date, the king appears alone in the documentation.

Agnes is said to have died on 6 June 1078, On the other hand, Orderic Vitalis, an English chronicler of the 12th century, said that the marriage of Agnes and Alfonso VI had been annulled in 1080 for reasons of consanguinity, and that Agnes was remarried in 1109 to Count Elias I of Maine.

Reilly suggests that the marriage had been annulled in 1077, probably because of the lack of children. However, Gambra disagrees and believes that there are no reliable sources to support this assertion. In addition to being implied by Orderic, the alleged repudiation appears only in a volume of &quot;L&#x27;art de vérifier les dates&quot; and, according to Gambra, &quot;it is impossible, in the absence of better references, to grant credit to the assertion of Agnes&#x27; repudiation&quot;. In addition, he indicates that Lucas de Tuy, in his &quot;Chronicon mundi&quot;, indicates that the Queen was buried in Sahagún. Finally, he points out that &quot;If such an important event had taken place, it would not make much sense [...] that Alfonso VI immediately married another princess who was a member of Agnes&#x27; family&quot;. Agnes and the king&#x27;s next wife, Constance, were cousins in the third degree, both of them descendants of William III, Duke of Aquitaine. Salazar y Acha concludes that Orderic is in error, and that it was Beatrice, the last wife of Alfonso VI, who as his widow married the Count of Maine.
===Jimena Muñoz===
After the death of Agnes, the king had an extra-marital relationship with Jimena Muñoz, &quot;most noble&quot; (&quot;nobilissima&quot;) concubine &quot;derived from royalty&quot; (&quot;real generacion&quot;), according to Bishop Pelagius of Oviedo. They had two illegitimate daughters born between 1078 and 1080:

*Elvira Alfónsez (c. 1079aft. April 1157), who was married first to Count Raymond IV of Toulouse and then to Count Fernando Fernández de Carrión.
*Teresa Alfónsez (c. 108011 November 1130), who married Count Henry of Portugal; they received the right to rule the County of Portugal and their eldest son, Afonso Henriques, became the first king of Portugal.

===Constance of Burgundy===
At the end of 1079 Alfonso VI married Constance of Burgundy, with whom he appears for the first time in royal charters on 8 May 1080. She was the childless widow of Count Hugues III of Chalon-sur-Saône and daughter of Duke Robert I of Burgundy and his first wife, Hélie de Semur-en-Brionnais, and great-granddaughter of King Hugh Capet of France. She was also the niece of Abbot Hugh of Cluny and aunt of Henry of Burgundy. From this union, which lasted until Constance&#x27;s death in 1093, six children were born, but only one reached adulthood:

*Urraca (c. 10808 March 1126), successor of her father in the thrones of León and Castile, who married firstly Raymond of Burgundy and secondly King Alfonso I of Aragon. She also had two illegitimate children from her relationship with Count Pedro González de Lara. She was succeeded by her son with Raymond of Burgundy, Alfonso VII.

===Zaida===
Bishop Pelagius of Oviedo mentions Zaida as one of the king&#x27;s two concubines and says that she was the daughter of Al-Mu&#x27;tamid ibn Abbad, ruler of the Taifa of Seville. In fact, she was his daughter-in-law, married to his son Abu Nasr Al-Fath al-Ma&#x27;mun, ruler of the Taifa of Córdoba. In March 1091, the Almoravid army besieged the city of Córdoba. Zaida&#x27;s husband, who died during the siege on 26–27 March, sent his wife and children to Almodóvar del Río as a precautionary measure. After becoming a widow, Zaida sought protection at the court of the Leonese king and she and her children converted to Christianity; she was baptized with the name &quot;Isabel&quot; and became the king&#x27;s concubine. They had one son:

*Sancho Alfónsez (c. 109429 May 1108), Alfonso VI&#x27;s only son and heir. His premature death in the Battle of Uclés so grieved his father that he too soon died.

In the chronicle &quot;De rebus Hispaniae&quot;, by the Archbishop of Toledo, Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada, Zaida is counted among the wives of Alfonso VI, but the &quot;Chronica Naierensis&quot; and the &quot;Chronicon mundi&quot; indicate that Zaida was a concubine and not the wife of Alfonso VI.

According to Jaime de Salazar y Acha, followed by other authors, among them, Gonzalo Martínez Diez, they married in 1100, and with this ceremony their son was legitimised and declared heir of the Kingdoms of León and Castile. For Salazar y Acha, Zaida and the fourth wife of Alfonso VI, Isabel, are the same person, &quot;despite of the impotent efforts of later historians to try to prove that she was not the Moor Zaida&quot;, and, accordingly, she would also be the mother of Elvira and Sancha Alfónsez. He supports this based on several arguments, including the turnaround time between the last appearance of Bertha and Isabel&#x27;s first charter as Alfonso&#x27;s wife, much shorter than the interval preceding his other remarriages presumed to have involved international diplomacy, which Salazar y Acha argues indicates that Isabel was ready to hand rather than being a foreign princess. Likewise, he argues, shortly after the marriage of the king with Isabel his son Sancho begins to confirm royal charters and, if Isabel and Zaida were not the same person, the new queen would not have allowed the new protagonism of Sancho in detriment of her possible future sons. He also cites a charter from the cathedral of Astorga dated 14 April 1107 where Alfonso VI grants some fueros and acts &quot;cum uxore mea Elisabet et filio nostro Sancio&quot; (with my wife Isabel and our son Sancho). This is the only document where Sancho is referred to as &quot;our son&quot;, since in others he only appears as the king&#x27;s son even though Queen Isabel also confirms the charters.

Reilly follows Bishop Pelagius in distinguishing the mistress Zaida (baptized Isabel) from the Isabel whom Alfonso married in 1100, but argues that to reinforce the position of his son Sancho, the king annulled his marriage to Queen Isabel in March 1106 and remarried to the boy&#x27;s mother Zaida/Isabel. The hypothesis that Alfonso VI had married Zaida was rejected by Menéndez Pidal and Lévi-Provençal.

On 27 March 1106, Alfonso VI confirmed a donation to the monastery of Lorenzana: &quot;(...) &quot;, an unusual formula that confirms a legitimate marriage. Salazar y Acha and Reilly interpret this quote as proof that the king had married Zaida, thus legitimising their son and the relationship of concubinage. Gambra, however, disagrees and says that it is &quot;an extremely weak argument, starting with the documentary reference, which is scarcely significant. Its character is rather ornamental and literary.&quot; Montaner Frutos also says that this hypothesis is &quot;unlikely and problematic&quot; since it was not necessary for the king to marry Zaida to legitimize his son and that, furthermore, the French Isabel died in 1107 according to her epitaph. Montaner Frutos also mentions a donation from Queen Urraca years later, in 1115, when she donated properties to Toledo Cathedral and only mentions one Isabel as the king&#x27;s wife.

===Berta===
On 25 November 1093 Alfonso VI contracted a third marriage with Berta, although in a document dated 13 April 1094 she is not mentioned as would have been the custom at that time. For onomastic reasons, the genealogist Szabolcs de Vajay suggested that she was a member of the House of Savoy, daughter of Count Amadeus II of Savoy, niece of Bertha of Savoy (wife of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor), great-granddaughter of Bertha of Milan and first-cousin of another Bertha (who married King Peter I of Aragon and Navarre). Her presence in court was first recorded on 28 April 1095. She died between 17 November 1099, when she confirms a royal diploma for the last time, and 15 January 1100 when the king appears alone in a donation to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. On 25 January 1100, the king made a donation to the monastery of Sahagún in memory of his deceased wife. There was no issue from this marriage.

===Isabel===
Alfonso VI&#x27;s penultimate marriage was in early 1100 to Isabel and &quot;the cause of controversy during centuries has been whether this Isabel was the same person as the Arab Muslim Princess Zaida or a different individual&quot;. Alfonso and Isabel appear together for the first time on 14 May 1100 although the diploma is considered suspicious, and the second time in that same year at an unspecified date. Isabel&#x27;s last mention in royal diplomas was on 8 and 14 May 1107 and she probably died in the middle of that year. She is, according to Salazar y Acha, Zaida, who after her baptism was called Isabel. If not identical to Zaida, her origin is uncertain. Bishop Pelagius of Oviedo does not refer to her origin nor does he draw any link between mistress Zaida and wife Isabel. Lucas de Tuy in the 13th century, based on the epitaph of Isabel, makes her daughter of King Louis of France, who at that time would have to be Louis VI although this seems to be chronologically impossible. Reilly considers that she was probably of Burgundian origin, although this does not appear in the documentation. Two daughters were born from this union:

*Sancha (c. 1102before 10 May 1125), first wife of Rodrigo González de Lara, Count of Liébana, with whom she had Elvira Rodríguez de Lara, wife of Ermengol VI, Count of Urgell.
*Elvira (c. 11038 February 1135), wife of King Roger II of Sicily.

===Beatrice===
Alfonso VI married his fifth wife, Beatrice, probably in the first months of 1108. Both appear together for the first time on 28 May 1108 in Astorga Cathedral and then in two other royal charters: on 1 January 1109 in the Cathedral of León and for the last time on 25 April of the same year in Oviedo Cathedral, about three months before the death of the king. According to Bishop Pelagius of Oviedo, once a widow, Beatrice returned to her homeland. Salazar y Acha suggests that she was the daughter of William VIII, Duke of Aquitaine and his third wife Hildegarde of Burgundy, and that she remarried Elias I, Count of Maine.

==Legacy==

In the cultural field, Alfonso VI promoted the safety of the Camino de Santiago and promoted the Cluniac Reforms in the monasteries of Galicia, León and Castile. In the spring of 1073, he made the first concession of a Leonese monastery to the Order of Cluny.

The monarch replaced the Mozarabic or Toledan rite with the Roman one. In this respect it is a common legend that Alfonso VI took Mozarabic and Roman breviaries and threw them into the fire. When only the Roman breviary burned, the king threw the Mozarabic one into the fire, thus imposing the Roman rite.

Alfonso VI, the conqueror of Toledo, the great Europeanizing monarch, saw in the last years of his reign how the great political work that he had carried started to be dismantled due to Almoravid attacks and internal weaknesses. Alfonso VI had fully assumed the imperial idea of León and his openness to European influence had made him aware of the feudal political practices which, in the France of his time, reached their most complete expression. In the conjunction of these two elements, Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz sees the explanation of the grant of the &quot;iure hereditario&quot; (sharing the kingdom between the two daughters and the son instead of bequeathing all to the only son, more typical of Navarrese-Aragonese tradition) of the Counties of Galicia and Portugal to her two Burgundian sons-in-law, Raymond and Henry. After a few years, that decision led to the independence of Portugal and the possibility of an independent Galicia under Alfonso Raimúndez, which ultimately did not materialize when the &quot;infante&quot; became King Alfonso VII of León.

<doc id="69608" wikidata="Q2070934" url="?curid=69608" title="Vör">
<text>In Norse mythology, Vör (Old Norse: &quot;Vǫr&quot;, possibly &quot;the careful one,&quot; or &quot;aware, careful&quot;) is a goddess associated with wisdom. Vör is attested in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and twice in kennings employed in skaldic poetry. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.

==Attestations==
In chapter 35 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur. High lists Vör tenth, and says that Vör is &quot;wise and inquiring, so that nothing can be concealed from her.&quot; High adds that a saying exists where &quot;a woman becomes aware (&quot;vor&quot;) of something when she finds it out.&quot; In chapter 75 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; Vör appears within a list of 27 ásynjur names.

==Theories==
Rudolf Simek says that it is uncertain whether or not Vör was a goddess as attested in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and if the etymological connection presented there (between &quot;Vör&quot; and Old Norse &quot;vörr&quot;, meaning &quot;careful&quot;) is correct. In the same work, Simek writes that the goddesses Sága, Hlín, Sjöfn, Snotra, Vár, and Vör should be considered vaguely defined figures who &quot;should be seen as female protective goddesses&quot; that are all responsible for &quot;specific areas of the private sphere, and yet clear differences were made between them so that they are in many ways similar to matrons.&quot; Simek notes that the second part of the valkyrie name &quot;Geiravör&quot; may be identical with the name of the goddess &quot;Vör&quot; (and would therefore mean &quot;spear-goddess&quot;), or simply be identical with a frequently found suffix appearing in personal names.

Andy Orchard comments &quot;Snorri&#x27;s etymologizing interpretation is scarcely profound, and may imply that he had no access to further material&quot; and notes that references to Vör are otherwise rare.

<text>Var (, ) is a department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region in Southeastern France. It is bordered on the east by the Alpes-Maritimes department; to the west by Bouches-du-Rhône; to the north of the river Verdon by the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence department; and to the south by the Mediterranean Sea. It had a population of 1,076,711 in 2019.

The Var department takes its name from the river Var, which flowed along its eastern boundary, until the boundary was moved in 1860 and the department is no longer associated with the river.

Toulon is Var&#x27;s largest city and administrative capital, known as the prefecture. Other important towns in Var include Fréjus, Saint-Raphaël, Draguignan, Brignoles, Hyères and La Seyne-sur-Mer. Var is known for the harbour of Toulon, the main port of the French Navy, for its seaside resorts, the most famous of which is Saint-Tropez, for some fine examples of Romanesque and other medieval architecture, such as Le Thoronet Abbey and the Fréjus Cathedral, for its wines, particularly the wines of Bandol, as well as for its motorsport race track Circuit Paul Ricard, located in Le Castellet.

==History==
===Early years===
The department of Var was created at the time of the French Revolution, on 4 March 1790, from a portion of the former royal province of Provence.

Its capital was originally Toulon, but this was moved to Grasse in 1793 to punish the Toulonnais for yielding the town to the British in 1793. Subsequently, the capital was moved to Brignoles in 1795, then to Draguignan in 1797. It was not returned to Toulon until 1974.

===19th century===
In 1815, following the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo the department was occupied by Austrian troops until November 1818. In 1854 the first railroad reached Toulon.

With the creation of the new department of Alpes-Maritimes in 1860 and following the annexation by France of Nice, the eastern part of the department, corresponding to the arrondissement of Grasse, was moved to the new department. This move also shifted the river Var, which had given the department its name, to the new department.

In 1884 a cholera epidemic struck Toulon. The leader of the fight against the epidemic was Georges Clemenceau, a doctor and a member of the National Assembly for the Seine department. He was later elected a member of the Chamber of Deputies for the Var department from 1888 to 1893 and Senator from 1902 to 1920, during which time he also served as Prime Minister of France.

===Recent times===
The First World War (1914–1918) stimulated growth in shipyards and military industries in the region, but weakened the agricultural and food industries. In 1942 the German Army moved from Occupied France into the &quot;zone libre&quot;, which included the Var department. The French Fleet was sabotaged in Toulon Harbour to keep it from falling into German hands. The Maquis Vallier, a group of maquis resistance fighters, was active. On 15 August 1944 American and Free French forces land at Saint-Tropez, Sainte-Maxime and Saint-Raphaël. The Free French fleet arrived at Toulon on 13 September.

In the 1960s about 100,000 French citizens were repatriated from Algeria following the Algerian War of Independence and settled in the Var department. In 2014, Fréjus Mayor David Rachline became the first Senator from Var elected under the National Front (later National Rally) banner; alongside Stéphane Ravier from neighbouring Bouches-du-Rhône, the two became the first National Front members of the Senate under the Fifth Republic.

==Geography==
The Var department has a surface area of 6,032 km2. It had 420 km of coastline, including the offshore islands. 56% of its surface area is covered with forest. Its geological formations are divided into two regions; one composed of limestone to the northwest of a line between Toulon and Draguignan and of crystalline rock (quartz) to the southeast.

The department is in the foothills of the French Alps and largely mountainous. Major mountains include:
* The Massif des Maures (771 m) and Massif de l&#x27;Esterel, along the coast, (618 m) are made of quartz rock.
* The Sainte-Baume mountain ridge (1,147 m), in the west.
* Mountain of Lachens (1,715 m), in the northwest of the department, and the highest point in the Var.

The plateau of Canjuers (French: &quot;Plan de Canjuers&quot;) in the northeast of Var gradually rises from 500 to 1,000 metres. In the south and west there are several plateaus, such as the plateau of Siou Blanc to the north of Toulon, which rise from 400 to 700 metres in altitude. 
* The Canyon du Verdon, the gorges of the Verdon River, is a popular place for hikers, kayakers, and nature lovers.
* The Îles d&#x27;Hyères (also known as Porquerolles) is a group of three islands off Hyères The islands are named Porquerolles, Port-Cros, and Île du Levant. Together, they make up an area of 26 km2. They can be reached by boat from either Hyères or Toulon.

<doc id="69618" wikidata="Q1735753" url="?curid=69618" title="Tribe of Manasseh">
<text>According to the Hebrew Bible, the Tribe of Manasseh (; Hebrew: &quot;Ševet Mənašše,&quot; Tiberian: &quot;Šēḇeṭ Mănašše&quot;) was one of the twelve tribes of Israel. After the catastrophic Assyrian invasion of 720 BCE, it is counted as one of the ten lost tribes. Together with the Tribe of Ephraim, Manasseh also formed the House of Joseph.

==Symbols==
Their banner is a black flag with an embroidered unicorn.

==Biblical narrative==
According to the Tanakh, the Tribe of Manasseh was a part of a loose confederation of Israelite tribes from after the conquest of the land by Joshua until the formation of the first Kingdom of Israel in c. 1050 BC. No central government existed, and in times of crisis the people were led by ad hoc leaders known as Judges (see Book of Judges). With the growth of the threat from Philistine incursions, the Israelite tribes decided to form a strong centralised monarchy to meet the challenge, and the Tribe of Manasseh joined the new kingdom with Saul as the first king. After the death of Saul, all the tribes other than Judah remained loyal to the House of Saul, but after the death of Ish-bosheth, Saul&#x27;s son who succeeded him to the throne of Israel, the Tribe of Manasseh joined the other northern Israelite tribes in making Judah&#x27;s king David the king of a re-united Kingdom of Israel. However, on the accession of David&#x27;s grandson Rehoboam, in c. 930 BC the northern tribes split from the House of David and from Saul&#x27;s tribe Benjamin to reform Israel as the Northern Kingdom. Manasseh was a member of the Northern Kingdom until the kingdom was conquered by Assyria in c. 723 BC and the population deported.

From that time, the Tribe of Manasseh has been counted as one of the ten lost tribes of Israel.

== Tribal territory==
The Bible narrates that following the completion of the conquest of Canaan by the Israelite tribes, Joshua allocated the land among the twelve tribes. According to biblical scholar Kenneth Kitchen, this conquest should be dated slightly after 1200 BCE. Some modern scholars argue that the conquest of Joshua, as described in the Book of Joshua, never occurred. &quot;Besides the rejection of the Albrightian &#x27;conquest&#x27; model, the general consensus among OT scholars is that the Book of Joshua has no value in the historical reconstruction. They see the book as an ideological retrojection from a later period—either as early as the reign of Josiah or as late as the Hasmonean period.&quot; &quot;It behooves us to ask, in spite of the fact that the overwhelming consensus of modern scholarship is that Joshua is a pious fiction composed by the deuteronomistic school, how does and how has the Jewish community dealt with these foundational narratives, saturated as they are with acts of violence against others?&quot; Recent decades, for example, have seen a remarkable reevaluation of evidence concerning the conquest of the land of Canaan by Joshua. As more sites have been excavated, there has been a growing consensus that the main story of Joshua, that of a speedy and complete conquest (e.g. Josh. 11.23: &#x27;Thus Joshua conquered the whole country, just as the had promised Moses&#x27;) is contradicted by the archaeological record, though there are indications of &quot;some&quot; destruction at the appropriate time.

In the Book of Joshua, it is claimed that at its height, the territory Manasseh occupied spanned the Jordan River, forming two &quot;half-tribes&quot;, one on each side; the eastern half-tribe was, by most accounts, almost entirely discontiguous with the western half-tribe, only slightly touching at one corner—the southwest of East Manasseh and the northeast of West Manasseh.

West Manasseh occupied the land to the immediate north of Ephraim, thus just north of centre of western Canaan, between the Jordan and the coast, with the northwest corner at Mount Carmel, and neighbored on the north by tribes Asher and Issachar. East Manasseh was the northernmost Israelite group east of the Jordan until the siege of Laish farther north by the tribe of Dan; other neighboring tribes were Gad on the south and Naphtali and Issachar on the west. East Manasseh occupied the land from the Mahanaim in the south to Mount Hermon in the north, and including within it the whole of Bashan. These territories abounded in water, a precious commodity in Canaan, thus constituting one of the most valuable parts of the country; additionally, Manasseh&#x27;s geographic situation enabled it to defend two important mountain passes—Esdraelon on the west of the Jordan and Hauran on the east.

In c. 732 BCE, Pekah, king of Israel (Samaria) allied with Rezin, king of Aram, and threatened Jerusalem. Ahaz, king of Judah, appealed to Tiglath-Pileser III, the king of Assyria, for help. After receiving tribute from Ahaz, Tiglath-Pileser sacked Damascus and Israel, annexing Aram and the territory east of the Jordan (tribes of Reuben, Gad and East Manasseh in Gilead), including the desert outposts of Jetur, Naphish and Nodab. The population of these territories were taken captive and resettled in Assyria, in the region of the Khabur River system. ( and ) The diminished kingdom of Israel was again invaded by Assyria in 723 BCE and the rest of the population deported.

The riverine gulch, &quot;naḥal Ḳanah&quot; , divided Ephraim&#x27;s territory in the south from Manasseh&#x27;s territory in the north. The modern Israeli settlement of Karnei Shomron is built near this gulch, which runs in an easterly-westerly direction.

==Origin==

According to the Torah, the tribe consisted of descendants of Manasseh, a son of Joseph, from whom it took its name. Some critics, however, view this as a postdiction, an eponymous metaphor providing an aetiology of the connectedness of the tribe to others in the Israelite confederation In the Biblical account, Joseph is one of the two children of Rachel and Jacob, a brother to Benjamin, and father to both Ephraim, and his first son, Manasseh; Ephraim received the blessing of the firstborn, although Manasseh was the eldest, because Jacob foresaw that Ephraim&#x27;s descendants would be greater than his brother&#x27;s. Here the blessing of the first son was conferred by a grandfather rather than by the father, despite prevailing custom (great patriarchs supersede custom).

Though the biblical descriptions of the geographic boundary of the House of Joseph are fairly consistent, the descriptions of the boundaries between Manasseh and Ephraim are not, and each is portrayed as having exclaves within the territory of the other. Furthermore, in the Blessing of Jacob, and elsewhere ascribed by textual scholars to a similar or earlier time period, (e.g., ) Ephraim and Manasseh are treated as a single tribe, with &quot;Joseph&quot; appearing in their place. From this it is regarded that originally Ephraim and Manasseh were considered one tribe—that of &quot;Joseph&quot;.

==Fate==
As part of the Kingdom of Israel, the territory of Manasseh was conquered by the Assyrians in the 720&#x27;s BC, and many members of the tribe were exiled; others fled south to the Kingdom of Judah. Either way, the manner of their exile and dispersal led to their further history being lost. However, several modern day groups claim descent, with varying levels of academic and rabbinical support. Both the Bnei Menashe and the Samaritans claim that some of their adherents are descended from this tribe.

==According to Biblical criticism==
Although Machir and Gilead, as individuals, are described in biblical genealogies as father and son, and as son and grandson of Manasseh, in the view of some critical scholars Machir and Gilead are treated as the names of tribes which are different from one another in the Song of Deborah. (Tradition regards these as region names with the region Gilead being named so, long before the grandson of Manasseh.) Additionally, Manasseh is absent from the poem; in the Elohist texts Manasseh is also frequently absent, while Machir is mentioned. Additionally, Machir is described as settling on the east of the Jordan River, leaving the absence of the western half of Manasseh in these passages still unaccounted for. Critical scholars argue that the two sections had different origins, noting that in the First Book of Chronicles separate tribal rulers were named for the western &quot;half tribe&quot; and the eastern &quot;half tribe&quot;.

<text>Perga or Perge (Hittite: &quot;Parha&quot;, &quot;Perge&quot;, ) was originally an ancient Lycian settlement that later became a Greek city in Pamphylia. It was the capital of the Roman province of Pamphylia Secunda, now located in Antalya Province on the southwestern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. Today its ruins lie east of Antalya.

It was the birthplace of Apollonius of Perga, one of the most notable ancient Greek mathematicians for his work on conic sections. A unique and prominent feature for a Roman city was the long central water channel in the centre of the main street which contained a series of cascading pools and which would have been remarkable even today in a semi-arid area where summer temperatures reach over 30 degrees Celsius.

==History==


Perge was situated on the coastal plain between the Rivers Catarrhactes (Düden Nehri) and Cestrus (Aksu), about 11 km from the mouth of the latter.

The history of the city dates back to the Late Chalcolitic Era or Early Bronze Age. Excavations in the original settlement on the acropolis date it to the early Bronze Age, 4000-3000 BC. Pottery found in the Perga Acropolis is linked to the Early Bronze Age pottery traditions in Western Anatolia.

===Late Bronze===
From a bronze tablet discovered in 1986 in Hattusas, a treaty between the Hittite Great King Tudhaliya IV and his vassal, the king of Tarhuntassa, defined the latter&#x27;s western border at the city &quot;Parha&quot; and the &quot;Kastaraya River&quot;. The river is assumed to be the classical Cestrus. West of Parha were the &quot;Lukka Lands&quot;. Parha likely spoke a late Luwian dialect like Lycian and that of the neo-Hittite kingdoms.

===Iron Age===
The settlement probably became a Greek colony of Rhodes in the 7th c. BC. Perge was later a Pamphylian Greek city, and came under successive rule by Persians, Athenians, and Persians again.

In 540 BC Perga, along with the other cities in Pamphylia was captured by the Achaemenid Empire. During the reign of Darius I, it was a part of the Satrapy of Ionia. There is no archeological evidence that shows the Achaemenid rule over Pamphylia but some classical sources do exist. Herodotus mentions that Pamphlyians sent aid to the military campaign of Xerxes against the Greeks, so it must have been under the control of the Achaemenids. According to Diodorus Siculus, Perge was one of the cities that rebelled against the Achaemenid rule during the Great Satraps&#x27; Revolt in 360 BC.

Alexander the Great, after taking Phaselis, was welcomed in Perge with his army in 334 BC. Alexander&#x27;s rule was followed by the Diadochi empire of the Seleucids. The walls around the lower city were built in the period starting from 223 BC. In the 2nd century BC the city became prosperous and started minting its own coins with the image of Artemis and her temple. Perge became renowned for the worship of Artemis, whose temple stood on a hill outside the town, and in whose honour annual festivals were celebrated.

Following the defeat of the Seleucids by the Romans in 188 BC, the wider area was gifted by the Romans to the Attalid kingdom. When its last king died without heirs in 133 BC, he bequeathed his kingdom, including Perga, to the Roman Republic. After 25 BC, the Romans built the Via Sebaste linking Pisidian Antioch in Galatia with Perge. When the Romans first incorporated Perga into the Empire, the city was a part of the Province of Galatia. After the Flavian Dynasty was founded by Emperor Vespasian, the city became a part of the Lycia et Pamphylia province. Vespasian also granted the city the rank of neocorate which made the city in charge of the imperial cult. 

During the 2nd century AD there was a construction boom in the city, fueled by Pax Romana and excessive wealth. The city center was expanded to the South side of the city and new monuments were erected. Perga also had many philanthropists during the Roman Empire period who financed the construction of monumental structures. 

Under the Romans from the 1st to the 3rd century AD the town became a magnificent city with many impressive buildings. It became one of the most beautiful towns in Anatolia, competing with Side for the status of most important town in Pamphylia. Plancia Magna (d. 122), daughter of the governor Marcus Plancius Varus, was the greatest benefactor and instigator of public buildings and was honoured with statues erected by the town council. In 46 AD, according to the Acts of the Apostles, St. Paul journeyed to Perga. Paul and Barnabas came to Perge during their first missionary journey, but probably stayed there only a short time, and do not seem to have preached there; it was there that John Mark left Paul to return to Jerusalem. On his return from Pisidia, Paul preached at Perge.
As the Cestrus silted up over the late Roman era, Perga declined as a secular city. In the first half of the 4th century, during the reign of Constantine the Great (324-337), Perga became an important centre of Christianity, which soon became the official religion of the Roman Empire. The city retained its status as a Christian centre in the 5th and 6th centuries.
St. Matrona of Perge of the 6th century was a female saint known for temporarily cross-dressing to avoid her abusive husband. She also is known for opposing the Monophysite policy of the emperor Anastasios I. Matrona hid in the monastery of St. Bassion as the enuch Babylos. Once revealed, she was sent to a woman&#x27;s monastery where she was head of the convent. She was famous for her miraculous gift of healing. She went on to found a nunnery in Constantinople. St Matrona died at the age of 100. Her life was told through a &quot;vita prima&quot; whose author and exact time period remains a mystery.

The Greek &quot;Notitiae episcopatuum&quot; mentions the city as metropolis of Pamphylia Secunda until the 13th century. Le Quien gives the names of 11 of its bishops: Epidaurus, present at the Council of Ancyra in 312; Callicles at the First Council of Nicaea in 325; Berenianus, at Constantinople (426); Epiphanius at the Second Council of Ephesus (449), at the First Council of Chalcedon (451), and a signatory of the letter from the bishops of the province to Emperor Leo (458); Hilarianus, at a council at Constantinople in 536; Eulogius, at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553; Apergius, condemned as a Monothelite at the Third Council of Constantinople in 680; John, at the Trullan council in 692; Sisinnius Pastillas about 754 (an iconoclast who was condemned at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787); Constans, at the same council of that condemned his predecessor; John, at the Council of Constantinople of 869–70.

No longer a residential, the bishopric is included in the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees.

Perga remained inhabited until the foundation of the Seljuk Empire in roughly 1000.

== City monuments ==
Excavations started in 1946 and have uncovered many monumental buildings: a theatre, a stadium, palaestra, a temple of Artemis and two churches. The temple of Artemis was located outside the town. Many of the coins struck in the city portrayed both the goddess and her sanctuary.

The Hellenistic walls date from the 3rd c. BC and had 3 gates. The south gate is particularly monumental and includes 2 towers 3 storeys high with conical roofs and a horseshoe-shaped square behind. Under Hadrian in 121 AD, a triumphal arch was inserted into the northern wall of the courtyard and the facades were covered in precious marbles and decorated with columns and statues.

One of the most impressive monuments is the theatre which lies outside the walls near the stadium. It is larger than those of Myra and Patara.

The south baths created in the 1st c. AD is one of the best preserved buildings and is noteworthy for its size and monumentality, and for the large collection of sculptures found there.

Perge has been dubbed as “Turkey’s second Zeugma” for the alluring appearance of the mosaics that have been unearthed so far. In 2003 archaeologists discovered well-preserved Greek mosaics showing Oceanus and Medusa. In 2017 a mosaic depicting the sacrifice of Iphigenia was discovered.

The city was eventually supplied in the Roman era by 2 aqueducts. The Kursunlu aqueduct was 11 km long and probably built to supply baths from close to the Kursunlu waterfall. A later aqueduct of 21 km length used a greater flow from the Duden river near the Dudenbasi waterfall.

Perge had at least 6 nymphaea, the most striking being the northern, or &quot;Hadrian&#x27;s&quot;, nymphaeum (about 122 AD) and the southern nymphaeum in the square of Septimius Severus (end 2nd to early 3rd c. AD). Hadrian&#x27;s nymphaeum was beautifully decorated with numerous sculptures including the river god Cestrus under whom water cascaded. It is located at the edge of the acropolis to capture the outflow of the abundant water supply and from there fed the channel that flowed through the city. The southern nymphaeum faces the courtyard of Septimius Severus and is next to the propylon (monumental entrance) of the southern baths whose hydraulic system provided it with water.

A full-body statue of a dressed female was revealed by archaeologists headed by Sedef Cokay Kepçe in 2020. The statue, believed to have been made during the Roman Empire, will be on display at the Antalya Museum.

==Notable people==

Perga&#x27;s most celebrated ancient inhabitant was the mathematician Apollonius (c.262 BC – c.190 BC). He wrote a series of eight books describing a family of curves known as conic sections, comprising the circle, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola.

<text>Peor (, &quot;Paġor&quot;) meaning &quot;opening&quot;, may refer to:
*The name of a mountain peak, mentioned in Numbers , to which Balak, king of Moab led Balaam in his fourth and final attempt to induce Balaam to pronounce a curse upon the Israelites as they were passing through Balak&#x27;s Land to the Promised Land. The tribes of Israel were described as being visible from the peak, but Balaam refused to curse them, and continued to offer blessings ().
*A reference to a deity who was worshipped at that mountain peak (Belphegor) and, biblically, was the subject of the heresy of Peor. The deity, worshipped by the Moabites, is biblically referred to as &quot;Baal-peor&quot; (Num. 25:3,5, 18) and as the &quot;house of peor&quot; (&quot;בית פעור&quot;) (Deuteronomy 3:29), generally meaning &quot;the Baal of Peor&quot;.
*An alternative translation of Phagor, a city of Judah mentioned in the Greek (Septuagint) version of the Book of Joshua (Joshua 15:59).
*In John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, Peor is said to be the other name of the fallen angel Chemos, who &quot;entic&#x27;d/Israel in Sittim on their march from Nile/To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe&quot; (Paradise Lost, I.412-14). His deeds are described in the first book of the epic, as Milton describes Satan&#x27;s followers who were banished from Heaven, and have pledged themselves as followers of the underworld.

<doc id="69621" wikidata="Q733822" url="?curid=69621" title="Penuel">
<text>Penuel (or Pnuel; Hebrew: &quot;Pənūʾēl&quot;) is a place described in the Hebrew Bible as being not far from Succoth, on the east of the Jordan River and south of the river Jabbok in present-day Jordan.

Penuel is mentioned in the Book of Genesis as the site of Jacob&#x27;s struggle with the angel. In 1 Kings, it is mentioned as a capital for Jeroboam, first king of the northern Kingdom of Israel, which he fortified.

== Biblical narrative ==
According to the Biblical narrative, the site was named &quot;Peniel&quot; (&quot;Face of God&quot;) by Jacob:

Here Jacob wrestled (Gen. 32:24–32) &quot;with a man&quot; (&quot;the angel&quot;, Hos. 12:4) &quot;till the break of day.&quot; This episode resulted in God (or the angel) changing Jacob&#x27;s name to &quot;Israel&quot; (Gen. 32:28), interpreted as which literally means, &quot;he who strives with God&quot;, (literally, &quot;God strives&quot;).

Penuel is later mentioned in the Book of Judges. The men of this place refused to give bread to Gideon and his three hundred men when they were in pursuit of the Midianites (). On his return, Gideon tore down the tower there and killed all the men of the city.

According to the Jewish Bible, king Jeroboam of Israel established his capital in Shechem. A short time later, he left Shechem and fortified Penuel, declaring it as his new capital (). He and his son, Nadab, ruled there, until Baasha seized the throne in 909 BCE and moved the capital to Tirzah (). In the scriptures, it is identified as both an El-site and a Jahwist site. 

‘Pnuel’ is also a common name given to males in Assyrian culture.

Some scholars consider that the material of Genesis 32–35, including the account of Jacob being renamed Israel at Penuel, may be a later addition that introduces a new power structure centered around the establishment of sacral places in the North (Penuel, Shechem and Bethel).

== Identification ==
Up until 1970, biblical scholars identified Penuel with the twin peaks of Tulul adh-Dhahab in modern-day Jordan. Based on the account given in Genesis, scholars believed Penuel to be the location of a sacred sanctuary, and presumed that there must have been a temple from Iron Age I or earlier on one of the peaks. Since such a structure has not been found, this identification was questioned.

Contemporary Israeli archaeologist Israel Finkelstein suggested to see the twin peaks as two distinct sites that probably featured distinct names during antiquity. He suggested identifying the western, larger, hill (Tell edh-Dhahab al-Gharbi) with Mahanaim and the eastern one (Tell edh-Dhahab esh-Sharqi) with Penuel.

<text>Names play a variety of roles in the Bible. They sometimes relate to the nominee&#x27;s role in a biblical narrative, as in the case of Nabal, a foolish man whose name means &quot;fool&quot;. Names in the Bible can represent human hopes, divine revelations, or are used to illustrate prophecies.

The titles given to characters, locations, and entities in the Bible can differ across various English translations. In a study conducted by the BibleAsk team in 2024, a comprehensive catalog of names found in the King James Version was compiled and organized into categories such as individuals, geographical locations, national groups, and miscellaneous designations.
The team discovered that within the King James Version Bible, a total of 3,418 distinct names were identified. Among these, 1,940 names pertain to individuals, 1,072 names refer to places, 317 names denote collective entities or nations, and 66 names are allocated to miscellaneous items such as months, rivers, or pagan deities. There are instances of overlap, where the same name may be used across multiple categories (e.g., as both a personal name and a geographical location).

==Most popular names==
During the period 330 BC – 200 AD, the most common male names in Judea or post Kingdom of Israel were:

* 1. Simon/Simeon
* 2. Joseph/Joses
* 3. Lazarus
* 4. Judah
* 5. John
* 6. Jesus
* 7. Ananias
* 8. Jonathan
* 9. Matthew/Matthias
* 10. Manaen
* 11. James

During this period, the most common female names were:
*1. Mary
*2. Salome
*3. Shelamzion
*4. Martha
*56. Joanna and Sapphira (equally common)
*7. Berenice
*89. Imma and Mara (equally common)

<doc id="69625" wikidata="Q794306" url="?curid=69625" title="The Ladykillers (1955 film)">
<text>The Ladykillers is a 1955 British black comedy crime film directed by Alexander Mackendrick for Ealing Studios. It stars Alec Guinness, Cecil Parker, Herbert Lom, Peter Sellers, Danny Green, Jack Warner, and Katie Johnson as the old lady, Mrs. Wilberforce.

William Rose wrote the screenplay, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and won the BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay. He claimed to have dreamt the entire film and merely had to remember the details when he awoke.

==Plot ==
Mrs Wilberforce is a sweet and eccentric old widow who lives alone in a gradually subsiding house, built over the entrance to a railway tunnel in Kings Cross, London. With nothing to occupy her time and an active imagination, she is a frequent visitor to the local police station where she reports fanciful suspicions regarding neighbourhood activities. The officers there humour her but give her reports no credence whatsoever.

She is approached by a sly and sinister character, &quot;Professor&quot; Marcus, who wants to rent rooms in her house. Mrs Wilberforce is not aware that Marcus has assembled a gang of hardened criminals for a sophisticated security van robbery at the nearby railway station, who plan to use Mrs. Wilberforce&#x27;s house as a base of operations. The gang includes the jittery and gentlemanly con-man Major Courtney, the Cockney spiv Harry Robinson, the punch-drunk ex-boxer &#x27;One-Round&#x27; Lawson and the cruel and vicious continental gangster Louis Harvey. As a cover, Marcus convinces the naive Mrs. Wilberforce that the group is an amateur string quintet using the rooms for rehearsal space. To maintain the deception, the gang members carry musical instruments and play recordings of Boccherini and Haydn during their planning sessions.

The criminals successfully carry out the heist, and trick Mrs. Wilberforce into retrieving the disguised money from the railway station herself. As the gang departs her house with the loot, One-Round accidentally gets his cello case full of banknotes trapped in the front door. As he pulls the case free, banknotes spill forth while Mrs. Wilberforce looks on. After she learns from a visiting friend that a robbery has taken place nearby, Mrs. Wilberforce finally sees the gang&#x27;s true colours and informs Marcus that she is going to the police.

Stalling, the gangsters try to convince Mrs. Wilberforce that she will be considered an accomplice for holding the cash. Marcus asserts that the heist was a victimless crime as insurance will cover all the losses and the police will probably not even accept the money back. Mrs Wilberforce wavers but eventually rallies, and the criminals decide they must kill her. No one wants to do it, so they draw lots using matchsticks. The Major loses but tries to make a run for it with the cash.

While Mrs. Wilberforce dozes, the criminals double-cross each other and end up killing one another in rapid succession. The Major falls off the roof of the house after being chased by Louis, Harry attempts to escape with the money but is killed by One-Round, and One-Round is killed by Louis after he leaves his gun&#x27;s safety catch on and fails to shoot Louis and Marcus. Marcus kills Louis by luring him down a ladder by the bridge overlooking the railway and dislodging it, causing Louis to fall into a passing railway wagon. Before falling into the carriage, Louis fires a last shot at Marcus which nearly hits him. Within moments, Marcus himself is struck on the head by a changing railway signal, and his body drops into another wagon. All the other bodies have been dumped into railway wagons passing behind the house and are now far away.

Mrs. Wilberforce is now left alone with the plunder. She goes to the police, but they do not believe her story. They humour her, telling her to &quot;keep the money&quot;. She is puzzled but finally relents and returns home. Along the way, she leaves a banknote of large denomination with a perplexed starving artist.

==Cast==

*Alec Guinness as Professor Marcus
*Cecil Parker as Major Claude Courtney
*Herbert Lom as Louis Harvey
*Peter Sellers as Harry Robinson
*Danny Green as &#x27;One-Round&#x27; Lawson
*Jack Warner as the Superintendent
*Katie Johnson as Mrs Louisa Wilberforce
*Philip Stainton as the Station Sergeant
*Frankie Howerd as the barrow boy
*Kenneth Connor as the taxi driver (uncredited)
*Lucy Griffiths as Miss Pringle (uncredited)
*Harold Goodwin as the parcels clerk (uncredited)
*Stratford Johns as a security guard (uncredited)

Alec Guinness is thought to have based his performance of Professor Marcus on the actor Alastair Sim, as he believed that the role was made for Sim; although critic Philip French wrote in 2015 that &quot;there’s another possible source for the appearance of Marcus, with his prominent teeth and pale, cadaverous features, and that is the self-publicising critic and man of the theatre Kenneth Tynan, who had written a monograph on Guinness and been an assistant on the disastrous 1951 Festival of Britain production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; starring Guinness.&quot;

Robinson was the first major film role for Peter Sellers; he would later appear with Lom in five of &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; films.

Sellers and Guinness would appear together again in &quot;Murder By Death&quot; (1976).

==Production==
&quot;The Ladykillers&quot; was the last Technicolor three-strip movie filmed in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;vcF/tlk&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;When Alec, as the Professor, is killed by a railway signal falling onto his head, the production crew made sure that this would not in fact happen by placing a metal pin half an inch above the level of Alec&#x27;s head. Lines were drawn in chalk to mark where he should stand for the shot. When it came to the take, however, the signal sheared the metal pin and tore the back of Alec&#x27;s jacket. He had been standing an inch or two in front of the chalk mark – a mistake that saved his life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ppr/AG&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sF/end&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; – Piers Paul Read

William Rose left the production midway, following arguments with director Alexander Mackendrick and associate producer Seth Holt, leaving them to complete the script from his notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;sO/441533&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Alveolar consonants (; UK also ) are articulated with the tongue against or close to the superior alveolar ridge, which is called that because it contains the alveoli (the sockets) of the upper teeth. Alveolar consonants may be articulated with the tip of the tongue (the apical consonants), as in English, or with the flat of the tongue just above the tip (the &quot;blade&quot; of the tongue; called laminal consonants), as in French and Spanish.

The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) does not have separate symbols for the alveolar consonants. Rather, the same symbol is used for all coronal places of articulation that are not palatalized like English palato-alveolar &quot;sh&quot;, or retroflex. To disambiguate, the &quot;bridge&quot; (, &quot;etc.&quot;) may be used for a dental consonant, or the under-bar (, &quot;etc.&quot;) may be used for the postalveolars. differs from dental in that the former is a sibilant and the latter is not. differs from postalveolar in being unpalatalized.

The bare letters , etc. cannot be assumed to specifically represent alveolars. The language may not make such distinctions, such that two or more coronal places of articulation are found allophonically, or the transcription may simply be too broad to distinguish dental from alveolar. If it is necessary to specify a consonant as alveolar, a diacritic from the Extended IPA may be used: , &quot;etc.&quot;, though that could also mean extra-retracted. The letters are frequently called &#x27;alveolar&#x27;, and the language examples below are all alveolar sounds.

(The Extended IPA diacritic was devised for speech pathology and is frequently used to mean &quot;alveolarized&quot;, as in the labioalveolar sounds , where the lower lip contacts the alveolar ridge.)

== In IPA ==
Alveolar consonants are transcribed in the IPA as follows:

==Lack of alveolars==
There are no languages that have no alveolars at all. The alveolar or dental consonants and are, along with , the most common consonants in human languages. Nonetheless, there are a few languages that lack them. A few languages on Bougainville Island and around Puget Sound, such as Makah, lack nasals and therefore but have . Colloquial Samoan, however, lacks both and but has a lateral alveolar approximant . (Samoan words written with &quot;t&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are pronounced with and in colloquial speech.) In Standard Hawaiian, is an allophone of , but and exist.

== consonants==
In labioalveolars, the lower lip contacts the alveolar ridge. Such sounds are typically the result of a severe overbite. In the Extensions to the IPA for disordered speech, they are transcribed with the alveolar diacritic on labial letters: .

<doc id="69633" wikidata="Q334744" url="?curid=69633" title="Pekah">
<text>Pekah (, &quot;Peqaḥ&quot;; &quot;Paqaḫa&quot; [&quot;pa-qa-ḫa&quot;]; ) was the eighteenth and penultimate king of Israel. He was a captain in the army of king Pekahiah of Israel, whom he killed to become king. Pekah was the son of Remaliah.

Pekah became king in the fifty-second and last year of Uzziah, king of Judah. 

William F. Albright has dated his reign to 737–732 BC, while E. R. Thiele, following H. J. Cook and Carl Lederer, held that Pekah set up in Gilead a rival reign to Menahem&#x27;s Samaria-based kingdom in Nisan of 752 BC, becoming sole ruler on his assassination of Menahem&#x27;s son Pekahiah in 740/739 BC and dying in 732/731 BC. This explanation is consistent with evidence of the Assyrian chronicles, which agree with Menahem being king in 743 BC or 742 BC and Hoshea being king from 732 BC.

When Pekah allied with Rezin, king of Aram, to attack Ahaz, the king of Judah, Ahaz appealed to Tiglath-Pileser III, the king of Assyria, for help. While the Assyrian king obliged, Judah would become a tributary of Assyria.

== Reign ==
With the aid of a band of Gileadites, from whose home territory he probably originally came, he slew Pekahiah and assumed the throne.

In 732 BC, Pekah allied with Rezin, king of Aram and threatened Jerusalem. The prime reason for such a league was probably to protect their respective countries from another incursion of Tiglath-pileser III., who had compelled Menahem, in 738 B.C., to pay a large tribute. The two kings united their armies and attempted to coerce Ahaz of Judah into joining them. Pekah raided Judah and carried to Samaria a number of captives; but, rebuked by the prophet Oded and by some of the prominent men, the Israelite soldiers released them and sent them back. The united forces of Israel and Syria appeared before the walls of Jerusalem to demand its surrender. At this juncture Isaiah the prophet came to the support of Judah and her king. The allies had proposed to set upon the throne of Judah a son of Tabeel, probably one favorable to the alliance. Ahaz, however, knowing that Tiglath-pileser was within call, appealed to him for help. Ahaz&#x27;s &quot;dread&quot; of Rezin and Pekah, &quot;Son of Remaliah&quot; is recorded in the Immanuel prophecy in Isaiah 7:14 where the birth of a son (possibly Hezekiah) is a sign of the defeat of both kings by the King of Assyria before the child is old enough to eat curds and honey and distinguish right from wrong. After Ahaz paid tribute to Tiglath-Pileser, the Assyrians sacked Damascus and annexed Aram. According to , the population of Aram was deported and Rezin executed. According to , Tiglath-Pileser also attacked Israel and &quot;took Ijon, Abel Beth Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh and Hazor. He took Gilead and Galilee, including all the land of Naphtali, and deported the people to Assyria.&quot; Tiglath-Pileser also records this act in one of his inscriptions.

Soon afterwards, this Pekah was assassinated by Hoshea ben Elah (that is, Hoshea the son of Elah), a captain from Pekah&#x27;s own army, who then took the throne. Tiglath-Pileser in an inscription mentions the slaying of Pekah by his fellow Israelites. The inference here is that the people, seeing the inevitable outcome of the contest with Assyria, put out of the way their fighting king, and then yielded submission to the conqueror, Tiglath-pileser III. He is supposed by some to have been the &quot;shepherd&quot; mentioned in .

==Chronology==
=== Controversy ===
The data given for Pekah&#x27;s reign in the biblical sources have generated considerable discussion. His ending date can be established fairly firmly as 732/731 BC.

But two conflicting systems of reckoning seem to be used for his reign. One system gives him a long reign of twenty years (), which puts his starting date in 752 BC. This date is consistent with the statement that Jotham began to reign in Pekah&#x27;s second year, 750 BC (), and that Jotham&#x27;s successor Ahaz began to reign in his 17th year, 735 BC ().

However, a shorter reign is indicated by , which says that Pekah began to reign in the 52nd year of Azariah (Uzziah) of Judah, i.e. in 740 BC. Also, Pekah assassinated Pekahiah to assume the throne (), and Pekahiah&#x27;s two-year reign () was preceded by his father Menahem&#x27;s ten-year reign (). Menahem gave tribute to Tiglath-Pileser III, as is recorded in (where Pul = Tiglath-Pileser) and also in Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s inscriptions. Since Tiglath-Pileser came to the throne in 745 BC, Menahem&#x27;s tribute would have to be in 745 or later, yet the &quot;longer&quot; chronology gave Pekah, successor to Menahem and Pekahiah, a twenty-year reign that started before this, in 752. These apparent inconsistencies led many scholars to reject all or part of the biblical sources concerning Pekah. D. M. Beegle has maintained that it is impossible to reconcile a twenty-year reign for Pekah with other biblical or with Assyrian history, using this as one of his arguments that the doctrine of the inerrancy of all Scripture cannot be true.

=== C. Lederer and H. J. Cook: a rival reign in Gilead ===
In 1887, Carl Lederer proposed that the existence of two apparently contradictory sets of text for Pekah could be explained if there really were two systems in use for reckoning the reign of Pekah, and these were the consequence of a rivalry between Pekah and Menahem. The rivalry began when Menahem slew Shallum, putting an end to Shallum&#x27;s one-month reign (). This assumption accounted for all the chronological texts that related four kings of Judah (Uzziah through Hezekiah) to three kings of Israel (Menahem, Pekahiah, and Pekah), but it apparently was largely ignored by the scholarly community. Then in 1954, H. J. Cook added new considerations to support Lederer&#x27;s thesis, beyond just the pragmatic. Cook maintained that although the Scriptures did not explicitly state the existence of two rival kingdoms in the north in the latter half of the eighth century BC, their existence could be inferred from passages of the book of Hosea that was written about the time of Pekah and Menahem. Cook showed that although &quot;Ephraim&quot; is sometimes used in Scripture to designate all of the northern kingdom, in various passages of Hosea such as Hosea 5:5, &quot;Israel&quot; and &quot;Ephraim&quot; are not synonymous but refer to separate entities. Cook&#x27;s thesis in this regard was strengthened when Rodger Young pointed out that the Hebrew of Hosea 5:5 has a &quot;vav&quot; before Israel and then another &quot;vav&quot; before Ephraim, which is the Hebrew method of expressing &quot;both... and,&quot; implying a distinction in this passage between Israel and Ephraim. All translations which have rendered this in some sense as &quot;Israel, even Ephraim&quot; are therefore incorrect (the Holman Study Bible renders the verse correctly, as did the ancient Septuagint). Others who have accepted the Lederer/Cook explanation of the two methods of dating for the time of Pekah are Thiele in his second edition of &quot;Mysterious Numbers&quot; and later, Leslie McFall, Francis Andersen and David Noel Freedman in their commentary on Hosea in the Anchor Bible Series, T. C. Mitchell, in the &quot;Cambridge Ancient History&quot;, and Jack Finegan in his &quot;Handbook of Biblical Chronology&quot;.

=== Assyrian references ===
Looking at this from the Assyrian side, Stanley Rosenbaum maintains that the records of Tiglath-Pileser III demonstrate that the Assyrian king distinguished between two kingdoms in the north of Israel. Tiglath-Pileser says he united the northern part (restored as Naphthali in the text) with Assyria, whereas for the southern part, he wrote, &quot;Israel (&quot;bit-Humria&quot;) overthrew their king Pekah and I placed Hoshea as king over them.&quot; Cook thinks that Menahem&#x27;s tribute to Assyria in 2 Kings 15:19 also suggests the existence of a rival to Menahem&#x27;s kingdom:
When Tiglath-Pileser III appeared in the west, Menahem took the opportunity to enlist his support by sending tribute of a thousand talents of silver, with the idea—as 2 Kings xv 19 puts it—&#x27;that he might help him to confirm his hold of the royal power&#x27;. This expression may simply indicate Menahem&#x27;s sense of insecurity in the presence of Assyrian power; but it may equally well indicate the presence of a rival. 
Isaiah 7:1,2 speaks of a league between Pekah and King Rezin of Aram that was a threat to Ahaz of Judah. Ahaz and Menahem of Israel (Ephraim) followed a pro-Assyrian policy and were therefore aligned against the coalition of Pekah and the Arameans that sought to withstand Assyria, thus explaining why Menahem felt insecure and sought to buy the support of Assyria.

=== Pekah as commander under Pekahiah ===
A major objection to the idea that Pekah headed a kingdom that was rival to Menahem&#x27;s reign in Samaria is that he is listed as a commander (&quot;shalish&quot;) of Pekahaiah, Menahem&#x27;s son, whom he slew (2 Kings 15:25). Young remarks,
The objections to Pekah being a rival to Menahem usually center on Pekah’s position as an officer in the army of Pekahiah, Menahem’s son and successor (2 Kgs 15:25). But there is nothing inherently unreasonable about two rivals reaching a détente under which one contender accepts a subordinate position, and he then bides his time until the opportunity comes to slay his rival (or his rival’s son) in a coup. Once the rivalry had begun, the external threat (Assyria) provided compelling reasons for a détente.

Any rivalry between Menahem and Pekah could only appear more and more foolish in light of the growing menace of Assyria. In 733, Tiglath-Pileser campaigned against Damascus, the capital of the Arameans, Pekah&#x27;s erstwhile ally, and he returned to destroy the city in 732. Pekah must have seen the handwriting on the wall in 733 or earlier, and any feeling for &quot;Realpolitik&quot; would dictate that it was time for the two rivals to put aside their differences under some sort of accommodation. But &quot;Realpolitik&quot; would also suggest that this accommodation should not include giving your potential rival a position of leadership in the army, which Pekahiah learned too late.

This is based on inference from the political situation of the time. Gleason Archer showed how inference is used to reconstruct a rivalry in the neighboring kingdom of Egypt that has striking parallels to the Pekah/Menahem rivalry. When Thutmose II died, the intended heir was his son Thutmose III, who was still a boy. However, some time not long after the death of her husband (Thutmose II), Hatshepsut assumed the royal regalia and the title of pharaoh, reigning for 21 years. As he grew older, Thutmose III was given the position of commander of the army, similar to Pekah&#x27;s position as commander, but still under his aunt and stepmother Hatshepsut. After Hatshepsut died, Thutmose, in an inscription describing his first campaign, said it was in his 22nd year of reign, thereby counting his regnal years from the time his father died, not from the death of Hatshepsut. Thutmose left no explanation for modern historians that his 22nd year was really the first year of sole reign, any more than Pekah or the historian of 2 Kings left an explanation that Pekah&#x27;s 12th year, the year in which he slew Pekahiah, was really his first year of sole reign. Modern historians rely on a comparison of inscriptions and chronological considerations to reconstruct the chronology of Thutmose III, and there is unanimity among Egyptologists that he counted as his own years the 21 years that Hatshepsut was on the throne, even though no inscription has ever been found explicitly stating this fact. Commenting on the fact that Egyptologists have no problem in reconstructing history using inference of this sort, whereas critics will sometimes not allow the same historical method to be applied to the Bible, Young writes, &quot;Do those who reject the Menahem/Pekah rivalry as improbable also reject as improbable this reconstruction from Egypt&#x27;s Eighteenth Dynasty that Egyptologists use to explain the regnal dates of Thutmose III? How do they explain Hosea 5:5?&quot;

=== Chronological note ===
The calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). Cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms therefore often allow narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king to within a six-month range. A study of the relevant texts in Scripture allows the narrowing of the start of the Pekah/Menahem rivalry on the death of Shallum to the month of Nisan, 752 BC, as Thiele showed in the second edition of &quot;Mysterious Numbers&quot;, pp. 87–88. In order to simplify things for the reader, Thiele, in the third edition, omitted the logic that allows this accuracy. The third edition also frequently fails to make explicit the six-month narrowing of dates that is possible from the Biblical data, settling instead on a somewhat inexact notation like &quot;931/930 BC&quot; or even simply &quot;931 BC.&quot; For Pekah, synchronisms with the kings of Judah show that he assassinated Pekahiah sometime between Tishri 1 of 740 BC and the day before Nisan 1 of 739 BC. He was slain by Hoshea sometime between Tishri 1 of 732 BC and the day before Nisan 1 of 731 BC.

<doc id="69635" wikidata="Q1233823" url="?curid=69635" title="Crossing the Red Sea">
<text>The Crossing of the Red Sea or Parting of the Red Sea (, lit. &quot;parting of the sea of reeds&quot;) is an episode in The Exodus, a foundational story in the Hebrew Bible.

It tells of the escape of the Israelites, led by Moses, from the pursuing Egyptians, as recounted in the Book of Exodus. Moses holds out his staff and God parts the waters of the Yam Suph, which is traditionally presumed to be the Red Sea, although other interpretations have arisen. With the water dispersed, the Israelites were able to walk on dry ground and cross the sea, followed by the Egyptian army. Once the Israelites have safely crossed, Moses drops his staff, closing the sea, and drowning the pursuing Egyptians.

== Biblical narrative ==

After the Plagues of Egypt, the Pharaoh agrees to let the Israelites go, and they travel from Ramesses to Succoth. Ramesses is generally identified with modern Qantir, the site of the 19th dynasty capital Pi-Ramesses, and Succoth with Tell el-Maskhuta in Wadi Tumilat, the biblical Land of Goshen. From Succoth, the Israelites travel to Etham &quot;on the edge of the desert&quot;, led by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. There God tells Moses to turn back and camp by the sea at Pi-HaHiroth, between Migdol and the sea, directly opposite Baal-zephon. None of these latter locations have been identified with certainty.
God causes the Pharaoh to pursue the Israelites with chariots, and the pharaoh overtakes them at Pi-hahiroth. When the Israelites see the Egyptian army they are afraid, but the pillar of fire and the cloud separates the Israelites and the Egyptians. At God&#x27;s command, Moses held his Staff out over the water, water parted, and the Israelites walked through on dry land with a wall of water on either side (Exodus 14:21&amp;22). The Egyptians pursued them, but at daybreak God clogged their chariot-wheels and threw them into a panic, and with the return of the water, the pharaoh and his entire army are destroyed. When the Israelites saw the power of God, they put their faith in God and in Moses, and sang a song of praise to the Lord for the crossing of the sea and the destruction of their enemies. (This song, at , is called the Song of the Sea).

According to Soggin&#x27;s documentary hypothesis, the narrative contains at least three and possibly four layers. In the first layer (the oldest), God blows the sea back with a strong east wind, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry land; in the second, Moses stretches out his hand and the waters part in two walls; in the third, God clogs the chariot wheels of the Egyptians and they flee (in this version the Egyptians do not even enter the water); and in the fourth, the Song of the Sea, God casts the Egyptians into &quot;tehomot&quot;, the oceanic depths or mythical abyss.

=== In Islam ===

The incident of the Egyptian tyrant Pharaoh chasing down Moses and the Israelites, followed by the drowning in the sea, is mentioned in several places in the Quran. As per God&#x27;s command, Moses came to the court of Pharaoh to warn him for his transgressions. Mūsā clearly manifested the proof of prophethood and claimed to let Israelites go with him. The Magicians of Pharaoh&#x27;s cities, whom he gathered to prove to the people that the person claiming to be prophet is a magician; eventually they all believed in Moses. This enraged Pharaoh. But he couldn&#x27;t frighten them in any way. Later they were pursued by Pharaoh and his army at sunrise. But God revealed to Moses beforehand to leave with His servants at night, for they will be pursued. The Quranic account about the moment:
Miraculously, God divided the waters of the sea leaving a dry path in the middle, which the Children of Israel immediately followed. Pharaoh and his soldiers went so audacious as to chase the Children of Israel into the sea. Nevertheless, this miracle did not suffice to convince Pharaoh. Together with his soldiers who took him as a deity (by obeying him against the prophet of God), he blindly entered the path that divided the sea. However, after the Children of Israel had safely crossed to the other side, the waters suddenly began to close in on Pharaoh and his soldiers and they all drowned. Though, at the last moment Pharaoh tried to repent but Jibreel put mud in his mouth and his repentance was not accepted:

===Legacy===
The theme of Moses crossing the Red Sea was taken up by the panegyrists of Constantine the Great and applied to the battle of the Milvian Bridge (312). The theme enjoyed a vogue during the fourth century on carved sarcophagi: at least twenty-nine have survived in full or in fragments. Eusebius of Caesarea cast Maxentius, drowned in the Tiber, in the role of Pharaoh, both in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; and in his eulogistic &quot;Life of Constantine&quot;.

Every year, Muslims fast two days in the month of Muharram commemorating the event.

== Theories and historicity ==

No clear archaeological evidence has been found that directly supports the story of Exodus, other than the biblical account. Zahi Hawass, an Egyptian archaeologist and formerly Egypt&#x27;s Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs, says: &quot;Really, it’s a myth... Sometimes as archaeologists we have to say that never happened because there is no historical evidence.&quot; Despite the lack of evidence, some have created theories as to what may have inspired the biblical authors&#x27; narrative, providing natural explanations.

=== Crossing location ===
The most popular interpretation holds that the crossing was of the modern Red Sea, potentially at its widest and deepest place. Such an interpretation emphasizes the miraculous nature of the Exodus. Ken Ham states &quot;there is no need to come up with a naturalistic explanation of a supernatural event. The Bible gives us a record from the ultimate Eyewitness, the God of Creation. [...] We must be careful to avoid limiting our faith to only those acts of God that we can explain according to the laws of the physical world. He miraculously created those physical laws, and He can miraculously use them or override them as He chooses.&quot;

The Hebrew term for the body of water that the Israelites crossed is &quot;Yam Suph&quot;. In Exodus 2:3-5, Isaiah 19:6-7, and Jonah 2:5, &quot;suph&quot; is translated as reeds, rushes, marshes, or weeds. A fair rendering of the Hebrew would therefore be &quot;sea/lake of reeds&quot;. This literal translation is attested by Coptic Bohairic translations, Aramaic Targums, Martin Luther, John Calvin, and C. F. Keil, although it has been challenged by Bernard Batto. In the Septuagint, Jews who lived in Alexandria, Egypt, during the 3rd century BC, translated &quot;Yam Suph&quot; in Exodus as the Greek Ἐρυθρὰ θάλασσα (&quot;Eruthra Thalassa&quot; or Erythraean Sea), where &quot;Eruthra&quot; literally means &quot;Red&quot;. This is a historicized translation, not a direct translation, as &quot;suph&quot; in Hebrew does not mean &quot;red&quot;. The Septuagint mainly translates &quot;yam suph&quot; as the Erythraean Sea, but exceptions include I Kings 9:26 (&quot;ἐσχάτης θαλάσσης&quot;, &quot;eschátis thalássis&quot; or &quot;the end of the sea&quot;), Jeremiah 49:21 (&quot;thalassi&quot;&#x27;), and Judges 11:16 (&quot;thalasses siph&quot;). The Erythraean Sea is translated in the Latin Vulgate and modern English translations as the Red Sea, but in classical sources the Erythraean Sea often referred to the northwestern part of the Indian Ocean in general, including the modern Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Gulf of Aqaba, the Arabian Sea, and sometimes the Persian Gulf. Most maps depicted these bodies of water with grossly distorted proportions, omitting gulfs and other features altogether, and Greco-Roman writers used only imprecise allusions. The salt-water reeds suggested by &quot;yam suf&quot; flourished in many shallow lakes and marshes around these areas. Snaith suggests that these are vague terms and Hoffmeier concludes one should be cautious in relying on them to settle the crossing location.

Many sites have been proposed. In 1896, Haynes proposed that the body of water crossed was Lake Timsah, a salt lake north of the Gulf of Suez, and the nearest large body of water after Wadi Tumilat. Lake Timsah was connected to Pithom in Gesem at various times by a canal, and a late 1st millennium text refers to Migdol Baal Zephon as a fort on the canal. Schleiden and Brugsch proposed Sirbonis Lake. Kenneth Kitchen and James Hoffmeier support the isthmus of Suez north to the Mediterranean Sea. Hoffmeier equates &quot;yam suf&quot; with the Egyptian term &quot;pa-tjufy&quot; (also written &quot;p3 twfy&quot;) from the Ramesside period, which refers to lakes in the eastern Nile delta. He also describes references to &quot;p3 twfy&quot; in the context of the Island of Amun, thought to be modern Tell el-Balamun, the most northerly city of Pharaonic Egypt, located about 29 km southwest of Damietta. Drews objects that the isthmus is oriented primarily north-south, and consequently, a wind setdown effect with an east wind is not possible. Naum Volzinger and Alexei Androsov believe that a reef running from Egypt to the north side of the Red Sea used to be much closer to the surface at approximately 1500 BC and therefore a crossing in the northern part of the Gulf of Suez is plausible. 

Alan Gardiner proposes the northeast Nile Delta, in the &quot;marshy and watery region that now comprises the southern extremity of [Lake] Menzaleh&quot;. Carl Drews propose that the Israelites crossed a 3-4 km land bridge along the Lake of Tanis, in the Nile delta. Circa 1250 BC, this lake would have been a shallow, reed-filled brackish lagoon. Ron Wyatt, Lennart Mueller, Bob Cornuke, and Glen Fritz propose Nuweiba Beach in the Gulf of Aqaba. Sir Colin Humphries proposes Elat. Steven Rudd proposes the Straits of Tiran.

=== Volcanic eruption ===


The Minoan eruption was a catastrophic volcanic eruption known to have devastated the Santorini island circa 1600 BC. There was likely another eruption in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc sometime around 1450 BC. Geologist Barbara J. Sivertsen has proposed a link between these eruptions and the Exodus. The pillar of fire and cloud described in Exodus could easily be a volcanic eruption column, smoky by day and fiery by night. A BBC documentary, &quot;Moses&quot;, suggested that the Minoan eruption could have triggered a 600ft-high tidal wave, travelling at about 400 miles an hour, which would have been 6ft high and a hundred miles long when it reached the Egyptian delta.

=== Wind setdown ===

The Biblical narrative describes a strong east wind. Several researchers have proposed that the land path the Israelites walked on was created by a wind setdown.

=== Mirage effects ===
Fraser has proposed that the waters that &quot;were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left&quot; could have been a fata morgana mirage, magnifying and blurring the water on either side of a narrow strip of land and causing it to appear as a solid wall projected in the air. The occurrence of a fata morgana is dependent on a precise combination of winds and temperatures, but could have lasted for the duration of the Israelites’ journey through a body of water. Katzper objects that the Egyptians drowned &quot;upon the sea-shore in the sight of Israel&quot;, and therefore the crossing cannot be explained solely by optics. McKeighen objects that the crossing occurred during the night, and therefore a mirage would have been difficult to observe. Also, a strong east wind could be incompatible with the exact temperature profile needed.

<doc id="69637" wikidata="Q7142075" url="?curid=69637" title="Pashhur">
<text>Pashur or Pashhur () was the name of at least two priests contemporary with the prophet Jeremiah and who are mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah. The name is of Egyptian origin, Pš-Ḥr.

==Pashur ben Immer==
Pashhur the son of Immer (possibly the same as Amariah, Nehemiah ; ), was deputy chief priest (&quot; &quot;) of the temple (Jeremiah 20:1, 2). (At this time, the nagid &quot;governor&quot; of the temple would have been Seraiah - 1 Chronicles ). Enraged at the plainness with which Jeremiah uttered his solemn warnings of coming judgements because of the abounding iniquity of the times, &quot;Pashhur thereupon had Jeremiah flogged and put in the cell at the Upper Benjamin Gate in the House of GOD.&quot; in Jeremiah 20:2. Upon being set free in the morning, Jeremiah went to Pashhur and announced, &quot;GOD has named you not Pashhur, but Magor-missabib,&quot; i.e., &quot;terror on every side&quot;, and that he would be later carried captive to Babylon and die there ().

== Pashur ben Malchiah ==
Pashhur, the son of Malchiah, was another priest who was sent by King Zedekiah to Jeremiah to inquire of the Lord regarding the impending attack of Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in Jeremiah 21:1. In Jeremiah 38:1–6, Pashhur was also one of four men who advised Zedekiah to put Jeremiah to death for his prophecies of doom but who ended up throwing him into a cistern.

== Gedaliah ben Pashur ==
Pashhur, the father of Gedaliah in Jeremiah 38:1 is possibly the same Pashhur. Gedaliah was another of the four men who threw Jeremiah into the cistern.

== Historicity ==
The pottery shards of the Tel Arad ostraca unearthed in the 1970s written in Paleo-Hebrew mention a Pashhur.

<text>A parlour (or parlor) is a reception room or public space. In medieval Christian Europe, the &quot;outer parlour&quot; was the room where the monks or nuns conducted business with those outside the monastery and the &quot;inner parlour&quot; was used for necessary conversation between resident members. In the English-speaking world of the 18th and 19th century, having a parlour room was evidence of social status.

== Etymology ==
In the early 13th century, parlor originally referred to a room where monks could go to talk, derived from the Old French word &quot;parloir&quot; or &quot;parler&quot; (&quot;to speak&quot;), it entered the English language around the turn of the 16th century.

== History ==
The first known use of the word to denote a room was in medieval Christian Europe, when it designated the two rooms in a monastery where clergy, constrained by vow or regulation from speaking otherwise in the cloister, were allowed to converse without disturbing their fellows. The &quot;outer parlour&quot; was the room where the monks or nuns conducted business with those outside the monastery. It was generally located in the west range of the buildings of the cloister, close to the main entrance. The &quot;inner parlour&quot; was located off the cloister next to the chapter house in the east range of the monastery and was used for necessary conversation between resident members.

It was the function of the &quot;outer parlour&quot; as the public antechamber of the monastery that was adapted into domestic architecture. In the early modern period homes became larger and concepts of privacy evolved as material prosperity was more widely shared. Rooms were increasingly set aside for the reception of guests and other visitors, screening them from the rest of the home. Although aristocratic homes might have state rooms, the frequent name for this reception room among the emerging middle classes (not likely to host state functions or royalty) was the &quot;parlour&quot;.
In the English-speaking world of the 18th and 19th century, having a parlour room was evidence of social status. It was proof that one had risen above those who lived in one or two rooms. As the parlour was the room in which the larger world encountered the private sphere of middle class life (the family&#x27;s face to the world) it was invariably the best room (it was often colloquially called that) in the home. The parlour frequently displayed a family&#x27;s best furnishings, works of art and other status symbols. 
&quot;Chamaedorea elegans&quot;, parlour palm, was one of several houseplants regularly grown in a parlour due to its ability to cope with low light and cooler temperatures.

The parlour was used for receptions on formal family occasions such as weddings, births and funerals. Some tradespeople used the parlour of their houses (or later houses bought specifically for business) in the service of their businesses. Hence, funeral parlours (for those who wished to lay out their deceased in a grander style than their own home), beauty parlours, and the like.

In the 20th century, the increasing use of the telephone and automobiles, as well as the increasing casualness of society, led to the decline of formal reception rooms in domestic architecture in English-speaking countries. The secondary functions of the parlour for entertaining and display were taken up by various kinds of sitting rooms, such as the living room in North American usage and the drawing room in British countries.

Despite its decline in domestic architecture, the term parlour continues to have an afterlife in its second meaning as nomenclature for various commercial enterprises. In addition to &quot;funeral parlour&quot; and &quot;beauty parlour&quot; (mentioned above), it is also common to say &quot;betting parlour&quot;, &quot;billiard parlour&quot;, &quot;ice cream parlor&quot;, &quot;pizza parlour&quot;, &quot;massage parlour&quot;, &quot;tattoo parlour&quot; and &quot;cafe parlor&quot;. Less common uses include &quot;beer parlour&quot;, &quot;wine parlour&quot;, &quot;spaghetti parlour&quot;, and &quot;coffee parlour&quot;.

The dialect-specific usage of this English term instead of another (i.e., as opposed to &quot;ice cream shoppe&quot; or &quot;pizzeria&quot;) varies by region.

<text>Niels Steensen (; Latinized to Nicolas Steno or Nicolaus Stenonius; 1 January 1638 – 25 November 1686 ) was a Danish scientist, a pioneer in both anatomy and geology who became a Catholic bishop in his later years. He has been beatified by the Catholic Church.

Steensen was trained in the classical texts on science; however, by 1659 he seriously questioned accepted knowledge of the natural world. Importantly he questioned explanations for tear production, the idea that fossils grew in the ground and explanations of rock formation. His investigations and his subsequent conclusions on fossils and rock formation have led scholars to consider him one of the founders of modern stratigraphy and modern geology. The importance of Steensen&#x27;s foundational contributions to geology may be gauged from the fact that half of the twenty papers in a recent miscellany volume on &quot;The Revolution in Geology from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment&quot; focus on Steensen, the &quot;preeminent Baroque polymath and founder of modern geologic thought&quot;.

Born to a Lutheran family, Steensen converted to Catholicism in 1667. After his conversion, his interest in the natural sciences rapidly waned giving way to his interest in theology. At the beginning of 1675, he decided to become a priest. Four months later, he was ordained in the Catholic clergy on Easter Sunday in 1675. As a clergyman, he was later appointed Vicar Apostolic of Nordic Missions and Titular Bishop of Titopolis by Pope Innocent XI. Steensen played an active role in the Counter-Reformation in Northern Germany.

His canonization process began in 1938 and Pope John Paul II beatified Steensen in 1988.

== Early life and career ==

Niels Steensen was born in Copenhagen on New Year&#x27;s Day 1638 (Julian calendar), the son of a Lutheran goldsmith who worked regularly for King Christian IV of Denmark. He became ill at age three, suffering from an unknown disease, and grew up in isolation during his childhood. In 1644 his father died, after which his mother married another goldsmith. In 1654–1655, 240 pupils of his school died due to the plague. Across the street lived Peder Schumacher (who would offer Steensen a post as professor in Copenhagen in 1671). At the age of 19, Steensen entered the University of Copenhagen to pursue medical studies. After completing his university education, Steensen set out to travel through Europe; in fact, he would be on the move for the rest of his life. In the Netherlands, France, Italy and Germany he came into contact with prominent physicians and scientists. These influences led him to use his own powers of observation to make important scientific discoveries.

At the urging of Thomas Bartholin, Steensen first travelled to Rostock, then to Amsterdam, where he studied anatomy under and lodged with Gerard Blasius, focusing on the lymphatic system. Within a few months Steensen moved to Leiden, where he met the students Jan Swammerdam, Frederik Ruysch, Reinier de Graaf, Franciscus de le Boe Sylvius, a famous professor, and Baruch Spinoza. Steensen doubted Descartes&#x27;s recently published explanation of the origin of tears as produced by the brain. Invited to Paris by Henri Louis Habert de Montmor and Pierre Bourdelot, he there met Ole Borch and Melchisédech Thévenot who were interested in new research and in demonstrations of his skills. In 1665 Steensen travelled to Saumur, Bordeaux and Montpellier, where he met Martin Lister and William Croone, who introduced Steensen&#x27;s work to the Royal Society.

After travelling through France, he settled in Italy in 1666 – at first as professor of anatomy at the University of Padua and then in Florence as in-house physician of Grand Duke of Tuscany Ferdinando II de&#x27; Medici, who supported arts and science and whom Steensen had met in Pisa. Steensen was invited to live in the Palazzo Vecchio; in return he had to gather a cabinet of curiosities. Steensen went to Rome and met Pope Alexander VII and Marcello Malpighi, whom he admired. On his way back he watched a Corpus Christi procession in Livorno and wondered if he had the right belief.

== Scientific contributions ==

=== Anatomy ===

During his stay in Amsterdam, Steensen discovered a previously undescribed structure, the &quot;ductus Stenonis&quot; (the duct of the parotid salivary gland) in sheep, dog and rabbit heads. A dispute with Blasius over credit for the discovery arose, but Steensen&#x27;s name remained associated with this structure known today as the Stensen&#x27;s duct. In Leiden, Steensen studied the boiled heart of a cow, and determined that it was an ordinary muscle. and not the center of warmth as Galenus and Descartes believed. In Florence, Steensen focused on the muscular system and the nature of muscle contraction. He became a member of Accademia del Cimento and had long discussions with Francesco Redi. Like Vincenzo Viviani, Steensen proposed a geometrical model of muscles to show that a contracting muscle changes its shape but not its volume.
 Steensen was the first to describe the lateral line system in fish.

=== Paleontology ===
In October 1666, two fishermen caught a huge female shark near the town of Livorno, and Ferdinando II de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, ordered its head to be sent to Steensen. Steensen dissected the head and published his findings in 1667. He noted that the shark&#x27;s teeth bore a striking resemblance to certain stony objects, found embedded within rock formations, that his learned contemporaries were calling &quot;glossopetrae&quot; or &quot;tongue stones&quot;. Ancient authorities, such as the Roman author Pliny the Elder, in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;, had suggested that these stones fell from the sky or from the Moon. Others were of the opinion, also following ancient authors, that fossils naturally grew in the rocks. Steensen&#x27;s contemporary Athanasius Kircher, for example, attributed fossils to a &quot;lapidifying virtue diffused through the whole body of the geocosm&quot;, considered an inherent characteristic of the earth – an Aristotelian approach. Fabio Colonna, however, had already shown by burning the material to show that &quot;glossopetrae&quot; were organic matter (limestone) rather than soil minerals, in his treatise &quot;De glossopetris dissertatio&quot; published in 1616. Steensen added to Colonna&#x27;s theory a discussion on the differences in composition between glossopetrae and living sharks&#x27; teeth, arguing that the chemical composition of fossils could be altered without changing their form, using the contemporary corpuscular theory of matter.

Steensen&#x27;s work on shark teeth led him to the question of how any solid object could come to be found inside another solid object, such as a rock or a layer of rock. The &quot;solid bodies within solids&quot; that attracted Steensen&#x27;s interest included not only fossils, as we would define them today, but minerals, crystals, encrustations, veins, and even entire rock layers or strata. He published his geologic studies in &quot;De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus&quot;, or &quot;Preliminary discourse to a dissertation on a solid body naturally contained within a solid&quot; in 1669. This book was his last scientific work of note. Steensen was not the first to identify fossils as being from living organisms; his contemporary Robert Hooke also argued that fossils were the remains of once-living organisms.

=== Geology and stratigraphy ===
Steensen, in his &quot;Dissertationis prodromus&quot; of 1669 is credited with four of the defining principles of the science of stratigraphy. His words were:
# the law of superposition: &quot;At the time when a given stratum was being formed, there was beneath it another substance which prevented the further descent of the comminuted matter and so at the time when the lowest stratum was being formed either another solid substance was beneath it, or if some fluid existed there, then it was not only of a different character from the upper fluid, but also heavier than the solid sediment of the upper fluid.&quot;
# the principle of original horizontality: &quot;At the time when one of the upper strata was being formed, the lower stratum had already gained the consistency of a solid.&quot;
# the principle of lateral continuity: &quot;At the time when any given stratum was being formed it was either encompassed on its sides by another solid substance, or it covered the entire spherical surface of the earth. Hence it follows that in whatever place the bared sides of the strata are seen, either a continuation of the same strata must be sought, or another solid substance must be found which kept the matter of the strata from dispersion.&quot;
# the principle of cross-cutting relationships: &quot;If a body or discontinuity cuts across a stratum, it must have formed after that stratum.&quot;
These principles were applied and extended in 1772 by Jean-Baptiste L. Romé de l&#x27;Isle. Steensen&#x27;s ideas still form the basis of stratigraphy and were key in the development of James Hutton&#x27;s theory of infinitely repeating cycles of seabed deposition, uplifting, erosion, and submersion.

=== Crystallography ===

Steensen gave the first accurate observations on a type of crystal in his 1669 book &quot;De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento&quot; (the &quot;Dissertationis prodromus&quot;). The principle in crystallography, known simply as &quot;Steensen&#x27;s law&quot;, or the law of constancy of interfacial angles or the &quot;first law of crystallography&quot;, states that the angles between corresponding faces on crystals are the same for all specimens of the same mineral. Steensen&#x27;s seminal work paved the way for the law of rational indices of French mineralogist René-Just Haüy in 1801. This fundamental breakthrough formed the basis of all subsequent inquiries into crystal structure.

== Conversion and priesthood ==
Steensen&#x27;s questioning mind also influenced his religious views. Having been brought up in the Lutheran faith, he nevertheless questioned its teachings, something which became a burning issue when confronted with Catholicism while studying in Florence. After making comparative theological studies, including reading the Church Fathers and by using his natural observational skills, he decided that Catholicism, rather than Lutheranism, provided more sustenance for his constant inquisitiveness. In 1667, Steensen converted to Catholicism on All Souls&#x27; Day, influenced, among others, by Lavinia Cenami Arnolfini, a noblewoman of Lucca.

Steensen traveled to Hungary, Austria and in Spring 1670 he arrived in Amsterdam. There he met with old friends Jan Swammerdam and Reinier de Graaf. With Anna Maria van Schurman and Antoinette Bourignon he discussed scientific and religious topics. The following quote is from a 1673 speech:
:&quot;Fair is what we see, Fairer what we have perceived, Fairest what is still in veil&quot;.
It is not clear if he met Nicolaes Witsen, but he did read Witsen&#x27;s book on shipbuilding. In 1671 he accepted the post of professor of anatomy in the University of Copenhagen, but promised Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici he would return when he was appointed tutor to Ferdinando III de&#x27; Medici.

At the beginning of 1675, Steensen decided to continue his theological studies, which he had begun even before his conversion, toward his ordination to the priesthood. After only 4 months, he was ordained priest and celebrated his first Mass on 13 April 1675 in the Basilica of the Santissima Annunziata in Florence at the age of 37. Athanasius Kircher expressly asked what were the reasons why he decided to become priest. Steensen had left natural sciences for education and theology and became one of the leading figures in the Counter-Reformation. Upon request of Duke Johann Friedrich of Hanover, Pope Innocent XI made him Vicar Apostolic for the Nordic Missions on 21 August 1677. He was consecrated titular bishop of Titiopolis on 19 September by Cardinal Gregorio Barbarigo and moved to the Lutheran North.

In the year after he was made bishop, he was probably involved in the banning of publications by Baruch Spinoza. There he had talks with Gottfried Leibniz, the librarian; the two argued about Spinoza and his letter to Albert Burgh, then Steensen&#x27;s pupil. Leibniz recommended a reunification of the churches. Steensen worked at the city of Hannover until 1680.

After John Frederick death&#x27;s, Prince-Bishop of Paderborn Ferdinand of Fürstenberg appointed him as Auxiliary Bishop of Münster (Church Saint Liudger) on 7 October 1680. The new prince-elector Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover was a Protestant. Earlier, Augustus&#x27; wife, Sophia of Hanover, had made fun of Steensen&#x27;s piousness; he had sold his bishop&#x27;s ring and cross to help the needy. He continued zealously the work of counter reform begun by Bernhard von Galen.

== Death ==
In 1683, Steensen resigned as auxiliary bishop after an argument about the election of the new bishop, Maximilian Henry of Bavaria and moved in 1684 to Hamburg. There Steensen became involved again in the study of the brain and the nerve system with an old friend Dirck Kerckring. Steensen was invited to Schwerin, when it became clear he was not accepted in Hamburg. Steensen dressed like a poor man in an old cloak. He drove in an open carriage in snow and rain. Living four days a week on bread and beer, he became emaciated. When Steensen had fulfilled his mission, some years of difficult tasks, he wanted to go back to Italy.

Before he could return, Steensen became severely ill, his belly swelling day by day. Steensen died in Germany, after much suffering. His corpse was shipped to Florence by Kerckring upon request of Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici and buried in the Basilica of San Lorenzo close to his protectors, the De&#x27; Medici family. In 1946 his grave was opened, and the corpse was reburied after a procession through the streets of the city.

== Beatification ==
After his death in 1686, Steensen was venerated as a saint in the diocese of Hildesheim. Steensen&#x27;s piety and virtue have been evaluated with a view to an eventual canonization. His canonization process was begun in Osnabrück in 1938. In 1953 his grave in the crypt of the church of San Lorenzo was opened as part of the beatification process. His corpse was transferred to a fourth-century Christian sarcophagus found in the river Arno donated by the Italian state. His remains were placed in a lateral chapel of the church that received the name of &quot;Capella Stenoniana&quot;. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1988. His feast day is 5 December.

<text>Ophrah (), ( or ) is a name in the Hebrew Bible meaning &quot;a fawn&quot; given to: 
* A city of Benjamin (), probably identical with Ephron () and Ephraim (), the modern Palestinian town of Taybeh. The Israeli settlement of Ofra is close to the site as well. According to Epiphanius, it was situated 5 miles east of the city of Bethel.
* &quot;Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites,&quot; a city of Manasseh, 6 miles (10 km) southwest of Shechem, the residence of Gideon (; ). After his great victory over the Midianites, he slew at this place the captive kings (). He then assumed the function of high priest and sought to make Ophrah what Shiloh should have been. This thing &quot;became a snare&quot; to Gideon and his house. After Gideon&#x27;s death, his family resided here until they were put to death by Gideon&#x27;s son Abimelech (). It is identified with Ferata.
* A grandchild of Othniel Ben Kenaz, mentioned in .

<doc id="69654" wikidata="Q914073" url="?curid=69654" title="Ophir">
<text>Ophir (; ) is a port or region mentioned in the Bible, famous for its wealth. Its existence is attested to by an inscribed pottery shard found at Tell Qasile (in modern-day Tel Aviv) in 1946, dating to the eighth century BC, which reads &quot;gold of Ophir to/for Beth-Horon [...] 30 shekels&quot;. The location of Ophir is unknown, though the find confirms it as a real place which exported gold.

==Biblical references==
Ophir in Genesis 10 (the Table of Nations) is said to be the name of one of the sons of Joktan. The Books of Kings and Chronicles tell of a joint expedition to Ophir by King Solomon and the Tyrian king Hiram I from Ezion-Geber, a port on the Red Sea, that brought back large amounts of gold, precious stones and &#x27;algum wood&#x27; and of a later failed expedition by king Jehoshaphat of Judah. The famous &#x27;gold of Ophir&#x27; is referenced in several other books of the Hebrew Bible.

In the Septuagint, other variants of the name are mentioned: &quot;Ōpheír&quot;, &quot;Sōphír&quot;, &quot;Sōpheír&quot; and &quot;Souphír&quot;.

The New Testament apocrypha book &quot;Cave of Treasures&quot; contains a passage: &quot;And the children of Ophir, that is, Send, appointed to be their king Lophoron, who built Ophir with stones of gold; now, all the stones that are in Ophir are of gold.&quot;

==Theorized locations==

=== Possible ancient trade routes ===

====Sumatra and Malay Peninsula====
The 1st-century historian Josephus, in his &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (8.6.4), identified Ophir as &quot;the Aurea Chersonesus, which belongs to India.&quot; &quot;Aurea Chersonesus&quot; () is Grecolatin for &quot;Golden Peninsula.&quot; At that time, India was thought to comprise, not just the Indian subcontinent, but also Indochina, and Indonesia. Hence, in his Geography, the nearly contemporaneous geographer Ptolemy lists these additional lands within the province of &quot;India beyond the Ganges.&quot; Ptolemy therein identifies exactly where this Golden Peninsula is, centering it in Malaysia, perhaps also extending somewhat into Sumatra. In particular, Ptolemy mentions a &quot;golden river&quot; () somewhat south of the archaeological site of the Bujang Valley (), and in the vicinity of the &quot;Palandos river&quot; () (the modern Pahang region, also common in the derived toponyms surrounding Kuala Lumpur). These areas are indeed famous for gold. Indeed, the longest-lasting name for Sumatra, , which also means &quot;gold,&quot; may have derived directly from the word Ophir, by a means similar to the Classical Greek pronunciation displayed in the Septuagint: &quot;Soophaara&quot;/&quot;Souphir&quot; (/).

Europeans, arriving later, consequently renamed mythologically-famous &#x27;golden&#x27; Mount Ledang near Malacca, Malaysia, as Mount Ophir.

====Sri Lanka====
The 10th-century lexicographer, David ben Abraham al-Fasi, identified Ophir with Serendip, the old Persian name for Sri Lanka (aka Ceylon). Moreover, as mentioned above, &quot;A Dictionary of the Bible&quot; by Sir William Smith notes the Hebrew word for parrot &quot;Thukki&quot;, derived from the Classical Tamil for peacock &quot;Thogkai&quot; or Sinhalese &quot;tokei&quot;. Both Sinhalese and Tamil are native to Sri Lanka. 

==== India ====
&quot;A Dictionary of the Bible&quot; by Sir William Smith, published in 1863, notes the Hebrew word for parrot &quot;Thukki&quot;, derived from the Classical Tamil for peacock &quot;Thogkai&quot; and Sinhalese &quot;tokei&quot;, joins other Classical Tamil words for ivory, cotton-cloth and apes preserved in the Hebrew Bible. This theory of Ophir&#x27;s location in Uvari in Tamil Nadu is further supported by other historians. 

The most likely location on the coast of Kerala conjectured to be Ophir is Poovar in Thiruvananthapuram District (though some Indian scholars also suggest Beypore as a possible location).

Earlier in the 19th century, Max Müller and other scholars identified Ophir with Abhira, near the Indus River in modern-day state of Gujarat, India. According to Benjamin Walker Ophir is said to have been a town of the Abhira tribe.

In Jewish tradition, Ophir is often associated with Uvari, a place in the Indian subcontinent, named for one of the sons of Joktan. Ibn Sa&#x27;d says in his &quot;Kitab at-Tabaqat al-Kabir&quot; that the Indians, the Sindhis and the Bindis are the descendants of Yufir (Ophir).

====Philippines====
In Tomo III (1519–1522), pages 112–138, of the book &quot;Colección general de documentos relativos a las Islas Filipinas existentes en el Archivo de Indias de Sevilla&quot;, found in the General Archive of the Indies in Spain, Document No. 98 describes how to locate the land of Ophir. The navigational guide starts from the Cape of Good Hope in Africa to India, Burma, Sumatra, the Maluku Islands, Borneo, Sulu, China, then finally Ophir, which is speculated to be the Philippines. Parallel to this Spanish archive an older text called the &quot;Periplus of the Erythean Sea&quot; cited the directions to Chryse, a golden island in the Eastern Ocean, is an island right to the south of China, where the Philippines is. This speculation was amplified by Lone District of Santa Rosa Representative Danilo Fernandez in 2023, who suggested Ophir as the desirable name for the country.

====Africa====
Biblical scholars, archaeologists and others have tried to determine the exact location of Ophir. Vasco da Gama&#x27;s companion Tomé Lopes reasoned that Ophir would have been the ancient name for Great Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe, the main center of southern African trade in gold in the Renaissance period — though the ruins at Great Zimbabwe are now dated to the medieval era, long after Solomon is said to have lived. The identification of Ophir with Sofala in Mozambique was mentioned by Milton in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (11:399-401), among many other works of literature and science.

Another, more serious, possibility is the African shore of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden or Somali Sea, with the name perhaps being derived from the ancient city of Opone in modern day Somalia or from Afar people living in the Danakil desert (Ethiopia, Eritrea) between Adulis and Djibouti.

Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the Carthaginians, who dwelt in North Africa, in modern-day Tunisia. This name, that later gave the rich Roman province of Africa and the subsequent medieval Ifriqiya, from which the name of the continent Africa is ultimately derived, seems to have referred to a native Libyan tribe originally, however, see Terence for discussion. The name is usually connected with Phoenician &quot;afar&quot;, &quot;dust&quot;, but a 1981 hypothesis has asserted that it stems from the Berber word &quot;ifri&quot; (plural &quot;ifran&quot;) meaning &quot;cave&quot;, in reference to cave dwellers. This is proposed to be the origin of &quot;Ophir&quot; as well.

====Mahd adh Dhahab, Arabia====
In 1976, the United States Department of Interior announced that a team formed by the United States Geological Survey together with experts from Saudi Arabia believes it has &quot;a fairly airtight case” that Mahd adh Dhahab, or Cradle of Gold, in Saudi Arabia is the biblical Ophir. As evidence, the team states that &quot;there are huge quantities of waste rock left behind by ancient miners, approximately a million tons, and that it has an average gold content of sixteenths of an ounce per ton, indicating that the mined ore must have been richer. From sampling old slopes and from production figures during the 1939 to 1954 period when the mine was reactivated to extract gold and silver, the geological survey scientists estimated that in biblical times much gold must have been found at or near the surface.&quot; Moreover, Mahd adh Dhahab is &quot;within range of Israel&#x27;s transport capability,&quot; and it &quot;could easily have been known to Solomon or his advisers because it lies on a north‐south trade route that has run to Aqaba for some 4,000 years.&quot; Their conclusion is that &quot;Mand adh Dhahab [sic] could have produced 34 tons of gold in ancient times and was the biblical Ophir.&quot;

=== Inspiration or named after ===

====Americas====
In a letter written in May 1500, Peter Martyr claimed that Christopher Columbus identified Hispaniola with Ophir.

The theologian Benito Arias Montano (1571) proposed finding Ophir in the name of Peru, reasoning that the native Peruvians were thus descendants of Ophir and Shem.

The California Gold Rush boomtown, Ophir, was renamed after &quot;the biblical source of Solomon&#x27;s treasure.&quot;

Ophir, Oregon, is an unincorporated community on the coast in Curry County.

====Solomon Islands====
After their discovery by Europeans in 1568 by Spanish navigator Álvaro de Mendaña, the Solomon Islands were subsequently referred to as &quot;Islas Salomón&quot; (Solomon Islands) by others following reports of his voyage optimistically conflated with stories of King Solomon, believing them to be Ophir.

<text>Reactive armour is a type of vehicle armour used in protecting vehicles, especially modern tanks, against shaped charges and hardened kinetic energy penetrators. The most common type is &quot;explosive reactive armour&quot; (ERA), but variants include &quot;self-limiting explosive reactive armour&quot; (SLERA), &quot;non-energetic reactive armour&quot; (NERA), &quot;non-explosive reactive armour&quot; (NxRA), and electric armour. NERA and NxRA modules can withstand multiple hits, unlike ERA and SLERA. 

When a shaped charge strikes the upper plate of the armour, it detonates the inner explosive, releasing blunt damage that the tank can absorb.

Reactive armour is intended to counteract anti-tank munitions that work by piercing the armour and then either killing the crew inside, disabling vital mechanical systems, or creating spalling that disables the crew—or all three.

Reactive armour can be defeated with multiple hits in the same place, as by tandem-charge weapons, which fire two or more shaped charges in rapid succession. Without tandem charges, hitting precisely the same spot twice is much more difficult.

==History==

The Australians were the first recorded to have conceptualized and developed methods to disrupt and spread the jet of a hollow charge shell to reduce its penetrating power. In a June 1944 report from the Explosives Manufacturing Practices Laboratory of the Explosives Factory Maribyrnong, an operational requirement for the defence against shaped charges was laid out. The focus was in regard to Japanese 75 mm hollow charge shells used against Allied tanks in the Pacific. The destructive effect of the shaped charge was identified as caused by a jet moving at high velocities, consisting of particles from the liner. The two methods developed were to destroy the jet by forcing it to act through a layer of explosives, disrupting the jet, and to make it act through a layer of oxidiser, destroying the jet by burning it with oxidising agents. 

The earliest trials were done with small charges able to defeat 2 inch of steel plate which were readily defeated by a layer of explosive (Baratol, R.D.X., Cordite, etc.) or a vigorous oxidising medium. Subsequent trials with British No.68 and American M9A1 grenades were carried out. However trials were done in few numbers which caused varied results. A mixture of Sodium and Potassium Nitrates explosives was seen as the most practical option due to their casting properties. The mixture acted as an oxidiser which may explode when dispersed and heated. The Explosives Manufacturing Practices Laboratory seemingly developed a more middle road between chemical armor and explosive reactive armor concepts to counter the hollow charge threat. 

The idea of counterexplosion (&quot;kontrvzryv&quot; in Russian) in armour was proposed in the USSR by the Scientific Research Institute of Steel (NII Stali) in 1949 by academician Bogdan Vjacheslavovich Voitsekhovsky. The first pre-production models were produced during the 1960s. However, insufficient theoretical analysis during one of the tests resulted in all of the prototype elements being detonated. For a number of reasons, including the aforementioned accident and a belief that Soviet tanks had sufficient armour, the research was ended. No more research was conducted until 1974, when the Ministry of the Defensive Industry announced a contest to find the best tank protection .

Picatinny Arsenal, an American military research and manufacturing facility experimented with testing linear cutting charges against anti-tank ammunition in the 1950s, and concluded that they may be effective with an adequate sensing and triggering mechanism, but noted &quot;tactical limitations&quot;; the report was declassified in 1980.

A West German researcher, Manfred Held, carried out similar work with the IDF in 1967–1969. Reactive armour created on the basis of the joint research was first installed on Israeli tanks during the 1982 Lebanon war and was judged very effective.

== Explosive reactive armour ==
An element of explosive reactive armour (ERA) is made of either a sheet or slab of high explosive sandwiched between two metal plates, or multiple &quot;banana shaped&quot; rods filled with high explosive which are referred to as shaped charges. On attack by a penetrating weapon, the explosive detonates, forcibly driving the metal plates apart to damage the penetrator. The shaped charges, in contrast, each detonate individually, launching one spike-shaped plate each, meant to deflect, detonate or cut the incoming projectile.

The disruption is attributed to two mechanisms. First, the moving plates change the effective velocity and angle of impact of the shaped charge jet, reducing the angle of incidence and increasing the effective jet velocity versus the plate element. Second, since the plates are angled compared to the usual impact direction of shaped charge warheads, as the plates move outwards the impact point on the plate moves over time, requiring the jet to cut through fresh plates of material. This second effect greatly increases the effective plate thickness during the impact.

To be effective against kinetic energy projectiles, ERA must use much thicker and heavier plates and a correspondingly thicker explosive layer. Such &quot;heavy ERA&quot;, such as the Soviet-developed Kontakt-5, can break apart a penetrating rod that is longer than the ERA is deep, again reducing penetration capability. Such ERA is ineffective against modern armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) projectiles, however, due to their depleted uranium construction.

An important aspect of ERA is the brisance, or detonation speed of its explosive element. A more brisant explosive and greater plate velocity will result in more plate material being fed into the path of the oncoming jet, greatly increasing the plate&#x27;s effective thickness. This effect is especially pronounced in the rear plate receding away from the jet, which triples in effective thickness with double the velocity.
ERA also counters explosively forged projectiles, as produced by a shaped charge. The counter-explosion must disrupt the incoming projectile so that its momentum is distributed in all directions rather than toward the target, greatly reducing its effectiveness.

Explosive reactive armour has been valued by the Soviet Union and its now-independent component states since the 1980s, and almost every tank in the eastern-European military inventory today has either been manufactured to use ERA or had ERA tiles added to it, including even the T-55 and T-62 tanks built forty to fifty years ago, but still used today by reserve units. The U.S. Army uses reactive armour on its Abrams tanks as part of the TUSK (Tank Urban Survivability Kit) package and on Bradley vehicles and the Israelis use it frequently on their American built M60 tanks.

ERA tiles are used as add-on (or &quot;appliqué&quot;) armour to the portions of an armoured fighting vehicle that are most likely to be hit, typically the front (glacis) of the hull and the front and sides of the turret. Their use requires that a vehicle be fairly heavily armoured to protect itself and its crew from the exploding ERA.

A further complication to the use of ERA is the inherent danger to anyone near the tank when a plate detonates, though a high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead explosion would already cause great danger to anyone near the tank. Although ERA plates are intended only to bulge following detonation, the combined energy of the ERA explosive, coupled with the kinetic or explosive energy of the projectile, will frequently cause the plate to explode, creating shrapnel that risks injuring or killing bystanders. Thus, infantry must operate some distance from vehicles protected by ERA in combined arms operations.

=== Sensitivity ===
ERA is insensitive to impact by kinetic projectiles up to 30 mm in caliber. A 20 mm APIT autocannon round penetrates a Serbian ERA sample but fails to detonate it. However, computer simulations indicate that a small caliber (30 mm) HEAT projectile will detonate an ERA, as would larger shape charges and APFSDS penetrators.

== Non-explosive and non-energetic reactive armour ==

NERA and NxRA operate similarly to explosive reactive armour, but without the explosive liner. Two metal plates sandwich an inert liner, such as rubber. When struck by a shaped charge&#x27;s metal jet, some of the impact energy is dissipated into the inert liner layer, and the resulting high pressure causes a localized bending or bulging of the plates in the area of the impact. As the plates bulge, the point of jet impact shifts with the plate bulging, increasing the effective thickness of the armour. This is almost the same as the second mechanism that explosive reactive armour uses, but it uses energy from the shaped charge jet rather than from explosives.

Since the inner liner is non-explosive, the bulging is less energetic than on explosive reactive armour, and thus offers less protection than a similarly-sized ERA. However, NERA and NxRA are lighter, safe to handle, and safer for nearby infantry; can theoretically be placed on any part of the vehicle; and can be packaged in multiple spaced layers if needed. A key advantage of this kind of armour is that it cannot be defeated by tandem warhead shaped charges, which employ a small forward warhead to detonate ERA before the main warhead fires.

== Electric armour ==
&quot;Electric armour&quot; or &quot;electromagnetic armour&quot; is a proposed reactive armour technology. It is made up of two or more conductive plates separated by an air gap or by an insulating material, creating a high-power capacitor. In operation, a high-voltage power source charges the armour. When an incoming body penetrates the plates, it closes the circuit to discharge the capacitor, dumping energy into the penetrator, which may vaporize it or even turn it into a plasma, diffusing the attack. It is not public knowledge whether this is supposed to function against both kinetic energy penetrators and shaped charge jets, or only the latter. As of 2005, this technology had not yet been introduced on any known operational platform.

Another electromagnetic alternative to ERA uses layers of plates of electromagnetic metal with silicone spacers on alternate sides. The damage to the exterior of the armour passes electricity into the plates, causing them to magnetically move together. As the process is completed at the speed of electricity the plates are moving when struck by the projectile, causing the projectile energy to be deflected whilst the energy is also dissipated in parting the magnetically attracted plates.

<text>The Tandy Center Subway was a small rapid transit system that operated in Fort Worth, Texas, from February 15, 1963 to August 30, 2002. It ran a distance of and was, during the period of its operation, the only privately owned subway in the United States.

==History==
The subway was originally built by Leonard&#x27;s Department Store in 1963, connecting the store to its large parking lots on the edge of downtown. Originally known as the Leonard&#x27;s M&amp;O Subway, it consisted of one underground station beneath the store and four stations in the parking lots. Between 1962 and 1966, Leonard&#x27;s acquired a total of 15 PCC streetcars from DC Transit in Washington, D.C. These had been manufactured by the St. Louis Car Company in the 1930s and 1940s.

The Tandy Corporation purchased the department store, its parking lots, and the subway in 1967. Dillard&#x27;s operated the store and subway, under the name Dillard&#x27;s Metro Liner, for a short amount of time there after. The corporation built its headquarters, the Tandy Center, on the site in 1974. Although it demolished the original store, Tandy retained the subway.

The small subway primarily served patrons visiting the mall at the base of the Tandy Center, which also linked to the downtown location of Fort Worth Public Library. However, the anchor tenant moved out in 1995 and the mall declined. The Tandy Center Subway ceased operation on August 30, 2002.

After the closure, one of the streetcars used on the subway was acquired by Dallas&#x27;s McKinney Avenue Transit Authority, which modified it to again make it suitable for in-street use, and it operated in service on the McKinney Avenue heritage streetcar line in Dallas until the mid-to late 2000s. Nicknamed &quot;Winnie&quot; for its shape, it had repeated mechanical failures during its short service life. , it remains in storage in Dallas, out of use.

&quot;Leonard&#x27;s number one&quot; was the first PCC streetcar to run the line in 1963, the subway car was originally manufactured by the St. Louis Car Co. between 1937 and 1944 in Washington, D.C., with custom made air conditioning and heating. The number one car is the only one of five original subway cars to survive. In April 1982 the car was saved from the cutting torch by a Tandy computer programmer and stored on a farm south of Fort Worth, where it remained for over 25 years. On February 2, 2008, it was moved to a restoration location near Benbrook, Texas. , Leonard&#x27;s number one is on public display in the lobby of Texas Capital Bank, Fort Worth (One City Place).

A second car, nicknamed &quot;Ms. Marty&quot; was stored in a warehouse after the closure of the subway, and was relocated when said warehouse was demolished for the Panther Island Project. Miss Marty has been relocated to a Trinity Metro maintenance facility for storage.

Parts of the tunnels that ran the cars still exist but currently closed off to the public. Due to the subway station being located directly under the street, it remains to this day, with the gaps in-between the subway platforms filled in, and the tunnel gated off. The end of the tunnel opening into the parking lots was buried during construction of the Tarrant County College Trinity River Campus. In 2015, Gordon Dickson with Lauren Leonard, the great-granddaughter of Obie Leonard and cousin Marty Leonard, daughter of founder Marvin Leonard, visited the tunnel with asset manager for Spire Realty Group Ryan Johnson. During that visit, the Marty Leonard signed “Remember the M&amp;O,” with date and name on the wall closing off the tunnel.

<text>Francis Alick Howard (6 March 1917 – 19 April 1992), better known by his stage-name Frankie Howerd, was an English actor and comedian.

==Early life==
Howerd was born the son of a soldier Francis Alfred William (1887–1934) and Edith Florence Howard (née Morrison, 1888–1962), at the City Hospital in York, England, in 1917 (not 1922 as he later claimed). His mother worked at the Rowntree&#x27;s factory. The family lived in Hartoft Street, which he later described as &quot;a poorish area of the city near the River Ouse&quot;. He retained an affection for his home city, to which he often returned.

When his father was posted to Woolwich, the family moved to Eltham, London while he was a young child, and he was educated at Shooter&#x27;s Hill Grammar School in Shooter&#x27;s Hill.

== Career ==
His first stage appearance was at age 13 but his early hopes of becoming a serious actor were dashed when he failed an audition for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He began to entertain during World War II service in the British Army. It was at this time that he adapted his surname to Howerd &quot;to be different&quot;. In 1944 he became a bombardier in Plymouth, was promoted to sergeant, and on 6 June 1944 was part of the D-Day effort but was stuck on a boat off Normandy. Despite suffering from stage fright, he continued to work after the war, beginning his professional career in the summer of 1946 in a touring show called &quot;For the Fun of It&quot;.

His act was soon heard on radio, when he made his debut, in early December 1946, on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Variety Bandbox&quot; programme with a number of other ex-servicemen. His profile rose in the immediate postwar period (aided with material written by Eric Sykes, Galton and Simpson and Johnny Speight). Sykes had headed a rival concert party during the war and was asked by Howerd if he could provide his material; Sykes obliged and offered to write anything more Howerd needed. Sykes punctuated the material with various &#x27;ooh&#x27;s and &#x27;ahh&#x27;s to provide &quot;punctuation pauses&quot; in the delivery, but Howerd decided to deliver these verbatim. Howerd then toured the Music Hall circuit with an act including what became his standard catch-phrases such as &quot;titter ye not&quot;. He also became a regular in the 1950s editions of the weekly hard-copy comic &quot;Film Fun&quot;.

In 1954 he made his screen debut opposite Petula Clark in &quot;The Runaway Bus&quot;, which had been written for his specific comic talent. Filming took five weeks, with a budget of £45,000.

He then experimented with different formats and contexts, including stage farces, Shakespearean comedy roles, and television sitcoms. At the start of the 1960s, he began to recover his old popularity, initially with a season at Peter Cook&#x27;s satirical Establishment Club in Soho in London. He was boosted further by success on &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot; (TW3) in 1963 and on stage with &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (1963–1965), which led into regular television work. In 1966 and 1967, he co-hosted a 90-minute Christmas show called &quot;The Frankie and Bruce Christmas Show&quot; with Bruce Forsyth, featuring many top acts of the day.

During the 1960s and 1970s, he was involved in shows for the BBC and Thames Television (as well as &quot;Frankie Howerd Reveals All&quot; for Yorkshire Television in 1980). Ray Galton and Alan Simpson wrote for him from 1964 to 1966 when he worked for the BBC and also for a one-off show for Thames, &quot;Frankie Howerd meets the Bee Gees&quot;, shown on 20 August 1968. He was known for his seemingly off-the-cuff remarks to the audience, especially in the show &quot;Up Pompeii!&quot; (1969–70), which was a direct follow-up from &quot;Forum&quot;. His television work was characterised by direct addresses to camera and by his littering monologues with verbal tics such as &quot;Oooh, no missus&quot; and &quot;Titter ye not&quot;. A later sale of his scripts, however, showed that the seemingly off-the-cuff remarks had all been meticulously planned. Barry Cryer said of his technique: &quot;What he could do with a script was amazing, like all the great performers. He transformed something you&#x27;d just written – what you hoped was in a Frankie Howerd idiom – but when you heard him do it, my God, it was something else; – it was gossiping over the garden wall, the &quot;apparent&quot; waffle – he was like a tightrope walker, you thought he&#x27;s going to fall off in a minute, you thought, &#x27;Come on, Frank&#x27; , we&#x27;re waiting for a laugh, and then, suddenly, &quot;Bang&quot;. He knew exactly what he was doing.&quot; Another feature of his humour was to feign innocence about his obvious and double entendres, while mockingly censuring the audience for finding them funny.

Howerd appeared as Francis Bigger, one of the lead characters in 1967&#x27;s &quot;Carry On Doctor&quot;, of which &quot;Variety&quot; noted, &quot;Added zest is given by the inclusion of Frankie Howerd as a quack &#x27;mind-over-matter&#x27; doctor who becomes a reluctant patient. Howerd&#x27;s brilliantly droll sense of comedy is given plenty of scope.&quot;

The success of the film version of &quot;Up Pompeii&quot; in 1971 saw British exhibitors vote him the ninth most popular star at the British box office that year. He would play versions of the character Lurcio in &quot;Up the Chastity Belt&quot; (Lurkalot), also in 1971, and &quot;Up the Front&quot; (Boot Boy Lurk) in 1972.

In 1971 Howerd recorded, with June Whitfield, a comedy version of the song &quot;Je t&#x27;aime&quot;, previously recorded by Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg, in which she featured as &quot;Mavis&quot; alongside Howerd&#x27;s &quot;Frank&quot;, and a third unexplained sleeping partner named &quot;Arthur&quot;. The song was included in the 2004 CD re-issue of &quot;Oh! What a Carry On!&quot;.

In 1976, Howerd appeared in &quot;The Frankie Howerd Show&quot; on CBC Television in Canada. It received good ratings but was not renewed.

He was awarded an OBE in 1977.

In 1978, Howerd appeared in the big-budget Hollywood musical &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; playing Mean Mr Mustard, acting alongside musical and film talent such as Peter Frampton, the Bee Gees, George Burns, Alice Cooper, Aerosmith and Steve Martin. He was cast by producer Robert Stigwood as he was on Stigwood&#x27;s record label at the time. The film was a critical and commercial flop. Since Howerd was not well known to American audiences, this may have been his biggest exposure in the US.

There was a cabaret tour of New Zealand in 1979. In 1982, Howerd appeared in the televised versions of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; (as the Learned Judge) and &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; (as Sir Joseph Porter, KCB). He performed a comedy-duet with Cilla Black on &quot;Cilla Black&#x27;s Christmas&quot; (1983).

After six years without a regular television show in the United Kingdom (though he had hosted a one-off UK version of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; for Channel 4, which was critically panned and was not commissioned for a full series), Howerd returned to TV screens in 1987 in the Channel 4 show &quot;Superfrank!&quot;, scripted by Miles Tredinnick and Vince Powell. In the last years of his career, Howerd developed a following with student audiences and performed a one-man show at universities and in small theatrical venues. He was also a regular guest on the late night BBC Radio 1 programme &quot;Into the Night&quot;, hosted by Nicky Campbell.

In 1990, he contributed to the last recording studio collaboration between Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson, on the album &quot;Freudiana&quot;, performing &quot;Sects Therapy&quot;.

Howerd often worked with Sunny Rogers (1913–2005), who was his accompanying pianist from 1960 onwards. She appeared in his TV and live theatre shows including his last major West End appearance – his one-man show – at the Garrick Theatre in 1990. He also occasionally performed with accompanist Vera Roper (1908–2001), of Southend-on-Sea, who was billed as &quot;Madam Vere-Roper&quot;.

==Personal life==

Throughout his career, Howerd hid his potentially career-destroying homosexuality from both his audience and his mother, Edith. (Sexual acts between consenting males were illegal in England and Wales until 1967.) In 1958, he met sommelier Dennis Heymer at the Dorchester Hotel while dining with Sir John Mills; Howerd was 40 and Heymer was 28. Heymer became his lover as well as manager, and stayed with him for more than thirty years, until Howerd&#x27;s death, with Heymer helping to revive Howerd&#x27;s flagging career in the 1960s. However, the two had to remain discreet as Howerd feared being blackmailed if anyone beyond his immediate circle found out. The relationship was explored in 2008 in a drama for BBC Four, &quot;Rather You Than Me&quot;, starring David Walliams and Rafe Spall.

Backstage, Howerd was notoriously bold in his advances, and was known for his promiscuity. One of Howerd&#x27;s former boyfriends was comic actor Lee Young who created the TV sitcom &quot;Whoops Baghdad&quot; (1973) for him. Howerd&#x27;s uncomfortable relationship with his sexuality he once allegedly said to Cilla Black, &quot;I wish to God I wasn&#x27;t gay&quot; as well as his depressive mental state, led him to seek resolution through a series of different methods. Heymer would often drop Howerd off on Friday at his psychiatrist, who would ply him with LSD over the weekend. This experience was later the subject of the March 2015 BBC Radio 4 drama &quot;Frankie Takes a Trip&quot;.

In his early career, Howerd suffered from a stutter, which caused him some distress, but which he turned to an advantage in developing his delivery style as a comic.

For the last 20 years of Howerd&#x27;s life, he and Heymer lived in Wavering Down, a house in the village of Cross, Somerset, under the Mendip Hills. After Howerd&#x27;s death, Heymer curated Howerd&#x27;s collection of memorabilia until his own death in 2009.

==Death==
Having contracted a virus during a Christmas trip to the Amazon in 1991, Howerd suffered respiratory problems at the beginning of April 1992 and was taken to a clinic in London&#x27;s Harley Street, but was discharged at Easter. He collapsed and died of heart failure two weeks later, on the morning of 19 April 1992, aged 75. Two hours before he died, he was speaking on the telephone to his TV producer about new ideas for his next show.

Howerd&#x27;s death came one day after that of fellow comedian Benny Hill, but as Hill had died alone at his home, it was not yet known he was dead. Some newspapers ran an obituary of Howerd which featured a quote, ostensibly from Hill, saying that &quot;We were great, great friends&quot;. The quote was released by Dennis Kirkland, a friend of Hill who acted as his press agent; Kirkland had issued the statement himself after being unable to contact Hill.

Howerd was buried at St. Gregory&#x27;s Church in Weare, Somerset. In May 2009, when Heymer died, he was buried near him.

==Legacy==

A BBC TV biography about Frankie Howerd, &quot;Rather You Than Me&quot;, was broadcast by BBC Four on 9 April 2008, and repeated on 10 February 2013. The script was written by Peter Harness, after extensive interviews with Howerd&#x27;s partner, Dennis Heymer. The comedian David Walliams was cast as Howerd.

On 15 May 2009, Heymer died in the home, Wavering Down, that he and Howerd had shared. He was 79. Wavering Down is now a tourist attraction and, in the summer, hosts concerts and opens regularly as a museum of Howerd&#x27;s collection of memorabilia and personal effects such as his false teeth and ill-fitting toupee, to raise funds for charity.

Howerd also lived at 27 Edwardes Square, Kensington, London W8. The house bears a blue plaque installed by the Dead Comics&#x27; Society in 1993. In March 1999 former colleagues and friends and Howerd&#x27;s sister Betty attended a fund-raising weekend in York and a blue plaque was placed on the Cumberland Street entrance to the Grand Opera House. The inscription reads: &quot;Frankie Howerd OBE 1917-1992. Son of York&quot;. In 2016, a York Civic Trust plaque was unveiled at 53, Hartoft Street, Howerd&#x27;s childhood home, by York-born actor Mark Addy and the Lord Mayor of York.

The church hall of St Barnabas Church, Eltham, was re-named the Frankie Howerd Centre in the 1980s and was opened by Howerd himself.

Howerd&#x27;s career was described by the comedian Barry Cryer as being &quot;a series of comebacks&quot;.

<text>The City of David (), known locally mostly as Wadi Hilweh (), is the name given to an archaeological site considered by most scholars to be the original settlement core of Jerusalem during the Bronze and Iron Ages. It is situated on southern part of the eastern ridge of ancient Jerusalem, west of the Kidron Valley and east of the Tyropoeon Valley, to the immediate south of the Temple Mount.

The City of David is an important site of biblical archeology. Remains of a defensive network dating back to the Middle Bronze Age were found around the Gihon Spring; they continued to remain in use throughout subsequent periods. Two monumental Iron Age structures, known as the Large Stone Structure and the Stepped Stone Structure, were discovered at the site. Scholars debate if these may be identified with David or date to a later period. The site is also home to the Siloam Tunnel, which, according to a common hypothesis, was built by Hezekiah during the late 8th century BCE in preparation for an Assyrian siege. However, recent excavations at the site suggested an earlier origin in the late 9th or early 8th century BCE. Remains from the early Roman period include the Pool of Siloam and the Stepped Street, which stretched from the pool to the Temple Mount.

The excavated parts of the archeological site are today part of the Jerusalem Walls National Park. The site is managed by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority and operated by the Ir David Foundation. It is located in Wadi Hilweh, an extension of the Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan, East Jerusalem, intertwined with an Israeli settlement.

==Naming==
The name &quot;City of David&quot; originates in the biblical narrative where Israelite king David conquers Jerusalem, then known as Jebus, from the Jebusites. David&#x27;s conquest of the city is described twice in the Bible: once in the Books of Samuel and once in the Books of Chronicles; those two versions vary in certain details. In his &quot;Antiquities of the Jews,&quot; 1st century Jewish-Roman historian Josephus repeated the story. The reliability of the Bible for the time period&#x27;s history is subject to debate among scholars.

According to the Hebrew Bible, the name &quot;City of David&quot; was applied to Jerusalem after its conquest by David c. 1000 BCE, and is not to be confused with the modern organization by the same name and which showcases relatively small excavated portions of the larger city. It is first mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, in , in , in and in , being the name given to Jerusalem after it had been conquered by King David and who is said to have ruled in the city for 33 years.

The area&#x27;s majority Palestinian Arab residents refer to it as &quot;Wadi Hilweh&quot;, before it was renamed by Israeli authorities as the &quot;City of David&quot; after 1967, a name which was first applied to the site by French archaeologist Raymond Weill in 1913. Rannfrid Thelle wrote that the title &quot;City of David&quot; favors the Jewish national agenda and appeals to its Christian supporters.

== Location ==
The archaeological site is on a rocky spur south of the Temple Mount and outside the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem, sometimes described as the southeastern ridge of ancient Jerusalem. The hill descends from the Dung Gate toward the Gihon Spring and the Pool of Siloam.

Today, the archeological site is part of the Palestinian neighborhood and former village of Silwan, which was historically centered on the slopes of the southern part of the Mount of Olives, east of the City of David. In the 20th century, the village spread west and crossed the valley to the eastern hill, the site of the ancient city. Before 1948, the area was known in Arabic as &quot;Wadi al-Nabah&quot;, but was renamed to &quot;Wadi al-Hilweh&quot; after the wife of the local mukhtar who was killed in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

== Excavations and scholarly views ==

The prevailing view of archaeologists is that the ancient site of the City of David lay on an elongated spur facing north–south, extending outside the wall of the Old City, south of its southeastern corner, in the southern part of the eastern ridge next to the Gihon Spring. The City of David was the ancient epicenter of Jerusalem and whose boundaries stretched from the Temple Mount in the north, thence southward to the Pool of Siloam, including the area marking the Kidron brook in the east and the adjacent dale in the west. Its area is about 50 dunams (ca. 12.3 acres).

The beginning of its settlement dates back to the Chalcolithic period and the Early Bronze Age, largely built-up around the natural spring, although not known then by the name City of David. The Old Testament claims that, after the conquest of Jerusalem, an earlier name for the site, Jebus, was replaced by the term &quot;City of David&quot;. David&#x27;s son, Solomon, extended the wall to the north and added to it the area of the Temple Mount whereon he built an edifice (Temple) to the God of his fathers. From the eighth century BCE, the city began to expand westward beyond the dale.

The debate within biblical archaeology on whether this site on the hill southeast of the Old City could be identified with what the Hebrew Bible calls Jebus and later the City of David, began in the late 19th century with the excavations of Charles Warren and Hermann Guthe. The 1909–11 work of Louis-Hugues Vincent and Montagu Brownlow Parker identified the earliest known settlement traces in the Jerusalem region, suggesting the area was an ancient core of settlement in Jerusalem dating back to the Bronze Age.

One of the stated objectives of the Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF) since its establishment in 1865 was to search for the true location of the biblical &quot;City of David&quot; and to report on its findings. However, after 130 years of research, surveys, and excavations in Jerusalem, only a few of the targets relating to the area of the City of David have been achieved and neither the location of the tombs of David and Solomon or the Ophel are known.

The City of David is one of the most excavated archaeological sites in the country and one of the first to be excavated. Many researchers of Near Eastern history often took part in digs within the City of David, among whom were: C. Warren, 1867–1870; H. Guthe, 1881; F.J. Bliss and A.C. Dickie, 1894–1897; R. Weill, 1913–1914 and 1923–1924; M. Parker and L. Vincent, 1909–1911, in which they documented the location of tunnels and artifacts discovered in and on the bedrock in the areas around Warren&#x27;s Shaft on the eastern slopes of the mountain above the Gihon Spring; R.A.S. Macalister and J. G. Duncan, 1923–1925, who discovered the Ophel ostracon in &quot;Wadi Hilweh&quot; of the City of David; J.W. Crowfoot and G.M. Fitzgerald, 1927–1928; K.M. Kenyon, in the years 1961–1967; Y. Shilo, 1978 to 1985; and more.

More recent excavations (2000–2008) were conducted by R. Reich and E. Shukron on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority, and where they detailed Iron Age II findings in a rock-cut pool near the Gihon spring. In the &quot;City of David Visitors&#x27; Center,&quot; before it was opened to the public, excavations were conducted in and around the general area of that site by a team of IAA archaeologists, again confirming the existence of a city dating back to the Iron Age II, and continuing unabated to the Early Roman period, and which, when the Jewish exiles returned to Jerusalem after the Babylonian captivity in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah, they continued to call the immediate area surrounding the Pool of Siloam by the name &quot;City of David,&quot; although this name was eventually replaced by the name Accra ().

According to &quot;Haaretz&quot;, &quot;the prevailing theory in mainstream scholarship, that even if such rulers existed, they were monarchs of a tiny backwater.&quot; Today, scholars are divided amongst those who support the historicity of the biblical narrative of a united monarchy ruled by David, those who completely deny its existence and those who support its existence but believe that the Hebrew Bible contains theological exaggerations. A view held by Finkelstein, Koch &amp; Lipschits (2011) that the City of David is to be placed on the Temple Mount has largely been rejected by scholars of historical geography.

The area is one of the most intensively excavated sites in the Holy Land. Archaeological practice at the site has been criticized for its practitioners not acknowledging political and corporate motivations, questionable field practice and overtly skewed interpretations.

===Location and topography===
It is on a narrow ridge running south from the Temple Mount. The site has a good defensive position, as it is almost surrounded by the Central or Tyropoeon Valley to its west, by the Hinnom Valley to the south, and the Kidron Valley on the east.

The ridge is currently inside the predominantly Arab neighborhood of Wadi Hilweh, which is part of Silwan, an East Jerusalem suburb.

===Bronze and Iron Age===
It is thought to have been the site of a walled city from the Bronze Age, which enjoyed the defensive advantages of its position. In the pre-Israelite period, the area is thought to have been separated from the site of the later Temple Mount by the Ophel, an uninhabited area which became the seat of government under Israelite rule.

In 2014, excavations at the Givati parking lot argued there had been no 10th-century city wall, meaning: no fortified settlement in the City of David during the Iron IIA (c. 1000–925 BCE), the time span usually proposed by biblical scholars for the reigns of David, Solomon and Rehoboam.

During the reign of Hezekiah (reign c. 716–697/687 BCE), the walls of Jerusalem were expanded westward, across the Central Valley from the City of David and the Temple Mount, enclosing a previously unwalled suburb in the area known today as the Western Hill of the Old City.

===Exploration===
Archaeological exploration of the area began in the nineteenth century, with excavations undertaken by Charles Warren in 1867. Warren was sent by the Palestine Exploration Fund. Warren conducted an excavation of the area south of the Temple Mount and recovered a massive fortification. The finding led him to conduct more excavations at the area south of the Temple Mount. There he revealed a vertical shaft descending from a slanted tunnel to an apparent water source. He suggested that the shaft was used to supply water to the city, which he believed was the old biblical city of David. Today this shaft is called after its discoverer &quot;Warren&#x27;s shaft&quot;, but his interpretation has been proven wrong, as the shaft is not man-made and had not yet been discovered by Jerusalem&#x27;s inhabitants in the 10th century BCE.

There have been numerous excavations since and several digs are currently underway. Complete chronological lists of the digs are available at the website of the Israel Antiquities Authority, dating to following periods:
*Late Ottoman
*British Mandate
*Jordanian
*early Israeli

In 2010, an archaeological survey of the City of David was conducted by Rina Avner, Eliahu Shukron and Ronny Reich, on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA). In 2012–2013, two teams of archaeologists conducted surveys of the area on behalf of the IAA; one led by Joseph (Joe) Uzziel, and the other by Yuval Gadot. Archaeological surveys in the City of David continued in 2014, led by Uzziel, and Nahshon Szanton.

===Dating===
A four-year project started in 2017, called &quot;Setting the Clock in the City of David&quot; and led by Yuval Gadot, an archaeologist at Tel Aviv University together with Elisabetta Boaretto (Weizmann Institute of Science), plus two Israel Antiquities Authority archaeologists, Joe Uziel and Doron Ben Ami, intends to carbon-14 date sites in Jerusalem. At the time only ten reliable carbon dates existed from all of the city&#x27;s digs. According to Gadot, the chronology of Jerusalem is &quot;an assumption on an assumption on an assumption&quot;. The results of several studies have been published including for the Gihon Spring Tower and for Wilson&#x27;s Arch.

==Archaeological sites==
There are several excavated sections known as Area A, B, C, etc., which include city walls, water systems, remains of buildings and more.

The City of David is traditionally considered to be on the ridge squeezed in by the Central (Tyropoeon) Valley to the west and the Qidron Valley to the east, with the Hinnom Valley bordering it from the south, and distinct from the Ophel saddle area to its north and with the city walls ending before the King&#x27;s Garden to the south. Here is an incomplete overview of archaeological sites inside the presumed city, and adjacent to it.

===Moat===
An at least 70-metre long, 30-metre wide and 9-metre deep moat, separating the Southeastern Ridge from the Ophel and the top of the Temple Mount, was identified in 2023 in the Givati parking lot dig, with an additional segment to the east discovered by Kathleen Kenyon in the 1960s and now understood as part of the same defensive ditch. It is not possible to determine when it was hewn out of the bedrock, but it was in place by the Late Iron Age IIA, around 900 BCE. It reached from Jerusalem&#x27;s central valley (Josephus&#x27; Tyropoeon Valley) in the west, to the western slopes of the Qidron Valley north of the Stepped Stone Structure, thus either protecting the northern walls of the Bronze Age city if it is indeed that old, or separating the Iron Age II, so Israelite acropolis, which possibly included the Temple Mount, from the residential part of the city. Researchers tentatively connected it to a passage from the Hebrew Bible, , where a gap in the walls of David&#x27;s city is mentioned. After significantly modifying Jerusalem&#x27;s topography for centuries, the moat disappeared again in the Late Hellenistic period, when it was backfilled as part of construction activities.

===Upper (northern) area===
In the uppermost (northern area):
*The Large Stone Structure
*The Stepped Stone Structure

City of David archaeologist Eilat Mazar believes that a so-called Large Stone Structure she has discovered at the upper area of the site and tentatively dated to the tenth to ninth century BC, may be the palace of King David. Not far from that excavation area a number of bullae (seal impressions) were unearthed, bearing the names of Yehucal son of Shelemiah and Gedaliah son of Pashhur, two officials mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah.

===Gihon Spring and water systems===
The Gihon Spring is a major water source used in several successive ancient water systems.

The remains at the site include several water tunnels, one of which, the Siloam Tunnel, was built by King Hezekiah and still carries water, along with several pools including the Pool of Siloam known from the Old and New Testaments.

*The Gihon Spring, which lies on the eastern slope of the southeastern hill of Jerusalem aka the City of David, and is generally considered the very reason why the city first emerged at this specific location. It has been noted that above the Gihon Spring was found a massive town wall, which wall is used to determine the location of the ancient settlement. 
The ancient water systems connected to the Gihon Spring include natural, masonry-built, and rock-cut structures, such as
*The Spring Tower
*Warren&#x27;s Shaft, a natural shaft, once thought to have been a water supply system. Although within the bounds of the City of David, it is thought to have been inaccessible during the period attributed to King David.
*The Siloam Channel, a Canaanite (Bronze Age) water system that preceded the Siloam Tunnel
*The Siloam Tunnel (also known as Hezekiah&#x27;s Tunnel), an Iron Age water supply system where the Siloam inscription was found
*The Siloam Pool - two connected pools, an upper one from the Byzantine period at the exit of the Siloam Tunnel, and the recently discovered, lower pool dating to the Hasmonean part of the Second Temple Period.

===Eastern slope===
On the eastern slope of the ridge, towards the Qidron Valley:
*City walls and towers, a columbarium, rock-cut vaulted tunnels once interpreted as royal Judahite tombs (T1 and T2), a rock-cut pool where the Theodotus Inscription was discovered (for associated synagogue see here), etc.

===Central Valley street and channel===
* The Jerusalem Water Channel, a large drainage system running down the Central (Tyropoeon) Valley, covered by the following:
* A monumental stepped street probably used by Second Temple-period pilgrims and built over the Jerusalem Water Channel.

===South of the city===
Outside the walls to the south:
*King&#x27;s Garden (excavated in 1894–1897 by Bliss and Dickie).

===Givati area west of Central Valley===
The Giv&#x27;ati Parking Lot excavations extend over an area of about 5 dunams (1.2 acres).

Here archaeologists claim to have found the remains of the Acra, a fortress built by Antiochus Epiphanes to subdue those Jerusalemites who were opposed to Hellenisation.

===Ophel area north of the city===
See Ophel: Jerusalem &quot;ophel&quot;.

==Finds by period==
===Chalcolithic (4500–3500 BCE)===
Chalcolithic remains include bits of pottery found in clefts in the bedrock by Macalister and Duncan. The expedition also discovered a number of places where the bedrock had been cut in various ways. These included areas where the rock had been smoothed and others where it had been cut to form flow channels. There were also several groups of small basins, sometimes called cup marks, cut into the bedrock. These are assumed to have been used for some form of agricultural processing. Macalister and Duncan speculated that they were used in olive oil processing.
Edwin C. M. van den Brink, who notes that similar carved basins have been found at Beit Shemesh and near Modi&#x27;in-Maccabim-Re&#x27;ut, speculates that they may have been created by repeated grinding and crushing activity, such as the grinding of grain or the crushing of olives. Eilat Mazar speculates that they were used to collect rainwater.

===Early Bronze Age (3500–2350 BCE)===
Pieces of pottery have been found.

===Middle Bronze Age (2000–1550 BCE)===
Middle Bronze Age Jerusalem is mentioned several times in Egyptian texts from the 19th–18th centuries BCE.

===Late Bronze Age (1550–1200 BCE)===
Pottery and bronze arrowheads dating form this period have been found.

In 2010, a fragment of a clay tablet dating from the 14th century BCE was uncovered, making it the oldest written document yet uncovered in Jerusalem. It is dated by the writing it bears, in an ancient Akkadian cuneiform script. The text was deciphered by graduate student Takayoshi Oshima working under professor Wayne Horowitz. According to Horowitz, the quality of the writing indicates that this was a royal inscription, apparently a letter from the king of Jerusalem to the pharaoh in Egypt. Professor Christopher Rollston points out that there is no mention of any personal names or titles and no place names in the document. He notes that the quality of the script is good but that this does not show that it is &quot;international royal correspondence.&quot; He also suggests that caution should be taken before positing a definite date as it is not a stratified find, having been discovered after excavation in a &quot;wet sieving&quot; process.

===Iron Age I (1200–980/70 BCE)===
In 2024, several researchers published a number of radiocarbon tests conducted in five different parts of the City of David which they argue provide evidence for the existence of an urban settlement in Jerusalem all through the 12th–10th centuries BCE.

===Iron Age IIa (1000–925/900 BCE)===
The period of the tenth and ninth centuries BCE has been the subject of an intense scholarly dispute, as well as of ongoing archaeological investigations.

The 2005 discovery by archaeologist Eilat Mazar of a Large Stone Structure, which she dated to the tenth century BCE, would be evidence of buildings in Jerusalem of a size appropriate to the capital of a centralized kingdom at that time. Others, most notably Israel Finkelstein of Tel Aviv University, argue that the structure could, for the most part, be from the much later Hasmonean period. However, new evidence continues to emerge from the dig. Mazar&#x27;s date is supported by 10th century imported luxury goods found within the Large Stone Structure, including two Phoenician-style ivory inlays once attached to iron objects. Comparable objects found in a Phoenician tomb at Achziv suggest that they may have decorated a sword handle. A quantity of luxury round, carinated bowls with red slip and hand burnishing support both the tenth century date and a sophisticated, urban lifestyle. A bone has been radiocarbon dated by Elisabetta Boaretto at the Weizmann Institute, showing a probable date between 1050 and 780 BCE. A large section of a &quot;delicate and elegant&quot; black-on-red jug, also found in the structure, is of a kind dated to the second half of the tenth century BCE.

In 2010 Mazar announced the discovery of what she believed to be a 10th-century BCE city wall. According to Mazar, &quot;It&#x27;s the most significant construction we have from First Temple days in Israel,&quot; and &quot;It means that at that time, the 10th century, in Jerusalem there was a regime capable of carrying out such construction.&quot; Aren Maeir, an archaeology professor at Bar Ilan University, said he has yet to see evidence that the fortifications are as old as Mazar claims.

Doron Ben-Ami wrote in 2014 that, on the basis of his own excavations in the Givati parking lot area bordering on the &quot;City of David&quot; from the north-west, there was apparently no 10th-century city wall: &quot;Had a fortified settlement existed in the City of David, then the course of the city wall on the west would have had to pass through the Givati excavation area. No such city wall has thus far been found. This means that the Iron Age IIa settlement [c. 1000–925 BCE] was not fortified.&quot; Ben-Ami&#x27;s findings stand in stark contrast to those of R. Reich and E. Shukron who, on the basis of their findings, have disproved Warren&#x27;s theory that King David (c. 1000 BCE) captured Jerusalem by entering into the city through the shaft now known as Warren&#x27;s Shaft, and have concluded that the shaft was largely in disuse at that time, although it was within the city and the city was, indeed, encompassed by a monumental wall which they had excavated. This ancient wall, found on the eastern-most flank of the Kidron valley in the ancient City of David, rather than in the Giv&#x27;ati Parking Lot, was preserved in its full height (6 m.), measuring 2 m. in width.

The discrepancy can perhaps be attributed to the limited confines of the Giv&#x27;ati Parking Lot and where Ben-Ami and his team were expecting to find a wall when, in fact, the ancient wall went beyond the bounds of the excavated Parking Lot.

===Iron Age IIb (c. 925–720 BCE)===
Ben-Ami goes on saying that his Givati findings indicate that &quot;the fortified city of the Iron IIB, which encompassed both the City of David and the Western Hill, had no need for a fortification line between these two sectors of the city.&quot; Nevertheless, subsequent excavations at Givati and other sites have shown that 9th century Jerusalem &quot;included an acropolis to the north and a city on the lower, southeastern, ridge with a barrier separating the two.&quot;

====The related necropolis (9th–7th centuries BCE)====

The elaborate rock-cut tombs of the Israelite period, forming what is known as the Silwan necropolis and dating from the 9th to the 7th centuries BCE, are found outside Wadi Hilweh/the City of David, on the ridge on the opposite, eastern side of the Kidron Valley in and under the Arab village of Silwan. These are large, elaborate tombs of skilfully cut into the stone face of the eastern slope, such as could only have been built by the highest-ranking members of a wealthy society. According to David Ussishkin, &quot;here ministers, nobles and notables of the kingdom of Judah were buried.&quot;

The architecture of the tombs and the manner of burial is different &quot;from anything known from contemporary Palestine. Elements such as entrances located high above the surface, gabled ceilings, straight ceilings with a cornice, 13 trough-shaped resting-places with pillows, above-ground tombs, and inscriptions engraved on the facade appear only here.&quot; However, the stone benches were carved with headrests in a style borrowed from the Egyptian Hathor wig. Ussishkin believes that the architectural similarity to building styles of the Phoenician cities validates the biblical description of Phoenician influence on the Israelite kingdoms, but speculates that some or all of the tombs may have been built by Phoenician aristocrats living in Jerusalem.

Although only three partial inscriptions survive, the paleography makes the dating certain and they suffice for most archaeologists to identify one tomb with the Biblical Shebna, steward and treasurer of King Hezekiah.

===Iron Age IIIb (8th century – 586 BCE)===

This is the period that corresponds to the biblical Kings Hezekiah through Josiah and the destruction of the Kingdom of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar II.

King Hezekiah secured the city&#x27;s water supply against siege by employing his men to dig a conduit deep within the meleke limestone bedrock and, in so doing, to divert the waters of the Gihon Spring to a place on the west side of the City of David, and covering over all signs of the source of the spring and the fortifications that had surrounded it in earlier periods. He built the Pool of Siloam as a water reservoir. Hezekiah then surrounded the new reservoir and the city&#x27;s burgeoning western suburbs with a new city wall.

Bullae with the names of Yehucal son of Shelemiah and Gedaliah son of Pashhur, two officials mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah, have been found.

In 2019, during the excavations of the Givati Parking lot, a seal bearing Paleo-Hebrew inscription was discovered, belonging to &quot;Natan-Melech the King’s Servant&quot;.

===Babylonian and Persian periods (586–322 BCE)===
Two bullae in the Neo-Babylonian style, one showing a priest standing beside an altar to the gods Marduk and Nabu. A polished, black, scaraboid stone seal showing a &quot;Babylonian cultic scene&quot; of two bearded men standing on each side of an altar dedicated to the Babylonian moon god Sin. The scaraboid is understood to have been produced in Babylonia, with space left below that altar for a personal name. In that space are Hebrew letters that Peter van der Veen has read as the name &quot;Shelomit&quot;.

===Hasmoneans, Herodians and Roman governors (167 BCE – 70 CE)===
Major archaeological finds include the Pool of Siloam, and the monumental stepped road built by Pilate and drained by an impressive channel. Active Roman-era excavations are also underway at the Givati Parking Lot dig site, where the remains of a palace attributed to Queen Helena of Adiabene were discovered in 2007.

===Byzantine period (324–628 CE)===

The Byzantine-period mansion called &quot;the &quot;Eusebius&quot; house&quot; stood in the area now underneath the visitor&#x27;s center, atop the central part of E. Mazar&#x27;s Large Stone Structure.

During the excavation of the area adjacent to the west, the so-called Givati Parking Lot dig, many Byzantine-period finds were made, including a hoard of 264 gold coins from the time of Emperor Heraclius (7th century CE).

==Controversies==
In 2018, a leaked report by the European Union cited the area as one being developed for tourism to justify Israeli settlements, considered illegal under international law, and insist on Jewish heritage at the expense of its Palestinian context.

Israeli archaeology at the site has been criticized; Tel Aviv University Professor Rafi Greenberg stated that archaeological practice at the site is &quot;completely subsumed to political and corporate motivations that are, however, largely unacknowledged by its &#x27;neutral&#x27; practitioners, leading to questionable field practice and overtly skewed interpretations of the past&quot;.

In a 2015 report on Israeli archaeology, the National Academy of Sciences criticized the political use of archeology and the extensive cooperation between Elad and the Nature and Parks Authority. Elad&#x27;s head, David Be&#x27;eri, declined to appear before the committee and said the report was biased against Elad.

==Tourism==

The entire site, including the Gihon Spring and the two Pools of Siloam, is incorporated in an archaeological park open to the public. Visitors can wade through the Siloam Tunnel, through which the waters of the ancient spring still flow. Because of a change in the water table the once-intermittent karstic spring is artificially maintained through pumping.

<text>Banjul (, ), officially the City of Banjul, is the capital city of The Gambia. It is the centre of the eponymous administrative division which is home to an estimated 400,000 residents, making it The Gambia&#x27;s largest and most densely populated metropolitan area. The city Banjul is located on St Mary&#x27;s Island (Banjul Island), where the Gambia River enters the Atlantic Ocean.

The population of the city proper is 31,301, with the Greater Banjul Area, which includes the City of Banjul and the Kanifing Municipal Council, at a population of 413,397 (2013 census). The island is connected to the mainland to the west and the rest of Greater Banjul Area via bridges. There are also ferries linking Banjul to the mainland at the other side of the river.

From the 19th century until 24 April 1973, the city was known as Bathurst.

==Etymology==
There are several etymologies for &#x27;Banjul.&#x27; One traditional history recounts that Bandjougou, son of Barafin, came to the island after fleeing the attacks of Soumaoro Kante on the Manding region. His name became attached to the island, and over time changed to &#x27;Bandjoulou&#x27;.
Another theory claims that Banjul takes its name from &quot;Bang julo&quot;, the Mandinka word for rope fibre that the Mandinka people gathered on the island.

==History==



In 1651, Banjul was leased by the Duke of Courland and Semigallia (German: &quot;Herzog von Kurland und Semgallen&quot;) from the King of Kombo, as part of the Couronian colonization.

On 23 April 1816, Tumani Bojang, the King of Kombo, ceded Banjul Island to Alexander Grant, the British commandant, in exchange for an annual fee of 103 iron bars. Grant&#x27;s expedition, consisting of 75 men and tasked with establishing a military garrison, had been ordered by Charles MacCarthy. Grant founded Banjul as a trading post and base, constructing houses and barracks for controlling entrance to the Gambia estuary and suppressing the slave trade. The British renamed Banjul Island as St. Mary&#x27;s Island and named the new town Bathurst, after the 3rd Earl Bathurst, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies at the time. Streets were laid out in a modified grid pattern, and named after Allied generals at the Battle of Waterloo. The town became the centre of British activity in the Gambia Colony and Protectorate.
Within a few years of its establishment, the town started attracting migrants. Its population consisted of Africans of various origins, Levantines (Syrians, Lebanese) as well as Europeans (English, French, Portuguese). A majority of the population was Muslim but there was a significant Christian minority, including the Aku inhabitants. The majority of the Africans consisted of Wolof people, whose population rose from 829 in 1881 to 3,666 in 1901 and then 10,130 in 1944. They had mainly hailed from Gorée and Saint-Louis. The Mandinka were the second largest African group, followed by the Jola as well as the Fula. The Serer people make up 3.5% of the country&#x27;s demographics. Islamic schools called &quot;dara&quot; were founded in Bathurst from its early years, resulting in the foundation of the first Muslim court in 1905, in addition to the increasingly more sophisticated British legal framework.

Bathurst was officially declared the capital of the Protectorate of the Gambia in 1889, leading to an increase in population. Through the 20th century, it became an even greater attraction for Gambians due to the availability of jobs fuelled by British colonial activities as well as social activities such as cinemas. Young men from rural farming villages would move to Bathurst to work at the Public Works Department (established in 1922) or docks. The town was an important Allied naval and air hub during World War II, resulting in an increase in population from 14,370 in 1931 to 21,154 in 1944.
After independence, the town&#x27;s name was changed to Banjul in 1973. On 22 July 1994, Banjul was the scene of a bloodless military coup d&#x27;état in which President Sir Dawda Jawara was overthrown and replaced by Yahya Jammeh. To commemorate this event, Arch 22 was built as an entrance portal to the capital. The gate is 35 metres tall and stands at the centre of an open square. It houses a textile museum.

==Climate==

Banjul features hot weather year round. Under the Köppen climate classification, Banjul features a tropical wet and dry climate (&quot;Aw&quot;). The city features a lengthy dry season, spanning from November to May and a relatively short wet season covering the remaining five months. However, during those five months, Banjul tends to see heavy rainfall. August is usually the rainiest month, with on average of rainfall. Maximum temperatures are somewhat constant, though morning minima tend to be hotter during the wet season than the dry season.

According to a Gambian government minister, Banjul is at risk of submerging under water by a metre rise in sea levels as a result of climate change and global warming.

=== Climate change ===

A 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a &quot;moderate&quot; scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~ by 2100, the climate of Banjul in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Bamako in Mali. The annual temperature would increase by , and the temperature of the warmest month by , while the temperature of the coldest month would actually decrease by . According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with , which closely matches RCP 4.5.

==Districts==

Banjul Division (Greater Banjul Area) is divided into two districts:
*Banjul

==Economy==

Banjul is the country&#x27;s economic and administrative centre and includes the Central Bank of the Gambia. Peanut processing is the country&#x27;s principal industry, but beeswax, palm wood, palm oil, and skins and hides are also shipped from the port of Banjul.

Banjul is also the home of the Gambia Technical Training Institute. GTTI is engaged in a partnership with non-profit organization Power Up Gambia to develop a solar energy training program.

==Transport==
The primary method of reaching the city by land is by road. A highway connects Banjul to Serrekunda which crosses the Denton Bridge, however ferries provide another mode of transportation. As of May 2014, ferries sail regularly from Banjul across the Gambia River to Barra. The city is served by the Banjul International Airport. Banjul is on the Trans–West African Coastal Highway connecting it to Dakar and Bissau, which will eventually provide a paved highway link to 11 other nations of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
