<text>Errol Leslie Thomson Flynn (20 June 1909 – 14 October 1959) was an Australian and American actor who achieved worldwide fame during the Golden Age of Hollywood. He was known for his romantic swashbuckler roles, frequent partnerships with Olivia de Havilland, and reputation for his womanising and hedonistic personal life. His most notable roles include Robin Hood in &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938), which was later named by the American Film Institute as the 18th-greatest hero in American film history, the lead role in &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935), Major Geoffrey Vickers in &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1936), and the hero in a number of Westerns such as &quot;Dodge City&quot; (1939), &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot;, &quot;Virginia City&quot; (both 1940) and &quot;San Antonio&quot; (1945).

Flynn was posthumously awarded two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion picture and television industries in 1960.

==Early life==

Errol Leslie Thomson Flynn was born on 20 June 1909 at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Battery Point, Tasmania. His father, Theodore Thomson Flynn, was a lecturer (1909) and later professor (1911) of marine biology and zoology at the University of Tasmania and Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast where he served as the Chair of Zoology. His father was the first biology professor in Tasmania. His mother was born Lily Mary Young, but shortly after marrying Theodore at St John&#x27;s Church of England, Birchgrove, Sydney, on 23 January 1909, she changed her first name to Marelle. Flynn had a younger sister, Nora Rosemary Flynn (1919-1981). Flynn described his mother&#x27;s family as &quot;seafaring folk&quot; and this appears to be where his lifelong interest in boats and the sea originated. Both of his parents were Australian-born of Irish, English and Scottish descent. Despite Flynn&#x27;s claims, the evidence indicates that he was not descended from any of the &quot;Bounty&quot; mutineers.

Flynn received his early schooling in Hobart. Future World Correspondence Chess Champion Cecil Purdy was one of his classmates. He attended The Hutchins School, Hobart College, The Friends School and Albuera Street Primary School and was expelled from each one. He made one of his first appearances as a performer in 1918, aged nine when he served as a page boy to Enid Lyons in a queen carnival. In her memoirs, Lyons recalled Flynn as &quot;a dashing figure—a handsome boy of nine with a fearless, somewhat haughty expression, already showing that sang-froid for which he was later to become famous throughout the civilised world&quot;. She further noted: &quot;Unfortunately, Errol, at the age of nine, did not yet possess that magic for extracting money from the public which so distinguished his career as an actor. Our cause gained no apparent advantage from his presence in my entourage; we gained only third place in a field of seven.&quot;

From 1923 to 1925, Flynn attended the South West London College, a private boarding school in Barnes, London.

In 1926, he returned to Australia to attend Sydney Church of England Grammar School (known as &quot;Shore&quot;), where he was the classmate of a future Australian prime minister, John Gorton. His formal education ended with his expulsion from Shore for theft, although he later claimed it was for a sexual encounter with the school&#x27;s laundress.

After being dismissed from a job as a junior clerk with a Sydney shipping company for pilfering petty cash, he went to Papua New Guinea at the age of eighteen, seeking his fortune in tobacco planting and gold mining in the Morobe Goldfield. He spent the next five years oscillating between living in New Guinea and Sydney.

In January 1931, Flynn became engaged to Naomi Campbell-Dibbs, the youngest daughter of Robert and Emily Hamlyn (Brown) Campbell-Dibbs of Temora and Bowral, New South Wales. They did not marry.

==Early career==
===&quot;In the Wake of the Bounty&quot; (1933)===
Australian filmmaker Charles Chauvel was making a film about the mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot;, &quot;In the Wake of the Bounty&quot; (1933), a combination of dramatic re-enactments of the mutiny and a documentary on present-day Pitcairn Island. Chauvel was looking for someone to play the role of Fletcher Christian. There are different stories about the way Flynn was cast. According to one, Chauvel saw his picture in an article about a yacht wreck involving Flynn. The most popular account is that he was discovered by cast member John Warwick. The film was not a strong success at the box office, but Flynn was the lead role, leading him to travel to Britain in late 1933 to pursue a career in acting.

=== Britain ===
Flynn got work as an extra in a film, &quot;I Adore You&quot; (1933), produced by Irving Asher for Warner Bros. He soon secured a job with the Northampton Repertory Company at the town&#x27;s Royal Theatre (now part of Royal &amp; Derngate), where he worked and received his training as a professional actor for seven months. He performed at the 1934 Malvern Festival and in Glasgow, and briefly in London&#x27;s West End.

In 1934, Flynn was dismissed from Northampton Rep. after he threw a female stage manager down a stairwell. He returned to London. Asher cast him as the lead in &quot;Murder at Monte Carlo&quot;, a &quot;quota quickie&quot; made by Warner Brothers at their Teddington Studios in Middlesex. The movie was not widely seen (it is a lost film), but Asher was enthusiastic about Flynn&#x27;s performance and cabled Warner Bros in Hollywood, recommending him for a contract. Executives agreed, and Flynn was sent to Los Angeles.

==Hollywood==

On the ship from London, Flynn met (and eventually married) Lili Damita, an actress five years his senior whose contacts proved invaluable when Flynn arrived in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. publicity described him as an &quot;Irish leading man of the London stage&quot;.

His first appearance was a small role in &quot;The Case of the Curious Bride&quot; (1935). Flynn had two scenes, one as a corpse and one in flashback. His next part was slightly bigger, in &quot;Don&#x27;t Bet on Blondes&quot; (1935), a B-picture screwball comedy.

===&quot;Captain Blood&quot; and stardom===
Warner Bros. was preparing a big-budget swashbuckler, &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935), based on the 1922 novel by Rafael Sabatini and directed by Michael Curtiz.

The studio originally intended to cast Robert Donat, but he turned down the part, afraid that his chronic asthma would make it impossible for him to perform the strenuous role. Warners considered a number of other actors, including Leslie Howard and James Cagney, and also conducted screen tests of those they had under contract, like Flynn. The tests were impressive, and Warners finally cast Flynn in the lead, opposite 19-year-old Olivia de Havilland. The resulting film was a magnificent success for the studio and gave birth to two new Hollywood stars and an on-screen partnership that would encompass eight films over six years. The budget for &quot;Captain Blood&quot; was $1.242 million, and it made $1.357 million in the U.S. and $1.733 million overseas, meaning a huge profit for Warner Bros.

Flynn had been selected to support Fredric March in &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; (1936), but public response to &quot;Captain Blood&quot; was so enthusiastic that Warners instead reunited him with de Havilland and Curtiz in another adventure tale, this time set during the Crimean War, &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1936). The film was given a slightly larger budget than &quot;Captain Blood&quot;, at $1.33 million, and it had a much higher box-office gross, earning $1.454 million in the U.S. and $1.928 million overseas, making it Warner Bros.&#x27; No. 1 hit of 1936.

Flynn asked for a different kind of role, and so when ill health made Leslie Howard drop out of the screen adaptation of Lloyd C. Douglas&#x27; inspirational novel, Flynn got the lead role in &quot;Green Light&quot; (1937), playing a doctor searching for a cure for Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The studio then put him back into another swashbuckler, replacing Patric Knowles as Miles Hendon in &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1937). He appeared opposite Kay Francis in &quot;Another Dawn&quot; (1937), a melodrama set in a mythical British desert colony. Warners then gave Flynn his first starring role in a modern comedy, &quot;The Perfect Specimen&quot; (1937), with Joan Blondell, under the direction of Curtiz. Meanwhile, Flynn published his first book, &quot;Beam Ends&quot; (1937), an autobiographical account of his experiences sailing around Australia as a youth. He also travelled to Spain, in 1937, as a war correspondent during the Spanish Civil War, in which he sympathised with the Republicans.

===&quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938)===

Flynn followed this with his most famous movie, &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938), playing the title role, opposite de Havilland&#x27;s Marian. This movie was a global success. It was the 6th-top movie grosser of 1938. It was also the studio&#x27;s first large-budget colour film using the three-strip Technicolor process. The budget for &quot;Robin Hood&quot; was the highest ever for a Warner Bros. production up to that point—$2.47 million—but it more than made back its costs and turned a huge profit as it grossed $2.343 million in the U.S. and $2.495 million overseas.

It also received lavish praise from critics and became a world favourite; in 2019, Rotten Tomatoes summarised the critical consensus: &quot;Errol Flynn thrills as the legendary title character, and the film embodies the type of imaginative family adventure tailor-made for the silver screen&quot;. In 1995, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation by the National Film Registry. Years later, in a 2005 interview, de Havilland described how, during the filming, she decided to tease Flynn, whose wife was on the set and watching closely. De Havilland said, &quot;And so we had one kissing scene, which I looked forward to with great delight. I remember I blew every take, at least six in a row, maybe seven, maybe eight, and we had to kiss all over again. And Errol Flynn got really rather uncomfortable, and he had, if I may say so, a little trouble with his tights.&quot;

The final duel between Robin and Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone) is a classic, echoing the battle on the beach in &quot;Captain Blood&quot; where Flynn also kills Rathbone&#x27;s character after a long demonstration of fine swordplay, in that case choreographed by Ralph Faulkner. According to Faulkner&#x27;s student, Tex Allen, &quot;Faulkner had good material to work with. Veteran Basil Rathbone was a good fencer already, and Flynn, though new to the school of fence, was athletic and a quick learner&quot;.

The success of &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; did little to convince the studio that their prize swashbuckler should be allowed to do other things, but Warners allowed Flynn to try a screwball comedy, &quot;Four&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; (1938). Despite the presence of de Havilland and the direction of Curtiz, it was not a success. &quot;The Sisters&quot; (1938), a drama showing the lives of three sisters in the years from 1904 to 1908, including a dramatic rendering of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, was more popular. Flynn played alcoholic sports reporter Frank Medlin, who sweeps Louise Elliott (Bette Davis) off her feet on a visit to Silver Bow, Montana. Their married life in San Francisco is difficult, and Frank sails to Singapore just hours before the catastrophe. The original ending of the film was the same as the book: Louise married a character named William Benson, but preview audiences disliked the ending, and a new one was filmed in which Frank comes to Silver Bow to find her, and they reconcile. Apparently, audiences wanted Errol Flynn to &quot;get the girl&quot; or vice versa. (Bette Davis preferred the original ending.)

Flynn had a powerful dramatic role in &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot; (1938), a remake of a pre-code 1930 drama of the same title about Royal Flying Corps fighter pilots in World War I and the devastating burden carried by officers who must send men out to die every morning. Flynn and co-stars Basil Rathbone and David Niven led a cast that was all male and predominantly British. Director Edmund Goulding&#x27;s biographer Matthew Kennedy wrote: &quot;Everyone remembered a set filled with fraternal good cheer... The filming of &quot;Dawn Patrol&quot; was an unusual experience for everyone connected with it, and dissipated for all time the legend that Britishers are lacking in a sense of humor... The picture was made to the accompaniment of more ribbing than Hollywood has ever witnessed. The setting for all this horseplay was the beautiful English manners of the cutterups. The expressions of polite and pained shock on the faces of Niven, Flynn, Rathbone et al., when (women) visitors were embarrassed was the best part of the nonsense.&quot;

In 1939, Flynn and de Havilland teamed up with Curtiz for &quot;Dodge City&quot; (1939), the first Western for both of them, set after the U.S. Civil War. Flynn was worried that audiences would not accept him in Westerns, but the film was Warner&#x27;s most popular film of 1939, and he went on to make a number of movies in that genre.

===Second World War===

Flynn was reunited with Davis, Curtiz and de Havilland in &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot; (1939), playing Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Flynn&#x27;s relationship with Davis during filming was quarrelsome; Davis allegedly slapped him across the face far harder than necessary during one scene. Flynn attributed her anger to unrequited romantic interest, but according to others, Davis resented sharing equal billing with a man she considered incapable of playing any role beyond a dashing adventurer. &quot;He himself openly said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know really anything about acting, she told an interviewer, &quot;and I admire his honesty because he&#x27;s absolutely right.&quot; Years later, however, de Havilland said that during a private screening of &quot;Elizabeth and Essex&quot;, an astounded Davis had exclaimed, &quot;Damn it! The man &quot;could&quot; act!&quot;

Warners put Flynn in another Western, &quot;Virginia City&quot; (1940), set near the end of the Civil War. Flynn played Union officer Kerry Bradford. In an article for TCM, Jeremy Arnold wrote: &quot;Ironically, the Randolph Scott role [as Captain Vance Irby, commandant of the prison camp where Bradford was a prisoner of war] was originally conceived for Flynn... In fact, &quot;Virginia City&quot; was plagued with script, production and personnel problems all along. Shooting began without a finished script, angering Flynn, who complained unsuccessfully to the studio about it. Flynn disliked the temperamental Curtiz and tried to have him removed from the film. Curtiz didn&#x27;t like Flynn (or co-star Miriam Hopkins) either. Humphrey Bogart apparently did not care for Flynn or Randolph Scott. Making matters worse was the steady rain that fell for two of the three weeks of location shooting near Flagstaff, Arizona. Flynn detested rain and was physically unwell for quite some time because of it. As Peter Valenti has written, &quot;Errol&#x27;s frustration at the role can be easily understood: he changed from antagonist to protagonist, from Southern to Northern officer, almost as the film was being shot. [This] intensified Errol&#x27;s feelings of inadequacy as a performer and his contempt for studio operation&quot;. Despite the troubles behind the scenes, the film was a huge success, making a profit of just under $1 million.

Flynn&#x27;s next film had been planned since 1936: another swashbuckler taken from a Sabatini novel, &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (1940), but only the title was used. A reviewer observed in &quot;Time&quot; 19 August 1940, &quot;&quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (Warner) is 1940&#x27;s lustiest assault on the double feature. It cost $1,700,000 and exhibits Errol Flynn and 3,000 other cinema actors performing every imaginable feat of spectacular derring-do, and lasts two hours and seven minutes... Produced by Warner&#x27;s Hal Wallis with a splendour that would set parsimonious Queen Bess&#x27;s teeth on edge, constructed of the most tried-and-true cinema materials available, &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; is a handsome, shipshape picture. To Irish Cinemactor Errol Flynn, it gives the best swashbuckling role he has had since Captain Blood. For Hungarian Director Michael Curtiz, who took Flynn from bit-player ranks to make &quot;Captain Blood&quot; and has made nine pictures with him since, it should prove a high point in their profitable relationship.&quot; It was not, but &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; made a profit of $977,000 on that budget of $1.7 million.
Another financial success was the Western &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot; (1940), with de Havilland and Ronald Reagan and directed by Curtiz, which grossed $2,147,663 in the U.S., making it Warner Brothers&#x27; second-biggest hit of 1940. At the zenith of his career, Flynn was voted the fourteenth most popular star in the U.S. and the seventh most popular in Britain according to &quot;Motion Picture Daily&quot;. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, he was the fourth-biggest star in the U.S. and the fourth-biggest box-office attraction overseas as well.

Flynn consistently ranked among Warner Bros.&#x27;s top stars. In 1937, he was the studio&#x27;s No. 1 star, ahead of Paul Muni and Bette Davis. In 1938, he was No. 3, just behind Davis and Muni. In 1939, he was No. 3 again, this time behind Davis and James Cagney. In 1940 and 1941, he was Warner Bros.&#x27;s No. 1 top box-office draw. In 1942, he was No. 2, behind Cagney. In 1943, he was No. 2, behind Humphrey Bogart. Warners allowed Flynn a change of pace from a long string of period pieces in a light-hearted mystery, &quot;Footsteps in the Dark&quot; (1941). &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&#x27; Edwin Schallert wrote: &quot;Errol Flynn becomes a modern for a change in a whodunit film and the excursion proves eminently worth-while... an exceptionally clever and amusing exhibit ...&quot; The film was not a big success; far more popular was the military drama &quot;Dive Bomber&quot; (1941), his last film with Curtiz.

In later years, &quot;Footsteps in the Dark&quot; co-star Ralph Bellamy recalled Flynn at this time as &quot;a darling. Couldn&#x27;t or wouldn&#x27;t take himself seriously. And he drank like there was no tomorrow. Had a bum ticker from the malaria he&#x27;d picked up in Australia. Also, a spot of TB. Tried to enlist but flunked his medical, so he drank some more. Knew he wouldn&#x27;t live into old age. He really had a ball in &quot;Footsteps in the Dark&quot;. He was so glad to be out of swashbucklers&quot;.

Flynn became a naturalised American citizen on 14 August 1942. With the United States fully involved in the Second World War, he attempted to enlist in the armed services but failed the physical exam due to recurrent malaria (contracted in New Guinea), a heart murmur, various venereal diseases and latent pulmonary tuberculosis. Flynn was mocked by reporters and critics as a &quot;draft dodger&quot; because the studio refused to admit that their star, promoted for his physical beauty and athleticism, had been disqualified due to health problems.

Flynn started a new long-term relationship with a director when he teamed with Raoul Walsh in &quot;They Died with Their Boots On&quot; (1942), a biopic of George Armstrong Custer. De Havilland was his co-star in this, the last of eight films they made together. The movie grossed $2.55 million in the U.S. alone, making it Warner Bros.&#x27; second-biggest hit of 1942. Flynn&#x27;s first World War II film was &quot;Desperate Journey&quot; (1942), directed by Walsh, in which he played an Australian for the first time. It was another big hit.

The role of Gentleman Jim Corbett in Walsh&#x27;s &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; (1942) was one of Flynn&#x27;s favourites. Warner Bros. purchased the rights to make a film of Corbett&#x27;s life from his widow, Vera, specifically for their handsome, athletic and charming leading man. The movie bears little resemblance to the boxer&#x27;s life, but the story was a crowd-pleaser. Despite—or perhaps because of—its departure from reality, &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; packed the theatres. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, it was the third Errol Flynn movie to gross at least $2 million for Warner Bros. in 1942.

Flynn eagerly undertook extensive boxing training for this film, working with Buster Wiles and Mushy Callahan. Callahan&#x27;s remembrances were documented in Charles Higham&#x27;s &quot;Errol Flynn: The Untold Story&quot;. &quot;Errol tended to use his right fist. I had to teach him to use his left and to move very fast on his feet...Luckily, he had excellent footwork, he was dodgy, [and] he could duck faster than anybody I saw. And by the time I was through with him, he&#x27;d jab, jab, jab with his left like a veteran&quot;.

Flynn took the role seriously and was rarely doubled during the boxing sequences. In &quot;The Two Lives of Errol Flynn&quot; by Michael Freedland, Alexis Smith told of taking the star aside: &quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s so silly, working all day and then playing all night and dissipating yourself. Don&#x27;t you want to live a long life?&#x27; Errol was his usually apparently unconcerned self: &#x27;I&#x27;m only interested in this half,&#x27; he told her. &#x27;I don&#x27;t care for the future. Flynn collapsed on set on 15 July 1942, while filming a boxing scene with Ward Bond. Filming was shut down while he recovered; he returned a week later. In his autobiography, &quot;My Wicked, Wicked Ways&quot;, Flynn describes the episode as a mild heart attack. In September 1942, Warners announced that Flynn had signed a new contract with the studio for four films a year, one of which he would also produce.

In &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; (1943), set in Nazi-occupied Norway, Flynn played a Norwegian resistance fighter, a role originally intended for Edward G. Robinson. Director Lewis Milestone later recalled, &quot;Flynn kept underrating himself. If you wanted to embarrass him, all you had to do was to tell him how great he was in a scene he&#x27;d just finished playing: He&#x27;d blush like a young girl and muttering &#x27;I&#x27;m no actor&#x27; would go away somewhere and sit down&quot;. With a box office gross of $2.3 million in the U.S., it was Warner Bros.&#x27;s eighth-biggest movie of the year. In Warners&#x27; all-star musical comedy fund-raiser for the Stage Door Canteen, &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot; (1943), Flynn sings and dances as a cockney seaman boasting to his pub mates of how he&#x27;s won the war in &quot;That&#x27;s What You Jolly Well Get&quot;, the only musical number that was ever performed by Flynn on screen.

===Statutory rape charges===
In late 1942, two 17-year-old girls, Betty Hansen and Peggy Satterlee, separately accused Flynn of statutory rape at the Bel Air home of Flynn&#x27;s friend Frederick McEvoy, and on board Flynn&#x27;s yacht &quot;Sirocco&quot;, respectively. Satterlee was 15 years old at the time she had sex twice with Flynn aboard his boat. The scandal received immense press attention. Many of Flynn&#x27;s fans founded organisations to publicly protest the accusation. One such group, the American Boys&#x27; Club for the Defense of Errol Flynn—ABCDEF—accumulated a substantial membership that included William F. Buckley Jr.

The trial took place in late January and early February 1943. Flynn&#x27;s attorney, Jerry Giesler, impugned the accusers&#x27; character and morals and accused them of numerous indiscretions, including affairs with married men and, in Satterlee&#x27;s case, an abortion (which was illegal at the time). He noted that the two girls, who said they did not know each other, filed their complaints within days of each other, although the episodes allegedly took place more than a year apart. He implied that the girls had cooperated with prosecutors in hopes of avoiding prosecution themselves.

Flynn was acquitted, but the trial&#x27;s widespread coverage and lurid overtones permanently damaged his carefully cultivated screen image as an idealised romantic leading player.

===After the trial===
&quot;Northern Pursuit&quot; (1943), also with Walsh as director, was a war film set in Canada. He then made a film for his own production company, Thomson Productions, where he had a say in the choice of vehicle, director and cast, plus a portion of the profits. &quot;Uncertain Glory&quot; (1944), a war-time drama set in France with Flynn as a criminal who redeems himself, was not a success, earning only a modest gross of $1.5 million. Thomson Productions made no more movies. Still, Flynn earned $175,000 in 1943. With Walsh he made &quot;Objective, Burma!&quot; in 1944, released in 1945, a war film set during the Burma Campaign. Although popular, it was withdrawn in Britain after protests that the role played by British troops was not given sufficient credit. A Western, &quot;San Antonio&quot; (1945), was also very popular, grossing $3.553 million in the U.S. and was Warner Bros.&#x27; third-biggest hit of the year.

===Post-war career===
Flynn tried comedy again with &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot; (1946), a comedy of remarriage opposite Eleanor Parker, but it was not a success, grossing $1.77 million in the U.S. In 1946, Flynn published an adventure novel, &quot;Showdown&quot;, and earned a reported $184,000 (). &quot;Cry Wolf&quot; (1947) was a thriller with Flynn in a seemingly more villainous role. It was a moderate success at the box office. He was in a melodrama, &quot;Escape Me Never&quot; (1947), filmed in early 1946 but not released until late 1947, which lost money. More popular was a Western with Walsh and Ann Sheridan, &quot;Silver River&quot; (1948). This was a hit, although its high cost meant it was not very profitable. Flynn drank so heavily on the set that he was effectively disabled after noon-hour, and a disgusted Walsh terminated their business relationship. Warners tried returning Flynn to swashbucklers and the result was &quot;Adventures of Don Juan&quot; (1948). The film was very successful, becoming Warner Bros.&#x27; 4th-biggest hit of the year. As with some other Flynn films, it was more popular in Europe than the States, grossing $3.1 million there and $2.1 million in the U.S., with total earnings of $4.7 million on an approximate budget of $3.25 million. However, from this point on, Warner Bros. reduced the budgets of Flynn&#x27;s films. In November 1947, Flynn signed a 15-year contract with Warner Bros. for $225,000 per film. His income totalled $214,000 that year, and $200,000 in 1948.

===Later Warner films===

After a cameo in Warner Bros.&#x27; Technicolor musical comedy &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Feeling&quot; (1949), Flynn was borrowed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to appear in &quot;That Forsyte Woman&quot; (1949), which made $1.855 million in the U.S. and $1.842 million abroad which was the eleventh-biggest hit of the year for MGM. He went on a three-month holiday then made two medium-budget Westerns for Warners, &quot;Montana&quot; (1950), which made $2.1 million and was Warner Bros.&#x27; fifth-biggest movie of the year, and &quot;Rocky Mountain&quot; (1950), which made $1.7 million in the U.S. and was Warner Bros.&#x27; ninth-biggest movie of the year. He returned to MGM for &quot;Kim&quot; (1950), one of Flynn&#x27;s most popular and profitable movies from this period, grossing $5.348 million ($2.896 million in the U.S. plus $2.452 million abroad, on a budget of $2.056 million) while making it MGM&#x27;s fifth-biggest movie of the year by box office and eleventh biggest overall for Hollywood. It was shot partly in India. On his way home, he shot some scenes for a film he produced, &quot;Hello God&quot; (1951), directed by William Marshall; it was never released. For many years, this was considered a lost film, but in 2013, a copy was discovered in the basement of the surrogate court of New York City. Two of seven cans of the movie had deteriorated beyond hope, but five survived and were sent to the George Eastman House film archive for restoration.

Flynn wrote and co-produced his next film, the low-budget &quot;Adventures of Captain Fabian&quot; (1951), directed by Marshall and shot in France. (Flynn wrote articles, novels and scripts but never had the discipline to turn it into a full-time career.) Flynn wound up suing Marshall over both movies. For Warners, he appeared in an adventure tale set in the Philippines, &quot;Mara Maru&quot; (1952). That studio released a documentary of a 1946 voyage he had taken on his yacht, &quot;Cruise of the Zaca&quot; (1952). In August 1951, he signed a one-picture deal to make a movie for Universal in exchange for a percentage of the profits: this was &quot;Against All Flags&quot; (1952), a popular swashbuckler. In 1952, he was seriously ill with hepatitis, resulting in liver damage. In England, he made another swashbuckler for Warners, &quot;The Master of Ballantrae&quot; (1953). After that, Warners ended their contract with him and their association that had lasted for 18 years and 35 films.

===Europe===
Flynn relocated his career to Europe, starting with a swashbuckler in Italy, &quot;Crossed Swords&quot; (1954). This inspired him to produce a similar movie in that country, &quot;The Story of William Tell&quot; (1953), directed by Jack Cardiff with himself in the title role. The movie fell apart during production, was never finished, and ruined Flynn financially. Desperate for money, he accepted an offer from Herbert Wilcox to support Anna Neagle in a British musical, &quot;Lilacs in the Spring&quot; (1954). Also shot in Britain was &quot;The Dark Avenger&quot; (1955), for Allied Artists, in which Flynn played Edward, the Black Prince. Wilcox used him with Neagle again in &quot;King&#x27;s Rhapsody&quot; (1955), but it was not a success, ending plans for further Wilcox-Flynn collaborations. In 1956 he presented and sometimes performed in the British-filmed television anthology series &quot;The Errol Flynn Theatre&quot;.

===Return to Hollywood===
Flynn received an offer to make his first Hollywood film in five years: &quot;Istanbul&quot; (1957), for Universal, which was not well received. He made a thriller shot in Cuba, &quot;The Big Boodle&quot; (1957), then had his best role in a long time in the blockbuster Ernest Hemingway adaptation &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; (1957) for producer Darryl F. Zanuck, which made $3 million in the U.S. Flynn&#x27;s performance in the latter was well received and led to a series of roles where he played to type, assaying drunks. Warner Bros. cast him as John Barrymore in &quot;Too Much, Too Soon&quot; (1958), and Zanuck used him again in &quot;The Roots of Heaven&quot; which made $3 million (1958). He met with Stanley Kubrick to discuss a role in &quot;Lolita&quot;, but nothing came of it.

Flynn went to Cuba in late 1958 to film the self-produced B film &quot;Cuban Rebel Girls&quot;, where he met Fidel Castro and was an enthusiastic supporter of the Cuban Revolution. He wrote a series of newspaper and magazine articles for the &quot;New York Journal American&quot; and other publications documenting his time in Cuba with Castro. Flynn was the only journalist who happened to be with Castro the night Batista fled the country, and Castro learned of his victory in the revolution. Many of these pieces were lost until 2009 when they were rediscovered in a collection at the University of Texas at Austin&#x27;s Dolph Briscoe Center for American History. He appeared in a short titled &quot;Cuban Story: The Truth About Fidel Castro Revolution&quot; (1959), his last-known work.

==Personal life==

===Lifestyle===
Flynn developed a reputation for his womanising, hard drinking, chain smoking and, for a time in the 1940s, narcotics abuse. He was addicted to alcohol, tobacco, drugs and sex. He was linked romantically with Lupe Vélez, Marlene Dietrich and Dolores del Río, among many others. Carole Lombard is said to have resisted his advances but invited him to her extravagant parties. He was a regular attendee of William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s equally lavish affairs at Hearst Castle, though he was once asked to leave after becoming excessively intoxicated.

The expression &quot;in like Flynn&quot; is said to have been coined to refer to the supreme ease with which he reputedly seduced women, but its origin is disputed. Flynn was reportedly fond of the expression and later claimed that he wanted to call his memoir &quot;In Like Me&quot;. The publisher insisted on a more lurid title, &quot;My Wicked, Wicked Ways&quot;.

Flynn had various mirrors and hiding places constructed inside his mansion, including an overhead trapdoor above a guest bedroom for surreptitious viewing. Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood toured the house as a prospective buyer in the 1970s and reported, &quot;Errol had two-way mirrors... speaker systems in the ladies&#x27; room. Not for security. Just that he was an A-1 voyeur.&quot; In March 1955, the popular Hollywood gossip magazine &quot;Confidential&quot; ran a salacious article titled &quot;The Greatest Show in Town... Errol Flynn and His Two-Way Mirror!&quot; In her 1966 biography, actress Hedy Lamarr wrote, &quot;Many of the bathrooms have peepholes or ceilings with squares of opaque glass through which you can&#x27;t see out but someone can see in.&quot;

He had a Schnauzer dog named Arno, which was specially trained to protect him. They went together to premieres, parties, restaurants and clubs until the dog&#x27;s death in 1941. On 15 June 1938, during filming, Arno bit Bette Davis on the ankle in a scene where she struck Flynn.

===Marriages and family===

Flynn was married three times: to actress Lili Damita from 1935 until 1942 (one son, Sean Flynn, born 1941); to Nora Eddington from 1943 to 1949 (two daughters, Deirdre, born 1945, and Rory, born 1947); and to actress Patrice Wymore from 1950 until his death in 1959 (one daughter, Arnella Roma, born 1953). He is the maternal grandfather to actor Sean Flynn, through his daughter Rory, who starred in the TV series &quot;Zoey 101&quot;. Flynn&#x27;s first two marriages ended unhappily, and two of his children had tragic lives. Sean Flynn disappeared in Cambodia in 1970 and was declared dead. Arnella Roma Flynn died at the age of forty-four after a life of drug addiction and abuse.

While Flynn acknowledged his personal attraction to Olivia de Havilland, assertions by film historians that they were romantically involved during the filming of &quot;Robin Hood&quot; were denied by de Havilland. &quot;Yes, we did fall in love, and I believe that this is evident in the screen chemistry between us&quot;, she told an interviewer in 2009. &quot;But his circumstances [Flynn&#x27;s marriage to Damita] at the time prevented the relationship going further. I have not talked about it a great deal but the relationship was not consummated. Chemistry was there, though. It was there.&quot;

After quitting Hollywood, Flynn lived with Wymore in Port Antonio, Jamaica in the early 1950s. He was largely responsible for developing tourism in this area and, for a while, owned a hotel there. He popularised trips down rivers on bamboo rafts.

His only son, Sean (born 31 May 1941), was an actor and war correspondent who disappeared in Cambodia in April 1970 during the Vietnam War. Sean and a colleague, Dana Stone, were working as freelance photojournalists for &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Neither man&#x27;s body has ever been found; it is generally assumed that they were killed by Khmer Rouge guerrillas in 1970 or 1971. After a decade-long search financed by his mother, Sean was officially declared dead in 1984. Sean&#x27;s life is recounted in the book &quot;Inherited Risk: Errol and Sean Flynn in Hollywood and Vietnam&quot;.

==Death==
By 1959, Flynn&#x27;s financial difficulties had become so serious that he flew on 9 October to Vancouver, British Columbia, to negotiate the lease of his yacht &quot;Zaca&quot; to the businessman George Caldough. As Caldough was driving Flynn and the 17-year-old actress Beverly Aadland, who had accompanied him on the trip, to the airport on 14 October for a Los Angeles-bound flight, Flynn began complaining of severe pain in his back and legs. Caldough transported him to the residence of a doctor, Grant Gould, who noted that Flynn had considerable difficulty navigating the building&#x27;s stairway. Gould, assuming that the pain was due to degenerative disc disease and spinal osteoarthritis, administered 50 milligrams of Demerol (pethidine) intravenously. As Flynn&#x27;s discomfort diminished, he &quot;reminisced at great length about his past experiences&quot; to those present. He refused a drink when offered it.

Gould then performed a leg massage in the apartment&#x27;s bedroom and advised Flynn to rest there before resuming his journey. Flynn responded that he felt &quot;ever so much better.&quot; After 20 minutes Aadland checked on Flynn and discovered him unresponsive. Despite immediate emergency medical treatment from Gould and a swift transfer by ambulance to Vancouver General Hospital, he did not regain consciousness and was pronounced dead that evening. The coroner&#x27;s report and the death certificate noted the cause of death as myocardial infarction due to coronary thrombosis and coronary atherosclerosis, with fatty degeneration of liver and partial cirrhosis of the liver significant enough to be listed as contributing factors. Flynn was outlived by both his parents.

Flynn was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California, a place he once remarked that he hated, with six bottles of his favourite whisky.

==Honors==
In recognition for his contributions to the motion pictures and television industry, Flynn was awarded two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. The star for motion pictures is located at 6654 Hollywood Boulevard and the star awarded for television is located at 7008 Hollywood Boulevard, Hollywood, California.

There is a street named after Flynn in San Antonio, Texas.

==Posthumous controversies==
In a 1982 interview with &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine, Ronald DeWolf, son of the author L. Ron Hubbard said that his father&#x27;s friendship with Flynn was so strong that Hubbard&#x27;s family considered Flynn an adoptive father to DeWolf. He said that Flynn and his father engaged in illegal activities together, including drug smuggling and sexual acts with underage girls, but that Flynn never joined Scientology, Hubbard&#x27;s movement.

Journalist George Seldes, who disliked Flynn intensely, wrote in his 1987 memoir that Flynn did not travel to Spain in 1937 to report on its civil war as announced or to deliver cash, medicine, supplies and food for the Republican soldiers, as promised. His purpose, according to Seldes, was to perpetrate a hoax that he triggered by sending an &quot;apparently harmless&quot; telegram from Madrid to Paris. The following day, American newspapers published an erroneous report that Flynn had been killed at the Spanish front. &quot;The next day he left Spain ... . There were no ambulances, no medical supplies, no food for the Spanish Republic, and not one cent of money. The war correspondents said bitterly that it was the cruellest hoax of the time,&quot; Seldes wrote. &quot;Flynn... had used a terrible war just to advertise one of his cheap movies.&quot;

===Relationship with Beverly Aadland===
In 1961, Beverly Aadland&#x27;s mother, Florence, co-wrote &quot;The Big Love&quot; with Tedd Thomey, alleging that Flynn had been involved in a sexual relationship with her daughter, who was 15 when it began. The memoir was adapted in 1991 by Jay Presson Allen and her daughter Brooke Allen into a one-woman play, &quot;The Big Love&quot;, which starred Tracey Ullman as Florence Aadland in its New York premiere.

In 1996, Beverly Aadland gave an interview to Britain&#x27;s Channel 4 documentary series &quot;Secret Lives&quot; corroborating the sexual relationship and claiming that the first time she and Flynn had sex, he had &quot;forced himself&quot; on her. She also said she loved him and wished they had more time together. &quot;I was very lucky. He could have had any woman he wanted. Why it was me, I have no idea. Never will.&quot;

===Charles Higham biography===
In 1980, author Charles Higham wrote a highly controversial biography, &quot;Errol Flynn: The Untold Story&quot;, alleging that Flynn was a fascist sympathiser who spied for the Nazis before and during the Second World War and that he was bisexual and had multiple same-sex affairs. He claimed Flynn had arranged to have &quot;Dive Bomber&quot; filmed on location at the San Diego Naval Base for the benefit of Japanese military planners, who needed information on American warships and defence installations. Higham admitted that he had no evidence that Flynn was a German agent, but said he had &quot;pieced together a mosaic that proves that he is&quot;. Flynn&#x27;s friend David Niven criticised Higham for his unfounded accusations. In his autobiography, &quot;Iron Eyes Cody: My Life As A Hollywood Indian&quot;, Iron Eyes Cody also trashed Higham&#x27;s book and described Flynn as &quot;super straight&quot;.

Subsequent Flynn biographers are critical of Higham&#x27;s allegations, and have found no evidence to corroborate them. Lincoln Hurst reported that Flynn attempted to join the OSS in 1942 and was put under surveillance by the FBI, which uncovered no subversive activities. Tony Thomas and Buster Wiles accused Higham of altering FBI documents to substantiate his claims. In 1981, Flynn&#x27;s daughters, Rory and Deirdre, hired Melvin Belli to sue Higham and his publisher Doubleday for libel. The suit was dismissed on the grounds that a deceased person cannot, by definition, be libelled. In 2000, Higham repeated his claim that Flynn had been a German agent, citing corroboration from Anne Lane, secretary to MI5 chief Sir Percy Sillitoe from 1946 to 1951 and the person responsible for maintaining Flynn&#x27;s British intelligence service file. Higham acknowledged that he never saw the file itself and was unable to secure official confirmation of its existence.

<doc id="67031" wikidata="Q856418" url="?curid=67031" title="Sarbanes–Oxley Act">
<text>The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 is a United States federal law that mandates certain practices in financial record keeping and reporting for corporations. The act, , also known as the &quot;Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act&quot; (in the Senate) and &quot;Corporate and Auditing Accountability, Responsibility, and Transparency Act&quot; (in the House) and more commonly called Sarbanes–Oxley, SOX or Sarbox, contains eleven sections that place requirements on all U.S. public company boards of directors and management and public accounting firms. A number of provisions of the Act also apply to privately held companies, such as the willful destruction of evidence to impede a federal investigation.

The law was enacted as a reaction to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals, including Enron and WorldCom. The sections of the bill cover responsibilities of a public corporation&#x27;s board of directors, add criminal penalties for certain misconduct, and require the Securities and Exchange Commission to create regulations to define how public corporations are to comply with the law.

==Background==
In 2002, Sarbanes–Oxley was named after bill sponsors U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-MD) and U.S. Representative Michael G. Oxley (R-OH). To be &quot;SOX compliant,&quot; top management must individually certify the accuracy of financial information. In addition, penalties for fraudulent financial activity are much more severe. The act increased the oversight role of boards of directors and the independence of the outside auditors who review the accuracy of corporate financial statements.

The bill was enacted as a reaction to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals, including those affecting Enron, Tyco International, Adelphia, Peregrine Systems, and WorldCom. These scandals cost investors billions of dollars when the share prices of affected companies collapsed, and shook public confidence in the US securities markets.

The act contains eleven titles, or sections, ranging from additional corporate board responsibilities to criminal penalties, and requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to implement rulings on requirements to comply with the law. Harvey Pitt, the 26th chairman of the SEC, led the SEC in the adoption of dozens of rules to implement the Sarbanes–Oxley Act. It created a new, quasi-public agency, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), charged with overseeing, regulating, inspecting, and disciplining accounting firms in their roles as auditors of public companies. The act also covers issues such as auditor independence, corporate governance, internal control assessment, and enhanced financial disclosure. The nonprofit arm of Financial Executives International, Financial Executives Research Foundation, completed extensive research studies to help support the foundations of the act.

The act was approved in the House by a vote of 423 in favor, 3 opposed, and 8 abstaining and in the Senate with a vote of 99 in favor and 1 abstaining. President George W. Bush signed it into law, stating it included &quot;the most far-reaching reforms of American business practices since the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The era of low standards and false profits is over; no boardroom in America is above or beyond the law.&quot;
In response to the perception that stricter financial governance laws are needed, SOX-type regulations were subsequently enacted in Canada (2002), Germany (2002), South Africa (2002), France (2003), Australia (2004), India (2005), Japan (2006), Italy (2006), Israel, and Turkey. (See Similar laws in other countries below.)

Debates continued as of 2007 over the perceived benefits and costs of SOX. Opponents of the bill have claimed it has reduced America&#x27;s international competitive edge because it has introduced an overly complex regulatory environment into US financial markets. A study commissioned by then New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and New York Senator Chuck Schumer cited this as one reason America&#x27;s financial sector is losing market share to other financial centers worldwide. Proponents of the measure said that SOX has been a &quot;godsend&quot; for improving the confidence of fund managers and other investors with regard to the veracity of corporate financial statements.

The 10th anniversary of SOX coincided with the passing of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, designed to give emerging companies an economic boost, and cutting back on a number of regulatory requirements.

==Major elements==
# Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
#:Title I consists of nine sections and establishes the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, to provide independent oversight of public accounting firms providing audit services (&quot;auditors&quot;). It also creates a small central oversight board tasked with registering auditors, defining the specific processes and procedures for compliance audits, inspecting and policing conduct and quality control, and enforcing compliance with the specific mandates of SOX.
# Auditor Independence
#:Title II consists of nine sections and establishes standards for external auditor independence, to limit conflicts of interest. It also addresses new auditor approval requirements, audit partner rotation, and auditor reporting requirements. It restricts auditing companies from providing non-audit services (e.g., consulting) for the same clients.
# Corporate Responsibility
#:Title III consists of eight sections and mandates that senior executives take individual responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of corporate financial reports. It defines the interaction of external auditors and corporate audit committees, and specifies the responsibility of corporate officers for the accuracy and validity of corporate financial reports. It enumerates specific limits on the behaviors of corporate officers and describes specific forfeitures of benefits and civil penalties for non-compliance. For example, Section 302 requires that the company&#x27;s &quot;principal officers&quot; (typically the chief executive officer and chief financial officer) certify and approve the integrity of their company financial reports quarterly.
# Enhanced Financial Disclosures
#:Title IV consists of nine sections. It describes enhanced reporting requirements for financial transactions, including off-balance-sheet transactions, pro-forma figures and stock transactions of corporate officers. It requires internal controls for assuring the accuracy of financial reports and disclosures, and mandates both audits and reports on those controls. It also requires timely reporting of material changes in financial condition and specific enhanced reviews by the SEC or its agents of corporate reports.
# Analyst Conflicts of Interest
#:Title V consists of only one section, which includes measures designed to help restore investor confidence in the reporting of securities analysts. It defines the codes of conduct for securities analysts and requires disclosure of knowable conflicts of interest.
# Commission Resources and Authority
#:Title VI consists of four sections and defines practices to restore investor confidence in securities analysts. It also defines the SEC&#x27;s authority to censure or bar securities professionals from practice and defines conditions under which a person can be barred from practicing as a broker, advisor, or dealer.
# Studies and Reports
#:Title VII consists of five sections and requires the Comptroller General and the SEC to perform various studies and report their findings. Studies and reports include the effects of consolidation of public accounting firms, the role of credit rating agencies in the operation of securities markets, securities violations, and enforcement actions, and whether investment banks assisted Enron, Global Crossing, and others to manipulate earnings and obfuscate true financial conditions.
# Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability
#:Title VIII consists of seven sections and is also referred to as the &quot;Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002&quot;. It describes specific criminal penalties for manipulation, destruction or alteration of financial records or other interference with investigations, while providing certain protections for whistle-blowers.
# White Collar Crime Penalty Enhancement
#:Title IX consists of six sections. This section is also called the &quot;White Collar Crime Penalty Enhancement Act of 2002&quot;. This section increases the criminal penalties associated with white-collar crimes and conspiracies. It recommends stronger sentencing guidelines and specifically adds failure to certify corporate financial reports as a criminal offense.
# Corporate Tax Returns
#:Title X consists of one section. Section 1001 states that the chief executive officer should sign the company tax return.
# Corporate Fraud Accountability
#:Title XI consists of seven sections. Section 1101 recommends a name for this title as &quot;Corporate Fraud Accountability Act of 2002&quot;. It identifies corporate fraud and records tampering as criminal offenses and joins those offenses to specific penalties. It also revises sentencing guidelines and strengthens their penalties. This enables the SEC to resort to temporarily freezing transactions or payments that have been deemed &quot;large&quot; or &quot;unusual&quot;. It also created the crime of obstructing an official proceeding.
# Obstructing an official proceeding
#:Obstructing an official proceeding is a felony under U.S. federal law. It was enacted as part of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 as a reaction to the Enron scandal, and closed a legal loophole on who could be charged with evidence tampering by defining the new crime very broadly. It later became known for its use as a charge against defendants associated with the 2021 U.S. Capitol attack for attempting to obstruct that year&#x27;s Electoral College vote count, though the Supreme Court limited its application in &quot;Fischer v. United States&quot;.

==History and context==

A variety of complex factors created the conditions and culture in which a series of large corporate frauds occurred between 2000 and 2002. The spectacular, highly publicized frauds at Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco exposed significant problems with conflicts of interest and incentive compensation practices. The analysis of their complex and contentious root causes contributed to the passage of SOX in 2002. In a 2004 interview, Senator Paul Sarbanes stated:

*Auditor conflicts of interest: Prior to SOX, auditing firms, the primary financial &quot;watchdogs&quot; for investors, were self-regulated. They also performed significant non-audit or consulting work for the companies they audited. Many of these consulting agreements were far more lucrative than the auditing engagement. This presented at least the appearance of a conflict of interest. For example, challenging the company&#x27;s accounting approach might damage a client relationship, conceivably placing a significant consulting arrangement at risk, damaging the auditing firm&#x27;s bottom line.
*Boardroom failures: Boards of Directors, specifically Audit Committees, are charged with establishing oversight mechanisms for financial reporting in U.S. corporations on the behalf of investors. These scandals identified Board members who either did not exercise their responsibilities or did not have the expertise to understand the complexities of the businesses. In many cases, Audit Committee members were not truly independent of management.
*Securities analysts&#x27; conflicts of interest: The roles of securities analysts, who make buy and sell recommendations on company stocks and bonds, and investment bankers, who help provide companies loans or handle mergers and acquisitions, provide opportunities for conflicts. Similar to the auditor conflict, issuing a buy or sell recommendation on a stock while providing lucrative investment banking services creates at least the appearance of a conflict of interest.
*Inadequate funding of the SEC: The SEC budget has steadily increased to nearly double the pre-SOX level. In the interview cited above, Sarbanes indicated that enforcement and rule-making are more effective post-SOX.
*Banking practices: Lending to a firm sends signals to investors regarding the firm&#x27;s risk. In the case of Enron, several major banks provided large loans to the company without understanding, or while ignoring, the risks of the company. Investors of these banks and their clients were hurt by such bad loans, resulting in large settlement payments by the banks. Others interpreted the willingness of banks to lend money to the company as an indication of its health and integrity, and were led to invest in Enron as a result. These investors were hurt as well.
*Internet bubble: Investors had been stung in 2000 by the sharp declines in technology stocks and to a lesser extent, by declines in the overall market. Certain mutual fund managers were alleged to have advocated the purchasing of particular technology stocks, while quietly selling them. The losses sustained also helped create a general anger among investors.
*Executive compensation: Stock option and bonus practices, combined with volatility in stock prices for even small earnings &quot;misses,&quot; resulted in pressures to manage earnings. Stock options were not treated as compensation expense by companies, encouraging this form of compensation. With a large stock-based bonus at risk, managers were pressured to meet their targets.

===Timeline and passage===
The House passed Rep. Oxley&#x27;s bill (H.R. 3763) on April 24, 2002, by a vote of 334 to 90. The House then referred the &quot;Corporate and Auditing Accountability, Responsibility, and Transparency Act&quot; or &quot;CAARTA&quot; to the Senate Banking Committee with the support of President George W. Bush and the SEC. At the time, however, the Chairman of that Committee, Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), was preparing his own proposal, Senate Bill 2673.

Senator Sarbanes&#x27;s bill passed the Senate Banking Committee on June 18, 2002, by a vote of 17 to 4. On June 25, 2002, WorldCom revealed it had overstated its earnings by more than $3.8 billion during the past five quarters (15 months), primarily by improperly accounting for its operating costs. Senator Sarbanes introduced Senate Bill 2673 to the full Senate that same day, and it passed 97–0 less than three weeks later on July 15, 2002.

The House and the Senate formed a Conference Committee to reconcile the differences between Sen. Sarbanes&#x27;s bill (S. 2673) and Rep. Oxley&#x27;s bill (H.R. 3763). The conference committee relied heavily on S. 2673 and &quot;most changes made by the conference committee strengthened the prescriptions of S. 2673 or added new prescriptions.&quot;

The Committee approved the final conference bill on July 24, 2002, and gave it the name &quot;the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002&quot;. The next day, both houses of Congress voted on it without change, producing an overwhelming margin of victory: 423 to 3 in the House; and 99 to 0 in the Senate.

On July 30, 2002, President George W. Bush signed it into law, stating it included &quot;the most far-reaching reforms of American business practices since the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot;.

==Analyzing the cost-benefits of Sarbanes–Oxley==

A significant body of academic research and opinion exists regarding the costs and benefits of SOX compliance, with significant differences in conclusions. This is due in part to the difficulty of isolating the impact of SOX from other variables affecting the stock market and corporate earnings. Section 404 of the act, which requires management and the external auditor to report on the adequacy of a company&#x27;s internal control on financial reporting, is often singled out for analysis.

According to a 2019 study in &quot;the Journal of Law and Economics&quot;, &quot;We find a large decline in the average voting premium of US dual-class firms targeted by major SOX provisions that enhance boards&#x27; independence, improve internal controls, and increase litigation risks. The targeted firms also improve the efficiency of investment, cash management, and chief executive officers&#x27; compensation relative to firms not targeted by SOX. Overall, the evidence suggests that SOX is effective in curbing the private benefits of control.&quot;

===Compliance costs===
* FEI Survey (Annual): Financial Executives International (FEI) provides an annual survey on SOX Section 404 costs. These costs have continued to decline relative to revenues since 2004. The 2007 study indicated that, for 168 companies with average revenues of $4.7 billion, the average compliance costs were $1.7 million (0.036% of revenue). The 2006 study indicated that, for 200 companies with average revenues of $6.8 billion, the average compliance costs were $2.9 million (0.043% of revenue), down 23% from 2005. Cost for decentralized companies (i.e., those with multiple segments or divisions) were considerably more than centralized companies. Survey scores related to the positive effect of SOX on investor confidence, reliability of financial statements, and fraud prevention continue to rise. However, when asked in 2006 whether the benefits of compliance with Section 404 have exceeded costs in 2006, only 22 percent agreed.
* Foley &amp; Lardner Survey (2007): This annual study focused on changes in the total costs of being a U.S. public company, which were significantly affected by SOX. Such costs include external auditor fees, directors and officers (D&amp;O) insurance, board compensation, lost productivity, and legal costs. Each of these cost categories increased significantly between FY2001 and FY2006. Nearly 70% of survey respondents indicated public companies with revenues under $251 million should be exempt from SOX Section 404.
* Butler/Ribstein (2006): Their book proposed a comprehensive overhaul or repeal of SOX and a variety of other reforms. For example, they indicate that investors could diversify their stock investments, efficiently managing the risk of a few catastrophic corporate failures, whether due to fraud or competition. However, if each company is required to spend a significant amount of money and resources on SOX compliance, this cost is borne across all publicly traded companies and therefore cannot be diversified away by the investor.
* A 2011 SEC study found that Section 404(b) compliance costs have continued to decline, especially after 2007 accounting guidance.
* Lord &amp; Benoit report (2008): A research report entitled &quot;The Lord &amp; Benoit Report: The Sarbanes–Oxley Investment&quot; found the average cost of complying with Section 404(a) for non-accelerated filers (smaller public companies) was $53,724. Total costs of complying with Section 404(a) ranged from as low as $15,000 for a smaller software company to as high as $162,000. The initial prediction by the SEC was an average cost of $91,000 for public companies complying with Section 404(a). &quot;Accounting problems have traditionally been a small company phenomenon, and the stock exchange is talking about exempting those most prone to abuse,&quot; said Barbara Roper, the Consumer Federation of America&#x27;s director of investor protection. &quot;It&#x27;s a bad idea.&quot; She noted a January study by consulting firm Lord &amp; Benoit that found complying with Sarbanes–Oxley would cost small companies an average of $78,000 the first year, or less than the $91,000 initially predicted by the SEC.

===Benefits to firms and investors===
* Arping/Sautner (2010): This research paper analyzes whether SOX enhanced corporate transparency. Looking at foreign firms that are cross-listed in the US, the paper indicates that, relative to a control sample of comparable firms that are not subject to SOX, cross-listed firms became significantly more transparent following SOX. Corporate transparency is measured based on the dispersion and accuracy of analyst earnings forecasts.
* Iliev (2007): This research paper indicated that SOX 404 indeed led to conservative reported earnings but also reduced—rightly or wrongly—stock valuations of small firms. Lower earnings often cause the share price to decrease.
* Rice and Weber (2011) shows that only a minority of SOX 404 reports provide any advance warning of the possibility of impending accounting problems. Reporting incentives of the firms, like the need for raising additional external capital, larger firm size and decreased external auditor objectivity, might prohibit firms reporting the weakness of internal control in advance. Therefore, SOX 404 alone might not achieve its intended results.
* Skaife/Collins/Kinney/LaFond (2006): This research paper indicates that borrowing costs are much lower for companies that improved their internal control, by between 50 and 150 basis points (.5 to 1.5 percentage points).
* Lord &amp; Benoit Report (2006): Do the Benefits of 404 Exceed the Cost? A study of a population of nearly 2,500 companies indicated that those with no material weaknesses in their internal controls, or companies that corrected them in a timely manner, experienced much greater increases in share prices than companies that did not. The report indicated that the benefits to a compliant company in share price (10% above Russell 3000 index) were greater than their SOX Section 404 costs.
* Institute of Internal Auditors (2005): The research paper indicates that corporations have improved their internal controls and that financial statements are perceived to be more reliable.
* Donelson, Ege and McInnis (2017): This research paper indicates that firms with reported material weaknesses have significantly higher fraud.

===Effects on exchange listing choice of non-US companies===
Some have asserted that Sarbanes–Oxley legislation has helped displace business from New York to London, where the Financial Conduct Authority regulates the financial sector with a lighter touch. In the UK, the non-statutory Combined Code of Corporate Governance plays a somewhat similar role to SOX. See Howell E. Jackson &amp; Mark J. Roe, &quot;Public Enforcement of Securities Laws: Preliminary Evidence&quot; (Working Paper January 16, 2007). London based Alternative Investment Market claims that its spectacular growth in listings almost entirely coincided with the Sarbanes–Oxley legislation. In December 2006, Michael Bloomberg, New York&#x27;s mayor, and Chuck Schumer, U.S. senator from New York, expressed their concern.

The Sarbanes–Oxley Act&#x27;s effect on non-U.S. companies cross-listed in the U.S. is different on firms from developed and well regulated countries than on firms from less developed countries according to Kate Litvak. Companies from badly regulated countries see benefits that are higher than the costs from better credit ratings by complying to regulations in a highly regulated country (USA), but companies from developed countries only incur the costs, since transparency is adequate in their home countries as well. On the other hand, the benefit of better credit rating also comes with listing on other stock exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange.

Piotroski and Srinivasan (2008) examine a comprehensive sample of international companies that list onto U.S. and U.K. stock exchanges before and after the enactment of the Act in 2002. Using a sample of all listing events onto U.S. and U.K. exchanges from 1995 to 2006, they find that the listing preferences of large foreign firms choosing between U.S. exchanges and the LSE&#x27;s Main Market did not change following SOX. In contrast, they find that the likelihood of a U.S. listing among small foreign firms choosing between the Nasdaq and LSE&#x27;s Alternative Investment Market decreased following SOX. The negative effect among small firms is consistent with these companies being less able to absorb the incremental costs associated with SOX compliance. The screening of smaller firms with weaker governance attributes from U.S. exchanges is consistent with the heightened governance costs imposed by the Act increasing the bonding-related benefits of a U.S. listing.

==Implementation of key provisions==

===Sarbanes–Oxley Section 302: Disclosure controls===
Under Sarbanes–Oxley, two separate sections came into effect—one civil and the other criminal. (Section 302) (civil provision); (Section 906) (criminal provision).

Section 302 of the Act mandates a set of internal procedures designed to ensure accurate financial disclosure. The signing officers must certify that they are &quot;responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls&quot; and &quot;have designed such internal controls to ensure that material information relating to the company and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to such officers by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which the periodic reports are being prepared&quot;. . The officers must &quot;have evaluated the effectiveness of the company&#x27;s internal controls as of a date within 90 days prior to the report&quot; and &quot;have presented in the report their conclusions about the effectiveness of their internal controls based on their evaluation as of that date&quot;. &quot;Id.&quot;.

The SEC interpreted the intention of Sec. 302 in Final Rule 33–8124. In it, the SEC defines the new term &quot;disclosure controls and procedures,&quot; which are distinct from &quot;internal controls over financial reporting&quot;. Under both Section 302 and Section 404, Congress directed the SEC to promulgate regulations enforcing these provisions.

External auditors are required to issue an opinion on whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects by management. This is in addition to the financial statement opinion regarding the accuracy of the financial statements. The requirement to issue a third opinion regarding management&#x27;s assessment was removed in 2007.

A &quot;Lord &amp; Benoit&quot; report, titled &quot;Bridging the Sarbanes–Oxley Disclosure Control Gap&quot;, was filed with the SEC Subcommittee on internal controls which reported that those companies with ineffective internal controls, the expected rate of full and accurate disclosure under Section 302 will range between 8 and 15 percent. A full 9 out of every 10 companies with ineffective Section 404 controls self reported effective Section 302 controls in the same period end that an adverse Section 404 was reported, 90% in accurate without a Section 404 audit.

===Sarbanes–Oxley Section 303: Improper influence on the conduct of audits===

a. Rules To Prohibit. It shall be unlawful, in contravention of such rules or regulations as the Commission shall prescribe as necessary and appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, for any officer or director of an issuer, or any other person acting under the direction thereof, to take any action to fraudulently influence, coerce, manipulate, or mislead any independent public or certified accountant engaged in the performance of an audit of the financial statements of that issuer for the purpose of rendering such financial statements materially misleading.

b. Enforcement. In any civil proceeding, the Commission shall have exclusive authority to enforce this section and any rule or regulation issued under this section.

c. No Preemption of Other Law. The provisions of subsection (a) shall be in addition to, and shall not supersede or preempt, any other provision of law or any rule or regulation issued thereunder.

d. Deadline for Rulemaking. The Commission shall—1. propose the rules or regulations required by this section, not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act; and
2. issue final rules or regulations required by this section, not later than 270 days after that date of enactment.

===Sarbanes–Oxley Section 401: Disclosures in periodic reports (Off-balance sheet items)===
The bankruptcy of Enron drew attention to off-balance sheet instruments that were used fraudulently. During 2010, the court examiner&#x27;s review of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy also brought these instruments back into focus, as Lehman had used an instrument called &quot;Repo 105&quot; to allegedly move assets and debt off-balance sheet to make its financial position look more favorable to investors. Sarbanes–Oxley required the disclosure of all material off-balance sheet items. It also required an SEC study and report to better understand the extent of usage of such instruments and whether accounting principles adequately addressed these instruments; the SEC report was issued June 15, 2005. Interim guidance was issued in May 2006, which was later finalized. Critics argued the SEC did not take adequate steps to regulate and monitor this activity.

===Sarbanes–Oxley Section 404: Assessment of internal control===

The most contentious aspect of SOX is Section 404, which requires management and the external auditor to report on the adequacy of the company&#x27;s internal control on financial reporting (ICFR). This is the most costly aspect of the legislation for companies to implement, as documenting and testing important financial manual and automated controls requires enormous effort.

Under Section 404 of the Act, management is required to produce an &quot;internal control report&quot; as part of each annual Exchange Act report. &quot;See&quot; . The report must affirm &quot;the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting&quot;. . The report must also &quot;contain an assessment, as of the end of the most recent fiscal year of the Company, of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures of the issuer for financial reporting&quot;. To do this, managers are generally adopting an internal control framework such as that described in COSO.

To help alleviate the high costs of compliance, guidance and practice have continued to evolve. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) approved Auditing Standard No. 5 for public accounting firms on July 25, 2007. This standard superseded Auditing Standard No. 2, the initial guidance provided in 2004. The SEC also released its interpretive guidance on June 27, 2007. It is generally consistent with the PCAOB&#x27;s guidance, but intended to provide guidance for management. Both management and the external auditor are responsible for performing their assessment in the context of a top-down risk assessment, which requires management to base both the scope of its assessment and evidence gathered on risk. This gives management wider discretion in its assessment approach. These two standards together require management to:

* Assess both the design and operating effectiveness of selected internal controls related to significant accounts and relevant assertions, in the context of material misstatement risks;
* Understand the flow of transactions, including IT aspects, in sufficient detail to identify points at which a misstatement could arise;
* Evaluate company-level (entity-level) controls, which correspond to the components of the COSO framework;
* Perform a fraud risk assessment;
* Evaluate controls designed to prevent or detect fraud, including management override of controls;
* Evaluate controls over the period-end financial reporting process;
* Scale the assessment based on the size and complexity of the company;
* Rely on management&#x27;s work based on factors such as competency, objectivity, and risk;
* Conclude on the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting.

SOX 404 compliance costs represent a tax on inefficiency, encouraging companies to centralize and automate their financial reporting systems. This is apparent in the comparative costs of companies with decentralized operations and systems, versus those with centralized, more efficient systems. For example, the 2007 Financial Executives International (FEI) survey indicated average compliance costs for decentralized companies were $1.9 million, while centralized company costs were $1.3 million. Costs of evaluating manual control procedures are dramatically reduced through automation.

==== Corporate Implementation of Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) Compliance ====
The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) Report, as the framework became known, was the first-ever attempt in corporate America to establish a universal definition of Internal Controls, along with proposed guidelines for governance, independence and quality assurance. The initial implementation of a SOX compliance project is complex and burdensome on public companies planning to list or maintaining its listing. Full compliance requires an integrated enterprise-wide initiative. The success of the compliance project requires a triangulation of the resources of three executives, the CEO, CFO, and CIO and is usually facilitated by the project management office (PMO). The success of the compliance project depends on the proper “mapping” of information systems controls CoBIT (Control Objectives of Information and Its related Technology) to existing and new financial and operational controls as defined by the COSO Report. 

====Sarbanes–Oxley 404 and smaller public companies====
The cost of complying with SOX 404 impacts smaller companies disproportionately, as there is a significant fixed cost involved in completing the assessment. For example, during 2004 U.S. companies with revenues exceeding $5 billion spent 0.06% of revenue on SOX compliance, while companies with less than $100 million in revenue spent 2.55%.

This disparity is a focal point of 2007 SEC and U.S. Senate action. The PCAOB intends to issue further guidance to help companies scale their assessment based on company size and complexity during 2007. The SEC issued their guidance to management in June, 2007.

After the SEC and PCAOB issued their guidance, the SEC required smaller public companies (non-accelerated filers) with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2007 to document a Management Assessment of their Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR). Outside auditors of non-accelerated filers however opine or test internal controls under PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) Auditing Standards for years ending after December 15, 2008. Another extension was granted by the SEC for the outside auditor assessment until years ending after December 15, 2009. The reason for the timing disparity was to address the House Committee on Small Business concern that the cost of complying with Section 404 of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 was still unknown and could therefore be disproportionately high for smaller publicly held companies. On October 2, 2009, the SEC granted another extension for the outside auditor assessment until fiscal years ending after June 15, 2010. The SEC stated in their release that the extension was granted so that the SEC&#x27;s Office of Economic Analysis could complete a study of whether additional guidance provided to company managers and auditors in 2007 was effective in reducing the costs of compliance. They also stated that there will be no further extensions in the future.

On September 15, 2010 the SEC issued final rule 33–9142 the permanently exempts registrants that are neither accelerated nor large accelerated filers as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 from Section 404(b) internal control audit requirement.

===Sarbanes–Oxley Section 802: Criminal penalties for influencing US Agency investigation/proper administration===
Section 802(a) of the SOX, states:

===Sarbanes–Oxley Section 806: Civil action to protect against retaliation in fraud cases===

Section 806 of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, also known as the whistleblower-protection provision, prohibits any &quot;officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent&quot; of a publicly traded company from retaliating against &quot;an employee&quot; for disclosing reasonably perceived potential or actual violations of the six enumerated categories of protected conduct in Section 806 (securities fraud which includes insider trading and market manipulation, shareholder fraud, bank fraud, a violation of any SEC rule or regulation, mail fraud, or wire fraud). Section 806 prohibits a broad range of retaliatory adverse employment actions, including discharging, demoting, suspending, threatening, harassing, or in any other manner discriminating against a whistleblower. Recently a federal court of appeals held that merely &quot;outing&quot; or disclosing the identity of a whistleblower is actionable retaliation.

Remedies under Section 806 include:


==Filing procedure==

A claim under the anti-retaliation provision of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act must be filed initially at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at the U.S. Department of Labor. OSHA will perform an investigation and if they conclude that the employer violated SOX, OSHA can order preliminary reinstatement. OSHA is required to dismiss the complaint if the complaint fails to make a &quot;prima facie&quot; showing that the protected activity was a &quot;contributing factor&quot; in the adverse employment action.

==Significant §806 whistleblower decisions==

In the sixteen-year period from the passage of the Sarbanes Oxley Act in 2002 through December 31, 2018, a total of 1039 cases have been filed with the Department of Labor of which 62 were still pending before the Department of Labor as of January 1, 2019.

===Sarbanes–Oxley Section 906: Criminal Penalties for CEO/CFO financial statement certification===

§ 1350. Section 906 states: Failure of corporate officers to certify financial reports

(a) Certification of Periodic Financial Reports.— Each periodic report containing financial statements filed by an issuer with the Securities Exchange Commission pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m (a) or 78o (d)) shall be accompanied by a written statement by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer (or equivalent thereof) of the issuer.

(b) Content.— The statement required under subsection (a) shall certify that the periodic report containing the financial statements fully complies with the requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of [1] 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o (d)) and that information contained in the periodic report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the issuer.

(c) Criminal Penalties.— Whoever— 
(1) certifies any statement as set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section knowing that the periodic report accompanying the statement does not comport with all the requirements set forth in this section shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both; or

(2) willfully certifies any statement as set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section knowing that the periodic report accompanying the statement does not comport with all the requirements set forth in this section shall be fined not more than $5,000,000, or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.

===Sarbanes–Oxley Section 1107: Criminal penalties for retaliation against whistleblowers===
Section 1107 of the SOX states:

==Clawbacks of executive compensation for misconduct==
One of the highlights of the law was a provision that allowed the SEC to force a company&#x27;s CEO or CFO to disgorge any executive compensation (such as bonus pay or proceeds from stock sales) earned within a year of misconduct that results in an earnings restatement. However, according to Gretchen Morgenson of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, such clawbacks have actually been rare, due in part to the requirement that the misconduct must be either deliberate or reckless. The SEC did not attempt to claw back any executive compensation until 2007, and as of December 2013 had only brought 31 cases, 13 of which were begun after 2010. However, according to Dan Whalen of the accounting research firm Audit Analytics, the threat of clawbacks, and the time-consuming litigation associated with them, has forced companies to tighten their financial reporting standards.

==Criticism==
Congressman Ron Paul and others such as former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee have contended that SOX was an unnecessary and costly government intrusion into corporate management that places U.S. corporations at a competitive disadvantage with foreign firms, driving businesses out of the United States. In an April 14, 2005 speech before the U.S. House of Representatives, Paul stated

A research study published by Joseph Piotroski of Stanford University and Suraj Srinivasan of Harvard Business School titled &quot;Regulation and Bonding: Sarbanes Oxley Act and the Flow of International Listings&quot; in the Journal of Accounting Research in 2008 found that following the act&#x27;s passage, smaller international companies were more likely to list in stock exchanges in the U.K. rather than U.S. stock exchanges.

During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, critics blamed Sarbanes–Oxley for the low number of initial public offerings (IPOs) on American stock exchanges during 2008. In November 2008, Newt Gingrich and co-author David W. Kralik called on Congress to repeal Sarbanes–Oxley.

A 2012 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial stated,One reason the U.S. economy isn&#x27;t creating enough jobs is that it&#x27;s not creating enough employers ... For the third year in a row the world&#x27;s leading exchange for new stock offerings was located not in New York, but in Hong Kong ... Given that the U.S. is still home to the world&#x27;s largest economy, there&#x27;s no reason it shouldn&#x27;t have the most vibrant equity markets—unless regulation is holding back the creation of new public companies. On that score it&#x27;s getting harder for backers of the Sarbanes–Oxley accounting law to explain away each disappointing year since its 2002 enactment as some kind of temporary or unrelated setback.

==Praise==
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan praised the Sarbanes–Oxley Act in 2005: &quot;I am surprised that the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, so rapidly developed and enacted, has functioned as well as it has ... the act importantly reinforced the principle that shareholders own our corporations and that corporate managers should be working on behalf of shareholders to allocate business resources to their optimum use.&quot;

SOX has been praised by a cross-section of financial industry experts, citing improved investor confidence and more accurate, reliable financial statements. The CEO and CFO are now required to unequivocally take ownership for their financial statements under Section 302, which was not the case prior to SOX. Further, auditor conflicts of interest have been addressed, by prohibiting auditors from also having lucrative consulting agreements with the firms they audit under Section 201. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox stated in 2007: &quot;Sarbanes–Oxley helped restore trust in U.S. markets by increasing accountability, speeding up reporting, and making audits more independent.&quot;

The 2007 FEI study and research by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) also indicate SOX has improved investor confidence in financial reporting, a primary objective of the legislation. The IIA study also indicated improvements in board, audit committee, and senior management engagement in financial reporting and improvements in financial controls.

Financial restatements increased significantly in the wake of the SOX legislation, as companies &quot;cleaned up&quot; their books. Glass, Lewis &amp; Co. LLC is a San Francisco-based firm that tracks the volume of do-overs by public companies. Its March 2006 report, &quot;Getting It Wrong the First Time,&quot; shows 1,295 restatements of financial earnings in 2005 for companies listed on U.S. securities markets, almost twice the number for 2004. &quot;That&#x27;s about one restatement for every 12 public companies—up from one for every 23 in 2004,&quot; says the report.

A fraud documented by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in November 2009, validated whistleblower allegations first logged in 2005. may be directly credited to Sarbanes–Oxley. The fraud, which spanned nearly 20 years and involved over $24 million, was committed by Value Line () against its mutual fund shareholders. The fraud was first reported to the SEC in 2004 by the then Value Line Fund () portfolio manager and Chief Quantitative Strategist, Mr. John (Jack) R. Dempsey of Easton, Connecticut, who was required to sign a Code of Business Ethics as part of SOX. Restitution totaling $34 million was placed in a fair fund and returned to the affected Value Line mutual fund investors. The Commission ordered Value Line to pay a total of $43,705,765 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalty, and ordered Buttner, CEO and Henigson, COO to pay civil penalties of $1,000,000 and $250,000, respectively. The Commission further imposed officer and director bars and broker-dealer, investment adviser, and investment company associational bars (&quot;Associational Bars&quot;) against Buttner and Henigson. No criminal charges were filed.

The Sarbanes–Oxley Act has been praised for nurturing an ethical culture as it forces top management to be transparent and employees to be responsible for their acts whilst protecting whistleblowers. Indeed, courts have held that top management may be in violation of its obligation to assess and disclose material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting when it ignores an employee&#x27;s concerns that could impact the company&#x27;s SEC filings.

==Legal challenges==

A lawsuit (&quot;Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board&quot;) was filed in 2006 challenging the constitutionality of the PCAOB. The complaint argues that because the PCAOB has regulatory powers over the accounting industry, its officers should be appointed by the President, rather than the SEC. Further, because the law lacks a &quot;severability clause,&quot; if part of the law is judged unconstitutional, so is the remainder. If the plaintiff prevails, the U.S. Congress may have to devise a different method of officer appointment. Further, the other parts of the law may be open to revision.
The lawsuit was dismissed from a District Court; the decision was upheld by the Court of Appeals on August 22, 2008. Judge Kavanaugh, in his dissent, argued strongly against the constitutionality of the law. On May 18, 2009, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear this case. On December 7, 2009, it heard the oral arguments. On June 28, 2010, the United States Supreme Court unanimously turned away a broad challenge to the law, but ruled 5–4 that a section related to appointments violates the Constitution&#x27;s separation of powers mandate. The act remains &quot;fully operative as a law&quot; pending a process correction.

In its March 4, 2014 &quot;Lawson v. FMR LLC&quot; decision the United States Supreme Court rejected a narrow reading of the SOX whistleblower protection and instead held that the anti-retaliation protection that the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 provided to whistleblowers applies also to employees of a public company&#x27;s private contractors and subcontractors, including the attorneys and accountants who prepare the SEC filings of public companies. Subsequent interpretations of Lawson, however, suggest that the disclosures of a contractor&#x27;s employee are protected only if those disclosures pertain to fraud perpetrated by a publicly traded company, as opposed to wrongdoing by a private contractor.

In its February 25, 2015 &quot;Yates v. United States&quot; decision the Supreme Court of the United States sided with Yates by reversing the previous judgement, with a plurality of the justices reading the Act to cover &quot;only objects one can use to record or preserve information, not all objects in the physical world&quot;. Justice Samuel Alito concurred in the judgment and noted that the statute&#x27;s nouns and verbs only applies to filekeeping and not fish.

Forty percent of the rioters of the January 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol attack were charged with violating the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002. On June 28, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that found obstruction under the law was only intended to apply to more limited circumstances involving forms of evidence tampering and couldn&#x27;t be used for broader prosecutions. The ruling was 6-3, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett dissenting and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson concurring with the majority.

== Sarbanes–Oxley reporting tools ==

Close scrutiny of corporate governance and greater responsibility placed on directors to vouch for the reports submitted to the SEC and other federal agencies, have resulted in the growth of software solutions aimed at reducing the complexity, time and expense involved in creating the reports. This trend accelerated in 2008 with the passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

<text>USS &quot;Barbero&quot; (SS/SSA/SSG-317) was a of the United States Navy, named for a family of fishes commonly called surgeon fish.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Barbero&quot; was laid down by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut on 25 March 1943. She was launched on 12 December 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Katherine R. Keating, and commissioned on 29 April 1944.

==Service history==

===World War II===
&quot;Barbero&quot;″s war operations span the period from 9 August 1944– 2 January 1945, during which she completed two war patrols. She is credited with sinking three Japanese merchant ships totaling 9,126 tons while patrolling in the Java and South China Seas.

&quot;Barbero&quot; embarked on her first war patrol from Pearl Harbor on 9 August 1944. She reached her patrol area, located east of the central Philippines off San Bernardino Strait, on 24 August. Though she had been stationed there to report and to interdict any attempt by the Japanese to use the strait to contest the Allied invasion of the Palau Islands, they tried no such move. Moreover, during the 31 days that she spent in the area, she encountered no large target. The high point of the patrol came when &quot;Barbero&quot; lobbed 25 rounds at a radar station on Batag Island with her  deck gun. Though she obtained no definite results, her failure to detect radar activity the following night prompted her claim to have neutralized the station. The submarine cleared the area on 24 September 1944 and headed for western Australia, concluding a disappointing 56-day patrol at Fremantle on 4 October.

After refit and a brief training period, &quot;Barbero&quot; departed Fremantle on her second war patrol on 26 October. On this patrol, Comdr. Hartman also assumed command of a coordinated attack group (nicknamed a wolfpack) consisting of &quot;Barbero&quot;, , and . The first phase of this two-part patrol lasted from 26 October until 15 November. It was conducted in the Makassar Strait and in the area west of Mindoro. On 2 November, after a lively passage of Lombok Strait during which picket boats and shore batteries fired on her, &quot;Barbero&quot; sank her first ship, a 2,700-ton troop transport. On 8 November, she sent a 7,500-ton tanker to the bottom during a coordinated attack on a small convoy (consisting of submarine chasers and &quot;CH-8&quot; escorting oilers &quot;Shimotsu Maru&quot; and &quot;Nichinan Maru No. 2&quot;) carried out in cooperation with &quot;Redfin&quot;. &quot;Redfin&quot; received credit for sinking the other tanker in the convoy.

Following a three-day stop at Mios Woendi to rearm with torpedoes and perform minor upkeep, &quot;Barbero&quot; embarked on the second portion of the patrol. This longer phase lasted from 18 November 1944 to 2 January 1945 and was conducted in the South China Sea northeast of Borneo. On 24 December in an attack on an escorted four-ship convoy, a 7,500-ton gasoline tanker was sunk and a second tanker grossing about 5,000 tons was damaged. On Christmas Day, the submarine sank a 4,000-ton Japanese cargo ship. On 27 December, while she attempted the perilous repassage of Lombok Strait, fragments from an aerial bomb that narrowly missed &quot;Barbero&quot; close aboard aft damaged her port reduction gear. The damage forced her to cover the distance remaining to Fremantle on a single screw, and put her out of action for the remainder of the war. In 68 days away from Fremantle, Barbero returned having sunk four ships totalling 21,700 tons and claiming damage to a fifth of 5,000 tons.

===Post-war cargo and Regulus missile conversions===
In September 1945, she was ordered to Mare Island Naval Shipyard – where she underwent pre-inactivation overhaul – and was placed in commission in reserve on 25 April 1946.

Following conversion to a cargo submarine at Mare Island, &quot;Barbero&quot; was recommissioned, redesignated SSA-317, and assigned to the Pacific Fleet on 31 March 1948. From October 1948 – March 1950, she took part in an experimental program to evaluate her capabilities as a cargo carrier. Experimentation ended in early 1950, and she was decommissioned into the reserve on 30 June 1950.

On 1 February 1955, &quot;Barbero&quot; entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard for her a conversion under project SCB 118, equipping her to launch the Regulus I nuclear cruise missile. She was thus redesignated SSG-317 and recommissioned on 28 October 1955 under Lt. Cmdr. Samuel T. Bussey as the second submarine equipped with the Regulus missile, having been converted in 1953. In this role, &quot;Barbero&quot; was equipped with a hangar housing two missiles and a launcher on the after deck. One of the limitations of Regulus was that the firing submarine had to surface, the missile then being rolled out onto the launcher and fired. Regulus I also required guidance from submarines or other platforms after firing. She operated off the coast of California, firing her first test missile near San Clemente Island on 14 March 1956, until April 1956, when she transited the Panama Canal and joined the Atlantic Fleet, based at Norfolk, Virginia. From there, she served as an integral part in the nation&#x27;s defense against nuclear war by carrying out early versions of the deterrent patrols that later became a regular feature of the submarine force after the introduction of the fleet ballistic missile submarine. She conducted patrols in the Atlantic for the next three years, under a policy of having one Regulus boat in each ocean.

On 1 July 1959, &quot;Barbero&quot; was reassigned to the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s Submarine Squadron 1, based at Pearl Harbor to conduct deterrent patrols in the Pacific due to a shift in policy placing all deployed Regulus assets there. She usually patrolled with &quot;Tunny&quot; to provide four missiles on station. In January 1962, &quot;Barbero&quot; entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for an extensive five-month overhaul. During that time, members of her crew pursued various fields of training and education at service schools in Hawaii and on the United States West Coast. After concluding the overhaul in June 1962, &quot;Barbero&quot; carried out local operations and conducted refresher training. She then completed a single deterrent patrol in the latter half of 1962. &quot;Barbero&quot; conducted another two deterrent patrols in 1963, making liberty calls in East Asian ports at the conclusion of each.

====Missile Mail====
In 1959 &quot;Barbero&quot; assisted the United States Post Office Department, predecessor of what in 1971 became today&#x27;s United States Postal Service (USPS), in its search for faster, more efficient forms of mail transportation. The Post Office tried its first and only delivery of &quot;Missile Mail&quot;, though the idea of delivering mail by rocket was not new. Shortly before noon on 8 June 1959, off the northern Florida coast under command of her new skipper Robert H. Blount, &quot;Barbero&quot; fired a Regulus cruise missile towards the Naval Auxiliary Air Station, Mayport, Florida. Twenty-two minutes later the training type missile landed at its target; its training-type warhead having been configured to contain two official USPS mail containers.

The Post Office had officially established a branch post office on &quot;Barbero&quot; and delivered some 3,000 pieces of mail to it before &quot;Barbero&quot; left Norfolk, Virginia. The mail consisted entirely of commemorative postal covers addressed to President of the United States Dwight Eisenhower, other government officials, the Postmasters General of all members of the Universal Postal Union, and so on. They contained letters from United States Postmaster General Arthur E. Summerfield. Their postage (four cents domestic, eight cents international) had been cancelled &quot;USS Barbero 8 June 9.30 am 1959&quot; before the boat put to sea. In Mayport, the Regulus was opened and the mail forwarded to the Jacksonville, Florida Post Office for further sorting and routing.

Upon witnessing the missile&#x27;s landing, Summerfield stated, &quot;This peacetime employment of a guided missile for the important and practical purpose of carrying mail, is the first known official use of missiles by any Post Office Department of any nation.&quot; Summerfield proclaimed the event to be &quot;of historic significance to the peoples of the entire world,&quot; and predicted that &quot;before man reaches the moon, mail will be delivered within hours from New York to California, to Britain, to India or Australia by guided missiles. We stand on the threshold of rocket mail.&quot;

==Decommissioning and disposal==
Regulus was superseded by the Polaris missile in 1964. &quot;Barbero&quot; ended her nuclear strategic deterrent patrols and was decommissioned on 30 June 1964. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Registry on 1 July 1964, prior to being used as a target and sunk by the submarine off Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 7 October 1964.

<doc id="67042" wikidata="Q811964" url="?curid=67042" title="Weatherization">
<text>Weatherization (American English) or weatherproofing (British English) is the practice of protecting a building and its interior from the elements, particularly from sunlight, precipitation, and wind, and of modifying a building to reduce energy consumption and optimize energy efficiency.

Weatherization is distinct from building insulation, although building insulation requires weatherization for proper functioning. Many types of insulation can be thought of as weatherization, because they block drafts or protect from cold winds. Whereas insulation primarily reduces &quot;conductive&quot; heat flow, weatherization primarily reduces &quot;convective&quot; heat flow.

In the United States, buildings use one third of all energy consumed and two thirds of all electricity. Due to the high energy usage, they are a major source of the pollution that causes urban air quality problems and pollutants that contribute to climate change. Building energy usage accounts for 49 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions, 25 percent of nitrous oxide emissions, and 10 percent of particulate emissions.

==Procedures==
Typical weatherization procedures include:
*Sealing bypasses (cracks, gaps, holes), especially around doors, windows, pipes and wiring that penetrate the ceiling and floor, and other areas with high potential for heat loss, using caulk, foam sealant, weather-stripping, window film, door sweeps, electrical receptacle gaskets, and so on to reduce infiltration.
*Sealing recessed lighting fixtures (&#x27;can lights&#x27; or &#x27;high-hats&#x27;), which leak large amounts of air into unconditioned attic space.
*Sealing air ducts, which can account for 20% of heat loss, using fiber-reinforced mastic (not duck/duct tape, which is not suitable for this purpose)
*Installing/replacing dampers in exhaust ducts, to prevent outside air from entering the house when the exhaust fan or clothes dryer is not in use.
*Protecting pipes from corrosion and freezing.
*Installing footing drains, foundation waterproofing membranes, interior perimeter drains, sump pump, gutters, downspout extensions, downward-sloping grading, French drains, swales, and other techniques to protect a building from both surface water and ground water.
*Providing proper ventilation to unconditioned spaces to protect a building from the effects of condensation. See Ventilation issues in houses
*Installing roofing, building wrap, siding, flashing, skylights or solar tubes and making sure they are in good condition on an existing building.
*Installing insulation in walls, floors, and ceilings, around ducts and pipes, around water heaters, and near the foundation and sill.
*Installing storm doors and storm windows.
*Replacing old drafty doors with tightly sealing, foam-core doors.
*Retrofitting older windows with a stop or parting bead across the sill where it meets the sash.
*Replacing older windows with low-energy, double-glazed windows.

The phrase &quot;whole-house weatherization&quot; extends the traditional definition of weatherization to include installation of modern, energy-saving heating and cooling equipment, or repair of old, inefficient equipment (furnaces, boilers, water heaters, programmable thermostats, air conditioners, and so on). The &quot;Whole-House&quot; approach also looks at how the house performs as a system.

==Air quality==
Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air quality problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.

Weatherization may have a negative impact on indoor air quality, if done improperly, exacerbating respiratory conditions especially among occupants with pre-existing respiratory illnesses. This may occur because of a drastic decrease in air exchange rate in the home, introduction of new chemicals, and poor management of indoor moisture due to a poorly performed weatherization work. Low air exchange rates may lead to higher concentrations of pollutants in the air when ventilation is not sufficiently addressed during weatherization work. However, the situation may be different in case of a house situated in an area with high outdoor air pollution levels such as in close proximity (&lt;200 m) from a busy major road. In such a scenario, a more airtight building envelope can actually offer protection against infiltration of outdoor air pollution. The same is true for the protection offered by tighter building envelopes during wildfire events that cause elevated levels of outdoor air pollution.

==US Weatherization Assistance Program==

Weatherization is a set of measures and practices aimed at improving the energy efficiency of a building or home, primarily to reduce energy consumption and lower utility bills. The main goal of weatherization is to make a structure more comfortable and cost-effective to live in, especially during extreme weather conditions. It involves making various improvements to a building&#x27;s insulation, air sealing, and overall energy systems.

The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy estimates that over 7 million homes have been weatherized, giving yearly savings of 2.6 TWh of electricity, of fossil gas and of reduced carbon dioxide emissions. The US Department of Energy estimates weatherization returns $2.69 for each dollar spent on the program, realized in energy and non-energy benefits. Families whose homes are weatherized are expected to save $358 on their first year&#x27;s utility bills.

Low Income Home Energy Assistance Programs in many states work side by side with WAP to provide both immediate and long-term solutions to energy poverty.

<doc id="67043" wikidata="Q918306" url="?curid=67043" title="Thermal insulation">
<text>Thermal insulation is the reduction of heat transfer (i.e., the transfer of thermal energy between objects of differing temperature) between objects in thermal contact or in range of radiative influence. Thermal insulation can be achieved with specially engineered methods or processes, as well as with suitable object shapes and materials.

Heat flow is an inevitable consequence of contact between objects of different temperature. Thermal insulation provides a region of insulation in which thermal conduction is reduced, creating a thermal break or thermal barrier, or thermal radiation is reflected rather than absorbed by the lower-temperature body.

The insulating capability of a material is measured as the inverse of thermal conductivity (k). Low thermal conductivity is equivalent to high insulating capability (resistance value). In thermal engineering, other important properties of insulating materials are product density (ρ) and specific heat capacity (c).

== Definition ==

Thermal conductivity &quot;k&quot; is measured in watts-per-meter per kelvin (W·m−1·K−1 or W/mK). This is because heat transfer, measured as power, has been found to be (approximately) proportional to 
* difference of temperature formula_1
* the surface area of thermal contact formula_2
* the inverse of the thickness of the material formula_3
From this, it follows that the power of heat loss formula_4 is given by
formula_5

Thermal conductivity depends on the material and for fluids, its temperature and pressure. For comparison purposes, conductivity under standard conditions (20 °C at 1 atm) is commonly used. For some materials, thermal conductivity may also depend upon the direction of heat transfer.
The act of insulation is accomplished by encasing an object in material with low thermal conductivity in high thickness. Decreasing the exposed surface area could also lower heat transfer, but this quantity is usually fixed by the geometry of the object to be insulated.

Multi-layer insulation is used where radiative loss dominates, or when the user is restricted in volume and weight of the insulation (e.g. emergency blanket, radiant barrier)

===Insulation of cylinders===
For insulated cylinders, a &quot;critical radius&quot; blanket must be reached. Before the critical radius is reached, any added insulation increases heat transfer. The convective thermal resistance is inversely proportional to the surface area and therefore the radius of the cylinder, while the thermal resistance of a cylindrical shell (the insulation layer) depends on the ratio between outside and inside radius, not on the radius itself. If the outside radius of a cylinder is increased by applying insulation, a fixed amount of conductive resistance (equal to 2×π×k×L(Tin-Tout)/ln(Rout/Rin)) is added. However, at the same time, the convective resistance is reduced. This implies that adding insulation below a certain critical radius actually increases the heat transfer. For insulated cylinders, the critical radius is given by the equation

:formula_6

This equation shows that the critical radius depends only on the heat transfer coefficient and the thermal conductivity of the insulation. If the radius of the insulated cylinder is smaller than the critical radius for insulation, the addition of any amount of insulation will increase heat transfer.

==Applications==

===Clothing and natural animal insulation in birds and mammals===

Gases possess poor thermal conduction properties compared to liquids and solids and thus make good insulation material if they can be trapped. In order to further augment the effectiveness of a gas (such as air), it may be disrupted into small cells, which cannot effectively transfer heat by natural convection. Convection involves a larger bulk flow of gas driven by buoyancy and temperature differences, and it does not work well in small cells where there is little density difference to drive it, and the high surface-to-volume ratios of the small cells retards gas flow in them by means of viscous drag.

In order to accomplish small gas cell formation in man-made thermal insulation, glass and polymer materials can be used to trap air in a foam-like structure. This principle is used industrially in building and piping insulation such as (glass wool), cellulose, rock wool, polystyrene foam (styrofoam), urethane foam, vermiculite, perlite, and cork. Trapping air is also the principle in all highly insulating clothing materials such as wool, down feathers and fleece.

The air-trapping property is also the insulation principle employed by homeothermic animals to stay warm, for example down feathers, and insulating hair such as natural sheep&#x27;s wool. In both cases the primary insulating material is air, and the polymer used for trapping the air is natural keratin protein.

===Buildings===
Maintaining acceptable temperatures in buildings (by heating and cooling) uses a large proportion of global energy consumption. Building insulations also commonly use the principle of small trapped air-cells as explained above, e.g. fiberglass (specifically glass wool), cellulose, rock wool, polystyrene foam, urethane foam, vermiculite, perlite, cork, etc. For a period of time, asbestos was also used, however, it caused health problems. 

Window insulation film can be applied in weatherization applications to reduce incoming thermal radiation in summer and loss in winter.

When well insulated, a building is:
* energy efficient and cheaper to keep warm in the winter, or cool in the summer. Energy efficiency will lead to a reduced carbon footprint.
* more comfortable because there is uniform temperatures throughout the space. There is less temperature gradient both vertically (between ankle height and head height) and horizontally from exterior walls, ceilings and windows to the interior walls, thus producing a more comfortable occupant environment when outside temperatures are extremely cold or hot.

In industry, energy has to be expended to raise, lower, or maintain the temperature of objects or process fluids. If these are not insulated, this increases the energy requirements of a process, and therefore the cost and environmental impact.

===Mechanical systems===

Space heating and cooling systems distribute heat throughout buildings by means of pipes or ductwork. Insulating these pipes using pipe insulation reduces energy into unoccupied rooms and prevents condensation from occurring on cold and chilled pipework.

Pipe insulation is also used on water supply pipework to help delay pipe freezing for an acceptable length of time.

Mechanical insulation is commonly installed in industrial and commercial facilities.

=== Passive radiative cooling surfaces ===
Thermal insulation has been found to improve the thermal emittance of passive radiative cooling surfaces by increasing the surface&#x27;s ability to lower temperatures below ambient under direct solar intensity. Different materials may be used for thermal insulation, including polyethylene aerogels that reduce solar absorption and parasitic heat gain which may improve the emitter&#x27;s performance by over 20%. Other aerogels also exhibited strong thermal insulation performance for radiative cooling surfaces, including a silica-alumina nanofibrous aerogel.

=== Refrigeration ===
A refrigerator consists of a heat pump and a thermally insulated compartment.

===Spacecraft===
Launch and re-entry place severe mechanical stresses on spacecraft, so the strength of an insulator is critically important; the failure of insulating tiles on the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; caused the shuttle airframe to overheat and break apart during reentry, killing the astronauts on board. Re-entry through the atmosphere generates very high temperatures due to compression of the air at high speeds. Insulators must meet demanding physical properties beyond their thermal transfer retardant properties. Examples of insulation used on spacecraft include reinforced carbon-carbon composite nose cone and silica fiber tiles of the Space Shuttle. See also Insulative paint.

===Automotive===

Internal combustion engines produce a lot of heat during their combustion cycle. This can have a negative effect when it reaches various heat-sensitive components such as sensors, batteries, and starter motors. As a result, thermal insulation is necessary to prevent the heat from the exhaust from reaching these components.

High performance cars often use thermal insulation as a means to increase engine performance.

===Aerospace===
Aircraft engines such as turbojets use thermal barriers on components such as the combuster sections/afterburner for heat protection.

===Greenhouse===
Thermal insulation is integral to greenhouse design, enabling controlled environments for plant growth and energy efficiency. Common insulation techniques include the use of double-layer films and multi-wall polycarbonate panels, which trap air between layers to reduce heat transfer while maintaining sufficient light transmission for photosynthesis. These measures improve energy efficiency and support year-round crop production, significantly reducing heating costs.

==Factors influencing performance==
Insulation performance is influenced by many factors, the most prominent of which include:

* Thermal conductivity (&quot;k&quot; or &quot;λ&quot; value)
* Surface emissivity (&quot;ε&quot; value)
* Insulation thickness
* Density
* Specific heat capacity
* Thermal bridging

It is important to note that the factors influencing performance may vary over time as material ages or environmental conditions change.

==Calculating requirements==
Industry standards are often rules of thumb, developed over many years, that offset many conflicting goals: what people will pay for, manufacturing cost, local climate, traditional building practices, and varying standards of comfort. Both heat transfer and layer analysis may be performed in large industrial applications, but in household situations (appliances and building insulation), airtightness is the key in reducing heat transfer due to air leakage (forced or natural convection). Once airtightness is achieved, it has often been sufficient to choose the thickness of the insulating layer based on rules of thumb. Diminishing returns are achieved with each successive doubling of the insulating layer.
It can be shown that for some systems, there is a minimum insulation thickness required for an improvement to be realized.

<text>In building design, thermal mass is a property of the matter of a building that requires a flow of heat in order for it to change temperature. 

Not all writers agree on what physical property of matter &quot;thermal mass&quot; describes. Most writers use it as a synonym for heat capacity, the ability of a body to store thermal energy. It is typically referred to by the symbol &quot;C&quot;th, and its SI unit is J/K or J/°C (which are equivalent). 

However: 
* Christoph Reinhart at MIT describes thermal mass as its volume times its volumetric heat capacity. 

* Randa Ghattas, Franz-Joseph Ulm and Alison Ledwith, also at MIT, write that &quot;It [thermal mass] is dependent on the relationship between the specific heat capacity, density, thickness and conductivity of a material&quot; although they don&#x27;t provide a unit, describing materials only as &quot;low&quot; or &quot;high&quot; thermal mass.
* Chris Reardon equates thermal mass with volumetric heat capacity . 

The lack of a consistent definition of what property of matter thermal mass describes has led some writers to dismiss its use in building design as pseudoscience.

==Background==

The equation relating thermal energy to thermal mass is:
:formula_1
where &quot;Q&quot; is the thermal energy transferred, &quot;C&quot;th is the thermal mass of the body, and Δ&quot;T&quot; is the change in temperature.

For example, if 250 J of heat energy is added to a copper gear with a thermal mass of 38.46 J/°C, its temperature will rise by 6.50 °C.
If the body consists of a homogeneous material with sufficiently known physical properties, the thermal mass is simply the mass of material present times the specific heat capacity of that material. For bodies made of many materials, the sum of heat capacities for their pure components may be used in the calculation, or in some cases (as for a whole animal, for example) the number may simply be measured for the entire body in question, directly.

As an extensive property, heat capacity is characteristic of an object; its corresponding intensive property is specific heat capacity, expressed in terms of a measure of the amount of material such as mass or number of moles, which must be multiplied by similar units to give the heat capacity of the entire body of material. Thus the heat capacity can be equivalently calculated as the product of the mass &quot;m&quot; of the body and the specific heat capacity &quot;c&quot; for the material, or the product of the number of moles of molecules present &quot;n&quot; and the molar specific heat capacity formula_2. For discussion of &quot;why&quot; the thermal energy storage abilities of pure substances vary, see factors that affect specific heat capacity.

For a body of uniform composition, formula_3 can be approximated by
:formula_4
where formula_5 is the mass of the body and formula_6 is the isobaric specific heat capacity of the material averaged over temperature range in question. For bodies composed of numerous different materials, the thermal masses for the different components can just be added together.

==Heat capacity in buildings==
Christoph Reinhard describes the impact of heat capacity this way: 

Heat capacity is not normally calculated in the engineering of buildings. In the United States and Canada, national building codes and most state and local jurisdictions require that heating and cooling equipment be sized in accordance with Manual J of the Air Conditioning Contractors of America. The Manual J process uses detailed measurements of a building&#x27;s dimensions, construction, insulation, air-tightness, features and occupant loads, but it does not take into effect the heat capacity. Some heat capacity is presumed in the Manual J process, equipment sized according to Manual J is sized to maintain comfort at the first percentile of temperature for heating and the 99th percentile of temperature for cooling. The process presumes that the building has sufficient heat capacity to maintain comfort during brief excursions outside of those extremes.

<doc id="67047" wikidata="Q313304" url="?curid=67047" title="Soichiro Honda">
<text>was a Japanese engineer and industrialist. In 1948, he established Honda Motor Co., Ltd. and oversaw its expansion from a wooden shack manufacturing bicycle motors to a multinational automobile and motorcycle manufacturer.

== Early years ==
Honda was born in Kōmyō village, Iwata District, Shizuoka, near Hamamatsu on November 17, 1906. He spent his early childhood helping his father, Gihei Honda, a blacksmith, with his bicycle repair business. At the time his mother, Mika Honda, was a weaver. Honda was not interested in traditional education. His school handed grade reports to the children, but required that they be returned stamped with the family seal, to make sure that a parent had seen it. Honda created a stamp to forge his family seal out of a used rubber bicycle pedal cover. The fraud was soon discovered when he started to make forged stamps for other children. Honda was unaware that the stamp was supposed to be mirror-imaged. His family name 本田 (Honda) is symmetrical when written vertically, so it did not cause a problem, but some of the other children&#x27;s family names were not. 

Even as a toddler, Honda had been thrilled by the first car that was ever seen in his village. In later life, he would often say that he could never forget the smell of oil it gave off, saying that it smelled &quot;like perfume&quot;.
Soichiro once borrowed one of his father&#x27;s bicycles to see a demonstration of an airplane made by pilot Art Smith, which cemented his love for machinery and invention. 

At 15, without any formal education, Honda left home and headed to Tokyo to look for work. He obtained an apprenticeship at a garage in 1922. After some hesitation over his employment, he stayed for six years, working as a car mechanic before returning home to start his own auto repair business in 1928 at the age of 22.

Honda raced a turbocharged Ford in the &quot;1st Japan Automobile Race&quot; at Tamagawa Speedway in 1936. He crashed and seriously injured his left eye. His brother was also injured. After that, he quit racing.

==Development of Honda Motor Co., Ltd.==
In 1937, Honda founded Tōkai Seiki to produce piston rings for Toyota. During World War II, a US B-29 bomber attack destroyed Tōkai Seiki&#x27;s Yamashita plant in 1944 and the Iwata plant collapsed in the 1945 Mikawa earthquake. After the war, Honda sold the salvageable remains of the company to Toyota for ¥450,000 and used the proceeds to found the Honda Technical Research Institute in October 1946. In 1948 he started producing a complete motorized bicycle, the Type A, which was driven by the first mass-produced engine designed by Honda, and was sold until 1951. The Type D in 1949 was a true motorcycle with a pressed-steel frame designed and produced by Honda and with a 2-stroke, engine, and became the first model in the Dream series of motorcycles. The lists both the Type A and the Type D models as two of their &quot;240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology&quot;.
After the war, Honda became reacquainted with his friend Takeo Fujisawa, whom he had known during his days as a supplier of piston rings to Nakajima Aircraft Company. In 1949, Honda hired Fujisawa, who oversaw the financial side of the company and helped the firm expand. In 1959, Honda Motorcycles opened its first dealership in the United States. As president of the Honda Motor Company, Soichiro Honda turned the company into a billion-dollar multinational that produced the best-selling motorcycles in the world. Honda&#x27;s engineering and marketing skills resulted in Honda motorcycles outselling Triumph and Harley-Davidson in their respective home markets. 

Honda remained president until his retirement in 1973, where he stayed on as director and was appointed &quot;supreme advisor&quot; in 1983. His status was such that &quot;People&quot; magazine placed him on their &quot;25 Most Intriguing People of the Year&quot; list for 1980, dubbing him &quot;the Japanese Henry Ford.&quot; In retirement, Honda busied himself with work connected with the Honda Foundation. In his memoirs, Soichiro Honda expressed his sorrow for sometimes being rude to his employees, humiliating and occasionally even slapping them in the face.

==Last years==
Even at his advanced age, Soichiro and his wife Sachi both held private pilot&#x27;s licenses. He also enjoyed skiing, golf, racing cars, hang gliding and ballooning at 77, and he was a highly accomplished artist. He and Takeo Fujisawa made a pact never to force their own sons to join the company. His son, Hirotoshi Honda, was the founder and former CEO of Mugen Motorsports, a tuner for Honda vehicles who also created original racing vehicles. 

ASME established the Soichiro Honda Medal in recognition of Mr. Honda&#x27;s achievements in 1982; this medal recognizes outstanding achievement or significant engineering contributions in the field of personal transportation. In 1989, he was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame near Detroit. 

Soichiro Honda died on August 5, 1991, days before the Hungarian Grand Prix, of liver failure. He was 84. Ayrton Senna, winner of the Grand Prix, dedicated the victory to Honda. He was posthumously appointed to the senior third rank in the order of precedence and appointed a Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun.

<text>Selaginella, also known as spikemosses or lesser clubmosses, is a genus of lycophyte. It is usually treated as the only genus in the family Selaginellaceae, with over 750 known species.

This family is distinguished from Lycopodiaceae (the clubmosses) by having scale-leaves bearing a ligule and by having spores of two types. They are sometimes included in an informal paraphyletic group called the &quot;fern allies&quot;. The species &quot;S. moellendorffii&quot; is an important model organism. Its genome has been sequenced by the United States Department of Energy&#x27;s Joint Genome Institute. The name &quot;Selaginella&quot; was erected by Palisot de Beauvois solely for the species &quot;Selaginella selaginoides&quot;, which turns out (with the closely related &quot;Selaginella deflexa&quot;) to be a clade that is sister to all other &quot;Selaginellas&quot;, so any definitive subdivision of the species into separate genera leaves two taxa in &quot;Selaginella&quot;, with the hundreds of other species in new or resurrected genera.

&quot;Selaginella&quot; occurs mostly in the tropical regions of the world, with a handful of species to be found in the arctic-alpine zones of both hemispheres. Fossils assignable to the modern genus are known spanning over 300 million years from the Late Carboniferous to the present.

== Description ==
&quot;Selaginella&quot; species are creeping or ascendant plants with simple, scale-like leaves (microphylls) on branching stems from which roots also arise. The stems are aerial, horizontally creeping on the substratum (as in &quot;Selaginella kraussiana&quot;), sub-erect (&quot;Selaginella trachyphylla&quot;) or erect (as in &quot;Selaginella erythropus&quot;). The vascular steles are polystelic protosteles. Stem section shows the presence of more than two protosteles. Each stele is made up of diarch (having two strands of xylem) and exarch (growing outward in) xylems. The steles are connected with the cortex by means of many tube-like structures called trabeculae, which are modified endodermal cells with casparian strips on their lateral walls. The stems contain no pith.

In &quot;Selaginella&quot;, each microphyll and sporophyll has a small scale-like outgrowth called a ligule at the base of the upper surface. The plants are heterosporous with spores of two different size classes, known as megaspores and microspores.

Unusual for the lycopods, which nearly always have microphylls with a single unbranched vein, the microphylls of a few &quot;Selaginella&quot; species contain a branched vascular trace.

Under dry conditions, some species of &quot;Selaginella&quot; can survive dehydration. In this state, they may roll up into brown balls and be uprooted, but can rehydrate under moist conditions, become green again and resume growth. This phenomenon is known as poikilohydry, and poikilohydric plants such as &quot;Selaginella bryopteris&quot; are sometimes referred to as resurrection plants.

There is no evidence of whole genome duplication in Selaginella&#x27;s evolutionary history. Instead they have gone through tandem gene duplications, which is particularly noticeable in genes relevant for desiccation tolerance.

Their chloroplasts are missing about two-thirds of their plastidial tRNA genes, which are instead found in the genome of the nucleus. The genus is unique among vascular plants in having species with monoplastidic cells, single giant chloroplasts, located mostly in their dorsal epidermal cells, but also in the upper mesophyll of some species. This appears to be a derived traits and an adaptation to low-light conditions, having originated at least twice. Cells with multiplastidic chloroplasts, more than ten chloroplasts per cell, are considered most basal, and are found in species exposed to more light. Oligoplastidic cells, cells with 3 to ten chloroplats, are more adated to weaker light, and the monoplastidic species being the most shade-loving forms. It is estimated that 70% of Selaginella species are monoplastidic. These receive just 0.4~2.1% of full sunlight, while species with multiple chloroplasts live in open places where they on average receive more than 40.5% of full sunlight.

== Taxonomy ==

Some scientists still place the Selaginellales in the class Lycopodiopsida (often misconstructed as &quot;Lycopsida&quot;). Some modern authors recognize three generic divisions of &quot;Selaginella&quot;: &quot;Selaginella&quot;, &quot;Bryodesma&quot; , and &quot;Lycopodioides&quot; . &quot;Lycopodioides&quot; would include the North American species &quot;S. apoda&quot; and &quot;S. eclipes&quot;, while &quot;Bryodesma&quot; would include &quot;S. rupestris&quot; (as &quot;Bryodesma rupestre&quot;). &quot;Stachygynandrum&quot; is also sometimes used to include the bulk of species.

The first major attempt to define and subdivide the group was by Palisot de Beauvois in 1803–1805. He established the genus &quot;Selaginella&quot; as a monotypic genus, and placed the bulk of species in &quot;Stachygynandrum&quot;. &quot;Gymnogynum&quot; was another monotypic genus, but that name is superseded by his own earlier name of &quot;Didiclis&quot;. This turns out, today, to be a group of around 45–50 species also known as the &quot;Articulatae&quot;, since his genus &quot;Didiclis/Gymnogynum&quot; was based on &quot;Selaginella plumosa&quot;. He also described the genus &quot;Diplostachyum&quot; to include a group of species similar to &quot;Selaginella apoda&quot;. Spring inflated the genus &quot;Selaginella&quot; to hold all selaginelloid species four decades later.

Phylogenetic studies by Korall &amp; Kenrick determined that the &quot;Euselaginella&quot; group, comprising solely the type species, &quot;Selaginella selaginoides&quot; and a closely related Hawaiian species, &quot;Selaginella deflexa&quot;, is a basal and anciently diverging sister to all other &quot;Selaginella&quot; species. Beyond this, their study split the remainder of species into two broad groups, one including the &quot;Bryodesma&quot; species, the &quot;Articulatae&quot;, section &quot;Ericetorum&quot; and others, and the other centered on the broad &quot;Stachygynandrum&quot; group.

In 2023, Zhou &amp; Zhang suggested that the genus should be broken up into 19 different genera.

A few species of &quot;Selaginella&quot; are desert plants known as &quot;resurrection plants&quot;, because they curl up in a tight, brown or reddish ball during dry times, and uncurl and turn green in the presence of moisture. Other species are tropical forest plants that appear at first glance to be ferns.

== Cultivation ==

A number of &quot;Selaginella&quot; species are popular plants for cultivation, mostly tropical species. Some of the species popularly cultivated and actively available commercially include:
* &quot;S. kraussiana&quot;: golden clubmoss
* &quot;S. martensii&quot;: frosty fern
* &quot;S. moellendorffii&quot;: gemmiferous spikemoss
* &quot;S. erythropus&quot;: red selaginella or ruby-red spikemoss
* &quot;S. uncinata&quot;: peacock moss
* &quot;S. lepidophylla&quot;: resurrection plant
* &quot;S. braunii&quot;: arborvitae fern

<text>The Tutsi ( ), also called Watusi, Watutsi or Abatutsi (), are an ethnic group of the African Great Lakes region. They are a Bantu-speaking ethnic group and the second largest of three main ethnic groups in Rwanda and Burundi (the other two being the largest Bantu ethnic group Hutu and the Pygmy group of the Twa).

Historically, the Tutsi were pastoralists and filled the ranks of the warriors&#x27; caste. Before 1962, they regulated and controlled Rwandan society, which was composed of Tutsi aristocracy and Hutu commoners, utilizing a clientship structure. They occupied the dominant positions in the sharply stratified society and constituted the ruling class.

==Origins and classification==

The definition of &quot;Tutsi&quot; has changed through time and location. Social structures were not stable throughout Rwanda, even during colonial times under the Belgian rule. The Tutsi aristocracy or elite was distinguished from Tutsi commoners.

When the Belgian colonists conducted censuses, they wanted to identify the people throughout Rwanda-Burundi according to a simple classification scheme. They defined &quot;Tutsi&quot; as anyone owning more than ten cows (a sign of wealth) or with the physical features of a longer thin nose, high cheekbones, and being over six feet tall, all of which are common descriptions associated with the Tutsi.

In the colonial era, the Tutsi were hypothesized to have arrived in the Great Lakes region from the Horn of Africa, in accordance with the Hamitic hypothesis.

Tutsi were considered by some to be of Cushitic origin, although they do not speak a Cushitic language, and have lived in the areas where they presently inhabit for at least 400 years, leading to considerable intermarriage with the Hutu in the area. Due to the history of intermingling and intermarrying of Hutu and Tutsi, some ethnographers and historians are of the view that Hutu and Tutsi cannot be called distinct ethnic groups. 

==Genetics==


===Y-DNA (paternal lineages)===
Modern-day genetic studies of the Y-chromosome generally indicate that the Tutsi, like the Hutu, are largely of Bantu extraction (60% E1b1a, 20% B, 4% E-P2(xE1b1a)).

Paternal genetic influences associated with the Horn of Africa and North Africa are few (under 3% E1b1b-M35), and are ascribed to much earlier inhabitants who were assimilated. However, the Tutsi have considerably more haplogroup B Y-DNA paternal lineages (14.9% B) than do the Hutu (4.3% B).

===Autosomal DNA (overall ancestry)===
In general, the Tutsi appear to share a close genetic kinship with neighboring Bantu populations, particularly the Hutu. However, it is unclear whether this similarity is primarily due to extensive genetic exchanges between these communities through intermarriage or whether it ultimately stems from common origins:

[...] generations of gene flow obliterated whatever clear-cut physical distinctions may have once existed between these two Bantu peoples – renowned to be height, body build, and facial features. With a spectrum of physical variation in the peoples, Belgian authorities legally mandated ethnic affiliation in the 1920s, based on economic criteria. Formal and discrete social divisions were consequently imposed upon ambiguous biological distinctions. To some extent, the permeability of these categories in the intervening decades helped to reify the biological distinctions, generating a taller elite and a shorter underclass, but with little relation to the gene pools that had existed a few centuries ago. The social categories are thus real, but there is little if any detectable genetic differentiation between Hutu and Tutsi.

===Height===
Their average height is , although individuals have been recorded as being taller than .

==History==

Prior to the arrival of colonists, Rwanda had been ruled by a Tutsi-dominated monarchy since the 15th century. In 1897, Germany established a presence in Rwanda with the formation of an alliance with the king, beginning the colonial era. Later, Belgium took control in 1916 during World War I. Both European nations ruled through the Rwandan king and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy.

In Burundi, meanwhile, a ruling faction known as the &quot;ganwa&quot; emerged and quickly assumed effective control of the country&#x27;s administration. The &quot;ganwa&quot; who relied on support from both Hutu and Tutsi populations to rule, were perceived within Burundi as neither Hutu nor Tutsi.

Rwanda was ruled as a colony by Germany (from 1897 to 1916) and by Belgium (from 1922 to 1961). Both the Tutsi and Hutu had been the traditional governing elite, but both colonial powers allowed only the Tutsi to be educated and to participate in the colonial government. Such discriminatory policies engendered resentment.

When the Belgians took over, they believed it could be better governed if they continued to identify the different populations. In the 1920s, they required people to identify with a particular ethnic group and classified them accordingly in censuses.

In 1959, Belgium reversed its stance and allowed the majority Hutu to assume control of the government through universal elections after independence. This partly reflected internal Belgian domestic politics, in which the discrimination against the Hutu majority came to be regarded as similar to oppression within Belgium stemming from the Flemish-Walloon conflict, and the democratization and empowerment of the Hutu was seen as a just response to the Tutsi domination. Belgian policies wavered and flip-flopped considerably during this period leading up to independence of Burundi and Rwanda.

===Independence of Rwanda and Burundi (1962)===
The Hutu majority in Rwanda had revolted against the Tutsi and was able to take power. Tutsi fled and created exile communities outside Rwanda in Uganda and Tanzania. Their actions led to the deaths of up to 200,000 Hutu. Overt discrimination from the colonial period was continued by different Rwandan and Burundian governments, including identity cards that distinguished Tutsi and Hutu.

===Burundian genocide (1993)===

In 1993, Burundi&#x27;s first democratically elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was assassinated by Tutsi officers, as was the person entitled to succeed him under the constitution. This sparked a genocide in Burundi between Hutu political structures and the Tutsi, in which &quot;possibly as many as 25,000 Tutsi&quot; – including military, civil servants and civilians – were murdered by the former and &quot;at least as many&quot; Hutu were killed by the latter. Since the 2000 Arusha Peace Process, today in Burundi the Tutsi minority shares power in a more or less equitable manner with the Hutu majority. Traditionally, the Tutsi had held more economic power and controlled the military.

===1994 genocide against the Tutsi===
A similar pattern of events took place in Rwanda, but there the Hutu came to power in 1962. They in turn often oppressed the Tutsi, who fled the country. After the anti-Tutsi violence around 1959–1961, Tutsi fled in large numbers.

These exile Tutsi communities gave rise to Tutsi rebel movements. The Rwandan Patriotic Front, mostly made up of exiled Tutsi living primarily in Uganda, attacked Rwanda in 1990 with the intention of taking back the power. The RPF had experience in organized irregular warfare from the Ugandan Bush War, and got much support from the government of Uganda. The initial RPF advance was halted by the lift of French arms to the Rwandan government. Attempts at peace culminated in the Arusha Accords.

The agreement broke down after the assassination of the Rwandan and Burundian Presidents, triggering a resumption of hostilities and the start of the Rwandan Genocide of 1994, in which the Hutu then in power killed an estimated 500,000–600,000 people, largely of Tutsi origin. Victorious in the aftermath of the genocide, the Tutsi-ruled RPF came to power in July 1994.

==Culture==

In the Rwanda territory, from the 15th century until 1961, the Tutsi were ruled by a king (the &quot;mwami&quot;). Belgium abolished the monarchy, following the national referendum that led to independence. By contrast, in the northwestern part of the country (predominantly Hutu), large regional landholders shared power, similar to Buganda society (in what is now Uganda).

Under their holy king, Tutsi culture traditionally revolved around administering justice and government. They were the only proprietors of cattle, and sustained themselves on their own products. Additionally, their lifestyle afforded them a lot of leisure time, which they spent cultivating the high arts of poetry, weaving and music. Due to the Tutsi&#x27;s status as a dominant minority vis-a-vis the Hutu farmers and the other local inhabitants, this relationship has been likened to that between lords and serfs in feudal Europe.
According to Fage (2013), the Tutsi are serologically related to Bantu and Nilotic populations. This in turn rules out a possible Cushitic origin for the founding Tutsi-Hima ruling class in the lacustrine kingdoms. However, the royal burial customs of the latter kingdoms are quite similar to those practiced by the former Cushitic Sidama states in the southern Gibe region of Ethiopia. By contrast, Bantu populations to the north of the Tutsi-Hima in the mount Kenya area such as the Agikuyu were until modern times essentially without a king (instead having a stateless age set system which they adopted from Cushitic peoples) while there were a number of Bantu kingdoms to the south of the Tutsi-Hima in Tanzania, all of which shared the Tutsi-Hima&#x27;s chieftaincy pattern. Since the Cushitic Sidama kingdoms interacted with Nilotic groups, Fage thus proposes that the Tutsi may have descended from one such migrating Nilotic population. The Nilotic ancestors of the Tutsi would thereby in earlier times have served as cultural intermediaries, adopting some monarchical traditions from adjacent Cushitic kingdoms and subsequently taking those borrowed customs south with them when they first settled amongst Bantu autochthones in the Great Lakes area. However, little difference can be ascertained between the cultures today of the Tutsi and Hutu; both groups speak the same Bantu language. The rate of intermarriage between the two groups was traditionally very high, and relations were amicable until the 20th century. Many scholars have concluded that the determination of Tutsi was and is mainly an expression of class or caste, rather than ethnicity. Rwandans have their own language, Kinyarwanda. English, French and Swahili serve as additional official languages for different historic reasons, and are widely spoken by Rwandans as a second language.

== Tutsi in the Congo ==
Scholars have long recognized that the Tutsi presence in the modern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is best understood by distinguishing between two principal groups, whose histories have been significantly shaped—and often distorted—by colonial policies and later political struggles.

=== The Banyamulenge ===
The Banyamulenge are an established Tutsi group primarily residing in parts of South Kivu. Extensive research shows that the Banyamulenge have deep historical roots in the eastern Congo that predate colonial rule. Colonial authorities, however, manipulated ethnic classifications to serve administrative and political purposes, a legacy that has contributed to contemporary tensions in the region.
=== Banyarwanda in North Kivu and South Kivu ===
A second Tutsi presence is found among the broader Banyarwanda community in parts of North Kivu and the Kalehe region of South Kivu. This community, which includes both Tutsi and Hutu, is largely the result of multiple migratory waves from neighboring Rwanda, occurring over the pre-colonial, colonial, and post-genocide periods. In particular, the mass exodus during and after the Rwandan Genocide of 1994 is well documented and has significantly reshaped the ethnic landscape in eastern Congo. The academic consensus holds that these migratory processes, far from being a single exogenous event, have complex historical antecedents that continue to influence regional politics.

=== Conflict and Contemporary Issues ===
The eastern DRC has been a hotspot of conflict for decades, involving numerous armed groups. Some of these, notably those evolving from the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) into what became known as the M23, have been led by individuals of Tutsi background. However, the portrayal of these groups solely through an ethnic lens oversimplifies the situation. Academic studies agree that the roots of the conflict lie in a mixture of colonial legacies, competition over valuable resources such as cobalt, and deep-seated political and social grievances. Reports from international organizations have documented serious human rights abuses—including the recruitment of child soldiers and illegal exploitation of mineral wealth—but these are best understood within the broader framework of state fragility and international economic pressures rather than as a straightforward ethnic conflict.

They inhabit South Sudan and the Gambela Region of Ethiopia, while also being a large minority in Kenya, Uganda, the north eastern border area of Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania. The Nilotic peoples consist of the Dinka, the Nuer, the Shilluk, the Luo peoples, the Alur, the Anuak, the Ateker peoples, the Kalenjin people and the Karamojong people also known as the Karamojong or Karimojong,Chaga people, Ngasa people, Datooga, Samburu, and the Maa-speaking peoples.

The Nilotes constitute the majority of the population in South Sudan while constituting as a substantional minority in the countries of Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. South Sudan is the area that is believed to be their original point of dispersal, as they constitute the second-most numerous group of peoples inhabiting the African Great Lakes region around the East African Rift. They make up a notable part of the population of North eastern Democratic Republic of Congo as well. Nilotic people are believed to numbered 50 million in the 21st century.

The Nilotic people primarily adhere to Christianity and traditional beliefs, with the majority of them being Christians. A small minority of Nilotes practice the religion of Islam.

==Name==
The terms &quot;Nilotic&quot; and &quot;Nilote&quot;&#x27; were previously used as racial subclassifications, based on anthropological observations of the supposed distinct body morphology of many Nilotic speakers. Twentieth-century social scientists have largely discarded such efforts to classify peoples according to physical characteristics, in favor of using linguistic studies to distinguish among peoples. They formed ethnicities and cultures based on a shared language. Since the late 20th century, however, social and physical scientists are making use of data from population genetics.

Nilotic and Nilote are now mainly used to refer to the various disparate people who speak languages in the same Nilotic language family. Etymologically, the terms Nilotic and Nilote (singular nilot) derive from the Nile Valley; specifically, the Upper Nile and its tributaries, where most Sudanese Nilo-Saharan-speaking people live.

==Ethnic and linguistic divisions==
===Languages===

Linguistically, Nilotic people are divided into three subgroups:
* Eastern Nilotic – Spoken by Nilotic populations in southwestern Ethiopia, eastern South Sudan, northeastern Uganda, western Kenya, and northern Tanzania, it includes languages such as Turkana and Maasai.
** Bari-Kuku-Kakwa-Pojulu-Mundari-Nyangwara-Nyepo and others
** Teso–Lotuko–Maa
* Southern Nilotic – Spoken by Nilotic populations in western Kenya, northern Tanzania, and eastern Uganda, it includes Kalenjin and Datog.
** Kalenjin
** Omotik-Datooga
* Western Nilotic – Spoken by Nilotic populations in South Sudan, Sudan, northeastern Congo (DRC), northern Uganda, southwestern Kenya, northern Tanzania, and southwestern Ethiopia, it includes the Dinka-Nuer languages, Luo languages, and the Burun languages.
** Dinka–Nuer-Atwot
** Luo languages
** Burun languages

===Ethnic groups===
Nilotic people constitute the bulk of the population of South Sudan. The largest of the Sudanese Nilotic peoples are the Dinka, who have as many as 25 ethnic subdivisions. The next-largest groups are the Nuer, followed by the Shilluk.

Nilotic people in Uganda includes the Luo peoples (Acholi, Alur, Adhola), the Ateker peoples (Iteso, Kumam, Karamojong, Lango people who despite speaking a mixture of Luo words, have Atekere origins, Sebei, and Kakwa).

In East Africa, the Nilotes are often subdivided into three general groups:
* The Plain Nilotes speak Maa languages and include the Maasai, Samburu, and Turkana peoples
* The River Lake Nilotes include the Joluo (Kenyan Luo), who are part of the larger Luo group
* The Highland Nilotes are subdivided into two groups, the Kalenjin and the Datog.
** Kalenjin: Elgeyo, Kipsigis, Marakwet, Nandi, Pokot, Sabaot, Lembus, Terik and Tugen [Keiyo]
** Datog: represented mainly by the Barabaig and small clusters of other Datog speakers

==History==
===Origins===


A proto-Nilotic unity, separate from an earlier undifferentiated Eastern Sudanic unity, is assumed to have emerged by the third millennium BC. The development of the proto-Nilotes as a group may have been connected with their domestication of livestock. The Eastern Sudanic unity must have been considerably earlier still, perhaps around the fifth millennium BC. The proposed Nilo-Saharan unity would date to the Upper Paleolithic about 15 thousand years ago. The original locus of the early Nilotic speakers was presumably east of the Nile in what is now South Sudan. The Proto-Nilotes of the third millennium BC were pastoralists, while their neighbors, the proto-Central Sudanic peoples, were mostly agriculturalists.

Nilotic people practised a mixed economy of cattle pastoralism, fishing, and seed cultivation. Some of the earliest archaeological findings on record, that describe a similar culture to this from the same region, are found at Kadero, 48 m north of Khartoum in Sudan and date to 3000 BC. Kadero contains the remains of a cattle pastoralist culture and a cemetery with skeletal remains featuring sub-Saharan African phenotypes. It also contains evidence of other animal domestication, artistry, long-distance trade, seed cultivation, and fish consumption.

Genetic and linguistic studies have demonstrated that Nubian people in Northern Sudan and Southern Egypt are an admixed group that started off as a population closely related to Nilotic people. This population later received significant gene flow from Middle Eastern and other East African populations. Nubians are considered to be descendants of the early inhabitants of the Nile valley who later formed the Kingdom of Kush, which included Kerma and Meroe and the medieval Christian kingdoms of Makuria, Nobatia, and Alodia. These studies suggest that populations closely related to Nilotic people long inhabited the Nile Valley as far as southern Egypt in antiquity.

===Early expansion===

Language evidence indicates an initial southward expansion out of the Nilotic nursery into far southern Sudan beginning in the second millennium BC,
the Southern Nilotic communities that participated in this expansion eventually reached western Kenya between 1000 and 500 BC. Their arrival occurred shortly before the introduction of iron to East Africa.

===Expansion out of the Lower Wadi Howar===

Linguistic studies indicate that the ancestors of the Nilotic peoples resided further north than their present locations. Archaeological evidence from sites in the Lower Wadi Howar reveals the presence of groups that are likely ancestral to both modern Nilotic speakers and Eastern Sudanic speakers as a whole. Scholars argue that these ancestors inhabited the Lower Wadi Howar region.

The archaeological findings in the Lower Wadi Howar reveal significant evidence of cultural continuity and interaction with ancient Nubian cultures, particularly through the association with the herringbone culture. As aridity increased during the fourth millennium BCE, the importance of cattle in the economic and social life of the region grew, leading to the emergence of distinct cultural practices, including the adoption of pottery styles characterized by incised herringbone patterns. These patterns indicate strong contact with the A-Group and pre-Kerma cultures along the Nubian Nile Valley. This interaction suggests that communities in the Lower Wadi Howar were actively engaged in trade networks, exchanging livestock and resources with these established cultures, thus integrating into the broader economic and cultural landscape of ancient Nubia. The evidence of cattle burials and the presence of pottery designs reflect a synthesis of local traditions and influences from neighboring cultures, highlighting the dynamic relationships that existed during this period of transformation and trade.

The Nilotic expansion from Central regions of the Sudan like the Gezira into the rest of South Sudan seems to have begun between the 5th-11th centuries. Some of these later migrations coincided with the collapse of the Christian Nubian kingdoms of Makuria and Alodia and the penetration of Arab traders into central Sudan. From the Arabs, the South Sudanese may have obtained new breeds of humpless cattle. Archaeologist Roland Oliver notes that the period also shows an Iron Age beginning among the Nilotic. These factors may explain how the Nilotic speakers expanded to dominate the region.

===Shilluk===

By the 16th century, the most powerful group among the Nilotic speakers were the Cøllø, called Shilluk by Arabs and Europeans, who spread east to the banks of the white Nile under the legendary leadership of Nyikang, who is said to have ruled Läg Cøllø c from around 1490 to 1517. The Cøllø gained control of the west bank of the river as far north as Kosti in Sudan. There they established an economy based on cattle raising, cereal farming, and fishing, with small villages located along the length of the river. The Cøllø developed an intensive system of agriculture. The Cøllø lands in the 17th century had a population density similar to that of the Egyptian Nile lands.

One theory is that pressure from the Cøllø drove the Funj people north, who would establish the Sultanate of Sennar.
The Dinka remained in the Sudd area, maintaining their transhumance economy.

While the Dinka were protected and isolated from their neighbours, the Cøllø were more involved in international affairs. The Cøllø controlled the west bank of the White Nile, but the other side was controlled by the Funj sultanate, with regular conflict between the two. The Cøllø had the ability to quickly raid outside areas by war canoe, and had control of the waters of the Nile. The Funj had a standing army of armoured cavalry, and this force allowed them to dominate the plains of the sahel.

Cøllø traditions tell of Rädh Odak Ocollo who ruled around 1630 and led them in a three-decade war with Sennar over control of the White Nile trade routes. The Cøllø allied with the Sultanate of Darfur and the Kingdom of Takali against the Funj, but the capitulation of Takali ended the war in the Funj&#x27;s favour. In the later 17th century, the Cøllø and Funj allied against the Dinka, who rose to power in the border area between the Funj and Cøllø.

The Cøllø political structure gradually centralized under the a king or &quot;reth&quot;. The most important is Rädh Tugø (son of Rädh Dhøköödhø) who ruled from &quot;circa&quot; 1690 to 1710 and established the Cøllø capital of Fashoda. The same period had the gradual collapse of the Funj sultanate, leaving the Cøllø in complete control of the White Nile and its trade routes. The Cøllø military power was based on control of the river.

===Southern Nilotic settlement in East Africa===

Starting in the mid-19th century, European anthropologists and later Kenyan historians have been interested in the origins of human migration from various parts of Africa into East Africa. One of the more notable broad-based theories emanating from these studies includes the Bantu expansion. The main tools of study have been linguistics, archaeology and oral traditions.

====Oral traditions====
The significance of tracing individual clan histories in order to get an idea of Kalenjin groups formation has been shown by scholars such as B.E. Kipkorir (1978). He argued that the Tugen first settled in small clan groups, fleeing from war, famine, and disease, and that they arrived from western, eastern, and northern sections. Even a section among the Tugen claims to have come from Mount Kenya.

The Nandi account on the settlement of Nandi displays a similar manner of occupation of the Nandi territory. The Kalenjin clans who moved into and occupied the Nandi area, thus becoming the Nandi tribe, came from a wide array of Kalenjin-speaking areas.

Apparently, spatial core areas existed to which people moved and concentrated over the centuries, and in the process evolved into the individual Kalenjin communities known today by adopting migrants and assimilating original inhabitants.

For various reasons, slow and multigenerational migrations of Nilotic Luo peoples occurred from South Sudan into Uganda and western Kenya from at least 1000 AD, and continuing until the early 20th century. Oral history and genealogical evidence have been used to estimate timelines of Luo expansion into and within Kenya and Tanzania. Four major waves of migrations into the former Nyanza province in Kenya are discernible starting with the people of Jok (&quot;Joka Jok&quot;), which is estimated to have begun around 1490–1517.

&quot;Joka Jok&quot; were the first and largest wave of migrants into northern Nyanza. These migrants settled at a place called Ramogi Hill, then expanded around northern Nyanza. The people of Owiny&#x27; (&quot;Jok&#x27;Owiny&quot;) and the people of Omolo (&quot;Jok&#x27;Omolo&quot;) followed soon after (1598-1625).

A miscellaneous group composed of the Suba, Sakwa, Asembo, Uyoma, and Kano then followed. The Suba originally were Bantu-speaking people who assimilated into Luo culture. They fled from the Buganda Kingdom in Uganda after the civil strife that followed the murder of the 24th Kabaka of Buganda in the mid-18th century and settled in South Nyanza, especially at Rusinga and Mfangano islands. Luo speakers crossed Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria from northern Nyanza into South Nyanza starting in the early 17th century.

====Post-colonial traditions====

Several historical narratives from the various Kalenjin subtribes point to Tulwetab/Tulwop Kony (Mount Elgon) as their original point of settlement in Kenya. This point of origin appears as a central theme in most narratives recorded after the colonial period. One of the more famous accounts states:

... The Kalenjin originated from a country in the north known as Emet ab Burgei, which means, the warm country. The people are said to have traveled southwards passing through Mount Elgon or Tulwet ab Kony in Kalenjin. The Sabaot settled around the slopes of the mountain while the others travelled on in search of better land. The Keiyo and Marakwet settled in Kerio Valley and Cherangani Hills. The Pokot settled on the northern side of Mount Elgon and later spread to areas north of Lake Baringo. At Lake Baringo, the Tugen separated from the Nandi and the Kipsigis. This was during a famine known as Kemeutab Reresik, which means, famine of the bats. It is said that during this famine a bat brought blades of green grass which was taken as a sign of good omen signifying that famine could be averted through movement to greener pastures. The Tugen moved and settled around Tugen Hills while the Kipsigis and the Lembus Nandi moved to Rongai area. The Kipsigis and Nandi are said to have lived as a united group for a long time but eventually were forced to separate due to antagonistic environmental factors. Some of these were droughts and invasion of the Maasai from Uasin Gishu.

Geographical barriers protected the southerners from Islam&#x27;s advance, enabling them to retain their social and cultural heritage and their political and religious institutions. The Dinka people were especially secure in the Sudd marshlands, which protected them from outside interference, and allowed them to remain secure without a large armed forces. The Shilluk, Azande, and Bari people had more regular conflicts with neighbouring states

==Culture and religion==
Most Nilotes continue to practice pastoralism, migrating on a seasonal basis with their herds of livestock. Some tribes are also known for a tradition of cattle raiding.

Through lengthy interaction with neighbouring peoples, the Nilotes in East Africa have adopted many customs and practices from Southern Cushitic groups. The latter include the age set system of social organization, circumcision, and vocabulary terms.

In terms of religious beliefs, Nilotes primarily adhere to traditional faiths, Christianity and Islam. The Dinka religion has a pantheon of deities. The Supreme, Creator God is Nhialic, who is the God of the sky and rain, and the ruler of all the spirits.
He is believed to be present in all of creation, and to control the destiny of every human, plant, and animal on Earth. Nhialic is also known as Jaak, Juong, or Dyokin by other Nilotic groups, such as the Nuer and Shilluk. Dengdit or Deng, is the sky God of rain and fertility, empowered by Nhialic.
Deng&#x27;s mother is Abuk, the patron goddess of gardening and all women, represented by a snake. Garang, another deity, is believed or assumed by some Dinka to be a god suppressed by Deng. His spirits can cause most Dinka women, and some men, to scream. The term &quot;Jok&quot; refers to a group of ancestral spirits.

In the Lotuko mythology, the chief God is called Ajok. He is generally seen as kind and benevolent, but can be angered. He once reportedly answered a woman&#x27;s prayer for the resurrection of her son. Her husband, however, was angry and killed the child. According to the Lotuko religion, Ajok was annoyed by the man&#x27;s actions and swore never to resurrect any Lotuko again. As a result, death was said to have become permanent.

==Genetics==
===Y DNA===

A Y-chromosome study by Wood et al. (2005) tested various populations in Africa for paternal lineages, including 26 Maasai and 9 Luo from Kenya, and 9 Alur from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The signature Nilotic paternal marker Haplogroup A3b2 was observed in 27% of the Maasai, 22% of the Alur, and 11% of the Luo.

Haplogroup B is another characteristically Nilotic paternal marker. It was found in 22% of Luo samples, 8% of Maasai, and 50% of Nuer peoples. The E1b1b haplogroup has been observed at overall frequencies around 11% among Nilo-Saharan-speaking groups in the Great Lakes area, with this influence concentrated among the Maasai (50%). This is indicative of substantial historic gene flow from Cushitic-speaking males into these Nilo-Saharan-speaking populations. 67% of the Alur samples possessed the E2 haplogroup.

The Y-DNA of populations in the Sudan region were studied, with various local Nilotic groups included for comparison. The signature Nilotic A and B clades were the most common paternal lineages amongst the Nilo-Saharan speakers, except those inhabiting western Sudan. There, a prominent North African influence was noted.

Haplogroup A was observed amongst 62% of Dinka, 53.3% of Shilluk, 46.4% of Nuba, 33.3% of Nuer, 31.3% of Fur, and 18.8% of Masalit. Haplogroup B was found in 50% of Nuer, 26.7% of Shilluk, 23% of Dinka, 14.3% of Nuba, 3.1% of Fur, and 3.1% of Masalit. The E1b1b clade was also observed in 71.9% of the Masalit, 59.4% of the Fur, 39.3% of the Nuba, 20% of the Shilluk, 16.7% of the Nuer, and 15% of the Dinka. Balemi (2018) found that a sample of 50 Nuer carried e1b1b-M78 (32%), A-M13 (28%), B-M60 (24%) and F-M89 (4%).

Solomon Balemi (2018)
Genetic Study of LCT- Enhancer, Y chromosome and Mitochondrial DNA Variation in Some Ethnic Groups in Ethiopia.

The atypically high frequencies of the haplogroup in the Masalit was attributed to either a recent population bottleneck, which likely altered the community&#x27;s original haplogroup diversity, or to geographical proximity to E1b1b&#x27;s place of origin in North Africa. The clade &quot;might have been brought to Sudan [...] after the progressive desertification of the Sahara around 6,000–8,000 years ago&quot;. Similarly, Afro-Asiatic influence was seen in the Nilotic Datog of northern Tanzania, 43% of whom carried the M293 subclade of E1b1b.

===mtDNA===

Unlike the paternal DNA of Nilotes, the maternal lineages of Nilotes in general show low-to-negligible amounts of Afro-Asiatic and other extraneous influences. An mtDNA study examined the maternal ancestry of various Nilotic populations in Kenya, with Turkana, Samburu, Maasai, and Luo individuals sampled. The mtDNA of almost all of the tested Nilotes belonged to various sub-Saharan macro-haplogroup L subclades, including L0, L2, L3, L4, and L5. Low levels of maternal gene flow from North Africa and the Horn of Africa were observed in a few groups, mainly by the presence of mtDNA haplogroup M and haplogroup I lineages in about 12.5% of the Maasai and 7% of the Samburu samples, respectively.

===Autosomal DNA===
The autosomal DNA of Nilotic peoples has been examined in a study on the genetic clusters of various populations in Africa. According to the researchers, Nilotes generally form their own African genetic cluster, although relatively most closely related to other Nilo-Saharan populations, more distantly followed by Afro-Asiatic speakers and Niger-Congo speakers. The authors also found that certain Nilotic populations in the eastern Great Lakes region, such as the Maasai, showed some additional Afro-Asiatic affinities due to repeated assimilation of Cushitic-speaking peoples over the past 5000 or so years.
Overall, Nilotic people and other Nilo-Saharan groups are closely related to Afro-Asiatic speakers of North and East Africa. Both groups are inferred to have diverged from a common ancestor around 16,000 years ago. Nilotic people and other Nilo-Saharan groups are also closely related to Niger-Congo speakers of West and Central Africa. Both groups are inferred to have diverged from a common ancestor around 28,000 years ago, perhaps somewhere in the Sahel. Most Nilotic peoples have predominant to exclusive West/East African ancestry, although some groups display varying degrees of West-Eurasian admixture, mostly mediated indirectly through pastoralists from the Horn of Africa.

===Admixture analysis===
In 121 African populations, four African American populations, and 60 non-African populations, results indicated a high degree of mixed ancestry reflecting migration events. In East Africa, all population groups examined had elements of Nilotic, Cushitic and Bantu ancestry amongst others to varying degrees. By and large, genetic clusters were consistent with linguistic classification with notable exceptions including the Luo of Kenya. Despite being Nilo-Saharan speakers, the Luo cluster with the Niger-Kordofanian-speaking populations that surround them. This indicates a high degree of admixture occurred during the southward migration of southern Luo. Kalenjin groups and Maasai groups were found to have less Bantu ancestry, but significant Cushitic ancestry.

==Physiology==

Physically, Nilotes are noted for their typically very dark skin color and slender, and occasionally tall bodies. They often possess exceptionally long limbs, particularly their distal segments (fore arms, lower legs). This characteristic is thought to be a climatic adaptation to allow their bodies to shed heat more efficiently.

Sudanese Nilotes are regarded as one of the tallest peoples in the world. Average values of for height and for weight were seen in a sample of Sudanese Shilluk. Another sample of Sudanese Dinka had a stature/weight ratio of and , with an extremely ectomorphic somatotype of 1.6–3.5–6.2.

In terms of facial features, the nasal profile most common amongst Nilotic populations is broad, with characteristically high index values ranging from 86.9 to 92.0. Lower nasal indices are often found amongst Nilotes who inhabit the more southerly Great Lakes region, such as the Maasai, which is attributed to genetic differences.

Additionally, the Nilotic groups presently inhabiting the African Great Lakes region are sometimes smaller in stature than those residing in the Sudan region. Measurements of and were found in a sample of agricultural Turkana in northern Kenya, and of and in pastoral Turkana. A height of was seen for Maasai in southern Kenya, with an extreme trunk/leg length ratio of 47.7.

Many Nilotic groups excel in long- and middle-distance running. This sporting prowess may be related to their exceptional running economy, a function of slim body morphology and very long, slender legs (particularly lower legs, i.e., calf muscles and ankles.). For 404 elite Kenyan distance runners, 76% of the international-class respondents identified as part of the Kalenjin ethnic group and 79% spoke a Nilotic language.

<doc id="67055" wikidata="Q180704" url="?curid=67055" title="Iron Man">
<text>Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #39 in 1962 (cover dated March 1963) and received his own title with &quot;Iron Man&quot; #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team, the Avengers, alongside Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since the character&#x27;s creation.

Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward &quot;Tony&quot; Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs the weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. When Stark was captured in a war zone and sustained a severe heart wound, he built his Iron Man armor and escaped his captors. Iron Man&#x27;s suits of armor grant him superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and other abilities. The character was created in response to the Vietnam War as Lee&#x27;s attempt to create a likeable pro-war character. Since his creation, Iron Man has been used to explore political themes, with early Iron Man stories being set in the Cold War. The character&#x27;s role as a weapons manufacturer proved controversial, and Marvel moved away from geopolitics by the 1970s. Instead, the stories began exploring themes such as civil unrest, technological advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.

Major Iron Man stories include &quot;Demon in a Bottle&quot; (1979), &quot;Armor Wars&quot; (1987–1988), &quot;Extremis&quot; (2005), and &quot;Iron Man 2020&quot; (2020). He is also a leading character in the company-wide stories &quot;Civil War&quot; (2006–2007), &quot;Dark Reign&quot; (2008–2009), and &quot;Civil War II&quot; (2016). Additional superhero characters have emerged from Iron Man&#x27;s supporting cast, including James Rhodes as War Machine and Riri Williams as Ironheart, as well as reformed villains, Natasha Romanova as Black Widow and Clint Barton as Hawkeye. Iron Man&#x27;s list of enemies includes his archenemy, the Mandarin, various supervillains of communist origin, and many of Stark&#x27;s business rivals.

Robert Downey Jr. portrayed Tony Stark in &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008), the first film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and continued to portray the character until his final appearance in &quot;&quot; (2019). Downey&#x27;s portrayal popularized the character, elevating Iron Man into one of Marvel&#x27;s most recognizable superheroes. Other adaptations of the character appear in animated direct-to-video films, television series, and video games.

==Publication history==
===Creation===

Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of American comic books featuring superheroes, Marvel Comics created new superhero characters. Stan Lee developed the initial concept for Iron Man. He wanted to design a character who should be unpalatable to his generally anti-war readers but to make them like the character anyway. Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent arms industry developed in the United States, and this was incorporated into the character&#x27;s backstory. The character was introduced as an active player in the Vietnam War. Lee described the national mood toward Vietnam during Iron Man&#x27;s creation as &quot;a time when most of us genuinely felt that the conflict in that tortured land really was a simple matter of good versus evil&quot;.

Larry Lieber developed Iron Man&#x27;s origin and wrote the first Iron Man story, while Jack Kirby and Don Heck were responsible for the initial design. Lee modeled Iron Man after businessman Howard Hughes, invoking his physical appearance, his image as a businessman, and his reputation as an arrogant playboy. Kirby and Heck then incorporated elements of the actor Errol Flynn&#x27;s physical appearance in the design. When first designing the character, Lee wanted to create a modernized Arthurian knight. Kirby initially drew the Iron Man armor as a &quot;round and clunky gray heap&quot;, and Heck modified the design to incorporate gadgets such as jets, drills, and suction cups. The Iron Man character was created at a time when comic book characters were first depicted struggling with real-life problems, and his heart injury was an early example of a superhero with a physical disability.

===Early years===
Iron Man&#x27;s earliest stories were published in the monster-themed anthology series &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot;. Marvel premiered several superheroes this way in the 1960s as superhero comics became more popular than traditional science-fiction and horror comics. Iron Man&#x27;s first appearance, &quot;Iron Man is Born!&quot;, appeared in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #39, released in December 1962 with a March 1963 cover date. Though the Iron Man armor was gray in its first appearance, Marvel changed it to gold because of issues with printing. Lee initially delegated the writing duties to other creators at Marvel, but he felt their work was substandard; as with his other characters, Lee reclaimed control of Iron Man so he could write the stories himself.

Once Marvel&#x27;s distributor allowed the company more monthly releases, &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1963) was developed as a new comic book series. Iron Man was one of the five characters who formed the titular superhero team. By 1965, the difficulty of maintaining continuity between &quot;The Avengers&quot; and the members&#x27; solo titles prompted Lee to temporarily write the original cast out of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, including Iron Man.

Heck continued as the primary Iron Man artist until 1965, as Kirby had obligations to other Marvel properties. As part of a shuffling to match artists with the characters they were most suited for, Steve Ditko briefly became the artist for Iron Man. He was responsible for only three issues in late 1963, but in this time he redesigned Iron Man&#x27;s suit from fully gold to the red and gold color scheme that became the character&#x27;s primary image. Iron Man&#x27;s recurring nemesis, the Mandarin, first appeared shortly after in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #50 (1964). By this time, the science-fiction and horror stories were phased out from &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot;, and the series ran only Iron Man and Captain America stories. Gene Colan became the artist for Iron Man in January 1966, bringing with him an expressionist style.

For the first five years of publication, Iron Man represented the United States in Cold War allegories. Growing opposition to the American involvement in Vietnam prompted a shift in Iron Man&#x27;s characterization, which was part of a larger push by Marvel in the late 1960s to be more apolitical. Over the years, the letters to the editor column in several issues saw extensive political debate. Lee shifted the stories&#x27; focus to espionage and domestic crime, incorporating Marvel&#x27;s fictional intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D. He also incorporated the villains of other Marvel heroes, avoiding Iron Man&#x27;s primarily communist rogues&#x27; gallery and rewriting some of Iron Man&#x27;s communist villains to have personal motivations independent of their communist allegiances.

Iron Man was one of several characters whom Marvel gave a full-length dedicated series in 1968. Marvel combined the final issues of &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; and the Sub-Mariner&#x27;s &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; into a one-shot special, &quot;Iron Man and Sub-Mariner&quot;. &quot;Iron Man&quot; then began its run under writer Archie Goodwin. Goodwin reintroduced political themes slowly over the following years, with a focus on domestic issues like racial conflict and environmentalism rather than geopolitics. George Tuska started illustrating the character in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #5 (1968) and intermittently served as artist for much of the 1970s. In total, he drew over one hundred issues for the character.

===1970s===

When Goodwin became Marvel&#x27;s editor-in-chief, he assigned Gerry Conway as the writer for &quot;Iron Man&quot;. Conway was the first of several writers in a four-year effort to reform Iron Man, beginning in 1971, with stories that directly addressed the character&#x27;s history as a weapons manufacturer. These stories were especially prominent during a run by Mike Friedrich, in which corporate reform of Stark Industries was a recurring subplot.

Iron Man was one of several Marvel characters who declined in popularity during the 1970s, and the series went a period of time without a dedicated writer until Bill Mantlo took over in 1977. The following year, David Michelinie and Bob Layton took charge of the series, beginning with issue #116. While inking the series, Layton used issues of &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, and electronics catalogues as visual references, which he and Michelinie used to stay informed on developments in real world technology so the Iron Man armor would always be a more advanced version of what existed. Layton was inspired by the vast collection of specialized outfits used by Batman when designing Iron Man&#x27;s various armors.

In &quot;Iron Man&quot; #117 and #118 (1978), Michelinie and Layton replaced many elements that developed over the series&#x27; run: they removed Iron Man&#x27;s romantic interest Whitney Frost and Stark&#x27;s robotic Life Model Decoy doubles, and they had Stark move to a different home. They introduced Iron Man&#x27;s new romantic interest, Bethany Cabe, as a feminist character who worked as his bodyguard. Their goal was to push the character toward a more grounded, realistic portrayal. The largest change they made was to make Iron Man an alcoholic, an unprecedented move for a major comic book hero, which led to the &quot;Demon in a Bottle&quot; story arc that ran from issues #120 to #128 (1979). At the same time, they introduced the character Justin Hammer, who provided financial backing for several Iron Man villains.

===1980s and 1990s===
Michelinie and Layton remained on the series until &quot;Iron Man&quot; #153 (1981). Michelinie later said, &quot;The reason I quit is that we felt we&#x27;d done everything with it that we&#x27;d set out to do.&quot; Through the 1980s, writers for Iron Man focused on the character&#x27;s role as a businessman, reflecting the economic changes associated with Reaganomics, and many of his challenges involved threats to his company. Denny O&#x27;Neil was put in charge of &quot;Iron Man&quot; beginning with issue #158 (1982). His run explored Stark&#x27;s psychology, having him relapse into alcoholism and suffer at the hands of business rival Obadiah Stane. O&#x27;Neil wrote Stark out of the role entirely beginning with issue #170 (1983), having him temporarily retire as Iron Man and replacing him with his ally James Rhodes. Stark was relegated as a side character until he returned to heroism in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #200 (1985).

The 1987 &quot;Armor Wars&quot; story arc followed Iron Man as he reclaimed his technology, which Justin Hammer distributed to several villains. This story blended the character&#x27;s superhero and businessman aspects more directly when Stark sought legal recourse against his rivals. Michelinie and Layton returned to the series with issue #215 (1988) through issue #232 (1989). Again, they experimented with variations on the Iron Man armor and focused on down to Earth stories with realistic situations.

In 1990, Michelinie and Layton handed the series over to John Byrne, one of the most highly regarded comic book writers at the time. He wrote three story arcs across 20 issues: &quot;Armor Wars II&quot; (which had already been announced by Michelinie and Layton), &quot;The Dragon Seed Saga&quot;, and &quot;War Games&quot;. Byrne revisited Iron Man&#x27;s opposition to communism but portrayed it as less of a threat, and he rewrote Iron Man&#x27;s origin to remove references to communism and the Vietnam War. He lost interest in the series by 1992 as his collaborators John Romita Jr. and Howard Mackie had moved on to other projects. Iron Man&#x27;s supporting character War Machine was spun off into his own comic book series in 1994.

The &quot;Iron Man&quot; series rejected broader ideological themes by the 1990s, and individualist values replaced Stark&#x27;s allegiance to American democracy for its own sake. He remained anti-communist, reiterating his support for democracy and refusing to do business in China following the Tiannamen Square Massacre in 1989. The absence of Cold War politics was not immediately replaced by another theme, and post-Cold War Iron Man stories often explored different ideas regarding technology for a short time before moving on. When terrorism became more prominent in the public mind, writers shifted Iron Man&#x27;s symbolism from anti-communism to anti-terrorism.

As part of a company-wide reorganization in 1996, Marvel&#x27;s major characters, including Iron Man, were given to former Marvel writers Jim Lee and Rob Liefeld in a profit-sharing agreement. Lee and Liefeld were given charge of the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; branding that renumbered Marvel&#x27;s long-running periodicals at issue #1. This new &quot;Iron Man&quot; series, labeled volume two, was set in an alternate universe created during the &quot;Onslaught&quot; event. It ran for 13 issues, written by Lee and Scott Lobdell and illustrated by Whilce Portacio. The following year, Marvel introduced the &quot;Heroes Return&quot; event to bring the characters back from the alternate universe, which again reset characters such as Iron Man to issue #1. Kurt Busiek became the writer for volume three while Sean Chen was the artist.

===2000s===
When the Ultimate Marvel imprint was created with reimagined versions of Marvel&#x27;s characters, an alternate Iron Man appeared in 2002 with the Ultimates, the imprint&#x27;s adaptation of the Avengers. Marvel released a five-issue limited series, &quot;Ultimate Iron Man&quot;, featuring this character in 2005.

Iron Man represented an attempt to define what a superhero was in the 21st century, following the September 11 attacks, implicitly likening the fear of terrorism to the fear of unregulated super-powered beings. In 2004, Iron Man was a major character in the &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot; event and subsequently became a founding member of the New Avengers. &quot;Iron Man&quot; volume four began in 2005, with Warren Ellis as the writer and Adi Granov as the artist. Its first story arc, &quot;Extremis&quot;, saw Iron Man upgrade his body directly through the Extremis virus, giving him direct control over a biological armor. The volume&#x27;s first 14 issues carried the &quot;Iron Man&quot; title, while issues #15–32 (2007–2008) were titled &quot;Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;

Iron Man led the pro-registration faction during the 2006 &quot;Civil War&quot; crossover event by Mark Millar and Steve McNiven. In an allegory for the Patriot Act and government surveillance, Iron Man&#x27;s pro-registration faction represented conservative support for government surveillance in the name of security and stood against Captain America&#x27;s anti-registration faction that represented individualism and liberal opposition to government surveillance. Iron Man believed in pragmatically choosing the lesser of two evils, whereas Captain America held an idealist approach, and both held these positions at great personal cost. While Marvel was neutral between the characters, readers overwhelmingly saw Iron Man as the villain, being the stronger force that the underdog had to overcome.

Iron Man appeared with the Mighty Avengers in 2007, and his characterization in this era leaned into his identity as a futurist. Marvel restarted Iron Man&#x27;s comic book run with &quot;Invincible Iron Man&quot; in 2008, written by Matt Fraction and illustrated by Salvador Larroca. This series launched around the same time as the film &quot;Iron Man&quot; premiered, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe developed while this run was in publication.

=== 2010s and 2020s ===
The &quot;Iron Man&quot; series reverted to the original numbering in 2011, when the overall 500th issue was published as &quot;Iron Man&quot; #500. A concurrent series, &quot;Iron Man Legacy&quot; by Fred Van Lente, was launched in 2010 leading up to the release of the film &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;. Iron Man was then one of several characters whose series was relaunched at issue #1 with the Marvel Now! branding following the 2012 &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; event, written by Kieron Gillen. The 2014 &quot;AXIS&quot; event led into the &quot;Superior Iron Man&quot; series by Tom Taylor, featuring Iron Man with a new reversed personality.
A new &quot;Invincible Iron Man&quot; run written by Brian Michael Bendis and illustrated by David Marquez began in 2015. A simultaneous Iron Man series, &quot;International Iron Man&quot;, ran for seven issues in 2016 under Marvel&#x27;s &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; branding, also by Bendis. This series was meant to ensure Iron Man&#x27;s status as a major character as &quot;All-New, All-Different&quot; developed. A second &quot;Civil War&quot; event in 2016 portrayed Iron Man as an advocate of free will against Captain Marvel&#x27;s determinism.

As part of a broader trend by Marvel Comics to substitute its main characters with a diverse cast of original characters in the 2010s, Iron Man was temporarily replaced by Ironheart, a teenaged African-American girl who reverse-engineered the Iron Man armor, in 2016. At the same time, the series &quot;Infamous Iron Man&quot; began publication with Doctor Doom as Iron Man.

The series &quot;Tony Stark: Iron Man&quot; premiered in 2018 with the Fresh Start branding, written by Dan Slott and illustrated by Valerio Schiti. In 2020, Iron Man was relaunched in a new series, written by Christopher Cantwell and illustrated by CAFU, following the &quot;Iron Man 2020&quot; event. This series moved away from the developments and deviations made to Stark&#x27;s character introduced over the previous years—including the more extravagant science fiction and soap opera plots—creating a clean slate for new story arcs in a traditional superhero setting. The character was relaunched again in 2022 with &quot;Invincible Iron Man&quot;, written by Gerry Duggan and illustrated by Juan Frigeri. A new volume was launched in October 2024, written by Spencer Ackerman and illustrated by Julius Ohta.
==Characterization==
===Fictional character biography===

Anthony Edward &quot;Tony&quot; Stark was born in Long Island, New York. As a child, he inherited his family&#x27;s business, Stark Industries when his parents were killed in a car crash. Developing equipment for the U.S. military, he travels to a war zone to conduct a weapons test when he triggers a booby trap. His heart is critically injured by shrapnel, and he is captured by the communist Wong-Chu, who demands Stark build him a weapon. Stark instead builds a suit of armor that sustains his heart, becoming Iron Man. The war zone Stark visited was changed retroactively multiple times by different writers to correspond with the character&#x27;s age, which is explained by a &quot;sliding scale of continuity&quot; in which the timing of significant events in the world of Marvel may change. This conflict was the Vietnam War for the first decades of Iron Man&#x27;s publication history. This was changed to an unnamed Southeast Asian country in the 1990s, and a conflict in the fictional country Siancong was ultimately created to justify the inconsistency.

Iron Man returns to the United States and becomes a superhero, convincing the public Iron Man is Stark&#x27;s bodyguard. When he is called to stop the Hulk and learns Loki is behind the Hulk&#x27;s attack, he joins forces with the Hulk, Thor, Ant-Man, and the Wasp to defeat Loki, and they agree to form a superhero team, the Avengers. He also helps found the intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D., providing the organization with equipment. Iron Man then undergoes surgery to replace the damaged portions of his heart, eliminating the need for his prosthetic chest plate. As he came to regret his involvement in weapons manufacturing, Stark Industries is changed to Stark International, an electronics company that emphasizes environmentalism and ending world hunger. S.H.I.E.L.D. attempts to take over the business and return it to weapons manufacturing. At the same time, Iron Man is framed for murder. These stresses cause him to begin drinking, and he develops alcoholism. Though he gets sober, he relapses due to a plot orchestrated by his business rival Obadiah Stane. Iron Man briefly loses his company to Stane, passes the Iron Man mantle to his ally James Rhodes, and becomes homeless. After Stark recovers, Stane adopts an armored suit and becomes the Iron Monger before being defeated. Iron Man then founds a space technology company, Stark Enterprises. When Iron Man learns Justin Hammer had acquired the Iron Man armor&#x27;s technology, he seeks out all the other armors. The resulting fights leave Iron Man a fugitive, leading him to fake his death and then describe himself as a new Iron Man.

When Iron Man is shot in the spine and paralyzed, he develops a new prosthesis that grants him mobility. This prosthesis is hacked and controlled remotely, causing neurological damage that appears for a time to kill him. Rhodes temporarily becomes Stark&#x27;s chosen successor as Iron Man. After returning, Immortus places Stark under his control and turns him evil. The Avengers bring an alternate Tony Stark from another reality to help defeat him. Iron Man is killed and the alternate Tony Stark becomes the new Iron Man, but Franklin Richards merges both versions into a single being when he rewrites reality. Stark&#x27;s company was bought out at this point, so he started a consulting firm, Stark Solutions. His secret identity is revealed to the public shortly afterwards. He is then appointed Secretary of Defense until the Scarlet Witch alters his mind, causing him to behave drunkenly at the United Nations and leave in disgrace. When Mallen becomes a threat through the Extremis project, Iron Man has Maya Hansen inject him with the Extremis virus, giving him a biological armor he can control with his mind.

Iron Man serves as the Superhero Registration Act&#x27;s enforcer upon its enactment, creating a schism between superheroes, with Iron Man leading proponents of registration against a group of resistors led by Captain America. After the conflict, Iron Man becomes head of S.H.I.E.L.D. The government dismantles S.H.I.E.L.D. after it fails to prevent an alien invasion, but Iron Man refuses to turn over the list of registered heroes to its corrupt successor agency H.A.M.M.E.R. This agency is dismantled as well, and Iron Man organizes the Avengers to replace these agencies. He founds a clean energy company, Stark Resilient, and fakes his death so his enemies will not threaten it. He joins the Guardians of the Galaxy for a time, and upon returning to Earth, he discovers he had actually been adopted by the Starks so their biological son could be hidden from an alien threat.

While fighting Red Skull, a spell cast by Victor von Doom and the Scarlet Witch temporarily inverts the personalities of several heroes. The new morally corrupt Iron Man protects himself from the counterspell and takes over San Francisco to augment the residents with Extremis. When a man is discovered who can see the future, the superhero community undergoes another schism, and Iron Man leads a team of heroes opposed to a predetermined justice system based on his ability. The battle ends with Iron Man in a coma. A reformed Victor von Doom becomes Iron Man, while an artificial intelligence backup of Stark&#x27;s mind guides a new armored superhero, Ironheart. Stark resumes his work as Iron Man after the technology in his body allows him to heal. He then allies with Emma Frost and marries her to set a trap for their mutual enemy Feilong.

===Personality and motivations===

Iron Man is a businessman and entrepreneur who seeks to innovate and improve his technology, both for society&#x27;s benefit and his own. Iron Man is one of many Marvel heroes with a genius-level intellect, but his focus on societal application alongside hard science distinguishes him from other heroes. The character is a futurist, and he works to identify solutions for problems that have yet to emerge. This preemptive problem-solving was a driving force in his organization of the Avengers and later in his support for the Superhero Registration Act during the &quot;Civil War&quot; event.

Stark&#x27;s intelligence and engineering skills allowed him to construct the Iron Man armor, and he believes this justifies his authority over the armor and who uses it. While Iron Man sometimes develops equipment for other superheroes, he is selective about who can use the armor, trusting only a few close allies. In the 2008 story &quot;The Five Nightmares&quot;, Iron Man narrates his five greatest fears: relapse into alcoholism, reproduction of the Iron Man technology, other people becoming Iron Man, the technology becoming disposable, and that someone else would be distributing this technology. Besides the danger such scenarios pose, they all represent fear of losing power over himself or his technology.

Iron Man finds machines easier to interact with than humans, believing machines can be more easily controlled and repaired. This leads him to engage in self-destructive behavior, giving his relationships as Tony Stark lower priority and failing to be accountable for his creations as Iron Man. His isolation comes to him from two directions, with both his celebrity status and his role as Iron Man making personal relationships difficult. Through both poor decisions and bad luck, he is unable to maintain romantic relationships despite his wealth and talents. Writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil described the Iron Man armor as &quot;a psychological crutch preventing him from dealing with his own inner demons&quot;. He identifies with the Iron Man armor as an extension of himself, believing the image it presents is his own image, and he considers himself responsible any time someone uses the technology.

Iron Man behaves differently as a superhero and as a civilian, engaging in courageous and selfless acts as Iron Man but morally ambiguous behavior as Stark. The character represents a traditional understanding of American masculinity as a businessman and a playboy, particularly as it was seen in the Cold War. This characterization also manifests in negative traits that were prominent in early Iron Man stories, including belligerence, negligence, and misogyny. Stark has several character flaws emerging from his impulsivity and arrogance, engaging in vices that include excessive drinking, partying, and womanizing.

Iron Man&#x27;s heart injury was prominent in his early characterization, causing him to isolate himself so as not to reveal his injury or his secret identity. This weakness was a threat to his autonomy and his masculinity. As real-world medical technology made heart injuries less fatal, writers introduced neurological damage and alcoholism as other medical weaknesses. Despite this, Iron Man considers himself lucky and believes he lives &quot;a good life&quot;, attributing this to his money, friendships, engineering skills, and recovering health.

Iron Man&#x27;s belief in progress sometimes manifests as opposition to the press and politicians, whose attempts to keep him accountable hamper his efforts as a superhero. He is conflicted between his support for the rule of law and his moral beliefs in doing what he feels must be done for the greater good. When he engages in unsanctioned attacks against those who co-opted his technology in the &quot;Armor Wars&quot; story, he describes it as &quot;a tough decision; perhaps the toughest in my life&quot;. The character&#x27;s morally ambiguous nature can make him more accessible to readers relative to other superheroes who are more inherently virtuous.

== Themes and motifs ==
=== Politics and economics ===
Iron Man was more overtly political than other Silver Age Marvel characters. Lee wrote the character to represent liberal capitalism, fighting against communism and other anti-democratic forces. Though anti-communist sentiments were present throughout Marvel Comics, they appeared most prominently in Iron Man stories. After Marvel shifted away from addressing foreign conflicts toward the end of the 1960s, Iron Man was portrayed as a liberal who was skeptical of the U.S. government, yet also opposed radicalism; at the time associated with 1960s counterculture. Marvel portrayed Iron Man as more self-doubting, questioning when the use of force is justified against communism. By 1975, Iron Man opposed the Vietnam War, which gave the character a new motivation in making up for his promotion of violence in the past. Iron Man&#x27;s use of his vast resources as a protector was reframed as a cautionary tale, in which these resources could be co-opted to do harm. His motivation for providing weapons to the government was retroactively changed so Stark only got involved because he believed it would end the war more quickly. Over time, writers portrayed Iron Man as a philanthropist.

The dual role of Iron Man and Tony Stark allows for the examination of both the perspective of an individual inventor and that of the bureaucracy of governments and corporations, respectively. His business Stark Industries is depicted as a force for good that advances scientific knowledge through capitalist innovation. The Iron Man persona itself, as well as the technology Iron Man uses, are proprietary assets owned by Stark Industries. Reflecting his characterization as a businessman, Iron Man stories often invoke themes of economic competition, seeing him face characters who try to develop better versions of the Iron Man armor. Many of Iron Man&#x27;s challenges involve corrupt business rivals and corporate espionage.

=== Technology ===
Technology and its influence on society are common themes in Iron Man stories, and various writers have portrayed him as a technological marvel since his earliest appearances. The character&#x27;s use of technology, both as a weapons manufacturer and as Iron Man, explores problems that arise from progress and advancement, including misuse of technology and the implications of cybernetics. Iron Man&#x27;s position within the suit allows for discussion regarding automation versus human oversight of technology, and it reflects the debate on how new technologies are incorporated into public and military use, including the use of exoskeletons and battle suits. These technological themes are explored through a modern lens during the &quot;Extremis&quot; story arc, which incorporates the idea of human enhancement through biotechnology.

Depictions of technology in Iron Man stories have often endorsed its use to alter the natural world. This is in contrast with Silver Age Marvel stories, where radiation and other technological advancements were portrayed as dangerous. Iron Man&#x27;s engineering talent is key to his heroism, unlike other heroes who use engineering to supplement superhuman abilities. This makes it more plausible that something like Iron Man could exist in the real world, as it is only technological advancement that separates Iron Man from reality. Iron Man&#x27;s power of flight is especially significant in the technology&#x27;s symbolism, as it associates traditional heroic imagery with a technological component, giving this power to a man who created it himself in a transcendental fashion.

=== Armor ===
Iron Man does not have any superhuman abilities. Instead, he derives his strength from a powered armor of his own design. The armor is equipped with various weapons, which include &quot;repulsor rays&quot; in each palm that project particle beams as well as a stronger &quot;unibeam&quot; on his chest. As of 2010, Marvel described Iron Man&#x27;s armor as being able to lift 100 tons and to fly at Mach 8.

Marvel initially depicted the armor as powered by transistors, but this was replaced with integrated circuits as real-world technology advanced. New designs have further miniaturized the technology, ultimately incorporating nanotechnology. Developments in the armor&#x27;s design often reflect real-world advances in technology and trends in science fiction. The changing nature of the armor allows artists to make frequent changes to the character&#x27;s appearance without controversy. Iron Man has also created specialized models for specific purposes, including space armor, stealth armor, and deep sea armor, as well as the Hulkbuster armor to engage in combat with the Hulk.

Prior to Iron Man&#x27;s surgery, the armor&#x27;s primary function was to produce a magnetic field that protected his heart from the shrapnel in his body. His efforts to keep it charged and to keep it secret drove the story&#x27;s plot. From its first appearance, Stark has controlled the armor by linking it to his brainwaves, and he must calibrate it to any allies who use it. The armor is often shown to have some method of shrinking it down to make it portable when not being used.

Iron Man stories contrast the armor&#x27;s strength and the vulnerability of the human inside it. The armor protects Iron Man externally from attacks, but it also protected him internally when it kept his heart beating. The form-fitting design of many Iron Man armors emphasizes this with a human figure in an otherwise robotic-looking character.

During the &quot;Extremis&quot; story arc, Iron Man adopted a biotechnological armor embedded in his DNA and stored in his bones. This allowed him to summon the armor from within his body and control it with his mind, effectively giving him superhuman abilities. This reduced the input lag between his brain and his armor, allowed him to mentally interface with any technology in the world, and gave him the focus to engage in several unrelated tasks at once. The Extremis technology also converted Iron Man&#x27;s mind into a digital storage device to create a back up of his memories. It also presented a weakness, as Iron Man&#x27;s archnemesis Mandarin was able to access and manipulate the data. Iron Man gave up the Extremis armor after it was compromised with a computer virus by the Skrulls, who used it to disable Earth&#x27;s defenses during an invasion.

== Supporting characters ==
=== Allies ===

Pepper Potts is a Stark Industries employee who Stark promoted to his executive assistant. The original portrayal of the character was that of a simple love interest and damsel in distress. She came to manage the business herself, as Stark had little interest in his responsibilities. When Stark became Iron Man and took responsibility for his company, she taught him how to manage the business. When Pepper was injured by an explosion and received a heart injury similar to Iron Man&#x27;s, he installed the arc reactor technology in her. She eventually became the CEO of Stark Industries. Iron Man secretly worked on a suit of armor to be powered by her arc reactor, and she discovered it in a Stark Industries lab while she had control of the company. Taking the armor, she became the superhero Rescue.

James Rhodes was an employee of Stark&#x27;s. He first appeared in 1979 and was developed as a supporting character in 1981. He briefly became Iron Man while Stark was relapsing on alcoholism. Later on, when Stark was near death, he gave Rhodes his corporation and the War Machine armor. Stark let Rhodes keep the armor, and Rhodes became the superhero War Machine. Rhodes&#x27; dependency on Iron Man for his armor often constrains him as a supporting character to Stark, even in solo War Machine stories.

Happy Hogan was hired as Stark&#x27;s chauffeur after saving his life, and Happy later deduced Stark was Iron Man. Iron Man has other allies through his affiliation with the Avengers, including close personal relationships with Captain America, Ant-Man, and the Wasp. As Tony Stark, he is the benefactor of the Avengers, providing their headquarters at Avengers Mansion. Stark&#x27;s butler, Edwin Jarvis, works for both Iron Man and the Avengers. During a period without Pepper, Stark hired a new secretary, Mrs. Arbogast. Iron Man is also supported by his artificial intelligence companions Jocasta and F.R.I.D.A.Y. His association with S.H.I.E.L.D. sees him working with its agents and leadership, including Nick Fury and Maria Hill. He has taken on other heroes as sidekicks, including Spider-Man and Jack of Hearts.

Other characters in the Marvel Universe have taken up the Iron Man mantle besides Stark, including James Rhodes and Victor von Doom. The Iron Man armor itself came to life in the &quot;Mask in the Iron Man&quot; storyline, becoming violent before sacrificing itself to save Stark&#x27;s life.

=== Romantic interests ===
Iron Man has had many romantic interests, most of which only last a short time. In the original &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; run, Lee established a love triangle in which Stark and Happy were both romantically interested in Pepper. Happy eventually married Pepper. The series then introduced Roxie Gilbert, the sister of the villain Firebrand, as a romantic interest in the early 1970s. She was a foil for both Iron Man and Firebrand, representing non-violent activism.

The women associated with Iron Man became more independent as second-wave feminism encouraged Marvel&#x27;s writers to create stronger female characters. Whitney Frost was Iron Man&#x27;s romantic interest later in the 1970s until she turned against him as the villain Madame Masque. Bethany Cabe became Stark&#x27;s love interest in 1978 as part of an overhaul of Iron Man&#x27;s supporting cast, and she supported him during his period of alcoholism. Michelinie chose to remove Pepper as a love interest in favor of Cabe because he felt that Iron Man would be more interested in a strong woman. She left Iron Man after he saved her husband, who was presumed dead.

Stark was seduced by Indries Moomji, who was hired by Obadiah Stane to help ruin Stark, first appearing in issue #163 (1982). He later partnered with Rumiko Fujikawa, the daughter of a businessman who took over Stark Enterprises. Stark also began a relationship with his long time ally Janet van Dyne, the Wasp, whom he had briefly dated in the past before she learned he was Iron Man. A story arc in September 2023 saw Iron Man married to X-Men member Emma Frost as part of a plan to defeat the villain Feilong.

=== Villains ===

Iron Man&#x27;s earliest villains were often affiliated with the Soviet government or otherwise associated with communism. In the first three years after Iron Man was created, one-third of his villains were communists. Some of these enemies were Soviet counterparts of Iron Man, such as Titanium Man and Crimson Dynamo, while others held leadership positions in communist states, such as the Red Barbarian and the real-life Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Khrushchev, like most communists in the series, was drawn in caricature style as a brute who only sought power. Multiple communist villains, such as Crimson Dynamo, reformed and became heroes loyal to the United States to present Iron Man and liberal capitalism as more appealing and morally superior. Two prominent Marvel heroes, Soviet spy Black Widow and American street criminal Hawkeye, were introduced as Iron Man villains before reforming as heroes.

Marvel introduced the Mandarin as a Chinese villain, incorporating racist Yellow Peril themes and stereotypes regarding China. Though he is an allegory for autocracy, the Mandarin was not created as another communist villain. Instead, any work he does with the Chinese government is purely in self-interest. Later on, the Mandarin was retroactively established as the man behind the kidnapping that created Iron Man. The Mandarin contrasts with Iron Man through his association with magic and mysticism instead of science and technology, and because he was born into nobility unlike Iron Man, who is a self-made man in line with American ideals.

Beginning in the 1970s, Iron Man faced villains who represented social conflict and unrest, such as the anarchist Firebrand and the corrupt businessman Guardsman. He also faced villains representing concerns about technology, such as Ultimo. Stark&#x27;s business pursuits have invited several supervillains who oppose Stark Industries instead of just Iron Man. These villains became prominent in the 1980s, and they were amplified by backlash to consumerism that emerged in the 1990s. Some of these villains wish to compete with the corporation and steal trade secrets, such as Spymaster, Whiplash, and Beetle. Others oppose the corporation on ideological grounds, such as Atom-Smasher.

Tony Stark&#x27;s chief business rival is Obadiah Stane. Stark&#x27;s application of business as an altruistic pursuit is contrasted with Stane&#x27;s application as a selfish pursuit. Justin Hammer was introduced as another businessman to be Tony Stark&#x27;s antithesis. Unlike Stark, Hammer avoids public attention and provides equipment for other villains instead of using it himself. Other major villains include Shockwave, the Controller, the Mauler, and Stilt-Man. A focus on terrorism introduced villains such as Zeke Stane, the son of Obadiah Stane who carried out terrorist attacks using suicide bombers.

=== Alternate versions ===
Other versions of Iron Man exist in other universes as part of Marvel&#x27;s multiverse. In the Ultimate Universe, an alternate version of Iron Man exists as a member of the Ultimates, the universe&#x27;s counterpart of the Avengers. Iron Man 2020 is the superhero persona of Tony&#x27;s cousin-once-removed Arno Stark, who is from an alternate future in which superheroes vanished in the 1980s. After becoming Iron Man, Arno traveled back in time to the primary Marvel Universe.

== Reception and legacy ==
Iron Man&#x27;s appearances in the 1960s saw mixed reception from readers, many of whom criticized the character for his association with the United States military and the controversial Vietnam War. In response, Marvel rewrote the character in the 1970s to moderate his image and to have him directly reflect on his culpability in the harms caused by war. According to Lee, Iron Man was the most popular hero when reading fanmail from female readers, which he attributed to both the character&#x27;s charisma and his tragic nature.

Many stories featuring the character have achieved critical acclaim. &quot;Demon in a Bottle&quot; in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #120–129 (1979) is celebrated as the definitive Iron Man story for exploring the depth of his character through his alcoholism. &quot;Doomquest&quot; in #149–150 (1981) is a popular favorite for its lighter tone and its establishment of a rivalry between Iron Man and Doctor Doom. &quot;Armor Wars&quot; in #225–232 (1987–1988) is credited for developing Iron Man&#x27;s personality as someone willing to be more aggressive at the expense of his alliances and public trust. &quot;Extremis&quot; in &quot;Iron Man&quot; Vol. 4 #1–6 (2005–2006) is recognized as a landmark for a new modern era of Iron Man comics. Other celebrated stories include &quot;Deliverance&quot; in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #182 (1984), the &quot;Iron Monger Saga&quot; in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #190–200 (1984–1985), and &quot;World&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; in &quot;Invincible Iron Man&quot; #8–19 (2009). Iron Man&#x27;s characterization in &quot;Civil War&quot; (2006–2007) was received negatively, with most readers seeing him as the villain.

Iron Man became widely popular following the success of the 2008 film &quot;Iron Man&quot;, which made him one of Marvel&#x27;s most recognizable characters, and the film is credited with redefining the superhero film genre. Since then, many publishers have listed Iron Man among the top ten in lists of best superheroes and best Marvel characters. Iron Man&#x27;s portrayal of futuristic technology has affected public image of how these technologies may develop. Heavy use of augmented reality interfaces by Iron Man, in his helmet&#x27;s heads-up display and elsewhere, has informed public awareness of the technology. In 2019, a statue representing the character in his Iron Man armor was erected in Forte dei Marmi, Italy, to memorialize the character&#x27;s actions in &quot;&quot; (2019) and as a reminder that &quot;the future of humanity depends on our decisions ... that all of us must be heroes!&quot;.

==In other media==

In 2008, a film adaptation titled &quot;Iron Man&quot; was released, starring Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and directed by Jon Favreau. &quot;Iron Man&quot; was met with positive reviews from film critics, grossing $318 million domestically and $585 million worldwide, and became the first in the long-running Marvel Cinematic Universe. Downey&#x27;s casting was praised, as was his portrayal of the character; Downey&#x27;s own recovery from substance abuse was seen as creating a personal connection with the character. Downey reprises his role in &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; (2010), &quot;Marvel&#x27;s The Avengers&quot; (2012), &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; (2013), &quot;&quot; (2015), &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016), &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2018), and &quot;&quot; (2019). Iron Man supporting characters are set to appear in their own Marvel Cinematic Universe titles, &quot;Ironheart&quot; and &quot;Armor Wars&quot;.

Iron Man&#x27;s first animated appearance was in a segment of the 1966 series &quot;The Marvel Super Heroes&quot;, which adapted comic book drawings into animations, and has since been featured in the animated series &quot;Iron Man&quot; (1994–1996) and &quot;Iron Man: Armored Adventures&quot; (2009–2012). He also made many appearances in other Marvel animated programs, particularly those featuring the Avengers, and there have been multiple Iron Man direct-to-video releases.

Iron Man has featured in several video games, including &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008) and &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; (2010), which were released as adaptations of his Marvel Cinematic Universe films. He also featured in the PlayStation VR game &quot;Iron Man VR&quot; (2020). An Iron Man action-adventure game was announced in 2022 to be developed by Motive Studio. He also appeared in many other Marvel video games, such as those featuring the Avengers.

<doc id="67056" wikidata="Q994554" url="?curid=67056" title="Thoracic cavity">
<text>The thoracic cavity (or chest cavity) is the chamber of the body of vertebrates that is protected by the thoracic wall (rib cage and associated skin, muscle, and fascia). The central compartment of the thoracic cavity is the mediastinum. There are two openings of the thoracic cavity, a superior thoracic aperture known as the thoracic inlet and a lower inferior thoracic aperture known as the thoracic outlet.

The thoracic cavity includes the tendons as well as the cardiovascular system which could be damaged from injury to the back, spine or the neck.

==Structure==
Structures within the thoracic cavity include:
* structures of the cardiovascular system, including the heart and great vessels, which include the thoracic aorta, the pulmonary artery and all its branches, the superior and inferior vena cava, the pulmonary veins, and the azygos vein
* structures of the respiratory system, including the diaphragm, trachea, bronchi and lungs
* structures of the digestive system, including the esophagus,
* endocrine glands, including the thymus gland,
* structures of the nervous system including the paired vagus nerves, and the paired sympathetic chains,
* lymphatics including the thoracic duct.

It contains three potential spaces lined with mesothelium: the paired pleural cavities and the pericardial cavity. The mediastinum comprises those organs which lie in the centre of the chest between the lungs. The cavity also contains two openings one at the top, the superior thoracic aperture also called the thoracic inlet, and a lower inferior thoracic aperture which is much larger than the inlet.

==Clinical significance==
If the pleural cavity is breached from the outside, as by a bullet wound or knife wound, a pneumothorax, or air in the cavity, may result. If the volume of air is significant, one or both lungs may collapse, which requires immediate medical attention.

<text>The abdominal cavity is a large body cavity in humans and many other animals that contain organs. It is a part of the abdominopelvic cavity. It is located below the thoracic cavity, and above the pelvic cavity. Its dome-shaped roof is the thoracic diaphragm, a thin sheet of muscle under the lungs, and its floor is the pelvic inlet, opening into the pelvis.

==Structure==
===Organs===
Organs of the abdominal cavity include the stomach, liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, small intestine, kidneys, large intestine, and adrenal glands.

===Peritoneum===

The abdominal cavity is lined with a protective membrane termed the peritoneum. The inside wall is covered by the parietal peritoneum. The kidneys are located behind the peritoneum, in the retroperitoneum, outside the abdominal cavity. The viscera are also covered by visceral peritoneum.

Between the visceral and parietal peritoneum is the peritoneal cavity, which is a potential space. It contains a serous fluid called peritoneal fluid that allows motion. This motion is apparent of the gastrointestinal tract. The peritoneum, by virtue of its connection to the two (parietal and visceral) portions, gives support to the abdominal organs.

The peritoneum divides the cavity into numerous compartments. One of these the lesser sac is located behind the stomach and joins into the greater sac via the foramen of Winslow. Some of the organs are attached to the walls of the abdomen via folds of peritoneum and ligaments, such as the liver and others use broad areas of the peritoneum, such as the pancreas. The peritoneal ligaments are actually dense folds of the peritoneum that are used to connect viscera to viscera or viscera to the walls of the abdomen. They are named in such a way as to show what they connect typically. For example, the gastrocolic ligament connects the stomach and colon and the splenocolic ligament connects the spleen and the colon, or sometimes by their shape as the round ligament or triangular ligament.

===Mesentery===
Mesenteries are folds of peritoneum that are attached to the walls of the abdomen and enclose viscera completely. They are supplied with plentiful amounts of blood. The three most important mesenteries are mesentery for the small intestine, the transverse mesocolon, which attaches the back portion of the colon to the abdominal wall, and the sigmoid mesocolon which enfolds the sigmoid colon.

===Omenta===
The omentum are specialized folds of peritoneum that enclose nerves, blood vessels, lymph channels, fatty tissue, and connective tissue. There are two omenta. First, is the greater omentum that hangs off of the transverse colon and greater curvature of the stomach. The other is the lesser omentum that extends between the stomach and the liver.

==Clinical significance==
===Ascites===
When fluid collects in the abdominal cavity, this condition is called ascites. This is usually not noticeable until enough fluid has collected to distend the abdomen. The collection of fluid will cause pressure on the viscera, veins, and thoracic cavity. Treatment is directed at the cause of the fluid accumulation. One method is to decrease the portal vein pressure, especially useful in treating cirrhosis. Chylous ascites heals best if the lymphatic vessel involved is closed. Heart failure can cause recurring ascites.

===Inflammation===
Another disorder is called peritonitis which usually accompanies inflammatory processes elsewhere. It can be caused by damage to an organ, or from a contusion to the abdominal wall from the outside or by surgery. It may be brought in by the bloodstream or the lymphatic system. The most common origin is the gastrointestinal tract. Peritonitis can be acute or chronic, generalized or localized, and may have one origin or multiple origins. The omenta can help control the spread of infection; however without treatment, the infection will spread throughout the cavity. An abscess may also form as a secondary reaction to an infection. Antibiotics have become an important tool in fighting abscesses; however, external drainage is usually required also.

<doc id="67060" wikidata="Q177380" url="?curid=67060" title="Hot spring">
<text>A hot spring, hydrothermal spring, or geothermal spring is a spring produced by the emergence of geothermally heated groundwater onto the surface of the Earth. The groundwater is heated either by shallow bodies of magma (molten rock) or by circulation through faults to hot rock deep in the Earth&#x27;s crust.

Hot spring water often contains large amounts of dissolved minerals. The chemistry of hot springs ranges from acid sulfate springs with a pH as low as 0.8, to alkaline chloride springs saturated with silica, to bicarbonate springs saturated with carbon dioxide and carbonate minerals. Some springs also contain abundant dissolved iron. The minerals brought to the surface in hot springs often feed communities of extremophiles, microorganisms adapted to extreme conditions, and it is possible that life on Earth had its origin in hot springs.

Humans have made use of hot springs for bathing, relaxation, or medical therapy for thousands of years. However, some are hot enough that immersion can be harmful, leading to scalding and, potentially, death.

==Definitions==
There is no universally accepted definition of a hot spring. For example, one can find the phrase &quot;hot spring&quot; defined as
* any spring heated by geothermal activity
* a spring with water temperatures above its surroundings
* a natural spring with water temperature above human body temperature (normally about )

* a natural spring of water whose temperature is greater than 
* a type of thermal spring whose water temperature is usually or more above mean air temperature.
* a spring with water temperatures above 

The related term &quot;warm spring&quot; is defined as a spring with water temperature less than a hot spring by many sources, although Pentecost et al. (2003) suggest that the phrase &quot;warm spring&quot; is not useful and should be avoided. The US NOAA Geophysical Data Center defines a &quot;warm spring&quot; as a spring with water between .

==Sources of heat==
Water issuing from a hot spring is heated geothermally, that is, with heat produced from the Earth&#x27;s mantle. This takes place in two ways. In areas of high volcanic activity, magma (molten rock) may be present at shallow depths in the Earth&#x27;s crust. Groundwater is heated by these shallow magma bodies and rises to the surface to emerge at a hot spring. However, even in areas that do not experience volcanic activity, the temperature of rocks within the earth increases with depth. The rate of temperature increase with depth is known as the geothermal gradient. If water percolates deeply enough into the crust, it will be heated as it comes into contact with hot rock. This generally takes place along faults, where shattered rock beds provide easy paths for water to circulate to greater depths.

Much of the heat is created by decay of naturally radioactive elements. An estimated 45 to 90 percent of the heat escaping from the Earth originates from radioactive decay of elements mainly located in the mantle. The major heat-producing isotopes in the Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, uranium-235, and thorium-232. In areas with no volcanic activity, this heat flows through the crust by a slow process of thermal conduction, but in volcanic areas, the heat is carried to the surface more rapidly by bodies of magma.
A hot spring that periodically jets water and steam is called a geyser. In active volcanic zones such as Yellowstone National Park, magma may be present at shallow depths. If a hot spring is connected to a large natural cistern close to such a magma body, the magma may superheat the water in the cistern, raising its temperature above the normal boiling point. The water will not immediately boil, because the weight of the water column above the cistern pressurizes the cistern and suppresses boiling. However, as the superheated water expands, some of the water will emerge at the surface, reducing pressure in the cistern. This allows some of the water in the cistern to flash into steam, which forces more water out of the hot spring. This leads to a runaway condition in which a sizable amount of water and steam are forcibly ejected from the hot spring as the cistern is emptied. The cistern then refills with cooler water, and the cycle repeats.

Geysers require both a natural cistern and an abundant source of cooler water to refill the cistern after each eruption of the geyser. If the water supply is less abundant, so that the water is boiled as fast as it can accumulate and only reaches the surface in the form of steam, the result is a fumarole. If the water is mixed with mud and clay, the result is a mud pot.

An example of a non-volcanic warm spring is Warm Springs, Georgia (frequented for its therapeutic effects by paraplegic U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who built the Little White House there). Here the groundwater originates as rain and snow (meteoric water) falling on the nearby mountains, which penetrates a particular formation (Hollis Quartzite) to a depth of and is heated by the normal geothermal gradient.

==Chemistry==

Because heated water can hold more dissolved solids than cold water, the water that issues from hot springs often has a very high mineral content, containing everything from calcium to lithium and even radium. The overall chemistry of hot springs varies from &quot;alkaline chloride&quot; to &quot;acid sulfate&quot; to &quot;bicarbonate&quot; to &quot;iron-rich&quot;, each of which defines an end member of a range of possible hot spring chemistries.

Alkaline chloride hot springs are fed by hydrothermal fluids that form when groundwater containing dissolved chloride salts reacts with silicate rocks at high temperature. These springs have nearly neutral pH but are saturated with silica (). The solubility of silica depends strongly upon temperature, so upon cooling, the silica is deposited as geyserite, a form of opal (opal-A: ). This process is slow enough that geyserite is not all deposited immediately around the vent, but tends to build up a low, broad platform for some distance around the spring opening.

Acid sulfate hot springs are fed by hydrothermal fluids rich in hydrogen sulfide (), which is oxidized to form sulfuric acid, . The pH of the fluids is thereby lowered to values as low as 0.8. The acid reacts with rock to alter it to clay minerals, oxide minerals, and a residue of silica.

Bicarbonate hot springs are fed by hydrothermal fluids that form when carbon dioxide () and groundwater react with carbonate rocks. When the fluids reach the surface, is rapidly lost and carbonate minerals precipitate as travertine, so that bicarbonate hot springs tend to form high-relief structures around their openings.

Iron-rich springs are characterized by the presence of microbial communities that produce clumps of oxidized iron from iron in the hydrothermal fluids feeding the spring.

Some hot springs produce fluids that are intermediate in chemistry between these extremes. For example, mixed acid-sulfate-chloride hot springs are intermediate between acid sulfate and alkaline chloride springs and may form by mixing of acid sulfate and alkaline chloride fluids. They deposit geyserite, but in smaller quantities than alkaline chloride springs.

==Flow rates==
Hot springs range in flow rate from the tiniest &quot;seeps&quot; to veritable rivers of hot water. Sometimes there is enough pressure that the water shoots upward in a geyser, or fountain.

===High-flow hot springs===
There are many claims in the literature about the flow rates of hot springs. There are many more high flow non-thermal springs than geothermal springs. Springs with high flow rates include:
* The Dalhousie Springs complex in Australia had a peak total flow of more than 23,000 liters/second in 1915, giving the average spring in the complex an output of more than 325 liters/second. This has been reduced now to a peak total flow of 17,370 liters/second so the average spring has a peak output of about 250 liters/second.
* The 2,850 hot springs of Beppu in Japan are the highest flow hot spring complex in Japan. Together the Beppu hot springs produce about 1,592 liters/second, or corresponding to an average hot spring flow of 0.56 liters/second.
* The 303 hot springs of Kokonoe in Japan produce 1,028 liters/second, which gives the average hot spring a flow of 3.39 liters/second.
* Ōita Prefecture has 4,762 hot springs, with a total flow of 4,437 liters/second, so the average hot spring flow is 0.93 liters/second.
* The highest flow rate hot spring in Japan is the Tamagawa Hot Spring in Akita Prefecture, which has a flow rate of 150 liters/second. The Tamagawa Hot Spring feeds a wide stream with a temperature of .
* The most famous hot springs of Brazil&#x27;s Caldas Novas (&quot;New Hot Springs&quot; in Portuguese) are tapped by 86 wells, from which 333 liters/second are pumped for 14 hours per day. This corresponds to a peak average flow rate of 3.89 liters/second per well.
* In Florida, there are 33 recognized &quot;magnitude one springs&quot; (having a flow in excess of ). Silver Springs, Florida has a flow of more than .
* The Excelsior Geyser Crater in Yellowstone National Park yields about .
* Evans Plunge in Hot Springs, South Dakota has a flow rate of of spring water. The Plunge, built in 1890, is the world&#x27;s largest natural warm water indoor swimming pool.
* The hot spring of Saturnia, Italy with around 500 liters a second
* Lava Hot Springs in Idaho has a flow of 130 liters/second.
* Glenwood Springs in Colorado has a flow of 143 liters/second.
* Elizabeth Springs in western Queensland, Australia might have had a flow of 158 liters/second in the late 19th century, but now has a flow of about 5 liters/second.
* Deildartunguhver in Iceland has a flow of 180 liters/second.
* There are at least three hot springs in the Nage region south west of Bajawa in Indonesia that collectively produce more than 453.6 liters/second.
* There are another three large hot springs (Mengeruda, Wae Bana and Piga) north east of Bajawa, Indonesia that together produce more than 450 liters/second of hot water.

==Ecosystems==
Hot springs often host communities of microorganisms adapted to life in hot, mineral-laden water. These include thermophiles, which are a type of extremophile that thrives at high temperatures, between . Further from the vent, where the water has had time to cool and precipitate part of its mineral load, conditions favor organisms adapted to less extreme conditions. This produces a succession of microbial communities as one moves away from the vent, which in some respects resembles the successive stages in the evolution of early life.

For example, in a bicarbonate hot spring, the community of organisms immediately around the vent is dominated by filamentous thermophilic bacteria, such as &quot;Aquifex&quot; and other Aquificales, that oxidize sulfide and hydrogen to obtain energy for their life processes. Further from the vent, where water temperatures have dropped below , the surface is covered with microbial mats thick that are dominated by cyanobacteria, such as &quot;Spirulina&quot;, &quot;Oscillatoria&quot;, and &quot;Synechococcus&quot;, and green sulfur bacteria such as &quot;Chloroflexus&quot;. These organisms are all capable of photosynthesis, though green sulfur bacteria produce sulfur rather than oxygen during photosynthesis. Still further from the vent, where temperatures drop below , conditions are favorable for a complex community of microorganisms that includes &quot;Spirulina&quot;, &quot;Calothrix&quot;, diatoms and other single-celled eukaryotes, and grazing insects and protozoans. As temperatures drop close to those of the surroundings, higher plants appear.

Alkali chloride hot springs show a similar succession of communities of organisms, with various thermophilic bacteria and archaea in the hottest parts of the vent. Acid sulfate hot springs show a somewhat different succession of microorganisms, dominated by acid-tolerant algae (such as members of Cyanidiophyceae), fungi, and diatoms. Iron-rich hot springs contain communities of photosynthetic organisms that oxidize reduced (ferrous) iron to oxidized (ferric) iron.

Hot springs are a dependable source of water that provides a rich chemical environment. This includes reduced chemical species that microorganisms can oxidize as a source of energy.

== Significance to abiogenesis ==
=== Hot spring hypothesis ===
In contrast with &quot;black smokers&quot; (hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor), hot springs similar to terrestrial hydrothermal fields at Kamchatka produce fluids having suitable pH and temperature for early cells and biochemical reactions. Dissolved organic compounds were found in hot springs at Kamchatka . Metal sulfides and silica minerals in these environments would act as photocatalysts. They experience cycles of wetting and drying which promote the formation of biopolymers which are then encapsulated in vesicles after rehydration. Solar UV exposure to the environment promotes synthesis to monomeric biomolecules. The ionic composition and concentration of hot springs (K, B, Zn, P, O, S, C, Mn, N, and H) are identical to the cytoplasm of modern cells and possibly to those of the LUCA or early cellular life according to phylogenomic analysis. For these reasons, it has been hypothesized that hot springs may be the place of origin of life on Earth. The evolutionary implications of the hypothesis imply a direct evolutionary pathway to land plants. Where continuous exposure to sunlight leads to the development of photosynthetic properties and later colonize on land and life at hydrothermal vents is suggested to be a later adaptation.

Recent experimental studies at hot springs support this hypothesis. They show that fatty acids self-assemble into membranous structures and encapsulate synthesized biomolecules during exposure to UV light and multiple wet-dry cycles at slightly alkaline or acidic hot springs, which would not happen at saltwater conditions as the high concentrations of ionic solutes there would inhibit the formation of membranous structures. David Deamer and Bruce Damer note that these hypothesized prebiotic environments resemble Charles Darwin&#x27;s imagined &quot;warm little pond&quot;. If life did not emerge at deep sea hydrothermal vents, rather at terrestrial pools, extraterrestrial quinones transported to the environment would generate redox reactions conducive to proton gradients. Without continuous wet-dry cycling to maintain stability of primitive proteins for membrane transport and other biological macromolecules, they would go through hydrolysis in an aquatic environment. Scientists discovered a 3.48 billion year old geyserite that seemingly preserved fossilized microbial life, stromatolites, and biosignatures. Researchers propose pyrophosphite to have been used by early cellular life for energy storage and it might have been a precursor to pyrophosphate. Phosphites, which are present at hot springs, would have bonded together into pyrophosphite within hot springs through wet-dry cycling. Like alkaline hydrothermal vents, the Hakuba Happo hot spring goes through serpentinization, suggesting methanogenic microbial life possibly originated in similar habitats.

=== Limitations ===
A problem with the hot spring hypothesis for an origin of life is that phosphate has low solubility in water. Pyrophosphite could have been present within protocells, however all modern life forms use pyrophosphate for energy storage. Kee suggests that pyrophosphate could have been utilized after the emergence of enzymes. Dehydrated conditions would favor phosphorylation of organic compounds and condensation of phosphate to polyphosphate. Another problem is that solar ultraviolet radiation and frequent impacts would have inhibited habitability of early cellular life at hot springs, although biological macromolecules might have undergone selection during exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation and would have been catalyzed by photocatalytic silica minerals and metal sulfides. Carbonaceous meteors during the Late Heavy Bombardment would not have caused cratering on Earth as they would produce fragments upon atmospheric entry. The meteors are estimated to have been 40 to 80 meters in diameter however larger impactors would produce larger craters. Metabolic pathways have not yet been demonstrated at these environments, but the development of proton gradients might have been generated by redox reactions coupled to meteoric quinones or protocell growth. Metabolic reactions in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and reverse Krebs cycle have been produced in acidic conditions and thermophilic temperatures in the presence of metals which is consistent with observations of RNA mostly stable at acidic pH.

==Human uses==

===History===
Hot springs have been enjoyed by humans for thousands of years. Even macaques are known to have extended their northern range into Japan by making use of hot springs to protect themselves from cold stress. Hot spring baths (&quot;onsen&quot;) have been in use in Japan for at least two thousand years, traditionally for cleanliness and relaxation, but increasingly for their therapeutic value. In the Homeric Age of Greece (ca. 1000 BCE), baths were primarily for hygiene, but by the time of Hippocrates (ca. 460 BCE), hot springs were credited with healing power. The popularity of hot springs has fluctuated over the centuries since, but they are now popular around the world.

===Therapeutic uses===
Because of both the folklore and the claimed medical value attributed to some hot springs, they are often popular tourist destinations, and locations for rehabilitation clinics for those with disabilities. However, the scientific basis for therapeutic bathing in hot springs is uncertain. Hot bath therapy for lead poisoning was common and reportedly highly successful in the 18th and 19th centuries, and may have been due to diuresis (increased production of urine) from sitting in hot water, which increased excretion of lead; better food and isolation from lead sources; and increased intake of calcium and iron. Significant improvement in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis have been reported in studies of spa therapy, but these studies have methodological problems, such as the obvious impracticality of placebo-controlled studies (in which a patient does not know if they are receiving the therapy). As a result, the therapeutic effectiveness of hot spring therapy remains uncertain.

===Precautions===
Hot springs in volcanic areas are often at or near the boiling point. People have been seriously scalded and even killed by accidentally or intentionally entering these springs.

Some hot springs microbiota are infectious to humans:
* &quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot;, an excavate amoeba, lives in warm unsalted waters worldwide and causes a fatal meningitis should the organisms enter the nose.
* &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; also can spread through hot springs, according to the US Centers for Disease Control - The organisms enter through the eyes or via an open wound.
* &quot;Legionella&quot; bacteria have been spread through hot springs.
*&quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; was reported to have very likely been acquired from bathing in a hot spring according to one case study, with the near-body temperature, slightly acidic, isotonic, organic matter-containing waters thought to facilitate the survival of the pathogen.

===Etiquette===
The customs and practices observed differ depending on the hot spring. It is common practice that bathers should wash before entering the water so as not to contaminate the water (with/without soap). In many countries, like Japan, it is required to enter the hot spring with no clothes on, including swimwear. Often there are different facilities or times for men and women, but mixed &quot;onsen&quot; do exist. In some countries, if it is a public hot spring, swimwear is required.

==Examples==

There are hot springs in many places and on all continents of the world. Countries that are renowned for their hot springs include China, Costa Rica, Hungary, Iceland, Iran, Japan, New Zealand, Brazil, Peru, Serbia, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United States, but there are hot springs in many other places as well:
* Widely renowned since a chemistry professor&#x27;s report in 1918 classified them as one of the world&#x27;s most electrolytic mineral waters, the Rio Hondo Hot Springs in northern Argentina have become among the most visited on earth. The Cacheuta Spa is another famous hot springs in Argentina.
* The springs in Europe with the highest temperatures are located in France, in a small village named Chaudes-Aigues. Located at the heart of the French volcanic region Auvergne, the thirty natural hot springs of Chaudes-Aigues have temperatures ranging from to more than . The hottest one, the &quot;Source du Par&quot;, has a temperature of . The hot waters running under the village have provided heat for the houses and for the church since the 14th Century. Chaudes-Aigues (Cantal, France) is a spa town known since the Roman Empire for the treatment of rheumatism.
* Carbonate aquifers in foreland tectonic settings can host important thermal springs although located in areas commonly not characterised by regional high heat flow values. In these cases, when thermal springs are located close or along the coastlines, the subaerial and/or submarine thermal springs constitute the outflow of marine groundwater, flowing through localised fractures and karstic rock-volumes. This is the case of springs occurring along the south-easternmost portion of the Apulia region (Southern Italy) where few sulphurous and warm waters () outflow in partially submerged caves located along the Adriatic coast, thus supplying the historical spas of Santa Cesarea Terme. These springs are known from ancient times (Aristotele in III Century BC) and the physical-chemical features of their thermal waters resulted to be partly influenced by the sea level variations.
* One of the potential geothermal energy reservoirs in India is the Tattapani thermal springs of Madhya Pradesh.
* The silica-rich deposits found in Nili Patera, the volcanic caldera in Syrtis Major, Mars, are thought to be the remains of an extinct hot spring system.

<text>Pastry refers to a variety of doughs (often enriched with fat or eggs), as well as the sweet and savoury baked goods made from them. The dough may be accordingly called pastry dough for clarity. Sweetened pastries are often described as &quot;bakers&#x27; confectionery&quot;. Common pastry dishes include pies, tarts, quiches, croissants, and pasties. 

The French word pâtisserie is also used in English (with or without the accent) for many of the same foods, as well as the set of techniques used to make them. Originally, the French word referred to anything, such as a meat pie, made in dough (&quot;paste&quot;, later &quot;pâte&quot;) and not typically a luxurious or sweet product. This meaning still persisted in the nineteenth century, though by then the term more often referred to the sweet and often ornate confections implied today.

==Definitions==
The precise definition of the term pastry varies based on location and culture. Common doughs used to make pastries include filo dough, puff pastry, choux pastry, short dough, &quot;pâte brisée&quot;, &quot;pâte sucrée&quot;, and other enriched doughs. Pastries tend to have a delicate texture, often flaky or crumbly, and rich flavor—simple breads are thus excluded from the pastry category. Pastries also tend to be baked.

; Pastry bag or piping bag: A disposable or reusable bag that is often cone-shaped, used to make an even stream of dough, frosting, or flavored substance to form a structure, decorate a baked item, or fill a pastry with a custard, cream, jelly, or other filling.
; Pastry board: A square or oblong board, preferably marble but usually wood, on which pastry is flattened.
; Pastry brake: Opposed and counter-rotating rollers with a variable gap through which pastry can be worked and reduced in thickness for commercial production. A small version is used domestically for pasta production.
; Pastry case: An uncooked or blind baked pastry container that is used to hold savory or sweet mixtures.
; Pastry cream: Confectioner&#x27;s custard. An egg- and flour-thickened custard made with sweetened milk flavored with vanilla. It is traditionally used as a filling for flans, cakes, pastries, tarts, etc. The flour prevents the egg from curdling.
; Pastry cutters: Various metal or plastic outlines of shapes, &quot;e.g.&quot; circles, fluted circles, diamonds, gingerbread men, etc., sharpened on one or both sides and used to cut out corresponding shapes from biscuit, scone, pastry, or cake mixtures.
; Pastry blender: A kitchen implement used to chop the fat into the flour, which prevents the melting of the fat with body heat from fingers, and improves control of the size of the fat chunks. Usually constructed of wire or plastic, with multiple wires or small blades connected to a handle.
; Viennoiserie: French term for &quot;Viennese pastry&quot;, which, although it technically should be yeast raised, is now commonly used as a term for many laminated and puff- and choux-based pastries, including &quot;croissants&quot;, &quot;brioche&quot;, and &quot;pain au chocolat.&quot;

==History==

The European tradition of pastry-making is often traced back to the shortcrust era of flaky doughs that were in use throughout the Mediterranean in ancient times. In the ancient Mediterranean, the Romans, Greeks, and Phoenicians all had filo-style pastries in their culinary traditions. 
In the plays of Aristophanes, written in the 5th century BC, there is mention of sweetmeats, including small pastries filled with fruit. Roman cuisine used flour, oil, and water to make pastries that were used to cover meats and fowls during baking in order to keep in the juices, but the pastry was not meant to be eaten. A pastry that was meant to be eaten was a richer pastry that was made into small pastries containing eggs or little birds and that were often served at banquets. Greeks and Romans both struggled in making a good pastry because they used oil in the cooking process, and oil causes the pastry to lose its stiffness.

In the medieval cuisine of Northern Europe, pastry chefs were able to produce nice, stiff pastries because they cooked with shortening and butter. Some incomplete lists of ingredients have been found in medieval cookbooks, but no full, detailed versions. There were stiff, empty pastries called coffins or &#x27;huff paste&#x27;, that were eaten by servants only and included an egg yolk glaze to help make them more enjoyable to consume. Medieval pastries also included small tarts to add richness.

It was not until about the mid-16th century that actual pastry recipes began appearing. These recipes were adopted and adapted over time in various European countries, resulting in the myriad pastry traditions known to the region, from Portuguese &quot;pastéis de nata&quot; in the west to Russian &quot;pirozhki&quot; in the east. The use of chocolate in pastry-making in the west, so commonplace today, arose only after Spanish and Portuguese traders brought chocolate to Europe from the New World starting in the 16th century. Many culinary historians consider French pastry chef Antonin Carême (1784–1833) to have been the first great master of pastry making in modern times.

Pastry-making has a strong tradition in many parts of Asia. Chinese pastry is made from rice, or different types of flour, with fruit, sweet bean paste or sesame-based fillings. The mooncakes are part of Chinese Mid Autumn Festival traditions, while cha siu bao, steamed or baked pork buns, are a regular savory dim sum menu item. In the 19th century, the British brought western-style pastry to the Far East, though it would be the French-influenced Maxim in the 1950s that made western pastry popular in Chinese-speaking regions starting with Hong Kong. The term &quot;western cake&quot; (西餅) is used to refer to western pastry, otherwise Chinese pastry is assumed. Other Asian countries such as Korea prepare traditional pastry-confections such as tteok, hangwa, and yaksik with flour, rice, fruits, and regional specific ingredients to make unique desserts. Japan also has specialized pastry-confections better known as mochi and manjū. Pastry-confections that originate in Asia are clearly distinct from those that originate in the west, which are generally much sweeter.
==Types==
; Shortcrust pastry : Shortcrust pastry is the simplest and most common pastry. It is made with flour, fat, butter, salt, and water to bind the dough. &quot;Pâte brisée&quot; is the French version of classic pie or tart shortcrust pastry. The process of making pastry includes mixing of the fat and flour, adding water, chilling and then rolling out the dough. Chilling before rolling is essential since it enables the fat (lard, butter, etc.) to harden again and thus create flaky layers in the dough. It also allows for even hydration and inhibits gluten formation. It results in a tender flaky pastry. The fat is mixed with the flour first, generally by rubbing with fingers or a pastry blender, which inhibits gluten formation by coating the gluten strands in fat and results in a short (as in crumbly; hence the term shortcrust), tender pastry. A related type is the sweetened sweetcrust pastry, also known as &quot;pâte sucrée&quot;, in which sugar and egg yolks have been added (rather than water) to bind the pastry.
; Flaky pastry: Flaky pastry is a simple pastry that expands when cooked due to the number of layers. It bakes into a crisp, buttery pastry. The &quot;puff&quot; is obtained by the shard-like layers of fat, most often butter or shortening, creating layers which expand in the heat of the oven when baked.
; Puff pastry : Puff pastry has many layers that cause it to expand or &quot;puff&quot; when baked. Puff pastry is made using a laminated dough consisting of flour, butter, salt, and water. The pastry rises up due to the water and fats expanding as they turn into steam upon heating. Puff pastry come out of the oven light, flaky, and tender.
; Choux pastry : Choux pastry is a very light pastry that is often filled with cream. Unlike other types of pastry, choux is in fact closer to a dough before being cooked which gives it the ability to be piped into various shapes such as the éclair and profiterole. Its name originates from the French &quot;choux&quot;, meaning cabbage, owing to its rough cabbage-like shape after cooking.
: Choux begins as a mixture of milk or water and butter which are heated together until the butter melts, to which flour is added to form a dough. Eggs are then beaten into the dough to further enrich it. This high percentage of water causes the pastry to expand into a light, hollow pastry. Initially, the water in the dough turns to steam in the oven and causes the pastry to rise; then the starch in the flour gelatinizes, thereby solidifying the pastry. Once the choux dough has expanded, it is taken out of the oven; a hole is made in it to let out the steam. The pastry is then placed back in the oven to dry out and become crisp. The pastry is filled with various flavors of cream and is often topped with chocolate. Choux pastries can also be filled with ingredients such as cheese, tuna, or chicken to be used as appetizers.
; Phyllo (Filo): Phyllo is a paper-thin pastry dough that is used in many layers. The phyllo is generally wrapped around a filling and brushed with butter before baking. These pastries are very delicate and flaky.
; Hot water crust pastry: Hot water crust pastry is used for pies, such as pork pies, game pies and, more rarely, steak and kidney pies. Hot water crust is traditionally used for making hand-raised pies. The usual ingredients are hot water, lard, and flour. The pastry is made by heating water into which the fat is then melted, before bringing to the boil, and finally mixing with the flour. It can be done by beating the flour into the mixture in the pan, or by kneading on a pastry board. Either way, the result is a hot and rather sticky paste that can be used for hand-raising: shaping by hand, sometimes using a dish or bowl as an inner mould. As the crust cools, its shape is largely retained, and it is filled and covered with a crust, ready for baking. Hand-raised hot water crust pastry does not produce a neat and uniform finish, as there will be sagging during the cooking of the filled pie, which is generally accepted as the mark of a hand-made pie.

==Chemistry==
Different kinds of pastry doughs are made by utilizing the natural characteristics of wheat flour and certain fats. When wheat flour is mixed with water and kneaded into plain dough, it develops strands of gluten, which are what make bread tough and elastic. In a typical pastry, however, this toughness is unwanted, so fat or oil is added to slow down the development of gluten. Pastry flour can also be used, since it typically has a lower level of protein than all-purpose or bread flours.

Lard or suet work well because they have a coarse, crystalline structure that is very effective. Using unclarified butter does not work well because of its water content; clarified butter, or ghee, which is virtually water-free, is better, but shortcrust pastry using only butter may develop an inferior texture. If the fat is melted with hot water or if liquid oil is used, the thin oily layer between the grains offers less of an obstacle to gluten formation and the resulting pastry is tougher.

A good pastry is light and airy and fatty, but firm enough to support the weight of the filling. When making a shortcrust pastry, care must be taken to blend the fat and flour thoroughly before adding any liquid---to ensure that the flour granules are adequately coated with fat and less likely to develop gluten. On the other hand, overmixing results in long gluten strands that toughen the pastry. In other types of pastry such as Danish pastry and croissants, the characteristic flaky texture is achieved by repeatedly rolling out a dough similar to yeast bread dough, spreading it with butter, and folding it to produce many thin layers.

==Pastry chefs==

Pastry chefs use a combination of culinary ability and creativity for baking, decoration, and flavoring with ingredients. Many baked goods require a lot of time and focus. Presentation is an important aspect of pastry and dessert preparation. The job is often physically demanding, requiring attention to detail and long hours. Pastry chefs are also responsible for creating new recipes to put on the menu, and they work in restaurants, bistros, large hotels, casinos and bakeries. Pastry baking is usually done in an area slightly separate from the main kitchen. This section of the kitchen is in charge of making pastries, desserts, and other baked goods.

<doc id="67064" wikidata="Q900450" url="?curid=67064" title="Rose water">
<text>Rose water is a flavoured water made by steeping rose petals in water. It is the hydrosol portion of the distillate of rose petals, a by-product of the production of rose oil for use in perfume. Rose water is also used to flavour food, as a component in some cosmetic and medical preparations, and for religious purposes throughout Eurasia.

Rose syrup (not to be confused with rose hip syrup) is a syrup made from rose water, with sugar added. Gulkand in South Asia is a syrupy mashed rose mixture.

Central Iran is home to the annual Golabgiri festival each spring. Thousands of tourists visit the area to celebrate the rose harvest for the production of rosewater. Iran accounts for 90% of world production of rose water.

==History==
Since ancient times, roses have been used medicinally, nutritionally, and as a source of perfume.

Rose perfumes are made from rose oil, also called &quot;attar of roses&quot;, which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam-distilling the crushed petals of roses. Rose water is a by-product of this process. Before the development of the technique of distilling rose water, rose petals were already used in Persian cuisine to perfume and flavour dishes. Rose water likely originated in Persia, where it is known as &quot;gulāb&quot; (), from &quot;gul&quot; ( rose) and &quot;ab&quot; ( water). The term was adopted into Medieval Greek as &quot;zoulápin&quot;.

The process of creating rose water through steam distillation was refined by Arab and Persian chemists in the medieval Islamic world, which led to more efficient and economic uses for perfumery industries.

==Uses==

===Food===
Rose water is sometimes added to lemonade. It is often added to water to mask unpleasant odours and flavours.

In South Asian cuisine, rose water is a common ingredient in sweets such as laddu, gulab jamun, and peda. It is also used to flavour milk, lassi, rice pudding, and other dairy dishes.

In Malaysia and Singapore, sweet red-tinted rose water is mixed with milk, making a sweet pink drink called bandung.

American and European bakers often used rose water until the 19th century, when vanilla became popular. In Yorkshire, rose water has long been used as a flavouring for the regional specialty, Yorkshire curd tart. 

In Iran, it is added to tea, ice cream, cookies, and other sweets. Rosewater is also used in some savoury dishes, such as Khoresh Gheymé, Shirin Polow (cherry rice), Tahchin or during the steaming of Persian rice. 

In Middle Eastern cuisines, rosewater is used in various dishes, especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, nougat, and baklava. Marzipan has long been flavoured with rose water. In Cyprus, rose water is used to flavour a number of different desserts, including the Cypriot version of muhallebi.

Rose water is frequently used as a halal substitute for red wine and other alcohols in cooking. The Premier League offers a rose water-based beverage as an alternative for champagne when awarding Muslim players. In accordance with the ban on alcohol consumption in Islamic countries, rose water is used instead of champagne on the podium of the Bahrain Grand Prix and Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

===Cosmetics===
In medieval Europe, rose water was used to wash hands at a meal table during feasts.

===Religion===
Rose water is used in the religious ceremonies of Christianity (in the Byzantine Rite of the Catholic Church and in the Eastern Orthodox Church), Zoroastrianism, and the Baháʼí Faith (in &quot;Kitab-i-Aqdas&quot; 1:76).

==Composition==
Depending on the origin and manufacturing method, rose water is obtained from the sepals and petals of &quot;Rosa × damascena&quot; through steam distillation. The following monoterpenoid and alkane components can be identified with gas chromatography: mostly citronellol, nonadecane, geraniol and phenyl ethyl alcohol, and also henicosane, 9-nonadecen, eicosane, linalool, citronellyl acetate, methyleugenol, heptadecane, pentadecane, docosane, nerol, disiloxane, octadecane, and pentacosane. Usually, phenylethyl alcohol is responsible for the typical odour of rose water but is not always present in rose water products.

<doc id="67065" wikidata="Q48522" url="?curid=67065" title="Word-sense disambiguation">
<text>Word-sense disambiguation is the process of identifying which sense of a word is meant in a sentence or other segment of context. In human language processing and cognition, it is usually subconscious.

Given that natural language requires reflection of neurological reality, as shaped by the abilities provided by the brain&#x27;s neural networks, computer science has had a long-term challenge in developing the ability in computers to do natural language processing and machine learning.

Many techniques have been researched, including dictionary-based methods that use the knowledge encoded in lexical resources, supervised machine learning methods in which a classifier is trained for each distinct word on a corpus of manually sense-annotated examples, and completely unsupervised methods that cluster occurrences of words, thereby inducing word senses. Among these, supervised learning approaches have been the most successful algorithms to date.

Accuracy of current algorithms is difficult to state without a host of caveats. In English, accuracy at the coarse-grained (homograph) level is routinely above 90% (as of 2009), with some methods on particular homographs achieving over 96%. On finer-grained sense distinctions, top accuracies from 59.1% to 69.0% have been reported in evaluation exercises (SemEval-2007, Senseval-2), where the baseline accuracy of the simplest possible algorithm of always choosing the most frequent sense was 51.4% and 57%, respectively.

==Variants ==
Disambiguation requires two strict inputs: a dictionary to specify the senses which are to be disambiguated and a corpus of language data to be disambiguated (in some methods, a training corpus of language examples is also required). WSD task has two variants: &quot;lexical sample&quot; (disambiguating the occurrences of a small sample of target words which were previously selected) and &quot;all words&quot; task (disambiguation of all the words in a running text). &quot;All words&quot; task is generally considered a more realistic form of evaluation, but the corpus is more expensive to produce because human annotators have to read the definitions for each word in the sequence every time they need to make a tagging judgement, rather than once for a block of instances for the same target word.

==History==
WSD was first formulated as a distinct computational task during the early days of machine translation in the 1940s, making it one of the oldest problems in computational linguistics. Warren Weaver first introduced the problem in a computational context in his 1949 memorandum on translation. Later, Bar-Hillel (1960) argued that WSD could not be solved by &quot;electronic computer&quot; because of the need in general to model all world knowledge.

In the 1970s, WSD was a subtask of semantic interpretation systems developed within the field of artificial intelligence, starting with Wilks&#x27; preference semantics. However, since WSD systems were at the time largely rule-based and hand-coded they were prone to a knowledge acquisition bottleneck.

By the 1980s large-scale lexical resources, such as the Oxford Advanced Learner&#x27;s Dictionary of Current English (OALD), became available: hand-coding was replaced with knowledge automatically extracted from these resources, but disambiguation was still knowledge-based or dictionary-based.

In the 1990s, the statistical revolution advanced computational linguistics, and WSD became a paradigm problem on which to apply supervised machine learning techniques.

The 2000s saw supervised techniques reach a plateau in accuracy, and so attention has shifted to coarser-grained senses, domain adaptation, semi-supervised and unsupervised corpus-based systems, combinations of different methods, and the return of knowledge-based systems via graph-based methods. Still, supervised systems continue to perform best.

==Difficulties==

===Differences between dictionaries===
One problem with word sense disambiguation is deciding what the senses are, as different dictionaries and thesauruses will provide different divisions of words into senses. Some researchers have suggested choosing a particular dictionary, and using its set of senses to deal with this issue. Generally, however, research results using broad distinctions in senses have been much better than those using narrow ones. Most researchers continue to work on fine-grained WSD.

Most research in the field of WSD is performed by using WordNet as a reference sense inventory for English. WordNet is a computational lexicon that encodes concepts as synonym sets (e.g. the concept of car is encoded as { car, auto, automobile, machine, motorcar }). Other resources used for disambiguation purposes include Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus and Wikipedia. More recently, BabelNet, a multilingual encyclopedic dictionary, has been used for multilingual WSD.

===Part-of-speech tagging===
In any real test, part-of-speech tagging and sense tagging have proven to be very closely related, with each potentially imposing constraints upon the other. The question whether these tasks should be kept together or decoupled is still not unanimously resolved, but recently scientists incline to test these things separately (e.g. in the Senseval/SemEval competitions parts of speech are provided as input for the text to disambiguate).

Both WSD and part-of-speech tagging involve disambiguating or tagging with words. However, algorithms used for one do not tend to work well for the other, mainly because the part of speech of a word is primarily determined by the immediately adjacent one to three words, whereas the sense of a word may be determined by words further away. The success rate for part-of-speech tagging algorithms is at present much higher than that for WSD, state-of-the art being around 96% accuracy or better, as compared to less than 75% accuracy in word sense disambiguation with supervised learning. These figures are typical for English, and may be very different from those for other languages.

===Inter-judge variance===
Another problem is inter-judge variance. WSD systems are normally tested by having their results on a task compared against those of a human. However, while it is relatively easy to assign parts of speech to text, training people to tag senses has been proven to be far more difficult. While users can memorize all of the possible parts of speech a word can take, it is often impossible for individuals to memorize all of the senses a word can take. Moreover, humans do not agree on the task at hand – give a list of senses and sentences, and humans will not always agree on which word belongs in which sense.

As human performance serves as the standard, it is an upper bound for computer performance. Human performance, however, is much better on coarse-grained than fine-grained distinctions, so this again is why research on coarse-grained distinctions has been put to test in recent WSD evaluation exercises.

===Sense inventory and algorithms&#x27; task-dependency===
A task-independent sense inventory is not a coherent concept: each task requires its own division of word meaning into senses relevant to the task. Additionally, completely different algorithms might be required by different applications. In machine translation, the problem takes the form of target word selection. The &quot;senses&quot; are words in the target language, which often correspond to significant meaning distinctions in the source language (&quot;bank&quot; could translate to the French – that is, &#x27;financial bank&#x27; or – that is, &#x27;edge of river&#x27;). In information retrieval, a sense inventory is not necessarily required, because it is enough to know that a word is used in the same sense in the query and a retrieved document; what sense that is, is unimportant.

===Discreteness of senses===
Finally, the very notion of &quot;word sense&quot; is slippery and controversial. Most people can agree in distinctions at the coarse-grained homograph level (e.g., pen as writing instrument or enclosure), but go down one level to fine-grained polysemy, and disagreements arise. For example, in Senseval-2, which used fine-grained sense distinctions, human annotators agreed in only 85% of word occurrences. Word meaning is in principle infinitely variable and context-sensitive. It does not divide up easily into distinct or discrete sub-meanings. Lexicographers frequently discover in corpora loose and overlapping word meanings, and standard or conventional meanings extended, modulated, and exploited in a bewildering variety of ways. The art of lexicography is to generalize from the corpus to definitions that evoke and explain the full range of meaning of a word, making it seem like words are well-behaved semantically. However, it is not at all clear if these same meaning distinctions are applicable in computational applications, as the decisions of lexicographers are usually driven by other considerations. In 2009, a task – named lexical substitution – was proposed as a possible solution to the sense discreteness problem. The task consists of providing a substitute for a word in context that preserves the meaning of the original word (potentially, substitutes can be chosen from the full lexicon of the target language, thus overcoming discreteness).

==Approaches and methods==
There are two main approaches to WSD – deep approaches and shallow approaches.

Deep approaches presume access to a comprehensive body of world knowledge. These approaches are generally not considered to be very successful in practice, mainly because such a body of knowledge does not exist in a computer-readable format, outside very limited domains. Additionally due to the long tradition in computational linguistics, of trying such approaches in terms of coded knowledge and in some cases, it can be hard to distinguish between knowledge involved in linguistic or world knowledge. The first attempt was that by Margaret Masterman and her colleagues, at the Cambridge Language Research Unit in England, in the 1950s. This attempt used as data a punched-card version of Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus and its numbered &quot;heads&quot;, as an indicator of topics and looked for repetitions in text, using a set intersection algorithm. It was not very successful, but had strong relationships to later work, especially Yarowsky&#x27;s machine learning optimisation of a thesaurus method in the 1990s.

Shallow approaches do not try to understand the text, but instead consider the surrounding words. These rules can be automatically derived by the computer, using a training corpus of words tagged with their word senses. This approach, while theoretically not as powerful as deep approaches, gives superior results in practice, due to the computer&#x27;s limited world knowledge.

There are four conventional approaches to WSD:
* Dictionary- and knowledge-based methods: These rely primarily on dictionaries, thesauri, and lexical knowledge bases, without using any corpus evidence.
* Semi-supervised or minimally supervised methods: These make use of a secondary source of knowledge such as a small annotated corpus as seed data in a bootstrapping process, or a word-aligned bilingual corpus.
* Supervised methods: These make use of sense-annotated corpora to train from.
* Unsupervised methods: These eschew (almost) completely external information and work directly from raw unannotated corpora. These methods are also known under the name of word sense discrimination.

Almost all these approaches work by defining a window of &quot;n&quot; content words around each word to be disambiguated in the corpus, and statistically analyzing those &quot;n&quot; surrounding words. Two shallow approaches used to train and then disambiguate are Naïve Bayes classifiers and decision trees. In recent research, kernel-based methods such as support vector machines have shown superior performance in supervised learning. Graph-based approaches have also gained much attention from the research community, and currently achieve performance close to the state of the art.

===Dictionary- and knowledge-based methods===
The Lesk algorithm is the seminal dictionary-based method. It is based on the hypothesis that words used together in text are related to each other and that the relation can be observed in the definitions of the words and their senses. Two (or more) words are disambiguated by finding the pair of dictionary senses with the greatest word overlap in their dictionary definitions. For example, when disambiguating the words in &quot;pine cone&quot;, the definitions of the appropriate senses both include the words evergreen and tree (at least in one dictionary). A similar approach searches for the shortest path between two words: the second word is iteratively searched among the definitions of every semantic variant of the first word, then among the definitions of every semantic variant of each word in the previous definitions and so on. Finally, the first word is disambiguated by selecting the semantic variant which minimizes the distance from the first to the second word.

An alternative to the use of the definitions is to consider general word-sense relatedness and to compute the semantic similarity of each pair of word senses based on a given lexical knowledge base such as WordNet. Graph-based methods reminiscent of spreading activation research of the early days of AI research have been applied with some success. More complex graph-based approaches have been shown to perform almost as well as supervised methods or even outperforming them on specific domains. Recently, it has been reported that simple graph connectivity measures, such as degree, perform state-of-the-art WSD in the presence of a sufficiently rich lexical knowledge base. Also, automatically transferring knowledge in the form of semantic relations from Wikipedia to WordNet has been shown to boost simple knowledge-based methods, enabling them to rival the best supervised systems and even outperform them in a domain-specific setting.

The use of selectional preferences (or selectional restrictions) is also useful, for example, knowing that one typically cooks food, one can disambiguate the word bass in &quot;I am cooking basses&quot; (i.e., it&#x27;s not a musical instrument).

===Supervised methods===
Supervised methods are based on the assumption that the context can provide enough evidence on its own to disambiguate words (hence, common sense and reasoning are deemed unnecessary). Probably every machine learning algorithm going has been applied to WSD, including associated techniques such as feature selection, parameter optimization, and ensemble learning. Support Vector Machines and memory-based learning have been shown to be the most successful approaches, to date, probably because they can cope with the high-dimensionality of the feature space. However, these supervised methods are subject to a new knowledge acquisition bottleneck since they rely on substantial amounts of manually sense-tagged corpora for training, which are laborious and expensive to create.

===Semi-supervised methods===
Because of the lack of training data, many word sense disambiguation algorithms use semi-supervised learning, which allows both labeled and unlabeled data. The Yarowsky algorithm was an early example of such an algorithm. It uses the ‘One sense per collocation’ and the ‘One sense per discourse’ properties of human languages for word sense disambiguation. From observation, words tend to exhibit only one sense in most given discourse and in a given collocation.

The bootstrapping approach starts from a small amount of seed data for each word: either manually tagged training examples or a small number of surefire decision rules (e.g., &#x27;play&#x27; in the context of &#x27;bass&#x27; almost always indicates the musical instrument). The seeds are used to train an initial classifier, using any supervised method. This classifier is then used on the untagged portion of the corpus to extract a larger training set, in which only the most confident classifications are included. The process repeats, each new classifier being trained on a successively larger training corpus, until the whole corpus is consumed, or until a given maximum number of iterations is reached.

Other semi-supervised techniques use large quantities of untagged corpora to provide co-occurrence information that supplements the tagged corpora. These techniques have the potential to help in the adaptation of supervised models to different domains.

Also, an ambiguous word in one language is often translated into different words in a second language depending on the sense of the word. Word-aligned bilingual corpora have been used to infer cross-lingual sense distinctions, a kind of semi-supervised system.

===Unsupervised methods===

Unsupervised learning is the greatest challenge for WSD researchers. The underlying assumption is that similar senses occur in similar contexts, and thus senses can be induced from text by clustering word occurrences using some measure of similarity of context, a task referred to as word sense induction or discrimination. Then, new occurrences of the word can be classified into the closest induced clusters/senses. Performance has been lower than for the other methods described above, but comparisons are difficult since senses induced must be mapped to a known dictionary of word senses. If a mapping to a set of dictionary senses is not desired, cluster-based evaluations (including measures of entropy and purity) can be performed. Alternatively, word sense induction methods can be tested and compared within an application. For instance, it has been shown that word sense induction improves Web search result clustering by increasing the quality of result clusters and the degree diversification of result lists. It is hoped that unsupervised learning will overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck because they are not dependent on manual effort.

Representing words considering their context through fixed-size dense vectors (word embeddings) has become one of the most fundamental blocks in several NLP systems. Even though most of traditional word-embedding techniques conflate words with multiple meanings into a single vector representation, they still can be used to improve WSD. A simple approach to employ pre-computed word embeddings to represent word senses is to compute the centroids of sense clusters. In addition to word-embedding techniques, lexical databases (e.g., WordNet, ConceptNet, BabelNet) can also assist unsupervised systems in mapping words and their senses as dictionaries. Some techniques that combine lexical databases and word embeddings are presented in AutoExtend and Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA). In AutoExtend, they present a method that decouples an object input representation into its properties, such as words and their word senses. AutoExtend uses a graph structure to map words (e.g. text) and non-word (e.g. synsets in WordNet) objects as nodes and the relationship between nodes as edges. The relations (edges) in AutoExtend can either express the addition or similarity between its nodes. The former captures the intuition behind the offset calculus, while the latter defines the similarity between two nodes. In MSSA, an unsupervised disambiguation system uses the similarity between word senses in a fixed context window to select the most suitable word sense using a pre-trained word-embedding model and WordNet. For each context window, MSSA calculates the centroid of each word sense definition by averaging the word vectors of its words in WordNet&#x27;s glosses (i.e., short defining gloss and one or more usage example) using a pre-trained word-embedding model. These centroids are later used to select the word sense with the highest similarity of a target word to its immediately adjacent neighbors (i.e., predecessor and successor words). After all words are annotated and disambiguated, they can be used as a training corpus in any standard word-embedding technique. In its improved version, MSSA can make use of word sense embeddings to repeat its disambiguation process iteratively.

===Other approaches===
Other approaches may vary differently in their methods:
* Domain-driven disambiguation;
* Identification of dominant word senses;
* WSD using Cross-Lingual Evidence.
* WSD solution in John Ball&#x27;s language independent NLU combining Patom Theory and RRG (Role and Reference Grammar)
* Type inference in constraint-based grammars

===Other languages===
* Hindi: Lack of lexical resources in Hindi have hindered the performance of supervised models of WSD, while the unsupervised models suffer due to extensive morphology. A possible solution to this problem is the design of a WSD model by means of parallel corpora. The creation of the Hindi WordNet has paved way for several Supervised methods which have been proven to produce a higher accuracy in disambiguating nouns.

===Local impediments and summary===
The knowledge acquisition bottleneck is perhaps the major impediment to solving the WSD problem. Unsupervised methods rely on knowledge about word senses, which is only sparsely formulated in dictionaries and lexical databases. Supervised methods depend crucially on the existence of manually annotated examples for every word sense, a requisite that can so far be met only for a handful of words for testing purposes, as it is done in the Senseval exercises.

One of the most promising trends in WSD research is using the largest corpus ever accessible, the World Wide Web, to acquire lexical information automatically. WSD has been traditionally understood as an intermediate language engineering technology which could improve applications such as information retrieval (IR). In this case, however, the reverse is also true: web search engines implement simple and robust IR techniques that can successfully mine the Web for information to use in WSD. The historic lack of training data has provoked the appearance of some new algorithms and techniques, as described in Automatic acquisition of sense-tagged corpora.

==External knowledge sources==
Knowledge is a fundamental component of WSD. Knowledge sources provide data which are essential to associate senses with words. They can vary from corpora of texts, either unlabeled or annotated with word senses, to machine-readable dictionaries, thesauri, glossaries, ontologies, etc. They can be classified as follows:

Structured:

# Machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs)
# Ontologies
# Thesauri

Unstructured:

# Collocation resources
# Other resources (such as word frequency lists, stoplists, domain labels, etc.)
# Corpora: raw corpora and sense-annotated corpora

== Evaluation ==
Comparing and evaluating different WSD systems is extremely difficult, because of the different test sets, sense inventories, and knowledge resources adopted. Before the organization of specific evaluation campaigns most systems were assessed on in-house, often small-scale, data sets. In order to test one&#x27;s algorithm, developers should spend their time to annotate all word occurrences. And comparing methods even on the same corpus is not eligible if there is different sense inventories.

In order to define common evaluation datasets and procedures, public evaluation campaigns have been organized. Senseval (now renamed SemEval) is an international word sense disambiguation competition, held every three years since 1998: Senseval-1 (1998), Senseval-2 (2001), (2004), and its successor, SemEval (2007). The objective of the competition is to organize different lectures, preparing and hand-annotating corpus for testing systems, perform a comparative evaluation of WSD systems in several kinds of tasks, including all-words and lexical sample WSD for different languages, and, more recently, new tasks such as semantic role labeling, gloss WSD, lexical substitution, etc. The systems submitted for evaluation to these competitions usually integrate different techniques and often combine supervised and knowledge-based methods (especially for avoiding bad performance in lack of training examples).

In recent years 2007-2012, the WSD evaluation task choices had grown and the criterion for evaluating WSD has changed drastically depending on the variant of the WSD evaluation task. Below enumerates the variety of WSD tasks:

===Task design choices===
As technology evolves, the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tasks grows in different flavors towards various research directions and for more languages:
* Classic monolingual WSD evaluation tasks use WordNet as the sense inventory and are largely based on supervised/semi-supervised classification with the manually sense annotated corpora:
** Classic English WSD uses the Princeton WordNet as it sense inventory and the primary classification input is normally based on the SemCor corpus.
** Classical WSD for other languages uses their respective WordNet as sense inventories and sense annotated corpora tagged in their respective languages. Often researchers will also tapped on the SemCor corpus and aligned bitexts with English as its source language
* Cross-lingual WSD evaluation task is also focused on WSD across 2 or more languages simultaneously. Unlike the Multilingual WSD tasks, instead of providing manually sense-annotated examples for each sense of a polysemous noun, the sense inventory is built up on the basis of parallel corpora, e.g. Europarl corpus.
* Multilingual WSD evaluation tasks focused on WSD across 2 or more languages simultaneously, using their respective WordNets as its sense inventories or BabelNet as multilingual sense inventory. It evolved from the Translation WSD evaluation tasks that took place in Senseval-2. A popular approach is to carry out monolingual WSD and then map the source language senses into the corresponding target word translations.
* Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation task is a combined task evaluation where the sense inventory is first induced from a fixed training set data, consisting of polysemous words and the sentence that they occurred in, then WSD is performed on a different testing data set.

<text>Satellite radio is defined by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)&#x27;s ITU Radio Regulations (RR) as a &quot;broadcasting-satellite service&quot;. The satellite&#x27;s signals are broadcast nationwide, across a much wider geographical area than terrestrial radio stations, and the service is primarily intended for the occupants of motor vehicles. It is available by subscription, mostly commercial free, and offers subscribers more stations and a wider variety of programming options than terrestrial radio.

Satellite radio technology was inducted into the Space Foundation Space Technology Hall of Fame in 2002. Satellite radio uses the 2.3 GHz S band in North America for nationwide digital radio broadcasting. In other parts of the world, satellite radio uses the 1.4 GHz L band allocated for DAB.

==History and overview==
The first satellite radio broadcasts occurred in Africa and the Middle East in 1999. The first US broadcasts were in 2001 followed by Japan in 2004 and Canada in 2005.

There have been three (not counting MobaHo! of Japan) major satellite radio companies: WorldSpace, Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio, all founded in the 1990s in the United States. WorldSpace operated in the Africa and Asia region, whereas Sirius and XM competed in the North American (USA and Canada) market. Of the three companies, WorldSpace went bankrupt in 2009 and Sirius and XM merged in 2008 to form Sirius XM. The merger was done to avoid bankruptcy. The new company had financial problems and was within days of bankruptcy in 2009, but was able to find investors. The company did not go bankrupt and Sirius XM Satellite radio continues () to operate.

===Africa and Eurasia===
WorldSpace was founded by Ethiopia-born lawyer Noah Samara in Washington, D.C., in 1990, with the goal of making satellite radio programming available to the developing world. On June 22, 1991, the FCC gave WorldSpace permission to launch a satellite to provide digital programming to Africa and the Middle East. WorldSpace first began broadcasting satellite radio on October 1, 1999, in Africa. India would ultimately account for over 90% of WorldSpace’s subscriber base. In 2008, WorldSpace announced plans to enter Europe, but those plans were set aside when the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2008. In March 2010, the company announced it would be de-commissioning its two satellites (one served Asia, the other served Africa). Liberty Media, which owns 50% of Sirius XM Radio, had considered purchasing WorldSpace’s assets, but talks between the companies collapsed. The satellites are now transmitting educational data and operate under the name of Yazmi USA, LLC.

Ondas Media was a Spanish company which had proposed to launch a subscription-based satellite radio system to serve Spain and much of Western Europe, but failed to acquire licenses throughout Europe.

Onde Numérique was a French company which had proposed to launch a subscription-based satellite radio system to serve France and several other countries in Western Europe but has suspended its plans indefinitely, effective December, 2016.

===United States===
Sirius Satellite Radio was founded by Martine Rothblatt, who served as the new company&#x27;s Chairman of the Board. Co-founder David Margolese served as Chief Executive Officer with former NASA engineer Robert Briskman serving as President and Chief Operating Officer. In June 1990, Rothblatt&#x27;s shell company, Satellite CD Radio, Inc., petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to assign new frequencies for satellites to broadcast digital sound to homes and cars. The company identified and argued in favor of the use of the S-band frequencies that the FCC subsequently decided to allocate to digital audio broadcasting. The National Association of Broadcasters contended that satellite radio would harm local radio stations.

In April 1992, Rothblatt resigned as CEO of Satellite CD Radio; Briskman, who designed the company&#x27;s satellite technology, was then appointed chairman and CEO. Six months later, Rogers Wireless co-founder Margolese, who had provided financial backing for the venture, acquired control of the company and succeeded Briskman. Margolese renamed the company CD Radio, and spent the next five years lobbying the FCC to allow satellite radio to be deployed, and the following five years raising $1.6 billion, which was used to build and launch three satellites into elliptical orbit from Kazakhstan in July 2000. In 1997, after Margolese had obtained regulatory clearance and &quot;effectively created the industry,&quot; the FCC also sold a license to the American Mobile Radio Corporation, which changed its name to XM Satellite Radio in October 1998. XM was founded by Lon Levin and Gary Parsons, who served as chairman until November 2009.

CD Radio purchased their license for $83.3 million, and American Mobile Radio Corporation bought theirs for $89.9 million. Digital Satellite Broadcasting Corporation and Primosphere were unsuccessful in their bids for licenses. Sky Highway Radio Corporation had also expressed interest in creating a satellite radio network, before being bought out by CD Radio in 1993 for $2 million. In November 1999, Margolese changed the name of CD Radio to Sirius Satellite Radio. In November 2001, Margolese stepped down as CEO, remaining as chairman until November 2003, with Sirius issuing a statement thanking him &quot;for his great vision, leadership and dedication in creating both Sirius and the satellite radio industry.&quot;

XM’s first satellite was launched on March 18, 2001 and its second on May 8, 2001. Its first broadcast occurred on September 25, 2001, nearly four months before Sirius. Sirius launched the initial phase of its service in four cities on February 14, 2002, expanding to the rest of the contiguous United States on July 1, 2002. The two companies spent over $3 billion combined to develop satellite radio technology, build and launch the satellites, and for various other business expenses. Stating that it was the only way satellite radio could survive, Sirius and XM announced their merger on February 19, 2007, becoming Sirius XM. The FCC approved the merger on July 25, 2008, concluding that it was not a monopoly, primarily due to Internet audio-streaming competition.

===Japan===
MobaHo! was a mobile satellite digital audio/video broadcasting service based in Japan which offered different services to Japan and the Republic of Korea and whose services began on October 20, 2004, and ended on March 31, 2009.

===Canada===
XM satellite radio was launched in Canada on November 29, 2005. Sirius followed two days later on December 1, 2005. Sirius Canada and XM Radio Canada announced their merger into Sirius XM Canada on November 24, 2010. It was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on April 12, 2011.

==System design==
Satellite radio uses the 2.3 GHz S band in North America for nationwide digital radio broadcasting. MobaHO! operated at 2.6 GHz. In other parts of the world, satellite radio uses part of the 1.4 GHz L band allocated for DAB.

Satellite radio subscribers purchase a receiver and pay a monthly subscription fee to listen to programming. They can listen through built-in or portable receivers in automobiles; in the home and office with a portable or tabletop receiver equipped to connect the receiver to a stereo system; or on the Internet. Reception is activated by obtaining the radio&#x27;s unique ID and giving this to the service provider.

Ground stations transmit signals to the satellites which are 35,786 kilometers (22,236 miles) above the Equator in geostationary orbits. The satellites send the signals back down to radio receivers in cars and homes. This signal contains scrambled broadcasts, along with meta data about each specific broadcast. The signals are unscrambled by the radio receiver modules, which display the broadcast information. In urban areas, ground repeaters enable signals to be available even if the satellite signal is blocked. The technology allows for nationwide broadcasting, so that, for instance US listeners can hear the same stations anywhere in the country.

==Content, availability and market penetration==
Satellite radio in the US offers commercial-free music stations, as well as news, sports, and talk, some of which include commercials. In 2004, satellite radio companies in the United States began providing background music to hotels, retail chains, restaurants, airlines and other businesses. On April 30, 2013, SiriusXM CEO Jim Meyer stated that the company would be pursuing opportunities over the next few years to provide in-car services through their existing satellites, including telematics (automated security and safety, such as stolen vehicle tracking and roadside assistance) and entertainment (such as weather and gas prices).

, SiriusXM had 34.7 million subscribers. This was primarily due to the company’s partnerships with automakers and car dealers. Roughly 60% of new cars sold come equipped with SiriusXM, and just under half of those units gain paid subscriptions. The company has long-term deals with General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Kia, Bentley, BMW, Volkswagen, Nissan, Hyundai and Mitsubishi. The presence of Howard Stern, whose show attracts over 12 million listeners per week, has also been a factor in the company’s steady growth. , the main competition to satellite radio is streaming Internet services, such as Pandora and Spotify, as well as FM and AM Radio.

==Satellite radio versus other formats==
Satellite radio differs from AM, FM radio, and digital television radio (DTR) in the following ways (the table applies primarily to the United States):

<doc id="67067" wikidata="Q2328859" url="?curid=67067" title="Staggers Rail Act">
<text>The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 is a United States federal law that deregulated the American railroad industry to a significant extent, and it replaced the regulatory structure that had existed since the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887.

==Background==
In the aftermath of the Great Depression and World War II, many privately owned, operated, and funded for-profit railroads were driven out of business by competition from publicly owned, operated, and funded Interstate highways, which almost always operated at a loss, and airlines, which often used airports and dispatchers (in this case air traffic control by the FAA) funded by public money. Not restricted by the requirement to break even, cars and trucks use the highway system as constructed by the state, leading to the end of passenger train service on most railroads. Trucking businesses had become major competitors by the 1930s with the advent of improved paved roads. After the war, they expanded their operations as the highway network grew and acquired increased market share of the cargo business. Railroads continued to be regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and a complex system for setting shipping rates.

The Staggers Act followed the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (often called the &quot;4R Act&quot;), which reduced federal regulation of railroads and authorized implementation details for Conrail, the new northeastern railroad system. The 4R reforms included allowance of a greater range for railroad pricing without close regulatory restraint, greater independence from collective rate making procedures in rail pricing and service offers, contract rates, and, to a lesser extent, greater freedom for entry into and exit from rail markets.

Although the 4R Act established the guidelines, the ICC at first, did not give much effect to its legislative mandates. As regulatory change began to appear from 1976 to 1979, including the phasing out of the collective ratemaking authority, most major railroads shifted away from their effort to maintain the historic regulatory system and came to support greater freedom for rail pricing, for higher and lower rail rates.

Major railroad shippers also continued to believe that they would be better served by more flexibility to arrive at tailored arrangements that were mutually beneficial to a particular shipper, and to the carrier serving a particular shipper. The judgments supported a second round of legislation.

==Summary==
The major regulatory changes of the Staggers Act were as follows:

* A rail carrier could establish any rate for a rail service unless the ICC were to determine that there was no effective competition for rail services.
* Rail shippers and rail carriers would be allowed to establish contracts subject to no effective ICC review unless the Commission determined that the contract service would interfere with the rail carrier&#x27;s ability to provide common carrier service (a finding rarely made that is not apparent in the history of the rail industry thereafter).
* The scope of authority to control rates to prevent &quot;discrimination&quot; among shippers was substantially curtailed.
* Across-the-board industry-wide rate increases were phased out.
* The dismantling of the collective rate making machinery among railroads begun in 1976 was reaffirmed, with railroads not allowed to agree to rates they could perform on their own systems and were not allowed to participate in the determination of the rates on traffic in which they did not effectively participate.

The Act also had provisions allowing the Commission to require access by one railroad to another railroad&#x27;s facilities if one railroad had effective &quot;bottleneck&quot; control of traffic. The provisions dealt with &quot;reciprocal switching&quot; (handling of railroad cars between long-haul rail carriers and local customers) and trackage rights. However, the provisions did not have as much effect as the others mentioned.

==Sponsor==
The act was named for Harley Staggers (D-WV), who chaired the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

==Impact==

Studies of the rail industry showed dramatic benefits for both railroads and their users from the alteration to the regulatory system. According to studies by the Department of Transportation&#x27;s Freight Management and Operations, railroad industry costs and prices were halved over a ten-year period, the railroads reversed their historic loss of traffic (as measured by ton-miles) to the trucking industry, and railroad industry profits began to recover, after decades of low profits and widespread railroad insolvencies. In 2007 the Government Accountability Office reported to Congress, &quot;The railroad industry is increasingly healthy and rail rates have generally declined since 1985, despite recent rate increases... There is widespread consensus that the freight rail industry has benefited from the Staggers Rail Act.&quot;

The Association of American Railroads, the principal railroad industry trade association, stated that the Staggers Act has led to a 51 percent reduction in average shipping rates, and $480 billion has been reinvested by the industry into their rail systems.

==Related deregulatory legislation==
The Staggers Act was one of three major deregulation laws passed by Congress in a two-year period, as the cumulative result of efforts to reform transport regulation begun in 1971, during the Nixon administration. The other two laws were the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 and the Motor Carrier Act of 1980. This legislation in effect superseded almost a century of detailed regulation begun with the establishment of the ICC in 1887. The Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 abolished the ICC and created its successor agency, the Surface Transportation Board, an administrative affiliate of the United States Department of Transportation.

<text>The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, often called the &quot;4R Act,&quot; is a United States federal law that established the basic outlines of regulatory reform in the railroad industry and provided transitional operating funds following the 1970 bankruptcy of Penn Central Transportation Company. The law approved the &quot;Final System Plan&quot; for the newly created Conrail and authorized acquisition of Northeast Corridor tracks and facilities by Amtrak.

The Act was the first in a series of laws which collectively are described as the deregulation of transportation in the United States. It was followed by the Airline Deregulation Act (1978), Staggers Rail Act (1980), and the Motor Carrier Act of 1980.

==Background==
Following the massive bankruptcy of the Penn Central in 1970, Congress created Amtrak to take over the failed company&#x27;s intercity passenger train service, under the Rail Passenger Service Act. Congress passed the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (the &quot;3R Act&quot;) to salvage viable freight operations from Penn Central and other failing rail lines in the northeast, mid-Atlantic and midwestern regions, through the creation of Conrail. Conrail began operations in 1976.

==Summary==
* Implementation of the Conrail &quot;Final System Plan,&quot; as formulated by the United States Railway Association, and which specified the rail lines that Conrail would receive
* Provision of operating funds for Conrail, which had not received direct federal funds under the 3R Act. Initial funding for 1976 was $484 million (in 1986 dollars)
* Amtrak could acquire rights of way, tracks, and related facilities (such as train stations) for the Northeast Corridor (NEC) rail line between Washington, D.C. and Boston
* Initial funds were provided to Amtrak of approximately $85.2 million for the NEC acquisition.
* Federal regulation of railroads was reduced significantly for the first time since passage of the 1887 Interstate Commerce Act.

The &quot;Declaration of policy&quot; in the Act (Section 101), was as follows:
The financial assistance provisions of the act were largely palliative and transitional. They were extended on the condition that changes in the regulatory system governing railroads be enacted, with the hope that a regulatory system which gave railroads more freedom in pricing and service arrangements, subject to greater competitive constraints, would yield a more viable industry and better service for its users. Studies of the legislative history of the Act indicate that the Gerald Ford administration secured the regulatory provisions only by threatening a veto of any act containing financial assistance for railroads but no reform of the regulatory system.

The changes in regulation provided for were as follows:
*Section 202 provided that rail rates would not be considered ‘unjust and unreasonable’ if they exceeded long run marginal costs (on the low side) and (as to the high side) applied to traffic as to which the railroads did not have ‘market dominance’ (a term related to concepts of monopoly power). The railroads were to be allowed to explore this ‘zone of reasonableness’, with presumptions against suspension or challenge of proposed rates, at a rate of 7% per year.
*Section 206 provided for, in substance, contract rates for transactions involving an investment of more than $1 million.
*Section 207 provided the Commission with authority to exempt from regulation entirely categories of traffic, upon making findings in substance that regulation was unnecessary.
*Section 208 prohibited collective rate making on movements which a rail carrier could handle entirely on its own system (‘single line rates’), and buttressed the right of ‘independent action’ by rail carriers.

In a signing statement, President Ford stated,
==Reaction==

Many members of the ICC strongly opposed the Act. The regulatory provisions had been enacted over several commissioners&#x27; objections, and the Commission&#x27;s implementation of the Act initially had little impact on the way the rail industry functioned.

When President Jimmy Carter nominated A. Daniel O&#x27;Neal, originally appointed by President Richard Nixon, to chair the ICC, O’Neal began to develop the possibilities for opening up the rail market to competition. Also, in 1978 a group of major railroads formed an organization called TRAIN (Transportation by Rail for Agricultural and Industrial Needs) to support further deregulation of the industry. The carriers&#x27; perception was that with collective rate making limited, and a Commission apparently more interested in letting their rates go down than go up, the regulatory system no longer favored them.

Large shippers of goods by rail also wished to have more flexibility in the rail market. The result of this alignment between carriers, the shippers, and the Carter administration’s ICC, was the Staggers Act of 1980. The Staggers Act extended the principles of the 4R Act. One of the key changes from the 1976 Act was allowance of secret contracts between carriers and shippers, not limited to large-investment situations and not effectively subject to regulatory review. According to former Congressional Budget Office analyst Christopher Barnekov, such contracts allowed rail carriers and shippers much to develop more efficient transport arrangements.

<doc id="67069" wikidata="Q2000355" url="?curid=67069" title="Wesley Crusher">
<text>Wesley Crusher is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. He appears regularly in the first four seasons of the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (&quot;TNG&quot;), and sporadically in its next three seasons. He also appeared in the feature film &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; (2002) in one episode apiece of the television series &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; (2022) and &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; (2023), and as a recurring character in season 2 of &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot; (2024). He is the son of Beverly Crusher and Jack Crusher and is portrayed by actor Wil Wheaton.

==Overview==

===Television series and films===
In the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, Wesley Crusher first arrives on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D with his mother, soon after Captain Jean-Luc Picard assumes command. Crusher&#x27;s father was killed while under Picard&#x27;s command, with Picard delivering the message to Wesley and to his mother, Beverly. Picard initially found Wesley irritating, as he is often uncomfortable around children, a fact he discloses to his first officer, Commander William Riker, in the pilot episode &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;.

In early episodes of the series, Picard does not allow Wesley on the ship&#x27;s bridge. However, during the first season, Picard comes to realize that Wesley understands many things beyond his age, having inherited his mother&#x27;s intelligence, and grants him more opportunities onboard. An alien known as the Traveler tells Captain Picard that Wesley possesses a unique intelligence and great potential when provided encouragement and opportunity, comparing him to a child prodigy like Mozart. Picard soon appoints Crusher as acting ensign.

In the episode &quot;Coming of Age&quot;, Crusher takes the Starfleet Academy entrance exam, but fails to pass it. In the episode &quot;Ménage à Troi&quot;, he misses his second chance to take the exam; but when he helps the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D crew rescue Riker, Deanna Troi and Lwaxana Troi from hostile Ferengi, Picard grants him a field promotion to full ensign.

In the third-season episode &quot;The Bonding&quot;, Crusher reveals that following his father&#x27;s death, he felt animosity towards Picard, because Picard was in command of the &quot;Stargazer&quot; during the mission in which Wesley&#x27;s father was killed. By the end of the episode, he no longer harbors these feelings.

The following year, Crusher is invited to re-take the Academy exam. He is accepted, and joins an elite group of cadets known as Nova Squadron. In the fifth-season episode &quot;The First Duty&quot;, a squadron-mate is killed attempting a dangerous and prohibited flight maneuver and, under pressure from the team&#x27;s leader, Nick Locarno, Crusher abets the squadron&#x27;s efforts to cover up the truth. Although the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew&#x27;s intervention and Crusher&#x27;s own testimony saves him from expulsion, Crusher&#x27;s academic credits for the year are revoked; he is required to repeat the year and graduate after most of the rest of his class. He remains in the Academy until the Traveler recontacts him in a later season 7 episode, &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, where he resigns his commission and goes with the Traveler to explore other planes of reality.

Crusher is next seen sitting next to his mother in the background of the wedding scenes in the feature film &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;. In a scene deleted from the film, Captain Picard asks Crusher if he is excited to serve on board the USS &quot;Titan&quot; (Captain Riker&#x27;s ship). Crusher tells him that he will be running the night shift in Engineering, which would have indicated that Wesley returned to Starfleet prior to the events of the film and held the rank of Lieutenant.

Crusher returns in the &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; season 2 episode &quot;Farewell&quot;. In the years since &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, he has rejoined the Travelers, traveling across space and time. In the year 2024, he approaches Kore Soong and reveals that he and his fellow Travelers were responsible for creating the Supervisors and the Watchers to help ensure the universe&#x27;s survival. He offers Kore a position with the Travelers, although he can&#x27;t guarantee her safety, and she accepts.

Crusher returns in the second season of &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot; where he tries to help the young crew of the &quot;Protostar&quot; rescue Captain Chakotay from the future and then to deal with their inadvertent alterations to the timeline. In the first half of the season, Crusher acts from the shadows, sending disguised messages to the crew. Crusher eventually brings the young cadets to meet him in person, explaining that the temporal paradox is destroying their universe and while the other Travelers have abandoned it as a lost cause, Crusher is unwilling to give up on the universe that was his home and more importantly where his mother still lives. Crusher reveals that having studied billions of possible futures, there is only one where life in the galaxy doesn&#x27;t end in endless suffering and that involves the seven cadets sticking together. As extra-dimensional scavengers called the Loom move to destroy the universe, Crusher helps the cadets find the &quot;Protostar&quot; and vanishes after promising to distract the Loom to buy them time.

In the second half of the season, Crusher is captured by Asencia and his mind probed to create temporal weaponry that she intends to use to destroy the Federation in a war. Crusher is eventually rescued by the cadets, but reveals that he had allowed himself to be captured in order to guide Asencia into creating the technology that they will need to send the &quot;Protostar&quot; back in time and restore the timeline. Although the Doctor is able to treat Crusher&#x27;s injuries, the damage to his brain puts Crusher&#x27;s Traveler powers out of commission for the time being. Working with Janeway to rescue the cadets, Crusher struggles to adjust to not being able to rely on his powers before Janeway reminds him that Crusher was a Starfleet officer before he was a Traveler and his natural talents are more valuable to them than his space-time powers. Given a confidence boost, Crusher plays a pivotal role in the rescue mission using his skills as a pilot and later his intellect to reprogram a tricorder to remotely bring their ship in for departure. Crusher later helps to figure out how to open the wormhole and chooses to accompany the &quot;Protostar&quot; along with the crew to see the mission through. Privately, Crusher reveals to Dal R&#x27;El that the important thing that he had predicted for the group to do that will shape the future of the galaxy is still yet to come. After the crisis is over, Crusher visits his mother for the first time in years and is introduced to his little brother Jack, having been rebuked by Janeway for not seeing his mother more often.

==Reception==
The Wesley Crusher character was unpopular among some &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans. Many considered the character a Mary Sue, and a stand-in for Gene Roddenberry (whose middle name was Wesley). The character&#x27;s role in the show was greatly downplayed after the first season when Roddenberry&#x27;s involvement in the show&#x27;s production became more peripheral.

Some fans disliked the idea of a boy who seemed to regularly save the whole ship using a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; plot device. Commentators have observed at least seven times in which Crusher, &quot;who has trouble getting into the Starfleet Academy&quot; and is on a ship &quot;filled with Starfleet&#x27;s best and brightest crew members&quot;, has come up with &quot;the needed solution&quot;. Fans&#x27; dislike for Crusher has become something of a pop-culture meme, reflected in other TV shows such as &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, the English dub of &quot;Steins;Gate&quot;, and in a 2009 &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode, &quot;Not All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot;, which included the main &quot;The Next Generation&quot; cast and featured Wil Wheaton in character as Crusher being bullied by Patrick Stewart.

Wheaton wrote: &quot;When I was younger, people gave me such a hard time about Wesley Crusher, there was a time in my late teens and early twenties when I resented &quot;Star Trek&quot;. It felt so unfair that people who had never met me were so cruel and hateful toward me as a person because they didn’t like a character I played on a TV show, I wanted to put &quot;Star Trek&quot; behind me and forget that it was ever part of my life.&quot;

In a 2016 issue of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, Wesley Crusher was ranked 31st of the 100 most important Starfleet characters in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe.

<text>Natasha &quot;Tasha&quot; Yar is a fictional character that mainly appeared in the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Portrayed by Denise Crosby, Yar is chief of security aboard the Starfleet starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D and carries the rank of lieutenant.

The character first appeared in the series&#x27; pilot episode, &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;. After Crosby decided to leave the series, Yar was killed in the episode &quot;Skin of Evil&quot; near the end of the series&#x27; first season. She was written back into the series for a guest appearance in the third season episode &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enterprise&quot;, in which her character was still alive in an alternate timeline, and again in the final episode of the series &quot;All Good Things...&quot;, which included events set prior to the pilot.

Yar was described as a forerunner to other strong women in science fiction, such as Kara Thrace from the 2004 version of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, while providing a step between the appearances of female characters on &quot;The Original Series&quot; to the command positions they have on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot;. Questions were raised over the sexuality of the character, and it was thought that the events in the episode &quot;The Naked Now&quot; were designed to establish her heterosexuality.

==Concept and development==
Inspired by Vasquez in &quot;Aliens&quot;, the character was initially named &quot;Macha Hernandez&quot; and was the tactical officer of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. This had been changed by the first casting call—issued on December 10, 1986—when she was given the position of security chief. The producers considered Jenette Goldstein, who had played Vasquez, for the role, but writer Dorothy Fontana pointed out that the actress &quot;is not Latina. She is petite, blue-eyed, freckle-faced&quot;. The character was subsequently renamed &quot;Tanya&quot; around March 13.
By the time that the writers&#x27; and directors&#x27; guide for the series was published, dated March 23, 1987, the character was named Natasha &quot;Tasha&quot; Yar. Her surname was suggested by Robert Lewin, drawing inspiration from the Babi Yar atrocities in Ukraine during the Second World War. Her biography stated that she was 28 years old, and confirmed her Ukrainian descent. She was planned to have a friendship with teenager Wesley Crusher, and was described in the guide as &quot;treat[ing] this boy like the most wonderful person imaginable. Wes is the childhood friend that Tasha never had.&quot;

In April 1987, Lianne Langland, Julia Nickson, Rosalind Chao, Leah Ayres, and Bunty Bailey were each listed as being in contention for the role. Chao was a favorite candidate, while Denise Crosby was described as &quot;the only possibility&quot; for the character of Deanna Troi. The production staff were not keen on having two actresses in the bridge crew roles with similar physical types and hair colors, and so the team took account of the casting of the two roles together. The writers and directors guide described Yar as having a muscular but very feminine body type, and being sufficiently athletic to defeat most other crew members in martial arts. After Crosby and Marina Sirtis had each auditioned for Troi and Yar respectively, Gene Roddenberry decided to switch the actresses and cast Crosby as Tasha Yar. He felt that Sirtis&#x27; appearance was better suited to the &quot;exotic&quot; Troi.

==Resolution==
Before the end of the first season, Crosby asked to be released from her contract as she was unhappy that her character was not being developed. She later said &quot;I was miserable. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get off that show. I was dying&quot;. Roddenberry agreed to her request and she left on good terms. The final episode she filmed was &quot;Symbiosis&quot;, which was completed after Yar&#x27;s death in &quot;Skin of Evil&quot;. Her last scene was during the final act of the episode, in which a holographic farewell recording of her is played for the bridge crew. After her departure, archive footage of Crosby as Yar was used in the episodes &quot;The Schizoid Man&quot; and &quot;Shades of Gray&quot;. In a later retrospective, Crosby noted that the producers loved the character of Tasha Yar, despite the scripts of the first season failing to do much with the character. She speculated that her departure (and the departure of Gates McFadden) might have saved Marina Sirtis&#x27;s then-tenuous position, as the producers had to avoid a situation where all three of the lead female actresses of season 1 were dismissed in season 2.

Crosby was happy to return in &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enterprise&quot; due to the strength of the script, saying that &quot;I had more to do in that episode than I&#x27;d ever had to do before&quot;. Prior to the episode being aired, the media had to be reassured that Yar was not returning in a dream sequence. Crosby later said that she was impressed with the changes wrought by Michael Piller as showrunner in the third season. Following her appearance in that episode, Crosby pitched the idea of Yar&#x27;s daughter, Sela, to the producers. She made her first appearance in this role in the two-part &quot;Redemption&quot; and appeared once more in another two-part episode, &quot;Unification&quot;. Denise returned twice more in the non-canon &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. In 2007, she appeared as an ancestor of Tasha Yar, Jenna Yar, in &quot;Blood and Fire&quot;, an episode of the fan-produced series &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot;. Tasha Yar was written into &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; as part of the third anniversary celebration in 2013. Denise Crosby recorded audio for the game, in scenes set after those in &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enterprise&quot;.

==Appearances==
Natasha Yar&#x27;s origins are explained in the season four episode &quot;Legacy&quot;. She was born on the planet Turkana IV in 2337. She had a younger sister named Ishara, who was born five years after her. Shortly after Ishara&#x27;s birth, the girls&#x27; parents were killed and they were taken in by other people; however, they were subsequently abandoned and Tasha was required to look after her sister on her own. The government on the planet had collapsed, and the sisters were forced to scavenge for food while avoiding rape gangs. In 2352, aged 15, Tasha managed to leave Turkana IV. She never saw Ishara again; the latter joined the &quot;Coalition&quot;, one of the factions on the planet before Tasha left. Tasha refused to join the cadres on the planet, blaming them for her parents&#x27; deaths.

Yar appeared for the first time in the pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; as the Security and Tactical Officer on board the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. When Captain Picard orders an emergency saucer separation, Yar is one of the bridge crew to accompany him to the battle bridge. She is amongst the crew abducted by Q, and later serves on the away team to Farpoint Station. In &quot;The Naked Now&quot;, while the crew are under the influence of an alien ailment, she initiates a sexual encounter with the android Data. In &quot;Code of Honor&quot; Yar is abducted by Lutan, the leader of the planet Ligon II, after she demonstrates her combat skills on the holodeck. She kills Lutan&#x27;s wife Yareena in ritual combat to the death, though Yareena is revived on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; by Doctor Crusher. During the events of &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot;, Yar begins to hallucinate that she is back on Turkana IV and running for her life. In &quot;The Arsenal of Freedom&quot;, Yar and Data are trapped together on the surface of the planet Minos and are attacked by a series of sentry probes that adapt to Data and Yar&#x27;s phasers. The situation is resolved by Captain Picard, who is trapped elsewhere on the planet&#x27;s surface with Dr. Crusher.

Yar forms part of the away team that beams down to Vagra II to rescue Deanna Troi from a crashed shuttlecraft in &quot;Skin of Evil&quot;. She is killed by the creature Armus in a display of his power. The crew hold a memorial service for her on the holodeck, and Worf replaces her as chief tactical and security officer. After her death it is revealed that Data keeps a small hologram of her in his quarters. Despite Data&#x27;s lack of emotions, he is described by reviewers as being sentimentally attached to her image. During the court hearing on Data&#x27;s stature as a sentient being in &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot;, he explains that he and Yar were intimate and that she was special to him.

After the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-C emerges from a rift in space-time in &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enterprise&quot;, the timeline is changed and Yar is once again alive and in her former position on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. She works with the older Enterprise&#x27;s helmsman, Richard Castillo, and the two become close. Guinan, who has some awareness of the timeline that would be restored by the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-C returning into the rift, confides in Yar that she believes that Yar died senselessly in that timeline. Based on that advice, Yar transfers to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-C and returns with it to two decades into the past, and its expected destruction at the hands of the Romulans while defending the Klingon outpost Narendra III. The alternative universe version of Yar traveled back in time on board the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-C, and into the main timeline. This process was later described as &quot;world jumping&quot; rather than a typical timeline travel story by critics.

Yar&#x27;s half-Romulan daughter Sela explains in &quot;Redemption&quot; that several members of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-C crew were captured by the Romulans when it returned through the rift, including Yar. A Romulan general offered to spare the crew&#x27;s lives if she became his consort. After a year, Yar gave birth to Sela. When Sela was four, Yar attempted to escape but Sela screamed to prevent her from being taken away from her father. After she was caught, Yar was executed.

The series finale &quot;All Good Things...&quot; includes Yar&#x27;s final appearance, in scenes that take place prior to and in the early parts of &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;. As most of the bridge crew are yet to join the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D in the scenes, Yar is one of the senior members of the crew under Captain Picard in the earliest of the three timeframes in the episode. She needs to be convinced by Picard to put the ship in danger in order to destroy the temporal anti-time anomaly that threatens to prevent life from evolving on Earth.

Yar appeared for a brief but prominent moment of Picard, Season 3, episode 8 &quot;Surrender&quot; as a visual representation of Commander Data&#x27;s memory.

In the &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; season 5 episode &quot;Fully Dilated,&quot; an alternate universe version of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D briefly falls through a rift into the prime universe in 2382. Captain Carol Freeman of the USS &quot;Cerritos&quot; mentions that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crossed universes &quot;while battling some evil clones of Tasha Yar, or something,&quot; but she can&#x27;t remember the exact details.

==Reception and commentary==

Science fiction writer Keith DeCandido considered Yar the most interesting role to appear in the &quot;writer&#x27;s bible&quot;, while Hal Boedeker characterized her as &quot;forceful&quot; in an article on women in &quot;Star Trek&quot; for &quot;Knight Ridder&quot;. A Den of Geek article by Martin Anderson also about women in &quot;Star Trek&quot; described the character as a predecessor to Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace in the 2004 re-imagining of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. A &quot;Post-Tribune&quot; review of the series following the pilot described Yar as a &quot;tough cookie&quot; and the reviewer&#x27;s favorite crew member. Frank Oglesbee, in his article on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; Kira Nerys, outlined the progression of female roles in &quot;gender assumptions&quot; from &quot;The Original Series&quot; where women were on the bridge, through Tasha Yar in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; where they were in command positions, to &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot; where women were in lead roles. He noted specifically that women appeared in command positions more regularly as main and supporting characters, and were portrayed as more assertive and combative, with leading roles in action sequences.

Reviewers have questioned the character&#x27;s sexuality since the end of the series. &quot;Curve&quot; magazine speculated that Yar was a &quot;closeted&quot; lesbian. In the book &quot;Science Fiction Audiences: Watching Doctor Who and Star Trek&quot;, the authors describe her as &quot;an obvious bisexual&quot;, but that &quot;she should be a lesbian&quot;. Referring to the events in &quot;The Naked Now&quot;, the authors explain &quot;when they decided to straighten her, they used an android. So we ended up heterosexualizing two perfectly wonderful characters&quot;. The authors of the book &quot;Deep Space and Sacred Time: Star Trek in the American Mythos&quot; also thought that having Data and Yar consummate sexually was a means to state early on in the series the heterosexuality of the two most androgynous characters in the show.

Fans responded negatively to the departure of Yar as they felt that the character had potential for future expansion. Reviewers were also critical of the manner of Yar&#x27;s death. Keith DeCandido called it &quot;pointless&quot;, but thought that it was no worse than the deaths of other security officer &quot;redshirts&quot; throughout the history of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. He said that he preferred her death in &quot;Skin of Evil&quot; to the &quot;clichéd-up-the-wazoo&quot; death she experienced in &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enterprise&quot;. Gary Westfahl, in his book &quot;Space and Beyond: The Frontier Theme in Science Fiction&quot;, described Yar&#x27;s death as one of the most notable ones in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, alongside that of Spock in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; and James T. Kirk in &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;. &quot;SFX&quot; magazine included her first death in a 2012 list of the top 21 &quot;Naff Sci-Fi Deaths&quot;, while the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described her death in &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enterprise&quot; as a &quot;hero&#x27;s death&quot;.

<doc id="67073" wikidata="Q629953" url="?curid=67073" title="Ro Laren">
<text>Ro Laren is a fictional character appearing on a recurring basis in the fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons of the American science-fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. The character returned for the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;. Portrayed by Michelle Forbes, she is a member of the Bajoran species who joins the crew of the USS &quot;Enterprise-D&quot; over the fervent objection of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), who cited her previous court-martial. Ro, too, was against joining the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew, but said, &quot;It is better than prison.&quot; The character was intended both to be at odds with the series regulars and to replace Wesley Crusher in the conn officer post on the bridge. Forbes was cast to portray Ro after previously appearing in the series as Dara in the episode &quot;Half a Life&quot;.

The character first appears in the fifth-season episode &quot;Ensign Ro&quot;, which reveals elements of Ro&#x27;s backstory. She continues to appear throughout that season, and makes a further appearance in both the sixth and seventh seasons. Starfleet sought her aid to help the Cardassians apprehend a Bajoran terrorist. After joining the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew, she wants to abandon the engineering section of the vessel following a series of power failures in &quot;Disaster&quot;. Alongside Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), she is affected by a Romulan experiment in &quot;The Next Phase&quot;, and must help prevent the aliens from destroying the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. In &quot;Rascals&quot;, she is among the crew who are transformed into children and helps prevent a Ferengi plot. When making her final appearance in &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot;, she is tasked by Starfleet to infiltrate the Maquis, eventually defecting and joining them permanently.

Ro was also planned to be a main character in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, but Forbes turned down the role, so Kira Nerys was created to replace her. Reviewers discussed Ro&#x27;s religious views, comparing them to those of Kira. Ro was received positively by both critics and fans alike. Critics have praised Forbes&#x27;s performance and Ro&#x27;s interaction with the existing characters. She has been placed in several polls listing the most popular characters, with Jordan Hoffman calling her the second-strongest supporting female character in the franchise.

Ro, again played by Forbes, returned for the third season of &quot;Picard&quot; in the episode &quot;Imposters&quot;, serving as a commander for Starfleet Intelligence.

==Concept and development==
During the course of planning out the fifth season of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, the producers were looking to add a recurring character who could conflict with the regular cast at times, as well as a new conn officer to replace Wesley Crusher. With that in mind, the episode &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; was written by Michael Piller, from a story idea created in conjunction with Rick Berman, to specifically introduce the character of Ensign Ro Laren. The episode was designed to show a backstory for the character, who would be at odds with series creator Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s ideal that Starfleet officers should all work together seamlessly. One of her major character traits was that she would be a member of an oppressed people, whose homeworld had been conquered by another. Supervising producer Jeri Taylor explained that they had sought to add some &quot;fresh life&quot; using a darker character. 

Michelle Forbes was asked to return to the series, after impressing the producers with her performance as Dara in the episode &quot;Half a Life&quot;. The character was the daughter of Timicin, played by David Ogden Stiers, and supported the tradition that her father should commit ritual suicide upon reaching a certain age. The Bajoran make-up was created on her, with Michael Westmore seeking to make her look different from the rest of the crew, but in a way that would not detract from her appearance. Westmore created an appliance over Forbes&#x27; nose, before adding a row of ridges on her face. It was designed to be light and flexible, as he wanted the piece to move with Forbes&#x27; facial expressions. Her version of the make-up had seven ridges, while other actors in &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; had different numbers, between five and nine, with the male actors wearing larger pieces.

Piller described the addition of Ro to the cast as one of that season&#x27;s biggest accomplishments, and was pleased that it was well received. He added that in &quot;Ensign Ro&quot;, they made a deliberate decision to have Ro embraced by Guinan to ensure that the fans warmed to the new addition. Piller felt that when Guinan took Ro to meet Captain Picard in that episode, the character was effectively presenting Ro to the fans of the series and endorsing her. During the writing process, he felt that once he came across the friendship between Guinan and Ro, he believed &quot;we had really done something magnificent&quot;. Forbes, meanwhile, praised the writing and the cast of the series, saying that she had &quot;become very attached to &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot;.

Piller was disappointed with the following Ro episode, &quot;Disaster&quot;, as it put her in the position of disbelieving Counselor Deanna Troi without having had the weight of &quot;victories&quot; in the past to convince the viewer of the power of her convictions. She enjoyed her sudden relationship with Commander William Riker in &quot;Conundrum&quot;. Forbes shared the view of that episode, later saying: &quot;When you have amnesia, you wonder if that brings out a side of you that&#x27;s always wanted to come out. Would you really be comfortable with that? It&#x27;s an interesting thing. I had a really good time with that episode.&quot; Later in the season, &quot;The Next Phase&quot; was written with the idea of being a vehicle for Geordi La Forge and Troi, but it was decided to include Ro, instead, as one of the lead characters. Ro had been included as one of three lead characters in Morgan Gendel&#x27;s original pitch for the episode &quot;The Inner Light&quot;. This would have seen her in a love triangle with Picard and Riker. Instead, the concept was redeveloped to focus solely on Picard.

Ro made a single appearance in the sixth season, in the episode &quot;Rascals&quot;, in which a transporter accident reverts Ro and three others into adolescents, with the younger version of Ro portrayed by Megan Parlen. Some consideration arose after the episode about whether or not to keep Ro as a child, as her return to adulthood was never shown on screen. Taylor said that the change would have been &quot;too drastic for us&quot;, and the idea was abandoned. Her final appearance, in the penultimate episode of the series, &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot;, had been considered a long shot by the producers. After the failure to agree to her appearances on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, Forbes&#x27; agent had warned them to stay away from her. A week prior to filming, no story was created for the episode other than the idea it would follow on from the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;The Maquis&quot;, and no agreement had been reached with Forbes to appear. Her agent indicated that Forbes wanted to talk directly to the producers, so she made the phone call, making up a story for the episode as the conversation went on. Forbes agreed, making her final appearance in the franchise. The character was promoted to lieutenant, and Forbes wore updated Bajoran make-up developed by Westmore for &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;===
&quot;Ensign Ro&quot; influenced the creation of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, with the Bajorans and Cardassians taken directly from the episode. The character was included in the original series description, stationed on the Bajor-based Starfleet station, and the producers had planned for her to be promoted to lieutenant in an episode of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; prior to the start of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. Taylor had expected Ro to be written out of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, so had taken some steps to see that the character was replaced. She said, &quot;We all just love Michelle Forbes&quot;, but the plans to replace Ro would not seek to add someone with the type of fire shown by the character in such episodes as &quot;The Next Phase&quot;. She also said that if Ro were to remain on &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, then the character would have naturally evolved away from that conflicted position, anyway.

The intention was that Ro would be one of a handful of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; characters moving over to the new series, alongside Miles and Keiko O&#x27;Brien. At this stage, the other characters were only described as a wheelchair-using science officer, a brash doctor, a civilian law enforcer, a bar owner and the station commander and his son. Ro&#x27;s position on the station would have been to act as the liaison between the station and the Bajoran government. As described in the series bible, the producers had planned for Ro to be a point of conflict with &quot;by-the-book Starfleet officers&quot;. Regarding the other main characters, she was planned to have a friendship with Odo and be mentored by Jadzia Dax.

Both Berman and Piller sought to have Forbes sign on to portray Ro as a main character in the series, but she turned them down. She liked making occasional appearances on &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, but did not want to tie herself down to a five- to six-year main-cast contract at that point in her career. She was also apprehensive about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series, and did not want to undertake the level of appearances that would be expected of a main cast member in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. The producers of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; decided to create a new character to fit a similar mold, which resulted in the creation of Kira Nerys, who was played by Nana Visitor. This was designed to require as minimal a change as possible in the premise of the pilot at that time, which was already under production. During the course of the series, Forbes told interviewers that she was interested in making one-off appearances in the series if she liked the story and role.

==Appearances==

===Background===
In accordance with Bajoran tradition, her family name precedes her personal name. When she first joins the crew of the &quot;Enterprise-D&quot; during the course of &quot;Ensign Ro&quot;, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) addresses her as &quot;Ensign Laren&quot;. She corrects him, saying that Laren is her given name and Ro is her family name. She is then referred to as &quot;Ensign Ro&quot;. Over the course of her several appearances in &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, information is revealed about her backstory. Bajor had been under the occupation of the Cardassians during her early life, and at the age of seven, she watched as one of the occupiers tortured her father to death. This led to a lifelong hatred of Cardassians.

Ro joined Starfleet, and after being posted to the USS &quot;Wellington&quot;, she formed part of an away team. During that mission, she disobeyed orders, resulting in the death of eight crewmen. She was subsequently court-martialled and was imprisoned on Jaros II. Admiral Kennelly (Cliff Potts) later gave her a pardon and allowed her to return to Starfleet service in return for convincing Bajoran terrorist Orta (Jeffrey Hayenga) to call off his attacks after a raid on a Federation colony. He brings her to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; for the purpose of completing this mission.

===&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;===
As shown in &quot;Ensign Ro&quot;, during an away-team mission to capture Orta, Ro manages to get the team taken hostage. As a result, Picard confines her to her quarters, but discovers that the Bajorans were not responsible for the attack on the Federation colony, and Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) convinces Ro to tell Picard of Kennelly&#x27;s plan. Ro was under orders to offer arms to Orta to trick him into revealing his presence so the Cardassians can destroy his vessel. At that point, Kennelly would intervene and order Picard not to intervene to keep the peace treaty with the Cardassians. Picard allows the plan to proceed, but the Cardassians destroy an empty ship before revealing that they had staged the attack to enlist aid against the Bajorans. At the conclusion of the episode, Picard offers Ro a position on the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which she accepts.

In &quot;Disaster&quot;, Ro is one of the crew trapped on the bridge of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; when it undergoes a series of power failures. The ship is placed at risk of destruction because of the potential failure of the containment fields on the antimatter pods. Ro argues that they need to separate the saucer section to save those on board it, since they have no way of knowing if anyone is still alive on the engineering part of the vessel. When the crew undergoes group amnesia in &quot;Conundrum&quot;, Ro and Riker act on a mutual attraction until their memories are restored. In &quot;The Next Phase&quot;, Ro and La Forge apparently die after a transporter accident after returning from a Romulan Warbird, but they have suffered the side effects of a Romulan cloaking experiment. Ro initially questions whether or not she has died and is now in the afterlife, but together with La Forge, she discovers a Romulan plot. Defeating a similarly cloaked Romulan operative, Ro and La Forge alert the crew and return to normal, warning Picard and averting disaster.

In the episode &quot;Rascals&quot;, Ro, Picard, Guinan, and Keiko O&#x27;Brien (Rosalind Chao) are transformed into adolescent versions of themselves while retaining their adult intelligence. As children, they foil a Ferengi plot to steal the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and sell the crew as slave labor.

In her final episode, &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot;, Ro returns to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; as a lieutenant after spending a year at Starfleet Advanced Tactical Training. During the course of her training, her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Chakotay, resigns from Starfleet to join the Maquis when his father is killed by the Cardassians. She is asked by Starfleet to infiltrate the rebel Maquis, who are undermining the Federation treaty with Cardassia. During the mission, she finds her loyalties in conflict with her duties, as she becomes increasingly sympathetic to the plight of the Maquis. Despite Picard&#x27;s effort to force her to do her duty, she joins the rebel group. Riker says she seemed pretty sure she was doing the right thing, though she regrets disappointing Picard. Clearly wounded by Ro&#x27;s betrayal, Picard remains silent.

===&quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;===
Ro later returns in &quot;Imposters&quot;, the fifth episode of the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;. Since leaving the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Ro had turned herself in to Starfleet and was recruited by Starfleet Intelligence due to her experience with infiltrating terrorist organizations. She arrives on the &quot;Titan-A&quot; to presumably interrogate Picard and Riker for hijacking the ship, but after a heated exchange with Picard over her betrayal, reveals she is investigating the changelings and believes Starfleet has been compromised at the highest levels. Ro gives Picard a head start to get away, but is betrayed by her security team, actually changelings in disguise, and sacrifices herself to cripple the &quot;Intrepid&quot; to allow the &quot;Titan-A&quot; to escape, but not before giving Picard her Bajoran earring, revealed by Riker to be a data chip containing files on her entire investigation. An incoming transmission reveals that she was Worf and Raffi&#x27;s mysterious handler. Before her death, Picard and Ro manage to come to terms with her betrayal, with Picard finally coming to understand her decisions. Her death greatly affects Picard.

===Noncanonical appearances===
Ro makes a series of appearances in the noncanonical novel series based on &quot;The Next Generation&quot;. Her first appearance is in the novel, &quot;War Drums&quot;, by John Vorholt, published in 1992, which chronicles a mission to a planet called Selva, and Ro plays a major role. Also included is an expansion on her background and early life in the book &quot;Night of the Wolves&quot; by S. D. Perry and Britta Dennison. The events of the away mission while she was serving on the USS &quot;Wellington&quot; were shown in the second special issue of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;The Next Generation&quot; series. Ro&#x27;s career with the Maquis is also chronicled in the novels. In &quot;Rogue Saucer&quot;, she is responsible for planning out the attack on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; in which the Maquis steal a prototype saucer section. Ro appears in the novel &quot;Tunnel Through the Stars&quot;, set during the events of the Dominion War. Ro and the remaining Maquis join forces with Picard and the &quot;Enterprise-E&quot; to defeat the Dominion forces that are attempting to build an artificial wormhole to bypass the one near &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;.

She began to appear in the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; relaunch novels beginning with the two-part &quot;Avatar&quot; by Perry. The relaunch novels show the events that occur after the final episode of the television series. In &quot;Avatar&quot;, Ro enlists in the Bajoran Militia with the rank of lieutenant, and is assigned to &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; as the new security chief under the command of Colonel Kira. This move for Ro is also chronicled in the background to the massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;.

In &quot;Twilight&quot; by David R. George III, the first part of the &quot;Mission: Gamma&quot; miniseries, Quark and Ro start to develop romantic feelings for each other. In Perry&#x27;s &quot;Unity&quot;, Ro rejoins Starfleet after Bajor joins the Federation and its military forces are merged. She is initially apprehensive about the prospect, but is convinced to accept a pardon for her time with the Maquis by Picard. Over time, Ro was promoted to captain and as of the &quot;Star Trek: The Fall&quot; series of books, is in command of the new &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, following the destruction of the original at the hands of a rogue element of the Typhon Pact. Ro was also one of the characters included at launch in the strategy video game &quot;Star Trek Timelines&quot; by Disruptor Beam.

==Themes==
The Bajorans have been described as analogues for a variety of displaced peoples, with &quot;Star Trek&quot; novelist Keith DeCandido comparing them to &quot;Palestinians, Jews, Kurds, Haitians; the sad reality is that you can pretty much pick and choose. History is full of people who have had their homes taken from them, forced to become refugees.&quot; The Cardassian occupation of Bajor (the Bajoran homeworld) has been compared to the Holocaust, with Ro singled out as a Holocaust survivor. In his chapter &quot;Speakers for the Dead: &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the Holocaust, and the Representation of Atrocity&quot; within the book &quot;Star Trek as Myth&quot;, writer Matthew Wilheim Kapell compared the experiences and reactions of Ro Laren and Kira Nerys following the Cardassian occupation of Bajor. He said that the impact on Ro represented the &quot;non-American view of the holocaust&quot; in that she does not fully recover from the trauma and continues to affect in, for example, preventing her from connecting with her religious beliefs in &quot;The Next Phase&quot;. He explains that Kira is a far more &quot;Americanize[d]&quot; character, acting as a &quot;resister and even liberator&quot; during the occupation. As a result, unlike Ro, Kira retains her religious beliefs and does not typically show any ongoing emotional trauma. Further commentary of Ro&#x27;s relationship to religion have been made. In &quot;The Literary Galaxy of Star Trek&quot;, James F. Broderick compared the situation in which Ro and La Forge are trapped out of phase in &quot;The Next Phase&quot; to that of the purgatory dweller in Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;.

==Reception==
When reviewing &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; for &quot;Tor.com&quot;, DeCandido described Michelle Forbes as &quot;stellar&quot; and called Ro &quot;one of &quot;TNG&quot;&#x27;s best recurring characters&quot;. He also added that the character was &quot;a bit of piss and vinegar to add to the syrupy mix of homogeneity that the &quot;TNG&quot; cast tends to be&quot;. In his review of &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot;, he said that the Ro character arc &quot;comes full circle: once again making a decision that puts her on the outs with Starfleet.&quot; He praised Forbes again, saying that she &quot;inhabits the character so completely, from her awkwardness at the reception in her honor to her playing the role of rebel, to her pain at thinking about her father... to her decision to betray Starfleet and the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.&quot; He did criticise the episode for not wrapping up the Riker-Ro relationship in the same way that closure had been given to her friendship with Picard. Zack Handlen reviewed &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, and described Ro as &quot;terrific&quot; and said that the role represented &quot;one of the rare times that &quot;TNG&quot; has managed to have a frustrated character who doesn&#x27;t immediately seem overly hateful or falsely confrontational&quot;. But he criticized the manner in which her opinion changed to be more favourable of Picard and the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, as he felt that Guinan&#x27;s intervention was detrimental to the plot.

Ro Laren has placed in several polls featuring the characters of the franchise over the course of several years. In a list of the strongest female characters on the official &quot;Star Trek&quot; website by Jordan Hoffman in 2012, Ro Laren was placed second behind Edith Keeler from the &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;. He said that Ro was one of the &quot;richest figures in &quot;Trek&quot;&quot;, and wished to be able to see an alternative timeline where Forbes had accepted the main cast position on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. A poll at the Creation Entertainment official &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention in 2013, conducted by Hoffman, placed Ro Laren as the fifth most popular recurring character among fans, behind Elim Garak, Q, Gul Dukat and General Martok. Hoffman expressed a view that he had expected her to place higher in the rankings, due to the number of her vocal supporters; however, she also had many booing her. On a poll run on the official &quot;Star Trek&quot; website in 2014 regarding the fans&#x27; favourite supporting character, Ro came eighth out of ten. In 2015, she was included in a list of the 21 &quot;most interesting&quot; supporting characters in the franchise by Lisa Granshaw at Blastr. Granshaw called Ro &quot;a complicated, strong character&quot;, and said her &quot;different layers and motivations made her a great character to watch interact with the loyal crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.&quot;

In 2016, the character of Ro Laren was ranked as the 54th-most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science-fiction universe by &quot;Wired&quot;. In 2016, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; rated Ro Laren as the 15th best character in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In 2017, &quot;IndieWire&quot; ranked Ro Laren as the 12th best character on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

In 2018, &quot;CBR&quot; ranked Ro Laren the 15th-best recurring character of all &quot;Star Trek&quot;. They point out she was the first Bajoran presented in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and might have ended up as a character on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;.

<text>Isoetes, commonly known as the quillworts, is a genus of lycopod. It is the only living genus in the family Isoetaceae and order Isoetales. , there were about 200 recognized species, with a cosmopolitan distribution mostly in aquatic habitats but with the individual species often scarce to rare. Species virtually identical to modern quillworts have existed since the Jurassic epoch, though the timing of the origin of modern &quot;Isoetes&quot; is subject to considerable uncertainty.

The name of the genus may also be spelled &quot;Isoëtes&quot;. The diaeresis (two dots over the e) indicates that the o and the e are to be pronounced in two distinct syllables. Including this in print is optional; either spelling (&quot;Isoetes&quot; or &quot;Isoëtes&quot;) is correct.

==Description==

Quillworts are mostly aquatic or semi-aquatic in clear ponds and slow-moving streams, though several (e.g. &quot;I. butleri&quot;, &quot;I. histrix&quot; and &quot;I. nuttallii&quot;) grow on wet ground that dries out in the summer. The quillworts are spore-producing plants and highly reliant on water dispersion. Quillworts have different ways to spread their spores based on the environment. Quillwort leaves are hollow and quill-like, with a minute ligule at the base of the upper surface. arising from a central corm. The sporangia are sunk deeply in the leaf bases. Each leaf will either have many small spores or fewer large spores. Both types of leaf are found on each plant. Each leaf is narrow, long (exceptionally up to ) and wide; they can be either evergreen, winter deciduous, or dry-season deciduous. Only 4% of total biomass, the tips of the leaves, is chlorophyllous.

The roots broaden to a swollen base up to wide where they attach in clusters to a bulb-like, underground rhizome characteristic of most quillwort species, though a few (e.g. &quot;I. tegetiformans&quot;) form spreading mats. This swollen base also contains male and female sporangia, protected by a thin, transparent covering (&quot;velum&quot;), which is used diagnostically to help identify quillwort species. They are heterosporous. Quillwort species are very difficult to distinguish by general appearance. The best way to identify them is by examining their megaspores under a microscope. Moreover, habitat, texture, spore size, and velum provide features that distinguish Isoëtes taxa. They also possess a vestigial form of secondary growth in the basal portions of its cormlike stem, an indication that they evolved from larger ancestors.

==Biochemistry and genetics==
Quillworts use crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) for carbon fixation. Some aquatic species do not have stomata and the leaves have a thick cuticle which prevents CO2 uptake, a task that is performed by their hollow roots instead, which absorb CO2 from the sediment. This has been studied extensively in &quot;Isoetes andicola&quot;. CAM is normally considered an adaptation to life in arid environments to prevent water loss with the plants opening their stomata at night rather than in the heat of the day. This allows CO2 to enter and minimises water loss. As mostly submerged aquatic plants, quillworts do not lack water and the use of CAM is considered to avoid competition with other aquatic plants for CO2 during daytime.

The first detailed quillwort genome sequence, of &quot;I. taiwanensis&quot;, showed that there were differences from CAM in terrestrial plants. CAM involves the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and plants have two forms of the enzyme. One is normally involved in photosynthesis and the other in central metabolism. From the genome sequence, it appears that in quillworts, both forms are involved in photosynthesis. In addition, circadian expression of key CAM pathway genes peaked at different times of day than in angiosperms. These fundamental differences in biochemistry suggest that CAM in quillworts is probably another example of convergent evolution of CAM during the more than 300 million years since the genus diverged from other plants. However, they may also be because of differences between life in water and in the air. The genome sequence also provided two insights into its structure. First, genes and repeated non-coding regions were fairly evenly distributed across all the chromosomes. This is similar to genomes of other non-seed plants, but different from the seed plants (angiosperms) where there are distinctly more genes at the ends of chromosomes. Secondly, there was also evidence that the whole genome had been duplicated in the ancient past.

There are species that switch from CAM to C3 photosynthesis when they go from being submerged in water to living terrestrially, and develop stomata on their leaves. Some species (&quot;I. palmeri&quot;, &quot;I. lechleri&quot; and &quot;I. karsteni&quot;), even under aerial conditions, rarely form stomata, and in some cases (&quot;I. triquetra&quot; and &quot;I. andina&quot;) appear to have completely lost the ability to produce stomata.

== Reproduction ==
=== Overview ===
Like all land plants, &quot;Isoetes&quot; undergoes an alternation of generations between a diploid sporophyte stage and a sexual haploid gametophyte stage. However, the dominance of one stage over the other has shifted over time. The development of vascular tissue and subsequent diversification of land plants coincides with the increased dominance of the sporophyte and reduction of the gametophyte. &quot;Isoetes&quot;, as members of the Lycopodiopsida class, are part of the oldest extant lineage that reflects this shift to a sporophyte dominant lifecycle. In closely related lineages, such as the extinct &quot;Lepidodendron&quot;, spores were dispersed by the sporophyte through large collections of sporangia called strobili for wind-based spore dispersal. However, &quot;Isoetes&quot; are small heterosporous semi-aquatic plants, with different reproductive needs and challenges than large tree-like land plants.

===Description===
Like the rest of the Lycopodiopsida class, &quot;Isoetes&quot; reproduces with spores. Among the lycophytes, both &quot;Isoetes&quot; and the Selaginellaceae (spikemosses) are heterosporous, while the remaining lycophyte family Lycopodiaceae (clubmosses) is homosporous. As heterosporous plants, fertile Isoetes sporophytes produce megaspores and microspores, which develop in the megasporangia and microsporangia. These spores are highly ornate and are the primary way by which species are identified, although no one functional purpose of the intricate surface patterns is agreed upon. The megasporangia occur within the outermost microphylls (single-veined leaves) of the plant while the microsporangia are found in the innermost microphylls. This pattern of development is hypothesized to improve the dispersal of the heavier megaspore. These spores then germinate and divide into mega- and micro- gametophytes. The microgametophytes have antheridia, which in turn produce sperm. The megagametophytes have archegonia, which produce egg cells. Fertilization takes place when the motile sperm from a microgametophyte locates the archegonia of a megagametophyte and swims inside to fertilize the egg.

Outside of heterospory, a distinguishing feature of &quot;Isoetes&quot; (and &quot;Selaginella&quot;) from other pteridophytes, is that their gametophytes grow inside the spores. This means that the gametophytes never leave the protection of the spore that disperses them, cracking the perispore (the outer layer of the spore) just enough to allow the passage of gametes. This is fundamentally different from ferns, where the gametophyte is a photosynthetic plant exposed to the elements of its environment. However, containment creates a separate problem for Isoetes, which is that the gametophytes have no way to acquire energy on their own. &quot;Isoetes&quot; sporophytes solve this problem by provisioning starches and other nutrients to the spores as an energy reserve for the eventual gametophytes. Although not a homologous process, this provisioning is somewhat analogous to other modes of offspring resource investment in seed-plants, such as fruits and seeds. The extent to which resources provisioned to the megaspore also support the growth of the new sporophyte is unknown in &quot;Isoetes&quot;.

=== Dispersal ===
Spore dispersal occurs primarily in water (hydrochory) but may also occur via adherence to animals (zoochory) and as a result of ingestion (endozoochory). These are among the reasons suggested for the ornamentations of the spore, with some authors demonstrating that certain patterns seem well-adapted for sticking to relevant animals like waterfowl. Another critical element of dispersal is the observation that in some species of &quot;Isoetes&quot;, the outer coat of megaspores have pockets that trap microspores, a condition known as synaptospory. Typically, heterospory means that colonization and long-dispersal are more difficult due to the fact that a single spore cannot grow a bisexual gametophyte and thus cannot establish a new population from a single spore as can happen in homosporous ferns. &quot;Isoetes&quot; may mitigate this issue via microspores stuck to megaspores, greatly increasing the possibility of successful fertilization upon dispersal.

== Taxonomy ==
Compared to other genera, &quot;Isoetes&quot; is poorly known. The first critical monograph on their taxonomy, written by Norma Etta Pfeiffer, was published in 1922 and remained a standard reference into the twenty-first century. Even after studies with cytology, scanning electron microscopy, and chromatography, species are difficult to identify and their phylogeny is disputed. Vegetative characteristics commonly used to distinguish other genera, such as leaf length, rigidity, color, or shape are variable and depend on the habitat. Most classification systems for &quot;Isoetes&quot; rely on spore characteristics, which make species identification nearly impossible without microscopy. Some botanists split the genus, separating two South American species into the genus &quot;Stylites&quot;, although molecular data place these species among other species of &quot;Isoetes&quot;, so that &quot;Stylites&quot; does not warrant taxonomic recognition. 

=== Evolution ===

The earliest fossil that has been assigned to the genus is &quot;Isoetes beestonii&quot; from the latest Permian of New South Wales, Australia, around 252 million years ago. However, the relationships of pre-Jurassic isoetaleans to modern &quot;Isotetes&quot; have been regarded as unclear by other authors. &quot;Isoetites rolandii&quot; from the Late Jurassic of North America has been described as the &quot;earliest clear example of a isoetalean lycopsid containing all the major features uniting modern &quot;Isoetes&quot;,&quot; including the loss of the elongated stem and vegetative leaves. Based on this, it has been stated that &quot;the overall morphology of &quot;Isoetes&quot; appears to have persisted virtually unchanged since at least the Jurassic&quot;.&quot;&quot; The timing of the origin of the crown group is uncertain. Wood &quot;et al&quot; (2020) asserted there to be no morphological features that define the major clades within &quot;Isoetes,&quot; and no fossils are known that can be definitively assigned to the crown group.&quot;&quot; While Wood &quot;et al.&quot; suggested a young origin dating to the early Cenozoic based on molecular clock estimates&quot;&quot;, the results were questioned by Wikström &quot;et al.&quot; (2023) who regarded the molecular clock as providing no firm evidence for the origin time of the genus, which could date to the Mesozoic or even the late Paleozoic, depending on the calibration method used.

<text>Equisetum (; horsetail) is the only living genus in Equisetaceae, a family of vascular plants that reproduce by spores rather than seeds.

&quot;Equisetum&quot; is a &quot;living fossil&quot;, the only living genus of the entire subclass Equisetidae, which for over 100 million years was much more diverse and dominated the understorey of late Paleozoic forests. Some equisetids were large trees reaching to tall. The genus &quot;Calamites&quot; of the family Calamitaceae, for example, is abundant in coal deposits from the Carboniferous period. The pattern of spacing of nodes in horsetails, wherein those toward the apex of the shoot are increasingly close together, is said to have inspired John Napier to invent logarithms. Modern horsetails first appeared during the Jurassic period.

A superficially similar but entirely unrelated flowering plant genus, mare&#x27;s tail (&quot;Hippuris&quot;), is occasionally referred to as &quot;horsetail&quot;, and adding to confusion, the name &quot;mare&#x27;s tail&quot; is sometimes applied to &quot;Equisetum&quot;.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;horsetail&quot;, often used for the entire group, arose because the branched species somewhat resemble a horse&#x27;s tail. Similarly, the scientific name &quot;Equisetum&quot; is derived from the Latin (&#x27;horse&#x27;) + (&#x27;bristle&#x27;).

Other names include candock for branching species, marestail, puzzlegrass, and snake grass or scouring-rush for unbranched or sparsely branched species. The latter name refers to the rush-like appearance of the plants and to the fact that the stems are coated with abrasive silicates, making them useful for scouring (cleaning) metal items such as cooking pots or drinking mugs, particularly those made of tin. &quot;Equisetum hyemale&quot;, rough horsetail, is still boiled and then dried in Japan to be used for the final polishing process on woodcraft to produce a smooth finish. In German, the corresponding name is (&#x27;tin-herb&#x27;). In Spanish-speaking countries, these plants are known as (&#x27;horsetail&#x27;).

==Description==

&quot;Equisetum&quot; leaves are greatly reduced and usually non-photosynthetic. They contain a single, non-branching vascular trace, which is the defining feature of microphylls. However, it has recently been recognised that horsetail microphylls are probably not ancestral as in lycophytes (clubmosses and relatives), but rather derived adaptations, evolved by reduction of .

The leaves of horsetails are arranged in whorls fused into nodal sheaths. The stems are usually green and photosynthetic, and are distinctive in being hollow, jointed and ridged (with sometimes 3 but usually 6–40 ridges). There may or may not be whorls of branches at the nodes. Unusually, the branches often emerge below the leaves in an internode, and grow from buds between their bases.

===Spores===
The spores are borne under sporangiophores in strobili, cone-like structures at the tips of some of the stems. In many species the cone-bearing shoots are unbranched, and in some (e.g. &quot;E. arvense&quot;, field horsetail) they are non-photosynthetic, produced early in spring. In some other species (e.g. &quot;E. palustre&quot;, marsh horsetail) they are very similar to sterile shoots, photosynthetic and with whorls of branches.

Horsetails are mostly homosporous, though in the field horsetail, smaller spores give rise to male prothalli. The spores have four elaters that act as moisture-sensitive springs, assisting spore dispersal through crawling and hopping motions after the sporangia have split open longitudinally. They are photosynthetic and have a lifespan that is usually two weeks at most, but will germinate immediately under humid conditions and develop into a gametophyte.

===Cell walls ===
The crude cell extracts of all &quot;Equisetum&quot; species tested contain mixed-linkage glucan : xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (MXE) activity. This is a novel enzyme and is not known to occur in any other plants. In addition, the cell walls of all &quot;Equisetum&quot; species tested contain mixed-linkage glucan (MLG), a polysaccharide which, until recently, was thought to be confined to the Poales. The evolutionary distance between &quot;Equisetum&quot; and the Poales suggests that each evolved MLG independently. The presence of MXE activity in &quot;Equisetum&quot; suggests that they have evolved MLG along with some mechanism of cell wall modification. Non-&quot;Equisetum&quot; land plants tested lack detectable MXE activity. An observed negative correlation between XET activity and cell age led to the suggestion that XET is catalysing endotransglycosylation in controlled wall-loosening during cell expansion. The lack of MXE in the Poales suggests that there it must play some other, currently unknown, role. Due to the correlation between MXE activity and cell age, MXE has been proposed to promote the cessation of cell expansion.

==Taxonomy==
===Species===
Currently, 18 species of &quot;Equisetum&quot; are accepted by Plants of the World Online. The living members are divided into three distinct lineages, which are usually treated as subgenera. The name of the type subgenus, &quot;Equisetum&quot;, means &quot;horse hair&quot; in Latin, while the name of the other large subgenus, &quot;Hippochaete&quot;, means &quot;horse hair&quot; in Greek. Hybrids are common, but hybridization has only been recorded between members of the same subgenus.

Two &quot;Equisetum&quot; plants are sold commercially under the names &quot;Equisetum japonicum&quot; (barred horsetail) and &quot;Equisetum camtschatcense&quot; (Kamchatka horsetail). These are both types of &quot;E. hyemale&quot; var. &quot;hyemale&quot;, although they may also be listed as separate varieties of &quot;E. hyemale&quot;.

=== Evolutionary history ===
The oldest remains of modern horsetails of the genus &quot;Equisetum&quot; first appear in the Early Jurassic, represented by &quot;Equisetum dimorphum&quot; from the Early Jurassic of Patagonia and &quot;Equisetum laterale&quot; from the Early-Middle Jurassic of Australia. Silicified remains of &quot;Equisetum thermale&quot; from the Late Jurassic of Argentina exhibit all the morphological characters of modern members of the genus. The estimated split between &quot;Equisetum bogotense&quot; and all other living &quot;Equisetum&quot; is estimated to have occurred no later than the Early Jurassic.

===Phylogeny===
==Distribution and ecology==
The genus &quot;Equisetum&quot; as a whole, while concentrated in the non-tropical northern hemisphere, is near-cosmopolitan, being absent naturally only from Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, and the islands of the Pacific Ocean. They are most common in northern Europe, with ten species (&quot;E. arvense&quot;, &quot;E. fluviatile&quot;, &quot;E. hyemale&quot;, &quot;E. palustre&quot;, &quot;E. pratense&quot;, &quot;E. ramosissimum&quot;, &quot;E. scirpoides&quot;, &quot;E. sylvaticum&quot;, &quot;E. telmateia&quot;, and &quot;E. variegatum&quot;); Great Britain has nine of these species, missing only &quot;E. scirpoides&quot; of the European list. Northern North America (Canada and the northernmost United States), also has nine species (&quot;E. arvense&quot;, &quot;E. fluviatile&quot;, &quot;E. laevigatum&quot;, &quot;E. palustre&quot;, &quot;E. praealtum&quot;, &quot;E. pratense&quot;, &quot;E. scirpoides&quot;, &quot;E. sylvaticum&quot;, and &quot;E. variegatum&quot;). Only five (&quot;E. bogotense&quot;, &quot;E. giganteum&quot;, &quot;E. myriochaetum&quot;, &quot;E. ramosissimum&quot;, and &quot;E. xylochaetum&quot;) of the eighteen species are known to be native south of the Equator.

They are perennial plants, herbaceous and dying back in winter in most temperate species, or evergreen as most tropical species and the temperate species &quot;E. hyemale&quot; (rough horsetail), &quot;E. ramosissimum&quot; (branched horsetail), &quot;E. scirpoides&quot; (dwarf horsetail) and &quot;E. variegatum&quot; (variegated horsetail). They typically grow 20 cm–1.5 m (8 in–5 ft) tall, though the subtropical &quot;giant horsetails&quot; are recorded to grow as high as (&quot;E. giganteum&quot;, southern giant horsetail) or (&quot;E. myriochaetum&quot;, Mexican giant horsetail), and allegedly even more.

One species, &quot;Equisetum fluviatile&quot;, is an emergent aquatic, rooted in water with shoots growing into the air. The stalks arise from rhizomes that are deep underground and difficult to dig out. Field horsetail (&quot;E. arvense&quot;) can be a nuisance weed, readily regrowing from the rhizome after being pulled out. It is unaffected by many herbicides designed to kill seed plants. Since the stems have a waxy coat, the plant is resistant to contact weedkillers like glyphosate. However, as &quot;E. arvense&quot; prefers an acid soil, lime may be used to assist in eradication efforts to bring the soil pH to 7 or 8. Members of the genus have been declared noxious weeds in Australia and in the US state of Oregon.

All the &quot;Equisetum&quot; are classed as &quot;unwanted organisms&quot; in New Zealand and are listed on the National Pest Plant Accord.

==Consumption==
People have regularly consumed horsetails. The fertile stems bearing strobili of some species can be cooked and eaten like asparagus (a dish called in Japan). Indigenous nations across Cascadia consume and use horsetails in a variety of ways, with the Squamish calling them &quot;sx̱ém&#x27;x̱em&quot; and the Lushootseed using &quot;gʷəɫik&quot;, or horsetail roots, for cedar root baskets. The young plants are eaten cooked or raw, but considerable care must be taken.

If eaten over a long enough period of time, some species of horsetail can be poisonous to grazing animals, including horses. The toxicity appears to be due to thiaminase, which can cause thiamin (vitamin B1) deficiency.

&quot;Equisetum&quot; species may have been a common food for herbivorous dinosaurs. With studies showing that horsetails are nutritionally of high quality, it is assumed that horsetails were an important component of herbivorous dinosaur diets. Analysis of the scratch marks on hadrosaur teeth is consistent with grazing on hard plants like horsetails.

==Folk medicine and safety concerns==
Extracts and other preparations of &quot;E. arvense&quot; have served as herbal remedies, with records dating over centuries. In 2009, the European Food Safety Authority concluded there was no evidence for the supposed health effects of &quot;E. arvense&quot;, such as for invigoration, weight control, skincare, hair health or bone health. , there is insufficient scientific evidence for its effectiveness as a medicine to treat any human condition.

&quot;E. arvense&quot; contains thiaminase, which metabolizes the B vitamin, thiamine, potentially causing thiamine deficiency and associated liver damage, if taken chronically. Horsetail might produce a diuretic effect. Further, its safety for oral consumption has not been sufficiently evaluated and it may be toxic, especially to children and pregnant women.

<doc id="67079" wikidata="Q2560689" url="?curid=67079" title="Anzac biscuit">
<text>The Anzac biscuit is a sweet biscuit, popular in Australia and New Zealand, made using rolled oats, flour, sugar, butter (or margarine), golden syrup, baking soda, boiling water and optionally desiccated coconut. Anzac biscuits have long been associated with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) established in World War I.

It is thought that these biscuits were sent by wives and women&#x27;s groups to soldiers abroad because the ingredients do not spoil easily and the biscuits kept well during naval transportation.

Anzac biscuits should not be confused with hardtack, which was nicknamed &quot;ANZAC wafers&quot; in Australia and New Zealand.

Anzac biscuits are an explicit exemption to an Australian ban on commercial goods that use the term &quot;Anzac&quot;, so long as they are sold as &quot;biscuits&quot; and not &quot;cookies&quot;.

==Origins==

The origin of Anzac biscuits is contested between Australia and New Zealand. The first known recipe for the biscuit significantly predates the formation of the ANZAC Corps, and many early recipes differ from the modern version. For example, historical recipes have variously included nontraditional ingredients such as eggs, fruit, and jam.

The earliest known recipe combining the words &#x27;Anzac&#x27; and &#x27;biscuit&#x27; is a recipe from 1916 for &quot;ANZAC GINGER BISCUITS&quot; which was published on 4 June 1916 in the Perth edition of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. However, this recipe contains no mention of oats, which are present in modern Anzac biscuits. The first recipe for &quot;Anzac Biscuits&quot; appears in an Australian publication, the &quot;War Chest Cookery Book&quot; (Sydney, 1917), but this recipe was also for a different biscuit. The same publication also included the first two recipes for biscuits resembling modern Anzac biscuits, under the names of &quot;Rolled Oats Biscuits&quot; and just &quot;Biscuits&quot;. The first recorded instance of the combination of the name &quot;Anzac biscuit&quot; and the recipe now associated with it was found in Adelaide dating to &quot;either late 1919 or early 1920&quot;. Another early recipe for the Anzac biscuit dates back to 1921, published in an Australian newspaper called &quot;The Argus&quot;. These early recipes did not contain desiccated coconut, which is present in many modern Anzac biscuits. The first recipe for an Anzac biscuit containing desiccated coconut is recorded to be from the city of Adelaide in 1924.

In New Zealand, a 1919 recipe for Anzac Crispies in the eighth edition of the St Andrew&#x27;s Cookery Book had similar ingredients to modern Anzac biscuits.

==Current popularity==
Today, Anzac biscuits are manufactured commercially for retail sale. Because of their historical military connection with the ANZACs and Anzac Day, these biscuits are still used as a fundraising item for the Royal New Zealand Returned Services&#x27; Association (RSA) and the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL). Special collectors old-style biscuit tins with World War military artwork are usually produced in the lead up to Anzac Day and sold in supermarkets, in addition to the standard plastic packets available all year. The official RSL biscuit is produced by &quot;Unibic&quot; under licence.

A British (though still Australian-produced) version of the Anzac biscuit, supporting the Royal British Legion, is available in several major supermarket chains in the UK.

==Legal issues==
Similarly to the use of the term Anzac, the Anzac biscuit is protected by regulations that restrict commercial production of the product. Primarily, such regulations pertain to the name and recipe. They must be referred to and sold as Anzac &quot;biscuits&quot; or &quot;slice&quot; and never as &quot;cookies&quot;. While it is legally acceptable to substitute ingredients in a recipe to cater to dietary requirements, there is a commercial disallowance for any substantial modification of the recipe such that they deviate too far from traditional Anzac biscuit recipes. Variations of recipes posted on social media or written in cookbooks that merely include Anzac biscuits are excluded from regulations.

As a result of the restrictions on the recipe, the Subway chain of restaurants dropped the biscuit from their menu in September 2008. After being ordered by the Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs to bake the biscuits according to the original recipe, Subway decided not to continue to offer the biscuit, as they found that their supplier was unable to develop a cost-effective means of duplicating the recipe.

<text>Pavlova is a meringue-based dessert. Originating in either Australia or New Zealand in the early 20th century, it was named after the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova. Taking the form of a cake-like circular block of baked meringue, pavlova has a crisp crust and soft, light inside. The confection is usually topped with fruit and whipped cream. The name is commonly pronounced or (in North America) , and occasionally closer to the name of the dancer, as .

The dessert is believed to have been created in honour of the dancer either during or after one of her tours to Australia and New Zealand in the 1920s. The nationality of its creator has been a source of argument between the two nations for many years.

The dessert is an important part of the national cuisine of both Australia and New Zealand. It is frequently served during celebratory and holiday meals. It is most identified with and consumed most frequently in summer, including at Christmas time.

A recipe for &quot;Strawberries Pavlova&quot; appeared in the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; on 11 November 1911, but this was a kind of ice block or sorbet. Annabelle Utrecht, who wrote a book about the possible origins of pavlova, believes that this is a reprint from England. 

A 1922 book, &quot;Australian Home Cookery&quot; by Emily Futter, contained a recipe for &quot;Meringue with Fruit Filling&quot;. David Burton regards this as the first known recipe for a food resembling the modern pavlova; Australian food writer Michael Symons, however, does not recognise it as such, pointing to its lack of vinegar or cornflour, to the absence of the pavlova name, and to its description as a meringue cake cut in half and filled.

Another recipe for a dish bearing the name &quot;pavlova&quot; was published in 1926 by the Davis Gelatine company in Sydney. However, this was a multi-layered jelly, not the meringue, cream and fruit dessert known today.

Helen Leach, in her role as a culinary anthropologist at the University of Otago, states that the first recipe from New Zealand was a recipe for &quot;pavlova cake&quot; in 1929. A recipe for pavlova cake was published in &quot;The Evening Star&quot; on 10 November 1934.

It has also been claimed that Bert Sachse created the dish at the Esplanade Hotel in Perth, Western Australia, in 1935. In defence of his claim as inventor of the dish, a relative of Sachse&#x27;s wrote to Leach suggesting that Sachse may have accidentally dated the recipe incorrectly. Leach replied they would not find evidence for that &quot;because it&#x27;s just not showing up in the cookbooks until really the 1940s in Australia.&quot; However, a recipe for &quot;pavlova cake&quot; was published in &quot;The Advocate&quot; in 1935, and a 1937 issue of &quot;The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot; contains a &quot;pavlova sweet cake&quot; recipe. A 1935 advertisement for a chromium ring used to prevent the dessert collapsing also indicates that the term &quot;pavlova cake&quot; had some currency in Auckland at that time.

Other researchers have said that the origins of pavlova lie outside both Australia and New Zealand. Research conducted by New Zealander Andrew Paul Wood and Australian Annabelle Utrecht found that the origins of the modern pavlova can be traced back to the Austro-Hungarian Spanische Windtorte. It was later brought to the United States where German-speaking immigrants introduced meringue, whipped cream, and fruit desserts called &quot;Schaumtorte&quot; (&quot;foam cake&quot;) and &quot;Baisertorte&quot;. American corn starch packages which included recipes for meringue were exported to New Zealand in the 1890s.

Another story is that an unnamed New Zealand chef created Pavlova in 1926 in a Wellington hotel. Food anthropologist Helen Leach of the University of Otago was unable to verify that this was true. She found at least 21 pavlova recipes in New Zealand cookbooks by 1940, the year the Australian recipes appeared. She wrote the book &quot;The Pavlova Story&quot;. The first she found was a multlayered and layered jelly in 1926. In 1928 from Dunedin, a walnut and coffee-flavoured meringue recipe was created and became popular throughout New Zealand. In 1929 a third recipe was published in the &quot;Dairy Farmer&#x27;s Annual&quot;. Leach said that this third recipe was &quot;stolen/falsely claimed by chefs/cooks across the Tasman&quot;. A fourth recipe was published in the &quot;Rangiora Mother&#x27;s Union Cookery Book of Tried and Tested Recipes&quot; in 1933, two years before a similar recipe was published in Australia, later republished to raise funds for the Rangiora Church. This recipe was a single-layered small cake, whose preparation consisted in two egg whites, sugar and cornflour, but with no vinegar, baked in a sandwich tin. One year later a recipe was published in the &quot;New Zealand Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, which contained four egg whites, a breakfast cup of sugar and a teaspoon of vinegar, to be cooked in a cake tin.

An article in Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;The Argus&quot; from 17 November 1928 claims an &quot;American ice-cream&quot; was named after Anna Pavlova: &quot;Dame Nellie Melba, of course, has found fame apart from her art in the famous sweet composed of peaches and cream, while Mme. Anna Pavlova lends her name to a popular variety of American ice-cream.&quot; This article may suggest that pavlova has American origins. However, it&#x27;s unclear how these words should be interpreted and whether that article is relevant. Firstly, the authors of that article offer no evidence for their claims or any depth of discussion of their claims. Secondly, given that pavlova is not an ice-cream, it is highly unclear as to whether the words &quot;American ice-cream&quot; is referring to the modern pavlova dessert or something else entirely.

Michael Symons, an Australian then researching in New Zealand, has declared that pavlova has no singular birthplace. Rather, published recipes reveal the complex process of &quot;social invention&quot; with practical experience circulating, under a variety of names, across both countries. For example, Australians beat New Zealanders to create an accepted pavlova recipe as the &#x27;Meringue Cake&#x27;. The illusion of some singular invention can be explained by distinguishing a second, associated level of &quot;social construction&quot;, in which cooks, eaters and writers attach a name and myths to produce a widely-held concept that appears so deceptively distinct that it must have had a definite moment of creation.

Matthew Evans, a restaurant critic for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, said that it was unlikely that a definitive answer about the dessert&#x27;s origins would ever be found. &quot;People have been doing meringue with cream for a long time, I don&#x27;t think Australia or New Zealand were the first to think of doing that.&quot;

In 2010 the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; noted that the first recorded recipe of pavlova was from 1927 in &quot;Davis Dainty Dishes&quot;, published by the Davis Gelatine Company in New Zealand. This was a multi-coloured jelly dish. Confusingly, the dictionary ambiguously listed the origin as &quot;Austral. and N.Z&quot;.

==Preparation and consumption==
Pavlova is made in a similar way to meringue. Egg whites (and sometimes salt) are beaten to a very stiff consistency, gradually adding caster sugar before folding in vinegar or lemon juice (or another edible acid), cornflour, and vanilla essence. The meringue mixture is placed on to baking paper and shaped to form a round cake around in diameter with a slightly recessed centre. The meringue is baked in a slow oven (; gas mark 1/2, 1, or 2) for 45–60 minutes, then left in the oven to cool and dry out, usually overnight.

Pavlova has a crisp and crunchy outer shell, and a soft, moist marshmallow-like centre, in contrast to meringue which is usually solid throughout. It has been suggested the addition of cornflour is responsible for the marshmallow centre, although it has been debated that the cornflour is just another egg white stabiliser in addition to the acid.

Pavlova is traditionally decorated with a topping of whipped cream and fresh soft fruit such as kiwifruit, passionfruit, and strawberries. Factory-made pavlovas can be purchased at supermarkets and decorated as desired. A commercial product is available that includes pre-mixed ingredients for baking the meringue shell, requiring only the addition of water and sugar.

Leftover decorated pavlova can be refrigerated overnight, but the dessert will absorb moisture and lose its crispness. Undecorated pavlova can be left overnight in the oven, or for several days in an airtight container, to be decorated when ready.

New Zealand pavlova is more likely to have kiwifruit. In Australia, pavlova often has passionfruit and sometimes pineapples. In Britain it is more likely to have strawberries. Older versions of pavlova would have walnuts.

==In culture==
Pavlova is popular on Christmas Day as a dessert usually served after being refrigerated due to Christmas being celebrated during the summer in the southern hemisphere.

===World&#x27;s largest pavlova===
Te Papa, New Zealand&#x27;s national museum in Wellington, celebrated its first birthday in February 1999 with the creation of purportedly the world&#x27;s largest pavlova, dubbed Pavzilla, which was cut by Prime Minister Jenny Shipley. This record was broken by students at the Eastern Institute of Technology in Hawke&#x27;s Bay, New Zealand, in March 2005. Their creation, Pavkong, stretched 64 metres long in comparison to Te Papa&#x27;s 45-metre-long pavlova. In August 2010, chef Aaron Campbell displayed a 50-square-metre rugby-themed pavlova, with the Bledisloe Cup in the centre, in the ChristChurch Cathedral in Christchurch, to raise money for the official charity of the All Blacks. In May 2018 a Norwegian chef and 35 assistants produced an 85-square-metre pavlova.

<doc id="67083" wikidata="Q341707" url="?curid=67083" title="Lamington">
<text>A lamington is an Australian cake made from squares of butter cake or sponge cake coated in an outer layer of chocolate sauce and rolled in desiccated coconut. The thin mixture is absorbed into the outside of the sponge cake and left to set, giving the cake a distinctive texture. A common variation has a layer of cream or strawberry jam between two lamington halves.

==Origins==
Lamingtons are believed to be named after either Lord Lamington, who served as Governor of Queensland from 1896 to 1901, or his wife, Lady Lamington. Most sources incline to the former. The earliest known reference to the naming of the lamington, from June 1927, links the cake to Lord Lamington.

The identity of the recipe&#x27;s inventor has also been debated. Most stories attribute its creation to Lord Lamington&#x27;s chef, the French-born Armand Galland, who was called upon at short notice to feed unexpected guests. Using only the limited ingredients available, Galland cut up some left-over French vanilla sponge cake baked the day before, dipped the slices in chocolate and set them in coconut. Impressed by Galland&#x27;s creation, Lamington&#x27;s guests were said to have later asked for the recipe. This version of events is supported by Lady Lamington&#x27;s memoirs. Coconut was not widely used in European cooking at that time, but was known to Galland, whose wife was from Tahiti, where coconut was a common ingredient.

One account suggests that the lamington was first served in Toowoomba, when Lord Lamington took his entourage to Harlaxton House to escape the steamy heat of Brisbane, whereas another claims that it was created by Galland at Queensland&#x27;s Government House in Brisbane during the busy period leading up to Federation in 1901. A further alternative claim is that Lord Lamington&#x27;s cook, presumably Galland, accidentally dropped a block of sponge cake into a dish of chocolate. It was later discovered that desiccated coconut, sprinkled over the top, made the cakes more appealing.

The first known mention of &quot;Lamington cake&quot; appears in an 1896 newspaper account of a &quot;Lamington Function&quot; at Laidley in Queensland. The event was in honour of Lord Lamington (although it appears he did not attend) and also featured &quot;Lamington Tea&quot;, &quot;Lamington Soup&quot; etc., so, in the absence of any description of the cake, the name of the cake might signify nothing more than the name of the event. A 1900 recipe for Lamington Cakes has been found in the &quot;Queensland Country Life&quot; newspaper. While the recipe originated in Queensland, it spread quickly, appearing in a Sydney newspaper in 1901 and a New Zealand newspaper in 1902. However, none of these recipes indicate the creator of the recipe nor the reason for its name.

A 2014 April Fools&#x27; Day story from &quot;Guardian Australia&quot; falsely claimed the lamington to have been based on a previously unknown New Zealand cake known as a &quot;Wellington&quot;. This hoax origin story was later repeated by other sources.

Lamingtons are typically baked in a Lamington pan named for the cake.

==Modern-day==

Lamingtons remain a popular treat across Australia and New Zealand, and 21 July was designated as National Lamington Day in Australia. Lamingtons are often sold at fundraisers for schools or charity groups, known as &quot;lamington drives&quot;. Some Australians shorten the name to &quot;Lammo&quot; (singular) or &quot;Lammos&quot; (plural).

There are many variations on the basic lamington recipe, including different colours, flavours, and sizes.

===Similar cakes in other countries===

Hungary has a similar item is known as , or coconut squares.

Romanian cuisine calls the Lamington Prajitura tavalita cu cocos or &quot;cake tumbled in coconut&quot; and has a wide range of variations including different sauces and nuts and adding rum or orange or lemon zest to the cake.

South Africa has a similar but smaller-sized confection is known in as &quot;ystervarkies&quot; (little porcupines).

In the U.S. city of Cleveland, they are called coconut bars.

The British Overseas Territory of St Helena Island has a similar variation called coconut fingers, made traditionally for special occasions such as weddings and birthdays.

In Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, the &quot;čupavci&quot; is a similar cake. &quot;Čupavci&quot; are one of the most popular Christmas desserts in Croatia. Slovenia, Romania and Hungary have similar cakes.

In Mauritius, there is a dessert which is a variant of the Lamington cake; It is called the &quot;red Lamington cake&quot;, also known as &quot;gato carré rouge&quot; (lit. &quot;red cube cake&quot; or &quot;red square cake&quot; in English and in French) or &quot;gato Francis&quot; (lit. &quot;Francis cake&quot; in English or in French). Red dye is used to give the cake its red colour; square pieces of the cake are soaked in the red dye completely and then coated with desiccated coconut, and whipped cream is applied on the top surface of the cake. A half candied cherry or half a strawberry can also be applied on top of the cream as topping. The cake is sometimes strawberry flavoured.

== Awards ==
In 2009, as part of the Q150 celebrations, the lamington was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an iconic &quot;innovation and invention&quot;.

<doc id="67084" wikidata="Q59677" url="?curid=67084" title="Transphobia">
<text>Transphobia consists of negative attitudes, feelings, or actions towards transgender people or in general. Transphobia can include fear, aversion, hatred, violence or anger towards people who do not conform to social gender roles. Transphobia is a type of prejudice and discrimination, similar to racism, sexism, or ableism, and it is closely associated with homophobia. People of color who are transgender experience discrimination above and beyond that which can be explained as a simple combination of transphobia and racism.

Transgender youth often experience a combination of abuse from family members, sexual harassment, and bullying or school violence. They are also disproportionately placed in foster care and welfare programs compared to their peers. Adult transgender people regularly encounter sexual violence, police violence, public ridicule, misgendering, or other forms of violence and harassment in their daily lives. These issues cause many trans people to feel unsafe in public. Other issues include healthcare discrimination, workplace discrimination or feeling under siege by conservative political or religious groups who oppose LGBT-rights laws. Discrimination and violence sometimes originates from people within the LGBT community or feminist movements.

As well as increased risk of violence and other threats, the stress created by transphobia causes negative mental health outcomes and lead to drug use disorders, running away from home (in minors), and suicide.

In much of the Western world, there has been a gradual establishment of policies combatting discrimination and supporting equal opportunity in all aspects of life since the 1990s. The trend is also taking shape in some developing nations. In addition, campaigns regarding the LGBT community are being spread around the world to improve social acceptance of nontraditional gender identities. The &quot;Stop the Stigma&quot; campaign by the UN is one such example. However, transphobic violence has been on the rise since 2021, accompanied with an increase in anti-trans discriminatory laws being enacted in many parts of the US and other countries.

==Etymology and use==
The word &quot;transphobia&quot; is a classical compound patterned on the term &quot;homophobia&quot;. The first component is the neo-classical prefix &quot;trans-&quot; (originally meaning &quot;across, on the far side, beyond&quot;) from &quot;transgender&quot;, and the second component &quot;-phobia&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek (, &quot;fear&quot;). Along with &quot;lesbophobia&quot;, &quot;biphobia&quot; and &quot;homophobia&quot;, &quot;transphobia&quot; is a member of the family of terms used when intolerance and discrimination is directed toward LGBT people.

&quot;Transphobia&quot; is not a phobia as defined in clinical psychology (i.e., an anxiety disorder). Its meaning and usage parallels &quot;xenophobia&quot;. The noun &quot;transphobe&quot; denotes someone who harbors transphobia. The adjectival form &quot;transphobic&quot; may be used to describe a transphobe or their actions. The words &quot;transphobia&quot; and &quot;transphobic&quot; were added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2013.

It has been argued that transmisia, with the suffix &quot;-misia&quot; meaning &quot;hatred&quot;, would be a more accurate term, because transphobia is more about hatred of than about fear of transgender people.

==Origins==
Transfeminist theorist and author Julia Serano argues that the root of transphobia is &quot;oppositional sexism&quot;, i.e. the belief that male and female are &quot;rigid, mutually exclusive categories, each possessing a unique and nonoverlapping set of attributes, aptitudes, abilities, and desires&quot;. She contrasts this against the belief that males and masculinity are superior to females and femininity along with people&#x27;s insecurities about gender and gender norms, which she calls &quot;traditional sexism&quot;.

Other transgender rights authors argue that a significant part of the oppositional sexist origin of transphobia and violence towards transsexual people is linked to psychological claims of difference between male sexuality and female sexuality in the brain&#x27;s protection mechanisms from committing sex crimes. These authors argue that the paradigm of acceptable sexual behavior that assumes men&#x27;s sexual arousal is category-specific and women&#x27;s sex drive is lower and more inhibited causes allegations that transsexual people have neither safety system in the brain and are therefore sex criminals. They argue that studies that claim to show such sex differences have flaws, such as the possibility that more men are deterred from participating in sexual arousal studies than women due to fear of being alleged to be inappropriately sexually aroused.

Others have argued that hostility towards transgender identity is in part due to the challenge it poses to the idea that gender is based on observable physical and behavioral characteristics determined at birth. Rad and colleagues surveyed a sample of 1323 American adults, asking them to identify the gender of transgender people who medically transitioned, finding that the type of transition procedure mattered but its direction did not. Specifically, biological changes resulted in the target being more identified with their self-identified gender than their birth-assigned gender, but there were no significant differences between male-to-female and female-to-male transitions. Moreover, compared to male test subjects, female test subjects were more likely to identify the targets as their self-identified gender. This gender difference was larger in younger, more liberal, and less religious non-Midwestern respondents. The authors further showed that gender category beliefs (ratings of the transgender person&#x27;s post-transition gender identity) were strongly associated with attitudes and feelings of warmth towards transgender people. However, gender category beliefs performed better in predicting bathroom policy preferences compared to feelings in unseen data, indicating that beliefs about what gender is and how it is determined are significantly linked to transphobia and support for anti-transgender policies. The authors argue that this pattern is consistent with theories that transphobia is rooted in a hierarchical social classification system where low-status groups (e.g., females) view the hierarchy in less essentialist ways than high-status groups (e.g., males).

Transgender author and critic Jody Norton believes that transphobia is an extension of homophobia and misogyny. She argues that transgender people, like gays and lesbians, are hated and feared for challenging and undermining gender norms and the gender binary, and the &quot;male-to-female transgender incites transphobia through her implicit challenge to the binary division of gender upon which male cultural and political hegemony depends&quot;.

Drawing on theory of radicalization, Craig McLean argues that discourse on transgender-related issues in the UK has been radicalized in response to the activities of what he terms the &quot;anti-transgender movement,&quot; claiming that the movement pushes &quot;a radical agenda to deny the basic rights of trans people (...) under the cover of &#x27;free speech.&#x27;&quot;

Some authors have linked transphobia&#x27;s origins to colonialism, arguing that gendercide against third gender people carried out during the European colonization of the Americas reflect the historical roots of transphobia.

==Related concepts==
Cissexism (also termed cisgenderism, and related to but distinct from cisnormativity or cissexual assumption) is the appeal to norms that enforce the gender binary and gender essentialism, resulting in the oppression of gender variant, non-binary, and transgender identities. Cissexism refers to the assumption that, due to human sexual differentiation, one&#x27;s gender is determined solely by a biological sex of male or female (or, in the case of cisgenderism, a bivalent male or female expression), and that trans people are inferior to cisgender people. &quot;Cisgender privilege&quot; is the set of &quot;unearned rights afforded to nontransgender people by virtue of the fact that they are not transgender&quot;, such as access to gender-segregated spaces and teams, lower exposure to gender-based violence, and easier access to gender-specific healthcare.

Harassment and violence directed against transgender people is often called trans bashing, and can be physical, sexual or verbal. Whereas gay bashing is directed against a target&#x27;s real or perceived sexual orientation, trans bashing is directed against the target&#x27;s real or perceived expressed gender identity. The term has also been applied to hate speech directed at transgender people and to depictions of transgender people in the media that reinforce negative stereotypes about them.
&quot;Transprejudice&quot; is a term similar to transphobia, and refers to the negative valuing, stereotyping, and discriminatory treatment of individuals whose appearance or identity does not conform to current social expectations or conventional conceptions of gender.

==Manifestations==
Transgender people are often excluded from entitlements or privileges reserved for cisgender people of the same gender: for example, it is common for transgender women to be stopped or questioned when they use public bathrooms designated for women. Homeless shelters, hospitals and prisons have denied trans women admission to women&#x27;s areas and forced them to sleep and bathe in the presence of men.

===Harassment and violence===
The stigma against transgender people often results in physical violence or bodily harm, sexual violence or assault, and verbal or emotional abuse. Transgender individuals are at increased risk for experiencing aggression and violence throughout their life when compared to cisgender individuals, especially when it comes to sexual violence. Other kinds of abuse include bullying, harassment, and multiple forms of discrimination. Abuse against transgender people can come from many different sources, including family and friends, partners, co-workers and acquaintances, strangers, and the police, and the abuse can occur at each developmental stage in life.

As homophobia and transphobia are correlated, many trans people experience homophobia and heterosexism due to people who associate trans people&#x27;s gender identity with homosexuality, or because trans people may also have a sexual orientation that is non-heterosexual. Author stated that &quot;transgender people subjected to violence, in a range of cultural contexts, frequently report that transphobic violence is expressed in homophobic terms.&quot;

According to the American Psychological Association, transgender children are more likely than other children to experience harassment and violence in school, foster care, residential treatment centers, homeless centers, and juvenile justice programs. Researchers say trans youth routinely experience taunting, teasing and bullying at school, and that nearly all trans youth say they were verbally or physically harassed in school, particularly during gym class, at school events, or when using single-sex restrooms. Three-quarters report having felt unsafe.

As adults, transgender people are frequently subjected to ridicule, taunting, and threats of violence, even when just walking down the street or walking into a store. A U.S. survey of 402 older, employed, high-income transgender people found that 60% reported violence or harassment because of their gender identity. Among other things, 56% of the respondents reported being harassed or verbally abused, 30% reported being assaulted, and 8% reported unjustified arrest.

A study of 81 transgender people in Philadelphia found that 30% of the respondents reported feeling unsafe in public because they were transgender, with 19% feeling uncomfortable for the same reason. When asked if they had ever been forced to have sex, experienced violence in their home, or been physically abused, the majority answered yes to each question.

==== Sexual violence ====
In 2009, researcher Rebecca L. Stotzer published an article in &quot;Aggression and Violent Behavior&quot; that compiled information from numerous studies reporting violence against transgender people, describing it as &quot;shockingly common&quot; and noting that transgender people have a high risk of experiencing sexual violence throughout their lifetimes, and while reported rates vary considerably among studies for methodological and other reasons, the most common finding is that around 50% of transgender people have been sexually assaulted.

A meta-analysis on the rates of intimate partner violence found that transgender individuals are 66% more likely to experience violence of some kind from an intimate partner than cisgender subjects, and more than twice as likely to experience both sexual and physical intimate partner violence than their cisgender peers.

==== Physical violence ====
Perpetrators of physical violence against transgender people are reported to have been influenced by negative attitudes against transgender people, many of whom do not report their assault to the police. In the United States, the available homicide data suggests that transgender people are murdered at a lower rate than cisgender people. However, young Black and Latina trans women appear to be at greater risk of homicide than their cisgender peers.

===Misgendering===
Misgendering is the act of labelling or referring to others with a gender that does not match their gender identity. Misgendering can be deliberate or accidental; common examples of misgendering a person are using the wrong pronouns to describe someone, calling a person &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot; or &quot;sir&quot; in contradiction to the person&#x27;s gender identity, using a person&#x27;s previous, pre-transition name for them in place of their current name (&quot;deadnaming&quot;), or insisting that a person must adhere to the norms of their sex assigned at birth rather than the ones that align with their gender identity; for example, using a bathroom designated for males even though the person identifies as female.

The experience of being misgendered is common for all transgender people before they transition, and for many afterwards as well. Transgender people are regularly misgendered by doctors, police, media, and peers, experiences that have been described as &quot;mortifying&quot;, cruel, and &quot;only making our lives harder&quot;. A 2018 study of 129 transgender and other gender-expansive youth published in the &quot;Journal of Adolescent Health&quot;, found that &quot;for each additional social context in which a youth&#x27;s chosen name was used, there was a statistically significant decrease in depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behaviors,&quot; though the study was &quot;correlational so causality cannot be assumed, and the sample size was small.&quot; Deliberately misgendering a transgender person is considered extremely offensive by transgender individuals.

==In society==

===In healthcare===

A study of 81 transgender people in Philadelphia found 14% said they had been refused routine medical care because they were transgender. 18% answered &#x27;yes&#x27; when asked if, when they went in for a check-up, &quot;being transgender created a problem&quot; for them.

Additionally, a study of 223 healthcare providers indicated a correlation between transphobia and decreased performance on survey questions regarding the treatment of transgender patients, with no significant correlation to the amount of time spent learning about transgender health, leading researchers to state that &quot;broader efforts to address transphobia in society in general, and in medical education in particular, may be required to improve the quality of medical care for [transgender and gender diverse] patients.&quot;

In the United States–based National Center For Transgender Equality&#x27;s 2011 survey, 19% of respondents reported being refused medical care due to their transgender or gender non-conforming status, such as Robert Eads, who died of ovarian cancer after being refused treatment by more than two dozen doctors due to fears that taking him on as a patient might harm their practice, or Tyra Hunter, who was involved in an automobile accident; when rescue workers discovered she was transgender, they backed away and stopped administering treatment. She later died in a hospital.

In many European countries, laws require that any transgender person who wishes to change their legal gender must first be sterilized. Sweden repealed its law in December 2012, and the European Court of Human Rights struck down such laws in 2017.

===In the workplace===
Transphobia also manifests itself in the workplace. Some transgender people lose their jobs when they begin to transition and a 1995 study from Willamette University stated that a transgender person fired for following the recommended course of treatment rarely wins it back through federal or state statutes.

A survey of 392 trans women and 123 trans men conducted by the San Francisco Department of Public Health in 1997 found that 40% of trans women surveyed had earned money from full or part-time employment over the preceding six months. For trans men, the equivalent statistic was 81%. The survey also found that 46% of trans women and 57% of trans men reported employment discrimination. A follow-up study in 1999 reported 70% of trans respondents being unemployed.

A 2002 American study found that among educators, trans educators are 10–20% more likely to experience workplace harassment than their gay and lesbian colleagues.

In the hiring process, discrimination may be either open or covert, with employers sometimes finding other ostensible reasons to not hire a candidate. Additionally, when an employer fires a transgender employee, it may be a &quot;mixed motive&quot; case, with the employer openly citing obvious wrongdoing or job performance issues while keeping silent in regards to transphobia.

Employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression is illegal in the United States. Such discrimination is outlawed by specific legislation in the State of New Jersey and might be in other states (as it is in the states of California, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington) or city ordinances; additionally, it is covered by case law in some other states. (For example, Massachusetts is covered by cases such as &quot;Lie vs. Sky Publishing Co.&quot; and &quot;Jette vs. Honey Farms&quot;.) Several other states and cities prohibit such discrimination in public employment. Sweden and the United Kingdom have also legislated against employment discrimination on the grounds of gender identity. Sometimes, however, employers discriminate against transgender employees in spite of such legal protections. In 2000, the southern U.S. grocery chain Winn-Dixie fired long-time employee Peter Oiler, despite a history of repeatedly earning raises and promotions, after management learned that Oiler identified as transgender and occasionally cross-dressed off the job. Management argued that this hurt Winn-Dixie&#x27;s corporate image. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against Winn-Dixie on behalf of Oiler, but a judge dismissed it.

Transgender people facing employment discrimination may turn to sex work to survive, placing them at additional risk of encountering troubles with the law, including arrest and criminal prosecution, workplace violence, the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV. Lack of employment has also resulted in the transgender community resorting to illegal means of earning money such as drug-dealing.

A study conducted by Anneliese Singh and Vel McKleroy on transgender people of color revealed that difficulty finding a job or losing a job due to transphobia resulted in some respondents living in crime-ridden neighborhoods and getting involved in abusive relationships. A 2021 study in the Journal of Career Development looked at 18 Latino transgender immigrants to the United States and found five themes related to these participants&#x27; experiences while seeking employment: discrimination, limited options, positive experiences, and disability benefits as financial relief.

===From government===
Voter identification laws in the United States often impact transgender individuals&#x27; ability to vote, since many lack photo identification with their current name and gender.

Prisons frequently make no attempt to accommodate transgender individuals, assigning them to facilities using only the criteria of genitalia, which is believed to contribute to the pervasiveness of prison rape with regards to transgender women. Prison staff have been noted to frequently deny trans women privileges disproportionately, and the Eighth Amendment right for an individual not to be given cruel or unusual punishment has historically not been liberally enforced in cases involving transgender inmates.

In July 2023, Russia enacted a law which had, among other measures, banned gender-affirming healthcare for all transgender people regardless of age and had also banned them from adopting children.

Transgender people also face the denial of right of asylum or inhuman treatment in process of asylum-seeking.

===In education===
Within the school system, many transgender teens are harassed and mistreated with reported negative effects on both victim and the school&#x27;s population in general. Transgender youth frequently report fear and anxiety about using restrooms and locker rooms at school because of harassment by both peers and adults when using them. Over 80% of transgender teens report feeling unsafe in a school environment, more than 40% report having been physically abused, and over 65% report being bullied online or via social media. Such discrimination is generally underreported, and school officials may even participate in transphobic name-calling or victim-blaming. Additionally, administrative practices such as misgendering students in school records can contribute to transgender students&#x27; distress in school.

A study done on Canadian high school students between December 2007 and June 2009 illustrated how the LGBTQ students felt unsafe at the school and were exposed to insults and discrimination by their peers and sometimes even by their teachers. Even heterosexual students and teachers fear attack by transphobia on account of supporting or having a transgender friend or family member.

===Online===

Online transphobia remains a growing problem across various online spaces. A study by Brandwatch analyzing over ten million posts in transgender-related discussions on various social media platforms between 2015 and 2019 found over 1.5 million transphobic posts. These posts varied from promoting transphobic sentiment to advocating for anti-transgender violence and genocide.

Transgender people are often victims of online harassment and experience higher reported levels of online harassment compared to their cisgender heterosexual counterparts. One study on transphobic cyberbullying by Evelyn et al. found that participants most frequently reported being bullied on social media platforms, alongside frequently reporting bullying in online video games and dating apps. Most of the bullying was found to be from anonymous users or people unknown to the participants, and often in the form of transphobic insults, intersectional sexist, homophobic and/or racist insults, outing their identity, threats of harm, and sexual harassment. Participants even reported transphobic cyberbullying from other transgender individuals, usually by policing or outing their identity.

Online transphobia has potential to lead to real-world violence and threats. An example of this is when far-right Twitter account Libs of TikTok made a series of posts spreading misinformation that Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital was performing hysterectomies on minors. This led to a series of death threats and bomb threats being made against the hospital and individual physicians, and individual physicians being doxxed and harassed in person. Libs of TikTok has similarly posted about several other LGBT-themed events, such as Drag Queen Story Hours, often leading to said events receiving mass threats of violence and being canceled or postponed by organizers.

The LGBT grooming conspiracy theory- claiming that LGBTQ people and allies are systematically grooming children- has been promoted online by both users and mainstream politicians such as Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert. Former US President Donald Trump claimed in a video posted to Truth Social on 31 January 2023, that &quot;the left-wing gender insanity being pushed at our children is an act of child abuse&quot; and that if re-elected, he would pass numerous laws significantly limiting gender-affirming care for minors. One study on Twitter found that use of the term &quot;groomer&quot; in tweets spiked on multiple occasions, including the passing of the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act, the signing into law of said act, and Twitter posting a statement that tweets calling transgender or nonbinary people &quot;groomers&quot; violates its hate speech policy.

Despite Twitter&#x27;s prior public stance against transphobia and homophobia on its platform, the company was criticized by organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign for being inefficient. One audit by the organization found that Twitter failed to act on 99 out of 100 of the most viewed anti-LGBT tweets between January and July 2022. The acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk has led to a significant increase in hate speech, especially in terms of anti-LGBTQ content. Following Musk&#x27;s takeover, tweets linking LGBT people to grooming rose by 119%, and retweets and mentions of right-wing figures&#x27; anti-LGBT tweets increased by over 1200%. Under Elon Musk, Twitter has also relaxed transgender hate speech policies, such as misgendering. &quot;GLAAD&quot; described Twitter as &quot;the most dangerous platform for LGBTQ people&quot;, ranking the lowest on its Social Media Safety Index.

Similarly, a 2020 study on Facebook by Media Matters for America found that right-leaning sources took up a vast majority of interactions in transgender topics compared to left-leaning or queer sources, with anti-LGBT outlets such as The Daily Wire and LifeSiteNews earning the highest engagements out of any source analyzed in the study.

===In religion===
====In Christianity====
In North America, organizations associated with the Christian right, including the American Family Association, Family Research Council, Focus on the Family, National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, believe that &quot;&quot; is unnatural and that transgender people are and remain the sex they were assigned at birth. These organizations oppose laws and policies intended to accommodate transgender people, such as allowing them to change their legal sex, use the washroom corresponding to the gender with which they identify, or become ordained Christian ministers. It is their position that God created people&#x27;s bodies as they are meant to be, that accepting transgender people would violate scripture and natural law, and that the Bible refers to male and female only.

According to the Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance website, under Pope John Paul II, the Holy See first stated its opposition to reassignment surgery in 2000, although it was not made public until 2003.

Transgender people face particular challenges in attempting to integrate their faith with their gender identity. One author says &quot;expectations [based on gender] are usually predicated upon our genitalia and begin from the moment of birth, continuing throughout our lives.&quot; Many Christian denominations use biblical notions of gender and gender roles to support their views. These include &quot;So God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them&quot; (Genesis 1:27) and &quot;The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman&#x27;s garment: for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God&quot; (Deuteronomy 22:5).

Views of gender identity based on the Christian faith do not always coincide with the perspectives of transgender individuals. However, if they do not conform to these expectations, they may face rejection. Many transgender Christians seek out an &quot;individualized relationship with God&quot;, often facing &quot;a period of denial and struggle&quot; as well as depression, disconnection, dissatisfaction, and spiritual difficulty before &quot;discovering a sense of self that feels integral and true&quot;. Many transgender individuals face barriers within the church, such as &quot;fear and unfamiliarity on the part of the congregation, language issues, physical layout that separates people by gender, programs that exclude or separate by gender, pathologizing or designating trans issues as sinful, and overt hostility&quot;.

====In Islam====
The Islamic faith has historically supported heteronormative, binary gender identification. This support is reinforced by cultural norms and traditional readings of sacred texts which prohibit a wide range of identities. Despite this history, progressive Muslims have built arguments that support transgender Muslims on long-established doctrine, and support for gender transition has even been found among influential conservative scholars.

In 1988, gender reassignment surgery was declared acceptable under Islamic law by scholars at Egypt&#x27;s Al-Azhar, the world&#x27;s oldest Islamic university. In Iran during 1987, Ayatollah Khomeini, the supreme religious leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran at that time, also declared transgender surgical operations as acceptable (see transgender rights in Iran). The foundation for this accepting attitude in contrast to intolerance of homosexuality is the belief that a person is born transgender but chooses to be homosexual. Despite this acceptance among some conservative Muslim scholars and leaders, transgender individuals within the Muslim community still face particular challenges.

Today, there are some Muslim communities that explicitly welcome transgender Muslims, including some which have trans leadership. Masjid Al-Rabia, founded in 2017, is a trans-led, women-centred, LGBTQ+ affirming mosque based in Chicago, IL. In Northampton, Massachusetts, the Pioneer Valley Progressive Muslims (Masjid Al-Inshirah) was founded in 2010 by a transgender Muslim. Muslims for Progressive Values has founded Unity Mosques in Atlanta, Georgia; Columbus, Ohio; and Los Angeles, California; as well as outside the United States. The Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity hosts an annual retreat for LGBTQ+ Muslims in Pennsylvania each May. The Trans and Muslim Project of TransFaith is a project devoted specifically to the support of transgender Muslims.

==In feminism==
Some positions within feminism have been considered transphobic. This may include criticism of transitioning or sex reassignment surgery (SRS) as a personal choice or medical invention, or the position that trans women are not women in a literal sense and should not be allowed access to women-only spaces. Some second-wave feminists perceive trans men and women respectively as &quot;traitors&quot; and &quot;infiltrators&quot; to womanhood.

Second-wave feminist and activist Gloria Steinem expressed concerns in 1977 about transsexuality and SRS, writing that in many cases, transsexuals &quot;surgically mutilate their own bodies.&quot; She concluded that &quot;feminists are right to feel uncomfortable about the need for and uses of transsexualism.&quot; For some years, this led to Steinem being characterized as transphobic. In 2013, she repudiated the interpretation of her text as an altogether condemnation of SRS, stating that her position was informed by accounts of gay men choosing to transition as a way of coping with societal homophobia. She added that she sees transgender people as living &quot;authentic lives&quot; that should be &quot;celebrated&quot;.

Radical feminist Janice Raymond&#x27;s 1979 book, &quot;The Transsexual Empire&quot;, was and is still controversial due to its unequivocal condemnation of transsexual surgeries. In the book Raymond says, &quot;All transsexuals rape women&#x27;s bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves ... Transsexuals merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women, so that they seem non-invasive&quot; and that trans people should be &quot;morally mandated out of existence&quot;.

Another site of conflict between feminists and trans women has been the Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival. In the early 1990s, the festival ejected a transsexual woman, Nancy Burkholder. In 2014, the festival &quot;passionately rejected&quot; accusations that it believed transgender women are &quot;less than&quot; other women. The activist group Camp Trans had protested the &quot;womyn-born-womyn&quot; intention and advocated for greater acceptance of trans women within the feminist community. The festival had considered allowing only post-operative trans women to attend, but this was criticized as classist, as many trans women cannot afford sex reassignment surgery.

Trans women such as Sandy Stone challenged the feminist conception of &quot;biological woman&quot;. Stone worked as a sound engineer for Olivia Records from about 1974 to 1978, resigning as the controversy over a trans woman working for a lesbian-identified enterprise increased. The debate continued in Raymond&#x27;s book, which devoted a chapter to criticism of &quot;the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist.&quot; Groups like Lesbian Organization of Toronto then voted to exclude trans lesbians. Sheila Jeffreys described &quot;&quot; as &quot;deeply problematic from a feminist perspective and [stated] that transsexualism should be seen as a violation of human rights.&quot;

The work of poststructuralist feminist and lesbian Judith Butler, particularly their books &quot;Gender Trouble&quot; (1990) and &quot;Bodies That Matter&quot; (1993), argues that the &quot;violent inscription&quot; of gender as a social construct on human bodies leads to violence against those who do not conform to such binaristic gender dichotomies.

Feminists who oppose the inclusion of trans women in women&#x27;s spaces have been labeled &quot;TERFs&quot;, short for &quot;trans-exclusionary radical feminists&quot;. Those at whom the term is directed, in turn, have perceived their labeling as &quot;TERF&quot; to be a slur.

==In gay, lesbian, and bisexual communities==
Transphobia is documented in the lesbian, gay and bisexual communities, despite historic cooperation between these communities in campaigns for equality.

Authors and observers, such as transgender author Jillian Todd Weiss, have written that &quot;there are social and political forces that have created a split between gay/lesbian communities and bisexual/transgender communities, and these forces have consequences for civil rights and community inclusion. &#x27;Biphobia&#x27; and &#x27;transphobia&#x27; are a result of these social and political forces, not psychological forces causing irrational fears in aberrant individuals.&quot;

===Gay and lesbian communities===
Historian Joanne Meyerowitz documented transphobia within the gay rights movement in the mid 20th century in response to publicity surrounding the transition of Christine Jorgensen. Jorgensen, who made frequent homophobic remarks and insisted she was not connected to or identified with gay men, was a polarizing figure among activists:

Several prominent figures in second wave feminism have also been accused of transphobic attitudes, culminating in 1979 with the publication of &quot;The Transsexual Empire&quot; by radical lesbian feminist Janice Raymond, who popularized the term &quot;shemale&quot; as derogatory slur referring to trans women in 1994, and her statements on transsexuality and transsexual people have been criticized by many in the LGBT and feminist communities as extremely transphobic and as constituting hate speech.

In 1950s America, there was a debate among gay men and women about those who felt they were of the opposite sex. Gay men and women who were trying to melt quietly into the majority society criticized them as &quot;freaks&quot; who brought unwanted disreputable attention upon them. Such attitudes were widespread at the time.

Some trans men face rejection from lesbian communities they had been part of prior to transition. Journalist Louise Rafkin writes, &quot;there are those who are feeling curiously uncomfortable standing by as friends morph into men. Sometimes there is a generational flavor to this discomfort; many in the over-40 crowd feel particular unease&quot;, stating that this was &quot;shaking the foundation of the lesbian-feminist world&quot;. Trans men were part of the protest at the 2000 Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival, the first time the &#x27;womyn-born womyn only&#x27; policy has been used against trans males, women supporting the transgender community and young gender-variant women.

In the early 1970s, conflicts began to emerge due to different syntheses of lesbian, feminist and transgender political movements, particularly in the United States. San Francisco trans activist and entertainer Beth Elliott became the focus of debate over whether to include transgender lesbians in the movement, and she was eventually blacklisted by her own movement.

===Bisexual communities and binarism===
One view is that the word &quot;bisexual&quot; is transphobic, as &quot;bi&quot; means &quot;two&quot; (thus implying a belief in the binary view of gender). Some people, such as scholar Shiri Eisner, say that some make the claim that the term &quot;erases nonbinary genders and sexes out of existence&quot;, as many dictionaries define bisexuality as &quot;of, relating to, or having a sexual orientation to persons of either sex&quot;, &quot;sexually attracted to both men and women&quot; and other similar definitions.

However, some bisexual individuals and scholars object to the notion that bisexuality means sexual attraction to only two genders, arguing that since &quot;bisexual&quot; is not simply about attraction to two sexes and encompasses gender as well, it can include attraction to more than one or more than two genders and is occasionally defined as such. Others, such as the American Institute of Bisexuality, say that the term &quot;is an open and inclusive term for many kinds of people with same-sex and different-sex attractions&quot; and that &quot;the scientific classification &quot;bisexual&quot; only addresses the physical, biological sex of the people involved, not the gender-presentation.&quot;

To deal with issues related to transphobia and the gender binary, some individuals have taken on terms such as &quot;pansexual&quot;, &quot;omnisexual&quot;, or &quot;polysexual&quot; in place of the term &quot;bisexual&quot;. The American Institute of Bisexuality argues that these terms &quot;describe a person with homosexual and heterosexual attractions, and therefore people with these labels are also bisexual&quot; and that the notion that bisexuality is a reinforcement of a gender binary is a concept that is founded upon &quot;anti-science, anti-Enlightenment philosophy that has ironically found a home within many Queer Studies departments at universities across the Anglophone world&quot;. Eisner agrees with this view, stating that &quot;allegations of binarism have little to do with bisexuality&#x27;s actual attributes or bisexual people&#x27;s behavior in real life&quot; and that the allegations are an attempt to separate the bisexual and transgender communities politically.

==Consequences==
Whether intentional or not, transphobia and cissexism have severe consequences for the target of the negative attitude. Transphobia creates significant stresses for transgender people which can lead them to feel shame, low self-esteem, alienation and inadequacy. Transgender youth often try to cope with the stress by running away from home, dropping out of school, using drugs or self-harming. Suicide rates among transgender people are thought to be especially high, because of how they are treated by their families and by society.

===Childhood and adolescence===
Polyvictimization is experiencing multiple forms of abuse and victimization throughout a person&#x27;s life, such as physical or sexual violence, bullying/aggression, parental neglect or abuse, experiencing crime, etc. Polyvictimization can start in childhood and has consequences for adolescent health and thus adult health. 
Transgender, gender diverse, and sexual minority adolescents (TGSA) are more likely to experience polyvictimization when compared to their cisgender peers. Family traits more associated with polyvictimization in TGSA include: families that have higher than average levels of violence and adversity in their life, families that give their child higher than average levels of microaggressions and lower levels of microaffirmations, and families that have average levels of violence and adversity, and also give their child higher levels of microaffirmations. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms reported by TGSA has shown to be a significant link between TGSA grouped by their family experiences and polyvictimization.

Research supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) assessed lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) adolescents and noted that those who had moderate to high, and steady or increasing rates of victimization or verbal or physical threats, were at heightened risk for developing PTSD. Relational and physical bullying victimization, as well as various other forms of emotional distress, are increasingly experienced by the transgender and gender diverse (TGD) adolescent population. Those who experience the most physical and relational bullying victimization and emotional distress, are AMAB youth whom others perceived as very, or mostly, feminine. Moreover, regardless of assigned gender at birth, relational bullying victimization, depression, and suicidal ideation is common among adolescents that can be perceived as anything other than very, or mostly, masculine.

Repeatedly, research on the effects of aggression and violence against TGD youth and young adults shows – when compared to their cisgender peers – higher rates of PTSD, depression, non-suicidal self-injury, suicidal ideation, intent, plan, and attempts, higher rates of substance use (cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana), trauma, skipping school due to safety concerns, and poorer health outcomes.

The 2015 United States Transgender Survey, the largest such survey ever carried out (with 27,715 respondents), found that one in ten respondents suffered transphobic violence at the hands of a family member and 8% were forced to leave their homes for being transgender. The majority of those who were openly transgender or perceived as transgender at school were victims of some form of mistreatment on account of this, including verbal abuse (54%), physical attacks (24%), and sexual assault (13%). 17% experienced such severe mistreatment that they had to leave school. Support from one&#x27;s community or family was correlated with more positive outcomes related to mental health and social functioning.

===Adulthood===
In adulthood, the effects of aggression and violence against various groups of transgender people has also been documented in domains such as mental and physical health, and safety and discrimination in the military. Transgender related bias, or discrimination, victimization, and rejection, affects transgender adults and the severity of PTSD symptoms they report. A systematic review completed in 2018 examined 77 studies that reported mental health disparities and social stress felt by TGD adults. The analysis found associations between TGD identity and anxiety, depression, PTSD, substance use, and suicidality, as well as added social stress factors such as violence, discrimination, and exclusion. When examining posttraumatic stress disorder and substance use in transgender adult communities, records indicated that transgender adults who have PTSD are more likely to be diagnosed with a substance use disorder within their lifetime. A National Institute of Health (NIH) analysis conducted with data collected at a community health center in the United States compared transgender and cisgender adult patients on various possible health disparities. Their research showed that within their lifetime, transgender patients experienced more violence, childhood abuse, discrimination, and suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts when compared to their cisgender counterparts who had a similar age, education, ethnicity/race, and income.

===United States military===
Strong associations between military sexual assault (MSA) and PTSD have been documented in both men and women. A nationwide survey of military personnel in 2015 found that 17.2% of transgender veterans reported experiencing MSA, and nearly two times more transgender men (30%) had a MSA experience when compared to transgender women (15.2%). Links have been found between MSA experienced by transgender veterans and increased depression symptom severity, drug use, and PTSD symptom severity.

Posttraumatic stress disorder has also been associated with suicidality and substance use among adults. For instance, records reflect that veterans who identify as transgender increasingly experience PTSD and suicide ideation, plans, and attempts. Further, transgender specific stigma experienced while in the military and PTSD have been associated with deaths by suicide.

This could be worsened by racial health disparities that exist within the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System. Particularly, racial health disparities between non-Hispanic Black transgender veterans (BTV) and non-Hispanic White transgender veterans (WTV) have been acknowledged. Non-Hispanic Black transgender veterans are at increased odds of having an array of physical health issues/diseases, serious mental illnesses, alcohol use, tobacco use, homelessness, and previous incarceration when compared to the WTV. Non-Hispanic White transgender veterans had increased odds of depression, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia when compared to BTV. Previous incarceration plays a larger role in the PTSD and homelessness that transgender veterans may experience. Specifically, transgender veterans that have a history of previous incarceration are more likely to have PTSD or to experience homelessness when compared to previously incarcerated veterans who are not transgender.

===Poverty and homelessness===
Nearly one third of U.S. transgender people responding to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey lived in poverty, compared to 14% of the population. During the 12 months prior to the survey, 30% of employed transgender people were either fired or mistreated for being transgender, from verbal abuse to sexual violence. 30% had been homeless at some point in their life, and 12% had been homeless during the previous year. Family and community support were correlated with significantly lower rates of homelessness and poverty.

===Violence and harassment===
During the year prior to the 2015 U.S. survey, 46% of respondents had been verbally harassed and 9% had been physically attacked for being transgender. 10% had been sexually assaulted during the previous year, and 47% had been sexually assaulted at some point in their life.

Evidence collected by the Transgender Day of Remembrance and National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs on the homicide rates of transgender individuals suggests that the homicide rates of young trans women who are Black or Latina are &quot;almost certainly higher&quot; than those of cisgender women of the same race.

====In public restrooms====
During the year prior to the 2015 U.S. survey, 12% of respondents reported being verbally harassed in a public restroom. 1% reported being sexually assaulted in a public restroom for being transgender, and 1% reported being otherwise physically assaulted for being transgender. 9% reported being denied the right to use a public restroom consistent with their gender.

===Health===
During the year prior to the 2015 U.S. survey, 59% of respondents reported avoiding using a public restroom out of fear of violence or harassment. 32% limited the amount they ate or drank in order to avoid using a public restroom. 8% reported suffering a urinary tract infection, kidney infection, or other kidney problem as a result of avoiding public restrooms.

33% reported having negative experiences with a healthcare professional related to being transgender, such as verbal harassment or denial of treatment. 23% reported that they did not seek treatment for a condition out of fear of being mistreated, while 33% did not seek treatment because they were unable to afford it.

During the month prior to the survey, 39% of American transgender people experienced major psychological distress, compared to 5% of the general population of the United States. 40% had attempted suicide at some point in their life, compared to 4.6 percent of the American population. Family and community support were correlated with far lower rates of suicide attempts and of major psychological distress.

A study conducted on transgender women of color in San Francisco has shown a higher correlation between transphobia and risk of transgender women engaging in HIV risk behavior. The study shows that the transgender youth face social discrimination, and they may not have a social role model. The young adults in this group have shown a higher risk of engaging in unprotected receptive anal intercourse when the exposure to transphobia is high. Therefore, as per the study shows a correlation between transphobia and high risk of HIV.

====Mental health====
People who are transgender are more likely to experience some type of psychological distress because of the harassment and discrimination that comes with transphobia. Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education conducted a nationwide survey on college campuses examining the psychological effects on transgender people, with a sample size of 86. Out of these 86 participants, 54% stated they have attended psychological counseling before and 10% had been hospitalized for reasons related to mental health. The final results of the study show that over twice as many participants who considered themselves transgender (43%) had engaged in self-injurious behavior, versus those who considered themselves male or female (16%).

According to Virupaksha, Muralidhar, and Ramakrishna, suicide attempts among transgender people globally range from 32% to 50%. In India, 31% to 50% of transgender people have tried to commit suicide before age 20. 50% of transgender people in Australia and 45% of those in England have attempted suicide at least once. In the United States, suicide attempts reported by transgender and gender nonconforming adults exceed the rate of the general population: 41% versus 4.6 percent. In San Francisco alone, the suicide attempt rate among transgender people is 32% overall, and for those under age 25 it is 50%.

According to the study &quot;Transphobia Among Transgenders of Color&quot; by the University of California, San Francisco, transphobia affects the psychological vulnerability of transgender people of color as compared to those of other ethnicities. Acts of transphobia such as undue denial of services, unfair dismissal from work places or stigmatization have far-reaching effects on the subjects such as low self-esteem, under-performance, stress, withdrawal or even depression. When it comes to the minorities, who are already proven to be undergoing various forms of discrimination, the consequences are even more exaggerated. Transgender people of color are more significantly associated with depression than their white counterparts.

Information regarding the effects of transphobia with respect to minority identities has not been well documented. In a 2018 review of mental health research regarding transgender individuals, only 4 out of 77 studies that were reviewed examined the intersectionality of transgender and racial identities. There were other studies that included disproportionately high amounts of transgender individuals who are in multiple minority groups, but the authors note that it is difficult to tell if these studies generalize to the transgender/ gender nonconforming community as a whole due to lack of extensive study.

To help transgender people work through traumatic experiences, minority stress, and internalized transphobia, mental health practitioners have begun integrating the gender-affirmative model into cognitive behavioral therapy, person-centered therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy.

====Pregnancy issues====

Many transgender people transition without undergoing surgery to remove reproductive organs or to reconstruct genitals, thus transition does not necessarily remove the ability or the desire to reproduce. While the same-sex issues surrounding the birth and parenting of children have gained a degree of acceptance, trans practices of parenting have received much less attention and acceptance. In 2007 a transgender man, Thomas Beatie, became pregnant because his wife was infertile. His pregnancy drew world-wide attention. He commented:

Doctors have discriminated against us, turning us away due to their religious beliefs. Health care professionals have refused to call me by a male pronoun or recognize Nancy as my wife. Receptionists have laughed at us. Friends and family have been unsupportive; most of Nancy&#x27;s family doesn&#x27;t even know I&#x27;m transgender.

<text>Year 409 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Cossus and Medullinus (or, less frequently, year 345 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 409 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* Alcibiades recaptures Byzantium, ending the city&#x27;s rebellion from Athens. This action completes Athenian control of the Bosporus which secures the Athenian supply route for grain from the Bosporan Kingdom in the Black Sea region.
* The Athenian general, Thrasyllus, sails out from Athens with a sizable force to campaign in Ionia. There, he quickly captures Colophon and raids the Ionian countryside, but is defeated outside Ephesus by a combined Ephesian, Persian, and Syracusan force.
* Pausanias succeeds his father Pleistoanax as Agiad king of Sparta.
* The city of Rhodes is founded.

==== Sicily ====
* Taking advantage of the quarrels between the Greek cities in Sicily and of the mutual exhaustion of Athens and Syracuse, Carthage seeks to reimpose its influence over the island. Hannibal Mago, grandson of Hamilcar, invades Sicily with a strong force. He defeats the Sicilian Greeks and avenges his grandfather through the torture and killing of 3,000 Greek prisoners. In the Battle of Selinus and Battle of Himera he captures and destroys both cities before returning triumphantly to Carthage with the spoils of war.

=== By topic ===

==== Literature ====
* Sophocles&#x27; play &quot;Philoctetes&quot; is performed, with the theme of the Trojan War.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Deaths ==
* Pleistoanax, king of Sparta since 458 BC

<text>The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant; it is said to be &quot;conserved&quot; over time. In the case of a closed system, the principle says that the total amount of energy within the system can only be changed through energy entering or leaving the system. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another. For instance, chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy when a stick of dynamite explodes. If one adds up all forms of energy that were released in the explosion, such as the kinetic energy and potential energy of the pieces, as well as heat and sound, one will get the exact decrease of chemical energy in the combustion of the dynamite.

Classically, the conservation of energy was distinct from the conservation of mass. However, special relativity shows that mass is related to energy and vice versa by formula_1, the equation representing mass–energy equivalence, and science now takes the view that mass-energy as a whole is conserved. This implies that mass can be converted to energy, and vice versa. This is observed in the nuclear binding energy of atomic nuclei, where a mass defect is measured. It is believed that mass-energy equivalence becomes important in extreme physical conditions, such as those that likely existed in the universe very shortly after the Big Bang or when black holes emit Hawking radiation.

Given the stationary-action principle, the conservation of energy can be rigorously proven by Noether&#x27;s theorem as a consequence of continuous time translation symmetry; that is, from the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.

A consequence of the law of conservation of energy is that a perpetual motion machine of the first kind cannot exist; that is to say, no system without an external energy supply can deliver an unlimited amount of energy to its surroundings. Depending on the definition of energy, the conservation of energy can arguably be violated by general relativity on the cosmological scale. In quantum mechanics, Noether&#x27;s theorem is known to apply to the expected value, making any consistent conservation violation provably impossible, but whether individual conservation-violating events could ever exist or be observed is subject to some debate.

==History==

Ancient philosophers as far back as Thales of Miletus  550 BCE had inklings of the conservation of some underlying substance of which everything is made. However, there is no particular reason to identify their theories with what we know today as &quot;mass-energy&quot; (for example, Thales thought it was water). Empedocles (490–430 BCE) wrote that in his universal system, composed of four roots (earth, air, water, fire), &quot;nothing comes to be or perishes&quot;; instead, these elements suffer continual rearrangement. Epicurus ( 350 BCE) on the other hand believed everything in the universe to be composed of indivisible units of matter—the ancient precursor to &#x27;atoms&#x27;—and he too had some idea of the necessity of conservation, stating that &quot;the sum total of things was always such as it is now, and such it will ever remain.&quot;

In 1605, the Flemish scientist Simon Stevin was able to solve a number of problems in statics based on the principle that perpetual motion was impossible.

In 1639, Galileo published his analysis of several situations—including the celebrated &quot;interrupted pendulum&quot;—which can be described (in modern language) as conservatively converting potential energy to kinetic energy and back again. Essentially, he pointed out that the height a moving body rises is equal to the height from which it falls, and used this observation to infer the idea of inertia. The remarkable aspect of this observation is that the height to which a moving body ascends on a frictionless surface does not depend on the shape of the surface.

In 1669, Christiaan Huygens published a brief account on his laws of collision. Among the quantities he listed as being invariant before and after the collision of bodies were both the sum of their linear momenta as well as the sum of their kinetic energies. However, the difference between elastic and inelastic collision was not understood at the time. This led to the dispute among later researchers as to which of these conserved quantities was the more fundamental. In his &quot;Horologium Oscillatorium&quot;, Huygens gave a much clearer statement regarding the height of ascent of a moving body, and connected this idea with the impossibility of perpetual motion. His study of the dynamics of pendulum motion was based on a single principle, known as Torricelli&#x27;s Principle: that the center of gravity of a heavy object, or collection of objects, cannot lift itself. Using this principle, Huygens was able to derive the formula for the center of oscillation by an &quot;energy&quot; method, without dealing with forces or torques.
Between 1676 and 1689, Gottfried Leibniz first attempted a mathematical formulation of the kind of energy that is associated with &quot;motion&quot; (kinetic energy). Using Huygens&#x27;s work on collision, Leibniz noticed that in many mechanical systems (of several masses &quot;mi&quot;, each with velocity &quot;vi&quot;),
:formula_2

was conserved so long as the masses did not interact. He called this quantity the &quot;vis viva&quot; or &quot;living force&quot; of the system. The principle represents an accurate statement of the approximate conservation of kinetic energy in situations where there is no friction. Many physicists at that time, including Isaac Newton, held that the conservation of momentum, which holds even in systems with friction, as defined by the momentum:

:formula_3

was the conserved &quot;vis viva&quot;. It was later shown that both quantities are conserved simultaneously given the proper conditions, such as in an elastic collision.

In 1687, Isaac Newton published his &quot;Principia&quot;, which set out his laws of motion. It was organized around the concept of force and momentum. However, the researchers were quick to recognize that the principles set out in the book, while fine for point masses, were not sufficient to tackle the motions of rigid and fluid bodies. Some other principles were also required.

By the 1690s, Leibniz was arguing that conservation of &quot;vis viva&quot; and conservation of momentum undermined the then-popular philosophical doctrine of interactionist dualism. (During the 19th century, when conservation of energy was better understood, Leibniz&#x27;s basic argument would gain widespread acceptance. Some modern scholars continue to champion specifically conservation-based attacks on dualism, while others subsume the argument into a more general argument about causal closure.)

The law of conservation of vis viva was championed by the father and son duo, Johann and Daniel Bernoulli. The former enunciated the principle of virtual work as used in statics in its full generality in 1715, while the latter based his &quot;Hydrodynamica&quot;, published in 1738, on this single vis viva conservation principle. Daniel&#x27;s study of loss of vis viva of flowing water led him to formulate the Bernoulli&#x27;s principle, which asserts the loss to be proportional to the change in hydrodynamic pressure. Daniel also formulated the notion of work and efficiency for hydraulic machines; and he gave a kinetic theory of gases, and linked the kinetic energy of gas molecules with the temperature of the gas.

This focus on the vis viva by the continental physicists eventually led to the discovery of stationarity principles governing mechanics, such as the D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian formulations of mechanics.


Émilie du Châtelet (1706–1749) proposed and tested the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. Inspired by the theories of Gottfried Leibniz, she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by Willem &#x27;s Gravesande in 1722 in which balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball&#x27;s kinetic energy—as indicated by the quantity of material displaced—was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity. The deformation of the clay was found to be directly proportional to the height from which the balls were dropped, equal to the initial potential energy. Some earlier workers, including Newton and Voltaire, had believed that &quot;energy&quot; was not distinct from momentum and therefore proportional to velocity. According to this understanding, the deformation of the clay should have been proportional to the square root of the height from which the balls were dropped. In classical physics, the correct formula is formula_4, where formula_5 is the kinetic energy of an object, formula_6 its mass and formula_7 its speed. On this basis, du Châtelet proposed that energy must always have the same dimensions in any form, which is necessary to be able to consider it in different forms (kinetic, potential, heat, ...).

Engineers such as John Smeaton, Peter Ewart, , Gustave-Adolphe Hirn, and Marc Seguin recognized that conservation of momentum alone was not adequate for practical calculation and made use of Leibniz&#x27;s principle. The principle was also championed by some chemists such as William Hyde Wollaston. Academics such as John Playfair were quick to point out that kinetic energy is clearly not conserved. This is obvious to a modern analysis based on the second law of thermodynamics, but in the 18th and 19th centuries, the fate of the lost energy was still unknown.

Gradually it came to be suspected that the heat inevitably generated by motion under friction was another form of &quot;vis viva&quot;. In 1783, Antoine Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon Laplace reviewed the two competing theories of &quot;vis viva&quot; and caloric theory. Count Rumford&#x27;s 1798 observations of heat generation during the boring of cannons added more weight to the view that mechanical motion could be converted into heat and (that it was important) that the conversion was quantitative and could be predicted (allowing for a universal conversion constant between kinetic energy and heat). &quot;Vis viva&quot; then started to be known as &quot;energy&quot;, after the term was first used in that sense by Thomas Young in 1807.

The recalibration of &quot;vis viva&quot; to

:formula_8

which can be understood as converting kinetic energy to work, was largely the result of Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis and Jean-Victor Poncelet over the period 1819–1839. The former called the quantity &quot;quantité de travail&quot; (quantity of work) and the latter, &quot;travail mécanique&quot; (mechanical work), and both championed its use in engineering calculations.

In the paper &quot;Über die Natur der Wärme&quot; (German &quot;On the Nature of Heat/Warmth&quot;), published in the in 1837, Karl Friedrich Mohr gave one of the earliest general statements of the doctrine of the conservation of energy: &quot;besides the 54 known chemical elements there is in the physical world one agent only, and this is called &quot;Kraft&quot; [energy or work]. It may appear, according to circumstances, as motion, chemical affinity, cohesion, electricity, light and magnetism; and from any one of these forms it can be transformed into any of the others.&quot;

===Mechanical equivalent of heat===
A key stage in the development of the modern conservation principle was the demonstration of the &quot;mechanical equivalent of heat&quot;. The caloric theory maintained that heat could neither be created nor destroyed, whereas conservation of energy entails the contrary principle that heat and mechanical work are interchangeable.

In the middle of the eighteenth century, Mikhail Lomonosov, a Russian scientist, postulated his corpusculo-kinetic theory of heat, which rejected the idea of a caloric. Through the results of empirical studies, Lomonosov came to the conclusion that heat was not transferred through the particles of the caloric fluid.

In 1798, Count Rumford (Benjamin Thompson) performed measurements of the frictional heat generated in boring cannons and developed the idea that heat is a form of kinetic energy; his measurements refuted caloric theory, but were imprecise enough to leave room for doubt.

The mechanical equivalence principle was first stated in its modern form by the German surgeon Julius Robert von Mayer in 1842. Mayer reached his conclusion on a voyage to the Dutch East Indies, where he found that his patients&#x27; blood was a deeper red because they were consuming less oxygen, and therefore less energy, to maintain their body temperature in the hotter climate. He discovered that heat and mechanical work were both forms of energy, and in 1845, after improving his knowledge of physics, he published a monograph that stated a quantitative relationship between them.

Meanwhile, in 1843, James Prescott Joule independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. In one of them, now called the &quot;Joule apparatus&quot;, a descending weight attached to a string caused a paddle immersed in water to rotate. He showed that the gravitational potential energy lost by the weight in descending was equal to the internal energy gained by the water through friction with the paddle.

Over the period 1840–1843, similar work was carried out by engineer Ludwig A. Colding, although it was little known outside his native Denmark.

Both Joule&#x27;s and Mayer&#x27;s work suffered from resistance and neglect but it was Joule&#x27;s that eventually drew the wider recognition.

In 1844, the Welsh scientist William Robert Grove postulated a relationship between mechanics, heat, light, electricity, and magnetism by treating them all as manifestations of a single &quot;force&quot; (&quot;energy&quot; in modern terms). In 1846, Grove published his theories in his book &quot;The Correlation of Physical Forces&quot;. In 1847, drawing on the earlier work of Joule, Sadi Carnot, and Émile Clapeyron, Hermann von Helmholtz arrived at conclusions similar to Grove&#x27;s and published his theories in his book &quot;Über die Erhaltung der Kraft&quot; (&quot;On the Conservation of Force&quot;, 1847). The general modern acceptance of the principle stems from this publication.

In 1850, the Scottish mathematician William Rankine first used the phrase &quot;the law of the conservation of energy&quot; for the principle.

In 1877, Peter Guthrie Tait claimed that the principle originated with Sir Isaac Newton, based on a creative reading of propositions 40 and 41 of the &quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;. This is now regarded as an example of Whig history.

===Mass–energy equivalence===
Matter is composed of atoms and what makes up atoms. Matter has &quot;intrinsic&quot; or &quot;rest&quot; mass. In the limited range of recognized experience of the nineteenth century, it was found that such rest mass is conserved. Einstein&#x27;s 1905 theory of special relativity showed that rest mass corresponds to an equivalent amount of &quot;rest energy&quot;. This means that &quot;rest mass&quot; can be converted to or from equivalent amounts of (non-material) forms of energy, for example, kinetic energy, potential energy, and electromagnetic radiant energy. When this happens, as recognized in twentieth-century experience, rest mass is not conserved, unlike the &quot;total&quot; mass or &quot;total&quot; energy. All forms of energy contribute to the total mass and total energy.

For example, an electron and a positron each have rest mass. They can perish together, converting their combined rest energy into photons which have electromagnetic radiant energy but no rest mass. If this occurs within an isolated system that does not release the photons or their energy into the external surroundings, then neither the total &quot;mass&quot; nor the total &quot;energy&quot; of the system will change. The produced electromagnetic radiant energy contributes just as much to the inertia (and to any weight) of the system as did the rest mass of the electron and positron before their demise. Likewise, non-material forms of energy can perish into matter, which has rest mass.

Thus, conservation of energy (&quot;total&quot;, including material or &quot;rest&quot; energy) and conservation of mass (&quot;total&quot;, not just &quot;rest&quot;) are one (equivalent) law. In the 18th century, these had appeared as two seemingly-distinct laws.

===Conservation of energy in beta decay===

The discovery in 1911 that electrons emitted in beta decay have a continuous rather than a discrete spectrum appeared to contradict conservation of energy, under the then-current assumption that beta decay is the simple emission of an electron from a nucleus. This problem was eventually resolved in 1933 by Enrico Fermi who proposed the correct description of beta-decay as the emission of both an electron and an antineutrino, which carries away the apparently missing energy.

==First law of thermodynamics==
For a closed thermodynamic system, the first law of thermodynamics may be stated as:

:formula_9, or equivalently, formula_10

where formula_11 is the quantity of energy added to the system by a heating process, formula_12 is the quantity of energy lost by the system due to work done by the system on its surroundings, and formula_13 is the change in the internal energy of the system.

The δ&#x27;s before the heat and work terms are used to indicate that they describe an increment of energy which is to be interpreted somewhat differently than the formula_13 increment of internal energy (see Inexact differential). Work and heat refer to kinds of process which add or subtract energy to or from a system, while the internal energy formula_15 is a property of a particular state of the system when it is in unchanging thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus the term &quot;heat energy&quot; for formula_11 means &quot;that amount of energy added as a result of heating&quot; rather than referring to a particular form of energy. Likewise, the term &quot;work energy&quot; for formula_12 means &quot;that amount of energy lost as a result of work&quot;. Thus one can state the amount of internal energy possessed by a thermodynamic system that one knows is presently in a given state, but one cannot tell, just from knowledge of the given present state, how much energy has in the past flowed into or out of the system as a result of its being heated or cooled, nor as a result of work being performed on or by the system.

Entropy is a function of the state of a system which tells of limitations of the possibility of conversion of heat into work.

For a simple compressible system, the work performed by the system may be written:

:formula_18

where formula_19 is the pressure and formula_20 is a small change in the volume of the system, each of which are system variables. In the fictive case in which the process is idealized and infinitely slow, so as to be called &quot;quasi-static&quot;, and regarded as reversible, the heat being transferred from a source with temperature infinitesimally above the system temperature, the heat energy may be written

:formula_21

where formula_22 is the temperature and formula_23 is a small change in the entropy of the system. Temperature and entropy are variables of the state of a system.

If an open system (in which mass may be exchanged with the environment) has several walls such that the mass transfer is through rigid walls separate from the heat and work transfers, then the first law may be written as

:formula_24

where formula_25 is the added mass of species formula_26 and formula_27 is the corresponding enthalpy per unit mass. Note that generally formula_28 in this case, as matter carries its own entropy. Instead, formula_29, where formula_30 is the entropy per unit mass of type formula_26, from which we recover the fundamental thermodynamic relation

:formula_32

because the chemical potential formula_33 is the partial molar Gibbs free energy of species formula_26 and the Gibbs free energy formula_35.

==Noether&#x27;s theorem==

The conservation of energy is a common feature in many physical theories. From a mathematical point of view it is understood as a consequence of Noether&#x27;s theorem, developed by Emmy Noether in 1915 and first published in 1918. In any physical theory that obeys the stationary-action principle, the theorem states that every continuous symmetry has an associated conserved quantity; if the theory&#x27;s symmetry is time invariance, then the conserved quantity is called &quot;energy&quot;. The energy conservation law is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time; energy conservation is implied by the empirical fact that the laws of physics do not change with time itself. Philosophically this can be stated as &quot;nothing depends on time per se&quot;. In other words, if the physical system is invariant under the continuous symmetry of time translation, then its energy (which is the canonical conjugate quantity to time) is conserved. Conversely, systems that are not invariant under shifts in time (e.g. systems with time-dependent potential energy) do not exhibit conservation of energy – unless we consider them to exchange energy with another, external system so that the theory of the enlarged system becomes time-invariant again. Conservation of energy for finite systems is valid in physical theories such as special relativity and quantum theory (including QED) in the flat space-time.

==Special relativity==
With the discovery of special relativity by Henri Poincaré and Albert Einstein, the energy was proposed to be a component of an energy-momentum 4-vector. Each of the four components (one of energy and three of momentum) of this vector is separately conserved across time, in any closed system, as seen from any given inertial reference frame. Also conserved is the vector length (Minkowski norm), which is the rest mass for single particles, and the invariant mass for systems of particles (where momenta and energy are separately summed before the length is calculated).

The relativistic energy of a single massive particle contains a term related to its rest mass in addition to its kinetic energy of motion. In the limit of zero kinetic energy (or equivalently in the rest frame) of a massive particle, or else in the center of momentum frame for objects or systems which retain kinetic energy, the total energy of a particle or object (including internal kinetic energy in systems) is proportional to the rest mass or invariant mass, as described by the equation formula_36.

Thus, the rule of &quot;conservation of energy&quot; over time in special relativity continues to hold, so long as the reference frame of the observer is unchanged. This applies to the total energy of systems, although different observers disagree as to the energy value. Also conserved, and invariant to all observers, is the invariant mass, which is the minimal system mass and energy that can be seen by any observer, and which is defined by the energy–momentum relation.

==General relativity==
General relativity introduces new phenomena. In an expanding universe, photons spontaneously redshift and tethers spontaneously gain tension; if vacuum energy is positive, the total vacuum energy of the universe appears to spontaneously increase as the volume of space increases. Some scholars claim that energy is no longer meaningfully conserved in any identifiable form.

John Baez&#x27;s view is that energy–momentum conservation is not well-defined except in certain special cases. Energy-momentum is typically expressed with the aid of a stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor. However, since pseudotensors are not tensors, they do not transform cleanly between reference frames. If the metric under consideration is static (that is, does not change with time) or asymptotically flat (that is, at an infinite distance away spacetime looks empty), then energy conservation holds without major pitfalls. In practice, some metrics, notably the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric that appears to govern the universe, do not satisfy these constraints and energy conservation is not well defined. Besides being dependent on the coordinate system, pseudotensor energy is dependent on the type of pseudotensor in use; for example, the energy exterior to a Kerr–Newman black hole is twice as large when calculated from Møller&#x27;s pseudotensor as it is when calculated using the Einstein pseudotensor.

For asymptotically flat universes, Einstein and others salvage conservation of energy by introducing a specific global gravitational potential energy that cancels out mass-energy changes triggered by spacetime expansion or contraction. This global energy has no well-defined density and cannot technically be applied to a non-asymptotically flat universe; however, for practical purposes this can be finessed, and so by this view, energy is conserved in our universe. Alan Guth stated that the universe might be &quot;the ultimate free lunch&quot;, and theorized that, when accounting for gravitational potential energy, the net energy of the Universe is zero.

==Quantum theory==
In quantum mechanics, the energy of a quantum system is described by a self-adjoint (or Hermitian) operator called the Hamiltonian, which acts on the Hilbert space (or a space of wave functions) of the system. If the Hamiltonian is a time-independent operator, emergence probability of the measurement result does not change in time over the evolution of the system. Thus the expectation value of energy is also time independent. The local energy conservation in quantum field theory is ensured by the quantum Noether&#x27;s theorem for the energy-momentum tensor operator. Thus energy is conserved by the normal unitary evolution of a quantum system.

However, when the non-unitary Born rule is applied, the system&#x27;s energy is measured with an energy that can be below or above the expectation value, if the system was not in an energy eigenstate. (For macroscopic systems, this effect is usually too small to measure.) The disposition of this energy gap is not well-understood; most physicists believe that the energy is transferred to or from the macroscopic environment in the course of the measurement process, while others believe that the observable energy is only conserved &quot;on average&quot;. No experiment has been confirmed as definitive evidence of violations of the conservation of energy principle in quantum mechanics, but that does not rule out that some newer experiments, as proposed, may find evidence of violations of the conservation of energy principle in quantum mechanics.

==Status==
In the context of perpetual motion machines such as the Orbo, Professor Eric Ash has argued at the BBC: &quot;Denying [conservation of energy] would undermine not just little bits of science - the whole edifice would be no more. All of the technology on which we built the modern world would lie in ruins&quot;. It is because of conservation of energy that &quot;we know - without having to examine details of a particular device - that Orbo cannot work.&quot;

Energy conservation has been a foundational physical principle for about two hundred years. From the point of view of modern general relativity, the lab environment can be well approximated by Minkowski spacetime, where energy is exactly conserved. The entire Earth can be well approximated by the Schwarzschild metric, where again energy is exactly conserved. Given all the experimental evidence, any new theory (such as quantum gravity), in order to be successful, will have to explain why energy has appeared to always be exactly conserved in terrestrial experiments. In some speculative theories, corrections to quantum mechanics are too small to be detected at anywhere near the current TeV level accessible through particle accelerators. Doubly special relativity models may argue for a breakdown in energy-momentum conservation for sufficiently energetic particles; such models are constrained by observations that cosmic rays appear to travel for billions of years without displaying anomalous non-conservation behavior. Some interpretations of quantum mechanics claim that observed energy tends to increase when the Born rule is applied due to localization of the wave function. If true, objects could be expected to spontaneously heat up; thus, such models are constrained by observations of large, cool astronomical objects as well as the observation of (often supercooled) laboratory experiments.

Milton A. Rothman wrote that the law of conservation of energy has been verified by nuclear physics experiments to an accuracy of one part in a thousand million million (1015). He then defines its precision as &quot;perfect for all practical purposes&quot;.

<doc id="67111" wikidata="Q1307404" url="?curid=67111" title="Magnoliopsida">
<text>Magnoliopsida is a valid botanical name for a class of flowering plants. By definition the class will include the family Magnoliaceae, but its can otherwise vary, being more inclusive or less inclusive depending upon the classification system being discussed.
== Classification ==
===Cronquist and Takhtajan systems===
In the Takhtajan system and the Cronquist system, the name was used for the group known as dicotyledons.

The Takhtajan system used this internal taxonomy:

* class Magnoliopsida (= dicotyledons)
** subclass Magnoliidae
** subclass Nymphaeidae
** subclass Nelumbonidae
** subclass Ranunculidae
** subclass Caryophyllidae
** subclass Hamamelididae
** subclass Dilleniidae
** subclass Rosidae
** subclass Cornidae
** subclass Asteridae
** subclass Lamiidae

The Cronquist system used this internal taxonomy (in the 1981 version):
* class Magnoliopsida (= dicotyledons)
** subclass Magnoliidae
** subclass Hamamelidae
** subclass Caryophyllidae
** subclass Dilleniidae
** subclass Rosidae
** subclass Asteridae

The Cronquist system has been very popular, and there have been many versions of the system published. In some of these Cronquist-based systems the name Magnoliopsida (at the rank of class) refers to the flowering plants (angiosperms).

===Dahlgren and Thorne systems===
The Dahlgren system and the Thorne system (1992) used the name Magnoliopsida for the flowering plants.

* class Magnoliopsida (= angiosperms)
** subclass Magnoliidae (= dicotyledons)
** subclass Liliidae (= monocotyledons)

=== Reveal system ===
The Reveal system used the name Magnoliopsida for a group of the primitive dicotyledons, corresponding to about half of the plants in the magnoliids:

* class 1. Magnoliopsida
** superorder 1. Magnolianae
** superorder 2. Lauranae

===APG systems===
In the APG and APG II systems, botanical names are used only at the rank of order and below. Above the rank of order, these systems use their own names, such as angiosperms, eudicots, monocots, rosids, etc. These names refer to clades (unranked). The class Magnoliopsida is not defined. The idea that dicotyledons are a taxonomic unit and require a formal name is rejected by the APG: the dicots are considered to be paraphyletic.

<doc id="67116" wikidata="Q311048" url="?curid=67116" title="Donovan Bailey">
<text>Donovan Bailey (born December 16, 1967) is a retired Jamaican-Canadian sprinter. He once held the world record for the 100 metres. He recorded a time of 9.84 seconds to become Olympic champion in 1996. He was the first Canadian to legally break the 10-second barrier in the 100 m. Particularly noted for his top speed, Bailey ran in his 1996 Olympic title run, the fastest ever recorded by a human at the time. He was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 2004 as an individual athlete and in 2008 as part of the 1996 Summer Olympics 4x100 relay team. In 2005, he was also inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Donovan Anthony Bailey was born in Manchester Parish, Jamaica on December 16, 1967, as the fourth of five sons to George and Daisy Bailey. Before going to Mount Olivet Primary School, he would take care of his family&#x27;s chickens, goats, and pigs. Donovan was fast when he was a young boy, with his former teacher Claris Lambert recounting that &quot;He showed his athletic skills from grade one. He always came first in races.&quot;

Before going to Canada, Bailey competed for one year at ISSA Champs for Knox College in Manchester, Jamaica.

Bailey immigrated to Canada at age 12 and played basketball before graduating from Queen Elizabeth Park High School in Oakville, Ontario. During high school, his brother, O&#x27;Neil, won 4 Ontario Provincial titles in the long jump. Bailey was exceptionally fast as well, clocking 10.65 seconds in the 100m at the age of 16. However, his main interest was in basketball. After graduating in June 1984, Bailey attended Sheridan College, for which he played basketball during the 1986–1987 school year. He graduated from Sheridan with a degree in Business Administration. Bailey then began working as a property and marketing consultant for an importing and exporting clothing company.

==Career==
===Early career===
It was only in 1990 that Bailey decided to begin racing professionally; after watching the 1990 Canadian Track and Field Championships, he realized that most of the men competing were men he had beaten in high school. He began training as a 100m sprinter part-time, while working as a stockbroker. In 1991, he won the 60 metres at the Ontario Indoor Championships, and at the 1991 Pan American Games in Havana, Cuba, Bailey anchored Canada&#x27;s 4 × 100 metres relay team, to a silver medal. In 1992, Bailey finished second in the 100m at the national championships.

From 1993 to 1994, he competed for Fenerbahçe Athletics. During this time, he claimed a bronze in the 100m and a silver in the 200m at the 1993 national championships, a silver in the 100m and gold in the 4 × 100 metres at the 1994 Francophone Games in Paris, and a gold medal in the at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia. However, despite his impressive performances at a national level, he was only chosen as an alternate for the at the 1993 World Championships in Stuttgart. American coach Dan Pfaff, who coached Bailey&#x27;s high school friend Glenroy Gilbert at Louisiana State University and listened to Bailey&#x27;s complaints, was impressed by Bailey&#x27;s performances considering his terrible form and fitness. Pfaff invited Bailey to train with him and Gilbert at LSU, and with just 3 months of training together, Bailey shaved 3 tenths of a second off of his 100m personal best; his time of 10.03 seconds was the third fastest in Canadian history.

===1995: Breakthrough===
On April 22, 1995, Bailey made history by breaking the 10-second barrier for the first time in the 100m, becoming the 18th man and 2nd Canadian to legally do so. His time of 9.99 seconds was just 4 hundredths shy of Ben Johnson&#x27;s record of 9.95. In July, he broke Johnson&#x27;s record with 9.91 at the national championships, the fastest time of the year, effectively asserting his name as a favorite for the gold medal at the World Championships in Gothenburg later that year. Bailey went on to win the title in 9.97 seconds, then followed it up by anchoring Canada to their first world championship gold in the .

===1996: Olympic History===
With a world title now under his belt, Bailey was highly considered to be a favorite for the Olympic title in Atlanta that July. As a precursor to the centennial Olympics, Bailey broke the indoor 50 m world record during a competition in Reno, Nevada in 1996. He was timed at 5.56 seconds. Maurice Greene later matched that performance in 1999, but his run was never ratified as a world record.

Bailey was officially selected to represent Canada at the 1996 Summer Olympics after winning his 3rd consecutive national title in the 100m. On July 27, after a very disrupted start to the race, Bailey won the Olympic 100m title setting a new world record of 9.84 seconds. During the race, he hit a top speed of 12.10 m/s (43.6 km/h or 27.1 mph), which was the fastest top speed ever recorded by a human being at the time. Many Canadians felt Bailey&#x27;s victory restored the image of Canadian athletes, after the exposure of Ben Johnson&#x27;s history of doping. At the time, Bailey was only the second person after Carl Lewis to hold all the major titles in the 100m concurrently (World Champion, Olympic Champion &amp; World Record Holder). 6 days later, he completed the 100m/ double once again, anchoring Canada to their first ever Olympic title in a national record of 37.69 seconds.

===Rivalry with Michael Johnson===
After the end of the 1996 Summer Olympics, American Sportscaster Bob Costas claimed that 200m Gold medalist Michael Johnson was faster than Bailey because Johnson&#x27;s 200m time (19.32 Seconds) divided by 2 (9.66 Seconds) was shorter than Bailey&#x27;s 100m time (9.84). This started a debate on whether Johnson or Bailey was the real &quot;World&#x27;s Fastest Man&quot;, which in turn resulted in a 150m race between the two, in which Bailey won after Johnson allegedly injured his hamstring.

===1997 World Championships===
At the 1997 World Championships in Athens, Bailey attempted to defend his 100m title, but was beaten by Maurice Greene and was forced to settle for the silver medal in 9.91 seconds. However, along with his Canadian teammates, he was able to defend Canada&#x27;s title in 37.86 seconds, the fastest time of the year. One of his last meets of the season was at the ISTAF Berlin; after finishing 2nd in the 100m, Bailey ran the first leg of the &quot;Dream Team II&quot; in the relay: Carl Lewis&#x27; last race of his career. With Leroy Burrell on the 2nd leg, Frankie Fredericks on the 3rd, and Lewis on the anchor, the team won in 38.24 seconds, a meeting record.

===1998 Goodwill Games===
Bailey and the 4 x 100 metre Canadian relay team won a silver medal with a time of 38.23 at the 1998 Goodwill Games in New York, finishing behind the United States. Bailey ruptured his Achilles tendon while playing basketball during the post season of 1998, which effectively began the end of his athletics career.

===1999 Pan American Games and World Championships===
Bailey won a silver medal with the Canadian 4 x 100 metre relay team with a time of 38.49 at the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, finishing behind Brazil. The silver medal matched his first international medal he won eight years earlier at the 1991 Pan American Games in the 4 x 100 metre relay and it would be his final international medal. Bailey was part of the Canadian 4 x 100 metre relay team at the 1999 World Championships in Seville but the team was disqualified in the first round of heats.

===2000 Summer Olympics and 2001 World Championships===
He made a second attempt in the 2000 Summer Olympics, but suffered from pneumonia and dropped out during the rounds. He retired from the sport in 2001 after the World Championships in Edmonton, having been a three-time World and 2 time Olympic champion.

==Post-retirement==
After racing, Bailey started his own company called DBX Sport Management which helps amateur athletes find a way to promote themselves. He also started a sport injury clinic in Oakville, Ontario.

He has been inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame twice: in 2004 as an individual, and in 2008 as part of the 1996 Summer Olympics 4 × 100 relay team.

In August 2008 Bailey began work as a track commentator for CBC Television at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He estimated that had Usain Bolt not slowed down near the end of the 100m dash (which he still won in record time), he could have set a time of 9.55 seconds. He returned as the track analyst for CBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics.

In 2010, Bailey was one of the recipients of the Top 25 Canadian Immigrant Awards presented by Canadian Immigrant Magazine.

In 2014, Bailey pleaded guilty to a drinking and driving charge from 2012. This was the third driving-related incident for Bailey. In 1998 he crashed his car into a concrete utility pole and was fined $200 for failing to report an accident. In 2001, Bailey was fined $975 for driving 200 km/h on a 100 km/h road in Toronto.

In 2016, he was made a member of the Order of Ontario. In 2017, Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame honoured him with a star.

In 2018, it was reported that Bailey had provided his entire athlete&#x27;s trust of $3.75 million to Aird &amp; Berlis lawyer Stuart Bollefer, who invested it in what was determined to be a tax evasion scheme by the Canadian government. Bailey lost the full amount due to the scheme, however the courts ordered Aird &amp; Berlis to pay all outstanding taxes due to their negligence.

In 2022, Bailey was named an officer to the Order of Canada.

<text>Linford Christie (born 2 April 1960) is a Jamaican-born British former sprinter and athletics coach. He is the only British man to have won gold medals in the 100 metres at all four major competitions open to British athletes: the Olympic Games, the World Championships, the European Championships and the Commonwealth Games. He was the first European athlete to break the 10-second barrier in the 100 m and held the British record in the event for close to 30 years. He is a former world indoor record holder over 200 metres, and a former European record holder in the 60 metres, 100 m and 4 × 100 metres relay.

He remains one of the most highly decorated British athletes of all-time. By the end of his track career Christie had won 24 medals overall, more than any other British male athlete before or since. In 1993 he was awarded the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

Christie tested positive for a banned stimulant in 1988 during the Seoul Olympics. In 1999 he was suspended for two years by the IAAF after the banned substance nandrolone was found in a test, although he had been effectively in retirement since 1997.

As a coach, two of his charges, Darren Campbell and Katharine Merry, went on to win Olympic and World medals.

==Early life and education==
Christie was born on 2 April 1960 in Saint Andrew, Jamaica, where he was brought up by his maternal grandmother. At the age of seven he joined his parents, who had emigrated to Acton, London, England, five years before. He was educated at Henry Compton Secondary School in Fulham, London and excelled in physical education. He competed in the very first London Youth Games in 1977 for the borough of Hammersmith &amp; Fulham. He also joined the Air Training Corps in 1978, 336 (Hammersmith) Squadron. He did not take up athletics seriously until he was 18.

==Professional athletics career==
Christie&#x27;s early track career was not particularly promising. A comparatively slow starter, he failed to make the Great Britain team for the 1984 Summer Olympics, not even being included in the sprint relay squad. It was not until some years after he had begun to work in earnest on his running technique under the coaching guidance of Ron Roddan in 1979 that he fulfilled his potential.

In 1986, he was the surprise winner of the 100 m at the European Championships and finished second in the same event at the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, behind Ben Johnson. At the 1987 World Championships in Athletics in Rome, Christie came fourth in the 100 m, but was later awarded the bronze medal, when winner Johnson was disqualified after admitting years of steroid use.

At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Christie won the 100 m silver behind Carl Lewis after Johnson, who set a world record in 9.79 seconds, was again disqualified following a positive drug test. Christie&#x27;s time was 9.97 seconds, a new European record by 0.03 seconds and this was only the third time that an athlete had broken the ten second barrier in the 100 metres without winning the race.

In 1992, Christie became the third British athlete to win the Olympic 100 m, after Harold Abrahams and Allan Wells, winning the title ahead of Frankie Fredericks of Namibia at the Barcelona Olympic Games. In the absence of his great rival Lewis, Christie ran 9.96 s in the final, and at the age of 32 years 121 days became the oldest Olympic 100 m champion by four years and 38 days.

In 1993, he became the first man in history to hold the Olympic, World, European and Commonwealth titles in the 100m as he was victorious at the Stuttgart World Championships in his fastest ever time of 9.87. The time stood as the British record until 2023. His achievement saw him being voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year by the British public that year.

The following year, in 1994, he defended his Commonwealth title in Victoria in his second fastest ever 100 m time of 9.91.

Defending his Olympic title in 1996, Christie was disqualified in the final after two false starts. He said: &quot;The first one I knew I did, but on the second one I felt I reacted perfectly to the gun. I have never been disqualified from a race before in my life. What a place to do it.&quot; His reaction time was 0.086 seconds. Under IAAF rules, sprinters are not allowed to start from their blocks faster than 0.1 seconds.

Christie retired from representative international competition in 1997, although he continued to make appearances at invitation meetings.

===Doping allegations and ban===

==== Early allegations ====
Christie faced an International Olympic Committee disciplinary hearing at the 1988 Seoul Olympics because of an adverse drug test for the banned stimulant pseudoephedrine after he ran in the heats of the 200m. He escaped sanction after the committee voted by a margin of 11 to 10 and gave Christie &quot;the benefit of the doubt.&quot; Christie argued that he had taken it inadvertently when drinking some ginseng tea.

At the 1994 European championships staged in Helsinki, where British team captain Christie won his third European 100 m title, he was caught up in a doping controversy after Solomon Wariso, a 400 m runner making his international championship debut, tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine. Wariso revealed that he had used an over-the-counter pick-you-up called &quot;Up Your Gas&quot;, which Christie had bought at a Florida pharmacy.

In 1998, less than six months before his first positive drug test, Christie won a libel action against the journalist John McVicar. McVicar had insinuated in a satirical magazine that Christie&#x27;s remarkable rise from 156th in the world to triumph at an age when he should have been in decline could only have been achieved through performance-enhancing drugs. The jury found in Christie&#x27;s favour by a 10–2 majority. The judge ordered that McVicar should be bound by an injunction restraining him from accusing Christie of taking banned substances. The modest £40,000 damages awarded were outweighed by the legal costs that Christie incurred to bring the case. After the judgment, McVicar called Christie &quot;The Judy Garland of the 100 metres&quot;, referring to the emotion that Christie had displayed before the court.

==== Positive drugs test and ban from athletics ====
In February 1999, Christie competed in an indoor meet in Dortmund, Germany. A routine in competition drug test found the banned substance nandrolone. After a six-month delay, a disciplinary hearing was convened by the British Athletic Federation which found Christie to be not guilty. But the IAAF overruled and confirmed a two-year suspension. He was found to have more than 100 times threshold levels of the metabolites of nandrolone in his urine. Various explanations were offered to explain the result. &quot;You think that&#x27;s an awful lot,&quot; says Professor Ron Maughan one of the UK Athletics anti-doping panellists who worked on Christie&#x27;s case, &quot;but the amounts are so small, they would have absolutely no physiological effect, but they would trigger a doping test.&quot;. The IAAF rejected the explanations and gave Christie a two-years ban from athletics, despite UK Athletics feeling that there was reasonable doubt whether the drug had been taken deliberately, a decision which ignored the usual drug testing principle of &quot;strict liability&quot;.

Several alternative theories have been proposed that might explain Christie&#x27;s positive test. Nandrolone is a long-acting anabolic steroid, and is well-known in athlete circles to be detectable in blood and urine screenings for long periods; ranging from 6 to 18 months. Sceptics of Christie&#x27;s positive, and other Nandrolone sanctions in the late 1990s, have cited this detection window as a major deterrent to using the drug at any point during training or competition periods. Around this time pro-hormones like 19-norandrostenedione, Androstenedione, and 1-Testosterone, among others, abounded in the American supplement market, and were not yet codified as &#x27;anabolic agents&#x27; under the Federal Controlled Substances Act.

Christie has always denied any wrongdoing. &quot;If I took drugs there had to be a reason to take drugs. I had pretty much retired from the sport.&quot; Furthermore, he denied that his physique was gained through drug use and promoted an anti-steroid approach: &quot;It does not follow that all athletes who are big take drugs ... Only by testing all athletes will the sport be kept clean of drugs.&quot;

==== Fallout following positive drugs test ====
Following his positive drugs test and ban from athletics, Christie was banned for life from the British Olympic Association, who announced that Christie would not be accredited for any future Olympic Games, in accordance with their regulations.

==Retirement==
Following the two-year ban, Christie worked as a presenter on the BBC programmes &quot;Record Breakers&quot; and &quot;Garden Invaders&quot;, and also had a contract with BBC Sport. He has spent less time as a public figure and has devoted most of his time to managing his company. In 1990 he made his acting debut in the BBC programme &quot;Grange Hill&quot;. Later he appeared in another BBC programme &quot;Hustle&quot;. In 2010, Christie appeared on the UK ITV television channel&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot; show, subsequently becoming the sixth person to be eliminated, on 30 November 2010.

During the McVicar case, Christie raised another of his grievances with the media – insinuating comments about the figure-hugging running suits that Christie wore in his races. The term &quot;Linford&#x27;s lunchbox&quot; had been coined by &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper in reference to the noticeable bulge of Christie&#x27;s genitalia in his Lycra shorts. He said &quot;&quot;Linford&#x27;s lunchbox&quot; is one of my grievances with the media. I don&#x27;t like it ... Nobody ever goes on about Sally Gunnell&#x27;s breasts ... I think it is disgusting, I don&#x27;t like it at all.&quot; In court, the judge Mr Justice Popplewell, amused some by tactlessly asking Christie to explain the phrase, asking &quot;What is &#x27;Linford&#x27;s lunchbox?&#x27;&quot;
Christie&#x27;s anger at this unwanted attention led to his infamous &quot;newspaper print&quot; running suit, although he has deliberately drawn attention to his body on occasions: he has remarked that &quot;A lot of people have looked at my physique and two things can come into their mind – admiration and envy.&quot; He also appeared shirtless and flexing his muscles on the BBC youth series &quot;Reportage&quot; in 1988. In recent years, however, Christie appears to have come to terms with the &#x27;lunchbox&#x27; label, disclosing his preference for briefs rather than boxer shorts, and in 2002 becoming the &quot;face&quot; of Sloggi, the men&#x27;s underwear brand, posing for advertising wearing only underwear.

In the successful British bid for the 2012 Olympic Games, Christie was absent from the team, even though he has stated that he attempted to get involved. Christie has cited an ongoing feud between himself and former teammate Sebastian Coe, who led the bid committee, as a likely reason for the snub. Commenting on the argument, Christie&#x27;s teammate, Derek Redmond, said he was &quot;a well-balanced athlete; he has a chip on both shoulders.&quot;

However, in April 2006, it was announced that Christie would be a senior mentor for athletes on the national team, along with former athletes Steve Backley, Daley Thompson and Katharine Merry. This proved controversial, however, due to Christie&#x27;s 2 year drugs ban in February 1997. &quot;I don&#x27;t think he should be in that mentor role,&quot; said Paula Radcliffe, the former women&#x27;s marathon world record-holder. &quot;We have to make sure that the people in that mentor role have an integrity and strong sense of ethics and morals.&quot;

The BOA confirmed that their ban on Olympic accreditation for Christie remained in place. Christie claimed that he was invited by London Mayor Ken Livingstone to be one of the carriers of the 2008 Olympic Torch on its journey through London, although Livingstone denied that he had invited Christie to undertake that role. The IOC reacted angrily to any suggestion that &quot;an athlete who has an Olympic ban&quot; could have been invited to carry the Olympic torch.

In 2011, Christie was convicted of careless driving, after his vehicle crashed head-on into a taxi on 8 May 2010 due to driving on the wrong side of the A413 road in Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire. Four people, including a newly-wed couple, were hurt.

In November 2023, he appeared in &quot;The Masked Singer: I&#x27;m a Celebrity Special&quot; as Huntsman. He was voted off first.

A documentary film about his life, titled &quot;Linford&quot;, premiered on BBC One in July 2024.

==Achievements and legacy==
Reflecting upon his track career, he stated: &quot;I will have no complaints if people remember me as one of the best athletes in the world.&quot; He was the British record-holder for nearly 30 years at 100 m, with the 9.87 s he ran at the 1993 World Championships. He was the third Briton, after Harold Abrahams and Allan Wells, and the fifth European to win the 100 m at the Olympic Games, and the last to do so until 2021, when Italian Marcell Jacobs took the Olympic title in Tokyo in the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics. He remains the oldest male athlete to win the 100 metres at the Olympics at the age of 32.

As of 2019, Christie&#x27;s British record of 9.87 seconds in the 100 metres makes him the third fastest European in history; after Francis Obikwelu&#x27;s 9.86 s personal best which broke Christie&#x27;s European record, and the same time achieved by French sprinter Jimmy Vicaut. His 100 m personal best fares favourably in comparison with his contemporaries: Carl Lewis and Frankie Fredericks managed 9.86 s while Leroy Burrell ran 9.85 s. Christie broke the ten-second barrier nine times, and was the first European to break the ten-second barrier. In the 1988 100 metres Olympic final, he became the first man to break the ten-second barrier and not win the race. In the 1991 World Championships 100 m final, he became the first man to break the ten-second barrier and come fourth, running 9.92 seconds.

In the 4 × 100 m relay event Christie&#x27;s performance as anchor, alongside Colin Jackson, Tony Jarrett and John Regis, set a European record of 37.77 s at the 1993 World Championships. This was beaten six years later by a 37.73 s run by a British team, which included his protégé Darren Campbell. However, Christie&#x27;s team&#x27;s performance is still the second fastest 4 x 100 m performance by a European team and one of the best by a non-United States relay team.

Over 60 m, Christie set a European record of 6.47 s in 1995 which was beaten by fellow Briton Jason Gardener in 1999 with 6.46 s. Christie has the fourth fastest time over the distance for a European after Gardener, Ronald Pognon and the current European record holder Dwain Chambers.

Christie also holds 3 current 35–39 masters age group world records. On 23 September 1995, Christie set a M35 world record of 9.97 in the 100 m which no longer stands. On 25 June 1995 he set the current M35 world record in the 200 m in 20.11 seconds and on 3 January 1997 Christie set the current indoor record in the M35 60 m in a time of 6.51 seconds.

Christie broke the world indoor record over 200 m with 20.25 s at Liévin in 1995, and remains the seventh fastest sprinter on the all-time list.
He was appointed MBE in 1990 and OBE in 1998. In 1993, the West London Stadium, where he spent much time training, was renamed the Linford Christie Stadium in his honour. Christie&#x27;s claim that he started races on the &quot;B of the Bang&quot; inspired a large public sculpture of the same name. Erected as a celebration of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, it was officially unveiled by Christie in 2004. Owing to safety concerns, it was dismantled in 2009. In 2010, he was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame, and in 2009, he was inducted into the London Youth Games Hall of Fame.

===National titles===

Christie competed during the era of dual national championships, whereby the winner at the nominally open AAA Championships was often recognised as the national champion, but a separate UK only event, the UK Athletics Championships, was also held, crowning a UK Athletics champion. Between both events, Christie accumulated 19 outdoor championship golds. Eleven of these golds were in the AAA championships which were broadly recognised as the more prestigious of the national titles.

==Personal life==
Linford Christie has eight children. His niece Rachel Christie was crowned Miss England in 2009 though later relinquished the title following allegations of assault. His godson Omari Patrick is a professional footballer.

In 1993 Christie formed a sports management and promotions company, Nuff Respect, with sprint-hurdler Colin Jackson. One of their early products was a sports training and workout video, &quot;The S Plan: Get Fit with Christie and Jackson&quot;. Jackson was later to leave the enterprise, saying &quot;Linford has to be in control, he has to be number one, he has to be the leader.&quot;
