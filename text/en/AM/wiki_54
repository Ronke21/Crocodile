<text>Severe weather phenomena are weather conditions that are hazardous to human life and property.
Severe weather can occur under a variety of situations, but three characteristics are generally needed: a temperature or moisture boundary, moisture, and (in the event of severe, precipitation-based events) instability in the atmosphere.

<text>Carl Peter Henrik Dam (21 February 1895 – 17 April 1976) was a Danish biochemist and physiologist.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1943 for joint work with Edward Doisy in discovering vitamin K and its role in human physiology. Dam&#x27;s key experiment involved feeding a cholesterol-free diet to chickens. He initially replicated experiments reported by scientists at the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC). McFarlane, Graham and Richardson, working on the chick feed program at OAC, had used chloroform to remove all fat from chick chow. They noticed that chicks fed only fat-depleted chow developed hemorrhages and started bleeding from tag sites. Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared that—together with the cholesterol—a second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. The new vitamin received the letter K because the initial discoveries were reported in a German journal, in which it was designated as &quot;Koagulationsvitamin&quot;.

He received an undergraduate degree in chemistry from the &quot;Copenhagen Polytechnic Institute&quot; (now the Technical University of Denmark) in 1920, and was appointed as assistant instructor in chemistry at the School of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine. By 1923 he had attained the post of instructor in biochemistry at the University of Copenhagen&#x27;s Physiological Laboratory. He studied microchemistry at the University of Graz under Fritz Pregl in 1925, but returned to the University of Copenhagen, where he was appointed as an assistant professor at the Institute of Biochemistry in 1928, and assistant professor in 1929. During his time as professor at the University of Copenhagen he spent some time working abroad, and in 1934 submitted a thesis entitled &quot;Nogle Undersøgelser over Sterinernes Biologiske Betydning&quot; (Some investigations on the biological significance of the sterines) to the University of Copenhagen, and received the degree of PhD in biochemistry.

Between 1942 and 1945 Dam was a senior research associate at the University of Rochester; it was during this period that he was awarded the 1943 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. In 1951, he was one of seven Nobel Laureates who attended the first Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting.

<text>The &quot;Trafalgar&quot; class was a class of nuclear-powered fleet submarines (SSNs) in service with the Royal Navy, and the successor to the . Like the majority of Royal Navy nuclear submarines, all seven boats were constructed at Barrow-in-Furness shipyard, Cumbria. The class made up part of the Royal Navy&#x27;s nuclear-powered ‘hunter-killer’ submarine force. The &quot;Trafalgar&quot; class was replaced by the larger and more capable , of which five are commissioned.

The name &quot;Trafalgar&quot; refers to the Battle of Trafalgar fought between the Royal Navy and the combined fleets of France and Spain in 1805.

==Development==
The &quot;Trafalgar&quot; class were designed in the early 1970s during the Cold War as a refinement of the preceding &quot;Swiftsure&quot; class. Including , the &quot;Trafalgar&quot; class are the fifth class of nuclear-powered fleet submarines to enter service with the Royal Navy. The first of the class, HMS &quot;Trafalgar&quot;, was ordered on 7 April 1977 and completed in 1983. The last, HMS &quot;Triumph&quot;, was ordered on 3 January 1986 and completed in 1991. All seven boats of the class were built and completed by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering at the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard.

In 1982, &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; recorded: &quot;Estimated cost of fourth submarine £175 million including equipment and weapon system when fitted.&quot; In 1986, &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; recorded that the average cost for this class was £200 million at 1984–85 prices.

===Potential export===
In 1987, the Canadian White Paper on Defence recommended the purchase of 10 to 12 - or &quot;Trafalgar&quot;-class submarines under technology transfer, with the choice of the type of submarine due to be confirmed before summer 1988. The goal was to build up a three-ocean navy and to assert Canadian sovereignty over Arctic waters. The purchase was abandoned in April 1989 due to a growing budget deficit. 

===Operational service===
The submarines of the class have seen service in a wide range of locations, most notably firing Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles in anger at targets during conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. Three of the &quot;Trafalgar&quot;-class boats have been involved in such operations. In 2001 &quot;Trafalgar&quot; took part in Operation Veritas, the attack on Al-Qaeda and Taliban forces following the September 11 attacks in the United States, becoming the first Royal Navy submarine to launch Tomahawk cruise missiles against Afghanistan. During April 2003, HMS &quot;Turbulent&quot; returned home flying the Jolly Roger after having launched thirty Tomahawk cruise missiles during the invasion of Iraq. As part of the 2011 military intervention in Libya, HMS &quot;Triumph&quot; fired her Tomahawk cruise missiles on three occasions; first on 19 March, then again on 20 March, and finally on 24 March. Her primary targets were Libyan air-defence installations around the city of Sabha. &quot;Triumph&quot; returned to Devonport on 3 April 2011 flying a Jolly Roger adorned with six small Tomahawk axes to indicate the missiles fired by the submarine in the operation.

In 1993 &quot;Triumph&quot; sailed to Australia, covering a distance of whilst submerged and without any forward support. As of 2011, this still remained the longest solo deployment by any British nuclear submarine.

===Service problems===
In 1998, &quot;Trenchant&quot; experienced a steam leak, forcing the crew to shut down the nuclear reactor. In 2000 a leak in the PWR1 reactor primary cooling circuit was discovered on &quot;Tireless&quot;, forcing her to proceed to Gibraltar on diesel power. The fault was found to be due to thermal fatigue cracks, requiring the other &quot;Trafalgar&quot;-class boats, and some of the remaining &quot;Swiftsure&quot;-class boats, to be urgently inspected and if necessary modified.

In 2013 the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator reported that the reactor systems were suffering increasing technical problems due to ageing, requiring effective management. An example was that &quot;Tireless&quot; had had a small radioactive coolant leak for eight days in February 2013.

==Characteristics==

As a refinement of the preceding &quot;Swiftsure&quot; class, the design of the &quot;Trafalgar&quot; class bears some similarity, including its internal layout and the Rolls-Royce PWR1 Core 3. However some improvements over the &quot;Swiftsure&quot; class include its reduced acoustic signature, which is due to the hull being covered in anechoic tiles which are designed to absorb sound rather than reflect it, making the boats quieter and more difficult to detect with active sonar. A pumpjet propulsion system is also used from boat 2 onward, rather than a conventional propeller. The &quot;Trafalgar&quot; class are long, have a beam of , a draught of and a dived displacement of . Each boat has a complement of 130. Like all Royal Navy submarines, the &quot;Trafalgar&quot; class have strengthened fins and retractable hydroplanes, allowing them to surface through thick ice.

Four boats of the class — &quot;Torbay&quot;, &quot;Trenchant&quot;, &quot;Talent&quot; and &quot;Triumph&quot; — have been fitted with the Sonar 2076 system. Beginning in 2014, the last four boats of the class underwent a communications package upgrade.

The &quot;Trafalgar&quot; class is equipped with five torpedo tubes with accommodation for a mixture of up to 30 weapons:
* Tomahawk Block IV cruise missiles
* Spearfish heavyweight torpedoes

The Tomahawk missiles are capable of hitting a target to within a few metres, to a range of .

Ostensibly, the submarines use the same steering column as was used in the Wellington bombers of the Second World War.

==Boats of the class==
Initially, the last five boats of the &quot;Trafalgar&quot; class were to be replaced by the &#x27;Future Fleet Submarine&#x27; programme, however this was effectively cancelled in 2001. The are replacing the &quot;Trafalgar&quot; class.


===In fiction===
In June 2019, ITV commissioned a six-part thriller to be set aboard a fictional &quot;Trafalgar&quot;-class submarine, HMS &quot;Tenacity&quot;. However, production on the series was paused in 2020, before being dropped all together by November 2021.

<doc id="69918" wikidata="Q131206" url="?curid=69918" title="Buffalo Sabres">
<text>The Buffalo Sabres are a professional ice hockey team based in Buffalo, New York. The Sabres compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference. The team was established in 1970, along with the Vancouver Canucks, when the league expanded to 14 teams. The Sabres have played their home games at KeyBank Center since 1996, having previously played at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium since their inception. The Sabres are owned by Terry Pegula, who purchased the club in 2011 from Tom Golisano.

The team has twice advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, losing to the Philadelphia Flyers in 1975 and to the Dallas Stars in 1999. The Sabres, along with the Canucks, are the oldest active NHL franchises to have never won the Stanley Cup. The Sabres have the longest active playoff drought in the NHL and professional sports, at 13 seasons, which stands as an NHL record.

==History==

===Early years and the French Connection (1970–1981)===
The Sabres, along with the Vancouver Canucks, joined the NHL in the 1970–71 season. Their first owners were Seymour H. Knox III and Northrup Knox, scions of a family long prominent in Western New York and grandsons of the co-founders of the Woolworth&#x27;s variety store chain; along with Robert O. Swados, a Buffalo attorney. On the team&#x27;s inaugural board of directors were Robert E. Rich Jr., later the owner of the Buffalo Bisons minor league baseball team; and George W. Strawbridge Jr., an heir to the Campbell Soup Company fortune. Buffalo had a history of professional hockey; immediately prior to the Sabres&#x27; establishment, the Buffalo Bisons were a pillar of the American Hockey League (AHL), having existed since 1940 (and before that, another Bisons hockey team played from 1928 to 1936), winning the Calder Cup in their final season.

Wanting a name other than &quot;bison&quot; (a generic stock name used by Buffalo sports teams for decades), the Knoxes commissioned a name-the-team contest. With names like &quot;Mugwumps&quot;, &quot;Buzzing Bees&quot; and &quot;Flying Zeppelins&quot; being entered, the winning choice, &quot;Sabres&quot;, was chosen because Seymour Knox felt a sabre was a weapon carried by a leader, and could be effective on both offense and defense. The Knoxes tried twice before to get an NHL team, first when the NHL expanded in 1967, and again when they attempted to purchase the Oakland Seals with the intent of moving them to Buffalo. Their first attempt was thwarted when Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney persuaded his horse racing friends James and Bruce Norris to select Pittsburgh over Buffalo, while the second attempt was due to the NHL not wanting an expansion market to give up on a team so soon, nor isolate the Los Angeles Kings (the only NHL team other than the Seals west of St. Louis at the time) from the rest of the NHL entirely. At the time of their creation, the Sabres exercised their option to create their own AHL farm team, the Cincinnati Swords. Former Toronto Maple Leafs general manager and head coach Punch Imlach was hired in the same capacity with the Sabres.

The year the Sabres debuted (1970) was an important year for major league sports in Buffalo. In addition to the Sabres&#x27; debut, the Buffalo Bills officially joined the National Football League, and the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Buffalo Braves also began to play, sharing Memorial Auditorium with the Sabres. The city of Buffalo went from having no teams in the established major professional sports leagues to three in one off-season, a situation that proved to be unsustainable. Between the Braves and the Sabres, the Sabres would prove to be by far the more successful of the two; Paul Snyder, the &quot;nouveau riche&quot; Braves owner, publicly feuded with the old money Knoxes and the local college basketball scene, eventually losing those feuds and being forced to sell his team in 1976. Subsequent owners of the Braves, in a series of convoluted transactions tied to the ABA–NBA merger, moved the team out of Buffalo.

When the Sabres debuted as an expansion team, they took the ice to Aram Khachaturian&#x27;s Armenian war dance, &quot;Sabre Dance&quot;. The music has been associated with the team as an unofficial anthem ever since. It is often played between periods and after goals.

The consensus was that the first pick in the 1970 NHL amateur draft would be junior phenomenon Gilbert Perreault. Either the Sabres or the Canucks would get the first pick, to be determined with the spin of a wheel of fortune. Perreault was available to the Sabres and Canucks as this was the first year the Montreal Canadiens did not have a priority right to draft Quebec-born junior players.

The Canucks were allocated numbers 1–10 on the wheel, while the Sabres had 11–20. When league president Clarence Campbell spun the wheel, he initially thought the pointer landed on one. While Campbell was congratulating the Vancouver delegation, Imlach asked Campbell to check again. As it turned out, the pointer was on 11, effectively handing Perreault to the Sabres. Perreault scored 38 goals in his rookie season of 1970–71, at the time a record for most goals scored by a NHL rookie, and he received the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s rookie of the year. Despite Perreault&#x27;s play, the Sabres finished well out of playoff contention.
In the team&#x27;s second season, 1971–72, rookie Rick Martin, drafted fifth overall by Buffalo in 1971, and Rene Robert, acquired in a late-season trade from the Pittsburgh Penguins, joined Perreault and would become one of the league&#x27;s top forward lines in the 1970s. Martin broke Perreault&#x27;s record at once with 44 rookie goals. They were nicknamed &quot;The French Connection&quot; after the movie of the same name and in homage to their French-Canadian roots. The Sabres made the playoffs for the first time in 1972–73, just the team&#x27;s third year in the league, but lost in the quarterfinals in six games to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens.

After a subpar year in 1974 that saw them miss the playoffs (as well as aging defenseman Tim Horton&#x27;s death in a DUI-induced car accident), the Sabres tied for the best record in the NHL in the 1974–75 regular season. Buffalo advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in team history to play against the rough Philadelphia Flyers (who had been recently nicknamed the &quot;Broad Street Bullies&quot;), a series which included the legendary Fog Game (Game 3 of the series). Due to unusual heat in Buffalo in May 1975 and the lack of air conditioning in the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, parts of the game were played in heavy fog that made players, officials, and the puck invisible to many spectators. During a face-off and through the fog, Sabres center Jim Lorentz spotted a bat flying across the rink, swung at it with his stick, killing it. It was the only time that any player killed an animal during an NHL game. The Sabres won that game thanks to Rene Robert&#x27;s goal in overtime. However, Philadelphia would wind up taking the Stanley Cup in six games, winning the series 4–2.

The French Connection, joined by 50–goal scorer Danny Gare, continued to score prolifically for the Sabres in 1975–76, but the team lost in the quarterfinals to the New York Islanders. The Sabres had success through the late 1970s behind Gare and the French Connection (Perreault, Martin and Robert), but they were unable to return to the Finals despite a Wales Conference championship in 1980 and being the first team to beat the Soviet Olympic Team when they toured the United States. The French Connection era ended with Robert&#x27;s trade to the Colorado Rockies in 1979 and Martin&#x27;s trade to the Los Angeles Kings in 1981, by which time Martin&#x27;s career was essentially finished as the result of a devastating knee injury in 1980. All three players have had their sweater numbers (11, 7 and 14, respectively) retired and a statue erected in their honor at KeyBank Center in 2012.

===Adams/Northeast Division rivalries (1981–1996)===

In 1981–82, the NHL realigned its conferences and adopted an intra-divisional playoff format for the first two rounds. It was the beginning of an era in which the Sabres would finish in the middle of the Adams Division standings with regularity, and then face the near-certainty of having to get past either the Boston Bruins or Canadiens to make it to the conference finals. Aside from first-round victories over Montreal in 1982–83 and Boston in 1992–93, the era saw the Sabres lose to division rivals Boston, the Quebec Nordiques and Montreal in the Adams Division semifinals (first round) a combined eight times, and miss the playoffs altogether in 1985–86 and 1986–87—only third and fourth times out of the playoffs in franchise history. Perrault reached the 500-goal mark in the 1985–86 season and retired after playing 20 games in 1986–87, 17 years after joining the Sabres as their first draft pick.

The Sabres drafted Pierre Turgeon with the first pick in the 1987 NHL entry draft, and he quickly made an impact with the team. During his rookie season in 1987–88, he helped the Sabres reach the playoffs for the first time in three years. He was joined in 1989 by Alexander Mogilny, who with the help of Sabres officials became the first Soviet player to defect to the NHL, and cleared the way for all other Russian players to follow. In the 1989–90 season, the Sabres would improve to finish with 98 points—third-best in the NHL—but the playoff futility continued with a first-round loss to Montreal. The Sabres traded Turgeon to the New York Islanders in 1991 as part of a blockbuster seven-player trade that brought Pat LaFontaine to Buffalo.

In 1992–93, goaltender Dominik Hasek joined the team in a trade from the Chicago Blackhawks. In the 1993 playoffs, the Sabres upset the Bruins in a four-game sweep in the Adams Division semifinals, their first playoff series victory in ten years. Brad May&#x27;s series-winning goal in overtime of Game 4 in Buffalo was made famous by Rick Jeanneret&#x27;s &quot;May Day!&quot; call. However, the eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens swept the Sabres in the division final, with the Sabres losing all four games by a 4–3 score (the last three games in overtime).

With the NHL adopting a conference playoff format for the 1993–94 season, the Sabres faced the New Jersey Devils in the Eastern Conference playoffs&#x27; first round. Despite Hasek winning a 1–0 (quadruple overtime) goaltending duel with the Devils&#x27; Martin Brodeur in Game 6—the Sabres&#x27; longest game ever, which went into quadruple overtime—Buffalo would lose the series in seven games. Another first-round playoff loss to the Philadelphia Flyers in the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season was followed by a fifth-place finish in the Northeast Division in 1995–96, as the team missed the playoffs for the first time in nine years. It was the first season under head coach Ted Nolan and the last for the Sabres at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. Nolan brought an exciting brand of hockey to Buffalo. During his coaching tenure, Buffalo was referred to as the &quot;hardest-working team in hockey&quot;. This season also featured the debut of &quot;walk-on&quot; veteran Randy Burridge, who earned a spot on the roster after he attended training camp on a try-out basis. He scored 25 goals that season and was second in team scoring to Pat LaFontaine. Burridge also earned the Tim Horton Award for being the unsung hero and was voted team Most Valuable Player.

The final game in Memorial Auditorium was played on April 14, 1996, a 4–1 victory over the Hartford Whalers. Sabres principal owner Seymour Knox died a month later, on May 22, 1996.

===The black and red era (1996–2006)===
Ted Nolan and the Sabres rebounded in 1996–97, their first at Marine Midland Arena, by winning their first division title in 16 years, with Nolan winning the Jack Adams Award as the NHL&#x27;s top coach, Dominik Hasek winning both the Hart and Vezina Trophies (the first goaltender to do so since Montreal&#x27;s Jacques Plante in 1962), Michael Peca taking home the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the best defensive forward in the NHL and general manager John Muckler honored as Executive of the Year.

However, the regular season success was overshadowed by what had taken place during the playoffs. Tensions between Nolan and Hasek had been high for most of the season. After being scored upon in Game 3 of the first round against the Ottawa Senators, Hasek left the game, forcing backup Steve Shields to step in. Hasek claimed he felt his knee pop, and the team doctor pronounced him day-to-day. &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; columnist Jim Kelley wrote a column that night for the next day&#x27;s newspaper that detailed the day&#x27;s events, which irked Hasek. After the Senators won Game 5, Hasek came out of the Sabres&#x27; training room and attacked Kelley, tearing his shirt. Despite the fact Hasek issued an apology, things went downhill after the incident. Shields starred as the Sabres rallied to win the series against Ottawa. But before the next series against the Philadelphia Flyers, the NHL announced Hasek had been suspended for three games, with the Sabres informing the NHL Hasek was healthy (Hasek most likely would not have been suspended had he not been cleared to play). Set to return in Game 4 with the Sabres down by three games to none, Hasek told the Sabres&#x27; coaching staff he felt a twinge in his knee and left the ice after the pre-game skate. Shields turned in another season-saving performance as Buffalo staved off elimination with a win in overtime. Again before Game 5, Hasek declared himself unfit to play and Buffalo lost 6–3 and the series.

Team president Larry Quinn fired general manager John Muckler, who had a noted feud with Nolan. Hasek, who supported Muckler, openly told reporters at the NHL Awards Ceremony he did not respect Nolan, placing new general manager Darcy Regier in a tough position. He offered Nolan just a one-year contract for a reported $500,000. Nolan refused on the grounds his previous contract was for two years. Regier then pulled the contract off the table and did not offer another one, ending Nolan&#x27;s tenure as Sabres coach. Nolan was offered several jobs from the Tampa Bay Lightning and New York Islanders, which he turned down, and was out of the NHL until June 2006 when he was named coach of the Islanders. Former Sabres captain Lindy Ruff was hired as head coach on July 21, 1997, agreeing to a three-year contract. The Sabres organization, after having their most successful season in nearly two decades, had fired both the reigning NHL Executive of the Year (Muckler) and Coach of the Year (Nolan).

====New owners and return to the Finals====
During the 1997–98 season, the Sabres, which had lost $32 million over the previous three seasons and nearly missed payroll in December 1997, were sold by Northrop Knox to John Rigas, owner of Adelphia Communications. Shortly thereafter, Quinn was dismissed and replaced by John Rigas&#x27; son, Timothy Rigas. Behind Hasek, left-winger Miroslav Satan (who led the team in scoring), right-winger Donald Audette, center Michael Peca and several role-playing journeymen including Matthew Barnaby, the Sabres reached the conference finals that season, but lost to the Washington Capitals in six games.
In 1998–99, Miroslav Satan scored 40 goals. The Sabres would add centers Stu Barnes from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Joe Juneau from the Capitals. Michal Grosek had the best season of his career, and the team finally returned to the Stanley Cup Finals, this time against the Presidents&#x27; Trophy winner, the Dallas Stars. In Game 6, Stars winger Brett Hull&#x27;s triple-overtime goal ended the series, and the Stars were awarded the Cup. In 1999, it was illegal to score a goal if an offensive player&#x27;s skate entered the crease before the puck did. However, NHL officials maintained that Hull&#x27;s two shots in the goal mouth constituted a single possession of the puck since the puck deflected off Hasek. The rule was changed for the following season, allowing players to be inside the goaltender&#x27;s crease as long as they do not interfere with the goaltender.

The next year was a disappointing season. The team struggled in the regular season, due to injuries to Hasek as well as other tired and discouraged players. Doug Gilmour was acquired from the Chicago Blackhawks at the trade deadline and sparked the Sabres to a playoff berth. However, Gilmour was stricken by stomach flu during the postseason, and even Hasek&#x27;s return could not prevent a first-round playoff series loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. Like the previous season, there would be an officiating controversy. In Game 2, Flyers left wing John LeClair put the puck in the net through a hole in the mesh. While replays appeared to show the puck entering through the &quot;side&quot; of the net, the goal was allowed to stand. The Flyers would win the game 2–1 and go on to win the series four games to one.

Captain Michael Peca sat out 2000–01 due to a contract dispute, and was later traded to the New York Islanders in June 2001 in exchange for Tim Connolly and Taylor Pyatt. Even so, the Sabres still defeated Philadelphia in six games in the first round of the playoffs (with a resounding 8–0 victory in the series-winning game). In the second round, they faced the underdog Pittsburgh Penguins, led by rejuvenated superstar Mario Lemieux and captain Jaromir Jagr, who had won his fifth Art Ross Trophy that season, losing on a seventh-game overtime goal scored by defenseman Darius Kasparaitis. After lengthy and failed negotiations with their star goaltender, the Sabres traded Hasek to the Detroit Red Wings in the summer of 2001, bringing a five-year era of playoff success to a close. Without Hasek and Peca, the Sabres missed the 2002 playoffs.

====Ownership turmoil and lockout====
In May 2002, John Rigas and his sons were indicted for bank, wire and securities fraud for embezzling more than $2 billion from Adelphia. Rigas was later convicted and served eight years of a 15-year sentence before his release in 2016. The NHL took control of the team, though the Rigas family remained owners on paper. For a while, there were no interested buyers. After the two-year period of uncertainty, including rumors of relocating to another city or even straight out folding, the team was sold to a consortium led by Rochester, New York, billionaire and former New York gubernatorial candidate Tom Golisano and former Sabres president Larry Quinn, whose bid included no government funding. Golisano was introduced as team owner on March 19, 2003.

With the 2002–03 season having started under NHL control, general manager Darcy Regier could make only minimal moves. However, with the consultations of impending new ownership, the team began their rebuilding process around the March 2003 trade deadline by clearing out veteran players. The first to go was winger Rob Ray, who was sent to the Ottawa Senators. The team then sent center and team captain Stu Barnes to the Dallas Stars in exchange for young winger Michael Ryan and a draft pick.

A third deal sent center Chris Gratton to the Phoenix Coyotes with a draft pick for Daniel Briere and a draft pick, adding a player who would play a key role in the Sabres&#x27; resurgence in later years. The 2003–04 season saw the team emerge from its financial struggles and, though the Sabres narrowly missed the playoffs, the development of prominent young players. Although the 2004–05 NHL season was canceled due to a labor dispute, the league and the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) were able to agree on a new collective bargaining agreement in the summer of 2005, thus enabling NHL hockey to return for the 2005–06 season.
On January 19, 2005, the Sabres lost their main cable television broadcaster, as the Empire Sports Network (which had been on the air since 1991) ceased operations in a cost-cutting move during the Adelphia scandal and reorganization. (Like the Sabres, Empire had been owned by Adelphia prior to the NHL&#x27;s seizure of the franchise.) Adelphia sold their rights to Sabres telecasts and for the 2005–06 campaign Madison Square Garden Network (MSG), a New York City-based channel which broadcasts New York Rangers, New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils games, took over the rights to broadcast Sabres games to television viewers in western New York, with the Sabres controlling all aspects of the broadcast. The agreement was later extended through 2017, then again through 2027.

In 2005–06, the Sabres took off, finishing with their best record in over 20 years and clinching their first playoff berth since the 2000–01 season. The team finished the regular season with 52 wins, surpassing the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise history. They also finished with 110 points, their first 100-point season in 23 years and tied the 1979–80 club for the second-best point total in franchise history. The Sabres tied the Ottawa Senators and Carolina Hurricanes for the most wins in the Eastern Conference. They finished with the fifth-best record in the NHL, behind Detroit, Ottawa, Dallas and Carolina.

Buffalo defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round of the 2006 playoffs in six games and top-seeded Ottawa in five games. The Sabres advanced to play Carolina in their first conference finals since 1999. However, injuries began to mount. They were forced to play without four of their top defensemen (Teppo Numminen, Dmitri Kalinin, Jay McKee and Henrik Tallinder) and their top powerplay scorer (Tim Connolly) for much of the series. Despite this, the Sabres forced the series to seven games before falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champions Carolina. The Sabres&#x27; impressive season was recognized on June 22, 2006, at the NHL Awards Ceremony when Lindy Ruff edged Hurricanes coach Peter Laviolette to win the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year in the closest vote in the award&#x27;s history. Ruff was the second Sabres coach to win the award.

===Return to blue and gold (2006–2010)===

The Sabres started the 2006–07 season 10–0, setting a new franchise record for consecutive wins to start a season, and becoming just the second team in NHL history (after the 1993–94 Toronto Maple Leafs) to open a season with a ten-game winning streak. They also set a new NHL record for consecutive road wins to start a season (eight), which was extended to ten games (tying the team record for consecutive road wins) with a 7–4 win over the Carolina Hurricanes on November 13, 2006. The team reached the 50-win plateau for the second time in franchise history. The Sabres won the presidents&#x27; Trophy for the first time in franchise history, giving them the home-ice advantage for their entire run in the 2007 playoffs. They also tied the 1974–75 team&#x27;s franchise record for points in a season. The team defeated the New York Islanders and the New York Rangers to reach their second consecutive conference finals. However, on May 19, they were eliminated by the Ottawa Senators after five games.

In the April 9, 2007, issue of &quot;ESPN the Magazine&quot;, the team ranked first of 122 major professional sports franchises in North America. The Sabres were cited for their player accessibility, low ticket prices and exciting brand of hockey.

====Post-Briere–Drury era====
On July 1, 2007, the Sabres lost both co-captains, with Daniel Briere going to the Philadelphia Flyers and Chris Drury going to the New York Rangers as free agents. The team also nearly lost Thomas Vanek to the Edmonton Oilers, which offered him a seven-year, $50 million offer sheet, but the Sabres matched the offer on July 6. After these events, the team changed its policy of not negotiating contracts during the regular season. Long-time Sabres broadcast color commentator Jim Lorentz announced his retirement during the preseason. &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;&#x27;s Harry Neale took over the position in October 2007.
During the 2007–08 season, the Sabres hosted a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins on January 1, 2008, which was played outdoors at Ralph Wilson Stadium, home of the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). The 2008 Winter Classic, known colloquially as the &quot;Ice Bowl&quot; due to it taking place at the same time as college football&#x27;s bowl games. The Sabres lost 2–1 in a shootout. The Sabres failed to qualify for the 2008 playoffs and became only the third team in NHL history to go from finishing first overall in the regular season standings to finishing out of the playoffs the following year.

On June 10, the Sabres officially announced their new AHL affiliate, beginning in the 2008–09 season, would be the Portland Pirates from Portland, Maine. This ended their 29-year affiliation with the Rochester Americans. They signed with the Pirates for two seasons, with a parent club option for a third. The Sabres entered the 2008 free agency period quietly, but on July 1, signed goaltender Patrick Lalime to a two-year contract. Three days later, the Sabres acquired Craig Rivet from the San Jose Sharks in exchange for a second-round draft pick in each of the next two drafts. The Sabres also extended the contracts of three players: Paul Gaustad (four years), Ryan Miller (five years) and Jason Pominville (five years). Miller was slated to become an unrestricted free agent following the upcoming season while Pominville was set to become a restricted free agent.

On October 8, the Sabres named defenseman Craig Rivet team captain, the first single full-time captain since Stu Barnes&#x27; term from 2001 to 2003. The team was also active at the trade deadline. First, they signed Tim Connolly to a two-year, $4.2 million extension, then acquired Mikael Tellqvist from the Phoenix Coyotes for a fourth-round pick in the 2010 draft. Dominic Moore came from the Toronto Maple Leafs for a second-round pick in the 2009 draft, then Buffalo received a second-round pick in the 2009 draft from the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Ales Kotalik. On April 9, the Buffalo Sabres were eliminated from the playoffs.
General manager Darcy Regier announced on the first day of free agency for the following season the Sabres had signed unrestricted free agent defenseman Steve Montador to a two-year contract. They also signed free agent defenseman Joe DiPenta to a one-year contract on July 11, and extended contracts with three other players: Andrej Sekera to a multi-year deal, Clarke MacArthur to a one-year contract, and Mike Grier to a one-year contract. Grier, having played two seasons with the Sabres, returned after playing the last three with the San Jose Sharks.

After only playing two games with Buffalo that season, Daniel Paille was traded to the Boston Bruins on October 20, 2009, in exchange for a third-round and a conditional fourth-round draft selection. Paille&#x27;s move to Boston marked the first ever trade of a player under contract between the two division rivals in their common 39 years in the NHL. On January 1, the Sabres became the first team to win consecutive games when trailing by three or more goals since the Dallas Stars did it in 2005–06; Buffalo defeated the Atlanta Thrashers 4–3 in overtime. It was Buffalo&#x27;s second straight win in a game it trailed 3–0, following a 4–3 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins. On March 3, the day of the trade deadline, the Sabres made two deals. The first was with the Columbus Blue Jackets, which sent them Raffi Torres in exchange for Nathan Paetsch and a second-round draft pick. The Sabres&#x27; second and final deal sent Clarke MacArthur to the Atlanta Thrashers for third- and fourth-round draft picks. On March 27, the Sabres clinched their first playoff berth since 2006–07 with a 7–1 rout of the Tampa Bay Lightning. On April 6, the Sabres clinched the Northeast Division title by defeating the New York Rangers by a score of 5–2. On April 26, the third-seed Sabres were eliminated from the Stanley Cup playoffs by the sixth-seeded Boston Bruins in six games.

The 2010–11 roster did not have many significant changes; one of the most notable was the team&#x27;s decision to waive center Tim Kennedy, a Buffalo native, to avoid paying the award he won in arbitration. Defensemen Henrik Tallinder and Toni Lydman were allowed to leave as free agents, while the team signed veterans Jordan Leopold and Shaone Morrisonn to replace them. Additionally, center Rob Niedermayer was added as a Stanley Cup-winning, veteran presence.

===The Pegula era (2010–present)===

On November 30, 2010, Ken Campbell of &quot;The Hockey News&quot; reported a story that billionaire Terry Pegula had signed a letter of intent to purchase the Sabres for US$150 million. Pegula was the founder, president and CEO of East Resources, one of the largest privately held companies in the United States before he sold the company. After the report was released, Sabres managing partner Larry Quinn claimed it was &quot;untrue&quot; but refused further comment. The $150 million was later determined to be an undervalued amount, as &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine had valued the team at just under $170 million in 2010. In December, Pegula officially expressed interest in buying the Sabres for $170 million and submitted a letter of intent to the NHL. In January, Golisano reportedly issued a counteroffer with an asking price of US$175 million. Pegula and Golisano reached an agreement to sell the team on January 29, 2011, with Pegula purchasing the team for $189 million ($175 million with $14 million in debt included) with the Sabres and Golisano officially making an announcement in a press conference on February 3, 2011. NHL owners approved the sale on February 18.

In the conference, it was stated that an unnamed bidder submitted a much higher bid than Pegula&#x27;s, but made the bid contingent upon moving the team. The description is consistent with that of Jim Balsillie, who has made public his efforts to move a team to Hamilton, Ontario, a move the Sabres have actively opposed. Terry Pegula named former Pittsburgh Penguins executive Ted Black to be team president. Pegula was introduced as the Sabres&#x27; owner in a public ceremony at HSBC Arena on February 23, accompanied by what would be the final appearance of all three members of The French Connection before Rick Martin&#x27;s death three weeks later. Around the 2010–11 trade deadline, the team attempted to trade Craig Rivet, but was unsuccessful. After initially clearing waivers, Rivet entered re-entry waivers and was claimed by the Columbus Blue Jackets. Late on February 27, the team acquired Brad Boyes from the St. Louis Blues in exchange for a second-round draft pick. This was the Sabres&#x27; sole trade of the deadline. After Pegula&#x27;s official takeover of the team, the Sabres finished the regular season 16–4–4, never losing two consecutive games in that span, and landed the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference. Pegula&#x27;s approach was credited by players, fans and the public with bringing new energy to the team, sparking a run to the playoffs that seemed improbable only months earlier. On April 8, the Sabres clinched a playoff berth for the second consecutive season, defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 4–3 in overtime. The Sabres clinched the seventh seed and faced Philadelphia in the first round. The Sabres had a three games to two lead but lost the series in seven games.

====Playoff drought====
The Sabres began the 2011–12 season as part of the 2011 NHL Premiere series for the first time, playing games in Finland and Germany. The team was particularly well-received during a game against Adler Mannheim in Mannheim, the hometown of Sabres forward Jochen Hecht; a contingent of 65 Adler fans traveled from Germany to Buffalo in February 2012 to witness a Sabres game against the Boston Bruins. Prior to the first game, Lindy Ruff named Jason Pominville the Sabres&#x27; 13th full-time captain in team history. The Sabres began the season relatively strong but collapsed after a Boston Bruins game in which Bruins forward Milan Lucic hit and injured goaltender Ryan Miller; the subsequent months saw the Sabres collapse to last place in the Eastern Conference. Despite a two-month rally that began in February along with the emergence of rookie forward Marcus Foligno, the Sabres lost the last two games of the regular season and fell three points short of a playoff spot.
The 2012–13 NHL lockout eliminated the first part of the 2012–13 season, which ultimately began with a scheduled 48 games. After a 6–10–1 start to the season, the contract of long-time head coach Lindy Ruff was terminated by general manager Darcy Regier on February 20, 2013, ending 16 seasons as head coach. Ruff was replaced by Ron Rolston first on an interim basis, then permanently after the season ended. Due to the lockout-shortened season, the trade deadline was moved to April 3, 2013. In the days leading up to it, the Sabres were active in trades. On March 15, the Sabres&#x27; first trade sent T. J. Brennan to the Florida Panthers in exchange for a fifth-round pick (originally owned by the Los Angeles Kings) in the 2013 draft. On March 30, the Sabres traded Jordan Leopold to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for a second-round pick and a conditional fifth-round pick in the 2013 draft. On April 1, the Sabres traded Robyn Regehr to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for two-second round draft choices (one in 2014 and the other in 2015). The final trade came on the day of the trade deadline, April 3, where the Sabres sent Jason Pominville to the Minnesota Wild for Johan Larsson and Matt Hackett. At the time of the official announcement, it was not clear if there were other parts of the deal as the trade was still pending NHL approval. It was later revealed that draft picks were also involved in the deal: the Wild would receive a fourth-round pick in the 2014 draft, and the Sabres would receive a first-round pick in the 2013 draft and a second-round pick in the 2014 draft.

The following season, on November 13, 2013, the team dismissed general manager Darcy Regier and head coach Ron Rolston. Former Sabres head coach Ted Nolan was named interim head coach for the remainder of the season (he later signed a three-year contract extension) and Pat LaFontaine was named president of hockey operations. On January 9, 2014, Tim Murray was named general manager. On February 28, 2014, Murray made his first major trade, sending star goaltender Ryan Miller and Captain Steve Ott to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for goaltender Jaroslav Halak, forwards Chris Stewart and William Carrier and two draft picks. After just over three months as president of hockey operations, Pat LaFontaine resigned from the Sabres to return to his previous position with the NHL on March 1, 2014. Among highlights in the otherwise bad 2013–14 season included the &quot;butt goal&quot; in which a severely short-staffed Sabres won their December 23 contest against the Phoenix Coyotes when Coyotes goaltender Mike Smith backed into his own goal with the puck lodged in his pants, and the lone NHL appearance of former Lancaster High School goaltender Ryan Vinz, who was working as a videographer in the Sabres organization, to suit up as a backup goaltender in the wake of the Ryan Miller trade. The Sabres finished the 2013–14 season last in the NHL and again missed the playoffs.
Despite winning two more games than the previous season, the 2014–15 season was much like the previous one, with the team sitting near the bottom of the standings the entire season, and finishing last in the NHL. On March 26, 2015, during a 4–3 overtime loss to the Arizona Coyotes, spectators at the game, ostensibly fans of the Sabres, cheered after a game-winning goal by Coyotes center Sam Gagner. Said fans were more eager to see the team lose (the Sabres and Coyotes were 29th and 30th in the standings at the time) in the hopes that it would ensure the team would deliberately lose to finish in last place and guarantee a top-two pick in the 2015 NHL entry draft, which included two extremely highly touted prospects, Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel. These spectators&#x27; &quot;embrace the tank&quot; philosophy led to criticism from the media and Sabres players for how the fans reacted. However, some praised the fans for how they reacted, saying that they &quot;did the right thing&quot;. The Sabres clinched last place (and therefore a top-two pick) with a loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets on April 10 (this was later confirmed to be a number-two pick after the team, for the second year in a row, lost the draft lottery); the team used the pick to select Eichel. Murray fired Nolan at the end of the season, citing a lack of chemistry and lukewarm relations between them. On May 28, 2015, Dan Bylsma was hired as the 17th head coach in franchise history.

The hiring of Bylsma, the drafting of Eichel and 2014 second overall pick Sam Reinhart, the acquisition of star centerman Ryan O&#x27;Reilly in the off-season, and the rising performance of youngsters Zemgus Girgensons, Jake McCabe and Rasmus Ristolainen resulted in an improved season in 2015–16. Even though the Sabres again missed the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season, the team managed to finish just under .500 in points percentage while fans and critics have praised these rebuilding efforts by Sabres general manager Tim Murray.

In mid-2016, the team announced that its television broadcasts would be spun off to their own regional sports network, MSG Western New York. The new network continues to operate under the MSG banner but under Pegula Sports and Entertainment control and features additional programs centered around the Sabres and the Buffalo Bills, which the Pegulas purchased separately in 2014. The team failed to make significant progress, and in fact slightly regressed, in 2016–17, missing the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season, leading to the firings of both head coach Dan Bylsma and general manager Tim Murray on April 20, 2017.
During the 2017 off-season, the Sabres hired two of their former players as head coach and general manager: Jason Botterill as general manager and Phil Housley as head coach. Among the more notable roster changes for this season was the return of former scoring leader Jason Pominville to the team in a trade that brought him and defenseman Marco Scandella to Buffalo in exchange for sending forwards Tyler Ennis and Marcus Foligno to the Minnesota Wild.

On January 1, 2018, the Sabres participated in the 2018 Winter Classic, losing 3–2 in overtime to the New York Rangers.

In the 2017–18 season, Buffalo finished in last place in the NHL for the third time in five seasons and won the draft lottery for the 2018 NHL entry draft for the first time since 1987, using the pick to select Rasmus Dahlin from Frölunda HC of the Swedish Hockey League.

On November 27, 2018, the Sabres became the first team in NHL history to lead the league in points after the first 25 games of the season after finishing last in the league the previous season. The team won 10 games in a row for the first time since the 2006–07 season and tied the franchise record. Jeff Skinner became the seventh player in franchise history to score 20 or more goals in less than 27 games, and only the second player to score 20 goals before December. The team then collapsed and missed the playoffs, leading to Housley&#x27;s firing at the end of the season.

On March 21, 2019, it was announced that the Sabres would play the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 2019 NHL Global Series at Ericsson Globe in Stockholm, Sweden. Ralph Krueger was named the Sabres head coach in May 2019.

On June 16, 2020, Botterill was fired as general manager of the Sabres and replaced by Kevyn Adams.

On March 17, 2021, in the midst on a twelve-game losing streak, head coach Ralph Krueger was fired. Don Granato was named interim head coach. After continuing to lose games, on March 29, 2021, the Sabres tied the Pittsburgh Penguins&#x27; all-time NHL losing streak of 18 games from the 2003–04 season after blowing a 3–0 lead in the third period against the Philadelphia Flyers and subsequently losing in overtime; it is the longest losing streak since the shootout was introduced. Granato was named the permanent head coach at the end of the season.

In the 2022–23 season, the Sabres would once again miss the playoffs for the 12th consecutive year, an NHL record.

On April 16, 2024, one day after playing the final game of the 2023–24 season, head coach Granato was fired. One week later, on April 22, former coach Lindy Ruff was named as the new head coach, returning for a second tenure.

==Team information==

===Logo and uniforms===
The Sabres have had, for the most part, used a primary logo featuring a bison atop two crossed sabres in a blue circle with gold trim. This logo was first used from 1970 to 1996 and was restored in 2020 after the Sabres 50th anniversary season was complete.

Throughout their 26-year tenure at the Buffalo Auditorium, the Sabres have worn white uniforms with a blue and gold shoulder yoke and alternating gold, white and blue stripes. On the road they wore blue uniforms with gold stripes. In 1978 the primary logo was added on the shoulders.

Upon moving to what is now KeyBank Center (formerly Marine Midland and HSBC Arena, later First Niagara Center) in 1996, the Sabres changed their logo and colors. Red, black and silver replaced blue and gold while the primary &quot;bison head&quot; logo was unveiled as the primary logo. Black road (later home) and white home (later road) uniforms were also released featuring a bull&#x27;s head silhouette design in front and the &quot;Sabre B&quot; alternate logo on the shoulders.

The first third jersey of the Buffalo Sabres was created in 2000. The primary color was Sabre red, with black and silver stripes on the sleeves. It also featured the word &quot;Buffalo&quot; written on a black stripe outlined by silver near the waist. The logo was a black circle with two sabres crossing each other (a nod to the original logo).

On October 7, 2001, the Sabres wore a modified version of their white jerseys in a road game against the New York Rangers. The uniform replaced the &quot;bison head&quot; with the &quot;NEW YORK&quot; diagonal wordmark as a tribute to the state of New York in the wake of the September 11 attacks.

On September 16, 2006, the Sabres unveiled new home and away jerseys featuring midnight blue, maize (gold), silver and white colors. Front chest numbers were also added. The new logo, a stylized bison, was widely reviled, drawing unfavorable comparisons to a banana slug (hence the nickname &quot;Buffaslug&quot;). Despite the criticism, five of the top ten player jerseys sold in the first two months of the 2006–07 season were Sabres &quot;slug&quot; designs. Nevertheless, the Sabres brought back the classic blue jerseys as a third jersey, but continued to pair the look with the navy helmet and pants. When the Reebok Edge template was unveiled in 2007, the Sabres kept their &quot;Buffaslug&quot; uniforms, but the following season, they released a new third jersey featuring the classic look depicted in the navy, gold, silver and white colors. The Sabres also wore the original white uniforms during the 2008 Winter Classic.

The third jersey eventually became the primary home jersey on September 18, 2010, when the Sabres released a modern version of the classic 1970–1996 logo. A corresponding road white jersey was also released, along with a third jersey featuring an alternate throwback arrangement that pays homage to the AHL&#x27;s Buffalo Bisons, complete with the team&#x27;s 40th Anniversary insignia (essentially the original royal blue version of the current logo with the year &quot;1970&quot; inside).

In 2013, the Sabres released a new third jersey, featuring a gold front and navy back design. The uniform only lasted two seasons, after which it was retired.

The Sabres kept their uniforms largely intact when Adidas took over as its supplier, save for the removal of silver sections in the armpits. They were also the only remaining NHL team to sport uniform numbers in front; teams such as the Dallas Stars and San Jose Sharks briefly added numbers in front of their uniforms before removing them altogether.

During the 2018 Winter Classic, the Sabres broke out white uniforms with the classic blue and gold shade, albeit with a different striping scheme from the original uniforms.

The 2019–20 season marked the final season of the navy and gold look, as the Sabres announced the return to royal blue uniforms for the following season. Also, a 50th-anniversary white third jersey was used, featuring metallic gold elements on the logo and stripes.

On August 11, 2020, the Sabres unveiled the uniforms for the upcoming season. The style is similar to the ones worn in the early days of the franchise. Jersey numbers are no longer displayed on the front. The Sabres also released a &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; alternate uniform, bringing back the &quot;crossed swords&quot; alternate from 2000 to 2006 but recolored to the current royal, gold and white scheme.

For the 2022 Heritage Classic, the Sabres again wore a variation of their classic uniforms, but without the blue shoulder yoke and with a cream base.

On August 31, 2022, the Sabres announced that their black uniform used from 1995 to 2006 would become their new third jersey. This same uniform also became the basis of their second &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; uniform, but recolored to the white, blue and gold scheme and featured white pants.

==National anthems==
The Canadian and U.S. national anthems are sung before every Sabres home game, regardless if the visiting team is Canadian or American, because Buffalo is adjacent to the Canadian border and many spectators come from Canada. Doug Allen sang the Canadian and US national anthems at most home games (except in cases where there is a conflict with his charitable work for the Wesleyan Church) until resigning in 2021 because of his refusal to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Curtis Cook is the arena&#x27;s in-game organist. During Tom Golisano&#x27;s ownership, the team occasionally used the services of singer Ronan Tynan, who sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; while Allen performed the Canadian anthem (in such cases, the U.S. anthem was not performed). When Allen was unavailable, Kevin Kennedy (the regular anthem singer for the Buffalo Bandits) is the usual fill-in; on rare occasions since the Pegulas took over, Black River Entertainment personalities have performed the anthems.

==In-game hosting==
Rich Gaenzler, morning host at WGRF, took over as in-game host beginning in 2018 before he was fired in 2021 over an unrelated dispute pertaining to his WGRF show, which was canceled at the same time. WBFO personality Jay Moran is the current public address announcer; he succeeded Milt Ellis in the position.

In November 2021, the Sabres added an official team dog, named Rick, a Newfoundland puppy trained as a service animal. Nick was graduated to daily service and succeeded by Nikki, a golden retriever puppy.

===Minor league affiliates===
The Sabres are presently affiliated with two minor league teams, the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League, and the Jacksonville Icemen of the ECHL. The Americans play at the Blue Cross Arena in Rochester, New York. Founded in 1956, the Americans were previously the Sabres AHL affiliate from the 1979–80 season to the 2007–08 season. During the original Sabres affiliation, the Americans won three Calder Cup championships and finished as runners-up another six times. They finished out of the playoffs only five times in 28 years. The Sabres became re-affiliated with the Americans starting with the 2011–12 season when after buying the Sabres, Pegula purchased the Americans from former owner Curt Styres.

The Jacksonville Icemen are based in Jacksonville, Florida and have been the Sabres ECHL affiliate since the 2023–24 season. Unlike the Americans, the Icemen are not owned by Pegula but are instead owned by SZH Hockey LLC.

===Hockey Hall of Famers===
The Buffalo Sabres has an affiliation with a number of inductees to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Sabres inductees include 13 former players and four builders of the sport. The four individuals recognized as builders by the Hall of Fame includes former general managers, head coaches, and owners. In addition to players and builders, three broadcasters for the Buffalo Sabres were also awarded the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame, Ted Darling in 1994, Rick Jeanneret in 2012, and Harry Neale in 2013.

Four sports writers from publications based in Buffalo, and St. Catharines, Ontario (which is within Buffalo&#x27;s media territory), were also awarded the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame. Recipients of the award include Charlie Barton (&quot;Buffalo Courier-Express&quot;) in 1985, Dick Johnston (&quot;Buffalo News&quot;) in 1986, Jack Gatecliff (&quot;St. Catharines Standard&quot;) in 1995, and Jim Kelley (&quot;Buffalo News&quot;) in 2004.

===Retired numbers===
* 1 When the No. 14 of Robert and the No. 7 of Martin were retired, Gilbert Perreault was present, as the entire &quot;French Connection&quot; line was given retirement together. Perreault&#x27;s No. 11 was lowered and then raised back in the center under the French Connection banner, as shown above.
* SHK III and NRK (team founders Seymour H. Knox III and Northrup R. Knox. Two banners bearing their initials and the Sabres blue and gold reside in the KeyBank Center&#x27;s rafters.)
* RJ (longtime play-by-play announcer Rick Jeanneret. A banner bearing his initials was raised on April 1, 2022.)
* Although Alexander Mogilny&#x27;s number 89 is not officially retired by the team, it has only been issued once since his departure following the 1994–95 season, to Alex Tuch in 2021. Cory Conacher switched to 88 expressly out of deference to Mogilny in 2014. Likewise, Ryan Miller, who traditionally wore 39, wore 30 during his time with the Sabres out of deference to Hasek, long before 39 was announced to be retired. Miller&#x27;s number 30 would also eventually be retired on January 19, 2023.
* The NHL retired Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s No. 99 for all its member teams at the 2000 NHL All-Star Game.

<text>In Search of Lost Time (), first translated into English as Remembrance of Things Past, and sometimes referred to in French as La Recherche (&quot;The Search&quot;), is a novel in seven volumes by French author Marcel Proust. This early 20th-century work is his most prominent, known both for its length and its theme of involuntary memory. The most famous example of this is the &quot;episode of the madeleine&quot;, which occurs early in the first volume.

The novel gained fame in English in translations by C. K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin as &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;. The title &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;, a literal rendering of the French, became ascendant after D. J. Enright adopted it for his revised translation published in 1992.

&quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; follows the narrator&#x27;s recollections of childhood and experiences into adulthood in late 19th-century and early 20th-century high-society France. Proust began to shape the novel in 1909; he continued to work on it until his final illness in the autumn of 1922 forced him to break off. Proust established the structure early on, but even after volumes were initially finished, he continued to add new material and edited one volume after another for publication. The last three of the seven volumes contain oversights and fragmentary or unpolished passages, as they existed only in draft form at the death of the author. His brother Robert oversaw editing and publication of these parts.

The work was published in France between 1913 and 1927. Proust paid to publish the first volume (with Éditions Grasset) after it had been turned down by leading editors who had been offered the manuscript in longhand. Many of its ideas, motifs and scenes were anticipated in Proust&#x27;s unfinished novel, &quot;Jean Santeuil&quot; (1896–1899), though the perspective and treatment there are different, and in his unfinished hybrid of philosophical essay and story, &quot;Contre Sainte-Beuve&quot; (1908–09).

The novel had great influence on twentieth-century literature; some writers have sought to emulate it, others to parody it. For the centenary of the French publication of the novel&#x27;s first volume, American author Edmund White pronounced &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; &quot;the most respected novel of the twentieth century.&quot;

It holds the Guinness World Record for longest novel.

== Initial publication ==

The novel was initially published in seven volumes:
# Swann&#x27;s Way (&quot;Du côté de chez Swann&quot;, sometimes translated as &quot;The Way by Swann&#x27;s&quot;), published in 1913, was rejected by a number of publishers, including Fasquelle, Ollendorff, and the &quot;Nouvelle Revue Française&quot; (&quot;NRF&quot;). André Gide was famously given the manuscript to read to advise the &quot;NRF&quot; on publication and, leafing through the seemingly endless collection of memories and philosophizing or melancholic episodes, came across a few minor syntactic errors, which made him decide to turn the work down in his audit. Proust eventually arranged with the publisher Grasset to pay the cost of publication himself. When published, the book was advertised as the first of a three-volume novel (Bouillaguet and Rogers, 316–7). &quot;Du côté de chez Swann&quot; is divided into four parts: &quot;Combray I&quot; (sometimes referred to in English as the &quot;Overture&quot;), &quot;Combray II&quot;, &quot;Un Amour de Swann&quot; (&quot;Swann in Love&quot;), and &quot;Noms de pays: le nom&quot; (&quot;Names of places: the name&quot;). A third-person novella within &quot;Du côté de chez Swann&quot;, &quot;Un Amour de Swann&quot; is sometimes published as a volume by itself. As it forms the self-contained story of Charles Swann&#x27;s love affair with Odette de Crécy and is relatively short, it is generally considered a good introduction to the work and is often a set text in French schools. &quot;Combray I&quot; is similarly excerpted; it ends with the famous madeleine cake episode, introducing the theme of involuntary memory. In early 1914 Gide, who had been involved in the &quot;NRF&quot;&#x27;s rejection of the book, wrote to Proust to apologize and to offer congratulations on the novel: For several days I have been unable to put your book down ... The rejection of this book will remain the most serious mistake ever made by the &quot;NRF&quot; and, since I bear the shame of being very much responsible for it, one of the most stinging and remorseful regrets of my life (Tadié, 611).Gallimard (the publishing arm of the &quot;NRF&quot;) offered to publish the remaining volumes, but Proust chose to stay with Grasset.
# In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower (&quot;À l&#x27;ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs&quot;, also translated as Within a Budding Grove), published in 1919, was scheduled to be published in 1914 but was delayed by the onset of World War I. At the same time, Grasset&#x27;s firm was closed down when the publisher went into military service. This freed Proust to move to Gallimard, where all of the subsequent volumes were published. Meanwhile, the novel kept growing in length and in conception. When published, this volume was awarded the Prix Goncourt in 1919.
# The Guermantes Way (&quot;Le Côté de Guermantes&quot;) was published in 1920 and 1921 and was originally split into two volumes as &quot;Le Côté de Guermantes I&quot; and &quot;Le Côté de Guermantes II&quot;.
# Sodom and Gomorrah (&quot;Sodome et Gomorrhe&quot;, sometimes translated as &quot;Cities of the Plain&quot;) was published in 1921 and 1922 and was also split into two volumes. The first forty pages of &quot;Sodome et Gomorrhe&quot; initially appeared at the end of &quot;Le Côté de Guermantes II&quot; (Bouillaguet and Rogers, 942), the remainder appearing as &quot;Sodome et Gomorrhe I&quot; (1921) and &quot;Sodome et Gomorrhe II&quot; (1922). It was the last volume over which Proust supervised publication before his death in November 1922. The publication of the remaining volumes was carried out by his brother, Robert Proust, and Jacques Rivière.
# The Prisoner (&quot;La Prisonnière&quot;, also translated as The Captive), published in 1923, is the first volume of the section within &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; known as &quot;le Roman d&#x27;Albertine&quot; (&quot;the Albertine novel&quot;). The name &quot;Albertine&quot; first appears in Proust&#x27;s notebooks in 1913. The material in volumes 5 and 6 were developed during the hiatus between the publication of volumes 1 and 2 and they are a departure of the original three-volume series originally planned by Proust. This is the first of Proust&#x27;s books published posthumously. Early editions describe &quot;La Prisonnière&quot; as the third volume of &quot;Sodome et Gomorrhe&quot;. 
# The Fugitive (&quot;Albertine disparue&quot;, also titled &quot;La Fugitive&quot;, sometimes translated as &quot;The Sweet Cheat Gone&quot; [the last line of Walter de la Mare&#x27;s poem &quot;The Ghost&quot;] or &quot;Albertine Gone&quot;), published in 1925, is the second and final volume in &quot;le Roman d&#x27;Albertine&quot; and the second volume published after Proust&#x27;s death. It is the most editorially vexed volume. As noted, the final three volumes of the novel were published posthumously, and without Proust&#x27;s final corrections and revisions. The first edition, based on Proust&#x27;s manuscript, was published as &quot;Albertine disparue&quot; to prevent it from being confused with Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s &quot;La Fugitive&quot;, first published in 1921. The first authoritative edition of the novel in French (1954), also based on Proust&#x27;s manuscript, used the title &quot;La Fugitive&quot;. The second, even more authoritative French edition (1987–89), uses the title &quot;Albertine disparue&quot; and is based on an unmarked typescript acquired in 1962 by the Bibliothèque Nationale. To complicate matters, after the death in 1986 of Proust&#x27;s niece, Suzy Mante-Proust, her son-in-law discovered among her papers a typescript that had been corrected and annotated by Proust. The late changes Proust made include a small, crucial detail and the deletion of approximately 150 pages. This version was published as &quot;Albertine disparue&quot; in France in 1987.
# Finding Time Again (&quot;Le Temps retrouvé&quot;, also translated as Time Regained and &quot;The Past Recaptured&quot;), published in 1927, is the final volume in Proust&#x27;s novel. Much of the final volume was written at the same time as &quot;Swann&#x27;s Way&quot;, but was revised and expanded during the course of the novel&#x27;s publication to account for, to a greater or lesser success, the then unforeseen material now contained in the middle volumes (Terdiman, 153n3). This volume includes a noteworthy episode describing Paris during the First World War.

== Synopsis ==
The novel recounts the experiences of the Narrator (who is never definitively named) while he is growing up, learning about art, participating in society, and falling in love.

=== Volume One: &quot;Swann&#x27;s Way&quot; ===


The Narrator begins by noting, &quot;For a long time, I went to bed early.&quot; He comments on the way in which sleep seems to alter one&#x27;s surroundings, and the way habit makes one indifferent to them. He remembers being in his room in the family&#x27;s country home in Combray, while downstairs his parents entertain their friend Charles Swann, an elegant man of Jewish origin with strong ties to society. Due to Swann&#x27;s visit, the Narrator is deprived of his mother&#x27;s goodnight kiss, but he gets her to spend the night reading to him. This memory is the only one he has of Combray until years later the taste of a madeleine cake dipped in tea inspires a nostalgic incident of involuntary memory. He remembers having a similar snack as a child with his invalid aunt Léonie, and it leads to more memories of Combray. He describes their servant Françoise, who is uneducated but possesses an earthy wisdom and a strong sense of both duty and tradition. He meets an elegant &quot;lady in pink&quot; while visiting his uncle Adolphe. He develops a love of the theater, especially the actress la Berma, and his awkward Jewish friend Bloch introduces him to the works of the writer Bergotte. He learns Swann made an unsuitable marriage but has social ambitions for his beautiful daughter Gilberte. Legrandin, a snobbish friend of the family, tries to avoid introducing the boy to his well-to-do sister. The Narrator describes two routes for country walks the child and his parents often enjoyed: the way past Swann&#x27;s home (the Méséglise way), and the Guermantes way, both containing scenes of natural beauty. Taking the Méséglise way, he sees Gilberte Swann standing in her yard with a lady in white, Mme. Swann, and her supposed lover: Baron de Charlus, a friend of Swann&#x27;s. Gilberte makes a gesture that the Narrator interprets as a rude dismissal. During another walk, he spies a lesbian scene involving Mlle. Vinteuil, daughter of a composer, and her friend. The Guermantes way is symbolic of the Guermantes family, the nobility of the area. The Narrator is awed by the magic of their name and is captivated when he first sees Mme. de Guermantes. He discovers how appearances conceal the true nature of things and tries writing a description of some nearby steeples. Lying in bed, he seems transported back to these places until he awakens.

Mme. Verdurin is an autocratic hostess who, aided by her husband, demands total obedience from the guests in her &quot;little clan&quot;. One guest is Odette de Crécy, a former courtesan, who has met Swann and invites him to the group. Swann is too refined for such company, but Odette gradually intrigues him with her unusual style. A sonata by Vinteuil, which features a &quot;little phrase&quot;, becomes the motif for their deepening relationship. The Verdurins host M. de Forcheville; their guests include Cottard, a doctor; Brichot, an academic; Saniette, the object of scorn; and a painter, M. Biche. Swann grows jealous of Odette, who now keeps him at arm&#x27;s length, and suspects an affair between her and Forcheville, aided by the Verdurins. Swann seeks respite by attending a society concert that includes Legrandin&#x27;s sister and a young Mme. de Guermantes; the &quot;little phrase&quot; is played and Swann realizes Odette&#x27;s love for him is gone. He tortures himself wondering about her true relationships with others, but his love for her, despite renewals, gradually diminishes. He moves on and marvels that he ever loved a woman who was not his type.

At home in Paris, the Narrator dreams of visiting Venice or the church in Balbec, a resort, but he is too unwell and instead takes walks in the Champs-Élysées. There he meets and befriends Gilberte. He holds her father, now married to Odette, in the highest esteem, and is awed by the beautiful sight of Mme. Swann strolling in public. Years later, the old sights of the area are long gone, and he laments the fleeting nature of places.

=== Volume Two: &quot;In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower&quot; ===

The Narrator&#x27;s parents invite M. de Norpois, a diplomat colleague of the Narrator&#x27;s father, to dinner. With Norpois&#x27;s intervention, the Narrator is finally allowed to go and see the Berma perform in a play, but is disappointed by her acting. Afterwards, at dinner, he watches Norpois, who is extremely diplomatic and correct at all times, expound on society and art. The Narrator gives him a draft of his writing, but Norpois gently indicates it is not good. The Narrator continues to go to the Champs-Élysées and play with Gilberte. Her parents distrust him, so he writes to them in protest. He and Gilberte wrestle and he has an orgasm. Gilberte invites him to tea, and he becomes a regular at her house. He observes Mme. Swann&#x27;s inferior social status, Swann&#x27;s lowered standards and indifference towards his wife, and Gilberte&#x27;s affection for her father. The Narrator contemplates how he has attained his wish to know the Swanns, and savors their unique style. At one of their parties he meets and befriends Bergotte, who gives his impressions of society figures and artists. But the Narrator is still unable to start writing seriously. His friend Bloch takes him to a brothel, where there is a Jewish prostitute named Rachel. He showers Mme. Swann with flowers, being almost on better terms with her than with Gilberte. One day, he and Gilberte quarrel and he decides never to see her again. However, he continues to visit Mme. Swann, who has become a popular hostess, with her guests including Mme. Bontemps, who has a niece named Albertine. The Narrator hopes for a letter from Gilberte repairing their friendship, but gradually feels himself losing interest. He breaks down and plans to reconcile with her, but spies from afar someone resembling her walking with a boy and gives her up for good. He stops visiting her mother also, who is now a celebrated beauty admired by passersby, and years later he can recall the glamour she displayed then.

Two years later, the Narrator, his grandmother, and Françoise set out for the seaside town of Balbec. The Narrator is almost totally indifferent to Gilberte now. During the train ride, his grandmother, who only believes in proper books, lends him her favorite: the &quot;Letters&quot; of Mme. de Sévigné. At Balbec, the Narrator is disappointed with the church and uncomfortable in his unfamiliar hotel room, but his grandmother comforts him. He admires the seascape, and learns about the colorful staff and customers around the hotel: Aimé, the discreet headwaiter; the lift operator; M. de Stermaria and his beautiful young daughter; and M. de Cambremer and his wife, Legrandin&#x27;s sister. His grandmother encounters an old friend, the blue-blooded Mme. de Villeparisis, and they renew their friendship. The three of them go for rides in the country, openly discussing art and politics. The Narrator longs for the country girls he sees alongside the roads, and has a strange feeling—possibly memory, possibly something else—while admiring a row of three trees. Mme. de Villeparisis is joined by her glamorous great-nephew Robert de Saint-Loup, who is involved with an unsuitable woman. Despite initial awkwardness, the Narrator and his grandmother become good friends with him. Bloch, the childhood friend from Combray, turns up with his family, and acts in typically inappropriate fashion. Saint-Loup&#x27;s ultra-aristocratic and extremely rude uncle the Baron de Charlus arrives. The Narrator discovers Mme. de Villeparisis, her nephew M. de Charlus, and his nephew Saint-Loup are all of the Guermantes family. Charlus ignores the Narrator, but later visits him in his room and lends him a book. The next day, the Baron speaks shockingly informally to him, then demands the book back. The Narrator ponders Saint-Loup&#x27;s attitude towards his aristocratic roots, and his relationship with his mistress, a mere actress whose recital bombed horribly with his family. One day, the Narrator sees a &quot;little band&quot; of teenage girls strolling beside the sea, and becomes infatuated with them, along with an unseen hotel guest named Mlle. Simonet. He joins Saint-Loup for dinner and reflects on how drunkenness affects his perceptions. Later they meet the painter Elstir, and the Narrator visits his studio. The Narrator marvels at Elstir&#x27;s method of renewing impressions of ordinary things, as well as his connections with the Verdurins (he is &quot;M. Biche&quot;) and Mme. Swann. He discovers the painter knows the teenage girls, particularly one dark-haired beauty who is Albertine Simonet. Elstir arranges an introduction, and the Narrator becomes friends with her, as well as her friends Andrée, Rosemonde, and Gisèle. The group goes for picnics and tours the countryside, as well as playing games, while the Narrator reflects on the nature of love as he becomes attracted to Albertine. Despite her rejection, they become close, although he still feels attracted to the whole group. At summer&#x27;s end, the town closes up, and the Narrator is left with his image of first seeing the girls walking beside the sea.

=== Volume Three: &quot;The Guermantes Way&quot; ===

The Narrator&#x27;s family has moved to an apartment connected with the Guermantes residence. Françoise befriends a fellow tenant, the tailor Jupien and his niece. The Narrator is fascinated by the Guermantes and their life, and is awed by their social circle while attending another Berma performance. He begins staking out the street where Mme. de Guermantes walks every day, to her evident annoyance. He decides to visit her nephew Saint-Loup at his military base, to ask to be introduced to her. After noting the landscape and his state of mind while sleeping, the Narrator meets and attends dinners with Saint-Loup&#x27;s fellow officers, where they discuss the Dreyfus Affair and the art of military strategy. But the Narrator returns home after receiving a call from his aging grandmother. Mme. de Guermantes declines to see him, and he also finds he is still unable to begin writing. Saint-Loup visits on leave, and they have lunch and attend a recital with his actress mistress: Rachel, the Jewish prostitute, toward whom the unsuspecting Saint-Loup is crazed with jealousy. The Narrator then goes to Mme. de Villeparisis&#x27;s salon, which is considered second-rate despite its public reputation. Legrandin attends and displays his social climbing. Bloch stridently interrogates M. de Norpois about the Dreyfus Affair, which has ripped all of society asunder, but Norpois diplomatically avoids answering. The Narrator observes Mme. de Guermantes and her aristocratic bearing, as she makes caustic remarks about friends and family, including the mistresses of her husband, who is M. de Charlus&#x27;s brother. Mme. Swann arrives, and the Narrator remembers a visit from Morel, the son of his uncle Adolphe&#x27;s valet, who revealed that the &quot;lady in pink&quot; was Mme. Swann. Charlus asks the Narrator to leave with him, and offers to make him his protégé. At home, the Narrator&#x27;s grandmother has worsened, and while walking with him she suffers a stroke.

The family seeks out the best medical help, and she is often visited by Bergotte, himself unwell, but she dies, her face reverting to its youthful appearance. Several months later, Saint-Loup, now single, convinces the Narrator to ask out the Stermaria daughter, newly divorced. Albertine visits; she has matured and they share a kiss. The Narrator then goes to see Mme. de Villeparisis, where Mme. de Guermantes, whom he has stopped following, invites him to dinner. The Narrator daydreams of Mme. de Stermaria, but she abruptly cancels, although Saint-Loup rescues him from despair by taking him to dine with his aristocratic friends, who engage in petty gossip. Saint-Loup passes on an invitation from Charlus to come visit him. The next day, at the Guermantes&#x27;s dinner party, the Narrator admires their Elstir paintings, then meets the cream of society, including the Princess of Parma, who is an amiable simpleton. He learns more about the Guermantes: their hereditary features; their less-refined cousins the Courvoisiers; and Mme. de Guermantes&#x27;s celebrated humor, artistic tastes, and exalted diction (although she does not live up to the enchantment of her name). The discussion turns to gossip about society, including Charlus and his late wife; the affair between Norpois and Mme. de Villeparisis; and aristocratic lineages. Leaving, the Narrator visits Charlus, who falsely accuses him of slandering him. The Narrator stomps on Charlus&#x27;s hat and storms out, but Charlus is strangely unperturbed and gives him a ride home. Months later, the Narrator is invited to the Princesse de Guermantes&#x27;s party. He tries to verify the invitation with M. and Mme. de Guermantes, but first sees something he will describe later. They will be attending the party but do not help him, and while they are chatting, Swann arrives. Now a committed Dreyfusard, he is very sick and nearing death, but the Guermantes assure him he will outlive them.

=== Volume Four: &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah&quot; ===
The Narrator describes what he had seen earlier: while waiting for the Guermantes to return so he could ask about his invitation, he saw Charlus encounter Jupien in their courtyard. The two then went into Jupien&#x27;s shop and had intercourse. The Narrator reflects on the nature of &quot;inverts&quot;, and how they are like a secret society, never able to live in the open. He compares them to flowers, whose reproduction through the aid of insects depends solely on happenstance. Arriving at the Princesse&#x27;s party, his invitation seems valid as he is greeted warmly by her. He sees Charlus exchanging knowing looks with the diplomat Vaugoubert, a fellow invert. After several tries, the Narrator manages to be introduced to the Prince de Guermantes, who then walks off with Swann, causing speculation on the topic of their conversation. Mme. de Saint-Euverte tries to recruit guests for her party the next day, but is subjected to scorn from some of the Guermantes. Charlus is captivated by the two young sons of M. de Guermantes&#x27;s newest mistress. Saint-Loup arrives and mentions the names of several promiscuous women to the Narrator. Swann takes the Narrator aside and reveals the Prince wanted to admit his and his wife&#x27;s pro-Dreyfus leanings. Swann is aware of his old friend Charlus&#x27;s behavior, then urges the Narrator to visit Gilberte, and departs. The Narrator leaves with M. and Mme. de Guermantes, and heads home for a late-night meeting with Albertine. He grows frantic when first she is late and then calls to cancel, but he convinces her to come. He writes an indifferent letter to Gilberte, and reviews the changing social scene, which now includes Mme. Swann&#x27;s salon centered on Bergotte.

He decides to return to Balbec, after learning the women mentioned by Saint-Loup will be there. At Balbec, grief at his grandmother&#x27;s suffering, which was worse than he knew, overwhelms him. He ponders the intermittencies of the heart and the ways of dealing with sad memories. His mother, even sadder, has become more like his grandmother in homage. Albertine is nearby and they begin spending time together, but he starts to suspect her of lesbianism and of lying to him about her activities. He fakes a preference for her friend Andrée to make her become more trustworthy, and it works, but he soon suspects her of knowing several scandalous women at the hotel, including Léa, an actress. On the way to visit Saint-Loup, they meet Morel, the valet&#x27;s son who is now an excellent violinist, and then the aging Charlus, who falsely claims to know Morel and goes to speak to him. The Narrator visits the Verdurins, who are renting a house from the Cambremers. On the train with him is the little clan: Brichot, who explains at length the derivation of the local place-names; Cottard, now a celebrated doctor; Saniette, still the butt of everyone&#x27;s ridicule; and a new member, Ski. The Verdurins are still haughty and dictatorial toward their guests, who are as pedantic as ever. Charlus and Morel arrive together, and Charlus&#x27;s true nature is barely concealed. The Cambremers arrive, and the Verdurins barely tolerate them.

Back at the hotel, the Narrator ruminates on sleep and time, and observes the amusing mannerisms of the staff, who are mostly aware of Charlus&#x27;s proclivities. The Narrator and Albertine hire a chauffeur and take rides in the country, leading to observations about new forms of travel as well as country life. The Narrator is unaware that the chauffeur and Morel are acquainted, and he reviews Morel&#x27;s amoral character and plans towards Jupien&#x27;s niece. The Narrator is jealously suspicious of Albertine but grows tired of her. She and the Narrator attend evening dinners at the Verdurins, taking the train with the other guests; Charlus is now a regular, despite his obliviousness to the clan&#x27;s mockery. He and Morel try to maintain the secret of their relationship, and the Narrator recounts a ploy involving a fake duel that Charlus used to control Morel. The passing station stops remind the Narrator of various people and incidents, including two failed attempts by the Prince de Guermantes to arrange liaisons with Morel; a final break between the Verdurins and Cambremers; and a misunderstanding between the Narrator, Charlus, and Bloch. The Narrator has grown weary of the area and prefers others over Albertine, but she reveals to him as they leave the train that she has plans with Mlle. Vinteuil and her friend (the lesbians from Combray), which plunges him into despair. He invents a story about a broken engagement of his, to convince her to go to Paris with him, and after hesitating she suddenly agrees to go immediately. The Narrator tells his mother: he must marry Albertine.

=== Volume Five: &quot;The Prisoner&quot; ===
The Narrator is living with Albertine in his family&#x27;s apartment, to Françoise&#x27;s distrust and his absent mother&#x27;s chagrin. He marvels that he has come to possess her, but has grown bored with her. He mostly stays home, but has enlisted Andrée to report on Albertine&#x27;s whereabouts, as his jealousy remains. The Narrator gets advice on fashion from Mme. de Guermantes, and encounters Charlus and Morel visiting Jupien and his niece, who is being married off to Morel despite his cruelty towards her. One day, the Narrator returns from the Guermantes and finds Andrée just leaving, claiming to dislike the smell of their flowers. Albertine, who is more guarded to avoid provoking his jealousy, is maturing into an intelligent and elegant young lady. The Narrator is entranced by her beauty as she sleeps, and is only content when she is not out with others. She mentions wanting to go to the Verdurins, but the Narrator suspects an ulterior motive and analyzes her conversation for hints. He suggests she go instead to the Trocadéro with Andrée, and she reluctantly agrees. The Narrator compares dreams to wakefulness, and listens to the street vendors with Albertine, then she departs. He remembers trips she took with the chauffeur, then learns Léa the notorious actress will be at the Trocadero too. He sends Françoise to retrieve Albertine, and while waiting, he muses on music and Morel. When she returns, they go for a drive, while he pines for Venice and realizes she feels captive. He learns of Bergotte&#x27;s final illness. That evening, he sneaks off to the Verdurins to try to discover the reason for Albertine&#x27;s interest in them. He encounters Brichot on the way, and they discuss Swann, who has died. Charlus arrives and the Narrator reviews the Baron&#x27;s struggles with Morel, then learns Mlle. Vinteuil and her friend are expected (although they do not come). Morel joins in performing a septet by Vinteuil, which evokes commonalities with his sonata that only the composer could create. Mme. Verdurin is furious that Charlus has taken control of her party; in revenge the Verdurins persuade Morel to repudiate him, and Charlus falls temporarily ill from the shock. Returning home, the Narrator and Albertine fight about his solo visit to the Verdurins, and she denies having affairs with Léa or Mlle. Vinteuil, but admits she lied on occasion to avoid arguments. He threatens to break it off, but they reconcile. He appreciates art and fashion with her, and ponders her mysteriousness. But his suspicion of her and Andrée is renewed, and they quarrel. After two awkward days and a restless night, he resolves to end the affair, but in the morning Françoise informs him: Albertine has asked for her boxes and left.

=== Volume Six: &quot;The Fugitive&quot; ===
The Narrator is anguished at Albertine&#x27;s departure and absence. He dispatches Saint-Loup to convince her aunt Mme. Bontemps to send her back, but Albertine insists the Narrator should ask, and she will gladly return. The Narrator lies and replies he is done with her, but she just agrees with him. He writes to her that he will marry Andrée, then hears from Saint-Loup of the failure of his mission to the aunt. Desperate, he begs Albertine to return, but receives word: she has died in a riding accident. He receives two last letters from her: one wishing him and Andrée well, and one asking if she can return. The Narrator plunges into suffering amid the many different memories of Albertine, intimately linked to all of his everyday sensations. He recalls a suspicious incident she told him of at Balbec, and asks Aimé, the headwaiter, to investigate. He recalls their history together and his regrets, as well as love&#x27;s randomness. Aimé reports back: Albertine often engaged in affairs with girls at Balbec. The Narrator sends him to learn more, and he reports other liaisons with girls. The Narrator wishes he could have known the true Albertine, whom he would have accepted. He begins to grow accustomed to the idea of her death, despite constant reminders that renew his grief. Andrée admits her own lesbianism but denies being with Albertine. The Narrator knows he will forget Albertine, just as he has forgotten Gilberte.

He happens to meet Gilberte again; her mother Mme. Swann became Mme. de Forcheville and Gilberte is now part of high society, received by the Guermantes. The Narrator publishes an article in &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. Andrée visits him and confesses her relations with Albertine. She also explains the truth behind Albertine&#x27;s departure: her aunt wanted her to marry another man. The Narrator and his mother visit Venice, which enthralls him. They happen to see Norpois and Mme. de Villeparisis there. A telegram signed from Albertine arrives, but the Narrator is indifferent. Returning home, the Narrator and his mother receive surprising news: Gilberte will marry Saint-Loup, and Jupien&#x27;s niece will be adopted by Charlus and then married to Legrandin&#x27;s nephew, an invert. There is much discussion of these marriages among society. The Narrator visits Gilberte in her new home where he also realizes that the telegram was from her, not Albertine, who is not alive, and is shocked to learn of Saint-Loup&#x27;s affair with Morel, among others. He despairs for their friendship.

=== Volume Seven: &quot;Time Regained&quot; ===
The Narrator is staying with Gilberte at her home near Combray. They go for walks, on one of which he is stunned to learn the Méséglise way and the Guermantes way are actually linked. Gilberte also tells him she was attracted to him when young, and had made a suggestive gesture to him as he watched her. Also, it was Léa she was walking with the evening he had planned to reconcile with her. He considers Saint-Loup&#x27;s nature and reads an account of the Verdurins&#x27; salon, deciding he has no talent for writing.

The scene shifts to a night in 1916, during World War I, when the Narrator has returned to Paris from a stay in a sanatorium and is walking the streets during a blackout. He reflects on the changed norms of art and society, with the Verdurins now highly esteemed. He recounts a 1914 visit from Saint-Loup, who was trying to enlist secretly. He recalls descriptions of the fighting he subsequently received from Saint-Loup and Gilberte, whose home was threatened. He describes a call paid on him a few days previously by Saint-Loup; they discussed military strategy. Now on the dark street, the Narrator encounters Charlus, who has completely surrendered to his impulses. Charlus reviews Morel&#x27;s betrayals and his own temptation to seek vengeance; critiques Brichot&#x27;s new fame as a writer, which has ostracized him from the Verdurins; and admits his general sympathy with Germany. The last part of the conversation draws a crowd of suspicious onlookers. After parting the Narrator seeks refuge in what appears to be a hotel, where he sees someone who looks familiar leaving. Inside, he discovers it to be a male brothel, and spies Charlus using the services. The proprietor turns out to be Jupien, who expresses a perverse pride in his business. A few days later, news comes that Saint-Loup has been killed in combat. The Narrator pieces together that Saint-Loup had visited Jupien&#x27;s brothel, and ponders what might have been had he lived.

Years later, again in Paris, the Narrator goes to a party at the house of the Prince de Guermantes. On the way he sees Charlus, now a mere shell of his former self, being helped by Jupien. The paving stones at the Guermantes house inspire another incident of involuntary memory for the Narrator, quickly followed by two more. Inside, while waiting in the library, he discerns their meaning: by putting him in contact with both the past and present, the impressions allow him to gain a vantage point outside time, affording a glimpse of the true nature of things. He realizes his whole life has prepared him for the mission of describing events as fully revealed, and (finally) resolves to begin writing. Entering the party, he is shocked at the disguises old age has given to the people he knew, and at the changes in society. Legrandin is now an invert, but is no longer a snob. Bloch is a respected writer and vital figure in society. Morel has reformed and become a respected citizen. Mme. de Forcheville is the mistress of M. de Guermantes. Mme. Verdurin has married the Prince de Guermantes after both their spouses died. Rachel is the star of the party, abetted by Mme. de Guermantes, whose social position has been eroded by her affinity for theater. Gilberte introduces her daughter to the Narrator; he is struck by the way the daughter encapsulates both the Méséglise and Guermantes ways within herself. He is spurred to writing, with help from Françoise and despite signs of approaching death. He realizes that every person carries within them the accumulated baggage of their past, and concludes that to be accurate he must describe how everyone occupies an immense range &quot;in Time&quot;.

== Themes ==
&quot;À la recherche&quot; made a decisive break with the 19th-century realist and plot-driven novel, populated by people of action and people representing social and cultural groups or morals. Although parts of the novel could be read as an exploration of snobbery, deceit, jealousy and suffering, and although it contains a multitude of realistic details, the focus is not on the development of a tight plot or of a coherent evolution but on a multiplicity of perspectives and on the formation of experience. The protagonists of the first volume (the narrator as a boy and Swann) are, by the standards of 19th-century novels, remarkably introspective and passive, nor do they trigger action from other leading characters; to contemporary readers, reared on Honoré de Balzac, Victor Hugo and Leo Tolstoy, they would not function as centers of a plot. While there is an array of symbolism in the work, it is rarely defined through explicit &quot;keys&quot; leading to moral, romantic or philosophical ideas. The significance of what is happening is often placed within the memory or into the inner contemplation of what is described. This focus on the relationship between experience, memory and writing and the radical de-emphasizing of the outward plot, have become staples of the modern novel but were almost unheard of in 1913.

Roger Shattuck elucidates an underlying principle in understanding Proust and the various themes present in his novel:

Thus the novel embodies and manifests the principle of intermittence: to live means to perceive different and often conflicting aspects of reality. This iridescence never resolves itself completely into a unitive point of view. Accordingly, it is possible to project out of the &quot;Search&quot; itself a series of putative and intermittent authors ... The portraitist of an expiring society, the artist of romantic reminiscence, the narrator of the laminated &quot;I,&quot; the classicist of formal structure—all these figures are to be found in Proust ...

=== Memory ===
The role of memory is central to the novel, introduced with the famous madeleine episode in the first section of the novel and in the last volume, &quot;Time Regained&quot;, a flashback similar to that caused by the madeleine is the beginning of the resolution of the story. Throughout the work many similar instances of involuntary memory, triggered by sensory experiences such as sights, sounds and smells conjure important memories for the narrator and sometimes return attention to an earlier episode of the novel. Although Proust wrote contemporaneously with Sigmund Freud, with there being many points of similarity between their thought on the structures and mechanisms of the human mind, neither author read the other.

The madeleine episode reads:

No sooner had the warm liquid mixed with the crumbs touched my palate than a shudder ran through me and I stopped, intent upon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me. An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, something isolated, detached, with no suggestion of its origin. And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory—this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has of filling me with a precious essence; or rather this essence was not in me it was me. ... Whence did it come? What did it mean? How could I seize and apprehend it? ... And suddenly the memory revealed itself. The taste was that of the little piece of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray (because on those mornings I did not go out before mass), when I went to say good morning to her in her bedroom, my aunt Léonie used to give me, dipping it first in her own cup of tea or tisane. The sight of the little madeleine had recalled nothing to my mind before I tasted it. And all from my cup of tea.

Gilles Deleuze believed that the focus of Proust was not memory and the past but the narrator&#x27;s learning the use of &quot;signs&quot; to understand and communicate ultimate reality, thereby becoming an artist. While Proust was bitterly aware of the experience of loss and exclusion—loss of loved ones, loss of affection, friendship and innocent joy, which are dramatized in the novel through recurrent jealousy, betrayal and the death of loved ones—his response to this, formulated after he had discovered Ruskin, was that the work of art can recapture the lost and thus save it from destruction, at least in our minds. Art triumphs over the destructive power of time. This element of his artistic thought is clearly inherited from romantic platonism, but Proust crosses it with a new intensity in describing jealousy, desire and self-doubt. (Note the last quatrain of Baudelaire&#x27;s poem &quot;Une Charogne&quot;: &quot;Then, O my beauty! say to the worms who will / Devour you with kisses, / That I have kept the form and the divine essence / Of my decomposed love!&quot;)

=== Separation anxiety ===
Proust begins his novel with the statement, &quot;For a long time I used to go to bed early.&quot; This leads to lengthy discussion of his anxiety at leaving his mother at night and his attempts to force her to come and kiss him goodnight, even on nights when the family has company, culminating in a spectacular success, when his father suggests that his mother stay the night with him after he has waylaid her in the hall when she is going to bed.

His anxiety leads to manipulation, much like the manipulation employed by his invalid aunt Léonie and all the lovers in the entire book, who use the same methods of petty tyranny to manipulate and possess their loved ones.

=== Nature of art ===
The nature of art is a motif in the novel and is often explored at great length. Proust sets forth a theory of art in which we are all capable of producing art, if by this we mean taking the experiences of life and transforming them in a way that shows understanding and maturity. Writing, painting, and music are also discussed at great length. Morel the violinist is examined to give an example of a certain type of &quot;artistic&quot; character, along with other fictional artists like the novelist Bergotte, the composer Vinteuil, and the painter Elstir.

As early as the &quot;Combray&quot; section of &quot;Swann&#x27;s Way&quot;, the narrator is concerned with his ability to write, since he desires to pursue a writing career. The transmutation of the experience of a scene in one of the family&#x27;s usual walks into a short descriptive passage is described and the sample passage given. The narrator presents this passage as an early sample of his own writing, in which he has only had to alter a few words. The question of his own genius relates to all the passages in which genius is recognized or misunderstood because it presents itself in the guise of a humble friend, rather than a passionate &quot;artiste&quot;.

The question of taste or judgement in art is also an important theme, as exemplified by Swann&#x27;s exquisite taste in art, which is often hidden from his friends who do not share it or subordinated to his love interests.

=== Homosexuality ===
Questions pertaining to homosexuality appear throughout the novel, particularly in the later volumes. The first arrival of this theme comes in the &quot;Combray&quot; section of &quot;Swann&#x27;s Way&quot;, where the daughter of the piano teacher and composer Vinteuil is seduced, and the narrator observes her having lesbian relations in front of the portrait of her recently deceased father.

The narrator invariably suspects his lovers of liaisons with other women, a repetition of the suspicions held by Charles Swann about his mistress and eventual wife, Odette, in &quot;Swann&#x27;s Way&quot;. The first chapter of &quot;Cities of the Plain&quot; (&quot;Sodom and Gomorrah&quot;) includes a detailed account of a sexual encounter between M. de Charlus, the novel&#x27;s most prominent male homosexual, and his tailor. Critics have often observed that while the character of the narrator is ostensibly heterosexual, Proust intimates that the narrator is a closeted homosexual. The narrator&#x27;s manner towards male homosexuality is consistently aloof, yet the narrator is unaccountably knowledgeable. This strategy enables Proust to pursue themes related to male homosexuality—in particular the nature of closetedness—from both within and without a homosexual perspective. Proust does not designate Charlus&#x27;s homosexuality until the middle of the novel, in &quot;Cities&quot;; afterwards the Baron&#x27;s ostentatiousness and flamboyance, of which he is blithely unaware, completely absorb the narrator&#x27;s perception. Lesbianism, on the other hand, tortures Swann and the narrator because it presents an inaccessible world. Whereas male homosexual desire is recognizable, insofar as it encompasses male sexuality, Odette&#x27;s and Albertine&#x27;s lesbian trysts represent Swann and the narrator&#x27;s painful exclusion from characters they desire.

There is much debate as to how great a bearing Proust&#x27;s sexuality has on understanding these aspects of the novel. Although many of Proust&#x27;s close family and friends suspected that he was homosexual, Proust never admitted this. It was only after his death that André Gide, in his publication of correspondence with Proust, made public Proust&#x27;s homosexuality. In response to Gide&#x27;s criticism that he hid his actual sexuality within his novel, Proust told Gide that &quot;one can say anything so long as one does not say &#x27;I&#x27;.&quot; Proust&#x27;s intimate relations with such individuals as Alfred Agostinelli and Reynaldo Hahn are well-documented, though Proust was not &quot;out and proud&quot;, except perhaps in close-knit social circles.

In 1949, the critic Justin O&#x27;Brien published an article in the Publications of the Modern Language Association called &quot;Albertine the Ambiguous: Notes on Proust&#x27;s Transposition of Sexes&quot;, in which he proposed that some female characters are best understood as actually referring to young men. Strip off the feminine ending of the names of the Narrator&#x27;s lovers, Albertine, Gilberte, and Andrée, and one has their masculine counterparts. This theory has become known as the &quot;transposition of sexes theory&quot; in Proust criticism, but it has been challenged in &quot;Epistemology of the Closet&quot; (1990) by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and in &quot;Proust&#x27;s Lesbianism&quot; (1999) by Elisabeth Ladenson. Feminized forms of masculine names were and are commonplace in French.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; is considered, by many scholars and critics, to be the definitive modern novel. It has had a profound effect on subsequent writers, such as the British authors who were members of the Bloomsbury Group. Virginia Woolf wrote in 1922: &quot;Oh if I could write like that!&quot; Edith Wharton wrote that &quot;Every reader enamoured of the art must brood in amazement over the way in which Proust maintains the balance between these two manners—the broad and the minute. His endowment as a novelist—his range of presentation combined with mastery of his instruments—has probably never been surpassed.&quot; During Proust&#x27;s lifetime, on the other hand, while he would achieve success, he would also face criticism from critics of his work. According to &quot;Cambridge University Press&quot;, &quot;Proust&#x27;s reception during his lifetime is always set against the backdrop of often-hostile criticism, frequently based on the myth of the sickly, reclusive snob writing from the safety of his cork-lined room.&quot;

Harold Bloom wrote that &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; is now &quot;widely recognized as the major novel of the twentieth century&quot;. Vladimir Nabokov, in a 1965 interview, named the greatest prose works of the 20th century as, in order, &quot;Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, Kafka&#x27;s &quot;Transformation&quot; [usually called &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;], Bely&#x27;s &quot;Petersburg&quot;, and the first half of Proust&#x27;s fairy tale &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;&quot;. J. Peder Zane&#x27;s book &quot;The Top Ten: Writers Pick Their Favorite Books&quot;, collates 125 &quot;top 10 greatest books of all time&quot; lists by prominent living writers; &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; is placed eighth. In the 1960s, Swedish literary critic Bengt Holmqvist described the novel as &quot;at once the last great classic of French epic prose tradition and the towering precursor of the &#x27;nouveau roman&#x27;&quot;, indicating the vogue of new, experimental French prose but also, by extension, other post-war attempts to fuse different planes of location, temporality and fragmented consciousness within the same novel. Michael Dirda wrote that &quot;To its admirers, it remains one of those rare encyclopedic summas, like Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, the essays of Montaigne or Dante&#x27;s &quot;Commedia&quot;, that offer insight into our unruly passions and solace for life&#x27;s miseries.&quot; Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon has called it his favorite book.

Proust&#x27;s influence (in parody) is seen in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot; (1934), in which Chapter 1 is entitled &quot;Du Côté de Chez Beaver&quot; and Chapter 6 &quot;Du Côté de Chez Tod&quot;. Waugh did not like Proust: in letters to Nancy Mitford in 1948, he wrote, &quot;I am reading Proust for the first time ... and am surprised to find him a mental defective&quot; and later, &quot;I still think [Proust] insane ... the structure must be sane &amp; that is raving.&quot; Another hostile critic is Kazuo Ishiguro, who said in an interview: &quot;To be absolutely honest, apart from the opening volume of Proust, I find him crushingly dull.&quot;

Since the publication in 1992 of a revised English translation by The Modern Library, based on a new definitive French edition (1987–89), interest in Proust&#x27;s novel in the English-speaking world has increased. Two substantial new biographies have appeared in English, by Edmund White and William C. Carter, and at least two books about the experience of reading Proust have appeared, Alain de Botton&#x27;s &quot;How Proust Can Change Your Life&quot; and Phyllis Rose&#x27;s &quot;The Year of Reading Proust&quot;. The Proust Society of America, founded in 1997, has three chapters: at The New York Mercantile Library, the Mechanic&#x27;s Institute Library in San Francisco, and the Boston Athenæum Library. Furthermore, in 2016, The Proust Society of Greenwich, a non-profit organization was created to accommodate reading and discussing Proust to readers all over the world through monthly online sessions.

== English-language translations ==
The first six volumes were first translated into English by the Scotsman C. K. Scott Moncrieff under the title &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;, a phrase taken from Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnet 30; this was the first translation of the &quot;Recherche&quot; into another language. The individual volumes were &quot;Swann&#x27;s Way&quot;, in two books (1922), &quot;Within a Budding Grove&quot;, in two books (1924), &quot;The Guermantes Way&quot;, in two books (1925), &quot;Cities of the Plain&quot;, in two books (1927), &quot;The Captive&quot; (1929), and &quot;The Sweet Cheat Gone&quot; (1930). The final volume, &quot;Le Temps retrouvé&quot;, was initially published in English in the UK as &quot;Time Regained&quot; (1931), translated by Stephen Hudson (a pseudonym of Sydney Schiff), and in the US as &quot;The Past Recaptured&quot; (1932) in a translation by Frederick Blossom. There were thus eleven books in the original English translation. Although cordial with Scott Moncrieff, Proust grudgingly remarked in a letter that &quot;Remembrance&quot; eliminated the correspondence between &quot;Temps perdu&quot; and &quot;Temps retrouvé&quot; (Painter, 352). Terence Kilmartin revised the Scott Moncrieff translation in 1981, using the new French edition of 1954. An additional revision by D. J. Enright—that is, a revision of a revision—was published by the Modern Library in 1992. It is based on the &quot;La Pléiade&quot; edition of the French text (1987–89), and rendered the title of the novel more literally as &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;. It also includes an index/concordance to the novel compiled by Terence Kilmartin that was published in 1983 as the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Guide to the Remembrance of Things Past&quot;. The guide contains four indices: fictional characters from the novels; actual persons; places; and themes.

In 1995, Penguin undertook a fresh translation based on the &quot;La Pléiade&quot; French text (published in 1987–89) of &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; by a team of seven different translators overseen by editor Christopher Prendergast. The six volumes were published in Britain under the Allen Lane imprint in 2002, each volume under the name of a separate translator, the first volume being American writer Lydia Davis, and the others under English translators and one Australian, James Grieve. The first four volumes were published in the US under the Viking imprint as hardcover editions in 2003–2004, while the entire set is available in paperback under the Penguin Classics imprint.

Both the Modern Library and Penguin translations provide a detailed plot synopsis at the end of each volume. The last volume of the Modern Library edition, &quot;Time Regained&quot;, also includes Kilmartin&#x27;s &quot;A Guide to Proust&quot;, a set of four indexes covering the (fictional) characters, (real) persons, places (both real and fictional), and themes in the novel. The Modern Library volumes include a handful of endnotes, and alternative versions of some of the novel&#x27;s famous episodes. The Penguin volumes each provide an extensive set of brief, non-scholarly endnotes that help identify cultural references perhaps unfamiliar to contemporary English readers. Reviews that discuss the merits of both translations can be found online at the &quot;Observer&quot;, the &quot;Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;TempsPerdu.com&quot;, and Reading Proust.

Since 2013, Yale University Press has been publishing a new revision of Scott Moncrieff&#x27;s translation, edited and annotated by William C. Carter, at the rate of one volume every two or three years.

After a partial translation of the first volume in 2018, since 2023 Oxford University Press is publishing a new, complete translation, edited by Adam Watt.

*The British television series &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; (1969–1974) references the book and its author in two episodes. In the &quot;Fish Licence&quot; sketch, Mr. Praline mentions that Proust &quot;had an &#x27;addock&quot; as a pet fish, and warns, when his listener laughs, &quot;if you&#x27;re calling the author of &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot; a looney, I shall have to ask you to step outside!&quot; In another sketch entitled &quot;The All-England Summarize Proust Competition&quot;, contestants are required to summarize all of Proust&#x27;s seven volumes of the novel in 15 seconds.
*Science fiction author Gene Wolfe cited Proust as an influence, saying: &quot;Proust, of course, was obsessed with some of the same things I deal with in &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot; – memory and the way memory affects us.&quot; The opening line of his novella &quot;The Fifth Head of Cerberus&quot; is a paraphrase of the first sentence of &quot;Swann&#x27;s Way&quot;.

*In the third episode of the third season of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; (2001), Tony Soprano has a breakthrough about the role the smell of meat plays in triggering his panic attacks, which his therapist, Dr. Jennifer Melfi, likens to Proust&#x27;s madeleines.

<doc id="69922" wikidata="Q267558" url="?curid=69922" title="Original equipment manufacturer">
<text>An original equipment manufacturer (OEM) is a company that produces parts and equipment that may be marketed by another company. However, the term is ambiguous, with several other common meanings: an OEM can be the maker of a system that includes other companies&#x27; subsystems, an end-product producer, an automotive part that is manufactured by the same company that produced the original part used in the automobile&#x27;s assembly, or a value-added reseller.

== Automotive parts ==
When referring to auto parts, OEM typically refers to the manufacturer of the original equipment, that is, the parts which are then subsequently assembled and installed during the construction of a new vehicle. In contrast, aftermarket parts are those made by companies other than the OEM, which might be installed as replacements or enhancements after the car comes out of the factory. For example, if Ford used Autolite spark plugs, Exide batteries, Bosch fuel injectors, and Ford&#x27;s own engine blocks and heads when building a car, then car restorers and collectors consider those to be the OEM parts. 

Other-brand parts would be considered aftermarket, such as Champion spark plugs, DieHard batteries, Kinsler fuel injectors, and BMP engine blocks and heads. Many auto parts manufacturers sell parts through multiple channels, for example to car makers for installation during new-vehicle construction, to car makers for resale as automakerbranded replacement parts, and through general merchandising supply chains. Any given brand of part can be OEM on some vehicle models and aftermarket on others.

== Computer software ==
=== Windows ===
Microsoft is a popular example of a company that issues its Windows operating systems for use by OEM computer manufacturers via the bundling of Microsoft Windows. OEM product keys are priced lower than their retail counterparts, especially as they are purchased in bulk quantities, although they use the same software as retail versions of Windows. They are primarily for PC manufacturer OEMs and system builders, and as such are typically sold in volume licensing deals to a variety of manufacturers (Dell, HP, ASUS, Acer, Lenovo, Wistron, Inventec, Supermicro, Compal Electronics, Quanta Computer, Foxconn, Pegatron, Jabil, Flex, etc.). 

These OEMs commonly use a procedure known as System Locked Pre-installation, which pre-activates Windows on PCs that are to be sold via mass distribution. These OEMs also commonly bundle software that is not installed on stock Windows on the images of Windows that will be deployed with their PCs (appropriate hardware drivers, anti-malware and maintenance software, various apps, etc.).

Individuals may also purchase OEM &quot;system-builder&quot; licenses for personal use (to include virtual hardware), or for sale/resale on PCs which they build. Per Microsoft&#x27;s EULA regarding PC manufacturers and system-builder OEM licenses, the product key is tied to the PC motherboard which it is initially installed on, and there is &quot;typically&quot; no transferring the key between PCs afterward. This is in contrast to retail keys, which may be transferred, provided they are only activated on one PC at a time. A significant hardware change will trigger a reactivation notice, just as with retail.

Direct OEMs are officially held liable for things such as installation/recovery media, and as such were commonly provided until the late-2000s. These were phased out in favor of recovery partitions located on the primary storage drive of the PC (and available for order from the manufacturer upon request) for the user to repair or restore their systems to the factory state. This not only cut down on costs, but was also a consequence of the gradual obsolescence and phasing out of optical media from 2010 onward. System builders also have a different requirement regarding installation media from Direct OEMs. 

While a clean retail media of Windows can be installed and activated on these devices with OEM keys (most commonly using the SLP key that&#x27;s embedded in to the system firmware already), actual OEM recovery media that was created by the PC manufacturer (not system-builder, nor retail Windows versions) typically only works on the PC model line that was designed for it. For example, a recovery disc/USB for a Toshiba Satellite P50-B will only work on that model, and not a Satellite S55T.

=== Android ===
The OEM smartphone manufacturers, such as Samsung, Sony, Xiaomi, are manufacturers of hardware and software of smartphones. Such manufacturers are usually customize and build suitable Android operating system from Android Open Source Project, with manufacturer components such as One UI and MIUI.

== Skateboards ==
Skateboard decks are primarily produced by a small number of specialized OEMs, such as PS Stix, BBS, and Dwindle. These manufacturers handle the entire production process, including sourcing high-quality wood, crafting molds, gluing and pressing multiple layers of veneer, and applying graphics designed by the brands to the decks. Once completed, the finished products are distributed to skateboarding brands, which sell them under their respective labels.

==Economies of scale==

OEMs rely on their ability to drive down the cost of production through economies of scale. Using an OEM also allows the purchasing company to obtain needed components or products without owning and operating a factory.

<doc id="69923" wikidata="Q1494434" url="?curid=69923" title="Whodunit">
<text>A whodunit (less commonly spelled as &quot;whodunnit&quot;; a colloquial elision of &quot;Who [has] done it?&quot;) is a complex plot-driven variety of detective fiction in which the puzzle regarding who committed the crime is the main focus. The reader or viewer is provided with the clues to the case, from which the identity of the may be deduced before the story provides the revelation itself at its climax. The investigation is usually conducted by an eccentric, amateur, or semi-professional detective.

== Concept ==
A whodunit follows the paradigm of the traditional detective story in the sense that it presents crime as a puzzle to be solved through a chain of questions that the detective poses. In a whodunit, however, the audience is given the opportunity to engage in the same process of deduction as the protagonist throughout the investigation of a crime. This engages the readers so that they strive to compete with or outguess the expert investigator.

A defining feature of the whodunit narrative is the so-called double narrative. Here, one narrative is hidden and gradually revealed while the other is the open narrative, which often transpires in the present time of the story. This feature has been associated with the Russian literary terms &quot;syuzhet&quot; and fabula. The former involves the narrative presented to the reader by the author or the actual story as it happened in chronological order while the latter focuses on the underlying substance or material of the narrative. 

The double narrative has a deep structure but is specific, particularly when it comes to time and a split gaze on the narrative itself. The two tales coexist and interweave with the first tale focusing on the crime itself, what led to it, and the investigation to solve it while the second story is all about the reconstruction of the crime. Here, the &quot;diegesis&quot;, or the way the characters live on the inquiry level creates the phantom narration where the objects, bodies, and words become signs for both the detective and the reader to interpret and draw their conclusions from. For instance, in a detective novel, solving a mystery entails the reconstruction of the criminal events. This process, however, also involves on the part of the detective the production of a hypothesis that could withstand scrutiny, including the crafting of findings about cause and motive as well as crime and its intended consequences. This discourse of explanation constitutes the second narrative besides the primary story relating to the crime.

The double narrative is cited as a main distinguishing element between the whodunit and the thriller. The whodunit goes backward as it goes forward, reconstructing the timeline of both crime and investigation, while the thriller coincides with the action in a single story. According to Tzvetan Todorov, in terms of temporal logic, the whodunit narrative is considered a paradigm for fiction in general because the story unfolds in relation not to a future event but one that is already known and merely lying in wait. Such certainty pertains to the crime and not to the identity of the culprit, who the reader must anticipate as part of the unknown future.

This narrative development has been seen as a form of comedy, in which order is restored to a threatened social calm.

==History==
According to , the term &quot;WhoDunIt&quot; was coined by &quot;News of Books&quot; reviewer Donald Gordon in 1930, in his review of the detective novel &quot;Half-Mast Murder&quot; written by Milward Kennedy. Journalist Wolfe Kaufman claimed that he coined the word &quot;whodunit&quot; around 1935 while working for &quot;Variety&quot; magazine. However, an editor of the magazine, Abel Green, attributed it to his predecessor, Sime Silverman. The earliest appearance of the word &quot;whodunit&quot; in &quot;Variety&quot; occurs in the edition of August 28, 1934, in reference to a film adaptation of the play &quot;Recipe for Murder,&quot; as featured in the headline, &quot;U&#x27;s Whodunit: Universal is shooting &#x27;Recipe for Murder,&#x27; Arnold Ridley&#x27;s play&quot;. The film was eventually titled &quot;Blind Justice&quot;.

The &quot;whodunit&quot; flourished during the so-called &quot;Golden Age of Detective Fiction&quot;, between the First and Second World Wars, when it was the predominant mode of crime writing. Many of the best-known writers of whodunits in this period were British – notably Agatha Christie, Nicholas Blake, G. K. Chesterton, Christianna Brand, Edmund Crispin, Michael Innes, Dorothy L. Sayers, Gladys Mitchell and Josephine Tey. Others – S. S. Van Dine, John Dickson Carr and Ellery Queen – were American, but imitated the &quot;British&quot; style. Still others, such as Rex Stout, Clayton Rawson and Earl Derr Biggers, attempted a more &quot;American&quot; style. During the Golden Age, the genre was dominated by female authors. In addition to Christie, Brand, Sayers, Mitchell, and Tey, major writers also included Margery Allingham and Ngaio Marsh. 

Over time, certain conventions and clichés developed which limited surprise on the part of the reader – vis-à-vis details of the plot – the identity of the murderer. Several authors excelled, after successfully misleading their readers, in revealing an unlikely suspect as the real villain of the story. They often had a predilection for certain casts of characters and settings, with the secluded English country house at the top of the list.

One reaction to the conventionality of British murder mysteries was American &quot;hard-boiled&quot; crime fiction, epitomized by the writings of Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and Mickey Spillane, among others. Though the settings were grittier, the violence more abundant and the style more colloquial, plots were, as often as not, whodunits constructed in much the same way as the &quot;cozier&quot; British mysteries.

== Games ==

The 1935 commercial parlour game &quot;Jury Box&quot; sees the players cast as jurors who are given the scenario of the murder, the evidence presented by the prosecutor and defendant, two photographs of the crime scene and ballot papers. Players are challenged to make the decision as to who is guilty, before a real solution is read out.

The 1948 board game &quot;Cluedo&quot;, released as &quot;Clue&quot; in North America, was the first murder mystery board game, and sees players as visitors in a mansion, attempting to identify a killer whose identity is recorded on a hidden card.

A murder mystery game is a form of live-action &quot;whodunit&quot; experience, where guests at a private party are given notes to perform the roles of the suspects, detective and murderer over the course of an evening. There are a number of murder mystery dinner theaters, where either professional or community theatre performers take on those roles, and present the murder mystery to an audience, usually in conjunction with a meal. Typically before or immediately following the final course, the audience is given a chance to offer their help in solving the mystery.

==Use and Variations==

===Howdunnit===

An important variation on the whodunit is the inverted detective story (also referred to as a &quot;howcatchem&quot; or &quot;howdunnit&quot;) in which the guilty party and the crime are openly revealed to the reader/audience and the story follows the investigator&#x27;s efforts to find out the truth while the criminal attempts to prevent it. The &quot;Columbo&quot; TV movie series is the classic example of this kind of detective story (&quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; and &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot; also fit into this genre). This tradition dates back to the inverted detective stories of R Austin Freeman, and reached an apotheosis of sorts in &quot;Malice Aforethought&quot; written by Francis Iles (a pseudonym of Anthony Berkeley). In the same vein is Iles&#x27;s &quot;Before the Fact&quot; (1932), which became the Hitchcock movie &quot;Suspicion&quot;. Successors of the psychological suspense novel include Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s &quot;This Sweet Sickness&quot; (1960), Simon Brett&#x27;s &quot;A Shock to the System&quot; (1984), and Stephen Dobyns&#x27;s &quot;The Church of Dead Girls&quot; (1997).

===Parody and spoof===
In addition to standard humor, parody, spoof, and pastiche have had a long tradition within the field of crime fiction. Examples of pastiche are the Sherlock Holmes stories written by John Dickson Carr, and hundreds of similar works by such authors as E. B. Greenwood. As for parody, the first Sherlock Holmes spoofs appeared shortly after Conan Doyle published his first stories. Similarly, there have been innumerable Agatha Christie send-ups. The idea is to exaggerate and mock the most noticeable features of the original and, by doing so, amuse especially those readers who are also familiar with that original.

There are also &quot;reversal&quot; mysteries, in which the conventional structure is deliberately inverted. One of the earliest examples of this is &quot;Trent&#x27;s Last Case&quot; (1914) by E. C. Bentley (1875–1956). Trent, a very able amateur detective, investigates the murder of Sigsbee Manderson. He finds many important clues, exposes several false clues, and compiles a seemingly unassailable case against a suspect. He then learns that that suspect cannot be a murderer, and that while he found nearly all of the truth, his conclusion is wrong. Then, at the end of the novel, another character tells Trent that he always knew the other suspect was innocent, because &quot;I shot Manderson myself.&quot; These are Trent&#x27;s final words to the killer:

Another example of a spoof, which at the same time shows that the borderline between serious mystery and its parody is necessarily blurred, is U.S. mystery writer Lawrence Block&#x27;s novel &quot;The Burglar in the Library&quot; (1997). The burglar of the title is Bernie Rhodenbarr, who has booked a weekend at an English-style country house just to steal a signed, and therefore very valuable, first edition of Chandler&#x27;s &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, which he knows has been sitting there on one of the shelves for more than half a century. Alas, immediately after his arrival a dead body turns up in the library, the room is sealed off, and Rhodenbarr has to track down the murderer before he can enter the library again and start hunting for the precious book.

&quot;Murder by Death&quot; is Neil Simon&#x27;s spoof of many of the best-known whodunit sleuths and their sidekicks. In the 1976 film, Sam Spade (from &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;) becomes Sam Diamond, Hercule Poirot becomes Milo Perrier, and so on. The characters are all gathered in a large country house and given clues to solve the mystery.

Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;The Real Inspector Hound&quot; is a send-up of crime fiction novels and features a bumbling detective.

The 2019 film &quot;Knives Out&quot; is a modern take on the classic &quot;whodunit&quot; by deconstructing the narrative form and adds a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor.

===Homicide investigation===
The term &quot;whodunit&quot; is also used among homicide investigators to describe a case in which the identity of the killer is not quickly apparent. Since most homicides are committed by people with whom the victim is acquainted or related, a whodunit case is usually more difficult to solve.

<doc id="69925" wikidata="Q569687" url="?curid=69925" title="Ansfried of Utrecht">
<text>Saint Ansfried (alsoAnsfrid, Ansfridus) of Utrecht sometimes called Ansfried the younger (died 3 May 1010 near Leusden) was Count of Huy and the sword-bearer for Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor. He became Bishop of Utrecht in 995. He appears to have been the son or grandson of Lambert, a nobleman of the Maasgau, the area where he later founded the Abbey of Thorn. He also appears to have been related to various important contemporaries including the royal family.

==Life==
The principal source of information regarding Ansfried is the &quot;De diversitatem temporum&quot; by the Benedictine Albert of Metz, written around 1022.

Ansfried had the same name as a paternal uncle (&quot;patruus&quot;), Ansfried the elder, a count who supposedly held 15 counties. The young Ansfried studied secular and clerical subjects under another paternal uncle, Robert, Archbishop of Trier, before attending the cathedral school at Cologne. 

In 961, Otto I took Ansfried into his personal service and made him his swordbearer. When Otto was in Rome the following year to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor, he directed Ansfried to keep close at hand with the sword as a precaution against any unforeseen eventualities. Karl Leyser describes this as a valuable lesson in practicality.

Because of his Christian commitment, he was highly respected and an important knight of the emperor&#x27;s circle, holding rich possessions along the Meuse, in Brabant and Gelderland. Possibly all or some of his counties were inherited from his paternal uncle of the same name. As Count, he had considerable success in suppressing piracy and armed robbery. In 985, Otto III granted Ansfried the right to mint coins at Medemblik, on the north-south shipping route through the Vlie, as well as, the income from tolls and tax collecting.

He was married to Heresuint or Hilsondis. They had one child, Benedicta. He founded a Romanesque abbey church on his wife&#x27;s estate at Thorn under the patronage of St. Michael. The abbey itself had a double cloister that housed both men and women. Ansfried planned it as a place of retirement for himself and his family after he left public service. Under his control, the abbey and lands, of about 1.5 square kilometers, was reichsunmittel, making it subject only to the Emperor. Hereswitha was to be the first abbess but died on her way there; and Benedicta took her place.

After his wife&#x27;s death, Ansfried wanted to become a monk. However, in 995, Emperor Otto III and Bishop Notker of Liège persuaded the reluctant Ansfried to assume the then vacant see of Utrecht. Ansfried objected that as he had borne weapons as a knight, he was unworthy of the office, but the emperor prevailed. The elderly count laid down his sword on the altar of Saint Mary in Aachen and was ordained priest and consecrated eighteenth Bishop of Utrecht in the same ceremony. Bishop Ansfried never took a commission in the royal army, in contrast to Notger and the Bishop of Cologne.

In 1006 Bishop Ansfried founded the abbey of Heiligenberg, also under the patronage of Saint Michael. Toward the end of his life he became increasingly weakened through fasting, and retired there as a monk, caring for the sick, although almost blind himself.

Upon his death, townsfolk from Heiligenberg took possession of his body, while the people of Utrecht were extinguishing a not coincidental fire. The abbess of Thorn mediated and Ansfried was buried in the Cathedral of Saint Martin in Utrecht.

==Veneration==
His feast day was 3 May but was later moved to 11 May.

===Patronage===
St. Ansfried is the patron saint of Amersfoort.

===Iconography===
Ansfried is portrayed holding a small church building (as a founder); as a knight with weapons at his feet, because he renounced the knighthood; with a bishop&#x27;s miter and staff; or as a Benedictine monk.

<doc id="69926" wikidata="Q466220" url="?curid=69926" title="Pauline Hanson">
<text>Pauline Lee Hanson (&quot;née&quot; Seccombe, formerly Zagorski; born 27 May 1954) is an Australian politician who is the founder and leader of One Nation, a right-wing populist political party. Hanson has represented Queensland in the Australian Senate since the 2016 Federal Election.

Hanson ran a fish and chip shop before entering politics in 1994 as a member of Ipswich City Council in her home state. She joined the Liberal Party of Australia in 1995 and was preselected for the Division of Oxley in Brisbane at the 1996 federal election. She was disendorsed shortly before the election after making contentious comments about Aboriginal Australians, but remained listed as a Liberal on the ballot paper. Hanson won the election and took her seat as an independent, before co-founding One Nation in 1997 and becoming its only MP. She attempted to switch to the Division of Blair at the 1998 federal election but was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, her newly formed party experienced a surge in popularity at the 1998 Queensland state election, garnering the second-highest number of votes of any party in the state.

After her defeat in 1998, Hanson unsuccessfully contested the 2001 election as the leader of One Nation but was expelled from the party in 2002. A District Court jury found Hanson guilty of electoral fraud in 2003, but her convictions were later overturned by three judges on the Queensland Court of Appeal. She spent 11 weeks in jail prior to the appeal being heard.

Following her release, Hanson ran in several state and federal elections, as the leader of Pauline Hanson&#x27;s United Australia Party and as an independent before rejoining One Nation in 2013 and becoming leader again the following year. She was narrowly defeated at the 2015 Queensland state election, but was elected to the Senate at the 2016 federal election, along with three other members of the party. She was re-elected at the 2022 federal election.

==Early life and career==
Hanson was born Pauline Lee Seccombe on 27 May 1954 in Woolloongabba, Queensland. She was the fifth of seven children (and the youngest daughter) to John Alfred &quot;Jack&quot; Seccombe and Hannorah Alousius Mary &quot;Norah&quot; Seccombe (née Webster). She first received schooling at Buranda Girls&#x27; School, later attending Coorparoo State School in Coorparoo until she ended her education at age 15, shortly before her first marriage and pregnancy.

Jack and Norah Seccombe owned a fish and chip shop in Ipswich, Queensland, in which Hanson and her siblings worked from a young age, preparing meals and taking orders. At an older age, she assisted her parents with more administrative work in bookkeeping and sales ledgering.

Hanson worked at Woolworths before working in the office administration of Taylors Elliotts Ltd, a subsidiary of Drug Houses of Australia (now Bickford&#x27;s Australia), where she handled clerical bookkeeping and secretarial work. She left Taylors Elliotts during her first pregnancy.

In 1978, Hanson (then Pauline Zagorski) met Mark Hanson, a tradesman on Queensland&#x27;s Gold Coast. They married in 1980 and established a construction business specialising in roof plumbing. Hanson handled the administrative components of the company, similar to her work with Taylors Elliotts, while her husband dealt with practical labour. In 1987, the couple divorced and the company was liquidated. She moved back to Ipswich and worked as a barmaid at what was then Booval Bowls Club. Hanson then bought a fish and chip shop with a new business partner Morrie Marsden. They established Marsden Hanson Pty Ltd and began operations from their recently opened fish and chip shop in Silkstone, a suburb of Ipswich. Hanson and Marsden both shared the administrative responsibilities of the company, but Hanson took on additional practical responsibilities, including buying supplies and produce for the shop and preparing the food, which was among many things that contributed to her notoriety during her first political campaign. Over time, Hanson acquired full control of the company, which was sold upon her election to Parliament in 1996.

==Political career==
===Entry into politics===
Hanson&#x27;s first election to office was in 1994, earning a seat on the Ipswich City Council, on the premise of an opposition to extra funding. She held the seat for 11 months, before being removed in 1995 due to administrative changes.

In August 1995, she joined the Liberal Party of Australia and in 1996 was endorsed as the Liberal candidate for the House of Representatives seat of Oxley, based on Ipswich, for the March 1996 Federal election. At the time, the seat was thought of as a Labor stronghold. The Labor incumbent, Les Scott, held it with an almost 15% two-party majority, making it the safest Labor seat in Queensland. Because of this, Hanson was initially dismissed and ignored by the media believing that she had no chance of winning the seat. However, Hanson received widespread media attention when, leading up to the election, she advocated the abolition of special government assistance for Aboriginal Australians, and she was disendorsed by the Liberal Party. Ballot papers had already been printed listing Hanson as the Liberal candidate, and the Australian Electoral Commission had closed nominations for the seat. As a result, Hanson was still listed as the Liberal candidate when votes were cast, even though Liberal leader John Howard had declared she would not be allowed to sit with the Liberals if elected. On election night, Hanson took a large lead on the first count and picked up enough Democrat preferences to defeat Scott on the sixth count. Her victory came amid Labor&#x27;s near-meltdown in Queensland which saw it cut down to only two seats in the state. Hanson won 54 percent of the two-candidate preferred vote. Had she still been running as a Liberal, the 19.3-point swing would have been the largest two-party swing of the election. Since Hanson had been disendorsed, she entered parliament as an independent.

====1996 Maiden speech====
On 10 September 1996, Hanson gave her maiden speech to the House of Representatives, which was widely reported in the media. In her opening lines, Hanson said: &quot;I won the seat of Oxley largely on an issue that has resulted in me being called a racist. That issue related to my comment that Aboriginals received more benefits than non-Aboriginals&quot;. Hanson then asserted that Australia was in danger of being &quot;swamped by Asians&quot;, and that these immigrants &quot;have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate&quot;. Hanson argued that &quot;mainstream Australians&quot; were instead subject to &quot;a type of reverse racism ... by those who promote political correctness and those who control the various taxpayer funded &#x27;industries&#x27; that flourish in our society servicing Aboriginals, multiculturalists and a host of other minority groups&quot;. This theme continued with the assertion that &quot;present governments are encouraging separatism in Australia by providing opportunities, land, moneys and facilities available only to Aboriginals&quot;.

Among a series of criticisms of Aboriginal land rights, access to welfare and reconciliation, Hanson criticised the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), saying: &quot;Anyone with a criminal record can, and does, hold a position with ATSIC&quot;. There then followed a short series of statements on family breakdown, youth unemployment, international debt, the Family Law Act, child support, and the privatisation of Qantas and other national enterprises. The speech also included an attack on immigration and multiculturalism, a call for the return of high-tariff protectionism, and criticism of economic rationalism. Her speech was delivered uninterrupted by her fellow parliamentarians as it was the courtesy given to MPs delivering their maiden speeches.

==== 1997 Establishment of One Nation====

In February 1997, Hanson, David Oldfield and David Ettridge founded the Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation political party. Disenchanted rural voters attended her meetings in regional centres across Australia as she consolidated a support base for the new party. An opinion poll in May of that year indicated that the party was attracting the support of 9 per cent of Australian voters and that its popularity was primarily at the expense of the Liberal Party-National Party Coalition&#x27;s base.

Hanson&#x27;s presence in the suburb of Dandenong, Victoria, to launch her party was met with demonstrations on 7 July 1997, with 3,000–5,000 people rallying outside. A silent vigil and multicultural concert was organised by the Greater Dandenong City Council in response to Hanson&#x27;s presence, while a demonstration was organised by an anti-racism body. The majority of attendees were of Asian origin, where an open platform attracted leaders of the Vietnamese, Chinese, East Timorese and Sri Lankan communities. Representatives from churches, local community groups, lesbian and gay and socialist organisations also attended and addressed the crowd.

In its late 1990s incarnation, One Nation called for zero net immigration, an end to multiculturalism and a revival of Australia&#x27;s Anglo-Celtic cultural tradition which it says has been diminished, the abolition of native title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), an end to special Aboriginal funding programs, opposition to Aboriginal reconciliation which the party says will create two nations, and a review of the 1967 constitutional referendum which gave the Commonwealth power to legislate for Aborigines. The party&#x27;s economic position was to support protectionism and trade retaliation, increased restrictions on foreign capital and the flow of capital overseas, and a general reversal of globalisation&#x27;s influence on the Australian economy. Domestically, One Nation opposed privatisation, competition policy, and the GST, while proposing a government subsidised people&#x27;s bank to provide 2 per cent loans to farmers, small business, and manufacturers. On foreign policy, One Nation called for a review of Australia&#x27;s United Nations membership, a repudiation of Australia&#x27;s UN treaties, an end to foreign aid and to ban foreigners from owning Australian land.

===1998 re-election campaign===
In 1999, &quot;The Australian&quot; reported that support for One Nation had fallen from 22% to 5%. One Nation Senate candidate Lenny Spencer blamed the press together with party director David Oldfield for the October 1998 election defeat, while the media reported the redirecting of preferences away from One Nation as the primary reason, with a lack of party unity, poor policy choices and an &quot;inability to work with the media&quot; also responsible.

Ahead of the 1998 federal election, an electoral redistribution essentially split Oxley in half. Oxley was reconfigured as a marginal Labor seat, losing most of its more rural and exurban area while picking up the heavily pro-Labor suburb of Inala. A new seat of Blair was created in the rural area surrounding Ipswich. Hanson knew her chances of holding the reconfigured Oxley were slim, especially after former Labor state premier Wayne Goss won preselection for the seat. After considering whether to contest a Senate seat—which, by most accounts, she would have been heavily tipped to win—she opted to contest Blair. Despite its very large notional Liberal majority (18.7 percent), most of her base was now located there.

Hanson launched her 1998 election campaign with a focus on jobs, rather than a focus on race/ethnicity or on &quot;the people&quot; against &quot;the elites&quot;. Instead Hanson focused on unemployment and the need to create more jobs not through government schemes but by &quot;cheap loans to business, by more apprenticeships, and by doing something about tariffs&quot;.

Hanson won 36 percent of the primary vote, slightly over 10% more than the second-place Labor candidate, Virginia Clarke. However, with all three major parties preferencing each other ahead of Hanson, Liberal candidate Cameron Thompson was able to win the seat despite finishing in third place on the first count. Thompson overtook Clarke on National preferences and defeated Hanson on Labor preferences. It has been suggested by Thompson that Hanson&#x27;s litigation against parodist Pauline Pantsdown was a distraction from the election which contributed to her loss.

Nationally, One Nation gained 8.99 percent of the Senate vote and 8.4% of the Representatives vote, but only one MP was elected – Len Harris as a Senator for Queensland. Heather Hill had been elected to this position, but the High Court of Australia ruled that, although she was an Australian citizen, she was ineligible for election to sit as a Senator because she had not renounced her British citizenship. The High Court found that, at least since 1986, Britain had counted as a &#x27;foreign power&#x27; within the meaning of section 44(i) of the Constitution. Hanson alleged in her 2007 autobiography &quot;Pauline Hanson: Untamed &amp; Unashamed&quot; that a number of other politicians had dual citizenship yet this did not prevent them from holding positions in Parliament.

In 1998, Tony Abbott had established a trust fund called &quot;Australians for Honest Politics Trust&quot; to help bankroll civil court cases against the One Nation Party and Hanson herself. John Howard denied any knowledge of the existence of such a fund. Abbott was also accused of offering funds to One Nation dissident Terry Sharples to support his court battle against the party. However, Howard defended the honesty of Abbott in this matter. Abbott conceded that the political threat One Nation posed to the Howard Government was &quot;a very big factor&quot; in his decision to pursue the legal attack, but he also said he was acting &quot;in Australia&#x27;s national interest&quot;. Howard also defended Abbott&#x27;s actions saying &quot;It&#x27;s the job of the Liberal Party to politically attack other parties – there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.&quot;

===Time in office===
Hanson gained extensive media coverage during her campaign and once she took her seat in the House. Her first speech attracted considerable attention for the views it expressed on Aboriginal benefits, welfare, immigration and multiculturalism. During her term in Parliament, Hanson spoke on social and economic issues such as the need for a fairer child support scheme and concern for the emergence of the working class poor. She also called for more accountable and effective administration of Indigenous affairs. Hanson&#x27;s supporters viewed her as an ordinary person who challenged &#x27;political correctness&#x27; as a threat to Australia&#x27;s identity.

The reaction of the mainstream political parties was negative, with parliament passing a resolution (supported by all members except Graeme Campbell) condemning her views on immigration and multiculturalism. However, the Prime Minister at the time, John Howard, refused to censure Hanson or speak critically about her, acknowledging that her views were shared by many Australians, commenting that he saw the expression of such views as evidence that the &quot;pall of political correctness&quot; had been lifted in Australia, and that Australians could now &quot;speak a little more freely and a little more openly about what they feel&quot;.

Hanson immediately labelled Howard a &quot;strong leader&quot; and said Australians were now free to discuss issues without &quot;fear of being branded as a bigot or racist&quot;. Over the next few months, Hanson attracted populist anti-immigration sentiment and the attention of the Citizens&#x27; Electoral Council, the Australian League of Rights and other right-wing groups. Then-Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock announced a tougher government line on refugee applications, and cut the family reunion intake by 10,000, despite an election promise to maintain immigration levels. Various academic experts, business leaders and several state premiers attacked the justification offered by Ruddock, who had claimed that the reduction had been forced by continuing high unemployment. Various ethnic communities complained that this attack on multiculturalism was a cynical response to polls showing Hanson&#x27;s rising popularity. Hanson herself claimed credit for forcing the government&#x27;s hand.

===2001 election campaign===

At the next federal election on 10 November 2001, Hanson ran for a Queensland senate seat but narrowly failed. She accounted for her declining popularity by claiming that the Liberals under John Howard had stolen her policies.
&quot;It has been widely recognised by all, including the media, that John Howard sailed home on One Nation policies. In short, if we were not around, John Howard would not have made the decisions he did.&quot;

Other interrelated factors that contributed to her political decline from 1998 to 2002 include her connection with a series of advisors with whom she ultimately fell out (John Pasquarelli, David Ettridge and David Oldfield); disputes amongst her supporters; and a lawsuit over the organisational structure of One Nation.

In 2003, following her release from prison, Hanson unsuccessfully contested the New South Wales state election, running for a seat in the upper house. In January 2004, Hanson announced that she did not intend to return to politics. but then stood as an independent candidate for one of Queensland&#x27;s seats in the Senate in the 2004 federal election. At the time, Hanson declared, &quot;I don&#x27;t want all the hangers on. I don&#x27;t want the advisers and everyone else. I want it to be this time Pauline Hanson.&quot; She was unsuccessful, receiving only 31.77% of the required quota of primary votes, and did not pick up enough additional support through preferences. However, she attracted more votes than the One Nation party (4.54% compared to 3.14%) and, unlike her former party, recovered her deposit from the Australian Electoral Commission and secured $150,000 of public electoral funding. Hanson claimed to have been vilified over campaign funding.

Hanson contested the electoral district of Beaudesert as an independent at the 2009 Queensland state election. After an election campaign dominated by discussion over hoax photographs, she was placed third behind the Liberal National Party&#x27;s Aidan McLindon and Labor&#x27;s Brett McCreadie. There were conflicting media reports as to whether she had said she would not consider running again.

On 23 July 2010, while at an event promoting her new career as a motivational speaker, Hanson expressed interest in returning to the political stage as a Liberal candidate if an invitation were to be offered by the leader Tony Abbott in the 2010 federal election. No such offer was made.

===Rattnergate scandal===
In March 2011, Hanson ran as an independent candidate for the New South Wales Legislative Council in the 2011 state election, but was not elected, receiving 2.41 percent of the primary statewide vote but losing on preferences. Following the election, Hanson alleged that &quot;dodgy staff&quot; employed by the NSW Electoral Commission put 1,200 votes for her in a pile of blank ballots, and she claimed that she had a forwarded NSW Electoral Commission internal email as evidence of this. Hanson then commenced legal proceedings to challenge the outcome of the election in the NSW Supreme Court, which sat as the Court of Disputed Returns.

From the start of proceedings, the NSW Electoral Commissioner maintained the view that Hanson&#x27;s claims lacked substance. The man who alerted Hanson to the alleged emails, who identified himself as &quot;Michael Rattner&quot;, failed to appear in court on 8 June 2011 &quot;Rattner&quot; was revealed to be Shaun Castle, a history teacher who posed as a journalist to obtain embargoed progressive poll results.

&quot;Michael Rattner&quot; was a pun on Mickey Mouse and reports linked the pseudonym to an &quot;anti-voter-fraud&quot; organisation led by Amy McGrath and Alasdair Webster.

After having refused to answer questions on the grounds of self-incrimination, Castle apologised to the court and was granted protection from prosecution by Justice McClellan, before being compelled to answer questions relating to the fraudulent email. The judge ordered that Hanson&#x27;s legal costs of more than $150,000 be paid by the State of New South Wales – a move which outraged Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham, who would have been replaced by Hanson had her challenge been successful. Questioning whether Hanson&#x27;s legal action should have gone ahead at all given the nature of the evidence, Buckingham said that &quot;This lack of judgement shows that she&#x27;s unfit for public office.&quot; Earlier, the judge, Justice McClellan, said Hanson had no other remedy but to take legal action after receiving the fraudulent email.

===Ousted from One Nation, forming a new party===

At the 1999 election, One Nation politician David Oldfield was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council, the state parliament&#x27;s upper house. However, in 2000, Oldfield was expelled from One Nation for an alleged verbal dispute with Hanson. Within weeks, Oldfield had established the splinter group, One Nation NSW.

One Nation won three seats in the Western Australian Legislative Council at the 2001 state election, but the electoral success of One Nation began to deteriorate after this point because the split-away of One Nation NSW began to spark further lack of party unity, and a series of gaffes by One Nation members and candidates, particularly in Queensland.

Hanson resigned from One Nation in January 2002 and John Fischer, the State Leader from Western Australia, was elected the Federal President of One Nation.

On 24 May 2007, Hanson launched Pauline&#x27;s United Australia Party. Under that banner, Hanson again contested one of Queensland&#x27;s seats in the Senate in the 2007 federal election, when she received over 4 percent of total votes. The party name invokes that of the historic United Australia Party. Speaking on her return to politics, she stated: &quot;I have had all the major political parties attack me, been kicked out of my own party and ended up in prison, but I don&#x27;t give up.&quot; In October 2007, Hanson launched her campaign song, entitled &quot;Australian Way of Life&quot;, which included the line: &quot;Welcome everyone, no matter where you come from.&quot;

After an unsuccessful campaign in the 2009 Queensland state election, Hanson announced in 2010 that she planned to deregister Pauline&#x27;s United Australia Party, sell her Queensland house and move to the United Kingdom. The announcement was warmly welcomed by Nick Griffin, leader of the far-right British National Party (BNP). When considering moving, Hanson said that she would not sell her house to Muslims. However, following an extended holiday in Europe, Hanson said in November 2010 that she had decided not to move to Britain because it was &quot;overrun with immigrants and refugees.&quot; Hanson lives in Beaudesert, Queensland.

===Return as One Nation leader (2013–present)===
In 2013, Hanson announced that she would stand in the 2013 federal election. She rejoined the One Nation party and was a Senate candidate in New South Wales. She did not win a seat, attracting 1.22% of the first preference vote.

In November 2014, Hanson announced that she had returned as One Nation leader, prior to the party&#x27;s announcement, following support from One Nation party members. She announced that she would contest the seat of Lockyer in the 2015 Queensland state election. One Nation held the Queensland seat of Lockyer from 1998 to 2004. In February 2015, Hanson lost the seat by a narrow margin.

====First Senate term (2016–2022)====
In mid-2015, Hanson announced that she would contest the Senate for Queensland at the 2016 federal election, and also announced the endorsement of several other candidates throughout Australia. She campaigned on a tour she called &quot;Fed Up&quot; in 2015, and spoke at a Reclaim Australia rally. Hanson won a seat in the Senate at the election, and One Nation won 9% of the vote in Queensland. According to the rules governing the allocation of Senate seats following a double dissolution, Hanson served a full six-year term. Hanson secured a spot on the National Broadband Network parliamentary committee.

After being elected to the parliament, she and other One Nation senators voted with the governing Coalition on a number of welfare cuts, and usually supports the government.

On 17 August 2017, Hanson received criticism after wearing a burqa, which she claims &quot;oppresses women&quot;, into the Senate. Attorney-General George Brandis got a standing ovation from Labor and Greens senators after he gave an &quot;emotional&quot; speech saying to Hanson: &quot;To ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments is an appalling thing to do.&quot; Following the incident, polling found that 57% of Australians supported Hanson&#x27;s call to ban the burka in public places, with 44% &quot;strongly&quot; supporting a ban. In August 2017, the party&#x27;s constitution was changed, for Hanson to become party President for as long as she may wish and to choose her successor, who may also continue until resignation.

On 22 March 2018, Hanson announced that One Nation would back the Turnbull government&#x27;s corporate tax cuts. She subsequently reversed her position, citing the failure of the government to cut immigration levels and support coal-fired power.

On 15 October 2018, Hanson proposed an &quot;It&#x27;s OK to be white&quot; motion in the Australian Senate intended to acknowledge the &quot;deplorable rise of anti-white racism and attacks on Western civilization&quot;. It was supported by most senators from the governing Liberal-National Coalition, but was defeated 31–28 by opponents who called it a racist slogan from the white supremacist movement. The following day, the motion was &quot;recommitted&quot;, and this time rejected unanimously by senators in attendance, with its initial supporters in the Liberal-National Coalition saying they had voted for it due to an administrative error (One Nation did not attend the recommital vote).

On 18 September 2019, the Liberal government announced that Hanson would co-chair the newly announced parliamentary inquiry into family law along with Kevin Andrews. She proposed a parliament motion advocating opposition to the proposed Great Reset of the World Economic Forum, on the belief that it is cover for creating a New World Order. Her proposal was defeated by 37 votes to 2.

In 2019, Hanson campaigned against a ban on climbing Uluru, a sacred site for local Aboriginal people. Shortly before the ban came into effect, in August Channel Nine paid for Hanson&#x27;s trip to Uluru and on their &quot;A Current Affair&quot; program she was shown in a controversial episode climbing the rock.

Beginning in May 2019, Hanson was a regular contributor on Channel Nine&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show. She was removed from the role in July 2020 after describing people who lived in Melbourne public housing as drug addicts who couldn&#x27;t speak English.

Following the 2019 federal election, One Nation obtained $2.8 million in electoral expenses from the Australian Electoral Commission. Later, the Commission required One Nation to repay $165,442 as money that had not been spent or not spent for electoral purposes. In addition, it is reported: &quot;Hanson has personally agreed to an enforceable undertaking. And the party must in future make sure all invoices are in Hanson’s name, the party’s name or the name of a party officer. And make sure that all invoices match payment receipts, credit card or bank statements.&quot;

In June 2021, following media reports that the proposed national curriculum was &quot;preoccupied with the oppression, discrimination and struggles of Indigenous Australians&quot;, the Australian Senate approved a motion tabled by Hanson calling on the federal government to reject Critical race theory CRT, despite it not being included in the curriculum.

====Second Senate term (2022–present)====
In July 2022, the Senate opened with the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and a Acknowledgement of Country, as normal. The ceremony includes the words: &quot;[the Parliament] recognises the Ngunnawal and Ngambri peoples as the traditional custodians of the Canberra meetings, and pays respects to elders past, present and emerging.&quot; Despite having sat through the ceremony many times before, this time Hanson stormed out of the chamber, yelling &quot;No I don&#x27;t, and I never will!&quot;

Hanson later stated that her opposition was to a motion that the Aboriginal flag and Torres Strait Islander flag, which are both official flags of Australia, should be raised inside the Senate chamber alongside the Australian flag.

==Racial views==
Despite Hanson&#x27;s repeated denials of charges of racism, her views on race, immigration, and Islam have been discussed widely in Australia. In her maiden speech to Parliament in 1996, Hanson appealed to economically disadvantaged white Australians by expressing dissatisfaction with government policy on indigenous affairs. Following Hanson&#x27;s maiden speech her views received negative coverage across Asian news media in 1996, and Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer criticised the race &quot;debate&quot; initiated by Hanson, saying it was putting Australian exports and jobs at risk. Other ministers and state and territory leaders followed Fischer&#x27;s lead in criticising Hanson.

In 1998, the resurgence of popularity of Hanson was met with disappointment in Asian media. Her resignation from politics in 2002 was met with support from academics, politicians and the press across Asia. In 2004, Hanson appeared on the nationally televised ABC interview show &quot;Enough Rope&quot; where her views were challenged.

===Policies===
====Anti-immigration and anti-multiculturalism====
In her maiden speech, Hanson proposed a drastic reduction in immigration with particular reference to immigrants from Asia. Hanson criticised the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). Condemning multiculturalism, One Nation has railed against government immigration and multicultural policies.

After Hanson was elected to Parliament in 1996, journalist Tracey Curro asked her on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; whether she was xenophobic. Hanson replied, &quot;Please explain?&quot; This response became a much-parodied catchphrase within Australian culture and was included in the title of the 2016 SBS documentary film &quot;Pauline Hanson: Please Explain!&quot;.

In 2006, Hanson stated that African immigrants were bringing diseases into Australia and were of &quot;no benefit to this country whatsoever&quot;. She also stated her opposition to Muslim immigration. Ten years after her maiden speech, its effects were still being discussed within a racism framework, and were included in resources funded by the Queensland Government on &quot;Combating racism in Queensland&quot;. In 2007, Hanson publicly backed Kevin Andrews, then Minister for Immigration under John Howard, in his views about African migrants and crime.

====Islam====
In 2015, Hanson claimed that Halal certification in Australia was funding terrorism. After the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Hanson called for a ban on Muslim immigration to Australia. The same year, Hanson announced policies including a ban on building new mosques until a royal commission into whether Islam is a religion or a political ideology has been held, and installing CCTV cameras in all existing mosques. She has called for a moratorium on accepting Muslim immigrants into Australia. In her 2016 maiden speech in the Senate, she said that &quot;We are in danger of being swamped by Muslims who bear a culture and ideology that is incompatible with our own&quot; and should &quot;go back to where you came from&quot;, and called for banning Muslim migration. The speech prompted a walkout by Senate members of the Australian Greens.

After the January 2017 Melbourne car attack, Hanson repeated her stance on banning Muslims from entering Australia. In a live interview after the attack she stated &quot;all terrorist attacks in this country have been by Muslims&quot;, on which she was corrected by a journalist. In response, the Islamic Council of Victoria asked for a public apology for Hanson&#x27;s statement.

On 24 March 2017, after the 2017 Westminster attack, Hanson made an announcement in a video posted to social media, holding up a piece of paper with her own proposed hash tag “#Pray4MuslimBan”. “That is how you solve the problem, put a ban on it and then let’s deal with the issues here”, she said.

On 22 June 2017 Hanson, moved a motion in the Australian Senate calling on the government to respond to the Halal inquiry. The motion was passed.

On 17 August 2017, Hanson wore a burqa onto the floor of the Australian Senate in a move to rally support for a national ban of the religious attire, citing &quot;national security&quot; concerns. The move quickly became widely condemned by Labor, the Greens and the Liberal Party. In response, the Attorney-General George Brandis, who is tasked with giving advice on national security legislation, gave an &quot;emotional&quot; speech calling Hanson&#x27;s stunt &quot;an appalling thing to do&quot; and advised Hanson &quot;to be very very careful of the offense you may do to the religious sensibilities of other Australians&quot;, to which both Labor and Greens&#x27; Senators gave a standing ovation.

In September 2022, Hanson tweeted that Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi should &quot;piss off back to Pakistan&quot;. This came after Faruqi was slammed over an &quot;appalling&quot; tweet about the Queen. Subsequently, Faruqi decided to launch court proceedings against Hanson for &quot;breaching section 18C of the &quot;Racial Discrimination Act 1975&quot;&quot;. On 1 November 2024 it was reported that Federal Court of Australia judge Angus Stewart had ruled that Hanson&#x27;s tweet was an &quot;angry personal attack&quot;, unconnected with the issues Faruqi raised, and was therefore &quot;anti-Muslim or Islamophobic&quot;. Hanson was ordered to delete the tweet and was awarded costs for the entire proceedings. Hanson said that she would appeal the decision.

===Public opinion===
After her election in 1996, an estimated 10,000 people marched in protest against racism in Melbourne, and other protests followed, while Anglican and Catholic church leaders warned that the controversy threatened the stability of Australia&#x27;s multicultural society. Also repudiating Hanson&#x27;s views on immigration and multiculturalism were Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett, the Queensland National Senator Ron Boswell, Sir Ronald Wilson and former Prime Minister Paul Keating. At the 1997 annual conference of the Australian and New Zealand Communications Association (ANZCA) at La Trobe University, a paper was presented with the title &quot;Phenomena and Epiphenomena: is Pauline Hanson racist?&quot;. In 1998, social commentator Keith Suter argued that Hanson&#x27;s views were better understood as an angry response to globalisation. A poll in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; magazine at this time suggested that if Hanson formed a political party, it would win 18 percent of the vote. After months of silence, then-Prime Minister John Howard and Opposition Leader Kim Beazley proposed a bipartisan motion against racial discrimination and reaffirming support for a nondiscriminatory immigration policy. The motion was carried on the voices.

Hanson did not relent in articulating her views and continued to address public meetings around Australia. The League of Rights offered financial and organisational support for her campaign against Asian immigration, and in December she announced she was considering forming a political party to contest the next election. Alexander Downer, Minister for Foreign Affairs under John Howard, issued a media release calling on Hanson, David Oldfield and David Ettridge to distance themselves from racist slurs. In 2000, the University of NSW Press published the book &quot;Race, Colour and Identity in Australia and New Zealand&quot;, which identified Hanson as a central figure in the &quot;racism debate&quot; in Australia of the 1990s, noting that senior Australian academics such as Jon Stratton, Ghassan Hage and Andrew Jakubowicz had explored Hanson&#x27;s significance in an international as well as national context.

Academics, commentators and political analysts have continued to discuss Hanson&#x27;s legacy and impact upon Australian politics since her rise to prominence in the 1990s and her political comeback in 2016. Milton Osborne noted that public opinion research indicated Hanson&#x27;s initial support in the 1990s was not necessarily motivated by racist or anti-immigration sentiments, but instead from voters concerned about globalisation and unemployment. In 2019, Hans-Georg Betz identified Hanson as among the first populist politicians to mobilize a public following by targeting &quot;the intellectual elite&quot; in their messages, and that in the twentyfirst century, with &quot;today’s army of self-styled commentators and pundits summarily dismissing radical right-wing populist voters as uncouth, uneducated plebeians intellectually incapable of understanding the blessings of progressive identity politics, Hanson’s anti-elite rhetoric anno 1996 proved remarkably prescient, if rather tame&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hanson lives in Beaudesert, Queensland, on a large property. She purchased an investment property in Maitland, New South Wales in 2012, selling it in 2023.

During her first term in political office, Hanson and her younger children were guarded by security for extended amounts of time daily. Hanson was under escort almost completely, and while her younger children were largely kept out of public exposure, they were escorted to-and-from school and on other activities. The mail received at Hanson&#x27;s office was moved to another location and checked before it was re-distributed back to the office.

In 2006, Hanson acquired a real estate licence.

===Relationships and children===
In 1971, Hanson (then Pauline Seccombe) married Walter Zagorski, a former field representative and mining industry labourer from Poland, who had escaped war-torn Europe with his mother and arrived in Australia as refugees. He met Hanson when they both worked for the Drug Houses of Australia subsidiary Taylors Elliots Ltd. They had two children. In 1975, Hanson left Zagorski after discovering that he had been involved in several extramarital affairs. They reconciled briefly in 1977, but divorced later that year when Zagorski left Hanson for another woman.

In 1980, Hanson (then Pauline Zagorski) married Mark Hanson, a divorced tradesman working on the Gold Coast in Queensland. They honeymooned in South-East Asia. Mark Hanson had a daughter, Amanda (born 1977), from his previous marriage, and he later had two children with Hanson: Adam (born 1981) and Lee (born 1984). Together they established a trades and construction business, in which Hanson was in charge of the administrative and bookkeeping work, and would on occasions assist her husband on more practical work. Hanson has written about her difficult marriage, where alcohol and domestic violence impacted her family. They divorced in 1987.

In 1988, Hanson began a relationship with Morrie Marsden, a businessman in Queensland. Together, they established a catering service under the holding company Marsden Hanson Pty Ltd, and operated from their fish and chips store, Marsden&#x27;s Seafood, in Silkstone, Queensland. Marsden worked on Hanson&#x27;s campaign for political office in the seat of Oxley in 1996, and was a member of her staff after her election. When Hanson began to receive national and international media attention for her views, Marsden left the relationship. Hanson had begun a relationship with Ipswich man Rick Gluyas in 1994. Gluyas encouraged her to run as a candidate in the 1994 Ipswich City Council election, in which he also ran. Both were elected. Hanson and Gluyas ended their relationship some time after this, with Hanson retaining the home and property they had owned jointly at Coleyville, near Ipswich.

In 1996, Hanson began a relationship with David Oldfield. In 2000, all of Hanson&#x27;s relations with Oldfield ended when he was dismissed from Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation.

In 2005, Hanson began a relationship with Chris Callaghan, a country music singer and political activist. He wrote and composed the song &quot;The Australian Way of Life&quot;, which was used in Hanson&#x27;s 2007 campaign for the Australian Senate, under her new United Australia Party. In 2007, Hanson revealed that she and Callaghan were engaged. However, in 2008, Hanson broke off the relationship.

In 2011, while campaigning for the New South Wales Legislative Council, Hanson began a relationship with property developer and real estate agent Tony Nyquist.

===Fraud conviction and reversal===

A 1999 civil suit reached the Queensland Court of Appeal in 2000 involving disgruntled former One Nation member Terry Sharples and led to a finding of fraud when registering One Nation as a political party, Hanson faced bankruptcy and made an appeal to supporters for donations.

On 20 August 2003, a jury in the District Court of Queensland convicted Hanson and David Ettridge of electoral fraud. Both Hanson and Ettridge were wrongly sentenced to three years imprisonment for falsely claiming that 500 members of the Pauline Hanson Support Movement were members of the political organisation Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation to register that organisation in Queensland as a political party and apply for electoral funding. Because the registration was found to be unlawful, Hanson&#x27;s receipt of electoral funding worth $498,637 resulted in two further convictions for dishonestly obtaining property, each with three-year sentences, to run concurrently with the first. The sentence was widely criticised in the media and by some politicians as being too harsh.

The prime minister, John Howard, said that it was &quot;a very long, unconditional sentence&quot; and Bronwyn Bishop said that Hanson was a political prisoner, comparing her conviction with Robert Mugabe&#x27;s treatment of Zimbabwean opponents. The sentence was widely criticised in the media as being too harsh.

On 6 November 2003, delivering judgment the day after hearing the appeal, the Queensland Court of Appeal quashed all of Hanson and Ettridge&#x27;s convictions. Hanson, having spent 11 weeks in jail, was immediately released along with Ettridge. The court&#x27;s unanimous decision was that the evidence did not support a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the people on the list were not members of the Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation party and that Hanson and Ettridge knew this when the application to register the party was submitted. Accordingly, the convictions regarding registration were quashed. The convictions regarding funding, which depended on the same facts, were also quashed. This decision did not specifically follow the Sharples case, where the trial judge&#x27;s finding of such fraud had not been overturned in the appeal by Hanson and Ettridge. That case was distinguished as a civil suit – in administrative law, as to the validity of the decision by Electoral Commissioner O&#x27;Shea to register the party – in which proof had been only on the balance of probabilities. Chief Justice Paul de Jersey, with whom the other two judges agreed overall, suggested that if Hanson, Ettridge and especially the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions had used better lawyers from the start, the whole matter might not have taken so long up to the appeal hearing, or might even have been avoided altogether. The Court of Appeal president, Margaret McMurdo, rebuked many politicians, including John Howard and Bronwyn Bishop MHR. Their observations, she said, demonstrated at least &quot;a lack of understanding of the Rule of Law&quot; and &quot;an attempt to influence the judicial appellate process and to interfere with the independence of the judiciary for cynical political motives&quot;, although she praised other leading Coalition politicians for accepting the District Court&#x27;s decision.

===Television appearances===
In 2004, Hanson appeared in multiple television programs such as &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, &quot;Enough Rope&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; and &quot;This is Your Life&quot;.

In 2011, Hanson was a contestant on &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;.

Following her successful relaunch of Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation party at the 2016 federal Senate election, with four senators elected, including herself, a documentary was made by the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) entitled &quot;Pauline Hanson: Please Explain!&quot;

===Sexual harassment allegations===
On 14 February 2019, Hanson was accused of sexually harassing fellow Senator Brian Burston. Burston claimed that Hanson &quot;rubbed her fingers up my spine&quot; in an incident that occurred in 1998, and propositioned him after he was elected in 2016. In court it arose Hanson also sent a &quot;malicious&quot; text message to Burston&#x27;s wife claiming he was infatuated with another staff member. Hanson has denied the claims of sexual harassment.

==Published books==

Soon after her election to Parliament, Hanson&#x27;s book &quot;Pauline Hansonthe Truth: on Asian immigration, the Aboriginal question, the gun debate and the future of Australia&quot; was published. In it she makes claims of Aboriginal cannibalism, in particular that Aboriginal women ate their babies and tribes cannibalised their members. Hanson told the media that the reason for these claims of cannibalism was to &quot;demonstrate the savagery of Aboriginal society&quot;.

David Ettridge, the One Nation party director, said that the book&#x27;s claims were intended to correct &quot;misconceptions&quot; about Aboriginal history. These alleged misconceptions were said to be relevant to modern-day Aboriginal welfare funding. He asserted that &quot;the suggestion that we should be feeling some concern for modern day Aborigines for suffering in the past is balanced a bit by the alternative view of whether you can feel sympathy for people who eat their babies&quot;.

The book predicted that in 2050 Australia would have a lesbian president of Chinese-Indian background called Poona Li Hung who would be a cyborg. In 2004, Hanson said that the book was &quot;written by some other people who actually put my name to it&quot; and that, while she held the copyright in the book, she was unaware that much of the material was being published under her name.

In March 2007, Hanson published her autobiography, &quot;Untamed and Unashamed&quot;.

In 2018, Hanson and Tony Abbott launched a collection of Hanson&#x27;s speeches, &quot;Pauline: In Her Own Words&quot;, compiled by journalist Tom Ravlic.

==In art==

Aboriginal artist Karla Dickens represented Hanson in a collage entitled &quot;Clown Nation&quot; which included Hanson&#x27;s photograph, in a series called &quot;A Dickensian Country Show&quot;. It was shown in the 2020 Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art at the Art Gallery of South Australia, an exhibition titled &quot;Monster Theatres&quot;.

<text>The Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum is a 98-acre (40 ha) zoo, aquarium, botanical garden, natural history museum, publisher, and art gallery founded in 1952. Located just west of Tucson, Arizona, it features two miles (3.2 km) of walking paths traversing 21 acres (8.5 ha) of desert landscape. It is one of the most visited attractions in Southern Arizona.

The nonprofit organization focuses on the interpretation of the natural history, plants and animals of the Sonoran Desert. The museum is home to more than 230 animal species and 1,200 varieties of plants. It is open every day through the year, and hosts nearly 400,000 visitors annually, including visitors from abroad.

The museum is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, a member of the American Alliance of Museums and the American Public Gardens Association.

==History==

Founded in 1952, the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum interprets the complete natural history of a single region—the Sonoran Desert and adjacent ecosystems—with plants and animals from the region featured together in its exhibits.

William H. Carr inspired and founded the Desert Museum with the support of his friend, Arthur Newton Pack, a conservationist, son of Charles Lathrop Pack, and editor of &quot;Nature Magazine&quot;. Carr had earlier founded the Bear Mountain Trailside Museum in New York, which was affiliated with the American Museum of Natural History. There he had developed a similar approach to displays, working with native plants and animals to create a regionally focused collection.

Pack, through his foundation, had provided $200,000 to open the museum and pay its operating cost, so the museum initially charged no admission. Although an admission charge was instituted in 1953, the museum is still supported only by admission fees, memberships, and donations, and receives no direct support from public taxes.

From 1953 to 1985, a local television series, &quot;Desert Trails&quot;, featured the museum. &quot;It was an informal show, almost always having live animals and human guests, and focusing on the natural history of the desert as well as happenings at the museum.&quot; In 1991 the museum partnered to develop a national television series known as &quot;Desert Speaks&quot;. It was produced in cooperation with the local PBS affiliate (KUAT), and with The Nature Conservancy of Arizona. This television series was broadcast in 200 markets and ran for 19 seasons.&quot;

TripAdvisor rated the Museum as Tucson&#x27;s #2 attraction for 2018. It was ranked number 18 on their &quot;Top 25 Museums – United States&quot; and a top five public gardens to visit in the United States for 2018, and ranked number nine in the world on their &quot;Traveler’s Choice&quot; of top museums for 2013 and 2014. &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Traveler&quot; included in their list of five museums in the United States for children interested in dinosaurs.

== Exhibits and interpretation ==

The Warden Aquarium opened in January 2013. The aquarium highlights the roles of the Colorado and other rivers in the region, as well as the Gulf of California, from which the water brought by the monsoon is essential to life in the Sonoran Desert.

The Desert Museum has exhibited lower vertebrates and invertebrates since its early days. Though this hall has been modified over the years, the building dates back to 1937 and many of the painted dioramas were created in the early to mid-1950s. On exhibit is a wide variety of native reptiles, including many species of rattlesnakes. Many amphibians and other invertebrates, ranging from spiders and scorpions to beetles, walking sticks, and grasshoppers, are also showcased.

At Cat Canyon visitors can view small cats, like bobcats and an ocelot, in naturalistic grotto settings. This exhibit area also includes a gray fox and porcupine.

The Desert Grassland exhibit area recreates a desert grassland habitat featuring soap tree yuccas, desert scrub, grasses and succulents. Visitors can observe prairie dogs and learn the region&#x27;s history through a replica of a mammoth kill site.

Life on the Rocks is a multi-species exhibit focusing on the habitat and species most often encountered amid the region&#x27;s rocky slopes. Some enclosures are mesh-topped with natural soils and vegetation; others are glass-fronted crevices or cutaway burrows in simulated soil banks. The &quot;homes&quot; of individual species are embedded in the rocks—many with burrows that can be exposed by visitors.

The Life Underground exhibit highlights creatures that make their homes underground. Visitors enter a tunnel and walk below ground into a dimly lit corridor where various creatures, such as kit fox, kangaroo rat, and ringtail, are featured. Here visitors learn where animals go when the desert heats up.

Currently on exhibit in the Riparian Corridor area are a river otter, bighorn sheep, coatis (also known as coatimundis), beavers, native fish and aquatic invertebrates (i.e., dragonflies and snails). There is also a desert toad life-cycle installation.

The Desert Loop Trail is an unpaved desert trail one-half mile long, passing through areas where javelinas, coyotes and lizards are on display. The fiber fencing there are designed to be almost invisible to the eye, aiming to make the enclosure feel like naturally open space. Agaves and various legume trees, native to the region, are identified on this trail.

The &quot;Mountain Woodland&quot; exhibit is a Mexican Pine-Oak Woodland habitat recreating similar habitats in nearby mountain ranges. Native species include a cougar, white-tailed deer, Merriam&#x27;s turkeys and a brown bear. Mexican wolves and thick-billed parrots also showcased in this area are no longer present in the Sonoran Desert.

There is a walk-in aviary with northern cardinals, Gambel&#x27;s quail, ducks, doves, and many other species of native birds. Several benches are located throughout the aviary for observation. A small stream runs through the middle of the enclosure.

The Earth Sciences Center-Cave is an artificial cave constructed with arches, side chambers and a tunnel for visitors to explore its 75-foot length. Along the entry passage, organisms and residents are displayed. Further in, a glistening mass of cave formations are lit from beneath the surface of a pool. In the grand rooms, fossils, geologic gems and minerals, and the history of the earth is interpreted.

Desert Garden was built as a partnership between &quot;Sunset&quot; magazine and the Desert Museum. Three different levels of demonstration gardens display various species of plants that can be used in landscaping for homes in the Sonoran Desert region. There are two water features and seating. Attracted by water and flowers, wild native birds and butterflies frequently visit.

The Hummingbird Aviary allows observation of hummingbirds hovering so closely that visitors can feel the air disturbed by their wings. In breeding season, nests are near enough to allow viewing of the babies. The aviary houses four species that nest annually. The museum&#x27;s Hummingbird Propagation Program is the only one of its kind in the world for North American hummingbirds.

Due to its bi-seasonal rainfall, the Sonoran Desert region is known as the &quot;lushest desert on earth&quot; and is home to over 2,000 species of plants. The museum&#x27;s gardens display this ecosystem and represent a variety of biotic communities found within the Sonoran Desert region. There are 1,200 different species of plants with 56,000 individual specimens planted on the grounds. The following gardens are available for viewing throughout the year:
* Desert Grasslands
* Agave Garden
* Palo Verde Trees
* Hohokam Agave Field
* Cactus Garden
* Labyrinth
* People and Pollinators
* Life Zone Transects
* Tropical Deciduous Forest
* Desert Garden
* Yucca Ramada
* Pollination Gardens

==Live presentations==
=== Live &amp; (sort of) on the Loose ===
This presentation features often misunderstood venomous reptiles. Each program presents two species, which could be any combination of the following:
* Mexican beaded lizard
* Western diamondback rattlesnake
* Mohave rattlesnake
* Black-tailed rattlesnake
* Gila monster

=== Raptor free-flight ===
This birds-of-prey demonstration is held in the open desert and spectators watch from the flight path. The birds fly so close visitors often feel the brush of feathers. Weather permitting, the museum hosts two demonstrations daily from mid-October through mid-April. The birds fly completely untethered, without any jesses (leg straps) and most often without leg rings. Only birds native to the Sonoran Desert Region are flown. A featured species is Harris&#x27;s hawks, the only raptor species in the world to hunt as a family using strategy, like wolves. The morning and afternoon demonstrations showcase different species, so each is unique. Species include: Harris&#x27;s hawk, peregrine falcons, barn owls, red-tailed hawks, ferruginous hawk, great horned owl, gray hawk, prairie falcon, and chihuahuan raven.

=== Docent stations ===
Docent Stations, with trained volunteer naturalists, are located throughout the museum grounds. At these stations, docents offer presentations with live reptiles, birds, or mammals, or with animal skulls, skeletons, or fossil remains. Some stations interpret the geology of the Sonoran Desert region including rock formations and semi-precious stones.

Tours are available through advanced reservations via the museum&#x27;s website. Topics include: Zookeeper for a Day, Winged Wonders (Hummingbird Tour), Warden Aquarium Private Tour, Walk on the Wild Side, and the Reptiles, Amphibians, and Invertebrates Tour.

== Conservation education and science ==
For many years, the Museum has been involved in scientific investigations, including botanical field investigations, especially in Mexico, with population studies of Ironwood, and a major bi-national research program on migratory pollinators. Current work includes studies of pollination and seed dispersal (how plants survive and get around), and the effects of climate change on regional ecological communities. The Living Collections staff of the museum, are involved in collaborative species survival projects, working with outside agencies and scientists. These include salvage and recovery efforts on a variety of lower vertebrates, including the Tarahumara frog, Chiricahua leopard frog, Mexican garter snake, Sonoyta mud turtle, and a wide range of desert fishes.

=== Community outreach – the Desert Ark van and live animals ===
Desert Ark Community Programs feature live Sonoran Desert animals and may include interactive lectures, slide shows or activities. Museum staff members travel throughout Southern Arizona as well as areas within an 8-hour round-trip drive from the museum, although live animals are unable to travel outside the state of Arizona. For in-state programs, live animals may be used, and may include reptiles, birds, mammals and insects, although the particular animals vary by program.

=== Digital library ===
The Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum has a digital library containing thousands of photographs of plants and animals. The digital library is an interactive site that has a kid&#x27;s page with videos, animal sounds, and games. Another interactive feature is the plant phenology section. Visitors can look at a specific species of plant or compare two plant species. In addition, the &quot;Time of Year&quot; feature allows users to select a date on the calendar to view what species are in flower or are expected to be in flower. Past dates will also provide temperature and precipitation data, whereas future dates will give average temperatures and chance of precipitation.

== Art Institute ==
The Art Institute opened in 2001 to promote conservation of the Sonoran Desert through art education including classes, art exhibits, and stewardship of the Museum art. The Art Institute offers a certificate program in nature illustration. Over 80 art classes offered throughout the year. The Institute offers art workshops focusing on specific areas, such as &quot;Sonoran Desert Birds&quot; and &quot;Drawn to the Desert: Focus on the Sea of Cortez.&quot; The Art Institute also offers classes for in photography, ranging from &quot;Photography Basics for Adjustable Cameras&quot; to &quot;Intermediate Nature Photography.&quot;

=== Ironwood gallery ===
The Ironwood Gallery hosts temporary exhibits by accomplished artists from southern Arizona, regional artists from throughout the Southwest and Mexico. It also hosts nationally recognized artists, both individually and through traveling exhibits, by the Society of Conservation Artists and (others).

== Desert Museum Press ==
Since 1995, the ASDM Press (Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum Press) has published more than 40 books or guides, including 22 popular books on the natural history of the Sonoran Desert Region. It has published six picture books for children in both English and Spanish and several pocket guides to hummingbirds and other birds, plants, lizards, snakes, beetles, etc. In 2000, ASDM Press co-published the 628-page &quot;bible&quot; of the Sonoran Desert, &quot;A Natural History of the Sonoran Desert&quot;, with the University of California Press. In collaboration with the University of Arizona Press, the division has co-published several technical books in the Studies in Natural History Series, featuring research on topics from pollinators, to water in the desert, to the Sea of Cortez. In the first few years publications were mainly small paperback books. But since 2000, more substantial volumes are common, including the recent field guides to mountain wildflowers and mountain trees, as well as the full-color, 232-page &quot;Natural History of the Santa Catalina Mountains&quot;, with an Introduction to the Madrean Sky Islands (2013).

== Operations and support ==
The museum is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) institution. Its primary source of revenue is from the sale of admission tickets and memberships. Revenue from grants, major donors, bequests and planned gifts, special events, sponsorships, and an annual fund also contribute to the museum&#x27;s funding.

=== Docents and volunteers ===
The Desert Museum benefits from the service of approximately 500 volunteers, who assist the approximately 120 paid staff. Collectively, Desert Museum volunteers contribute about 130,000 hours per year.

Since its inception in 1972, the Docent Program has become a hallmark of the museum and is recognized by the industry as one of the finest docent corps in existence today. Each of the nearly 200 docents undergoes a 15-week training program in natural history education.

Another 300 volunteers support the museum in a variety of departmental assignments. The ASDM Internship Program offers a few unpaid, educational appointments for college students.

== Hal Gras and the Desert Ark program ==
One of the most influential staff members in the history of the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum was Harold W. &quot;Hal&quot; Gras Jr., more commonly known as Hal Gras. According to David Leighton, historian for the &quot;Arizona Daily Star&quot; newspaper, Gras was born in New Jersey, in 1919. After serving in World War II and getting married, he relocated to El Paso, Texas where he received his college degree in broadcasting. In 1950, he moved to Tucson, Arizona, where he worked in radio and then television.

In 1952, when the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum opened its doors, Hal Gras and his wife Natie attended its opening and, as a result Gras began hosting the museum&#x27;s TV show, &quot;Desert Trails&quot; (renamed &quot;The Desert Speaks&quot; when it moved to KUAT around 1990). The show first aired in 1953, and would run for 32 years, with Gras hosting 1,551 shows. From 1955 to 1972, Gras was the public relations director for the museum. He visited local clubs and talked about the museum. Though he had little or no experience with animals, he started bringing some along with him for his appearances. Soon the popularity of his talks increased and he started bringing creatures from the museum to schools, hospitals, county fairs, etc. The program and the car that Gras brought the animals in both came to be called &quot;The Desert Ark&quot;.

When Gras retired in 1985, he had presented a total of 5,382 Desert Ark programs. A few years after his retirement, a small street south of the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, along Kinney Road, was named Hal Gras Road in his honor. He would die in 1999.

<doc id="69930" wikidata="Q199945" url="?curid=69930" title="Alicia Silverstone">
<text>Alicia Silverstone ( ; born October 4, 1976) is an American actress. She made her film debut in the thriller &quot;The Crush&quot; (1993), earning the 1994 MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance, and gained further prominence as a teen idol when she appeared in the music videos for Aerosmith&#x27;s songs &quot;Cryin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Crazy&quot;. She went on to star as Cher Horowitz in the teen comedy film &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995), which earned her a multi-million-dollar deal with Columbia Pictures. In 1997, she starred in the superhero film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, playing Batgirl.

Silverstone received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy for her role in the short-lived NBC series &quot;Miss Match&quot; (2003). She has continued to act in film and television and on stage.

A vegan, Silverstone has endorsed PETA activities and published two cookbooks: &quot;The Kind Diet&quot; (2009) and &quot;The Kind Mama&quot; (2014).

==Early life==
Silverstone was born in San Francisco, California, the daughter of British parents: Deirdre &quot;Didi&quot; Silverstone (née Radford), a Scottish former Pan Am flight attendant; and Monty Silverstone, an English real estate agent. She grew up in Hillsborough, California. Her father was born to a Jewish family and her mother converted to Conservative Judaism before marriage. Silverstone had a Bat Mitzvah ceremony. She began modeling when she was six, and was subsequently cast in television commercials, the first being for Domino&#x27;s Pizza. She attended Crocker Middle School, then San Mateo High School.

==Career==
===1990s===

Her first credited acting role was on &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; in 1992, in the episode &quot;Road Test&quot;, as Kevin&#x27;s high school &quot;dream girl&quot;. Silverstone made her film debut when she obtained the leading role in the erotic thriller &quot;The Crush&quot;, playing a teenage girl who sets out to ruin an older man after he spurns her affections; she became legally emancipated at the age of 15 to work the hours required for the shooting schedule of the film. She won two awards at the 1994 MTV Movie Awards for the role—Best Breakthrough Performance and Best Villain. Silverstone made some television films in her early career, including &quot;Torch Song&quot;, &quot;Cool and the Crazy&quot;, and &quot;Scattered Dreams&quot;.

After seeing her in &quot;The Crush&quot;, Marty Callner decided Silverstone would be perfect for a role in a music video he was directing for Aerosmith, called &quot;Cryin&#x27;.&quot; Silverstone is shown getting a navel piercing in the music video, which has largely been credited as introducing the navel piercing to mainstream culture. She was subsequently cast in two more Aerosmith videos, &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Crazy&quot;. These were hugely successful for both the band and Silverstone, making her a household name. After seeing Silverstone in the three videos, filmmaker Amy Heckerling decided to cast her in the coming-of-age comedy &quot;Clueless&quot;, in the role of Cher Horowitz, a sweet but spoiled girl living in Beverly Hills. &quot;Clueless&quot; became a hit and critical darling during the summer of 1995, and as a result, Silverstone signed a deal with Columbia-TriStar valued between $8 and $10 million. As part of the package, she got a three-year first-look deal for her own production company, First Kiss Productions. Silverstone also won Best Female Performance and Most Desirable Female at the 1996 MTV Movie Awards, plus awards from Blockbuster Entertainment Award, Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, National Board of Review and an American Comedy Award for her performance in the film.

Silverstone had three other film releases in 1995—&quot;Le Nouveau monde&quot;, &quot;Hideaway&quot; and &quot;The Babysitter&quot;. The French drama about Americans &quot;Le Nouveau monde&quot; saw her play the love interest of a French boy. In the film adaptation of the novel by Dean Koontz, &quot;Hideaway&quot;, she took on the role of the daughter of a man who dies in a car accident and is revived two hours later, and the film &quot;The Babysitter&quot; was a B erotic thriller directed by Guy Ferland based on the eponymous short story by Robert Coover in his 1969 collection &quot;Pricksongs and Descants&quot;.

In 1996, she starred in the direct-to-video thriller &quot;True Crime&quot; as a Catholic school student searching for a murderer of teenage girls. Her next role was Barbara Wilson/Batgirl in &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997). Budgeted at $160 million, the film grossed a modest $238 million worldwide, and her turn as Batgirl received polarized reviews from critics, who also considered the film to be one of the worst films of all time. Silverstone won a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress, but received a Blimp Award at the Kids&#x27; Choice Awards for the role.

Also in 1997, the first film by Silverstone&#x27;s production company, &quot;Excess Baggage&quot;, was released. In the film, she plays a neglected young woman who stages her own kidnapping to get her wealthy father&#x27;s attention, only to actually be kidnapped by a car thief. The film only grossed $14.5 million in North America, and received mediocre reviews from critics; Roger Ebert mentioned that she was &quot;no better than OK&quot; as he felt that she was miscast. Silverstone starred as the female lead in the romantic comedy &quot;Blast from the Past&quot; (1999), directed by Hugh Wilson and co-starring Brendan Fraser, Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek. Critical response towards the film was mixed, while it made a modest $40 million globally.

===2000s===
In the 1990s, her public profile and film career saw significant growth. For the next decade, Silverstone stepped aside from the spotlight and opted to focus on smaller-scale films and theater. In &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; (2000), a film adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play, directed by Kenneth Branagh, Silverstone played the Princess of France, a role which required her to sing and dance. While critical response was mixed, the film received a limited theatrical release. Film critic James Berardinelli felt that Silverstone, &quot;while not completely at ease with all of her dialogue, is surprisingly credible&quot; in her portrayal.

Silverstone executive produced and provided the voice of Sharon Spitz, the lead part, in the Canadian animated television series &quot;Braceface&quot;, from 2001 to 2003. During this period, she played the bassist of a rock band in the independent comedy &quot;Global Heresy&quot; (2002), opposite Peter O&#x27;Toole and Joan Plowright, and made her Broadway debut alongside Kathleen Turner and Jason Biggs in a stage version of &quot;The Graduate&quot;, which ran between 2002 and 2003 at the Plymouth Theatre. Silverstone also starred as one of several disgruntled bank employees trying to rob the same bank in the small-scale comedy &quot;Scorched&quot; (2003), co-starring Rachael Leigh Cook, Woody Harrelson and John Cleese.

Silverstone signed on to headline the 2003 NBC television series &quot;Miss Match&quot;, as Kate Fox, a Los Angeles matrimonial attorney who doubles as a high-end matchmaker. The show was canceled after only 11 episodes had aired, and &quot;Variety&quot; in its review for the show, wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s a shame that she&#x27;s stuck with such wafer-thin material here, because Silverstone is undoubtedly a fun, perky presence on the small screen.&quot; Nevertheless, she earned a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy.

In 2004, Silverstone played a news reporter turned villainess in &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot;, opposite Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. Despite a negative critical response, the film grossed $181 million at the international box office.

In the comedy &quot;Beauty Shop&quot; (2005), a spinoff of the Barbershop film franchise, Silverstone appeared with Queen Latifah, playing a naive and bubbly stylist of an Atlanta-area salon. The film was her final wide release of the decade in North America, where it grossed $37.2 million.

Her next film, the thriller &quot;Silence Becomes You&quot;, received a DVD release in 2005. Silverstone did a pilot episode in 2005 with Fox called &quot;Queen B&quot;, where she played a delusional former high school prom queen, but it was not picked up for production. In 2006, she starred in an ABC pilot called &quot;Pink Collar&quot; as a woman working in a law firm, but like &quot;Queen B&quot;, this pilot was not picked up to series.

Silverstone portrayed the close friend of a teenager turned secret agent in the action-spy film &quot;Stormbreaker&quot; (2006), directed by Geoffrey Sax and co-starring Alex Pettyfer, Ewan McGregor and Mickey Rourke. Despite a $40 million budget, the film made $23 million worldwide and was largely dismissed by critics. &quot;USA Today&quot; described Silverstone as &quot;simply ghastly&quot; in her role, while &quot;View London&quot; remarked that there was &quot;strong support&quot; from the actress. She obtained the role of a single mother returning to her hometown after a lengthy absence in the made-for-Hallmark Hall of Fame television film &quot;Candles on Bay Street&quot;, based on the book by Cathie Pelletier.

Silverstone continued her theater work, next appearing in David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Boston Marriage&quot; (2007), a play exploring the relationship between two upper-class women, where the actress played what was described by &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as the &quot;clueless and hyper-emotional Scottish maid&quot; of one of them. The production was presented at the Geffen Playhouse theater in Los Angeles, with &quot;Variety&quot; writing that Silverstone &quot;steals the show [in her role]. Her Scottish accent is good, her comic delivery is fresh, and she gets the maximum laugh value from each wobbly curtsey. Her character is the one thing in the show that Mamet gets absolutely right, although she is used a bit repetitively.&quot; In the same year, she starred as a secretary in the theater production &quot;Speed-the-Plow&quot;, a satire of Hollywood executives. The production, presented at Geffen Playhouse, was directed by Randall Arney and penned by David Mamet. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; concluded the play was &quot;fueled&quot; by &quot;a spectacular tour de force&quot; from Silverstone.

In 2008, Silverstone filmed another unaired ABC pilot alongside Megan Mullally called &quot;Bad Mother&#x27;s Handbook&quot; and made a cameo appearance in the action-comedy &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;. In 2009, she starred in the music video for Rob Thomas&#x27;s single &quot;Her Diamonds&quot;, and acted in Donald Margulies&#x27; production of &quot;Time Stands Still&quot;, set in Brooklyn and revolving around the relationships of two couples. Like Silverstone&#x27;s previous few stage projects, it ran at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles. By the late 2000s, she ventured into writing, releasing her book &quot;The Kind Diet&quot;, a guide to vegan nutrition, in 2009; she simultaneously launched its associated website &quot;The Kind Life&quot;. &quot;The Kind Diet&quot; topped the &quot;Hardcover Advice &amp; Misc.&quot; category of &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list.

===2010s===
Silverstone continued to focus on theater and independent productions throughout the 2010s, but acted considerably more than in the previous decade. In 2010, she reprised her role in the Broadway production of &quot;Time Stands Still&quot;, alongside Laura Linney. Daniel Sullivan directed the play, and described Silverstone as &quot;a breath of fresh air&quot; which had a general positive reception among critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that Silverstone &quot;brings warmth, actorly intelligence, and delicate humor.&quot; She filmed a small segment in the independent comedy sequel &quot;Elektra Luxx&quot; (2010), but her part was not included in the final cut of the film.

Silverstone obtained the role of the teacher of a Manhattan private-school senior in the teen romance drama &quot;The Art of Getting By&quot; (2011), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. The ensemble comedy &quot;Butter&quot; (2011) saw her play the adoptive mother of a 12-year-old African-American girl who enters a local butter sculpturing competition in a small Iowa town. The film screened on the film festival circuit and was distributed in a limited release. She reunited with &quot;Clueless&quot; director Amy Heckerling in the independent film &quot;Vamps&quot; (2012), playing one of two vampires who fall in love and face a choice that could jeopardize their immortality. She was offered the role after Heckerling came to see her in &quot;Time Stands Still&quot;. Despite a very limited release, &quot;Variety&quot; found the film to be &quot;a refreshing change of pace [...] with an irresistible cast&quot;.

Silverstone guest-starred in &quot;Childrens Hospital&quot; (2011) and obtained a four-episode role in the first season of &quot;Suburgatory&quot; (2012), reuniting with her &quot;Clueless&quot; castmate Jeremy Sisto. In 2012, Silverstone returned to Broadway in the production of &quot;The Performers&quot;, a comedic performance set at the Adult Film Award in Las Vegas. The play premiered in November at the Longacre Theatre, but was canceled after 23 previews and seven regular performances due to the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. In 2013, she filmed the television pilot &quot;HR&quot;, which was not picked up, and appeared in the Sundance comedy &quot;Ass Backwards&quot;, released for VOD and selected theaters. In 2014, Silverstone took on the role of a self-absorbed mother in the rural environment in the coming-of-age drama &quot;Angels in Stardust&quot;, and her &quot;Kind Life&quot; follow-up book, &quot;The Kind Mama&quot;, was published.

In 2015, Silverstone starred in the New York production of &quot;Of Good Stock&quot;, a play revolving around a group of siblings who gather at their family home for a summer weekend. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; remarked that she was &quot;magnetic even as an engaged narcissist, ditzy&quot; sister; however, &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that her role was &quot;the most cartoonish of the characters and a thankless part for [Silverstone], who tips into comic shrillness here&quot;. She appeared in the romantic comedy &quot;Who Gets the Dog?&quot; (2016), opposite Ryan Kwanten portraying a divorcing couple fighting over custody of their beloved dog. The production went straight to DVD. Her next film appearance was in the independent biographical drama &quot;King Cobra&quot; (2016), as the mother of gay film actor Brent Corrigan.

In 2016&#x27;s &quot;Catfight&quot;, Silverstone played the love interest of an outsider artist having a bitter lifetime rivalry with a wealthy housewife. The black comedy was released for VOD and selected theaters, to largely positive reviews. Silverstone starred in three 2017 films—&quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul&quot;, &quot;The Killing of a Sacred Deer&quot;, and &quot;The Tribes of Palos Verdes&quot;—and filmed the television series &quot;American Woman&quot; in July of that year. On her busy workload, she remarked: &quot;[T]hey were all happening at the same time. Everybody worked together. Yorgos [the &quot;Sacred Dee&quot; director] helped us to push my date and &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&quot; held the movie for a week or two for me&quot;. The comedy &quot;The Long Haul&quot;, the fourth film in the &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&quot; film series, saw her portray the clueless and loving mother of the titular character, replacing Rachael Harris. The film was widely disliked and criticized by critics for the recasting of the main characters and its story development, and while &quot;The Long Haul&quot; made a modest $40.1 million worldwide, it emerged as Silverstone&#x27;s most widely seen film since &quot;Beauty Shop&quot; (2005).

In the psychological thriller &quot;The Killing of a Sacred Deer&quot;, directed by Yorgos Lanthimos and co-starring Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman, Silverstone took on the role of a widow and the mother of a mysterious boy who befriends his late father&#x27;s cardiac surgeon. The film competed for the at the 70th Cannes Film Festival and was an arthouse success. Casting director Francine Maisler chose Silverstone after seeing her star in a previous play; her two-scene appearance was filmed in one day, and she remarked of the filming: &quot;[I]t was just so wonderful. When you admire something so much, it&#x27;s a little bit hard to imagine how you fit into it&quot;. In the independent coming-of-age drama &quot;The Tribes of Palos Verdes&quot;, she reunited with her &quot;Butter&quot; co-star Jennifer Garner, playing a real-estate agent living in Palos Verdes, an affluent, coastal suburb of Los Angeles. The film received a one-theater release by IFC.

Silverstone appeared in the comedy &quot;Book Club&quot; (2018), opposite Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda and Candice Bergen, playing the &quot;domineering&quot; daughter of a &quot;skittish&quot; widow reading &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;. The series &quot;American Woman&quot; starred Silverstone as a woman discovering her own brand of independence amid the rise of second-wave feminism in the 1970s. It aired for one season on the Paramount Network. To promote the series, she appeared on an episode of &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot; with co-star Mena Suvari. She appeared in the horror film &quot;The Lodge&quot;, which premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival.

===2020s===
In 2020, Silverstone appeared in the comedies &quot;Bad Therapy&quot;, &quot;Sister of the Groom&quot; and &quot;Valley Girl&quot;, and also narrated the eco-superhero fantasy novel &quot;Chendell: A Natural Warrior&quot; and the Audible podcast &quot;Eat S-t Kenny Daniels.&quot; She began starring in the Netflix series &quot;The Baby-Sitters Club&quot;.

In 2021, she appeared in the Netflix series &quot;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&quot;.

In 2023, she appeared in crime drama thriller &quot;Reptile&quot; co-starring Benicio del Toro and Justin Timberlake. Her 2024 roles include the A24 film &quot;Y2K&quot; and Netherlands-produced comedy horror &quot;Krazy House&quot;.

In 2024, Silverstone executive produced the British documentary film &quot;I Could Never Go Vegan&quot;.

==Activism==
Silverstone is an animal rights and environmental activist. She became a vegan in 1998 after attending an animal rights meeting, saying, &quot;I realized that I was the problem ... I was an animal lover who was eating animals.&quot; She has stated she struggled with childhood vegetarianism: &quot;At eight years old it&#x27;s hard to stick to your guns—and so through the years I was always starting and stopping trying to be a vegetarian.&quot; She has been criticized due to her anti-vaccine stance, promotion of pseudoscientific diet and lifestyle choices, and her claims regarding the medical and spiritual benefits of veganism.

In 2004, Silverstone was voted &quot;Sexiest Female Vegetarian&quot; by PETA. In 2007, she appeared nude in a print advertisement and 30-second commercial for PETA championing vegetarianism; the TV spot was subsequently pulled from the Houston, Texas market by Comcast Cable. In 2016, she posed nude in one of the group&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Go Naked&quot; anti-wool ads. She has set up a sanctuary for rescued pets in Los Angeles. In 2012, during the trial of Russian band Pussy Riot, she wrote a letter to Vladimir Putin asking that vegan meals be made available to all Russian prisoners.

Federal campaign contribution records list Silverstone contributing $500 to Dennis Kucinich&#x27;s 2004 presidential campaign. She supported Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential candidacy, and endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for president in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In 2023, Silverstone endorsed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the 2024 Democratic primaries and announced that she had left the Democratic Party and registered as an Independent.

In 2009, she appeared in &quot;A Gaythering Storm&quot;, a Funny or Die spoof Internet video parodying anti-same-sex marriage commercial &quot;Gathering Storm&quot;.

==Personal life==
Silverstone has two older siblings: a half-sister from her father&#x27;s previous marriage, Kezi Silverstone, and a brother, David Silverstone.

She married her longtime boyfriend, rock musician Christopher Jarecki, in a beachfront ceremony at Lake Tahoe on June 11, 2005. After meeting outside a theater in 1997, they dated for eight years prior to their marriage. They got engaged about a year before their marriage, and Jarecki presented Silverstone with an engagement ring that had belonged to his grandmother.

They lived in an eco-friendly Los Angeles house, with solar panels and an organic vegetable garden. Silverstone had bought the house, shared with a &quot;menagerie of rescued dogs&quot;, in 1996.

On May 5, 2011, Silverstone gave birth to a son. In March 2012, she received media attention for uploading a video of herself feeding chewed food to her son from her own mouth.

Jarecki and Silverstone separated in February 2018. In May 2018, she filed for divorce, and it was finalized in November 2018.

<text>Liza of Lambeth (1897) was W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s first novel, which he wrote while he was a medical student and obstetric clerk at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital in Lambeth, then a working-class district of London. It depicts the short life and death of Liza Kemp, an 18-year-old factory worker who lives with her aging mother in the fictional Vere Street off Westminster Bridge Road (real) in Lambeth.

==Plot summary==

The action covers a period of roughly four months—from August to November—in a year in the 1890s. Liza Kemp is an 18-year-old factory worker and the youngest of a large family, now living alone with her aging mother. Very popular with all the residents of Vere Street, Lambeth, she likes Tom, a boy her age, but not as much as he likes her, so she rejects him when he proposes. Nevertheless, she is persuaded to join a party of 32 who make a coach trip (in a horse-drawn coach, of course) to a nearby village on the August Bank Holiday Monday. Some of the other members of the party are Tom; Liza&#x27;s friend Sally and her boyfriend Harry; and Jim Blakeston, a 40-year-old father of 5 who has recently moved to Vere Street with his large family, and his wife (while their eldest daughter, Polly, is taking care of her siblings). The outing is fun, and they all get drunk on beer. On their way back in the dark, Liza realises that Jim is making a pass at her by holding her hand. Back home, Jim manages to speak to her alone and to steal a kiss from her.

Liza feels attracted to Jim. They never appear together in public because they do not want the other residents of Vere Street or their workmates to start talking about them. One of Jim&#x27;s first steps to win Liza&#x27;s heart is to go to a melodramatic play with her on Saturday night. Afterwards, they have sex. When autumn arrives and the nights get chillier, Liza&#x27;s secret meetings with Jim become less comfortable and more trying; they must meet in the third-class waiting-room of Waterloo station. To Liza&#x27;s dismay, people do start talking about them despite their precautions. Only Liza&#x27;s mother, a drunkard and a simple person, doesn&#x27;t know about their affair. After Sally gets married, she soon becomes pregnant. With Sally married and stuck at home, and even Tom seemingly shunning her, Liza feels increasingly isolated, but her love for Jim keeps her going. They do talk about their love affair: about the possibility of Jim leaving his wife and children (&quot;I dunno if I could get on without the kids&quot;); about Liza not being able to leave her mother, who needs her help; about living somewhere else &quot;as if we was married&quot;. Soon the situation deteriorates completely; Mrs Blakeston, who is pregnant again, opposes Jim&#x27;s affair with Liza by refusing to talk to him, then goes around telling other people what she would do with Liza if she caught her, and those people inform Liza, who is frightened. One Saturday afternoon in November, Liza is on her way home from work when the angry Mrs. Blakeston confronts her, spits in her face, and physically attacks her. Quickly a crowd gathers, not to abate the fight, but to abet it. (&quot;The audience shouted and cheered and clapped their hands.&quot;)

Eventually, both Tom and Jim stop the fight, and Tom walks Liza home. Liza is now publicly stigmatised as a &quot;wrong one&quot;, a fact she herself admits to Tom (&quot;Oh, but I &#x27;ave treated yer bad. I&#x27;m a regular wrong &#x27;un, I am&quot;). Tom wants to marry Liza, but she tells him that &quot;it&#x27;s too lite now&quot; because she thinks she is pregnant. Tom says he wouldn&#x27;t mind that, but she insists on refusing. Meanwhile, at the Blakestons&#x27; house, Jim beats his wife. Other residents hear them and young Polly appeals to some for help, but they choose not to interfere in other people&#x27;s domestic problems (&quot;She&#x27;ll git over it; an&#x27; p&#x27;raps she deserves it, for all you know&quot;). When Mrs Kemp comes home and sees her daughter&#x27;s injuries, all she does is offer her some alcohol (whiskey or gin). That evening they both get drunk. During the next night Liza has a miscarriage. Mr Hodges, who lives upstairs, fetches a doctor from the nearby hospital, who soon says he can do nothing for her. While her daughter is dying, Mrs Kemp has a long talk with Mrs Hodges, a midwife and sick-nurse. Liza&#x27;s last visitor is Jim, but Liza is already in a coma. Mrs Kemp and Mrs Hodges are talking about the funeral arrangements when they hear Liza&#x27;s death rattle and the doctor declares her dead.

==Theatrical adaptations==
A musical based – albeit loosely – on the novel was written by Willie Rushton and Berny Stringle, with music by Cliff Adams. It opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London in June 1976, and ran for 110 performances. It was produced by Ben Arbeid, directed by Berny Stringle, musically directed by John Burrows, and starred Angela Richards (best known as a regular in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Secret Army&quot;) in the title role, Patricia Hayes, Ron Pember, Bryan Marshall, Christopher Neil, Tina Martin, Michael Robbins and Eric Shilling.

The musical style is predominantly music hall, but the show includes a parody of Gilbert and Sullivan, a church choir arrangement with some completely incongruous lyrics (&quot;A Little Bit on the Side&quot;), and some touching ballads.

&quot;The Tart with a Heart of Gold&quot; was cut from the West End production, and is also missing from the original London cast recording (Thames THA 100), despite it describing the entire &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; of one of the main female characters.

The musical has not been officially published for amateur performance, but it is occasionally licensed for amateurs. The world amateur premiere was performed at the Erith Playhouse in Erith, Kent, in June 1977, and was attended by members of the London production team. The rights to this musical are currently held by Thames Music in London.

<doc id="69933" wikidata="Q938245" url="?curid=69933" title="Vanguard-class submarine">
<text>The &quot;Vanguard&quot; class is a class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) in service with the Royal Navy. The class was introduced in 1994 as part of the Trident nuclear programme, and comprises four vessels: , , and , built between 1986 and 1999 at Barrow-in-Furness by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering, now owned by BAE Systems. All four boats are based at HM Naval Base Clyde (HMS &quot;Neptune&quot;), west of Glasgow, Scotland.

Since the decommissioning of the Royal Air Force WE.177 free-fall thermonuclear weapons during March 1998, the four &quot;Vanguard&quot; submarines are the sole platforms for the United Kingdom&#x27;s nuclear weapons. Each submarine is armed with up to 16 UGM-133 Trident II missiles. The class is scheduled to be replaced starting in the early 2030s with the &quot;Dreadnought&quot;-class submarine.

==Development==
===Trident programme===

Beginning in the late 1960s, the United Kingdom operated four s, each armed with sixteen US-built UGM-27 Polaris missiles. The Polaris missile was supplied to Britain following the terms of the 1963 Polaris Sales Agreement. This nuclear deterrent system was known as the UK Polaris programme. In the early 1980s the British government began studies examining options for replacing the &quot;Resolution&quot;-class submarines and their Polaris missiles, both of which would be approaching the end of their service lives within little over a decade. On 24 January 1980, the House of Commons backed government policy, by 308 votes to 52, to retain an independent nuclear deterrent. Options that were examined included:
*A British designed and built ballistic missile; Although Britain had had no capability in this field since the 1960s, it was considered &quot;not to be impossible&quot;. However, it would be very expensive, would be full of uncertainty and would not be available within the required time period. Thus the option was considered &quot;unattractive&quot;.
*Retain Polaris, but fitted on a new submarine class; This option would have a cheaper &quot;initial capital cost&quot;, but would lack in terms of required capability and reliability. Also, it was concluded that any initial capital savings would have been lost beyond the 1990s, due to the high cost of sustaining a small stockpile of bespoke missiles kept only in British service.

A European solution and the US UGM-73 Poseidon were also briefly considered, but ultimately rejected, primarily on capability, cost and uncertainty grounds. The clear favourite was the UGM-96 Trident I, which as well as being a cost-effective solution – given the US would also operate the missile in vast numbers – also delivered the overall best long-term capability insurances against Soviet advancements in ballistic missile defence. Subsequently, on 10 July 1980, the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wrote to US President Jimmy Carter requesting the purchase of Trident I missiles on a similar basis as the 1963 Polaris Sales Agreement. However, following the acceleration of the US UGM-133 Trident II missiles, Thatcher wrote to US President Ronald Reagan in 1982 requesting the United Kingdom be allowed to procure the improved system instead. An agreement was made in March 1982 between the two countries, and under the agreement, Britain made a 5% research and development contribution.

===Design and construction===

The &quot;Vanguard&quot; class were designed in the early 1980s by the Ministry of Defence, acting in one of its last Royal Navy warship design authority roles. The guidance drawings were then supplied for detailed design development by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering (VSEL) based at Barrow-in-Furness, now BAE Systems Maritime – Submarines. They were designed from the outset as nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, able to accommodate the UGM-133 Trident II missiles. As such, the missile compartment is based on the same system used on the American , which is also equipped with the UGM-133 Trident II. This requirement led to the &quot;Vanguard&quot;-class design being significantly larger than the previous Polaris-equipped &quot;Resolution&quot; class, and at nearly 16,000 tonnes they are the largest submarines ever built for the Royal Navy.

Due to the large size of the &quot;Vanguard&quot;-class, the Devonshire Dock Hall in Barrow-in-Furness was built between 1982 and 1986 specifically for the construction of the boats.

Beginning in 1985, both HMNB Clyde and the Royal Naval Armaments Depot Coulport at Faslane underwent extensive redevelopment in preparation for the &quot;Vanguard&quot; class submarines and Trident II missiles. Rosyth dockyard also underwent significant redevelopment. The work included enhanced &quot;handling, storage, armament processing, berthing, docking, engineering, training and refitting facilities&quot; at an estimates cost of £550 million.

Prime Minister Thatcher laid the keel of the first boat, HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot;, on 3 September 1986 at the Devonshire Dock Hall. &quot;Vanguard&quot; was launched in 1992 and commissioned in 1993. The year 1992 saw a debate over whether the fourth vessel, &quot;Vengeance&quot;, should be cancelled; however, the Ministry of Defence ultimately ordered it in July 1992 and it was commissioned in 1999.

===Replacement===
The Vanguard class had an originally intended service life of 25 years. This would put the retirement dates for the class at 2018, 2020, 2021, 2024.

On 4 December 2006, then Prime Minister Tony Blair revealed plans to spend up to £20 billion on a new generation of ballistic missile submarines to replace the &quot;Vanguard&quot; class. In order to reduce costs and show Britain&#x27;s commitment to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Blair suggested that submarine numbers could be cut from four to three, while the number of nuclear warheads would be cut by 20% to 160. On 23 September 2009, then Prime Minister Gordon Brown confirmed that this reduction to three submarines was still under consideration. In February 2011, the Defence Secretary Liam Fox stated that four submarines would be needed if the UK was to retain a credible nuclear deterrent. On 18 May 2011 the British government approved the initial assessment phase for the construction of a new class of four submarines, paving the way for the ordering of the first long-lead items and preparations for the main build to begin in the future. This new class of submarine, now known as the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; class, will retain the current Trident II missiles, and will incorporate a new &#x27;PWR3&#x27; nuclear reactor as well as technology developed for the nuclear-powered fleet submarines of the Royal Navy.

A vote on the Trident renewal programme was held in the House of Commons on 18 July 2016, and determined that the UK should proceed with construction of the next generation of submarines. The motion passed with a significant majority of 472 MPs voting in favour and 117 against. The MoD put the cost of building, testing and commissioning the replacement vessels at £31 billion (plus a contingency fund of £10 billion) over 35 years, or about 0.2 per cent of government spending, or 6 per cent of defence spending, every year. It is expected the new fleet of submarines will come into operation starting 2028 at the earliest and certainly by the 2030s. The &quot;Dreadnought&quot; class will extend the life of the Trident programme until at least the 2060s.

==Characteristics==
===Weapons and systems===

The &quot;Vanguard&quot;-class submarines are equipped with 16 ballistic missile tubes. However, as of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the Royal Navy loads only eight of the missile tubes with the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missiles, each armed with up to eight nuclear warheads. In addition to the missile tubes, the submarines are fitted with four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes and carry the Spearfish heavyweight torpedo, allowing them to engage submerged or surface targets at ranges up to . Two SSE Mark 10 launchers are also fitted, allowing the boats to deploy Type 2066 and Type 2071 decoys, and a UAP Mark 3 electronic support measures (ESM) intercept system is carried.

The submarines carry the Thales Underwater Systems Type 2054 composite sonar. The Type 2054 is a multi-mode, multi-frequency system, which incorporates the 2046, 2043 and 2082 sonars. The Type 2043 is a hull-mounted active/passive search sonar, the Type 2082 a passive intercept and ranging sonar, and the Type 2046 a towed array sonar operating at very low frequency providing a passive search capability. The fleet is in the process of having the sonars refitted to include open-architecture processing using commercial off-the-shelf technology. Navigational search capability is provided by a Type 1007 I-band navigation radar. They will also be fitted with the new Common Combat System. Two periscopes are carried, a CK51 search model and a CH91 attack model. Both have TV and thermal imaging cameras in addition to conventional optics.

A specialised Submarine Command System (SMCS) was originally developed for the &quot;Vanguard&quot; boats and was later used on the .

===Propulsion===
A new pressurised water reactor, the Rolls-Royce PWR 2, was designed for the &quot;Vanguard&quot; class. The PWR 2 has double the service life of previous models, and it is estimated that a &quot;Vanguard&quot;-class submarine could circumnavigate the world 40 times without refuelling. Furthermore, during their long-overhaul refit periods, a &#x27;Core H&#x27; reactor is fitted to each of the boats, ensuring that none of the submarines will require further re-fuelling for the rest of their service lives. The reactor drives two GEC steam turbines linked to a single shaft pump jet propulsor, giving the submarines a maximum submerged speed of over . Auxiliary power is provided by a pair of 6 MW steam-turbine generators supplied by WH Allen, (later known as NEI Allen, Allen Power &amp; Rolls-Royce), and two 905 kWb Paxman diesel generators for provision of backup power supply.

===Nuclear warheads===
British nuclear weapons are designed and developed by the UK&#x27;s Atomic Weapons Establishment. The boats are capable of deploying with a maximum of 192 independently targetable warheads, or MIRVs, with immediate readiness to fire. However, as a result of a decision taken by the 1998 Strategic Defence Review this was reduced to 48 warheads with a readiness to fire reduced &#x27;to days rather than minutes&#x27;. Furthermore, the total number of warheads maintained by the United Kingdom was reduced to approximately 200, with a total of 58 Trident missiles. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review reduced this number further and the submarines will put to sea in future with a reduced total of 40 warheads and a reduced missile load of 8 (from a maximum possible 16). The number of operationally available nuclear warheads is to be reduced &#x27;from fewer than 160 to no more than 120 and the total UK nuclear weapon stockpile will number no more than 180.

On 16 March 2021 Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled his government&#x27;s 10-year plan to boost international trade and deploy soft power around the world with an aspiration of creating a “Global Britain”. In a document called &quot;Global Britain in a competitive age&quot;, this plan raised the cap on the number of nuclear warheads aboard the Royal Navy&#x27;s Trident submarines from 180 to 260. The document also vowed to maintain a fleet of four nuclear-armed submarines so Britain would always have one at sea. Information of number of deployed warheads and missiles would also no longer be provided following the 2021 Integrated Review, under a policy of &quot;deliberate ambiguity&quot;.

==Boats of the class==

==In fiction==
The 2021 BBC TV series &quot;Vigil&quot; is set on board a fictional &quot;Vanguard&quot;-class submarine named HMS &quot;Vigil&quot;. Further boats of the class named HMS &quot;Virtue&quot;, HMS &quot;Vanquish&quot; along with the real HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot; are mentioned.

<doc id="69936" wikidata="Q983351" url="?curid=69936" title="Isaac D'Israeli">
<text>Isaac D&#x27;Israeli (11 May 1766 – 19 January 1848) was a British writer, scholar and the father of British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli. He is best known for his essays and his associations with other men of letters.

==Life and career==
Isaac was born in Enfield, Middlesex, England, the only child of Benjamin D&#x27;Israeli, a Sephardic Jewish merchant who had immigrated from Cento, Italy, in 1748, and his second wife, Sarah Syprut de Gabay Villa Real. Isaac received much of his education in Leiden. At the age of 16, he began his literary career with some verses addressed to Samuel Johnson. He became a frequent guest at the table of the publisher John Murray and became one of the noted bibliophiles of the time.

In 1797 D&#x27;Israeli published &quot;Vaurien&quot;, a romantic novel set in radical circles following the French Revolution. Conservative commentators praised the book for its mockery of radicals in England and depiction of Vaurien, who has come from France to foment revolution. Yet they were perturbed by his depiction of a prostitute, who is kindly and was forced into prostitution to feed her family after her husband was ruined by a litigious neighbour for stealing an apple. Moreover, they were shocked by a chapter in which Disraeli launched a staunch defence of the Jewish community condemning the way Jews were treated in England.

On 10 February 1802, D&#x27;Israeli married Maria Basevi, who came from another London merchant family of Italian-Jewish descent. The marriage was a happy one, producing five children: Sarah (&quot;Sa&quot;; 1802–1859); Benjamin (&quot;Ben&quot; or &quot;Dizzy&quot;; 1804–1881); Naphtali (b. 1807, died in infancy); Raphael (&quot;Ralph&quot;; 1809–1898); and Jacobus (&quot;James&quot; or &quot;Jem&quot;; 1813–1868). The children were named according to Jewish customs and the boys were all circumcised. Religiously, however, Isaac D&#x27;Israeli appears to have set aside his Jewish beliefs. In the midst of an eight-year dispute with the Bevis Marks Synagogue and on the advice of his friend, historian Sharon Turner, all his children were baptised into the Church of England in 1817. In 1833 he published a severely critical analysis of contemporary Judaism, &quot;The Genius of Judaism&quot;. He himself did not receive baptism, however, and never indicated any desire to exchange Judaism for Christianity. He did attend the inauguration ceremonies of the Reform Synagogue at Burton Street, London.

He penned a handful of English adaptations of traditional tales from the Middle East, wrote a few historical biographies, and published a number of poems. His most popular work was a collection of essays entitled &quot;Curiosities of Literature&quot;. The work contained myriad anecdotes about historical persons and events, unusual books, and the habits of book-collectors. The work was very popular and sold widely in the 19th century, reaching its eleventh edition (the last to be revised by the author) in 1839. It was still in print when the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; entry was written in 1911. His book &quot;The Life and Reign of Charles I&quot; (1828) resulted in his being awarded the degree of D.C.L. from the University of Oxford.

In 1841, he became blind and, though he underwent an operation, his sight was not restored. He continued writing with his daughter as his amanuensis. In this way he produced &quot;Amenities of Literature&quot; (1841) and completed the revision of his work on Charles I. He died of influenza at age 81, at his home, Bradenham House, in Buckinghamshire, less than a year after the death of his wife in the spring of 1847.

D&#x27;Israeli&#x27;s daughter-in-law, the wife of his eldest son, Benjamin, erected a monument to him in June 1862 following his death. It stands on a hill near Hughenden Manor, the Disraelis&#x27; country house in Buckinghamshire.

<text>Nuclear pulse propulsion or external pulsed plasma propulsion is a hypothetical method of spacecraft propulsion that uses nuclear explosions for thrust. It originated as Project &quot;Orion&quot; with support from DARPA, after a suggestion by Stanislaw Ulam in 1947. Newer designs using inertial confinement fusion have been the baseline for most later designs, including Project &quot;Daedalus&quot; and Project &quot;Longshot&quot;.

==History==

===Los Alamos===
Calculations for a potential use of this technology were made at the laboratory from and toward the close of the 1940s to the mid-1950s.

===Project Orion===

Project Orion was the first serious attempt to design a nuclear pulse rocket. A design was formed at General Atomics during the late 1950s and early 1960s, with the idea of reacting small directional nuclear explosives utilizing a variant of the Teller–Ulam two-stage bomb design against a large steel pusher plate attached to the spacecraft with shock absorbers. Efficient directional explosives maximized the momentum transfer, leading to specific impulses in the range of seconds, or about thirteen times that of the Space Shuttle main engine. With refinements a theoretical maximum specific impulse of (1 MN·s/kg) might be possible. Thrusts were in the millions of tons, allowing spacecraft larger than 8 tons to be built with 1958 materials.

The reference design was to be constructed of steel using submarine-style construction with a crew of more than 200 and a vehicle takeoff weight of several thousand tons. This single-stage reference design would reach Mars and return in four weeks from the Earth&#x27;s surface (compared to 12 months for NASA&#x27;s current chemically powered reference mission). The same craft could visit Saturn&#x27;s moons in a seven-month mission (compared to chemically powered missions of about nine years). Notable engineering problems that occurred were related to crew shielding and pusher-plate lifetime.

Although the system appeared to be workable, the project was shut down in 1965, primarily because the Partial Test Ban Treaty made it illegal; in fact, before the treaty, the US and Soviet Union had already separately detonated a combined number of at least nine nuclear bombs, including thermonuclear, in space, i.e., at altitudes of over 100 km (see high-altitude nuclear explosions). Ethical issues complicated the launch of such a vehicle within the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere: calculations using the (disputed) linear no-threshold model of radiation damage showed that the fallout from each takeoff would cause the death of approximately 1 to 10 individuals. In a threshold model, such extremely low levels of thinly distributed radiation would have no associated ill-effects, while under hormesis models, such tiny doses would be negligibly beneficial. The use of less efficient clean nuclear bombs for achieving orbit and then more efficient, higher yield dirtier bombs for travel would significantly reduce the amount of fallout caused from an Earth-based launch.

One useful mission would be to deflect an asteroid or comet on collision course with the Earth, depicted dramatically in the 1998 film &quot;Deep Impact&quot;. The high performance would permit even a late launch to succeed, and the vehicle could effectively transfer a large amount of kinetic energy to the asteroid by simple impact. The prospect of an imminent asteroid impact would obviate concerns over the few predicted deaths from fallout. An automated mission would remove the challenge of designing a shock absorber that would protect the crew.

Orion is one of very few interstellar space drives that could theoretically be constructed with available technology, as discussed in a 1968 paper, &quot;Interstellar Transport&quot; by Freeman Dyson.

===Project Daedalus===

Project Daedalus was a study conducted between 1973 and 1978 by the British Interplanetary Society (BIS) to design an interstellar uncrewed spacecraft that could reach a nearby star within about 50 years. A dozen scientists and engineers led by Alan Bond worked on the project. At the time fusion research appeared to be making great strides, and in particular, inertial confinement fusion (ICF) appeared to be adaptable as a rocket engine.

ICF uses small pellets of fusion fuel, typically lithium deuteride (6Li2H) with a small deuterium/tritium trigger at the center. The pellets are thrown into a reaction chamber where they are hit on all sides by lasers or another form of beamed energy. The heat generated by the beams explosively compresses the pellet to the point where fusion takes place. The result is a hot plasma, and a very small &quot;explosion&quot; compared to the minimum size bomb that would be required to instead create the necessary amount of fission.

For Daedalus, this process was to be run within a large electromagnet that formed the rocket engine. After the reaction, ignited by electron beams, the magnet funnelled the hot gas to the rear for thrust. Some of the energy was diverted to run the ship&#x27;s systems and engine. In order to make the system safe and energy efficient, Daedalus was to be powered by a helium-3 fuel collected from Jupiter.

===&quot;Medusa&quot;===

The &quot;Medusa&quot; design has more in common with solar sails than with conventional rockets. It was envisioned by Johndale Solem in the 1990s and published in the &quot;Journal of the British Interplanetary Society&quot; (JBIS).

A &quot;Medusa&quot; spacecraft would deploy a large sail ahead of it, attached by independent cables, and then launch nuclear explosives forward to detonate between itself and its sail. The sail would be accelerated by the plasma and photonic impulse, running out the tethers as when a fish flees a fisher, generating electricity at the &quot;reel&quot;. The spacecraft would use some of the generated electricity to reel itself up toward the sail, constantly smoothly accelerating as it goes.

In the original design, multiple tethers connected to multiple motor generators. The advantage over the single tether is to increase the distance between the explosion and the tethers, thus reducing damage to the tethers.

For heavy payloads, performance could be improved by taking advantage of lunar materials, for example, wrapping the explosive with lunar rock or water, stored previously at a stable Lagrange point.

&quot;Medusa&quot; performs better than the classical Orion design because its sail intercepts more of the explosive impulse, its shock-absorber stroke is much longer, and its major structures are in tension and hence can be quite lightweight. &quot;Medusa&quot;-type ships would be capable of a specific impulse of (500 to 1000 kN·s/kg).

&quot;Medusa&quot; became widely known to the public in the BBC documentary film &quot;To Mars By A-Bomb: The Secret History of Project Orion&quot;. A short film shows an artist&#x27;s conception of how the &quot;Medusa&quot; spacecraft works &quot;by throwing bombs into a sail that&#x27;s ahead of it&quot;.

===Project Longshot===

Project Longshot was a NASA-sponsored research project carried out in conjunction with the US Naval Academy in the late 1980s. &quot;Longshot&quot; was in some ways a development of the basic Daedalus concept, in that it used magnetically funneled ICF. The key difference was that they felt that the reaction could not power both the rocket and the other systems, and instead included a 300 kW conventional nuclear reactor for running the ship. The added weight of the reactor reduced performance somewhat, but even using LiD fuel it would be able to reach neighboring star Alpha Centauri in 100 years (approx. velocity of 13,411 km/s, at a distance of 4.5 light years, equivalent to 4.5% of light speed).

===Antimatter-catalyzed nuclear reaction===
In the mid-1990s, research at Pennsylvania State University led to the concept of using antimatter to catalyze nuclear reactions. Antiprotons would react inside the nucleus of uranium, releasing energy that breaks the nucleus apart as in conventional nuclear reactions. Even a small number of such reactions can start the chain reaction that would otherwise require a much larger volume of fuel to sustain. Whereas the &quot;normal&quot; critical mass for plutonium is about 11.8 kilograms (for a sphere at standard density), with antimatter catalyzed reactions this could be well under one gram.

Several rocket designs using this reaction were proposed, some which would use all-fission reactions for interplanetary missions, and others using fission-fusion (effectively a very small version of Orion&#x27;s bombs) for interstellar missions.

===Magneto-inertial fusion===

NASA funded MSNW LLC and the University of Washington in 2011 to study and develop a fusion rocket through the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts NIAC Program.

The rocket uses a form of magneto-inertial fusion to produce a direct thrust fusion rocket. Magnetic fields cause large metal rings to collapse around the deuterium-tritium plasma, triggering fusion. The energy heats and ionizes the shell of metal formed by the crushed rings. The hot ionized metal is shot out of a magnetic rocket nozzle at a high speed (up to 30 km/s). Repeating this process roughly every minute would accelerate or decelerate the spacecraft. The fusion reaction is not self-sustaining and requires electrical energy to explode each pulse. With electrical requirements estimated to be between 100 kW to 1,000 kW (300 kW average), designs incorporate solar panels to produce the required energy.

Foil Liner Compression creates fusion at the proper energy scale. The proof of concept experiment in Redmond, Washington, was to use aluminum liners for compression. However, the ultimate design was to use lithium liners.

Performance characteristics are dependent on the fusion energy gain factor achieved by the reactor. Gains were expected to be between 20 and 200, with an estimated average of 40. Higher gains produce higher exhaust velocity, higher specific impulse and lower electrical power requirements. The table below summarizes different performance characteristics for a theoretical 90-day Mars transfer at gains of 20, 40, and 200.

By April 2013, MSNW had demonstrated subcomponents of the systems: heating deuterium plasma up to fusion temperatures and concentrating the magnetic fields needed to create fusion. They planned to put the two technologies together for a test before the end of 2013.

===Pulsed fission-fusion propulsion===
Pulsed fission-fusion (PuFF) propulsion is reliant on principles similar to magneto-inertial fusion. It aims to solve the problem of the extreme stress induced on containment by an Orion-like motor by ejecting the plasma obtained from small fuel pellets that undergo autocatalytic fission and fusion reactions initiated by a Z-pinch. It is a theoretical propulsion system researched through the NIAC Program by the University of Alabama in Huntsville. It is in essence a fusion rocket that uses a Z-pinch configuration, but coupled with a fission reaction to boost the fusion process.

A PuFF fuel pellet, around 1 cm in diameter, consists of two components: A deuterium-tritium (D-T) cylinder of plasma, called the &quot;target&quot;, which undergoes fusion, and a surrounding U-235 sheath that undergoes fission enveloped by a lithium liner. Liquid lithium, serving as a moderator, fills the space between the D-T cylinder and the uranium sheath. Current is run through the liquid lithium, a Lorentz force is generated which then compresses the D-T plasma by a factor of 10 in what is known as a Z-pinch. The compressed plasma reaches criticality and undergoes fusion reactions. However, the fusion energy gain (&quot;Q&quot;) of these reactions is far below breakeven (&quot;Q&quot; &lt; 1), meaning that the reaction consumes more energy than it produces.

In a PuFF design, the fast neutrons released by the initial fusion reaction induce fission in the U-235 sheath. The resultant heat causes the sheath to expand, increasing its implosion velocity onto the D-T core and compressing it further, releasing more fast neutrons. Those again amplify the fission rate in the sheath, rendering the process autocatalytic. It is hoped that this results in a complete burn up of both the fission and fusion fuels, making PuFF more efficient than other nuclear pulse concepts. Much like in a magneto-inertial fusion rocket, the performance of the engine is dependent on the degree to which the fusion gain of the D-T target is increased.

One &quot;pulse&quot; consist of the injection of a fuel pellet into the combustion chamber, its consumption through a series of fission-fusion reactions, and finally the ejection of the released plasma through a magnetic nozzle, thus generating thrust. A single pulse is expected to take only a fraction of a second to complete.

<doc id="69939" wikidata="Q938102" url="?curid=69939" title="Elliptic function">
<text>In the mathematical field of complex analysis, elliptic functions are special kinds of meromorphic functions, that satisfy two periodicity conditions. They are named elliptic functions because they come from elliptic integrals. Those integrals are in turn named elliptic because they first were encountered for the calculation of the arc length of an ellipse.

Important elliptic functions are Jacobi elliptic functions and the Weierstrass formula_1-function.

Further development of this theory led to hyperelliptic functions and modular forms.

== Definition ==
A meromorphic function is called an elliptic function, if there are two formula_2-linear independent complex numbers formula_3 such that

: formula_4 and formula_5.

So elliptic functions have two periods and are therefore doubly periodic functions.

== Period lattice and fundamental domain ==
If formula_6 is an elliptic function with periods formula_7 it also holds that

: formula_8

for every linear combination formula_9 with formula_10.

The abelian group

: formula_11

is called the &quot;period lattice&quot;.

The parallelogram generated by formula_12and formula_13

: formula_14

is a &quot;fundamental domain&quot; of formula_15 acting on formula_16.

Geometrically the complex plane is tiled with parallelograms. Everything that happens in one fundamental domain repeats in all the others. For that reason we can view elliptic function as functions with the quotient group formula_17 as their domain. This quotient group, called an elliptic curve, can be visualised as a parallelogram where opposite sides are identified, which topologically is a torus.

== Liouville&#x27;s theorems ==
The following three theorems are known as &quot;Liouville&#x27;s theorems (1847).&quot;

=== 1st theorem ===
A holomorphic elliptic function is constant.

This is the original form of Liouville&#x27;s theorem and can be derived from it. A holomorphic elliptic function is bounded since it takes on all of its values on the fundamental domain which is compact. So it is constant by Liouville&#x27;s theorem.

=== 2nd theorem ===
Every elliptic function has finitely many poles in formula_17 and the sum of its residues is zero.

This theorem implies that there is no elliptic function not equal to zero with exactly one pole of order one or exactly one zero of order one in the fundamental domain.

=== 3rd theorem ===
A non-constant elliptic function takes on every value the same number of times in formula_17 counted with multiplicity.

==Weierstrass ℘-function==
One of the most important elliptic functions is the Weierstrass formula_1-function. For a given period lattice formula_15 it is defined by

: formula_22

It is constructed in such a way that it has a pole of order two at every lattice point. The term formula_23 is there to make the series convergent.

formula_1 is an even elliptic function; that is, formula_25.

Its derivative

: formula_26

is an odd function, i.e. formula_27

One of the main results of the theory of elliptic functions is the following: Every elliptic function with respect to a given period lattice formula_15 can be expressed as a rational function in terms of formula_1 and formula_30.

The formula_1-function satisfies the differential equation

: formula_32

where formula_33 and formula_34 are constants that depend on formula_15. More precisely, formula_36 and formula_37, where formula_38 and formula_39 are so called Eisenstein series.

In algebraic language, the field of elliptic functions is isomorphic to the field

: formula_40,

where the isomorphism maps formula_1 to formula_42 and formula_30 to formula_44.

== Relation to elliptic integrals ==
The relation to elliptic integrals has mainly a historical background. Elliptic integrals had been studied by Legendre, whose work was taken on by Niels Henrik Abel and Carl Gustav Jacobi.

Abel discovered elliptic functions by taking the inverse function formula_45 of the elliptic integral function

: formula_46

with formula_47.

Additionally he defined the functions

: formula_48

and

: formula_49.

After continuation to the complex plane they turned out to be doubly periodic and are known as Abel elliptic functions.

Jacobi elliptic functions are similarly obtained as inverse functions of elliptic integrals.

Jacobi considered the integral function

: formula_50

and inverted it: formula_51. formula_52 stands for &quot;sinus amplitudinis&quot; and is the name of the new function. He then introduced the functions &quot;cosinus amplitudinis&quot; and &quot;delta amplitudinis&quot;, which are defined as follows:

: formula_53

: formula_54.

Only by taking this step, Jacobi could prove his general transformation formula of elliptic integrals in 1827.

== History ==
Shortly after the development of infinitesimal calculus the theory of elliptic functions was started by the Italian mathematician Giulio di Fagnano and the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler. When they tried to calculate the arc length of a lemniscate they encountered problems involving integrals that contained the square root of polynomials of degree 3 and 4. It was clear that those so called elliptic integrals could not be solved using elementary functions. Fagnano observed an algebraic relation between elliptic integrals, what he published in 1750. Euler immediately generalized Fagnano&#x27;s results and posed his algebraic addition theorem for elliptic integrals.

Except for a comment by Landen his ideas were not pursued until 1786, when Legendre published his paper &quot;Mémoires sur les intégrations par arcs d’ellipse&quot;. Legendre subsequently studied elliptic integrals and called them &quot;elliptic functions&quot;. Legendre introduced a three-fold classification –three kinds– which was a crucial simplification of the rather complicated theory at that time. Other important works of Legendre are: &quot;Mémoire sur les transcendantes elliptiques&quot; (1792), &quot;Exercices de calcul intégral&quot; (1811–1817), &quot;Traité des fonctions elliptiques&quot; (1825–1832). Legendre&#x27;s work was mostly left untouched by mathematicians until 1826.

Subsequently, Niels Henrik Abel and Carl Gustav Jacobi resumed the investigations and quickly discovered new results. At first they inverted the elliptic integral function. Following a suggestion of Jacobi in 1829 these inverse functions are now called &quot;elliptic functions&quot;. One of Jacobi&#x27;s most important works is &quot;Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum&quot; which was published 1829. The addition theorem Euler found was posed and proved in its general form by Abel in 1829. In those days the theory of elliptic functions and the theory of doubly periodic functions were considered to be different theories. They were brought together by Briot and Bouquet in 1856. Gauss discovered many of the properties of elliptic functions 30 years earlier but never published anything on the subject.

<text>The Prix Goncourt (, , &quot;The Goncourt Prize&quot;) is a prize in French literature, given by the académie Goncourt to the author of &quot;the best and most imaginative prose work of the year&quot;. The prize carries a symbolic reward of only 10 euros, but results in considerable recognition and book sales for the winning author. Four other prizes are also awarded: prix Goncourt du Premier Roman (first novel), prix Goncourt de la Nouvelle (short story), prix Goncourt de la Poésie (poetry) and prix Goncourt de la Biographie (biography). Of the &quot;big six&quot; French literary awards, the Prix Goncourt is the best known and most prestigious. The other major literary prizes include the , the Prix Femina, the , the Prix Interallié and the Prix Médicis.

==History==

Edmond de Goncourt, a successful author, critic, and publisher, bequeathed his estate for the foundation and maintenance of the Académie Goncourt. In honour of his brother and collaborator, Jules Alfred Huot de Goncourt (1830–1870), the académie has awarded the Prix Goncourt every December since 1903. The jury that determines the winner meets at the &quot;Drouant&quot; restaurant in November to make its decision. Notable winners of the prize include Marcel Proust (&quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;), Simone de Beauvoir (&quot;The Mandarins&quot;), André Malraux (&quot;Man&#x27;s Fate&quot;) and Marguerite Duras (&quot;The Lover&quot;).

The award was initially established to provide talented new authors with a monetary award that would allow them to write a second book. Today, the Goncourt has a token prize amount (around 10 euros), about the same amount given in 1903, and so the prestige of the prize has been explained not because of the cash-value of the prize, but &quot;in terms of the tremendous book sales it effects: the Goncourt winner becomes an instant millionaire.&quot; Hervé Le Tellier&#x27;s &quot;The Anomaly&quot;, which won the Goncourt in 2020, exceeded a million copies in less than a year after its publication.

In 1987, the Prix Goncourt des Lycéens was established, as a collaboration between the académie Goncourt, the French Ministry of Education, and Fnac, a book, music, and movie retailer.

The is announced at the same ceremony as the Prix Goncourt. It has become known as something of a second-place prize.

===Controversies===

Within months of the first prize in 1903, it spawned a &quot;hostile counter-prize&quot; in the form of the Prix Femina to counter the all-male Jury of the Goncourt with an all-female jury on the Femina.

Some choices have been controversial, a famous example was Marcel Proust in 1919; it was met with indignation by the public since many believed that the prize should have gone to Roland Dorgelès for &quot;Les Croix de bois&quot;, a novel about the First World War. The prize was supposed to be awarded to promising young authors, whereas Proust was not considered &quot;young&quot; at 48 – however Proust was a beginning author which is the only eligibility requirement, age being unimportant.

In 1921, Rene Maran won the Goncourt with &quot;Batouala, veritable roman negre&quot;, the first French novel to openly criticize European colonialism in Africa. The novel caused &quot;violent reactions&quot; and was banned in all the French colonies.

In 1932, the prize was controversial for passing up Louis-Ferdinand Céline&#x27;s &quot;Voyage au bout de la nuit&quot; for Guy Mazeline&#x27;s &quot;Les Loups&quot;. The voting process became the basis of the 1992 book &quot;Goncourt 32&quot; by Eugène Saccomano.

Although the award may only be given to an author once, Romain Gary won it twice, in 1956 for &quot;Les racines du ciel&quot; and again under the pseudonym Émile Ajar in 1975 for &quot;La vie devant soi&quot;. The Académie Goncourt awarded the prize to Ajar without knowing his real identity. A period of literary intrigue followed. Gary&#x27;s cousin&#x27;s son Paul Pavlowitch posed as the author for a time. Gary later revealed the truth in his posthumous book &quot;Vie et mort d&#x27;Émile Ajar&quot;.

In September 2021, the Goncourt attracted controversy after the jury decided, by a vote of 7 to 3, to include &quot;Les enfants de Cadillac&quot; by François Noudelmann on its 2021 list of finalists. Noudelmann is the partner of Camille Laurens, who is a member of the prize&#x27;s jury. Laurens voted in favor of her partner&#x27;s book. In October 2021, the Académie Goncourt ultimately decided that it will no longer allow lovers and family members of the jury to be entered for consideration.

== Selection and voting process ==
The Prix Goncourt is divided into three selection stages. The first selection is typically composed of fifteen finalists. The second selection is typically composed of eight finalists, narrowed down from the previous fifteen. A third and final selection leaves four finalists.

In the voting rounds, a maximum of fourteen rounds can be carried out. To begin the deliberation process, the names of the four finalists are placed in a champagne bucket. In turn, the names are taken out and each member of the jury votes aloud in favour of, or in opposition to, the writer. An absolute majority—more than half the votes cast—is required until the tenth round, then a simple majority is sufficient to designate a winner. If, after fourteen rounds, there is no winner, the president&#x27;s vote counts as double to determine a majority vote. At 12:45p.m., the Secretary General, currently Philippe Claudel, appears in front of the crowd of journalists and announces the winner. The winner typically waits in a cafe near the &quot;Drouant&quot; so that they can arrive in time. The winner is interviewed by the media and is offered a symbolic check for ten euros.

== Winners ==
==Other awards==
In addition to the Prix Goncourt for a novel, the Academy awards four other awards, for first novel, short story, biography and poetry.

As of March 2009, the académie changed the award name by dropping &quot;bourses&quot; (&quot;scholarship&quot;) from the title. The prefix &quot;prix&quot; can be included or not, such as &quot;Prix Goncourt de la Poésie&quot; (Goncourt prize for Poetry) or &quot;Goncourt de la Poésie&quot; (Goncourt of Poetry). For example: &quot;Claude Vigée was awarded a Goncourt de la Poésie in 2008&quot;. Or, &quot;Claude Vigée won the 2008 prix Goncourt de la Poésie&quot;.

The award titles are:

<text>The Breviary of Alaric (&quot;Breviarium Alaricianum&quot; or &quot;Lex Romana Visigothorum&quot;) is a collection of Roman law, compiled by Roman jurists and issued by referendary Anianus on the order of Alaric II, King of the Visigoths, with the approval of his bishops and nobles. It was promulgated on 2 February 506, the 22nd year of his reign. It applied, not to the Visigothic nobles who lived under their own law, which had been formulated by Euric, but to the Hispano-Roman and Gallo-Roman population, living under Visigoth rule south of the Loire and, in Book 16, to the members of the trinitarian Catholic Church; the Visigoths were Arian and maintained their own clergy.

==Significance==
It is termed a code (&quot;codex&quot;), in the certificate of Anianus, the king&#x27;s referendary, but unlike the code of Justinian, from which the writings of jurists were excluded, it comprises both imperial constitutions (&quot;leges&quot;) and juridical treatises (&quot;jura&quot;). From the circumstance that the &quot;Breviarium&quot; has prefixed to it a royal rescript (&quot;commonitorium&quot;) directing that copies of it, certified under the hand of Anianus, should be received exclusively as law throughout the kingdom of the Visigoths, the compilation of the code has been attributed to Anianus by many writers, and it is frequently designated the &quot;Breviary of Anianus&quot; (&quot;Breviarium Aniani&quot;).

The code, however, appears to have been known amongst the Visigoths by the title of &quot;Lex Romana&quot; or &quot;Lex Theodosii&quot;, and it was not until the 16th century that the title of &quot;Breviarium&quot; was introduced to distinguish it from a recast of the code, the &quot;Lex Romana Curiensis&quot; which was introduced into northern Italy in the 9th century for the use of the Romans in Lombardy. This recast of the Visigothic code was published in the 18th century for the first time by Paolo Canciani in his collection of ancient laws entitled &quot;Barbarorum Leges Antiquae&quot;. Another manuscript of this Lombard recast of the Visigothic code was discovered by Gustav Friedrich Hänel in the library of St Gall.

The chief value of the Visigothic code is as a source for Roman Law, including the first five books of the &quot;Theodosian Code&quot; (&quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot;), five books of the &quot;Sententiae Receptae&quot; of Julius Paulus. Until the discovery of a manuscript in the chapter library in Verona, which contained the greater part of the &quot;Institutes&quot; of Gaius, it was the only known work containing the institutional writings of Gaius, an important ancient Roman jurist.

The &quot;Breviary&quot; had the effect of preserving the traditions of Roman law in Aquitania and Gallia Narbonensis, which became both Provence and Septimania, thus reinforcing their sense of enduring continuity, broken in the Frankish north.

==Contents==
The &quot;Breviary of Alaric&quot; comprises:
* sixteen books of the &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot;; 
* the novels (decrees) of –
** Theodosius II, 
** Valentinian III, 
** Marcian, 
** Majorian and 
** Libius Severus; 
* the institutes of Gaius; 
* five books of the &quot;Sententiae Receptae&quot; of Julius Paulus;
* thirteen titles of the &quot;Codex Gregorianus&quot;; 
* two titles of the &quot;Codex Hermogenianus&quot;; and 
* a fragment of the first book of the &quot;Responsa Papiniani&quot;.

<text>Joseph Neil Schulman (; April 16, 1953 – August 10, 2019) was an American novelist who wrote &quot;Alongside Night&quot; (published 1979) and &quot;The Rainbow Cadenza&quot; (published 1983) which both received the Prometheus Award, a libertarian science fiction award. His third novel, &quot;Escape from Heaven&quot;, was also a finalist for the 2002 Prometheus Award. His fourth and last novel, &quot;The Fractal Man,&quot; was a finalist for the 2019 Prometheus Award.

==Biography==
Schulman was born in Forest Hills, Queens on April 16, 1953. He was the author of nine other books currently in print, including a short story collection, &quot;Nasty, Brutish, and Short Stories&quot;, &quot;Stopping Power: Why 70 Million Americans Own Guns&quot;, and &quot;The Robert Heinlein Interview and Other Heinleiniana&quot;.

He wrote the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Profile in Silver&quot;, first broadcast on CBS March 7, 1986. Schulman died on August 10, 2019, at the age of 66, three days after suffering a pulmonary embolism.

==Filmmaking==
Schulman was the writer, director, executive producer (along with Nichelle Nichols) of the movie &quot;Lady Magdalene&#x27;s&quot;, which was produced by Schulman&#x27;s own company Jesulu Productions. The movie won three film-festival awards: &quot;Best Cutting Edge Film&quot; at the 2008 San Diego Black Film Festival, &quot;Audience Choice – Feature-Length Narrative Film&quot; at the 2008 Cinema City International Film Festival held on the Universal Hollywood Citywalk, and &quot;Special Jury Prize for Libertarian Ideals&quot; at the 2011 Anthem Film Festival/FreedomFest held at Bally&#x27;s Las Vegas.

In 2013, Schulman completed production on a feature-film of &quot;Alongside Night&quot;, starring Kevin Sorbo, Jake Busey, Tim Russ, Garrett Wang, Mara Marini, and Gary Graham. The movie premiered in 2014 and had a limited theatrical release. It was released for streaming on iTunes, Amazon Video and Amazon Prime and as a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack.

==Views==
Schulman was a known proponent of the anarchist philosophy agorism, which was developed by Samuel Edward Konkin III.

<doc id="69954" wikidata="Q2194606" url="?curid=69954" title="Sywell">
<text>Sywell is a village and civil parish in North Northamptonshire, England. At the 2011 Census, the population of the parish was 792.

The name Sywell is thought to mean &quot;seven wells&quot;.

==Facilities==
The facilities found in the village include:

*The church (St Peter &amp; St Paul)
*Sywell Aerodrome, opened in 1928 and active during World War II
*Sywell Aviation Museum at the aerodrome
*The Horseshoe pub
*Overstone Squash Club
*Overstone Solarium (caravan park)
*The Overstone Manor (family pub)
*Sywell Reservoir (redundant as a working reservoir and now a country park)
*Overstone Park Cricket Club
*Sywell CEVA Primary School

==Other==
The Ecton Lane part of the village is built just inside the walls of Overstone Hall; the estate wall is of fine quality and in village folklore is said to be seven feet high, be seven miles long and took seven men seven years to build.

==Pevsner on Sywell==

Church - this has a short tower dating to the 13th century. The pretty stair projection found in the west side of the church is not medieval as it appears. Renovations dating from the 1870s have left the church with an odd feel. There is a stained glass window by Thomas Willement dating from 1839, which is very fine. It uses heraldic glass dating from 1580.

Sywell Hall - the hall has a long straight front with two small and one larger gable ends. The house appears to originally date from Elizabethan times.

Village - many local houses were rebuilt by Lady Overstone in the 1860s - with the (old) school dating to 1861 and the rectory&#x27;s rebuilding to 1862.

The church&#x27;s plate dates from 1816 and is the work of Patten.

The airfield hosts an annual concert called &quot;Music in the Air&quot;. A combination of classical music and aviation.

==Links with the village from the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;==

<text>Hydrazine is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula . It is a simple pnictogen hydride, and is a colourless flammable liquid with an ammonia-like odour. Hydrazine is highly hazardous unless handled in solution as, for example, hydrazine hydrate ().

Hydrazine is mainly used as a foaming agent in preparing polymer foams, but applications also include its uses as a precursor to pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, as well as a long-term storable propellant for in-space spacecraft propulsion. Additionally, hydrazine is used in various rocket fuels and to prepare the gas precursors used in air bags. Hydrazine is used within both nuclear and conventional electrical power plant steam cycles as an oxygen scavenger to control concentrations of dissolved oxygen in an effort to reduce corrosion.
, approximately 120,000 tons of hydrazine hydrate (corresponding to a 64% solution of hydrazine in water by weight) were manufactured worldwide per year.

Hydrazines are a class of organic substances derived by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms in hydrazine by an organic group.

==Etymology and history==
The name &quot;hydrazine&quot; was coined by Emil Fischer in 1875; he was trying to produce organic compounds that consisted of mono-substituted hydrazine. By 1887, Theodor Curtius had produced hydrazine sulfate by treating organic diazides with dilute sulfuric acid; however, he was unable to obtain pure hydrazine, despite repeated efforts. Pure anhydrous hydrazine was first prepared by the Dutch chemist Lobry de Bruyn in 1895.

The nomenclature is a bi-valent form, with prefix &quot;hydr-&quot; used to indicate the presence of hydrogen atoms and suffix beginning with &quot;-az-&quot;, from &quot;azote&quot;, the French word for nitrogen.

==Applications==
===Gas producers and propellants===
The largest use of hydrazine is as a precursor to blowing agents. Specific compounds include azodicarbonamide and azobisisobutyronitrile, which produce of gas per gram of precursor. In a related application, sodium azide, the gas-forming agent in air bags, is produced from hydrazine by reaction with sodium nitrite.

Hydrazine is also used as a long-term storable propellant on board space vehicles, such as the &quot;Dawn&quot; mission to Ceres and Vesta, and to both reduce the concentration of dissolved oxygen in and control pH of water used in large industrial boilers. The F-16 fighter jet, Eurofighter Typhoon, Space Shuttle, and U-2 spy plane use hydrazine to fuel their Emergency Start System in the event of an engine stall.

===Precursor to pesticides and pharmaceuticals===
Hydrazine is a precursor to several pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Often these applications involve conversion of hydrazine to heterocyclic rings such as pyrazoles and pyridazines. Examples of commercialized bioactive hydrazine derivatives include cefazolin, rizatriptan, anastrozole, fluconazole, metazachlor, metamitron, metribuzin, paclobutrazol, diclobutrazole, propiconazole, hydrazine sulfate, diimide, triadimefon, and the diacylhydrazine insecticides.

Hydrazine compounds can be effective as active ingredients in insecticides, miticides, nematicides, fungicides, antiviral agents, attractants, herbicides, or plant growth regulators.

===Small-scale, niche, and research===

The Italian catalyst manufacturer Acta (chemical company) has proposed using hydrazine as an alternative to hydrogen in fuel cells. The chief benefit of using hydrazine is that it can produce over 200 mW/cm2 more than a similar hydrogen cell without requiring (expensive) platinum catalysts. Because the fuel is liquid at room temperature, it can be handled and stored more easily than hydrogen. By storing the hydrazine in a tank full of a double-bonded carbon-oxygen carbonyl, the fuel reacts and forms a safe solid called hydrazone. By then flushing the tank with warm water, the liquid hydrazine hydrate is released. Hydrazine has a higher electromotive force of 1.56 V compared to 1.23 V for hydrogen. Hydrazine breaks down in the cell to form nitrogen and hydrogen which bonds with oxygen, releasing water. Hydrazine was used in fuel cells manufactured by Allis-Chalmers Corp., including some that provided electric power in space satellites in the 1960s.

A mixture of 63% hydrazine, 32% hydrazine nitrate and 5% water is a standard propellant for experimental bulk-loaded liquid propellant artillery. The propellant mixture above is one of the most predictable and stable, with a flat pressure profile during firing. Misfires are usually caused by inadequate ignition. The movement of the shell after a mis-ignition causes a large bubble with a larger ignition surface area, and the greater rate of gas production causes very high pressure, sometimes including catastrophic tube failures (i.e. explosions). From January–June 1991, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory conducted a review of early bulk-loaded liquid propellant gun programs for possible relevance to the electrothermal chemical propulsion program.

The United States Air Force (USAF) regularly uses H-70, a 70% hydrazine 30% water mixture, in operations employing the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter aircraft and the Lockheed U-2 &quot;Dragon Lady&quot; reconnaissance aircraft. The single jet engine F-16 utilizes hydrazine to power its Emergency Power Unit (EPU), which provides emergency electrical and hydraulic power in the event of an engine flame out. The EPU activates automatically, or manually by pilot control, in the event of loss of hydraulic pressure or electrical power in order to provide emergency flight controls. The single jet engine U-2 utilizes hydrazine to power its Emergency Starting System (ESS), which provides a highly reliable method to restart the engine in flight in the event of a stall.

===Rocket fuel===

Hydrazine was first used as a component in rocket fuels during World War II. A 30% mix by weight with 57% methanol (named M-Stoff in the German Luftwaffe) and 13% water was called C-Stoff by the Germans. The mixture was used to power the Messerschmitt Me 163B rocket-powered fighter plane, in which the German high test peroxide &quot;T-Stoff&quot; was used as an oxidizer. Unmixed hydrazine was referred to as B-Stoff by the Germans, a designation also used later for the ethanol/water fuel for the V-2 missile.

Hydrazine is used as a low-power monopropellant for the maneuvering (RCS/Reaction control system) thrusters of spacecraft, and was used to power the Space Shuttle&#x27;s auxiliary power units (APUs). In addition, mono-propellant hydrazine-fueled rocket engines are often used in terminal descent of spacecraft. Such engines were used on the Viking program landers in the 1970s as well as the Mars landers &quot;Phoenix&quot; (May 2008), &quot;Curiosity&quot; (August 2012), and &quot;Perseverance&quot; (February 2021).

During the Soviet space program, unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (also discovered by Fischer in 1875) was used instead of hydrazine. Together with nitric oxidizers it became known as &quot;devil&#x27;s venom&quot; due to its highly dangerous nature.

In all hydrazine mono-propellant engines, the hydrazine is passed over a catalyst such as iridium metal supported by high-surface-area alumina (aluminium oxide), which causes it to decompose into ammonia (), nitrogen gas (), and hydrogen () gas according to the three following reactions:

: Reaction 1: 
: Reaction 2: 
: Reaction 3: 

The first two reactions are extremely exothermic (the catalyst chamber can reach 800 °C in a matter of milliseconds,) and they produce large volumes of hot gas from a small volume of liquid, making hydrazine a fairly efficient thruster propellant with a vacuum specific impulse of about 220 seconds. Reaction 2 is the most exothermic, but produces a smaller number of molecules than that of reaction 1. Reaction 3 is endothermic and reverts the effect of reaction 2 back to the same effect as reaction 1 alone (lower temperature, greater number of molecules). The catalyst structure affects the proportion of the that is dissociated in reaction 3; a higher temperature is desirable for rocket thrusters, while more molecules are desirable when the reactions are intended to produce greater quantities of gas.

Since hydrazine is a solid below 2 °C, it is not suitable as a general purpose rocket propellant for military applications. Other variants of hydrazine that are used as rocket fuel are monomethylhydrazine, , also known as MMH (melting point −52 °C), and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, , also known as UDMH (melting point −57 °C). These derivatives are used in two-component rocket fuels, often together with dinitrogen tetroxide, . A 50:50 mixture by weight of hydrazine and UDMH was used in the engine of the service propulsion system of the Apollo command and service module, both the ascent and descent engines of the Apollo Lunar Module and Titan II ICBMs and is known as Aerozine 50. These reactions are extremely exothermic, and the burning is also hypergolic (it starts burning without any external ignition).

There are ongoing efforts in the aerospace industry to find a replacement for hydrazine, given its potential ban across the European Union. Promising alternatives include nitrous oxide-based propellant combinations, with development being led by commercial companies Dawn Aerospace, Impulse Space, and Launcher. The first nitrous oxide-based system ever flown in space was by D-Orbit onboard their ION Satellite Carrier in 2021, using six Dawn Aerospace B20 thrusters. Another alternative is more safe blends of hydrazine with much lower vapor pressure, hence reduced inhalation hazard. Aerojet Rocketdyne has developed HPB-G28 blend that have 150 times lower vapor pressure, same specific impulse, and 35% higher density specific impulse than neat hydrazine. HPB-G28 can be used with same thrusters and catalysts as hydrazine, but has freezing point of -55°C, making propellant line heating unnecessary. It contains 65% (by mol) hydrazine, 27% hydroxyethylhydrazinuim nitrate (HEHN) and 8% hydrazinium nitrate.

== Occupational hazards ==
=== Health effects ===
Potential routes of hydrazine exposure include dermal, ocular, inhalation and ingestion.

Hydrazine exposure can cause skin irritation/contact dermatitis and burning, irritation to the eyes/nose/throat, nausea/vomiting, shortness of breath, pulmonary edema, headache, dizziness, central nervous system depression, lethargy, temporary blindness, seizures and coma. Exposure can also cause organ damage to the liver, kidneys and central nervous system. Hydrazine is documented as a strong skin sensitizer with potential for cross-sensitization to hydrazine derivatives following initial exposure. In addition to occupational uses reviewed above, exposure to hydrazine is also possible in small amounts from tobacco smoke.

The official U.S. guidance on hydrazine as a carcinogen is mixed but generally there is recognition of potential cancer-causing effects. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) lists it as a &quot;potential occupational carcinogen&quot;. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) finds it is &quot;reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen&quot;. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) grades hydrazine as &quot;A3—confirmed animal carcinogen with unknown relevance to humans&quot;. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grades it as &quot;B2—a probable human carcinogen based on animal study evidence&quot;.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) rates hydrazine as &quot;2A—probably carcinogenic to humans&quot; with a positive association observed between hydrazine exposure and lung cancer. Based on cohort and cross-sectional studies of occupational hydrazine exposure, a committee from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded that there is suggestive evidence of an association between hydrazine exposure and lung cancer, with insufficient evidence of association with cancer at other sites. The European Commission&#x27;s Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL) places hydrazine in carcinogen &quot;group B—a genotoxic carcinogen&quot;. The genotoxic mechanism the committee cited references hydrazine&#x27;s reaction with endogenous formaldehyde and formation of a DNA-methylating agent.

In the event of a hydrazine exposure-related emergency, NIOSH recommends removing contaminated clothing immediately, washing skin with soap and water, and for eye exposure removing contact lenses and flushing eyes with water for at least 15 minutes. NIOSH also recommends anyone with potential hydrazine exposure to seek medical attention as soon as possible. There are no specific post-exposure laboratory or medical imaging recommendations, and the medical work-up may depend on the type and severity of symptoms. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends potential exposures be treated symptomatically with special attention given to potential lung and liver damage. Past cases of hydrazine exposure have documented success with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) treatment.

=== Occupational exposure limits ===
* NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limit (REL): 0.03 ppm (0.04 mg/m3) 2-hour ceiling
* OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL): 1 ppm (1.3 mg/m3) 8-hour Time Weighted Average
* ACGIH Threshold Limit Value (TLV): 0.01 ppm (0.013 mg/m3) 8-hour Time Weighted Average

The odor threshold for hydrazine is 3.7 ppm, thus if a worker is able to smell an ammonia-like odor then they are likely over the exposure limit. However, this odor threshold varies greatly and should not be used to determine potentially hazardous exposures.

For aerospace personnel, the United States Air Force uses an emergency exposure guideline, developed by the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Toxicology, which is utilized for non-routine exposures of the general public and is called the Short-Term Public Emergency Exposure Guideline (SPEGL). The SPEGL, which does not apply to occupational exposures, is defined as the acceptable peak concentration for unpredicted, single, short-term emergency exposures of the general public and represents rare exposures in a worker&#x27;s lifetime. For hydrazine the 1-hour SPEGL is 2 ppm, with a 24-hour SPEGL of 0.08 ppm.

=== Handling and medical surveillance ===
A complete surveillance programme for hydrazine should include systematic analysis of biologic monitoring, medical screening and morbidity/mortality information. The CDC recommends surveillance summaries and education be provided for supervisors and workers. Pre-placement and periodic medical screening should be conducted with specific focus on potential effects of hydrazine upon functioning of the eyes, skin, liver, kidneys, hematopoietic, nervous and respiratory systems.

Common controls used for hydrazine include process enclosure, local exhaust ventilation and personal protective equipment (PPE). Guidelines for hydrazine PPE include non-permeable gloves and clothing, indirect-vent splash resistant goggles, face shield and in some cases a respirator. The use of respirators for the handling of hydrazine should be the last resort as a method of controlling worker exposure. In cases where respirators are needed, proper respirator selection and a complete respiratory protection program consistent with OSHA guidelines should be implemented.

For USAF personnel, Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) Standard 48-8, Attachment 8 reviews the considerations for occupational exposure to hydrazine in missile, aircraft and spacecraft systems. Specific guidance for exposure response includes mandatory emergency shower and eyewash stations and a process for decontaminating protective clothing. The guidance also assigns responsibilities and requirements for proper PPE, employee training, medical surveillance and emergency response. USAF bases requiring the use of hydrazine generally have specific base regulations governing local requirements for safe hydrazine use and emergency response.

==Molecular structure==
Hydrazine, , contains two amine groups connected by a single bond between the two nitrogen atoms. Each subunit is pyramidal. The structure of the free molecules was determined by gas electron diffraction and microwave spectroscopy. The N–N single bond length is 1.447(2) Å (144.7(2) pm), the N-H distance is 1.015(2) Å, the N-N-H angles are 106(2)° and 112(2)°, the H-N-H angle is 107°. The molecule adopts a gauche conformation with a torsion angle of 91(2)° (dihedral angle between the planes containing the N-N bond and the bisectors of the H-N-H angles). The rotational barrier is twice that of ethane. These structural properties resemble those of gaseous hydrogen peroxide, which adopts a &quot;skewed&quot; anticlinal conformation, and also experiences a strong rotational barrier.

The structure of solid hydrazine was determined by X-ray diffraction. In this phase the N-N bond has a length of 1.46 Å and the nearest non-bonded distances are 3.19, 3.25 and 3.30 Å.

==Synthesis and production==
Diverse synthetic pathways for hydrazine production have been developed. The key step is the creation of the N–N single bond. The many routes can be divided into those that use chlorine oxidants (and generate salt) and those that do not.

===Oxidation of ammonia via oxaziridines from peroxide===
Hydrazine can be synthesized from ammonia and hydrogen peroxide with a ketone catalyst, in a procedure called the Peroxide process (sometimes called Pechiney-Ugine-Kuhlmann process, the Atofina–PCUK cycle, or ketazine process). The net reaction is:

In this route, the ketone and ammonia first condense to give the imine, which is oxidised by hydrogen peroxide to the oxaziridine, a three-membered ring containing carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. Next, the oxaziridine gives the hydrazone by treatment with ammonia, which process creates the nitrogen-nitrogen single bond. This hydrazone condenses with one more equivalent of ketone. 
The resulting azine is hydrolyzed to give hydrazine and regenerate the ketone, methyl ethyl ketone:

Unlike most other processes, this approach does not produce a salt as a by-product.

===Chlorine-based oxidations===
The Olin Raschig process, first announced in 1907, produces hydrazine from sodium hypochlorite (the active ingredient in many bleaches) and ammonia without the use of a ketone catalyst. This method relies on the reaction of monochloramine with ammonia to create the N–N single bond as well as a hydrogen chloride byproduct:
 
Related to the Raschig process, urea can be oxidized instead of ammonia. Again sodium hypochlorite serves as the oxidant. The net reaction is shown:

The process generates significant by-products and is mainly practised in Asia.

The Bayer Ketazine Process is the predecessor to the peroxide process. It employs sodium hypochlorite as oxidant instead of hydrogen peroxide. Like all hypochlorite-based routes, this method produces an equivalent of salt for each equivalent of hydrazine.

==Reactions==
===Acid-base behavior===

Hydrazine forms a monohydrate that is denser (1.032 g/cm3) than the anhydrous form (1.021 g/cm3). Hydrazine has basic (alkali) chemical properties comparable to those of ammonia:
:, &quot;K&quot;b = 1.3 × 10−6, p&quot;K&quot;b = 5.9

(for ammonia &quot;K&quot;b = 1.78 × 10−5)

It is difficult to diprotonate:
:, &quot;K&quot;b = 8.4 × 10−16, p&quot;K&quot;b = 15

Exposure to extremely strong bases or alkali metals generates deprotonated hydrazide salts. Most explode on exposure to air or moisture.

===Redox reactions===
Ideally, the combustion of hydrazine in oxygen produces nitrogen and water:

An excess of oxygen gives oxides of nitrogen, including nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide:
:

The heat of combustion of hydrazine in oxygen (air) is 19.41 MJ/kg (8345 BTU/lb).

Hydrazine is a convenient reductant because the by-products are typically nitrogen gas and water. This property makes it useful as an antioxidant, an oxygen scavenger, and a corrosion inhibitor in water boilers and heating systems. It also directly reduces salts of less active metals (e.g., bismuth, arsenic, copper, mercury, silver, lead, platinum, and palladium) to the element. That property has commercial application in electroless nickel plating and plutonium extraction from nuclear reactor waste. Some colour photographic processes also use a weak solution of hydrazine as a stabilising wash, as it scavenges dye coupler and unreacted silver halides. Hydrazine is the most common and effective reducing agent used to convert graphene oxide (GO) to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via hydrothermal treatment.

===Hydrazinium salts===
Hydrazine can be protonated to form various solid salts of the hydrazinium cation , by treatment with mineral acids. A common salt is hydrazinium hydrogensulfate, . Hydrazinium hydrogensulfate was investigated as a treatment of cancer-induced cachexia, but proved ineffective.

Double protonation gives the hydrazinium dication or hydrazinediium, , of which various salts are known.

===Organic chemistry===
Hydrazines are part of many organic syntheses, often those of practical significance in pharmaceuticals (see applications section), as well as in textile dyes and in photography.

Hydrazine is used in the Wolff–Kishner reduction, a reaction that transforms the carbonyl group of a ketone into a methylene bridge (or an aldehyde into a methyl group) via a hydrazone intermediate. The production of the highly stable dinitrogen from the hydrazine derivative helps to drive the reaction.

Being bifunctional, with two amines, hydrazine is a key building block for the preparation of many heterocyclic compounds via condensation with a range of difunctional electrophiles. With 2,4-pentanedione, it condenses to give the 3,5-dimethylpyrazole. In the Einhorn-Brunner reaction hydrazines react with imides to give triazoles.

Being a good nucleophile, can attack sulfonyl halides and acyl halides. The tosylhydrazine also forms hydrazones upon treatment with carbonyls.

Hydrazine is used to cleave &quot;N&quot;-alkylated phthalimide derivatives. This scission reaction allows phthalimide anion to be used as amine precursor in the Gabriel synthesis.

====Hydrazone formation====
Illustrative of the condensation of hydrazine with a simple carbonyl is its reaction with acetone to give the acetone azine. The latter reacts further with hydrazine to yield acetone hydrazone:
:

The propanone azine is an intermediate in the Atofina-PCUK process. Direct alkylation of hydrazines with alkyl halides in the presence of base yields alkyl-substituted hydrazines, but the reaction is typically inefficient due to poor control on level of substitution (same as in ordinary amines). The reduction of hydrazones to hydrazines present a clean way to produce 1,1-dialkylated hydrazines.

In a related reaction, 2-cyanopyridines react with hydrazine to form amide hydrazides, which can be converted using 1,2-diketones into triazines.

===Biochemistry===
Hydrazine is the intermediate in the anaerobic oxidation of ammonia (anammox) process. It is produced by some yeasts and the open ocean bacterium anammox (&quot;Brocadia anammoxidans&quot;).

The false morel produces the poison gyromitrin which is an organic derivative of hydrazine that is converted to monomethylhydrazine by metabolic processes. Even the most popular edible &quot;button&quot; mushroom &quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot; produces organic hydrazine derivatives, including agaritine, a hydrazine derivative of an amino acid, and gyromitrin.

==In popular culture==
In the fictional book The Martian (also adapted to a feature film) the titular character uses an iridium catalyst to separate hydrogen gas from surplus hydrazine fuel, which he then burns to generate water for survival.

<text>A hypergolic propellant is a rocket propellant combination used in a rocket engine, whose components spontaneously ignite when they come into contact with each other.

The two propellant components usually consist of a fuel and an oxidizer. The main advantages of hypergolic propellants are that they can be stored as liquids at room temperature and that engines which are powered by them are easy to ignite reliably and repeatedly. Common hypergolic propellants are extremely toxic or corrosive, making them difficult to handle.

In contemporary usage, the terms &quot;hypergol&quot; and &quot;hypergolic propellant&quot; usually mean the most common such propellant combination: dinitrogen tetroxide plus hydrazine.

== History ==
The fact that turpentine may spontaneously combust when mixed with nitric acid was discovered as early as the late 17th century by Frederick Slare, however it remained a scientific curiosity for centuries until it was proposed to use it for rocket-assisted take off during WWII.

In 1935, Hellmuth Walter discovered that hydrazine hydrate was hypergolic with high-test peroxide of 80–83%. He was probably the first to discover this phenomenon, and set to work developing a fuel. Prof. Otto Lutz assisted the Walter Company with the development of &quot;C-Stoff&quot; which contained 30% hydrazine hydrate, 57% methanol, and 13% water, and spontaneously ignited with high strength hydrogen peroxide. BMW developed engines burning a hypergolic mix of nitric acid with various combinations of amines, xylidines and anilines.

Hypergolic propellants were discovered independently, for the second time, in the U.S. by GALCIT and Navy Annapolis researchers in 1940. They developed engines powered by aniline and red fuming nitric acid (RFNA). Robert Goddard, Reaction Motors, and Curtiss-Wright worked on aniline/nitric acid engines in the early 1940s, for small missiles and jet assisted take-off (JATO). The project resulted in the successful assisted take off of several Martin PBM and PBY bombers, but the project was disliked because of the toxic properties of both fuel and oxidizer, as well as the high freezing point of aniline. The second problem was eventually solved by the addition of small quantities of furfuryl alcohol to the aniline.
In Germany from the mid-1930s through World War II, rocket propellants were broadly classed as monergols, hypergols, non-hypergols and lithergols. The ending &quot;ergol&quot; is a combination of Greek &quot;ergon&quot; or work, and Latin &quot;oleum&quot; or oil, later influenced by the chemical suffix &quot;-ol&quot; from alcohol. Monergols were monopropellants, while non-hypergols were bipropellants which required external ignition, and lithergols were solid/liquid hybrids. Hypergolic propellants (or at least hypergolic ignition) were far less prone to hard starts than electric or pyrotechnic ignition. The &quot;hypergole&quot; terminology was coined by Dr. Wolfgang Nöggerath, at the Technical University of Brunswick, Germany.

The only rocket-powered fighter ever deployed was the Messerschmitt Me 163B &quot;Komet&quot;. The Komet had a HWK 109-509, a rocket motor which consumed methanol/hydrazine as fuel and high test peroxide &quot;T-Stoff&quot; as oxidizer. The hypergolic rocket motor had the advantage of fast climb and quick-hitting tactics at the cost of being very volatile and capable of exploding with any degree of inattention. Other proposed combat rocket fighters like the Heinkel &quot;Julia&quot; and reconnaissance aircraft like the DFS 228 were meant to use the Walter 509 series of rocket motors, but besides the Me 163, only the Bachem Ba 349 &quot;Natter&quot; vertical launch expendable fighter was ever flight-tested with the Walter rocket propulsion system as its primary sustaining thrust system for military-purpose aircraft.

The earliest ballistic missiles, such as the Soviet R-7 that launched Sputnik 1 and the U.S. Atlas and Titan-1, used kerosene and liquid oxygen. Although they are preferred in space launchers, the difficulties of storing a cryogen like liquid oxygen in a missile that had to be kept launch ready for months or years at a time led to a switch to hypergolic propellants in the U.S. Titan II and in most Soviet ICBMs such as the R-36. But the difficulties of such corrosive and toxic materials, including injury-causing leaks and the explosion of a Titan-II in its silo, led to their near universal replacement with solid-fuel boosters, first in Western submarine-launched ballistic missiles and then in land-based U.S. and Soviet ICBMs.

In the 1960s, late variants of French Véronique sounding rocket and the Vesta rocket, as well as the first stage of the first orbital SLV Diamant used the combination of nitric acid and turpentine discovered by Slare. It may also be used in amateur rocketry.

The Apollo Lunar Module, used in the Moon landings, employed hypergolic fuels in both the descent and ascent rocket engines. The Apollo spacecraft used the same combination for the Service Propulsion System. Those spacecraft and the Space Shuttle (among others) used hypergolic propellants for their reaction control systems.

The trend among Western space launch agencies is away from large hypergolic rocket engines and toward hydrogen/oxygen engines or methane/oxygen and RP-1/oxygen engines for various advantages and disadvantages. Ariane 1 through 4, with their hypergolic first and second stages (and optional hypergolic boosters on the Ariane 3 and 4) have been retired and replaced with the Ariane 5, which uses a first stage fueled by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The Titan II, III and IV, with their hypergolic first and second stages, have also been retired for the Atlas V (RP-1/oxygen) and Delta IV (hydrogen/oxygen). Hypergolic propellants are still used in upper stages, when multiple burn-coast periods are required, and in launch escape systems.

== Characteristics ==
=== Advantages ===
Hypergolically-fueled rocket engines are usually simple and reliable because they need no ignition system. Although larger hypergolic engines in some launch vehicles use turbopumps, most hypergolic engines are pressure-fed. A gas, usually helium, is fed to the propellant tanks under pressure through a series of check and safety valves. The propellants in turn flow through control valves into the combustion chamber; there, their instant contact ignition prevents a mixture of unreacted propellants from accumulating and then igniting in a potentially catastrophic hard start.

As hypergolic rockets do not need an ignition system, they can fire any number of times by simply opening and closing the propellant valves until the propellants are exhausted and are therefore uniquely suited for spacecraft maneuvering and well suited, though not uniquely so, as upper stages of such space launchers as the Delta II and Ariane 5, which must perform more than one burn. Restartable non-hypergolic rocket engines nevertheless exist, notably the cryogenic (oxygen/hydrogen) RL-10 on the Centaur and the J-2 on the Saturn V. The RP-1/LOX Merlin on the Falcon 9 can also be restarted.

The most common hypergolic fuels, hydrazine, monomethylhydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, and oxidizer, nitrogen tetroxide, are all liquid at ordinary temperatures and pressures. They are therefore sometimes called storable liquid propellants. They are suitable for use in spacecraft missions lasting many years. The cryogenity of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen has so far limited their practical use to space launch vehicles where they need to be stored only briefly. As the largest issue with the usage of cryogenic propellants in interplanetary space is boil-off, which is largely dependent on the scale of spacecraft, for larger craft such as Starship this is less of an issue.

Another advantage of hypergolic propellants is their high density compared to cryogenic propellants. LOX has a density of 1.14 g/ml, while on the other hand, hypergolic oxidizers such as nitric acid or nitrogen tetroxide have a density of 1.55 g/ml and 1.45 g/ml respectively. LH2 fuel offers extremely high performance, yet its density only warrants its usage in the largest of rocket stages, while mixtures of hydrazine and UDMH have a density at least ten times higher. This is of great importance in space probes, as the higher propellant density allows the size of their propellant tank to be reduced significantly, which in turn allows the probe to fit within a smaller payload fairing.

=== Disadvantages ===
Relative to their mass, traditional hypergolic propellants possess a lower calorific value than cryogenic propellant combinations like LH2 / LOX or LCH4 / LOX. A launch vehicle that uses hypergolic propellant must therefore carry a greater mass of fuel than one that uses these cryogenic fuels.

The corrosivity, toxicity, and carcinogenicity of traditional hypergolics necessitate expensive safety precautions. Failure to follow adequate safety procedures with an exceptionally dangerous UDMH-nitric acid propellant mixture nicknamed &quot;Devil&#x27;s Venom&quot;, for example, resulted in the deadliest rocketry accident in history, the Nedelin catastrophe.

== Hypergolic combinations ==

=== Common ===
Common hypergolic propellant combinations include:
* Aerozine 50 + nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) – widely used in historical American rockets, including the Titan II; all engines in the Apollo Lunar Module. Aerozine 50 is a mixture of 50% UDMH and 50% straight hydrazine (N2H4).
* Monomethylhydrazine (MMH) + nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) – smaller engines and reaction control thrusters: Apollo command and service module RCS, Space Shuttle OMS and RCS; Ariane 5 EPS; Draco thrusters used by the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.
* Triethylborane/triethylaluminium (TEA-TEB) + liquid oxygen – used during the ignition process of some rocket engines that use liquid oxygen, used by the SpaceX Merlin Engine Family and Rocketdyne F-1.
* Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) + nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) – frequently used by Roscosmos, such as in the Proton (rocket family), and supplied by them to France for the Ariane 1 first and second stages (replaced with UH 25); ISRO rockets using Vikas engine.

=== Less common or obsolete ===

Less-common or obsolete hypergolic propellants include:
* Aniline + nitric acid (unstable, explosive), used in the WAC Corporal 
* Aniline + hydrogen peroxide (dust-sensitive, explosive)
* Furfuryl alcohol + IRFNA (or red fuming nitric acid) – Copenhagen Suborbitals SPECTRA Engine
* Furfuryl alcohol + WFNA (or white fuming nitric acid)
* Hydrazine + nitric acid (toxic but stable), abandoned due to lack of reliable ignition. No engine with this combination ever went into mass production.
* Kerosene + (high-test peroxide + catalyst) – Gamma, with the peroxide first decomposed by a catalyst. Cold hydrogen peroxide and kerosene are not hypergolic, but concentrated hydrogen peroxide (referred to as high-test peroxide or HTP) run over a catalyst produces free oxygen and steam at over which is hypergolic with kerosene.
*Tonka (TG-02, approx. 50% triethylamine and 50% xylidine) typically oxidized with nitric acid or its anhydrous nitric oxide derivatives (AK-2x group in the Soviet Union) e.g. AK-20F (80% HNO3 and 20% N2O4 with inhibitor).
* T-Stoff (stabilized &gt;80% peroxide) + C-Stoff (methanol, hydrazine, water, catalyst) – Messerschmitt Me 163 World War II German rocket fighter aircraft, for its Walter 109-509A engine.
* Turpentine + IRFNA (flown in French Diamant A first-stage)
* UDMH + IRFNA – MGM-52 Lance missile system, Agena and Able Upper Stages, Isayev-built maneuvering engines.

=== Proposed, remain unflown ===

* Chlorine trifluoride (ClF3) + all known fuels – Briefly considered as an oxidizer given its high hypergolicity with all standard fuels, but ultimately abandoned in the 70s due to the difficulty of handling the substance safely. Chlorine trifluoride is known to burn concrete and gravel. Chlorine pentafluoride (ClF5) presents the same hazards, but offers higher specific impulse than ClF3.
* Pentaborane(9) and diborane + nitrogen tetroxide – Pentaborane(9), a so-called Zip fuel, was studied by Soviet Rocket Scientist V. P. Glushko for usage in combination with nitrogen tetroxide in the RD-270M rocket engine. This propellant combination would have yielded a significant increase in performance, but was ultimately given up due to toxicity concerns.
* Tetramethylethylenediamine + IRFNA – A sightly less toxic alternative to Hydrazine and its derivatives.

Pyrophoric substances, which ignite spontaneously in the presence of air, are also sometimes used as rocket fuels themselves or to ignite other fuels. For example a mixture of triethylborane and triethylaluminium (which are both separately and even more so together pyrophoric), was used for engine starts in the SR-71 Blackbird and in the F-1 engines on the Saturn V rocket and is used in the Merlin engines on the SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets.

<doc id="69971" wikidata="Q26773" url="?curid=69971" title="Hornbill">
<text>Hornbills are birds found in tropical and subtropical Africa, Asia and Melanesia of the family Bucerotidae. They are characterized by a long, down-curved bill which is frequently brightly coloured and sometimes has a horny casque on the upper mandible. Hornbills have a two-lobed kidney. They are the only birds in which the first and second neck vertebrae (the atlas and axis respectively) are fused together; this probably provides a more stable platform for carrying the bill. The family is omnivorous, feeding on fruit and small animals. They are monogamous breeders nesting in natural cavities in trees and sometimes cliffs. A number of mainly insular species of hornbill with small ranges are threatened with extinction, mainly in Southeast Asia.

In the Neotropical realm, toucans occupy the hornbills&#x27; ecological niche, an example of convergent evolution. Despite their close appearances, the two groups are not very closely related, with toucans being allied with the woodpeckers, honeyguides and several families of barbet, while hornbills (and their close relatives the ground hornbills) are allied with the hoopoes and wood-hoopoes.

==Description==

Hornbills show considerable variation in size and colors. The smallest species is the black dwarf hornbill (&quot;Tockus hartlaubi&quot;), at and in length. The largest and most massive species appears to be the southern ground hornbill which has an average weight of , and can weigh up to and span about across the wings. Other species rival the southern ground species in length, at up to about , including the Abyssinian ground hornbill (&quot;Bucorvus abyssinicus&quot;), the great hornbill (&quot;Buceros bicornis&quot;) and, probably the longest of all (perhaps exceeding ) thanks in part to its extended tail feathers, the helmeted hornbill (&quot;Rhinoplax vigil&quot;). Males are always bigger than the females, though the extent to which this is true varies according to species. The extent of sexual dimorphism also varies with body parts. For example, the difference in body mass between males and females is 1–17%, but the variation is 8–30% for bill length and 1–21% in wing length.

The most distinctive feature of the hornbills is the heavy bill, supported by powerful neck muscles as well as by the fused vertebrae. The large bill assists in fighting, preening, constructing the nest, and catching prey. A feature unique to the hornbills is the casque, a hollow structure that runs along the upper mandible. In some species it is barely perceptible and appears to serve no function beyond reinforcing the bill. In other species it is quite large, is reinforced with bone, and has openings between the hollow centre, allowing it to serve as a resonator for calls. In the helmeted hornbill the casque is not hollow but is filled with hornbill ivory and is used as a battering ram in dramatic aerial jousts. Aerial casque-butting has also been reported in the great hornbill.

The plumage of hornbills is typically black, grey, white, or brown, and is frequently offset by bright colours on the bill, or by patches of bare coloured skin on the face or wattles. Some species exhibit sexual dichromatism, where the colouration of soft parts varies by sex.
Hornbills possess binocular vision, although unlike most birds with this type of vision, the bill intrudes on their visual field. This allows them to see their own bill tip and aids in precision handling of food objects with their bill. The eyes are also protected by large eyelashes which act as a sunshade.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Bucerotidae include about 55 living species, though a number of cryptic species may yet be split, as has been suggested for the red-billed hornbill. Their distribution includes Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent to the Philippines and the Solomon Islands, but no genus is found in &quot;both&quot; Africa and Asia. Most are arboreal birds, but the large ground hornbills (&quot;Bucorvus&quot;), as their name implies, are terrestrial birds of open savanna. Of the 24 species found in Africa, 13 are birds of the more open woodlands and savanna, and some occur even in highly arid environments; the remaining species are found in dense forests. This contrasts with Asia, where a single species occurs in open savanna and the remainder are forest species. The Indian subcontinent has 10 species of hornbills, of which 9 are found in India and adjoining countries, while the Sri Lanka grey hornbill is restricted to the island. The most common widespread species in the Indian subcontinent is the Indian grey hornbill.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Indonesia has 13 hornbill species: 9 of them exist in Sumatra, and the rest exist in Sumba, Sulawesi, Papua and Kalimantan. Kalimantan has the same hornbill species as Sumatra, except that the great hornbill is not found there. Meanwhile, the neighboring archipelago of the Philippines has 11 hornbill species, all of which are endemic to certain small islands of the country, making them one of the most endangered hornbills in the world. In the Neogene (at least in the late Miocene), hornbills inhabited North Africa and South Europe. Their remains have been found in Morocco and Bulgaria. The oldest known hornbill is from the Early Miocene of Uganda, around 19 million years ago, which is similar to modern &quot;Tockus.&quot;

==Behaviour and ecology==
Hornbills are diurnal, generally travelling in pairs or small family groups. Larger flocks sometimes form outside the breeding season. The largest assemblies of hornbills form at some roosting sites, where as many as 2400 individual birds may be found.

===Diet===

Hornbills are omnivorous birds, eating fruit, insects and small animals. They cannot swallow food caught at the tip of the beak as their tongues are too short to manipulate it, so they toss it back to the throat with a jerk of the head. While both open country and forest species are omnivorous, species that specialise in feeding on fruit are generally found in forests, while the more carnivorous species are found in open country. Forest-dwelling species of hornbills are considered to be important seed dispersers. Some hornbill species (e.g., Malabar pied-hornbill) even have a great preference for the fruits of the strychnine tree (&quot;Strychnos nux-vomica&quot;), which contain the potent poison strychnine.

Some hornbills defend a fixed territory. Territoriality is related to diet; fruit sources are often patchily distributed and require long-distance travel to find. Thus, species that specialise in fruit are less territorial.

===Breeding===
Hornbills generally form monogamous pairs, although some species engage in cooperative breeding. The female lays up to six white eggs in existing holes or crevices, either in trees or rocks. The cavities are usually natural, but some species may nest in the abandoned nests of woodpeckers and barbets. Nesting sites may be used in consecutive breeding seasons by the same pair. Before incubation, the females of all Bucerotinae—sometimes assisted by the male—begin to close the entrance to the nest cavity with a wall made of mud, droppings and fruit pulp. When the female is ready to lay her eggs, the entrance is just large enough for her to enter the nest, and after she has done so, the remaining opening is also all but sealed shut. There is only one narrow aperture, big enough for the male to transfer food to the mother and eventually the chicks. The function of this behaviour is apparently related to protecting the nesting site from rival hornbills. The sealing can be done in just a few hours; at most it takes a few days. After the nest is sealed, the hornbill takes another five days to lay the first egg. Clutch size varies from one or two eggs in the larger species to up to eight eggs for the smaller species. During the incubation period the female undergoes a complete and simultaneous moult. It has been suggested that the darkness of the cavity triggers a hormone involved in moulting. Non-breeding females and males go through a sequential moult. When the chicks and the female are too big to fit in the nest, the mother breaks out the nest and both parents feed the chicks. In some species the mother rebuilds the wall, whereas in others the chicks rebuild the wall unaided. The ground hornbills do not adopt this behaviour, but are conventional cavity-nesters.

===Associations with other species===
A number of hornbills have associations with other animal species. For example, some species of hornbills in Africa have a mutualistic relationship with dwarf mongooses, foraging together and warning each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators. Other relationships are commensal, for example following monkeys or other animals and eating the insects flushed up by them.

==Taxonomy==
The family Bucerotidae was introduced (as Buceronia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815; it comes from the genus name Buceros given by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 from the Greek word &quot;bōukeros&quot; which means &quot;cow horn&quot;.

There are two subfamilies: the Bucorvinae contain the two ground hornbills in a single genus, and the Bucerotinae contain all other taxa. Traditionally they are included in the order Coraciiformes (which includes also kingfishers, rollers, hoopoes and bee-eaters). In the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, however, hornbills are separated from the Coraciiformes into an order of their own, Bucerotiformes, with the subfamilies elevated to family level. Given that they are almost as distant from the rollers, kingfishers and allies as are the trogons, the arrangement chosen is more a matter of personal taste than any well-established taxonomic practice. All that can be said with reasonable certainty is that placing the hornbills outside the Coraciiformes and the trogons inside would be incorrect.

Genetic data suggests that ground hornbills and &quot;Bycanistes&quot; form a clade outside the rest of the hornbill lineage. They are thought to represent an early African lineage, while the rest of Bucerotiformes evolved in Asia. However, another study claims that the ground hornbills diverged first, followed by &quot;Tockus&quot;. Within &quot;Tockus&quot;, two clades have been identified based on genetics and vocal types—&#x27;whistlers&#x27; and &#x27;cluckers&#x27;. The &#x27;cluckers&#x27; have been placed in a separate genus, &quot;Lophoceros&quot;.

&quot;Bycanistes&quot; belongs to a clade of mostly African species that also includes &quot;Ceratogymna&quot; and &quot;Tropicranus&quot;. Another member of this clade is the Black dwarf hornbill. The Black dwarf hornbill is typically classified in the genus &quot;Tockus&quot; but in this study, is a sister species to the White-crested hornbill. If these two species are classified in congeneric, &quot;Tropicranus&quot; becomes a junior synonym of &quot;Horizocerus&quot;, as that was one of the old names used for the Black dwarf hornbill. This clade also includes one Southeast Asian species, the white-crowned hornbill.

As for the other Asian hornbill species, &quot;Buceros&quot; and &quot;Rhinoplax&quot; are each other&#x27;s closest relatives, &quot;Anorrhinus&quot; is part of a clade that has &quot;Ocyceros&quot; and &quot;Anthracoceros&quot; as sister taxa, and &quot;Aceros&quot;, &quot;Rhyticeros&quot;, and &quot;Penelopides&quot; form another clade. However, according to this study, &quot;Aceros&quot; is polyphyletic; the rufous-headed hornbill, writhed hornbill, and wrinkled hornbill form a clade with the Sulawesi hornbill, and are in turn more closely related to &quot;Penelopides&quot;. These four species have been classified in a separate genus, &quot;Rhabdotorrhinus&quot;. Similarly, the knobbed hornbill is more closely related to &quot;Rhyticeros&quot;, leaving the rufous-necked hornbill the only member of the genus &quot;Aceros&quot;.

The following cladogram showing the relationships between the genera is based on a molecular phylogenetic study by Juan-Carlos Gonzalez and collaborators that was published in 2013. The number of species in each genus is taken from the list of world birds maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union.


=== Fossil record ===
* &quot;Bucorvus brailloni&quot; – Late Miocene (Morocco)
* &quot;Euroceros bulgaricus&quot; – Late Miocene (Bulgaria)
* &quot;Tockus&quot; sp. – Early Miocene (Uganda)

Some scientist believe the hornbill evolutionary tree spread from the Indian microcontinent after Gondwana, before India merged with Asia.

==Cultural significance==
Most species&#x27; casques are very light, containing much airspace. However, the helmeted hornbill has a solid casque made of a material called hornbill ivory, which is greatly valued as a carving material in China and Japan. It was used as a medium for the art of netsuke. Also used for hunting purposes in places like India. The Iban people of Borneo regards the Rhinoceros hornbill (known as Kenyalang) as the king of the worldly birds, who acts as the intermediary between the man and the God. 
The Wreathed hornbill (Undan) is believed by the Iban people to be the guide of dead souls to the lower world.

==Status and conservation==
None of the African species of hornbills are seriously threatened, but many Asian hornbills are threatened by hunting and habitat loss, as they tend to require primary forest. Among these threatened species, only the plain-pouched hornbill and rufous-necked hornbill are found on the Asian mainland; all others are insular in their distribution. In the Philippines alone, the Palawan hornbill is vulnerable, and the Mindoro is endangered. The Visayan hornbill is classified as endangered by the IUCN, but considered critically endangered by the National List of Threatened Terrestrial Fauna of the Philippines. A subspecies of the Visayan hornbill, the Ticao hornbill, was declared extinct in 2013. Two of the three critically endangered hornbills, the rufous-headed hornbill and the Sulu hornbill, are also restricted to the Philippines. The latter species is one of the world&#x27;s rarest birds, with only 20 breeding pairs or 40 mature individuals, and faces imminent extinction. The other critically endangered species, the helmeted hornbill, is threatened by uncontrolled hunting and the trade in hornbill ivory.

==In popular culture==
A hornbill named Zazu is the king&#x27;s adviser and one of the characters in &quot;The Lion King&quot; franchise, voiced by Rowan Atkinson in the original 1994 version and John Oliver in the remade 2019 version.

Hornbill was used as the official mascot of one of Malaysia&#x27;s political parties, the Democratic Action Party.

The Rhinoceros hornbill is the official state animal of Sarawak, a Malaysian state located in Borneo.

The great hornbill, a member of the hornbill family, is the official state bird of Kerala, an Indian state. The species is rated vulnerable.

<text>The First Sino-Japanese War (25 July 189417 April 1895), or the First China–Japan War, was a conflict between the Qing dynasty of China and the Empire of Japan primarily over influence in Korea. In Chinese it is commonly known as the Jiawu War. After more than six months of unbroken successes by Japanese land and naval forces and the loss of the ports of Lüshunkou (Port Arthur) and Weihaiwei, the Qing government sued for peace in February 1895 and signed the unequal Treaty of Shimonoseki two months later, ending the war. 

In the late 19th century, Korea remained one of China&#x27;s tributary states, while Japan viewed it as a target of imperial expansion. In June 1894, the Qing government, at the request of the Korean emperor Gojong, sent 2,800 troops to aid in suppressing the Donghak Peasant Revolution. The Japanese considered this a violation of the 1885 Convention of Tientsin, and sent an expeditionary force of 8,000 troops, which landed at Incheon. This army moved to Seoul, seized the Korean emperor, and set up a pro-Japanese government on 23 July 1894 in the occupation of Gyeongbokgung. The Qing government decided to withdraw its troops, but rejected recognition of the pro-Japanese government, which had granted the Imperial Japanese Army the right to expel the Chinese Huai Army from Korea. About 3,000 Chinese troops still remained in Korea, and could be supplied only by sea; on 25 July, the Japanese Navy won the Battle of Pungdo and sank the steamer &quot;Kowshing&quot;, which was carrying 1,200 Qing reinforcements. A declaration of war followed on 1 August.

Following the Battle of Pyongyang on 15 September, the Chinese troops retreated to Manchuria, allowing the Japanese to take over Korea. Two days later, the Beiyang Fleet suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of the Yalu River, with its surviving ships retreating to Port Arthur. In October 1894, the Japanese Army invaded Manchuria, and captured Port Arthur on 21 November. Japan next captured Weihaiwei on the Shandong Peninsula on 12 February 1895. This gave them control over the approaches to Beijing, and the Qing court began negotiations with Japan in early March. The war concluded with the Treaty of Shimonoseki on 17 April, which required China to pay a massive indemnity and to cede the island of Taiwan to Japan. Japan also gained a predominant position in Korea.

The war demonstrated the failure of the Qing dynasty&#x27;s attempts to modernise its military and fend off threats to its sovereignty, especially when compared with Japan&#x27;s successful Meiji Restoration. For the first time, regional dominance in East Asia shifted from China to Japan; the prestige of the Qing dynasty, along with the classical tradition in China, suffered a major blow. The loss of Korea as a tributary state sparked an unprecedented public outcry. Within China, the defeat was a catalyst for a series of political upheavals led by Sun Yat-sen and Kang Youwei, culminating in the 1911 Revolution and ultimate end of dynastic rule in China.

== Names ==
The war is commonly known in China as the War of Jiawu (), referring to the year (1894) as named under the traditional sexagenary system of years. In Japan, it is called the . In Korea, where much of the war took place, it is called the Qing–Japan War (; Hanja: ).

==Background==
After two centuries, the Japanese policy of seclusion under the &quot;shōguns&quot; of the Edo period came to an end when the country was opened to trade by the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854. In the years following the Meiji Restoration of 1868 and the fall of the shogunate, the newly formed Meiji government embarked on reforms to centralise and modernise Japan. The Japanese had sent delegations and students around the world to learn and assimilate Western arts and sciences, with the intention of making Japan an equal to the Western powers. These reforms transformed Japan from a feudal society into a modern industrial state. The Meiji government focused on strengthening the military, adopting Western-style training and technology, which led to the establishing of a powerful navy and a well-equipped army. Furthermore, Japan&#x27;s economic infrastructure saw significant improvements, including the development of railways, telegraph lines, and modern factories, which led to rapid industrial growth and enhanced the country&#x27;s military capabilities.

During the same period, the Qing dynasty also attempted to implement reforms in response to internal rebellions and external threats. The Self-Strengthening Movement (1861-1895) aimed to modernise China&#x27;s military and industry by adopting Western technology and military techniques. However, the movement faced significant challenges, including bureaucratic resistance, corruption, and a lack of central coordination. These difficulties affected the effectiveness of the reforms and prevented China from achieving the same level of modernisation and industrialisation as Japan. As a result, by the time of the First Sino-Japanese War, China remained a largely agrarian society with a relatively weak military, unable to match the rapidly modernising Japanese forces.

===Korean politics===
In January 1864, King Cheoljong died without a male heir, and through Korean succession protocols King Gojong ascended the throne at the age of 12. However, as King Gojong was too young to rule, the new king&#x27;s father, Yi Ha-ŭng, became the , or lord of the great court, and ruled Korea in his son&#x27;s name as regent. Originally the term referred to any person who was not actually the king but whose son took the throne. With his ascendancy to power the initiated a set of reforms designed to strengthen the monarchy at the expense of the class. He also pursued an isolationist policy and was determined to purge the kingdom of any foreign ideas that had infiltrated into the nation. In Korean history, the king&#x27;s in-laws enjoyed great power, consequently the acknowledged that any future daughters-in-law might threaten his authority. Therefore, he attempted to prevent any possible threat to his rule by selecting as a new queen for his son an orphaned girl from among the Yŏhŭng Min clan, which lacked powerful political connections. With Queen Min as his daughter-in-law and the royal consort, the felt secure in his power. However, after she had become queen, Min recruited all her relatives and had them appointed to influential positions in the name of the king. The Queen also allied herself with political enemies of the , so that by late 1873 she had mobilised enough influence to oust him from power. In October 1873, when the Confucian scholar Choe Ik-hyeon submitted a memorial to King Gojong urging him to rule in his own right, Queen Min seized the opportunity to force her father-in-law&#x27;s retirement as regent. The departure of the led to Korea&#x27;s abandonment of its isolationist policy.

===Opening of Korea===
On 26 February 1876, after Japanese troops attacked Korean forces in the Ganghwa Island incident, the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876 was signed, opening Korea to Japanese trade. In 1880, the King sent a mission to Japan that was headed by Kim Hong-jip, an enthusiastic observer of the reforms taking place there. While in Japan, the Chinese diplomat Huang Zunxian presented him with a study called &quot;A Strategy for Korea&quot; (). It warned of the threat to Korea posed by the Russians and recommended that Korea maintain friendly relations with Japan, which was at the time too economically weak to be an immediate threat, to work closely with China, and seek an alliance with the United States as a counterweight to Russia. After returning to Korea, Kim presented the document to King Gojong, who was so impressed with the document that he had copies made and distributed to his officials.

In 1880, following Chinese advice and breaking with tradition, King Gojong decided to establish diplomatic ties with the United States. After negotiations through Chinese mediation in Tianjin, the Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce, and Navigation was formally signed between the United States and Korea in Incheon on 22 May 1882. However, there were two significant issues raised by the treaty. The first concerned Korea&#x27;s status as an independent nation. During the talks with the Americans, the Chinese insisted that the treaty contain an article declaring that Korea was a dependency of China and argued that the country had long been a tributary state of China. But the Americans firmly opposed such an article, arguing that a treaty with Korea should be based on the Treaty of Ganghwa, which stipulated that Korea was an independent state. A compromise was finally reached, with Shufeldt and Li agreeing that the King of Korea would notify the U.S. president in a letter that Korea had special status as a tributary state of China. The treaty between the Korean government and the United States became the model for all treaties between it and other Western countries. Korea later signed similar trade and commerce treaties with Britain and Germany in 1883, with Italy and Russia in 1884, and with France in 1886. Subsequently, commercial treaties were concluded with other European countries.

===Korean reforms===
After 1879, China&#x27;s relations with Korea came under the authority of Li Hongzhang, who had emerged as one of the most influential figures in China after playing an important role during the Taiping Rebellion, and was also an advocate of the Self-Strengthening Movement. In 1879, Li was appointed as governor-general of Zhili and the imperial commissioner for the northern ports. He was in charge of China&#x27;s Korea policy and urged Korean officials to adopt China&#x27;s own self-strengthening program to strengthen their country in response to foreign threats, to which King Gojong was receptive. The Korean government, immediately after opening the country to the outside world, pursued a policy of enlightenment aimed at achieving national prosperity and military strength through the doctrine of (&quot;Eastern ways and Western machines&quot;). To modernise their country, the Koreans tried selectively to accept and master Western technology while preserving their country&#x27;s cultural values and heritage.

In January 1881, the government launched administrative reforms and established the (Office for Extraordinary State Affairs) which was modelled on Chinese administrative structures. Under this overarching organisation, twelve or agencies were created. In 1881, a technical mission was sent to Japan to survey its modernised facilities. Officials travelled all over Japan inspecting administrative, military, educational, and industrial facilities. In October, another small group went to Tianjin to study modern weapons manufacturing, and Chinese technicians were invited to manufacture weapons in Seoul. Additionally, as part of their plan to modernise the country, the Koreans had invited the Japanese military attaché Lieutenant Horimoto Reizō to serve as an adviser in creating a modern army. A new military formation called the (Special Skills Force) was established, in which eighty to one hundred young men of the aristocracy were to be given Japanese military training. The following year, in January 1882, the government also reorganised the existing five-army garrison structure into the (Palace Guards Garrison) and the (Capital Guards Garrison).

===Japanese insecurities over Korea===
During the 1880s, discussions in Japan about national security focused on the issue of Korean reform. The political discourse over the two were interlinked; as the German military adviser Major Jakob Meckel stated, Korea was &quot;a dagger pointed at the heart of Japan&quot;. What made Korea of strategic concern was not merely its proximity to Japan but its inability to defend itself against outsiders. If Korea were truly independent, it posed no strategic problem to Japan&#x27;s national security, but if the country remained undeveloped it would remain weak and consequently would be inviting prey for foreign domination. The political consensus in Japan was that Korean independence lay, as it had been for Meiji Japan, through the importation of &quot;civilization&quot; from the West. Korea required a program of self-strengthening like the post-Restoration reforms that were enacted in Japan. The Japanese interest in the reform of Korea was not purely altruistic. Not only would these reforms enable Korea to resist foreign intrusion, which was in Japan&#x27;s direct interest, but through being a conduit of change they would also have opportunity to play a larger role on the peninsula. To Meiji leaders, the issue was not whether Korea should be reformed but how these reforms might be implemented. There was a choice of adopting a passive role which required the cultivation of reformist elements within Korean society and rendering them assistance whenever possible, or adopting a more aggressive policy, actively interfering in Korean politics to assure that reform took place. Many Japanese advocates of Korean reform swung between these two positions.

Japan in the early 1880s was weak, as a result of internal peasant uprisings and samurai rebellions during the previous decade. The country was also struggling financially, with inflation as a result of these internal factors. Subsequently, the Meiji government adopted a passive policy, encouraging the Korean court to follow the Japanese model but offering little concrete assistance except for the dispatch of the small military mission headed by Lieutenant Horimoto Reizo to train the . What worried the Japanese was the Chinese, who had loosened their hold over Korea in 1876 when the Japanese succeeded in establishing a legal basis for Korean independence by ending its tributary status. Chinese actions appeared to be thwarting the forces of reform in Korea and re-asserting their influence over the country.

===1882 crisis===

In 1882, the Korean Peninsula experienced a severe drought which led to food shortages, causing much hardship and discord among the population. Korea was on the verge of bankruptcy, even falling months behind on military pay, causing deep resentment among the soldiers. There was also resentment towards the on the part of the soldiers of the regular Korean army, as the formation was better equipped and treated. Additionally, more than 1000 soldiers had been discharged in the process of overhauling the army; most of them were either old or disabled, and the rest had not been given their pay in rice for thirteen months.

In June of that year, King Gojong, being informed of the situation, ordered that a month&#x27;s allowance of rice be given to the soldiers. He directed Min Gyeom-ho, the overseer of government finances and Queen Min&#x27;s nephew, to handle the matter. Min in turn handed the matter over to his steward who sold the good rice he had been given and used the money to buy millet which he mixed with sand and bran. As a result, the rice became rotten and inedible. The distribution of the alleged rice infuriated the soldiers. On 23 July, a military mutiny and riot broke out in Seoul. Enraged soldiers headed for the residence of Min Gyeom-ho, who they had suspected of having swindled them out of their rice. Min, on hearing word of the revolt, ordered the police to arrest some of the ringleaders and announced that they would be executed the next morning. He had assumed that this would serve as a warning to the other agitators. However, after learning what had transpired, the rioters broke into Min&#x27;s house to take vengeance; as he was not at his residence the rioters vented their frustrations by destroying his furniture and other possessions.

The rioters then moved on to an armoury from which they stole weapons and ammunition, and then headed for the prison. After overpowering the guards, they released not only the men who had been arrested that day by Min Gyeom-ho but also many political prisoners as well. Min then summoned the army to quell the rebellion but it had become too late to suppress the mutiny. The original body of mutineers had been swelled by the poor and disaffected citizenry of the city; as a result the revolt had assumed major proportions. The rioters now turned their attention to the Japanese. One group headed to Lieutenant Horimoto&#x27;s quarters and killed him. Another group, some 3,000 strong, headed for the Japanese legation, where Hanabusa Yoshitada the minister to Korea and twenty seven members of the legation resided. The mob surrounded the legation shouting its intention of killing all the Japanese inside. Hanabusa gave orders to burn the legation and important documents were set on fire. As the flames quickly spread, the members of the legation escaped through a rear gate, where they fled to the harbour and boarded a boat which took them down the Han River to Chemulpo. Taking refuge with the Incheon commandant, they were again forced to flee after word arrived of the events in Seoul and the attitude of their hosts changed. They escaped to the harbour during heavy rain and were pursued by Korean soldiers. Six Japanese were killed, while another five were seriously wounded. The survivors carrying the wounded then boarded a small boat and headed for the open sea where three days later they were rescued by a British survey ship, , which took them to Nagasaki. The following day, after the attack on the Japanese legation, the rioters forced their way into the royal palace where they found and killed Min Gyeom-ho, as well as a dozen other high-ranking officers. They also searched for Queen Min. The queen narrowly escaped, however, dressed as an ordinary lady of the court and was carried on the back of a faithful guard who claimed she was his sister. The used the incident to reassert his power.

The Chinese then deployed about 4,500 troops to Korea, under General Wu Changqing, which effectively regained control and quelled the rebellion. In response, the Japanese also sent four warships and a battalion of troops to Seoul to safeguard Japanese interests and demand reparations. However, tensions subsided with the Treaty of Chemulpo, signed on the evening of 30 August 1882. The agreement specified that the Korean conspirators would be punished and ¥50,000 would be paid to the families of slain Japanese. The Japanese government would also receive ¥500,000, a formal apology, and permission to station troops at their diplomatic legation in Seoul. In the aftermath of rebellion, the was accused of fomenting the rebellion and its violence, and was arrested by the Chinese and taken to Tianjin. He was later carried off to a town about sixty miles southwest of Beijing, where for three years he was confined to one room and kept under strict surveillance.

===Re-assertion of Chinese influence===
After the Imo Incident, early reform efforts in Korea suffered a major setback. In the aftermath of the incident, the Chinese reasserted their influence over the peninsula, where they began to interfere in Korean internal affairs directly. After stationing troops at strategic points in the capital Seoul, the Chinese undertook several initiatives to gain significant influence over the Korean government. The Qing dispatched two special advisers on foreign affairs representing Chinese interests to Korea: the German Paul Georg von Möllendorff, a close confidant of Li Hongzhang, and the Chinese diplomat Ma Jianzhong. A staff of Chinese officers also took over the training of the army, providing the Koreans with 1,000 rifles, two cannons, and 10,000 rounds of ammunition. Furthermore, the (Capital Guards Command), a new Korean military formation, was created and trained along Chinese lines by Yuan Shikai.

In October, the two countries signed a treaty stipulating that Korea was dependent on China and granted Chinese merchants the right to conduct overland and maritime business freely within its borders. It also gave the Chinese advantages over the Japanese and Westerners and granted them unilateral extraterritoriality privileges in civil and criminal cases. Under the treaty, the number of Chinese merchants and traders significantly increased, a severe blow to Korean merchants. Although it allowed Koreans reciprocally to trade in Beijing, the agreement was not a treaty but was in effect issued as a regulation for a vassal. Additionally, during the following year, the Chinese supervised the creation of a Korean Maritime Customs Service, headed by von Möllendorff. Korea was reduced to a semi-colonial tributary state of China with King Gojong unable to appoint diplomats without Chinese approval, and with troops stationed in the country to protect Chinese interests. China also obtained concessions in Korea, notably the Chinese concession of Incheon.

===Factional rivalry and ascendancy of the Min clan===
During the 1880s two rival factions emerged in Korea. One was a small group of reformers that had centered around the (Enlightenment Party), which had become frustrated at the limited scale and arbitrary pace of reforms. The members who constituted the Enlightenment Party were well-educated Koreans and most were from the yangban class. They were impressed by the developments in Meiji Japan and were eager to emulate them. Members included Kim Ok-gyun, Park Yung-hyo, Hong Yeong-sik, Seo Gwang-beom, and Soh Jaipil. The group was also relatively young; Pak Yung-hio came from a prestigious lineage related to the royal family and was 23, Hong was 29, Seo Gwang-beom was 25, and Soh Jaipil was 20, with Kim Ok-gyun being the oldest at 33. All had spent some time in Japan; Pak Yung-hio had been part of a mission sent to Japan to apologise for the Imo incident in 1882. He had been accompanied by Seo Gwang-beom and by Kim Ok-gyun, who later came under the influence of Japanese modernizers such as Fukuzawa Yukichi. Kim Ok-gyun, while studying in Japan, had also cultivated friendships with influential Japanese figures and became the de facto leader of the group. They were also strongly nationalistic and desired to make their country truly independent by ending Chinese interference in Korea&#x27;s internal affairs.

The was a group of conservatives, which included not only Min Yeong-ik from the Min family but also other prominent Korean political figures that wanted to maintain power with China&#x27;s help. Although the members of the supported the enlightenment policy, they favoured gradual changes based on the Chinese model. After the Imo incident, the Min clan pursued a pro-Chinese policy. This was also partly a matter of opportunism as the intervention by Chinese troops led to subsequent exile of the rival in Tianjin and the expansion of Chinese influence in Korea, but it also reflected an ideological disposition shared by many Koreans toward the more comfortable and traditional relationship as a tributary of China. Consequently, the Min clan became advocates of the (&quot;adopting Western knowledge while keeping Eastern values&quot;) philosophy, which had originated from the ideas of moderate Chinese reformers who had emphasised the need to maintain the perceived superior cultural values and heritage of the Sino-centric world while recognising the importance of acquiring and adopting Western technology, particularly military technology, to preserve autonomy. Hence, rather than major institutional reforms such as the adoption of new values such as legal equality or introducing modern education like in Meiji Japan, the advocates of this school of thought sought piecemeal adoptions of institutions that would strengthen the state while preserving the basic social, political, and cultural order. Through the ascendancy of Queen Min to the throne, the Min clan had also been able to use newly created government institutions as bases for political power; subsequently with their growing monopoly of key positions they frustrated the ambitions of the Enlightenment Party.

===Gapsin Coup===
In the two years preceding the Imo incident, the members of the had failed to secure appointments to vital offices in the government and were unable to implement their reform plans. As a consequence they were prepared to seize power by any means necessary. In 1884, an opportunity to seize power by staging a coup d&#x27;état against the presented itself. In August, as hostilities between France and China erupted over Annam, half of the Chinese troops stationed in Korea were withdrawn. On 4 December 1884, with the help of Japanese minister Takezoe Shinichiro who promised to mobilise Japanese legation guards to provide assistance, the reformers staged their coup under the guise of a banquet hosted by Hong Yeong-sik, the director of the General Postal Administration. The banquet was to celebrate the opening of the new national post office. King Gojong was expected to attend together with several foreign diplomats and high-ranking officials, most of whom were members of the pro-Chinese faction. Kim Ok-gyun and his comrades approached King Gojong falsely stating that Chinese troops had created a disturbance and escorted him to the small Gyoengu Palace, where they placed him in the custody of Japanese legation guards. They then proceeded to kill and wound several senior officials of the faction.

After the coup, the members formed a new government and devised a program of reform. The radical 14-point reform proposal stated that the following conditions be met: an end to Korea&#x27;s tributary relationship with China; the abolition of ruling-class privilege and the establishment of equal rights for all; the reorganisation of the government as virtually a constitutional monarchy; the revision of land tax laws; cancellation of the grain loan system; the unification of all internal fiscal administrations under the jurisdiction of the Ho-jo; the suppression of privileged merchants and the development of free commerce and trade, the creation of a modern police system including police patrols and royal guards; and severe punishment of corrupt officials.

However, the new government lasted no longer than a few days. This was possibly inevitable, as the reformers were supported by no more than 140 Japanese troops who faced at least 1,500 Chinese garrisoned in Seoul, under the command of General Yuan Shikai. With the reform measures being a threat to her clan&#x27;s power, Queen Min secretly requested military intervention from the Chinese. Consequently, within three days, even before the reform measures were made public, the coup was suppressed by Chinese troops who attacked and defeated the Japanese forces and restored power to the pro-Chinese faction. During the ensuing melee Hong Yeong-sik was killed, the Japanese legation building was burned down and forty Japanese were killed. The surviving Korean coup leaders including Kim Ok-gyun escaped to the port of Chemulpo under escort of the Japanese minister Takezoe. From there they boarded a Japanese ship for exile in Japan.

In January 1885, with a show of force the Japanese dispatched two battalions and seven warships to Korea, which resulted in the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1885, signed on 9 January 1885. The treaty restored diplomatic relations between Japan and Korea. The Koreans also agreed to pay the Japanese ¥100,000 for damages to their legation and to provide a site for the building of a new legation. Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi, to overcome Japan&#x27;s disadvantageous position in Korea followed by the abortive coup, visited China to discuss the matter with his Chinese counterpart, Li Hongzhang. The two parties succeeded in concluding the Convention of Tianjin on 31 May 1885. They also pledged to withdraw their troops from Korea within four months, with prior notification to the other if troops were to be sent to Korea in the future. After both countries withdrew their forces they left behind a precarious balance of power on the Korean Peninsula between the two nations. Meanwhile, Yuan Shikai remained in Seoul, appointed as the Chinese Resident, and continued to interfere with Korean domestic politics. The failure of the coup also marked a dramatic decline in Japanese influence over Korea.

===Nagasaki incident===
The Nagasaki incident was a riot that took place in the Japanese port city of Nagasaki in 1886. Four warships from the Qing Empire&#x27;s navy, the Beiyang Fleet, stopped at Nagasaki, apparently to carry out repairs. Some Chinese sailors caused trouble in the city and started the riot. Several Japanese policemen confronting the rioters were killed. The Qing government did not apologise after the incident, which resulted in a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan.

===Bean controversy===
A poor harvest in 1889 led the governor of Korea&#x27;s Hamgyong Province to prohibit soybean exports to Japan. Japan requested and received compensation in 1893 for their importers. The incident highlighted the growing dependence Japan felt on Korean food imports.

==Prelude to the war==
===Kim Ok-gyun affair===

On 28 March 1894, a pro-Japanese Korean revolutionary, Kim Ok-gyun, was assassinated in Shanghai. Kim had fled to Japan after his involvement in the 1884 coup, and the Japanese had turned down Korean demands for him to be extradited. Many Japanese activists saw in him potential for a future role in Korean modernisation; however, Meiji government leaders were more cautious. After some reservations, they exiled him to the Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands. Ultimately, he was lured to Shanghai, where he was killed by a Korean, Hong Jong-u, in his room at a Japanese inn in the International Settlement. After some hesitation, the British authorities in Shanghai concluded that rules against extradition did not apply to a corpse and turned his body over to Chinese authorities. His body was then taken aboard a Chinese warship and sent back to Korea, where it was cut up by the Korean authorities, quartered and displayed in all Korean provinces as a warning to other purported rebels and traitors.

In Tokyo, the Japanese government took that as an outrageous affront. Kim Ok-gyun&#x27;s brutal murder was portrayed as a betrayal by Li Hongzhang and a setback for Japan&#x27;s stature and dignity. The Chinese authorities refused to press charges against the assassin, and he was even allowed to accompany Kim&#x27;s mutilated body back to Korea, where he was showered with rewards and honours. Kim&#x27;s assassination had also called Japan&#x27;s commitment to its Korean supporters into question. The police in Tokyo had foiled an earlier attempt during the same year to assassinate Park Yung-hyo, one of the other Korean leaders of the 1884 uprising. When two suspected Korean assassins received asylum at the Korean legation, that had instigated a diplomatic outrage as well. Although the Japanese government could have immediately used Kim&#x27;s assassination to its advantage, it concluded that since Kim had died on Chinese territory, the treatment of the corpse was outside its authority. However, the shocking murder of the Korean inflamed Japanese opinion since many Japanese considered the Chinese-supported actions to be directed against Japan as well. To the Japanese, the Chinese had also showed their contempt for international law when they set free the suspected assassin, who had been arrested by British authorities in Shanghai and then, in accordance with treaty obligations, turned over to the Chinese for trial. Nationalistic groups immediately began to call for war with China.

===Donghak Rebellion===

Tensions ran high between China and Japan, but war was not yet inevitable, and the fury in Japan over Kim&#x27;s assassination began to dissipate. However, in late April, the Donghak Rebellion erupted in Korea. Korean peasants rose up in open rebellion against oppressive taxation and incompetent financial administration of the Joseon government. It was the largest peasant rebellion in Korean history. However, on 1 June, rumours reached the Donghaks that the Chinese and Japanese were on the verge of sending troops and so the rebels agreed to a ceasefire to remove any grounds for foreign intervention.

On 2 June, the Japanese cabinet decided to send troops to Korea if China did the same. In May, the Chinese had taken steps to prepare for the mobilisation of their forces in the provinces of Zhili, Shandong and in Manchuria as a result of the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula. However, those actions were planned more as an armed demonstration to strengthen the Chinese position in Korea than as preparation for war against Japan. On 3 June, King Gojong, on the recommendation of the Min clan and at the insistence of Yuan Shikai, requested aid from the Chinese government in suppressing the Donghak Rebellion. Although the rebellion was not as serious as it had initially seemed and so the Chinese forces were not necessary, the decision was made to send 2,500 men under the command of General Ye Zhichao to the harbour of Asan, about from Seoul. The troops destined for Korea sailed on board three British-owned steamers chartered by the Chinese government, arriving at Asan on 9 June. On 25 June, a further 400 troops had arrived. Consequently, by the end of June, Ye Zhichao had about 2,800–2,900 soldiers under his command at Asan.

Closely watching the events on the peninsula, the Japanese government had quickly become convinced that the rebellion would lead to Chinese intervention in Korea. As a result, soon after learning of the Korean government&#x27;s request for Chinese military help, all Japanese warships in the vicinity were immediately ordered to Pusan and Chemulpo. By 9 June, Japanese warships had consecutively called at Chemulpo and Pusan. A formation of 420 sailors, selected from the crews of warships anchored in Chempulo, was immediately dispatched to Seoul, where they served as a temporary counterbalance to the Chinese troops camped at Asan. Simultaneously, a reinforced brigade of approximately 8,000 troops (the Oshima Composite Brigade), under the command of General Ōshima Yoshimasa, was also dispatched to Chemulpo by 27 June.

According to the Japanese, the Chinese government had violated the Convention of Tientsin by not informing the Japanese government of its decision to send troops, but the Chinese claimed that Japan had approved the decision. The Japanese countered by sending an expeditionary force to Korea. The first 400 troops arrived on 9 June en route to Seoul, and 3,000 landed at Incheon on 12 June.

However, Japanese officials denied any intention to intervene. As a result, the Qing viceroy Li Hongzhang &quot;was lured into believing that Japan would not wage war, but the Japanese were fully prepared to act&quot;. The Qing government turned down Japan&#x27;s suggestion for Japan and China to co-operate to reform the Korean government. When Korea demanded that Japan withdraw its troops from Korea, the Japanese refused.

In July 1894, the 8,000 Japanese troops captured the Korean king Gojong and occupied the Gyeongbokgung in Seoul. By 25 July, they had replaced the existing Korean government with members of the pro-Japanese faction. Even though Qing forces were already leaving Korea after they found themselves unneeded there, the new pro-Japanese Korean government granted Japan the right to expel Qing forces, and Japan dispatched more troops to Korea. The Qing Empire rejected the new Korean government as illegitimate.

==Status of the combatants==
===Japan===
Japanese reforms under the Meiji government gave significant priority to the creation of an effective modern national army and navy, especially naval construction. Japan sent numerous military officials abroad for training and evaluation of the relative strengths and tactics of Western armies and navies.

====Imperial Japanese Navy====

The Imperial Japanese Navy was modelled after the British Royal Navy, at the time the foremost naval power. British advisors were sent to Japan to train the naval establishment, while Japanese students were in turn sent to Britain to study and observe the Royal Navy. Through drilling and tuition by Royal Navy instructors, Japan developed naval officers expert in the arts of gunnery and seamanship. At the start of hostilities, the Imperial Japanese Navy was composed of a fleet of 12 modern warships, (the protected cruiser &quot;Izumi&quot; being added during the war), eight corvettes, one ironclad warship, 26 torpedo boats, and numerous auxiliary/armed merchant cruisers and converted liners. During peacetime, the warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy were divided among three main naval bases at Yokosuka, Kure and Sasebo and following mobilisation, the navy was composed of five divisions of seagoing warships and three flotillas of torpedo boats with a fourth being formed at the beginning of hostilities. The Japanese also had a relatively large merchant navy, which at the beginning of 1894 consisted of 288 vessels. Of these, 66 belonged to the Nippon Yusen Kaisha shipping company, which received national subsidies from the Japanese government to maintain the vessels for use by the navy in time of war. As a consequence, the navy could call on a sufficient number of auxiliaries and transports.

Japan did not yet have the resources to acquire battleships and so planned to employ the &quot;Jeune École&quot; doctrine, which favoured small, fast warships, especially cruisers and torpedo boats, with the offensive capability to destroy larger craft. The Japanese naval leadership, on the eve of hostilities, was generally cautious and even apprehensive, as the navy had not yet received the warships ordered in February 1893, particularly the battleships and and the protected cruiser . Hence, initiating hostilities at the time was not ideal, and the navy was far less confident than the army about the outcome of a war with China.

Many of Japan&#x27;s major warships were built in British and French shipyards (eight British, three French and two Japanese-built) and 16 of the torpedo boats were known to have been built in France and assembled in Japan.
====Imperial Japanese Army====
The Meiji government at first modelled their army after the French Army. French advisers had been sent to Japan with two military missions (in 1872–1880 and 1884), in addition to one mission under the shogunate. Nationwide conscription was enforced in 1873 and a Western-style conscript army was established; military schools and arsenals were also built. In 1886, Japan turned toward the German-Prussian model as the basis for its army, adopting German doctrines and the German military system and organisation. In 1885 Jakob Meckel, a German adviser, implemented new measures, such as the reorganisation of the command structure into divisions and regiments; the strengthening of army logistics, transportation, and structures (thereby increasing mobility); and the establishment of artillery and engineering regiments as independent commands. It was also an army that was equal to European armed forces in every respect.

On the eve of the outbreak of the war with China all men between the ages of 17 and 40 years were eligible for conscription, but only those who turned 20 were to be drafted while those who had turned 17 could volunteer. All men between the ages of 17 and 40, even those who had not received military training or were physically unfit, were considered part of the territorial militia or national guard (&quot;kokumin&quot;). Following the period of active military service (&quot;gen-eki&quot;), which lasted for three years, the soldiers became part of the first Reserve (&quot;yōbi numbering 92,000 in 1893&quot;) and then the second Reserve (&quot;kōbi numbering 106,000 in 1893&quot;). All young and able-bodied men who did not receive basic military training due to exceptions and those conscripts who had not fully met the physical requirements of military service, became third Reserve (&quot;hojū&quot;). In time of war, the first Reserve (&quot;yōbi&quot;) were to be called up first and they were intended to fill the ranks of the regular army units. Next to be called up were the &quot;kōbi&quot; reserve who were to be either used to further fill in the ranks of line units or to be formed into new ones. The &quot;hojū&quot; reserve members were to be called up only in exceptional circumstances, and the territorial militia or national guard would only be called up in case of an immediate enemy attack on or invasion of Japan.

The country was divided into six military districts (headquarters Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Sendai, Hiroshima and Kumamoto), with each being a recruitment area for a square infantry division consisting of two brigades of two regiments. Each of these divisions contained approximately 18,600 troops and 36 artillery pieces when mobilised. There was also an Imperial Guard division which recruited nationally, from all around Japan. This division was also composed of two brigades but had instead two-battalion, not three-battalion, regiments; consequently its numerical strength after mobilisation was 12,500 troops and 24 artillery pieces. In addition, there were fortress troops consisting of approximately six battalions, the Colonial Corps of about 4,000 troops which was stationed on Hokkaido and the Ryukyu Islands, and a battalion of military police in each of the districts. In peacetime the regular army had a total of fewer than 70,000 men, while after mobilisation the numbers rose to over 220,000. Moreover, the army still had a trained reserve, which, following the mobilisation of the first-line divisions, could be formed into reserve brigades. These reserve brigades each consisted of four battalions, a cavalry unit, a company of engineers, an artillery battery and rear-echelon units. They were to serve as recruiting bases for their front-line divisions and could also perform secondary combat operations, and if necessary they could be expanded into full divisions with a total of 24 territorial force regiments. However, formation of these units was hindered by a lack of sufficient amounts of equipment, especially uniforms.

Japanese troops were equipped with the 8-mm single-shot Murata Type 18 breech-loading rifle. The improved eight-round-magazine Type 22 was just being introduced and consequently in 1894, on the eve of the war, only the Imperial Guard and 4th Division were equipped with these rifles. The division artillery consisted of 75-mm field guns and mountain pieces manufactured in Osaka. The artillery was based on Krupp designs that were adapted by the Italians at the beginning of the 1880s; although it could hardly be described as modern in 1894, in general it still matched contemporary battlefield requirements.

By the 1890s, Japan had at its disposal a modern, professionally trained Western-style army which was relatively well equipped and supplied. Its officers had studied in Europe and were well educated in the latest strategy and tactics. By the start of the war, the Imperial Japanese Army could field a total force of 120,000 men in two armies and five divisions.

The Japanese army despite the integration of supply troops into its divisions was unable to rely on its pre-existing logistical system and personnel to sustain its armies in the field with 153,000 labourers, contractors, and drivers being contracted to sustain the armies in the field. Supply issues and a general lack of preparedness for a sustained war would routinely delay operations and slow down the Japanese field armies as seen in the Yingkou Campaign, troops often had to forage or steal from the local populace and medicine and winter clothing was often in short supply during the latter stages of the war.

The Japanese Army also possessed a large amount of coastal guns at key locations which could be used for siege operations, these weapons were as follows:
* 50 280-mm Howitzers
* 38 274-mm guns
* 45 240-mm guns
* 40 150-mm guns
* 42 120-mm guns
* various smaller pieces

===China===
The prevailing view in many Western circles was that the modernised Chinese military would crush the Japanese. Observers commended Chinese units such as the Huai Army and Beiyang Fleet. The German General Staff predicted a Japanese defeat and William Lang, who was a British advisor to the Chinese military, praised Chinese training, ships, guns, and fortifications, stating that &quot;in the end, there is no doubt that Japan must be utterly crushed&quot;.

====Imperial Chinese Army====
The Qing dynasty did not have a unified national army, but was made up of three main components, with the so-called Eight Banners forming the elite. The Eight Banners forces were segregated along ethnic lines into separate Manchu, Han Chinese, Mongol, Hui (Muslim) and other ethnic formations. Bannermen who made up the Eight Banners got higher pay than the rest of the army while the Manchu received further privileges. In total, there were 250,000 soldiers in the Eight Banners, with over 60 per cent kept in garrisons in Beijing, while the remaining 40 per cent served as garrison troops in other major Chinese cities. The Green Standard Army was a 600,000-strong gendarmerie-type force that was recruited from the majority Han Chinese population. Its soldiers were not given any peacetime basic military training, but were expected to fight in any conflict. The third component was an irregular force called the Braves, which were used as a kind of reserve force for the regular army, and which were usually recruited from the more distant or remote provinces of China. They were formed into very loosely organised units from the same province. The Braves were sometimes described as mercenaries, with their volunteers receiving as much military training as their commanders saw fit. With no fixed unit organisation, it is impossible to know how many battle-ready Braves there actually were in 1894. There were also a few other military formations, one of which was the Huai Army, which was under the personal authority of Li Hongzhang and was created originally to suppress the Taiping Rebellion (1850–1864). The Huai Army had received limited training by Western military advisors; numbering nearly 45,000 troops, it was considered the best-armed military unit in China.

However, there is no definitive estimate for the size of the Qing armies in this war and scholarly estimates vary widely.

*does not distinguish between the two armies.

The Japanese Imperial General Staff estimated that they would face no more than 350,000 effective Chinese soldiers. This corresponds well with the estimate of the Board of war from 1898 which states that the total of the provincial militia, Defense army (Yong ying), Disciplined army (modernised Green standard), and new-style forces (organised after the war) was approximately 360,000. Du Boulay confirms this with the total army strength of the army in Zhili, Shandong and Manchuria amounting to 357,100(Zhili, Shandong, and Manchuria) and 1,000,000 total trained men in the empire.
Due to various factors such as the limited transport capacity (the absence of any railway in the combat zone), provincial infighting and a general lack of capacity for accommodating soldiers, only a small portion of the army that could be fielded was actually deployed, even forces that were mobilised, including the strong Hunan forces of Liu Kunyi they were not able to arrive in time to make a meaningful difference. This meant that the fighting primarily fell on the forces already in Zhili, Shandong and Manchuria. This was a similar situation as what occurred in the Opium Wars, as the much larger Chinese army found itself outnumbered in those conflicts as it did this one.

Chinese forces were also far behind the Japanese in terms of support services; there was a complete absence of engineers, quartermasters, transportation, signal and medical troops. Hired labour (coolies) often performed transportation duties and rudimentary engineering tasks, supply was organised by the province where the soldiers were fighting and left to civilian officials assigned as quartermasters and a few doctors were attached to the army at the rear. This lack of adequate supply organisation led to some units receiving the wrong ammunition for their rifles (on the presumption they possessed rifles).

The basic tactical unit of the Chinese army was the battalion (ying), composed on paper of 500 men, though in reality actual strength was 350 for the infantry and 250 for the cavalry. Up to a dozen of these Ying would form an independent corps, and only at a corps level did Chinese units receive artillery.

Although the Chinese had established arsenals to produce firearms, and a large number of them had been imported from abroad, 40 per cent of Chinese troops at the outbreak of the war were not issued with rifles or even muskets. Instead they were armed with a variety of swords, spears, pikes, halberds, and bows and arrows. Against well-trained, well-armed, and disciplined Japanese troops, they would have little chance. Those units that did have firearms were equipped with a heterogeneity of weapons, from a variety of modern rifles to old-fashioned muskets; this lack of standardisation led to a major problem with the proper supply of ammunition.

Chinese troops were often not drilled in how to use their guns with training conducted with spears and when guns were used in training the officer corps resistant to modern training practice would conduct it at a distance of 50 ft, instead of at longer ranges that would be more common in combat. There was also a lack of discipline within the army as troops would routinely flee before, during, or after combat as occurred in the Battle of Pyongyang. Chinese artillerymen likewise did not receive adequate training in operating their artillery pieces.

The Imperial Chinese Army in 1894 was a heterogeneous mixture of modernised, partly modernised, and almost medieval units which no commander could have led successfully, resulting in poor leadership among Chinese officers. Chinese officers did not know how to handle their troops and the older, higher-ranking officers still believed that they could fight a war as they had during the Taiping Rebellion of 1850–1864. This was also the result of the Chinese military forces being divided into largely independent regional commands. The soldiers were drawn from diverse provinces that had no affinity with each other. Chinese troops also suffered from poor morale, largely because many of the troops had not been paid for a long time. The low prestige of soldiers in Chinese society also hindered morale, and the use of opium and other narcotics was rife throughout the army. Low morale and poor leadership seriously reduced the effectiveness of Chinese troops, and contributed to defeats such as the abandonment of the very well-fortified and defensible Weihaiwei. Additionally, military logistics were lacking, as the construction of railroads in Manchuria had been discouraged.

The Huai Army troops (also sometimes referred to as the Beiyang Army), although they were a small minority in the overall Imperial Chinese Army, were to take part in the majority of the fighting during the war. They were organised in 51 battalions and were estimated to number from 25,000 to 45,000. The Huai Army units that faced the Japanese in Korea did have a significant amount of modern weaponry, including Mauser breech-loading rifles that were comparable to the Murata rifles of the Japanese, and Krupp artillery pieces. After their defeat in Korea, the Qing deployed additional forces to defend northeast China, including partially-reformed Green Standard troops that were poorly equipped.

====Beiyang Fleet====


The Beiyang Fleet was one of the four modernised Chinese navies in the late Qing dynasty. The navies were heavily sponsored by Li Hongzhang, the Viceroy of Zhili who had also created the Huai Army. The Beiyang Fleet was the dominant navy in East Asia before the First Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese themselves were apprehensive about facing the Chinese fleet, especially the two German-built battleships – and – to which the Japanese had no comparable counterparts. However, China&#x27;s advantages were more apparent than real as most of the Chinese warships were over-age and obsolescent; the ships were also not maintained properly and indiscipline was common among their crews. The greater armour of major Chinese warships and the greater weight of broadside they could fire were more than offset by the number of quick-firing guns on most first-line Japanese warships, which gave the Japanese the edge in any sustained exchange of salvos. The worst feature of both Chinese battleships was actually their main armament; each was armed with short-barreled guns in twin barbettes mounted in echelon which could fire only in restricted arcs. The short barrels of the Chinese main armament meant that the shells had a low muzzle velocity and poor penetration, and their accuracy was also poor at long ranges.

Tactically, Chinese naval vessels entered the war with only the crudest set of instructionsships that were assigned to designated pairs were to keep together and all ships were to fight end-on, as far forward from the beam as possible, a tactic dictated by the obsolescent arrangement of guns aboard Chinese warships. The only vague resemblance of a fleet tactic was that all ships were to follow the visible movements of the flagship, an arrangement made necessary because the signal book used by the Chinese was written in English, a language with which few officers in the Beiyang Fleet had any familiarity.

When it was first developed by Empress Dowager Cixi in 1888, the Beiyang Fleet was said to be the strongest navy in East Asia. Before her adopted son, the Guangxu Emperor, took over the throne in 1889, Cixi wrote out explicit orders that the navy should continue to develop and expand gradually. However, after Cixi went into retirement, all naval and military development came to a drastic halt. Japan&#x27;s victories over China has often been falsely rumoured to be the fault of Cixi. Many believed that Cixi was the cause of the navy&#x27;s defeat because Cixi embezzled funds from the navy to build the Summer Palace in Beijing. However, extensive research by Chinese historians revealed that Cixi was not the cause of the Chinese navy&#x27;s decline. In actuality, China&#x27;s defeat was caused by the Guangxu Emperor&#x27;s lack of interest in developing and maintaining the military. His close adviser, Grand Tutor Weng Tonghe, advised Guangxu to cut all funding to the navy and army, because he did not see Japan as a true threat, and there were several natural disasters during the early 1890s which the emperor thought to be more pressing to expend funds on.

The total strength of the entire Imperial Chinese navy was:
* 2 battleships
* 1 coastal battleship (often labelled as an armoured cruiser)
* 5 unprotected cruisers
* 5 protected cruisers
* 1 auxiliary cruiser
* 7 small cruisers
* 4 torpedo gunboats
* 34 gunboats
* 28 small gunboats
* 30 torpedo boats
* 9 armed transports

===Contemporaneous wars waged by the Qing===
While the Qing was fighting the First Sino-Japanese War, it was also simultaneously engaging rebels in the Dungan Revolt in northwestern China, where thousands lost their lives. The generals Dong Fuxiang, Ma Anliang and Ma Haiyan were initially summoned by the Qing government to bring the Hui troops under their command to participate in the First Sino-Japanese War, but they were eventually sent to suppress the Dungan Revolt instead.

==Early stages==
1 June 1894: The Donghak Rebel Army moves toward Seoul. The Korean government requests help from the Qing government to suppress the revolt.

6 June 1894: About 2,465 Chinese soldiers are transported to Korea to suppress the Donghak Rebellion. Japan asserts that it was not notified and thus China has violated the Convention of Tientsin, which requires that China and Japan must notify each other before intervening in Korea. China asserts that Japan was notified and approved of Chinese intervention.

8 June 1894: First of about 4,000 Japanese soldiers and 500 marines land at Chemulpo.

11 June 1894: Ceasefire during the Donghak Rebellion.

13 June 1894: The Japanese government telegraphs the commander of the Japanese forces in Korea, Ōtori Keisuke, to remain in Korea for as long as possible despite the end of the rebellion.

16 June 1894: Japanese foreign minister Mutsu Munemitsu meets with Wang Fengzao, the Qing ambassador to Japan, to discuss the future status of Korea. Wang states that the Qing government intends to pull out of Korea after the rebellion has been suppressed and expects Japan to do the same. However, China retains a resident to look after Chinese primacy in Korea.

22 June 1894: Additional Japanese troops arrive in Korea. Japanese prime minister Itō Hirobumi tells Matsukata Masayoshi that since the Qing Empire appear to be making military preparations, there is probably &quot;no policy but to go to war&quot;. Mutsu tells Ōtori to press the Korean government on the Japanese demands.

26 June 1894: Ōtori presents a set of reform proposals to the Korean king Gojong. Gojong&#x27;s government rejects the proposals and instead insists on troop withdrawals.

7 July 1894: Failure of mediation between China and Japan arranged by the British ambassador to China.

19 July 1894: Establishment of the Japanese Combined Fleet, consisting of almost all vessels in the Imperial Japanese Navy. Mutsu cables Ōtori to take any necessary steps to compel the Korean government to carry out a reform program.

23 July 1894: Japanese troops occupy Seoul, capture Gojong, and establish a new, pro-Japanese government, which terminates all Sino-Korean treaties and grants the Imperial Japanese Army the right to expel the Qing Empire&#x27;s Beiyang Army from Korea.

25 July 1894: First battle of the war: the Battle of Pungdo / Hoto-oki kaisen

==Events during the war==
===Opening troop movements===
By July 1894, Chinese forces in Korea numbered 3,000–3,500 and they were outnumbered by Japanese troops. They could only be supplied by sea through Asan Bay. The Japanese objective was first to blockade the Chinese at Asan and then encircle them with their land forces. Japan&#x27;s initial strategy was to gain command of the sea, which was critical to its operations in Korea. Command of the sea would allow Japan to transport troops to the mainland. The army&#x27;s Fifth Division would land at Chemulpo on the western coast of Korea, both to engage and push Chinese forces north-west up the peninsula and to draw the Beiyang Fleet into the Yellow Sea, where it would be engaged in decisive battle. Depending on the outcome of this engagement, Japan would make one of three choices. If the Combined Fleet were to win decisively, the larger part of the Japanese army would undertake immediate landings on the coast between Shan-hai-kuan and Tientsin to defeat the Chinese army and bring the war to a swift conclusion. If the engagement were to be a draw and neither side gained control of the sea, the army would concentrate on the occupation of Korea. Lastly, if the Combined Fleet was defeated and consequently lost command of the sea, the bulk of the army would remain in Japan and prepare to repel a Chinese invasion, while the Fifth Division in Korea would be ordered to hang on and fight a rearguard action.

===Sinking of the &quot;Kowshing&quot;===

On 25 July 1894, the cruisers &quot;Yoshino&quot;, &quot;Naniwa&quot; and &quot;Akitsushima&quot; of the Japanese flying squadron, which had been patrolling off Asan Bay, encountered the Chinese cruiser &quot;Jiyuan&quot; and gunboat &quot;Kwang-yi&quot;. These vessels had steamed out of Asan to meet the transport &quot;Kowshing&quot;, escorted by the Chinese gunboat &quot;Tsao-kiang&quot;. After an hour-long engagement, the &quot;Jiyuan&quot; escaped while the &quot;Kwang-yi&quot; grounded on rocks, where its powder magazine exploded.

The &quot;Kowshing&quot; was a 2,134-ton British merchant vessel owned by the Indochina Steam Navigation Company of London, commanded by Captain T. R. Galsworthy and crewed by 64 men. The ship was chartered by the Qing government to ferry troops to Korea, and was on her way to reinforce Asan with 1,100 troops plus supplies and equipment. A German artillery officer, Major von Hanneken, advisor to the Chinese, was also aboard. The ship was due to arrive on 25 July.

The Japanese cruiser &quot;Naniwa&quot;, under Captain Tōgō Heihachirō, intercepted the &quot;Kowshing&quot; and captured its escort. The Japanese then ordered the &quot;Kowshing&quot; to follow &quot;Naniwa&quot; and directed that Europeans be transferred to &quot;Naniwa&quot;. However, the 1,100 Chinese on board, desperate to return to Taku, threatened to kill the English captain, Galsworthy, and his crew. After four hours of negotiations, Captain Togo gave the order to fire upon the vessel. A torpedo missed, but a subsequent broadside hit the &quot;Kow Shing&quot;, which started to sink.

In the confusion, some of the Europeans escaped overboard, only to be fired upon by the Chinese. The Japanese rescued three of the British crew (the captain, first officer and quartermaster) and 50 Chinese, and took them to Japan. The sinking of the &quot;Kowshing&quot; almost caused a diplomatic incident between Japan and Britain, but the action was ruled in conformity with international law regarding the treatment of mutineers (the Chinese troops). Many observers considered the troops lost on board the &quot;Kowshing&quot; to have been the best the Chinese had.

The German gunboat rescued 150 Chinese, the French gunboat &quot;Le Lion&quot; rescued 43, and the British cruiser HMS &quot;Porpoise&quot; rescued an unknown number.

===Fighting in southern Korea===
Commissioned by the new pro-Japanese Korean government to forcibly expel Chinese forces, on 25 July Major-General Ōshima Yoshimasa led a mixed brigade numbering about 4,000 on a rapid forced march from Seoul south toward Asan Bay to face Chinese troops garrisoned at Seonghwan Station east of Asan and Kongju.

The Chinese forces stationed near Seonghwan under the command of General Ye Zhichao numbered about 3,880 men. They had anticipated the impending arrival of the Japanese by fortifying their position with trenches, earthworks including six redoubts protected by abatis and by the flooding of surrounding rice fields. But expected Chinese reinforcements had been lost on board the British-chartered transport &quot;Kowshing&quot;. Units of the Chinese main force were deployed east and northeast of Asan, near the main road leading to Seoul; the key positions held by the Chinese were the towns of Seonghwan and Cheonan. Approximately 3,000 troops were stationed at Seonghwan, while 1,000 men along with General Ye Zhichao were at headquarters at Cheonan. The remaining Chinese troops were stationed in Asan itself. The Chinese had been preparing for a pincer movement against the Korean capital by massing troops at Pyongyang in the north and Asan in the south.

On the morning of 27–28 July 1894, the two forces met just outside Asan in an engagement that lasted till 07:30 the next morning. The battle began with a diversionary attack by Japanese troops, followed by the main attack which quickly outflanked the Chinese defences. The Chinese troops, witnessing that they were being outflanked, left their defensive positions and fled towards the direction of Asan. The Chinese gradually lost ground to the superior Japanese numbers, and finally broke and fled towards Pyongyang abandoning arms, ammunition and all their artillery. The Japanese took the city of Asan on 29 July, breaking the Chinese encirclement of Seoul. The Chinese suffered 500 killed and wounded while the Japanese suffered 88 casualties. General Ye Zhichao reported to the Emperor that he had in fact won the battle and caused over 2,000 casualties to the Japanese forces, for which his army was rewarded with 20,000 taels. He then reported later that 20,000 Japanese attacked him and he inflicted a further 1,500 casualties to his 300 losses and the strategic situation compelled him to withdraw to Pyongyang where en route he inflicted a further 1,500 casualties. Ye&#x27;s reports of the battle of Seonghwan were received in Beijing in August over a month after the battle occurred, an indication of the lack of proper systems of communication within the Qing army

===Declaration of War===
On 1 August 1894, war was officially declared between China and Japan. The rationale, language and tone given by the rulers of both nations in their respective declarations of war were markedly different.

The tenor of the Japanese declaration of war, issued in the name of the Meiji Emperor, appears to have had at least one eye fixed on the wider international community using phrases such as &#x27;Family of Nations&#x27;, the &#x27;Law of Nations&#x27; and making additional references to international treaties. This was in sharp contrast to the Chinese approach to foreign relations which historically was noted for refusing to treat with other nations on an equal diplomatic footing, and instead insistent on such foreign powers paying tribute to the Chinese Emperor as vassals. In keeping with the traditional Chinese approach to its neighbours, the Chinese declaration of war stated the palpable disdain for the Japanese can be surmised from the repeated use of the term &quot;Wojen&quot; which translates to &#x27;dwarf&#x27;, an ancient intentionally offensive and highly derogative term for the Japanese.

This use of the pejorative to describe a foreign nation was not unusual for Chinese official documents of the timeso much so that a major bone of contention between Imperial China and the Treaty Powers of the day had previously been the habitual use of the Chinese character 夷 (&#x27;Yi&#x27;...which literally meant &#x27;barbarian&#x27;), to refer to those termed otherwise as &#x27;foreign devils&#x27; typically describing those powers occupying the treaty ports. The use of the term &#x27;Yi&#x27; (夷) by Chinese Imperial officials had in fact been considered so provocative by the Treaty Powers that the collective bundle of accords known as the Treaty of Tientsin negotiated in 1858 to end the Second Opium War explicitly proscribed the Chinese Imperial Court from using the term &#x27;Yi&#x27; to refer to officials, subjects, or citizens of the belligerent powers, the signatories seemingly feeling it necessary to extract this specific demand from the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s representatives. In the thirty-five years elapsing since the Treaty of Tientsin, however, the language of the Chinese Emperors would appear to change little with regards to its neighbour Japan.

===Battle of Pyongyang===
After the initial fighting further to the south in July 1894, the Chinese ground forces focused on holding Pyongyang, beyond which there were no other defensible positions until the Yalu River, the border between Korea and China. The city was near a river to the south and east, mountains to the north, and was surrounded by walls. The Qing deployed 13,000 troops there from China, and the defenders spent almost two months preparing fortifications after they arrived in the city on 4 August, including 27 forts. The Chinese were planning to use Pyongyang as their headquarters from where they would retake the rest of the Korean peninsula. The Qing forces in the city had a large quantity of modern equipment, and some of their best troops.

At 04:30 on 15 September, the Imperial Japanese Army converged on the city of Pyongyang from four directions, with a total of 23,800 troops. They launched an artillery barrage from the east and a feint from the south as a diversion from the main attack, coming from the north, which was the easiest direction to approach from. The Chinese put up a strong resistance, and it was some of the fiercest fighting of the war, but they did not fire on Japanese troops crossing the river and were not expecting another attack from the north. Once the Japanese entered the city, the defenders were defeated and the survivors fled, being attacked by a separate Japanese force as they retreated. The Japanese captured 35 artillery pieces, hundreds of rifles, and ammunition. The troops led by the Chinese Hui Muslim general Zuo Baogui notably fought well, until he was killed in action by Japanese artillery.

Taking advantage of heavy rainfall overnight, the remaining Chinese troops escaped Pyongyang and headed northeast toward the coastal city of Uiju. In the early morning of 16 September, the entire Japanese army entered Pyongyang.

===Defeat of the Beiyang fleet===

In early September, Li Hongzhang decided to reinforce the Chinese forces at Pyongyang by employing the Beiyang fleet to escort transports to the mouth of the Taedong River. About 4,500 additional troops stationed in the Zhili were to be redeployed. On 12 September, half of the troops embarked at Dagu on five specially chartered transports and headed to Dalian where two days later on 14 September, they were joined by another 2,000 soldiers. Initially, Admiral Ding wanted to send the transports under a light escort with only a few ships, while the main force of the Beiyang Fleet would locate and operate directly against the Combined Fleet to prevent the Japanese from intercepting the convoy. But the appearance of the Japanese cruisers &quot;Yoshino&quot; and &quot;Naniwa&quot; on a reconnaissance sortie near Weihaiwei thwarted these plans. The Chinese had mistaken them for the main Japanese fleet. Consequently, on 12 September, the entire Beiyang Fleet departed Dalian heading for Weihaiwei, arriving near the Shandong Peninsula the next day. The Chinese warships spent the entire day cruising the area, waiting for the Japanese. However, since there was no sighting of the Japanese fleet, Admiral Ding decided to return to Dalian, reaching the port in the morning of 15 September. As Japanese troops moved north to attack Pyongyang, Admiral Ito correctly guessed that the Chinese would attempt to reinforce their army in Korea by sea. On 14 September, the Combined Fleet steamed northwards to search the Korean and Chinese coasts to bring the Beiyang Fleet to battle.

The Japanese victory at Pyongyang had succeeded in pushing Chinese troops north to the Yalu River, in the process removing all effective Chinese military presence on the Korean Peninsula.
Shortly before the convoy&#x27;s departure, Admiral Ding received a message concerning the battle at Pyongyang informing him about the defeat. Subsequently, it made the redeployment of the troops to the mouth of the Taedong river unnecessary. Admiral Ding then correctly assumed that the next Chinese line of defence would be established on the Yalu River, and decided to redeploy the embarked soldiers there. On 16 September, the convoy of five transport ships departed from Dalian Bay under escort from the vessels of the Beiyang Fleet which included the two ironclad battleships &quot;Dingyuan&quot; and &quot;Zhenyuan&quot;. Reaching the mouth of the Yalu River, the transports disembarked the troops, and the landing operation lasted until the following morning.

On 17 September 1894, the Japanese Combined Fleet encountered the Chinese Beiyang Fleet off the mouth of the Yalu River. The naval battle, which lasted from late morning to dusk, resulted in a Japanese victory. Although the Chinese were able to land 4,500 troops near the Yalu River by sunset the Beiyang fleet was near the point of total collapsemost of the fleet had fled or had been sunk and the two largest ships &quot;Dingyuan&quot; and &quot;Zhenyuan&quot; were nearly out of ammunition. The Imperial Japanese Navy destroyed eight of the ten Chinese warships, assuring Japan&#x27;s command of the Yellow Sea. The principal factor in the Japanese victory was its superiority in speed and firepower. The victory shattered the morale of the Chinese naval forces. The Battle of the Yalu River was the largest naval engagement of the war and was a major propaganda victory for Japan.

===Invasion of Manchuria===

After taking Pyongyang and defeating the Chinese fleet near the Yalu River, the Japanese focused on capturing China&#x27;s two naval bases guarding the approaches to the Qing capital: Port Arthur on the Liaodong Peninsula in northeast China (Manchuria), and Weihaiwei on the Shandong Peninsula, one on each side of the entrance to the Bohai Sea. Another force would capture Mukden, the main city in Manchuria. This plan included landing additional troops by ship near both naval bases, while the forces in Korea would march into Manchuria from the Korean border. After taking these objectives, the Imperial Japanese Army could make a pincer movement on Beijing.

With the defeat at Pyongyang, the Chinese abandoned northern Korea and took up defensive positions in fortifications along their side of the Yalu River at Jiuliancheng, with additional fortifications being built along the river bank to the north and to the south. The best equipped Chinese troops, the Huai Army, had been used for the defence of Korea, and after their defeat the Qing government had to deploy additional units to defend Manchuria, such as the partially-reformed Green Standard Army. The Chinese force at Jiuliancheng was commanded by General Song Qing.

The Japanese First Army under General Aritomo Yamagata marched from Pyongyang and arrived at the Yalu River on 23 October. On the 24th, the Japanese successfully crossed the Yalu River, undetected, by using a pontoon bridge. Yamagata planned to first attack the Chinese at Hushan, to the north of Jiuliancheng, to distract the defenders before then launching his main attack at their center in Jiuliancheng. The following afternoon of 25 October, they successfully captured Hushan, and intended to attack Jiuliancheng the next morning, but when they arrived there the Japanese found that the defenders had fled. The entire line of fortifications along the Yalu River, from Hushan to Andong in the south, had been abandoned by the Chinese by the 26th. They first withdrew to Fenghuangcheng, before abandoning that city on 30 October as the Japanese pursued them. The Japanese occupied it, and on 15 November they captured Xiuyan, a town west of Fenghuangcheng. After the Japanese established control over the border region, they planned on moving south along the coast to take Port Arthur and other towns in the area (including Jinzhou and Dalian), so they could land more troops. Song Qing&#x27;s forces retreated in the opposite direction, toward Mukden, because it was the homeland of Manchus and had symbolic importance for the Qing dynasty. The Japanese Second Army under General Ōyama Iwao arrived by ship near the peninsula on 24 October in preparation to advance on Port Arthur.

===Fall of Lüshunkou===
By 21 November 1894, the Japanese had taken the city of Lüshunkou (Port Arthur) with minimal resistance and suffering minimal casualties. Describing their motives as having encountered a display of the mutilated remains of Japanese soldiers as they invaded the town, Japanese forces proceeded with the unrestrained killing of civilians during the Port Arthur Massacre with unconfirmed estimates in the thousands. This event was at the time widely viewed with scepticism, as the world at large was still in disbelief that the Japanese were capable of such deedsit seemed more likely to have been exaggerated propagandist fabrications of a Chinese government to discredit Japanese hegemony. In reality, the Chinese government itself was unsure how to react and initially denied the occurrence of the loss of Port Arthur to the Japanese altogether.

By 10 December 1894, Kaipeng (present-day Gaizhou) fell to the Japanese First Army. That same month, Nozu Michitsura was given command of the First Army, replacing Yamagata who had fallen ill.

===Fall of Weihaiwei===

The Chinese fleet subsequently retreated behind the Weihaiwei fortifications. However, it was then surprised by Japanese ground forces, who outflanked the harbour&#x27;s defences in coordination with the navy. The Battle of Weihaiwei was a 23-day siege with the major land and naval engagements taking place between 20 January and 12 February 1895. Historian Jonathan Spence notes that &quot;the Chinese admiral retired his fleet behind a protective curtain of contact mines and took no further part in the fighting.&quot; The Japanese commander marched his forces over the Shandong peninsula and reached the landward side of Weihaiwei, where the siege was eventually successful for the Japanese.

===Advance in Manchuria and peace talks===
After Weihaiwei&#x27;s fall on 12 February 1895, and an easing of harsh winter conditions, Japanese troops pressed further into southern Manchuria and northern China. Two Chinese officials had been appointed by the Qing imperial court two months earlier and were sent to meet with Japanese representatives to inquire about peace terms. After some delay they arrived in late January, but the Japanese did not consider them to have enough credentials and noted that they had not been empowered by their government to make decisions. On 2 February 1895, the envoys were told by the Japanese government that their peace mission was not considered to be serious. After the failed talks, Japanese troops fought off a Chinese attempt to liberate the city of Haicheng on 16 February, and then went on to capture Liaoyang on 4 March and Yingkou on 6 March. This left no more Chinese forces between the Japanese and the Shanhai Pass, which connected Manchuria to Zhili, giving them control over the approaches to Tianjin and Beijing.

In late February the Qing government appointed Li Hongzhang as ambassador extraordinary to open peace talks with Japan, and the Japanese accepted this on 4 March, because he was seen as the leading Chinese statesman. Li and his delegation arrived in Shimonoseki, Japan, on the 19th and were met by the Japanese prime minister and foreign minister, Ito Hirobumi and Mutsu Munemitsu. The Chinese request for an armistice was rejected because the conditions that the Japanese insisted for it were unacceptable, and Li was informed that a Japanese invasion force was on its way to Taiwan. On 24 March, after leaving a meeting, Li was shot and injured by a Japanese nationalist. The incident caused international outrage from the Western press and led to the Meiji Emperor issuing a statement to show his grief and regret. An armistice in Manchuria and north China was agreed to on 30 March 1895, and negotiations for the final treaty continued for another three weeks.

===Occupation of the Pescadores Islands===
Even before the peace negotiations were set to begin at Shimonoseki, the Japanese had begun preparations for the capture of Taiwan. However, the first operation would be directed not against the island itself, but against the Pescadores Islands, which due to their strategic position off the west coast would become a stepping stone for further operations against the island. On 6 March, a Japanese expeditionary force consisting of a reinforced infantry regiment with 2,800 troops and an artillery battery were embarked on five transports, and sailed from Ujina to Sasebo, arriving there three days later. On 15 March, the five transports, escorted by seven cruisers and five torpedo boats of the 4th Flotilla, left Sasebo heading south. The Japanese fleet arrived at the Pescadores during the night of 20 March, but encountered stormy weather. Due to the poor weather, the landings were postponed until 23 March, when the weather cleared.

On the morning 23 March, the Japanese warships began the bombardment of the Chinese positions around the port of Lizhangjiao. A fort guarding the harbour was quickly silenced. At about midday, the Japanese troops began their landing. Unexpectedly, when the landing operation was underway, the guns of the fort once again opened fire, which caused some confusion among the Japanese troops. But they were soon silenced again after being shelled by the Japanese cruisers. By 14:00, Lizhangjiao was under Japanese control. After reinforcing the captured positions, the following morning, Japanese troops marched on the main town of Magong. The Chinese offered token resistance and after a short skirmish they abandoned their positions, retreating to nearby Xiyu Island. At 11:30, the Japanese entered Magong, but as soon as they had taken the coastal forts in the town, they were fired upon by the Chinese coastal battery on Xiyu Island. The barrage went unanswered until nightfall, as the Chinese had destroyed all the guns at Magong before they retreated, and Japanese warships feared entering the strait between the Penghu and Xiyu Islands due to the potential threat posed by mines. However, it caused no serious casualties among the Japanese forces. During the night, a small naval gunnery crew of 30 managed to make one of the guns of the Magong coastal battery operational. At dawn, the gun began shelling the Chinese positions on Xiyu, but the Chinese guns did not respond. Subsequently, the Japanese crossed the narrow strait, reaching Xiyu, discovering that the Chinese troops had abandoned their positions during the night and escaped on board local vessels.

The Japanese warships entered the strait the next day and, upon discovering that there were no mine fields, they entered Magong harbour. By 26 March, all the islands of the archipelago were under Japanese control, and Rear Admiral Tanaka Tsunatsune was appointed governor. During the campaign the Japanese lost 28 killed and wounded, while the Chinese losses were almost 350 killed or wounded and nearly 1,000 taken prisoner. This operation effectively prevented Chinese forces in Taiwan from being reinforced, and allowed the Japanese to press their demand for the cession of Taiwan in the peace negotiations.

==End of the war==
===Treaty of Shimonoseki===
The Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed on 17 April 1895. China recognised the total independence of Korea and ceded the Liaodong Peninsula, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands to Japan &quot;in perpetuity&quot;. The disputed islands known as &quot;Senkaku/Diaoyu&quot; islands were not named by this treaty, but Japan annexed these uninhabited islands to Okinawa Prefecture in 1895. Japan asserts this move was taken independently of the treaty ending the war, and China asserts that they were implied as part of the cession of Taiwan.

Additionally, China was to pay Japan 200 million taels (8,000,000 kg/17,600,000 lb) of silver as war reparations. The Qing government also signed a commercial treaty permitting Japanese ships to operate on the Yangtze River, to operate manufacturing factories in treaty ports and to open four more ports to foreign trade. Russia, Germany and France in a few days made the Triple Intervention, however, and forced Japan to give up the Liaodong Peninsula in exchange for another 30 million taels of silver (equivalent to about 450 million yen).

After the war, the Qing government paid 200 million Kuping taels, or 311,072,865 yen, making the war a net profit for Japan, as their war fund was only 250,000,000 yen.

===Japanese invasion of Taiwan===

&quot;The cession of the island to Japan was received with such disfavour by the Chinese inhabitants that a large military force was required to effect its occupation. For nearly two years afterwards, a bitter guerrilla resistance was offered to the Japanese troops, and large forces – over 100,000 men, it was stated at the time – were required for its suppression. This was not accomplished without much cruelty on the part of the conquerors, who, in their march through the island, perpetrated all the worst excesses of war. They had, undoubtedly, considerable provocation. They were constantly ambushed by enemies, and their losses from battle and disease far exceeded the entire loss of the whole Japanese army throughout the Manchurian campaign. But their revenge was often taken on innocent villagers. Men, women, and children were ruthlessly slaughtered or became the victims of unrestrained lust and rapine. The result was to drive from their homes thousands of industrious and peaceful peasants, who, long after the main resistance had been completely crushed, continued to wage a vendetta war, and to generate feelings of hatred which the succeeding years of conciliation and good government have not wholly eradicated.&quot; – The Cambridge Modern History, Volume 12
Several Qing officials in Taiwan resolved to resist the cession of Taiwan to Japan under the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and on 23 May declared the island to be an independent Republic of Formosa. On 29 May, Japanese forces under Admiral Kabayama Sukenori landed in northern Taiwan, and in a five-month campaign defeated the Republican forces and occupied the island&#x27;s main towns. The campaign effectively ended on 21 October 1895, with the flight of Liu Yongfu, the second Republican president, and the surrender of the Republican capital Tainan.

==Aftermath==

The Japanese success during the war was the result of the modernisation and industrialisation embarked upon two decades earlier. The war demonstrated the superiority of Japanese tactics and training from the adoption of a Western-style military. The Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy inflicted a string of defeats on the Chinese through foresight, endurance, strategy and power of organisation. Japan&#x27;s prestige rose in the eyes of the world, and the victory reflected the success of the Meiji Restoration. Japan suffered only a small loss of lives and treasure in return for the dominance of Taiwan, the Pescadores, and the Liaotung Peninsula in China. Its decisions of abandoning the policy of isolation and learning advanced policy from Western countries also became a good example for other Asian countries to follow. As a result of the war, Japan started to have equal status with the Western powers, and its victory established Japan as the dominant power in Asia, with them gaining several much needed resources such as iron for their continued modernisation and expansion. It also heightened Japanese ambitions of aggression and military expansion in Asia. Because Japan had benefited a lot from the treaty, it stimulated Japanese ambition to continue to invade China and made the Chinese national crisis unprecedentedly serious. The degree of semi-colonisation was greatly deepened. After Japan&#x27;s victory, the other imperialist powers thought that they could also get benefits from China. They then started to partition China over the next few years.
For China, the war revealed the high level of corruption present in the government and policies of the Qing administration. Although the Qing court had invested heavily in modern ships for the Beiyang Fleet, the institutional weakness of the Qing did not allow the development of effective naval power. Traditionally, China viewed Japan as a subordinate part of the Chinese cultural sphere. China had been defeated by European powers in the 19th century, but defeat at the hands of an Asian power was a bitter psychological blow. Xenophobic sentiment and agitation grew, which would culminate in the Boxer Rebellion five years later. The Manchu people were devastated by the fighting during the First Sino-Japanese War and the Boxer Rebellion, with massive casualties sustained during the wars. It was then driven into extreme suffering and hardship in Beijing and northeastern China.
Japan had achieved what it had set out to accomplish and ended Chinese influence over Korea, but it had been forced to relinquish the Liaodong Peninsula (Port Arthur) in exchange for an increased financial indemnity. The European powers, especially Russia, had no objection to the other clauses of the treaty but felt that Japan should not gain Port Arthur since they had their own ambitions in that part of the world. Russia persuaded Germany and France to join in applying diplomatic pressure on Japan, which resulted in the Triple Intervention of 23 April 1895.

Korea proclaimed itself the Korean Empire and announced its independence from the Qing Empire. The Japanese-sponsored Gabo Reforms of 1894–1896 transformed Korea. Legal slavery was abolished in all forms, the yangban class lost all special privileges, outcastes were abolished; equality of law was declared; equality of opportunity in the face of social background was established, child marriage was abolished; Hangul was to be used in government documents, Korean history was introduced in schools, the Chinese calendar was replaced with the Gregorian calendar, education was expanded, and new textbooks were written.

Although Japan had succeeded in eliminating Chinese influence over Korea, Russia seemed to reap the initial benefits. In 1895, a pro-Russian official attempted to remove the King of Korea to the Russian legation, and a second attempt later succeeded. Thus, for a year, the King reigned from the Russian legation in Seoul. The concession to build a Seoul-Inchon railway that had been granted to Japan in 1894 was revoked and granted to Russia. Russian guards guarded the king in his palace even after he had left the Russian legation.

China&#x27;s defeat precipitated an increase in railway construction in the country, as foreign powers demanded China make railway concessions.

In 1898, Russia signed a 25-year lease on the Liaodong Peninsula and proceeded to set up a naval station at Port Arthur. Although that infuriated the Japanese, they were more concerned with the Russian encroachment in Korea than in Manchuria. Other powers, such as France, Germany, and Britain, took advantage of the situation in China and gained land, port, and trade concessions at the expense of the decaying Qing dynasty. Qingdao was acquired by Germany, Guangzhouwan by France, and Weihaiwei and the New Territories by Britain.

Tensions between Russia and Japan would increase in the years after the First Sino-Japanese War. During the Boxer Rebellion, an eight-member international force was sent to suppress and quell the uprising; Russia sent troops into Manchuria as part of that force. After the suppression of the Boxers, the Russian government agreed to vacate the area. However, by 1903, it had actually increased the size of its forces in Manchuria.

Negotiations between the two nations (1901–1904) to establish mutual recognition of respective spheres of influence (Russia over Manchuria and Japan over Korea) were repeatedly and intentionally stalled by the Russians. They felt that they were strong and confident enough not to accept any compromise and believed that Japan would not go to war against a European power. Russia also had intentions to use Manchuria as a springboard for further expansion of its interests in the Far East. In 1903, Russian soldiers began construction of a fort at Yongnampo but stopped after Japanese protests.

In 1902, Japan formed an alliance with Britain, the terms of which stated that if Japan went to war in the Far East and a third power entered the fight against Japan, Britain would come to the aid of the Japanese. That was a check to prevent Germany or France from intervening militarily in any future war against Russia. Japan sought to prevent a repetition of the Triple Intervention, which deprived it of Port Arthur. The British reasons for joining the alliance were to check the spread of Russian expansion into the Pacific area, to strengthen Britain&#x27;s focus on other areas, and to gain a powerful naval ally in the Pacific.

Increasing tensions between Japan and Russia were results of Russia&#x27;s unwillingness to compromise and the prospect of Korea falling under Russia&#x27;s domination and thus coming into conflict with and undermining Japan&#x27;s interests. Eventually, Japan was forced to take action. That would be the deciding factor and catalyst leading to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05.

<text>Ooty (; officially Udagamandalam, anglicized: Ootacamund , abbreviated as Udagai) is a town and municipality in the Nilgiris district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is located northwest of Coimbatore, and is the headquarters of Nilgiris district. Situated in the Nilgiri hills, it is known by the epithet &quot;Queen of Hill Stations&quot;, and is a popular tourist destination.

Originally occupied by the Toda people, the area came under the rule of the East India Company in the 18th century. It later served as the summer capital of Madras Presidency. The economy is based on the hospitality industry serving tourism and agriculture. The town is connected to the plains by the Nilgiri ghat roads and Nilgiri Mountain Railway.

==Etymology==
The region was earlier known as &quot;Ottakal Mandu&quot;, with &quot;Otta-kal&quot; meaning &#x27;single stone&#x27; in Tamil, a reference to a sacred stone revered by the local Toda people and &quot; Mandu&quot;, a Toda word for &#x27;village&#x27;. This later became Udagamandalam which was anglicised to Ootacamund by the British, with the first part of the name (&quot;Ootaca&quot;), a corruption of the local name for the region and the second part (&quot;Mand&quot;), a shortening of the local Toda word &quot;Mandu&quot;. The first known written mention of the place is given as &quot;Wotokymund&quot; in a letter dated March 1821, written to the &quot;Madras Gazette&quot; by an unknown correspondent. &quot;Ootacamund&quot; was later shortened to &quot;Ooty&quot;. Ooty is in the Nilgiri hills, meaning the &quot;blue mountains&quot;, so named due to the Kurunji flower, which used to give the slopes a bluish tinge.

== History ==
The earliest reference to Nilgiri hills is found in the Tamil Sangam epic Silappathikaram from the 5th or 6th century CE. The region was a land occupied by various tribes such as Badagas, Todas, Kotas, Irulas and Kurumbas. The region was ruled by the three Tamil kingdoms of Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas during various times. The Todas are referenced in a record belonging to Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana and his general Punisa, dated 1117 CE. It was also ruled by various dynasties like Pallavas, Satavahanas, Gangas, Kadambas, Rashtrakutas, Hoysalas and the Vijayanagara empire. Tipu Sultan captured Nilgiris in the eighteenth century and the region came into possession of British in 1799. It became part of Coimbatore district of the Madras Presidency.

In 1818, J. C. Whish and N. W. Kindersley, assistants to John Sullivan, then collector of Coimbatore district, visited Kotagiri nearby and reported on the region&#x27;s potential to serve as a summer retreat. Sullivan established his residence there and reported to the Board of Revenue on 31 July 1819.

In August 1868, the Nilgiris was separated from the Coimbatore district, and James Wilkinson Breeks was appointed its first commissioner. On 1 February 1882, Nilgiris was made a district, and Richard Wellesley Barlow, the then commissioner, became its first collector. By the early 20th century, Ooty was a well-developed hill station, with an artificial lake, various parks, religious structures, and sporting facilities for polo, golf, and cricket.

<text>Sir William Hunter McCrea (13 December 1904 – 25 April 1999) was an English astronomer and mathematician.

==Biography==
He was born in Dublin in Ireland on 13 December 1904.

His family moved to Kent in 1906 and then to Derbyshire where he attended Chesterfield Grammar School. His father was a school master at Netherthorpe Grammar School in Staveley. He went to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1923 where he studied Mathematics, later gaining a PhD in 1929 under Ralph H. Fowler.

From 1930 he lectured in Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. During his time in Edinburgh (in 1931) he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Edmund Taylor Whittaker, Sir Charles Galton Darwin, Edward Copson and Charles Glover Barkla. He won the Society&#x27;s Keith Medal (jointly with Edward Copson) for the period 1939–41.

In 1932 he moved to Imperial College London as a Reader. In 1936 he became Professor of Mathematics and head of the mathematics department at the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast.

In the Second World War he was co-opted onto the Admiralty Operational Research Group. 

After the war, he joined the mathematics department at Royal Holloway College where he remained a professor for twenty years. The McCrea Building on Royal Holloway&#x27;s campus is named after him. 

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1952.

In 1965, McCrea created the astronomy centre of the physics department at the University of Sussex.

McCrea died on 25 April 1999 at Lewes in Sussex.

==Family==

In 1933 he married Marian Core (d. 1995) and had three children.

==Discoveries==
In 1928, he studied Albrecht Unsöld&#x27;s hypothesis, and discovered that three-quarters of the Sun is made of hydrogen, and about one quarter is helium, with 1% being other elements. Previous to this many people thought the Sun consisted mostly of iron. After this, people realised most stars consist of hydrogen.

In 1964 he proposed mass transfer mechanism as an explanation of blue straggler stars.

==Awards==

McCrea was president of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1961 to 1963 and president of Section A of the British Association for the Advancement of Science from 1965 to 1966.

He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1985. He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1976.

<doc id="69980" wikidata="Q170314" url="?curid=69980" title="Second Sino-Japanese War">
<text>The Second Sino-Japanese War was fought between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan between 1937 and 1945, following a period of war localized to Manchuria that started in 1931. It is considered part of World War II, and often regarded as the beginning of World War II in Asia. It was the largest Asian war in the 20th century and has been described as &quot;the Asian Holocaust&quot;, in reference to the scale of Japanese war crimes against Chinese civilians. It is known in China as the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression ().

On 18 September 1931, the Japanese staged the Mukden incident, a false flag event fabricated to justify their invasion of Manchuria and establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo. This is sometimes marked as the beginning of the war. From 1931 to 1937, China and Japan engaged in skirmishes, including in Shanghai and in Northern China. Chinese Nationalist and Communist forces, respectively led by Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong, had fought each other in the Chinese Civil War since 1927. In late 1933, Chiang Kai-shek encircled the Chinese Communists in an attempt to finally destroy them, forcing the Communists into the Long March, resulting in the Communists losing around 90% of their men. As a Japanese invasion became imminent, Chiang still refused to form a united front before he was placed under house arrest by his subordinates who forced him to form the Second United Front in late 1936 in order to resist the Japanese invasion together.

The full-scale war began on 7 July 1937 with the Marco Polo Bridge incident near Beijing, which prompted a full-scale Japanese invasion of the rest of China. The Japanese captured the capital of Nanjing in 1937 and perpetrated the Nanjing Massacre. After failing to stop the Japanese capture of Wuhan in 1938, then China&#x27;s de facto capital at the time, the Nationalist government relocated to Chongqing in the Chinese interior. After the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, Soviet aid bolstered the National Revolutionary Army and Air Force. By 1939, after Chinese victories at Changsha and with Japan&#x27;s lines of communications stretched deep into the interior, the war reached a stalemate. The Japanese were unable to defeat Chinese Communist Party forces in Shaanxi, who waged a campaign of sabotage and guerrilla warfare. In November 1939, Chinese nationalist forces launched a large scale winter offensive, and in August 1940, communist forces launched the Hundred Regiments Offensive in central China.

In December 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and declared war on the United States. The US increased its aid to China under the Lend-Lease Act, becoming its main financial and military supporter. With Burma cut off, the United States Army Air Forces airlifted material over the Himalayas. In 1944, Japan launched Operation Ichi-Go, the invasion of Henan and Changsha. In 1945, the Chinese Expeditionary Force resumed its advance in Burma and completed the Ledo Road linking India to China. China launched large counteroffensives in South China and repulsed a failed Japanese invasion of West Hunan and recaptured Japanese occupied regions of Guangxi.

Japan formally surrendered on 2 September 1945, following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Soviet declaration of war and subsequent invasions of Manchukuo and Korea. The war resulted in the deaths of around 20 million people, mostly Chinese civilians. China was recognized as one of the Four Policemen, regained all territories lost, and became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The Chinese Civil War resumed in 1946, ending with a communist victory and the Proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949.

==Names==
In China, the war is most commonly known as the &quot;War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression&quot; (), and shortened to &quot;Resistance against Japanese Aggression&quot; () or the &quot;War of Resistance&quot; (). It was also called the &quot;Eight Years&#x27; War of Resistance&quot; (), but in 2017 the Chinese Ministry of Education issued a directive stating that textbooks were to refer to the war as the &quot;Fourteen Years&#x27; War of Resistance&quot; (), reflecting a focus on the broader conflict with Japan going back to the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria. According to historian Rana Mitter, historians in China are unhappy with the blanket revision, and (despite sustained tensions) the Republic of China did not consider itself to be in an ongoing war with Japan over these six years. It is also referred to as part of the &quot;Global Anti-Fascist War&quot;.

In contemporary Japan, the name &quot;Japan–China War&quot; () is most commonly used because of its perceived objectivity. When the invasion of China proper began in earnest in July 1937 near Beijing, the government of Japan used &quot;The North China Incident&quot; (), and with the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai the following month, it was changed to &quot;The China Incident&quot; ().

The word &quot;incident&quot; () was used by Japan, as neither country had made a formal declaration of war. From the Japanese perspective, localizing these conflicts was beneficial in preventing intervention from other countries, particularly the United Kingdom and the United States, which were its primary source of petroleum and steel respectively. A formal expression of these conflicts would potentially lead to an American embargo in accordance with the Neutrality Acts of the 1930s. In addition, due to China&#x27;s fractured political status, Japan often claimed that China was no longer a recognizable political entity on which war could be declared.

===Other names===
In Japanese propaganda, the invasion of China became a crusade (), the first step of the &quot;eight corners of the world under one roof&quot; slogan (). In 1940, Japanese prime minister Fumimaro Konoe launched the Taisei Yokusankai. When both sides formally declared war in December 1941, the name was replaced by &quot;Greater East Asia War&quot; ().

Although the Japanese government still uses the term &quot;China Incident&quot; in formal documents, the word &quot;Shina&quot; is considered derogatory by China and therefore the media in Japan often paraphrase with other expressions like &quot;The Japan–China Incident&quot; (), which were used by media as early as the 1930s.

The name &quot;Second Sino-Japanese War&quot; is not commonly used in Japan as the China it fought a war against in 1894 to 1895 was led by the Qing dynasty, and thus is called the Qing-Japanese War (), rather than the First Sino-Japanese War.

Another term for the second war between Japan and China is the &quot;Japanese invasion of China&quot;, a term used mainly in foreign and Chinese narratives.

==Background==
The origins of the Second Sino-Japanese War can be traced to the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), in which China, then under the rule of the Qing dynasty, was defeated by Japan and forced to cede Taiwan and recognize the full and complete independence of Korea in the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Japan also annexed the Senkaku Islands, which Japan claims were uninhabited, in early 1895 as a result of its victory at the end of the war. Japan had also attempted to annex the Liaodong Peninsula following the war, though was forced to return it to China following the Triple Intervention by France, Germany, and Russia. The Qing dynasty was on the brink of collapse due to internal revolts and the imposition of the unequal treaties, while Japan had emerged as a great power through its efforts to modernize. In 1905, Japan successfully defeated the Russian Empire in the Russo-Japanese War, gaining Dalian and southern Sakhalin and establishing a protectorate over Korea.

===Warlords in the Republic of China===
In 1911, factions of the Qing Army uprose against the government, staging a revolution that swept across China&#x27;s southern provinces. The Qing responded by appointing Yuan Shikai, commander of the loyalist Beiyang Army, as temporary prime minister in order to subdue the revolution. Yuan, wanting to remain in power, compromised with the revolutionaries, and agreed to abolish the monarchy and establish a new republican government, under the condition he be appointed president of China. The new Beiyang government of China was proclaimed in March 1912, after which Yuan Shikai began to amass power for himself. In 1913, the parliamentary political leader Song Jiaoren was assassinated; it is generally believed Yuan Shikai ordered the assassination. Yuan Shikai then forced the parliament to pass a bill to strengthen the power of the president and sought to restore the imperial system, becoming the new emperor of China.

However, there was little support for an imperial restoration among the general population, and protests and demonstrations soon broke out across the country. Yuan&#x27;s attempts at restoring the monarchy triggered the National Protection War, and Yuan Shikai was overthrown after only a few months. In the aftermath of Shikai&#x27;s death in June 1916, control of China fell into the hands of the Beiyang Army leadership. The Beiyang government was a civilian government in name, but in practice it was a military dictatorship with a different warlord controlling each province of the country. China was reduced to a fractured state. As a result, China&#x27;s prosperity began to wither and its economy declined. This instability presented an opportunity for nationalistic politicians in Japan to press for territorial expansion.

===Twenty-One Demands===
In 1915, Japan issued the Twenty-One Demands to extort further political and commercial privilege from China, which was accepted by the regime of Yuan Shikai. Following World War I, Japan acquired the German Empire&#x27;s sphere of influence in Shandong province, leading to nationwide anti-Japanese protests and mass demonstrations in China. The country remained fragmented under the Beiyang Government and was unable to resist foreign incursions. For the purpose of unifying China and defeating the regional warlords, the Kuomintang (KMT) in Guangzhou launched the Northern Expedition from 1926 to 1928 with limited assistance from the Soviet Union.

===Jinan incident===
The National Revolutionary Army (NRA) formed by the Kuomintang swept through southern and central China until it was checked in Shandong, where confrontations with the Japanese garrison escalated into armed conflict. The conflicts were collectively known as the Jinan incident of 1928, during which time the Japanese military killed several Chinese officials and fired artillery shells into Jinan. According to the investigation results of the Association of the Families of the Victims of the Jinan massacre, it showed that 6,123 Chinese civilians were killed and 1,701 injured. Relations between the Chinese Nationalist government and Japan severely worsened as a result of the Jinan incident.

===Reunification of China (1928)===
As the National Revolutionary Army approached Beijing, Zhang Zuolin decided to retreat back to Manchuria, before he was assassinated by the Kwantung Army in 1928. His son, Zhang Xueliang, took over as the leader of the Fengtian clique in Manchuria. Later in the same year, Zhang declared his allegiance to the Nationalist government in Nanjing under Chiang Kai-shek, and consequently, China was nominally reunified under one government.

===1929 Sino-Soviet war===
The July–November 1929 conflict over the Chinese Eastern Railroad (CER) further increased the tensions in the Northeast that led to the Mukden Incident and eventually the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Soviet Red Army victory over Xueliang&#x27;s forces not only reasserted Soviet control over the CER in Manchuria but revealed Chinese military weaknesses that Japanese Kwantung Army officers were quick to note.

The Soviet Red Army performance also stunned the Japanese. Manchuria was central to Japan&#x27;s East Asia policy. Both the 1921 and 1927 Imperial Eastern Region Conferences reconfirmed Japan&#x27;s commitment to be the dominant power in the Northeast. The 1929 Red Army victory shook that policy to the core and reopened the Manchurian problem. By 1930, the Kwantung Army realized they faced a Red Army that was only growing stronger. The time to act was drawing near and Japanese plans to conquer the Northeast were accelerated.

===Chinese Communist Party===
In 1930, the Central Plains War broke out across China, involving regional commanders who had fought in alliance with the Kuomintang during the Northern Expedition, and the Nanjing government under Chiang. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) previously fought openly against the Nanjing government after the Shanghai massacre of 1927, and they continued to expand during this protracted civil war. The Kuomintang government in Nanjing decided to focus their efforts on suppressing the Chinese Communists through the Encirclement Campaigns, following the policy of &quot;first internal pacification, then external resistance&quot; ().

After the defeat of the Chinese Soviet Republic by the Nationalists, the Communists retreated on the Long March to Yan&#x27;an. The Nationalist government ordered local warlords to continue the campaign against the Communists rather than focus on the Japanese threat. A December 1936 coup by two Nationalist Generals, the Xi&#x27;an Incident, forced Chiang Kai-shek to accept a United Front with the Communists to oppose Japan.

==Invasion of Manchuria and Northern China==

The internecine warfare in China provided excellent opportunities for Japan, which saw Manchuria as a limitless supply of raw materials, a market for its manufactured goods (now excluded from the markets of many Western countries as a result of Depression-era tariffs), and a protective buffer state against the Soviet Union in Siberia. As a result, the Japanese Army was widely prevalent in Manchuria immediately following the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, where Japan gained significant territory in Manchuria. As a result of their strengthened position, by 1915 Japan had negotiated a significant amount of economic privilege in the region by pressuring Yuan Shikai, the president of the Republic of China at the time. With a widened range of economic privileges in Manchuria, Japan began focusing on developing and protecting matters of economic interests. This included railroads, businesses, natural resources, and a general control of the territory. With its influence growing, the Japanese Army began to justify its presence by stating that it was simply protecting its own economic interests. However militarists in the Japanese Army began pushing for an expansion of influence, leading to the Japanese Army assassinating the warlord of Manchuria, Zhang Zuolin. This was done with hopes that it would start a crisis that would allow Japan to expand their power and influence in the region. When this was not as successful as they desired, Japan then decided to invade Manchuria outright after the Mukden incident in September 1931. Japanese soldiers set off a bomb on the Southern Manchurian Railroad in order to provoke an opportunity to act in &quot;self defense&quot; and invade outright. Japan charged that its rights in Manchuria, which had been established as a result of its victory in 1905 at the end of the Russo-Japanese War, had been systematically violated and there were &quot;more than 120 cases of infringement of rights and interests, interference with business, boycott of Japanese goods, unreasonable taxation, detention of individuals, confiscation of properties, eviction, demand for cessation of business, assault and battery, and the oppression of Korean residents&quot;.

After five months of fighting, Japan established the puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932, and installed the last Emperor of China, Puyi, as its puppet ruler. Militarily too weak to challenge Japan directly, China appealed to the League of Nations for help. The League&#x27;s investigation led to the publication of the Lytton Report, condemning Japan for its incursion into Manchuria, causing Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations. No country took action against Japan beyond tepid censure. From 1931 until summer 1937, the Nationalist Army under Chiang Kai-shek did little to oppose Japanese encroachment into China.

Incessant fighting followed the Mukden Incident. In 1932, Chinese and Japanese troops fought the 28 January battle. This resulted in the demilitarization of Shanghai, which forbade the Chinese to deploy troops in their own city. In Manchukuo there was an ongoing campaign to pacify the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies that arose from widespread outrage over the policy of non-resistance to Japan. On 15 April 1932, the Chinese Soviet Republic led by the Communists declared war on Japan.

In 1933, the Japanese attacked the Great Wall region. The Tanggu Truce established in its aftermath, gave Japan control of Rehe Province, as well as a demilitarized zone between the Great Wall and Beijing-Tianjin region. Japan aimed to create another buffer zone between Manchukuo and the Chinese Nationalist government in Nanjing.

Japan increasingly exploited China&#x27;s internal conflicts to reduce the strength of its fractious opponents. Even years after the Northern Expedition, the political power of the Nationalist government was limited to just the area of the Yangtze River Delta. Other sections of China were essentially in the hands of local Chinese warlords. Japan sought various Chinese collaborators and helped them establish governments friendly to Japan. This policy was called the &quot;Specialization&quot; of North China (), more commonly known as the North China Autonomous Movement. The northern provinces affected by this policy were Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong.

This Japanese policy was most effective in the area of what is now Inner Mongolia and Hebei. In 1935, under Japanese pressure, China signed the He–Umezu Agreement, which forbade the KMT to conduct party operations in Hebei. In the same year, the Chin–Doihara Agreement was signed expelling the KMT from Chahar. Thus, by the end of 1935 the Chinese government had essentially abandoned northern China. In its place, the Japanese-backed East Hebei Autonomous Council and the Hebei–Chahar Political Council were established. There in the empty space of Chahar the Mongol military government was formed on 12 May 1936. Japan provided all the necessary military and economic aid. Afterwards Chinese volunteer forces continued to resist Japanese aggression in Manchuria, and Chahar and Suiyuan.

Some Chinese historians believe the 18 September 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria marks the start of the War of Resistance. Although not the conventional Western view, British historian Rana Mitter describes this Chinese trend of historical analysis as &quot;perfectly reasonable&quot;. In 2017, the Chinese government officially announced that it would adopt this view. Under this interpretation, the 1931–1937 period is viewed as the &quot;partial&quot; war, while 1937–1945 is a period of &quot;total&quot; war. This view of a fourteen-year war has political significance because it provides more recognition for the role of northeast China in the War of Resistance.

==1937: Full-scale invasion of China==

On the night of 7 July 1937, Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo (or Lugou) Bridge about 16 km from Beijing. The initial confused and sporadic skirmishing soon escalated into a full-scale battle.

Unlike Japan, China was unprepared for total war and had little military-industrial strength, no mechanized divisions, and few armoured forces.

Within the first year of full-scale war, Japanese forces obtained victories in most major Chinese cities.

===Battle of Beiping–Tianjin===
On 11 July, in accordance with the Goso conference, the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff authorized the deployment of an infantry division from the Chōsen Army, two combined brigades from the Kwantung Army and an air regiment composed of 18 squadrons as reinforcements to Northern China. By 20 July, total Japanese military strength in the Beijing-Tianjin area exceeded 180,000 personnel.

The Japanese gave Sung and his troops &quot;free passage&quot; before moving in to pacify resistance in areas surrounding Beijing (then Beiping) and Tianjin. After 24 days of combat, the Chinese 29th Army was forced to withdraw. The Japanese captured Beijing and the Taku Forts at Tianjin on 29 and 30 July respectively, thus concluding the Beijing-Tianjin campaign. By August 1937, Japan had occupied Beijing and Tianjin.

However, the Japanese Army had been given orders not to advance further than the Yongding River. In a sudden volte-face, the Konoe government&#x27;s foreign minister opened negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s government in Nanjing and stated: &quot;Japan wants Chinese cooperation, not Chinese land.&quot; Nevertheless, negotiations failed to move further. The Ōyama Incident on 9 August escalated the skirmishes and battles into full scale warfare.

The 29th Army&#x27;s resistance (and poor equipment) inspired the 1937 &quot;Sword March&quot;, which—with slightly reworked lyrics—became the National Revolutionary Army&#x27;s standard marching cadence and popularized the racial epithet &quot;guizi&quot; to describe the Japanese invaders.

===Battle of Shanghai===

The Imperial General Headquarters (GHQ) in Tokyo, content with the gains acquired in northern China following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, initially showed reluctance to escalate the conflict into a full-scale war. Following the shooting of two Japanese officers who were attempting to enter the Hongqiao military airport on 9 August 1937, the Japanese demanded that all Chinese forces withdraw from Shanghai; the Chinese outright refused to meet this demand. In response, both the Chinese and the Japanese marched reinforcements into the Shanghai area. Chiang concentrated his best troops north of Shanghai in an effort to impress the city&#x27;s large foreign community and increase China&#x27;s foreign support.

On 13 August 1937, Kuomintang soldiers attacked Japanese Marine positions in Shanghai, with Japanese army troops and marines in turn crossing into the city with naval gunfire support at Zhabei, leading to the Battle of Shanghai. On 14 August, Chinese forces under the command of Zhang Zhizhong were ordered to capture or destroy the Japanese strongholds in Shanghai, leading to bitter street fighting. In an attack on the Japanese cruiser &quot;Izumo&quot;, Kuomintang planes accidentally bombed the Shanghai International Settlement, which led to more than 3,000 civilian deaths.

In the three days from 14 to 16 August 1937, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) sent many sorties of the then-advanced long-ranged G3M medium-heavy land-based bombers and assorted carrier-based aircraft with the expectation of destroying the Chinese Air Force. However, the Imperial Japanese Navy encountered unexpected resistance from the defending Chinese Curtiss Hawk II/Hawk III and P-26/281 Peashooter fighter squadrons; suffering heavy (50%) losses from the defending Chinese pilots (14 August was subsequently commemorated by the KMT as China&#x27;s &quot;Air Force Day&quot;).

The skies of China had become a testing zone for advanced biplane and new-generation monoplane combat-aircraft designs. The introduction of the advanced A5M &quot;Claude&quot; fighters into the Shanghai-Nanjing theater of operations, beginning on 18 September 1937, helped the Japanese achieve a certain level of air superiority. However the few experienced Chinese veteran pilots, as well as several Chinese-American volunteer fighter pilots, including Maj. Art Chin, Maj. John Wong Pan-yang, and Capt. Chan Kee-Wong, even in their older and slower biplanes, proved more than able to hold their own against the sleek A5Ms in dogfights, and it also proved to be a battle of attrition against the Chinese Air Force. At the start of the battle, the local strength of the NRA was around five divisions, or about 70,000 troops, while local Japanese forces comprised about 6,300 marines. On 23 August, the Chinese Air Force attacked Japanese troop landings at Wusongkou in northern Shanghai with Hawk III fighter-attack planes and P-26/281 fighter escorts, and the Japanese intercepted most of the attack with A2N and A4N fighters from the aircraft carriers &quot;Hosho&quot; and &quot;Ryujo&quot;, shooting down several of the Chinese planes while losing a single A4N in the dogfight with Lt. Huang Xinrui in his P-26/281; the Japanese Army reinforcements succeeded in landing in northern Shanghai. The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) ultimately committed over 300,000 troops, along with numerous naval vessels and aircraft, to capture the city. After more than three months of intense fighting, their casualties far exceeded initial expectations. On 26 October, the IJA captured Dachang, a key strong-point within Shanghai, and on 5 November, additional reinforcements from Japan landed in Hangzhou Bay. Finally, on 9 November, the NRA began a general retreat.

Japan did not immediately occupy the Shanghai International Settlement or the Shanghai French Concession, areas which were outside of China&#x27;s control due to the treaty port system. Japan moved into these areas after its 1941 declaration of war against the United States and the United Kingdom.

===Battle of Nanjing and massacre===

In November 1937, the Japanese concentrated 220,000 soldiers and began a campaign against Nanjing. Building on the hard-won victory in Shanghai, the IJA advanced on and captured the KMT capital city of Nanjing (December 1937) and Northern Shanxi (SeptemberNovember 1937).

Japanese forces inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese soldiers defending the city, killing approximately 50,000 of them including 17 Chinese generals. Upon the capture of Nanjing, Japanese committed massive war atrocities including mass murder and rape of Chinese civilians after 13 December 1937, which has been referred to as the Nanjing Massacre. Over the next several weeks, Japanese troops perpetrated numerous mass executions and tens of thousands of rapes. The army looted and burned the surrounding towns and the city, destroying more than a third of the buildings.

The number of Chinese killed in the massacre has been subject to much debate, with estimates ranging from 100,000 to more than 300,000. The numbers agreed upon by most scholars are provided by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, which estimate at least 200,000 murders and 20,000 rapes.

The Japanese atrocities in Nanjing, especially following the Chinese defense of Shanghai, increased international goodwill for the Chinese people and the Chinese government.

The Nationalist government re-established itself in Chongqing, which became the wartime seat of government until 1945.

==1938==
By January 1938, most conventional Kuomintang forces had either been defeated or no longer offered major resistance to Japanese advances. KMT forces won a few victories in 1938 (the Battle of Taierzhuang and the Battle of Wanjialing) but were generally ineffective that year. By March 1938, the Japanese controlled almost all of North China. Communist-led rural resistance to the Japanese remained active, however.

===Battles of Xuzhou and Taierzhuang===
With many victories achieved, Japanese field generals escalated the war in Jiangsu in an attempt to wipe out the Chinese forces in the area. The Japanese managed to overcome Chinese resistance around Bengbu and the Teng xian, but were fought to a halt at Linyi.

The Japanese were then decisively defeated at the Battle of Taierzhuang (March–April 1938), where the Chinese used night attacks and close quarters combat to overcome Japanese advantages in firepower. The Chinese also severed Japanese supply lines from the rear, forcing the Japanese to retreat in the first Chinese victory of the war.

The Japanese then attempted to surround and destroy the Chinese armies in the Xuzhou region with an enormous pincer movement. However the majority of the Chinese forces, some 200,000-300,000 troops in 40 divisions, managed to break out of the encirclement and retreat to defend Wuhan, the Japanese&#x27;s next target.

===Battle of Wuhan===
Following Xuzhou, the IJA changed its strategy and deployed almost all of its existing armies in China to attack the city of Wuhan, which had become the political, economic and military center of China, in hopes of destroying the fighting strength of the NRA and forcing the KMT government to negotiate for peace. On 6 June, they captured Kaifeng, the capital of Henan, and threatened to take Zhengzhou, the junction of the Pinghan and Longhai railways.

The Japanese forces, numbering some 400,000 men, were faced by over 1 million NRA troops in the Central Yangtze region. Having learned from their defeats at Shanghai and Nanjing, the Chinese had adapted themselves to fight the Japanese and managed to check their forces on many fronts, slowing and sometimes reversing the Japanese advances, as in the case of Wanjialing.

To overcome Chinese resistance, Japanese forces frequently deployed poison gas and committed atrocities against civilians, such as a &quot;mini-Nanjing Massacre&quot; in the city of Jiujiang upon its capture. After four months of intense combat, the Nationalists were forced to abandon Wuhan by October, and its government and armies retreated to Chongqing. Both sides had suffered tremendous casualties in the battle, with the Chinese losing up to 500,000 soldiers killed or wounded, and the Japanese up to 200,000.

===Communist resistance===
After their victory at Wuhan, Japan advanced deep into Communist territory and redeployed 50,000 troops to the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region. Elements of the Eighth Route Army soon attacked the advancing Japanese, inflicting between 3,000 and 5,000 casualties and resulting in a Japanese retreat. The Eighth Route Army carried out guerilla operations and established military and political bases. As the Japanese military came to understand that the Communists avoided conventional attacks and defense, it altered its tactics. The Japanese military built more roads to quicken movement between strongpoints and cities, blockaded rivers and roads in an effort to disrupt Communists supply, sought to expand militia from its puppet regime to conserve manpower, and use systematic violence on civilians in the Border Region in an effort to destroy its economy. The Japanese military mandated confiscation of the Eighth Route Army&#x27;s goods and used this directive as a pretext to confiscate goods, including engaging in grave robbery in the Border Region.

With Japanese casualties and costs mounting, the Imperial General Headquarters attempted to break Chinese resistance by ordering the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service and Imperial Japanese Army Air Service to launch the war&#x27;s first massive air raids on civilian targets. Japanese raiders hit the Kuomintang&#x27;s newly established provisional capital of Chongqing and most other major cities in unoccupied China, leaving many people either dead, injured, or homeless.

===Yellow River flood===

==1939–1943==

By 1939, the Nationalist army had withdrawn to the southwest and northwest of China and the Japanese controlled the coastal cities that been centres of Nationalist power. From 1939 to 1945, China was divided into three regions: Japanese-occupied territories (&quot;Lunxianqu&quot;), the Nationalist-controlled region (&quot;Guotongqu&quot;), and the Communist-controlled regions (&quot;Jiefangqu,&quot; or liberated areas).

From the beginning of 1939, the war entered a new phase with the unprecedented defeat of the Japanese at Battle of Suixian–Zaoyang and First Battle of Changsha. These outcomes encouraged the Chinese to launch their first large-scale counter-offensive against the IJA in December 1939; however, due to its low military-industrial capacity and limited experience in modern warfare, this offensive was defeated. Afterwards Chiang could not risk any more all-out offensive campaigns given the poorly trained, under-equipped, and disorganized state of his armies and opposition to his leadership both within the Kuomintang and in China in general. He had lost a substantial portion of his best trained and equipped troops in the Battle of Shanghai and was at times at the mercy of his generals, who maintained a high degree of autonomy from the central KMT government.

During the offensive, Hui forces in Suiyuan under generals Ma Hongbin and Ma Buqing routed the Imperial Japanese Army and their puppet Inner Mongol forces and prevented the planned Japanese advance into northwest China. Ma Hongbin&#x27;s father Ma Fulu had fought against Japanese in the Boxer Rebellion. General Ma Biao led Hui, Salar and Dongxiang cavalry to defeat the Japanese at the Battle of Huaiyang. Ma Biao fought against the Japanese in the Boxer Rebellion.

After 1940, the Japanese encountered tremendous difficulties in administering and garrisoning the seized territories, and tried to solve their occupation problems by implementing a strategy of creating friendly puppet governments favourable to Japanese interests in the territories conquered. This included prominently the regime headed by Wang Jingwei, one of Chiang&#x27;s rivals in the KMT. However, atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese Army, as well as Japanese refusal to delegate any real power, left the puppets very unpopular and largely ineffective. The only success the Japanese had was to recruit a large Collaborationist Chinese Army to maintain public security in the occupied areas.

===Japanese expansion===
By 1941, Japan held most of the eastern coastal areas of China and Vietnam, but guerrilla fighting continued in these occupied areas. Japan had suffered high casualties which resulted from unexpectedly stubborn Chinese resistance, and neither side could make any swift progress in the manner of Nazi Germany in Western Europe.

By 1943, Guangdong had experienced famine. As the situation worsened, New York Chinese compatriots received a letter stating that 600,000 people were killed in Siyi by starvation.

===Second phase: October 1938 – December 1941===
During this period, the main Chinese objective was to drag out the war for as long as possible in a war of attrition, thereby exhausting Japanese resources while it was building up China&#x27;s military capacity. American general Joseph Stilwell called this strategy &quot;winning by outlasting&quot;. The NRA adopted the concept of &quot;magnetic warfare&quot; to attract advancing Japanese troops to definite points where they were subjected to ambush, flanking attacks, and encirclements in major engagements. The most prominent example of this tactic was the successful defense of Changsha in 1939, and again in the 1941 battle, in which heavy casualties were inflicted on the IJA.

Local Chinese resistance forces, organized separately by both the CCP and the KMT, continued their resistance in occupied areas to make Japanese administration over the vast land area of China difficult. In 1940, the Chinese Red Army launched a major offensive in north China, destroying railways and a major coal mine. These constant guerilla and sabotage operations deeply frustrated the Imperial Japanese Army and they led them to employ the Three Alls Policy—kill all, loot all, burn all. It was during this period that the bulk of Japanese war crimes were committed.

By 1941, Japan had occupied much of north and coastal China, but the KMT central government and military had retreated to the western interior to continue their resistance, while the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in Shaanxi. In the occupied areas, Japanese control was mainly limited to railroads and major cities (&quot;points and lines&quot;). They did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast Chinese countryside, where Chinese guerrillas roamed freely.

From 1941 to 1942, Japan concentrated most of its forces in China in an effort to defeat the Communist bases behind Japan&#x27;s lines. To decrease guerilla&#x27;s human and material resources, the Japanese military implemented its Three Alls policy (&quot;Kill all, loot all, burn all&quot;). In response, the Communist armies increased their role in production activities, including farming, raising hogs, and cloth-making.

===Relationship between the Nationalists and the Communists===
After the Mukden Incident in 1931, Chinese public opinion was strongly critical of Manchuria&#x27;s leader, the &quot;young marshal&quot; Zhang Xueliang, for his non-resistance to the Japanese invasion, even though the Kuomintang central government was also responsible for this policy, giving Zhang an order to improvise while not offering support. After losing Manchuria to the Japanese, Zhang and his Northeast Army were given the duty of suppressing the Red Army in Shaanxi after their Long March. This resulted in great casualties for his Northeast Army, which received no support in manpower or weaponry from Chiang Kai-shek.

In the Xi&#x27;an Incident that took place on 12 December 1936, Zhang Xueliang kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek in Xi&#x27;an, hoping to force an end to KMT–CCP conflict. To secure the release of Chiang, the KMT agreed to a temporary ceasefire with the Communists. On 24 December, the two parties agreed to a United Front against Japan; this had salutary effects for the beleaguered Communists, who agreed to form the New Fourth Army and the 8th Route Army under the nominal control of the NRA. In addition, Shaan-Gan-Ning and Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei border regions were created, under the control of the CCP. In Shaan-Gan-Ning, Communists in the Shaan-Gan-Ning Base Area fostered opium production, taxed it, and engaged in its trade—including selling to Japanese-occupied and KMT-controlled provinces. The Red Army fought alongside KMT forces during the Battle of Taiyuan, and the high point of their cooperation came in 1938 during the Battle of Wuhan.

The formation of a united front added to the legality of the CCP, but what kind of support the central government would provide to the communists were not settled. When compromise with the CCP failed to incentivize the Soviet Union to engage in an open conflict against Japan, the KMT withheld further support for the Communists. To strengthen their legitimacy, Communist forces actively engaged the Japanese early on. These operations weakened Japanese forces in Shanxi and other areas in the North. Mao Zedong was distrustful of Chiang Kai-shek, however, and shifted strategy to guerrilla warfare in order to preserve the CCP&#x27;s military strength.

Despite Japan&#x27;s steady territorial gains in northern China, the coastal regions, and the rich Yangtze River Valley in central China, the distrust between the two antagonists was scarcely veiled. The uneasy alliance began to break down by late 1938, partially due to the Communists&#x27; aggressive efforts to expand their military strength by absorbing Chinese guerrilla forces behind Japanese lines. Chinese militia who refused to switch their allegiance were often labelled &quot;collaborators&quot; and attacked by CCP forces. For example, the Red Army led by He Long attacked and wiped out a brigade of Chinese militia led by Zhang Yin-wu in Hebei in June 1939. Starting in 1940, open conflict between Nationalists and Communists became more frequent in the occupied areas outside of Japanese control, culminating in the New Fourth Army Incident in January 1941.

Afterwards, the Second United Front completely broke down and Chinese Communists leader Mao Zedong outlined the preliminary plan for the CCP&#x27;s eventual seizure of power from Chiang Kai-shek. Mao himself is quoted outlining the &quot;721&quot; policy, saying &quot;We are fighting 70 percent for self development, 20 percent for compromise, and 10 percent against Japan&quot;. Mao began his final push for consolidation of CCP power under his authority, and his teachings became the central tenets of the CCP doctrine that came to be formalized as Mao Zedong Thought. The Communists also began to focus most of their energy on building up their sphere of influence wherever opportunities were presented, mainly through rural mass organizations, administrative, land and tax reform measures favouring poor peasants; while the Nationalists attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence by military blockade of areas controlled by CCP and fighting the Japanese at the same time.

===Entrance of the Western Allies===


Japan had expected to extract economic benefits of its invasions of China and elsewhere, including in the form of fuel and raw material resources. As Japanese aggression continued, however, the United States responded with trade embargoes on various goods, including oil and petroleum (beginning December 1939) and scrap iron and munitions (beginning July 1940). The United States demanded that Japan withdraw from China and also refused to recognize Japan&#x27;s occupations of the Indochinese countries. In spring 1941, trade negotiations between the United States and Japan failed. In July 1941, the United States froze Japanese financial assets and obtained Dutch and British agreements to also cut those countries&#x27; oil exports to Japan. This in turn prompted the Japanese decision to attack Pearl Harbor.

Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States declared war against Japan, and within days China joined the Allies in formal declaration of war against Japan, Germany and Italy. As the Western Allies entered the war against Japan, the Sino-Japanese War would become part of a greater conflict, the Pacific theatre of World War II. Japan&#x27;s military action against the United States also restrained its capacity to conduct further offensive operations in China.

After the Lend-Lease Act was passed in 1941, American financial and military aid began to trickle in. Claire Lee Chennault commanded the 1st American Volunteer Group (nicknamed the Flying Tigers), with American pilots flying American warplanes which were painted with the Chinese flag to attack the Japanese. He headed both the volunteer group and the uniformed U.S. Army Air Forces units that replaced it in 1942. However, it was the Soviets that provided the greatest material help for China from 1937 into 1941, with fighter aircraft for the Nationalist Chinese Air Force and artillery and armour for the Chinese Army through the Sino-Soviet Treaty; Operation Zet also provided for a group of Soviet volunteer combat aviators to join the Chinese Air Force in the fight against the Japanese occupation from late 1937 through 1939. The United States embargoed Japan in 1941 depriving it of shipments of oil and various other resources necessary to continue the war in China. This pressure, which was intended to disparage a continuation of the war and bring Japan into negotiation, resulted in the Attack on Pearl Harbor and Japan&#x27;s drive south to procure from the resource-rich European colonies in Southeast Asia by force the resources which the United States had denied to them.

Almost immediately, Chinese troops achieved another decisive victory in the Battle of Changsha, which earned the Chinese government much prestige from the Western Allies. President Franklin D. Roosevelt referred to the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union and China as the world&#x27;s &quot;Four Policemen&quot;; his primary reason for elevating China to such a status was the belief that after the war it would serve as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.

Knowledge of Japanese naval movements in the Pacific was provided to the American Navy by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization (SACO) which was run by the Chinese intelligence head Dai Li. Philippine and Japanese ocean weather was affected by weather originating near northern China. The base of SACO was located in Yangjiashan.

Chiang Kai-shek continued to receive supplies from the United States. However, in contrast to the Arctic supply route to the Soviet Union which stayed open through most of the war, sea routes to China and the Yunnan–Vietnam Railway had been closed since 1940. Therefore, between the closing of the Burma Road in 1942 and its re-opening as the Ledo Road in 1945, foreign aid was largely limited to what could be flown in over &quot;The Hump&quot;. In Burma, on 16 April 1942, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division. After the Doolittle Raid, the Imperial Japanese Army conducted a massive sweep through Zhejiang and Jiangxi, now known as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, with the goal of finding the surviving American airmen, applying retribution on the Chinese who aided them and destroying air bases. The operation started 15 May 1942, with 40 infantry battalions and 15–16 artillery battalions but was repelled by Chinese forces in September. During this campaign, the Imperial Japanese Army left behind a trail of devastation and also spread cholera, typhoid, plague and dysentery pathogens. Chinese estimates allege that as many as 250,000 civilians, the vast majority of whom were destitute Tanka boat people and other pariah ethnicities unable to flee, may have died of disease. It caused more than 16 million civilians to evacuate far away deep inward China. 90% of Ningbo&#x27;s population had already fled before battle started.

Most of China&#x27;s industry had already been captured or destroyed by Japan, and the Soviet Union refused to allow the United States to supply China through the Kazakhstan into Xinjiang as the Xinjiang warlord Sheng Shicai had turned anti-Soviet in 1942 with Chiang&#x27;s approval. For these reasons, the Chinese government never had the supplies and equipment needed to mount major counter-offensives. Despite the severe shortage of matériel, in 1943, the Chinese were successful in repelling major Japanese offensives in Hubei and Changde.

Chiang was named Allied commander-in-chief in the China theater in 1942. American general Joseph Stilwell served for a time as Chiang&#x27;s chief of staff, while simultaneously commanding American forces in the China-Burma-India Theater. For many reasons, relations between Stilwell and Chiang soon broke down. Many historians (such as Barbara W. Tuchman) have suggested it was largely due to the corruption and inefficiency of the Kuomintang government, while others (such as Ray Huang and Hans van de Ven) have depicted it as a more complicated situation. Stilwell had a strong desire to assume total control of Chinese troops and pursue an aggressive strategy, while Chiang preferred a patient and less expensive strategy of out-waiting the Japanese. Chiang continued to maintain a defensive posture despite Allied pleas to actively break the Japanese blockade, because China had already suffered tens of millions of war casualties and believed that Japan would eventually capitulate in the face of America&#x27;s overwhelming industrial output. For these reasons the other Allies gradually began to lose confidence in the Chinese ability to conduct offensive operations from the Asian mainland, and instead concentrated their efforts against the Japanese in the Pacific Ocean Areas and South West Pacific Area, employing an island hopping strategy.

Long-standing differences in national interest and political stance among China, the United States, and the United Kingdom remained in place. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was reluctant to devote British troops, many of whom had been routed by the Japanese in earlier campaigns, to the reopening of the Burma Road; Stilwell, on the other hand, believed that reopening the road was vital, as all China&#x27;s mainland ports were under Japanese control. The Allies&#x27; &quot;Europe first&quot; policy did not sit well with Chiang, while the later British insistence that China send more and more troops to Indochina for use in the Burma Campaign was seen by Chiang as an attempt to use Chinese manpower to defend British colonial possessions. Chiang also believed that China should divert its crack army divisions from Burma to eastern China to defend the airbases of the American bombers that he hoped would defeat Japan through bombing, a strategy that American general Claire Lee Chennault supported but which Stilwell strongly opposed. In addition, Chiang voiced his support of the Indian independence movement in a 1942 meeting with Mohandas Gandhi, which further soured the relationship between China and the United Kingdom.

American and Canadian-born Chinese were recruited to act as covert operatives in Japanese-occupied China. Employing their racial background as a disguise, their mandate was to blend in with local citizens and wage a campaign of sabotage. Activities focused on destruction of Japanese transportation of supplies (signaling bomber destruction of railroads, bridges). Chinese forces advanced to northern Burma in late 1943, besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina, and captured Mount Song. The British and Commonwealth forces had their operation in Mission 204 which attempted to provide assistance to the Chinese Nationalist Army. The first phase in 1942 under command of SOE achieved very little, but lessons were learned and a second more successful phase, commenced in February 1943 under British Military command, was conducted before the Japanese Operation Ichi-Go offensive in 1944 compelled evacuation.

== 1944 and Operation Ichi-Go ==
In 1944, the Communists launched counteroffensives from the liberated areas against Japanese forces.

Japan&#x27;s 1944 Operation Ichi-Go was the largest military campaign of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The campaign mobilized 500,000 Japanese troops, 100,000 horses, 1,500 artillery pieces, and 800 tanks. The 750,000 casualty figure for Nationalist Chinese forces are not all dead and captured, Cox included in the 750,000 casualties that China incurred in Ichigo soldiers who simply &quot;melted away&quot; and others who were rendered combat ineffective besides killed and captured soldiers.

In late November 1944, the Japanese advance slowed approximately 300 miles from Chongqing as it experienced shortages of trained soldiers and materiel. Although Operation Ichi-Go achieved its goals of seizing United States air bases and establishing a potential railway corridor from Manchukuo to Hanoi, it did so too late to impact the result of the broader war. American bombers in Chengdu were moved to the Mariana Islands where, along with bombers from bases in Saipan and Tinian, they could still bomb the Japanese home islands.

After Operation Ichigo, Chiang Kai-shek started a plan to withdraw Chinese troops from the Burma theatre against Japan in Southeast Asia for a counter offensive called &quot;White Tower&quot; and &quot;Iceman&quot; against Japanese soldiers in China in 1945.

The poor performance of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s forces in opposing the Japanese advance during Operation Ichigo became widely viewed as demonstrating Chiang&#x27;s incompetence. It irreparably damaged the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s view of Chiang and the KMT. The campaign further weakened the Nationalist economy and government revenues. Because of the Nationalists&#x27; increasing inability to fund the military, Nationalist authorities overlooked military corruption and smuggling. The Nationalist army increasingly turned to raiding villages to press-gang peasants into service and force marching them to assigned units. Approximately 10% of these peasants died before reaching their units.

By the end of 1944, Chinese troops under the command of Sun Li-jen attacking from India, and those under Wei Lihuang attacking from Yunnan, joined forces in Mong-Yu, successfully driving the Japanese out of North Burma and securing the Ledo Road, China&#x27;s vital supply artery. In Spring 1945 the Chinese launched offensives that retook Hunan and Guangxi. With the Chinese army progressing well in training and equipment, Wedemeyer planned to launch Operation Carbonado in summer 1945 to retake Guangdong, thus obtaining a coastal port, and from there drive northwards toward Shanghai. However, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Soviet invasion of Manchuria hastened Japanese surrender and these plans were not put into action.

==Chinese industrial base and the CIC==
==Foreign aid==
Before the start of full-scale warfare of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Germany had since the time of the Weimar Republic, provided much equipment and training to crack units of the National Revolutionary Army of China, including some aerial-combat training with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to some pilots of the pre-Nationalist Air Force of China. A number of foreign powers, including the Americans, Italians and Japanese, provided training and equipment to different air force units of pre-war China. With the outbreak of full-scale war between China and the Empire of Japan, the Soviet Union became the primary supporter for China&#x27;s &quot;war of resistance&quot; through the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact from 1937 to 1941. When the Imperial Japanese invaded French Indochina, the United States enacted the oil and steel embargo against Japan and froze all Japanese assets in 1941, and with it came the Lend-Lease Act of which China became a beneficiary on 6 May 1941; from there, China&#x27;s main diplomatic, financial and military supporter came from the U.S., particularly following the attack on Pearl Harbor&quot;.&quot;

===Overseas Chinese===
Over 3,200 overseas Chinese drivers and motor vehicle mechanics embarked to wartime China to support military and logistics supply lines, especially through Indo-China, which became of absolute tantamount importance when the Japanese cut-off all ocean-access to China&#x27;s interior with the capture of Nanning after the Battle of South Guangxi. Overseas Chinese communities in the U.S. raised money and nurtured talent in response to Imperial Japan&#x27;s aggressions in China, which helped to fund an entire squadron of Boeing P-26 fighter planes purchased for the looming war situation between China and the Empire of Japan; over a dozen Chinese-American aviators, including John &quot;Buffalo&quot; Huang, Arthur Chin, Hazel Ying Lee, Chan Kee-Wong et al., formed the original contingent of foreign volunteer aviators to join the Chinese air forces (some provincial or warlord air forces, but ultimately all integrating into the centralized Chinese Air Force; often called the &quot;Nationalist Air Force of China&quot;) in the &quot;patriotic call to duty for the motherland&quot; to fight against the Imperial Japanese invasion. Several of the original Chinese-American volunteer pilots were sent to Lagerlechfeld Air Base in Germany for aerial-gunnery training by the Chinese Air Force in 1936.

===German===

Prior to the war, Germany and China were in close economic and military cooperation, with Germany helping China modernize its industry and military in exchange for raw materials. Germany sent military advisers such as Alexander von Falkenhausen to China to help the KMT government reform its armed forces. Some divisions began training to German standards and were to form a relatively small but well trained Chinese Central Army. By the mid-1930s about 80,000 soldiers had received German-style training. After the KMT lost Nanjing and retreated to Wuhan, Hitler&#x27;s government decided to withdraw its support of China in 1938 in favour of an alliance with Japan as its main anti-Communist partner in East Asia.

===Soviet===
After Germany and Japan signed the anti-communist Anti-Comintern Pact, the Soviet Union hoped to keep China fighting, in order to deter a Japanese invasion of Siberia and save itself from a two-front war. In September 1937, they signed the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and approved Operation Zet, the formation of a secret Soviet volunteer air force, in which Soviet technicians upgraded and ran some of China&#x27;s transportation systems. Bombers, fighters, supplies and advisors arrived, headed by Aleksandr Cherepanov. Prior to the Western Allies, the Soviets provided the most foreign aid to China: some $250 million in credits for munitions and other supplies. The Soviet Union defeated Japan in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in May – September 1939, leaving the Japanese reluctant to fight the Soviets again. In April 1941, Soviet aid to China ended with the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact and the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. This pact enabled the Soviet Union to avoid fighting against Germany and Japan at the same time. In August 1945, the Soviet Union annulled the neutrality pact with Japan and invaded Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, the Kuril Islands, and northern Korea. The Soviets also continued to support the Chinese Communist Party. In total, 3,665 Soviet advisors and pilots served in China, and 227 of them died fighting there.

The Soviet Union provided financial aid to both the Communists and the Nationalists.

=== United States ===

The United States generally avoided taking sides between Japan and China until 1940, providing virtually no aid to China in this period. For instance, the 1934 Silver Purchase Act signed by President Roosevelt caused chaos in China&#x27;s economy which helped the Japanese war effort. The 1933 Wheat and Cotton Loan mainly benefited American producers, while aiding to a smaller extent both Chinese and Japanese alike. This policy was due to US fear of breaking off profitable trade ties with Japan, in addition to US officials and businesses perception of China as a potential source of massive profit for the US by absorbing surplus American products, as William Appleman Williams states.

From December 1937, events such as the Japanese attack on USS &quot;Panay&quot; and the Nanjing Massacre swung public opinion in the West sharply against Japan and increased their fear of Japanese expansion, which prompted the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to provide loan assistance for war supply contracts to China. Australia also prevented a Japanese government-owned company from taking over an iron mine in Australia, and banned iron ore exports in 1938. However, in July 1939, negotiations between Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Khatira and the British Ambassador in Tokyo, Robert Craigie, led to an agreement by which the United Kingdom recognized Japanese conquests in China. At the same time, the US government extended a trade agreement with Japan for six months, then fully restored it. Under the agreement, Japan purchased trucks for the Kwantung Army, machine tools for aircraft factories, strategic materials (steel and scrap iron up to 16 October 1940, petrol and petroleum products up to 26 June 1941), and various other much-needed supplies.

In a hearing before the United States Congress House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs on Wednesday, 19 April 1939, the acting chairman Sol Bloom and other Congressmen interviewed Maxwell S. Stewart, a former Foreign Policy Association research staff and economist who charged that America&#x27;s Neutrality Act and its &quot;neutrality policy&quot; was a massive farce which only benefited Japan and that Japan did not have the capability nor could ever have invaded China without the massive amount of raw material America exported to Japan. America exported far more raw material to Japan than to China in the years 1937–1940. According to the United States Congress, the U.S.&#x27;s third largest export destination was Japan until 1940 when France overtook it due to France being at war too. Japan&#x27;s military machine acquired war materials, automotive equipment, steel, scrap iron, copper, oil, that it wanted from the United States in 1937–1940 and was allowed to purchase aerial bombs, aircraft equipment, and aircraft from America up to the summer of 1938. A 1934 U.S. State Department memo even noted how Japan&#x27;s business dealings with Standard Oil of New Jersey company, under the leadership of Walter Teagle, made United States oil the &quot;major portion of the petroleum and petroleum products now imported into Japan.&quot; War essentials exports from the United States to Japan increased by 124% along with a general increase of 41% of all American exports from 1936 to 1937 when Japan invaded China. Japan&#x27;s war economy was fueled by exports to the United States at over twice the rate immediately preceding the war. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Japan corresponded to the following share of American exports.

Japan invaded and occupied the northern part of French Indochina in September 1940 to prevent China from receiving the 10,000 tons of materials delivered monthly by the Allies via the Haiphong–Yunnan Fou Railway line.

On 22 June 1941, Germany attacked the Soviet Union. In spite of non-aggression pacts or trade connections, Hitler&#x27;s assault threw the world into a frenzy of re-aligning political outlooks and strategic prospects.

On 21 July, Japan occupied the southern part of French Indochina (southern Vietnam and Cambodia), contravening a 1940 gentlemen&#x27;s agreement not to move into southern French Indochina. From bases in Cambodia and southern Vietnam, Japanese planes could attack Malaya, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies. As the Japanese occupation of northern French Indochina in 1940 had already cut off supplies from the West to China, the move into southern French Indochina was viewed as a direct threat to British and Dutch colonies. Many principal figures in the Japanese government and military (particularly the navy) were against the move, as they foresaw that it would invite retaliation from the West.
On 24 July 1941, Roosevelt requested Japan withdraw all its forces from Indochina. Two days later the US and the UK began an oil embargo; two days after that the Netherlands joined them. This was a decisive moment in the Second Sino-Japanese War. The loss of oil imports made it impossible for Japan to continue operations in China on a long-term basis. It set the stage for Japan to launch a series of military attacks against the Allies, including the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.

In mid-1941, the United States government financed the creation of the American Volunteer Groups (AVG), of which one the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; reached China, to replace the withdrawn Soviet volunteers and aircraft. The Flying Tigers did not enter actual combat until after the United States had declared war on Japan. Led by Chennault, their early combat success of 300 kills against a loss of 12 of their newly introduced Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighters heavily armed with six 0.50-inch caliber machine guns and very fast diving speeds earned them wide recognition at a time when the Chinese Air Force and Allies in the Pacific and SE Asia were suffering heavy losses, and soon afterwards their &quot;boom and zoom&quot; high-speed hit-and-run air combat tactics would be adopted by the United States Army Air Forces.

Disagreements existed both between the United States and the Nationalists, and within the United States military, about the form of aid. Chennault contended that aid should be in the form of building on the success of the Flying Tigers and go to the US Fourteenth Air Force in China. Lieutenant General Joseph Stilwell, who was in charge of training Nationalist divisions equipped by the United States, became increasingly frustrated by the Nationalists&#x27; refusal to use them to fight the Japanese in Burma or in southeastern China. 

The Sino-American Cooperative Organization was an organization created by the SACO Treaty signed by the Republic of China and the United States of America in 1942 that established a mutual intelligence gathering entity in China between the respective nations against Japan. It operated in China jointly along with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), America&#x27;s first intelligence agency and forerunner of the CIA while also serving as joint training program between the two nations. Among all the wartime missions that Americans set up in China, SACO was the only one that adopted a policy of &quot;total immersion&quot; with the Chinese. The &quot;Rice Paddy Navy&quot; or &quot;What-the-Hell Gang&quot; operated in the China-Burma-India theater, advising and training, forecasting weather and scouting landing areas for USN fleet and Gen Claire Chennault&#x27;s 14th AF, rescuing downed American flyers, and intercepting Japanese radio traffic. An underlying mission objective during the last year of war was the development and preparation of the China coast for Allied penetration and occupation. Fujian was scouted as a potential staging area and springboard for the future military landing of the Allies of World War II in Japan.

=== United Kingdom ===

After the Tanggu Truce of 1933, Chiang Kai-Shek and the British government would have more friendly relations but were uneasy due to British foreign concessions there. During the Second Sino-Japanese War the British government would initially have an impartial viewpoint toward the conflict urging both to reach an agreement and prevent war. British public opinion would swing in favor of the Chinese after Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen&#x27;s car which had Union Jacks on it was attacked by Japanese aircraft with Hugessen being temporarily paralyzed with outrage against the attack from the public and government. The British public were largely supportive of the Chinese and many relief efforts were untaken to help China. Britain at this time was beginning the process of rearmament and the sale of military surplus was banned but there was never an embargo on private companies shipping arms. A number of unassembled Gloster Gladiator fighters were imported to China via Hong Kong for the Chinese Air Force. Between July 1937 and November 1938 on average 60,000 tons of munitions were shipped from Britain to China via Hong Kong. Attempts by the United Kingdom and the United States to do a joint intervention were unsuccessful as both countries had rocky relations in the interwar era.

In February 1941 a Sino-British agreement was forged whereby British troops would assist the Chinese &quot;Surprise Troops&quot; units of guerrillas already operating in China, and China would assist Britain in Burma.
When Hong Kong was overrun in December 1941, the British Army Aid Group (B.A.A.G.) was set up and headquartered in Guilin, Guangxi. It&#x27;s aim was to assist prisoners of war and internees to escape from Japanese camps. This led to the formation of the Hong Kong Volunteer Company which later fought in Burma. B.A.A.G. also sent agents to gather intelligence – military, political and economic in Southern China, as well as giving medical and humanitarian assistance to Chinese civilians and military personnel.

A British-Australian commando operation, Mission 204 (&quot;Tulip Force&quot;), was initialized to provide training to Chinese guerrilla troops. The mission conducted two operations, mostly in the provinces of Yunnan and Jiangxi.

The first operation commenced in February 1942 from Burma on a long journey to the Chinese front. Due to issues with supporting the Chinese and gradual disease and supply issues, the first phase achieved very little and the unit was withdrawn in September.

Another phase was set up with lessons learned from the first. Commencing in February 1943 this time valid assistance was given to the Chinese &#x27;Surprise Troops&#x27; in various actions against the Japanese. These involved ambushes, attacks on airfields, blockhouses, and supply depots. The unit operated successfully before withdrawal in November 1944.

Commandos and members of SOE who had formed Force 136, worked with the Free Thai Movement who also operated in China, mostly while on their way into Thailand.

After the Japanese blocked the Burma Road in April 1942, and before the Ledo Road was finished in early 1945, the majority of US and British supplies to the Chinese had to be delivered via airlift over the eastern end of the Himalayan Mountains known as &quot;The Hump&quot;. Flying over the Himalayas was extremely dangerous, but the airlift continued daily to August 1945, at great cost in men and aircraft.

==French Indochina==

The Chinese Kuomintang also supported the Vietnamese Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (VNQDD) in its battle against French and Japanese imperialism. In Guangxi, Chinese military leaders were organizing Vietnamese nationalists against the Japanese. The VNQDD had been active in Guangxi and some of their members had joined the KMT army. Under the umbrella of KMT activities, a broad alliance of nationalists emerged. With Ho at the forefront, the Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi (Vietnamese Independence League, usually known as the Viet Minh) was formed and based in the town of Jingxi. The pro-VNQDD nationalist Ho Ngoc Lam, a KMT army officer and former disciple of Phan Bội Châu, was named as the deputy of Phạm Văn Đồng, later to be Ho&#x27;s Prime Minister. The front was later broadened and renamed the Viet Nam Giai Phong Dong Minh (Vietnam Liberation League).

The Viet Nam Revolutionary League was a union of various Vietnamese nationalist groups, run by the pro Chinese VNQDD. Chinese KMT General Zhang Fakui created the league to further Chinese influence in Indochina, against the French and Japanese. Its stated goal was for unity with China under the Three Principles of the People, created by KMT founder Dr. Sun and opposition to Japanese and French Imperialists. The Revolutionary League was controlled by Nguyen Hai Than, who was born in China and could not speak Vietnamese. General Zhang shrewdly blocked the Communists of Vietnam, and Ho Chi Minh from entering the league, as Zhang&#x27;s main goal was Chinese influence in Indochina. The KMT utilized these Vietnamese nationalists during World War II against Japanese forces. Franklin D. Roosevelt, through General Stilwell, privately made it clear that they preferred that the French not reacquire French Indochina (modern day Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos) after the war was over. Roosevelt offered Chiang Kai-shek control of all of Indochina. It was said that Chiang Kai-shek replied: &quot;Under no circumstances!&quot;

After the war, 200,000 Chinese troops under General Lu Han were sent by Chiang Kai-shek to northern Indochina (north of the 16th parallel) to accept the surrender of Japanese occupying forces there, and remained in Indochina until 1946, when the French returned. The Chinese used the VNQDD, the Vietnamese branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, to increase their influence in French Indochina and to put pressure on their opponents. Chiang Kai-shek threatened the French with war in response to maneuvering by the French and Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s forces against each other, forcing them to come to a peace agreement. In February 1946, he also forced the French to surrender all of their concessions in China and to renounce their extraterritorial privileges in exchange for the Chinese withdrawing from northern Indochina and allowing French troops to reoccupy the region. Following France&#x27;s agreement to these demands, the withdrawal of Chinese troops began in March 1946.

==Central Asian rebellions==
In 1937, then pro-Soviet General Sheng Shicai invaded Dunganistan accompanied by Soviet troops to defeat General Ma Hushan of the KMT 36th Division. General Ma expected help from Nanjing, but did not receive it. The Nationalist government was forced to deny these maneuvers as &quot;Japanese propaganda&quot;, as it needed continued military supplies from the Soviets.

As the war went on, Nationalist General Ma Buqing was in virtual control of the Gansu corridor. Ma had earlier fought against the Japanese, but because the Soviet threat was great, Chiang in July 1942 directed him to move 30,000 of his troops to the Tsaidam marsh in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai. Chiang further named Ma as Reclamation Commissioner, to threaten Sheng&#x27;s southern flank in Xinjiang, which bordered Tsaidam.

The Ili Rebellion broke out in Xinjiang when the Kuomintang Hui Officer Liu Bin-Di was killed while fighting Turkic Uyghur rebels in November 1944. The Soviet Union supported the Turkic rebels against the Kuomintang, and Kuomintang forces fought back.

==Ethnic minorities==


Japan attempted to reach out to Chinese ethnic minorities in order to rally them to their side against the Han Chinese, but only succeeded with certain Manchu, Mongol, Uyghur, and Tibetan elements.

The Japanese attempt to get the Muslim Hui people on their side failed, as many Chinese generals such as Bai Chongxi, Ma Hongbin, Ma Hongkui, and Ma Bufang were Hui. The Japanese attempted to approach Ma Bufang but were unsuccessful in making any agreement with him. Ma Bufang ended up supporting the anti-Japanese Imam Hu Songshan, who prayed for the destruction of the Japanese. Ma became chairman (governor) of Qinghai in 1938 and commanded a group army. He was appointed because of his anti-Japanese inclinations, and was such an obstruction to Japanese agents trying to contact the Tibetans that he was called an &quot;adversary&quot; by a Japanese agent.

===Hui Muslims===
Hui cemeteries were destroyed for military reasons. Many Hui fought in the war against the Japanese such as Bai Chongxi, Ma Hongbin, Ma Hongkui, Ma Bufang, Ma Zhanshan, Ma Biao, Ma Zhongying, Ma Buqing and Ma Hushan. Qinghai Tibetans served in the Qinghai army against the Japanese. The Qinghai Tibetans view the Tibetans of Central Tibet (Tibet proper, ruled by the Dalai Lamas from Lhasa) as distinct and different from themselves, and even take pride in the fact that they were not ruled by Lhasa ever since the collapse of the Tibetan Empire.

Xining was subjected to aerial bombardment by Japanese warplanes in 1941, causing all ethnicities in Qinghai to unite against the Japanese. General Han Youwen directed the defense of the city of Xining during air raids by Japanese planes. Han survived an aerial bombardment by Japanese planes in Xining while he was being directed via telephone by Ma Bufang, who hid in an air-raid shelter in a military barracks. The bombing resulted in Han being buried in rubble, though he was later rescued.

John Scott reported in 1934 that there was both strong anti-Japanese feeling and anti-Bolshevik among the Muslims of Gansu and he mentioned the Muslim generals Ma Fuxiang, Ma Qi, Ma Anliang and Ma Bufang who was chairman of Qinghai province when he stayed in Xining.

==Conclusion and aftermath==

===End of the Pacific War and the surrender of Japanese troops in China===
During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese had consistent tactical successes but failed to achieve strategic results. Although it seized the majority of China&#x27;s industrial capacity, occupied most major cities, and rarely lost a battle, Japan&#x27;s occupation of China was costly. Japan had approximately 50,000 military fatalities each year and 200,000 wounded per year.

In less than two weeks the Kwantung Army, which was the primary Japanese fighting force, consisting of over a million men but lacking in adequate armour, artillery, or air support, had been destroyed by the Soviets. Japanese Emperor Hirohito officially capitulated to the Allies on 15 August 1945. The official surrender was signed aboard the battleship on 2 September 1945, in a ceremony where several Allied commanders including Chinese general Hsu Yung-chang were present.

After the Allied victory in the Pacific, General Douglas MacArthur ordered all Japanese forces within China (excluding Manchuria), Taiwan and French Indochina north of 16° north latitude to surrender to Chiang Kai-shek, and the Japanese troops in China formally surrendered on 9 September 1945, at 9:00. The ninth hour of the ninth day of the ninth month was chosen in echo of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 (on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month) and because &quot;nine&quot; is a homophone of the word for &quot;long lasting&quot; in Chinese (to suggest that the peace won would last forever).

Chiang relied on American help in transporting Nationalist troops to regain control of formerly Japanese-occupied areas. Non-Chinese generally viewed the behavior of these troops as undercutting Nationalist legitimacy, and these troops engaged in corruption and looting, leading to widespread views of a &quot;botched liberation&quot;.

The Nationalist government seized Japanese-held businesses at the time of the Japanese surrender. The Nationalist government made little effort to return these businesses to their original Chinese owners. A mechanism existed through which Chinese and foreign owners could petition for the return of their former property. In practice, the Nationalist government and its officials retained a great deal of the seized property and embezzling property, particularly from warehouses, was common. Nationalist officials sometimes extorted money from individuals in liberated territories under threat of labeling them as Japanese collaborators.

Chiang&#x27;s focus on his communist opponents prompted him to leave Japanese troops or troops of the Japanese puppet regimes to remain on duty in occupied areas so as to avoid their surrender to Communist forces.

===Post-war struggle and resumption of the civil war===

In 1945, China emerged from the war nominally a great military power but economically weak and on the verge of all-out civil war. The economy was sapped by the military demands of a long costly war and internal strife, by spiraling inflation, and by corruption in the Nationalist government that included profiteering, speculation and hoarding.

The poor performance of Nationalist forces opposing the Ichi-go campaign was largely viewed as reflecting poorly on Chiang&#x27;s competence. Chiang blamed the failure on the United States, particularly Stilwell, who had used Chinese forces in the Burma Campaign and in Chiang&#x27;s view, left China insufficiently defended.

As part of the Yalta Conference, which allowed a Soviet sphere of influence in Manchuria, the Soviets dismantled and removed more than half of the industrial equipment left there by the Japanese before handing over Manchuria to China. Large swathes of the prime farming areas had been ravaged by the fighting and there was starvation and famine in the wake of the war. Many towns and cities were destroyed, and millions were rendered homeless by floods.

The problems of rehabilitation and reconstruction after the ravages of a protracted war were staggering, and the war left the Nationalists severely weakened, and their policies left them unpopular. Meanwhile, the war strengthened the Communists both in popularity and as a viable fighting force. At Yan&#x27;an and elsewhere in the communist controlled areas, Mao Zedong was able to adapt Marxism–Leninism to Chinese conditions. He taught party cadres to lead the masses by living and working with them, eating their food, and thinking their thoughts.

In Japanese-occupied areas, the Communists had established military and political bases from which it carried out guerilla warfare. The Communists built popular support in these areas, returning land to poor peasants, reducing peasant&#x27;s rent, and arming the people. By Spring 1945, there were 19 Communist-governed areas in China in which 95 million people lived. In Fall 1945, the Communist armies had 1.27 million men and were supported by 2.68 million militia members.

Mao also began to execute his plan to establish a new China by rapidly moving his forces from Yan&#x27;an and elsewhere to Manchuria. This opportunity was available to the Communists because although Nationalist representatives were not invited to Yalta, they had been consulted and had agreed to the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in the belief that the Soviet Union would cooperate only with the Nationalist government after the war.

However, the Soviet occupation of Manchuria was long enough to allow the Communist forces to move in en masse and arm themselves with the military hardware surrendered by the Imperial Japanese Army, quickly establish control in the countryside and move into position to encircle the Nationalist government army in major cities of northeast China. Following that, the Chinese Civil War broke out between the Nationalists and Communists, which concluded with the Communist victory in mainland China and the retreat of the Nationalists to Taiwan in 1949.

===Aftermath===
The Nationalists suffered higher casualties because they were the main combatants opposing the Japanese in each of the 22 major battles (involving more than 100,000 troops on both sides) between China and Japan. The Communist forces, by contrast, usually avoided pitched battles with the Japanese, in which their guerrilla tactics were less effective, and generally limited their combat to guerrilla actions (the Hundred Regiments Offensive and the Battle of Pingxingguan are notable exceptions). The Nationalists committed their strongest divisions in early battle against the Japanese (including the 36th, 87th, 88th divisions, the crack divisions of Chiang&#x27;s Central Army) to defend Shanghai and continued to deploy most of their forces to fight the Japanese even as the Communists changed their strategy to engage mainly in a political offensive against the Japanese while declaring that the CCP should &quot;save and preserve our strength and wait for favourable timing&quot; by the end of 1941.

==Legacy==

===China-Japan relations===
Today, the war is a major point of contention and resentment between China and Japan. The war remains a major roadblock for Sino-Japanese relations. Issues regarding the current historical outlook on the war exist. For example, the Japanese government has been accused of historical revisionism by allowing the approval of a few school textbooks omitting or glossing over Japan&#x27;s militant past, although the most recent controversial book, the &quot;New History Textbook&quot; was used by only 0.039% of junior high schools in Japan and despite the efforts of the Japanese nationalist textbook reformers, by the late 1990s the most common Japanese schoolbooks contained references to, for instance, the Nanjing Massacre, Unit 731, and the comfort women of World War II, all historical issues which have faced challenges from ultranationalists in the past.

In 2005, a history textbook prepared by the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform which had been approved by the government in 2001, sparked huge outcry and protests in China and Korea. It referred to the Nanjing Massacre and other atrocities such as the Manila massacre as an &quot;incident&quot;, glossed over the issue of comfort women, and made only brief references to the death of Chinese soldiers and civilians in Nanjing. A copy of the 2005 version of a junior high school textbook titled &quot;New History Textbook&quot; found that there is no mention of the &quot;Nanjing Massacre&quot; or the &quot;Nanjing Incident&quot;. Indeed, the only one sentence that referred to this event was: &quot;they [the Japanese troops] occupied that city in December&quot;.

===Taiwan===

Taiwan and the Penghu islands were put under the administrative control of the Republic of China (ROC) government in 1945 by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The ROC proclaimed Taiwan Retrocession Day on 25 October 1945. However, due to the unresolved Chinese Civil War, neither the newly established People&#x27;s Republic of China in mainland China nor the Nationalist ROC that retreated to Taiwan was invited to sign the Treaty of San Francisco, as neither had shown full and complete legal capacity to enter into an international legally binding agreement. Since China was not present, the Japanese only formally renounced the territorial sovereignty of Taiwan and Penghu islands without specifying to which country Japan relinquished the sovereignty, and the treaty was signed in 1951 and came into force in 1952.

In 1952, the Treaty of Taipei was signed separately between the ROC and Japan that basically followed the same guideline of the Treaty of San Francisco, not specifying which country has sovereignty over Taiwan. However, Article 10 of the treaty states that the Taiwanese people and the juridical person should be the people and the juridical person of the ROC. Both the PRC and ROC governments base their claims to Taiwan on the Japanese Instrument of Surrender which specifically accepted the Potsdam Declaration which refers to the Cairo Declaration. Disputes over the precise de jure sovereign of Taiwan persist to the present. On a de facto basis, sovereignty over Taiwan has been and continues to be exercised by the ROC. Japan&#x27;s position has been to avoid commenting on Taiwan&#x27;s status, maintaining that Japan renounced all claims to sovereignty over its former colonial possessions after World War II, including Taiwan.

Traditionally, the Republic of China government has held celebrations marking the Victory Day on 9 September (now known as Armed Forces Day) and Taiwan&#x27;s Retrocession Day on 25 October. However, after the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidential election in 2000, these national holidays commemorating the war have been cancelled as the pro-independent DPP does not see the relevancy of celebrating events that happened in mainland China.

Meanwhile, many KMT supporters, particularly veterans who retreated with the government in 1949, still have an emotional interest in the war. For example, in celebrating the 60th anniversary of the end of war in 2005, the cultural bureau of KMT stronghold Taipei held a series of talks in the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall regarding the war and post-war developments, while the KMT held its own exhibit in the KMT headquarters. Whereas the KMT won the presidential election in 2008, the ROC government resumed commemorating the war.

===Japanese women left in China===
Several thousand Japanese who were sent as colonizers to Manchukuo and Inner Mongolia were left behind in China. The majority of these were women, and they married mostly Chinese men and became known as &quot;stranded war wives&quot; (zanryu fujin).

===Korean women left in China===
In China some Korean comfort women stayed behind instead of going back to their native land. Most Korean comfort women who were left behind in China married Chinese men.

===Commemorations===
Three major museums in China commemorate China&#x27;s War of Resistance, including the Museum of the War of Chinese People&#x27;s Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.

==Casualties==
The conflict lasted eight years, two months and two days (from 7 July 1937, to 9 September 1945). The total number of casualties that resulted from this war (and subsequently theater) equaled more than half the total number of casualties that later resulted from the entire Pacific War.

===Chinese===
* Duncan Anderson, Head of the Department of War Studies at the Royal Military Academy, UK, writing for BBC states that the total number of casualties was around 20 million.
* The official PRC statistics for China&#x27;s civilian and military casualties in the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1937 to 1945 are 20 million dead and 15 million wounded. The figures for total military casualties, killed and wounded are: NRA 3.2 million; People&#x27;s Liberation Army 500,000.
* The official account of the war published in Taiwan reported that the Nationalist Chinese Army lost 3,238,000 men (1,797,000 wounded, 1,320,000 killed, and 120,000 missing) and 5,787,352 civilians casualties putting the total number of casualties at 9,025,352. The Nationalists fought in 22 major engagements, most of which involved more than 100,000 troops on both sides, 1,171 minor engagements most of which involved more than 50,000 troops on both sides, and 38,931 skirmishes. The Chinese reported their yearly total battle casualties as 367,362 for 1937, 735,017 for 1938, 346,543 for 1939, and 299,483 for 1941. Additionally, the Ministry of Military Affairs recorded a total of 10,322,934 losses from illnesses, reorganizations, and desertions.
* The postwar investigation of Chinese losses by the Nationalist Government recorded a total of 3,407,931 military combat casualties (1,371,374 killed, 1,738,324 wounded, and 298,233 missing) and 422,479 military deaths from illnesses. Additionally, there were 2,313 casualties (1,042 killed and 1,271 wounded) from the Air Defense Service and 9,134,569 civilian casualties (4,397,504 dead and 4,737,065 wounded). Yearly casualties for the army are 881,349 in 1937, 517,121 in 1938, 413,853 in 1939, 153,983 in 1940, 258,530 in 1941, 126,557 in 1942, 67,903 in 1943, 322,625 in 1944, and 649,503 in 1945.
* The Ministry of Military Affairs recorded the losses of wounded and sick soldiers in hospital directly administrated by the Nationalist Government at 443,398 losses for wounded soldiers (45,710 dead, 123,017 crippled, and 274,671 deserted) and 937,559 losses for sick soldiers (422,479 dead, 191,644 crippled, and 323,436 deserted), for a total of 1,380,957 losses (468,189 dead, 314,661 crippled, and 598,107 deserted).
* An academic study published in the United States in 1959 estimates military casualties: 1.5 million killed in battle, 750,000 missing in action, 1.5 million deaths due to disease and 3 million wounded; civilian casualties: due to military activity, killed 1,073,496 and 237,319 wounded; 335,934 killed and 426,249 wounded in Japanese air attacks. This estimate is based on the National Central Research Institute&#x27;s study of China&#x27;s losses in six years from 7 July 1937 until 6 July 1943.
* According to historian Mitsuyoshi Himeta, at least 2.7 million civilians died during the &quot;kill all, loot all, burn all&quot; operation (Three Alls Policy, or &quot;sanko sakusen&quot;) implemented in May 1942 in north China by general Yasuji Okamura and authorized on 3 December 1941, by Imperial Headquarter Order number 575.
* The property loss suffered by the Chinese was valued at 383 billion US dollars according to the currency exchange rate in July 1937, roughly 50 times the gross domestic product of Japan at that time (US$7.7 billion).
* In addition, the war created 95 million refugees.
* Rudolph Rummel gave a figure of 3,949,000 people in China murdered directly by the Japanese army while giving a figure of 10,216,000 total dead in the war with the additional millions of deaths due to indirect causes like starvation, disease and disruption but not direct killing by Japan. China suffered from famines during the war caused by drought affected both China and India, Chinese famine of 1942–43 in Henan that led to starvation deaths of 2 to 3 million people, Guangdong famine caused more than 3 million people to flee or die, and the 1943–1945 Indian famine in Bengal that killed about 3 million Indians in Bengal and parts of Southern India.

===Japanese===
The Japanese recorded around 1.1 to 1.9 million military casualties during all of World War II (which include killed, wounded and missing). The official death toll of Japanese men killed in China, according to the Japan Defense Ministry, is 480,000. Based on the investigation of the Japanese &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot;, the military death toll of Japan in China is about 700,000 since 1937 (excluding the deaths in Manchuria).

Another source from Hilary Conroy claims that a total of 447,000 Japanese soldiers died or went missing in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Of the 1,130,000 Imperial Japanese Army soldiers who died during World War II, 39 percent died in China.

Then in &quot;War Without Mercy&quot;, John W. Dower claims that a total of 396,000 Japanese soldiers died in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Of this number, the Imperial Japanese Army lost 388,605 soldiers and the Imperial Japanese Navy lost 8,000 soldiers. Another 54,000 soldiers also died after the war had ended, mostly from illness and starvation. Of the 1,740,955 Japanese soldiers who died during World War II, 22 percent died in China.

Japanese statistics, however, lack complete estimates for the wounded. From 1937 to 1941, 185,647 Japanese soldiers were killed in China and 520,000 were wounded. Disease also incurred critical losses on Japanese forces. From 1937 to 1941, 430,000 Japanese soldiers were recorded as being sick. In North China alone, 18,000 soldiers were evacuated back to Japan for illnesses in 1938, 23,000 in 1939, and 15,000 in 1940. From 1941 to 1945: 202,958 dead; another 54,000 dead after war&#x27;s end. Chinese forces also report that by May 1945, 22,293 Japanese soldiers were captured as prisoners. Many more Japanese soldiers surrendered when the war ended.

Contemporary studies from the Beijing Central Compilation and Translation Press state that the Japanese suffered a total of 2,227,200 casualties, including 1,055,000 dead and 1,172,341 injured. This Chinese publication analyzes statistics provided by Japanese publications and claimed these numbers were largely based on Japanese publications.

Both Nationalist and Communist Chinese sources report that their respective forces were responsible for the deaths of over 1.7 million Japanese soldiers. Nationalist War Minister He Yingqin himself contested the Communists&#x27; claims, finding it impossible for a force of &quot;untrained, undisciplined, poorly equipped&quot; guerrillas of Communist forces to have killed so many enemy soldiers.

The Nationalist Chinese authorities ridiculed Japanese estimates of Chinese casualties. In 1940, the National Herald stated that the Japanese exaggerated Chinese casualties, while deliberately concealing the true number of Japanese casualties, releasing false figures that made them appear much lower. The article reports on the casualty situation of the war up to 1940.

===Use of chemical and biological weapons===
Despite Article 23 of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, article V of the Treaty in Relation to the Use of Submarines and Noxious Gases in Warfare, article 171 of the Treaty of Versailles and a resolution adopted by the League of Nations on 14 May 1938, condemning the use of poison gas by the Empire of Japan, the Imperial Japanese Army frequently used chemical weapons during the war.

According to Walter E. Grunden, history professor at Bowling Green State University, Japan permitted the use of chemical weapons in China because the Japanese concluded that Chinese forces did not possess the capacity to retaliate in kind. The Japanese incorporated gas warfare into many aspects of their army, which includes special gas troops, infantry, artillery, engineers and air force; the Japanese were aware of basic gas tactics of other armies, and deployed multifarious gas warfare tactics in China. The Japanese were very dependent on gas weapons when they were engaged in chemical warfare.

Japan used poison gas at Hankow during the Battle of Wuhan to break fierce Chinese resistance after conventional Japanese assaults were repelled by Chinese defenders. Rana Mitter writes, 

According to Freda Utley, during the battle at Hankow, in areas where Japanese artillery or gunboats on the river could not reach Chinese defenders on hilltops, Japanese infantrymen had to fight Chinese troops on the hills. She noted that the Japanese were inferior at hand-to-hand combat against the Chinese, and resorted to deploying poison gas to defeat the Chinese troops. She was told by General Li Zongren that the Japanese consistently used tear gas and mustard gas against Chinese troops. Li also added that his forces could not withstand large scale deployments of Japanese poison gas. Since Chinese troops did not have gas-masks, the poison gases provided enough time for Japanese troops to bayonet debilitated Chinese soldiers.

During the battle in Yichang of October 1941, Japanese troops used chemical munitions in their artillery and mortar fire, and warplanes dropped gas bombs all over the area; since the Chinese troops were poorly equipped and without gas-masks, they were severely gassed, burned and killed.

According to historians Yoshiaki Yoshimi and Seiya Matsuno, the chemical weapons were authorized by specific orders given by Hirohito himself, transmitted by the Imperial General Headquarters. For example, the Emperor authorized the use of toxic gas on 375 separate occasions during the Battle of Wuhan from August to October 1938. They were also used during the invasion of Changde. Those orders were transmitted either by Prince Kan&#x27;in Kotohito or General Hajime Sugiyama. Gases manufactured in Okunoshima were used more than 2,000 times against Chinese soldiers and civilians in the war in China in the 1930s and 1940s

Bacteriological weapons provided by Shirō Ishii&#x27;s units were also profusely used. For example, in 1940, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force bombed Ningbo with fleas carrying the bubonic plague. During the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials the accused, such as Major General Kiyashi Kawashima, testified that, in 1941, some 40 members of Unit 731 air-dropped plague-contaminated fleas on Changde. These attacks caused epidemic plague outbreaks. In the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, of the 10,000 Japanese soldiers who fell ill with the disease, about 1,700 Japanese troops died when the biological weapons rebounded on their own forces.

Japan gave its own soldiers methamphetamines in the form of Philopon.

===Use of suicide attacks===
Chinese armies deployed &quot;dare to die corps&quot; () or &quot;suicide squads&quot; against the Japanese.

Suicide bombing was also used against the Japanese. A Chinese soldier detonated a grenade vest and killed 20 Japanese at Sihang Warehouse. Chinese troops strapped explosives, such as grenade packs or dynamite to their bodies and threw themselves under Japanese tanks to blow them up. This tactic was used during the Battle of Shanghai, where a Chinese suicide bomber stopped a Japanese tank column by exploding himself beneath the lead tank, and at the Battle of Taierzhuang, where dynamite and grenades were strapped on by Chinese troops who rushed at Japanese tanks and blew themselves up. During one incident at Taierzhuang, Chinese suicide bombers destroyed four Japanese tanks with grenade bundles.
