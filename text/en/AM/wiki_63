<text>Ivan IV Vasilyevich (; 25 August 1530 – ), commonly known as Ivan the Terrible, was Grand Prince of Moscow and all Russia from 1533 to 1547, and the first Tsar and Grand Prince of all Russia from 1547 until his death in 1584. Ivan&#x27;s reign was characterised by Russia&#x27;s transformation from a medieval state to a fledgling empire, but at an immense cost to its people and long-term economy.

Ivan IV was the eldest son of Vasili III by his second wife Elena Glinskaya, and a grandson of Ivan III. He succeeded his father after his death, when he was three years old. A group of reformers united around the young Ivan, crowning him as tsar in 1547 at the age of 16. In the early years of his reign, Ivan ruled with the group of reformers known as the Chosen Council and established the &quot;Zemsky Sobor&quot;, a new assembly convened by the tsar. He also revised the legal code and introduced reforms, including elements of local self-government, as well as establishing the first Russian standing army, the &quot;streltsy&quot;. Ivan conquered the khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan, and significantly expanded the territory of Russia.

After he had consolidated his power, Ivan rid himself of the advisers from the Chosen Council and triggered the Livonian War of 1558 to 1583, which ravaged Russia and resulted in failure to take control over Livonia and the loss of Ingria, but allowed him to establish greater autocratic control over the Russian nobility, which he violently purged using Russia&#x27;s first political police, the &quot;oprichniki&quot;. The later years of Ivan&#x27;s reign were marked by the massacre of Novgorod by the &quot;oprichniki&quot; and the burning of Moscow by the Tatars. Ivan also pursued cultural improvements, such as importing the first printing press to Russia, and began several processes that would continue for centuries, including deepening connections with other European states, particularly England, fighting wars against the Ottoman Empire, and the conquest of Siberia.

Contemporary sources present disparate accounts of Ivan&#x27;s complex personality. He was described as intelligent and devout, but also prone to paranoia, rage, and episodic outbreaks of mental instability that worsened with age. Historians generally believe that in a fit of anger, he murdered his eldest son and heir, Ivan Ivanovich; he might also have caused the miscarriage of the latter&#x27;s unborn child. This left his younger son, the politically ineffectual Feodor Ivanovich, to inherit the throne, a man whose rule and subsequent childless death led to the end of the Rurik dynasty and the beginning of the Time of Troubles.

==Nickname==
The English word &quot;terrible&quot; is usually used to translate the Russian word () in Ivan&#x27;s epithet, but this is a somewhat archaic translation. The Russian word reflects the older English usage of &quot;terrible&quot; as in &quot;inspiring fear or terror; dangerous; powerful&quot; (i.e., similar to modern English &quot;terrifying&quot; or &quot;formidable&quot;). It does not convey the more modern connotations of English &quot;terrible&quot; such as &quot;defective&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;. According to Edward L. Keenan, Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s image in popular culture as a tyrant came from politicised Western travel literature of the Renaissance era. Anti-Russian propaganda during the Livonian War portrayed Ivan as a sadistic and oriental despot. Vladimir Dal defines specifically in archaic usage and as an epithet for tsars: &quot;courageous, magnificent, magisterial and keeping enemies in fear, but people in obedience&quot;. Other translations have also been suggested by modern scholars, including &quot;formidable&quot;, as well as &quot;awe-inspiring&quot;.

==Early life==
Ivan Vasilyevich was the first son of Vasili III by his second wife, Elena Glinskaya. Vasili&#x27;s mother, Sophia Palaiologina, was a Byzantine princess of the Palaiologos family. She was a daughter of Thomas Palaiologos, the younger brother of the last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos (). Elena&#x27;s mother was a Serbian princess and her father&#x27;s family, the Tatar Glinski clan (nobles based in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania), claimed descent both from Orthodox Hungarian nobles and the Mongol ruler Mamai (1335–1380). Born on 25 August, he received the name Ivan in honor of St. John the Baptist, the day of whose beheading falls on 29 August. In some texts of that era, it is also occasionally mentioned with the names Titus and Smaragd, in accordance with the tradition of polyonymy among the Rurikids. He was baptized in the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius by Abbot Joasaph (Skripitsyn) and two elders of the Joseph-Volokolamsk Monastery were elected as recipients—the monk Cassian Bossoy and the hegumen Daniel. Tradition says that in honor of the birth of Ivan, the Church of the Ascension was built in Kolomenskoye.

When Ivan was three years old, his father died from an abscess and inflammation on his leg that developed into blood poisoning. The closest contenders to the throne, except for the young Ivan, were the younger brothers of Vasily. Of the six sons of Ivan III, only two remained: Andrey and Yuri. Ivan was proclaimed the grand prince at the request of his father. His mother Elena Glinskaya initially acted as regent, but died in 1538, when Ivan was eight years old; many believe that she was poisoned. The regency then alternated between several feuding boyar families that fought for control. According to his own letters, Ivan, along with his younger brother Yuri, often felt neglected and offended by the mighty boyars from the Shuisky and Belsky families. In a letter to Andrey Kurbsky, Ivan remembered, &quot;My brother Iurii, of blessed memory, and me they brought up like vagrants and children of the poorest. What have I suffered for want of garments and food!&quot; That account has been challenged by the historian Edward Keenan, who doubts the authenticity of the source in which the quotations are found.

On 16 January 1547, at the age of 16, Ivan was crowned at the Cathedral of the Dormition in the Moscow Kremlin. The metropolitan placed on Ivan the signs of royal dignity: the Cross of the Life-Giving Tree, barmas, and the cap of Monomakh; Ivan Vasilyevich was anointed with myrrh, and then the metropolitan blessed the tsar. He was the first Russian monarch to be crowned the tsar of all Russia, partly imitating his grandfather, Ivan III. Until then, the rulers of Moscow were crowned as grand princes, but Ivan III assumed the title of sovereign of all Russia and used the title of tsar in his correspondence with other monarchs. Two weeks after his coronation, Ivan married his first wife, Anastasia Romanovna, a member of the Romanov family, who became the first Russian tsaritsa.
By being crowned tsar, Ivan was sending a message to the world and to Russia that he was now the only supreme ruler of the country, and his will was not to be questioned. According to historian Janet Martin, the new title &quot;symbolized an assumption of powers equivalent and parallel to those held by the former Byzantine caesar and the Tatar khan, both known in Russian sources as tsar. The political effect was to elevate Ivan&#x27;s position&quot;. The new title not only secured the throne but also granted Ivan a new dimension of power that was intimately tied to religion. He was now a &quot;divine&quot; leader appointed to enact God&#x27;s will, as &quot;church texts described Old Testament kings as &#x27;Tsars&#x27; and Christ as the Heavenly Tsar&quot;. The newly appointed title was then passed on from generation to generation, and &quot;succeeding Muscovite rulers... benefited from the divine nature of the power of the Russian monarch... crystallized during Ivan&#x27;s reign&quot;.

Like the Habsburgs and other monarchs in Europe, the first Russian tsars adopted mythological genealogies that connected them to Ancient Rome. In &quot;The Tale of the Princes of Vladimir&quot;, their lineage is traced to Rurik, the first prince of Novgorod in northern Russia, while a certain Prus, an alleged brother of Augustus who ruled what would become Prussia, is mentioned as a direct ancestor of Rurik. Ivan IV often mentioned his apparent kinship with Augustus, claiming not to be a &quot;Russe&quot; and highlighting his &quot;German&quot; descent from Rurik. Such genealogies served to elevate the position of the Russian monarch in the eyes of his subjects and other European powers, who were also creating mythological ancestors for themselves.

==Domestic policy==

Despite calamities triggered by the Great Fire of 1547, the early part of Ivan&#x27;s reign was one of peaceful reforms and modernization. Ivan revised the law code, creating the Sudebnik of 1550, founded a standing army (the ), established the (the first Russian parliament of feudal estates) and the council of the nobles (known as the Chosen Council) and confirmed the position of the Church with the Council of the Hundred Chapters (Stoglavy Synod), which unified the rituals and ecclesiastical regulations of the whole country. He introduced local self-government to rural regions, mainly in northeastern Russia, populated by the state peasantry.

In 1553 Ivan suffered a near-fatal illness and was thought not able to recover. While on his presumed deathbed Ivan had asked the boyars to swear an oath of allegiance to his eldest son, an infant at the time. Many boyars refused since they deemed the tsar&#x27;s health too hopeless for him to survive. This angered Ivan and added to his distrust of the boyars. There followed brutal reprisals and assassinations, including those of Metropolitan Philip and Prince Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky.

Ivan ordered in 1553 the establishment of the Moscow Print Yard, and the first printing press was introduced to Russia. Several religious books in Russian were printed during the 1550s and 1560s. The new technology provoked discontent among traditional scribes, which led to the Print Yard being burned in an arson attack. The first Russian printers, Ivan Fedorov and Pyotr Mstislavets, were forced to flee from Moscow to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Nevertheless, the printing of books resumed from 1568 onwards, with Andronik Timofeevich Nevezha and his son Ivan now heading the Print Yard.

Ivan had Saint Basil&#x27;s Cathedral constructed in Moscow to commemorate the seizure of Kazan. There is a legend that he was so impressed with the structure that he had the architect, Postnik Yakovlev, blinded so that he could never design anything as beautiful again. However, in reality Postnik Yakovlev went on to design more churches for Ivan and the walls of the Kazan Kremlin in the early 1560s as well as the chapel over Saint Basil&#x27;s grave, which was added to Saint Basil&#x27;s Cathedral in 1588, several years after Ivan&#x27;s death. Although more than one architect was associated with that name, it is believed that the principal architect is the same person.

Other events of the period include the introduction of the first laws restricting the mobility of the peasants, which would eventually lead to serfdom and were instituted during the rule of the future Tsar Boris Godunov in 1597. (See also Serfdom in Russia.)

The combination of bad harvests, devastation brought by the &quot;oprichnina&quot; and Tatar raids, the prolonged war and overpopulation caused a severe social and economic crisis in the second half of Ivan&#x27;s reign.


The 1560s brought to Russia hardships that led to a dramatic change in Ivan&#x27;s policies. Russia was devastated by a combination of drought, famine, unsuccessful wars against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Tatar invasions and the sea-trading blockade carried out by the Swedes, the Poles and the Hanseatic League. His first wife, Anastasia Romanovna, died in 1560, which was suspected to be a poisoning. The personal tragedy deeply hurt Ivan and is thought to have affected his personality, if not his mental health. At the same time one of Ivan&#x27;s advisors, Prince Andrey Kurbsky, defected to the Lithuanians, took command of the Lithuanian troops and devastated the Russian region of Velikiye Luki. This series of treacherous acts made Ivan paranoically suspicious of nobility.

On 3 December 1564 Ivan left Moscow for Aleksandrova Sloboda, where he sent two letters in which he announced his abdication because of the alleged embezzlement and treason of the aristocracy and the clergy. The boyar court was unable to rule in Ivan&#x27;s absence and feared the wrath of the Muscovite citizens. A boyar envoy departed for Aleksandrova Sloboda to beg Ivan to return to the throne. Ivan agreed to return on condition of being granted absolute power. He demanded the right to condemn and execute traitors and confiscate their estates without interference from the boyar council or church. Ivan decreed the creation of the .

The was a separate territory within the borders of Russia, mostly in the territory of the former Novgorod Republic in the north. Ivan held exclusive power over the territory. The Boyar Council ruled the (&#x27;land&#x27;), the second division of the state. Ivan also recruited a personal guard known as the , originally numbered 1,000. The were headed by Malyuta Skuratov. One known was the German adventurer Heinrich von Staden. The enjoyed social and economic privileges under the . They owed their allegiance and status to Ivan, not heredity or local bonds.

The first wave of persecutions targeted primarily the princely clans of Russia, notably the influential families of Suzdal. Ivan executed, exiled or forcibly tonsured prominent members of the boyar clans on questionable accusations of conspiracy. Among those who were executed were the Metropolitan Philip and the prominent warlord Alexander Gorbaty-Shuisky. In 1566 Ivan extended the to eight central districts. Of the 12,000 nobles, 570 became and the rest were expelled.

Under the new political system the were given large estates but, unlike the previous landlords, could not be held accountable for their actions. The men &quot;took virtually all the peasants possessed, forcing them to pay &#x27;in one year as much as [they] used to pay in ten. This degree of oppression resulted in increasing cases of peasants fleeing, which in turn reduced overall production. The price of grain increased ten-fold.

Ivan was repentant after the death of his son and his actions with the &quot;&quot;, and afterwards, he sent out lists compiling the deaths of his Christian victims killed by the system and asked monasteries to pray for every known one.

===Sack of Novgorod===

Conditions under the were worsened by the 1570 epidemic, a plague that killed 10,000 people in Novgorod and 600 to 1,000 daily in Moscow. During the grim conditions of the epidemic, a famine and the ongoing Livonian War, Ivan grew suspicious that noblemen of the wealthy city of Novgorod were planning to defect and to place the city under the control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. A Novgorod citizen, Petr Volynets, warned the tsar about the alleged conspiracy, which modern historians believe not to have been real. In 1570 Ivan ordered the to raid the city. The burned and pillaged Novgorod and the surrounding villages and the city has never regained its former prominence.

Casualty figures vary greatly from different sources. The First Pskov Chronicle estimates the number of victims at 60,000. According to the Third Novgorod Chronicle, the massacre lasted for five weeks. The massacre of Novgorod consisted of men, women and children who were tied to sleighs and run into the freezing waters of the Volkhov River, which Ivan ordered on the basis of unproved accusations of treason. He then tortured its inhabitants and killed thousands in a pogrom. The archbishop was also hunted to death. Almost every day, 500 or 600 people were killed, some by drowning, but the official death toll named 1,500 of Novgorod&#x27;s &quot;big&quot; people (nobility) and mentioned only about the same number of &quot;smaller&quot; people. Many modern researchers estimate the number of victims to range from 2,000 to 3,000 since after the famine and epidemics of the 1560s the population of Novgorod most likely did not exceed 10,000–20,000. Many survivors were deported.

The did not live long after the sack of Novgorod. During the 1571–72 Russo-Crimean War the failed to prove themselves worthy against a regular army. In 1572, Ivan abolished the and disbanded his .

===Appointment of Simeon Bekbulatovich===
In September or October 1575, Ivan proclaimed Simeon Bekbulatovich, his statesman of Tatar origin, the new grand prince of all Russia. Simeon reigned as a figurehead leader for about a year. According to the English envoy Giles Fletcher the Elder, Simeon acted on Ivan&#x27;s instructions to confiscate all of the lands that belonged to monasteries, and Ivan pretended to disagree with the decision. When the throne was returned to Ivan in September 1576 he returned some of the confiscated land and kept the rest.

==Foreign policy==
===Diplomacy and trade===
In 1547, Hans Schlitte, the agent of Ivan, recruited craftsmen in Germany for work in Russia. However, all of the craftsmen were arrested in Lübeck at the request of Poland and Livonia. The German merchant companies ignored the new port built by Ivan on the River Narva in 1550 and continued to deliver goods in the Baltic ports owned by Livonia. Russia remained isolated from sea trade.

Ivan established close ties with the Kingdom of England. Russian–English relations can be traced to 1551, when the Muscovy Company was formed by Richard Chancellor, Sebastian Cabot, Sir Hugh Willoughby and several London merchants. In 1553, Chancellor sailed to the White Sea and continued overland to Moscow, where he visited Ivan&#x27;s court. Ivan opened up the White Sea and the port of Arkhangelsk to the company and granted it privilege of trading throughout his reign without paying the standard customs fees.

With the use of English merchants, Ivan engaged in a long correspondence with Elizabeth I of England. While the queen focused on commerce, Ivan was more interested in a military alliance. Ivan even proposed to her once, and during his troubled relations with the boyars, he even asked her for a guarantee to be granted asylum in England if his rule was jeopardised. Elizabeth agreed on the condition that he provide for himself during his potential stay.

Ivan corresponded with overseas Orthodox leaders. In response to a letter of Patriarch Joachim of Alexandria asking him for financial assistance for the Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery, in the Sinai Peninsula, which had suffered by the Turks, Ivan sent in 1558 a delegation to Egypt Eyalet by Archdeacon Gennady, who, however, died in Constantinople before he could reach Egypt. From then on, the embassy was headed by Smolensk merchant Vasily Poznyakov, whose delegation visited Alexandria, Cairo and Sinai; brought the patriarch a fur coat and an icon sent by Ivan and left an interesting account of his two-and-a-half years of travels.

Ivan was the first ruler to begin cooperating with the free cossacks on a large scale. Relations were handled through the Posolsky Prikaz diplomatic department; Moscow sent them money and weapons, while tolerating their freedoms, to draw them into an alliance against the Tatars. The first evidence of cooperation surfaces in 1549 when Ivan ordered the Don Cossacks to attack Crimea.

===Conquest of Kazan and Astrakhan===


While Ivan was a child, armies of the Kazan Khanate repeatedly raided northeastern Russia. In the 1530s, the Crimean khan formed an offensive alliance with Safa Giray of Kazan, his relative. When Safa Giray invaded Russia in December 1540, the Russians used Qasim Tatars to contain him. After his advance was stalled near Murom, Safa Giray was forced to withdraw to his own borders.

The reverses undermined Safa Giray&#x27;s authority in Kazan. A pro-Russian party, represented by Shahgali, gained enough popular support to make several attempts to take over the Kazan throne. In 1545, Ivan mounted an expedition to the River Volga to show his support for the pro-Russian party.
In 1551, the tsar sent his envoy to the Nogai Horde, and they promised to maintain neutrality during the impending war. The Ar begs and Udmurts submitted to Russian authority as well. In 1551, the wooden fort of Sviyazhsk was transported down the Volga from Uglich all the way to Kazan. It was used as the Russian place-of-arms during the decisive campaign of 1552.

On 16 June 1552, Ivan led a strong Russian army towards Kazan. The last siege of the Tatar capital commenced on 30 August. Under the supervision of Prince Alexander Gorbaty-Shuisky, the Russians used battering rams, a siege tower, undermining, and 150 cannons. The Russians also had the advantage of efficient military engineers. The city&#x27;s water supply was blocked and the walls were breached. Kazan finally fell on 2 October, its fortifications were razed and much of the population massacred. Many Russian prisoners and slaves were released. Ivan celebrated his victory over Kazan by building several churches with oriental features, most famously Saint Basil&#x27;s Cathedral on Red Square in Moscow. The fall of Kazan was only the beginning of a series of so-called &quot;Cheremis wars&quot;. The attempts of the Moscow government to gain a foothold on the Middle Volga kept provoking uprisings of local peoples, which was suppressed only with great difficulty. In 1557, the First Cheremis War ended, and the Bashkirs accepted Ivan&#x27;s authority.
In campaigns in 1554 and 1556, Russian troops conquered the Astrakhan Khanate at the mouths of the Volga River, and the new Astrakhan fortress was built in 1558 by Ivan Vyrodkov to replace the old Tatar capital. The annexation of the Tatar khanates meant the conquest of vast territories, access to large markets and control of the entire length of the Volga River. According to Martin (2007), &quot;the subjugation of the Muslim khanates transformed Muscovy into an empire and fundamentally altered the balance of power on the steppe.&quot;

After his conquest of Kazan, Ivan is said to have ordered the crescent, a symbol of Islam, to be placed underneath the Christian cross on the domes of Orthodox Christian churches.

===Russo-Turkish War===
In 1568, Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, who was the real power in the administration of the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Selim, initiated the first encounter between the Ottoman Empire and its future northern rival. The results presaged the many disasters to come. A plan to unite the Volga and Don by a canal was detailed in Constantinople. In the summer of 1569, a large force under Kasim Pasha of 1,500 Janissaries, 2,000 Sipahis and a few thousand Azaps and Akıncıs were sent to lay siege to Astrakhan and to begin the canal works while an Ottoman fleet besieged Azov.

In early 1570, Ivan&#x27;s ambassadors concluded a treaty at Constantinople that restored friendly relations between the sultan and the tsar. The envoys were directed to tell to the sultan: &quot;My Tsar is not an enemy of the Moslem faith. His servant Sain Bulat rules the Khanate of Kassimov; Prince Kaibula in Yuriev, Ibak in Suroshsk, and the Nogai Princes in Romanov.”

===Livonian War===


In 1558, Ivan launched the Livonian War in an attempt to gain access to the Baltic Sea and its major trade routes. The war ultimately proved unsuccessful and stretched on for 24 years, engaging the Kingdom of Sweden, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Teutonic Knights of Livonia. The prolonged war had nearly destroyed the economy, and the &quot;&quot; had thoroughly disrupted the government. Meanwhile, the Union of Lublin had united the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland, and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth acquired an energetic leader, Stephen Báthory, who was supported by Russia&#x27;s southern enemy, the Ottoman Empire. Ivan&#x27;s realm was being squeezed by two of the time&#x27;s great powers.

After rejecting peace proposals from his enemies, Ivan had found himself in a difficult position by 1579. The displaced refugees fleeing the war compounded the effects of the simultaneous drought, and the exacerbated war engendered epidemics causing much loss of life.

Báthory then launched a series of offensives against Muscovy in the campaign seasons of 1579–81 to try to cut the Kingdom of Livonia from Muscovy. During his first offensive in 1579, he retook Polotsk with 22,000 men. During the second, in 1580, he took Velikie Luki with a 29,000-strong force. Finally, he began the Siege of Pskov in 1581 with a 100,000-strong army. Narva, in Estonia, was reconquered by Sweden in 1581.

Unlike Sweden and Poland, Frederick II of Denmark had trouble continuing the fight against Muscovy. He came to an agreement with John III of Sweden in 1580 to transfer the Danish titles of Livonia to John III. Muscovy recognised Polish–Lithuanian control of Livonia only in 1582. After Magnus von Lyffland, the brother of Fredrick II and a former ally of Ivan, died in 1583, Poland invaded his territories in the Duchy of Courland, and Frederick II decided to sell his rights of inheritance. Except for the island of Saaremaa, Denmark had left Livonia by 1585.

===Crimean raids===

In the later years of Ivan&#x27;s reign, the southern borders of Muscovy were disturbed by Crimean Tatars, mainly to capture slaves. (See also Slavery in the Ottoman Empire.) Khan Devlet I Giray of Crimea repeatedly raided the Moscow region. In 1571, the 40,000-strong Crimean and Turkish army launched a large-scale raid. The ongoing Livonian War left Moscow with a garrison of only 6,000 troops, which could not even delay the Tatar approach. Unresisted, Devlet devastated unprotected towns and villages around Moscow and caused the Fire of Moscow. Historians have estimated the number of casualties of the fire to be 10,000 to 80,000.

To buy peace from Devlet Giray, Ivan was forced to relinquish his claims on Astrakhan for the Crimean Khanate, but the proposed transfer was only a diplomatic maneuver and was never actually completed. The defeat angered Ivan. Between 1571 and 1572, preparations were made upon his orders. In addition to Zasechnaya cherta, innovative fortifications were set beyond the Oka River, which defined the border.

The following year, Devlet launched another raid on Moscow, now with a numerous horde, reinforced by Turkish janissaries equipped with firearms and cannons. The Russian army, led by Prince Mikhail Vorotynsky, was half the size but was experienced and supported by &quot;streltsy&quot;, equipped with modern firearms and gulyay-gorods. In addition, it was no longer divided into two parts (the and ), unlike during the 1571 defeat. On 27 July, the horde broke through the defensive line along the Oka River and moved towards Moscow. The Russian troops did not have time to intercept it, but the regiment of Prince Khvorostinin vigorously attacked the Tatars from the rear. The Khan stopped only 30 km from Moscow and brought down his entire army back on the Russians, who managed to take up defense near the village of Molodi. After several days of heavy fighting, Mikhail Vorotynsky with the main part of the army flanked the Tatars and dealt a sudden blow on 2 August, and Khvorostinin made a sortie from the fortifications. The Tatars were completely defeated and fled. The next year, Ivan, who had sat out in distant Novgorod during the battle, killed Mikhail Vorotynsky.

===Conquest of Siberia===

During Ivan&#x27;s reign, Russia started a large-scale exploration and colonization of Siberia. In 1555, shortly after the conquest of Kazan, the Siberian khan Yadegar and the Nogai Horde, under Khan Ismail, pledged their allegiance to Ivan in the hope that he would help them against their opponents. However, Yadegar failed to gather the full sum of tribute that he proposed to the tsar and so Ivan did nothing to save his inefficient vassal. In 1563, Yadegar was overthrown and killed by Khan Kuchum, who denied any tribute to Moscow.

In 1558, Ivan gave the Stroganov merchant family the patent for colonising &quot;the abundant region along the Kama River&quot;, and, in 1574, lands over the Ural Mountains along the rivers Tura and Tobol. The family also received permission to build forts along the Ob River and the Irtysh River. Around 1577, the Stroganovs engaged the Cossack leader Yermak Timofeyevich to protect their lands from attacks of the Siberian Khan Kuchum.

In 1580, Yermak started his conquest of Siberia. With some 540 Cossacks, he started to penetrate territories that were tributary to Kuchum. Yermak pressured and persuaded the various family-based tribes to change their loyalties and to become tributaries of Russia. Some agreed voluntarily because they were offered better terms than with Kuchum, but others were forced. He also established distant forts in the newly conquered lands. The campaign was successful, and the Cossacks managed to defeat the Siberian army in the Battle of Chuvash Cape, but Yermak still needed reinforcements. He sent an envoy to Ivan the Terrible with a message that proclaimed Yermak-conquered Siberia to be part of Russia to the dismay of the Stroganovs, who had planned to keep Siberia for themselves. Ivan agreed to reinforce the Cossacks with his streltsy, but the detachment sent to Siberia died of starvation without any benefit. The Cossacks were defeated by the local peoples, Yermak died and the survivors immediately left Siberia. Only in 1586, two years after the death of Ivan, would the Russians manage to gain a foothold in Siberia by founding the city of Tyumen.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===
Ivan the Terrible had at least six (possibly eight) wives, although only four of them were recognised by the Church. Three of them were allegedly poisoned by his enemies or by rival aristocratic families who wanted to promote their daughters to be his brides. He also had nine children.

In 1580, his heir, Ivan Ivanovich, married Yelena Sheremeteva from the Sheremetev noble family, which was a rare instance of the daughter of a boyar marrying into the dynasty.

On , Ivan chastised Yelena for being unsuitably dressed, considering her advanced pregnancy, leading to an altercation with his son Ivan Ivanovich. Historians generally believe that Ivan killed his son in a fit of rage, with the argument ending after the elder Ivan fatally struck his son in the head with his pointed staff. Yelena also suffered a miscarriage within hours of the incident. The event is depicted in the famous painting by Ilya Repin, &quot;Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan&quot;.

According to historian Simon Sebag Montefiore, Ivan also began an affair with the courtier Fyodor Basmanov. When the magnate Dmitri Oblensky Ovchinin sneered to Basmanov that &quot;We serve the tsar in useful ways, you in your filthy sodomitical dealings,” Ivan scalded and stabbed him to death.

===Arts===
Ivan was a poet and a composer of considerable talent. His Orthodox liturgical hymn, &quot;Stichiron No. 1 in Honor of St. Peter&quot;, and fragments of his letters were set to music by the Soviet composer Rodion Shchedrin. The recording, the first Soviet-produced CD, was released in 1988 to mark the millennium of Christianity in Russia.

=== Letters ===

D. S. Mirsky (1958) called Ivan &quot;a pamphleteer of genius&quot;. The exchange of letters attributed to Ivan and his former vassal Andrey Kurbsky, who defected to Lithuania in 1564, is often said to be the only existing source on Ivan&#x27;s personality that could provide crucial information on his reign, but Harvard professor Edward L. Keenan (1971) has argued that the letters are 17th-century forgeries. That contention, however, has not been widely accepted (exceptions include Donald Ostrowski and Brian Boeck); most other scholars, such as John Fennell and Ruslan Skrynnikov, have continued to argue for their authenticity. The most frequently cited argument by proponents of authenticity is the 1987 Morozov article on a manuscript, variously dated to 1594–95 or the 1620s, of the first Kurbskii letter to Ivan, which Martin (2007) asserted &quot;has substantially strengthened the argument for the authenticity of the correspondence&quot;. Skeptics point out that Morozov later acknowledged the 1620s as the date of composition, and that he never followed-up his preliminary findings with a separate study that he called for.

==Religion==
Ivan was a devoted follower of Orthodox Christianity but in his own specific manner. He placed the most emphasis on defending the divine right of the ruler to unlimited power under God. Some scholars explain the sadistic and brutal deeds of Ivan the Terrible with the religious concepts of the 16th century, which included drowning and roasting people alive or torturing victims with boiling or freezing water, corresponding to the torments of hell. That was consistent with Ivan&#x27;s view of being God&#x27;s representative on Earth with a sacred right and duty to punish. He may also have been inspired by the model of Archangel Michael with the idea of divine punishment.

Despite the absolute prohibition of the Church for even the fourth marriage, Ivan had seven wives. Even while his seventh wife was alive, he was negotiating to marry Mary Hastings, a distant relative of Queen Elizabeth of England. Polygamy was also prohibited by the Church. Still, Ivan planned to &quot;put his wife away&quot;. Ivan freely interfered in church affairs by ousting Metropolitan Philip and ordering him to be killed and accusing of treason and deposing the second-oldest hierarch, Novgorod Archbishop Pimen. Many monks were tortured to death during the Massacre of Novgorod.

In the conquered Khanates of Khazan and Astrakhan, Ivan was somewhat tolerant of Islam. This was largely to avoid a conflict with the Ottoman sultan over control of newly conquered Tatar regions. He considered these conquests to be a Christian victory. He was notable for his anti-Semitism. For example, after the capture of Polotsk, all unconverted Jews were ordered to be drowned, despite their role in the city&#x27;s economy.

==Death==
Ivan died from a stroke while he was playing chess with Bogdan Belsky on . Upon Ivan&#x27;s death, the Russian throne was left to his middle son, Feodor, a weak-minded figure. Feodor died childless in 1598, which ushered in the Time of Troubles.

==Appearance==

Little is known about Ivan&#x27;s appearance, as virtually all existing portraits were made after his death and contain uncertain amounts of artist&#x27;s impression. In 1567, the ambassador Daniel Prinz von Buchau said about Ivan that: &quot;He is very tall. His body is full of strength and quite thick, his large eyes, which constantly run around, observe everything carefully. His beard is red with a slight shade of black, quite long and thick, but like most Russians, he shaves his hair with a razor&quot;.

According to Ivan Katyryov-Rostovsky, the son-in-law of Michael I of Russia, Ivan had an unpleasant face with a long and crooked nose. He was tall and athletically built, with broad shoulders and a narrow waist.

In 1963, the graves of Ivan and his sons were excavated and examined by Soviet scientists. Chemical and structural analysis of his remains disproved earlier suggestions that Ivan suffered from syphilis or that he was poisoned by arsenic or strangled. At the time of his death, he was 178 cm tall (5 ft. 10 in.) and weighed 85–90 kg (187–198 lb.). His body was rather asymmetrical, had a large amount of osteophytes uncharacteristic of his age and contained excessive concentration of mercury. Researchers concluded that Ivan was athletically built in his youth but, in his last years, had developed various bone diseases and could barely move. They attributed the high mercury content in his body to his use of ointments to heal his joints.

==Title==
Ivan had the following title towards the end of his reign:
Kazan was added to Ivan&#x27;s title in 1553 and Astrakhan in 1554. The titles &quot;tsar of Kazan, tsar of Astrakhan&quot; first appeared in 1556. The title &quot;master of all the Siberian lands&quot; first appeared in 1555, and from 1582, was written as &quot;master of all the Siberian lands and northern countries&quot;. During the Livonian War, Livonia first appeared in his title in 1558. Polotsk was also included following its capture in 1562. Despite Russia&#x27;s defeat in the Livonian War, the title of Livonia was not abandoned.

In English, Ivan&#x27;s title of tsar was often translated as &quot;emperor&quot; from the first visit of Richard Chancellor to Moscow in 1553. For example: &quot;We, greatest Ivan Vassilleviche by the Grace of God Emperor of all Russia and Great Duke&quot;. However, the title was not consistently translated as &quot;emperor&quot;, such as in 1582: &quot;The Great Lord, King and Great Duke John the sonne of Vasili of all Russia...&quot;.

==Legacy==

Ivan completely altered Russia&#x27;s governmental structure, establishing the character of modern Russian political organisation. Ivan&#x27;s creation of the &quot;oprichnina&quot;, answerable only to him, afforded him personal protection and curtailed the traditional powers and rights of the boyars. Henceforth, tsarist autocracy and despotism would lie at the heart of the Russian state. Ivan bypassed the &quot;mestnichestvo&quot; system and offered positions of power to his supporters among the minor gentry. The empire&#x27;s local administration combined both locally and centrally appointed officials; the system proved durable and practical and sufficiently flexible to tolerate later modification.

Ivan&#x27;s expedition against Poland failed at a military level, but it helped extend Russia&#x27;s trade, political and cultural links with other European states. Peter the Great built on those connections in his bid to make Russia a major European power. At Ivan&#x27;s death, the empire encompassed the Caspian to the southwest and Western Siberia to the east. His southern conquests ignited several conflicts with the expansionist Ottoman Empire, whose territories were thus confined to the Balkans and the Black Sea regions.

Ivan&#x27;s management of Russia&#x27;s economy proved disastrous, both in his lifetime and afterward. He had inherited a government in debt, and in an effort to raise more revenue for his expansionist wars, he instituted a series of taxes on the peasantry and urban population. Martin (2007) stated: &quot;The reign of Ivan IV the Terrible was, in short, a disaster for Muscovy. (...) his subjects were impoverished, his economic resources depleted, his army weakened, and his realm militarily defeated. (...) By the time Ivan IV the Terrible died in 1584 , Muscovy (...) was on the brink of ruin&quot;.

== Posthumous reputation ==
Ivan&#x27;s notorious outbursts and autocratic whims helped characterise the position of tsar as one accountable to no earthly authority but only to God. Tsarist absolutism faced few serious challenges until the 19th century. The earliest and most influential account of his reign prior to 1917 was by the historian Nikolay Karamzin, who described Ivan as a &#x27;tormentor&#x27; of his people, particularly from 1560, though even after that date Karamzin believed there was a mix of &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;evil&#x27; in his character. In 1922, the historian Robert Wipper wrote a biography that reassessed Ivan as a monarch &quot;who loved the ordinary people&quot; and praised his agrarian reforms.

In the 1920s, Mikhail Pokrovsky, who dominated the study of history in the Soviet Union, attributed the success of the &quot;oprichnina&quot; to their being on the side of the small state owners and townsfolk in a decades-long class struggle against the large landowners, and downgraded Ivan&#x27;s role to that of the instrument of the emerging Russian bourgeoisie. But in February 1941, the poet Boris Pasternak observantly remarked in a letter to his cousin that &quot;the new cult, openly proselytized, is Ivan the Terrible, the &quot;Oprichnina&quot;, the brutality.&quot; Joseph Stalin, who had read Wipper&#x27;s biography, had decided that Soviet historians should praise the role of strong leaders, such as Ivan, Alexander Nevsky and Peter the Great, who had strengthened and expanded Russia. 

A consequence was that the writer Alexei Tolstoy began work on a stage version of Ivan&#x27;s life, and Sergei Eisenstein began what was to be a three-part film tribute to Ivan. Both projects were personally supervised by Stalin, at a time when the Soviet Union was engaged in a war with Nazi Germany. He read the scripts of Tolstoy&#x27;s play and the first of Eisenstein&#x27;s films in tandem after the Battle of Kursk in 1943, praised Eisenstein&#x27;s version but rejected Tolstoy&#x27;s. It took Tolstoy until 1944 to write a version that satisfied the Stalin. Eisenstein&#x27;s success with &quot;Ivan the Terrible Part 1&quot; was not repeated with the follow-up, &quot;The Boyar&#x27;s Revolt&quot;, which angered Stalin because it portrayed a man suffering pangs of conscience. Stalin told Eisenstein: &quot;Ivan the Terrible was very cruel. You can show that he was cruel, but you have to show why it was essential to be cruel. One of Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s mistakes was that he didn&#x27;t finish off the five major families.&quot; The film was suppressed until 1958.

In post-Soviet Russia, a campaign has been run to seek the granting of sainthood to Ivan IV, but the Russian Orthodox Church opposed the idea.
The first statue of Ivan the Terrible was officially open in Oryol, Russia, in 2016. Formally, the statue was unveiled in honor of the 450th anniversary of the founding of Oryol, a Russian city of about 310,000 that was established as a fortress to defend Moscow&#x27;s southern borders. Informally, there was a big political subtext. The opposition thinks that Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s rehabilitation echoes Stalin&#x27;s era. The erection of the statue was vastly covered in international media like &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Politico&quot;, and others. The Russian Orthodox Church officially supported the erection of the monument.

==Ancestry==
=== Patrilineal descent ===
Patrilineal descent is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations – which means that if Ivan IV were to choose a historically accurate house name, it would be Rurikid, as all his male-line ancestors have been of that house.

Ivan is a member of the Rurikid dynasty. Ivan&#x27;s patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son:

# Rurik, Prince of Novgorod, 
# Igor, Prince of Kiev, –945
# Sviatoslav I, Prince of Kiev, –972
# Vladimir, Grand Prince of Kiev, –1015
# Yaroslav, Grand Prince of Kiev, –1054
# Vsevolod I, Grand Prince of Kiev, –1093
# Vladimir II Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kiev, 1053–1125
# Yuri Dolgorukiy, Grand Prince of Kiev, 1099–1157
# Vsevolod the Big Nest, Grand Prince of Vladimir, 1154–1212
# Yaroslav II, Grand Prince of Vladimir, 1191–1246
# Alexander Nevsky, Grand Prince of Vladimir, 1221–1263
# Daniel, Prince of Moscow, 1261–1303
# Ivan I, Grand Prince of Vladimir and Moscow, 1288–1341
# Ivan II, Grand Prince of Vladimir and Moscow, 1326–1359
# Dmitry Donskoy, Grand Prince of Vladimir and Moscow, 1350–1389
# Vasily I, Grand Prince of Vladimir and Moscow, 1371–1425
# Vasily II, Grand Prince of Vladimir and Moscow, 1415–1462
# Ivan III, Grand Prince of Moscow and all Russia, 1440–1505
# Vasily III, Grand Prince of Moscow and all Russia, 1479–1533
# Ivan IV, Tsar and Grand Prince of all Russia, 1530–1584

<doc id="70727" wikidata="Q1771302" url="?curid=70727" title="Mike Royko">
<text>Michael Royko Jr. (September 19, 1932 – April 29, 1997) was an American newspaper columnist from Chicago, Illinois. Over his 30-year career, he wrote more than 7,500 daily columns for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. A humorist who focused on life in Chicago, he was the winner of the 1972 Pulitzer Prize for commentary.

==Early life and education==
Royko was born and grew up in Chicago, where he lived in an apartment above a bar. His mother, Helen (née Zak), was Polish, and his father, Michael Royko, was Ukrainian (born in Dolyna). He briefly attended Wright Junior College and then enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1952.

==Career==
===Journalism===
On becoming a columnist, Royko drew on experiences from his childhood. He began his newsman&#x27;s career as a columnist in 1955 for &quot;The O&#x27;Hare News&quot;, a U.S. Air Force newspaper, the City News Bureau of Chicago and Lerner Newspapers&#x27; &quot;Lincoln-Belmont Booster&quot; before working at the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; as a reporter, becoming an irritant to the City&#x27;s politicians with penetrating and skeptical questions and reports.

Royko covered Cook County politics and government in a weekly political column, soon supplemented with a second, weekly column reporting about Chicago&#x27;s folk music scene. 

The success of those columns earned him a daily column in 1964, writing about all topics for the &quot;Daily News&quot;, an afternoon newspaper. His column appeared five days a week until 1992, when he cut back to four days a week. Studs Terkel explained Royko&#x27;s incredible productivity and longevity by simply saying, &quot;He is possessed by a demon.&quot; In 1972, Royko received the Pulitzer Prize for commentary as a &quot;Daily News&quot; columnist.

===Chicago Sun-Times===
When the &quot;Daily News&quot; closed, Royko worked for its allied morning newspaper, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. In 1984, Rupert Murdoch, for whom Royko said he would never work, bought the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;. Royko commented &quot;No self-respecting fish would want to be wrapped in a Murdoch paper,&quot; and that &quot;his goal is not quality journalism. His goal is vast power for Rupert Murdoch, political power.&quot; Mike Royko then worked for the rival &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, a paper he had said he&#x27;d never work for and at which he never felt comfortable. For a period after the takeover, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; reprinted Royko&#x27;s columns, while new columns appeared in the &quot;Tribune.&quot;

Many of Royko&#x27;s columns are collected in books. He also authored &quot;Boss&quot;, his unauthorized biography of Richard J. Daley, the 48th mayor of Chicago, and the father of Richard, William, and John P. Daley. 
In 1976, a Royko column criticized the Chicago Police Department for providing an around-the-clock security detail for Frank Sinatra. Sinatra responded with a letter calling Royko a &quot;pimp,&quot; and threatening to &quot;punch [Royko] in the mouth&quot; for speculating that he wore a toupée. Royko auctioned the letter, the proceeds going to the Salvation Army. The winner of the auction was Vie Carlson, mother of Cheap Trick drummer Bun E. Carlos. After appearing on &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, Carlson consigned the letter to Freeman&#x27;s, which auctioned it in 2010.

Like some other columnists, Royko created fictitious personae with whom he could &quot;converse,&quot; the most famous being Slats Grobnik, a comically stereotyped working class Polish-Chicagoan. Generally, the Slats Grobnik columns described two men discussing a current event in a Polish neighborhood bar. In 1973, Royko collected several of the Grobnik columns in a collection titled &quot;Slats Grobnik and Some Other Friends&quot;. Another of Royko&#x27;s characters was his pseudo-psychiatrist Dr. I. M. Kookie (eponymous protagonist of &quot;Dr. Kookie, You&#x27;re Right!&quot; [1989]). Dr. Kookie, purportedly the founder of the Asylumism religion – according to which Earth was settled by a higher civilization&#x27;s rejected insane people – satirized pop culture and pop psychology. Through his columns, Royko helped make his favorite after-work bar, the Billy Goat Tavern, famous, and popularized the curse of the Billy Goat. Billy Goat&#x27;s reciprocated by sponsoring the &quot;Daily News&#x27;s&quot; 16-inch softball team and featuring Royko&#x27;s columns on their walls.

Royko&#x27;s columns were syndicated country-wide in more than 600 newspapers. He produced more than 7,500 columns in a four-decade career. He also wrote or compiled dozens of &quot;That&#x27;s Outrageous!&quot; columns for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;.

By the 1990s he turned to national themes, often taking a conservative perspective on issues, including gay rights.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
Royko married Carol Duckman in 1954, and they had two sons, David and Robert. She suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died on September 19, 1979, Royko&#x27;s 47th birthday. He later described that time as &quot;a period of disintegration.&quot; The only column he wrote during that period was a short note to readers on October 5, 1979, in which Royko wrote, &quot;We met when she was 6 and I was 9. Same neighborhood street. Same grammar school. So if you ever have a 9-year-old son who says he is in love, don&#x27;t laugh at him. It can happen.&quot; That column ended with a much-remembered line: &quot;If there&#x27;s someone you love but haven&#x27;t said so in a while, say it now. Always, always, say it now.&quot;

In 1986, Royko married Judy Arndt, who had worked as the head of the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; public service office and was a tennis instructor. The couple lived on Chicago&#x27;s Northwest Side and then on the city&#x27;s North Side before moving to Winnetka, Illinois. He and Judy had two children.

===Baseball and Chicago Cubs===
Royko was a fervent devotee of 16-inch softball as a player and team sponsor. After his death, he was inducted into the Chicago 16-inch Softball Hall of Fame, an honor Royko&#x27;s family insists he would have considered as meaningful as his Pulitzer. In the closing seconds of &quot;Royko at the Goat&quot;, the documentary by Scott Jacobs, Royko is heard saying, &quot;The Pulitzer Prize can&#x27;t compare&quot; to hitting a home run. 

Royko was a life-long fan and critic of the Chicago Cubs. Every spring he would devote a column to a &quot;Cubs Quiz,&quot; posing obscure trivia questions about mediocre Cubs players from his youth, such as Heinz Becker and Dom Dallessandro. Just prior to the 1990 World Series, he wrote about the findings of another fan, Ron Berler, who had discovered a spurious correlation called the &quot;Ex-Cubs Factor.&quot; Berler and Royko predicted that the heavily favored Oakland Athletics, who had a &quot;critical mass&quot; of ex-Cubs players on their Series roster, would lose the championship to the Cincinnati Reds. The Reds achieved an upset outcome in a four-game sweep of the A&#x27;s, with Royko&#x27;s sponsorship propelling the Ex-Cubs Factor theory into the spotlight. Carl Erskine repeats Royko&#x27;s claim of the Ex-Cubs Factor, and applies it to the 1951 Dodgers, in his book &quot;Carl Erskine&#x27;s Tales from the Dodgers Dugout.&quot;

==Death==
On April 22, 1997, Royko was admitted to Evanston Hospital, after experiencing chest pains. He was later transferred to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, and had surgery for an aneurysm; he died there from heart failure on April 29, at the age of 64. His body is entombed in Acacia Mausoleum, Acacia Park Cemetery, Chicago.

<text>William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1146 or 1147 – 14 May 1219), also called William the Marshal (Norman French: &#x27;, [[French language|French]]:&#x27;), was an Anglo-Norman soldier and statesman during High Medieval England who served five English kings: Henry II and his son and co-ruler Young Henry, Richard I, John, and finally Henry III.

Knighted in 1166, William Marshal spent his younger years as a knight errant and a successful tournament competitor; Stephen Langton eulogised him as the &quot;best knight that ever lived.&quot; In 1189, he became the &quot;de facto&quot; earl of Pembroke through his marriage to Isabel de Clare, whose parents were Aoife MacMurrough and Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke. The title of earl was not officially granted until 1199, and is considered to be the second creation of the Pembroke earldom. In 1216, upon the death of King John, William was appointed protector for John&#x27;s nine-year-old Henry III and regent of the kingdom. Just before his death, he fulfilled a promise he said he made in his youth while on crusade by taking vows as a Knight Templar, and was buried in the Temple Church in London.

Before William, his father&#x27;s family held a hereditary title of Marshal to the King, which by his father&#x27;s time had become recognised as a chief or master Marshalcy, involving management over other Marshals and functionaries. William became known as &quot;the Marshal&quot;, although by his time much of the function was delegated to more specialised representatives (as happened with other functions in the King&#x27;s household). Because he was an earl, and also known as the marshal, the term &quot;earl marshal&quot; was commonly used and this later became an established hereditary title in the English peerage.

==Early life==
William&#x27;s father, John Marshal, supported King Stephen when Stephen took the throne in 1135, but in about 1139 he changed sides to support the rival claimant Empress Matilda in her war of succession against Stephen, which led to the collapse of England into a 15-year civil war known as &quot;the Anarchy&quot;.

When King Stephen besieged Newbury Castle in 1152, according to William&#x27;s biographer, he used the young William as a hostage to ensure that John kept his promise to surrender the castle. John, however, used the time allotted to reinforce the castle and to alert Matilda&#x27;s forces. When Stephen ordered John to surrender immediately, threatening that William would be hanged, John replied that he should go ahead, saying, &quot;I still have the hammer and the anvil with which to forge still more and better sons!&quot; Subsequently, a pretence was made to launch William from a &quot;pierrière&quot; (a type of trebuchet) towards the castle, but Stephen could not bring himself to harm young William. William remained a crown hostage for many months, and was released following the peace resulting from the terms agreed at Winchester on 6 November 1153, by which the civil war was ended.

==Knight errant==

As a younger son of a minor nobleman, William had no lands or fortune to inherit, and had to make his own way in life. Around the age of twelve, when his father&#x27;s career was faltering, he was sent to the Château de Tancarville in Normandy to be brought up in the household of William de Tancarville, a great magnate and cousin of young William&#x27;s mother. Here he began his training as a knight. This would have included biblical stories, Latin prayers, and exposure to French romance literature to confer precepts of chivalry upon the future knight. In Tancarville&#x27;s household he is also likely to have learned practical lessons in the politics of courtly life. According to his thirteenth-century biography, &quot;&quot;, Marshal had enemies at Tancarville&#x27;s court who plotted against him—presumably men threatened by his close relationship with the magnate.

In 1166, William was knighted on campaign in Upper Normandy, then being invaded from Flanders. His first experience in battle received mixed reviews. According to &#x27;, everyone who witnessed the young knight in combat agreed that he had acquitted himself well. However, as medieval historian David Crouch remarks, &quot;War in the twelfth century was not fought wholly for honour. Profit was there to be made...&quot; In this regard Marshal was not so successful, as he was unable to translate his combat victories into profit from either ransom or seized booty. &#x27; relates that the Earl of Essex, expecting the customary tribute from his valorous knight after the battle, jokingly remarked: &quot;Oh? But Marshal, what are you saying? You had forty or sixty of them—yet you refuse me so small a thing!&quot;

In 1167, William was sponsored by William de Tancarville in his first tournament, where he found his true calling and began to develop skills that later made him a tournament champion. 

In 1168 William served in the household of his mother&#x27;s brother, Patrick, Earl of Salisbury. Later that year Patrick was escorting Queen Eleanor on a journey near the boundary of her province of Aquitaine and Marshal was part of the escort. They were ambushed by Guy de Lusignan, who was trying to capture Queen Eleanor. Although Eleanor escaped unharmed, Patrick was killed; William was wounded in the thigh and was taken prisoner and conveyed to a Lusignan castle to be held for ransom. Someone at the castle took pity on the young knight because it is told that he received a loaf of bread in which were concealed several lengths of clean linen bandages with which to dress his wounds. This act of kindness by an unknown person perhaps saved William&#x27;s life as infection of the wound could have killed him. After a period of time, he was ransomed by Queen Eleanor, who was apparently impressed by tales of his bravery. He would remain a member of Eleanor&#x27;s household for the next two years, taking part in tournaments and increasing his reputation as a chivalrous knight.

==Service to Young King Henry==
In 1170, Henry II appointed William as tutor-in-arms to his son, Henry the Young King. During the Revolt of 1173–1174 led by the Young King, little is known of William&#x27;s specific activities besides his loyalty to Young Henry. After the failed rebellion, Young Henry and his retinue, including William, travelled with Henry II for eighteen months, before asking for, and receiving, permission to travel to Europe to participate in knightly tournaments. William followed the Young King, and from 1176 to 1182 both men gained prestige from winning tournaments. Tournaments were dangerous, often deadly, staged battles in which money and valuable prizes were to be won by capturing and ransoming opponents, their horses and armour. William became a legendary tournament champion: on his deathbed, he recalled besting 500 knights during his tournament career.

In late 1182, William was accused of having an affair with Young Henry&#x27;s wife, Margaret of France. Historian Thomas Asbridge has stated that, while the affair very strongly appears to have been fabricated by William&#x27;s political enemies within the Young King&#x27;s service, it cannot be proven either way. David Crouch has suggested that the charge against William was actually one of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;, brought on by William&#x27;s own arrogance and greed, with the charge of adultery only introduced in the &quot;Life of William Marshal&quot; as a distraction from the real charges, of which he was most probably guilty. Regardless of the truth of the accusations, by early 1183 William had been removed from the Young King&#x27;s service.

Young Henry declared war against his brother Richard in January 1183, with Henry II siding with Richard. By May, William had been cleared of all charges against the Young King, and returned to his service. However, the Young King became sick in late May, and died on 11 June 1183. On his deathbed, the Young King asked William to fulfil the vow the Young King had made in 1182 to take up the cross and undertake a crusade to the Holy Land, and after receiving Henry II&#x27;s blessing William left for Jerusalem in late 1183. Nothing is known of his activities during the two years he was gone, except that he fulfilled Young Henry&#x27;s vow, and secretly committed to joining the Knights Templar on his deathbed.

==Royal favour==
After his return from the Holy Land in late 1185 or early 1186, William rejoined the court of King Henry II, and now served as a loyal captain through the many difficulties of Henry II&#x27;s final years. The returns of royal favour were almost immediate. The king gave William the large royal estate of Cartmel in Cumbria, and the keeping of Heloise, the heiress of the northern barony of Lancaster. It may be that the king expected him to take the opportunity to marry her and become a northern baron, but William seems to have had grander ambitions for his marriage. 

In 1188, faced with an attempt by Philip II to seize the disputed region of Berry, Henry II summoned the Marshal to his side. The letter by which he did this survives, and makes some sarcastic comments about William&#x27;s complaints that he had not been properly rewarded to date for his service to the king. Henry therefore promised him the marriage and lands of Dionisia, lady of Châteauroux in Berry. In the resulting campaign, the king fell out with his heir Richard, count of Poitou, who consequently allied with Philip II against his father. 

In 1189, while covering the flight of Henry II from Le Mans to Chinon, William unhorsed the undutiful Richard in a skirmish. William could have killed the prince but killed his horse instead, to make that point clear. He is said to have been the only man ever to unhorse Richard. Nonetheless, after Henry&#x27;s death Marshal was welcomed at court by his former adversary, now King Richard I, apparently recognising that Marshal&#x27;s loyalty and military accomplishments were too useful to ignore, especially for a king who was intending to go on Crusade.

During the old king&#x27;s last days he had promised the Marshal the hand and estates of Isabel de Clare (c. 1172–1220), but had not completed the arrangements. King Richard, however, confirmed the offer and so in August 1189, the Marshal married the daughter of Richard de Clare (Strongbow). She was either 17 or 18 at the time of the marriage and her father had been Earl of Pembroke. Marshal acquired large estates and claims in England, Wales, Normandy and Ireland. Some estates, however, were excluded from the deal. Marshal did not obtain Pembroke and the title of earl, which his father-in-law had enjoyed, until 1199, as it had been taken into the king&#x27;s hand in 1154. However, the marriage transformed the landless knight from a minor family into one of the richest men in the kingdom, a sign of his power and prestige at court. They had five sons and five daughters, and have numerous descendants. William made many improvements to his wife&#x27;s lands, including extensive additions to Pembroke Castle and Chepstow Castle. Even though the marriage was a reward for his political and military services, and despite a significant age difference, the couple appear to have developed a real love and affection for each other. It is also notable that there is no evidence that Marshal ever took a mistress, which was commonplace for nobles and often widely discussed and reported.

William was included in the council of regency which King Richard appointed on his departure for the Third Crusade in 1190. He took the side of John, the king&#x27;s brother, when the latter expelled the justiciar, William Longchamp, from the kingdom, but he soon discovered that the interests of John were different from those of Richard. Hence in 1193 he joined with the loyalists in making war upon him. In Spring 1194, during the course of the hostilities in England and before King Richard&#x27;s return, William Marshal&#x27;s elder brother John Marshal (who was serving as seneschal) was killed while defending Marlborough for the king&#x27;s brother John. Richard allowed Marshal to succeed his brother in the hereditary marshalship, and his paternal honour of Hamstead Marshall. The Marshal served the king in his wars in Normandy against Philip II. On Richard&#x27;s death-bed, the king designated Marshal as custodian of Rouen and of the royal treasure during the interregnum.

==King John and Magna Carta==

William supported King John when he became king in 1199, arguing against those who maintained the claims of Arthur of Brittany, the teenage son of John&#x27;s elder brother Geoffrey. William was heavily engaged with the defence of Normandy against the growing pressure of the Capetian armies between 1200 and 1203. He sailed with King John when he abandoned the duchy in December 1203. He and the king had a falling out in the aftermath of the loss of the duchy, when he was sent with the earl of Leicester as ambassadors to negotiate a truce with King Philip II of France in 1204. The Marshal took the opportunity to negotiate the continued possession of his Norman lands.

Before commencing negotiations with King Philip, William had been generously permitted to do homage to the King of France by King John so he might keep his possessions in Normandy; land which must have been of sentimental value due to the time spent there in his adolescence. However, once official negotiations began, Philip demanded that such homage be paid exclusively to him, which King John had not consented to. When William paid homage to King Philip, John took offence and there was a major row at court which led to cool relations between the two men. This became outright hostility in 1207 when John began to move against several major Irish magnates, including William.
Though he left for Leinster in 1207 William was recalled and humiliated at court in the autumn of 1208, while John&#x27;s justiciar in Ireland Meilyr fitz Henry invaded his lands, burning the town of New Ross.

Meilyr&#x27;s defeat by Countess Isabel led to her husband&#x27;s return to Leinster. He was once again in conflict with King John in his war with the Braose and Lacy families in 1210, but managed to survive. He stayed in Ireland until 1213, during which time he had Carlow Castle erected and restructured his honour of Leinster. Taken back into favour in 1212, he was summoned in 1213 to return to the English court.
Despite their differences, William remained loyal throughout the hostilities between John and his barons which culminated on 15 June 1215 at Runnymede with the sealing of Magna Carta. William was one of the few English earls to remain loyal to the king through the First Barons&#x27; War. It was William whom King John trusted on his deathbed to make sure John&#x27;s nine-year-old son Henry would get the throne. It was William who took responsibility for the king&#x27;s funeral and burial at Worcester Cathedral.

== Regent for Henry III ==
On 11 November 1216 at Gloucester, upon the death of King John, William Marshal was named by the king&#x27;s council (the chief barons who had remained loyal to King John in the First Barons&#x27; War) to serve as protector of the nine-year-old King Henry III, and regent of the kingdom. In spite of his advanced age (around 70) he prosecuted the war against Prince Louis and the rebel barons with remarkable energy. In the battle of Lincoln he charged and fought at the head of the young King&#x27;s army, leading them to victory. He was preparing to besiege Louis in London when the war was terminated by the naval victory of Hubert de Burgh in the straits of Dover.

William was criticised for the generosity of the terms he accorded to Louis and the rebels in September 1217, but his expedient settlement was dictated by sound statesmanship and a desire to remove the French from England as quickly as possible. Self-restraint and compromise were the keynotes of Marshal&#x27;s policy, hoping to secure peace and stability for his young liege. Both before and after the peace of 1217 he reissued Magna Carta, in which he is a signatory as one of the witnessing barons.

==Death and legacy==

William Marshal, who had enjoyed robust health throughout his life, was &quot;plagued by illness and pain&quot; in early 1219. By March, he realised that he was dying, so he summoned his eldest son, also William, and his household knights, and left the Tower of London for his estate at Caversham in Berkshire, near Reading, where he called a meeting of the barons, Henry III, the Papal legate Pandulf Verraccio, the royal justiciar (Hubert de Burgh), and Peter des Roches (Bishop of Winchester and the young King&#x27;s guardian). William rejected the Bishop&#x27;s claim to the regency and entrusted the regency to the care of the papal legate; he apparently did not trust the Bishop or any of the other magnates that he had gathered to this meeting. Fulfilling the vow he had made while on crusade, he was invested into the order of the Knights Templar on his deathbed. He died peacefully on 14 May 1219 at Caversham, surrounded by his friends and family. He was buried in the Temple Church in London, where his tomb can still be seen.

A statue of Marshal on horseback was unveiled in front of Pembroke Castle in May 2022. It was created by Harriet Addyman, and followed a campaign by Pembroke and Monkton Local History Society.

===Fate of the Marshal family===
During Ireland&#x27;s civil wars, William took two manors that the Bishop of Ferns claimed but could not get back. Some years after William&#x27;s death, that bishop is said to have laid a curse on the family that William&#x27;s sons would have no children, and the great Marshal estates would be scattered. Each of William&#x27;s sons did become earl of Pembroke and marshal of England, and each died without legitimate issue. William&#x27;s vast holdings were then divided among the husbands of his five daughters. The title of &quot;Marshal&quot; went to the husband of the oldest daughter, Hugh Bigod, 3rd Earl of Norfolk, and later passed to the Mowbray dukes of Norfolk and then to the Howard dukes of Norfolk, becoming &quot;Earl Marshal&quot; along the way. The title of &quot;Earl of Pembroke&quot; passed to William of Valence, the husband of Joan Marshal&#x27;s daughter, Joan de Munchensi; he became the first of the de Valence line of earls of Pembroke.

Through his daughter Isabel, William is an ancestor to both the Bruce and Stewart kings of Scots. Through his granddaughter Maud de Braose, William is an ancestor to the last Plantagenet kings, Edward IV through to Richard III, and all English monarchs from Henry VIII and afterward.

<doc id="70729" wikidata="Q1330119" url="?curid=70729" title="Non-linear editing">
<text>Non-linear editing is a form of offline editing for audio, video, and image editing. In offline editing, the original content is not modified in the course of editing. In non-linear editing, edits are specified and modified by specialized software. A pointer-based playlist, effectively an edit decision list (EDL), for video and audio, or a directed acyclic graph for still images, is used to keep track of edits. Each time the edited audio, video, or image is rendered, played back, or accessed, it is reconstructed from the original source and the specified editing steps. Although this process is more computationally intensive than directly modifying the original content, changing the edits themselves can be almost instantaneous, and it prevents further generation loss as the audio, video, or image is edited.

A non-linear editing system (NLE) is a video editing (NLVE) program or application, or an audio editing (NLAE) digital audio workstation (DAW) system. These perform non-destructive editing on source material. The name is in contrast to 20th-century methods of linear video editing and film editing.

In linear video editing, the product is assembled from beginning to end, in that order. One can replace or overwrite sections of material but never cut something out or insert extra material. Non-linear editing removes this restriction. Conventional film editing is a destructive process because the original film must be physically cut to perform an edit.

== Basic techniques ==
A non-linear editing approach may be used when all assets are available as files on video servers, or on local solid-state drives or hard disks, rather than recordings on reels or tapes. While linear editing is tied to the need to sequentially view film or hear tape, non-linear editing enables direct access to any video frame in a digital video clip, without having to play or scrub/shuttle through adjacent footage to reach it, as is necessary with video tape linear editing systems.

When ingesting audio or video feeds, metadata is attached to the clip. That metadata can be attached automatically (timecode, localization, take number, name of the clip) or manually (players names, characters, in sports). It is then possible to access any frame by entering directly the timecode or the descriptive metadata. An editor can, for example, at the end of the day in the Olympic Games, easily retrieve all the clips related to the players who received a gold medal.

The non-linear editing method is similar in concept to the cut and paste techniques used in IT. However, with the use of non-linear editing systems, the destructive act of cutting of film negatives is eliminated. It can also be viewed as the audio/video equivalent of word processing, which is why it is called desktop video editing in the consumer space.

== Broadcast workflows and advantages ==
In broadcasting applications, video and audio data are first captured to hard disk-based systems or other digital storage devices. The data are then imported into servers employing any necessary transcoding, digitizing or transfer. Once imported, the source material can be edited on a computer using any of a wide range of video editing software.

The end product of the offline non-linear editing process is a frame-accurate edit decision list (EDL) which can be taken, together with the source tapes, to an online quality tape or film editing suite. The EDL is then read into an edit controller and used to create a replica of the offline edit by playing portions of the source tapes back at full quality and recording them to a master as per the exact edit points of the EDL.

Editing software records the editor&#x27;s decisions in an EDL that is exportable to other editing tools. Many generations and variations of the EDL can exist without storing many different copies, allowing for very flexible editing. It also makes it easy to change cuts and undo previous decisions simply by editing the EDL (without having to have the actual film data duplicated). Generation loss is also controlled, due to not having to repeatedly re-encode the data when different effects are applied. Generation loss can still occur in digital video or audio when using lossy video or audio compression algorithms as these introduce artifacts into the source material with each encoding or re-encoding. codecs such as Apple ProRes, Advanced Video Coding and mp3 are very widely used as they allow for dramatic reductions on file size while often being indistinguishable from the uncompressed or losslessly compressed original.

Compared to the linear method of tape-to-tape editing, non-linear editing offers the flexibility of film editing, with random access and easy project organization. In non-linear editing, the original source files are not lost or modified during editing. This is one of the biggest advantages of non-linear editing compared to linear editing. With the EDLs, the editor can work on low-resolution copies of the video. This makes it possible to edit both standard-definition broadcast quality and high definition broadcast quality very quickly on desktop computers that may not have the power to process huge full-quality high-resolution data in real-time.

The costs of editing systems have dropped such that non-linear editing tools are now within the reach of home users. Some editing software can now be accessed free as web applications; some, like Cinelerra (focused on the professional market) and Blender, can be downloaded as free software; and some, like Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Movie Maker or Apple Inc.&#x27;s iMovie, come included with the appropriate operating system.

== Accessing the material ==
The non-linear editing retrieves video media for editing. Because these media exist on the video server or other mass storage that stores the video feeds in a given codec, the editing system can use several methods to access the material:

;Direct access
:The video server records feeds with a codec readable by the editing system, has network connection to the editor and allows direct editing. The editor previews material directly on the server (which it sees as remote storage) and edits directly on the server without transcoding or transfer.
;Shared storage
:The video server transfers feeds to and from shared storage that is accessible by all editors. Media in the appropriate codec on the server need only be transferred. If recorded with a different codec, media must be transcoded during transfer. In some cases (depending on material), files on shared storage can be edited even before the transfer is finished.
;Importing
:The editor downloads the material and edits it locally. This method can be used with the previous methods.

== Editor brands ==

The leading professional non-linear editing software for many years has been Avid Media Composer. This software is likely to be present in almost all post-production houses globally, and it is used for feature films, television programs, advertising and corporate editing. In 2011, reports indicated, &quot;Avid is still the most-used NLE on prime-time TV productions, being employed on up to 90 percent of evening broadcast shows.&quot;

Since then the rise in semi-professional and domestic users of editing software has seen a large rise in other titles becoming very popular in these areas. Other significant software used by many editors is Adobe Premiere Pro (part of Adobe Creative Cloud), Apple Final Cut Pro X, DaVinci Resolve and Lightworks. The take-up of these software titles is to an extent dictated by cost and subscription licence arrangements, as well as the rise in mobile apps and free software. , Davinci Resolve has risen in popularity within professional users and others alike - it had a user base of more than 2 million using the free version alone. This is a comparable user base to Apple&#x27;s Final Cut Pro X, which also had 2 million users .

Some notable NLEs are:
*Adobe Premiere Pro
*Avid Media Composer
*DaVinci Resolve
*Final Cut Pro X and its predecessor, Final Cut Pro 7.
*Lightworks
*Shotcut
*Vegas Pro

== Home use ==
Early consumer applications using a multimedia computer for non-linear editing of video may have a video capture card to capture analog video or a FireWire connection to capture digital video from a DV camera, with its video editing software. Various editing tasks could then be performed on the imported video before export to another medium, or MPEG encoded for transfer to a DVD.

Modern web-based editing systems can take video directly from a camera phone over a mobile connection, and editing can take place through a web browser interface, so, strictly speaking, a computer for video editing does not require any installed hardware or software beyond a web browser and an internet connection.

Nowadays there is a huge amount of home editing which takes place both on desktop and tablets or smartphones. The social media revolution has brought about a significant change in access to powerful editing tools or apps, at everyone&#x27;s disposal.

== History ==
When videotapes were first developed in the 1950s, the only way to edit was to physically cut the tape with a razor blade and splice segments together. While the footage excised in this process was not technically destroyed, continuity was lost and the footage was generally discarded. In 1963, with the introduction of the Ampex Editec, videotape could be edited electronically with a process known as linear video editing by selectively copying the original footage to another tape called a &quot;master&quot;. The original recordings are not destroyed or altered in this process. However, since the final product is a copy of the original, there is a generation loss of quality.

=== First non-linear editor ===
The first truly non-linear editor, the CMX 600, was introduced in 1971 by CMX Systems, a joint venture between CBS and Memorex. It recorded and played back black-and-white analog video recorded in &quot;skip-field&quot; mode on modified disk pack drives the size of washing machines that could store a half-hour worth of video &amp; audio for editing. These disk packs were commonly used to store data digitally on mainframe computers of the time. The 600 had a console with two monitors built in. The right monitor, which played the preview video, was used by the editor to make cuts and edit decisions using a light pen. The editor selected from options superimposed as text over the preview video. The left monitor was used to display the edited video. A DEC PDP-11 computer served as a controller for the whole system. Because the video edited on the 600 was in low-resolution black and white, the 600 was suitable only for offline editing.

=== The 1980s ===
Non-linear editing systems were built in the 1980s using computers coordinating multiple LaserDiscs or banks of VCRs. One example of these tape and disc-based systems was Lucasfilm&#x27;s EditDroid, which used several LaserDiscs of the same raw footage to simulate random-access editing. EditDroid was demonstrated at NAB in 1984. EditDroid was the first system to introduce modern concepts in non-linear editing such as timeline editing and clip bins.

The LA-based post house Laser Edit also had an in-house system using recordable random-access LaserDiscs.

The most popular non-linear system in the 1980s was Ediflex, which used a bank of U-matic and VHS VCRs for offline editing. Ediflex was introduced in 1983 on the Universal series &quot;Still the Beaver&quot;. By 1985 it was used on over 80% of filmed network programs and Cinedco was awarded the Technical Emmy for &quot;Design and Implementation of Non-Linear Editing for Filmed Programs.&quot;

In 1984, Montage Picture Processor was demonstrated at NAB. Montage used 17 identical copies of a set of film rushes on modified consumer Betamax VCRs. A custom circuit board was added to each deck that enabled frame-accurate switching and playback using vertical interval timecode. Intelligent positioning and sequencing of the source decks provided a simulation of random-access playback of a lengthy edited sequence without any re-recording. The theory was that with so many copies of the rushes, there could always be one machine cued up to replay the next shot in real time. Changing the EDL could be done easily, and the results seen immediately.

The first feature edited on the Montage was Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;Power&quot;. Notably, Francis Coppola edited &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; on the system, and Stanley Kubrick used it for &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;. It was used on several episodic TV shows (&quot;Knots Landing&quot;, for one) and on hundreds of commercials and music videos.

The original Montage system won an Academy Award for Technical Achievement in 1988. Montage was reincarnated as Montage II in 1987, and Montage III appeared at NAB in 1991, using digital disk technology, which was considerably less cumbersome than the Betamax system.

All of these original systems were slow, cumbersome, and had problems with the limited computer horsepower of the time, but the mid-to-late-1980s saw a trend towards non-linear editing, moving away from film editing on Moviolas and the linear videotape method using U-matic VCRs. Computer processing advanced sufficiently by the end of the 1980s to enable true digital imagery and has progressed today to provide this capability in personal desktop computers.

An example of computing power progressing to make non-linear editing possible was demonstrated in the first all-digital non-linear editing system, the &quot;Harry&quot; effects compositing system manufactured by Quantel in 1985. Although it was more of a video effects system, it had some non-linear editing capabilities. Most importantly, it could record (and apply effects to) 80 seconds (due to hard disk space limitations) of broadcast-quality uncompressed digital video encoded in 8-bit CCIR 601 format on its built-in hard disk array.

=== The 1990s ===
The term &quot;nonlinear editing&quot; was formalized in 1991 with the publication of Michael Rubin&#x27;s &quot;Nonlinear: A Guide to Digital Film and Video Editing&quot;—which popularized this terminology over other terminology common at the time, including &quot;real-time&quot; editing, &quot;random-access&quot; or &quot;RA&quot; editing, &quot;virtual&quot; editing, &quot;electronic film&quot; editing, and so on.

Non-linear editing with computers as it is known today was first introduced by Editing Machines Corp. in 1989 with the EMC2 editor, a PC-based non-linear off-line editing system that utilized magneto-optical disks for storage and playback of video, using half-screen-resolution video at 15 frames per second. A couple of weeks later that same year, Avid introduced the Avid/1, the first in the line of their Media Composer systems. It was based on the Apple Macintosh computer platform (Macintosh II systems were used) with special hardware and software developed and installed by Avid.

The video quality of the Avid/1 (and later Media Composer systems from the late 1980s) was somewhat low (about VHS quality), due to the use of a very early version of a Motion JPEG (M-JPEG) codec. It was sufficient, however, to provide a versatile system for offline editing. &quot;Lost in Yonkers&quot; (1993) was the first film edited with Avid Media Composer, and the first long-form documentary so edited was the HBO program &quot;Earth and the American Dream&quot;, which won a National Primetime Emmy Award for Editing in 1993.

The NewTek Video Toaster Flyer for the Amiga included non-linear editing capabilities in addition to processing live video signals. The Flyer used hard drives to store video clips and audio, and supported complex scripted playback. The Flyer provided simultaneous dual-channel playback, which let the Toaster&#x27;s video switcher perform transitions and other effects on video clips without additional rendering. The Flyer portion of the Video Toaster/Flyer combination was a complete computer of its own, having its own microprocessor and embedded software. Its hardware included three embedded SCSI controllers. Two of these SCSI buses were used to store video data, and the third to store audio. The Flyer used a proprietary wavelet compression algorithm known as VTASC, which was well regarded at the time for offering better visual quality than comparable non-linear editing systems using motion JPEG.

Until 1993, the Avid Media Composer was most often used for editing commercials or other small-content and high-value projects. This was primarily because the purchase cost of the system was very high, especially in comparison to the offline tape-based systems that were then in general use. Hard disk storage was also expensive enough to be a limiting factor on the quality of footage that most editors could work with or the amount of material that could be held digitized at any one time.

Up until 1992, the Apple Macintosh computers could access only 50 gigabytes of storage at once. This limitation was overcome by a digital video R&amp;D team at the Disney Channel led by Rick Eye. By February 1993, this team had integrated a long-form system that let the Avid Media Composer running on the Apple Macintosh access over seven terabytes of digital video data. With instant access to the shot footage of an entire movie, long-form non-linear editing was now possible. The system made its debut at the NAB conference in 1993 in the booths of the three primary sub-system manufacturers, Avid, Silicon Graphics and Sony. Within a year, thousands of these systems had replaced 35mm film editing equipment in major motion picture studios and TV stations worldwide.

Although M-JPEG became the standard codec for NLE during the early 1990s, it had drawbacks. Its high computational requirements ruled out software implementations imposing extra cost and complexity of hardware compression/playback cards. More importantly, the traditional tape workflow had involved editing from videotape, often in a rented facility. When the editor left the edit suite, they could securely take their tapes with them. But the M-JPEG data rate was too high for systems like Avid/1 on the Apple Macintosh and Lightworks on PC to store the video on removable storage. The content needed to be stored on fixed hard disks instead. The secure tape paradigm of keeping your content with you was not possible with these fixed disks. Editing machines were often rented from facilities houses on a per-hour basis, and some productions chose to delete their material after each edit session, and then ingest it again the next day to guarantee the security of their content. In addition, each NLE system had storage limited by its fixed disk capacity.

These issues were addressed by a small UK company, Eidos Interactive. Eidos chose the new ARM-based computers from the UK and implemented an editing system, launched in Europe in 1990 at the International Broadcasting Convention. Because it implemented its own compression software designed specifically for non-linear editing, the Eidos system had no requirement for JPEG hardware and was cheap to produce. The software could decode multiple video and audio streams at once for real-time effects at no extra cost. But most significantly, for the first time, it supported unlimited cheap removable storage. The Eidos Edit 1, Edit 2, and later Optima systems let the editor use &quot;any&quot; Eidos system, rather than being tied down to a particular one, and still keep his data secure. The Optima software editing system was closely tied to Acorn hardware, so when Acorn stopped manufacturing the Risc PC in the late 1990s, Eidos discontinued the Optima system.

In the early 1990s, a small American company called Data Translation took what it knew about coding and decoding pictures for the US military and large corporate clients and spent $12 million developing a desktop editor based on its proprietary compression algorithms and off-the-shelf parts. Their aim was to democratize the desktop and take some of Avid&#x27;s market. In August 1993, Media 100 entered the market, providing would-be editors with a low-cost, high-quality platform.

Around the same period, other competitors provided non-linear systems that required special hardware—typically cards added to the computer system. Fast Video Machine was a PC-based system that first came out as an offline system, and later became more online editing capable. The Imix video cube was also a contender for media production companies. The Imix Video Cube had a control surface with faders to allow mixing and shuttle control. Data Translation&#x27;s Media 100 came with three different JPEG codecs for different types of graphics and many resolutions. DOS-based D/Vision Pro was released by TouchVision Systems, Inc. in the mid-1990s and worked with the Action Media II board. These other companies caused tremendous downward market pressure on Avid. Avid was forced to continually offer lower-priced systems to compete with the Media 100 and other systems.

Inspired by the success of Media 100, members of the Premiere development team left Adobe to start a project called &quot;Keygrip&quot; for Macromedia. Difficulty raising support and money for development led the team to take their non-linear editor to the NAB Show. After various companies made offers, Keygrip was purchased by Apple as Steve Jobs wanted a product to compete with Adobe Premiere in the desktop video market. At around the same time, Avid—now with Windows versions of its editing software—was considering abandoning the Macintosh platform. Apple released Final Cut Pro in 1999, and despite not being taken seriously at first by professionals, it has evolved into a serious competitor to entry-level Avid systems.

=== DV ===
Another leap came in the late 1990s with the launch of DV-based video formats for consumer and professional use. With DV came IEEE 1394 (FireWire/iLink), a simple and inexpensive way of getting video into and out of computers. Users no longer had to convert video from analog to digital—it was recorded as digital to start with—and FireWire offered a straightforward way to transfer video data without additional hardware. With this innovation, editing became a more realistic proposition for software running on standard computers. It enabled desktop editing, producing high-quality results at a fraction of the cost of earlier systems.

=== HD ===
In early 2000, the introduction of highly compressed HD formats such as HDV has continued this trend, making it possible to edit HD material on a standard computer running a software-only editing system.

Avid is an industry standard used for major feature films, television programs, and commercials. Final Cut Pro received a Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award in 2002.

Since 2000, many personal computers include basic non-linear video editing software free of charge. This is the case of Apple iMovie for the Macintosh platform, various open-source programs like Kdenlive, Cinelerra-GG Infinity and PiTiVi for the Linux platform, and Windows Movie Maker for the Windows platform. This phenomenon has brought low-cost non-linear editing to consumers.

=== The cloud ===
The demands of video editing in terms of the volumes of data involved means the proximity of the stored footage being edited to the NLE system doing the editing is governed partly by the capacity of the data connection between the two. The increasing availability of broadband internet combined with the use of lower-resolution copies of original material provides an opportunity to not just review and edit material remotely but also open up access to far more people to the same content at the same time. In 2004 the first cloud-based video editor, known as Blackbird and based on technology invented by Stephen Streater, was demonstrated at IBC and recognized by the RTS the following year. Since that time a number of other cloud-based editors have become available including systems from Avid, WeVideo and Grabyo. Despite their reliance on a network connection, the need to ingest material before editing can take place, and the use of lower-resolution &quot;video proxies&quot;, their adoption has grown. Their popularity has been driven largely by efficiencies arising from opportunities for greater collaboration and the potential for cost savings derived from using a shared platform, hiring rather than buying infrastructure, and the use of conventional IT equipment over hardware specifically designed for video editing.

=== 4K ===
, 4K Video in NLE was fairly new, but it was being used in the creation of many movies throughout the world, due to the increased use of advanced 4K cameras such as the Red Camera. Examples of software for this task include Avid Media Composer, Apple&#x27;s Final Cut Pro X, Sony Vegas, Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve, Edius, and Cinelerra-GG Infinity for Linux.

=== 8K ===
 8K video was relatively new. 8K video editing requires advanced hardware and software capable of handling the standard.

===Image editing===
For imaging software, early works such as HSC Software&#x27;s Live Picture brought non-destructive editing to the professional market and current efforts such as GEGL provide an implementation being used in open-source image editing software.

== Quality ==
An early concern with non-linear editing had been picture and sound quality available to editors. Storage limitations at the time required that all material undergo lossy compression techniques to reduce the amount of memory occupied. Improvements in compression techniques and disk storage capacity have mitigated these concerns, and the migration to high-definition video and audio has virtually removed this concern completely. Most professional NLEs are also able to edit uncompressed video with the appropriate hardware.

<doc id="70730" wikidata="Q2143136" url="?curid=70730" title="Tribune Tower">
<text>The Tribune Tower is a , 36-floor neo-Gothic skyscraper located at 435 North Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The early 1920s international design competition for the tower became a historic event in 20th-century architecture. Built for &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; owner Robert R. McCormick, since 2018 it has been converted into luxury residences and in 2023 won a Driehaus Prize for architectural preservation and adaptive reuse from Landmarks Illinois.

The tower was the home of the &quot;Tribune&quot;, and the related Tribune Media, Tribune Broadcasting, and Tribune Publishing. WGN Radio (720 kHz) originated broadcasts from the building until June 18, 2018. CNN&#x27;s Chicago bureau was also located in the building. It is listed as a Chicago Landmark and is a contributing property to the Michigan–Wacker Historic District. Its predecessor, the first &quot;Tribune Tower&quot;, had been built in 1868. It was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.

==Design competition==
In 1922 the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; hosted an international interior and exterior design competition for its new headquarters to mark its 75th anniversary, and offered $100,000 in prize money with a $50,000 first prize for &quot;the most beautiful and distinctive office building in the world&quot;. The competition worked brilliantly for months as a publicity stunt, and the resulting entries still reveal a unique turning point in American architectural history. More than 260 entries were received.

The winner was a neo-Gothic design by New York architects John Mead Howells and Raymond Hood, with buttresses near the top.

The entry that many perceived as the best, by the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen, took second place and received $20,000. Saarinen&#x27;s tower was preferred by architects like Louis Sullivan, and was a strong influence on the next generation of skyscrapers, including Raymond Hood&#x27;s own subsequent work on the McGraw-Hill Building and the Rockefeller Center. The 1929 Gulf Building in Houston, Texas, designed by architects Alfred C. Finn, Kenneth Franzheim, and J. E. R. Carpenter, is a close realization of that Saarinen design. César Pelli&#x27;s 181 West Madison Street Building in Chicago is also thought to be inspired by Saarinen&#x27;s design.

Other Tribune tower entries by figures like Walter Gropius, Bertram Goodhue, Walter Burley Griffin, Bruno Taut, and Adolf Loos remain intriguing suggestions of what might have been, but perhaps not as intriguing as the one surmounted by a Mount Rushmore-like head of an American Indian. These entries were originally published by the Tribune Company in 1923 under the title &quot;Tribune Tower Competition&quot; and later in &quot;The Chicago Tribune Tower Competition: Skyscraper Design and Cultural Change in the 1920s&quot; by Katherine Solomonson, 2001.

In the 1980 book entitled &quot;The Tribune Tower Competition&quot; published by Rizzoli, authors Robert A. M. Stern, Stanley Tigerman as well as Bruce Abbey and other architects jokingly submitted &quot;late entries&quot; in Volume II of the work.

Archival materials regarding the competition and the building are held by the Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago.

==The building==

===Design===
By 1922 the neo-Gothic skyscraper had become an established design tactic, with the first important so-called &quot;American Perpendicular Style&quot; at Cass Gilbert&#x27;s Woolworth Building of 1913. This was a late example, perhaps the last important example, and criticized for its perceived historicism. Construction on the Tribune Tower was completed in 1925 and reached a height of 462 feet (141 m) above ground. The ornate buttresses surrounding the peak of the tower are especially visible when the tower is lit at night.

As was the case with most of Hood&#x27;s projects, the sculptures and decorations were made by the American artist Rene Paul Chambellan. The tower features carved images of Robin Hood (Hood) and a howling dog (Howells) near the main entrance to commemorate the architects. The top of the tower is designed after the &quot;Tour de beurre&quot; (″butter tower″) of the Rouen Cathedral in France, which is characteristic of the Late-Gothic style, that is to say, without a spire but with a crown-shaped top.

Rene Paul Chambellan contributed his sculpture talents to the buildings ornamentation, gargoyles and the Aesops&#x27; Screen over the main entrance doors. Rene Chambellan worked on other projects with Raymond Hood including the American Radiator Building and Rockefeller Center in New York City. Also, among the gargoyles on the Tribune Tower is one of a frog. That piece was created by Rene Chambellan to represent himself jokingly as he is of French ancestry.

===Collection of famous building fragments===

Prior to the building of the Tribune Tower, correspondents for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; had brought back rocks and bricks from a variety of historically important sites throughout the world at the request of Colonel McCormick. Many of these fragments have been incorporated into the lowest levels of the building and are labeled with their location of origin. Stones included in the wall are from such sites as the St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, Trondheim Cathedral, Taj Mahal, Clementine Hall, the Parthenon, Hagia Sophia, Süleymaniye Mosque, Corregidor Island, Palace of Westminster, petrified wood from the Redwood National and State Parks, the Great Pyramid, The Alamo, Notre-Dame de Paris, Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Tomb, the Great Wall of China, Independence Hall, Fort Santiago, Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm, Wawel Castle, Banteay Srei, and Rouen Cathedral&#x27;s Butter Tower, which inspired the shape of the building.

In 1999, during a celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, Buzz Aldrin presented a rock brought from the Moon, which was displayed in a window in the Tribune gift store (it could not be added to the wall, as NASA owns a large majority of the Apollo Moon rocks, and this one was merely on loan to the Tribune). The rock was removed in 2011 due to an outdated display. A new rock display is planned but has not been installed . A piece of steel recovered from the World Trade Center has been added to the wall. Tiles from the Sydney Opera House were added in 2006.

===Buildings influenced by the Tower===
Several buildings around the world make reference to the design of the Tribune Tower, most notably in Australia: the spires of the Grace Building in Sydney and the Manchester Unity Building in Melbourne. Additionally, the architects of One Atlantic Center located in the Midtown section of Atlanta were influenced by the building which is most evident in the shaft of the building as well as the base.

===Freedom Museum===
On April 11, 2006, the McCormick Tribune Freedom Museum opened, occupying two stories of the building, including the previous location of high-end gift store Hammacher Schlemmer. The museum closed this location on March 1, 2009, and redirected its efforts to become an online museum.

===Open House Chicago===
Tribune Tower has participated in Chicago Architecture Foundation&#x27;s event Open House Chicago every year, starting in 2011. This annual opportunity allows visitors to tour the interior of the building for free.

=== Condo conversion ===
The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, the building&#x27;s main tenant since it opened, moved out in June 2018, in order for the building to be converted to condos. The conversion of the building is set to cost more than $500 million. The conversion has run into some legal troubles regarding the sign: the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; contends that the sign is their intellectual property, so it can not remain on the building, but the developers stated that they had a contractual agreement to buy the sign for one dollar. Col. Robert R. McCormick&#x27;s former iconic office on the 24th floor will be turned into offices. In the former parking lot for Tribune Tower, there are plans to build Tribune Tower East, a super-tall skyscraper that would become the city&#x27;s second-tallest.

=== Plaza ===
The building&#x27;s plaza has a bronze sculpture by Bela Pratt depicting Nathan Hale, commissioned by McCormick in 1940. It is a replica of one commissioned by Yale University in 1899; Pratt&#x27;s widow gave permission for the copy. The statue was dedicated on June 4, 1940, with an event that included musical performances and an address by Professor William Warren Sweet, attended by high school Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps members. It depicts Hale with wrists and ankles bound. The pedestal states that it is &quot;Dedicated to the reserve officers of America&quot; and the statue&#x27;s base has Hale&#x27;s famous quote &quot;I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.&quot;

==In popular culture==
* On November 21 and 28, 2007, in episodes entitled &quot;One Wedding and a Funeral&quot; and &quot;The Thing About Heroes&quot; of the television series &quot;&quot;, historical pieces stolen from the building led Mac Taylor (Gary Sinise) to his hometown of Chicago. Upon further investigation of the man stalking him, Taylor found a dead body in an office of an unused floor in the building. The episodes were filmed entirely on location in Chicago.
* Conan O&#x27;Brien was seen running past the tower while en route from New York to Los Angeles on his first episode as host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.
* The snipers in the 2011 film &quot;&quot; are shooting from the 26th floor of the Tribune Tower just below the buttresses.

<text>Sohonet is a community-of-interest network for the television, film and media production community based in the Soho area of London.

Founded in 1995 by a group of post-production companies, Sohonet links many of the British film studios to London&#x27;s post-production community. Sohonet also provides access to the Internet, and private wide-area links to other countries.

The system links film and media companies, TV broadcasters, publishers, Internet providers, graphic designers and recording studios via seamless transatlantic fibre connections to a global media network in the United States, (Los Angeles, New York City, Hawaii, Chicago, Seattle, Atlanta, etc.), Canada (Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal), New Zealand, Australia, France, Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Singapore and Italy ( Rome) and the ability to provide connectivity to locations worldwide via Fibre Optic links.

Leading British film studios, Pinewood Studios, Shepperton Studios, Three Mills Studios, Twickenham Film Studios, Longcross Studios and Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, have direct optical fiber connectivity to the Sohonet London Fiber Ring, with campus connectivity on the sites provided via fiber and VDSL technologies. As well as may other studios globally, Australian examples Village Roadshow Studios, Melbourne City Studios, and Los Angeles shooting film studios Hollywood Center Studios, and Red Studios Hollywood, as well as Warner Bros., Universal Studios, HBO to name a few.

A pioneering user of IP-over-ATM networking, Sohonet has since moved away from ATM to using gigabit Ethernet, 10 Gigabit Ethernet and MPLS technologies, including the use of wavelength division multiplexing on backbone connections. Sohonet is one of the pioneers of tapeless digital intermediate, and one of the instigators of the media dispatch protocol developed by the Pro-MPEG consortium, which later became a SMPTE standard. All types of media file formats, from QuickTime DV MPEG AES/EBU MXF through OMFi, AAF, OpenEXR, to 4k DPX files are supported.

Sohonet has its own private optical fibre networks in several cities and provides high speed object storage based on OpenStack Swift, in number of locations worldwide Los Angeles, London, and Sydney. On top of these stores, Sohonet operates a fast file transfer service called FileRunner. Sohonet also provides high speed secure connections, referred to as FastLane, into a number of public cloud providers Google Cloud Platform, SoftLayer, and Amazon Web Services, to enable large scale Cloud computing for 3D rendering.

In 2020, Sohonet won a Primetime Engineering Emmy Award for its collaborative video review and editing platform, ClearView Flex. The Clearview Flex platform was also among the winners of the Advanced Imaging Society&#x27;s Entertainment Technology Lumiere Awards for 2020.

In 2022, Sohonet won an additional Primetime Engineering Emmy Award for its ClearView Pivot remote collaboration tool, Clearview Pivot.

<doc id="70734" wikidata="Q151559" url="?curid=70734" title="Gaspé Peninsula">
<text>The Gaspé Peninsula, also known as Gaspesia (, ; ), is a peninsula along the south shore of the St. Lawrence River that extends from the Matapedia Valley in Quebec, Canada, into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It is separated from New Brunswick on its southern side by Chaleur Bay and the Restigouche River. The name &quot;Gaspé&quot; comes from the Mi&#x27;kmaq word , meaning &quot;end&quot;, referring to the end of the land.

The Gaspé Peninsula is slightly larger than Belgium, at . The population is 140,599 as of the 2011 census. It is also noted as the only region outside the Channel Islands to contain native speakers of Jersey Norman.

==Geography==
Sea cliffs dominate the peninsula&#x27;s northern shore along the St. Lawrence River. Cap Gaspé, jutting into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, is the easternmost point of the peninsula. Percé Rock (or &quot;Rocher Percé&quot;), an island pierced by a natural arch, is just offshore of the peninsula&#x27;s eastern end. The peninsula&#x27;s interior is a rugged northward continuation of the Appalachian Mountains called the Chic-Chocs, with Mount Jacques-Cartier at the peninsula&#x27;s highest peak.

Mount Albert (Mont Albert) at is another high mountain in the Chic-Chocs. Its summit, an alpine area above the tree line, is a nearly flat plateau about across composed of serpentine bedrock and supporting quite unusual flora. The ascent of Mount Albert from near sea level is challenging, but popular with hikers, offering a view of the St. Lawrence and the Côte-Nord, the river&#x27;s north shore, part of the ancient bedrock of the Canadian Shield.

=== Inland ===
The interior portions of the peninsula are dominated by the Chic-Choc Mountains, part of the Notre Dame Mountains, an extension of the Appalachian Mountains.

The town of Murdochville, at about above sea level, has had a varied history, and is now home to several wind turbines. It is reached by Route 198, which extends inland from the northern shore of the peninsula, soon climbing into the mountains and entering vast forests, crossing several small rivers before reaching the town. From Murdochville, Route 198 follows the York River to the city of Gaspé on the peninsula&#x27;s eastern tip.

==Economy==
The peninsula&#x27;s economy has historically been focused on fishing, agriculture and forestry. But primary resource-based industries are suffering due to overfishing, overexploitation, and fewer numbers of farmers in business, forcing the region to move towards tourism and the services industry.
===Tourism===
The peninsula is one of Quebec&#x27;s most popular tourism regions. The Gaspé National Park (Parc national de la Gaspésie) is in the Chic-Chocs, and Forillon National Park is at the peninsula&#x27;s northeastern tip. A section of the International Appalachian Trail travels through the peninsula&#x27;s mountains. Bonaventure National Park is here. As of September 2018 the area also hosts Canada&#x27;s third UNESCO Global Geopark.

==Infrastructure==

===Roads===
* Quebec Route 132 circles the peninsula, with one branch following the coast and the other cutting across it at Sainte-Flavie.

<text>Chaleur Bay, also Chaleurs Bay, Bay of Chaleur (in , ), in Mi&#x27;gmaq it is called Mawipoqtapei, is an arm of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence located between Quebec and New Brunswick, Canada.

The name of the bay is attributed to explorer Jacques Cartier (Baie des Chaleurs). It translates into English as &quot;bay of warmth&quot; or &quot;bay of torrid weather&quot;.

Chaleur Bay is the 31st member of the Most Beautiful Bays of the World Club.

Chaleur Bay is host to an unusual visual phenomenon, the Fireship of Chaleur Bay, an apparition of sorts resembling a ship on fire which has reportedly appeared at several locations in the bay. It is possibly linked to similar sightings several hundred kilometres to the south where the Fireship of Northumberland Strait has been seen in the Northumberland Strait. This may have given rise to a phantom ship legend, which dates back more than two centuries. The story (and witnesses) claim that a sailing ship burned in the waters north of the city of Campbellton, New Brunswick on the Restigouche River, possibly from the Battle of the Restigouche, and is visible in certain weather and light conditions. A drawing of a ghost wielding an anchor and menacing two sailors can be seen on the city&#x27;s welcome sign. 

==Geography==
Chaleur Bay opens to the east with its southern shore formed by the north shore of New Brunswick. The northern shore is formed by the south shore of the Gaspé Peninsula. The bay measures approximately in width at its widest point between Bathurst and New Carlisle. The western end of the bay transitions into the estuary of the Restigouche River at Dalhousie, New Brunswick.

The mouth of the bay is delineated by a line running from &quot;Haut-fond Leander&quot; near Grande-Rivière, Quebec in the north and the &quot;Miscou Shoals&quot; near Miscou Island, New Brunswick in the south.

Canadian Hydrographic Service chart number 4486 is the bathymetric navigational data repository for the area.

===Beaches===
The shores of Chaleur Bay include numerous beaches, particularly in the south. Many rivers also form barachois or &quot;barrier beaches&quot;. The Eel River Bar is one such beach, located at the mouth of the Eel River, immediately to the west of the village of Charlo, New Brunswick. This sand bar is unique, in that it not only has fresh water on one side and salt water on the other, but it is also home to the endangered piping plover.

Tourism in the region has been driven mainly by beachgoers in the summer months. The warm ocean currents emitting from the larger Gulf of Saint Lawrence result in some of the warmest saltwater on the Atlantic coast north of Virginia.

===Rivers and Bays===

The estuaries of various rivers emptying into the bay create a prominent smell of salt water, notably in the estuary of the Restigouche River.

The following major rivers flow into the bay:

Quebec:
* Rivière Matapédia (via the Restigouche)
* Rivière Cascapédia
* Rivière Bonaventure
* Rivière du Grand Pabos
* Rivière du Petit Pabos
* Grande Rivière (Percé)

New Brunswick (from north to south):
* Nepisiguit Bay
* Upsalquitch River (via the Restigouche)
* Eel River
* Charlo River, one of two Maritimes&#x27; nesting areas of Harlequin ducks
* Benjamin River, one of two Maritimes&#x27; nesting area of Harlequin ducks
* Nash Creek
* Jacquet River
* Elmtree River
* Nigadoo River (Via Nepisiguit Bay)
* Millstream River (Via Nepisiguit Bay)
* Tetagouche River (Via Nepisiguit Bay)
* Middle River (Via Nepisiguit Bay)
* Nepisiguit River (Via Nepisiguit Bay)

Between Quebec and New Brunswick:
* Restigouche River
::The Restigouche Estuary was designated (June, 2000) an Important Bird Area of International Significance (the first in New Brunswick) because it is the largest staging area in eastern North America for Black scoter.
* Patapédia River (via the Restigouche)

===Islands===
Chaleur Bay has several islands. Although not entirely located within the bay, the northern shores of Miscou Island and Lameque Island form part of the southern shore of the bay. Heron Island lies near Dalhousie, New Brunswick and is located south of Carleton-sur-Mer, Quebec.

===Climate===
The bay&#x27;s shape and the steep cliffs along its northern shore sometimes create particularly windy conditions especially off Nepisiguit Bay. Under the right wind direction and speed, sea conditions on large areas of the bay can become quite treacherous. Tidal currents are generally weak, except at the mouths of some rivers and certain channels. Its configuration tends to channel the wind for two reasons: the steep cliffs on its North side, and its V shape. This means that in the middle of this section, off Nepisiguit Bay, there is a zone that is particularly windy and subject to high seas if the wind is from the Northwest or the Northeast.

Tidal currents in this section rarely reach one knot, except at the mouths of some rivers and some channels.

==History==

Immigration from Arran Island, Scotland: Bryce&#x27;s &quot;The Geology of Arran&quot; 1855 notes: &quot;Many years ago, a large population, the largest then collected in any one spot in [the island of] Arran, inhabited [Sannox] glen, and gained a scanty subsistence by fishing and by cultivating fertile plots on the sunny hill-sides. In 1832, the whole of the families amounting to 500 persons, were obliged [in the Scottish Highland Clearances] to leave the island, but were furnished with the means of reaching New Brunswick. They formed a settlement at Chaleur Bay, which became very prosperous&quot;.

The eastern end of Chaleur Bay was the site of the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s Operation Pointe Maisonnette in September 1943, during the Battle of the St. Lawrence.

== Fauna ==
Chaleur Bay is home to a variety of marine life including numerous species of ground fish and shellfish such as lobster and scallops.

Additionally, many of the bay&#x27;s pristine rivers support some of the largest wild Atlantic Salmon remaining in the north Atlantic Ocean, creating a haven for sport angling.

While whale watching including endangered targets such as Fin whales are popular attractions in the bay, North Atlantic right whales, one of the rarest whales and had been considered to be rare in Gulf of St. Lawrence region, were recently confirmed to be present in Chaleur Bay more often in recent years.

==In literature==
Chaleur Bay is mentioned in John Greenleaf Whittier&#x27;s poem, &quot;Skipper Ireson&#x27;s Ride.&quot;

<text>The Wrigley Building is a skyscraper located at 400–410 North Michigan Avenue on Chicago&#x27;s Near North Side. It is located on the Magnificent Mile directly across Michigan Avenue from the Tribune Tower. Its two towers in an elaborate style were built between 1920 and 1924 to house the corporate headquarters of the Wrigley Company. Its bright white facade is covered in terra cotta.

==History==
When ground was broken for the Wrigley Building in 1920, there were no major office buildings north of the Chicago River. The Michigan Avenue Bridge, which spans the river just south of the building, was still under construction. The land was selected by chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. for the headquarters of his company. The building was designed by the architectural firm of Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White using the shape of the Giralda tower of Seville&#x27;s Cathedral combined with French Renaissance details. The south tower was completed in September 1921 and the north tower in May 1924. Walkways between the towers were added at the ground level and the third floor. In 1931, another walkway was added at the fourteenth floor to allow for a rearrangement of Wrigley&#x27;s offices. The two towers, not including the levels below Michigan Avenue, have a combined area of .

The two towers are of differing heights, with the south tower rising to 30 stories and the north tower to 21 stories. On the south tower is a clock with faces pointing in all directions. Each face is in diameter. The building is clad in glazed terra-cotta, which provides its gleaming white façade. On occasion, the entire building is hand washed to preserve the terra cotta. At night, the building is brightly lit with floodlights.

The Wrigley Building was Chicago&#x27;s first air-conditioned office building. If one walks through the center doors, one will enter a secluded park area overlooking the Chicago River.

In the 1957 science fiction film &quot;Beginning of the End&quot;, giant grasshoppers attack downtown Chicago, and in one scene are shown climbing up the side of the Wrigley Building.

The Wrigley Building was sold in 2011 to a group of investors that includes Zeller Realty Group and Groupon co-founders Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell. The new owners made the building more attractive to businesses by adding a Walgreens, a coffee shop, a fitness center and a nursing room for mothers.

==Tenants==
Addresses at 400 North Michigan Avenue:
*The Consulate-General of Austria resides in Suite 707.
*The Consulate-General of the United Kingdom resided on the 12th and 13th floors of the Wrigley Building from 1996 to August 2011, when the Consulate-General relocated to another building on North Michigan Avenue.
*Select Model Management, located in Suite 700.

Addresses at 410 North Michigan Avenue:
*Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, housed in Suite 900.
*EZCall, a division of Kronos Incorporated, housed in Suite 660.
*Capax Global US Headquarters, housed in Suite 650.

<doc id="70738" wikidata="Q85377" url="?curid=70738" title="Arctic Archipelago">
<text>The Arctic Archipelago, also known as the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, is an archipelago lying to the north of the Canadian continental mainland, excluding Greenland (an autonomous territory of Denmark, by itself, much larger than the combined area of the archipelago) and Iceland (an independent country)

Situated in the northern extremity of North America and covering about , this group of 36,563 islands, surrounded by the Arctic Ocean, comprises much of Northern Canada, predominately Nunavut and the Northwest Territories. The archipelago is showing some effects of climate change, with some computer estimates determining that melting there will contribute to the rise in sea levels by 2100.

==History==
Around 2500 BCE, the first humans, the Paleo-Eskimos, arrived in the archipelago from the Canadian mainland. Between 1000 and 1500 CE, they were replaced by the Thule people, who are the ancestors of today&#x27;s Inuit.

British claims on the islands, the British Arctic Territories, were based on the explorations in the 1570s by Martin Frobisher. Canadian sovereignty was originally (1870–80) only over island portions that drained into Foxe Basin, Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait. Canadian sovereignty over the islands was established by 1880 when Britain transferred them to Canada. The District of Franklin – established in 1895 – comprised almost all of the archipelago. The district was dissolved upon the creation of Nunavut in 1999. Canada claims all the waterways of the Northwest Passage as Canadian Internal Waters; however, most maritime countries view these as international waters. Disagreement over the passages&#x27; status has raised Canadian concerns about environmental enforcement, national security, and general sovereignty. East of Ellesmere Island, in the Nares Strait, lies Hans Island, ownership of which is now shared between Canada and Denmark, after a decades-long dispute.

==Geography==
The archipelago extends some longitudinally and from the mainland to Cape Columbia, the northernmost point on Ellesmere Island. It is bounded on the west by the Beaufort Sea; on the northwest by the Arctic Ocean; on the east by Greenland, Baffin Bay and Davis Strait; and on the south by Hudson Bay and the Canadian mainland. The various islands are separated from each other and the continental mainland by a series of waterways collectively known as the Northwest Passage. Two large peninsulas, Boothia and Melville, extend northward from the mainland. The northernmost cluster of islands, including Ellesmere Island, is known as the Queen Elizabeth Islands and was formerly the Parry Islands.

The archipelago consists of 36,563 islands, of which 94 are classified as major islands, being larger than , and cover a total area of . The islands of the archipelago over , in order of descending area, are:

After Greenland, the archipelago is the world&#x27;s largest high-Arctic land area. The climate of the islands is Arctic, and the terrain consists of tundra except in mountainous regions. Most of the islands are uninhabited; human settlement is extremely thin and scattered, being mainly coastal Inuit settlements on the southern islands.

<doc id="70740" wikidata="Q166534" url="?curid=70740" title="Betty Cuthbert">
<text>Elizabeth Alyse Cuthbert (20 April 1938 – 6 August 2017), was an Australian athlete and a four-time Olympic champion. She was nicknamed Australia&#x27;s &quot;Golden Girl&quot;. During her career, she set world records for 60 metres, 100 yards, 200 metres, 220 yards and 440 yards. Cuthbert also contributed to Australian relay teams completing a win in the 4 × 100 metres, 4 × 110 yards, 4 × 200 metres and 4 × 220 yards. Cuthbert had a distinctive running style, with a high knee lift and mouth wide open. She was named in 1998 an Australian National Treasure and was inducted as a Legend in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Athletics Australia Hall of Fame in 2000.

==Early life==
Cuthbert was born to Leslie and Marion alongside her nonidentical twin sister, Marie &#x27;Midge&#x27;. She also had another sister, Jean and a brother, John. Cuthbert was born 20 minutes before Marie. According to Midge, the twins were not alike, but very special to each other. The daughter of nursery owners, Cuthbert was born in Merrylands, New South Wales, and grew up in the Sydney suburb of Ermington, where she attended Ermington Public School. Of her upbringing, Cuthbert stated &quot;My parents always encouraged me and I had a good home life. We were always taught to respect things and other people.&quot;

Marion attended church and sent her four children to Sunday school. As a teenager, Cuthbert attended Parramatta Home Science School. She left school at the age of 16 to work in the family nursery.

==Athletic career==

Cuthbert was a member of the Western Suburbs Athletic Club. At the age of 18, with the 1956 Summer Olympics to be held in Melbourne, Cuthbert set a World Record in the 200 metres, making her one of the favourites for a gold in that event. Cuthbert first reached the finals of the 100 metres, setting an Olympic record of 11.4 seconds in her heat (also her personal best), while the Australian world record holder Shirley Strickland was eliminated.

Cuthbert won the final and was then the big favourite for the 200 metres title. She lived up to the expectations and became the Australian &quot;Golden Girl&quot;. A third gold medal for Cuthbert came when she ran the final leg on in the 4 × 100 metres final, which the Australian team won in a new world record.

During 1958 Cuthbert set world records for 100 and 220 yards but was beaten in both events by arch-rival and double-Olympic bronze medallist Marlene Mathews at the Australian Championships. Later in the year, at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, Wales, Cuthbert could only place fourth in the 100y and second in the 220y, again behind Mathews.

She set a world record at 440 yards, which was broken in September 1959 by Maria Itkina of the Soviet Union.

In the lead-up to the 1960 Summer Olympics, in Rome, Cuthbert set a world 220 yards and 200 metres record of 23.2 seconds in winning the Australian championships. At the Rome Games, she suffered from injury and was eliminated from the quarterfinals of the 100 metres. Subsequently, she retired from the sport of track and field.

Her retirement did not last long, though, for she returned at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Western Australia, helping Australia to a gold medal in the sprint relay.

Afterwards, she concentrated on the 400 metres, and she competed in that event in the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, when it was on the Olympic program for women for the first time. Though not impressive in the heats, Cuthbert won the title for her fourth Olympic gold medal, beating Ann Packer of Great Britain in an Olympic record of 52.01. She is the only Olympian, male or female, to have won a gold medal in all sprint (running) events: 100, 200 and 400 metres. She subsequently verified her retirement for good after Tokyo. Also in 1964 she received the Helms Award for her sporting contributions.

She was coached by June Ferguson, who was her physical education teacher in high school.

==Personal life==
Cuthbert had multiple sclerosis from 1969 and in 2002 had a severe brain haemorrhage. She stated that, despite her MS, she never once asked God &#x27;Why me?&#x27;, and instead &quot;knew that God wanted her to use it to help other people.&quot; In 1985, Cuthbert became a born-again Christian at the age of 47. Always believing she was a Christian, the speaker at a public rally said there were private-practising Christians present. She felt compelled to publicly declare her faith in Jesus. From then on, Cuthbert tried to share the good news of Jesus with as many people as possible. She did, however, initially want to be healed of her MS, and someone encouraged her to go to church where she could be healed. She claimed she went, looking for healing, instead of the Healer. In her own words: &quot;I found out about the healer, and then I couldn&#x27;t care less about the healing. That&#x27;s the best thing. I get so much joy out of it and I want to tell other people about it. I think that&#x27;s why I was meant to come back to the Olympics in 1964 because now I&#x27;m well known and it helps me to tell people about Jesus.&quot;

Following her diagnosis with multiple sclerosis, Cuthbert became a dedicated advocate for the disease and was an important player in the creation of MS Research Australia, attending the organisation&#x27;s 2004 inauguration alongside then-PM John Howard. She was a tireless campaigner for national awareness of the disease, and, following her death in 2017, was credited by CEO of MS Research Australia, Dr. Matthew Miles, as having had an incredible impact on Australia&#x27;s recognition and understanding of MS.

In 1991, Cuthbert left her home state, New South Wales, for Western Australia, where she settled in Mandurah. Cuthbert was one of the bearers of the Olympic Torch at the Opening Ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Sitting in a wheelchair and accompanied by Raelene Boyle, she carried the Olympic Torch at the stadium, as one of the runners for the final segment, before the lighting of the Olympic Flame by Cathy Freeman.

Cuthbert died in 2017, aged 79, in Mandurah. She never married or had children. Rhonda Gillam, a 78-year-old West Australian mother-of-three, devoted the last 26 years of her life to caring for Cuthbert. Gillam stated that Cuthbert&#x27;s MS also took her hearing. Cuthbert&#x27;s twin sister, Midge Johnston, stated that Betty had been struggling with dementia in recent years, worrying that Betty would not remember her, but Betty always said &quot;Midge, of course I remember you.&quot;

==Post-death==
The day after her death, there was a minute&#x27;s silence before the start of competition at the 2017 World Athletics Championships in London, and Australian athletes were granted permission by the International Association of Athletics Federations to wear black armbands in competition. Cuthbert was the only Australian among the 10 inaugural inductees to the IAAF Hall of Fame in 2012. There were many tributes to Cuthbert&#x27;s career and life from significant Australians:
* Cathy Freeman: &quot;Betty is an inspiration and her story will continue to inspire Australian athletes for generations to come. I&#x27;m so happy I got to meet such a tremendous and gracious role model, and Olympic champion.&quot;
* Marlene Matthews: &quot;I have never met anyone that had such great faith and determination. It was this faith that kept her going for so long and through the most difficult times.&quot;
* John Coates: &quot;Betty battled her illness for many years and showed tremendous courage, but more importantly she always managed to smile. Betty was a member of a unique band of athletes who inspired thousands of Australians.&quot;
* Malcolm Turnbull: &quot;Rest in Peace Betty Cuthbert – an inspiration and a champion on and off the track.&quot;
* Bill Shorten: &quot;Rest in peace Betty Cuthbert, forever a golden girl.&quot;
Cuthbert&#x27;s funeral was held on 16 August 2017 in Mandurah and her body was cremated at Fremantle Cemetery. Several hundred were present, including Margaret Court, Raelene Boyle, and Marjorie Jackson. Dawn Fraser (whom Cuthbert handed the Olympic Torch to during the opening ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics) gave a speech. Her twin sister, Midge, lit a candle of remembrance; and niece and nephew, Louise and Peter, also gave speeches. A public memorial service for Cuthbert was held on 21 August 2017, at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Tributes were led by broadcaster Alan Jones and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce. Also in attendance were former athletes Norma Fleming and Marlene Matthews.

<text>Banks Island is one of the larger members of the Arctic Archipelago. Situated in the Inuvik Region, and part of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, of the Northwest Territories, it is separated from Victoria Island to its east by the Prince of Wales Strait and from the mainland by Amundsen Gulf to its south. The Beaufort Sea lies to its west, and to its northeast M&#x27;Clure Strait separates the island from Prince Patrick Island and Melville Island.

It is home to at least fourteen mammal species including the Peary caribou, barren-ground caribou, and polar bears. At one time over 68,000 muskoxen lived on the island, the majority of the world&#x27;s population. However, the bacterium &quot;Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae&quot; has led to a sharp decline in their numbers. The island is the summer home to hundreds of thousands of migratory birds who nest at Banks Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary No. 1 and Banks Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary No. 2.

As of the 2016 census it had a human population of 103, all in Sachs Harbour.

== Human settlements and discoveries ==
Pre-Dorset cultural sites have been found that date from approximately 1500 BCE but European contact came much later. In 1820 it was seen from Melville Island by Sir William Edward Parry and named &quot;Banks Land&quot; in honour of Sir Joseph Banks. However, during the later exploration of the area by the McClure Arctic Expedition the island was marked on their maps as &quot;Baring Island&quot;. McClure&#x27;s ship, , was frozen in Prince of Wales Strait. That spring he sent out sledging parties and determined that Banks Island was an island. In the following year he almost circumnavigated the island but was again frozen in at Mercy Bay where he and his crew spent the next three months before making their escape across the ice.

The only permanent settlement on the island is the Inuvialuit hamlet of Sachs Harbour (Ikahuak), on the southwest coast.

==Description==
Banks Island covers an area and it is the world&#x27;s 24th largest island and Canada&#x27;s fifth largest island. It is about long, and at its widest point at the northern end, across. The highest point of the island is in the south, Durham Heights and rises to about .

==Ecology==
The island is treeless, with the tallest plant, the Arctic willow, growing occasionally to about the height of a person&#x27;s knee but usually standing no taller than .

Banks Island is home to a large colony of lesser snow geese, which make their way across the Amundsen Gulf from the mainland. There is an annual goose hunt in the spring out of Sachs Harbour. The island is part of the tundra world biome, which has extremely cold winters. The island is home to barren-ground caribou, polar bears, muskoxen, and birds, including year round residents the common raven and ptarmigan.

Two federal migratory bird sanctuaries were founded on the island in 1961.

Aulavik National Park of Canada, a fly-in park, protects about of Arctic lowlands at the northern end of the island. The park has the highest concentration of muskoxen on earth, and is home to the endangered Peary caribou. The Thomsen River runs through the park, and is the northernmost navigable river (by canoe) in North America. Ptarmigan and ravens are considered the only year-round birds in the park, although 43 species make seasonal use of the area. In Inuvialuktun, &quot;Aulavik&quot; means &quot;place where people travel&quot; and the &quot;wildlife and land have supported aboriginal peoples for more than 3,400 years, from Pre-Dorset cultures to contemporary Inuvialuit.&quot;

The first confirmed grizzly–polar bear hybrid found in the wild was shot on Banks Island in April 2006, near Sachs Harbour.

==Climate==
Banks Island has a tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;) typical of the Canadian Arctic with long, cold winters and short, cool summers. Since the activities of many residents of the community revolve around fishing, hunting, and travel, many residents have considerable knowledge of weather conditions, permafrost, and even erosion patterns.


==HMS &quot;Investigator&quot;==

In July 2010, Parks Canada archaeologists looking for found it 15 minutes after they started a sonar scan of Banks Island&#x27;s Mercy Bay. The archaeology crew had no plans to raise the ship. They planned to conduct a thorough sonar scan of the area, then send a remotely operated vehicle.

<text>The national [[Flag of the Netherlands|flag]] of the [[Netherlands]] () is a horizontal tricolour of red, white, and blue. The current design originates as a variant of the late 16th century orange-white-blue &quot;Prinsenvlag&quot; (&quot;Prince&#x27;s Flag&quot;), evolving in the early 17th century as the red-white-blue &quot;Statenvlag&quot; (&quot;States Flag&quot;), the naval flag of the States-General of the Dutch Republic, making the Dutch flag the oldest tricolour flag in continuous use. As a flag that symbolises the transformation from monarchy to republic, it has inspired both the derivative Russian flag, and after the French Revolution in 1789, the vertically striped French tricolour; both flags in turn influenced many other tricolours.
During the 1920s and the economic crisis of the 1930s, the old Prince&#x27;s Flag with the colour orange gained some popularity among Protestants, Orangists, conservative liberals, fascists, and others. To end the confusion, the colours red, white and blue and its official status as the national flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands were reaffirmed by royal decree on 19 February 1937.

==Description==

The national flag of the Netherlands is a tricolour flag. The horizontal fesses are bands of equal size in the colours from top to bottom, red (officially described as a &quot;bright vermilion&quot;), white (silver), and blue (&quot;cobalt blue&quot;). The flag proportions (width:length) are 2:3. The colour parameters were defined in November 1958 by the NEN (former HCNN) in as the following:

In this definition, the colours are defined using CIE-1931 colour space and Standard illuminant C at a 45° angle.

The flag of the Netherlands is similar to that of Luxembourg, but it has a smaller width and it uses slightly darker shades of red and blue. The similarity of the two flags has given rise to a national debate to change the flag of Luxembourg, initiated by Michel Wolter in 2006.

===Symbolism===

Each band of colour in the Dutch flag holds some symbolism for the country. The red band symbolizes bravery, strength, valor, and hardiness; the white band, peace and honesty; and the blue band represents vigilance, truth, loyalty, perseverance, and justice.

Another theory as to why the Dutch flag has these colours is because some researchers claim that they used to be a symbol of society: red symbolizes the people, white the church and blue the nobility.

==History==

=== Middle Ages ===

At the end of the 15th century, when the majority of the Netherlands provinces were united under the Duke of Burgundy, the Cross of Burgundy flag of the Duke of Burgundy was used for joint expeditions, which consisted of a red saltire resembling two crossed, roughly-pruned (knotted) branches, on a white field. Under the later House of Habsburg this flag remained in use.

===Prince&#x27;s Flag===

In 1568 provinces of the Low Countries rose in revolt against King Philip II of Spain, and Prince William of Orange (1533–1584) placed himself at the head of the rebels. The etymology of the House of Orange is unrelated to the name of the fruit or the colour. Usage of the colours orange, white and blue (Dutch: &quot;Oranje, Wit, Blauw&quot;, from French &quot;Orange, Blanc, Bleu&quot;) was based on the livery of William and was first recorded in the siege of Leiden in 1574, when Dutch officers wore orange-white-blue brassards. The first known full colour depiction of the flag appeared in 1575 (see image). In Ghent in 1577, William was welcomed with a number of theatrical allegories represented by a young girl wearing orange, blue and white. The first explicit reference to a naval flag in these colours is found in the ordonnances of the Admiralty of Zeeland, dated 1587, i.e. shortly after William&#x27;s death.

The colour combination of orange, white, and blue is commonly considered the first Dutch flag. The 400th anniversary of the introduction of the Dutch flag was commemorated in the Netherlands by the issue of a postage stamp in 1972. That was based on the fact that in 1572 the &quot;Watergeuzen&quot; (&quot;Gueux de mer&quot;, &quot;Sea Beggars&quot;), the pro-Dutch privateers, captured Den Briel in name of William, Prince of Orange. However, it is uncertain whether they took an orange-white-blue flag with them on the event, although they certainly started using an orange-white-blue tricolour somewhat later in the 1570s. It became later known as the Prinsenvlag (&quot;Prince&#x27;s flag&quot;) and served as the basis for the former South African flag, the flags of New York City and the Flag of Albany, New York, all three former dominions of the Dutch Republic.

===Statenvlag===
Red as replacement for orange appeared as early as 1596, but more often after about 1630, as indicated by paintings of that time. Red gradually replaced orange (1630–60) as a sign of political change and growing dissociation of the Republic from the House of Orange. It appears that prior to 1664, the red-white-blue tricolour was commonly known as the &quot;Flag of Holland&quot; (); named after one of the revolting provinces. In 1664, the States of Zeeland, one of the other revolting provinces, complained about this, and a resolution of the States-General introduced the name &quot;States Flag&quot; (), which the red, white and blue tricolour will be known hereafter. The Dutch navy between 1588 and 1630 had always displayed the Prince&#x27;s Flag, and after 1663 always the States Flag, with both flag variants being in use during the period of 1630–1662.

The red-white-blue triband flag as used in the 17th century is said to have influenced the designs of both the seminal Russian flag and the French flag. In turn, these two flags would later influence many others.

===Flag of the Batavian Republic===

With the Batavian Revolution in the Netherlands in the last decade of the 18th century, and the subsequent conquest by the French, the name &quot;Prince&#x27;s Flag&quot; was forbidden and the red-white-blue of the Statenvlag was the only flag allowed, analogous as it was to France&#x27;s own tricolour, chosen just a few months earlier, ironically influenced by that same Statenvlag. In 1796 the red division of the flag was embellished with the figure of a Netherlands maiden, with a lion at her feet, in the upper left corner. In one hand she bore a shield with the Roman fasces and in the other a lance crowned with the cap of liberty. This flag had a life as short as that of the Batavian Republic for which it was created.
Louis Bonaparte, made king of Holland by his brother the Emperor Napoleon, wished to pursue a purely Dutch policy and to respect national sentiments as much as possible. He removed the maiden of freedom from the flag and restored the old tricolour. His pro-Dutch policies led to conflicts with his brother, however, and the Netherlands were incorporated into the French Empire. In 1810 its flag was replaced by the imperial emblems.

===Modern flag===
In 1813, the Netherlands regained its independence and the Prince of Orange returned from exile and contemporary newspapers report that the red-white-blue flag was flown decorated with an orange Pennon/pennant and solid‐coloured orange flags were displayed in many places in the country as a sign of allegiance of the people to the House of Orange.

Just before the outbreak of World War II, the Prince&#x27;s Flag resurfaced again. Some people were convinced that orange, white, and blue were the true colours of the Dutch flag, particularly members of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands. To end the discussion, a royal decree established the colours of the Dutch flag as: &#x27;The colours of the flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are red, white and blue&#x27; (). It became the shortest decree in history, and was issued by Queen Wilhelmina on 19 February 1937.

It was only on 16 August 1949 that the exact colour parameters were defined by the Ministry of the Navy as bright vermilion (red), white and cobalt blue. The pennant is usually added on King&#x27;s Day (, 27 April) or other festive occasions related to the Royal Family.

==Display and use==
The flag is customarily flown at government buildings and military bases in the Netherlands and abroad all year round. Private use is more uncommon. Only on national holidays is there widespread private use. At the birthdays or weddings of specific members of the Royal House, an orange pennant is added to the flag. There are special non-holiday festivities or remembrance occasions when the flag is flown, such as at the homes of students who have just graduated. The flag is then often accompanied by the graduate&#x27;s school bag hung from the tip of the flagpole. The flag can also be displayed at times of sadness at half-mast (or a black pennant is added to the flag when hanging at half-mast is not possible) as a sign of respect or national mourning.

There are a number of flag-flying days in the Netherlands. The holidays on which flags are put out by the government, according to the flag instruction, are:
The dates mentioned in parentheses are the dates when the flags are put out, should the original scheduled flag day fall on a Sunday, when possible. Exceptions are Remembrance of the Dead and Liberation Day, should one of them fall on a Sunday, the flags are put out anyway.

The prime minister of the Netherlands is responsible for announcing updates to the flag instruction (last given in 2013 when Queen&#x27;s Day on 30 April became King&#x27;s Day on 27 April), announcing one-off flag days (last given on 19 March 2019 to remember the Utrecht tram shooting), and announcing one-off modifications to the current flag days (last given in 2020 when the flags were put out at half-mast on 4 May the whole day instead of from 18:00, due to the 75-year anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands and the COVID-19 pandemic).

When a member of the Dutch Royal House is born, the flag instruction will be determined some weeks before the child is expected. In the most recent occasions – in 2003, 2005 and 2007, when Princess Máxima was expecting Princess Amalia, Princess Alexia and Princess Ariane respectively, it was announced that immediately upon announcement of the birth, the flags would be put out with the orange pennant. However, because Amalia and Ariane were born while darkness already fell (and Amalia was born on a Sunday), the flag day was postponed until the next day.

==Flags of current countries in the Kingdom of the Netherlands==
===Flag of Aruba===
The national flag of Aruba was officially adopted on 18 March 1976. The blue field represents the sky, the sea, peace, hope, Aruba&#x27;s future and its ties to the past. The two narrow stripes &quot;suggest the movement toward status aparte&quot;. One represents &quot;the flow of tourists to sun-drenched Aruba, enriching the island as well as vacationers&quot;, the other &quot;industry, all the minerals (gold and phosphates in the past, petroleum in the early 20th century)&quot;. In addition to sun, gold, and abundance, the yellow is also said to represent wanglo flowers. The star has particularly complex symbolism. It is vexillologically unusual in having four points, representing the four cardinal directions. These refer in turn to the many countries of origin of the people of Aruba. They also represent the four main languages of Aruba: Papiamento, Spanish, English, and Dutch. The star also represents the island itself: a land of often red soil bordered by white beaches in a blue sea. The red also represents blood shed by Arubans during war, past Indian inhabitants, patriotic love, and Brazil wood. The white also represents purity and honesty.

===Flag of Curaçao===
The flag of Curaçao is a navy blue field with a horizontal hot yellow stripe slightly below the midline and two white, five-pointed stars in the canton. The blue symbolises the sea and sky (the bottom and top blue sections, respectively) divided by a yellow stroke representing the bright sun which bathes the island. The two stars represent Curaçao and Klein Curaçao, but also &#x27;Love &amp; Happiness&#x27;. The five points on each star symbolise the five continents from which Curaçao&#x27;s people come.

===Flag of Sint Maarten===
The flag of Sint Maarten is the national flag of the Dutch part of Saint Martin island, which is a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It was adopted on 13 June 1985. It resembles the war flag of the Philippines.

==Flags of former countries in the Kingdom of the Netherlands==

=== Suriname ===
The pre-independence flag of Suriname consisted of five coloured stars (from top left clockwise: white, black, brown, yellow, and red) connected by an ellipse. The coloured stars represent the major ethnic groups that comprise the Surinamese population: the original Amerindians, the colonising Europeans, the Africans brought in as slaves to work in plantations and the Indians, Javanese and Chinese who came as indentured workers to replace the Africans who escaped slavery and settled in the hinterland. The ellipse represents the harmonious relationship amongst the groups.

===Netherlands Antilles===

Within the flag of the Netherlands Antilles, there were five stars that symbolise the five islands that made up the country. While the colours red, white and blue refer to the flag of the Netherlands. A six-star version was used until 1986 when Aruba became its own country within the Kingdom. This original version was adopted on 19 November 1959.
This flag fell into disuse when the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved on 10 October 2010.
The islands of Sint Maarten and Curaçao obtained their separate country status within the Kingdom and the islands Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba are now overseas entities of the Netherlands.

==Flags of former colonies of the Kingdom of the Netherlands==

=== Dutch West India Company ===

==== New Holland (Brazil) ====
The flag of Dutch Brazil, or New Holland, also known as the flag of Dutch Brazil, was the flag used by the Vereenigde West-Indische Compagnie (English: Dutch West India Company) for the territories that were under its control in Brazil from 1630 until 1654.

The flag consists of three horizontal stripes in the colours of the flag of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands (red, white and blue) and it displays a monogram on the central stripe and a crown on the upper stripe, both gold-coloured. The origin of the monogram as well as its initials and its meaning is not known.

==== New Netherland (United States) ====
The orange-white-blue Prince&#x27;s Flag directly inspired historical and modern day flags in the former Dutch colony of New Netherland in what is today the East Coast of the United States. The colony of New Netherland used the Statenvlag of the Dutch Republic, and was one of the territories under control of the Dutch West India Company. The flag of New York City, originally called New Amsterdam, was designed after the Prince&#x27;s Flag. Furthermore, the flags of other counties, cities, and institutions in this region are designed after the Prince&#x27;s Flag, such as Albany (originally Beverwijck), Schenectady County, New York, and Jersey City.

=== Dutch East India Company ===

====Netherlands East Indies====
For the majority of the existence of the Netherlands East Indies the flag of the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (English: Dutch East India Company) was used. When the VOC became bankrupt and was formally dissolved in 1800, its possessions and debt were taken over by the government of the Batavian Republic. The VOC&#x27;s territories became the Netherlands East Indies and were expanded over the course of the 19th century to include the whole of the Indonesian archipelago. As such, the flag of the Batavian Republic and Kingdom of the Netherlands were used.

The flag of the Netherlands has been said to be the origin of the Indonesian flag. To symbolise the intention of forcing out the Dutch, the Indonesian nationalists would rip apart the Dutch flag. They tore off the bottom third of the flag, and separated the red and white colours from the blue colour.

====Netherlands New Guinea====

The Morning Star flag () represented the Netherlands New Guinea from 1 December 1961 until 1 October 1962 when the territory came under administration of the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority (UNTEA). The flag is commonly used by the West Papuan population including OPM (; Free Papua Movement) supporters to rally self-determination human rights support and is popularly flown on 1 December each year in defiance of Indonesian domestic laws. The flag consists of a red vertical band along the hoist side, with a white five-pointed star in the centre. The flag was first raised on 1 December 1961 and used until the United Nations became the territory&#x27;s administrator on 1 October 1962.

==== South Africa ====
The flag of the Boer Republics, Transvaal, the Orange Free State, Natalia Republic, and the flag of South Africa from 1928 to 1994 are all based on the flag of the Netherlands, or its predecessor the Prince&#x27;s Flag. These were in turn part of the inspiration for the present South African flag.

==Other related flags==
As the Prince&#x27;s Flag was the first created tricolour flag, it (in)directly inspired many historical and modern day tricolour flags. The flags below are directly influenced by the Dutch flag, or its predecessors, in colour use and design as a result of a shared history (as flags of former colonies) or economic relations, which is the case for the Russian flag. See the flags in the former colonies section above for more examples.

===Dutch flag-inspired===
The modern red-white-blue Dutch flag is the oldest tricolour flag in use, and directly inspired these historical and modern day flags:

* The design of the French flag was adopted after the French Revolution, where the revolutionaries were influenced by the horizontally striped red-white-blue flag of the Netherlands.
* The flag of Hesse-Nassau is identical to that of the Netherlands. The Dutch royal house originates from the Duchy of Nassau.
* The flag of Nimba County, Liberia similar to the Dutch flag, superimposed with Liberian flag in the canton.
* The flag of Labuan and flag of Johor Bahru in Malaysia similar to the Dutch flag, with a crescent and star in the centre.
* The flag of Chin National Front in Myanmar similar to the Dutch flag, with two hornbills in the centre.

====Pan-Slavic colours====

The Russian flag in turn is believed to have influenced many flags of other Slavic countries, resulting in many red-white-blue styled tribands in other parts of Europe, and also the red-white-green flag of Bulgaria. Peter the Great of Russia was building a new Russian Navy mostly on Dutch standards; therefore the merchant flag of Russia at sea would be the inverted colours of the Dutch flag.

===Prince&#x27;s Flag-inspired===
The orange-white-blue Prince&#x27;s Flag directly inspired many historical and modern day flags. Especially flags in the former colonies of New Netherland and South Africa are designed after this flag. See the flags in the former colonies section above for more examples.

===Cross of Burgundy-inspired===

* The flag of Shanghai Municipal Council in Shanghai International Settlement included multiple flags to symbolize the countries that had participated in the creation and management of this enclave in the Chinese city of Shanghai. The Dutch flag was put along with old Swedish civil ensign (spread vertically), the Austrian flag and old Spanish merchant ensign around the lower shield; all of them were upside down.

<text>Year 410 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Mamercinus and Volusus (or, less frequently, year 344 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;).

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* Commanding 20 ships, the Athenian generals Theramenes and Thrasybulus collaborate with Alcibiades and the main Athenian fleet in inflicting a major defeat on the Spartan navy commanded by Mindarus and its supporting Persian land army near Cyzicus on the shore of the Propontis (Sea of Marmara). As a result of its victory in the Battle of Cyzicus, Athens regains control over the vital grain route from the Black Sea.
* Alcibiades installs a garrison at Chrysopolis under Theramenes to exact a tithe from all shipping that comes from the Black Sea. This revenue enables the Athenians to put an end to the regime of the Five Thousand and restore their traditional institutions in full. Democracy is restored in Athens. The new demagogue Cleophon dismisses peace overtures made by Sparta.
* An Oligarchic revolt in Corcyra is unsuccessful.

==== Cyprus ====
* Evagoras re-establishes his family&#x27;s claim as kings of Salamis which has been under Phoenician control for a number of years.

=== By subject ===
==== Art ====
* A relief decoration from the parapet (now destroyed), &quot;Nike (Victory) adjusting her sandal&quot; is constructed in the Temple of Athena Nike on the Acropolis in Athens and is ready in 407 BC. It is now preserved at the Acropolis Museum in Athens.
* The grave stele of Hegeso is made and is finished about ten years later (approximate date). It is now preserved at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* June 9 – The democracy of Athens is overthrown by the oligarchic extremists, Antiphon, Theramenes, Peisander and Phrynichus in an effort by the oligarchists to exert more control over the conduct of the war with Sparta and its allies. A &quot;Council of Four Hundred&quot; is set up. The total defeat of the Athenian expedition to Sicily and the consequent revolts of many of the subject-allies has weakened Athenian finances severely; the acknowledged purpose of the revolutionary movement is to revise the constitution to better run Athens&#x27; finances. However, its rule is high-handed and the Council of Four Hundred is only able to maintain itself for four months.
* When a mutiny breaks out amongst the troops who are fortifying Piraeus (the harbour for Athens), the Council sends Theramenes to quell it. Instead, he puts himself at the head of the mutineers. After Phrynichus, the leader of the extremists, is assassinated, an ensuing meeting of the Athenian Assembly deposes the Council and restores the traditional constitution, but restricts some of the privileges of citizenship to a body called &quot;the Five Thousand&quot;. The Assembly resumes its old form in being a committee of all citizens.
* The Athenian navy under Thrasybulus recalls Alcibiades from Sardis. Alcibiades&#x27; election is confirmed by the Athenians at the request of Theramenes. A Spartan fleet in the Hellespont at Cynossema is then defeated by an Athenian fleet commanded by Thrasybulus and Alcibiades.
* Antiphon defends himself in a speech Thucydides describes as the greatest ever made by a man on trial for his life. Nevertheless, Antiphon is unable to persuade his accusers and he is executed for treason.

=== By topic ===
==== Literature ====
* Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot; is performed.
* Aristophanes&#x27; plays &quot;Lysistrata&quot; and &quot;Women Celebrating the Thesmophoria&quot; are performed.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
== Births ==
* Timoleon, Greek statesman and general (approximate date) (d. 337 BC)

=== By place ===
==== Persian Empire ====
* The Persians under Darius II see their opportunity to play off one Greek city-state against another and to recover control of the Greek cities of Asia Minor, which have been under Athenian control since 449 BC. The satraps of Asia Minor, Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus, are ordered to collect overdue tribute.
* The Spartans sign a treaty of mutual help with the Persian satrap of Lower Asia, Tissaphernes. By the treaty of Miletus, Persia is given complete freedom in western Asia Minor in return for agreeing to pay for seamen to man the Peloponnesian fleet.

==== Greece ====
* Alcibiades helps stir up revolts amongst Athens&#x27; allies in Ionia, on the west coast of Asia Minor. However, Alcibiades loses the confidence of the Spartans and antagonises their king Agis II. As a result, he flees to the court of the Persian satrap Tissaphernes. Alcibiades advises Tissaphernes to withdraw his support from Sparta while conspiring with the oligarchic party in Athens, as Sparta&#x27;s allied cities break away in a series of revolts.
* The Athenians vote to use their last reserves to build a new fleet.
* Clazomenae revolts against Athens. After a brief resistance, however, it again acknowledges the Athenian supremacy.
* An epidemic of an unknown disease hits Northern Greece.

==== Rome ====
* The epidemic hits the Roman Republic and causes a food shortage.

<doc id="70753" wikidata="Q472753" url="?curid=70753" title="Akhal-Teke">
<text>The Akhal-Teke ( or ; from Turkmen &quot;Ahalteke&quot;, ) is a Turkmen horse breed. They have a reputation for speed and endurance, intelligence, thin manes and a distinctive metallic sheen. The shiny coat of the breed led to their nickname, &quot;Golden Horses&quot;. These horses are adapted to severe climatic conditions and are thought to be one of the oldest existing horse breeds. There are currently about 6,600 Akhal-Tekes in the world, mostly in Turkmenistan, although they are also found throughout Europe and North America. Akhal is the name of the line of oases along the north slope of the Kopet Dag mountains in Turkmenistan. It has been inhabited by the Teke tribe of Turkmens.

There are several theories regarding the original ancestry of the Akhal-Teke, some dating back thousands of years. The Akhal Teke is probably a descendant of an older breed known as the Turkoman horse, and some claim it is the same breed. The tribes of Turkmenistan selectively bred the horses, recording their pedigrees orally and using them for raiding. The breed was used in the losing fight against the Russian Empire and was subsumed into the Empire along with its country. The Turkoman has influenced many other breeds, including modern warmbloods, and recent research confirms that Turkoman stallions made significant contributions to the development of the Thoroughbred. However, there also exists the possibility that all Akhal-Tekes today have a Thoroughbred sire line. The studbook was closed in 1932. The Soviet Union printed the first breed registry in 1941, including over 700 horses.

==History==

The ancestors of the breed may date back to animals living 3,000 years ago, known by a number of names. The precise ancestry is difficult to trace, however, because prior to about 1600 AD, horse breeds in the modern sense did not exist; rather, horses were identified by local strain or type.

The breed is very similar to, and possibly the direct descendant of the Turkoman horse, a breed believed to be extinct, though a related strain may be bred today in Iran. Other breeds or strains with Turkoman roots also include the Yomud, the Goklan, and the Nokhorli. Some historians believe that these are different strains of the same breed. Other ancient strains that may have contributed to the breed included those named the Massaget and Parthian. There&#x27;s also claims that Akhal-Teke horse is the descendant of the original Fergana horse which was breed in Fergana valley in 104 BC.

It remains a disputed &quot;chicken or egg&quot; question whether the influential Arabian was the ancestor of the Turkoman or was developed out of that breed, but current DNA evidence points to a possible common ancestor for both. A substantial number of Arabian mares were reportedly used to improve the breed in the 14th and 19th century. It is also possible that the so-called &quot;hot blooded&quot; breeds, the Arabian, Turkoman, Akhal-Teke, and the Barb all developed from a single &quot;oriental horse&quot; predecessor.

Tribal people in what today is Turkmenistan first used the Akhal-Teke for raiding. The horses were their most treasured possession since they were crucial for income and survival. They selectively bred their horses, keeping records of the pedigrees via an oral tradition. Horses were managed and trained in very specific ways. Stallions were tethered next to the tent while mares and foals were free to seek forage. The stallions were covered from head to tail with up to seven layers of felt, which kept their coat short and shiny. Before raids they were put on a sparse diet to prepare them for the long ride through the desert with no water and hardly any feed. The horses were called &quot;Argamaks&quot; (divine or Sacred Horses) by the Russians and heavenly horses by ancient China, and were cherished by those who valued their speed and stamina in the desert and loyalty to their owner. Han emperors from China waged two expeditions to secure the &quot;heavenly horses&quot;. And the access to these horse breeds fueled the success in China&#x27;s future campaign against their nomadic neighbors.
In 1881, Turkmenistan became part of the Russian Empire.
The tribes fought with the tsar, eventually losing. In the process, however, the Russian general Kuropatkin developed a fondness for horses he had seen while fighting the tribesmen, founded a breeding farm after the war and renamed the horses, &quot;Akhal-Tekes&quot;, after the Teke Turkmen tribe that lived around the Akhal oasis (near Geok Tepe). The Russians closed the studbook in 1932 which included 287 stallions and 468 mares. Stallions are not gelded in Central Asia. The studbook was printed in 1941.

The ancestral Akhal-Teke has had influence on many breeds, possibly including the Thoroughbred; the Byerly Turk, which may have been an Arabian, or a Turkoman Horse, was one of the three major foundation stallions of the breed. Three other stallions thought to be of Turkoman origin, known as the &quot;Lister Turk&quot;, the &quot;White Turk&quot;, and the &quot;Yellow Turk&quot; were among a number of minor stallions from the orient who contributed to the foundation bloodstock of the Thoroughbred breed. The Trakehner has also been influenced by the Akhal-Teke, most notably by the stallion, Turkmen-Atti, as have the Russian breeds Don, Budyonny, Karabair, and Karabakh.

The breed suffered greatly when the Soviet Union required horses to be slaughtered for meat, even though local Turkmen refused to eat them. At one point only 1,250 horses remained and export from the Soviet Union was banned. The government of Turkmenistan now uses the horses as diplomatic presents as well as auctioning a few to raise money for improved horse breeding programs.

In the early 20th century, crossbreeding between the Thoroughbred and the Akhal-Teke took place, aiming to create a faster long-distance racehorse. The Anglo Akhal-Tekes were not so resilient however, as their Akhal-Teke ancestors, and many died due to the harsh conditions of Central Asia. After the endurance race from Ashkabad to Moscow in 1935, when the purebreds finished in much better condition than the part-breds, the studbook management decided to consider all crossbred horses born after 1936, as not purebred. Horses with English Thoroughbred ancestors born prior to that date were allowed to remain inside the studbook (e.g. 044 Tillyakush, grandson of Thoroughbred Burlak; 831 Makh, granddaughter of Thoroughbred Blondelli of the St. Simon line and great-great-granddaughter of Thoroughbred Junak; and line founder 9 Ak Belek, a direct descendant in the male line of the Thoroughbred stallion Fortingbrass, by Fogabal of the Sir Hercules line). Due to this fact, there does not exist any Akhal-Teke today whose ancestry does not contain a Thoroughbred. Since 1973, all foals must be blood typed to be accepted in the stud book in order to protect the integrity of the breed. From 2014 on, a DNA test based on hair follicles is sufficient if the DNA of the parents is on file. A stallion not producing the right type of horse may be removed. Nowadays, artificial insemination is allowed as well as embryo transfer. The surrogate mother, however, needs to be a pureblood Akhal-Teke mare for the foal to be registered in the General Studbook as a pureblood Akhal-Teke.
Akhal-Teke horses are bred all over the world. In addition to Turkmenistan there are breeders in Russia and Central Asia, Europe, the US, Uruguay, and Australia.

=== Turkmenistan ===

Turkmenistan has a separate agency, Turkmen Atlary, responsible for the breeding, training and maintenance of Akhal-Teke horses. However, the agency&#x27;s work has been the focus of criticism from the President of the country, who holds the agency responsible for decreasing numbers of horses and inadequate facilities for their breeding, training and management. At present Akhal-Teke horses in Turkmenistan are not registered with any other studbook. The main reason for this are allegations of a heavy infusion of Thoroughbred blood into the breed to create faster horses for racing in Turkmenistan. There are estimates that as many as 30% of the horses in the Ashgabat hippodrome were not purebred.

When the first horse minister of newly independent Turkmenistan, Geldy Kyarizov, a lifelong advocate for the Akhal-Teke and former chair of the International Association of Akhal-Teke Breeders, began utilizing DNA to establish an Akhal-Teke studbook, he uncovered the pattern of adding in Thoroughbred blood. His decision to go public with this information was viewed as a threat to the profits of the horse-breeding establishment and he fell out of favor with the Turkmenistan government, and in particular, then-President Saparmurat Niyazov.
He was charged with abuse of office and negligence in 2002, convicted and sentenced to six years in prison. He was ultimately pardoned in October 2007, when Niyazov died and his successor, Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, took control of the country. By 2012, Kyarizov&#x27;s health, which had been poor since his arrest and subsequent imprisonment, had deteriorated to the point he needed to go abroad for medical care, but was initially prevented from leaving the country. By 2015, he was allowed to travel to Moscow for medical care, but family members, including his 14-year-old daughter, were forced to remain behind to &quot;guarantee&quot; his return. In September 2015, the entire family was allowed to leave.

Turkmen Atlary, in its capacity as the administrative arm of the International Akhal-Teke Horse Association, hosts a meeting of the association once or twice a year upon invitation in Ashgabat. Most of the bigger breeding farms and national Akhal Teke associations as well as Akhal Teke owners and representatives of the horse industry from around the world attend. There is a horse racing organization called &quot;Galkinysh&quot; . In Ashgabat, the Ahalteke equestrian complex, one of the largest in Central Asia, is a horse-breeding center. The former Akhal-Teke horse Holiday, celebrated on the last Sunday in April, has been renamed &#x27;Turkmen Horse Day&#x27;.

== Characteristics ==

The Akhal-Teke is of medium size, usually standing some 144 to at the withers, with a weight between 430 and Coat colors vary widely: the most frequent are bays (about 40%), duns (about 22%), blacks (about 12%) and chestnuts (about 11%); other colors include grey, cream and yellow. The coat often has a characteristic metallic sheen, which in duns may produce an unusual golden effect; it is sometimes claimed that this provided camouflage in the desert.

The Akhal-Teke has a refined head with predominantly a straight or slightly convex profile, and long ears. It can also have almond-shaped or &quot;hooded&quot; eyes. The mane and tail are usually sparse. The long back is lightly muscled, and is coupled to a flat croup and long, upright neck. The Akhal-Teke possess sloping shoulders and thin skin.
The breed is tough and resilient, having adapted to the harshness of Turkmenistan lands, where horses must live without much food or water. This has also made the horses good for sport. The breed is known for its endurance, as shown in 1935 when a group of Turkmen riders rode the from Ashgabat to Moscow in 84 days, including a three-day crossing of of desert without water. The Akhal-Teke is also known for its form and grace as a show jumper.

The quality of the Akhal-Teke horses are determined by the studbook manager. Depending on type, conformation, pedigree, quality of offspring and achievement in sport, the horses are designated as either Elite or Class I or Class II. There are usually 2 annual grading events in Moscow, Russia called the &quot;International Sport Meeting and World Championship “Heavenly Argamak” and &quot;Golden Akhal-Teke Cup Shael&quot; where breeders present their best horses to a group of judges. At the World Championship, a group of judges evaluates the horses in age and gender categories as well as in various sport disciplines and a halter class.

==Uses==
The Akhal-Teke, due to its natural athleticism, can be a sport horse, good at dressage, show jumping, eventing, racing, and endurance riding. A noted example was the Akhal-Teke stallion, &quot;Absent&quot;, who won the Grand Prix de Dressage at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, while being ridden by Sergei Filatov. He went again with Filatov to win the bronze individual medal in Tokyo in the 1964 Summer Olympics, and won the Soviet team gold medal under Ivan Kalita at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. However, by today&#x27;s studbook standards he wouldn&#x27;t be admitted as Akhal-Teke, owing to the Thoroughbred ancestry of his dam Bakkara.

In 2009, an Akhal-Teke named Almila carried the French poet Laurence Bougault on a trek alone from Isfahan in Iran to Paris by way of Turkey, Greece and Italy. Her trip covered 6,500 kilometres (4,000 mi) in less than six months.

==Genetic diseases==

There are several genetic diseases of concern to Akhal-Teke breeders. The genetic diversity of the breed is relatively low with an AVK (Ancestor Loss Coefficient ) of 30-50%, which raises concerns for dealing with an increase in carriers of these conditions, and even some risk of inbreeding depression. To date, there are no DNA tests for these conditions.

* &quot;Naked Foal Syndrome&quot; or &quot;Hairless Foal Syndrome&quot; is believed to be a monogenic autosomal, lethal recessive gene in the Akhal-Teke breed. Foals with this condition have been reported since 1938. Research at the University of Bern in Switzerland is ongoing to develop a DNA test for the condition. It appears to be similar in clinical signs, though not identical to, junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) found in the Belgian horse and another condition of a similar nature identified in the American Saddlebred. The defect causes foals to be born without any hair coat, mane or tail. In some cases, the front teeth are in at birth or molars grow abnormally from normal jaws. Other symptoms include persistent diarrhea, frequent digestive disorders, and laminitis-like, treatment-resistant rotation of the coffin bones in the hooves. Due to the lack of normal skin protection, secondary symptoms include scaly, dry, and inflamed skin, as well as severe cases of sunburn in summer, and frequent pulmonary infections during winter. NFS is always fatal; most foals die within weeks of birth, although some horses have survived up to the age of two years. Early demise is usually caused by digestive problems, whereas older horses need to be humanely euthanized because of severe laminitis-induced pain. Some carriers have been identified, including 943 Arslan, 736 Keymir, 2001 Mariula, or 1054 Gilkuyruk, but the estimated number of unknown cases is likely higher, as several Russian and Turkmenian breeders have acknowledged that NFS foals are often just reported as stillborn or aborted.
* &quot;Hereditary cryptorchidism&quot; exists within the Akhal-Teke breed and affected stallions can be traced through multiple generations. The influential foundation sire, 2a Boinou was a cryptorchid according to experts of the breed. Other verified cryptorchids include 779 Peren, 1248 Orlan, 971 Khalif, Sayvan, Saburbek, and Garayusup. 1069 Kortik produced a cryptorchid. Unlike many European and North American breed organisations, neither Russia nor Turkmenistan bar cryptorchids from breeding. Cryptorchidism is said to be related to health and behavior problems. Affected horses are more expensive to castrate. There are no studbook regulations related to the use of cryptorchid stallions. Breeders balance the risk of cryptorchidism against propagating other desirable qualities. Some national Akhal Teke associations, however, ban Cryptorchidism from breeding.
* The Akhal-Teke is one of many light riding horse breeds that may be prone to cervical vertebral malformation (CVM), commonly called &quot;Wobbler syndrome&quot;, and to Degenerative suspensory ligament desmitis (DSLD). These conditions are seen in a number of other breeds, including the Thoroughbred. There is likely a genetic component to Wobbler&#x27;s, but the mechanism has not been clearly identified. There also is a possible connection to Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD).

== Commemorations ==

In different cities of Turkmenistan are monuments to the Akhal-Teke. The largest number of sculptures is located in Ashgabat. Akhal-Tekes are represented in the official emblem and banknotes of Turkmenistan, as well as on stamps of Turkmenistan and other countries.

&quot;Art of Akhal-Teke horse breeding and traditions of horses’ decoration&quot; were recognized as part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. This recognition occurred during the 18th session of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2023. The nomination celebrates the unique cultural significance of these practices, deeply rooted in Turkmenistan&#x27;s heritage.

==== Greece ====
* After suffering a defeat in which the Athenian commander Lamachus is killed, Demosthenes suggests that they immediately give up the siege of Syracuse and return to Athens, where they are needed to defend against a Spartan invasion of Attica. Nicias refuses, but the Syracusans and Spartans under Hermocrates are able to trap the Athenians in the harbour and the Athenians sustain heavy losses in the Battle of Syracuse. Demosthenes is ambushed by the Syracusans and is forced to surrender. Nicias is soon captured as well, and both are executed, with most of the surviving Athenian soldiers sent to work in the Sicilian quarries. Ten &quot;proboulos&quot; (including Sophocles) are elected to help run Athens.
* Tissaphernes, the Persian satrap of Lydia and Caria, forms an alliance with Sparta. The Spartans, with strategic advice from Alcibiades and limited assistance from the Persians under Pharnabazus, advance almost to the gates of Athens. King Agis II leads the Spartan force that occupies Decelea in Attica.
* Archelaus I becomes King of Macedonia following the death of his father, King Perdiccas II. Archelaus seizes the throne after murdering his uncle, his cousin, and his half brother, the legitimate heir.

<doc id="70756" wikidata="Q223839" url="?curid=70756" title="Larry Flynt">
<text>Larry Claxton Flynt Jr. (; November 1, 1942 – February 10, 2021) was an American publisher and the president of Larry Flynt Publications (LFP). LFP mainly produces pornographic magazines, such as &quot;Hustler&quot;, pornographic videos, and three pornographic television channels named Hustler TV. Flynt fought several high-profile legal battles involving the First Amendment, and unsuccessfully ran for public office. He was paralyzed from the waist down due to injuries sustained in a 1978 attempted assassination by serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin. In 2003, &quot;Arena&quot; magazine listed him at No. 1 on the &quot;50 Powerful People in Porn&quot; list.

== Early life ==
Flynt was born in Lakeville, Magoffin County, Kentucky, the first of three children of Larry Claxton Flynt Sr. (1919–2005), a sharecropper, and Edith (née Arnett; 1925–1982), a homemaker. He had two younger siblings: sister Judy (1947–1951) and brother Jimmy Ray Flynt (born 1948). His father served in the United States Army in the European theatre of World War II. Due to his father&#x27;s absence, Flynt was raised solely by his mother and maternal grandmother for the first three years of his life. Flynt was raised in poverty, and said Magoffin County was the poorest county in the nation during the Great Depression. In 1951, Flynt&#x27;s sister, Judy, died of leukemia at age four. The death provoked his parents&#x27; divorce one year later; Flynt was then raised by his mother in Hamlet, Indiana, and his brother, Jimmy, was raised by his maternal grandmother in Magoffin County. Two years later, Flynt returned to live in Magoffin County with his father because he disliked his mother&#x27;s new boyfriend.

Flynt attended Salyersville High School (now Magoffin County High School) in the ninth grade. However, he ran away from home and, despite being only 15 years old, joined the United States Army using a counterfeit birth certificate. It was around that time that he developed a passion for the game of poker. After being honorably discharged, Flynt returned to his mother in Indiana and found employment at the Inland Manufacturing Company, an affiliate of General Motors. However, there was a union-led slowdown and he was laid off after only three months. He then returned to his father in Kentucky. For a brief period, he became a bootlegger but stopped when he learned that county deputies were searching for him. After living on his savings for two months, he enlisted in the United States Navy in July 1960. He became a radar operator on . He was the operator on duty when the ship was assigned to recover John Glenn&#x27;s space capsule. He was honorably discharged in July 1964.

==First enterprises==
In early 1965, Flynt took $1,800 (approx. $17,000 in 2022 when adjusted for inflation) from his savings and bought his mother&#x27;s bar in Dayton, Ohio, called the Keewee. He refitted it and was soon making $1,000 a week (approx. $9,300 in 2022); he used the profits to buy two other bars. He worked as many as 20 hours a day and took amphetamines to stay awake.

Flynt decided to open a new, higher-class bar, which would also be the first in the area to feature nude hostess dancers; he named it the Hustler Club. From 1968 onward, with the help of his brother Jimmy and later his girlfriend Althea Leasure, he opened Hustler Clubs in Akron, Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, and Toledo, Ohio. Soon each club grossed between $260,000 and $520,000 a year. He also acquired the Dayton franchise of a small newspaper called &quot;Bachelor&#x27;s Beat&quot;, which he published for two years before selling it. At the same time, he closed a money-losing vending-machine business.

==&quot;Hustler&quot; magazine==
In January 1972, Flynt created the &quot;Hustler Newsletter&quot;, a two-page, black-and-white publication about his clubs. This item became so popular with his customers that by May 1972, he expanded the &quot;Hustler Newsletter&quot; to 16 pages, then to 32 pages in August 1973. As a result of the 1973 oil crisis, the American economy entered recession and the revenues of Hustler Clubs declined. Flynt had to refinance his debts or declare bankruptcy. He decided to turn the &quot;Hustler Newsletter&quot; into a sexually explicit magazine with national distribution. He paid the start-up costs of the new magazine by deferring payment of sales taxes his clubs owed on their activities.

In July 1974, the first issue of &quot;Hustler&quot; was published. Although the first few issues went largely unnoticed, within a year the magazine became highly lucrative, and Flynt was able to pay his tax debts. Flynt&#x27;s friend Al Goldstein said that &quot;Hustler&quot; took its inspiration from his own tabloid &quot;Screw&quot;, but credited his comrade-in-arms with accomplishing what he had not: creating a national publication. In November 1974, &quot;Hustler&quot; showed the first &quot;pink-shots&quot;, or photos of open vulvas. Flynt had to fight to publish each issue. Many people, including some at his distribution company, found the magazine too explicit and threatened to remove it from the market. Shortly thereafter, Flynt was approached by a paparazzo who had taken pictures of former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis while she was sunbathing nude on vacation in 1971. He purchased them for $18,000 (approx. $98,000 in 2022) and published them in the August 1975 issue. That issue attracted widespread attention, and one million copies were sold within a few days. (Goldstein&#x27;s &quot;Screw&quot; magazine had previously published nude photos of Onassis in early 1973.) Now a millionaire, Flynt bought a $375,000 (approx. $2 million in 2022) mansion.

==Attempted assassination==

On March 6, 1978, during a legal battle related to obscenity in Gwinnett County, Georgia, Flynt and his lawyer were shot on the sidewalk in Lawrenceville by Joseph Paul Franklin. The shooting left Flynt partially paralyzed with permanent spinal cord damage, and in need of a wheelchair. Flynt&#x27;s attorney was seriously wounded. Flynt&#x27;s injuries caused him constant, excruciating pain, and he was addicted to painkillers until multiple surgeries deadened the affected nerves. He also had a stroke caused by one of several drug overdoses on his analgesic medication. He recovered, but had pronunciation difficulties thereafter.

=== Joseph Paul Franklin ===
Franklin, a militant white supremacist and serial killer, also shot Vernon Jordan; he targeted other black and Jewish people in a killing spree from 1977 to 1980. Violently opposed to &#x27;miscegenation,&#x27; he confessed to the shootings many years later, claiming he was outraged by an interracial photo shoot in &quot;Hustler&quot;. About Flynt and a &quot;Hustler&quot; pictorial, he stated, &quot;I saw that interracial couple ... having sex ... It just made me sick ... I threw the magazine down and thought, I&#x27;m gonna kill that guy.&quot; Flynt himself suspected the attack was part of a larger conspiracy involving ultra-right elements surrounding U.S. Representative Larry McDonald also behind the Karen Silkwood case with ties to the Intelligence Community and that Franklin may have been subject to MKULTRA-style mind control.

Franklin was never brought to trial for the attack on Flynt. Franklin was eventually charged in Missouri with eight unrelated counts of murder and sentenced to death. Flynt expressed his opposition to the death penalty and stated he did not want Franklin to be executed. Franklin was executed by lethal injection on November 20, 2013.

==Personal life and death==
Flynt was married five times; his wives were:
* Mary Flynt (1961–1965)
* Peggy Mathis (1966–1969)
* Kathy Barr (1970–1975)
* Althea Leasure (1976–1987)
* Elizabeth Berrios (1998–2021)
He married his fourth wife, Althea, in 1976, and they remained married for ten years until her death at age 33. Larry reported she had ARC (AIDS-related complex), but drowned in a bathtub in 1987. Toxicology reports were inconclusive. He married his fifth wife, Elizabeth Berrios, in 1998. Flynt had four daughters and a son, as well as many grandchildren. His daughter Lisa Flynt-Fugate died in a car crash in Ohio in October 2014 at age 47.

He said he was an evangelical Christian for one year, &quot;converted&quot; in 1977 by evangelist Ruth Carter Stapleton, the sister of Jimmy Carter. He said he became &quot;born again&quot; and that he had a vision from God while flying with Stapleton in his jet. He continued to publish his magazine, however, vowing to &quot;hustle for God&quot;. He later declared himself an atheist.

In 1994, Flynt bought a Gulfstream II private jet, which was used in the movie &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;. In 2005, he replaced it with a Gulfstream IV. At the time of his death, he resided in the Hollywood Hills.

Flynt said he had bipolar disorder.

Flynt died from heart failure in Los Angeles on February 10, 2021, at age 78.

==Flynt&#x27;s enterprises==

By 1970, he ran eight strip clubs throughout Ohio in Cincinnati, Toledo, Akron, and Cleveland.

In July 1974, Flynt first published &quot;Hustler&quot; as a step forward from the &quot;Hustler Newsletter&quot;, which was advertising for his businesses. The magazine struggled for the first year, partly because many distributors and wholesalers refused to handle it as its nude photos became increasingly graphic. It targeted working-class men and grew from a shaky start to a peak circulation of around three million. The publication of nude paparazzi pictures of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in August 1975 was a major coup. &quot;Hustler&quot; has often featured more explicit photographs than comparable magazines and has contained depictions of women that some find demeaning, such as a naked woman in a meat grinder or presented as a dog on a leash – though Flynt later said that the meat grinder image was a criticism of the pornography industry itself.
Flynt created his privately held company Larry Flynt Publications (LFP) in 1976. LFP published several other magazines and also controlled distribution of the various titles. LFP launched &quot;Ohio Magazine&quot; in 1977, and later its output included other mainstream work. LFP sold the distribution business, as well as several mainstream magazines, beginning in 1996. LFP started to produce pornographic movies in 1998, through the Hustler Video film studio, which purchased VCA Pictures in 2003. In 2014, Flynt said his print portfolio made up only 10% of his company&#x27;s revenue, and predicted the demise of &quot;Hustler&quot; due to competition from the Internet.

On June 22, 2000, Flynt opened the Hustler Casino, a card room located in the Los Angeles suburb of Gardena. Other ventures which were wholly owned or licensed by Flynt or are wholly owned or licensed by LFP, Inc. include the Hustler Clubs and the Hustler Hollywood Store. LFP also publishes &quot;Barely Legal&quot;, a pornographic magazine featuring young women who reportedly have recently turned 18, the minimum age for a person to appear in pornography in the US.

==Legal battles==
Flynt was embroiled in many legal battles regarding the regulation of pornography and free speech within the United States, especially attacking the &quot;Miller v. California&quot; (1973) obscenity exception to the First Amendment. He was first prosecuted on obscenity and organized crime charges in Cincinnati in 1976 by Simon Leis, who headed a local anti-pornography committee. He was given a sentence of 7–25 years in prison, but served only six days in jail; the sentence was overturned on appeal following allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, as well as judicial and jury bias. One argument resulting from this case was reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1981. Flynt made an appearance in a feature film based on the trial, &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot; (1996), playing the judge who sentenced him in the case.

Outraged by a derogatory cartoon published in &quot;Hustler&quot; in 1976, Kathy Keeton, then girlfriend of &quot;Penthouse&quot; publisher Bob Guccione, filed a libel suit against Flynt in Ohio. Her lawsuit was dismissed because she had missed the deadline under the statute of limitations. She then filed a new lawsuit in New Hampshire, where &quot;Hustler&quot;″s sales were very small. The question of whether she could sue there reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 1983, with Flynt losing the case. This case is occasionally reviewed today in first-year law school Civil Procedure courses, due to its implications regarding personal jurisdiction over a defendant.

During the proceedings in &quot;Keeton v. Hustler Magazine&quot;, Flynt shouted &quot;Fuck this court!&quot; and called the justices &quot;nine assholes and one token cunt&quot; (referring to Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor). Chief Justice Warren E. Burger had him arrested for contempt of court, but the charge was later dismissed.

Also in 1983, he leaked an FBI surveillance tape to the media regarding John DeLorean. In the videos, when arresting DeLorean, the FBI is shown asking him whether he would rather defend himself or have &quot;his daughter&#x27;s head smashed in&quot;. During the subsequent trial, Flynt wore a U.S. flag as a diaper and was jailed for six months for desecration of the flag.

In 1988, Flynt won a Supreme Court decision, &quot;Hustler Magazine v. Falwell&quot;, after being sued by Reverend Jerry Falwell in 1983, over an offensive ad parody in &quot;Hustler&quot; that suggested that Falwell&#x27;s first sexual encounter was with his mother in an outhouse. Falwell sued Flynt, citing &quot;emotional distress&quot; caused by the ad. The decision clarified that public figures cannot recover damages for &quot;intentional infliction of emotional distress&quot; based on parodies. After Falwell&#x27;s death, Flynt said despite their differences, he and Falwell had become friends over the years, adding, &quot;I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.&quot;

As a result of a sting operation in April 1998, Flynt was charged with a number of obscenity-related offenses concerning the sale of sex videos to a youth in a Cincinnati adult store he owned. In a plea agreement in 1999, LFP, Inc. (Flynt&#x27;s corporate holdings group) pleaded guilty to two counts of pandering obscenity and agreed to stop selling adult videos in Cincinnati.

In June 2003, prosecutors in Hamilton County, Ohio, attempted to revive criminal charges of pandering obscene material against Flynt and his brother Jimmy Flynt, charging that they had violated the 1999 agreement. Flynt said that he no longer had an interest in the Hustler Shops and that prosecutors had no basis for the lawsuit.

In January 2009, Flynt filed suit against two nephews, Jimmy Flynt II and Dustin Flynt, for the use of his family name in producing pornography. He regarded their pornography to be inferior. He prevailed on the main trademark infringement issue, but lost on invasion of privacy claims.

In May 2021, VICE News published and reported on a copy of Flynt&#x27;s 322-page FBI file, which the outlet obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. It contained details of his 1983 arrest for disrupting the U.S. Supreme Court during the &quot;Keeton&quot; hearing and the unconfirmed claim of a confidential informant that Flynt had asked mercenary Mitchell WerBell III to rig his wheelchair with C-4 explosives so he could blow himself up during that same hearing, taking all of the justices with him.

==Politics==
Flynt was a Democrat when Bill Clinton was president. In 2013, he said he was &quot;a civil libertarian to the core&quot;, though he once attempted a presidential run as a Republican in 1984. He was a staunch critic of the Warren Commission and offered $1 million for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the assassin of John F. Kennedy. In 2003, Flynt was a candidate in the recall election of California governor Gray Davis, calling himself a &quot;smut peddler who cares&quot;. He finished seventh in a field of 135 candidates with 17,458 votes (0.2%).

Flynt repeatedly weighed in on public debates by trying to expose conservative or Republican politicians with sexual scandals. He did so during the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton in 1998, offering $1 million for evidence and publishing the results in &quot;The Flynt Report&quot;. These publications led to the resignation of incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston. In 2007, Flynt repeated his $1 million offer and also wrote the foreword to Joseph Minton Amann and Tom Breuer&#x27;s &quot;The Brotherhood of Disappearing Pants: A field guide to conservative sex scandals&quot;, which contained some cases published by Flynt.

In 2003, Flynt purchased nude photographs of former PFC Jessica Lynch, who was captured by Iraqi forces, rescued from an Iraqi hospital by U.S. troops and celebrated as a hero by the media. He said he would never show any of the photographs, calling Lynch a &quot;good kid&quot; who became &quot;a pawn for the government&quot;. Flynt supported activist groups opposed to the war in Iraq in 2004 and 2005. He was a strong supporter of LGBT rights and same-sex marriage.

In 2012, Flynt offered a $1 million reward for information on Mitt Romney&#x27;s unreleased tax returns and ran two full-page ads in &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; to promote the offer.

Flynt endorsed Mark Sanford in the 2013 special election for South Carolina&#x27;s 1st congressional district, saying &quot;His open embrace of his mistress in the name of love, breaking his sacred marriage vows, was an act of bravery that has drawn my support.&quot;

In January 2015, following the attack on &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot;, Flynt criticized the American media for refusing to broadcast the caricatures of Mohammed from the satirical weekly.

In May 2015, Flynt endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. In an interview with &quot;Marfa Journal&quot; later that year, he described his political views as &quot;progressively liberal&quot;.

In October 2017, Flynt offered a $10 million reward for any evidence that would lead to the impeachment of President Donald Trump. A 2019 Christmas card from Larry Flynt Publications, sent to several Republican congressmen, depicted Trump&#x27;s assassination.

== Allegations of incest, misogyny, and racism ==
Flynt&#x27;s daughter, Tonya Flynt-Vega, accused him of sexually abusing her as a child. In the 1998 book, &quot;Hustled: My Journey from Fear to Faith&quot;, Flynt-Vega writes about her father showing her images from &quot;Hustler&quot; and while he did so, he began touching her, had her remove her bathing suit, assaulted her orally, then showed her his erection and tried to penetrate her. She writes, &quot;The pain was intense. I know I was hurt. Dad had not penetrated [me].&quot; She described an exchange with her father after he knew she planned to publish a book describing his abuses of her: &quot;He called me at work one day and said &#x27;If you don&#x27;t back-off that book, I&#x27;ll send somebody to wring your [expletive] neck.&#x27; ... He&#x27;s &#x27;Mr. Free Speech&#x27;, but he&#x27;s threatening to kill somebody for writing a book.&quot; Flynt denied his daughter&#x27;s accusation of sexual abuse on several occasions, but he did acknowledge he had not been a good parent to Flynt-Vega. &quot;She&#x27;s looking for attention, and she&#x27;s looking to get back at me, as her father, for not being there when she really needed me,&quot; he said in one response. In another interview, he stated, &quot;Anyone who knows me knows my sexual preference. It&#x27;s not children, especially my own.&quot;

&quot;Hustler&quot; cartoonist and humor editor Dwaine B. Tinsley created the comic feature called &quot;Chester the Molester&quot;. It was a monthly part of the magazine for 13 years. In the comic, the main character endeavors through various means to molest and otherwise sexually assault girls and women. In 1989, Tinsley was arrested, charged with molesting his daughter from age 13–18. Tinsley was convicted of that charge on January 5, 1990. His conviction was overturned in 1992 when an appeals court ruled that the jury should not have seen cartoons drawn by Tinsley. The prosecutor in the case ultimately decided not to retry Tinsley, who served 23 months of a six-year sentence. Flynt claims he did not ask Tinsley about the conviction and &quot;Chester the Molester&quot; cartoons drawn while in prison continued to appear in &quot;Hustler&quot;. He also defended Tinsley, calling him &quot;a genius&quot; and &quot;at one time in America in the Seventies and Eighties the most brilliant and recognized cartoonist in America.&quot;

In addition to child molestation, the rape of adult women is a common theme in many of his magazines, including &quot;Hustler&quot;. A photo pictorial titled &quot;The naked and the dead&quot;, depicted an imprisoned woman being forcibly shaved, sexually assaulted, raped, and electrocuted. In the January 1983 issue of &quot;Hustler&quot;, there was a photographic pictorial called &quot;Dirty pool&quot;. It depicted a woman on a pool table being sexually assaulted and gang raped by four men. In early March 1983, 21 year-old Cheryl Araujo was gang raped on a pool table by four men in New Bedford. At the time, some coverage took on xenophobic overtones, blaming the crime not only on the victim but on the Portuguese community as a whole. Flynt created a fake postcard featuring a naked woman on a pool table with the caption, &quot;Greetings from New Bedford, Massachusetts, the Portuguese gang-rape capital of America.&quot;

Criticizing the sanitizing scope of the 1996 film &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;, feminist Gloria Steinem detailed his depictions of misogyny: &quot;What&#x27;s left out [of the film] are the magazine&#x27;s images of women being beaten, tortured, and raped; women subject to degradations from bestiality to sexual slavery.&quot; Steinem also addressed what she saw as the hypocrisy of him being regarded as a protector of everyone&#x27;s free speech, noting &quot;other feminists and I have been attacked in &quot;Hustler&quot; for using our First Amendment rights to protest pornography.&quot; The film&#x27;s director, Miloš Forman, a native of the former Czechoslovakia, rebutted these and similar feminist critiques, stating that if he had used such extreme pornographic content, he would not have been able to make the film, which was rated &quot;R&quot;. Forman, whose parents were victims of the Nazis, said he made the movie &quot;out of admiration for the beauty and wisdom of the American Constitution, which allows this country to rise to its best when provoked by the worst&quot;. Others also viewed the film as historical revisionism, portraying a heroic Flynt. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted the &quot;magazine&#x27;s racist and anti-Semitic overtones – one &quot;Hustler&quot; cartoon showed a black man reaching for a watermelon on a giant mousetrap – is also nowhere to be found.&quot; His daughter Tonya also spoke out against the film.

In real life, Flynt did not shy away from rationalizing his publication of taboo content and humor, claiming that his goal was to &quot;offend every single person in this world at some point&quot;, and pointing out that &quot;If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me then it will protect all of you, because I&#x27;m the worst.&quot; He defended himself against allegations of misogyny, stating that he supported abortion rights, same-sex marriage and equality, while at the same time offering harsh assessments of his feminist critics and embracing the magazine&#x27;s crude, sometimes bigoted depictions.

Feminist author Laura Kipnis compared Flynt to the ribald, French Renaissance satirist Rabelais, saying that she saw &quot;Hustler&quot; &quot;as really dedicated to violating the proprieties that uphold class distinctions&quot;, and calling it &quot;one of the most class-antagonistic publications in the country&quot;.

<text>Year 415 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Cossus, Vibulanus, Volusus and Cincinnatus (or, less frequently, year 339 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 415 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* Athenian orator and politician, Andocides is imprisoned on suspicion of having taken part in the mutilation of the sacred busts called &quot;Hermae&quot; shortly before the departure of Athens&#x27; military expedition to Sicily. These mutilations cause a general panic, and Andocides is induced to turn informer. Andocides&#x27; testimony is accepted, and those whom he implicates, including Alcibiades, are condemned to death. Andocides is sent into exile.
* The Athenian expedition to Sicily sets sail under Nicias, Lamachus and Alcibiades. After his departure with the armada, Alcibiades is accused of profanity and is recalled to Athens to stand trial.
* After learning that he has been condemned to death &quot;in absentia&quot;, Alcibiades defects to Sparta and Nicias is placed in charge of the Sicilian expedition. The Athenian forces land at Dascon near Syracuse but with little result. Hermocrates heads the Syracusan defence.
* Alcibiades openly joins with the Spartans and persuades them to send Gylippus to assist Syracuse and to fortify Decelea in Attica. He also encourages Ionia to revolt against Athens. As a result, a Spartan fleet soon arrives to reinforce their allies in Syracuse and a stalemate ensues.

<text>The Union Jack or Union Flag is the &quot;de facto&quot; national flag of the United Kingdom. The Union Jack was also used as the official flag of several British colonies and dominions before they adopted their own national flags. The flag continues to have official status in Canada, by parliamentary resolution, where it is known as the Royal Union Flag. However, it is commonly referred to in Canada as the Union Jack.

It is sometimes asserted that the term &quot;Union Jack&quot; properly refers only to naval usage, but this assertion was dismissed by the Flag Institute in 2013 after historical investigations. The origins of the earlier flag of Great Britain date from 1606. King James VI of Scotland had inherited the English and Irish thrones in 1603 as James I, thereby uniting the crowns of England, Scotland, and Ireland in a personal union, although the three kingdoms remained separate states. On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the flag of England, a red cross on a white background, known as St George&#x27;s Cross, and the flag of Scotland, a white saltire (X-shaped cross, or St Andrew&#x27;s Cross) on a blue background, would be joined, forming the flag of England and Scotland for maritime purposes.

The present design of the flag dates from a royal proclamation following the union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. The flag combines aspects of three older national flags: the red cross of St George for the Kingdom of England, the white saltire of St Andrew for the Kingdom of Scotland and the red saltire of St Patrick to represent Ireland. Although the Republic of Ireland is no longer part of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland is. There are no symbols representing Wales in the flag, making Wales the only home nation with no direct representation, as at the time of the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 (creating legal union with England) the concept of national flags was in its infancy. The Welsh Dragon was, however, adopted as a supporter in the royal coat of arms of England used by the Tudor dynasty from 1485.

The flags of British Overseas Territories, as well as certain sovereign states and regions that were previously British possessions, incorporate the Union Jack into their own flag designs or have official flags that are derived from the Union Jack. Many of these flags are blue or red ensigns with the Union Jack in the canton and defaced with the distinguishing arms of the territory. The governors of British Overseas Territories and the Australian states also have personal standards that incorporate the Union Jack in their design.

==Terminology==
The terms &quot;Union Jack&quot; and &quot;Union Flag&quot; are both used historically for describing the national flag of the United Kingdom.

According to the website of the Parliament of the United Kingdom: Each kingdom had its own national flag for ships, but in 1606 James VI and I introduced a combined national flag. The UK Parliament website states &quot;The result was the Union Jack, Jack being a shortening of Jacobus, the Latin version of James&quot;.

The etymology of &quot;jack&quot; in the context of flagstaffs reaches back to Middle German. The suffix &quot;-kin&quot; was used in Middle Dutch and Middle German as a diminutive. Examples occur in both Chaucer and Langland though the form is unknown in Old English. &quot;John&quot; is a common male forename (going back to the Bible), appearing in Dutch as &quot;Jan&quot;. Both languages use it as a generic form for a man in general. The two were combined in the Middle Dutch , whence Middle French and Middle English . &quot;Jack&quot; came to be used to identify all manner of particularly small objects or small versions of larger ones. The OED has definition 21 &quot;Something insignificant, or smaller than the normal size&quot; and gives examples from 1530 to 2014 of this usage. Further examples in the compounds section at 2b illustrate this. The original maritime flag use of &quot;jack&quot; was &quot;A ship&#x27;s flag of a smaller size than the ensign, used at sea as a signal, or as an identifying device&quot;. The jack was flown in the bows or from the head of the spritsail mast to indicate the vessel&#x27;s nationality: &quot;You are alsoe for this present service to keepe in yor Jack at yor Boultspritt end and yor Pendant and yor Ordinance&quot; The Union Flag when instantiated as a small jack became known as the &quot;Union Jack&quot; and this later term transferred to more general usage of the Union Flag.

Also later a short flagpole was placed in the bows of a ship to fly the jack, this became known as the &quot;jackstaff&quot;.

According to the Flag Institute, a membership-run vexillological charity, &quot;the national flag of the United Kingdom, the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories is the Union Flag, which may also be called the Union Jack.&quot; The institute has also stated: Notwithstanding Their Lordships&#x27; circular of 1902, by 1913 the Admiralty described the &quot;Union Flag&quot; and added in a footnote that &#x27;A Jack is a Flag to be flown only on the &quot;Jack&quot; Staff&#x27;.

However, the authoritative &quot;A Complete Guide to Heraldry&quot; published in 1909 by Arthur Charles Fox-Davies uses the term &quot;Union Jack&quot;.

The term &quot;Union Flag&quot; is used in King Charles I&#x27;s 1634 proclamation:

 and in King George III&#x27;s proclamation of 1 January 1801 concerning the arms and flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland:

When the first flag representing Britain was introduced on the proclamation of King James I in 1606, it became known simply as the &quot;British flag&quot; or the &quot;flag of Britain&quot;. The royal proclamation gave no distinctive name to the new flag. At the funeral of King James in 1625 the flag was called the &quot;Banner of the Union of the two Crosses of England and Scotland&quot;. The word &quot;jack&quot; was in use before 1600 to describe the maritime bow flag. By 1627 a small Union Jack was commonly flown in this position. One theory goes that for some years it would have been called just the &quot;Jack&quot;, or &quot;Jack flag&quot;, or the &quot;King&#x27;s Jack&quot;, but by 1674, while formally referred to as &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Jack&quot;, it was commonly called the &quot;Union Jack&quot;, and this was officially acknowledged.

A proclamation issued by King George III at the time of the Union of 1801 concerned flags at sea and repeatedly referred to &quot;Ensigns, Flags, Jacks, and Pendants&quot; and forbade merchant vessels from wearing &quot;Our Jack, commonly called the Union Jack&quot; nor any pendants or colours used by the King&#x27;s ships. Reinforcing the distinction the King&#x27;s proclamation of the same day concerning the arms and flag of the United Kingdom (not colours at sea) called the new flag &quot;the Union Flag&quot;.

The size and power of the Royal Navy internationally at the time could also explain why the flag was named the &quot;Union Jack&quot;; considering the navy was so widely utilised and renowned by the United Kingdom and colonies, it is possible that the term &quot;jack&quot; occurred because of its regular use on all British ships using the jackstaff (a flag pole attached to the bow of a ship). The name may alternatively come from the &#x27;jack-et&#x27; of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603. Even if the term &quot;Union Jack&quot; does derive from the jack flag, after three centuries, it is now sanctioned by use and has appeared in official use, confirmed as the national flag by Parliament and remains the popular term.

Winston Churchill, British Prime Minister from 1940 to 1945, referred to the flag of the United Kingdom as the Union Jack. In March 1899, Churchill wrote to his mother from India about her plans to produce a new trans-Atlantic magazine, to be called &quot;The Anglo-Saxon Review&quot;. The drawing at the end of this letter was deliberately facetious, teasing her for going down-market, and in the accompanying letter he wrote, &quot;Your title &#x27;The Anglo Saxon&#x27; with its motto &#x27;Blood is thicker than water&#x27; only needs the Union Jack &amp; the Star Spangled Banner crossed on the cover to be suited to one of Harmsworth&#x27;s cheap Imperialist productions.&quot;

More recently, Reed&#x27;s &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot; (1990 edition) unambiguously stated: &quot;The Union Flag, frequently but incorrectly referred to as the Union Jack, ...&quot; and later: &quot;8. The Jack – A small flag worn on a jackstaff on the stem of Naval Vessels. The Royal Navy wears the Union Flag ... This is the only occasion when it correct to describe the flag as the Union Jack&quot;. However, this assertion does not appear in any Reed&#x27;s &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot; since 1993. In the 2016 Reed&#x27;s &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot;, the only entry where this might appear, section 5.21, covering Flag Etiquette, does not include this statement. Within the &quot;Almanac&quot;, neither the Union Flag nor the Union Jack are included pictorially or mentioned by name.

For comparison with another anglophone country with a large navy, &quot;jack of the United States&quot; specifically refers to the flag flown from the jackstaff of a warship, auxiliary or other U.S. governmental entity.
The &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Apron&quot; is a pejorative term for the flag, common among Irish republicans, citing the blood-streaked appearance of the flag and referring to atrocities committed in Ireland and other countries under British colonial rule. In 2006, Sandra White, a Member of the Scottish Parliament, caused a furore when the term was used in a press release under her name. It was later blamed on the actions of a researcher, who resigned yet claimed that the comment had been approved by White. The Irish folk band the Wolfe Tones has a song entitled &quot;The Butcher&#x27;s Apron&quot; which makes reference to the term.

In the Chinese language, the flag has the nickname &quot;Rice-Character Flag&quot; (; Mandarin Pinyin: , Cantonese Jyutping: ), since the pattern looks like the Chinese character for &quot;rice&quot; ().
== Design ==
The current flag&#x27;s design has been in use since 1801. Its original blazon, as decreed by George III of the United Kingdom on 1 January 1801, reads: 
the Union flag shall be azure, the crosses-saltires of St. Andrew and St. Patrick quartered per saltire counter changed argent and gules; the latter fimbriated of the second [viz., argent]; surmounted by the cross of St. George of the third [viz., gules], fimbriated as the saltire [viz., argent].

===Specification===
The Union Jack is normally twice as long as it is tall, a ratio of 1:2. In the United Kingdom, land flags are normally a ratio of 3:5; the Union Jack can also be made in this shape, but is 1:2 for most purposes. In 2008, MP Andrew Rosindell proposed a Ten Minute Rule bill to standardise the design of the flag at 3:5, but the bill did not proceed past the first reading.

The three-component crosses that make up the Union Jack are sized as follows:
* The red St George&#x27;s Cross width is of the flag&#x27;s height with a flag height fimbriation
* The white diagonal St Andrew&#x27;s Cross width is of the flag&#x27;s height, visible on either side of the St Patrick&#x27;s Cross in diagonals of and of the flag&#x27;s height, respectively.
* The red diagonal St Patrick&#x27;s Cross width is of the flag&#x27;s height. It is offset by of the flag&#x27;s height in an anti-clockwise direction. According to the official blazon of 1801, the white diagonal St Andrew&#x27;s Cross is in fact counterchanged with the red diagonal of St Patrick&#x27;s Cross. In this interpretation, the width of both saltires is of the flag&#x27;s height, with fimbriations of of the flag&#x27;s height on either side of the red saltire.

The crosses and fimbriations retain their thickness relative to the flag&#x27;s &quot;height&quot; whether they are shown with a ratio of 3:5 or 1:2. &quot;Height&quot; here is the distance from top to bottom which in vexillology is termed width or breadth.

====Ratios====

The Admiralty in 1864 settled all official flags at proportions of 1:2, but the relative widths of the crosses remained unspecified, with the above conventions becoming standardised in the 20th century. In the 19th century, the Union flag was defined by the same blazon but could vary in its geometrical proportions.

Although the most common ratio is 1:2, other ratios exist. The Royal Navy&#x27;s flag code book, BR20 &quot;Flags of All Nations&quot;, states that both 1:2 and 3:5 versions are official. In the 3:5 version, the innermost points of the lower left and upper right diagonals of the St Patrick&#x27;s cross are cut off or truncated. The Garter King of Arms also suggests a ratio of 3:5 as the suitable proportion for a Union Flag flown on land.

The King&#x27;s Harbour Master&#x27;s flag, like the Pilot Jack, is a 1:2 flag that contains a white-bordered Union Flag that is longer than 1:2. The jacks of ships flying variants of the Blue Ensign are square and have a square Union Flag in the canton. The King&#x27;s Colours of Army regiments are ; on them, the bars of the cross and saltire are of equal width; so are their respective fimbriations, which are very narrow.

In South Africa, the Union Jacks flown alongside the National Flag between 1928 and 1957 were 2:3 flags.

===Colours===
Although the official design of the flag at the College of Arms does not specify colours beyond azure, argent and gules (blue, white and red, respectively), according to Graham Bartram (chief vexillologist of Flag Institute) the colours blue, red, and white are:

All HEX, CMYK and RGB specifications for the Pantone colours are taken from the official Pantone website on the webpages of the corresponding colours. Although these colour specifications are official, not all of the colours are completely congruent. This is due to different specifications for different types of media (for example, screen and print).

===Flying===

The flag does not have reflection symmetry due to the slight pinwheeling of the St Patrick&#x27;s and St Andrew&#x27;s crosses, technically the &quot;counterchange of saltires&quot;. Thus, there is a correct side up. It is one of two national flags with two-fold rotational symmetry, symmetry group C2, the other being the flag of Trinidad and Tobago. The original specification of the Union Flag in the royal proclamation of 1 January 1801 did not contain a drawn pattern or express which way the saltires should lie; they were simply &quot;counterchanged&quot; and the red saltire fimbriated. Nevertheless, a convention was soon established which accords most closely with the description. The flag was deliberately designed with the Irish saltire slightly depressed at the hoist end to reflect the earlier union with Scotland, giving as it were seniority to the Saint Andrew&#x27;s cross.

When statically displayed, the hoist is on the observer&#x27;s left. To fly the flag correctly, the white of St Andrew is &quot;above&quot; the red of St Patrick in the upper hoist canton (the quarter at the top nearest to the flag-pole). This is expressed by the phrases &quot;wide white top&quot; and &quot;broadside up&quot;. An upside-down flag must be &quot;turned over&quot; to be flown correctly; &quot;rotating it&quot; 180 degrees will still result in an upside-down flag.

The first drawn pattern for the flag was in a parallel proclamation on 1 January 1801, concerning civil naval ensigns, which drawing shows the red ensign (also to be used as a red jack by privateers). As it appears in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;, the broad stripe is where expected for three of the four quarters, but the upper left quarter shows the broad stripe below.

It is often stated that a flag upside down is a form of distress signal or even a deliberate insult. In the case of the Union Flag, the difference is subtle and is easily missed by the uninformed. It is often displayed upside down inadvertently—even on commercially-made hand waving flags.

On 3 February 2009, the BBC reported that the flag had been inadvertently flown upside-down by the UK government at the signing of a trade agreement with Chinese premier Wen Jiabao. The error had been spotted by readers of the BBC News website who had contacted the BBC after seeing a photograph of the event.

==History==
In 1603, James VI of Scotland inherited the Kingdom of England (and the newly created client state, the Kingdom of Ireland) as James I, thereby uniting the crowns in a personal union. With Wales annexed into the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542, James now ruled over all of the island of Great Britain, which he frequently described as a unified kingdom (though the parliaments of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland did not actually unify until the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed in 1707). In the wake of the 1603 personal union, several designs for a new flag were drawn up, juxtaposing the Saint George&#x27;s Cross and the St Andrew&#x27;s Saltire, but none were acceptable to James:

Various other designs for a common flag were drawn up following the union of the two Crowns in 1603, but were rarely, if ever, used. One version showed St George&#x27;s cross with St Andrew&#x27;s cross in the canton, and another version placed the two crosses side by side. A painted wooden ceiling boss from Linlithgow Palace, dated to about 1617, depicts the Scottish royal unicorn holding a flag where a blue Saltire surmounts the red cross of St. George.

===1606–1801===
On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent the regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the flag of England (a red cross on a white background, known as St George&#x27;s Cross), and the flag of Scotland (a white saltire on a blue background, known as the saltire or St Andrew&#x27;s Cross), would be joined together, forming the flag of Great Britain and first union flag:

This royal flag was, at first, to be used only at sea on civil and military ships of both England and Scotland, whereas land forces continued to use their respective national banners. Flying the national flag at the mainmast had signified the Admiral of the Narrow Seas (the English Channel) and confusion arose. In 1634, King Charles I restricted its use to Royal Navy ships. After the Acts of Union 1707, the flag gained a regularised status as &quot;the ensign armorial of the Kingdom of Great Britain&quot;, the newly created state. It was then adopted by land forces as well, although the blue field used on land-based versions more closely resembled that of the blue of the flag of Scotland.

Various shades of blue have been used in the saltire over the years. The ground of the current Union Flag is a deep &quot;navy&quot; blue (Pantone 280), which can be traced to the colour used for the Blue Ensign of the Royal Navy&#x27;s historic &quot;Blue Squadron&quot;. (Dark shades of colour were used on maritime flags on the basis of durability.) In 2003 a committee of the Scottish Parliament recommended that the flag of Scotland use a lighter &quot;royal&quot; blue (Pantone 300) (the Office of the Lord Lyon does not detail specific shades of colour for use in heraldry).

A thin white stripe, or fimbriation, separates the red cross from the blue field, in accordance with heraldry&#x27;s rule of tincture where colours (like red and blue) must be separated from each other by metals (like white, i.e. &quot;argent&quot; or silver). The blazon for the old union flag, to be compared with the current flag, is &quot;azure, the cross saltire of St Andrew argent surmounted by the Cross of St George gules, fimbriated of the second.&quot;
The Kingdom of Ireland, which had existed as a personal union with England since 1541, was unrepresented in the original versions of the Union Jack. However, the flag of the Protectorate from 1658 to 1660 was inescutcheoned with the arms of Ireland. These were removed at the Restoration, because Charles II disliked them.

The original flag appears in the canton of the Commissioners&#x27; Ensign of the Northern Lighthouse Board. This is the only contemporary official representation of the pre-1801 Union Jack in the United Kingdom and can be seen flying from their George Street headquarters in Edinburgh.

This version of the Union Jack is also shown in the canton of the Grand Union Flag (also known as the Congress Flag, the First Navy Ensign, the Cambridge Flag and the Continental Colours), the first widely used flag of the United States, slowly phased out after 1777.

&quot;Lord Howe&#x27;s action, or the Glorious First of June&quot;, painted in 1795, shows a Union flying from on the &quot;Glorious First of June&quot; 1794. The actual flag, preserved in the National Maritime Museum, is a cruder approximation of the proper specifications; this was common in 18th and early 19th century flags.

The flag is also flown beside Customs House in Loftus Street, Sydney, to mark the raising of the Union Jack by Captain Phillip at Sydney Cove, the site of the first British settlement in New South Wales and Australia in 1788. On the plaque it is referred to as the &quot;Jack of Queen Anne&quot;.

The British Army&#x27;s flag is the Union Jack, but in 1938, a &quot;British Army Non-Ceremonial Flag&quot; was devised, featuring a lion on crossed blades with the St Edward&#x27;s Crown on a red background. This is not the equivalent of the ensigns of the other armed services but is used at recruiting and military or sporting events, when the army needs to be identified but the reverence and ceremony due to the regimental flags and the Union Jack would be inappropriate.

====Scottish Union Flag====

In objecting to the design of the Union Flag adopted in 1606, whereby the cross of Saint George surmounted that of Saint Andrew, a group of Scots took up the matter with John Erskine, 19th Earl of Mar, and were encouraged by him to send a letter of complaint to James VI, via the Privy Council of Scotland, which stated that the flag&#x27;s design &quot;will breid some heit and miscontentment betwix your Majesties subjectis, and it is to be feirit that some inconvenientis sail fall oute betwix thame, for our seyfaring men cannot be inducit to resave that flage as it is set down&quot;. Although documents accompanying this complaint which contained drafts for alternative designs have been lost, evidence exists, at least on paper, of an unofficial Scottish variant, whereby the Scottish cross was uppermost. There is reason to think that cloth flags of this design were employed during the 17th century for unofficial use on Scottish vessels at sea. This flag&#x27;s design is also described in the 1704 edition of &quot;The Present State of the Universe&quot; by John Beaumont, which contains as an appendix &quot;The Ensigns, Colours or Flags of the Ships at Sea: Belonging to The several Princes and States in the World&quot;.

On land, evidence confirming the use of this flag appears in the depiction of Edinburgh Castle by John Slezer, in his series of engravings entitled &quot;Theatrum Scotiae&quot;, c. 1693. Appearing in later editions of &quot;Theatrum Scotiae&quot;, the &quot;North East View of Edinburgh Castle&quot; engraving depicts the &quot;Scotch&quot; (to use the appropriate adjective of that period) version of the Union Flag flying from the Palace block of the Castle. On &quot;The North Prospect of the City of Edenburgh&quot; engraving, the flag is indistinct.

On 17 April 1707, just two weeks prior to the Acts of Union coming into effect, and with Sir Henry St George, the younger, the Garter King of Arms, having presented several designs of flag to Queen Anne and her Privy Council for consideration, the flag for the soon to be unified Kingdom of Great Britain was chosen. At the suggestion of the Scots representatives, the designs for consideration included that version of Union Jack showing the Cross of Saint Andrew uppermost; identified as being the &quot;Scotts union flagg as said to be used by the Scotts&quot;. However, the Queen and her Council approved Sir Henry&#x27;s original effort, numbered &quot;one&quot;.

A manuscript compiled in 1785 by William Fox and in possession of the Flag Research Center includes a full plate showing &quot;the scoth &quot; union&quot;&quot; flag. This could imply that there was still some use of a Scottish variant before the addition of the cross of St Patrick to the Union Flag in 1801.

=== After 1801 ===

The current and second Union Jack dates from 1 January 1801 with the Act of Union 1800, which merged the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The new design added a red saltire, the cross of Saint Patrick, for Ireland. This is counterchanged with the saltire of St Andrew, such that the red always follows the white clockwise. The arrangement has introduced a requirement to display the flag &quot;the right way up&quot; (see specifications for flag use above). As with the red cross, so too the red saltire is separated by a white fimbriation from the blue field. This fimbriation is repeated for symmetry on the white portion of the saltire, which thereby appears wider than the red portion. The fimbriation of the cross of St George separates its red from the red of the saltire.

Apart from the Union Jack, Saint Patrick&#x27;s cross has seldom been used to represent Ireland, and with little popular recognition or enthusiasm; it is usually considered to derive from the arms of the powerful FitzGerald family rather than any association with the saint.

====Flag speculation after Irish Free State establishment====
When the Anglo-Irish Treaty was concluded on 6 December 1921 and the creation of the new Irish Free State was an imminent prospect, the question arose as to whether the cross of Saint Patrick should remain in the Union Jack. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that on 22 January 1922:


There was some speculation on the matter in British dominions also, with one New Zealand paper reporting that:
However, the fact that it was likely that Northern Ireland would remain in the United Kingdom gave better grounds for keeping the cross of St. Patrick in the Union Jack. In this regard, Sir James Craig, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland remarked in December 1921 that he and his government were &quot;glad to think that our decision [to remain part of United Kingdom] will obviate the necessity of mutilating the Union Jack.&quot; Though remaining within the United Kingdom, the new government of Northern Ireland dispensed with the St Patrick&#x27;s Saltire in favour of a new flag derived from the coat-of-arms of the Burkes, Earls of Ulster, and quite similar to England&#x27;s St George&#x27;s Cross.

Ultimately, when the British home secretary was asked on 7 December 1922 (the day after the Irish Free State was established) whether the Garter King of Arms was &quot;to issue any Regulations with reference to the national flag consequent to the passing of the Irish Free State Constitution Act&quot;, the response was no and the flag has never been changed.

A Dáil question in 1961 mooted raising the removal of the cross of St Patrick with the British government; Frank Aiken, the Irish Minister for External Affairs, declined to &quot;waste time on heraldic disputations&quot;.

====21st century====

The lack of any Welsh symbol or colours in the flag is a result of Wales having been considered an integral part of the Kingdom of England at the time the flag of Great Britain was created in 1606. Since there is no Welsh element in the Union Jack, Wrexham&#x27;s Labour MP Ian Lucas proposed on 26 November 2007 in a House of Commons debate that the Union Flag be combined with the Welsh flag to reflect Wales&#x27;s status within the UK, and that the red dragon be added to the Union Flag&#x27;s red, white, and blue pattern. He said the Union Jack currently only represented the other three UK nations, and Minister for Culture, Creative Industries and Tourism Margaret Hodge conceded that Lucas had raised a valid point for debate. She said, &quot;the Government is keen to make the Union Flag a positive symbol of Britishness reflecting the diversity of our country today and encouraging people to take pride in our flag.&quot; This development sparked design contests with entries from all over the world.

In the run-up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, various non-official suggestions were made for how the flag could be redesigned without the St Andrew&#x27;s Cross if Scotland left the Union. However, as Scotland voted against independence, the issue did not arise.

==Status in the United Kingdom==
The Union Jack is used as a jack by commissioned warships and submarines of the Royal Navy, and by commissioned army and Royal Air Force vessels. When at anchor or alongside, it is flown from the jackstaff at the bow of the ship. When a ship is underway, the Union Jack is only flown from the jackstaff when the ship is dressed for a special occasion, such as the King&#x27;s official birthday.

The Union Flag is worn at the masthead of a ship to indicate the presence of an Admiral of the Fleet, former First Sea Lords and Admirals who are or have been Chief of Defence Staff. On the day on which a court-martial is to sit, the Union Flag is to be hoisted at the peak or at the yardarm as appropriate and a gun is to be fired when colours are hoisted, or at the time the signal is made if the court is ordered to sit immediately. 

The Royal Standard is flown when the Sovereign embarks in a warship. When other members of the Royal family embark they fly their own personal standard, which is usually a modified version of the Royal Standard.

No law has been passed making the Union Jack the national flag of the United Kingdom: it has become one through precedent. Its first recorded recognition as a national flag came in 1908, when it was stated in Parliament that &quot;the Union Jack should be regarded as the National flag&quot;. A more categorical statement was made by Home Secretary Sir John Gilmour, in 1933 when he stated that &quot;the Union Flag is the national flag and may properly be flown by any British subject on land.&quot;

Civilian use is permitted on land, but use of the unmodified flag at sea is restricted to military vessels. Unauthorised use of the flag in the 17th century to avoid paying harbour duties – a privilege restricted to naval ships – caused James&#x27;s successor, Charles I, to order that use of the flag on naval vessels be restricted to His Majesty&#x27;s ships &quot;upon pain of Our high displeasure.&quot; It remains a criminal offence under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 to display the Union Flag (other than the &quot;pilot jack&quot; – see below) from a British ship. Naval ships will fly the white ensign, merchant and private boats can fly the red ensign, others with special permission such as naval yacht clubs can fly the blue ensign. All of the coloured ensigns contain the union flag as part of the design.

The Court of the Lord Lyon, which has legal jurisdiction in heraldic matters in Scotland, confirms that the Union Jack &quot;is the correct flag for all citizens and corporate bodies of the United Kingdom to fly to demonstrate their loyalty and their nationality.&quot;

On 5 February 2008, Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Andrew Rosindell introduced the &#x27;Union Flag Bill&#x27; as a private member&#x27;s bill under the 10 Minute Rule in the House of Commons. The Bill sought to formalise the position of the Union Flag as the national flag of the UK in law, to remove legal obstacles to its regular display. The Bill did not receive its second reading by the end of that parliamentary session. The Bill stated &quot;Union flag (commonly known as the Union Jack)&quot; in subsection 1(1), but otherwise uses the term &quot;Union Flag&quot;.

===Flag days===

In July 2007, prime minister Gordon Brown unveiled plans to have the Union Flag flown more often from government buildings. While consultation on new guidelines was under way, the decision to fly the flag could be made by each government department. In March 2021, the UK government published new guidance for the Union Flag to be flown all year round on UK government buildings, unless another flag is being flown, such as another national flag of the UK, a county flag, or other flags to mark civic pride.

Previously, the flag was generally only flown on public buildings on days marking the birthdays of members of the royal family, the wedding anniversary of the monarch, Commonwealth Day, Accession Day, Coronation Day, the monarch&#x27;s official birthday, Remembrance Sunday, and on the days of the State Opening and prorogation of Parliament. Non-government organisations were (and are) permitted to fly the Union Flag whenever they choose.

The latest specified set of days when the Union Flag should be flown from government buildings throughout the UK are:

* Second Monday in March (Commonwealth Day)
* 9 April (anniversary of the wedding of The King and The Queen)
* 6 May (anniversary of the coronation of The King and The Queen)
* Second Saturday in June (official birthday of The King)
* 21 June (birthday of The Prince of Wales)
* 17 July (birthday of The Queen)
* 8 September (anniversary of the accession of The King)
* Second Sunday in November (Remembrance Sunday)
* 14 November (actual birthday of The King)

In addition, the flag should be flown in the following areas on these days:

* Wales, 1 March: Saint David&#x27;s Day
* Northern Ireland, 17 March: Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day
* England, 23 April: Saint George&#x27;s Day
* Scotland, 30 November: Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day
* Greater London: the opening and proroguing of Parliament
The Union Flag is flown at half-mast from the announcement of the death of the sovereign (save for Proclamation Day), or upon command of the sovereign.

On 30 November, St Andrew&#x27;s Day, the Union Flag can be flown in Scotland only where a building has more than one flagpole—on this day the Saltire will not be lowered to make way for the Union Flag if there is only one flagpole. This difference arose after members of the Scottish Parliament complained that Scotland was the only country in the world that could not fly its national flag on its national day. However, on 23 April, St George&#x27;s Day, it is the Union Flag of the United Kingdom that is flown over UK government offices in England.

===Usage and disposal===
The Union Flag has no official status in the United Kingdom, and there are no national regulations concerning its use or prohibitions against flag desecration. In Northern Ireland, the Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 provide for the flying of the flag on government buildings on certain occasions, when it is flown half-mast, and how it is displayed with other flags.

The Flags and Heraldry Committee, an all-party parliamentary group lobbying for official standards, cooperated with the Flag Institute in 2010 to publish a set of recommended guidelines for the flag&#x27;s display and use as a symbol.

There is no specific way in which the Union Flag should be folded. It is usually folded rectilinearly, with the hoist on the outside, to be easily reattached to the pole.

Royal Navy Stores Duties Instructions, article 447, dated 26 February 1914, specified that flags condemned from further service use were to be torn up into small pieces and disposed of as rags (ADM 1/8369/56), not to be used for decoration or sold. The exception was flags that had flown in action: these could be framed and kept on board, or transferred to a &quot;suitable place&quot;, such as a museum (ADM 1/8567/245).

==== Position of Honour ====

According to the UK Flag Protocol, the order of precedence of flags in the United Kingdom is: the Royal Standards, the Union Flag, the flag of the host country (England, Scotland and Wales etc.), the flags of other nations (in English alphabetical order), the Commonwealth Flag, the county flags, the flags of cities or towns, the banners of arms, and the house flags.

==== British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies ====

The Union Jack is the national flag of the British Overseas Territories, which are parts of the British realm with varying degrees of local autonomy. Most populated administrative regions and territories of the United Kingdom have been granted a unique flag for the locality, usually the Blue ensign or Red ensign defaced with the distinguishing arms of the territory. All fly the Union Jack in some form, with the exception of Gibraltar (other than the government ensign).

The Crown Dependencies, unlike the British Overseas Territories, are legally not part of the United Kingdom, and the Union Jack is not an official flag there. Outside the UK, the Union Jack is usually part of a special ensign in which it is placed in the upper left hand corner of a blue field, with a signifying crest in the bottom right. When the Union Jack and the territorial flag are flown together, the national flag is always arranged to take precedence over the territorial flag.

==Status outside the United Kingdom==
===Australia===

The Union Flag was used formally as the Australian national flag until 1953, having official precedence over the Australian Blue Ensign, though the latter was used by government and informally. Schools were encouraged to fly the Union Jack to encourage patriotism for the British Empire, with South Australia requiring students from 1911 to 1956 to fly the Union Jack for the &quot;national salute&quot;.

Over time, the blue ensign came to be used and embraced as the national flag, officially being designated as the &quot;Australian National Flag&quot; in 1953 with the passage of the &quot;Flags Act.&quot; Due to the sensitivity of those who still considered the Union Jack the national flag, the act specified that it did &quot;not affect the right or privilege of a person to fly the Union Jack&quot;. Additionally, Australian prime minister Robert Menzies told Australians that the Union Flag would be flown together with the Australian national flag &quot;on notable occasions&quot;. The Union Jack continued to see informal use as a flag of Australia for a period thereafter, although by the 1980s, the majority of Australians viewed the Australian blue ensign as the national flag as opposed to the Union Jack.

===Canada===
The Union Jack was the official national flag of Canada until 1965 when it was replaced in that role by the Maple Leaf flag. Since 1965, the Union Jack in Canada is used as an authorised symbol to represent Canada&#x27;s &quot;membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and its allegiance to the Crown&quot;.

====History====
The Union Jack has been used in a variety of colonies in British North America since its official adoption in 1707, In 1867, the British North American colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the Province of Canada were united to form the Canadian Confederation; with the Union Jack being retained as the official flag of the new &quot;confederation&quot;.

In addition to the Union Jack, during the late 19th century, a red ensign defaced with the arms of Canada was also used as an informal flag of Canada. The defaced red ensign, later known as the Canadian Red Ensign, was eventually authorised for official use as the country&#x27;s civil ensign in 1892. Although the Canadian Red Ensign was only formally authorised as a civil ensign, it was also viewed as a &quot;de facto&quot; national flag, as it was a uniquely Canadian symbol.

In 1964, Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson introduced plans to replace the Union Flag with a new national flag, spurring the Great Canadian flag debate. A new national flag, the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot;, was approved by the parliament of Canada on 17 December 1964. However, on the following day, the Canadian parliament passed another resolution that designated the Union Flag as the &quot;Royal Union Flag&quot; and authorised its official use as the symbol of the country&#x27;s membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and its allegiance to the Crown. On 15 February 1965, the maple leaf flag formally replaced the Union Flag as the flag of Canada following an official proclamation by Elizabeth II, with the Royal Union Flag becoming an official ceremonial flag.

The Union Flag was also legislated as the national flag for the Dominion of Newfoundland in 1931, a separate dominion of the British Empire. Newfoundland retained the Union Flag as a provincial flag after it joined the Canadian confederation in 1949, reaffirmed through the 1952 Revised Statutes of Newfoundland. In 1980, the flag of Newfoundland was adopted as the new provincial flag, with the design for the new flag of Newfoundland being derived from the Union Flag.

====Protocol====

The parliamentary resolution passed on 18 December 1964 assigned two purposes for the Royal Union Flag: a flag representing the United Kingdom and an official ceremonial flag of Canada. When used to represent the United Kingdom, the flag takes precedence before the flag of a Canadian province or territory. However, when the flag is used as a ceremonial flag of Canada, the flag of a Canadian province or territory takes precedence before the Royal Union Flag.

The parliamentary resolution requires the Royal Union Flag to be flown alongside the national flag of Canada (if there are at least two flag poles available) on federal properties on Commonwealth Day, Victoria Day (the monarch&#x27;s official birthday in Canada), 11 December (the anniversary of the enactment of the Statute of Westminster, 1931), and when otherwise instructed to do so by the National Defence Headquarters. The Royal Union Flag may also be formally flown alongside the flag of Canada at federal locations in Canada for ceremonies, anniversaries, and other events relating to the Canadian Armed Forces or other forces in the Commonwealth.

Items and properties that the parliamentary resolution applies to includes buildings operated by the federal government, military installations, federally-operated airports, at the masthead of Royal Canadian Navy ships within Canadian waters, and other appropriate establishments. The requirement for federal properties to fly the Royal Union Flag applies only when there are two or more flagpoles on the property, to ensure that the national flag of Canada is not taken down in place of the Royal Union Flag.

===New Zealand===

The Union Flag became the flag of New Zealand after the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in February 1840, replacing the flag used by the United Tribes of New Zealand. The issue of flying the flag of the United Tribes alongside the Union Jack, as a symbol of their equal standing with the colonial government, served as a factor that led to the Flagstaff War, led by Ngāpuhi chief Hōne Heke. British maritime flags were used by New Zealand vessels until 1865. After the passage of the Colonial Naval Defence Act 1865, vessels of the New Zealand government used a defaced blue ensign issued by the colonial government.

The current national flag of New Zealand was given official standing under the New Zealand Ensign Act in 1902, replacing the Union Flag. However, the Union Flag continued to see tandem use with the national flag of New Zealand into the 1950s.

===South Africa===
The Union Jack was used as the flag of a variety of colonies in South Africa since 1795. The Union Jack was retained as the official flag of the Union of South Africa after its formation in 1910. In addition to the Union Jack, from 1910 to 1928, the South African Red Ensign was also treated as an unofficial flag of the union.

Proposals to adopt a national flag were made during the 1920s. In 1927, the Union Nationality and Flag Act was passed by the Parliament of South Africa, which named both the Union Jack and the flag of South Africa as the flags of the union, both co-equal in status. The flag also incorporated the Union Jack in its design, alongside the flag of the Orange Free State and the flag of the South African Republic. The Union Jack was to be flown alongside the at principal government buildings in the capitals, at Union ports, on government offices abroad, and at such other places as the government might determine. The act went into effect on 31 May 1928.

Instructions issued in 1931 confirmed the places where both flags were to be flown. In addition to those already mentioned, they were the Union Buildings in Pretoria, the head offices of the four provincial administrations, the supreme courts, certain magistrates&#x27; courts, customs houses, and three buildings in Durban (the general post office, the railway station, and the local military district headquarters). Under these arrangements, the Union Jack was subordinate to the . As the two flags had to be the same size, it meant that the Union Jack was made in the ratio 2:3 rather than the usual 1:2.

This dual arrangement continued until 1957, when the Flags Amendment Act was passed naming the as the sole flag of South Africa. The was replaced by the flag of South Africa in 1994 as the country&#x27;s national flag.

===Use outside the Commonwealth===
Several individuals residing in countries not a part of the Commonwealth of Nations have adopted the Union Flag as a flag of protest.

====Hong Kong====
The Union Flag was formerly used in Hong Kong when it was a British Dependent Territory. Official use of the Union Flag and the British colonial Hong Kong flag ceased following the handover of Hong Kong to China in July 1997. In the 2010s, the Union Flag, along with the colonial flag of Hong Kong began to see use by supporters of the pro-democracy camp during the 2014 Hong Kong protests, and the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. The flag has been displayed at other pro-democracy events in Hong Kong, including the new year marches and the 1 July marches. Members of the Hong Kong Autonomy Movement, the Hong Kong independence movement and Hong Kong localists have been seen wielding the Union Flag or the colonial flag of Hong Kong.

However, the meaning behind the use of the flags by pro-democracy protestors, including the Union Flag, remains disputed with protestors citing a variety of reasons for flying it. Some pro-democracy protestors that flew foreign flags, including the Union Flag, did so in an effort to attract international media attention to the protests, while others did so in an effort to irritate the central government of China. The Union Flag, in addition to other foreign flags, were also used by some protestors to illustrate their desire for Hong Kong to be an &quot;international city&quot;; whereas others used the flag simply as a generic symbol of freedom.

Some specifically flew the Union Flag and the colonial flag of Hong Kong, nostalgic of the &quot;values&quot; of the previous colonial government, namely &quot;personal freedoms, rule of law, [and] clean governance&quot;. Other pro-democracy protestors choose to use the Union Flag and the colonial flag of Hong Kong in an effort to call upon the British government to declare that China had failed to uphold the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Several Hongkongers that hold British National (Overseas) passports who used the flag during the protests were doing so as a call to the British government to grant British National (Overseas) the right to abode in the United Kingdom. Although a small number of Hongkongers seek direct British intervention into the matter, the majority of those that used the Union Flag or the colonial flag of Hong Kong during the protests do not hold such beliefs.

The use of foreign flags at the protests, including the Union Flag, has been cited multiple times by the central government of China as evidence for their claim that foreign interference is steering the protests in Hong Kong against the central government. Conversely, several protestors in the pro-democracy camp have also criticized the use of foreign flags, who view their use as reinforcing the claims made by the central government of China.

====Italy====
After the British referendum on membership of the European Union resulted in a vote to leave, the Union Flag became a symbol of euroscepticism in Italy. In August 2016, many local businesses along the Italian riviera hoisted the flags as a protest against the implementation of the Services in the Internal Market Directive 2006.

==Use in other flags==
===National and regional flags===

As the national flag of the entire British Realm, the Union Flag was found in the &quot;canton&quot; (upper flagpole-side quarter) of the flags of many colonies of Britain, while the &quot;field&quot; (background) of their flags was the colour of the naval ensign flown by the particular Royal Navy squadron that patrolled that region of the world. Nations and colonies that have used the Union Flag at some stage have included Aden, Basutoland (now Lesotho), Barbados, Bechuanaland (now Botswana), Borneo, Burma, Canada, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Cyprus, Dominica, British East Africa (Kenya Colony), Gambia, Gold Coast (Ghana), Grenada, Guiana, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Labuan (Malaysia), Lagos, Malta, Mauritius, Nigeria, Palestine, Penang (Malaysia), Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Sierra Leone, Singapore, Somaliland, South Africa, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Pre-partitioned India (present-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar), Tanganyika, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, the United States, and Weihaiwei. As former British Empire nations were granted independence, these and other versions of the Union Flag were decommissioned. The most recent decommissioning of the Union Flag came on 1 July 1997, when the former Dependent Territory of Hong Kong was handed over to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Four former British colonies in Oceania which are now independent countries incorporate the Union Jack as part of their national flags: Australia, New Zealand and Tuvalu, which have retained the monarchy; and Fiji, which abolished the monarchy in 1987.

In former British colonies, the Union Jack was used interchangeably with informal flags of the territory for significant parts of their colonial early history. The Union Flag was used as the flag of Canada until it was re-adopted as a ceremonial flag, and the Maple Leaf flag made the official national flag in 1965. In addition to being an official ceremonial flag, the Union Flag also defaces the flags of a number of Canadian provinces, including British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario. Newfoundland and Labrador uses a flag that was derived from the Union Flag, with the Union Jack serving as the flag of Newfoundland until 1980. The Union Flag, and flags defaced with the Union Flag in its canton, like the Canadian Red Ensign, continue to see use in Canada in a private capacity. The pre-1801 Union Flag also sees limited use by private organizations, most notably the United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada.

Along with the national flag, many other Australian flags retain the use of the Union Jack, including the Royal Australian Navy Ensign (also known as the Australian White Ensign), the Royal Australian Air Force Ensign, the Australian Red Ensign (for use by merchant and private vessels), and the Australian Civil Aviation Ensign. The flags of all six Australian States retain the Union Jack in the canton, as do some regional flags such as the Upper and Lower Murray River Flags. The Vice-Regal flags of the State Governors also use the Union Jack. While the Flags Act 1953 states that Australians still have the &quot;right or privilege&quot; to fly the Union Jack after the introduction of the Australian National Flag, usage of the Union Jack by itself is unusual.

The Basque Country&#x27;s flag, the Ikurriña, is also loosely based on the Union Jack, reflecting the significant commercial ties between Bilbao and Britain at the time the Ikurriña was designed in 1894. The Miskito people sometimes use a similar flag that also incorporates the Union Jack in its canton, due to long periods of contact in the Mosquito Coast.

The Union Jack was used by the United States in its first flag, the Grand Union Flag. This flag was of a similar design to the one used by the British East India Company. The historical Kingdom of Hawaii adopted a flag featuring a Union Jack which was retained when Hawaii became a US state in 1959. Hawaii&#x27;s flag represents the only current use of the Union Jack in any American state flag.

Also in the United States, the Union Flag of 1606 is incorporated into the flag of Baton Rouge, the capital city of Louisiana. Baton Rouge was a British colony from the time of the Seven Years&#x27; War until the end of the American Revolutionary War, when it was captured by Spanish forces. Symbols from the colonial powers France and Spain are also incorporated into the Baton Rouge flag. Taunton, Massachusetts, uses a flag with the old style Union Flag by a resolution on 19 October 1974. Likewise, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, has been known to fly a flag containing the King&#x27;s Colours since 1973.

The Union Jack also appeared on both the 1910–1928 and 1928–1994 flags of South Africa. The 1910–1928 flag was a Red Ensign with the Union coat of arms in the fly. The 1928–1994 flag, based on the Prinsenvlag and commonly known as the &quot;oranje-blanje-blou&quot; (orange-white-blue), contained the Union Jack as part of a central motif at par with the flags of the two Boer republics of the Orange Free State and Transvaal. To keep any one of the three flags from having precedence, the Union Jack is spread horizontally from the Orange Free State flag towards the hoist; closest to the hoist, it is in the superior position but since it is reversed it does not precede the other flags.

The flag of the Municipal Council of Shanghai International Settlement in 1869 contained multiple flags to symbolize the countries have participated in the creation and management of this enclave in the Chinese city of Shanghai. The Union Jack was contained as part of top left hand shield and close to the flags of the United States and France, there was also contained the flag of Prussia nearby, but it was removed around 1917.

The flag of the Chilean city of Coquimbo features the Union Jack, owing to its historical commercial links to Britain.

===Ensigns===
The Union Flag can be found in the canton of several of the ensigns flown by vessels and aircraft of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. These are used in cases where it is illegal to fly the Union Flag, such as at sea from a ship other than a British warship. Normal practice for British ships is to fly the White ensign (Royal Navy), the Red ensign (Merchant and private boats) or the Blue ensign (government departments and public corporations). Similar ensigns are used by other countries (such as New Zealand and Australia) with the Union Flag in the canton. Other Commonwealth countries (such as India and Jamaica) may follow similar ensign etiquette as the UK, replacing the Union Flag with their own national flag.

===Others===

The flag in a white border occasionally seen on merchant ships was sometimes referred to as the Pilot Jack. It can be traced back to 1823 when it was created as a signal flag, but not intended as a civil jack. A book issued to British consuls in 1855 states that the white bordered Union Flag is to be hoisted for a pilot. Although there was some ambiguity regarding the legality of it being flown for any other purpose on civilian vessels, its use as an ensign or jack was established well in advance of the 1864 Act that designated the Red Ensign for merchant shipping. In 1970, the white-bordered Union Flag ceased to be the signal for a pilot, but references to it as national colours were not removed from the current Merchant Shipping Act and it was legally interpreted as a flag that could be flown on a merchant ship, as a jack if desired. This status was confirmed to an extent by the Merchant Shipping (Registration, etc.) Act 1993 and the consolidating Merchant Shipping Act 1995 which, in Section 4, Subsection 1, prohibits the use of any distinctive national colours or those used or resembling flags or pendants on Her Majesty&#x27;s Ships, &quot;except the Red Ensign, the Union flag (commonly known as the Union Jack) with a white border&quot;, and some other exceptions permitted elsewhere in the Acts. However, Section 2 regards the &quot;British flag&quot;, and states that &quot;The flag which every British ship is entitled to fly is the Red Ensign (without any defacement or modification) and, subject to (a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Secretary of State, or an Order of Council from her Majesty regarding a defaced Red Ensign), no other colours.&quot; The Flag Institute listed the white bordered Union Flag as &quot;Civil Jack&quot;.

The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) was one of a few non-government institutions using the Union Jack in part of the flag. HBC rival North West Company had a similar flag as well. The HBC Red Ensign is no longer in use in 1965 and replaced with a corporate flag featuring the company&#x27;s coat of arms.

An unofficial flag for the British Empire was created around 1910 due to a belief that the Union Jack itself no longer sufficiently represented dominions such as Canada, which were beginning to adopt their own unique symbols. The flag was similar in design to a White Ensign, which features the Union Jack in the canton. In the other quadrants were the coats of arms of Canada, Australia, and South Africa. The four stars forming the Crux over Saint George&#x27;s Cross represented New Zealand, and the Star of India was featured prominently in the middle. Civilians often flew Empire flags for patriotic events such as coronations, Empire Day, and the British Empire Exhibition. It is still flown on special occasions at the Dangarsleigh War Memorial.

The Union Jack is the third quarter of the 1939 coat of arms of Alabama, which is used on the flag of the governor of Alabama, representing British sovereignty over the state prior to 1783. The version used is the modern flag, whereas the 1707 flag would have been used in colonial Alabama.

In the former International Settlement of Kulangsu the Kulangsu Municipal Police had a badge contained multiple flags, including the Union Flag. Then the badge is incorporated in their police flag.

==In popular culture==

The Union Jack remains one of the most instantly-recognisable flags in the world. This is chiefly due not only to its iconic and unusual design, but the influence of British culture across the globe as a result of the British Empire, and its resulting presence in several Commonwealth nations&#x27; flags and heraldry. While most of the former colonies of the British Empire have chosen to omit the Union Jack in their national flags, some countries such as Australia and New Zealand have chosen to keep the Union Jack as a symbol of their British heritage, despite numerous attempts to change it.

The Union Flag has been a prominent symbol in the sphere of fashion since the British Invasion movement of the 1960s, in a similar manner to the American Stars and Stripes flag, and came back into fashion in the mid-1990s &#x27;Cool Britannia&#x27; era, notably Spice Girl Geri Halliwell&#x27;s iconic Union Jack dress of the 1997 Brit Awards. A notable increase in popularity was seen in Cuba following the 2012 London Olympics, with clothing, nail decoration, tattoos, and hairstyles in youths being observed featuring the pattern.

===Subsumation in corporate branding===
Commonly the Union Flag is used on computer software and Internet pages as an icon representing a choice of the English language where a choice among multiple languages may be presented to the user, though the American flag is also sometimes used for this purpose. The flag has been embroidered on various Reebok equipment as a mark of the brand&#x27;s British origin, and the Reebok Union Jack has been referred to as a brand icon. Many music artists have used the Union Jack, including the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Kinks, the Jam, Sex Pistols, the Stone Roses, David Bowie, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Freddie Mercury, Morrissey, Oasis, Blur, Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, and the Spice Girls.

British Airways painted a cropped Union Flag on their tail fins until 1984; from 1997 on, they started painting a stylised, fluttering Union flag on tail fins, nicknamed &quot;Chatham Dockyard Union Flag&quot;. The coat of arms of British Airways also features the escutcheon cropped from the Union Flag. British Airways used the coat of arms on their aircraft via the Landor livery between 1984 and 1997 and added back in 2011; they also used it as cap badge for pilots or in advertisements.

The BMW Mini tail lights are shaped after the Union Jack.

<text>The national flag of France () is a tricolour featuring three vertical bands coloured blue (hoist side), white, and red. The design was adopted after the French Revolution, whose revolutionaries were influenced by the horizontally striped red-white-blue flag of the Netherlands. While not the first tricolour, it became one of the most influential flags in history. The tricolour scheme was later adopted by many other nations in Europe and elsewhere, and, according to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; has historically stood &quot;in symbolic opposition to the autocratic and clericalist royal standards of the past&quot;.

Before the tricolour was adopted the royal government used many flags, the best known being a blue shield and gold fleurs-de-lis (the Royal Arms of France) on a white background, or state flag. Early in the French Revolution, the Paris militia, which played a prominent role in the storming of the Bastille, wore a cockade of blue and red, the city&#x27;s traditional colours. According to French general Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, white was the &quot;ancient French colour&quot; and was added to the militia cockade to form a tricolour, or national, cockade of France.

This cockade became part of the uniform of the National Guard, which succeeded the militia and was commanded by Lafayette. The colours and design of the cockade are the basis of the Tricolour flag, adopted in 1790, originally with the red nearest to the flagpole and the blue farthest from it. A modified design by Jacques-Louis David was adopted in 1794. The royal white flag was used during the Bourbon Restoration from 1815 to 1830; the tricolour was brought back after the July Revolution and has been used since then, except for an interruption for a few days in 1848. Since 1976, there have been two versions of the flag in varying levels of use by the state: the original (identifiable by its use of navy blue) and one with a lighter shade of blue. Since July 2020, France has used the older variant by default, including at the Élysée Palace.

==Design==
Article 2 of the French constitution of 1958 states that &quot;the national emblem is the tricolour flag, blue, white, red&quot;. No law has specified the shades of these official colours. In English blazon, the flag is described as &quot;tierced in pale azure, argent and gules.&quot;

The blue stripe has usually been a dark navy blue; a lighter blue (and lighter red) version was introduced in 1976 by President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. Both versions were used from then; town halls, public buildings and barracks usually fly the darker version of the flag, but the lighter version was sometimes used even on official State buildings.

On 13 July 2020, President Emmanuel Macron reverted, without any statement and with no orders for other institutions to use a specific version, to the darker hue for the presidential Élysée Palace, as a symbol of the French Revolution. The move was met with comments both in favour of and against the change, but it was noted that both the darker and lighter flags have been in use for decades.
Currently, the flag is one and a half times wider than its height (i.e. in the proportion 2:3) and, except in the French Navy, has stripes of equal width. Initially, the three stripes of the flag were not equally wide, being in the proportions 30 (blue), 33 (white) and 37 (red). Under Napoleon I, the proportions were changed to make the stripes&#x27; width equal, but by a regulation dated 17 May 1853, the navy went back to using the 30:33:37 proportions, which it now continues to use, as the flapping of the flag makes portions farther from the halyard seem smaller.
When the French president or prime minister is expected to be photographed at an official or televised event, a flag with a much narrower white stripe is often used as a backdrop to ensure that all three stripes are visible when the cameras are focused on them, as using a flag with equal stripes might show only the white stripe in frame.

==Symbolism==
Blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris, used on the city&#x27;s coat of arms. Blue is identified with Saint Martin, red with Saint Denis. At the storming of the Bastille in 1789, the Paris militia wore blue and red cockades on their hats. White had long featured prominently on French flags and is described as the &quot;ancient French colour&quot; by Lafayette. White was added to the &quot;revolutionary&quot; colours of the militia cockade to &quot;nationalise&quot; the design, thus forming the cockade of France. Although Lafayette identified the white stripe with the nation, other accounts identify it with the monarchy. Lafayette denied that the flag contains any reference to the red-and-white livery of the Duc d&#x27;Orléans. Despite this, Orléanists adopted the tricolour as their own.

Blue and red are associated with the Virgin Mary, the patroness of France, and were the colours of the oriflamme. The colours of the French flag may also represent the three main estates of the Ancien Régime (the clergy: white, the nobility: red and the bourgeoisie: blue). Blue, as the symbol of class, comes first and red, representing the nobility, comes last. Both extreme colours are situated on each side of white referring to a superior order.

The cockade of France was adopted in July 1789, a moment of national unity that soon faded. Royalists began wearing white cockades and flying white flags, while the Jacobins, and later the Socialists, flew the red flag. The tricolour, which combines royalist white with republican red, came to be seen as a symbol of moderation and of a nationalism that transcended factionalism.

The French government website states that the white field was the colour of the king, while blue and red were the colours of Paris.

The three colours are occasionally taken to represent the three elements of the revolutionary motto, (freedom: blue), (equality: white), (brotherhood: red); this symbolism was referenced in Krzysztof Kieślowski&#x27;s three colours film trilogy, for example.

In the aftermath of the November 2015 Paris attacks, many famous landmarks and stadiums around the world were illuminated in the flag colours to honour the victims.

==History==
===Kingdom of France===
During the early Middle Ages, the oriflamme, the flag of Saint Denis, was used—red, with two, three, or five spikes. Originally, it was the royal banner under the Capetians. It was stored in Saint-Denis abbey, where it was taken when war broke out. French kings went forth into battle preceded either by Saint Martin&#x27;s red cape, which was supposed to protect the monarch, or by the red banner of Saint Denis.

Later during the Middle Ages, these colours came to be associated with the reigning house of France. In 1328, the coat-of-arms of the House of Valois was blue with gold fleurs-de-lis bordered in red. From this time on, the kings of France were represented in vignettes and manuscripts wearing a red gown under a blue coat decorated with gold fleurs-de-lis. Charles V of France changed the design from an all-over scattering of fleurs-de-lis to a group of three in about 1376; these two coats are known in heraldic terminology as &quot;France Ancient&quot; and &quot;France Modern&quot;, respectively.

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, England was recognised by a red cross; Burgundy, a red saltire; and France, a white cross. This cross could figure either on a blue or a red field. The blue field eventually became the common standard for French armies. The French regiments were later assigned the white cross as standard, with their proper colours in the cantons. The French flag of a white cross on a blue field is still seen on some flags derived from it, such as that of Quebec.

The flag of Joan of Arc during the Hundred Years&#x27; War is described in her own words, &quot;I had a banner of which the field was sprinkled with lilies; the world was painted there, with an angel at each side; it was white of the white cloth called &#x27;boccassin&#x27;; there was written above it, I believe, &#x27;JHESUS MARIA&#x27;; it was fringed with silk.&quot; Joan&#x27;s standard led to the prominent use of white on later French flags.

From the accession of the Bourbons to the throne of France, the green ensign of the navy became a plain white flag, the symbol of purity and royal authority. The merchant navy was assigned &quot;the old flag of the nation of France&quot;, the white cross on a blue field. There also was a red jack for the French galleys. A variant of the plain white Bourbon banner, a white field strewn with gold fleur de lis, was also sometimes seen.

===The &quot;Tricolore&quot;===


The horizontally striped red-white-blue flag of the Netherlands originally inspired the colour scheme used by the French revolutionaries after the French Revolution in 1789. Consequently, the French tricolour flag is derived from the cockade of France used during the French Revolution. These were circular rosette-like emblems attached to the hat. Camille Desmoulins asked his followers to wear green cockades on 12 July 1789. The Paris militia, formed on 13 July, adopted a blue and red cockade. Blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris, and they are used on the city&#x27;s coat of arms. The addition of white has been attributed to Lafayette, Mayor Jean Sylvain Bailly, and even Louis XVI himself. This episode is supposed to have taken place on July 17, 1789, on the occasion of the king&#x27;s visit to the Paris city hall. However, it is proven that the tricolor cockade began to be worn, by order of the city, from the 13th or 14th of July. In any case, Louis XVI actually went to the Paris city hall where he received the tricolor cockade. On 27 July, a tricolour cockade was adopted as part of the uniform of the National Guard, the national police force that succeeded the militia.

A &quot;drapeau tricolore&quot; with vertical red, white and blue stripes was approved by the Constituent Assembly on 24 October 1790. Simplified designs were used to illustrate how the revolution had broken with the past. The order was reversed to blue-white-red, the current design, by a resolution passed on 15 February 1794.

When the Bourbon dynasty was restored following the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the &quot;tricolore&quot;—with its revolutionary connotations—was replaced by a white flag, the pre-revolutionary naval flag. However, following the July Revolution of 1830, the &quot;citizen-king&quot;, Louis-Philippe, restored the &quot;tricolore&quot;, and it has remained France&#x27;s national flag since that time.

Following the overthrow of Napoleon III, voters elected a royalist majority to the National Assembly of the new Third Republic. This parliament then offered the throne to the Bourbon pretender, Henri, Comte de Chambord. However, he insisted that he would accept the throne only on the condition that the tricolour be replaced by the white flag. As the tricolour had become a cherished national symbol, this demand proved impossible to accommodate. Plans to restore the monarchy were adjourned and ultimately dropped, and France has remained a republic, with the tricolour flag, ever since.

The Vichy régime, which dropped the word &quot;republic&quot; in favour of &quot;the French state&quot;, maintained the use of the &quot;tricolore&quot;, but Philippe Pétain used as his personal standard a version of the flag with, in the white stripe, an axe made with a star-studded marshal&#x27;s baton. This axe is called the &quot;Francisque&quot; in reference to the ancient Frankish throwing axe. During this same period, the Free French Forces used a &quot;tricolore&quot; with, in the white stripe, a red Cross of Lorraine.

The constitutions of 1946 and 1958 instituted the &quot;blue, white, and red&quot; flag as the national emblem of the Republic.

The colours of the national flag are occasionally said to represent different flowers; blue represents cornflowers, white represents marguerites, and red represents poppies.

==Regimental flags==
==Naval flags==

==Colonial flags==

Most French colonies either used the regular tricolour or a regional flag without the French flag. There were some exceptions:
==Other==
Many provinces and territories in Canada have French-speaking communities with flags represents:

Many areas in North America have substantial French-speaking and ancestral communities:
New Hebrides used several flags incorporating both the British Union Flag and the French flag.
In the Shanghai International Settlement, the flag of Shanghai Municipal Council has a shield incorporating the French tricolour.
Two territories of Vietnam used flags based on the tricolour flag of France.

<text>The Iraqi opposition (Arabic: المعارضة العراقية&quot;-Muʻaraḍatu l-‘Irāqiyyah&quot;) was a large political and militant structure represented by a diverse &quot;de facto&quot; coalition with the common goal of overthrowing Saddam Hussein.

==Structure==
In the south of Iraq, the opposition was dominated by Shia Arabs, while in the north, it was dominated by Kurds, mostly Sunni. In Baghdad, there was many Arab opposition groups. Large groups included the Iraqi National Congress, Kurdish groups such as KDP, PUK, IMK, AAI, as well as the Iraqi Constitutional Monarchy which aimed at restoring the Kingdom of Iraq, and the Iraqi National Accord, and the Iran-backed Shia groups such as the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq and Islamic Dawa Party, also the Democratic July 14 Movement coalition, pro-Assad Ba&#x27;athists, and the Iraqi Communist Party and its military wing Al-Ansar.

<text>The Iraqi National Congress (INC; ) is an Iraqi political party that was led by Ahmed Chalabi who died in 2015. It was formed as an umbrella opposition group with the aid and direction of the United States&#x27; government following the Persian Gulf War, for the purpose of fomenting the overthrow of longtime Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

==History==

INC was set up following the Persian Gulf War to coordinate the activities of various anti-Saddam groups. Then President George H. W. Bush signed a presidential finding directing the Central Intelligence Agency to create conditions for Saddam&#x27;s removal in May 1991. Coordinating anti-Saddam groups was an important element of this strategy. The name INC was reportedly coined by public relations expert John Rendon (of the Rendon Group agency) and the group was funded by the United States. The group received millions in covert funding in the 1990s, and then about $8 million a year in overt funding after the passage of the Iraq Liberation Act in 1998. The deep involvement of the American CIA in the creation and early funding of the INC in its early years led many to consider the group a &quot;creation of the CIA&quot; rather than an organ of genuine Iraqi opposition.

INC represented the first major attempt by opponents of Saddam to join forces, bringing together Kurds of all religions, Sunni and Shi&#x27;ite Arabs (both Islamic fundamentalist and secular) as well as non-Muslim Arabs; additionally monarchists, nationalists and ex-military officers. In June 1992, nearly 200 delegates from dozens of opposition groups met in Vienna, along with Iraq&#x27;s two main Kurdish militias, the rival Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). In October 1992, major Shi&#x27;ite groups, including the SCIRI and al-Dawa, came into the coalition and INC held a pivotal meeting in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, choosing a Leadership Council and a 26-member executive council. The leaders included monarchist Sharif Ali bin al-Hussein that called for the return of a constitutional monarchy for Iraq, moderate Shi&#x27;ite Muslim cleric Mohammad Bahr al-Ulloum; ex-Iraqi general Hasan Naqib; and Masoud Barzani. Ahmed Chalabi, a secular Shi&#x27;ite Iraqi-American and mathematician by training, became head of the group.

INC&#x27;s political platform promised &quot;human rights and rule of law within a constitutional, democratic, and pluralistic Iraq&quot;; preservation of Iraq&#x27;s territorial integrity, and complete compliance with international law, including United Nations resolutions relating to Iraq.

Differences within INC eventually led to its virtual collapse. In May 1994, the two main Kurdish parties began fighting with each other over territory and other issues. As a result of the growing difficulties within INC, the United States began seeking out other opponents who could threaten the Iraqi regime, such as the Iraqi National Accord (INA), headed by Ayad Allawi. The rivalries between the Kurdish parties prompted the KDP to seek armed support from Saddam Hussein for its capture of the town of Arbil from rival PUK. Iraq took advantage of the request by launching a military strike in which 200 opposition members were executed and as many as 2,000 arrested. 650 oppositionists (mostly INC) were evacuated and resettled in the United States under parole authority of the US Attorney General. INC played a central role in the truce negotiations between KDP and PUK.

INC was subsequently plagued by dissociation of many of its constituent groups from the INC umbrella, a cutoff of funds from its international backers (including the United States), and continued pressure from Iraqi intelligence services especially after a failed 1995 coup attempt. In 1998, however, the US Congress authorized $97 million in U.S. military aid for Iraqi opposition via the Iraq Liberation Act, intended primarily for INC.

In March 2002, Seymour Hersh reported in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that &quot;exile groups supported by the INC have been conducting sabotage operations inside Iraq, targeting oil refineries and other installations. The latest attack took place on January 23rd, an INC official told me, when missiles fired by what he termed &#x27;indigenous dissidents&#x27; struck the large Baiji refinery complex, north of Baghdad, triggering a fire that blazed for more than twelve hours.&quot; However, Hersh added, &quot;A dispute over Chalabi&#x27;s potential usefulness preoccupies the bureaucracy, as the civilian leadership in The Pentagon continues to insist that only the INC can lead the opposition. At the same time, a former Administration official told me, &#x27;Everybody but the Pentagon and the office of the Vice President wants to ditch the INC.&#x27; INC&#x27;s critics note that Chalabi, despite years of effort and millions of dollars in American aid, is intensely unpopular today among many elements in Iraq. &#x27;If Chalabi is the guy, there could be a civil war after Saddam&#x27;s overthrow,&#x27; one former C.I.A. operative told me. A former high-level Pentagon official added, &#x27;There are some things that a President can&#x27;t order up, and an internal opposition is one.&#x27;&quot;

Notwithstanding these concerns, Hersh reported that &quot;INC supporters in and around the Administration, including Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle, believe, like Chalabi, that any show of force would immediately trigger a revolt against Saddam within Iraq, and that it would quickly expand.&quot; In December 2002, Robert Dreyfuss reported that the administration of George W. Bush actually preferred INC-supplied analyses of Iraq over analyses provided by long-standing analysts within the CIA. &quot;Even as it prepares for war against Iraq, the Pentagon is already engaged on a second front: its war against the Central Intelligence Agency.,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The Pentagon is bringing relentless pressure to bear on the agency to produce intelligence reports more supportive of war with Iraq. ... Morale inside the U.S. national-security apparatus is said to be low, with career staffers feeling intimidated and pressured to justify the push for war.&quot; Much of the pro-war faction&#x27;s information came from INC, even though &quot;most Iraq hands with long experience in dealing with that country&#x27;s tumultuous politics consider the INC&#x27;s intelligence-gathering abilities to be nearly nil. ... The Pentagon&#x27;s critics are appalled that intelligence provided by the INC might shape U.S. decisions about going to war against Baghdad. At the CIA and at the State Department, Ahmed Chalabi, the INC&#x27;s leader, is viewed as the ineffectual head of a self-inflated and corrupt organization skilled at lobbying and public relations, but not much else.&quot;

&quot;The [INC&#x27;s] intelligence isn&#x27;t reliable at all,&quot; said Vincent Cannistraro, a former senior CIA official and counterterrorism expert. &quot;Much of it is propaganda. Much of it is telling the Defense Department what they want to hear. And much of it is used to support Chalabi&#x27;s own presidential ambitions. They make no distinction between intelligence and propaganda, using alleged informants and defectors who say what Chalabi wants them to say, [creating] cooked information that goes right into presidential and vice-presidential speeches.&quot; (Dreyfuss, December 2002). Chalabi received training in television presentation techniques from the Irish scriptwriter Eoghan Harris prior to the invasion of Iraq.

In February 2003, as the Bush administration neared the end of its preparations for war, an internal fight erupted over INC&#x27;s plan to actually become the government of Iraq after the U.S. invasion. Chalabi wanted to &quot;declare a provisional government when the war starts,&quot; a plan that &quot;alienated some of Mr. Chalabi&#x27;s most enthusiastic backers in the Pentagon and in Congress, who fear the announcement of a provisional government made up of exiles would split anti-Saddam sentiment inside Iraq.&quot;

During the Iraq War, the United States created the Free Iraqi Forces, a militia made of Iraqi expatriates and under the control of the Iraqi National Congress, fought alongside American forces. The INC&#x27;s forces were reportedly ill-equipped, often engaged in lawless activities, and also engaged in sectarian activity against Sunni Muslims.

After the first phase of the Iraq War was over and the Ba&#x27;athist government of Iraq was overthrown, a governing council, including Chalabi was set up, but when it came time to choose an interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, head of rival Iraqi National Accord, was chosen.

In May 2004, the United States military raided the residences of Iraqi National Congress members now living in Iraq. It had been announced on May 18 that the Pentagon had stopped sending funding to INC, which had averaged about $340,000 per month for intelligence gathered by the organization. It is unclear what the military forces were seeking, although a spokesman for Ahmed Chalabi said Chalabi had been held at gunpoint and told to accept concessions then being put in place by the United States in preparation for a transfer of sovereignty on June 30, 2004. Chalabi had been a critic of the transfer, saying that the U.S. retained too much power.

In the lead up to the January 2005 Iraqi election INC joined the United Iraqi Alliance coalition of mainly Shi&#x27;ite groups as Chalabi reinvented himself as a sharp critic of the occupation, aligning himself with Muqtada al-Sadr. Chalabi was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister in the transitional government, and INC member Ali Allawi (the cousin of Ayad Allawi, and incidentally nephew of Chalabi) became Minister of Finance.

In preparation for the December 2005 Iraqi election, INC broke with the United Iraqi Alliance and formed its own multi-ethnic coalition, the National Congress Coalition. It did not win any seats in the election.

<doc id="70775" wikidata="Q1061576" url="?curid=70775" title="Trans-Canada Highway">
<text>The Trans-Canada Highway (French: ; abbreviated as the TCH or T-Can) is a transcontinental federal–provincial highway system that travels through all ten provinces of Canada, from the Pacific Ocean on the west coast to the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast. The main route spans across the country, one of the longest routes of its type in the world. The highway system is recognizable by its distinctive white-on-green maple leaf route markers, although there are small variations in the markers in some provinces.

While by definition the Trans-Canada Highway is a highway &quot;system&quot; that has several parallel routes throughout most of the country, the term &quot;Trans-Canada Highway&quot; often refers to the main route that consists of Highway 1 (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba), Highways  11 &amp; 17/417 (Ontario), Autoroutes 40, 25, 20, 85 &amp; 185 (Quebec), Highway 2 (New Brunswick), Highways 104 and 105 (Nova Scotia), and Highway 1 (Newfoundland). This main route starts in Victoria and ends in St. John&#x27;s, passes through nine of the ten provinces, and connects most of the country&#x27;s major cities, including Vancouver, Calgary, Regina, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City, and Fredericton. One of the main route&#x27;s eight other parallel routes connects to the tenth province, Prince Edward Island.

While the other parallel routes in the system are also technically part of the Trans-Canada Highway, they are usually considered either secondary routes or different highways altogether. For example, Highway 16 throughout Western Canada is part of the Trans-Canada Highway system, but is almost exclusively referred to as the Yellowhead Highway and is often recognized as its own highway under that name. In comparison, Highway 1 in Western Canada is always referred to as the Trans-Canada Highway, and has a significantly higher traffic volume with a route passing through more major cities than the less important Highway 16 (Yellowhead) TCH route. Therefore Highway 1 is usually considered to be part of the main Trans-Canada Highway route, while Highway 16 is not, although it may be considered a second mainline corridor as it serves a more northerly belt of major cities, as well as having its own Pacific terminus.

Although the TCH network is strictly a transcontinental system, and does not enter any of Canada&#x27;s three northern territories or run to the United States border, it does form part of Canada&#x27;s overall National Highway System (NHS), which provides connections to the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and the border, although the NHS (apart from the TCH sections) is unsigned.

==Jurisdiction and designation==
Canada&#x27;s National Highway System is not under federal jurisdiction or coordination, as highway construction and maintenance are entirely under the jurisdiction of the individual provinces, which also handle route numbering on the Trans-Canada Highway. The Western provinces have voluntarily coordinated their highway numbers so that the main Trans-Canada route is designated Highway 1 and the Yellowhead route is designated Highway 16 throughout. Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador also designate Highway 1 as their section of the TCH, while New Brunswick uses Highway 2 (a separate important highway—albeit non-TCH—is Highway 1 in that province). East of Manitoba, the highway numbers change at each provincial boundary, or within a province (especially in Ontario and Quebec) as the TCH piggybacks along separate provincial highways (which often continue as non-TCH routes outside the designated sections) en route. In addition, Ontario and Quebec use standard provincial highway shields to number the highway within their boundaries, but post numberless Trans-Canada Highway shields alongside them to identify it. As the Trans-Canada route was composed of sections from pre-existing provincial highways, it is unlikely that the Trans-Canada Highway will ever have a uniform designation across the whole country.

==Highway design and standards==
Unlike the Interstate Highway System in the United States, the Trans-Canada Highway system has no national construction standard, and it was originally built mostly as a two-lane highway with few multi-lane freeway sections, similar to the older United States Numbered Highway System. As a result, highway construction standards vary considerably among provinces and cities. In much of British Columbia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador, the Trans-Canada Highway system is still in its original two-lane state. British Columbia is actively working on converting its section of Highway 1 east of Kamloops to a four-lane divided highway. Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba have widened most of their southern Trans-Canada Highway network to four lanes. In Quebec, most sections of the TCH network overlap with the province&#x27;s Autoroute freeways. New Brunswick is the only province to have its whole length of the main Trans-Canada Highway route at a four-lane freeway standard.

Like the former U.S. Route 66, the many non-expressway sections of the Trans-Canada Highway often form the main streets of communities, with homes and businesses directly adjacent to the Trans-Canada Highway.

The Trans-Canada Highway is not always the preferred route between two cities, or even across the country. For example, the vast majority of traffic travelling between Hope and Kamloops, British Columbia, takes the Coquihalla Highway via Merritt, rather than the longer Trans-Canada Highway route. Another example is that much long-distance traffic between Western and Eastern Canada will drive south into the United States and use the Interstate Highway System, rather than the Trans-Canada Highway through Northern Ontario.

==Main route ==

=== British Columbia ===

The main Trans-Canada Highway is uniformly designated as Highway 1 across the four western provinces. The British Columbia section of Highway 1 is long, beginning in Victoria at the intersection of Douglas Street and Dallas Road (where the &quot;Mile 0&quot; plaque stands), and ending on the Alberta border at Kicking Horse Pass. The highway starts by passing northward along the east coast of Vancouver Island for to Nanaimo along a mostly-four-lane, heavily-signalized highway. After passing through downtown Nanaimo on a small arterial road, it enters the Departure Bay Terminal and crosses the Strait of Georgia to Horseshoe Bay via BC Ferries. From there, it travels through Metro Vancouver on a four-to-eight-lane freeway before leaving the city and continuing as a four-lane freeway eastward up the Fraser Valley to Hope. There, the Trans-Canada Highway exits the freeway and turns north for through Fraser Canyon and Thompson Canyon toward Cache Creek, mostly as a two-lane rural highway with only occasional traffic lights. Approaching Kamloops, Highway 1 re-enters a short freeway alignment (briefly concurrent with Highways 5 and 97), before passing through Kamloops itself as a four-lane signalized highway. From Kamloops, the highway continues east as a mostly-two-lane rural highway through the Interior of British Columbia, with occasional passing lanes. It widens to a signalized four-lane arterial road for short stretches in Salmon Arm, Revelstoke, and Golden, but has no signal lights on it for most of its length. The highway crosses two high passes along its route: Rogers Pass in Glacier National Park, and Kicking Horse Pass in Yoho National Park. At Kicking Horse Pass, the highest point on the whole Trans-Canada Highway system is reached, at .

Speed limits on the Mainland segment of the Trans-Canada Highway in British Columbia range from , although in towns it can be as low as . A combination of difficult terrain and growing urbanization limits posted speeds on the Vancouver Island section to in urban areas, over the Malahat and through suburban areas, and a maximum of in rural areas.

=== Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba ===
The Trans-Canada Highway through the three prairie provinces is long. It starts at the border with British Columbia at Kicking Horse Pass, and runs all the way to the Ontario border at Whiteshell. The highway continues through Alberta, running east for as Alberta Highway 1 to Lake Louise, Banff, Canmore, and Calgary. This section of the highway passes through Banff National Park and has significant tourism. The section of Highway 1 through Banff National Park was also one of the first highways in North America to have wildlife crossing structures and fencing installed on it. After leaving the mountains it enters Calgary, where it becomes known as 16 Avenue N, a busy six-lane street with many signalized intersections. For the next after Calgary, the Trans-Canada Highway continues as a four-lane expressway, with few stops along its route. Medicine Hat is served by a series of six interchanges, after which the Trans-Canada crosses into Saskatchewan on the way to Moose Jaw. The highway mainly travels straight as a four-lane route for most of these sections. The expressway continues east to the city of Regina, and skirts around the city on the Regina Bypass, the most expensive infrastructure project in Saskatchewan to date. Beyond Regina, it continues east for , across the border with Manitoba, to the cities of Brandon and Portage la Prairie, and finally east to Winnipeg. The southern portion of Winnipeg&#x27;s Perimeter Highway (Highway 100) is part of the Trans-Canada Highway system, and bypasses the city with a mix of traffic lights and interchanges, while Highway 1 continues through central Winnipeg as a signalized arterial road.

With the exception of a stretch of two-lane highway just west of the Ontario border, the entire length of Highway 1 through the Prairie Provinces is a four-lane highway. While the only true freeway sections of the route are along the Regina Bypass, in Medicine Hat, and between Calgary and Banff, the whole highway is largely stoplight-free, with &quot;split&quot; at-grade intersections forming the vast majority of the junctions.

The speed limit is restricted to through national parks in Canada, including Banff National Park. East of Banff, traffic on most of Highway 1 through Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba is limited to , but is east of Winnipeg.

===Ontario===

East of Winnipeg, the highway continues for over to Kenora, Ontario. At the provincial border, the expressway becomes an arterial highway, and the numeric designation of the highway changes from 1 to 17. It is signed with a provincial shield along with a numberless Trans-Canada Highway sign, and continues as an arterial highway along the main route across Northern and Eastern Ontario, until widening out to a freeway at Arnprior, near Ottawa. In Kenora, the Trans-Canada designation includes both the main route through the city&#x27;s urban core and the Highway 17A bypass route to the north. The existing branch from Kenora continues east for to Dryden. This section of highway passes through the Canadian Shield, a rugged, forested area with thousands of lakes. There are many cottage communities along this section of the Trans-Canada Highway, some of which have their driveways directly onto the highway.

Highway 11/Highway 17 proceeds southeast for to Thunder Bay, then northeast for to Nipigon. An segment of the Trans-Canada Highway between Thunder Bay and Nipigon is commemorated as the &quot;Terry Fox Courage Highway&quot;. Fox was forced to abandon his cross-country Marathon of Hope run here, and a bronze statue of him was later erected in his honour. The highway is the only road that connects eastern and western Canada. On January 10, 2016, the Nipigon River Bridge suffered a mechanical failure, closing the Trans-Canada Highway for 17 hours; the only alternative was to go through the United States, around the south side of Lake Superior.

Highway 17 proceeds east from Nipigon for along the northern and eastern coast of Lake Superior. Between Wawa and Sault Ste. Marie, the highway crosses the Montreal River Hill, which sometimes becomes a bottleneck on the system in the winter when inclement weather can make the steep grade virtually impassable. At Sault Ste. Marie, the main route turns eastward for to Sudbury.

The mainline route then continues east from Sudbury for to North Bay. The northern route rejoins the mainline here, which continues to Arnprior, where it widens to a freeway and becomes Highway 417. The freeway continues to Ottawa passing through the city on Highway 417, which is between six and eight lanes wide at this point. In Southern Ontario, the speed limit is generally on the Trans-Canada, while in Northern Ontario it is . Sections routed along Highway 417 outside urban Ottawa feature a higher limit of .

While Highways 17 and 417 are largely free from traffic congestion except for minor rush hour delays on Ottawa&#x27;s stretch of Highway 417, the non-freeway sections are subject to frequent closures due to crashes, especially in winter. It is considered a dangerous route due to its extensive outdated sections of winding two-lane highway. Because this section of the highway passes through a largely undeveloped and forested area, collisions with animals are a common cause of crashes. , Sault Ste. Marie&#x27;s local government has asked for Highway 17 to be expanded north of the city.

Ontario plans to eventually extend the 417 freeway to Sudbury, which will widen the section of the mainline TCH between Ottawa and Sudbury to four-lane freeway standards. However, there is no funding secured for such a project, as Ontario is currently focusing on extending Highway 400 to Sudbury along the Highway 69 corridor (which is part of the Georgian Bay TCH route).

It is notable that the Trans-Canada largely bypasses Canada&#x27;s most heavily populated region, the Golden Horseshoe area of Southern Ontario, which includes Canada&#x27;s largest city, Toronto. However, a short section of the Central Ontario branch does pass through the rural northeastern edge of Durham Region at both Sunderland and Beaverton, which is officially part of the Greater Toronto Area. Access to Toronto itself from the mainline from Northern Ontario is via the non-TCH southern section of Highway 400, while access from Toronto to Quebec and points east is via Highway 401 (North America&#x27;s busiest highway and a major national highway in itself), a short non-TCH section of Autoroute 20, and A-30, where the Trans-Canada is joined at A-40 just west of Montreal.

=== Quebec ===
From Ottawa, the Trans-Canada Highway continues as a freeway and proceeds east to Montreal, as Highway 417 in Ontario (and the Queensway in Ottawa) and in Quebec. The Trans-Canada assumes the name (also known as &quot;The Met&quot; or &quot;Metropolitan Boulevard&quot;) as it traverses Montreal as an elevated freeway. At the Laurentian interchange, in Montreal, the Abitibi route (Highway 66, Route 117, A-15) rejoins the main TCH line. The TCH then follows Autoroute 25 southbound, crossing the St. Lawrence River through the 6-lane Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine Bridge–Tunnel, and proceeds northeast on Autoroute 20 for to (across from Quebec City).

East of , the Trans-Canada Highway continues on Autoroute 20 following the south bank of the St. Lawrence River to a junction just south of , northeast of . At that junction, the highway turns southeast and changes designation to Autoroute 85 for , and then downgrades from a freeway to Route 185, a non-Autoroute (not limited-access) standard highway for until Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!, where Autoroute 85 resumes once again. The portion from Autoroute 20 to Edmundston, New Brunswick, is approximately long.

Since the Trans-Canada Highway for the most part follows Quebec&#x27;s Autoroute System, which is always composed of a minimum four-lane freeway, travel through Quebec is generally, safe, fast, and congestion-free. The exception is the route through Montreal, which can be prone to traffic congestion. However, drivers can bypass the city on the tolled Autoroute 30, which is not part of the Trans-Canada.

The maximum speed limit on the Quebec Autoroute System (including the TCH) is a strictly-enforced . However, the speed limit may be lower in select spots, such as through tunnels or major interchanges.

Since 2018, Quebec has been working on upgrading the two-lane section of Trans-Canada Highway along Route 185 to an Autoroute, with of new freeway commissioned during 2021–22, another 10 km in 2024 and the remaining of freeway under construction, with final completion targeted for 2026. Once this project is complete, the disconnected sections of Autoroute 85 will be joined, and all of Quebec&#x27;s Mainline Trans-Canada Highway route will be minimum four-lane freeway standards. This will also result in the TCH becoming a continuous freeway from Arnprior, Ontario, to Lower South River, Nova Scotia.

=== New Brunswick ===

The Trans-Canada Highway crosses into New Brunswick and becomes Route 2 just northwest of Edmundston. From Edmundston, the highway (again signed exclusively with the TCH shield) follows the Saint John River Valley, running south for to Woodstock (parallelling the Canada–US border) and then east for another to pass through Fredericton. east of Fredericton, the Saint John River turns south, whereby the highway crosses the river at Jemseg and continues heading east to Moncton another later. On November 1, 2007, New Brunswick completed a 20-year effort to convert its entire section of the Trans-Canada Highway into a four-lane limited-access divided highway. The highway has a speed limit of on most of its sections in New Brunswick.

New Brunswick was the first province where the main route of the Trans-Canada Highway was made entirely into a four-lane limited-access divided highway.

From Moncton, the highway continues southeast for to a junction at Aulac close to the New Brunswick–Nova Scotia border (near Sackville). Here, Trans-Canada Highway again splits into two routes, with the main route continuing to the nearby border with Nova Scotia as Route 2, and a route designated as Route 16, which runs east to the Confederation Bridge at Cape Jourimain.

=== Nova Scotia ===

From the New Brunswick border, the main Trans-Canada Highway route continues east into Nova Scotia at Amherst, where it settles onto Nova Scotia Highway 104. Southeast of Amherst, near Thomson Station, the highway traverses the Cobequid Pass, a tolled section ending at Masstown, before passing by Truro, where it links with Highway 102 to Halifax, east of the New Brunswick border. Halifax, like Toronto, is a provincial capital that the Trans-Canada Highway does not pass through. Beyond Truro, the highway continues east for to New Glasgow, where it meets Highway 106, before continuing to the Canso Causeway, which crosses the Strait of Canso onto Cape Breton Island near Port Hawkesbury. From the Canso Causeway, the highway continues east, now designated as Highway 105 on Cape Breton Island, until reaching the Marine Atlantic ferry terminal at North Sydney.

=== Newfoundland and Labrador ===

From North Sydney, a ferry route, operated by the Crown corporation Marine Atlantic, continues the highway to Newfoundland, arriving at Channel-Port aux Basques, whereby the Trans-Canada Highway assumes the designation of Highway 1 and runs northeast for through Corner Brook, east for another through Gander, and finally ends at St. John&#x27;s, another southeast, for a total of , crossing the island. The majority of the Trans-Canada Highway in Newfoundland is undivided, though sections in Corner Brook, Grand Falls-Windsor, Glovertown, and a section from Whitbourne to St. John&#x27;s are divided.

===&quot;Mile zero&quot;===
Although there does not appear to be any nationally-sanctioned &quot;starting point&quot; for the entire Trans-Canada Highway system, St. John&#x27;s has adopted this designation for the section of highway running in the city. The foot of East White Hills Road in St. John&#x27;s, near Logy Bay Road, would be a more precise starting point of the highway, where the road meets and transfers into the start of the Trans-Canada Highway. The terminus of the Trans-Canada Highway in Victoria, at the foot of Douglas Street and Dallas Road at Beacon Hill Park, is also marked by a &quot;mile zero&quot; monument. St. John&#x27;s downtown arena, Mary Brown&#x27;s Centre, was originally branded under naming rights as &quot;Mile One Centre&quot; in reference to the geography of the region.

The usage of miles instead of kilometres at both designations dates back to when the Trans-Canada Highway was completed in 1962, prior to metrication in Canada.

== Other routes ==
=== Highway 16 (Yellowhead Highway) ===

The Yellowhead Highway is a highway in Western Canada, running from Masset, British Columbia, to where it intersects Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) just west of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. It is designated as Highway 16 in all four provinces that it passes through (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba). It follows a more northerly east–west route across Western Canada than the main TCH and passes through fewer cities, with Edmonton being the largest on the route. Other major municipalities on the route include Prince Rupert, Prince George, Lloydminster, and Saskatoon. The Yellowhead Highway is most well-known for passing through Jasper National Park in Alberta, where it crosses the Continental Divide through its namesake Yellowhead Pass. Since it carries significantly less traffic than its more southerly counterpart, the Yellowhead is almost exclusively a two-lane highway in British Columbia and Manitoba, and is only partially a four-lane expressway in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Until 1990, the Yellowhead Highway had its own unique highway number signs, but they have now mostly been replaced with standard maple-leaf Trans-Canada Highway signs, with numberless Yellowhead shields posted adjacent to them.

=== Northern Ontario &amp; Quebec routes ===

The section of Highway 71 and Highway 11 between Kenora and North Bay, Ontario, is considered part of the Trans-Canada Highway. This highway first runs south of the Main TCH route between Kenora and Thunder Bay, passing through the town of Fort Frances on the U.S. border. Then, after running concurrently with the main Trans-Canada Highway route, Highway 11 splits off to the north at Nipigon, running through a vast and sparsely-populated area of northern Ontario. This highway sees little long-distance traffic compared to the main route, beside heavy transport trucks looking to avoid the significant elevation changes along the Lake Superior route, since it is much flatter and the transit time for heavy hauling is usually the same. The area is also not well-known as a tourist destination outside of fishing tours, which are often fly-in. A much shorter section of Highway 66 connects another northern Trans-Canada Highway route to Quebec&#x27;s Highway 117, which itself continues the TCH route to Montreal after connecting with Autoroute 15. The main Highway 11 continues south until it intersects the main Trans-Canada Highway route (Highway 17) in North Bay. Except for the southernmost stretches south of Labelle, these highways are two-lane undivided routes.

=== Central Ontario / Georgian Bay route ===

The southern Ontario Trans-Canada Highway route is even more abstract than the northern ones, as it uses four different provincial highways, and is largely non-functional as a major long distance corridor due to its roundabout route and the complete avoidance of the Toronto area. It is a alternate route to Highway 17 (the mainline TCH) between Sudbury and Ottawa. It passes through several major communities, including Orillia and Peterborough. Because it passes closer to major population centres, this section of the TCH sees higher traffic volumes. It is made up of various sections of freeways, expressways, and two-lane routes.

=== Prince Edward Island Route ===

Another spur route of the Trans-Canada Highway splits off the mainline in eastern New Brunswick. This route connects to Prince Edward Island across the Confederation Bridge, crosses the central part of Prince Edward Island, including through the provincial capital of Charlottetown, before crossing back to the mainland on a ferry. This length of the route is 234 km (145 miles), and consists of New Brunswick Highway 16, Prince Edward Island Highway 1, and Nova Scotia Highway 106. This leg of the Trans-Canada Highway sees moderately high traffic volumes and is an important tourist route. The Confederation Bridge is often viewed as an attraction in itself. Although the highway is mostly a two-lane route, portions of the route are built as two-lane expressways.

=== Bypasses ===

Two short bypasses are also considered part of the Trans-Canada Highway system. These include the Perimeter Highway 100 bypass around Winnipeg, which provides an expressway standard alternative to the crowded Highway 1 in the city centre, and the two-lane Kenora Bypass (Highway 17A), which is a two-lane route that bypasses the entire town to the north.

==History==
=== Predecessor routes ===
Early on, much of the route of the Trans-Canada Highway was first explored in order to construct the Canadian Pacific Railway in the late 19th century, a route which much of the mainline TCH route later ended up following.

The Trans-Canada Highway was not the first road across Canada. In British Columbia, the highway was predated by the Crowsnest Highway, the Big Bend Highway, and the Cariboo Highway, all of which were constructed during the Great Depression era. Many of the earlier highways in British Columbia were largely gravel and had many frequent inland ferry crossings at wide rivers and lakes. In Alberta, the section between Calgary and Banff was predated by the Morley Trail (now Highway 1A), which was driveable starting in the 1910s and paved in the 1930s. The first route over the Central Canadian Rockies to connect Calgary to British Columbia was the Banff–Windermere Parkway, which was opened in 1922 and is now numbered as Highway 93. Sections of road across the Prairies have also existed since the 1920s. A gravel road connection across northern Ontario (Highway 17) was constructed starting in 1931. While this section was largely open by the late 1930s, it was not fully completed until 1951 (in large part due to World War II interrupting construction). However, despite the gap, vehicles could still cross the county by getting ferried around the relatively short section of incomplete highway by either rail or water, and Highway 11 was completed to Hearst from the east by 1937 and Nipigon by 1943.

=== Opening ===
The system was approved by the Trans-Canada Highway Act of 1949, with construction commencing in 1950. The highway officially opened in 1962, with the completion of the Rogers Pass section of highway between Golden and Revelstoke. This section of highway bypassed the original Big Bend Highway, the last remaining section of gravel highway on the route. Upon its original completion, the Trans-Canada Highway was the longest uninterrupted highway in the world. Construction on other legs continued until 1971, when the last gap on Highway 16 was completed in the Upper Fraser Valley east of Prince George, at which point the highway network was considered complete.

=== Since completion (1960–2000) ===
When the Trans-Canada Highway first opened, it was almost exclusively a two-lane route for its whole length across the country. While at the time it was considered a major improvement to the gravel roads and ferries it replaced, it was soon believed to be insufficient to handle the growing traffic volumes. In response, several provinces began to construct realignments, freeway widenings, and twin sections of highway in response to traffic flow and safety concerns.

In British Columbia&#x27;s Lower Mainland, the Upper Levels Freeway alignment was opened in 1960 with the completion of the Second Narrows Crossing, which allowed the Trans-Canada Highway to bypass downtown Vancouver&#x27;s streets and the narrow Lions Gate Bridge. The four-lane Upper Levels Freeway was relatively-crudely constructed, with narrow lanes, low overpasses, and no proper merge ramps. It remains in this state in the present day. Between 1962 and 1964, Highway 1 was rerouted onto a new four-lane freeway bypass between Vancouver and Chilliwack. This section of highway was originally part of British Columbia&#x27;s own 400 series of highways, until the designation was replaced by Highway 1. A freeway alignment on the Trans-Canada Highway between Chilliwack and Hope opened in 1986. The opening of the Cassiar Tunnel in 1990 bypassed the last sets of signal lights in Vancouver, rendering the whole alignment of the Trans-Canada Highway through the Lower Mainland a freeway. All bypassed sections of the highway were absorbed into various urban and rural road networks. The older freeways in the Lower Mainland were largely built as a parkway design, with wide, forested medians and low overpasses (a road configuration that was common across North America at the time). After the opening of the Coquihalla Highway in 1986, the Trans-Canada Highway through the Fraser Canyon received less traffic, because the freeway bypass shortened the drive between Hope and Kamloops by 90 minutes. However, the route was retained as part of the Trans-Canada Highway system, and is considered a scenic route and a valuable part of the Fraser Country Circle Tour. The opening of the Coquihalla was also an economic disaster for many of the towns along the Fraser Canyon section of the Trans-Canada Highway, since most of the travel and tourism business along the route quickly dried up when most of the traffic took the new highway. The towns continue to be largely deprived of wealth, and some are close to being abandoned. On the other hand, Merritt, located midway up the new Coquihalla highway, ended up booming, and continues to grow as a tourism and travel centre. The Coquihalla project also realigned Highway 1 (TCH) to a new freeway bypass around Kamloops. Plans for a freeway to bypass or eliminate traffic congestion and road hazards along the heavily-travelled route from Victoria to Nanaimo on Vancouver Island were cancelled during the recession that followed the 1987 stock market crash.

In Alberta, between 1964 and 1972, the Trans-Canada Highway was completely rerouted from its former two-lane alignment along the Bow River to a new, more direct, four-lane freeway between Banff and Calgary, resulting in the bypassing of several towns, such as Canmore. Prior to this change, one of the first traffic circles in Canada existed on Highway 1 at the &quot;gateway&quot; junction for Banff from at least as early as the 1950s. The current interchange on Highway 1 for Banff Avenue now occupies the site. In the rest of Banff National Park, much of the predecessor Highway 1 parkway was bypassed by a new two-lane route in the 1960s. The original route between Banff and Lake Louise remains as the Bow Valley Parkway and Lake Louise Drive, while a section over Kicking Horse Pass was abandoned and is now part of the Great Divide Trail. Between 1973 and 1990, the highway was twinned from Calgary to the Saskatchewan Border. In 1970, plans were made for a six-to-eight-lane freeway to carry the Trans-Canada Highway though the heart of North Calgary, but the plan was soon dropped due to citizen outcry.

Between Ottawa and the Ontario–Quebec border, the Trans-Canada Highway designation was taken from the two-lane Highway 17 and applied to the existing Highway 417 freeway in 1997–98. On April 1, 1997, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) transferred the responsibility of maintenance and upkeep along of Highway 17 east of &quot;the split&quot; with Highway 417 to Trim Road (Regional Road 57) to the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, a process commonly referred to as &quot;downloading&quot;. The Regional Municipality then designated the road as Regional Road 174. Despite the protests of the region that the route served a provincial purpose, a second round of transfers saw Highway 17 within Ottawa downloaded entirely on January 1, 1998, adding an additional to the length of Regional Road 174. The highway was also downloaded within the United Counties of Prescott and Russell, where it was redesignated as County Road 17. The result of these transfers was the truncation of Highway 17 at the western end of Highway 417. 1990 saw the opening of the two-lane Kenora Bypass, providing through traffic with a way to avoid the congested town.

Starting in the 1960s, Quebec began to build its Autoroute network. Many sections of Trans-Canada Highway were widened to freeway standards during that era of highway construction.

Starting in 1987, New Brunswick began to widen its section of TCH to four lanes. Work to make the route a full freeway began in the late 1990s and was completed in 2007.

The Confederation Bridge connecting PEI to New Brunswick opened in 1997. Replacing the ferry that previously serviced that route, it was hailed as a major accomplishment.

=== Recent changes (2000–present) ===
In 2000 and 2001, Transport Canada considered funding an infrastructure project to have the full Trans-Canada system converted to limited-access divided highways. Although construction funding was made available to some provinces for portions of the system, the federal government ultimately decided to not pursue a comprehensive limited-access highway conversion. Opposition to funding the limited-access widening was due to low traffic levels on parts of the Trans-Canada Highway.

Prior to the start of the Great Recession in 2008, the highway underwent some changes through the Rocky Mountains from Banff National Park to Golden, British Columbia. A major piece of this project was completed on August 30, 2007, with the new Park Bridge and Ten Mile Hill sections opening up of new four-lane highway. Other smaller four-lane widening projects on the Trans-Canada Highway in the interior of British Columbia were also built around the same time. As part of the Gateway Program, of congested four-lane Highway 1 freeway in Metro Vancouver were widened to an eight-lane buildout starting in 2012. This project continues into the present, with the current goal of rebuilding the freeway to a minimum six-lane layout from Langley to Abbotsford by 2025.

The twinning of the highway in Alberta&#x27;s Banff National Park continued with four-lane highway opening as far as the Highway 93 junction north of Lake Louise by the winter of 2010. Parks Canada completed twinning the final of Highway 1 between Lake Louise and the British Columbia border, with the new alignment opened to traffic on June 12, 2014, making the whole length of Alberta&#x27;s main Trans-Canada Highway route a minimum four lanes. Stoney Trail began construction in 2005, and was usable as a bypass around Calgary when its northeastern section opened in 2010. Although not officially part of the Trans-Canada Highway system, Stoney Trail plays a critical role in providing through traffic on the Trans-Canada Highway with a way around the city.

During the 2000s, much of the Trans-Canada Highway through Saskatchewan and Manitoba was twinned. In 2019, the Regina Bypass opened, resulting in the Trans-Canada Highway being realigned around the city and bypassing a section of heavily-signalized arterial road on Victoria Avenue.

The 2010s saw changes to other routes in the Trans-Canada Highway system as well. Ontario Highway 400 began to be extended towards Sudbury, replacing Highway 69 and resulting in a freeway alignment for part of the Southern Ontario Trans-Canada Highway Route. Work on this project is continuing, with almost of freeway currently under construction.

Edmonton is currently attempting to widen its urban section of Highway 16 to a six-lane freeway. Large amounts of Highway 16 in Alberta were twinned during the 2000s.

Despite these many widenings, over half of the mainline Trans-Canada highway still remains in its original two-lane state, and only about 15% of the mainline&#x27;s length is composed of freeway comparable to that of the Interstate Highway System.

In 2012, a series of free public electric vehicle charging stations were installed along the main route of the highway by a private company, Sun Country Highway, permitting electric vehicle travel across the entire length, as demonstrated by the company&#x27;s president, Kent Rathwell, in a publicity trip from St John&#x27;s, NL, to Victoria, BC, in a Tesla Roadster. , this made the TCH the longest electric-vehicle-ready highway in the world.

== Future ==
No national plan for widening the Trans-Canada Highway exists, and all planning is currently done by the individual provinces, as the Trans-Canada Highway and highways within National Highway System fall within provincial/territorial jurisdiction, with provincial/territorial governments responsible for planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and financing.  However, the federal government may contribute funding to highway projects through its various funding programs. Currently, there are five large-scale highway projects on the Trans-Canada Highway Network.

Quebec is working on completing Autoroute 85, bringing the last two-lane section of the mainline highway in Quebec up to four-lane freeway standards. , only of two-lane highway had not yet been addressed. The rest either had been completed or was currently under construction.

In Ontario, the province has several significant highway expansion projects on the Trans-Canada Highway planned or under way:

* Between Parry Sound and Sudbury, construction to upgrade Highway 69 from a two-lane highway to a 400-series freeway has been underway for decades, with the most recently completed section of freeway officially opened in December 2021, leaving to be completed. 
* Between Arnprior and Renfrew, the province announced in 2019 the upgrading of an additional of two-lane Highway 17 to a 400-series freeway. The announcement did not specify costs or timelines, but a new overpass at Calabogie Road opened in August 2023.
* Between Thunder Bay and Nipigon, construction to make Highway 11/17 a four-lane divided highway (with at-grade intersections) started in the late 2000s, with completion expected by 2030. The most recent section through Dorion was opened in the summer of 2023, with other sections under design or construction. 
* Between Kenora and the Manitoba border, construction to make Highway 17 a four-lane divided highway started in 2022, with a section slated for completion by 2025 and the remaining sections still under design.

In Manitoba in May 2023, the province announced the launch of a conceptual design study for the twinning of the remaining two-lane section of Highway 1 west of the Ontario border, plus the immediate construction of a section to align with four-laning work in Ontario.

, British Columbia was planning on widening the long section of TCH between Kamloops and Alberta to four lanes by 2050. The project goals do not include an eventual freeway conversion, and it is likely that the signalized sections of highway in Kamloops, Salmon Arm, Revelstoke, and Golden will remain. Around of four-lane highway were under construction, with more planned to start in 2022. Around a quarter of the length of highway between Kamloops and Alberta is now four lanes wide. At the current rate of construction, the project will likely not be completed until the 2070s. However, some of the most difficult sections have been completed, meaning that it may be easier to widen the remaining sections of highway to four lanes. Some of the highway in this section is under the jurisdiction of Parks Canada, specifically the sections through Mount Revelstoke, Glacier, and Yoho National Parks, which means that Parks Canada will have to implement its own four-lane program in order for the provincial government to accomplish its goal.

The City of Edmonton is changing its urban section of Highway 16 (TCH) to a six-lane freeway by replacing all signal lights with overpasses. The route is already largely a freeway, but seven signalized intersections remain. The project is expected to be finished by 2026.

, British Columbia was planning on widening of Highway 1 in the Lower Mainland as part of its Fraser Valley Highway program. The four-lane freeway is over-congested, and many of the overpasses are in poor shape. The project intends to rebuild most of the interchanges and overpasses and widen the highway to six lanes. The first of this project opened in 2020, with more expected to be complete in 2025.

Apart from the major programs, many smaller-scale projects exist on the highway in order to rehabilitate the aging infrastructure or make minor traffic changes.

Alberta had long term plans to convert both of its Trans-Canada Highway routes to a minimum four-lane freeway standard, but has not set a timeline for doing so.

<text>The national flag of Germany () is a tricolour consisting of three equal horizontal bands displaying the national colours of Germany: black, red, and gold (). The flag was first sighted in 1848 in the German Confederation. The flag was also used by the German Empire from 1848 to 1849. It was officially adopted as the national flag of the German Reich (during the period of the Weimar Republic) from 1919 to 1933, and has been in use since its reintroduction in the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949.

Since the mid-19th century, Germany has two competing traditions of national colours, black-red-gold and black-white-red. Black-red-gold were the colours of the 1848 Revolutions, the Weimar Republic of 1919–1933 and the Federal Republic (since 1949). They were also adopted by the German Democratic Republic (1949–1990).

The colours black-white-red appeared for the first time in 1867 in the constitution of the North German Confederation. This nation state for Prussia and other north and central German states was expanded to the south German states in 1870–71, under the name German Empire. It kept these colours until the revolution of 1918–19. Thereafter, black-white-red became a symbol of the political right. The Nazis (National Socialist German Worker&#x27;s Party) re-established these colours along with the party&#x27;s own swastika flag in 1933. After World War II, black-white-red was still used by some conservative groups or by groups of the far right, as it is not forbidden, unlike specific Nazi symbols such as the aforementioned swastika.

Black-red-gold is the official flag of the Federal Republic of Germany. As an official symbol of the constitutional order, it is protected against defamation. According to §90a of the German penal code, the consequences are a fine or imprisonment up to three years.

== Origins ==
The German association with the colours black, red, and gold surfaced in the radical 1840s, when the black-red-gold flag was used to symbolise the movement against the Conservative Order, which was established in Europe after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat.

There are many theories in circulation regarding the origins of the colour scheme used in the 1848 flag. It has been proposed that the colours were those of the Jena Students&#x27; League (), one of the radically minded banned by in the Carlsbad Decrees. The colours are mentioned in their canonical order in the seventh verse of August Daniel von Binzer&#x27;s student song (&quot;On the Dissolution of the Jena Students&#x27; League&quot;) quoted by in his &quot;Academic Festival Overture&quot;. Another claim goes back to the uniforms (mainly black with red facings and gold buttons) of the Lützow Free Corps, which were mostly worn by university students and were formed during the struggle against the occupying forces of Napoleon. Whatever the true explanation, those colours soon came to be regarded as the national colours of Germany during that brief period. Especially after their reintroduction during the Weimar period, they became synonymous with liberalism in general. (The colours also appear in the medieval .)

== Flag variants ==
=== Civil flag ===

The German national flag or (), containing only the black-red-gold tricolour, was introduced as part of the (West) German constitution in 1949. Following the creation of separate government and military flags in later years, the plain tricolour is now used as the German civil flag and civil ensign. This flag is also used by non-federal authorities to show their connection to the federal government, e.g. the authorities of the German states use the German national flag together with their own flag.

=== Government flag ===

The government flag of Germany is officially known as the (state flag of the federal authorities) or for short. It was introduced in 1950. It is the civil flag defaced with the (&quot;Federal Shield&quot;), which overlaps with up to one fifth of the black and gold bands. The is a variant of the coat of arms of Germany, whose main differences are the illustration of the eagle and the shape of the shield: the is rounded at the base, whereas the standard coat of arms is pointed.

The government flag may only be used by federal government authorities and its use by others is an offence, punishable with a fine. However, public use of flags similar to the (e.g. using the actual coat of arms instead of the ) is tolerated, and such flags are sometimes seen at international sporting events.

=== Vertical flags ===
In addition to the normal horizontal format, many public buildings in Germany use vertical flags. Most town halls fly their town flag together with the national flag (and usually the flag of the state they are in and the flag of the European Union) in this way; many town flags in Germany exist only in vertical form. The proportions of these vertical flags are not specified. In 1996, a layout for the vertical version of the government flag was established, that coincidentally matched the pattern of the &quot;conventional&quot; black-red-gold flag of the Principality of Reuss-Gera () from 1806 to 1918: the is displayed in the centre of the flag, overlapping with up to one fifth of the black and gold bands. When hung like a banner or draped, the black band should be on the left, as illustrated. When flown from a vertical flagpole, the black band must face the staff. The only type of vertical flag that can be flown under the Federal Government Decree is a banner. Flags in vertical format, vertical flags with outrigger and hanging flags are not permitted.

=== Military flags ===
Since the German armed forces () are a federal authority, the is also used as the German war flag on land. In 1956, the (Flag of the German Navy) was introduced: the government flag ending in swallowtail. This naval flag is also used as a navy jack.
== Design ==

Article 22 of the German constitution, the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, states:

The federal flag shall be black, red and gold.

Following specifications set by the West German government in 1950, the flag displays three bars of equal width and has a width–length ratio of 3:5; the tricolour used during the Weimar Republic had a ratio of 2:3.

At the time of the adoption of the flag there were no exact colour specifications other than &quot;Black-Red-Gold&quot;. However on 2 June 1999, the federal cabinet introduced a corporate design for the German government which defined the specifications of the official colours as:


The flag is blazoned in English as, &quot;Tierced in fess sable, gules and or.&quot;

=== Colour ===
Vexillology rarely distinguishes between gold and yellow; in heraldry, they are both &quot;Or&quot;. For the German flag, such a distinction is made: the colour used in the flag is called gold, not yellow.

When the black–red–gold tricolour was adopted by the Weimar Republic as its flag, it was attacked by conservatives, monarchists, and the far right, who referred to the colours with spiteful nicknames such as (black–red–yellow) or even (black–red–mustard). When the Nazis came to power in 1933, the black–white–red colours of pre-1918 Imperial Germany were swiftly reintroduced, and their propaganda machine continued to discredit the , using the same derogatory terms as previously used by the monarchists.

On 24 December 1951, the Federal Court of Justice () stated that the usage of &quot;black–red–yellow&quot; and the like had &quot;through years of Nazi agitation, attained the significance of a malicious slander against the democratic symbols of the state&quot; and was now an offence. As summarised by heraldist Arnold Rabbow in 1968, &quot;the German colours are black–red–yellow but they are called black–red–gold.&quot;

== Flag-flying days ==
There are a number of flag-flying days in Germany. Following federal decree on 22 March 2005, the flag must be flown from public buildings on the following dates. Only 1 May and 3 October are public holidays.

Election days for the Bundestag and the European Parliament are also flag days in some states, in addition to other state-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-staff), can be declared at the discretion of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. When flags are required to be flown at half-staff, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the staff (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag&#x27;s supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).

== History ==
=== Medieval period ===

The Holy Roman Empire (800/962 – 1806, known as the &quot;Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation&quot; after 1512) did not have a national flag, but black and gold were used as colours of the Holy Roman Emperor and featured in the imperial banner: a black eagle on a golden background. After the late 13th or early 14th century, the claws and beak of the eagle were coloured red. From the early 15th century, a double-headed eagle was used.The colours red and white were also significant during this period. When the Holy Roman Empire took part in the Crusades, a war flag was flown alongside the black-gold imperial banner. This flag, known as the &quot;Saint George Flag&quot;, was a white cross on a red background: the reverse of the St George&#x27;s Cross used as the flag of England, and similar to the flag of Denmark.Red and white were also colours of the Hanseatic League (13th–17th century). Hanseatic trading ships were identifiable by their red-white pennants, and most Hanseatic cities adopted red and white as their city colours (see Hanseatic flags). Red and white still feature as the colours of many former Hanseatic cities such as Hamburg or Bremen.

=== Principality of Reuss-Greiz ===
When Heinrich XI, Prince Reuss of Greiz was appointed by Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor to rule the then-new Principality of Reuss-Greiz on 12 May 1778, the flag adopted by the &quot;Fürstentum Reuß-Greiz&quot; was the first-ever appearance of the black-red-gold tricolour in its modern arrangement in any sovereign state within what today comprises Germany – the Reuss elder line that ruled the principality used a flag whose proportions were close to a &quot;nearly square&quot;-shape 4:5 hoist/fly ratio, instead of the modern German flag&#x27;s 3:5 figure.

=== Napoleonic Wars === 

In 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte declared the First French Empire. In response to this, Holy Roman Emperor Francis II of the Habsburg dynasty declared his personal domain to be the Austrian Empire and became Francis I of Austria. Taking the colours of the banner of the Holy Roman Emperor, the flag of the Austrian Empire was black and gold. Francis II was the last Holy Roman Emperor, with Napoleon forcing the empire&#x27;s dissolution in 1806. After this point, these colours continued to be used as the flag of Austria until 1918.

With the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, many of its dukes and princes joined the Confederation of the Rhine, a confederation of Napoleonic client states. These states preferred to use their own flags. The confederation had no flag of its own; instead it used the blue-white-red flag of France and the Imperial Standard of its protector, Napoleon.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the German struggle against the occupying French forces was significantly symbolised by the colours of black, red, and gold, which became popular after their use in the uniforms of the Lützow Free Corps, a volunteer unit of the Prussian Army. This unit had uniforms in black with red facings and gold buttons. The colour choice had pragmatic origins, even though black-red-gold were the former colours used by the Holy Roman Empire. At the time, the colours represented:
Members of the corps were required to supply their own clothing: in order to present a uniform appearance it was easiest to dye all clothes black. Gold-coloured buttons were widely available, and pennons used by the lancers in the unit were red and black. As the members of this unit came from all over Germany and included a modest but well known number of university students and academics, the Lützow Free Corps and their colours gained considerable exposure among the German people. 

=== German Confederation ===

The 1815–16 Congress of Vienna led to the creation of the German Confederation, a loose union of all remaining German states after the Napoleonic Wars. The Confederation was created as a replacement for the now-extinct Holy Roman Empire, with Francis I of Austria—the last Holy Roman Emperor—as its president. The confederation did not have a flag of its own, although the black-red-gold tricolour is sometimes mistakenly attributed to it.

Upon returning from the war, veterans of the Lützow Free Corps founded the fraternity in Jena in June 1815. The Jena eventually adopted a flag with three equal horizontal bands of red, black, and red, with gold trim and a golden oak branch across the black band, following the colours of the uniforms of the Free Corps. The famous gymnast and student union (&quot;&quot;) founder Friedrich Ludwig Jahn proposed a black-red-gold banner for the Burschen. Some members interpreted the colours as a rebirth of the Imperial black-yellow colours embellished with the red of liberty or the blood of war. More radical students exclaimed that the colours stood for the black night of slavery, the bloody struggle for liberty, and the golden dawn of freedom. In a memoir, Anton Probsthan of Mecklenburg, who served in the Lützow Free Corps, claimed his relative Fraulein Nitschke of Jena presented the Burschenschaft with a flag at the time of its foundation, and for this purpose chose the black-red-and-gold colours of the defunct secret society &quot;Vandalia&quot;.
Since the students who served in the Lützow Free Corps came from various German states, the idea of a unified German state began to gain momentum within the and similar Burschenschaft that were subsequently formed throughout the Confederation. On 18 October 1817, the fourth anniversary of the Battle of Leipzig, hundreds of fraternity members and academics from across the Confederation states met in Wartburg in Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (in modern Thuringia), calling for a free and unified German nation.

The gold-red-black flag of the Jena featured prominently at this Wartburg festival. Therefore, the colours black, red, and gold eventually became symbolic of this desire for a unified German state. The Ministerial Council of the German Confederation, in its determination to maintain the status quo, enacted the Carlsbad Decrees of 1819 that banned all student organisations, officially putting an end to the .

In May 1832, around 30,000 people demonstrated at the Hambach Festival for freedom, unity, and civil rights. The colours black, red, and gold had become a well established symbol for the liberal, democratic and republican movement within the German states since the Wartburg Festival, and flags in these colours were flown en masse at the Hambach Festival. While contemporary illustrations showed prominent use of a gold-red-black tricolour (an upside-down version of the modern German flag), surviving flags from the event were in black-red-gold. Such an example is the , the flag flown from Hambach Castle during the festival: a black-red-gold tricolour where the red band contains the inscription (Germany&#x27;s rebirth). This flag is now on permanent display at the castle.

=== Revolution and the Frankfurt Parliament ===
In the Springtime of the Peoples during the Revolutions of 1848, revolutionaries took to the streets, many flying the tricolour. The Confederation&#x27;s Bundestag, alarmed by the events, hasted to adopt the tricolour (9 March 1848). Liberals took power and made the Bundestag call for general elections for a German parliament, the national assembly. This Frankfurt Parliament declared the black-red-gold as the official colours of Germany and passed a law stating its civil ensign was the black-red-yellow tricolour. Also, a naval war ensign used these colours.
In May 1849, the larger states actively fought the revolution and the Frankfurt parliament. In late 1850, the German Confederation was definitely restored under Austrian-Prussian leadership. The tricolour remained official but was no longer used before 1863 at a conference of the German governments. Afterwards, the most pressing issue was whether or not to include Austria in any future German nation, as Austria&#x27;s status as a multi-ethnic empire complicated the dream of a united Greater Germany—the solution. Alternatively, there was the (Lesser German) solution for a Germany that encompassed only German lands and excluded Austria. The Prussian–Austrian duality within the Confederation eventually led to the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. During the war, the southern states allied with Austria adopted the black-red-gold tricolour as their flag, and the 8th German Army Corps also wore black-red-gold armbands. The Kingdom of Prussia and its predominately north German allies defeated Austria and made way for the realisation of the Lesser German solution a few years later. 

=== North German Confederation and the German Empire (1867–1918) ===

Following the dissolution of the German Confederation, Prussia formed its unofficial successor, the North German Confederation, in 1866 with the signing of the Confederation Treaty in August 1866 and then the ratification of the Constitution of 1867. This national state consisted of Prussia, the largest member state, and 21 other north German states.

The question regarding what flag should be adopted by the new confederation was first raised by the shipping sector and its desire to have an internationally recognisable identity. Virtually all international shipping that belonged to the confederation originated from either Prussia or the three Hanseatic city-states of Bremen, Hamburg, and Lübeck. Based on this, Adolf Soetbeer, secretary of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, suggested in the on 22 September 1866 that any planned flag should combine the colours of Prussia (black and white) with the Hanseatic colours (red and white). In the following year, the constitution of the North German Confederation was enacted, where a horizontal black-white-red tricolour was declared to be both the civil and war ensign.

King Wilhelm I of Prussia was satisfied with the colour choice: the red and white were also taken to represent the Margraviate of Brandenburg, the Imperial elector state that was a predecessor of the Kingdom of Prussia. The absence of gold from the flag also made it clear that this German state did not include the &quot;black and gold&quot; monarchy of Austria. In the Franco-Prussian War, the remaining southern German states allied with the North German Confederation, leading to the unification of Germany. A new constitution of 1871 gave the federal state the new name of German Empire and the Prussian king the title of Emperor. The German Empire retained black, white, and red as its national colours. An ordinance of 1892 dealt with the official use of the colours.

The black-white-red tricolour remained the flag of Germany until the end of the German Empire in 1918, in the final days of World War I.

A visually near-identical flag was used as the national flag of the Republic of Upper Volta, adopted upon the country&#x27;s independence in 1958 and used until 1984, when the nation was overthrown and re-established as Burkina Faso.

=== Weimar Republic (1918–1933) ===
Following the declaration of the German republic in 1918 and the ensuing revolutionary period, the so-called Weimar Republic was founded in August 1919. To form a continuity between the anti-autocratic movement of the 19th century and the new democratic republic, the old black-red-gold tricolour was designated as the national German flag in the Weimar Constitution in 1919. Only the tiny German principalities of Reuss-Greiz – where the use and layout of the &quot;schwarz-rot-gold&quot; design had originated some 140 years earlier, Reuss-Gera, Waldeck-Pyrmont and its republican successor had upheld the 1778-established tradition, and had always continued to use the German colours of black, red, and or (gold) in their flag. As a civil ensign, the black-white-red tricolour was retained, albeit with the new tricolour in the top left corner.

This change was not welcomed by many people in Germany, who saw this new flag as a symbol of humiliation following Germany&#x27;s defeat in the First World War. In the , the old colours continued to be used in various forms. Many conservatives wanted the old colours to return, while monarchists and the far right were far more vocal with their objections, referring to the new flag with various derogatory names (&quot;see Colour above&quot;). As a compromise, the old black-white-red flag was reintroduced in 1922 to represent German diplomatic missions abroad.

The symbols of Imperial Germany became symbols of monarchist and nationalist protest and were often used by monarchist and nationalist organisations (e.g. &quot;Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten&quot;). This included the (war flag of the Reich), which has been revived in the present for similar use. Many nationalist political parties during the Weimar period—such as the German National People&#x27;s Party (see poster) and the National Socialist German Workers Party (Nazi Party)—used the imperial colours, a practice that has continued today with the National Democratic Party of Germany.

On 24 February 1924, the organisation was founded in Magdeburg by the member parties of the Weimar Coalition (Centre, DDP, SPD) and the trade unions. This organisation was formed to protect the fragile democracy of the Weimar Republic, which was under constant pressure by both the far right and far left. Through this organisation, the black-red-gold flag became not only a symbol of German democracy, but also of resistance to political extremism. This was summarised by the organisation&#x27;s first chairman, Otto Hörsing, who described their task as a &quot;struggle against the swastika and the Soviet star&quot;.

In the face of the increasingly violent conflicts between the communists and Nazis, the growing polarisation of the German population and a multitude of other factors, mainly the drastic economic sinking, extreme hyperinflation and corruption of the republic, the Weimar Republic collapsed in 1933 with the Nazi seizure of power () and the appointment of Adolf Hitler as German chancellor.

=== Nazi Germany and World War II (1933–1945) ===



After Adolf Hitler was appointed chancellor on 30 January 1933 the black-red-gold flag was banned; a ruling on 12 March established two legal flags: the reintroduced black-white-red imperial tricolour national flag and the flag of the Nazi Party.

On 15 September 1935, one year after the death of Reich President Paul von Hindenburg and Hitler&#x27;s elevation to the position of &quot;Führer&quot;, the dual flag arrangement was ended, with the exclusive use of the Nazi flag as the national flag of Germany. One reason may have been the &quot;&quot;Bremen&quot; incident&quot; of 26 July 1935, in which a group of demonstrators in New York City boarded the ocean liner SS &quot;Bremen&quot;, tore the Nazi Party flag from the jackstaff, and tossed it into the Hudson River. When the German ambassador protested, US officials responded that the German national flag had not been harmed, only a political party symbol. The new flag law was announced at the annual party rally in Nuremberg, where Hermann Göring claimed the old black-white-red flag, while honoured, was the symbol of a bygone era and under threat of being used by &quot;reactionaries&quot;.

The design of the Nazi flag was introduced by Hitler as the party flag in mid-1920, roughly a year before he became his political party&#x27;s leader: a flag with a red background, a white disk and a black swastika in the middle. In &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, Hitler explained the process by which the Nazi flag design was created: It was necessary to use the same colours as Imperial Germany, because in Hitler&#x27;s opinion they were &quot;revered colours expressive of our homage to the glorious past and which once brought so much honour to the German nation.&quot; The most important requirement was that &quot;the new flag ... should prove effective as a large poster&quot; because &quot;in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement.&quot; Nazi propaganda clarified the symbolism of the flag: the red colour stood for the social, white for the movement&#x27;s national thinking, and the swastika for the victory of Aryan humanity.

An off-centred disk version of the swastika flag was used as the civil ensign on German-registered civilian ships and was used as the jack on (the name of the German Navy, 1933–1945) warships. The flags for use on sea had a through and through image, so the reverse side had a &quot;left-facing&quot; swastika; the national flag was right-facing on both sides.

From 1933 to at least 1938, the Nazis sometimes &quot;sanctified&quot; swastika flags by touching them with the (blood flag), the swastika flag used by Nazi paramilitaries during the failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. This ceremony took place at every Nuremberg Rally. It is unknown whether this tradition was continued after the last Nuremberg rally in 1938.

At the end of World War II, the first law enacted by the Allied Control Council abolished all Nazi symbols and repealed all relevant laws. The possession of swastika flags is forbidden in several countries since then, with the importation or display of them forbidden particularly in Germany.

=== After World War II (1945–1949) ===

After the defeat of Germany in World War II, the country was placed under Allied administration. Although there was neither a national German government nor a German flag, German ships were required by international law to have a national ensign of some kind. As a provisional civil ensign of Germany, the Council designated the international signal pennant Charlie representing the letter C ending in a swallowtail, known as the C-Pennant (). The Council ruled that &quot;no ceremony shall be accorded this flag which shall not be dipped in salute to warships or merchant ships of any nationality&quot;. Similarly, the Japanese civil ensign used immediately following World War II was the signal pennant for the letter E ending in a swallowtail, and the Ryūkyūan civil ensign was a swallowtailed letter D signal pennant. 

West of the Oder–Neisse line, the German states were reorganised along the lines of the zones of occupation, and new state governments were established. Within the American zone, the northern halves of the former states of Württemberg and Baden were merged to form Württemberg-Baden in 1946. As its flag, Württemberg-Baden adopted the black-red-gold tricolour. The choice of these colours was not based on the historical use of the tricolour, but the simple addition of gold to Württemberg&#x27;s colours of red and black. Coincidentally, Baden&#x27;s colours were red and yellow, so the colour choice could be mistaken for a combination of the two flags. In 1952, Württemberg-Baden became part of the modern German state of Baden-Württemberg, whose flag is black and gold.

Two other states that were created after the war, Rhineland-Palatinate (French zone) and Lower Saxony (British zone), chose to use the black-red-gold tricolour as their flag, defaced with the state&#x27;s coat of arms. These two states were formed from parts of other states, and no colour combinations from these previous states were accepted as a new state flag. This led to the use of the black-red-gold for two reasons: the colours did not relate particularly to any one of the previous states, and using the old flag from the Weimar Republic was intended to be a symbol of the new democracy.

=== Divided Germany (1949–1990) ===

With relations deteriorating between the Soviet Union and the United States, the three western Allies met in March 1948 to merge their zones of occupation and allow the formation of what became the Federal Republic of Germany, commonly known as West Germany. Meanwhile, the eastern Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic, commonly known as East Germany.
During the preparation of the new constitution for West Germany, discussions regarding its national symbols took place in August 1948 during a meeting at Herrenchiemsee. Although there were objections to the creation of a national flag before reunification with the east, it was decided to proceed. This decision was primarily motivated by the proposed constitution by the eastern SED in November 1946, where black-red-gold were suggested as the colours for a future German republic.

=== Proposed designs ===

While there were other suggestions for the new flag for West Germany, the final choice was between two designs, both using black-red-gold. The Social Democrats proposed the re-introduction of the old Weimar flag, while the conservative parties such as the CDU/CSU and the German Party proposed a suggestion by Josef Wirmer, a member of the (parliamentary council) and future advisor of chancellor Konrad Adenauer. Wirmer suggested a variant of the 1944 &quot;Resistance&quot; flag (using the black-red-gold scheme in a Nordic Cross pattern) designed by his brother and 20 July co-conspirator Josef. The tricolour was ultimately selected, largely to illustrate the continuity between the Weimar Republic and this new German state. With the enactment of the (West) German constitution on 23 May 1949, the black-red-gold tricolour was readopted as the flag for the Federal Republic of Germany.

In 1955, the inhabitants of the French-administered Saar Protectorate voted to join West Germany. Since its establishment as a separate French protectorate in 1947, the Saar had a white Nordic cross on a blue and red background as its flag. To demonstrate the commitment of the Saar to be a part of West Germany, a new flag was selected on 9 July 1956: the black-red-gold tricolour defaced with the new coat of arms, also proposed on this day. This flag came into force on 1 January 1957, upon the establishment of the Saarland as a state of West Germany.

While the use of black-red-gold had been suggested in the Soviet zone in 1946, the Second People&#x27;s Congress in 1948 decided to adopt the old black-white-red tricolour as a national flag for East Germany. This choice was based on the use of these colours by the National Committee for a Free Germany, a German anti-Nazi organisation that operated in the Soviet Union in the last two years of the war. In 1949, following a suggestion from Friedrich Ebert, Jr., the black-red-gold tricolour was instead selected as the flag of the German Democratic Republic upon the formation of this state on 7 October 1949. From 1949 to 1959, the flags of both West and East Germany were identical. On 1 October 1959, the East German government changed its flag with the addition of its coat of arms. In West Germany, these changes were seen as a deliberate attempt to divide the two Germanies. Displaying this flag in West Germany and West Berlin—where it became known as the (divider-flag)—was seen as a breach of the constitution and subsequently banned until the late 1960s.

From 1956 to 1964, West and East Germany attended the Winter and Summer Olympic Games as a single team, known as the United Team of Germany. After the East German national flag was changed in 1959, neither country accepted the flag of the other. As a compromise, a new flag was used by the United Team of Germany from 1960 to 1964, featuring the black-red-gold tricolour defaced with white Olympic rings in the red stripe. In 1968 the teams from the two German states entered separately, but both used the same German Olympic flag. From 1972 to 1988, the separate West and East German teams used their respective national flags.

=== 1990–present ===

After the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, many East Germans removed the coat of arms from their flags to imply the plain black-red-gold tricolour symbolic of a united Germany. The widespread act of removing the coat of arms from the East German flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. Finally, on 3 October 1990, as the area of the German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany, the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a reunified Germany. In 1998, the Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to the federal government, is to examine the consequences of the former East German regime. As its logo, the foundation used an East German flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.
The old black-white-red tricolour of the German Empire is still used by monarchists and those members of German royalty who long for the peaceful reintroduction of a German democratic monarchy. This use of the old flag is almost completely overshadowed by its prevalent use by the far right, however; since the aforementioned ban on all Nazi symbolism (e.g. the swastika), the &quot;Schutzstaffel&#x27;s&quot; (SS) double sig rune, etc.) is still in effect within today&#x27;s Germany, the far right have been forced to forgo any Nazi flags and instead use the old imperial flag, which the Nazis themselves banned in 1935.In Germany, the use of the flag and other national symbols has been relatively low for most of the time since World War II – a reaction against the widespread use of flags by the Nazi Party and against nationalistic fervour in general. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Germany and in which the Germany national team made a deep run into the knockout rounds (being eliminated in the semi-finals by eventual winners Italy), public use of the national flag increased drastically. This explosion in the flag&#x27;s occurrence in day-to-day life was initially greeted by many Germans with a mixture of surprise and apprehension. The decades-old fear that German flag-waving and national pride was inextricably associated with its Nazi past was dismissed by the end of the tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike. As many Germans regarded showing their flag as part of support for their own team in the tournament, most flags disappeared after the end of a tournament, sometimes due to administrative decisions.
By the time of Germany&#x27;s World Cup victory in 2014, usage of the German flag had been increasing sporadically. In the following period the display of the German flag colours, even outside stadiums, was regularly limited to the period of major sporting events.

With the rise of nationalist currents, however, (Pegida, AfD, etc.) and their showing of the German flag as a symbol of their nationalism, the flag again became more widespread but remained somewhat contentious in everyday life. Mainstream society remains hesitant to use the colours.

<text>Merrill C. Meigs Field Airport (pronounced , formerly ) was a single-runway airport in Chicago, named for newspaper publisher and aviation enthusiast Merrill C. Meigs. It was located on Northerly Island, an artificial peninsula in Lake Michigan, and was operational from 1948 to 2003.

Constructed to accommodate demand for general aviation following World War II, Meigs Field also served regional commercial air travel. With its proximity to downtown Chicago, it quickly became the busiest single-strip airport in the United States, adding an air traffic tower in 1952, and a terminal in 1961. It became widely familiar when it was featured as the default airport in early versions of the &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; software. Seeking to repurpose the land as a park, mayor Richard M. Daley forced its abrupt closure in 2003 by ordering the overnight destruction of its runway.

== History ==

=== Construction ===
Northerly Island, owned by the Chicago Park District, is the only lakefront structure to be built based on Daniel Burnham&#x27;s 1909 Plan of Chicago. The Plan of Chicago had no provision for air service. The island was to be populated by trees and grass for the public enjoyment by all. Northerly Island was also the site of the Century of Progress (1933–34) in Chicago. Chicago&#x27;s first airplane flight took place in 1910 in Grant Park, adjacent to Northerly Island, with an international aeronautical exhibition at the same location in 1911. Then, in 1918, regular air mail service to Grant Park began. Nonetheless, Grant Park was unsuitable for the city&#x27;s growing aviation needs.

Burnham died in 1912. By 1916, Edward H. Bennett, co-author of the Plan of Chicago, wrote that a lakefront location would be most suitable for an airport serving the central business district. In 1920, Chicagoans approved a bond referendum to pay for landfill construction of the peninsula, and in 1922 construction began. That same year Mayor William Hale Thompson recommended locating the downtown airport there. A few years later the Chicago South Park Commission voted in agreement. In 1928, the Chicago Association of Commerce, representing the business community, also advocated for the lakefront airport.

The Great Depression put numerous civic plans on hold, including the airport. Construction continued on the peninsula itself, with the 1933 World&#x27;s Fair occupying the just-completed peninsula. In the 1930s, the Chicago City Council and Illinois State Legislature passed resolutions to create the airport, but both the poor economy and World War II intervened.

=== Operations ===


Almost immediately after World War II, in 1946, airport construction began. That same year the Illinois state legislature deeded of adjacent lake bottom to Chicago for additional landfill, to make the property large enough for a suitable runway. Aviation technology had advanced rapidly during World War II. The airport opened on December 10, 1948, in a grand ceremony.

On June 30, 1950, the airport was officially renamed Merrill C. Meigs Field, named after Merrill C. Meigs, publisher of the &quot;Chicago Herald and Examiner&quot; and an aviation advocate. Various improvements took place over the years, including the 1952 opening of an air traffic control tower, the 1961 opening of a new terminal building (dedicated by Richard J. Daley), runway lengthening, and the late 1990s charting of two FAA instrument approaches allowing landings in poor weather conditions. By the 1970s Meigs Field became a critical facility for aeromedical transport of patients and transplant organs to downtown hospitals as medical transportation technology modernized. Corporate aircraft also used the airfield including Cessna Citation and Dassault Falcon 10 business jets, and Beechcraft King Air and Grumman Gulfstream I business propjets.

The Main Terminal Building was operated by the Chicago Department of Aviation and contained waiting areas as well as office and counter space. The runway at Meigs Field was nearly . In addition, there were four public helicopter pads at the south end of the runway, near McCormick Place. The north end of the runway was near the Adler Planetarium.

Meigs Field also provided commuter airline service to the public, peaking in the late 1980s as Mayor Richard M. Daley took office. During the mid-1950s, Illini Airlines was operating scheduled passenger service between the airport and Freeport, IL, Madison, WI, Rockford, IL and Sterling, IL with de Havilland Dove and Piper Navajo twin engine prop aircraft. From the 1960s to early 1990s, typical intrastate destinations were Springfield, IL and Carbondale, IL. Small airliners such as Beechcraft Model 99, Beechcraft 1900C, de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and Fairchild Swearingen Metro III turboprops as well as Piper PA-31 Navajo prop aircraft were operated on a scheduled basis into the airport. In 1968, Gopher Airlines was operating nonstop service between the airport and Minneapolis/St. Paul with Beechcraft 99 turboprops. In the mid- and late 1970s Air Illinois operated 44-passenger seat Hawker Siddeley HS 748 turboprops into Meigs. The HS 748 was the largest aircraft to use Meigs on a regular basis for scheduled passenger airline operations. Ozark Air Lines, a large local service airline in the midwest that primarily operated McDonnell Douglas DC-9 jets and Fairchild Hiller FH-227B propjets at the time, served the airport during the early 1970s with DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops with up to eight round trip nonstop flights a day between Meigs and the Illinois state capital in Springfield. Other commuter air carriers serving Meigs Field in 1975 included Midwest Commuter Airways with nonstop flights to Indianapolis and South Bend, and Skystream Airlines with nonstops to Detroit City Airport with both small airlines operating Beechcraft 99 commuter turboprops.

Scheduled passenger helicopter airline service was also available between Meigs Field and Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport and Chicago Midway Airport at different times over the years. From the late 1950s to late 1960s, Chicago Helicopter Airways operated 12-seat Sikorsky S-58C helicopters with frequent flights to both O&#x27;Hare and Midway.

Numerous VIPs used the airport in order to maintain security and also to avoid inconveniencing the Chicago traveling public, including President John F. Kennedy. In a common pattern, Air Force One would land at a larger area airport, and the President would then take the Marine One helicopter to Meigs Field to avoid the complications of a Secret Service escort via Chicago&#x27;s expressways.

On October 15, 1992, a Boeing 727-100 jetliner donated from United Airlines to the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry made its final landing at Meigs, on its way to be transported to the museum to become an exhibit. This was notable because Meigs&#x27; runway was considerably shorter than other airfields the aircraft normally used. Still, the lightly loaded jet did not require all of the runway. The 727 was then barged off the airport, prepared for exhibit and further barged to the museum.

Starting in the early 1990s, the Chicago-area Tuskegee Airmen, Inc provided free airplane rides every month and aviation education to Chicago youth at Meigs Field. Thousands of children took their first airplane rides there until 2003.

=== Historical airline service ===
The following are the main air carriers that operated scheduled passenger service from Meigs Field to Springfield, IL:

* 1970–1983: Air Illinois flew the 44-seat Hawker Siddeley HS 748 turboprop, the largest aircraft regularly scheduled into Meigs.
* 1984–1985: Mississippi Valley Airlines
* 1984–1991: Britt Airways (In 1986 began dba Continental Express operating code share service for Continental Airlines).
* 1988–1995: Trans States Airlines (dba Trans World Express operating code share service for TWA).
* 1991–2001: Great Lakes Airlines (In 1992 began dba United Express operating code share service for United Airlines).

Smaller carriers that briefly provided service from Meigs to other cities include:

* Blade Helicopters
* Chicago Helicopter Airways
* Gopher Airlines
* Hub Airlines
* Illini Airlines
* Midwest Commuter Airways
* Ozark Air Lines
* Skystream Airlines

According to the February 1, 1976, edition of the Official Airline Guide (OAG), two airlines were serving Meigs Field at this time: Air Illinois and Skystream Airlines. Air Illinois was operating the 44-seat HS-748 turboprop into the airport at this time with nonstop flights to Springfield, IL and continuing no change of plane service to Alton, IL and Carbondale, IL. Skystream Airlines was operating Beechcraft 99 commuter turboprops on a nonstop and direct flights to Detroit Metro Airport, Indianapolis, IN and South Bend, IN.

The September 15, 1994, edition of the OAG reported that three air carriers were serving Meigs Field with scheduled passenger flights: Great Lakes Aviation operating as United Express on behalf of United Airlines, Trans States Airlines flying as Trans World Express on behalf of Trans World Airlines (TWA) and Blade Helicopters. Great Lakes was operating Beechcraft 1900C turboprops on its nonstop service to Lansing, MI, and Springfield, IL and was also flying one stop direct service to Quincy, IL. Trans States served Springfield, IL nonstop with Swearingen Metro III propjets. Blade Helicopters was operating Eurocopter AS350 &quot;AStar&quot; turbine powered helicopters on a high frequency shuttle schedule with 39 flights every weekday to Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport and 12 flights every weekday to Chicago Midway Airport.

===Demolition and closure===
In 1994, Mayor Richard M. Daley announced plans to close the airport and build a park in its place. Northerly Island, where the airport was located, was owned by the Chicago Park District, which refused to renew the airport lease in 1996. The city briefly closed the airport from the expiration of the lease in October 1996 through February 1997, when pressure from the state legislature persuaded them to reopen the airport.

On the night of March 30, 2003, Mayor Daley ordered city crews to make the runway unusable by bulldozing large X-shaped gouges into the runway surface in the middle of the night. This resulted in several aircraft being stranded on the ground at the airport; these were later allowed to depart from Meigs&#x27; taxiway.

&quot;To do this any other way would have been needlessly contentious,&quot; Mayor Daley claimed at a news conference on March 31. Daley defended his actions by claiming it would save the City of Chicago the effort of further court battles before the airport could close. He claimed the closure was due to safety concerns, in particular the post-September 11 risk of terrorist-controlled aircraft attacking the downtown waterfront near Meigs Field.

&quot;The signature act of Richard Daley&#x27;s 22 years in office was the midnight bulldozing of Meigs Field,&quot; according to &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Eric Zorn. &quot;He ruined Meigs because he wanted to, because he could,&quot; columnist John Kass wrote of Daley in the &quot;Tribune&quot;.

While aviation interests and commentators decried the move, supporters of the park believed it was in the city&#x27;s best interest for the land to be a park. For example, the Lake Michigan Federation (later the Alliance for the Great Lakes) released in February 2001 an urban wilderness plan for the site. Instead of calling it &quot;Northerly Island&quot; a reference to the northernmost landmass of four others that were never built under the 1909 Plan of Chicago, &quot;Sanctuary Point&quot; would allow access for many more people than the fairly exclusive use as an airstrip.

On July 28, 2003, an aircraft flying from Maine to the Experimental Aircraft Association Annual Convention in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, made an emergency landing on the grass next to the demolished Meigs Field runway. Mayor Daley accused the pilot of intentionally landing in order to &quot;embarrass&quot; him, despite the FAA&#x27;s statement that the pilot &quot;did the correct thing&quot; in landing the plane at Meigs.

Interest groups, led by the Friends of Meigs Field, attempted to use the courts to reopen Meigs Field over the following months, but because the airport was owned by the City of Chicago and had paid back its federal aviation grants, the courts ruled that Chicago was allowed to close the field. The FAA fined the city $33,000 for closing an airport with a charted instrument approach without giving the required 30-day notice. This was the maximum fine the law allowed at the time. In the aftermath, the &quot;Meigs Legacy provision&quot; was passed into law, increasing the maximum fine per day from $1,100 to $10,000. On September 17, 2006, the city dropped all legal appeals and agreed to pay the $33,000 fine as well as repay $1 million in FAA Airport Improvement Program funds that it used to demolish the airfield and build Northerly Island Park.

== Northerly Island ==

By August 2003, construction crews had finished the demolition of Meigs Field. Northerly Island is now a park that features prairie grasses, strolling paths and a giant pond. In 2005, the 7,500 seat Huntington Bank Pavilion, which hosts music concerts in the summer, opened on the site. The island also has a modest beach named 12th Street Beach.

Other Chicagoans had a different vision for the lakefront area. After the 2003 closure, the Friends of Meigs Field introduced a new plan, &quot;Parks and Planes,&quot; which promoted the idea of an aviation museum, small operating runway, and park land on the property. This plan suggested that Chicago could qualify for federal funds earmarked for airport property acquisition to purchase many more acres of parkland in Chicago&#x27;s neighborhoods and to improve the Chicago Park District&#x27;s maintenance budget.

== In media ==
Meigs was the default airport for the &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; series until &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004&quot;, though the airport remains operational in &quot;Flight Simulator 2004&quot;. In &quot;Flight Simulator X&quot;, it was completely removed from the scenery, until the Steam Edition of the game added it as downloadable content in 2015. Third party add-ons such as &quot;FTX Merrill C. Meigs Field&quot; or &quot;Aerosoft&#x27;s US Cities X – Chicago&quot; are available to add Meigs back in, while others close or remove the airport for previous versions of the game. Meigs was absent in the initial version 2020 version of Microsoft Flight Simulator; it was added as part of the 40th anniversary update, which released on November 11, 2022. and third-party add-ons are available to include the airport and others, like Hong Kong&#x27;s Kai Tak Airport, which have been previously demolished. 
The airport is still present in many versions of &quot;X-Plane&quot; and players are able to land and takeoff from the well known runway 27.

In &quot;Need for Speed: ProStreet&quot; released by Electronic Arts in 2007, the Meigs field appears named as Chicago Airfield, and the player can drive around and race in a modified festival inspired closed race track built around the airstrip. It is available to race only in Grip, Time Attack, Sector Shootout, Grip Class, Drift, Wheelie Competition, 1/4 Mile Drag and 1/2 Mile Drag races.

In &quot;Midtown Madness&quot; released by Microsoft in 1999, the player is free to drive around a computer-generated version of Meigs Field, as well as in &quot;Driver 2&quot;, released in 2000 by Reflections.

Meigs Field was seen in the Season 4 &quot;Knight Rider&quot; season premiere &quot;Knight of the Juggernaut&quot;.

<doc id="70780" wikidata="Q410892" url="?curid=70780" title="U.S. Route 101">
<text>U.S. Route 101, or U.S. Highway 101 (US 101), is a major north–south highway that traverses the states of California, Oregon, and Washington on the West Coast of the United States. It is part of the United States Numbered Highway System and runs for over along the Pacific Ocean. The highway is also known by various names, including El Camino Real in parts of California, the Oregon Coast Highway, and the Olympic Highway in Washington. Despite its three-digit number, normally used for spur routes, US 101 is classified as a primary route.

The highway&#x27;s southern terminus is at a major interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5) and I-10 in Los Angeles. US 101 follows several freeways in Southern California as it travels north of the Santa Monica Mountains and along the coast, where it is concurrent with California State Route 1 (SR 1). The highway travels inland from the coast after it splits from SR 1 and approaches the San Francisco Bay Area, where it becomes the Bayshore Freeway and later traverses San Francisco on city streets to reach the Golden Gate Bridge. US 101 continues north on the Redwood Highway and rejoins the coast before it enters Oregon.

The Oregon Coast Highway carries US 101 through the state&#x27;s coastal towns and regions in the foothills of the Oregon Coast Range. The highway crosses over the Columbia River on the Astoria–Megler Bridge into Washington, where it follows Willapa Bay and an inland route to Aberdeen and Olympic National Park. US 101 travels north and east around the Olympic Peninsula and reaches its northernmost point in Port Angeles; from there, it travels east and later south to its northern terminus at I-5 in Tumwater, near Olympia. Several portions of the highway are also designated as scenic byways, including the Pacific Coast Scenic Byway in Washington; US 101 also serves three national parks: Pinnacles, Redwood, and Olympic.

The highway is a major north–south link along the Pacific coast north of San Francisco but does not serve the largest cities in Oregon and Washington; that role is instead filled by I-5, which has a more direct inland routing. US 101 was established in 1926 and followed several historic routes, including El Camino Real, which linked California&#x27;s early Spanish missions, pueblos, and presidios. It originally terminated to the south in San Diego but was truncated to Los Angeles in 1964 after the construction of I-5. Other sections were later moved to freeway alignments that bypassed cities. Several sections of US 101 in Washington and Oregon were rebuilt in the mid-20th century to eliminate curves and address traffic congestion. Later projects expanded the Bayshore Freeway in the San Francisco Bay Area and relocated sections of the highway in Oregon in response to landslides and erosion.

US 101 is a major highway that generally follows the Pacific Ocean through the West Coast states of California, Oregon, and Washington. It spans over from its southern terminus in Los Angeles to its northern terminus near Olympia, Washington. US 101 generally runs parallel to I-5, which serves most of the West Coast&#x27;s largest cities and is designated for long-haul freight. The corridor is also designated as part of U.S. Bicycle Route 95 (USBR 95) in Northern California and is proposed to be part of USBR 40 and USBR 97 in Washington.

The highway is known by several names that vary between the states. In California, portions of US 101 are part of the Santa Ana Freeway, Hollywood Freeway, Ventura Freeway, Bayshore Freeway, and Redwood Highway. In Oregon, it is officially the Oregon Coast Highway No. 9 under the named highways system and part of the Pacific Coast Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway. In Washington, it is officially part of the Pacific Coast Scenic Byway, a state scenic highway. In Southern California, US 101 is commonly called &quot;the 101&quot; (pronounced &quot;the one oh one&quot;).

===California===

US 101 travels on several major freeways in the Greater Los Angeles area, including some of the most congested roads in the United States. Its southern terminus is in Boyle Heights at the East Los Angeles Interchange, one of the busiest freeway junctions in the United States, where US 101 meets I-5, I-10, and SR 60. The highway travels north on a section of the Santa Ana Freeway and turns west to cross the Los Angeles River after merging with the San Bernardino Freeway. The Santa Ana Freeway continues across Downtown Los Angeles and passes Union Station, a major transit hub, and government buildings before it reaches a junction with SR 110. Beyond Downtown Los Angeles, US 101 uses the Hollywood Freeway as it travels northwest through the eponymous neighborhood towards Cahuenga Pass, where it crosses the Hollywood Hills and passes Universal Studios Hollywood. The highway leaves the Hollywood Freeway to turn west onto the Ventura Freeway, which travels along the southern edge of the suburban San Fernando Valley and intersects I-405. US 101 continues into Ventura County, where it joins SR 1 and serves communities in the Conejo Valley and Oxnard Plain.

The highway follows the Pacific Ocean northwest from Ventura through Santa Barbara, where it separates the downtown from its beach, and Goleta. US 101 becomes a divided highway beyond Goleta as it turns north at Gaviota State Park to cross the Santa Ynez Mountains at Gaviota Pass; SR 1 splits to remain closer to the coastline, as it does in several areas of the state. The highway continues inland and travels around the Purisima Hills to reach Santa Maria, where the freeway resumes as it bypasses the city. US 101 briefly returns to the coastline near Pismo Beach and turns inland over the Irish Hills towards San Luis Obispo alongside SR 1. The highway crosses the Santa Lucia Range through Cuesta Pass and follows the Salinas River northwest through Atascadero and the wine-growing region surrounding Paso Robles. US 101 passes near Pinnacles National Park and travels through the city of Salinas, where it turns northeast to cross the Gabilan Range. From there, the highway descends into the Santa Clara Valley and Gilroy, the southernmost city in the San Francisco Bay Area.

US 101 continues northwest into San Jose on the South Valley Freeway and later the Bayshore Freeway, which travels around the east and north sides of downtown San Jose. The ten-lane freeway generally follows the west side of San Francisco Bay as it traverses several Silicon Valley communities, including Palo Alto, Redwood City, and San Mateo, and passes offices for high-tech companies. It parallels I-280, which travels along the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west, as the two continue up the San Francisco Peninsula. US 101 passes San Francisco International Airport and briefly turns northeast to rejoin the coastline before it enters the city of San Francisco near Candlestick Point. The Bayshore Freeway intersects I-280 and terminates at an interchange with I-80 near the SoMa neighborhood in the city center. US 101 then uses city streets to continue through San Francisco; it travels north on Van Ness Avenue, a wide boulevard with bus lanes, and west on Lombard Street to the Presidio of San Francisco, a historic landmark and city park.

The divided highway travels through the north side of the Presidio and tunnels under a portion of the park as it approaches the Golden Gate Bridge, a tolled suspension bridge across the Golden Gate at the entrance to San Francisco Bay. It is operated by the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District and is not legally defined as part of US 101 and SR 1. The orange-colored bridge, considered an icon of the city, has six lanes with a movable barrier and walkways on both sides for pedestrians and cyclists. North of the bridge, US 101 is designated as the Redwood Highway. It splits from SR 1 and continues as an eight-lane freeway through suburban communities in Marin County, including an elevated viaduct in downtown San Rafael. The highway continues along the west side of San Pablo Bay into Sonoma County, where it turns northwest to head inland through Petaluma and Santa Rosa in the North Bay&#x27;s Wine Country. US 101 follows the Russian River upstream through wineries and vineyards into Mendocino County as the freeway narrows to four lanes and eventually ends.

Beyond the San Francisco Bay Area, US 101 is primarily an undivided highway with some short freeway sections and serves as the primary route in the rugged North Coast region. It traverses the Mendocino Range and reaches the northern terminus of SR 1 at Leggett. The Redwood Highway then follows the South Fork Eel River north into Humboldt Redwoods State Park, where it runs parallel to the Avenue of the Giants. US 101 continues northwest along the Eel River to reach the coastline near Eureka, which it travels through on city streets before becoming a divided highway around Humboldt Bay. The highway travels north along the coast through the Redwood National and State Parks, where it passes through old-growth coast redwood forests, and reaches Crescent City. US 101 intersects US 199 north of the city and continues northwest along the coast to the Oregon state line.

===Oregon===

The Oregon Coast Highway begins at the California state line near Brookings and carries US 101 north along the Pacific coast. It is generally a two-lane highway that passes through small towns and near 77 state parks on the rugged coastline, as well as some inland areas. From Brookings, US 101 traverses the Samuel H. Boardman State Scenic Corridor, which includes roadside viewpoints and trailheads that face the ocean. The highway remains elevated from the coastline and briefly descends to sea level near the Pistol River State Scenic Viewpoint before climbing Cape Sebastian on its way to Gold Beach. US 101 travels through Gold Beach and crosses the Rogue River to continue north along the coast. The highway turns west to follow the base of Humbug Mountain, a mountain that rises from the Pacific Ocean, and northwest to reach Port Orford, where it leaves the coastline.

US 101 continues north, separated from the coastline by prairies and marshes, to Bandon; there, it briefly turns east and crosses the Coquille River to traverse more marshes. The highway travels further inland to the northeast and follows a slough off Coos Bay to the neighboring cities of Coos Bay and North Bend, where it splits into a pair of one-way streets. US 101 leaves North Bend and crosses Coos Bay on the Conde McCullough Memorial Bridge; from there, it heads north along the edge of a exposed coastal sand dune that forms the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, along with freshwater lakes to the east. US 101 diverts northeast to cross the Umpqua River at Reedsport and passes through a meandering section near Tahkenitch Lake before it returns to the coastal dunes around Dunes City.

The Oregon Coast Highway crosses the Siuslaw River into Florence and intersects Oregon Route 126 (OR 126), a major east–west route that traverses the Coast Range to Eugene. US 101 returns to the coastline near the Heceta Head Lighthouse and continues north along several high cliffs around Cape Perpetua and Yachats that overlook the beaches. The Oregon Coast Highway then crosses the Yaquina Bay Bridge into Newport and serves as the western terminus of US 20, a transcontinental route to Boston and the longest highway in the United States. US 101 continues along the coastline and Siletz Bay into Lincoln City, where it serves as the city&#x27;s main street for and turns away from the coast to bypass the Cascade Head biosphere reserve. The highway briefly returns to the coastline before beginning a long inland stretch that follows the Nestucca River and other streams to Tillamook.

US 101 passes the Tillamook County Creamery Association factory and travels northwest along Tillamook Bay to rejoin the coast near Garibaldi, but later turns inland to skirt Nehalem Bay and avoid Cape Falcon. The highway travels around the community of Cannon Beach, home to the landmark Haystack Rock, and turns northeast to bypass Tillamook Head and intersect US 26—a major route to Portland. US 101 continues north along the Necanicum River to reach the coast at Seaside and travel through the city and nearby beach communities. The highway turns northeast and crosses Youngs Bay from Warrenton to Astoria, where it meets the western terminus of US 30; that highway continues into downtown Astoria and east towards Portland. US 101 turns south onto a loop ramp that leads north to the Astoria–Megler Bridge, a bridge that spans the mouth of the Columbia River and carries the highway into Washington.

===Washington===

US 101 enters Washington state at the north end of the Astoria–Megler Bridge and immediately turns west to follow the Columbia River. The highway traverses Fort Columbia State Park in a tunnel and passes through Chinook on the north side of the river&#x27;s mouth towards Ilwaco, near Cape Disappointment. From Ilwaco, US 101 briefly travels north before turning east at Seaview, the southernmost city on the Long Beach Peninsula, and following Willapa Bay to a junction with State Route 4 (SR 4) on the Naselle River. The highway continues along the east side of the bay through South Bend to Raymond, where it travels inland to cross the forested Willapa Hills to reach Aberdeen. US 101 enters the city by crossing the Chehalis River and turns west onto a pair of one-way streets after an intersection with US 12.

The streets travel through western Aberdeen and neighboring Hoquiam, where the highway is split by the Hoquiam River, and rejoin north of downtown. The highway continues north along inland streams into the Quinault Indian Reservation, which it enters near Lake Quinault at the edge of Olympic National Park. US 101 circumnavigates the Olympic Peninsula and provides the main access to the national park and various sites via spur roads; there are no roads that cross the Olympic Mountains, which separate areas of the national park and adjacent Olympic National Forest. The highway turns west from Lake Quinault to reach the Pacific coastline, which it follows for between Queets and Ruby Beach within Olympic National Park. US 101 then heads northeast to follow the Hoh River upstream and intersects the main access road to the Hoh Rainforest. It then travels north through Forks and follows the Sol Duc River east to re-enter the national park.

US 101 travels along the southern shore of Lake Crescent, one of the deepest lakes in the state, and the foothills of the Olympic Mountains until it crosses the Elwha River near the site of the demolished Elwha Dam. The highway enters Port Angeles and uses city streets to reach the northernmost point of US 101, near the ferry terminal for the Black Ball Line to Victoria, British Columbia. The four-lane highway turns east to follow the Strait of Juan de Fuca through a rural prairie and becomes a super two expressway as it bypasses Sequim. US 101 dips south to travel around Sequim Bay and turns south to follow Discovery Bay to a junction with SR 20, which serves Port Townsend and the North Cascades.

The highway travels south and crosses a pass in the Olympic Mountains near Mount Walker before it reaches the west shore of Hood Canal, which it follows for more than . US 101 passes several state parks and additional access points for the national park, including Lake Cushman near Hoodsport. It leaves Hood Canal on the Skokomish Indian Reservation and continues south on a super two bypass around Shelton, where it intersects SR 3. US 101 then becomes a freeway and cuts across several inlets and bays of Puget Sound as it turns southeast towards the Olympia area. The freeway merges with SR 8 and continues southeast to reach its northern terminus at I-5 in Tumwater, near the Washington State Capitol campus in nearby Olympia.

The section between Lake Crescent and Sequim is generally signed east–west, while the section south of the intersection with SR 20 is signed north–south but turned 180 degrees. The direct route between Aberdeen and Olympia uses US 12 and SR 8, which complete the Olympic Loop Highway.

==Numbering==

According to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials&#x27;s (AASHTO) numbering scheme for United States Numbered Highways, three-digit route numbers are generally subsidiaries of two-digit primary routes. Of these two-digit routes, the principal north–south routes were assigned numbers ending in 1. US 101 is an exception to the three-digit rule due to its role as the westernmost major route; it is treated as a primary, two-digit route with a &quot;first digit&quot; of 10, rather than a spur of US 1, which is located along the east coast.

==History==

===Establishment and early development===
US 101 was established as part of the initial United States Numbered Highway System that was developed by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) in the 1920s. The preliminary plan recommended in 1925 had the highway terminate at San Diego in the south and in Port Angeles, Washington, to the north. The final plan extended US 101 within Washington around the east side of the Olympic Peninsula to Olympia and was adopted by the AASHO on November 11, 1926. The first section of US 101 to be signed in California was between San Diego and Los Angeles in January 1928, which was followed by the rest of the route later in the year.

Portions of the coastal highway had already been constructed by the respective state governments and also followed foot and wagon routes developed in earlier centuries. Among these was El Camino Real in California, which was formed by the Portolá expedition in 1769 and 1770 and connected the historic Spanish missions, pueblos, and presidios. The California state government chose a section of El Camino Real in San Bruno in 1912 to become the first paved highway in the state. The San Diego–San Francisco section of El Camino Real was incorporated into the multi-state Pacific Highway in the 1910s; other sections of US 101 in California used the existing Redwood Highway, which was constructed from 1917 to 1923, and Coast Highway.

Construction of the Oregon Coast Highway began in 1921, two years after a state referendum that voted in favor of funding the development of highways with a one-cent gas tax. At the time, several short wagon roads and plank roads connected settlements on the coast, and overland travel primarily used beaches. The highway was gradually constructed and paved in the 1920s, but a set of six ferry crossings remained. These ferries were operated by private companies until the state government acquired them in 1927 with plans to replace them with bridges. The five major Oregon bridges on US 101 were designed by state engineer Conde B. McCullough and opened by 1936 using funding from the federal government&#x27;s New Deal programs. As automobile traffic on the Oregon Coast increased, other sections were realigned to avoid rugged terrain or bypassed with tunnels. The Oregon Coast Highway was declared complete on October 3, 1936, and cost $25 million to construct (equivalent to $ in dollars).

Washington completed the final sections of the Olympic Loop Highway between 1927 and 1931 for $11 million (equivalent to $ in dollars). The project paved several existing sections of the state roads and also constructed of new highway from the Queets River to Ruby Beach near Kalaloch. Portions of US 101 passed through lands that were later incorporated into Olympic National Park when it was established in 1938; under the National Park Service, sections of the Crescent Lake Highway were widened and improved in 1949. The Washington State Highway Commission submitted an application to AASHO in 1955 to extend US 101 northeast from Discovery Bay to Whidbey Island and Mount Vernon, where it would terminate at US 99. The proposal was rejected by AASHO for being too long of a detour and including a tolled ferry crossing.

===New alignments and freeways===
US 101 was split into two routes in the San Francisco Bay Area between San Jose and San Francisco in 1929: US 101W followed El Camino Real on the San Francisco Peninsula for ; US 101E traversed the East Bay for to Oakland, where it turned west on a cross-bay ferry to San Francisco. The branches converged in Downtown San Francisco and traveled along city streets to the Hyde Street Pier, where the highway continued on automobile ferries to Sausalito at the south end of the Redwood Highway. By 1936, US 101E had been eliminated in favor of the route on the west side, which was re-designated as US 101.

The Hyde Street–Sausalito ferry was removed from US 101 following the May 1937 completion of the Golden Gate Bridge, which would carry the highway from San Francisco to Marin County. It was the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time of its construction and was funded by a $35 million regional bond (equivalent to $ in dollars) that was paid off in 1971. The San Jose–San Francisco section of US 101 was initially moved from El Camino Real to the Bayshore Highway, a four-lane undivided highway that was constructed between 1924 and 1937 to bypass several towns on the peninsula. El Camino Real was re-designated as US 101 Alternate in 1936, which sparked outcry from businesses and groups who lobbied for a reversal of the change that was submitted by state officials to AASHO. In 1938, US 101 was moved back to El Camino Real and the Bayshore Highway was designated as US 101 Bypass.

In the late 1940s, the California state government announced plans to convert most of US 101 between Los Angeles and San Francisco to freeways using funds from the Collier–Burns Highway Act of 1947. Prior to the act, the Cahuenga Pass Freeway had opened in June 1940 between Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles to replace a narrow, winding mountain road. It was the city&#x27;s second freeway and was later extended southeast towards Downtown and renamed the Hollywood Freeway when it was completed on April 16, 1954. Several other early freeway segments were signed as US 101 Bypass or US 101 Alternate. In San Luis Obispo, a freeway around the northwest side of downtown was completed by the early 1960s, alongside bypasses of nearby rural towns. The San Diego–San Francisco section of US 101 was designated as El Camino Real by the California state government in 1959 as part of a program to add historic markers on the highway.

The Santa Ana Freeway was planned as a Los Angeles–Irvine connector in the late 1930s and constructed in phases, beginning with a section near Downtown Los Angeles that opened in December 1947. US 101 was later moved onto sections of the freeway, which was completed in 1958 and served as a continuation of the Hollywood Freeway. By the time it was completed, sections of the freeway between Anaheim and Los Angeles were carrying over 113,000 vehicles per day and were planned to be widened to six lanes within a few years. The south end of the Santa Ana Freeway merged into the San Diego Freeway, which began construction in 1954 and was completed in 1968. Both freeways were incorporated into plans for the new Interstate Highway System in 1955 and assigned to I-5 three years later.

US 101 was truncated to Los Angeles during a 1963 AASHO meeting at the request of the California state government, as I-5 had replaced the stretch to San Diego; the changes were made ahead of a major restructuring of the state&#x27;s highway system that took effect on July 1, 1964. The old sections of the highway from San Diego to Los Angeles were given local names and later signed as Historic US 101 in the late 2010s by local governments. The 1963 action also moved the San Jose–San Francisco section onto the Bayshore Freeway, which was built to replace the Bayshore Highway on US 101 Bypass. The freeway had been proposed to address congestion and frequent collisions on the highway, nicknamed &quot;Bloody Bayshore&quot;, and opened in stages between 1947 and 1962. The bypassed sections of El Camino Real were renumbered to SR 82 in the Bay Area and signed as business routes of US 101 in other cities. From the north end of the Bayshore Freeway at I-80 in San Francisco, US 101 was routed west along a section of the Central Freeway, which opened in 1955 and was extended four years later to Van Ness Avenue. Plans to extend the Central Freeway and other thoroughfares through San Francisco to the Golden Gate Bridge were later cancelled by the mid-1960s following widespread opposition and protests from city residents.

Several sections of the Oregon Coast Highway were rebuilt in the 1950s and 1960s to eliminate curves and move the highway further from the coastline in cities such as Cannon Beach. A realignment from Brookings to Gold Beach and a more direct route from Bandon to Coos Bay to bypass Coquille were completed as part of this program in the early 1960s. In 1955, Oregon congressman A. Walter Norblad unsuccessfully proposed that the US 101 corridor be included in the Interstate Highway System to allow for federal funds to construct a bridge across the Columbia River; the proposal was also endorsed by a U.S. Army official, who also sought a similar designation for the Washington section. The Seaside–Astoria section was straightened and realigned onto a new bridge over Youngs Bay in 1964. The Astoria–Megler Bridge over the Columbia River opened to traffic on July 29, 1966, replacing a ferry and comprising the final &quot;link&quot; in US 101. The northern terminus of US 101 was originally at Capitol Way (US 99) in downtown Olympia until it was moved to a freeway bypass in December 1958. The freeway section was extended northwest from Olympia to Shelton in 1965.

===Modern projects===

The final traffic signal on the section of US 101 between Los Angeles and San Francisco, located at Anacapa Street in Santa Barbara, was removed in November 1991. The removal was spurred by the construction of a freeway through Santa Barbara, which was completed the following year and bypassed four signalized intersections. The Central Freeway&#x27;s northernmost leg in San Francisco was demolished in the early 2000s after it had sustained damage in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which required the upper deck to be removed in 1997. A portion of the corridor was replaced by Octavia Boulevard, which opened in 2005, while US 101 was rerouted onto Van Ness Avenue further east. From 2016 to 2022, Van Ness Avenue was rebuilt by the San Francisco Municipal Railway to add center bus lanes and landscaped medians as part of the Van Ness Bus Rapid Transit project.

Several existing freeway sections in California were expanded to add high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) beginning in the 1980s to address increased congestion, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area. By 1984, a section in Marin County had been opened to traffic; it was followed by sections in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties that were funded by a sales tax approved in a 1984 ballot measure. The HOV lanes were extended south through San Jose to Bernal Road in 1990. A section of the existing HOV lanes from Redwood City to San Bruno was converted to high-occupancy toll lanes in 2023 with the use of electronic toll collection.

Sections of US 101 in Oregon have been rebuilt or relocated due to erosion or landslides that caused considerable damage to the highway. The use of riprap to reinforce new sections of the roadway was banned by the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development in 1977 due to its effect on beach degradation. An effort to repeal the ban and rebuild sections of US 101 began in 2002 and resulted in an amendment in 2022. Several sections of US 101 between Newport and Lincoln City are identified as persistent sunken grade and rockfall areas in need of frequent repairs. Other portions of the highway in southwestern Oregon had landslide and subsidence issues, including a section in Harbor that was closed for several weeks in early 2016 by a sinkhole.

Severe erosion of the highway along the Hoh River in Washington was addressed through the construction of eight engineered logjams by the Washington State Department of Transportation in 2004. The project redirected the river&#x27;s flow through the use of dense piles of spruce logs reinforced by steel piles; the highway previously underwent four emergency repairs in the area that included installation of riprap and other conventional materials. US 101 was relocated onto an expressway bypass of Sequim, Washington, in August 1999 that replaced a congested route on the city&#x27;s main street, Washington Avenue. The project cost $40.7 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) to construct and included the installation of warning signals triggered by the presence of nearby Roosevelt elk wearing radio collars for tracking. The section of the highway between Port Angeles and Sequim was widened to four lanes in November 2014 following a two-year project to fill the final, gap. The section west of Port Angeles along Lake Crescent was rehabilitated from 2017 to 2019 to repave the roadway and repair structures—among them retaining walls and guardrails.

A freeway bypass of Willits, California, for the Redwood Highway opened in November 2016 at a cost of $460 million (equivalent to $ in dollars). The bypass was expected to divert away tourists and cause a drop in local sales tax revenue due to lost traffic. A portion of US 101 in the North Bay region near San Francisco, nicknamed the &quot;Novato Narrows&quot;, was widened to three lanes with the addition of an HOV lane; construction on the section began in 2011 and is scheduled to be completed in 2026. A four-phase widening through the Santa Barbara area to add a third lane in each direction began construction in 2008. Its final phase is estimated to cost $700 million and be completed in 2027. The world&#x27;s largest urban wildlife crossing, named the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, is under construction over US 101 in Agoura Hills, California, and is scheduled to open in 2025.

<text>The Poetic Edda is the modern name for an untitled collection of Old Norse anonymous narrative poems in alliterative verse. It is distinct from the closely related &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, although both works are seminal to the study of Old Norse poetry. Several versions of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; exist: especially notable is the medieval Icelandic manuscript &quot;Codex Regius&quot;, which contains 31 poems.

==Composition==
The Eddic poems are composed in alliterative verse. Most are in &quot;fornyrðislag&quot; (&quot;old story metre&quot;), while &quot;málaháttr&quot; (&quot;speech form&quot;) is a common variation. The rest, about a quarter, are composed in &quot;ljóðaháttr&quot; (&quot;song form&quot;). The language of the poems is usually clear and relatively unadorned. Kennings are often employed, though they do not arise as frequently, nor are they as complex, as those found in typical skaldic poetry.

===Authorship===
Like most early poetry, the Eddic poems were minstrel poems, passed orally from singer to singer and from poet to poet for centuries. None of the poems are attributed to a particular author, though many of them show strong individual characteristics and are likely to have been the work of individual poets. While scholars have speculated on hypothetical authors, firm and accepted conclusions have never been reached.

===Date===

Accurate dating of the poems has long been a source of scholarly debate. Firm conclusions are difficult to reach; lines from the Eddic poems sometimes appear in poems by known poets. For example, Eyvindr skáldaspillir composed in the latter half of the 10th century, and he uses a couple of lines in his &quot;Hákonarmál&quot; that are also found in &quot;Hávamál&quot;. It is possible that he was quoting a known poem, but it is also possible that &quot;Hávamál&quot;, or at least the strophe in question, is the younger derivative work.

The handful demonstrably historical characters mentioned in the poems, such as Attila, provide a &quot;terminus post quem&quot; of sorts. The dating of the manuscripts themselves provides a number of useful &quot;terminus ante quem&quot;.

Individual poems have individual clues to their age. For example, &quot;Atlamál hin groenlenzku&quot; is claimed by its title to have been composed in Greenland and seems so by some internal evidence. If so, it must have been composed no earlier than about 985, since there were no Scandinavians in Greenland until that time.

More certain than such circumstantial evidence are linguistic dating criteria. These can be arrived at by looking at Skaldic poems whose dates are more firmly known. For instance the particle &quot;of&quot;, corresponding to &quot;ga-&quot; or &quot;ge-&quot; in other old Germanic languages, has been shown to occur more frequently in Skaldic poems of earlier date. Applying this criterion to Eddic poetry, Bjarne Fidjestøl found large variation, indicating that some of the poems were much older than others.

Other dating criteria include the use of the negative adverb &quot;eigi&quot; &#x27;not&#x27;, and alliteration of &quot;vr-&quot; with &quot;v-&quot;. In western dialects of Old Norse the former became &quot;r-&quot; around the year 1000, but in some Eddic poems the word &quot;vreiðr&quot;, younger form &quot;reiðr&quot;, is seen to alliterate with words beginning in an original &quot;v-&quot;. This was observed already by Olaf ‘White Skald’ Thordarson, the author of the Third Grammatical Treatise, who termed this &quot;v&quot; before &quot;r&quot; the &quot;vindandin forna&quot;; &#x27;the ancient use of vend&#x27;.

In some cases, old poems may have been interpolated with younger verses or merged with other poems. For example, stanzas 9–16 of &quot;Völuspá&quot;, the &quot;Dvergatal&quot; or &quot;Roster of Dwarfs&quot;, is considered by some scholars to be an interpolation.

===Location===
The problem of dating the poems is linked with the problem of determining where they were composed. Iceland was not settled until approximately 870, so anything composed before that time would necessarily have been elsewhere, most likely in Scandinavia. More recent poems, on the other hand, are likely Icelandic in origin.

Scholars have attempted to localize individual poems by studying the geography, flora, and fauna to which they refer. This approach usually does not yield firm results. For example, there are no wolves in Iceland, but we can be sure that Icelandic poets were familiar with the species. Similarly, the apocalyptic descriptions of &quot;Völuspá&quot; have been taken as evidence that the poet who composed it had seen a volcanic eruption in Iceland – but this is hardly certain.

==&quot;Codex Regius&quot;==
The &quot;Codex Regius&quot; is arguably the most important extant source on Norse mythology and Germanic heroic legends. Since the early 19th century, it has had a powerful influence on Scandinavian literature, not only through its stories, but also through the visionary force and the dramatic quality of many of the poems. It has also been an inspiration for later innovations in poetic meter, particularly in Nordic languages, with its use of terse, stress-based metrical schemes that lack final rhymes, instead focusing on alliterative devices and strongly concentrated imagery. Poets who have acknowledged their debt to the &quot;Codex Regius&quot; include Vilhelm Ekelund, August Strindberg, J. R. R. Tolkien, Ezra Pound, Jorge Luis Borges, and Karin Boye.

The &quot;Codex Regius&quot; was written during the 13th century, but nothing was known of its whereabouts until 1643, when it came into the possession of Brynjólfur Sveinsson, then Bishop of Skálholt. At the time, versions of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; were known in Iceland, but scholars speculated that there once was another Edda, an Elder Edda, which contained the pagan poems that Snorri quotes in his &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. When &quot;Codex Regius&quot; was discovered, it seemed that the speculation had proved correct, but modern scholarly research has shown that the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; was likely written first and that the two were, at most, connected by a common source.

Brynjólfur attributed the manuscript to Sæmundr the Learned, a larger-than-life 12th century Icelandic priest. Modern scholars reject that attribution, but the name Sæmundar Edda is still sometimes associated with both the &quot;Codex Regius&quot; and versions of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; using it as a source.

Bishop Brynjólfur sent the manuscript as a present to the Danish king, hence the Latin name &quot;Codex Regius,&quot; . For centuries it was stored in the Royal Library in Copenhagen, but in 1971 it was returned to Iceland. Because air travel at the time was not entirely trustworthy with such precious cargo, it was transported by ship, accompanied by a naval escort.

==Contents==

Poems similar to those found in the &quot;Codex Regius&quot; are also included in many editions of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. Important manuscripts containing these other poems include AM 748 I 4to, &quot;Hauksbók&quot;, and &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot;. Many of the poems are also quoted in Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Prose&quot; &quot;Edda&quot;, but usually only in bits and pieces. What poems are included in an edition of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; depends on the editor. Those not found in the &quot;Codex Regius&quot; are sometimes called the &quot;eddic appendix&quot;. Other Eddic-like poems not usually published in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; are sometimes called Eddica minora and were compiled by Andreas Heusler and Wilhelm Ranisch in their 1903 book titled &quot;Eddica minora: Dichtungen eddischer Art aus den Fornaldarsögur und anderen Prosawerken&quot;.

English translators are not consistent on the translations of the names of the Eddic poems or on how the Old Norse forms should be rendered in English. Up to three translated titles are given below, taken from the translations of Bellows, Hollander, and Larrington with proper names in the normalized English forms found in John Lindow&#x27;s &quot;Norse Mythology&quot; and in Andy Orchard&#x27;s &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Dictionary of Norse Myth and Legend&quot;.

===Mythological poems===

*&quot;Svipdagsmál&quot; (&quot;The Ballad of Svipdag, The Lay of Svipdag&quot;) – This title, originally suggested by Bugge, actually covers two separate poems. These poems are late works and not included in most editions after 1950:
**&quot;Grógaldr&quot; (&quot;Gróa&#x27;s Spell, The Spell of Gróa&quot;)
**&quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot; (&quot;Ballad of Fjölsvid, The Lay of Fjölsvid&quot;)

*&quot;Gullkársljóð&quot; (&quot;The Poem of Gullkár&quot;). (A late work not included in most editions after 1900).

===Heroic lays===
After the mythological poems, the &quot;Codex Regius&quot; continues with heroic lays about mortal heroes, examples of Germanic heroic legend. The heroic lays are to be seen as a whole in the &quot;Edda&quot;, but they consist of three layers: the story of Helgi Hundingsbani, the story of the Nibelungs, and the story of Jörmunrekkr, king of the Goths. These are, respectively, Scandinavian, German, and Gothic in origin. As far as historicity can be ascertained, Attila, Jörmunrekkr, and Brynhildr actually existed, taking Brynhildr to be partly based on Brunhilda of Austrasia, but the chronology has been reversed in the poems.

====In the &quot;Codex Regius&quot;====
;The Helgi Lays
*&quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot; or &quot;Völsungakviða&quot; (&quot;The First Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane, The First Lay of Helgi the Hunding-Slayer, The First Poem of Helgi Hundingsbani&quot;)
*&quot;Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar&quot; (&quot;The Lay of Helgi the Son of Hjörvard, The Lay of Helgi Hjörvardsson, The Poem of Helgi Hjörvardsson&quot;)
*&quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot; or &quot;Völsungakviða in forna&quot; (&quot;The Second Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane, The Second Lay of Helgi the Hunding-Slayer, A Second Poem of Helgi Hundingsbani&quot;)

;The Niflung Cycle
*&quot;Frá dauða Sinfjötla&quot; (&quot;Of Sinfjötli&#x27;s Death, Sinfjötli&#x27;s Death, The Death of Sinfjötli&quot;) (A short prose text.)
*&quot;Grípisspá&quot; (&quot;Grípir&#x27;s Prophecy, The Prophecy of Grípir&quot;)
*&quot;Reginsmál&quot; (&quot;The Ballad of Regin, The Lay of Regin&quot;)
*&quot;Fáfnismál&quot; (&quot;The Ballad of Fáfnir, The Lay of Fáfnir&quot;)
*&quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot; (&quot;The Ballad of The Victory-Bringer, The Lay of Sigrdrífa&quot;)
*&quot;Brot af Sigurðarkviðu&quot; (&quot;Fragment of a Sigurd Lay, Fragment of a Poem about Sigurd&quot;)
*&quot;Guðrúnarkviða I&quot; (&quot;The First Lay of Gudrún&quot;)
*&quot;Sigurðarkviða hin skamma&quot; (&quot;The Short Lay of Sigurd, A Short Poem about Sigurd&quot;)
*&quot;Helreið Brynhildar&quot; (&quot;Brynhild&#x27;s Hell-Ride, Brynhild&#x27;s Ride to Hel, Brynhild&#x27;s Ride to Hell&quot;)
*&quot;Dráp Niflunga&quot; (&quot;The Slaying of The Niflungs, The Fall of the Niflungs, The Death of the Niflungs&quot;)
*&quot;Guðrúnarkviða II&quot; (&quot;The Second Lay of Gudrún&quot; or &quot;Guðrúnarkviða hin forna&quot; &quot;The Old Lay of Gudrún&quot;)
*&quot;Guðrúnarkviða III&quot; (&quot;The Third Lay of Gudrún&quot;)
*&quot;Oddrúnargrátr&quot; (&quot;The Lament of Oddrún, The Plaint of Oddrún, Oddrún&#x27;s Lament&quot;)
*&quot;Atlakviða&quot; (&quot;The Lay of Atli&quot;). The full manuscript title is &quot;Atlakviða hin grœnlenzka&quot;, that is, &quot;The Greenland Lay of Atli&quot;, but editors and translators generally omit the Greenland reference as a probable error from confusion with the following poem.
*&quot;Atlamál hin groenlenzku&quot; (&quot;The Greenland Ballad of Atli, The Greenlandish Lay of Atli, The Greenlandic Poem of Atli&quot;)

;The Jörmunrekkr Lays
*&quot;Guðrúnarhvöt&quot; (&quot;Gudrún&#x27;s Inciting, Gudrún&#x27;s Lament, The Whetting of Gudrún.&quot;)
*&quot;Hamðismál&quot; (&quot;The Ballad of Hamdir, The Lay of Hamdir&quot;)

====Not in the &quot;Codex Regius&quot;====
Several of the legendary sagas contain poetry in the Eddic style. Their age and importance is often difficult to evaluate but the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, in particular, contains interesting poetic interpolations.

*&quot;Hlöðskviða&quot; (&quot;Lay of Hlöd&quot;, also known in English as &quot;The Battle of the Goths and the Huns&quot;), extracted from &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;.
*&quot;The Waking of Angantýr&quot;, extracted from &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;.

===English translations===
The &quot;Elder&quot; or &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; has been translated numerous times, the earliest printed edition being that by , though some short sections had been translated as early as the 1670s. Some early translators relied on a Latin translation of the &quot;Edda&quot;, including Cottle.

Opinions differ on the best way to translate the text, on the use or rejection of archaic language, and the rendering of terms lacking a clear English analogue. Still, Cottle&#x27;s 1797 translation is now considered very inaccurate.

A comparison of the second and third verses (lines 5–12) of the &quot;Vǫluspá&quot; is given below:

==Allusions and quotations==
* As noted above, the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; of Snorri Sturluson makes much use of the works included in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, though he may well have had access to other compilations that contained the poems and there is no evidence that he used the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; or even knew of it.
* The &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; is a prose version of much of the Niflung cycle of poems. Due to several missing pages (see Great Lacuna) in the &quot;Codex Regius&quot;, the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; is the oldest complete source for the Norse version of much of the story of Sigurð. Only 22 stanzas of the &quot;Sigurðarkviða&quot; survive in the &quot;Codex Regius&quot;, plus four stanzas from the missing section which are quoted in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;.
*J. R. R. Tolkien, a philologist and scholar of Old Norse who was familiar with the Eddas, utilized concepts from them in his 1937 fantasy novel &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and in other works. For example:
**The Misty Mountains derive from the &quot;úrig fiöll&quot; in the &quot;Skírnismál&quot;.
**The names of his Dwarves derive from the &quot;Dvergatal&quot; in the &quot;Vǫluspá&quot;.
**His &quot;Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún&quot; is a verse retelling or reconstruction of the Nibelung poems from the Edda (see &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;), composed in the Eddaic &quot;fornyrðislag&quot; metre.

<text>The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK; ) is a political party active in Kurdistan Region and the disputed territories in Iraq. The PUK describes its goals as self-determination, human rights, democracy and peace for the Kurdish people of Kurdistan and Iraq. The PUK is currently under the leadership of Bafel Talabani. The PUK was founded in 1975 by Jalal Talabani, Nawshirwan Mustafa, Fuad Masum, Adel Murad, Ali Askari and Abdul Razaq Feyli Dawood Mohammed Ali. All presidents of Iraq under the 2005 constitution have been from this party.

==History==
===Discontent within the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP)===
The PUK traces its political heritage to Sulaymaniyah native Ibrahim Ahmad. After the collapse of the Soviet-backed Kurdish Mahabad Republic in Iran in early 1947, Ibrahim Ahmad, previously the Sulaymaniyah representative of the Iranian KDP (KDP-I), joined the newly formed Iraqi KDP. Ahmad was a highly influential leftist intellectual, who by 1951 had succeeded in rallying most of the Iraqi Kurdish leftist-nationalists to the new Iraqi KDP, which, in turn, took the opportunity to convene a second Party Congress and duly elect Ahmad as secretary-general (effectively acting Chairman).

However, from the very beginning in Iran, Ibrahim Ahmad&#x27;s leftist politics, &quot;intellectualism&quot;, and support for Qazi Muhammad put him at odds with the faction of the KDP loyal to Mustafa Barzani and his traditionalist-conservative tribal support base. It was &quot;well-known in nationalist circles that the relations between the two men Mustafa and Qazi were not easy&quot;. Ibrahim Ahmad was soon joined by up-and-coming intellectual and socialist Jalal Talabani. Barzani and Ahmad were known to dislike each other. But while each wanted to reduce the others&#x27; influence in the KDP, each also knew that the other was indispensable in securing the loyalty of their respective support-bases.

When the first Ba&#x27;ath Party government was deposed in a coup led by Abdul Salam Arif, Mustafa developed a close relationship with Arif. Mulla Mustafa signed an agreement with Arif in his personal capacity, rather than as president of the KDP. This infuriated Ahmad and Jalal Talabani as the agreement omitted any mention of self-administration, let alone autonomy—the whole point for which the Kurds had been fighting a long-term guerrilla war. Arif threatened force against any Kurdish opponent of Mustafa, while Mustafa declared that any resistance to Baghdad would constitute a declaration of war against himself and the Barzanis.

Ibrahim Ahmad and Jalal Talabani decried this complicity, and as they saw it, submission, to Baghdad. Mulla Mustafa rallied the conservatives and tribal leaders to his side. Furious debates and campaigning followed, but Ahmad&#x27;s and Talabani&#x27;s arguments could not dislodge Mulla Mustafa&#x27;s position as the popular figurehead of the Kurdish people. Mulla Mustafa would accept no dissent, and, fearing for their lives, Ahmad and his followers slipped away at night from a heated discussion with Mulla Mustafa, and retreated back to their stronghold in Mawat, Iraq.

At the Sixth Party Congress of the KDP in July 1964, representatives from the Ahmad-Talabani faction were arrested upon arrival. A few days later Mulla Mustafa sent his son, Idris Barzani with a large force to drive Ahmad, Talabani, and their 4,000 or so followers into exile in Iran. With this, Mulla Mustafa had finally achieved undisputed control of the KDP.

===Founding===


After the defeat of the Kurds in the 1974–1975 Revolt, on 22 May 1975, Talabani met in a coffee shop called Gligla, in Aum Rmana, Damascus, with Fuad Mausm, Adel Murad, and Abdul Razaq Faily. That day, the PUK announced its formation via Syrian and Lebanese media. The day after, Talabani visited Berlin in West Germany and met three other co-founders, Nawshirwan Mustafa, Omar Shekhmus, and Kamal Fwad, and some other activists. On 1 June 1975, the PUK was announced again in Berlin, and thus it was decided that 1 June is the anniversary date of the founding of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).

The PUK was a coalition of at least five separate political entities, the most significant of which were Talabani and his closest followers, Nawshirwan Mustafa&#x27;s clandestine Marxist-Leninist group Komala, and the Kurdistan Socialist Movement (KSM), formed as a result of a series of meetings within the cadres of the Aylul Revolution who took refuge in Iran in 1975, including Omer Dababa, Ali Askari, Dr. Khalid, Ali Hazhar, Kardo Galali, Ibrahim Ahmad, Jamal Agha, Rasul Mamand, Mala Nasih, Abdulrahman Gomashini, Milazm Tahir, Ali Wali and Kamal Mihedeen. The PUK served as an umbrella organization unifying various trends within the Kurdish political movement in Iraq.

The PUK received grassroots support from the urban intellectual classes of Iraqi Kurdistan upon its establishment, partly due to five of its seven founding members being Ph.D. holders and academics. In the early 1980s, the PUK evolved and broadened its appeal to all sections of Iraqi Kurdish society, especially the rural classes.

In 1992, the constituent groups within the PUK merged into a unified political movement that affirmed its social-democratic identity and affiliation. Their communique ascribed the collapse of the revolt to &quot;the inability of the feudalist, tribalist, bourgeois rightist and capitulationist Kurdish leadership&quot;.

The PUK&#x27;s support lies predominantly in the southern part of the Kurdistan Region.

===Conflicts===
During the Iran-Iraq war, the PUK entered into hostilities with the Iranian Kurdish Sipay Rizgari, opposing them due to Sipay Rizgari&#x27;s close ties to the Iraqi authorities that the PUK was fighting. The PUK harassed Sipay Rizgari&#x27;s troops and, to a large extent, cut off their supply lines.

Since the first Gulf War, the PUK has jointly administered Kurdistan Region with the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). However, in 1994 the parties engaged in a three-year conflict, known as the Iraqi Kurdish Civil War. The conflict ended with US mediation, and reconciliation was eventually achieved.

In September 2001, the Islamist group Jund al-Islam (the Army of Islam) massacred 43 PUK members.

===Leadership crisis and split-offs===
Originally a centre-left party opposing the conservative tribalism of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, the PUK developed into a similarly tribalistic vehicle for the political ambitions of Jalal Talabani and his family. In 2009, influential PUK politician Nawshirwan Mustafa left the party, frustrated by widespread tribalism and corruption within the party. He proceeded to found the Gorran Movement, which in turn presented itself as an alternative to the corrupt politics of PUK and KDP.

After the founder and leader of the PUK, Jalal Talabani, died in 2017, a struggle for the leadership of the party ignited between Jalal&#x27;s son Bafel Talabani and the then co-president Lahur Sheikh Jangi. On the PUK&#x27;s fourth congress in December 2019, Sheikh Jangi received the most votes for the General Leadership Council. In a compromise, he and Bafel were proclaimed co-presidents. In July 2021, Bafel shut down a media outlet close to Sheikh Jangi and ousted several important commanders from the counter-terrorism and intelligence units of the PUK, who were seen as affiliates of him. Shortly after, Bafel was declared the sole leader of the party. In November, Lahur Sheikh Jangi was expelled from the PUK along a few others and Bafel took full control over the party&#x27;s finances. Sheikh Jangi filed a lawsuit against the expulsion. In February 2023, a court in Erbil ruled, that the ouster from the co-presidency was contradicted PUK&#x27;s internal regulation and reinstated him. A day after however, on 21 February, the judicial authority on Iraqi elections in Baghdad declared Bafel Talabani the sole leader of the PUK. 

After that, Sheikh Jangi proceeded to work on founding his own party. His new party, the People&#x27;s Front received its license from the interior ministry on 17 January 2024 and was joined by several former PUK-members from Lahur&#x27;s wing.

==Structure==
A Co-Presidents are elected by the General Leadership Council. The PUK has 36 branches throughout Iraqi Kurdistan and draws membership from a broad cross-section of Kurdish society. The membership of the PUK, based on statistics compiled in September 1998, stands at 800,280 members and associates. The PUK contested the 1992 elections for the Kurdistan National Assembly, and the party list acquired 423,682 votes of the total of 957,469 valid votes cast - giving the PUK commanding majority in three of Kurdistan Region&#x27;s four provinces. The PUK is a member of the Socialist International. Kosrat Rasul Ali was elected as the leader of the Supreme Political Council at the party congress in December 2019 and Lahur Talabany and Bafel Talabany were elected as Co-Presidents in February 2020 to lead the party.

===Organizational structure===
The PUK&#x27;s structure consists of 8 bureaus:

<text>The Iraqi Constitutional Monarchy (ICM) is a monarchist political party in Iraq formerly led by the late Sharif Ali bin al-Hussein.

Al-Hussein was related to the Hashemite royal family which ruled Iraq until 1958. He had succeeded in establishing himself as a claimant in the international press and (in the politics of Iraq). Prince Sharif Ali bin al-Hussein was the only Iraqi royal campaigning in Iraq for the return of a monarchy based on a constitutional monarchy. Some critics asserted he was not even in line to the throne according to the constitution of the old Iraqi monarchy (The Iraqi Constitution as amended in November 1943). According to this constitution, the heir to the monarchy would be Prince Ra&#x27;ad (born 1936), Lord Chamberlain of Jordan, and the heir apparent Prince Zeid bin Ra&#x27;ad, a former Jordanian diplomat who was active within the United Nations.

==Goals of the Iraqi Constitutional Monarchy==

*First: To uphold the unity of the Iraqi nation and to maintain its sovereign independence.

*Second: To affirm the Islamic identity of Iraq while respecting all religions and beliefs and recognizing their inviolable rights.

*Third: To implement a free and direct national referendum to decide the nature of government and the Head of State.

*Fourth: To draft a permanent Constitution to be confirmed by the people of Iraq in a free public referendum.

*Fifth: That the nature of the Monarchy will be hereditary and constitutional emanating from the will of the people and that the Monarch would be the symbol of the unity of the people and the pride and honor of the nation.

*Sixth: The establishment of a pluralistic democratic state in which power is transferred via the ballot box and the establishment of healthy democratic institutions on the basis of the complete separation of power between the executive legislative and judicial branches.

*Seventh: The affirmation of the sanctity of the judiciary and its independence from any group or person in the state.

*Eighth: To completely uphold the principals of basic human rights as laid down by religion, the United Nations, and international institutions.

*Ninth: That the armed forces belong to the people and that their sacred mission is to protect the nation from external aggression and are prohibited from any political activity.

*Tenth: To institute a free economy and encourage and develop the industrial agricultural and commercial sectors while maintaining a balance between the rights of ownership and the free market and the rights of the people to social justice equal opportunity and basic amenities.

*Eleventh: To implement a comprehensive national reconciliation based on forgiveness and absolution far from a desire for vengeance and retribution with due consideration for the rule of law and justice.

*Twelfth: To amend the legacy left by the dark era on the basis of just laws with foremost consideration for ethnic and secular issues, the nationality law, voluntary and forced emigration and on the foundation of equal rights and responsibilities for all citizens as stated in the permanent constitution.

<text>The national flag of Sweden () consists of a yellow or gold Nordic cross (i.e. a horizontal cross extending to the edges, with the crossbar closer to the hoist than the fly) on a field of light blue. The Nordic cross design traditionally represents Christianity. The design and colours of the Swedish flag are believed to have been inspired by the present coat of arms of Sweden of 1442, which is blue divided quarterly by a cross pattée of gold. Blue and yellow have been used as Swedish colours at least since Magnus III&#x27;s royal coat of arms of 1275.

== Specifics ==
=== Ratio and colour scheme ===
The Swedish flag is one of only five that use the ratio 5:8, the others being Argentina, Guatemala, Palau, and Poland.

It is one of only four flags that currently use the colour scheme of blue and yellow, the others being Kazakhstan, Palau, and Ukraine.

=== State flag and civil ensign ===
The dimensions of the Swedish flag are 5:2:9 horizontally and 4:2:4 vertically. The dimensions of the Swedish flag with a triple-tail are 5:2:5:8 horizontally and 4:2:4 vertically. The colours of the flag are officially established through the Natural Color System to be NCS 0580-Y10R for the shade of yellow, and NCS 4055-R95B for the shade of blue. They are also specified to Pantone &quot;PMS 301 C/U&quot; for blue and &quot;PMS 116&quot; or &quot;PMS 109 U&quot; for yellow. The square-cut Swedish state flag is identical to the civil ensign. The Swedish law does not regulate the design of the Swedish pennant, but it is recommended that its colour scheme should correspond with that of the flag.

=== Construction sheet ===
=== Naval ensign ===

The triple-tailed flag () is used as a naval ensign (). Its overall ratio, including the tails, is 1:2. The flag is also used as the Swedish naval jack (). The jacks are smaller than the ensigns, but they have the same proportions. The Swedish swallowtail flag was originally the King&#x27;s personal emblem, or the emblem representing a command conferred by the King. It was at first two-pointed, but by the mid-17th century, the distinctive swallowtail with tongue appeared. The flag is also flown by the defence ministry, while civil ministries fly square flags.

=== Royal flag ===

The Royal flag () is identical to the triple-tailed naval ensign, but has in its centre a white field with the greater or the lesser coat of arms surrounded by the Order of the Seraphim, which has the monarch as its grand master. The monarch personally decides about the specific use of the royal flag.

== History ==
=== Mythology ===
According to early modern legend, the 12th-century King Eric IX saw a golden cross in the sky as he landed in Finland during the First Swedish Crusade in 1157. Seeing this as a sign from God he adopted the golden cross against a blue background as his banner.

It has been suggested that the Swedish origin legend is chosen to counter a parallel origin story for the Danish flag, also recorded in the 16th century.
According to this theory, the Swedish flag was created during the reign of King Charles VIII, who also introduced the coat of arms of Sweden in 1442. The national coat of arms is a combination of King Albert&#x27;s coat of arms of 1364 and King Magnus III&#x27;s coat of arms of 1275, and is blue divided quarterly by a golden cross pattée.

Other historians claim that the Swedish flag was blue with a white cross before 1420, and became blue with a golden cross only during the early reign King Gustav I, who deposed King Christian II in 1521.

=== Early history ===

The exact age of the Swedish flag is not known, but the oldest recorded pictures of a blue cloth with a yellow cross date from the early 16th century, during the reign of King Gustav I. The first legal description of the flag was made in a royal warrant of 19 April 1562 as &quot;yellow in a cross fashioned on blue&quot;. As stipulated in a royal warrant of 1569, the yellow cross was always to be borne on Swedish battle standards and banners. Prior to this, a similar flag appeared in the coat of arms of King John III&#x27;s duchy, which is today Southwest Finland. The same coat of arms is still used by the province.

==== Triple-tailed flag ====

A royal warrant of 6 November 1663, regulated the use of the triple-tailed flag, to be used only as a state flag and naval ensign. According to the same royal warrant, merchant ships were only allowed to fly square-cut city flags in their respective provincial colours. In practice, however, the merchant fleet began using a square-cut civil ensign of the state flag. In a government instruction of ship building of 1730, this civil ensign should have the same proportions and colors as the state flag, with the notable difference of being square-cut. In 1756, the use of pennants by private ships was prohibited.

==== Blue ensign ====
A royal warrant of 18 August 1761, stipulated that an all blue triple-tailed flag to be used by the archipelago fleet, a branch of the army tasked with defending the archipelago along the Swedish coastlines. The commander of the fleet also had the right to order the use of the ordinary war ensign instead of the blue ensign when that was &quot;appropriate&quot;. The blue flag was used until 1813.

===Union between Sweden and Norway===
====Union flags of 1815 and 1818====
On 6 June 1815, a common military ensign was introduced for the two united kingdoms of Sweden and Norway. This flag was identical to the former triple-tailed military ensign of Sweden, with a white saltire on red to be included in the canton. Proposed by the Norwegian Prime Minister and unionist Peder Anker, the white saltire on a red background was supposed to symbolise Norway, as the country had previously been united with Denmark and initially continued to use the same flag as an independent country, but with the national arms in the canton.

Norwegian ships continued to use the Danish civil ensign distinguished with the national arms in the canton north of Cape Finisterre, but had to fly the Swedish civil ensign in the Mediterranean to be protected from pirate attacks. A common civil ensign for both countries was introduced in 1818, on the pattern of the naval ensign, but square-cut. This flag was optional for Swedish vessels, but compulsory for Norwegian ones in distant waters. In 1821, Norway adopted a new national civil ensign, identical to the present flag of Norway.

Following the adoption of a separate Norwegian flag, a royal regulation of 17 July 1821, stipulated that ships of both kingdoms use the common square-cut civil ensign (with the saltire included) in &quot;distant waters&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; beyond Cape Finisterre). In &quot;distant waters&quot;, they had the right to use any of the square-cut civil ensigns of their respective countries, or the uniform Union civil ensign. This system was in force until 1838.

==== Union flags of 1844 ====

A royal resolution of 20 June 1844, introduced new flags and heraldry to denote the equal status of the two kingdoms within the union. Both countries were granted civil and military ensigns on the same pattern, their respective national flags with the addition of a union mark in the canton, combining the flag colours of both countries. The naval ensign was based on the traditional triple-tailed Swedish model. In addition, the new union mark was to be used as the naval jack and as the flag for the common diplomatic representations abroad. The warrant also stipulated that the merchant fleet use their respective countries&#x27; square-cut civil ensigns, including the new union mark. Also, royal ensigns were introduced for both countries, their respective naval ensigns with the union mark, with the addition of the union arms at the center of the cross.
The new union flags were well received by the Norwegians, who had demanded their own military ensign since the union was formed. In Sweden, however, the new union mark in particular became quite unpopular and was contemptuously nicknamed the &quot;Sillsallaten&quot; (Swedish) or &quot;Sildesalaten&quot; (Norwegian) after a colorful dish of pickled herring, decorated with red beets and apples in a radial pattern. It is believed that the name was first used in a speech by Lord Brakel in the Swedish House of Lords in Stockholm.

During the 19th century, a number of regulations were issued regarding the use of Swedish flags. The military ensign was also to be used by civil government ships and buildings, such as the Customs, Harbor pilots and the Royal Mail. For this use, the military ensign would have a white field included with a golden marker: For the Harbor pilots (as of 1881, based on a proposal of 1825) an anchor with a star; for the Customs (as of 1844) the letter &quot;T&quot; topped a royal crown; for the Royal Mail (as of 1844) a postal horn with a royal crown. On 7 May 1897, an alternate state flag was introduced. This double-tailed flag was used by government owned ships and buildings, which did not fly the triple-tailed military ensign.

During the late 19th century, increasing Norwegian dissatisfaction with the union led to the demand for a return to the &quot;pure&quot; flag of 1821 without the union mark. Opponents of the union began to use this flag several years before it was officially recognised. During the 1890s, two consecutive sessions of the Norwegian parliament voted to abolish the mark, but the decision was overruled by royal veto. However, in 1898, when the flag law was passed for the third time, the king had to sanction it. On 12 October 1899, the union mark was removed from the Norwegian civil ensign. As the Norwegian military ensign according to the constitution of 1814 was to be a union ensign, the union mark remained on military flags until the dissolution of the union with Sweden. &quot;Pure&quot; military ensigns were hoisted on fortresses and naval vessels on 9 June 1905.

The union mark, however, remained a part of the Swedish flag until 1905, when a Law of 28 October 1905, stipulated the removal of the union mark as of 1 November 1905.

=== Colour change in 1906 ===

Following the dissolution of the union in 1905, the triple-tailed naval ensign also became the Swedish naval jack, replacing the common naval jack, and the Flag law of 22 June 1906 further regulated the use and design of the flag, specifying the colours to be &quot;ljust mellanblå&quot; (light medium blue) and &quot;guldgul&quot; (golden yellow), a departure from the previously darker shade of blue. The Swedish state flag became identical to the square-cut civil ensign, and all private use of the triple-tailed ensign was prohibited.

====Royal flag====
The king and queen use a royal flag with the greater national coat of arms. Other members of the royal house use a royal flag with the lesser national coat of arms. On naval ships the flag of the king is raised together with a split pennant with the greater national coat of arms. Likewise the flag of the heir apparent is raised together with a split pennant with the lesser national coat of arms on naval ships.

The Swedish Marshal of the Realm (&quot;Riksmarskalken&quot;) has published a series of decisions regarding the royal flag of Sweden. In a decision of 6 April 1987, rules are defined on how to fly the royal flag at the Royal Palace of Stockholm.
* The royal flag with the greater national coat of arms is hoisted at the Royal Palace when H.M. the King is within the realm, and is upholding his duties as the Head of state.
* The royal flag with the lesser national coat of arms is hoisted at the Royal Palace, if by reason of illness, foreign travel or for any other cause, the King is unavoidably prevented from performing his duties; a member of the Royal House under the valid order of succession who is not prevented there from, assumes and performs the duties of the Head of State in the capacity of Regent ad interim.
* The &quot;plain&quot; triple-tailed flag (without the coat of arms) is flown at the Royal Palace when the Riksdag has appointed a person to serve, at a Government order, as Regent &quot;ad interim&quot; when no member of the Royal House under the valid order of succession is in a position to serve. The three-tailed war flag is also flown at the Royal Palace when the Speaker, or, in his unavoidable absence, one of the Deputy Speakers, serves, at a Government order, as Regent &quot;ad interim&quot; when no member of the Royal House under the valid order of succession is in a position to serve.

Under King Carl XVI Gustaf, king since 1973, the plain triple-tailed flag has flown at the Royal Palace only once. This occurred on 2–3 July 1988, when the King went on a private visit to Wuppertal, Germany; at the same time, the Duke of Halland, his uncle and the only person in the line of succession, was on a private visit to Sainte-Maxime, France. The government therefore ordered the speaker of the Riksdag, Ingemund Bengtsson, to serve as regent &quot;ad interim&quot; for two days.

===Private use of the state flag===
There have been a few notable exemptions regarding the prohibition of private parties to use the state flag. All these privileges were terminated in accordance with the new specific flag regulation of 22 June 1906.
* According to a royal warrant of 31 October 1786, the Swedish East India Company had the right to use the triple-tailed war ensign in &quot;Indian waters&quot;, when &quot;not&quot; being under immediate protection by the Swedish navy. In the merchant fleet, there was a common practice to illegally use the war ensign to indicate that the ship was armed.
* In 1838, it was decided that private ships contracted by the Royal Mail were to fly a double-tailed flag.
* On 27 February 1832, the Royal Swedish Yacht Club received the right to use the triple-tailed war ensign, including a centre white field with a golden &quot;O&quot; topped with a duke&#x27;s crown (as of 1878 a royal crown).
* On 7 June 1893, the Royal Gothenburg Yacht Club received the right to use the triple-tailed military ensign, including a centered white field with the golden &quot;G K S S&quot; topped with a star.

==Use outside Sweden==
The flag of Sweden appears in coat of arms of Finland&#x27;s province Southwest Finland.

The flag of Wilmington, Delaware in the United States is modelled after the Swedish flag in remembrance of the short-lived colony of New Sweden, with the cross affixed with the seal of the city. The flag of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which also lies within historic New Sweden, is a vertical triband rather than a Nordic Cross, but the blue and yellow colours of the flag were chosen to commemorate the Swedish settlement of the region. According to a legend, the Argentine football team Boca Juniors&#x27; flag and colours were inspired by the flag of Sweden.

The seal of the Municipal Council of Shanghai International Settlement incorporated the 1844 Swedish civil ensign.
==Rules for displaying the Swedish flag==
When used from a stand-alone flagpole, the size of the flag is recommended to have a width equalling a fourth of the height of the pole. When used from a flagpole extending from a building, the flag is recommended to have a width equalling a third of the height (length) of the pole.

The times and rules for raising and lowering the Swedish flag are as follows:
* Between 1 March and 31 October the flag can be raised from 08:00.
* Between 1 November and 28/29 February the flag can be raised from 09:00.
* The flag shall be taken down at sunset but at the latest 21:00.
* If the flag is illuminated, it may remain up even after the sun has set.

If the flag is no longer in presentable condition it should be discarded by burning in a respectful manner or returned to the manufacturer for disposal.

Private citizens are not obliged to fly the flag on official flag flying days, but they are encouraged to do it. Apart from the flag flying days in Sweden, everyone is of course able to hoist the flag whenever there is a reason for celebration in the family or otherwise.

== Pennant ==
The Swedish pennant is shaped like an isosceles triangle (to prevent fraying, it is sometimes shaped like an isosceles trapezoid), consisting of two horizontal bands with blue at the top and yellow at the bottom. The National Archives of Sweden recommends its length to be the height of the flag pole. There is also an unofficial version of the pennant which resembles the national flag, with a yellow cross on a blue field, which is advised not to be used.

<text>The Iraqi National Accord (INA; Arabic: الوفاق الوطني العراقي; &quot;Al-Wifaq Al-Watani Al-&#x27;Iraqi&quot;), colloquially known in Iraq as Wifaq, is an Iraqi political party founded by Ayad Allawi, Tahsin Muallah and Salah Omar al-Ali in 1991.

==History==
The party was founded at the time of the Persian Gulf War as an opposition group to Saddam Hussein. At that time, the two most active anti-Saddam groups were the SCIRI and al-Dawa; both were Iranian-backed Islamic Shi&#x27;ite parties, originating from Iraq, but operating from Iran from which they received support. Both parties were disagreeable to the western powers, and Saudi Arabia, who had long poor relations with Iran. The INA was thus set up to be an alternative, largely funded by money from Saudi Arabia; with extra support coming from the UK and the United States.

INA membership consisted largely of military and security personnel who had defected from the Iraqi military under Saddam Hussein&#x27;s rule.

The INA organised attacks in Iraq between 1992 and 1995 to demonstrate its capacities as a militant group, but these had little effect on the government. In August 1995, Saddam&#x27;s son-in-law, Hussein Kamel al-Majid authorized the INA to operate from Jordan after he too defected. Unlike the Iraqi National Congress strategy of fomenting revolution among Iraq&#x27;s disaffected minorities, the INA felt the best way to remove Saddam was organizing a coup among Iraqi military and security services. To this end, the INA, in close cooperation with the CIA, was involved in a coup against Saddam in 1996. However, the INA had been infiltrated by agents loyal to Saddam, and in June, 1996, 30 Iraqi military officers were executed and 100 others were arrested for alleged ties to the INA. Allawi has claimed INA remained active in Iraq as of March, 1998.

With the fall of Saddam, the INA entered Iraq playing a central role in the occupation government. With the rift between the United States and the Iraqi National Congress, the INA&#x27;s role was further enhanced and Allawi was declared Prime Minister of Iraq on 28 May 2004. Under Allawi, the INA participated in the January 2005 Iraqi election, as part of the Iraqi List coalition. In the December 2005 elections, it was part of the Iraqi National List coalition.

<text>The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI or SIIC; &quot;Al-Majlis Al-A&#x27;ala Al-Islami Al-&#x27;Iraqi&quot;; previously known as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, SCIRI) is a Shia Islamist political party in Iraq. It was established in Iran in 1982 by Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim and changed its name to the current Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq in 2007. Its political support comes from Iraq&#x27;s Shia Muslim community.

Prior to his assassination in August 2003, SCIRI was led by Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim; afterwards it was led by the Ayatollah&#x27;s brother, Abdul Aziz al-Hakim. After Abdul Aziz al-Hakim&#x27;s death in 2009 his son Ammar al-Hakim became the group&#x27;s new leader. In light of its gains in the three 2005 elections and government appointments, the Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council became one of Iraq&#x27;s most powerful political parties and was the largest party in the Iraqi Council of Representatives until the 2010 Iraqi elections, where it lost support due to Nuri Al-Maliki&#x27;s political party rise.

Previously, ISCI&#x27;s militia wing was the Badr Brigade, which the party used during the Iraqi civil war of 2006–2007. After the civil war, the Badr Brigade turned into a political force on its own and left ISCI, although the two continue to be part of a coalition in Iraq&#x27;s parliament. After the departure of Badr Brigade, ISCI created a new militia called the .

==History==

===Iran===
Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution of Iraq was founded in Iran in 1982 during the Iran–Iraq War after the leading Islamist insurgent group, Islamic Dawa Party, was severely weakened by an Iraqi government crackdown following Dawa&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. SCIRI was the umbrella body for two Iran-based Shia Islamist groups, Dawa and the Islamic Action Organisation led by Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi. Another of SCIRI&#x27;s founders was Ayatollah Hadi al-Modarresi, the leader the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain. The Iranian Islamic revolutionary government arranged for the formation of SCIRI, which was based in exile in Tehran and under the leadership of Mohammad-Baqir al-Hakim. Hakim, living in exile in Iran, was the son of Ayatollah Mohsen-Hakim and a member of one of the leading Shia clerical families in Iraq. &quot;He declared the primary aim of the council to be the overthrow of the Ba&#x27;ath and the establishment of an Islamic government in Iraq. Iranian officials referred to Hakim as the leader of Iraq&#x27;s future Islamic state ...&quot;

However, there are crucial ideological differences between SCIRI and al-Dawa. SCIRI supports the ideologies of Iran&#x27;s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that Islamic Government must be controlled by the ulema (Islamic scholars). Al-Dawa, on the other hand, follows the position of Iraq&#x27;s late Ayatollah Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr, and al-Dawa co-founder, that government should be controlled by the ummah (Muslim community as a whole).

Despite this ideological disagreement, several of SCIRI&#x27;s factions came from al-Dawa before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. This historical intersection is significant because al-Dawa was widely viewed as a terrorist group during the Iran–Iraq War. In February 2007, journalists reported that Jamal Jaafar Muhammed, who was elected to the Iraqi parliament in 2005 as part of the SCIRI/Badr faction of the United Iraqi Alliance, was also sentenced to death in Kuwait for planning the al-Dawa bombings of the French and American embassies in that country in 1983.

===Post-invasion===
With the fall of Saddam Hussein after the invasion of Iraq, SCIRI quickly rose to prominence in Iraq, working closely with the other Shia parties. It gained popularity among Shia Iraqis by providing social services and humanitarian aid, following the pattern of Islamic organizations in other countries such as Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. SCIRI is alleged to receive money and weapons from Iran, and is often accused of being a proxy for Iranian interests. The party leaders have toned down many of the party&#x27;s public positions and committed it to democracy and peaceful cooperation. SCIRI&#x27;s power base is in the Shia-majority southern Iraq. The council&#x27;s armed wing, the Badr Organization, reportedly has had an estimated strength of between 4,000 and 10,000 men. Its Baghdad offices are based in a house that previously belonged to Ba&#x27;athist Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.

Its leader, Ayatollah al-Hakim, was killed in a car bomb attack in the Iraqi city of Najaf on August 29, 2003. The car bomb exploded as the ayatollah was leaving a religious shrine (Imam Ali Mosque) in the city, just after Friday prayers, killing more than 85. According to Kurdish Intelligence officials, Yassin Jarad, allegedly Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&#x27;s father-in-law, carried out the car bombing.

===Interior Ministry===
In the Shia Islamist–dominated government in post-invasion Iraq, SCIRI controlled the Interior Ministry. The Iraqi Interior Minister, Bayan Jabr, was a former leader of SCIRI&#x27;s Badr Brigade militia. In 2006 the United Nations human rights chief in Iraq, John Pace, said that every month hundreds of Iraqis were being tortured to death or executed by the Interior Ministry under SCIRI&#x27;s control. According to a 2006 report by the &quot;Independent&quot; newspaper:

&#x27;Mr Pace said the Ministry of the Interior was &quot;acting as a rogue element within the government&quot;. It is controlled by the main Shia party, the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Sciri); the Interior Minister, Bayan Jabr, is a former leader of Sciri&#x27;s Badr Brigade militia, which is one of the main groups accused of carrying out sectarian killings. Another is the Mehdi Army of the young cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who is part of the Shia coalition seeking to form a government after winning the mid-December election.

Many of the 110,000 policemen and police commandos under the ministry&#x27;s control are suspected of being former members of the Badr Brigade. Not only counter-insurgency units such as the Wolf Brigade, the Scorpions and the Tigers, but the commandos and even the highway patrol police have been accused of acting as death squads.

The paramilitary commandos, dressed in garish camouflage uniforms and driving around in pick-up trucks, are dreaded in Sunni neighbourhoods. People whom they have openly arrested have frequently been found dead several days later, with their bodies bearing obvious marks of torture.&#x27;

==Politics==

SIIC is a Shia Islamist political party that is widely regarded as one of the most pro-Iranian parties in Iraq. SIIC&#x27;s support is strongest in Iraq&#x27;s south especially Basra, where it has been said to have become &quot;the de facto government.&quot;

It joined the United Iraqi Alliance list for the general election on January 30, 2005 (see Iraqi legislative election, 2005), but filed separate lists in some governorate council elections held on the same day (see for instance 2005 Nineveh governorate election). In the January 2005 election it won six out of eight Shia-majority governorates and came in first in Baghdad with 40% of the vote. Following the election SIIC had many members hired by various government ministries, particularly the Interior Ministry, &quot;ensuring a favorable position for&quot; it.
Its administration in Southern Iraq has been criticized as corrupt and as &quot;theocracy mixed with thuggery&quot; According to a 2005 report by journalist Doug Ireland, the Badr Organization has been involved in many incidents of attacking and killing gays in Iraq. According to the British television Channel 4, from 2005 through early 2006, SIIC&#x27;s Badr Organization members working as commandos in the Ministry of the Interior (which Badr controls) &quot;have been implicated in rounding up and killing thousands of ordinary Sunni civilians.&quot;

Ideologically SIIC differs from Muqtada al-Sadr and its sometime ally Islamic Dawa Party, in favoring a decentralized Iraq state with an autonomous Shia zone in the south.

===2009 governorate elections===
During the 2009 Iraqi governorate elections ISCI ran under the name &quot;al-Mehrab Martyr List&quot;, the ISCI did not perform as well as they hoped to, winning 6.6% of vote and 52 out of 440 seats. They did however come second in the election.

==Iranian support==
In a BBC interview in London, Ghazi al-Yawar the Sunni Arab sheik, cited reports that Iran sent close to a million people to Iraq and covertly supplied Shia religious groups with money to help compete in the elections. But U.S. and Iraqi officials say that many of the migrants crossing the largely unmonitored border are Iraqi Shia families who fled Saddam Hussein&#x27;s repression, particularly after the failed Shia uprising that followed the 1991 Gulf war.

==Supreme Council name change==
The Council was formerly known as SCIRI, but in a statement released May 11, 2007 SCIRI officials told Reuters the Islamist party would change its name to reflect what they called the changing situation in Iraq, removing the word &quot;Revolution&quot; because that was seen as a reference to overthrowing the Ba&#x27;athist government. &quot;Our name will change to the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council. Other things will change as well,&quot; said the SCIRI official.

Expressing the council&#x27;s rejection of the &quot;concept of a civil or sectarian war,&quot; the statement accused terrorists, extremists and supporters of Takfiri (accusing someone of unbelief) of causing bloodshed in Iraq.

<text>In Norse mythology, a valkyrie ( or ; from ) is one of a host of female figures who guide souls of the dead to the god Odin&#x27;s hall Valhalla. There, the deceased warriors become (&#x27;single fighters&#x27; or &#x27;once fighters&#x27;). When the are not preparing for the cataclysmic events of Ragnarök, the valkyries bear them mead. Valkyries also appear as lovers of heroes and other mortals, where they are sometimes described as the daughters of royalty, sometimes accompanied by ravens and sometimes connected to swans or horses.

Valkyries are attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; (a book of poems compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources), the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, the (both by Snorri Sturluson) and the (one of the Sagas of Icelanders), all written—or compiled—in the 13th century. They appear throughout the poetry of skalds, in a 14th-century charm, and in various runic inscriptions.

The Old English cognate term appears in several Old English manuscripts, and scholars have explored whether the term appears in Old English by way of Norse influence, or reflects a tradition also native among the Anglo-Saxon pagans. Scholarly theories have been proposed about the relation between the valkyries, the Norns, and the , all of which are supernatural figures associated with fate. Archaeological excavations throughout Scandinavia have uncovered amulets theorized as depicting valkyries. In modern culture, valkyries have been the subject of works of art, musical works, comic books, video games and poetry.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;valkyrie&quot; derives from Old Norse &#x27; (plural ), which is composed of two words: the noun &#x27; (referring to the slain on the battlefield) and the verb &#x27; (meaning &quot;to choose&quot;). Together, they mean &#x27;chooser of the slain&#x27;. The Old Norse is cognate to Old English &#x27;. From the Old English and Old Norse forms, philologist Vladimir Orel reconstructs the Proto-Germanic form . However, the term may have been borrowed into Old English from Old Norse: see discussion in the Old English attestations section below.

Other terms for valkyries in Old Norse sources include (&quot;wish maid&quot;), appearing in the poem , and (&quot;Odin&#x27;s maids&quot;), appearing in the . may be related to the Odinic name (roughly meaning &quot;wish fulfiller&quot;), referring to the fact that Odin receives slain warriors in Valhalla.

The name &quot;Randalín&quot;, which Aslaug is called in &quot;Ragnars saga loðbrókar&quot;, when she joins her sons to avenge their brothers Agnarr and Eric in Sweden, is probably from &quot;Randa-Hlín&quot;, which means &quot;shield-goddess&quot;, i.e. a kenning for &quot;Valkyrie&quot;.

==Old Norse attestations==

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
Valkyries are mentioned or appear in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poems &quot;Völuspá&quot;, &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, &quot;Völundarkviða&quot;, &quot;Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar&quot;, &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot;, &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot; and &quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot;.

====&quot;Völuspá&quot; and &quot;Grímnismál&quot;====

In stanza 30 of the poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, a völva (a travelling seeress in Norse society) tells Odin that &quot;she saw&quot; valkyries coming from far away who are ready to ride to &quot;the realm of the gods&quot;. The völva follows this with a list of six valkyries: Skuld (Old Norse, possibly &quot;debt&quot; or &quot;future&quot;) who &quot;bore a shield&quot;, Skögul (&quot;shaker&quot;), Gunnr (&quot;war&quot;), Hildr (&quot;battle&quot;), Göndul (&quot;wand-wielder&quot;) and Geirskögul (&quot;Spear-Skögul&quot;). Afterwards, the völva tells him she has listed the &quot;ladies of the War Lord, ready to ride, valkyries, over the earth&quot;.

In the poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, Odin (disguised as &quot;Grímnir&quot;), tortured, starved and thirsty, tells the young Agnar that he wishes that the valkyries Hrist (&quot;shaker&quot;) and Mist (&quot;cloud&quot;) would &quot;bear him a [drinking] horn&quot;, then provides a list of 11 more valkyries who he says &quot;bear ale to the einherjar&quot;; Skeggjöld (&quot;axe-age&quot;), Skögul, Hildr, Þrúðr (&quot;power&quot;), Hlökk (&quot;noise&quot;, or &quot;battle&quot;), Herfjötur (&quot;host-fetter&quot;), Göll (&quot;tumult&quot;), Geirahöð (&quot;spear-fight&quot;), Randgríð (&quot;shield-truce&quot;), Ráðgríð (&quot;council-truce&quot;) and Reginleif (&quot;power-truce&quot;).

====&quot;Völundarkviða&quot;====

A prose introduction in the poem &quot;Völundarkviða&quot; relates that the brothers Slagfiðr, Egil and Völund dwelt in a house sited in a location called Úlfdalir (&quot;wolf dales&quot;). There, early one morning, the brothers find three women spinning linen on the shore of the lake Úlfsjár (&quot;wolf lake&quot;), and &quot;near them were their swan&#x27;s garments; they were valkyries&quot;. Two daughters of King Hlödvér are named Hlaðguðr svanhvít (&quot;swan-white&quot;) and Hervör alvitr (possibly meaning &quot;all-wise&quot; or &quot;strange creature&quot;); the third, daughter of Kjárr of Valland, is named Ölrún (possibly meaning &quot;beer rune&quot;). The brothers take the three women back to their hall with them—Egil takes Ölrún, Slagfiðr takes Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund takes Hervör alvitr. They live together for seven winters, until the women fly off to go to a battle and do not return. Egil goes off in snow-shoes to look for Ölrún, Slagfiðr goes searching for Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund sits in Úlfdalir.

====&quot;Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar&quot;====

In the poem &quot;Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar&quot;, a prose narrative says that an unnamed and silent young man, the son of the Norwegian King Hjörvarðr and Sigrlinn of Sváfaland, witnesses nine valkyries riding by while sitting atop a burial mound. He finds one particularly striking; this valkyrie is detailed later in a prose narrative as Sváva, King Eylimi&#x27;s daughter, who &quot;often protected him in battles&quot;. The valkyrie speaks to the unnamed man, and gives him the name &quot;Helgi&quot; (meaning &quot;the holy one&quot;). The previously silent Helgi speaks; he refers to the valkyrie as &quot;bright-face lady&quot;, and asks her what gift he will receive with the name she has bestowed upon him, but he will not accept it if he cannot have her as well. The valkyrie tells him she knows of a hoard of swords in Sigarsholm, and that one of them is of particular importance, which she describes in detail. Further into the poem, Atli flytes with the female jötunn Hrímgerðr. While flyting with Atli, Hrímgerðr says that she had seen 27 valkyries around Helgi, yet one particularly fair valkyrie led the band:
After Hrímgerðr is turned to stone by the daylight, a prose narrative continues that Helgi, who is now king, goes to Sváva&#x27;s father—King Eylimi—and asks for his daughter. Helgi and Sváva are betrothed and love one another dearly. Sváva stays at home with King Eylimi, and Helgi goes raiding, and to this the narrative adds that Sváva &quot;was a valkyrie just as before&quot;. The poem continues, and, among various other events, Helgi dies from a wound received in battle. A narrative at the end of the poem says that Helgi and his valkyrie wife Sváva &quot;are said to be reincarnated&quot;.

====&quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot;====

In the poem &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot;, the hero Helgi Hundingsbane sits in the corpse-strewn battlefield of Logafjöll. A light shines from the fell, and from that light strike bolts of lightning. Flying through the sky, helmeted valkyries appear. Their waist-length mail armour is drenched in blood; their spears shine brightly:
In the stanza that follows, Helgi asks the valkyries (who he refers to as &quot;southern goddesses&quot;) if they would like to come home with the warriors when night falls (all the while arrows were flying). The battle over, the valkyrie Sigrún (&quot;victory-rune&quot;), informs him from her horse that her father Högni has betrothed her to Höðbroddr, the son of king Granmar of the Hniflung clan, who Sigrún deems unworthy. Helgi assembles an immense host to ride to wage battle at Frekastein against the Hniflung clan to assist Sigrún in her plight to avoid her betrothment. Later in the poem, the hero Sinfjötli flytes with Guðmundr. Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been female, and gibes that Guðmundr was &quot;a witch, horrible, unnatural, among Odin&#x27;s valkyries&quot;, adding that all of the einherjar &quot;had to fight, headstrong woman, on your account&quot;. Further in the poem, the phrase &quot;the valkyrie&#x27;s airy sea&quot; is used for &quot;mist&quot;.

Towards the end of the poem, valkyries again descend from the sky, this time to protect Helgi amid the battle at Frekastein. After the battle, all the valkyries fly away but Sigrún and wolves (referred to as &quot;the troll-woman&#x27;s mount&quot;) consume corpses:
The battle won, Sigrún tells Helgi that he will become a great ruler and pledges herself to him.

====&quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot;====

At the beginning of the poem &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot;, a prose narrative says that King Sigmund (son of Völsung) and his wife Borghild (of Brálund) have a son named Helgi, who they named for Helgi Hjörvarðsson (the protagonist of the earlier &quot;Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar&quot;). After Helgi has killed King Hunding in stanza 4, a prose narrative says that Helgi escapes, consumes the raw meat of cattle he has slaughtered on a beach, and encounters Sigrún. Sigrún, daughter of King Högni, is &quot;a valkyrie and rode through air and sea&quot;, and she is the valkyrie Sváva reincarnated. In stanza 7, Sigrún uses the phrase &quot;fed the gosling of Gunn&#x27;s sisters&quot;. Gunnr and her sisters are valkyries, and these goslings are ravens, who feed on the corpses left on the battlefield by warriors.

After stanza 18, a prose narrative relates that Helgi and his immense fleet of ships are heading to Frekastein, but encounter a great storm. Lightning strikes one of the ships. The fleet sees nine valkyries flying through the air, among whom they recognise Sigrún. The storm abates, and the fleets arrive safely at land. Helgi dies in battle, yet returns to visit Sigrún from Valhalla once in a burial mound, and at the end of the poem, a prose epilogue explains that Sigrún later dies of grief. The epilogue details that &quot;there was a belief in the pagan religion, which we now reckon [is] an old wives&#x27; tale, that people could be reincarnated&quot; and that &quot;Helgi and Sigrun were thought to have been reborn&quot; as another Helgi and valkyrie couple; Helgi as Helgi Haddingjaskaði and Sigrún as the daughter of Halfdan; the valkyrie Kára. The epilogue details that further information about the two can be found in the (now lost) work &quot;Káruljóð&quot;.

====&quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot;====

In the prose introduction to the poem &quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot;, the hero Sigurd rides up to Hindarfell and heads south towards &quot;the land of the Franks&quot;. On the mountain Sigurd sees a great light, &quot;as if fire were burning, which blazed up to the sky&quot;. Sigurd approaches it, and there he sees a &quot;skjaldborg&quot; with a banner flying overhead. Sigurd enters the &quot;skjaldborg&quot;, and sees a warrior lying there—asleep and fully armed. Sigurd removes the helmet of the warrior, and sees the face of a woman. The woman&#x27;s corslet is so tight that it seems to have grown into the woman&#x27;s body. Sigurd uses his sword Gram to cut the corslet, starting from the neck of the corslet downwards, he continues cutting down her sleeves, and takes the corslet off of her.

The woman wakes, sits up, looks at Sigurd, and the two converse in two stanzas of verse. In the second stanza, the woman explains that Odin placed a sleeping spell on her she could not break, and due to that spell she has been asleep a long time. Sigurd asks for her name, and the woman gives Sigurd a horn of mead to help him retain her words in his memory. The woman recites a heathen prayer in two stanzas. A prose narrative explains that the woman is named Sigrdrífa and that she is a valkyrie.

A narrative relates that Sigrdrífa explains to Sigurd that there were two kings fighting one another. Odin had promised one of these—Hjalmgunnar—victory in battle, yet she had &quot;brought down&quot; Hjalmgunnar in battle. Odin pricked her with a sleeping-thorn in consequence, told her she would never again &quot;fight victoriously in battle&quot;, and condemned her to marriage. In response, Sigrdrífa told Odin she had sworn a great oath that she would never wed a man who knew fear. Sigurd asks Sigrdrífa to share with him her wisdom of all worlds. The poem continues in verse, where Sigrdrífa provides Sigurd with knowledge in inscribing runes, mystic wisdom, and prophecy.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, valkyries are first mentioned in chapter 36 of the book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, where the enthroned figure of High informs Gangleri (King Gylfi in disguise) of the activities of the valkyries and mentions a few goddesses. High says &quot;there are still others whose duty it is to serve in Valhalla. They bring drink and see to the table and the ale cups.&quot; Following this, High gives a stanza from the poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot; that contains a list of valkyries. High says &quot;these women are called valkyries, and they are sent by Odin to every battle, where they choose which men are to die and they determine who has victory&quot;. High adds that Gunnr (&quot;war&quot;), Róta, and Skuld—the last of the three he refers to as &quot;the youngest norn&quot;—&quot;always ride to choose the slain and decide the outcome of battle&quot;. In chapter 49, High describes that when Odin and his wife Frigg arrived at the funeral of their slain son Baldr, with them came the valkyries and also Odin&#x27;s ravens.

References to valkyries appear throughout the book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, which provides information about skaldic poetry. In chapter 2, a quote is given from the work &quot;Húsdrápa&quot; by the 10th century skald Úlfr Uggason. In the poem, Úlfr describes mythological scenes depicted in a newly built hall, including valkyries and ravens accompanying Odin at Baldr&#x27;s funeral feast:
Further in chapter 2, a quote from the anonymous 10th century poem &quot;Eiríksmál&quot; is provided (see the &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; section below for more detail about the poem and another translation):
In chapter 31, poetic terms for referring to a woman are given, including &quot;[a] woman is also referred to in terms of all Asyniur or valkyries or norns or &quot;dísir&quot;&quot;. In chapter 41, while the hero Sigurd is riding his horse Grani, he encounters a building on a mountain. Within this building Sigurd finds a sleeping woman wearing a helmet and a coat of mail. Sigurd cuts the mail from her, and she awakes. She tells him her name is Hildr, and &quot;she is known as Brynhildr, and was a valkyrie&quot;.

In chapter 48, poetic terms for &quot;battle&quot; include &quot;weather of weapons or shields, or of Odin or valkyrie or war-kings or their clash or noise&quot;, followed by examples of compositions by various skalds that have used the name of valkyries in said manner (Þorbjörn Hornklofi uses &quot;Skögul&#x27;s din&quot; for &quot;battlefield&quot;, Bersi Skáldtorfuson uses &quot;Gunnr&#x27;s fire&quot; for &quot;sword&quot; and &quot;Hlökk&#x27;s snow&quot; for &quot;battle&quot;, Einarr Skúlason uses &quot;Hildr&#x27;s sail&quot; for &quot;shield&quot; and &quot;Göndul&#x27;s crushing wind&quot; for &quot;battle&quot; and Einarr skálaglamm uses &quot;Göndul&#x27;s din&quot;). Chapter 49 gives similar information when referring to weapons and armor (though the term &quot;death-maidens&quot;—Old Norse &quot;valmeyjar&quot;—instead of &quot;valkyries&quot; is used here), with further examples. In chapter 57, within a list of names of ásynjur (and after alternate names for the goddess Freyja are provided), a further section contains a list of &quot;Odin&#x27;s maids&quot;; valkyries: Hildr, Göndul, Hlökk, Mist, Skögul. And then an additional four names; Hrund, Eir, Hrist and Skuld. The section adds that &quot;they are called norns who shape necessity&quot;.

Some manuscripts of the feature &quot;Nafnaþulur&quot; section of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; contain an extended list of 29 valkyrie names (listed as the &quot;valkyries of Viðrir&quot;—a name of Odin). The first stanza lists: Hrist, Mist, Herja, Hlökk, Geiravör, Göll, Hjörþrimul, Guðr, Herfjötra, Skuld, Geirönul, Skögul and Randgníð. The second stanza lists: Ráðgríðr, Göndul, Svipul, Geirskögul, Hildr, Skeggöld, Hrund, Geirdriful, Randgríðr, Þrúðr, Reginleif, Sveið, Þögn, Hjalmþrimul, Þrima and Skalmöld.

===&quot;Hrafnsmál&quot;===

The fragmentary skaldic poem &quot;Hrafnsmál&quot; (generally accepted as authored by 9th century Norwegian skald Þorbjörn Hornklofi) features a conversation between a valkyrie and a raven, largely consisting of the life and deeds of Harald I of Norway. The poem begins with a request for silence among noblemen so that the skald may tell the deeds of Harald Fairhair. The narrator states that they once overheard a &quot;high-minded&quot;, &quot;golden-haired&quot; and &quot;white-armed&quot; maiden speaking with a &quot;glossy-beaked raven&quot;. The valkyrie considers herself wise, understands the speech of birds, is further described as having a white-throat and sparkling eyes, and she takes no pleasure in men:
The valkyrie, previously described as fair and beautiful, then speaks to the gore-drenched and corpse-reeking raven:
The black raven shakes himself, and he responds that he and the rest of the ravens have followed Harald since hatching from their eggs. The raven expresses surprise that the valkyrie seems unfamiliar with the deeds of Harald, and tells her about his deeds for several stanzas. At stanza 15, a question and answer format begins where the valkyrie asks the raven a question regarding Harald, and the raven responds in turn. This continues until the poem ends abruptly.

===&quot;Njáls saga&quot;===

In chapter 156 of &quot;Njáls saga&quot;, a man named Dörruð witnesses 12 people riding together to a stone hut on Good Friday in Caithness. The 12 go into the hut and Dörruð can no longer see them. Dörruð goes to the hut, and looks through a chink in the wall. He sees that there are women within, and that they have set up a particular loom; the heads of men are the weights, the entrails of men are the warp and weft, a sword is the shuttle, and the reels are composed of arrows. The women sing a song called &quot;Darraðarljóð&quot;, which Dörruð memorizes.

The song consists of 11 stanzas, and within it the valkyries weave and choose who is to be slain at the Battle of Clontarf (fought outside Dublin in 1014 CE). Of the 12 valkyries weaving, six have their names given in the song: Hildr, Hjörþrimul, Sanngriðr, Svipul, Guðr and Göndul. Stanza 9 of the song reads:
At the end of the poem, the valkyries sing &quot;start we swiftly with steeds unsaddled—hence to battle with brandished swords!&quot; The prose narrative picks up again, and says that the valkyries tear their loom down and into pieces. Each valkyrie holds on to what she has in her hands. Dörruð leaves the chink in the wall and heads home, and the women mount their horses and ride away; six to the south and six to the north.

===&quot;Heimskringla&quot;===

At the end of the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; saga &quot;Hákonar saga góða&quot;, the poem &quot;Hákonarmál&quot; by the 10th century skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir is presented. The saga relates that king Haakon I of Norway died in battle, and although he is Christian, he requests that since he has died &quot;among heathens, then give me such burial place as seems most fitting to you&quot;. The saga relates that shortly after Haakon died on the same slab of rock that he was born upon, he was greatly mourned by friend and foe alike, and that his friends moved his body northward to Sæheim in North Hordaland. Haakon was buried there in a large burial mound in full armour and his finest clothing, yet with no other valuables. Further, &quot;words were spoken over his grave according to the custom of heathen men, and they put him on the way to Valhalla&quot;. The poem &quot;Hákonarmál&quot; is then provided.

In &quot;Hákonarmál&quot;, Odin sends forth the two valkyries Göndul and Skögul to &quot;choose among the kings&#x27; kinsmen&quot; and who in battle should dwell with Odin in Valhalla. A battle rages with great slaughter, and part of the description employs the kenning &quot;Skögul&#x27;s-stormblast&quot; for &quot;battle&quot;. Haakon and his men die in battle, and they see the valkyrie Göndul leaning on a spear shaft. Göndul comments that &quot;groweth now the gods&#x27; following, since Hákon has been with host so goodly bidden home with holy godheads&quot;. Haakon hears &quot;what the valkyries said&quot;, and the valkyries are described as sitting &quot;high-hearted on horseback&quot;, wearing helmets, carrying shields and that the horses wisely bore them. A brief exchange follows between Haakon and the valkyrie Skögul:
Skögul says that they shall now ride forth to the &quot;green homes of the godheads&quot; to tell Odin the king will come to Valhalla. The poem continues, and Haakon becomes a part of the einherjar in Valhalla, awaiting to do battle with the monstrous wolf Fenrir.

===&quot;Fagrskinna&quot;===
In chapter 8 of &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;, a prose narrative states that, after the death of her husband Eric Bloodaxe, Gunnhild Mother of Kings had a poem composed about him. The composition is by an anonymous author from the 10th century and is referred to as &quot;Eiríksmál&quot;. It describes Eric Bloodaxe and five other kings arriving in Valhalla after their death. The poem begins with comments by Odin (as Old Norse &quot;Óðinn&quot;):
The god Bragi asks where a thundering sound is coming from, and says that the benches of Valhalla are creaking—as if the god Baldr had returned to Valhalla—and that it sounds like the movement of a thousand. Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.

===Ragnhild Tregagás charm===
A witchcraft trial held in 1324 in Bergen, Norway, records a spell used by the accused Ragnhild Tregagás to end the marriage of her former lover, a man named Bárd. The charm contains a mention of the valkyrie Göndul being &quot;sent out&quot;:
==Old English attestations==

The Old English appears several times in Old English manuscripts, generally to translate foreign concepts into Old English. It is used in the sermon , where it is thought to appear as a word for a human &quot;sorceress&quot;. An early 11th-century manuscript of Aldhelm&#x27;s (Oxford, Bodleian library, Digby 146) glosses with (with meaning &quot;goddess&quot;). is used to translate the names of the classical furies in two manuscripts (Cotton Cleopatra A. iii, and the older &quot;Corpus Glossary&quot;). In the manuscript Cotton Cleopatra A. iii, is also used to gloss the Roman goddess Bellona. A description of a raven flying over the Egyptian army appears as (meaning &quot;dark one choosing the slain&quot;). Scholarly theories debate whether these attestations point to an indigenous belief among the Anglo-Saxons shared with the Norse, or if they were a result of later Norse influence (see section below).

==Archaeological record==

===Female figures, cups, and horn-bearers===
Viking Age stylized silver amulets depicting women wearing long gowns, their hair pulled back and knotted into a ponytail, sometimes bearing drinking horns, have been discovered throughout Scandinavia. These figures are commonly considered to represent valkyries or dísir. According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the amulets appear in Viking Age graves, and were presumably placed there because &quot;they were thought to have protective powers&quot;.

The Tjängvide image stone from the Baltic island of Gotland, Sweden features a rider on an eight-legged horse, which may be Odin&#x27;s eight-legged horse Sleipnir, being greeted by a female figure, which may be a valkyrie at Valhalla. The 11th century runestone U 1163 features a carving of a female figure bearing a horn that has been interpreted as the valkyrie Sigrdrífa handing the hero Sigurd (also depicted on the stone) a drinking horn.

In 2013, a small figure dated at around 800 AD was discovered in Hårby, Denmark by three amateur archaeologists. The figurine portrays a woman with long hair knotted into a ponytail who is wearing a long dress which is sleeveless and vest like at the top. Over the top of her dress she is wearing an embroidered apron. Her clothing keeps the woman&#x27;s arms unobstructed so she can fight with the sword and shield she is holding. Commenting on the figure, archaeologist Mogens Bo Henriksen said that &quot;there can hardly be any doubt that the figure depicts one of Odin&#x27;s valkyries as we know them from the sagas as well as from Swedish picture stones from the time around AD700&quot;.

===Runic inscriptions===

Specific valkyries are mentioned on two runestones; the early 9th century Rök runestone in Östergötland, Sweden, and the 10th-century Karlevi Runestone on the island of Öland, Sweden, which mentions the valkyrie Þrúðr. On the Rök runestone, a kenning is employed that involves a valkyrie riding a wolf as her steed:
Among the Bryggen inscriptions found in Bergen, Norway, is the &quot;valkyrie stick&quot; from the late 14th century. The stick features a runic inscription intended as a charm. The inscription says that &quot;I cut cure-runes&quot;, and also &quot;help-runes&quot;, once against elves, twice against trolls, thrice against thurs and then a mention of a valkyrie occurs:
This is followed by &quot;I send you, I look at you, wolfish perversion, and unbearable desire, may distress descend on you and &quot;jöluns&quot; wrath. Never shall you sit, never shall you sleep ... (that you) love me as yourself.&quot; According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the inscription &quot;seems to begin as a benevolent formulation before abruptly switching to the infliction of distress and misery, presumably upon the recipient of the charm rather than the baleful valkyrie&quot;, and they posit the final line appears &quot;to constitute a rather spiteful kind of charm aimed at securing the love of a woman&quot;.

MacLeod and Mees state that the opening lines of the charm correspond to the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot;, where the valkyrie Sigrdrífa provides runic advice, and that the meaning of the term &quot;skag&quot; is unclear, but a cognate exists in &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot; where Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been a &quot;&quot;skass&quot;-valkyrie&quot;. MacLeod and Mees believe the word means something like &quot;supernatural sending&quot;, and that this points to a connection to the Ragnhild Tregagás charm, where a valkyrie is also &quot;sent forth&quot;.

==Valkyrie-names==

The Old Norse poems &quot;Völuspá&quot;, &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, &quot;Darraðarljóð&quot; and the &quot;Nafnaþulur&quot; section of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, provide lists of valkyrie names. In addition, some valkyrie names appear solely outside of these lists, such as &quot;Sigrún&quot; (who is attested in the poems &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot; and &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot;). Many valkyrie names emphasize associations with battle and, in many cases, on the spear—a weapon heavily associated with the god Odin. Some scholars propose that the names of the valkyries themselves contain no individuality, but are rather descriptive of the traits and nature of war-goddesses, and are possibly the descriptive creations of skalds.

Some valkyrie names may be descriptive of the roles and abilities of the valkyries. The valkyrie name &quot;Herja&quot; has been theorised as pointing to a connection to the name of the goddess &quot;Hariasa&quot;, who is attested from a stone from 187 CE. The name &quot;Herfjötur&quot; has been theorised as pointing to the ability of the valkyries to place fetters. The name &quot;Svipul&quot; may be descriptive of the influence the valkyries have over wyrd or ørlog—a Germanic concept of fate.

==Theories==

===Old English and Old English charms===

Richard North says that the description of a raven flying over the Egyptian army (glossed as ) may have been directly influenced by the Old Norse concept of Valhalla, the usage of in may represent a loan or loan-translation of Old Norse , but the Cotton Cleopatra A. iii and the &quot;Corpus Glossary&quot; instances &quot;appear to show an Anglo-Saxon conception of that was independent of contemporary Scandinavian influence&quot;.

Two Old English charms mention figures that are theorised as representing an Anglo-Saxon notion of valkyries or valkyrie-like female beings; , a charm to cure a sudden pain or stitch, and &quot;For a Swarm of Bees&quot;, a charm to keep honey bees from swarming. In , a sudden pain is attributed to a small, &quot;shrieking&quot; spear thrown with supernatural strength () by &quot;fierce&quot; loudly flying &quot;mighty women&quot; () who have ridden over a burial mound:

Theories have been proposed that these figures are connected to valkyries. Richard North says that &quot;though it is not clear what the poet takes these women to be, their female sex, riding in flight and throwing spears suggest that they were imagined in England as women being analogous to the later Norse .&quot; Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes that was originally a battle spell that had, over time, been reduced to evoke &quot;a prosaic stitch in the side&quot;. Towards the end of &quot;For a Swarm of Bees&quot;, the swarming bees are referred to as &quot;victory-women&quot; (Old English ):

The term &quot;victory women&quot; has been theorised as pointing to an association with valkyries. This theory is not universally accepted, and the reference has also been theorised as a simple metaphor for the &quot;victorious sword&quot; (the stinging) of the bees.

===Merseburg Incantation, fetters, , and norns===
One of the two Old High German Merseburg Incantations call upon female beings—&quot;Idisi&quot;—to bind and hamper an army. The incantation reads:

&lt;poem&gt;Once the Idisi sat, sat here and there,
some bound fetters, some hampered the army,
some untied fetters:
Escape from the fetters, flee from the enemies.&lt;/poem&gt;

The &quot;Idisi&quot; mentioned in the incantation are generally considered to be valkyries. Rudolf Simek says that &quot;these Idisi are obviously a kind of valkyrie, as these also have the power to hamper enemies in Norse mythology&quot; and points to a connection with the valkyrie name (Old Norse &quot;army-fetter&quot;). Hilda R. Davidson compares the incantation to the Old English charm and theorises a similar role for them both.

Simek says that the West Germanic term &quot;Idisi&quot; (, , ) refers to a &quot;dignified, well respected woman (married or unmarried), possibly a term for any woman, and therefore glosses exactly Latin &quot; and that a link to the North Germanic term is reasonable to assume, yet not undisputed. In addition, the place name Idisiaviso (meaning &quot;plain of the Idisi&quot;) where forces commanded by Arminius fought those commanded by Germanicus at the Battle of the Weser River in 16 AD. Simek points to a connection between the name &quot;Idisiaviso&quot;, the role of the Idisi in one of the two Merseburg Incantations and valkyries.

Regarding the , Simek states that Old Norse appears commonly as simply a term for &quot;woman&quot;, just as Old High German , Old Saxon and Old English , and may have also been used to denote a type of goddess. According to Simek, &quot;several of the Eddic sources might lead us to conclude that the were valkyrie-like guardians of the dead, and indeed in I 19 the valkyries are even called &quot;Odin&#x27;s &quot;. The are explicitly called dead women in 28 and a secondary belief that the were the souls of dead women (see ) also underlies the of Icelandic folklore. Simek says that &quot;as the function of the matrons was also extremely varied—fertility goddess, personal guardians, but also warrior-goddesses—the belief in the , like the belief in the valkyries, norns and matrons, may be considered to be different manifestations of a belief in a number of female (half-?) goddesses.&quot;

Jacob Grimm states that, though the norns and valkyries are similar in nature, there is a fundamental difference between the two. Grimm states that a can be both norn and a valkyrie, &quot;but their functions are separate and usually the persons. The norns have to pronounce the fatum [fate], they sit on their chairs, or they roam through the country among mortals, fastening their threads. Nowhere is it said that they ride. The valkyrs &quot;ride&quot; to war, decide the issues of fighting, and conduct the fallen to heaven; their riding is like that of heroes and gods&quot;.

===Origins and development===
Various theories have been proposed about the origins and development of the valkyries from Germanic paganism to later Norse mythology. Rudolf Simek suggests valkyries were probably originally viewed as &quot;demons of the dead to whom warriors slain on the battlefield belonged&quot;, and that a shift in interpretation of the valkyries may have occurred &quot;when the concept of Valhalla changed from a battlefield to a warrior&#x27;s paradise&quot;. Simek says that this original concept was &quot;superseded by the shield girls—Irish female warriors who lived on like the &quot;einherjar&quot; in Valhall.&quot; Simek says that the valkyries were closely associated with Odin, and that this connection existed in an earlier role as &quot;demons of death&quot;. Simek states that due to the shift of concept, the valkyries became popular figures in heroic poetry, and during this transition were stripped of their &quot;demonic characteristics and became more human, and therefore become capable of falling in love with mortals [...].&quot; Simek says that the majority of the names of the valkyries point to a warlike function, that most of valkyrie names do not appear to be very old, and that the names &quot;mostly come from poetic creativity rather than from real folk-belief.&quot;

MacLeod and Mees theorise that &quot;the role of the corpse-choosing valkyries became increasingly confused in later Norse mythology with that of the Norns, the supernatural females responsible for determining human destiny [...].&quot;

Hilda Ellis Davidson says that, regarding valkyries, &quot;evidently an elaborate literary picture has been built up by generations of poets and storytellers, in which several conceptions can be discerned. We recognise something akin to Norns, spirits who decide destinies of men; to the seeresses, who could protect men in battle with their spells; to the powerful female guardian spirits attached to certain families, bringing luck to youth under their protection; even to certain women who armed themselves and fought like men, for whom there is some historical evidence from the regions round the Black Sea&quot;. She adds that there may also be a memory in this of a &quot;priestess of the god of war, women who officiated at the sacrificial rites when captives were put to death after battle.&quot;

Davidson places emphasis on the fact that &quot;valkyrie&quot; literally means &quot;chooser of the slain&quot;. She compares Wulfstan&#x27;s mention of a &quot;chooser of the slain&quot; in his &quot;Sermo Lupi ad Anglos&quot; sermon, which appears among &quot;a blacklist of sinners, witches and evildoers&quot;, to &quot;all the other classes whom he [Wulfstan] mentions&quot;, and concludes as those &quot;are human ones, it seems unlikely that he has introduced mythological figures as well.&quot; Davidson points out that Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan&#x27;s detailed account of a 10th-century Rus ship funeral on the Volga River features an &quot;old Hunnish woman, massive and grim to look upon&quot; (who Fadlan refers to as the &quot;Angel of Death&quot;) who organises the killing of the slave girl, and has two other women with her that Fadlan refers to as her daughters. Davidson says that &quot;it would hardly be surprising if strange legends grew up about such women, who must have been kept apart from their kind due to their gruesome duties. Since it was often decided by lot which prisoners should be killed, the idea that the god &quot;chose&quot; his victims, through the instrument of the priestesses, must have been a familiar one, apart from the obvious assumption that some were chosen to fall in war.&quot; Davidson says that it appears that from &quot;early times&quot; the Germanic peoples &quot;believed in fierce female spirits doing the command of the war god, stirring up disorder, taking part in battle, seizing and perhaps devouring the slain.&quot;

===Freyja and Fólkvangr===

The goddess Freyja and her afterlife field Fólkvangr, where she receives half of the slain, has been theorized as connected to the valkyries. Britt-Mari Näsström points out the description in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; where it is said of Freyja &quot;whenever she rides into battle she takes half of the slain&quot;, and interprets &quot;Fólkvangr&quot; as &quot;the field of the Warriors&quot;. Näsström notes that, just like Odin, Freyja receives slain heroes who have died on the battlefield, and that her house is Sessrumnir (which she translates as &quot;filled with many seats&quot;), a dwelling that Näsström posits likely fills the same function as Valhalla. Näsström comments that &quot;still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse view of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn and the other to Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally &#x27;the one who chooses the slain&#x27;.&quot;

Siegfried Andres Dobat comments that &quot;in her mythological role as the chooser of half the fallen warriors for her death-realm Fólkvangr, the goddess Freyja, however, emerges as the mythological role-model for the Valkyrjar and the dísir&quot;.

==Modern art==

Valkyries have been the subjects of various poems, stories, works of visual art, musical works, movies, TV-series and cartoons, comic books, and video games.

In poetry, valkyries appear in &quot;&quot;Die Walküren&quot; by H. Heine (appearing in &quot;Romanzero&quot;, 1847), &quot;&quot;Die Walküren&quot; (1864) by H. v. Linge, and &quot;&quot;Sköldmon&quot; (appearing in &quot;Gömda Land&quot;, 1904). In music, they appear in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; by Richard Wagner (1870), from which the &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; is the best-known theme. In literature, Valkyries make an appearance in Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s fairy tale &quot;The Marsh King&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

Works of visual art depicting valkyries include &quot;Die Walküren&quot; (sketch, 1818) by J. G. Sandberg, &quot;Reitende Walküre&quot; (fresco), previously located in Munich palace but now destroyed, 1865–66 by M. Echter, &quot;Valkyrien&quot; and &quot;Valkyriens død&quot; (paintings, both from 1860), &quot;Walkürenritt&quot; (etching, 1871) by A. Welti, &quot;Walkürenritt&quot; (woodcut, 1871) by T. Pixis, &quot;Walkürenritt&quot; (1872) by A. Becker (reproduced in 1873 with the same title by A. v. Heyde), &quot;Die Walkyren&quot; (charcoal, 1880) and &quot;Walkyren wählen und wecken die gefallenen Helden (Einherier), um sie vom Schlachtfield nach Walhall zu geleiten&quot; (painting, 1882) and &quot;Walkyrenschlacht&quot; (oil painting, 1884) by K. Ehrenberg, &quot;Walkürenritt&quot; (oil painting, 1888, and etching, 1890) by A. Welti, &quot;Walküre&quot; (statue) by H. Günther, &quot;Walkürenritt&quot; (oil painting) by H. Hendrich, &quot;Walkürenritt&quot; (painting) by F. Leeke, &quot;Einherier&quot; (painting, from around 1900), by K. Dielitz, &quot;The Ride of the Valkyries&quot; (painting, from around 1900) by J. C. Dollman, &quot;Valkyrie&quot; (statue, 1910) and &quot;Walhalla-freeze&quot; (located in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen, 1886–87), &quot;Walkyrien&quot; (print, 1915) by A. Kolb, and &quot;Valkyrier&quot; (drawing, 1925) by E. Hansen.

In comic books, a valkyrie is featured in the form of the eponymous Marvel Comics character Valkyrie (1972-onwards).

In movies, the aforementioned Marvel comic book character is depicted by Tessa Thompson in (2017), (2019), (2022) and The Marvels (2023). There is also a valkyrie in Battle Beyond the Stars (1980) and The Northman (2022). In TV, valkyries are featured in the Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd version of Der Ring des Nibelungen in the Merrie Melodies cartoon What&#x27;s Opera, Doc? (1957), and in the episode &quot;The Rheingold&quot; (2000) of .

In video games, valkyries are featured in Gauntlet (1985), the Valkyrie Profile series (1999-onwards), Age of Mythology (2002), Odin Sphere (2017; remake in 2016), God of War (2018) and God of War Ragnarök (2022), and Valkyrie Elysium (2022). The aforementioned Marvel character &quot;Valkyrie&quot; features in various video games based on Marvel comics and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Marvel Heroes and Lego Marvel&#x27;s Avengers (see full list in the Valkyrie article).
