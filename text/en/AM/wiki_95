<text>Palm Beach County is a county in the southeastern part of Florida, located in the Miami metropolitan area. It is Florida&#x27;s third-most populous county after Miami-Dade County and Broward County and the 26th-most populous in the United States, with 1,492,191 residents as of the 2020 census. Its county seat and largest city is West Palm Beach, which had a population of 117,415 as of 2020. Named after one of its oldest settlements, Palm Beach, the county was established in 1909, after being split from Miami-Dade County. The county&#x27;s modern-day boundaries were established in 1963.

Palm Beach County is one of the three counties that make up the Miami metropolitan area, which was home to 6.14 million people in 2020. The area has been increasing in population since the late 19th century, with the incorporation of West Palm Beach in 1894 and after Henry Flagler extended the Florida East Coast Railway and built the Royal Poinciana Hotel, The Breakers, and Whitehall. In 1928, the Okeechobee hurricane struck Palm Beach County and caused thousands of deaths. More recently, the county acquired national attention during the 2000 presidential election, when a controversial recount occurred.

In 2004, Palm Beach County was Florida&#x27;s wealthiest county, with a per capita personal income of $44,518. It leads the state in agricultural productivity; agriculture is Palm Beach County&#x27;s second-largest industry, after real estate development. In undeveloped (central and western) Palm Beach County there is significant tropical agricultural production, especially nurseries, truck crops (vegetables), and sugar cane. Palm Beach County has been called the &quot;Winter Vegetable Capital&quot; of the nation.

==History==

Around 12,000 years ago, Native Americans began migrating into Florida. An estimated 20,000 Native Americans lived in South Florida when the Spanish arrived. Their population diminished significantly by the 18th century, due to warfare, enslavement, and diseases from Europe. In 1513, Juan Ponce de León became the first European in modern-day Palm Beach County when he landed at the Jupiter Inlet. Among the first non-Native American residents were African Americans, many of whom were former slaves or immediate descendants of former slaves, arriving in what was then Spanish Florida in the late 17th century. Finding refuge among the Seminoles, the former slaves or descendants of former slaves fought alongside them against white settlers and bounty hunters during the Seminole Wars. Portions of the Second Seminole War occurred in Palm Beach County, including the Battles of the Loxahatchee in 1838.

The county&#x27;s oldest surviving structure, the Jupiter Lighthouse, was built in 1860, after receiving authorization to the land from President Franklin Pierce in 1854. During the American Civil War, Florida was a member of the Confederate States of America. Two Confederate adherents removed the lighting mechanism from the lighthouse. One of the men who removed the light, Augustus O. Lang, was also the first white settler in Palm Beach County. He built a palmetto shack along the eastern shore of Lake Worth in 1863 after abandoning the cause of the Confederacy. After the Civil War ended, the Jupiter Lighthouse was relit in 1866.

In October 1873, a hurricane caused a shipwreck between Biscayne Bay and the New River. The crew survived the wreck but nearly died due to starvation because of the desolation of the area. In response, five Houses of Refuge were built along the east coast of Florida from the Fort Pierce Inlet southward to Biscayne Bay. Orange Grove House of Refuge No. 3 was built near Delray Beach in 1876.

Very few people lived in modern-day Palm Beach County prior to the arrival of Henry Flagler, who first visited in the early 1890s. A Standard Oil tycoon, Flagler was instrumental in the county&#x27;s development around the turn of the century. First, he purchased land on both sides of Lake Worth. Other investors followed suit, causing a small boom and bringing in existing businesses and resulting in the establishment of many new businesses. The Royal Poinciana Hotel, constructed by Flagler and his constructed crews to accommodate wealthy tourists, opened for business in February 1894. About a month later, the Florida East Coast Railway, owned by Flagler, reached West Palm Beach. On November 5, 1894, Palm Beach County&#x27;s oldest city, West Palm Beach, was incorporated. In 1896, another hotel built by Flagler was opened, the Palm Beach Inn, later renamed The Breakers. He also constructed his own winter home, which he and his wife moved into in 1902. The arrivals of Major Nathan Boynton, Congressman William S. Linton, and railroad surveyor Thomas Rickards in the 1890s also proved important because they developed communities that later became Boynton Beach, Delray Beach, and Boca Raton, respectively.

The Florida Legislature voted to establish Palm Beach County in 1909, carving it out of what was then the northern portion of Dade County and initially including all of Lake Okeechobee. The southernmost part of Palm Beach County was separated to create the northern portion of Broward County in 1915, the northwestern portion became part of Okeechobee County in 1917, and southern Martin County was created from northernmost Palm Beach County in 1925. The boundaries remained the same until 1963, when the Florida Legislature reduced Palm Beach County&#x27;s share of Lake Okeechobee from about 80 percent to less than 40 percent and divided the lake more equitably among Glades, Hendry, Martin, and Okeechobee counties. A final change to the county&#x27;s boundaries occurred in 2009, when a small portion of land was given to Broward County.

The 1910s and much of the 1920s brought prosperity and rapid population growth to South Florida, coinciding with the Florida land boom of the 1920s. Many local historic districts and landmarks listed in the National Register of Historic Places in Palm Beach County were designed and constructed during the 1920s, with the main contributors being architects Maurice Fatio, Addison Mizner, Marion Sims Wyeth, and the firm Harvey and Clarke, which included Gustav Maass. Total property value in West Palm Beach skyrocketed from $13.6 million in 1920 to $61 million in 1925, before briefly reaching a pre-Great Depression peak of $89 million in 1929. The city&#x27;s population quadrupled between 1920 and 1927.

Early on September 17, 1928, the Okeechobee hurricane made landfall near West Palm Beach as a category-4 storm and crossed Lake Okeechobee shortly thereafter. While the hurricane caused catastrophic impact in eastern portions of the county, the Lake Okeechobee region suffered a much heavier loss of life. Wind-driven storm surge in the lake inundated hundreds of square miles, including the nearby communities of Belle Glade, Pahokee, and South Bay. At least 2,500 deaths occurred, many of whom were black migrant farmers. An assessment of impact throughout the county reported 552 businesses destroyed, 1,447 businesses damaged, 3,584 homes destroyed, and 11,409 homes damaged, leaving 4,008 families homeless. However, several cities were excluded, such as Boca Raton, Greenacres, Lantana, and South Palm Beach. Damage in South Florida totaled roughly $25 million. In response to the storm, the Herbert Hoover Dike was constructed to prevent a similar disaster.

As a result of 1926 Miami hurricane and the 1928 storm, Palm Beach County, along with the rest of South Florida, began suffering economic turmoil and pushed the region into the Great Depression, even before the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Housing prices dropped dramatically in the county, with the total real estate value in West Palm Beach falling to $41.6 million in 1930 and then to $18.2 million in 1935. However, the decade also brought an airport to the county. Morrison Field, later renamed the Palm Beach International Airport, opened in 1936.

After the U.S. entered World War II, it was converted to an Air Force Base in 1942. During the war, thousands of servicemen arrived in Palm Beach County for training and supporting the war effort. Following the conclusion of World War II, a number of veterans returned to the area for work, vacation, or retirement. The base was closed and became a commercial airport again in 1962. Migration to the county by workers, tourists, and retirees continued into the 21st century.

On August 28, 1949, a category-4 hurricane struck Lake Worth Beach with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h), causing considerable damage. Throughout Palm Beach County, the hurricane destroyed 65 homes and damaged 13,283 others.

The area&#x27;s first television station, WIRK-TV Channel 21, began broadcasting on September 13, 1953. It went off the air less than three years later. However, NBC affiliate WPTV-TV and CBS affiliate WPEC first aired in 1954 and 1955, respectively – both of which are still in existence today.

Richard Paul Pavlick nearly attempted to assassinate then President-elect John F. Kennedy while the family vacationed in Palm Beach in December 1960. On December 11, Pavlick forwent his attempt because Kennedy was with his wife, Jacqueline, and their two children. Four days later, Pavlick&#x27;s car, which had sticks of dynamite inside, was surrounded by police and he was arrested. Charges against Pavolick were dropped on December 2, 1963, 10 days after Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Additionally, a secret blast shelter was built on Peanut Island during his presidency because escalating Cold War tensions.

Hurricane David struck near West Palm Beach late on September 3, 1979, with sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). The storm&#x27;s winds shattered windows in stores near the coast and caused property damage. A few roofs were torn off, and numerous buildings were flooded from over 6 in (150 mm) of rainfall. Damage in the county reached $30 million, most of which was incurred to agriculture.

The county became the center of controversy during the 2000 presidential election. Allegedly, the &quot;butterfly ballot&quot;, designed by Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Theresa LePore, led to an unexpectedly large number of votes for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan, rather than for Democrat Al Gore. Due to the aforementioned &quot;butterfly ballot&quot; and the closeness of the statewide results between Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush, the Florida Supreme Court mandated manual recounts in all counties with disputed results. However, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the decision in Bush v. Gore on December 12, allowing Florida Secretary of the State Katherine Harris to award the 25 electoral votes to Bush, as Harris&#x27;s tally prior to the state-ordered recounts placed him ahead of Gore by 537 popular votes. In turn, this gave Bush victory in the national election.

Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, a Federal Bureau of Investigation investigation revealed that 12 of the 19 hijackers trained or resided in Palm Beach County during the months prior to the attacks. Later that month, during the anthrax attacks, a letter containing spores of this substance was mailed to the American Media, Inc. building in Boca Raton. Three people were exposed to the anthrax, including Robert Stevens, a photo editor who later died after an infection induced by exposure.

Three hurricanes severely impacted Palm Beach County in 2004 and 2005: Frances, Jeanne, and Wilma. On September 5, 2004, Frances made landfall in Martin County as a category-2 hurricane. With wind gusts in Palm Beach County peaking at , the storm inflicted structural damage on about 15,000 houses and 2,400 businesses. Six deaths occurred in the county. Jeanne struck near the same location as a category-3 hurricane on September 26, 2004. The storm also brought strong winds, with an official wind gust of . About 4,160 homes were damaged and 60 were destroyed. Jeanne left about $260 million in damage in the county. On October 24, 2005, Hurricane Wilma struck Collier County as a category-3 hurricane. The storm moved northeastward, directly crossing Palm Beach County. Several locations reported hurricane-force winds, including a wind gust of 117 mph (188 km/h) in Belle Glade. Over 90% of Florida Power &amp; Light customers lost electricity. Two deaths occurred in Palm Beach County. The storm inflicted some degree of impact to more than 55,000 homes and 3,600 businesses. Palm Beach County suffered about $2.9 billion in damages.

In August 2012, the outer bands of Hurricane Isaac dropped at least of rain near Lion Country Safari. The consequent flooding left neighborhoods in The Acreage, Loxahatchee, Loxahatchee Groves, Royal Palm Beach, and Wellington stranded for up to several days. As Hurricane Irma approached in September 2017, mandatory or voluntary evacuations were ordered for more than 290,000 residents of Palm Beach County. Although the storm passed well west of the county, much of the area experienced hurricane-force wind gusts, with a peak gust of in West Palm Beach. Impact was generally limited to widespread power outages and damaged trees and vegetation, though isolated property damage was reported. The storm left about $300 million in damage in the county, as well as five fatalities.

===Toponymy===

The coconut palm, &quot;Cocos nucifera&quot;, is not native to Florida (nor anywhere else in the United States). Its presence in what is today Palm Beach County is due to the shipwreck of the Spanish ship &quot;Providencia&quot; in 1878, near today&#x27;s Mar-a-Lago. It was traveling from Havana to Cádiz, Spain with a cargo of coconuts. The shipwreck was within walking distance of the shore—the Florida State Archives conserves a picture of a painting—and a deliberate grounding so as to obtain an insurance payout has been proposed. The coconuts were salvaged, too many to be eaten, and thousands were planted. A lush grove of palm trees soon grew on what was later named Palm Beach.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which are land and (17.3%) are covered by water. It is the second-largest county in Florida by land area and third-largest by total area. Much of the water is the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Okeechobee. The county has an estimated of farmland.

The eastern third of Palm Beach County is highly urbanized, while the central and western portions of the county are suburban or rural. Palm Beach County is one of three counties in the Miami metropolitan area. However, the county&#x27;s western communities along Lake Okeechobee, such as Belle Glade, South Bay, and Pahokee, have also been considered more part of the rural Florida Heartland.

The Atlantic coastline of Palm Beach County is about in length. It consists mainly of barrier islands and peninsulas, including Jupiter Island, Singer Island, and Palm Beach Island. These islands are separated from the mainland by the Intracoastal Waterway, with much of the waterway locally known as the Lake Worth Lagoon. The main barrier landmasses are split by four inlets: the Jupiter Inlet, the Lake Worth Inlet, the South Lake Worth Inlet, and the Boca Raton Inlet. Two of the four inlets are natural, but significantly altered – the Jupiter and Boca Raton inlets – while the Lake Worth and South Lake Worth inlets are man-made, with the former dug in the 1890s and the latter created between 1926 and 1927. Several other islands exist within the Intracoastal Waterway, including Hypoluxo Island, Munyon Island, and Peanut Island.

The Florida Department of Corrections operates the Glades Correctional Institution in an unincorporated area in Palm Beach County near Belle Glade.

Palm Beach County&#x27;s revenue from property taxes, sales taxes and tourist development taxes reached record levels in Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, according to the Clerk of the Circuit Court &amp; Comptroller, Palm Beach County&#x27;s annual financial report, &quot;Checks &amp; Balances: Your Guide to County Finances. &quot;

The County collected $1.1 billion in property tax revenue in FY 2018, an increase of 6 percent over the previous year. Sales tax collections rose to $175.8 million, marking the eighth consecutive year of growth. Revenue from Tourist Development Tax receipts was $53.8 million, up from $48.5 million in FY 2017. Meanwhile, Local Option Gas Taxes paid by motorists for gasoline decreased for the first time in five years, partially due to higher gasoline prices, which reduced the number of miles driven, according to the Clerk of the Circuit Court &amp; Comptroller&#x27;s &quot;Checks &amp; Balances&quot; report.

===County government===
The county is governed by a board of commissioners, consisting of seven commissioners, who are all elected from single-member districts. One of the commissioners is elected County Mayor and one of them is elected Vice Mayor. Commissioners serve staggered terms, and commissioners from Districts 1, 3, 5, and 7 are elected during presidential election years, while the commissioners from Districts 2, 4, and 6 are elected in gubernatorial election years.

Elected county officers include a clerk of courts and comptroller, sheriff, property appraiser, tax collector, and supervisor of elections. State officers serving the Florida judicial district include the state attorney and public defender. All positions are 4-year terms, requiring direct election by voters in presidential election years.

Five former county commissioners have been accused or found guilty of corruption from 2006 to 2009. A grand jury recommended a strong inspector general. This position was approved by county voters in 2010. A county judge found that the mandate covered municipal government in 2015.

As of 2025, the county has a slight Democratic plurality, with large Republican and independent minorities, respectively. In gubernatorial races, the county had been a stronghold for Democrats, a trend that began in 1990 and continued up until 2022, when Republican governor Ron DeSantis won the county with 51% of the vote against the backdrop of his landslide reelection.

Palm Beach County has supported the Democratic Party nominee for the presidency since 1992, though previously the county had been carried by the Republican Party nominee for every election from 1948 to 1988. Republicans have been gaining an increasing share of the votes in Palm Beach County since 2000. That year, Al Gore defeated George W. Bush in the county by a margin of approximately 27 percent, while Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump (who is a resident of the county) by less than 13 percentage points in 2020. This trend continued in 2024, when Kamala Harris won the county with just under 50% of the vote, the worst performance in the county by a Democrat since 1992.

==Transportation==

===Roadways===
An advocacy group has criticized
Palm Beach County&#x27;s roadways for being dangerous for non-motorized users. Local municipalities are working to increase safety, but county and state authorities have been hesitant to modify designs.

====Expressways====
* Interstate 95
* Florida&#x27;s Turnpike

I-95 and Florida&#x27;s Turnpike are controlled-access expressways that serve Palm Beach county. Southern Boulevard (signed SR 80/US 98), which runs east–west through central Palm Beach County, is a partial freeway from Interstate 95 in West Palm Beach to US 441/SR 7 in Wellington and Royal Palm Beach. In the late 1980s, there were plans to construct two additional expressways in Palm Beach County. One was to be an toll freeway from Royal Palm Beach to downtown West Palm Beach. It would have run between Belvedere Road and Okeechobee Boulevard; necessitating the destruction of several homes and churches along its path. The other proposed route was a northern extension of the Sawgrass Expressway which was to be called &quot;University Parkway&quot;. The University Parkway would have snaked around suburban developments west of Boca Raton, Delray Beach, and Boynton Beach; its path bordering the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Ultimately, both expressways were canceled due to opposition from county residents.

===Public libraries===
Palm Beach County is served by the Palm Beach County Library System, established in 1967 through a Special Act of the Florida Legislature, and operates as a department of county government. It is currently made up of 17 library branches, as well as a bookmobile which travels to more than 40 stops each month. As Palm Beach County continues to see population growth, the library system will also need to plan for continued expansion. Presently, the county is building a new 33,000-square-foot branch in the Canyon Town Center, located in western Boynton Beach. This new branch is projected to be completed in 2024. The system&#x27;s Main Library is located on Summit Boulevard in an unincorporated section of West Palm Beach. It is the largest provider of library services in the county, serving an area that is comparable to the size of the state of Delaware, with holdings of over 1.88 million items.

Unlike many county library systems, including neighboring Broward and Miami-Dade counties, several municipalities continue to operate their own libraries. The county library systems works together in a cooperative system model which allows interoperation between the county system and the 13 city libraries in Boca Raton, Boynton Beach, Delray Beach, Highland Beach, Lake Park, Lake Worth Beach, Lantana, Manalapan (J. Turner Moore Public Library), North Palm Beach, Palm Springs, Palm Beach (Society of the Four Arts), Riviera Beach, and West Palm Beach (Mandel Public Library of West Palm Beach).

The county&#x27;s first library began as a Free Reading Room in 1895 in West Palm Beach&#x27;s first church, the Union Congregational Church, when Reverend Asbury Caldwell began collecting books for a reading club he hoped would keep construction workers out of the city&#x27;s many drinking establishments located along First Street, or &quot;Thirst Street&quot; as it was known. The reading club floundered when Caldwell left West Palm Beach, but in 1899, the West Palm Beach Public Library got its official start, housed in a two-story former Palm Beach Yacht Club building donated by Commodore Charles John Clarke, a Palm Beach yachtsman, with the collection of books from the Reading Room and a $100 donation from Henry Flagler. A permanent building was constructed in 1924 in Flagler Park along the Intracoastal Waterway. Two additional buildings have also housed the library – one at 100 Clematis Street, a state-of-art building complete with a 250-seat auditorium that opened to much fanfare in 1964. The second, located at 411 Clematis Street, is a four-story building in the West Palm Beach City Center complex, which houses both city hall and the library, is two and one-half times the size of the previous building. In 2012, the West Palm Beach Public Library Foundation formally changed its name to the Mandel Public Library of West Palm Beach after receiving a $5 million grant from the Mandel Foundation.

<doc id="73648" wikidata="Q650250" url="?curid=73648" title="Elision">
<text>In linguistics, an elision or deletion is the omission of one or more sounds (such as a vowel, a consonant, or a whole syllable) in a word or phrase. However, these terms are also used to refer more narrowly to cases where two words are run together by the omission of a final sound. An example is the elision of word-final /t/ in English if it is preceded and followed by a consonant: &quot;first light&quot; is often pronounced &quot;firs&#x27; light&quot; (). Many other terms are used to refer to specific cases where sounds are omitted.

==Citation forms and contextual forms==
A word may be spoken individually in what is called the citation form. This corresponds to the pronunciation given in a dictionary. However, when words are spoken in context, it often happens that some sounds that belong to the citation form are omitted. Elision is not an all-or-nothing process: elision is more likely to occur in some styles of speaking and less likely in others. Many writers have described the styles of speech in which elision is most commonly found, using terms such as &quot;casual speech&quot;, &quot;spontaneous speech&quot;, &quot;allegro speech&quot; or &quot;rapid speech&quot;. In addition, what may appear to be the disappearance of a sound may in fact be a change in the articulation of a sound that makes it less audible. For example, it has been said that in some dialects of Spanish the word-final &quot;-ado&quot;, as in &quot;cansado&quot; (tired) is pronounced /ado/ in citation form but the /d/ is omitted in normal speech, giving &quot;cansao&quot;. More careful description will show that the Spanish phoneme /d/ is usually pronounced as a voiced dental fricative [ð] when it occurs between vowels. In casual speech it is frequently weakened to a voiced dental approximant [ð̞]. The most extreme possibility is complete elision resulting in a diphthong with no observable consonantal tongue gesture. In this view, elision is the final stage in lenition or consonant weakening, the last phase of a cline or continuum describable as d &gt; ð &gt; ð̞ &gt; ∅. Whether the elision is of vowel or consonant, if it is consistent through time, the form with elision may come to be accepted as the norm: &quot;tabula&quot; &gt; &quot;tabla&quot; as in Spanish, &quot;mutare&quot; &gt; &quot;muer&quot; (&quot;change, molt&quot;) in French, &quot;luna&quot; &gt; &quot;lua&quot; (&quot;moon&quot;) in Portuguese.
It is usual to explain elision and related connected-speech phenomena in terms of the principle of least effort or &quot;economy of effort&quot;. This concept has been stated as &quot;If a word or expression remains perfectly intelligible without a certain sound, people tend to omit that sound.&quot;

==Historical elisions==
There are various ways in which the present form of a language may reflect elisions that have taken place in the past. This topic is an area of diachronic linguistics. Such elisions may originally have been &quot;optional&quot; but have over time become &quot;obligatory&quot; (or mandatory). An example of historical elision in French that began at the phrasal level and became lexicalized is preposition &gt; in &quot;today&quot;, now felt by native speakers to be one word, but deriving from , literally &quot;at the day of today&quot; and meaning &quot;nowadays&quot;, although is no longer recognized as meaningful in French. In English, the word &quot;cupboard&quot; would originally have contained /p/ between /ʌ/ and /b/, but the /p/ is believed to have disappeared from the pronunciation of the word about the fifteenth century.

==Contractions==
In many languages there is a process similar but not identical to elision, called contraction, where common words that occur frequently together form a shortened pronunciation. This may be a historical case (for example, French &quot;&quot;ce est&quot; has become &quot;c&#x27;est&quot; /sɛ/ and it would now be incorrect to say &quot;ce est&quot;&quot; /sə ɛ/) or one that is still optional (in English, a speaker may say &quot;that is&quot; /ðæt ɪz/ or &quot;that&#x27;s&quot; /ðæts/). Contractions of both sorts are natural forms of the language used by native speakers and are often colloquial but not considered substandard. English contractions are usually vowel-less weak form words. In some cases the contracted form is not a simple matter of elision: for example, &quot;that&#x27;s&quot; as a contraction is made not only by the elision of the /ɪ/ of &quot;is&quot; but also by the change of final consonant from /z/ to /s/; &quot;won&#x27;t&quot; for &quot;will not&quot; requires not only the elision of the /ɒ/ of &quot;not&quot; but also the vowel change /ɪ/ → /oʊ/ and in English RP &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;shan&#x27;t&quot; change vowel from /æ/ of &quot;can&quot; and &quot;shall&quot; to /ɑː/ in /kɑːnt/, /ʃɑːnt/. In some languages employing the Latin alphabet, such as English, the omitted letters in a contraction are replaced by an apostrophe (e.g., &quot;isn&#x27;t&quot; for &quot;is not&quot;). Written Greek marks elisions in the same way.

==Elision in poetry==

Elision is frequently found in verse. It is sometimes explicitly marked in the spelling, and in other cases has to be inferred from knowledge of the metre. Elisions occurred regularly in Latin, but were not written, except in inscriptions and comedy. Elision of a vowel before a word starting in a vowel is frequent in poetry, where the metre sometimes requires it. For example, the opening line of Catullus 3 is Lugete, O Veneres Cupidinesque, but would be read as Lugeto Veneres Cupidinesque (audio). There are many examples of poetic contraction in English verse of past centuries marked by spelling and punctuation. Frequently found examples are over &gt; o&#x27;er and ever &gt; e&#x27;er. Multiple examples can be seen in lines such as the following from Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard by Thomas Gray, published in 1751:

*Th&#x27; applause of list&#x27;ning senates to command
*He gain&#x27;d from heav&#x27;n (&#x27;twas all he wish&#x27;d) a friend

==Deletion==
The term &quot;deletion&quot; is used in some modern work instead of &quot;elision&quot;. When contemporary or historic deletion is treated in terms of Generative phonology it is usual to explain the process as one of substituting zero for a phoneme, in the form of a phonological rule. The form of such rules is typically

 X --&gt; ∅ (i.e. the segment x becomes zero)

An example of a deletion rule (for /r/-deletion in English RP) is provided by Giegerich. If we start with the premise that the underlying form of the word &quot;hear&quot; has a final /r/ and has the phonological form /hɪər/, we need to be able to explain how /r/ is deleted at the end of &quot;hear&quot; but is not deleted in the derived word &quot;hearing&quot;. The difference is between word-final /r/ in &quot;hear&quot;, where the /r/ would form part of the rhyme of a syllable, and word-medial /r/ which would form the onset of the second syllable of &quot;hearing&quot;. The following rule deletes /r/ in &quot;hear&quot;, giving /hɪə/, but does not apply in the case of &quot;hearing&quot;, giving /hɪərɪŋ/.
 rhyme
 /r/ --&gt; ∅/ _____

==Examples==
===English===

Examples of elision in English:

Most elisions in English are not mandatory, but they are used in common practice and even sometimes in more formal speech. This applies to nearly all the examples in the above table. However, these types of elisions are rarely shown in modern writing and never shown in formal writing. In formal writing, the words are written the same whether or not the speaker would elide them, but in many plays and classic American literature, words are often written with an elision to demonstrate accent:

Other examples, such as &quot;him&quot; and &quot;going to&quot; shown in the table above, are generally used only in fast or informal speech. They are still generally written as is unless the writer intends to show the dialect or speech patterns of the speaker.

The third type of elision is in common contractions, such as &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;isn&#x27;t&quot;, or &quot;I&#x27;m&quot;. The apostrophes represent the sounds that are removed and are not spoken but help the reader to understand that it is a contraction and not a word of its own. These contractions used to be written out when transcribed (i.e. &quot;cannot&quot;, &quot;is not&quot;, &quot;I am&quot;) even if they were pronounced as a contraction, but now they are always written as a contraction so long as they are spoken that way. However, they are by no means mandatory and a speaker or writer may choose to keep the words distinct rather than contract them either as a stylistic choice, when using formal register, to make meaning clearer to children or non-native English speakers, or to emphasize a word within the contraction (e.g. &quot;I &quot;am&quot; going!&quot;)

In non-rhotic accents of English, is dropped unless it&#x27;s followed by a vowel, making &quot;cheetah&quot; and &quot;cheater&quot; completely homophonous. In non-rhotic accents spoken outside of North America, many instances of correspond to in North American English as and are used instead of .

===Finnish===
The consonant in the partitive case ending elides when it is surrounded by two short vowels except when the first of the two vowels involved is paragoge (added to the stem). Otherwise, it stays. For example, → , → , but → (not a short vowel), → (consonant stem), → (paragogic on a consonant stem).

===French===
Elision of unstressed vowels (usually ) is common in the French language and, in some cases, must be indicated orthographically with an apostrophe.

Elision of vowel and consonant sounds was also an important phenomenon in the phonological evolution of French. For example, &quot;s&quot; following a vowel and preceding another consonant regularly elided, with compensatory lengthening of the vowel.

===German===

Nouns and adjectives that end with unstressed &quot;el&quot; or &quot;er&quot; have the &quot;e&quot; elided when they are declined or a suffix follows. ex. becomes , , etc., and + becomes .

The final of a noun is also elided when another noun or suffix is concatenated onto it: + becomes .

In both of the above cases, the represents a schwa.

===Icelandic===

Elision () is common in Icelandic. There are a variety of rules for its occurrence, but the most notable is the loss of trailing consonants in common particles as well as the merger of similar vowel sounds. For example, the ubiquitous (verb) structure (&quot;I am verb-ing&quot;) becomes transformed to (verb); the full particles is spoken only when a person is sounding the sentence out word by word. Another noteworthy and extremely common example along this line includes the phrase (&quot;really?&quot;) which is pronounced as . A common example of internal consonant loss in Icelandic is (&quot;here you go&quot;, &quot;please&quot;), pronounced (the hidden sound is unrelated to the elision and occurs when a or precedes ). Another special case of elision is the loss of from the start of (&quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot;), which is sometimes pronounced ( (what is this?) -&gt; ). The pronunciation of the full word tends to lay emphasis on it (&quot;What is &quot;this&quot;?&quot;) while the elision of the word leads to its deemphasis (&quot;&quot;What&quot; is this?&quot;). The loss of the in is similar to how can be lost in &quot;that&quot; and &quot;this&quot; when asking a question and speaking swiftly in English.

===Irish===

Elision is found in the Ulster dialect of Irish, particularly in final position. , for example, while pronounced in the Conamara dialect, is pronounced in Ulster. is also elided when it begins intervocalic consonant clusters. is pronounced ; is pronounced .

===Japanese===

Elision is extremely common in the pronunciation of the Japanese language. In general, a high vowel ( or ) that appears in a low-pitched syllable between two voiceless consonants is devoiced and often deleted outright. However, unlike French or English, Japanese does not often show elision in writing. The process is purely phonetic and varies considerably depending on the dialect or level of formality. A few examples (slightly exaggerated; apostrophes added to indicate elision):

:松下さんはいますか？ &quot;Matsushita-san wa imasu ka?&quot; (&quot;Is Mr. Matsushita in?&quot;)
:Pronounced: &quot;matsush&#x27;tasanwa imas&#x27;ka&quot;

:失礼します &quot;Shitsurei shimasu&quot; (&quot;Excuse me&quot;)
:Pronounced: &quot;sh&#x27;tsureishimas&#x27; &quot;

Gender roles also influence elision in Japanese. It is considered masculine to elide, especially the final &quot;u&quot; of the polite verb forms (&quot;-masu&quot;, &quot;desu&quot;), but women are traditionally encouraged to do the opposite. However, excessive elision is generally associated with lower prestige, and inadequate elision is seen as overly fussy or old-fashioned. Some nonstandard dialects, such as Satsuma-ben, are known for their extensive elision.

It is common for successive o sounds to be reduced to a single o sound, as is frequently encountered when the particle を (wo/o) is followed by the beautifying or honorific お (o).

===Latin===
Latin poetry featured frequent elision, with syllables being dropped to fit the meter or for euphony. Words ending in vowels would elide with the following word if it started with a vowel or h; words ending with -m would also be elided in the same way (this is called ecthlipsis). In writing, unlike in Greek, this would not be shown, with the normal spelling of the word represented. For instance, line 5 of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; is written as &quot;, even though it would be pronounced as &quot;.

It is generally thought that elision in Latin poetry came from ordinary Latin pronunciation. However, at some points in speech where elision was standard in poetry, such as at the end of sentences, there was no elision in prose. Around 30 B.C., there was a sharp decline in the amount of elision. Later revived to a varying degree during the Silver Age, it then declined again.

Other examples of elision in Latin literature include:

*Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; Book I, Line 3: &quot; &quot; is pronounced &quot; &quot;, where &quot; &quot; comprises three long syllables, or one and a half spondees.
*Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; Book I, Line 11: &quot; &quot; is pronounced &quot; &quot;, where &quot; &quot; comprises three long syllables and two short syllables.
*Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; Book III, Line 557: &quot; &quot; is pronounced &quot; &quot;, where &quot; &quot; comprises two short syllables and a long syllable.
*Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Amores&quot; Book III, Poem VI, Line 101: &quot; &quot; is pronounced &quot; &quot;.
* Catullus 73 line 6, &quot;&quot;, has elision connecting the final six words together.
* Caecilius Statius&#x27;s &quot;Ephesio&quot; (quoted in Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Cato Maior de Senectute&quot; 25) has the line: &quot;&quot; where there is elision between every word.
* A line from Lucilius (600 Marx; 728 Warmington) similarly has elision connecting all its words: &quot;&quot;.

In a study of elision in Latin poetry, J. Soubiran argues that &quot;elision&quot; would better be called &quot;synaloepha&quot;, and the process understood as a merging of syllables, in most cases, rather than the loss of one.

===Malayalam===

Dropping sounds in connected speech by native speakers is very common in this language from Kerala, southern India. For example, &quot;entha&quot; becomes &quot;ntha&quot; and &quot;ippol&quot; becomes &quot;ippo&quot;.

===Spanish===

The change of Latin into the Romance languages included a significant amount of elision, especially syncope (loss of medial vowels). Spanish has these examples:

* from Latin 
* from Latin (through )
* from Latin (with dissimilation of &quot;-nm-&quot; to &quot;-lm-&quot;)
* from Latin (with lenition of &quot;f-&quot; to &quot;h-&quot; to ∅, dissimilation of &quot;-mn-&quot; to &quot;-mr-&quot; and then epenthesis of &quot;-mr-&quot; to &quot;-mbr-&quot;)
In addition, speakers often employ crasis or elision between two words to avoid a hiatus caused by vowels: the choice of which to use depends upon whether or not the vowels are identical. This is referred to as enlace or synalepha, and is especially common in poetry and songs. It is not necessarily indicated in writing, but often is in hymn music. It can appear as a breve below or an underscore between the adjacent words, e.g. &quot;por-que ̮en-ton-ces&quot; or &quot;por-que_en-ton-ces&quot;.

A frequent informal use is the elision of in the past participle suffix , pronouncing as . The elision of in is considered even more informal, but both elisions common in Andalusian Spanish. Thus, the Andalusian for (&quot;lament&quot;) has entered Standard Spanish as a term for a special feature of Flamenco singing. Similar distinctions are made with the words and as contracted versions of the literal translations for dancer and singer exclusively used for Flamenco, compared to the and of standard Spanish. The perceived vulgarity of the silent may lead to hypercorrections like * for (cod) or * for .

===Tamil===
Tamil has a set of rules for elision. They are categorised into classes based on the phoneme where elision occurs:

=== Urdu ===
In Pakistan, elision has become very common in speech. Commonly used words have single consonants or syllables removed in casual speech and it is becoming more acceptable in formal settings due to an increasing understandability and use. Although not seen when writing in the Urdu script (Nastaleeq), it is often seen in Roman Urdu (Latin alphabet) as the latter is more similar to vernacular Urdu. Most elisions occur by removing a vowel or the consonant /h/ or a combination of the two. Some widely-used examples are:

&quot;(The difference between the elision May and the original word Main is the lack of nasalization at the end in the former.)&quot;

In sentences, they may appear as:

&quot;Kya tum paṛ ray o?&quot; (&quot;Are you studying?&quot;) instead of &quot;Kya tum paṛh rahay ho?&quot;

Variations are also common where some individuals may prefer to pronounce a complete word such as &quot;paṛh&quot; while shortening the rest, depending on the preference of the person, their dialect, or their accent.

===Welsh===
Elision is a major feature of Welsh, found commonly in verb forms, such as in the following examples:
* - &#x27;Do you like the coffee?&#x27; (The definite article is always after a vowel even when the next word begins with a consonant, e.g. - &#x27;the cat is scratching&#x27;, but - &#x27;the black cat&#x27;.
* - &#x27;Where is the town?&#x27;
* - &#x27;I am reading&#x27;

Elision of word-final is almost always found in spoken Welsh to the point where the words are spelt with optional final in words like and has been eradicated from the inflected prepositions: , not * - &#x27;on me&#x27;, etc. These always retain their final in the literary register, however.

Welsh also displays elision of initial syllables in singular/plural or collective/singulative pairs where the plural or singulative becomes longer than two syllables. This, however, is now restricted to specific nouns and is not productive. E.g. - &#x27;sock / socks&#x27; where the initial has been lost in the plural; - &#x27;birds / a bird&#x27; where the initial has been lost in the singulative.

<text>Pasco County is a county located on the west central coast of the U.S. state of Florida. According to the 2020 census, the population was 561,691, making it the eleventh-most populous county in the state. Its county seat is Dade City, and its largest city is Zephyrhills. The county is named after Samuel Pasco.

Pasco County is included in the Tampa Bay Area and is primarily a bedroom community for Tampa and St. Petersburg.

It includes numerous parks and trails located along rivers, the Gulf of Mexico, lakes, and highway/railroad right-of-ways. Several nudist resorts are located in Pasco. It has become known as the &quot;naturist capital of the United States,&quot; beginning with a development in 1941. West Pasco includes retirement areas, commercial fishing, and suburbs of Tampa. The Suncoast Parkway as well as U.S. 19, U.S. 41, U.S. 98, U.S. 301, and Interstate 75 all pass through Pasco. The county is directly west of Polk and Sumter counties, north of Hillsborough and Pinellas counties, and south of Hernando County.

==History==

Pasco County was created on June 2, 1887, from the southern third of Hernando County. The same legislation also created Citrus County from the northern third of Hernando County. The county was named after Samuel Pasco, who had just been elected to the United States Senate.

Dade City was named the temporary county seat until a popular vote was held in 1889, at which time voters made Dade City the permanent county seat. As early as 1917, residents of the western part of the county proposed forming a separate county or merging with Pinellas County, as Dade City was not centrally located in the county. The issue was finally resolved in the late 1970s with the construction of identical government centers in both Dade City and New Port Richey.

The earliest towns were Anclote, Blanton, Dade City, Earnestville, Fort Dade (not to be confused with Fort Dade on Egmont Key), Macon (Trilby), Lacoochee, St. Leo, and San Antonio. Citrus was an important industry when the county was formed, although a decline followed a freeze in 1895. Several large sawmills operated in the county in the early part of the 20th century. 

During the Florida land boom of the 1920s, New Port Richey became the winter home of silent screen star Thomas Meighan and golfer Gene Sarazen; Meighan attempted to bring other Hollywood figures to the city. The county has experienced significant population growth since the 1960s. The growth began along the Gulf coast but is now occurring most rapidly in areas north of Tampa.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (14.0%) is water.

A portion of Eastern Pasco County contains rolling topography with elevations from , along with San Antonio and St. Leo.

===Adjacent counties===
* Hernando County—north
* Sumter County—northeast
* Polk County—southeast

* Pinellas County—southwest

===Climate===
The county has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and average temperatures in Dade City range from 59.2 °F in January to 82.1 °F in July and August while in Port Richey they range from 59.0 °F in January to 82.2 °F in August. PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University

==Transportation==

===Aviation===
* Zephyrhills Municipal Airport (ZPH)
* Pilot Country Airport (X05)
* Tampa North Aero Park (X39)
* Hidden Lake Estates Airport (FA40, private airport near Moon Lake)

===Bus service===
Pasco County Public Transportation provides bus service throughout Pasco County.

===Railroads===
CSX operates three rail lines within the county. Dade City and Zephyrhills are served with a line from Plant City. Amtrak formerly provided passenger rail service to Dade City on that line, but the stop was terminated in late 2004. The other two lines include the Brooksville Subdivision which runs close to US 41 and the Vitis Subdivision, which runs southeast into Lakeland.

Notable abandoned railroad lines include a former branch of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad northwest of Trilacoochee (formerly Owensboro Junction) that became part of the Withlacoochee State Trail, a segment of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad branch stretching from Zephyrhills to Trilacoochee, the former Tampa and Thonotosassa Railroad along the east side of US 301 that spanned from Sulphur Springs to Zephyrhills, part of the Orange Belt Railway which became the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad which ran from St. Petersburg and entered the county in what is today Trinity to Trilby (abandoned during the early to mid-1970s), and a branch of the Seaboard Air Line that ran through Holiday, Elfers and into New Port Richey.

The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad until 1957 ran the &quot;Southland&quot; through Trilby and Tarpon Springs, en route to St. Petersburg. The train was unusual for providing passenger service direct from Chicago (via the Pennsylvania), Cincinnati and Atlanta on a direct route through the western part of the Florida peninsula, bypassing Jacksonville. The Seaboard Coast Line (a merged line from the Atlantic Coast Line and the Seaboard Coast Line) until 1971 ran a local train (the last passenger train for the region north of St. Petersburg and west of Dade City) through those towns from Jacksonville and Gainesville, bound for St. Petersburg. Prior to the 1967 merger for the SCL that service had been the western branch of the ACL&#x27;s &quot;Champion&quot; from New York City. Until 1968 the SCL ran its &quot;Sunland&quot; from Washington, DC and Portsmouth, VA to Tampa.

The SAL Tarpon Springs branch line from Tarpon Junction 14 miles west of Tampa to Elfers and thence to Newport Richey to New Port Richey was lost its passenger service and became listed as freight only between 1932 and 1938. The freight branch was truncated to Elfers in 1943. The tracks from Elfers and Chemical (an industrial area in the extreme southwest part of the county along the Anclote River west of Holiday) to Tarpon Springs were removed in the late 1980s, leaving the western half of the county without freight rail service.

<text>Duncan James Watts (born February 20, 1971) is a computational social scientist and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. He was formerly a principal researcher at Microsoft Research in New York City, and is known for his work on small-world networks.

==Education==
Watts received a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from the University of New South Wales and a PhD in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from Cornell University, where his advisor was Steven Strogatz.

==Career==
Watts joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania in July 2019 as a PIK Professor. He has joint appointments in Engineering, Communications and Business.

Watts was past external faculty member of the Santa Fe Institute and a former professor of sociology at Columbia University, where he headed the Collective Dynamics Group. He is also author of two books. His first, &quot;Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age&quot; is based on the six degrees research in his 1998 paper with Steven Strogatz, in which the two presented a mathematical theory of the small world phenomenon. His second book, &quot;Everything is Obvious *Once You Know the Answer: How Common Sense Fails Us,&quot; explains common errors people make when making decisions especially for groups or organizations, and suggests alternative methods using research and data. He also presents some of his research from Yahoo and Microsoft, and comments on the work of some popular nonfiction writers like Malcolm Gladwell.

Until April 2012, he was a principal research scientist at Yahoo! Research, where he directed the Human Social Dynamics group. Watts joined Microsoft Research in New York City by its opening on May 3, 2012.

Watts describes his research as exploring the &quot;role that network structure plays in determining or constraining system behavior, focusing on a few broad problem areas in social science such as information contagion, financial risk management, and organizational design.&quot; More recently he has attracted attention for his modern-day replication of Stanley Milgram&#x27;s small world experiment using email messages and for his studies of popularity and fads in on-line and other communities.

In Watts&#x27;s early career, from 2002 to 2007, he was a frequent collaborator of Peter Sheridan Dodds, now at the University of Vermont&#x27;s Vermont Complex Systems Center.

<text>Six Degrees of Separation is a play written by American playwright John Guare that premiered in 1990. The play was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the Tony Award for Best Play.

The play explores the existential premise that everyone in the world is connected to everyone else in the world by a chain of no more than six acquaintances, thus, &quot;six degrees of separation&quot;.

It was adapted into a film of the same name in 1993.

==Synopsis==
A young black man named Paul shows up at the home of art dealer Flan Kittredge and his wife Louisa, known simply as &quot;Ouisa&quot;, who live overlooking Central Park in New York City. Paul has a minor stab wound from an attempted mugging, and says he&#x27;s a friend of their children at Harvard University. The Kittredges are trying to get the money to buy a painting by Paul Cézanne and now have this wounded stranger in their home. Paul claims he is in New York to meet his father, Sidney Poitier, who is directing a film version of the Broadway musical &quot;Cats.&quot; Paul continues to charm them with his story, though in reality, it is all a lie: Paul is no Harvard student and obtained details on the Kittredges from a male student he had seduced. Eventually Paul uses their home for an encounter with a hustler, but is caught red-handed. The police are called, but Paul escapes.

Soon after, Paul starts up another con against a sensitive young man named Rick and his live-in girlfriend, Elizabeth. The naive young couple are new to the big city having just moved to New York from Utah and, based on Paul&#x27;s con, invite him to live with them until he gets everything sorted out with his wealthy father—who Paul tells them is Flan Kittredge. The trio become good friends, with Paul spinning a tale of being estranged from his racist father; the girlfriend tells Rick not to lend Paul any money. One night Paul takes Rick out on the town, and seduces him in order to get the money. Later that night, Rick tells Elizabeth that Paul is gone, that he has all their money, and that he and Paul had sex. In a fit of fury, she cruelly suggests that Rick&#x27;s father had always questioned his son&#x27;s sexuality. Soon afterwards Rick commits suicide.

In desperation, Paul calls the Kittredges for assistance. Partly due to strained relations with her children, Ouisa finds herself feeling emotionally attached to Paul, hoping to be able to help him in some way despite the fact that he has victimized them. Over a protracted and laborious phone call, he agrees to give himself up to the police; however, during the arrest, he and the couple are separated. Despite their efforts—Ouisa&#x27;s more than Flan&#x27;s—his fate is unresolved, except for a possibly tragic end. Towards the end of the play, in a climactic moment of reflection, she delivers the play&#x27;s most famous monologue:

==Historical casting==
Kristin Griffith and Swoosie Kurtz read the role of Ouisa Kittredge in workshops in 1989 before Stockard Channing was cast. Channing was originally unavailable and was committed to coming to Broadway in another play, Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Jake&#x27;s Women&quot;. The play&#x27;s Broadway run was canceled. Channing had starred previously in John Guare&#x27;s &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot;, and he offered her the role for the official Off-Broadway run. Kurtz later replaced Channing during the Broadway run.

==Production history==
The play premiered Off-Broadway at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, on May 16, 1990. Stockard Channing won an Obie Award for Best Actress for her performance. Guare won an Obie Award for his script. The cast included 

The production was transferred to the Vivian Beaumont Theater for its Broadway debut on November 8, 1990. The production closed on January 5, 1992 after 485 performances, directed by Jerry Zaks. John Cameron Mitchell originated the role of Trent, which was his non-replacement debut on Broadway. Kelly Bishop played the role of Ouisa as a replacement on Broadway, and Laura Linney made her Broadway debut as a replacement for the role of Tess. The original Broadway production was nominated for four Tony Awards, winning for Best Direction for Zaks. A US. National tour was launched in 1992. Veronica Hamel also played Ouisa in the first production in Chicago.

The play made its UK debut in 1992 at the Royal Court Theatre and then transferred to the West End&#x27;s Comedy Theatre. In 2010, the play was revived at the Old Vic theatre in London starring Lesley Manville as Ouisa.

A 1995 production at Canadian Stage in Toronto, Ontario starred Fiona Reid as Ouisa, Jim Mezon as Flan and Nigel Shawn Williams as Paul. Both Williams and Reid won Dora Mavor Moore Awards for their performances, Williams as Outstanding Performance by a Male in a Principal Role – Play and Reid as Outstanding Performance by a Female in a Principal Role – Play.

In May 2004 Michael Buffong directed a production at the Royal Exchange, Manchester with Lisa Eichhorn as Ouissa Kittredge, Phillip Bretherton as Flanders Kittredge and O-T Fagbenle as Paul. O-T Fabenle won a MEN Award for his performance.

The play was revived on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in a limited engagement opening on April 5, 2017, starring Allison Janney, John Benjamin Hickey and Corey Hawkins, with direction by Trip Cullman.

==Background==
The play was inspired by the real-life story of David Hampton, a con man and robber who managed to convince a number of people in the 1980s that he was the son of actor Sidney Poitier. The writer John Guare was a friend of Inger McCabe Elliott and her husband Osborn Elliott. In October 1983 Hampton came to the Elliotts&#x27; New York apartment and they allowed him to spend the night. The next morning Inger Elliott found Hampton in bed with another man and later called the police. The Elliotts told Guare about the story and it inspired him to write the play years later.

Hampton was tried and acquitted for harassment of Guare after the play became a critical and financial success; he felt that, as the real life protagonist of the story, he was due a share of the profits that he ultimately never received.

A strong influence on the play is the novel &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; by J. D. Salinger. There are some very overt references to it, as when the protagonist explains the thesis paper he has just written on &quot;The Catcher in The Rye&quot; to the family who takes him in for the night. There are also more subtle allusions made both in the script and in the cinematography of the film version, such as when various characters begin to take on Holden Caulfield-esque characteristics and attitudes.

==Film adaptation==

Guare adapted the play for a film released in 1993 directed by Fred Schepisi. Channing was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film.

<text>Ariane is a series of European civilian expendable launch vehicles for space launch use. The name comes from the French spelling of the mythological character Ariadne. France first proposed the Ariane project and it was officially agreed upon at the end of 1973 after discussions between France, Germany and the UK. The project was Western Europe&#x27;s second attempt at developing its own launcher following the unsuccessful Europa project. The Ariane project was code-named L3S (the French abbreviation for third-generation substitution launcher).

The European Space Agency (ESA) charged Aérospatiale (whose former assets now form Airbus) with the development of all Ariane launchers and of the testing facilities, while Arianespace handled production, operations and marketing after its creation in 1980. Arianespace launches Ariane rockets from the Guiana Space Centre at Kourou in French Guiana. As a result of the merger in 2000 that founded Airbus, the new corporation&#x27;s space branch and subsequently its subsidiary with Safran, ArianeGroup, took over the duties of the defunct Aérospatiale.

== Ariane versions ==

Ariane 1 was a three-stage launcher, derived from missile technology. The first two stages used hypergolic propellants and the third stage used cryogenic liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen (LH2/LOX). Ariane 2–4 were enhancements of the basic vehicle. The major differences are improved versions of the engines, allowing stretched first- and third-stage tanks and greater payloads. The largest versions can launch two satellites, mounted in the SPELDA (Structure Porteuse Externe pour Lancements Doubles Ariane) adapter.

Such later versions are often seen with strap-on boosters. These layouts are designated by suffixes after the generation number. First is the total number of boosters, then letters designating liquid- or solid-fuelled stages. For example, an Ariane 42P is an Ariane 4 with two solid-fuel boosters. An Ariane 44LP has two solid, two liquid boosters, and a 44L has four liquid-fuel boosters.

Ariane 5 is a nearly complete redesign. The two hypergolic lower stages are replaced with a single LH2/LOX core stage. This simplifies the stack, along with the use of a single core engine (Vulcain). Because the core cannot lift its own weight, two solid-fuel boosters are strapped to the sides. The boosters can be recovered for examination, but are not reused. There are two versions of the upper stage, one hypergolic and restartable with a single Aestus engine and the other with a HM7B cryogenic engine burning LH2/LOX.

On 4 May 2007, an Ariane 5-ECA rocket set a new commercial payload record, lifting two satellites with a combined mass of 9.4 tonnes.

By January 2006, 169 Ariane flights had boosted 290 satellites, successfully placing 271 of them on orbit (223 main passengers and 48 auxiliary passengers) for a total mass of 575,000 kg successfully delivered on orbit. Attesting to the ubiquity of Ariane launch vehicles, France&#x27;s Cerise satellite, which was orbited by an Ariane 4 in 1995, struck a discarded Ariane rocket stage in 1996. The incident marked the first verified case of a collision with a piece of catalogued space debris.

On February 16, 2011, the 200th Ariane rocket was launched, successfully carrying the Johannes Kepler ATV into low Earth orbit and providing International Space Station with supplies.

On November 26, 2019, flight number 250 was performed, lifting two communications satellites: TIBA-1 and Inmarsat-5 F5 (GX5).

On December 25, 2021, Ariane flight VA256 lifted NASA&#x27;s James Webb Space Telescope towards Earth/Sun Lagrange point L2.

Ariane 5 flew its final mission on 5 July 2023.

<text>Rejs, known in English as The Cruise (or &quot;The Trip Down the River&quot;), is a Polish comedy film released in 1970, directed by Marek Piwowski who also co-wrote the screenplay with Andrzej Barszczyński, Janusz Głowacki and Jerzy Karaszkiewicz. The score was composed by Wojciech Kilar.

&quot;Rejs&quot; is considered as a masterpiece by many and as the earliest cult film in Polish cinema. Shot in a quasi-documentary style, with a cast featuring not more than two or three professional actors, the absurd plot parodies life in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, reducing a weekend river cruise to a hilarious parody of the entire communist system.

==Plot==
A stowaway (Stanisław Tym) sneaks aboard a ship departing on a cruise down the Vistula River. The captain takes him for a Communist Party cultural coordinator and the intruder gladly adapts to his new role, immediately setting to work at manipulating the passengers and crew into silly and vaguely humiliating games. Before long, Tym has got everyone under his thumb and created his own comedic dictatorship. A memorable performance was given by Jan Himilsbach, an amateur actor who formerly carved tombstones.

== Production ==
The film was directed in such a way that the characters&#x27; behaviors and expressions sound natural and the film resembles a documentary shot with a hidden camera. The characters were played by many non-actors or theater actors who had not acted in films before, and some scenes were improvised. Because of the low budget, the film was shot on black-and-white film stock with a single camera. The only lens we had for close-ups malfunctioned, so zooming was done by having the characters move closer to the camera. The non-professional actors didn&#x27;t know how to move, so the cameraman drew them to the camera by pulling on a string tied to their leg. The film crew called this technique &quot;Turkish zoom&quot;.

<text>An astrolabe ( , ; ; ) is an astronomical instrument dating to ancient times. It serves as a star chart and physical model of visible half-dome of the sky. Its various functions also make it an elaborate inclinometer and an analog calculation device capable of working out several kinds of problems in astronomy. In its simplest form it is a metal disc with a pattern of wires, cutouts, and perforations that allows a user to calculate astronomical positions precisely. It is able to measure the altitude above the horizon of a celestial body, day or night; it can be used to identify stars or planets, to determine local latitude given local time (and vice versa), to survey, or to triangulate. It was used in classical antiquity, the Islamic Golden Age, the European Middle Ages and the Age of Discovery for all these purposes.

The astrolabe, which is a precursor to the sextant,
is effective for determining latitude on land or calm seas. Although it is less reliable on the heaving deck of a ship in rough seas, the mariner&#x27;s astrolabe was developed to solve that problem.

== Applications ==
The 10th century astronomer ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Ṣūfī wrote a massive text of 386 chapters on the astrolabe, which reportedly described more than 1,000 applications for the astrolabe&#x27;s various functions.
These ranged from the astrological, the astronomical and the religious, to navigation, seasonal and daily time-keeping, and tide tables. At the time of their use, astrology was widely considered as much of a serious science as astronomy, and study of the two went hand-in-hand. The astronomical interest varied between folk astronomy (of the pre-Islamic tradition in Arabia) which was concerned with celestial and seasonal observations, and mathematical astronomy, which would inform intellectual practices and precise calculations based on astronomical observations. In regard to the astrolabe&#x27;s religious function, the demands of Islamic prayer times were to be astronomically determined to ensure precise daily timings, and the qibla, the direction of Mecca towards which Muslims must pray, could also be determined by this device. In addition to this, the lunar calendar that was informed by the calculations of the astrolabe was of great significance to the religion of Islam, given that it determines the dates of important religious observances such as Ramadan.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives the translation &quot;star-taker&quot; for the English word &quot;astrolabe&quot; and traces it through medieval Latin to the Greek word : ,
from : &quot;star&quot;, and : &quot;to take&quot;.

In the medieval Islamic world the Arabic word (i.e., astrolabe) was given various etymologies. In Arabic texts, the word is translated as (, ) – a direct translation of the Greek word.

Al-Biruni quotes and criticises medieval scientist Hamza al-Isfahani, who stated:
: &quot;&quot;asturlab&quot; is an Arabisation of this Persian phrase&quot; (, meaning &quot;taker of the stars&quot;).

In medieval Islamic sources, there is also a folk etymology of the word as &quot;lines of lab&quot;, where &quot;Lab&quot; refers to a certain son of Idris (Enoch). This etymology is mentioned by a 10th century scientist named al-Qummi but rejected by al-Khwarizmi.

==History==
===Ancient era===
An astrolabe is essentially a plane (two-dimensional) version of an armillary sphere, which had already been invented in the Hellenistic period and probably been used by Hipparchus to produce his star catalogue. Theon of Alexandria () wrote a detailed treatise on the astrolabe. The invention of the plane astrolabe is sometimes wrongly attributed to Theon&#x27;s daughter Hypatia (born ; died 
but it&#x27;s known to have been used much earlier.
The misattribution comes from a misinterpretation of a statement in a letter written by Hypatia&#x27;s pupil Synesius (),
which mentions that Hypatia had taught him how to construct a plane astrolabe, but does not say that she invented it.
Lewis argues that Ptolemy used an astrolabe to make the astronomical observations recorded in the &quot;Tetrabiblos&quot;. However, Emilie Savage-Smith notes
:&quot;there is no convincing evidence that Ptolemy or any of his predecessors knew about the planispheric astrolabe&quot;.

In chapter 5.1 of the &quot;Almagest&quot;, Ptolemy describes the construction of an armillary sphere, and it is usually assumed that this was the instrument he used.

Astrolabes continued to be used in the Byzantine Empire. Christian philosopher John Philoponus wrote a treatise () on the astrolabe in Greek, which is the earliest extant treatise on the instrument.
Mesopotamian bishop Severus Sebokht also wrote a treatise on the astrolabe in the Syriac language during the mid-7th century.
Sebokht refers to the astrolabe as being made of brass in the introduction of his treatise, indicating that metal astrolabes were known in the Christian East well before they were developed in the Islamic world or in the Latin West.

===Medieval era===
Astrolabes were further developed in the medieval Islamic world, where Muslim astronomers introduced angular scales to the design, adding circles indicating azimuths on the horizon. It was widely used throughout the Muslim world, chiefly as an aid to navigation and as a way of finding the Qibla, the direction of Mecca. Eighth-century mathematician Muhammad al-Fazari is the first person credited with building the astrolabe in the Islamic world.

The mathematical background was established by Muslim astronomer Albatenius in his treatise &quot;Kitab az-Zij&quot; which was translated into Latin by Plato Tiburtinus (&quot;De Motu Stellarum&quot;). The earliest surviving astrolabe is dated AH 315 In the Islamic world, astrolabes were used to find the times of sunrise and the rising of fixed stars, to help schedule morning prayers (salat). In the 10th century, al-Sufi first described over 1,000 different uses of an astrolabe, in areas as diverse as astronomy, astrology, navigation, surveying, timekeeping, prayer, Salat, Qibla, etc.
The spherical astrolabe was a variation of both the astrolabe and the armillary sphere, invented during the Middle Ages by astronomers and inventors in the Islamic world.
The earliest description of the spherical astrolabe dates to Al-Nayrizi (fl. 892–902). In the 12th century, Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī invented the &quot;linear astrolabe&quot;, sometimes called the &quot;staff of al-Tusi&quot;, which was
: &quot;a simple wooden rod with graduated markings, but without sights. It was furnished with a plumb line and a double chord for making angular measurements and bore a perforated pointer&quot;. The geared mechanical astrolabe was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan in 1235.

The first known metal astrolabe in Western Europe is the Destombes astrolabe made from brass in the eleventh century in Portugal. Metal astrolabes avoided the warping that large wooden ones were prone to, allowing the construction of larger and therefore more accurate instruments. Metal astrolabes were heavier than wooden instruments of the same size, making it difficult to use them in navigation.

Herman Contractus of Reichenau Abbey, examined the use of the astrolabe in &quot;Mensura Astrolai&quot; during the 11th century.
Peter of Maricourt wrote a treatise on the construction and use of a universal astrolabe in the last half of the 13th century entitled &quot;Nova compositio astrolabii particularis&quot;. Universal astrolabes can be found at the History of Science Museum, Oxford. David A. King, historian of Islamic instrumentation, describes the universal astrolobe designed by Ibn al-Sarraj of Aleppo (a.k.a. Ahmad bin Abi Bakr; fl. 1328) as &quot;the most sophisticated astronomical instrument from the entire Medieval and Renaissance periods&quot;.

English author Geoffrey Chaucer () compiled &quot;A Treatise on the Astrolabe&quot; for his son, mainly based on a work by Messahalla or Ibn al-Saffar.
The same source was translated by French astronomer and astrologer Pélerin de Prusse and others. The first printed book on the astrolabe was &quot;Composition and Use of Astrolabe&quot; by Christian of Prachatice, also using Messahalla, but relatively original.
In 1370, the first Indian treatise on the astrolabe was written by the Jain astronomer Mahendra Suri, titled &quot;Yantrarāja&quot;.

A simplified astrolabe, known as a &quot;balesilha&quot;, was used by sailors to get an accurate reading of latitude while at sea. The use of the &quot;balesilha&quot; was promoted by Prince Henry (1394–1460) while navigating for Portugal.

The astrolabe was almost certainly first brought north of the Pyrenees by Gerbert of Aurillac (future Pope Sylvester II), where it was integrated into the quadrivium at the school in Reims, France, sometime before the turn of the 11th century. In the 15th century, French instrument maker Jean Fusoris () also started remaking and selling astrolabes in his shop in Paris, along with portable sundials and other popular scientific devices of the day. Thirteen of his astrolabes survive to this day. One more special example of craftsmanship in early 15th-century Europe is the astrolabe designed by Antonius de Pacento and made by Dominicus de Lanzano, dated 1420.

In the 16th century, Johannes Stöffler published &quot;Elucidatio fabricae ususque astrolabii&quot;, a manual of the construction and use of the astrolabe. Four identical 16th century astrolabes made by Georg Hartmann provide some of the earliest evidence for batch production by division of labor.

Greek painter Ieremias Palladas incorporated a sophisticated astrolabe in his 1612 painting depicting Catherine of Alexandria. The painting, entitled &quot;Catherine of Alexandria&quot;; in addition to the saint, showed a device labelled the &#x27;system of the universe&#x27; (). The device featured the classical planets with their Greek names: Helios (Sun), Selene (Moon), Hermes (Mercury), Aphrodite (Venus), Ares (Mars), Zeus (Jupiter), and Cronos (Saturn). The depicted device also had celestial spheres, following the Ptolemaic model, and Earth was shown as a blue sphere with circles of geographic coordinates. A complicated line representing the axis of the Earth covered the entire instrument.

===Astrolabes and clocks===
Mechanical astronomical clocks were initially influenced by the astrolabe; they could be seen in many ways as clockwork astrolabes designed to produce a continual display of the current position of the sun, stars, and planets. For example, Richard of Wallingford&#x27;s clock () consisted essentially of a star map rotating behind a fixed rete, similar to that of an astrolabe.

Many astronomical clocks use an astrolabe-style display, such as the famous clock at Prague, adopting a stereographic projection (see below) of the ecliptic plane. In recent times, astrolabe watches have become popular. For example, Swiss watchmaker Ludwig Oechslin designed and built an astrolabe wristwatch in conjunction with Ulysse Nardin in 1985. Dutch watchmaker Christaan van der Klauuw also manufactures astrolabe watches today.

==Construction==
An astrolabe consists of a disk with a wide, raised rim, called the &quot;mater&quot; (mother), which is deep enough to hold one or more flat plates called &quot;tympans&quot;, or &quot;climates&quot;. A tympan is made for a specific latitude and is engraved with a stereographic projection of circles denoting azimuth and altitude and representing the portion of the celestial sphere above the local horizon. The rim of the mater is typically graduated into hours of time, degrees of arc, or both.

Above the mater and tympan, the &quot;rete&quot;, a framework bearing a projection of the ecliptic plane and several pointers indicating the positions of the brightest stars, is free to rotate. These pointers are often just simple points, but depending on the skill of the craftsman can be very elaborate and artistic. There are examples of astrolabes with artistic pointers in the shape of balls, stars, snakes, hands, dogs&#x27; heads, and leaves, among others. The names of the indicated stars were often engraved on the pointers in Arabic or Latin. Some astrolabes have a narrow &quot;rule&quot; or &quot;label&quot; which rotates over the rete, and may be marked with a scale of declinations.

The rete, representing the sky, functions as a star chart. When it is rotated, the stars and the ecliptic move over the projection of the coordinates on the tympan. One complete rotation corresponds to the passage of a day. The astrolabe is, therefore, a predecessor of the modern planisphere.

On the back of the mater, there is often engraved a number of scales that are useful in the astrolabe&#x27;s various applications. These vary from designer to designer, but might include curves for time conversions, a calendar for converting the day of the month to the sun&#x27;s position on the ecliptic, trigonometric scales, and graduation of 360 degrees around the back edge. The &quot;alidade&quot; is attached to the back face. An alidade can be seen in the lower right illustration of the Persian astrolabe above. When the astrolabe is held vertically, the alidade can be rotated and the sun or a star sighted along its length, so that its altitude in degrees can be read (&quot;taken&quot;) from the graduated edge of the astrolabe; hence the word&#x27;s Greek roots: &quot;astron&quot; (ἄστρον) = star + &quot;lab-&quot; (λαβ-) = to take. The alidade had vertical and horizontal cross-hairs which plots locations on an azimuthal ring called an almucantar (altitude-distance circle).

An arm called a radius connects from the center of the astrolabe to the optical axis which is parallel with another arm also called a radius. The other radius contains graduations of altitude and distance measurements.

A shadow square also appears on the back of some astrolabes, developed by Muslim astrologists in the 9th Century, whereas devices of the Ancient Greek tradition featured only altitude scales on the back of the devices. This was used to convert shadow lengths and the altitude of the sun, the uses of which were various from surveying to measuring inaccessible heights.

Devices were usually signed by their maker with an inscription appearing on the back of the astrolabe, and if there was a patron of the object, their name would appear inscribed on the front, or in some cases, the name of the reigning sultan or the teacher of the astrolabist has also been found to appear inscribed in this place. The date of the astrolabe&#x27;s construction was often also signed, which has allowed historians to determine that these devices are the second oldest scientific instrument in the world. The inscriptions on astrolabes also allowed historians to conclude that astronomers tended to make their own astrolabes, but that many were also made to order and kept in stock to sell, suggesting there was some contemporary market for the devices.

== Mathematical basis ==
The construction and design of astrolabes are based on the application of the stereographic projection of the celestial sphere. The point from which the projection is usually made is the South Pole. The plane onto which the projection is made is that of the Equator.

=== Designing a tympanum through stereographic projection ===
The tympanum captures the celestial coordinate axes upon which the &quot;rete&quot; will rotate. It is the component that will enable the precise determination of a star&#x27;s position at a specific time of day and year.

Therefore, it should project:

# The zenith, which will vary depending on the latitude of the astrolabe user.
# The horizon line and almucantar or circles parallel to the horizon, which will allow for the determination of a celestial body&#x27;s altitude (from the horizon to the zenith).
# The celestial meridian (north-south meridian, passing through the zenith) and secondary meridians (circles intersecting the north-south meridian at the zenith), which will enable the measurement of azimuth for a celestial body.
# The three main circles of latitude (Capricorn, Equator, and Cancer) to determine the exact moments of solstices and equinoxes throughout the year.

==== The tropics and the equator define the tympanum ====

On the right side of the image above:

# The blue sphere represents the celestial sphere.
# The blue arrow indicates the direction of true north (the North Star).
# The central blue point represents Earth (the observer&#x27;s location).
# The geographic south of the celestial sphere acts as the projection pole.
# The celestial equatorial plane serves as the projection plane.
# Three parallel circles represent the projection on the celestial sphere of Earth&#x27;s main circles of latitude: 
#* In orange, the celestial Tropic of Cancer. 
#* In purple, the celestial equator.
#* In green, the celestial Tropic of Capricorn.

When projecting onto the celestial equatorial plane, three concentric circles correspond to the celestial sphere&#x27;s three circles of latitude (left side of the image). The largest of these, the projection on the celestial equatorial plane of the celestial Tropic of Capricorn, defines the size of the astrolabe&#x27;s tympanum. The center of the tympanum (and the center of the three circles) is actually the north-south axis around which Earth rotates, and therefore, the &quot;rete&quot; of the astrolabe will rotate around this point as the hours of the day pass (due to Earth&#x27;s rotational motion).

The three concentric circles on the tympanum are useful for determining the exact moments of solstices and equinoxes throughout the year: if the sun&#x27;s altitude at noon on the &quot;rete&quot; is known and coincides with the outer circle of the tympanum (Tropic of Capricorn), it signifies the winter solstice (the sun will be at the zenith for an observer at the Tropic of Capricorn, meaning summer in the southern hemisphere and winter in the northern hemisphere). If, on the other hand, its altitude coincides with the inner circle (Tropic of Cancer), it indicates the summer solstice. If its altitude is on the middle circle (equator), it corresponds to one of the two equinoxes.

==== The horizon and the measurement of altitude ====

On the right side of the image above:

# The blue arrow indicates the direction of true north (the North Star).
# The central blue point represents Earth (the observer&#x27;s location).
# The black arrow represents the zenith direction for the observer (which would vary depending on the observer&#x27;s latitude).
# The two black circles represent the horizon surrounding the observer, which is perpendicular to the zenith vector and defines the portion of the celestial sphere visible to the observer, and its projection on the celestial equatorial plane. 
# The geographic south of the celestial sphere acts as the projection pole.
# The celestial equatorial plane serves as the projection plane.

When projecting the horizon onto the celestial equatorial plane, it transforms into an ellipse upward-shifted relatively to the center of the tympanum (both the observer and the projection of the north-south axis). This implies that a portion of the celestial sphere will fall outside the outer circle of the tympanum (the projection of the celestial Tropic of Capricorn) and, therefore, won&#x27;t be represented.

Additionally, when drawing circles parallel to the horizon up to the zenith (almucantar), and projecting them on the celestial equatorial plane, as in the image above, a grid of consecutive ellipses is constructed, allowing for the determination of a star&#x27;s altitude when its &quot;rete&quot; overlaps with the designed tympanum.

==== The meridians and the measurement of azimuth ====
On the right side of the image above:

# The blue arrow indicates the direction of true north (the North Star).
# The central blue point represents Earth (the observer&#x27;s location).
# The black arrow represents the zenith direction for the observer (which would vary depending on the observer&#x27;s latitude).
# The two black circles represent the horizon surrounding the observer, which is perpendicular to the zenith vector and defines the portion of the celestial sphere visible to the observer, and its projection on the celestial equatorial plane.
# The five red dots represent the zenith, the nadir (the point on the celestial sphere opposite the zenith with respect to the observer), their projections on the celestial equatorial plane, and the center (with no physical meaning attached) of the circle obtained by projecting the secondary meridian (see below) on the celestial equatorial plane.
# The orange circle represents the celestial meridian (or meridian that goes, for the observer, from the north of the horizon to the south of the horizon passing through the zenith).
# The two red circles represent a secondary meridian with an azimuth of 40° East relative to the observer&#x27;s horizon (which, like all secondary meridians, intersects the principal meridian at the zenith and nadir), and its projection on the celestial equatorial plane.
# The geographic south of the celestial sphere acts as the projection pole.
# The celestial equatorial plane serves as the projection plane.

When projecting the celestial meridian, it results in a straight line that overlaps with the vertical axis of the tympanum, where the zenith and nadir are located. However, when projecting the 40° E meridian, another circle is obtained that passes through both the zenith and nadir projections, so its center is located on the perpendicular bisection of the segment connecting both points. In deed, the projection of the celestial meridian can be considered as a circle with an infinite radius (a straight line) whose center is on this bisection and at an infinite distance from these two points.

If successive meridians that divide the celestial sphere into equal sectors (like &quot;orange slices&quot; radiating from the zenith) are projected, a family of curves passing through the zenith projection on the tympanum is obtained. These curves, once overlaid with the &quot;rete&quot; containing the major stars, allow for determining the azimuth of a star located on the &quot;rete&quot; and rotated for a specific time of day.

<text>The All-America Football Conference (AAFC) was a major professional American football league that challenged the established National Football League (NFL) from 1946 to 1949. One of the NFL&#x27;s most formidable challengers, the AAFC attracted many of the nation&#x27;s best players, and introduced many lasting innovations to the game. However, the AAFC was ultimately unable to sustain itself in competition with the NFL. After it folded, three of its teams were admitted to the NFL: the San Francisco 49ers, the Cleveland Browns and the original Baltimore Colts (not to be confused with the later Baltimore Colts team, now the Indianapolis Colts).

The AAFC was the second American professional football league (the first being the third American Football League of 1940–1941) to have its teams play in a double round robin format in the regular season: each team had a home game and an away game with each of the other AAFC teams.

The Cleveland Browns were the AAFC&#x27;s most successful club, winning every annual championship in the league&#x27;s four years of operation.

==Founding==
The AAFC was founded by &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; sports editor Arch Ward on June 4, 1944. Ward was also the originator of baseball&#x27;s All-Star Game and football&#x27;s College All-Star Game. Ward brought together a number of wealthy pro football enthusiasts, some of whom had previously attempted to purchase NFL franchises. Ward had previously encouraged the NFL to expand, but now he hoped to bring about a permanent second league and a championship game with the NFL, similar to baseball&#x27;s World Series.

The idea was not originated in vacuum, as two additional upstart leagues were trying to challenge the NFL in 1944:
* United States Football League - the (first) USFL, with Red Grange as the league commissioner, announced teams in eight cities: Akron, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Honolulu, New York, Philadelphia and Washington. The league faded away after failing to attract major investors or sign players, as Grange claimed they were &quot;holding out for between $400 and $600 a game when they used to get $150&quot;. The league folded altogether on June 4, 1945, after Grange&#x27;s resignation.
* Trans-America Football League - the TAFL had plans for franchises in Baltimore, Boston, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and Philadelphia (Atlanta and New Orleans were also in the mix, but ruled out early), with a unique ownership model as only a group of five or more people could own a franchise (not a single owner). On January 5, 1945, they announced a six team league in Baltimore, Brooklyn, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia, which had leased stadiums. The league folded on the same day as the USFL (June 4, 1945), after failing to secure a lease to Yankee Stadium.

On November 21, 1944, the AAFC chose James &quot;Sleepy Jim&quot; Crowley, one of the &quot;Four Horsemen of Notre Dame&quot;, as its commissioner. Not coincidentally, the NFL commissioner at this time was Elmer Layden, another member of Knute Rockne&#x27;s legendary 1924 &quot;Fighting Irish&quot; backfield at the University of Notre Dame.

During the next months, the AAFC&#x27;s plans solidified. The league initially issued franchises for Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. Brooklyn and Miami were later added. A group representing Baltimore was considered for admission, but could not secure use of Baltimore&#x27;s stadium. The league planned to begin to play in 1945, but postponed its opening for a year as World War II continued.

As the eight franchises built their teams, no move was more far-reaching than Cleveland&#x27;s choice of Paul Brown as its head coach. Brown had won six Ohio state championships in nine years at Massillon High School and the 1942 national championship at Ohio State, and had also coached successfully at the military&#x27;s Naval Station Great Lakes. As coach of the new Cleveland franchise, Brown would become one of American football&#x27;s greatest innovators and eventually have the team named for him.

==NFL reaction==

As might be expected, the NFL did not welcome its new rival. In 1945, Layden remarked that the AAFC, still a year from its first game, should &quot;first get a ball, then make a schedule, and then play a game&quot;. This insult, often paraphrased as &quot;tell them to get a ball first&quot;, would be long remembered.

Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall was perhaps the NFL&#x27;s hardest-liner regarding the AAFC. In 1945, he commented: &quot;I did not realize there was another league, although I did receive some literature telling about a WPA project&quot;. Later he declared, &quot;the worst team in our league could beat the best team in theirs&quot;. After the AAFC put a team in Baltimore, Marshall&#x27;s opposition to it would be a major obstacle to interleague peace. Not coincidentally, his team was badly hurt by the AAFC. A top team from 1936 to 1945, the Redskins began a decades-long title drought after coach Ray Flaherty and many key players defected in 1946.

Layden&#x27;s successor, Bert Bell, pursued a policy of official non-recognition, generally answering &quot;no comment&quot; to queries about the other league. In 1947, &quot;Pro Football Illustrated&quot; previewed both leagues in its annual publication and was banned from NFL stadiums.

==Competition==
The AAFC posed a formidable challenge. In most interleague sports wars, the established league had major advantages over the challenger in prestige, finance, size, and public awareness. The NFL-AAFC war differed in several respects.

The NFL was just emerging from its wartime retrenchment. The Cleveland Rams had suspended operations for 1943, and on three occasions teams merged for a season. The Boston Yanks had played only one season as an independent entity.

Meanwhile, the AAFC had advantages not enjoyed by many challengers:
* The AAFC was founded by a key figure at a major newspaper, so it enjoyed ample attention in the press.
* The AAFC owners (dubbed &quot;the millionaires&#x27; coffee klatch&quot;) were wealthier than their NFL counterparts. Among them were Cleveland&#x27;s Arthur B &quot;Mickey&quot; McBride (a real estate and taxi magnate), San Francisco&#x27;s Anthony Morabito (lumber), Chicago&#x27;s John L. Keeshin (trucking), and Los Angeles’ group of racetrack owner Benjamin Lindheimer, actor Don Ameche and MGM&#x27;s Louis B. Mayer. The NFL owners were generally men whose primary assets were their teams.
* Peace produced a surplus of talent and an opening for a new league, as many pro and college players (some of whom had played on military teams) returned to civilian life. Many college-eligible players were signable despite longstanding tradition because their original classes had graduated. The AAFC took its share: its 1946 rosters included 40 of the 66 College All-Stars, two recent Heisman Trophy winners (Frank Sinkwich and Angelo Bertelli), and more than 100 players with NFL experience.
* Air travel was now viable. Like Major League Baseball, all NFL teams still played in the Northeast and Midwest, but the AAFC seized the opportunity to place teams in open cities in Florida and California.

Yet it remained to be seen if there was a market for this much pro football. Since achieving stability in the early 1930s, the NFL had never fielded more than 10 teams. No competitor had endured for more than two years. In 1946, there would be 18 teams, including three in Chicago, three in New York, and two in Los Angeles.

Baseball and college football were substantially more popular. Longtime NFL president Joe Carr had said, &quot;No owner has made money from pro football, but a lot have gone broke thinking they could.&quot; At a time when the World Series had long been a national institution, and the Rose Bowl drew crowds of 90,000, the NFL&#x27;s title game typically drew about 35,000 fans. Across the U.S., a growing number of college stadiums designed or retrofitted for football were being built and expanded across the U.S. Most pro football teams in contrast shared stadiums (and sometimes names) with the local baseball team, and as such had to make do in facilities designed for another sport with mediocre sight lines for football. Both leagues saw fit to choose college football legends as their commissioners.

There was even a sense that collegians could defeat pros. 1946 saw the famous Army–Notre Dame scoreless tie in Yankee Stadium. At season&#x27;s end, Arch Ward (the AAFC founder) opined that both teams were superior to either pro champion.

It was in this landscape that the AAFC prepared to compete with the NFL.

===Maneuvers and intrigue===

Dan Topping, owner of the NFL&#x27;s Brooklyn Tigers, wished to move his team from Ebbets Field to the much larger Yankee Stadium. New York Giants owner Tim Mara used his territorial rights to block the move. He had good reason: the Yankees had displaced the Giants as New York&#x27;s premier baseball team after moving into The House That Ruth Built, three rival football leagues had planted teams there hoping to duplicate that feat, and Topping (of Anaconda Copper) was significantly wealthier than Mara.

Topping responded by buying into the baseball Yankees and transferring his club to the AAFC. 
Most of his players followed. His renamed New York Yankees were rewarded with $100,000 from each of the other seven AAFC teams while the AAFC&#x27;s initial New York investor withdrew. (Note that the AAFC Brooklyn Dodgers were a separate entity never associated with Topping&#x27;s team.)

Shortly after Topping defected, the NFL owners fired Commissioner Layden, replacing him with Pittsburgh Steelers co-owner Bert Bell. Bell had already made a major contribution to the league: the NFL draft, begun in 1935, was his idea.

Meanwhile, Dan Reeves&#x27; Cleveland Rams had consistently lost money, despite winning the 1945 NFL title. Compounding his problems, the local AAFC competition already looked strong: Arthur McBride was aggressively marketing the Browns, and coach Paul Brown was an Ohio icon. Accordingly, Reeves proposed to move the Rams to Los Angeles.

With two teams planned for California, the AAFC had national aspirations. The NFL&#x27;s thinking was more modest: it rejected Reeves&#x27; move because of travel expenses. After the NFL refused to consider his second choice (Dallas), Reeves threatened to move his team to the AAFC. Having already lost Topping, the NFL reconsidered and approved the Los Angeles move.

It was unprecedented for the NFL champion to move at all, let alone partly to avoid an unproven rival. On the other hand, the NFL would now face the AAFC as a national rather than regional league, and the AAFC would not have a West Coast monopoly.

Rather than hold a collegiate draft, Crowley encouraged his owners to sign as many good players as possible to compete with the NFL. However, this open market favored Paul Brown, who had built the most extensive recruitment network in all of football. He thus had a head start in signing top players coming out of the colleges and military. Years later, Crowley acknowledged this was a fatal mistake, as it planted the seeds for the Browns&#x27; near-total dominance of the league.

===Initial alignment===
For 1946, the AAFC began play with 8 teams playing a record 14 games (a double round-robin). The NFL&#x27;s 10 teams played 11 games, its standard since 1937.

Again acting ambitiously, the AAFC chose stadiums larger than the NFL&#x27;s in Chicago, New York, and Cleveland.

The two leagues’ franchises and home fields for 1946 were:

NFL

AAFC

===1946===
In the AAFC&#x27;s first game, on September 6, 1946, the Cleveland Browns hosted the Miami Seahawks, winning 44–0 before a professional football record crowd of more than 60,000 fans. This historic game would prove a microcosm of much about the league:
* Largely thanks to Paul Brown&#x27;s innovations in organization and coaching, the Browns were on their way to setting a new standard of pro football excellence.
* The other teams would have significant problems, but the Seahawks would become the AAFC&#x27;s biggest fiasco. Along with two of their home games being postponed by hurricanes, they attracted poor home crowds en route to finishing last with a 3–11 record. These factors resulted in the Seahawks losing $350,000 for the year, and the AAFC shutting down the franchise after the season.
* The crowd was the first of many large gates that the AAFC&#x27;s most popular teams (Cleveland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York) would attract, surpassing the NFL.
* The score, however, was the first sign of the AAFC&#x27;s greatest problem. The league would have a wide gap between its best and worst teams, and its standings would be remarkably consistent from year to year.
* Finally, this game marked the end of pro football&#x27;s color line. The Browns&#x27; Marion Motley and Bill Willis, both future Hall of Famers, became the first black players to play pro football since 1933 (the NFL Rams, who had also signed two black players, UCLA great Kenny Washington and future actor Woody Strode, opened several weeks later). Notably, this was &quot;before&quot; Jackie Robinson&#x27;s debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers, as Robinson was then playing for the Montreal Royals, the Dodgers&#x27; top farm team. In coming years, the AAFC would tap this talent pool more than the NFL, with 20 black players compared with the NFL&#x27;s seven in 1949.

Other than New York, all of the quality teams were in the Western Division. In the West, Cleveland led with a 12–2 record, three games ahead of San Francisco, followed by Los Angeles and Chicago. In the East, New York was the only team to win more than three games, finishing 10–3–1. Brooklyn and Buffalo were seven games behind, followed by Miami. Despite Brooklyn&#x27;s record, its tailback Glenn Dobbs led the league in passing and was named the MVP.

The title game was a tight affair, with the Browns coming from behind late in the fourth quarter to defeat the Yankees 14–9.

Despite the fiasco in Miami, the AAFC had enjoyed a successful debut, establishing a high level of play and doing well at the gate. The NFL likewise set attendance highs for both its season and title game. However, as salaries shot up with two leagues competing for players, the only teams to make a profit were the two champions, the Browns and the NFL Bears.

===1947===
The Chicago Rockets had experienced some disorganization in 1946. In a remarkable move, Commissioner Crowley (a successful former college coach) gave up a five-year contract to become their part-owner and coach. Admiral Jonas H. Ingram was named to replace him as commissioner.

To replace the Seahawks, the Baltimore group turned down in 1945 was issued a franchise. The new Baltimore Colts would play in Municipal Stadium. Meanwhile, the Bisons were renamed the Bills and the NFL added a 12th game to its schedule.

The AAFC enjoyed its most successful season in 1947. Some notable guests watched the Browns&#x27; opening game: the entire coaching staff of the 1946 NFL champion Chicago Bears. The 49ers obtained the rights to Army&#x27;s legendary 
Heisman Trophy winners Felix Blanchard (&quot;Mr. Inside&quot;) and Glenn Davis (&quot;Mr. Outside&quot;), and amid great publicity unsuccessfully attempted to get the military to permit them to play during their post-graduation furloughs. In other highlights, a Yankees–Dons game in the Los Angeles Coliseum drew a pro record of more than 82,000, and division leaders New York and Cleveland locked horns on November 23 in the most famous game in AAFC history. Before more than 70,000 fans at Yankee Stadium, the Browns rallied from a 28–0 deficit to tie 28–28.

New York won the East with an 11–2–1 record, 2½ games ahead of Buffalo, with Brooklyn and Baltimore far back. Cleveland, led by MVP quarterback Otto Graham, won the West with a 12–1–1 record, 3½ games ahead of San Francisco. Los Angeles followed, and Chicago was last at 1–13. Former Commissioner Crowley would not return either as coach or owner.

The title game was a defensive struggle, with the Browns again defeating the Yankees, 14–3.

By this time a pattern had emerged among the franchises. The Browns, Yankees, 49ers, Dons, and Bills all had stable ownership and at least one winning season. The Browns led both leagues in attendance by a wide margin, the Yankees and Dons outpaced their crosstown NFL rivals on the field and at the gate, and the 49ers and Bills (despite a small stadium) also enjoyed good attendance.

However, the Dodgers, Rockets, and to a lesser extent the Colts were having serious problems. Playing near the Yankees and the NFL Giants, the Dodgers drew fewer than 12,000 fans per game, least in both leagues. The Rockets faced the NFL&#x27;s flagship Bears and a Cardinals team enjoying rare success. After a decent start in 1946, the Rockets collapsed on the field and found themselves playing before tens of thousands of empty seats in huge Soldier Field. The first-year Colts did reasonably well at the gate but finished last. All of these teams were at the bottom of the standings and all were sold after the 1947 season, the Rockets for the second time.

===1948===
Although 1947 had been a successful season for the AAFC in many respects, the league still lost money. In 1948, attendance in both leagues declined, and negotiations to end the war became serious.

One factor affecting AAFC attendance was the gap between the league&#x27;s best and worst teams. To counter this, Commissioner Ingram attempted to get the strongest teams to distribute some players to the weakest. He was modestly successful: the Browns sent rookie quarterback Y. A. Tittle to the Colts, who enjoyed their first good season, and the Yankees were generous enough to fall into mediocrity. However, 1948 featured extremes despite Ingram&#x27;s efforts.

For the first time, the division races were close. One featured excellence, the other mediocrity.

The 1948 AAFC draft was held on December 16, 1947, in New York City. Tony Minisi was the first overall selection. In the West, San Francisco and Cleveland both remained undefeated far into the season. On November 14, nearly 83,000 (a record) in Cleveland Municipal Stadium watched the 9–0 Browns win a 14–7 defensive struggle over the 10–0 49ers. They met again two weeks later in San Francisco, with the Browns now 12–0 and the 49ers 11–1. The Browns again won narrowly, this time 31–28, clinching first place.

The rematch concluded an AAFC Thanksgiving week promotion: the Browns played three games in eight days. New Dodgers&#x27; part-owner Branch Rickey (of baseball fame) suggested this experiment, and the Browns were chosen as the guinea pigs. They survived unscathed, and went on to complete an unprecedented 14–0 regular season.

The 49ers finished a heartbreaking second (and out of the postseason) at 12–2. Los Angeles followed at 7–7, and Chicago again finished last at 1–13. The quarterbacks of the two outstanding teams, Cleveland&#x27;s Otto Graham and San Francisco&#x27;s Frankie Albert, shared the MVP.

In the East, Buffalo and Baltimore tied at a mediocre 7–7, just ahead of 6–8 New York. Brooklyn was last at 2–12. Buffalo won a playoff and the dubious privilege of meeting Cleveland for the title.

Cleveland won the title in a predictable rout, 49–7. With pro football&#x27;s second perfect season (after the 1937 Los Angeles Bulldogs of the second American Football League) and an 18-game winning streak and a 29-game unbeaten streak in progress, the Browns were making history. Since then, only the 1972 Miami Dolphins team managed to win its league championship with an unblemished record. The Pro Football Hall of Fame recognizes the Browns&#x27; latter streak as the longest in the history of professional football.

The NFL also had a problem with imbalance. With one exception, every title game from 1933 to 1946 featured either the Giants or Redskins from the East against either the Bears or Packers from the West. The lone exception was 1935, when the Detroit Lions played in the title game against the Giants.

But in the late 1940s new powers rose in the NFL, as the Cardinals, Eagles, and Rams all won titles, and the Steelers reached a playoff. All these teams had long histories of futility and had merged or suspended operations during the war. (In fact, the Cardinals were winless from mid-1942 to mid-1945, including a 0–10 merged season with the Steelers.)

Adding to the drama, the division races were often tight. Decades before Pete Rozelle, Bert Bell promoted parity by purposely matching strong teams early in the season, keeping them from getting far ahead in the standings. All this contrasted sharply with the AAFC.

The war was getting increasingly costly thanks to rising salaries and dropping attendance. Nearly every team in both leagues lost money – enough that in December, the NFL officially acknowledged the AAFC as peace talks almost succeeded in ending the war. However, the AAFC wanted four of its teams to be admitted into the NFL, while the NFL was willing to admit only the Browns and 49ers. Although the survival of its Brooklyn and Chicago teams was now in doubt, the AAFC decided to continue the fight.

===Realignment===
Commissioner Ingram stepped down, and another admiral, Oliver O. Kessing, was named Commissioner.

As the war entered its fourth season, financial problems forced reorganization in both leagues. The Dodgers, the AAFC&#x27;s least-drawing team, merged with the Yankees as the Rockets (renamed the Hornets) and Colts continued their streaks of annual ownership changes.

In the NFL, the champion Philadelphia Eagles lost money and were sold. Plagued by league-low attendance, the Boston Yanks moved to New York in a curious move. Yanks owner Ted Collins had long desired a franchise in Yankee Stadium (thus his team&#x27;s name), and expected the AAFC and its Yankees to be gone in 1949. Instead, with Yankee Stadium and the Yanks name unavailable, Collins&#x27; renamed Bulldogs had to share the Polo Grounds with the Giants on unfavorable terms and compete with two superior rivals.

With the AAFC now down to seven teams, it realigned into one division, reduced its schedule to 12 games (still a double round-robin), and changed its postseason to a Shaughnessy playoff. In 1948, the 12–2 49ers had stayed home while the 7–7 Bills played for the title. This would not reoccur, as now the top four teams would qualify for the playoffs. Also, for the first time in pro football, playoff home-field advantage would be based on win–loss record rather than rotating between divisions.

The lineup of the rival leagues was now:

NFL

AAFC
===1949===
Since 1934, the College All-Star Game had matched the defending NFL champions against an all-star team of recent college graduates. The game was a major event, as Rose Bowl-sized crowds (more than 105,000 in 1947) watched college football&#x27;s best often hold their own with the pros. Held in late August at Soldier Field, the game was sponsored by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;—whose sports editor, Ward, had founded the AAFC.

After the game&#x27;s contract with the NFL expired with the 1948 game, Ward refused to renew it. He attempted to help the AAFC by putting its champion into the prestigious game. However, the NFL was able to convince the &quot;Tribune&#x27;s&quot; board to override Ward and force him to re-sign with the NFL, handing the AAFC an embarrassing defeat.

Red ink on both sides continued to flow. The Colts and Hornets were only kept afloat when Dons owner Ben Lindheimer subsidized them. The Green Bay Packers, then as now owned by a local civic group, had to issue new stock to remain solvent. Now facing two cross-town rivals, the Bulldogs predictably had even lower attendance in New York than in Boston. The Pittsburgh Steelers and Detroit Lions were also having serious financial problems.

Remarkably, the AAFC actually enjoyed better attendance than the NFL over its four-year run. In an era when sports teams were wholly dependent on gate receipts to remain in business, and when revenues from sources such as media rights were negligible, this had the potential put the AAFC on essentially an equal financial footing. However, the NFL had a critical advantage in that its ownership was deeply committed to ensuring the survival of their teams. In contrast, it was becoming clear that the AAFC&#x27;s better-financed owners, who were accustomed to operating profitable businesses, as opposed to underwriting expenses year after year, were not willing to absorb losses indefinitely.

On the field, Cleveland finally showed some vulnerability. An opening day tie with the Bills ended their winning streak, and on October 9th the 49ers ended their unbeaten streak in a 56–28 upset to move into first place.

Things soon reverted to form, however. The Browns won the rematch with the 49ers 30–28; and Cleveland (9–1–2) and San Francisco (9–3) finished one-two for the fourth consecutive year. Brooklyn-New York and Buffalo were the other playoff qualifiers, followed by Chicago and Los Angeles. Baltimore finished far behind at 1–11.

In playoff action, Cleveland defeated Buffalo 31–21 and San Francisco defeated Brooklyn–New York 17–7. The two best teams in AAFC history met at last with the title at stake, with the Browns winning the final title 21–7. No MVP was named for this season.

The Browns now owned a 52–4–3 record and all four AAFC titles.

===Merger===
On December 9, 1949, two days before the AAFC title game, the two leagues made peace. Three AAFC teams were admitted to the NFL: the Browns, 49ers, and Colts. The Dons merged with the Rams, while the Bills, Yankees, and Hornets folded. The enlarged league was renamed the National–American Football League.

The Browns and 49ers, as the AAFC&#x27;s two strongest teams, were obvious choices. San Francisco was also a natural fit as a potential geographic rival to the Rams, who were alone on the West Coast at the time.

The third choice was the subject of some debate. There was some sentiment to admit the Bills rather than the Colts. The Bills had better attendance despite only making the playoffs twice, and had much wealthier ownership. However, Buffalo&#x27;s size (only Green Bay was smaller) and climate were seen as problems. While Redskins owner George Preston Marshall had long objected to the Colts&#x27; proximity to Washington, he ultimately decided that the Colts would be a natural rival to the Redskins. He agreed to accept a $150,000 fee to waive his territorial rights.

Buffalo fans petitioned the NFL to admit the Bills as well. The league, realizing the pitfalls of having an uneven 13-team league, held a vote on admitting the Bills. While a majority of owners (including the Browns, 49ers, and Colts) were willing to take the Bills, the final vote was only 9–4 in favor. League rules of the time required a unanimous vote to admit a new team. Buffalo owner Jim Breuil was content to accept a minority stake in the Browns. Breuil even rebuffed an offer from the next-best pro league in the nation at the time, the minor-league American Football League of the late 1940s, to join their league.

The Yankees&#x27; players were divided between the Giants (who chose six players) and Bulldogs (who received the rest). Three Bills players were awarded to the Browns. The remaining Bills, Dons, and Hornets entered a dispersal draft.

With the AAFC Yankees gone, Bulldogs owner Ted Collins was free to rename his team &quot;Yanks&quot; and move into Yankee Stadium. He continued to lose money, however, and sold the team after two seasons to Dallas-based interests, who relocated the team to Dallas and called the team the Dallas Texans.

The word &quot;American&quot; did not remain in the enlarged league&#x27;s name for long; it was dropped in March 1950. Although &quot;National&quot; and &quot;American&quot; became the names of the league&#x27;s new conferences, within three years the conferences were renamed Eastern and Western. It was not until the AFL–NFL merger twenty years later that the &quot;American&quot; and &quot;National&quot; conference names were restored.

The enlarged NFL was aligned as follows:
With two exceptions, this was the NFL&#x27;s alignment for the rest of the 1950s.

Admitting Baltimore over Buffalo proved to be a mistake, as the AAFC&#x27;s Colts folded after one season in the NFL, bringing the league back to an even 12 teams. However, the aforementioned Dallas Texans also folded after only one season, and a replacement team also named the Colts acquired its assets joined the league as an expansion team in 1953. Meanwhile, the popularity of the original Bills franchise prompted former Detroit Lions minority owner Ralph Wilson to adopt the name &quot;Buffalo Bills&quot; for his American Football League franchise ten years after the AAFC dissolved. Both the replacement Colts (now based in Indianapolis) and the replacement Bills are still playing in the NFL, though neither maintains official ties to their namesakes (coincidentally, the Colts and Bills were division rivals in the AFC East from 1970 through 2001, after which the Colts moved to the AFC South).
==Aftermath==

===&quot;The World Series of Pro Football&quot;===
After winning each of their titles, the Browns challenged the NFL champion to an interleague championship. Each year the NFL refused. (Of course, by playing such a game the NFL would legitimize the AAFC and risk more prestige.)

In December 1949, with both leagues financially exhausted but now at peace, a profitable interleague playoff was now both possible and desirable. Although Pittsburgh&#x27;s Art Rooney, whose Steelers were among the shakiest NFL franchises, publicly advocated such a game, most of the NFL was unwilling to risk defeat at the hands of their vanquished, supposedly inferior rival. Officially, however, commissioner Bert Bell maintained that the NFL constitution barred such a game. The football world would have to wait to see how the Browns matched up against the NFL&#x27;s best.

All would not be lost for fans, however. Bell appreciated that the Browns were now an important asset to the NFL, and scheduled a special Saturday night game between them and the NFL&#x27;s two-time champion Philadelphia Eagles to open the 1950 season. While not quite an unofficial interleague playoff, what took place on September 16, 1950, was no ordinary regular season game.

The defending champions of two leagues that had never met on the field were about to play, foreshadowing tensions present in the early Super Bowls of the 1960s. At last the Browns would have the chance to prove themselves, and by extension the AAFC, against the NFL. There was tremendous anticipation from fans and the press, which called the game &quot;The World Series of Pro Football&quot;. Although the game was played in Philadelphia, it was not played on the Eagles usual home field: because of the huge crowd expected, the game was moved from Shibe Park to Philadelphia Municipal Stadium, site of the Army–Navy Game. Attendance was a whopping 71,237, the third-largest pro football crowd to that date (next to two crowds for Rams games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum the year before), and the largest-ever on the east coast. (This figure also surpassed every previous NFL or AAFC title game, as well as Super Bowl I.) There was even a most valuable player award, unheard of for a regular-season game.

The Eagles were widely considered one of the NFL&#x27;s strongest-ever champions, while many discounted the Browns’ success in their &quot;inferior&quot; league. The result was therefore shocking: the Eagles underestimated the highly motivated Browns (coach Greasy Neale did not even scout the Browns’ preseason games), while Paul Brown found some previously unknown weaknesses in the widely imitated &quot;Eagle Defense&quot; that allowed the Browns to run up 487 yards of total offense. The Browns led 14–3 at halftime and dominated the rest of the game to win decisively, 35–10. Quarterback Otto Graham was named the game&#x27;s MVP.

===The Browns, 49ers, and Colts in the NFL===
The Browns went 10–2 to finish in a first-place tie with the New York Giants, then won a playoff 8–3 to qualify for the 1950 NFL championship game. Their opponent was a formidable Los Angeles Rams team that averaged nearly 39 points per game, a record that still stands. (Ironically, this was the Rams’ first game in Cleveland since winning the 1945 title as the Cleveland Rams.) In a classic seesaw game, the Browns prevailed on a last-minute field goal, 30–28, to win their fifth consecutive league title.

The Browns’ 1950 season confirmed the quality of their AAFC achievements as nothing else could. After the title game, Commissioner Bell called the Browns &quot;the greatest team to ever play football.&quot;

Cleveland remained near the top of the NFL for years, although in 1951 they were finally denied a league title (by the Rams). The Browns played in every NFL title game from 1950 to 1955, winning three of them, for a grand total of seven league titles in ten years.

The other ex-AAFC teams did not fare nearly as well.

The 49ers, the AAFC&#x27;s second-best team, struggled in 1950 and finished 3–9. However, starting the next year they emerged as one of the better teams in the NFL&#x27;s Western Conference, reaching the postseason in 1957 after some near-misses.

The Colts&#x27; prospects were not promising: they had finished 1–11 and last in the AAFC in 1949 and also faced the handicap of playing near the Washington Redskins. In 1950, the Colts went 1–11 again and disbanded. Their legacy lived on, however: three years later, a new Baltimore Colts franchise team was established after the Dallas Texans folded and the Colts became one of the NFL&#x27;s storied teams. Although the Colts would controversially move to Indianapolis, on March 29, 1984, the NFL would return to Baltimore for the 1996 NFL season in the form of the Baltimore Ravens. From an organizational perspective, the Ravens are a continuation of the pre-1996 Browns, who played in Cleveland until they controversially agreed to move to Baltimore for the 1996 NFL season. Officially, the NFL considers the &quot;expansion&quot; Browns (1999 on) to be one continuous franchise from the original 1946 AAFC team, with it having &quot;suspended operations from 1996 to 1998&quot;, while the Ravens are considered to have been established in 1996. While the pre-1984 history of the Colts officially remains with the Indianapolis franchise, the Ravens have also recognized it in a number of ways. 

&quot;See Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, Baltimore Colts (1947–50), and Indianapolis Colts for further details of these teams&#x27; subsequent histories.&quot;

===The AAFC and the NFL record book===
One notable difference between the All-America Football Conference and the American Football League (AFL), which merged with the NFL two decades later, is that the records and statistics of AAFC players and teams are not included in the NFL record book, while those of their AFL counterparts are. For example, Joe Namath&#x27;s pre-1970 statistics with the AFL New York Jets are considered official NFL statistics, while Y. A. Tittle&#x27;s pre-1950 statistics with the AAFC Baltimore Colts are not.

According to the NFL, this is because official scoresheets of AAFC games were not made available to the NFL after the merger. Without these, the NFL could not verify the authenticity of any AAFC statistics or records and so it chose to ignore them. However, in the case of the NFL–AFL merger, which was completed in 1970, the AFL gave all of its official scoresheets to the NFL making it possible for the NFL to accept the AFL&#x27;s statistics and records.

Another explanation is that unlike the NFL–AFL agreement, the NFL–AAFC agreement was not a merger between equals. Only three of the seven AAFC teams were admitted to the NFL. There was no interleague playoff in December 1949. &quot;American&quot; swiftly disappeared from the enlarged league&#x27;s name. The AFL, on the other hand, was able to force the NFL to admit all of its teams, to play an interleague championship game on a neutral field, and to maintain the &quot;American&quot; name in the form of the American Football Conference.

The Pro Football Hall of Fame does recognize AAFC statistics.

==Legacy==
Although the AAFC played only four years, it had a major, lasting impact on pro football. Of all the leagues that challenged the NFL, only the American Football League of the 1960s influenced the NFL more than the AAFC. The AAFC put the first pro football teams in Baltimore, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Miami. Indeed, the AAFC was a coast-to-coast league more than a decade before Major League Baseball. This brought about another innovation: AAFC teams traveled by air while NFL teams still traveled by train. The Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, and original Baltimore Colts began in the AAFC, while sixteen AAFC alumni are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

The AAFC played a 14-game schedule more than a decade before the NFL, and played a major role in popularizing zone defenses in pro football.

Black players were excluded from the NFL from 1934 to 1945. The AAFC helped reintegrate professional American football in 1946 when Cleveland signed Marion Motley and Bill Willis. The NFL Rams, having been driven out of Cleveland by the AAFC Browns, signed Kenny Washington and Woody Strode only after the venue they sought to play in, the Los Angeles Coliseum, enforced its policy of integration. Through its poaching of NFL official (and former player-coaching star) Tommy Hughitt, the AAFC took an explicitly anti-racist stance toward rough play, aggressively penalizing racist unsportsmanlike conduct. Motley credited this, along with the AAFC fans&#x27; embrace of black talent in the league, with helping to establish the legitimacy of integrated professional football.

The AAFC&#x27;s Paul Brown produced numerous innovations to the game on and off the field. Among them were year-round coaching staffs, precision pass patterns, the face mask, and the practice of coaches’ calling plays via &quot;messenger guards&quot;. He also was the first coach to have his staff film the opposition and have his team break down those game films in a classroom setting. In fact, the classroom setting and chalkboard analysis can also be attributed to him. His success with the Browns forced the rest of both leagues to adopt his methods. Many of his players and assistants eventually coached champions. Brown declined efforts to draft him to succeed Bert Bell as NFL commissioner, later founded the American Football League&#x27;s Cincinnati Bengals, and later served on the NFL&#x27;s key Competition Committee until his death in 1991.

These and other AAFC innovations and personalities helped lay the groundwork for professional football&#x27;s great success.

The merger would also benefit the Pittsburgh Steelers. One of the NFL&#x27;s shakiest franchises financially prior to the merger, the addition of the Browns would help form a rivalry due to the close proximity of Cleveland and Pittsburgh that would be cut to two hours driving time by the time the Ohio Turnpike and the western extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike were completed by the mid-1950s, allowing fans of both teams to attend each other&#x27;s away games. While the Steelers would largely remain non-competitive until that team&#x27;s 1970s dominance, the rivalry with the Browns along with their existing rivalry with the Eagles would help stabilize the team&#x27;s finances.

Finally, the Browns&#x27; NFL Championship in their first year in the NFL and their domination of that league for the next decade, in retrospect, seem to have been harbingers of another upstart league that like the AAFC was ridiculed and reviled by the NFL and its supporters, but would eventually be recognized as the genesis of modern professional football: the American Football League of 1960–1969.

==Postseason games==

===Championship games===
&quot;From 1946 to 1948 the champions of each division met in the AAFC championship game. In 1949, there was only one seven-team division, so the championship game was the final round of a four team tournament.&quot;

===Other playoff games===
&quot;In 1948, there was a tie for first place in the Eastern Division. In 1949, there was only one seven-team division, so the playoffs were a four team tournament.&quot;

===All-Star game===

&quot;The AAFC played an all-star game only once, following the 1949 season. This game, played in Houston and known as the &quot;Shamrock Bowl&quot;, was the league&#x27;s last game before the merger with the NFL. The champion Browns faced a team of All-Stars from the other six teams.&quot;

<text>A Christmas Carol. In Prose. Being a Ghost Story of Christmas, commonly known as A Christmas Carol, is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in London by Chapman &amp; Hall in 1843 and illustrated by John Leech. It recounts the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, an elderly miser who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. In the process, Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man.

Dickens wrote &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; during a period when the British were exploring and re-evaluating past Christmas traditions, including carols, and newer customs such as cards and Christmas trees. He was influenced by the experiences of his own youth and by the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several establishments for London&#x27;s street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a selfish man to redeem himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this is a fully secular story or a Christian allegory.

Published on 19 December, the first edition sold out by Christmas Eve; by the end of 1844 thirteen editions had been released. Most critics reviewed the novella favourably. The story was illicitly copied in January 1844; Dickens took legal action against the publishers, who went bankrupt, further reducing Dickens&#x27;s small profits from the publication. He subsequently wrote four other Christmas stories. In 1849 he began public readings of the story, which proved so successful he undertook 127 further performances until 1870, the year of his death. &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; has never been out of print and has been translated into several languages; the story has been adapted many times for film, stage, opera and other media.

&quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; captured the zeitgeist of the early Victorian revival of the Christmas holiday. Dickens acknowledged the influence of the modern Western observance of Christmas and later inspired several aspects of Christmas, including family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit.

==Plot==

The book is divided into five chapters, which Dickens titled &quot;staves&quot;.

===Stave one===
&quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; opens on a bleak, cold Christmas Eve in London, seven years after the death of Ebenezer Scrooge&#x27;s business partner, Jacob Marley. Scrooge, an ageing miser, dislikes Christmas and refuses a dinner invitation from his nephew Fred. He turns away two men seeking a donation to provide food and heating for the poor and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit, Christmas Day off with pay to conform to the social custom.

That night Scrooge is visited at home by Marley&#x27;s ghost, who wanders the Earth entwined by heavy chains and money boxes forged during a lifetime of greed and selfishness. Marley tells Scrooge that he has a single chance to avoid the same fate: he will be visited by three spirits and must listen or be cursed to carry much heavier chains of his own.

===Stave two===
The first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge&#x27;s boyhood, reminding him of a time when he was more innocent. The scenes reveal Scrooge&#x27;s lonely childhood at boarding school, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, the long-dead mother of Fred, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, Mr Fezziwig, who treated him like a son. Scrooge&#x27;s neglected fiancée Belle is shown ending their relationship, as she realises that he will never love her as much as he loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on the Christmas Eve that Marley died. Scrooge, upset by hearing a description of the man that he has become, demands that the ghost remove him from the house.

===Stave three===
The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, takes Scrooge to a joyous market where people are buying the makings of Christmas dinner and to celebrations of Christmas in a miner&#x27;s cottage and in a lighthouse. Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred&#x27;s Christmas party. A major part of this stave is taken up with Bob Cratchit&#x27;s family feast and introduces his youngest son, Tiny Tim, a happy boy who is seriously ill. The spirit informs Scrooge that Tiny Tim will die unless the course of events changes. Before disappearing, the spirit shows Scrooge two hideous, emaciated children named Ignorance and Want. He tells Scrooge to beware the former above all and mocks Scrooge&#x27;s concern for their welfare.

===Stave four===

The third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. The silent ghost reveals scenes involving the death of a disliked man whose funeral is attended by local businessmen only on condition that lunch is provided. His charwoman, laundress and the local undertaker steal his possessions to sell to a fence. When he asks the spirit to show a single person who feels emotion over his death, he is only given the pleasure of a poor couple who rejoice that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order. When Scrooge asks to see tenderness connected with any death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the death of Tiny Tim. The ghost then allows Scrooge to see a neglected grave, with a tombstone bearing Scrooge&#x27;s name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to change his ways.

===Stave five===
Scrooge awakens on Christmas morning a changed man. He makes a large donation to the charity he rejected the previous day, anonymously sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner and spends the afternoon at Fred&#x27;s Christmas party. The following day he gives Cratchit an increase in pay, and begins to become a father figure to Tiny Tim. From then on Scrooge treats everyone with kindness, generosity and compassion, embodying the spirit of Christmas.

==Background==

The writer Charles Dickens was born to a middle-class family which got into financial difficulties as a result of the spendthrift nature of his father John. In 1824 John was committed to the Marshalsea, a debtors&#x27; prison in Southwark, London. Dickens, aged 12, was forced to pawn his collection of books, leave school and work at a dirty and rat-infested shoe-blacking factory. The change in circumstances gave him what his biographer, Michael Slater, describes as a &quot;deep personal and social outrage&quot;, which heavily influenced his writing and outlook.

By the end of 1842 Dickens was a well-established author with six major works as well as several short stories, novellas and other pieces. On 31 December that year he began publishing his novel &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; as a monthly serial; it was his favourite work, but sales were disappointing and he faced temporary financial difficulties.

Celebrating the Christmas season had been growing in popularity through the Victorian era. The Christmas tree was introduced in Britain during the 18th century, and its use was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. In the early 19th century there had been a revival of interest in Christmas carols, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years. The publication of Davies Gilbert&#x27;s 1823 work &quot;Some Ancient Christmas Carols, With the Tunes to Which They Were Formerly Sung in the West of England&quot; and William Sandys&#x27;s 1833 collection &quot;Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern&quot; led to a growth in the form&#x27;s popularity in Britain.

Dickens had an interest in Christmas, and his first story on the subject was &quot;Christmas Festivities&quot;, published in &quot;Bell&#x27;s Weekly Messenger&quot; in 1835; the story was then published as &quot;A Christmas Dinner&quot; in &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot; (1836). &quot;The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton&quot;, another Christmas story, appeared in the 1836 novel &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;. In the episode, a Mr Wardle describes a misanthropic sexton, Gabriel Grub, who undergoes a Christmas conversion after being visited by goblins who show him the past and future. Slater considers that &quot;the main elements of the &quot;Carol&quot; are present in the story&quot;, but not yet in a firm form. The story is followed by a passage about Christmas in Dickens&#x27;s editorial &quot;Master Humphrey&#x27;s Clock&quot;. The professor of English literature Paul Davis writes that although the &quot;Goblins&quot; story appears to be a prototype of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, all Dickens&#x27;s earlier writings about Christmas influenced the story.

===Literary influences===

Dickens was not the first author to celebrate the Christmas season in literature. Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819–20 work &quot;The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.&quot; included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham. The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that returning to Christmas traditions might promote a type of social connection that they felt had been lost in the modern world.

Several works had an influence on the writing of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, including two essays by his friend Douglas Jerrold: one from an 1841 issue of &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;How Mr. Chokepear Keeps a Merry Christmas&quot; and one from 1843, &quot;The Beauties of the Police&quot;. More broadly, Dickens was influenced by fairy tales and nursery stories, which he closely associated with Christmas, because he saw them as stories of conversion and transformation.

===Social influences===

Dickens was touched by the lot of poor children in the middle decades of the 19th century. In early 1843 he toured the Cornish tin mines, where he was angered by seeing children working in appalling conditions. The suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital&#x27;s half-starved, illiterate street children.

In February 1843 the &quot;Second Report of the Children&#x27;s Employment Commission&quot; was published. It was a parliamentary report exposing the effects of the Industrial Revolution upon working class children. Horrified by what he read, Dickens planned to publish an inexpensive political pamphlet tentatively titled, &quot;An Appeal to the People of England, on behalf of the Poor Man&#x27;s Child&quot;, but changed his mind, deferring the pamphlet&#x27;s production until the end of the year. In March he wrote to Dr Southwood Smith, one of the four commissioners responsible for the &quot;Second Report&quot;, about his change in plans: &quot;you will certainly feel that a Sledge hammer has come down with twenty times the force—twenty thousand times the force—I could exert by following out my first idea&quot;.

In a fundraising speech on 5 October 1843 at the Manchester Athenaeum, Dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance with educational reform, and realised in the days following that the most effective way to reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice was to write a deeply felt Christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays.

===Writing history===

By mid-1843 Dickens began to suffer from financial problems. Sales of &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; were falling off, and his wife, Catherine, was pregnant with their fifth child. Matters worsened when Chapman &amp; Hall, his publishers, threatened to reduce his monthly income by £50 if sales dropped further. He began &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; in October 1843. Michael Slater, Dickens&#x27;s biographer, describes the book as being &quot;written at white heat&quot;; it was completed in six weeks, the final pages being written in early December. He built much of the work in his head while taking night-time walks of around London. Dickens&#x27;s sister-in-law wrote how he &quot;wept, and laughed, and wept again, and excited himself in a most extraordinary manner, in composition&quot;. Slater says that &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; was

intended to open its readers&#x27; hearts towards those struggling to survive on the lower rungs of the economic ladder and to encourage practical benevolence, but also to warn of the terrible danger to society created by the toleration of widespread ignorance and actual want among the poor.

George Cruikshank, the illustrator who had earlier worked with Dickens on &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot; (1836) and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1838), introduced him to the caricaturist John Leech. By 24 October Dickens invited Leech to work on &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, and four hand-coloured etchings and four black-and-white wood engravings by the artist accompanied the text. Dickens&#x27;s hand-written manuscript of the story does not include the sentence in the penultimate paragraph &quot;... and to Tiny Tim, who did &quot;not&quot; die&quot;; this was added later, during the printing process.

==Characters==

The central character of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; is Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly London-based businessman, described in the story as &quot;a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!&quot; Kelly writes that Scrooge may have been influenced by Dickens&#x27;s conflicting feelings for his father, whom he both loved and demonised. This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the tale—one a cold, stingy and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man. The professor of English literature Robert Douglas-Fairhurst considers that in the opening part of the book covering young Scrooge&#x27;s lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty &quot;is something of a self-parody of Dickens&#x27;s fears about himself&quot;; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself.

Scrooge could also be based on two misers: the eccentric John Elwes, MP, or Jemmy Wood, the owner of the Gloucester Old Bank and also known as &quot;The Gloucester Miser&quot;. According to the sociologist Frank W. Elwell, Scrooge&#x27;s views on the poor are a reflection of those of the demographer and political economist Thomas Malthus, while the miser&#x27;s questions &quot;Are there no prisons? ... And the Union workhouses? ... The treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?&quot; are a reflection of a sarcastic question raised by the philosopher Thomas Carlyle, &quot;Are there not treadmills, gibbets; even hospitals, poor-rates, New Poor-Law?&quot;

There are literary precursors for Scrooge in Dickens&#x27;s own works. Peter Ackroyd, Dickens&#x27;s biographer, sees similarities between the character and the elder Martin Chuzzlewit character, although the miser is &quot;a more fantastic image&quot; than the Chuzzlewit patriarch; Ackroyd observes that Chuzzlewit&#x27;s transformation to a charitable figure is a parallel to that of the miser. Douglas-Fairhurst sees that the minor character Gabriel Grub from &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; was also an influence when creating Scrooge. It is possible that Scrooge&#x27;s name came from a tombstone Dickens had seen on a visit to Edinburgh. The grave was for Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose job was given as a meal man—a corn merchant; Dickens misread the inscription as &quot;mean man&quot;. This theory has been described as &quot;a probable Dickens hoax&quot; for which &quot;[n]o one could find any corroborating evidence&quot;.

When Dickens was young he lived near a tradesman&#x27;s premises with the sign &quot;Goodge and Marney&quot;, which may have provided the name for Scrooge&#x27;s former business partner. For the chained Marley, Dickens drew on his memory of a visit to the Western Penitentiary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in March 1842, where he saw—and was affected by seeing—fettered prisoners. For the character Tiny Tim, Dickens used his nephew Henry, a disabled boy who was five at the time &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; was written. The two figures of Want and Ignorance, sheltering in the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present, were inspired by the children Dickens had seen on his visit to a ragged school in the East End of London.

==Themes==

The transformation of Scrooge is central to the story. Davis considers Scrooge to be &quot;a protean figure always in process of reformation&quot;; Kelly writes that the transformation is reflected in the description of Scrooge, who begins as a two-dimensional character, but who then grows into one who &quot;possess[es] an emotional depth [and] a regret for lost opportunities&quot;. Some writers, including the Dickens scholar Grace Moore, consider that there is a Christian theme running through &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, and that the novella should be seen as an allegory of the Christian concept of redemption. Dickens&#x27;s biographer, Claire Tomalin, sees the conversion of Scrooge as carrying the Christian message that &quot;even the worst of sinners may repent and become a good man&quot;. Dickens&#x27;s attitudes towards organised religion were complex; he based his beliefs and principles on the New Testament. His statement that Marley &quot;had no bowels&quot; is a reference to the &quot;bowels of compassion&quot; mentioned in the First Epistle of John, the reason for his eternal damnation.

Other writers, including Kelly, consider that Dickens put forward a &quot;secular vision of this sacred holiday&quot;. The Dickens scholar John O. Jordan argues that &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; shows what Dickens referred to in a letter to his friend John Forster as his &quot;&quot;Carol&quot; philosophy, cheerful views, sharp anatomisation of humbug, jolly good temper ... and a vein of glowing, hearty, generous, mirthful, beaming reference in everything to Home and Fireside&quot;. From a secular viewpoint, the cultural historian Penne Restad suggests that Scrooge&#x27;s redemption underscores &quot;the conservative, individualistic and patriarchal aspects&quot; of Dickens&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Carol&quot; philosophy&quot; of charity and altruism.

Dickens wrote &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; in response to British social attitudes towards poverty, particularly child poverty, and wished to use the novella as a means to put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity without alienating his largely middle-class readership.

==Publication==

As the result of the disagreements with Chapman and Hall over the commercial failures of &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;, Dickens arranged to pay for the publishing himself, in exchange for a percentage of the profits. Production of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; was not without problems. The first printing was meant to have festive green endpapers, but they came out a dull olive colour. Dickens&#x27;s publisher Chapman and Hall replaced these with yellow endpapers and reworked the title page in harmonising red and blue shades. The final product was bound in red cloth with gilt-edged pages, completed only two days before the publication date of 19 December 1843. Following publication, Dickens arranged for the manuscript to be bound in red Morocco leather and presented as a gift to his solicitor, Thomas Mitton.

Priced at five shillings (equal to £ in 2025 pounds), the first run of 6,000 copies sold out by Christmas Eve. Chapman and Hall issued second and third editions before the new year, and the book continued to sell well into 1844. By the end of 1844 eleven more editions had been released. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print. It was Dickens&#x27;s most popular book in the United States, and sold over two million copies in the hundred years following its first publication there.

The high production costs upon which Dickens insisted led to reduced profits, and the first edition brought him only £230 (equal to £ in 2025 pounds) rather than the £1,000 (equal to £ in 2025 pounds) he expected. A year later, the profits were only £744, and Dickens was deeply disappointed.

==Reception==

According to Douglas-Fairhurst, contemporary reviews of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; &quot;were almost uniformly kind&quot;. &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; described how the story&#x27;s &quot;impressive eloquence ... its unfeigned lightness of heart—its playful and sparkling humour ... its gentle spirit of humanity&quot; all put the reader &quot;in good humour with ourselves, with each other, with the season and with the author&quot;. The critic from &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;, the literary magazine, considered it a &quot;tale to make the reader laugh and cry – to open his hands, and open his heart to charity even toward the uncharitable ... a dainty dish to set before a King.&quot; William Makepeace Thackeray, writing in &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, described the book as &quot;a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness. The last two people I heard speak of it were women; neither knew the other, or the author, and both said, by way of criticism, &#x27;God bless him!&#x27;&quot;

The poet Thomas Hood, in his own journal, wrote that &quot;If Christmas, with its ancient and hospitable customs, its social and charitable observances, were ever in danger of decay, this is the book that would give them a new lease.&quot; The reviewer for &quot;Tait&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot;—Theodore Martin, who was usually critical of Dickens&#x27;s work—spoke well of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, noting it was &quot;a noble book, finely felt and calculated to work much social good&quot;. After Dickens&#x27;s death, Margaret Oliphant deplored the turkey and plum pudding aspects of the book but admitted that in the days of its first publication it was regarded as &quot;a new gospel&quot;, and noted that the book was unique in that it made people behave better. The religious press generally ignored the tale but, in January 1844, &quot;Christian Remembrancer&quot; thought the tale&#x27;s old and hackneyed subject was treated in an original way and praised the author&#x27;s sense of humour and pathos. The writer and social thinker John Ruskin told a friend that he thought Dickens had taken the religion from Christmas, and had imagined it as &quot;mistletoe and pudding—neither resurrection from the dead, nor rising of new stars, nor teaching of wise men, nor shepherds&quot;.

There were critics of the book. &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot; praised the story, but thought the book&#x27;s physical excesses—the gilt edges and expensive binding—kept the price high, making it unavailable to the poor. The review recommended that the tale should be printed on cheap paper and priced accordingly. An unnamed writer for &quot;The Westminster Review&quot; mocked Dickens&#x27;s grasp of economics, asking &quot;Who went without turkey and punch in order that Bob Cratchit might get them—for, unless there were turkeys and punch in surplus, someone must go without&quot;.

Dickens had criticised the US in &quot;American Notes&quot; and &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;, making American readers reluctant to embrace his work, but by the end of the American Civil War, the book had gained wide recognition in American households. In 1863 &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an enthusiastic review, noting that the author brought the &quot;old Christmas ... of bygone centuries and remote manor houses, into the living rooms of the poor of today&quot;.

==Aftermath==

In January 1844 Parley&#x27;s Illuminated Library published an unauthorised version of the story in a condensed form which they sold for twopence. Dickens wrote to his solicitor

I have not the least doubt that if these Vagabonds can be stopped they must. ... Let us be the &quot;sledge-hammer&quot; in this, or I shall be beset by hundreds of the same crew when I come out with a long story.

Two days after the release of the Parley version, Dickens sued on the basis of copyright infringement and won. The publishers declared themselves bankrupt and Dickens was left to pay £700 in costs. The small profits Dickens earned from &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; further strained his relationship with his publishers, and he broke with them in favour of Bradbury and Evans, who had been printing his works to that point.

Dickens returned to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised on the success of the book by publishing other Christmas stories: &quot;The Chimes&quot; (1844), &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth&quot; (1845), &quot;The Battle of Life&quot; (1846) and &quot;The Haunted Man and the Ghost&#x27;s Bargain&quot; (1848); these were secular conversion tales which acknowledged the progressive societal changes of the previous year, and highlighted those social problems which still needed to be addressed. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.

==Performances and adaptations==

By 1849 Dickens was engaged with &quot;David Copperfield&quot; and had neither the time nor the inclination to produce another Christmas book. He decided the best way to reach his audience with his &quot;Carol philosophy&quot; was by public readings. During Christmas 1853 he gave a reading in Birmingham Town Hall to the Industrial and Literary Institute. He insisted that tickets be reserved for working-class attendees at quarter-price and the performance was a great success. Thereafter, he read the tale in an abbreviated version 127 times, until 1870 (the year of his death), including at his farewell performance.
In the years following the book&#x27;s publication, responses to the tale were published by W. M. Swepstone (&quot;Christmas Shadows&quot;, 1850), Horatio Alger (&quot;Job Warner&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, 1863), Louisa May Alcott (&quot;A Christmas Dream, and How It Came True&quot;, 1882), and others who followed Scrooge&#x27;s life as a reformed man – or some who thought Dickens had got it wrong and needed to be corrected.

The novella was adapted for the stage almost immediately. Three productions opened on 5 February 1844, one by Edward Stirling, &quot;A Christmas Carol; or, Past, Present, and Future&quot;, being sanctioned by Dickens and running for more than 40 nights. By the close of February 1844 eight rival &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; theatrical productions were playing in London. The story has been adapted for film and television more than any of Dickens&#x27;s other works. In 1901 it was produced as &quot;Scrooge, or, Marley&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, a silent black-and-white British film; it was one of the first known adaptations of a Dickens work on film, but it is now largely lost. The story was adapted in 1923 for BBC radio. It has been adapted to other media, including opera, ballet, animation, stage musicals and a BBC mime production starring Marcel Marceau.

Davis considers the adaptations have become better remembered than the original. Some of Dickens&#x27;s scenes—such as visiting the miners and lighthouse keepers—have been forgotten by many, while other events often added—such as Scrooge visiting the Cratchits on Christmas Day—are now thought by many to be part of the original story. Accordingly, Davis distinguishes between the original text and the &quot;remembered version&quot;.

==Legacy==

The phrase &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; had been around for many years—the earliest known written use was in a letter in 1534—but Dickens&#x27;s use of the phrase in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; popularised it among the Victorian public. The exclamation &quot;Bah! Humbug!&quot; entered popular use in the English language as a retort to anything sentimental or overly festive; the name &quot;Scrooge&quot; became used as a designation for a miser and was added to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; as such in 1982.

In the early 19th century the celebration of Christmas was associated in Britain with the countryside and peasant revels, disconnected to the increasing urbanisation and industrialisation taking place. Davis considers that in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, Dickens showed that Christmas could be celebrated in towns and cities, despite increasing modernisation. The modern observance of Christmas in English-speaking countries is largely the result of a Victorian-era revival of the holiday. The Oxford Movement of the 1830s and 1840s had produced a resurgence of the traditional rituals and religious observances associated with Christmastide and, with &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, Dickens captured the zeitgeist while he reflected and reinforced his vision of Christmas.

Dickens advocated a humanitarian focus of the holiday, which influenced several aspects of Christmas that are still celebrated in Western culture, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit. The historian Ronald Hutton writes that Dickens &quot;linked worship and feasting, within a context of social reconciliation&quot;.
The novelist William Dean Howells, analysing several of Dickens&#x27;s Christmas stories, including &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, considered that by 1891 the &quot;pathos appears false and strained; the humor largely horseplay; the characters theatrical; the joviality pumped; the psychology commonplace; the sociology alone funny&quot;. The writer James Joyce considered that Dickens took a childish approach with &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, producing a gap between the naïve optimism of the story and the realities of life at the time.

Ruth Glancy, the professor of English literature, states that the largest impact of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; was the influence felt by individual readers. In early 1844 &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; attributed a rise of charitable giving in Britain to Dickens&#x27;s novella; in 1874, Robert Louis Stevenson, after reading Dickens&#x27;s Christmas books, vowed to give generously to those in need, and Thomas Carlyle expressed a generous hospitality by hosting two Christmas dinners after reading the book. In 1867 one American businessman was so moved by attending a reading that he closed his factory on Christmas Day and sent every employee a turkey, while in the early years of the 20th century Maud of Wales—the Queen of Norway—sent gifts to London&#x27;s crippled children signed &quot;With Tiny Tim&#x27;s Love&quot;. On the novella, the author G. K. Chesterton wrote &quot;The beauty and blessing of the story ... lie in the great furnace of real happiness that glows through Scrooge and everything around him. ... Whether the Christmas visions would or would not convert Scrooge, they convert us.&quot;

Analysing the changes made to adaptations over time, Davis sees changes to the focus of the story and its characters to reflect mainstream thinking of the period. While Dickens&#x27;s Victorian audiences would have viewed the tale as a spiritual but secular parable, in the early 20th century it became a children&#x27;s story, read by parents who remembered their parents reading it when they were younger. In the lead-up to and during the Great Depression, Davis suggests that while some saw the story as a &quot;denunciation of capitalism, ...most read it as a way to escape oppressive economic realities&quot;. The film versions of the 1930s were different in the UK and US. British-made films showed a traditional telling of the story, while US-made works showed Cratchit in a more central role, escaping the depression caused by European bankers and celebrating what Davis calls &quot;the Christmas of the common man&quot;. In the 1960s, Scrooge was sometimes portrayed as a Freudian figure wrestling with his past. By the 1980s he was again set in a world of depression and economic uncertainty.

<doc id="73672" wikidata="Q7030" url="?curid=73672" title="Wismar">
<text>Wismar (; ), officially the Hanseatic City of Wismar () is, with around 43,000 inhabitants, the sixth-largest city of the northeastern German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and the fourth-largest city of Mecklenburg after Rostock, Schwerin and Neubrandenburg. The city was the third-largest port city in former East Germany after Rostock and Stralsund.

Wismar is located on the Bay of Wismar of the Baltic Sea, directly opposite the island of Poel, that separates the Bay of Wismar from the larger Bay of Mecklenburg. The city lies in the middle between the two larger port cities of Lübeck in the west, and Rostock in the east, and the state capital of Schwerin is located south of the city on Lake Schwerin. Wismar lies in the northeastern corner of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region, and is the capital of the district of Northwestern Mecklenburg. The city&#x27;s natural harbour is protected by a promontory. The uninhabited island of Walfisch, lying between Wismar and the island of Poel, administratively belongs to the borough of Wismar-Wendorf.

It is estimated that Wismar was founded in 1226 under Henry Borwin I, Lord of Mecklenburg from the House of Mecklenburg, a German dynasty of Slavic origin also known as the Obotrites or Niklotides. In 1259, the city became part of the Hanseatic League. Throughout its history, the city has been under control of various German states as well as the Swedish Empire. It was part of Sweden from 1648 until 1803 ( until 1903, when Sweden officially renounced its claims to the city), and this Swedish chapter of the city is celebrated annually with a large &quot;Sweden Celebration&quot;. From 1815 until 1918, Wismar lay in the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and later in the Free State of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

Wismar is a typical representative of the Hanseatic League with its city-wide Brick Gothic structures and iconic gabled patrician houses and was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List alongside the historical old town of Stralsund in 2002. Wismar is the seat of , a university of applied sciences, one of nine institutions of higher education in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. With MV Werften Wismar, the city is one of three cruise ship-producing locations of MV Werften (along with Rostock and Stralsund), and the shipyard with its tall white-blue hall is one of the city&#x27;s largest employers. St. George&#x27;s, St. Nicholas&#x27; and St. Mary&#x27;s, of which only the tower is left standing, are the three iconic sacred buildings dominating the skyline of Wismar.

==History==

The name of the settlement was first recorded in the 12th century as Visemer, Wismar (1147, 1167), Wyssemaria (1229)&quot; &quot;and is probably of Slavic origin although finally disputed. Wismar could have the same Old Saxon origin like the German city Weimar.&quot; &quot;Wismar was part of the Western Slavic Obotrites&#x27; territory.

The exact date of the city&#x27;s foundation is not clear. In the oldest existing document of Wismar of 1229 its civic rights are already established. In 1301 Wismar came under the rule of the House of Mecklenburg. In 1259 Wismar joined a defensive agreement with Lübeck and Rostock, in order to effectively counter the numerous Baltic pirates. Subsequently more cities of the northern Holy Roman Empire would agree to cooperate as commerce and trade was increasingly coordinated and regulated. These policies would provide the basis for the development of the Hanseatic League. By the 13th and 14th centuries Wismar had grown into a flourishing Hanseatic trading hub and an important center of wool processing. Although around 2,000 of its inhabitants perished during the plague of 1376, the town remained reasonably prosperous until the 16th century.

===Under Swedish rule===


With the Peace of Westphalia of 1648 Wismar came under the territorial control of Sweden. Through the acquisition of Wismar and other dominions in the Holy Roman Empire, the Kings of Sweden in their role as imperial princes were entitled to a seat in the Imperial Diet. Wismar became administrative center of Wismar town and the districts of Pod and Neukloster, and after 1653 the &quot;Fürstenhof&quot; (prince&#x27;s court) served as the seat of the supreme court for all Swedish dominions in the Holy Roman Empire. Wismar&#x27;s fortifications were extended into an effective all-round defence system under the supervision of Field Marshal Erik Dahlbergh. Remains of these fortifications have been preserved, among other places, in the ‘Lindengarten&#x27; to the east of the wall of the old city. During the Scanian War, the town was besieged and captured by Danish forces in 1675.

In 1803, Sweden ceded both the town and lordship to the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin for 1,258,000 Riksdalers, but reserved the right of redemption after 100 years. In view of this contingent right of Sweden, Wismar was not represented at the diet of Mecklenburg-Schwerin until 1897. In 1903, Sweden finally renounced its claims to the town. Wismar still retains a few relics of its old privileges, including the right to fly its own flag.

===20th century===
By the end of the 19th century Wismar&#x27;s most important manufacturing branches were the production of iron and steel, roofing-felt, asphalt, paper and machine industry. International sea trade took place at the local harbour, which was deep enough to admit vessels of up to draught at its quays. Exports included grains, oil-seeds and butter as coal, timber and iron were imported. Wismar was production site for several railroad rolling stock manufacturers and since 1933 home to &quot;Norddeutsche Dornier-Werke&quot; of aircraft manufacturer Dornier. On 14 May 1881 Rudolph Karstadt opened his first shop (&quot;Tuch-, Manufaktur- und Konfektionsgeschäft&quot;) of the now well established department store chain Karstadt in Wismar.

During World War II, it was the location of a forced labour subcamp of the Nazi prison in Bützow-Dreibergen. Wismar was heavily bombed and destroyed by Allied air raids. As the line of contact between Soviet and other Allied armies formed in Europe at the end of the war, Wismar was captured by the British 6th Airborne Division&#x27;s 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion on 2 May 1945, James Hill commanding, in accordance with Operation Eclipse. On 7 May 1945 British Field Marshal Montgomery and Soviet Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky met in Wismar. In accord with the &quot;Occupation Zone Agreements&quot; of the Yalta Conference Wismar became a part of the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany on 1 July 1945, as British troops retreated and Soviet troops took control over the area.

During the 1949 to 1990 era of the German Democratic Republic, Wismar became East Germany&#x27;s second-largest port, after Rostock and developed a shipbuilding industry. Although the GDR government had pledged to restore the local churches and historic sites that had been heavily bombed during the war, this commitment was for the most part not fulfilled.

After German reunification in 1990, churches and all historic buildings in the city&#x27;s town center were restored, and the old towns of Wismar and Stralsund ( to the east), were listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 2011, Wismar became the capital of the district of Nordwestmecklenburg.

==Sights and architecture==
The historical old town, centered on the huge marketplace (one of the largest in northern Germany at ), is characterized by town houses, manufacture and trading structures of the Hanseatic League, built in Brick Gothic style during the 13th to 15th centuries, 19th-century Romanesque Revival architecture and Art Nouveau houses. Distinctive buildings and military works, built during the period of Swedish control during the 17th and the 18th centuries provide another layer of cultural influence.

The market square&#x27;s focal point is the &quot;Wasserkunst&quot;, an elaborate wrought-iron fountain imported from Holland in 1602. The northern side of the square is occupied by the Town Hall, built in Neoclassical style from 1817 to 1819. Another notable building on the square is a Brick Gothic patrician&#x27;s home (&quot;Bürgerhaus&quot;) called &quot;Alter Schwede&quot; (Old Swede), erected around 1380.

St. George&#x27;s Church, the third so-named edifice on the site, dates from 1404. It had escaped major damage during most of World War II, but on 14 April 1945, three weeks before the end of the war it was badly damaged by &quot;Blockbuster bombs&quot; dropped by the British Royal Air Force. Reconstruction after German reunification, costing some 40 million Euros, was completed in 2010.

The tower church of St. Mary&#x27;s Church (&quot;Marienkirche&quot;) is the only remainder of the original Brick Gothic edifice, built during the first half of the 13th century. It suffered heavy damage in World War II and was partially razed in 1960 during the East German era.

St. Mary&#x27;s Church and the church of St. Nicholas (&quot;Nikolaikirche&quot;) with its very lofty vaulting, built from 1381 to 1460, serve as prime examples of Lübeck&#x27;s St. Mary&#x27;s Churches architectural influence on the entire region.

The &quot;Fürstenhof&quot;, a richly decorated specimen of early Italian Renaissance style was once a ducal residence and served later as the seat of the municipal authorities. Built from 1552 to 1565, it was restored from 1877 to 1879. The &quot;Old School&quot;, dating from about 1300, has not been restored yet. The town hall, rebuilt in 1829, houses a gallery of paintings. The Fine Arts Municipal Gallery &quot;Baumhaus&quot; is located in the old harbour area.

==Wismar in art and literature==

* Wismar (renamed &quot;Wisborg&quot;) was the setting of the 1922 silent film &quot;&quot; (&quot;Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror&quot;). This German Expressionist horror film, directed by F. W. Murnau and starring Max Schreck as the vampire Count Orlok, was partly shot in Wismar. Filming began in July 1921, with exterior shots in Wismar. A take from the Marienkirche&#x27;s (Saint Mary&#x27;s Church) tower over Wismar marketplace with the Wasserkunst Wismar (waterworks fountain) served as the establishing shot for the Wisborg scene. Other locations included the &quot;Wassertor&quot; (Water Gate), the southside of St. Nicholas, the &quot;Heilig-Geist-Kirche&quot; (Holy-Spirit-Church) and the harbour area.
* Wismar was also the setting of Werner Herzog&#x27;s 1979 remake &quot;Nosferatu, Phantom der Nacht&quot;. However, Herzog unable to film in Wismar, relocated his production to the cities of Delft and Schiedam in the Netherlands. The 2000 metafiction horror film &quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot;, directed by E. Elias Merhige which depicts the filming of the 1922 silent movie also takes place in Wismar.

<doc id="73678" wikidata="Q32884" url="?curid=73678" title="Green Lantern">
<text>Green Lantern is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. They fight evil with the aid of rings that grant them a variety of extraordinary powers, all of which come from imagination, fearlessness, and the electromagnetic spectrum of emotional willpower. The characters are typically depicted as members of the Green Lantern Corps, an intergalactic law enforcement agency.

The first Green Lantern character, Alan Scott, was created in 1940 by Martin Nodell with scripting or co-scripting of the first stories by Bill Finger during the Golden Age of Comic Books and usually fought common criminals in Capitol City (and later, Gotham City) with the aid of his magic ring. For the Silver Age of Comic Books, John Broome and Gil Kane reinvented the character as Hal Jordan in 1959 and introduced the Green Lantern Corps, shifting the nature of the character from fantasy to science fiction. During the Bronze Age of Comic Books, Dennis O&#x27;Neil and Neal Adams introduced John Stewart, a new member of the Corps who was one of DC&#x27;s first black superheroes. Other notable Green Lanterns include Guy Gardner, Kyle Rayner, Simon Baz, Jessica Cruz and Jo Mullein.

The Green Lanterns are among DC Comics&#x27; longest lasting sets of characters. They have been adapted to television, video games, and motion pictures.

==Publication history==
=== Golden Age ===

Martin Nodell (initially using the pen-name Mart Dellon) created the first Green Lantern in collaboration with Bill Finger. He first appeared in the Golden Age of Comic Books in &quot;All-American Comics&quot; #16 (July 1940), published by All-American Publications, one of three companies that would eventually merge to form DC Comics.

This Green Lantern&#x27;s real name was Alan Scott, a railroad engineer who, after a railway crash, came into possession of a magic lantern which spoke to him and said it would bring power. From this, he crafted a magic ring that gave him a wide variety of powers. The limitations of the ring were that it had to be &quot;charged&quot; every 24 hours by touching it to the lantern for a time and that it could not directly affect objects made of wood. Alan Scott fought mostly ordinary human villains, but he did have a few paranormal ones such as the immortal Vandal Savage and the zombie Solomon Grundy. Most stories took place in New York. Green Lantern rings are made from magic.

As a popular character in the 1940s, the Green Lantern featured both in anthology books such as &quot;All-American Comics&quot; and &quot;Comic Cavalcade&quot;, as well as his own book, &quot;Green Lantern&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; as a member of the superhero team known as the Justice Society of America.

After World War II the popularity of superheroes in general declined. The &quot;Green Lantern&quot; comic book was cancelled with issue #38 (May–June 1949), and &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #57 (1951) was the character&#x27;s last Golden Age appearance. When superheroes came back in fashion in later decades, the character Alan Scott was revived, but he was forever marginalized by the new Hal Jordan character who had been created to supplant him (see below). Initially, he made guest appearances in other superheroes&#x27; books, but eventually got regular roles in books featuring the Justice Society. He never got another solo series, although he did star in individual stories and in the single-issue 2002 comic book &quot;Brightest Day, Blackest Night.&quot; Between 1995 and 2003, DC Comics changed Alan Scott&#x27;s superhero codename to &quot;Sentinel&quot; in order to distinguish him from the newer and more popular science fictional Green Lanterns.

In 2011, the Alan Scott character was revamped. His costume was redesigned to be all green and the source of his powers was changed to that of the mystical power of nature (referred to in the stories as &quot;the Green&quot;).

===Silver Age===
In 1959, Julius Schwartz reinvented the Green Lantern character as a science fiction hero named Hal Jordan. Hal Jordan&#x27;s powers were more or less the same as Alan Scott&#x27;s, but otherwise this character was completely different from the Green Lantern character of the 1940s. He had a new name, a redesigned costume, and a rewritten origin story. Hal Jordan received his ring from a dying alien and was commissioned as an officer of the Green Lantern Corps, an interstellar law enforcement agency overseen by the Guardians of the Universe.

Hal Jordan was introduced in &quot;Showcase&quot; #22 (September–October 1959). Gil Kane and Sid Greene were the art team most notable on the title in its early years, along with writer John Broome. His initial physical appearance, according to Kane, was patterned after his one-time neighbor, actor Paul Newman.

===Later developments===
With issue #76 (April 1970), the series made a radical stylistic departure. Editor Schwartz, in one of the company&#x27;s earliest efforts to provide more than fantasy, worked with the writer-artist team of Denny O&#x27;Neil and Neal Adams to spark new interest in the comic book series and address a perceived need for social relevance. They added the character Green Arrow (with the cover, but not the official name, retitled &quot;Green Lantern Co-Starring Green Arrow&quot;) and had the pair travel through America encountering &quot;real world&quot; issues, to which they reacted in different ways — Green Lantern as fundamentally a lawman, Green Arrow as a liberal iconoclast. Additionally during this run, the groundbreaking &quot;Snowbirds Don&#x27;t Fly&quot; story was published (issues #85–86) in which Green Arrow&#x27;s teen sidekick Speedy (the later grown-up hero Red Arrow) developed a heroin addiction that he was forcibly made to quit. The stories were critically acclaimed, with publications such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and &quot;Newsweek&quot; citing it as an example of how comic books were &quot;growing up&quot;. However, the O&#x27;Neil/Adams run was not a commercial success, and the series was cancelled after only 14 issues, though an additional unpublished three installments were finally published as back-ups in &quot;The Flash&quot; #217–219.

The title saw a number of revivals and cancellations. It changed to &quot;Green Lantern Corps&quot; at one point as the popularity rose and waned. During a time there were two regular titles, each with a Green Lantern, and a third member in the Justice League. A new character, Kyle Rayner, was created to become the feature while Hal Jordan first became the villain Parallax, then died and came back as the Spectre.

In the wake of &quot;&quot;, writer Geoff Johns returned Hal Jordan as Green Lantern in &quot;Green Lantern: Rebirth&quot; (2004–05). Johns began to lay the groundwork for &quot;Blackest Night&quot; (released July 13, 2010)), viewing it as the third part of the trilogy started by &quot;Rebirth&quot;. Expanding on the Green Lantern mythology in the second part, &quot;Sinestro Corps War&quot; (2007), Johns, with artist Ethan van Sciver, found wide critical acclaim and commercial success with the series, which promised the introduction of a spectrum of colored &quot;lanterns&quot;.

=== Timeline ===
===Awards===
The series and its creators have received several awards over the years, including the 1961 Alley Award for Best Adventure Hero/Heroine with Own Book and the Academy of Comic Book Arts Shazam Award for Best Continuing Feature in 1970, for Best Individual Story (&quot;No Evil Shall Escape My Sight&quot;, &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 2) #76 by Dennis O&#x27;Neil and Neal Adams), and in 1971 for Best Individual Story (&quot;Snowbirds Don&#x27;t Fly&quot;, &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 2) #85 by O&#x27;Neil and Adams).

Writer O&#x27;Neil received the Shazam Award for Best Writer (Dramatic Division) in 1970 for his work on &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot; and other titles, while artist Adams received the Shazam for Best Artist (Dramatic Division) in 1970 for his work on &quot;Green Lantern&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot;. Inker Dick Giordano received the Shazam Award for Best Inker (Dramatic Division) for his work on &quot;Green Lantern&quot; and other titles.

In Judd Winick&#x27;s first regular writing assignment on Green Lantern, he wrote a storyline in which an assistant of Kyle Rayner&#x27;s emerged as a gay character in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 3) #137 (June 2001). In &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 3) #154 (November 2001) the story entitled &quot;Hate Crime&quot; gained media recognition when his friend Terry Berg was brutally beaten in a homophobic attack. Winick was interviewed on Phil Donahue&#x27;s show on MSNBC for that storyline on August 15, 2002 and received two GLAAD Media Awards for his Green Lantern work.

In May 2011, Green Lantern placed 7th on IGN&#x27;s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time.

==Powers and abilities==

Each Green Lantern wears a ring that grants them a variety of abilities. The ring is powered by willpower. The full extent of the ring&#x27;s abilities has never been rigorously defined in the stories, but two consistent traits are that it grants the power of flight and that all of its effects are accompanied by a green light.

==Green Lantern Oath==
In issue #9 of the original Alan Scott &quot;Green Lantern&quot; comic book, scriptwriter Alfred Bester, best known as a major science fiction novelist of the 1950s (and one who had included rhymed couplets in his work) introduced the Green Lantern Oaths:

This oath was revived for the Hal Jordan version of the character. Alan Moore and Geoff Johns introduced variants. Oftentimes &quot;darkest night&quot; is changed to &quot;blackest night&quot;, which inspired the name of the crossover event Blackest Night. In reference to the oath, the sequel to Blackest Night was called Brightest Day.

==In other media==
===Film===

==== Standalone film ====
Hal Jordan made his live-action debut in the 2011 film of the same name, portrayed by Ryan Reynolds. The film originally intended on launching a new DC Comics cinematic franchise with a sequel and an untitled Flash film, but due to the film&#x27;s failure, nothing moved forward.

====DC Extended Universe====

John Stewart was scheduled to appear in Zack Snyder&#x27;s director cut of &quot;Justice League&quot;, portrayed by Wayne T. Carr, but the scene was reworked with Martian Manhunter, portrayed by Harry Lennix, at the request of Warner Bros.

===Television===
In the live-action television series &quot;Stargirl&quot;, Alan Scott&#x27;s power battery is shown in a flashback to when the Injustice Society attacked the Justice Society of America&#x27;s headquarters. JSA member Pat Dugan hid his power battery in his basement. In the second season, Alan Scott&#x27;s daughter Jennie-Lynn Scott finds Alan&#x27;s power battery and activates it. She absorbs the battery&#x27;s energy and breaks it. She then leaves Blue Valley to find her missing brother Todd Rice.

====DC Universe====
A live-action &quot;Green Lantern&quot; television series was announced to be in development at HBO Max set to feature the Alan Scott, Guy Gardner, Jessica Cruz, and Simon Baz versions of Green Lantern along with an original character Bree Jarta with Finn Wittrock and Jeremy Irvine portraying Gardner and Scott respectively. The series will be set in multiple time periods focusing on a separate story for each of the Green Lanterns for that time. In October 2022, it was announced that the series had instead been extensively redeveloped into a solo project centered around John Stewart. In December 2022, sources claimed the series was scrapped, but James Gunn say the series is still in production. The series&#x27; title was revealed to be &quot;Lanterns&quot; in January 2023. The version with Berlanti was confirmed to have been cancelled, with this new series focusing on Stewart and Hal Jordan as part of DC Studios&#x27; new DC Universe. In October 2024, Kyle Chandler and Aaron Pierre were cast as the DCU&#x27;s Jordan and Stewart. The series is set to release in 2026.

==In academic and journalistic jargon==

Some political pundits and academic political scientists use the phrase &quot;Green Lanternism&quot; (or &quot;political Green Lanternism&quot;) to refer to the common tendency to demand perfection or omnipotence from political leaders, and to blame actually unsolvable or inevitable problems on political leaders&#x27; alleged weakness or malice, as if political office-holders&#x27; powers and abilities, like Green Lantern&#x27;s powers and abilities, were limited only by their personal strength of will.

<doc id="73679" wikidata="Q7435497" url="?curid=73679" title="Scotch (adjective)">
<text>Scotch is an adjective in English, meaning &quot;of or from Scotland&quot;. Many Scots dislike the term &quot;Scotch&quot; and some consider it offensive. The modern usage in Scotland is &quot;Scottish&quot; or &quot;Scots&quot;, and the word &quot;Scotch&quot; is now only applied to specific products, mostly food or drink, such as Scotch whisky, Scotch pie and Scotch broth.

The verb &quot;to scotch&quot; is unrelated to the adjective. Middle English &quot;scocchen&quot; derives from Anglo-French &quot;escocher&quot; meaning &quot;to notch, nick or pierce&quot;, from &quot;coche&quot;, &quot;a notch, groove&quot;.

== Usage ==
The adjective or noun &quot;Scotch&quot; is an early modern English (16th century) contraction of the English word &quot;Scottish&quot; which was later adopted into the Scots language It more or less replaced &quot;Scottish&quot; as the prevailing term in England in the 17th century. The English playwright William Shakespeare used the word &quot;Scotch&quot; to describe a jig, but always employed the term &quot;Scottish&quot; when people were the subject. &quot;Scots&quot; (the modern Scots language form of early Scots &quot;Scottis&quot;) predominated in Scotland until the 18th century when anglicisation became fashionable and &quot;Scotch&quot; came to be used in both England and Scotland. A 1788 letter by Robert Burns says in part: &quot;Apropos, is not the Scotch phrase &quot;Auld lang syne&quot; exceedingly expressive? There is an old song and tune which has often thrilled through my soul. You know I am an enthusiast in old Scotch songs.&quot; (&quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; in &quot;The Burns Encyclopedia&quot;, at robertburns.org). Burns wrote of himself in 1787, &quot;The appellation of a Scotch Bard, is by far my highest pride; to continue to deserve it is my most exalted ambition.&quot;

From the early 19th century, however, &quot;Scots&quot; or &quot;Scottish&quot; increasingly became the preferred usages among educated Scottish people, &quot;Scotch&quot; being regarded as an anglicised affectation. By 1908, this was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a &quot;long-established… preference&quot; (see article). In modern usage in Scotland, &quot;Scotch&quot; is rarely used, other than as described in the following paragraph for certain articles; it has gathered patronising and faintly offensive connotations (&quot;frugal with one&#x27;s money&quot;).

In modern current British usage, in England as in Scotland, the general term for things from or pertaining to Scotland is &quot;Scottish&quot;. &quot;Scots&quot; is used for the Scots language and Scots law, although one increasingly hears it used of people and organisations, especially in newspaper articles. &quot;Scotch&quot; remains in use in only a few specific cases. &#x27;Scotch terrier&#x27; was once one of these legacy uses, but has increasingly been replaced with Scottish terrier. Only in Ulster, especially in County Donegal (chiefly in East Donegal and Inishowen) and County Tyrone (especially in rural West Tyrone), is the term &quot;Scotch&quot; still widely used.

Scotland was one of the first countries in the world to introduce compulsory education for all children in 1696, administered in each parish by the Kirk. When the British government eventually chose to centralise and regulate the system in 1872, the Scottish school system was initially placed under a &quot;Scotch Education Department&quot; with offices in London. In 1918, as a result of objections from within Scotland, the department was moved to Edinburgh and renamed the Scottish Education Department. This reflects the linguistic preferences of modern Scotland.

In 1965, the historian A.J.P. Taylor wrote in his &quot;Preface to English History 1914–1945&quot;: &quot;Some inhabitants of Scotland now call themselves &quot;Scots&quot; and their affairs &quot;Scottish&quot;. They are entitled to do so. The English word for both is &quot;Scotch&quot;, just as we call les français the French and Deutschland Germany. Being English, I use it.&quot;

&quot;Scots&quot; is the modern preferred usage in all levels of society in Scotland, but occasional use of &quot;Scotch&quot; in varieties of the Scots language continues with terms such as &quot;Scotch and English&quot; (a game), &quot;Scotch fiddle&quot; (itchiness), &quot;Scotch mile and ell&quot; (measures) and many other examples (see the Scots Dialect Dictionary compiled by Alexander Warrack M.A. (1911) republished by Waverley Books 2000). There are other good indicators that the use of &quot;Scotch&quot; has been &quot;whitewashed out&quot; and become a shibboleth. Early versions of dictionaries produced in Burns&#x27; wake in the 19th century had titles such as &quot;A Dictionary of the Scotch Dialect of the Lowlands&quot; and modern place names now written as &quot;Scots&quot; e.g., Scotstarvit and Scotscalder existed in previous incarnations as &quot;Scotch&quot;. Scotch Corner survives as a place-name in England.

In a reminiscence on his early training as an advocate in Edinburgh, Sir Walter Scott describes the law as &quot;Scotch Law&quot; some four times and as &quot;Scots Law&quot; just once. By the 1840s, other writers were using the phrase &quot;Scots law&quot;, and this usage is now standard (although not universal) world-wide. Scots law reports in the nineteenth century show frequent judicial usage of &#x27;Scotch&#x27; as referring to people; by the turn of that century, and since, practically no examples (other than by English judges) can be discovered.

In 1978, the song &quot;Scotch Machine&quot; by the pan-European group Voyage was released in the UK as &quot;Scots Machine&quot;.

In the 1937 film &quot;Storm in a Teacup&quot;, the Scottish/Scotch debate is a running joke. In one scene, Vicky (Vivien Leigh) is mixing cocktails. She explains to Frank (Rex Harrison) that her father, Provost Gow (Cecil Parker), who is standing for Parliament as a member of the &quot;Caledonia League&quot;, &quot;...wants to be prime minister of the first Scotch parliament.&quot; &quot;Scottish, Vicky, Scottish!&quot; her father pompously corrects her. &quot;Well then, fix yourself a scottish and soda!&quot; she replies, and flounces out of the door. In another scene, one of Gow&#x27;s Caledonia League minions says to him &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen the like in thirty years of Scotch politics!&quot;, with the same stern rebuke from the provost.

In the chorus of his song &quot;I Love a Lassie (My Scotch Bluebell)&quot;, music hall comedian and singer Sir Harry Lauder sings &quot;I love a lassie, a bonny hielan lassie... Mary ma Scotch bluebell.&quot;

All editions of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s 1887 collection of essays &quot;Memories and Portraits&quot; use &quot;Scotch&quot; as both an adjective and noun throughout. 

The first edition of John Kenneth Galbraith&#x27;s &quot;The Scotch&quot; was published in the UK under two alternative titles: as &quot;Made to Last&quot; and &quot;The Non-potable Scotch: A Memoir of the Clansmen in Canada&quot;. It was illustrated by Samuel H. Bryant. Galbraith&#x27;s account of his boyhood environment in Elgin County in southern Ontario was added in 1963. He considered it his finest piece of writing.

<doc id="73681" wikidata="Q2916" url="?curid=73681" title="Osnabrück">
<text>Osnabrück (; ; archaic English: &quot;Osnaburg&quot;) is a city in Lower Saxony in western Germany. It is situated on the river Hase in a valley penned between the Wiehen Hills and the northern tip of the Teutoburg Forest. With a population of 168,145 Osnabrück is the fourth largest city in Lower Saxony. 

More recently Osnabrück has become well known for its industry. Numerous companies in the automobile, paper, steel and grocery sectors are located in the city and its surrounding area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staedtereport_Osnabrueck_okt_2009.pdf (application/pdf-Objekt)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the massive destruction inflicted on the city during World War II, the Altstadt (old town) was eventually reconstructed extensively with designs loyal to the original medieval architecture there. Osnabrück was also the home of the largest British garrison outside the United Kingdom. Osnabrück&#x27;s modern, urban image is enhanced by the presence of more than 22,000 students studying at the University and the University of Applied Sciences. Although part of the state of Lower Saxony, historically, culturally and linguistically Osnabrück is considered part of the region of Westphalia.

==Name==
The origin of the name Osnabrück is disputed. The suffix &quot;-brück&quot; suggests a bridge over or to something (from German &quot;Brücke&quot; = bridge) but the prefix &quot;Osna-&quot; is explained in at least two different ways: the traditional explanation is that today&#x27;s name is a corruption of &quot;Ossenbrügge&quot; (westphalian meaning &quot;oxen bridge&quot;), which is etymologically and historically impossible, because the town is older than this corruption of consonants (documented in 13th century, Osnabrück was founded in 8th century), but others state that it is derived from the name of the &quot;Hase&quot; River which is arguably derived from &quot;Asen&quot; (Æsir), thus giving Osnabrück the meaning &quot;bridge to the gods&quot;, and previously Tacitus named people living near the grey river (Hase) Chasuarii. It may also be noted that Osnabrück is situated on the northern end of the Teutoburg Forest, which until the 19th century was known as the Osning.
The city gave its name to the textile fabric of osnaburg.

==History==

===Medieval===
Osnabrück initially developed as a marketplace next to the bishopric founded by Charlemagne, King of the Franks, in 780. Some time prior to 803, the city became the seat of the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück. Although the precise date is uncertain, it is likely that Osnabrück is the oldest bishopric in Lower Saxony.

In the year 804 Charlemagne was said to have founded the Gymnasium Carolinum in Osnabrück. This would make it the oldest German Gymnasium school, but the charter date is disputed by historians, some of whom believe it could be a forgery.

In 889 the town was given merchant, customs, and coinage privileges by King Arnulf of Carinthia. Osnabrück was first referred to in records as a &quot;city&quot; in 1147. A decade later, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa granted the city fortification privileges (&quot;Befestigungsrecht&quot;). Most of the towers which were part of the original fortifications are still visible in the city. Osnabrück became a member of the Hanseatic League in the 12th century, as well as a member of the Westphalian Federation of Cities.

The history of the town in the later Middle Ages was recorded in a chronicle by Albert Suho, one of Osnabrück&#x27;s most important clerics in the 15th century.

===Early Modern age===
From 1561 to 1639 there was a considerable amount of social unrest and tension in Osnabrück due to the Protestant Reformation, the Thirty Years&#x27; War and also witch hunting. In 1582, during the rule of Mayor Hammacher (1565–1588), 163 women were executed as alleged witches; most of them were burned alive. In total, 276 women were executed, along with 2 men who had been charged with wizardry.

The first Lutheran services were held in Osnabrück in 1543. Over the next century, Lutheranism expanded in the city and several Protestant bishops were elected. However, the Catholic churches continued to operate, and the city never became completely Lutheran. After the Thirty Years&#x27; War broke out, a Catholic bishop was elected in 1623, and the city was occupied by troops of the Catholic League in 1628. The Gymnasium Carolinum was upgraded to a Jesuit university in 1632, but the university was closed a year later when the city was taken by Swedish troops and restored to Protestant control.

Peace negotiations took place in Osnabrück and the nearby city of Münster from 1643 to 1648. The twin Treaties of Osnabrück and Münster, collectively known as the Peace of Westphalia, ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Osnabrück was officially recognized as bi-confessional Catholic and Lutheran. The prince-bishopric would be held alternately by a Catholic bishop and a Lutheran bishop. The Protestant bishop would be selected from the descendants of the Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg, with priority given to the cadets of what became the House of Hanover. From 1667, prince-bishop Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, built the new baroque palace. His son, George I of Great Britain, died in the palace, at the time residence of his younger brother, prince-bishop Ernest Augustus, Duke of York and Albany, on a travel on 11 June 1727.

In the early 18th century, renowned local jurist and social theorist Justus Möser wrote a highly influential constitutional history of the town, the &quot;Osnabrücker Geschichte&quot;. Following the Seven Years&#x27; War, the town&#x27;s population fell below 6,000, however an economic revival linked to the linen and tobacco industries caused it to rise again from the 1780s onwards.

===19th century===
The French Revolutionary Wars brought Prussian troops into the city in 1795, followed by the French in 1803. As a result, the town&#x27;s population was kept below 10,000 for the whole first decade of the 19th century. The Napoleonic period saw possession of the city change hands several times. Control of Osnabrück passed to the Electorate of Hanover in 1803 during the German Mediatisation, and then briefly to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1806. From 1807 to 1810 the city was part of the Kingdom of Westphalia, after which it passed to the First French Empire. After 1815, it became part of the Kingdom of Hanover.

The town&#x27;s first railway line was built in 1855, connecting it with Löhne. Further rail connections appeared over the following decades, connecting Osnabrück with Emden from 1856, Cologne from 1871 and Hamburg from 1874. In 1866, Osnabrück was annexed by Prussia after the Austro-Prussian War and administered as part of the Province of Hanover. Growth of the local economy and population was fuelled by expansion in the engineering and textile industries, with the Hammersen Weaving Mill established in 1869 and the &quot;Osnabrücker Kupfer- und Drahtwerk&quot; metallurgical firm following in 1873. The later 19th century also saw growth in the number of schools and the arrival of electricity and modern sanitation.

===20th century===
By 1914, Osnabrück had over 70,000 inhabitants. The outbreak of the First World War necessitated food rationing; the Allied blockade and a harsh winter in 1917 led to further shortages. Following Germany&#x27;s defeat in 1918, a council made up of workers and soldiers took control during the November Revolution, but were replaced by the new Weimar Republic the following year. Similarly to many other German cities, Osnabrück experienced considerable inflation and unemployment in the 1920s, with over 2,000 out of work by 1923 and nearly 14,000 receiving some form of government assistance by 1928.

Politically, Osnabrück in the 1920s was a stronghold of support for the Social Democrats and the Catholic Centre Party. However, in the Reichstag elections of September 1930, the Nazi Party received the greatest percentage of votes in the city (nearly 28%) – a more than seven-fold increase from their electoral performance in Osnabrück two years prior. During the campaigns prior to the two federal elections in 1932, both Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels made well-attended speeches in the city.

Following the Nazis&#x27; seizure of power in January 1933, Osnabrück was subjected to the implementation of National Socialist economic, political, and social programmes. These resulted in economic growth for ethnic Germans who did not run afoul of the new regime, and the town went from having over 10,000 unemployed in early 1933 to actually having a labour shortage five years later. However, dissenters, supporters of opposition parties and German Jews (who had experienced centuries of discrimination in the city) did not share in this growth and found themselves discriminated against, imprisoned or forced to close their businesses and leave town. During World War II, both Jews and Romani people were deported to concentration camps and extermination camps en masse. In October 1942, a subcamp of the 2nd SS construction brigade (forced labour camp) in Bremen was established in Osnabrück. 86 of the 250 prisoners died of starvation and maltreatment before the subcamp&#x27;s dissolution in May 1943. Osnabrück was also the location of the Oflag VI-C and Oflag 66 prisoner-of-war camps for Serbian, French and Belgian officers.

The war ended for Osnabrück on 4 April 1945, when the XVII Corps of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s Second Army entered the city with little resistance. By this time, the city had been extensively bombed and required major reconstructive programmes following the war&#x27;s end. Leading Nazis fled the city and the British appointed a new mayor, Johannes Petermann. However, during the allied occupation of Germany a British military governor, Colonel Geoffrey Day was placed in charge of administering the city. Relations between the occupiers and the citizens of Osnabrück were generally peaceful, though tensions existed; some minor fights broke out between British soldiers and local youths and some Osnabrückers resented the relationships that developed between the occupiers and local women. Additionally, the British took over more than seventy homes for their own use by the middle of 1946. Amidst shortages, the black market thrived and became one of the main focuses of police activity.

After World War II West Germany realigned its states; Osnabrück became part of the new state of Lower Saxony in 1946. The British continued to maintain Osnabrück Garrison, a garrison near the city, which at one point was the largest British garrison in the world, housing some 4,000 troops and employing around 500 local civilians. It was the target of a PIRA attack in 1996. Due to budget cuts, the troops were withdrawn in 2008 and the property returned to the local government.

After three centuries, the city finally obtained its university when the government of Lower Saxony established the University of Osnabrück in 1974.

===Twinning with Derby===

Previously Osnabrück had made contact with the British authorities as early as 1948, hoping to find an English twin town and therefore achieve greater understanding with their former enemies in the Second World War. This attempt was unsuccessful and Osnabrück did not actively consider the idea again for another quarter-century. The twinning agreement with Derby was signed on 17 February 1976. Every year since then the two cities have exchanged envoys. Derby also has a square named after Osnabrück in honour of the twinning arrangement; this features an obelisk among other things.

<doc id="73682" wikidata="Q918443" url="?curid=73682" title="Geoffrey A. Landis">
<text>Geoffrey Alan Landis (; born May 28, 1955) is an American aerospace engineer and author, working for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on planetary exploration, interstellar propulsion, solar power and photovoltaics. He holds nine patents, primarily in the field of improvements to solar cells and photovoltaic devices and has given presentations and commentary on the possibilities for interstellar travel and construction of bases on the Moon, Mars, and Venus.

Supported by his scientific background Landis also writes hard science fiction.
For these writings he has won a Nebula Award, two Hugo Awards, and a Locus Award, as well as three Rhysling Awards for his poetry. He contributes science articles to various academic publications.

==Biography==
Landis was born in Detroit, Michigan, and lived in Virginia, Maryland, Philadelphia, and Illinois during his childhood. His senior education was at New Trier High School, Winnetka, Illinois. He holds undergraduate degrees in physics and electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He also holds masters degrees in physics and engineering and a PhD in solid-state physics from Brown University. He is married to science fiction writer Mary A. Turzillo and lives in Berea, Ohio.

==Career==
After receiving his doctorate at Brown University, Landis worked at the NASA Lewis Research Center (now NASA Glenn) and the Ohio Aerospace Institute before accepting a permanent position at the NASA John Glenn Research Center, where he does research on Mars missions, solar energy, and technology development for future space missions. He holds nine patents, and has authored or co-authored more than 300 published scientific papers in the fields of astronautics and photovoltaics.

Landis has commented on the practicalities of generating oxygen and creating building materials for a future Moon base in &quot;New Scientist&quot;, and on the possibilities of using readily available metallic iron to manufacture steel on Mars.

He is the recipient of numerous professional honors, including the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics &quot;Aerospace Power Systems Award&quot;, the NASA &quot;Space Flight Awareness award&quot; and the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement &quot;Stellar Award&quot; in 2016.

===Photovoltaic power systems===
Much of Landis&#x27; technical work has been in the field of developing solar cells and arrays, both for terrestrial use and for spacecraft.

===Mars===
Landis has worked on a number of projects related to developing technology of human and robotic exploration of Mars and scientific analysis of the Martian surface, including studies of the performance of photovoltaic cells in the Mars environment, the effect of Martian dust on performance, and technologies for dust removal from the arrays.
He was a member of the Rover team on the Mars Pathfinder mission, and named the Mars rock, &quot;Yogi&quot;. He is a member of the science team on the 2003 Mars Exploration Rovers mission, where his work includes observations of Martian dust devils, atmospheric science measurements, and observation of frost on the equator of Mars. He was also a member of the Mars ISPP Propellant Precursor experiment team for the Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander mission, an experiment package to demonstrate manufacture of oxygen from the Martian atmosphere (which was cancelled after the failure of the Mars Polar Lander).

He has also done work on analyzing concepts for future robotic and human mission to Mars. These include the Mars Geyser Hopper spacecraft, a Discovery-class mission concept that would investigate the springtime carbon dioxide Martian geysers found in regions around the south pole of Mars, the Human Exploration using Real-time Robotic
Operations (&quot;HERRO&quot;) concept for telerobotic Mars exploration, and concepts for use of In-situ resource utilization for a Mars sample-return mission. In a 1993 paper, he suggested the use of a phased program of Mars exploration, with a series of incremental achievements leading up to human landings on Mars.

===NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts===

Landis was a fellow of the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (&quot;NIAC&quot;), where he worked on a project investigating the use of laser- and particle-beam pushed sails for propulsion for interstellar flight. In 2002 Landis addressed the annual convention of the American Association for the Advancement of Science on the possibilities and challenges of interstellar travel in what was described as the &quot;first serious discussion of how mankind will one day set sail to the nearest star&quot;. Dr. Landis said, &quot;This is the first meeting to really consider interstellar travel by humans. It is historic. We&#x27;re going to the stars. There really isn&#x27;t a choice in the long term.&quot; He went on to describe a star ship with a diamond sail, a few nanometres thick, powered by solar energy, which could achieve &quot;10 per cent of the speed of light&quot;.

He was selected again as a NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts fellow in 2012, with feasibility concept of a landsailing rover for Venus exploration, called Venus Landsailing Rover, and in 2015 was the science lead on a NIAC study to design a mission to Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton.

In 2017, Landis&#x27;s work was the subject of the book &quot;Land-Sailing Venus Rover With NASA Inventor Geoffrey Landis&quot;, published by World Book as part of their &quot;Out of This World&quot; book series for ages 10–14+.

===Academic positions===
In 2005–2006, he was named the Ronald E. McNair Visiting Professor of Astronautics at MIT, and won the AIAA Abe M. Zarem Educator Award in 2007.
Landis has also been a faculty member of the International Space University; in 1998 he was on the faculty of the Department of Mining, Manufacturing, and Robotics in the Space Studies Program, and in 1999 he was on the faculty of the 12th Space Studies Program at the Suranaree University of Technology in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand. and co-chair of the student project &quot;Out of the Cradle&quot;. He was also a guest lecturer at the ISU 13th Space Studies Program in Valparaíso, Chile, and the 2015 Space Studies Program in Athens, Ohio.

As a writer, he was an instructor at the Clarion Writers Workshop at Michigan State University in 2001. He was a guest instructor at the Launch Pad workshop for 2012.

==Writing==
===Science fiction===
Landis&#x27; first science fiction story, &quot;Elemental&quot;, appeared in &quot;Analog&quot; in December 1984, and was nominated for the 1985 Hugo Award for Best Novella. as well as earning him a nomination for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer.
In the field of science fiction, Landis has published over 70 works of short fiction, and two books. He won the 1989 Nebula Award for best short story for &quot;Ripples in the Dirac Sea&quot; (&quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot;, October 1988), the 1992 Hugo Award for &quot;A Walk in the Sun&quot; (&quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot;, October 1991), and the 2003 Hugo for his short story &quot;Falling onto Mars&quot; (&quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;, July/Aug 2002).

His first novel, &quot;Mars Crossing&quot;, was published by Tor Books in 2000, winning a Locus Award. A short story collection, &quot;Impact Parameter (and Other Quantum Realities)&quot;, was published by Golden Gryphon Press in 2001 and named as noteworthy by trade magazine &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;. He has also won the &quot;Analog&quot; Analytical Laboratory Award for the novelette &quot;The Man in the Mirror&quot; (2009). His 2010 novella &quot;The Sultan of the Clouds&quot; won the Theodore Sturgeon Award for best short science fiction story, and was nominated for both the Nebula and Hugo awards.

He attended the Clarion Workshop in 1985, with other emerging SF writers such as Kristine Kathryn Rusch, Martha Soukup, William Shunn, Resa Nelson, Mary Turzillo and Robert J. Howe.

===Poetry===
Landis has also published a number of poems, much of it involving science fiction or science themes. He won the Rhysling Award three times, for his poems &quot;Christmas, after we all get time machines&quot; in 2000 (which also won the 2000 &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Reader&#x27;s Award&quot; for best poem), for &quot;Search&quot; in 2009, and for &quot;No One Now Remembers&quot; in 2024. He won the Dwarf Stars Award in 2010, for the poem &quot;Fireflies&quot;. He has won the Asimov&#x27;s Reader&#x27;s award for best poem three times, most recently in 2014, for his poem &quot;Rivers&quot;. In 2009, he won second place in the Hessler Street Fair poetry contest for his poem &quot;Five Pounds of Sunlight&quot;, and first place in 2010 for &quot;Human Potential&quot;.

His poetry collection &quot;Iron Angels&quot; was published in 2009.

<text>Emil Julius Gumbel (18 July 1891, in Munich – 10 September 1966, in New York City) was a German mathematician and political writer.

Gumbel specialised in mathematical statistics and, along with Leonard Tippett and Ronald Fisher, was instrumental in the development of extreme value theory, which has practical applications in many fields, including engineering and finance. In 1958, Gumbel published a key book, &quot;Statistics of Extremes&quot;, in which he derived and analyzed the probability distribution that is now known as the Gumbel distribution in his honor.

In the 1920s and early 1930s, Gumbel was considered unusual and highly controversial in German academic circles for his vocal support of left-wing politics and pacifism, and his opposition to Fascism. His influential writings about the politically motivated Feme murders made the case that the Weimar Republic was corruptly anti-leftist and anti-republican. Gumbel publicly opposed the Nazi Party and, in 1932, he was one of the 33 prominent signers of the &quot;Urgent Call for Unity&quot;.

==Biography==
Born to a prominent Jewish family in Württemberg, Gumbel graduated in mathematics from the University of Munich, completing his doctoral thesis on the topic of population statistics shortly before the outbreak of the First World War. After a short period of military service, he was discharged in 1915 on medical grounds and he joined the University of Berlin to work with the prominent Russian statistician Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz. From this time onwards he became much more politically active. He joined the Independent Social Democrat Party in 1917, and became a prominent member of the pacifist New Fatherland League which was later renamed the German League for Human Rights. In January 1918, Gumbel took up a position with the electronics company Telefunken, researching sound transmitter waves, and he continued his political activities with the support of one of the firm&#x27;s founders, Georg Count von Arco, a prominent member of the human rights movement. In 1922, Gumbel became Professor of Mathematical Statistics at the University of Heidelberg, where he soon found that combining academic work with politics was much more controversial, resulting in protests by students and faculty members, who were mostly right-wing, and strong criticism in the right-wing press.

Among the Nazis&#x27; most-hated public intellectuals, Gumbel was forced out of his position in Heidelberg in 1932. He then moved to France, where he taught at the École libre des hautes études in Paris, and in Lyon, as well as continuing his political activities and helping other refugees, until the German invasion of 1940. He then left Europe for the United States, where he taught at the New School for Social Research and Columbia University in New York City until his death in 1966.

When he died of lung cancer in 1966, Gumbel&#x27;s papers were made a part of &quot;The Emil J. Gumbel Collection, Political Papers of an Anti-Nazi Scholar in Weimar and Exile&quot;. These papers include reels of microfilm that document his activities against the Nazis.

==Influences==
Emil Gumbel was strongly influenced from a young age by his uncle, Abraham Gumbel (1852-1930) with whom he had long conversations about political and social issues. The death of Abraham&#x27;s son (Emil&#x27;s cousin) in the First World War, is thought to have been a triggering factor in both Abraham and Emil&#x27;s life-long commitment to pacifism.

During his time at the University of Munich (1910-1914), Gumbel was taught mathematics, economics and the social sciences by eminent scholars known to have liberal political views, including Alfred Pringsheim and Lujo Brentano. He also studied actuarial science and gained insurance qualifications and work experience (including a summer job with a London insurance company), before completing his doctorate dissertation under the supervision of extraordinary professor of statistics Friedrich Böhm in July 1914.

At the University of Berlin (1915-1922), Gumbel became closely associated with Georg Friedrich Nicolai, whose pacifist book, &quot;The Biology of War&quot;, was banned by the German Government. He also became acquainted with Albert Einstein, who was one of the founding members of the German League for Human Rights. Einstein was subsequently a strong supporter of Gumbel&#x27;s professional career. Gumbel developed a deep professional bond with the prominent Russian statistician and economist Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, who considered Gumbel to be &quot;a gifted man [with an] uncommonly active mind&quot;. His recommendation strongly influenced Gumbel&#x27;s subsequent appointment to professor of mathematics at the University of Heidelberg in 1922.

After the 1919 murder of prominent USPD member, Karl Liebknecht, who Gumbel greatly admired, there was strong criticism by journalist Kurt Tucholsky that the trial judge completely ignored evidence against the Nazi Brownshirts. Horrified, Gumbel ardently investigated many similar political murders that had occurred and published his findings in numerous publications and books, including &quot;Two Years of Murder&quot; in 1921, followed by &quot;Four Years of Political Murder&quot; in 1922, the deeply controversial &quot;Conspirators&quot; in 1924, &quot;The Armor of War of the Imperialistic States&quot; in 1928, which dealt with the causes of political murder, and &quot;Traitors fall victim to the Feme&quot; in 1929.

Gumbel was an admirer of the British intellectual and pacifist Bertrand Russell, though they never met. He translated some of Russell&#x27;s work into German.

==Family==
In 1930 Gumbel married Marieluise Czettritz, who he first met at the DLM offices in the mid-1920s. She had two sons from her previous marriage, and retained custody of the youngest, Harald. She died of cancer in 1952.

<text>María Cristina Estela Marcela Jurado García (16 January 1924 – 5 July 2002), known professionally as Katy Jurado ( , ), was a Mexican actress.

She acted in popular Western films of the 1950s and 1960s. Her talent for playing a variety of characters helped pave the way for Mexican actresses in American cinema. She was the first Latin American actress nominated for an Oscar, as Best Supporting Actress for her work in &quot;Broken Lance&quot; (1954), and was the first to win a Golden Globe Award, for her performance in &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952).

== Life and career ==

=== 1924–1943: Childhood and Early years ===
María Cristina Estela Marcela Jurado García, known from early childhood as &quot;Katy&quot;, was born on 16 January 1924, in Mexico City Mexico, the daughter of Luis Jurado Ochoa, a lawyer, and Vicenta García, a singer. Jurado&#x27;s younger brothers were Luis Raúl and Óscar Sergio.
Her mother was a singer who worked for the Mexican radio station XEW (the oldest radio station in Latin America). Her mother was sister of Mexican musician Belisario de Jesús García, author of popular Mexican songs such as &quot;Las Cuatro Milpas&quot;. Jurado&#x27;s cousin Emilio Portes Gil was President of Mexico (1928–1930).

Jurado lived her first years and studied at a school run by nuns in the Guadalupe Inn neighborhood of Mexico City. She later studied to be a bilingual secretary. She wanted to study law and become a lawyer. Her singular beauty drew attention since she was a teenager, and she was invited to work as an actress by producers and filmmakers, among them Emilio Fernández (one of the most prominent Mexican filmmakers at that time) who offered her a role in his first movie &quot;The Isle of Passion&quot; (1941). Although her godfather was Mexican actor Pedro Armendáriz, her parents never gave their consent.

Another filmmaker interested in her was Mauricio de la Serna who offered her a role in the film &quot;No matarás&quot; (1943). She signed the contract without authorization from her parents, and when they found out, they threatened to send her to a boarding school in Monterrey. Around this time, she met the aspiring actor Víctor Velázquez and married him soon afterward. Her marriage was largely motivated by the desire to continue a career as an actress and to escape the yoke of her parents. Velazquez was the father of her children, Victor Hugo and Sandra. The marriage ended in 1943, shortly after Jurado began her film career.

=== 1943-1951: First Mexican films ===

Jurado debuted as an actress in the Mexican film &quot;No matarás&quot; (1943). From that moment on, her acting talent, but above all her exotic beauty and sensual appeal, gave her the opportunity to work in numerous films. She specialized in playing wicked and seductive women. Jurado said:

She appeared in 16 more films over the next seven years in what film historians have named the Golden Age of Mexican cinema. She acted with acclaimed Mexican film stars such as Pedro Infante, Sara Montiel, Pedro Armendáriz and others. In 1953, she starred in Luis Buñuel&#x27;s film &quot;El Bruto&quot;, for which she received an Ariel Award for Best Supporting Actress, Mexico&#x27;s equivalent of an Academy Award.

=== 1951–1968: Success in Hollywood ===
In addition to acting, Jurado worked as a movie columnist, radio reporter, and bullfight critic to support her family. She was on assignment when filmmaker Budd Boetticher and actor John Wayne spotted her at a bullfight. Neither knew she was an actress. However, Boetticher, who was also a professional bullfighter, cast Jurado in his 1951 film &quot;Bullfighter and the Lady&quot;, opposite Gilbert Roland, as the wife of an aging matador. She was not interested in working in American films but accepted because the film would be shot in Mexico. She had rudimentary English language skills and memorized and delivered her lines phonetically. Despite this limitation, her strong performance brought her to the attention of Hollywood producer Stanley Kramer, who cast her in the classic Western &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952), starring Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly. Jurado learned to speak English for the role, studying and taking classes two hours per day for two months. She played saloon owner Helen Ramírez, former love of reluctant hero Cooper&#x27;s Will Kane. She earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and gained notice in the American movie industry.
From the success of the film, Jurado began working on numerous American films, most of them in the Western genre. In 1953, she had a role in &quot;San Antone&quot;, directed by Joseph Kane and opposite Rod Cameron. In the same year, she had a role in &quot;Arrowhead&quot; with Charlton Heston and Jack Palance, playing an evil Comanche woman, the love interest of Heston&#x27;s character.

In 1954, actress Dolores del Río was accused of being a communist sympathizer at the height of the McCarthy era, and the U.S. government refused permission for her to work in the film &quot;Broken Lance&quot;, directed by Edward Dmytryk and where she was going to interpret Spencer Tracy&#x27;s Comanche wife. Jurado was selected for the role despite the resistance of the studio because of her youth. After viewing footage of her scenes, studio executives were impressed. Her performance garnered an Academy Award nomination. Jurado was the first Latin American actress to compete for the Oscar.

In the same year, Jurado appeared with Kirk Douglas in the Henry Hathaway film &quot;The Racers&quot;. In 1955, Jurado filmed &quot;Trial&quot;, directed by Mark Robson, with Glenn Ford. It was a drama about a Mexican boy accused of raping a white girl, with Jurado playing the mother of the accused. For this role, she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. In the same year, she traveled to Italy for the filming of &quot;Trapeze&quot;, directed by Carol Reed, with Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis. On set, Jurado had severe friction with the film&#x27;s other female star, actress Gina Lollobrigida.

Despite the fact that she always stated that acting in the theater did not please her, in 1956, Jurado debuted on Broadway in the play &quot;The Best House in Naples&quot; (1956), by Eduardo de Filippo.

In 1956, she participated in the film &quot;Man from Del Rio&quot; (1956), opposite Anthony Quinn, one of the few Hollywood movies to have Mexican actors as main stars. Later she acted in Westerns &quot;Dragoon Wells Massacre&quot; (1957) with Barry Sullivan, and &quot;The Badlanders&quot; (1958), with Alan Ladd and Ernest Borgnine. In 1957, she debuted on television with a guest appearance in an episode of &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;. In 1959, she acted for the first time under Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s direction in an episode of &quot;The Rifleman&quot;. In 1962 she appeared as the historical character La Tules in an episode of &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;.

In 1959, Marlon Brando, with whom Jurado maintained a close friendship, invited her to participate in &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot;, his first film as director. After marrying Ernest Borgnine, they founded their own production company called Sanvio Corp. The couple traveled to Italy where they partnered with the producer Dino de Laurentiis in &quot;Barabbas&quot; (where both acted with Anthony Quinn) and &quot;I briganti Italiani&quot;, directed by Mario Camerini.

In 1961, Jurado returned to Mexico and filmed &quot;La Bandida&quot; (1963) where she shared credits with Pedro Armendáriz and the temperamental Mexican actress María Félix, with whom Jurado had friction on the set. Her stormy marriage with Borgnine ended in 1963. Depressed, Jurado returned to Mexico and established her residence in the city of Cuernavaca; however, she decided to alternate her work with films between Mexico and the United States.
In 1965, Jurado returned to Hollywood for the film &quot;Smoky&quot;, directed by George Sherman, starring Fess Parker. In 1966, she played the mother of George Maharis&#x27;s character in &quot;A Covenant with Death&quot;. In 1968, she appeared in the film &quot;Stay Away, Joe&quot; in the role of the half-Apache stepmother of Elvis Presley&#x27;s character.

=== 1970–2002: Later years ===
In the next years, Jurado alternated her work between Hollywood and Mexico. In 1970, she filmed &quot;The Bridge in the Jungle&quot; opposite John Huston. In 1973, she appeared in &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot;, directed by Sam Peckinpah.

Jurado received one of her better dramatic roles in the third of the three short stories comprising the Mexican film &quot;Fé, Esperanza y Caridad&quot; (1973). Directed by Jorge Fons, Jurado was cast as a lower-class woman who suffers a series of bureaucratic abuses as she tries to claim the remains of her dead husband. For this performance, she won the Ariel Award for Best Actress, her second Silver Ariel Award of the Mexican Cinema. In the same year, Jurado starred on Broadway again in the Tennessee Williams play &quot;The Red Devil Battery Sign&quot; with Anthony Quinn and Claire Bloom.

In 1974, Jurado appeared in the American film &quot;Once Upon a Scoundrel&quot; (1974) opposite the comedian Zero Mostel. In 1975, she participated in the Mexican film &quot;Los albañiles&quot;, again directed by Jorge Fons. The film was awarded the Golden Bear of the Berlinale 1975. In 1976, she played the role of Chuchupe in the film &quot;Pantaleón y Las Visitadoras&quot;, an adaptation of the novel &quot;Captain Pantoja and the Special Service&quot; by Mario Vargas Llosa, who also directed the film. However, the filming of this movie turned into a disaster due to the differences between Jurado and Vargas Llosa. Vargas Llosa fired Jurado from the film, and she sued him legally.

In 1978, she played a small role in the film &quot;The Children of Sanchez&quot;, where she shares credits with Anthony Quinn and Dolores del Río. In 1980, Jurado filmed &quot;La Seducción&quot;, directed by Arturo Ripstein, for which she was nominated for another Ariel Award for Best Actress.

In 1981, her son Victor Hugo died tragically in an accident on a highway near Monterrey while she was filming a movie in Mexico City. This tragedy plunged her into a deep depression that she could never overcome and led her to abandon her acting career for a few years. In 1984, John Huston convinced her to resume her career as an actress. She acted in Huston&#x27;s film &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;. In the same year, she co-starred in the short-lived television series &quot;a.k.a. Pablo&quot;, a sitcom with Paul Rodriguez.

In the 1990s, Jurado appeared in two Mexican telenovelas. In 1998, she completed a Spanish-language film for director Arturo Ripstein titled &quot;El Evangelio de las Maravillas&quot;. She won her second Ariel Award for Best Supporting Actress for this role.

Jurado had a cameo in the film &quot;The Hi-Lo Country&quot; (1998) by Stephen Frears, who called her his &quot;lucky charm&quot; for his first Western.

In 2002, she made her final film appearance in &quot;Un secreto de Esperanza&quot;. The film was released posthumously.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriages ===

Katy Jurado was married twice. Her first husband was the Mexican actor Victor Velázquez (who was the stepfather of the popular Mexican actresses Tere and Lorena Velázquez). Her marriage was largely motivated by the desire to continue a career as an actress and to escape the yoke of her parents. Velazquez was the father of her children, a boy and a girl. The marriage ended in 1943, shortly after Jurado began her film career.

Her second husband was the American actor Ernest Borgnine. Jurado and Borginine met when he was filming in Mexico &quot;Vera Cruz&quot; (1954). Jurado affirms that from that moment Borgnine did not stop pursuing her. They got married on December 31 1959. Jurado declared that her five years of courtship with Borgnine were the happiest of her life, but everything got complicated when they got married due to his uncontrollable jealousy. The temperament of both led to numerous violent confrontations, some of which were documented by the newspapers of the time. Jurado claimed to have suffered physical violence from Borgnine during their marriage. Jurado and Borgnine divorced in 1963. After their divorce, Jurado fell into a severe depression that led her to think about suicide. It was for this reason that she decided to leave Hollywood and settle for the rest of her life in the city of Cuernavaca, in Mexico.

=== Other relationships ===

Early in her career in Hollywood, Jurado had affairs with film maker Budd Boetticher and actor Tyrone Power but her most famous relationship is the one she had with Marlon Brando. Brando was smitten with Jurado after seeing her in &quot;High Noon&quot;. They met when Brando was in Mexico filming &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; (1952). He was involved at the time with Movita Castaneda, and was having a parallel relationship with Rita Moreno. Brando told Joseph L. Mankiewicz that he was attracted to &quot;her enigmatic eyes, black as hell, pointing at you like fiery arrows&quot;. Jurado commented:

However, their first date became the beginning of an extended affair that lasted intermittently many years. In her maturity, Jurado affirmed that they maintained a &quot;loving friendship,&quot; and that both even performed an Indian ritual in which they collected blood from their wrists.

Jurado also had a romantic relationship with the Western novelist Louis L&#x27;Amour. She said: &quot;I have love letters that he wrote me until the last day of his life. But we never match. Now I think I should have married that man.&quot; Jurado claimed to have been one of the people to find the body of Mexican actress Miroslava Stern after her suicide in 1955. According to Jurado, the picture that Stern had between her hands was of the Mexican comedian Cantinflas, but artistic manager Fanny Schatz exchanged the photo for one of the Spanish bullfighter Luis Miguel Dominguín.

=== Family ===
In 1981, her son died tragically in an accident on a highway near Monterrey. Jurado was filming a movie when she found out about the accident and professionally wrapped up the shoot after burying her son. This tragedy plunged her into a deep depression that she could never overcome and led her to abandon her acting career for a few years and also to take refuge in alcohol. She later said

Jurado claimed that it was the film maker John Huston who rescued her from depression and convinced her to resume her career in the movie &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;. Jurado also claimed that, during the filming of the film, Huston confessed to having been in love with her.

== Death ==
Toward the end of her life, Jurado suffered from heart and lung ailments. She died of kidney failure and pulmonary disease on 5 July 2002 at the age of 78 at her home in Cuernavaca, Mexico. She was buried in Cuernavaca at the Panteón de la Paz cemetery.

== Legacy ==
Jurado has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7065 Hollywood Boulevard for her contributions to motion pictures.

In 1953, Jurado was captured in a portrait by Mexican artist Diego Rivera.

In 1992, she was honored with the Golden Boot Award for her notable contribution to the Western genre.

In 1998, Mexican singer-songwriter, Juan Gabriel, composed a song for her titled, &quot;Que rechula es Katy (What a beauty is Katy)&quot;.

She was honored with a Google Doodle on 16 January 2018.

<text>Larisa Semyonovna Latynina (, née Diriy, Дирий; born 27 December 1934) is a Russian former artistic gymnast. Between 1956 and 1964 she won 14 individual Olympic medals and four team medals for the Soviet Union. She holds the record for the most Olympic gold medals by a female gymnast with nine. Her total of 18 Olympic medals was a record for 48 years. She held the record for individual event medals for over 52 years, winning 14. She is credited with helping to establish the Soviet Union as a dominant force in gymnastics.

==Early life==
She was born as Larisa Semyonovna Diriy in Kherson, Ukrainian SSR. Her father, Semyon Andreyevich Diriy, left the family when she was 11 months old, and she was raised by her illiterate mother, who worked as a cleaner during the day, and as a watchman during the night. Her father was killed at the Battle of Stalingrad, where he served as a machine gun operator. Young Diriy-Latynina survived the occupation of Ukraine by the Nazi Germany in 1940s.

She first practiced ballet, but turned to gymnastics after her choreographer moved out of Kherson. Her first gymnastics coach was Mykhailo Sotnychenko. In 1950 young Diriy-Latynina received her first sports degree (rozriad) and became a member of the Ukrainian students team at the All-Union gymnastics&#x27; competitions in Kazan. She graduated from high school in 1953 with a gold medal, and moved to Kyiv. She attended the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (KPI), and continued her training at the Burevestnik VSS under coaching of Oleksandr Mishakov. Her first notable success came at the 4th World Festival of Youth and Students in Bucharest where she won gold medals. At the age of 19, she debuted internationally at the 1954 Rome World Championships, winning the gold medal in the team competition. Following the second semester, Latynina switched to the Institute of Physical culture from KPI.

== Gymnastics career ==

In 1956, at the age of 21, Latynina made her Olympic debut at the Melbourne Olympic Games. In the all-around event, she fought off stiff competition to win gold. She finished first in the vault, second in the uneven bars and in the exercise on the floor and fourth in the balancing beam. She also led the Soviet Union to victory in the Team Event. Her first Olympic gold medal Latynina gifted to her first coach Sotnychenko who kept it until his death. Later the wife of Sotnychenko returned the medal to Latynina. Also, following her success in Australia, she was awarded with the high sports title of the Merited Master of Sports of the USSR. Latynina won all gold medals at the 1957 European championship in gymnastics. For all her sports achievements in 1957 she was honored with the Order of Lenin. Around that time, she with her first husband Ivan Latynin from Leningrad who also studied in Kyiv. She graduated from the Institute with honors.

After a very successful World Championships in 1958 (winning five out of six titles despite competing whilst four months pregnant and medaling in every event), Latynina was the favorite for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. In the all-around event, she led the Soviet Union to take the first four places, thereby also securing a win in the team competition by a margin of nine points. Latynina defended her floor title, took silver medals in the balance beam and uneven bars events, and bronze in the vault competition.

Latynina won all-around titles at the 1962 World Championships, beating Věra Čáslavská of Czechoslovakia. Still the defending World Champion at the 1964 Summer Olympics, she was beaten by Čáslavská in the all-around competition. Latynina added two more gold medals to her tally, winning the team event and the floor event both for the third time in a row. A silver medal and two bronzes in the other apparatus events brought her total of Olympic medals to eighteen—nine gold medals, five silver, and four bronze. She won a medal in every event in which she competed, except for the 1956 balance beam where she came in fourth.

Latynina&#x27;s nine gold medals make her tied for second on the list of most Olympic gold medalists. She held the distinction of having more Olympic medals (either individually or with a team) than anybody, from 1964 until 2012. She and American swimmer Katie Ledecky are the only women to have won nine gold medals. She is also the only female athlete who at some point has held the record for most Olympic gold medals. Additionally, within the sport of gymnastics, she is the only woman who has won an all-around medal in more than two Olympiads, the only woman who has won an individual event (floor exercise) in more than two Olympiads, and one of only three women who have won every individual event at either the World Championship or Olympic level. She is the first female gymnast to have twice won team gold, all-around gold, and an event final gold at the same Olympics, having done so in 1956 and four years later, in 1960.

==Family==
She was born to Pelageya Anisimovna Barabamyuk (1902–1975) and Semyon Andreevich Diriy (1906–1943), who died in the Battle of Stalingrad. Larisa was married three times. Her current husband is Yuri Izrailovich Feldman (b. 1938), a member of the Russian Academy of Electrotechnical Sciences and a former competitive cyclist. Her daughter from a former marriage, Tatyana Ivanovna Latynina (b. 1958), is a folk dancer. She was born only five months after her mother won a world all-around title, and seven months after her birth Latynina competed at the national championships. Latynina kept her pregnancy a secret, even from her coach. She also had a son.

==Retirement==
Latynina announced her retirement after the 1966 World Championships and became a coach for the Soviet national gymnastics team, a position she held until 1977. Under her coaching the Soviet women team won gold in the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics. She organized the gymnastics competition at the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow.

She holds Russian citizenship and lives in Moscow. Latynina has received numerous Soviet and Russian state accolades.

In 2023, she spoke out against Russian athletes competing under a neutral flag at the Olympics due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, calling it &quot;unpatriotic&quot;.

<text>Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft (; 16 March 158121 May 1647) - Knight in the Order of Saint Michael - was a Dutch historian, poet and playwright who lived during the Dutch Golden Age in literature.

==Life==

Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft, often abbreviated to &quot;P.C. Hooft&quot; (), was born in Amsterdam as scion of the patrician Hooft family and son of burgomaster (mayor) Cornelis Hooft. He was also uncle to statesmen and burgomasters Cornelis and Andries de Graeff.

In 1598, in preparation for his career as a merchant, his father sent him to France and Italy, but Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft was more interested in art and was deeply impressed by the Italian Renaissance.

In 1609, he was appointed bailiff of Muiden and the Gooiland. He founded the Muiderkring, a literary society located at his home, the &quot;Muiderslot&quot;, the castle of Muiden, in which he got to live due to his appointment as sheriff of Muiden. Among the members were the poets and playwrights Constantijn Huygens, Maria Tesselschade, G.A. Bredero and Joost van den Vondel, as well as the Portuguese singer Francisca Duarte. Hooft, Bredero, and Vondel were also founders of the First Nederduytsche Academy.

==Work==
Hooft was a prolific writer of plays, poems and letters, but from 1618 onwards he concentrated on writing a history of the Netherlands (&quot;Nederduytsche Historiën&quot;), inspired by Roman historian Tacitus. His focus was primarily on the Eighty Years&#x27; War between the Netherlands and Spain and though he tried to be as impartial as possible, he did succeed.

As a poet, he was influenced by his Renaissance contemporaries in France and Italy.

===Plays===

* &quot;Geeraerdt van Velsen&quot; ( 1613)
* &quot;Achilles en Polyxena&quot; (1614)
* &quot;Theseus en Ariane&quot; (1614)
* &quot;Granida&quot; (1615)
* &quot;Warenar&quot; (1616)
* &quot;Baeto, oft oorsprong der Holanderen&quot; (1626)

===Poems===
* &quot;Emblemata amatoria: afbeeldingen van minne&quot; (1611)

===History===
* &quot;Nederduytsche Historiën&quot; (1642-1656)

==Present-day legacy==
In present-day Amsterdam, Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft gives his name to P.C. Hooftstraat, the city&#x27;s main destination for expensive designer clothes shopping. The south-western end of P. C. Hooftstraat runs into the city&#x27;s main park, the Vondelpark, named for his friend Joost van den Vondel (see Life above). In many other Dutch cities, there are other streets named after Hooft, many of them also called P. C. Hooftstraat or Pieter C. Hooftstraat.

In 1947, 300 years after P.C. Hooft died in The Hague, a literary prize in his name was instituted by the Dutch government. An independent foundation annually awards the prize. Initially it was awarded for specific works, but in recent years it is awarded based on the entire collection of a writer.

<doc id="73757" wikidata="Q229503" url="?curid=73757" title="Věra Čáslavská">
<text>Věra Čáslavská (; 3 May 1942 – 30 August 2016) was a Czechoslovak artistic gymnast and Czech sports official. She won a total of 22 international titles between 1959 and 1968 including seven Olympic gold medals, four world titles and eleven European championships. Čáslavská is the most decorated Czech gymnast in history and is one of only three female gymnasts, along with the Soviet Larisa Latynina and American Simone Biles, to win the all-around gold medal at two Olympics. She remains the only gymnast, male or female, to have won an Olympic gold medal in each individual event. She was also the first gymnast to achieve a perfect 10 at a major competition in the post-1952 era. She held the record for the most individual gold medals (with 7) among all female athletes (not only gymnasts) in Olympic history as well until it was surpassed by swimmer Katie Ledecky in 2024 after 56 years.

In addition to her gymnastics success, Čáslavská was known for her outspoken support of the Czechoslovak democratization movement and her opposition to the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, she took this protest to the world stage by quietly looking down and away while the Soviet national anthem was played during the medal ceremonies for the balance beam and floor exercise event finals. While Čáslavská&#x27;s actions were applauded by her compatriots, they resulted in her becoming a &quot;persona non grata&quot; in the new regime. She was forced into retirement and for many years was denied the right to travel, work and attend sporting events.

Čáslavská&#x27;s situation improved in the 1980s after the intervention of members of the International Olympic Committee, and following the Velvet Revolution her status got better significantly. During the 1990s she held several positions of honor, including a term as president of the Czech Olympic Committee.

==Gymnastics career==

Born in Prague and originally a figure skater, Čáslavská debuted internationally in 1958 at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, winning a silver medal in the team event. Her first international title came the following year at the European Women&#x27;s Artistic Gymnastics Championships where she won gold on the vault and silver on the balance beam. She first participated in the 1960 Summer Olympic Games, winning a silver medal with the Czechoslovak team, and then won bronze in the all around event at the 1961 European Championships. She fought for the all-around title at home in the 1962 World Championships, held off only by Larisa Latynina, and managed to win her first world title, in the vault. She did not compete at the 1963 European Championships in Paris.

Between 1964 and 1968, Čáslavská won 19 individual gold medals in major international competitions. In this period she remained undefeated in the all-around in major international competition. She is the only female gymnast ever to win every Olympic, World Championships and European Championships all-around title from one Olympiad to the next one. She was at her peak at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, winning the overall title and taking gold medals in the balance beam and the vault, in addition to another silver medal in the team event. At the 1966 World Championships, Čáslavská defended her vault title, winning a team gold – breaking the Soviet monopoly in that event – and became all-around world champion. Čáslavská dominated the 1965 and 1967 European Championships, taking all five individual titles and scoring two perfect scores of 10 in 1967. She is the only gymnast who has swept all five European individual golds twice.

Prior to the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Čáslavská lost her training facility due to the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. Instead, she used potato sacks as weights and logs as beams whilst training in the forests of Hrubý Jeseník mountains in northern Moravia. She was again dominant at the 1968 Summer Olympics, winning medals in all six events. She defended her all-around title and won additional gold medals on the floor, uneven bars and vault, as well as two silvers, for the team competition and balance beam. She won the 1968 Olympic all-around title with the highest recorded score up to that time. Her win by 1.4 points has remained the largest margin of victory in Olympics, World, World Cup, or European Championships for women in an all-around competition for 48 years. It was finally surpassed in 2016, ten years after a major rule change (the 2006 implementation of open ended scoring). As of the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, she and Larisa Latynina are the only gymnasts to win the gold medal in individual all-around in consecutive Olympic games. She is also one of only two female gymnasts to defend gold medal in the vault apparatus. Her use of the &quot;Jarabe tapatío&quot; as the music for her floor routine and her subsequent marriage in the city made her immensely popular with the Mexican crowd.

===Protest at the 1968 Olympics===
Čáslavská&#x27;s wins at the 1968 Olympics were particularly poignant because of the political turmoil in Czechoslovakia. She had publicly voiced her strong opposition to Soviet-style Communism and the Soviet invasion, and had signed Ludvik Vaculík&#x27;s protest manifesto &quot;Two Thousand Words&quot; in the spring of 1968. Consequently, to avoid being arrested, she left the training facility in the town of Šumperk with the help of Zdeněk Zerzáň, chief of Jeseníky Mountain Rescue Service. She spent the weeks leading up to the Olympics hiding in a remote mountain hut at Vřesová studánka, and was only granted permission to travel to Mexico City at the last minute.

At the Olympics, where she once again faced Soviet opposition, Čáslavská continued to subtly voice her views. After she appeared to have won the gold medal on floor outright, the judging panel curiously upgraded the preliminary scores of Soviet Larisa Petrik, and declared a tie for the gold instead. All of this occurred on the heels of another very controversial judging decision that cost Čáslavská the gold on beam, instead awarding the title to her Soviet rival Natalia Kuchinskaya. Clearly disheartened and angered by the politics that favored the USSR, she protested during both medal ceremonies by quietly turning her head down and away during the playing of the Soviet national anthem.

==Later career==
Čáslavská was revered by Czech people for her brave demonstration on the world&#x27;s biggest stage, and she was awarded Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Sportsperson of the Year award in 1968 (for the fourth and final time). Her federation, however, was none too pleased. For her consistent support of the Czechoslovak democratization movement (the Prague Spring) in 1968, and during the purges which followed the Soviet-led invasion in August 1968, she was deprived of the right to travel abroad and participate in public sport events both in Czechoslovakia and abroad. Čáslavská was effectively forced into retirement, and was considered a &quot;persona non grata&quot; for many years in her home country.

Czechoslovak authorities refused to publish her autobiography, and insisted that it be heavily censored when it was released in Japan. She was granted leave to work as a coach in Mexico, but reportedly only when the Mexican government threatened to cease oil exports to Czechoslovakia. After return from Mexico in the beginning of 1980s she shared an office with Emil Zátopek where the two former sport stars and present-day outcasts were given meaningless administrative roles. In the late 1980s, following pressure from Juan Antonio Samaranch, the then president of the International Olympic Committee, who had presented her with the Olympic Order, Čáslavská was finally allowed to work as a gymnastics coach and judge in her home country.

After the Velvet Revolution in November 1989 brought an end to communist government in Czechoslovakia, Čáslavská&#x27;s status improved dramatically. She became President Havel&#x27;s adviser on sports and social matters and Honorary President of the Czech-Japan Association. Later, after leaving the President&#x27;s Office, she was elected President of the Czech Olympic Committee. In 1995, she was appointed to the IOC membership committee.

==Eponymous skill==
Čáslavská has one eponymous skill listed in the Code of Points.

==Honours==
Čáslavská received numerous accolades for her contributions to the sport of gymnastics. In addition to the Olympic Order, she was awarded a 1989 Pierre de Coubertin International Fair Play Trophy by UNESCO and was noted at the ceremony for her &quot;exemplary dignity&quot;. In 1995, she was honored with the Czech Republic&#x27;s Medal of Merit. She was inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1991 and the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2010, she was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, 3rd class. She was also presented a 17th-century katana and a ceremonial kimono from the Japanese emperor.

In 2014, she was the joint recipient (with AP journalist Iva Drapalova) of the Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award, awarded annually by the Prague Society for International Cooperation and Global Panel Foundation, for outstanding civic courage.

An inner main belt asteroid (26986) Caslavska is named for her.

==Personal life and death==
Shortly before the end of the 1968 Olympics, Čáslavská married runner Josef Odložil, who had been a silver medalist at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo. The ceremony, which took place at the Mexico City Cathedral, drew a crowd of thousands. They had a daughter, Radka, and a son, Martin. The couple divorced in 1987. In 1993, her son and ex-husband were involved in an altercation with Martin allegedly punching Josef; he fell to the floor and struck his head, leading to his death after 35 days. Čáslavská became severely depressed and apathetic and was rarely seen in public afterwards. For a while she was treated at a psychiatric hospital where she even underwent electroshock treatment, before moved into nursing home. Čáslavská eventually overcame her depression (which she had been fighting for about 15 years), cancel all medication and returned to both social and sports lives, coaching younger gymnasts. After many years of seclusion, when she was barely seen except by her closest friends and family, she had seemed to be regaining her appetite for life. She was describing her new-found energy as “miraculous” and had recovered enough &quot;joie de vivre&quot; to delight Mexican spectators, as a guest at a gymnastics event in Acapulco, by demonstrating spontaneously that at 70 she could still do the splits.

Čáslavská was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015. Her health deteriorated significantly in the summer of 2016, to such an extent that she was taken to a hospital in Prague on 30 August, where she died at the age of 74.

<text>William Shunn (born August 14, 1967) is an American science fiction writer and computer programmer. He was raised in a Latter-day Saint household, the oldest of eight children. In 1986, he served a mission to Canada for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but was arrested for making a false bomb threat, for the purpose of preventing his fellow missionary from returning home.

==Life and career==
Shunn received a B.S. in computer science at the University of Utah in 1991. He went to work for WordPerfect Corporation and was part of the team that developed WordPerfect 6.0 for MS-DOS. In 1995, he moved from Utah to New York City. He left the LDS Church at the same time and created one of the earliest ex-Mormon web sites.

Shunn&#x27;s first professional short story was published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; in 1993. He has been nominated once for the Hugo Award and twice for the Nebula Award.

Shunn is the author of a 2015 memoir, &quot;The Accidental Terrorist: Confessions of a Reluctant Missionary&quot;.

In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, he created what may have been the first online survivor registry.

Shunn is also known for creating a web site that offers daily hints to &quot;The New York Times&quot; Spelling Bee. This tool is commonly used within the community of Spelling Bee players.

==Awards and nominations==
* 2001: Nominated for Nebula Award for Best Novelette for &quot;Dance of the Yellow-Breasted Luddites&quot; (&quot;Vanishing Acts,&quot; ed. Ellen Datlow, Tor Books, New York, NY, 2000)

** &quot;The Practical Ramifications of Interstellar Packet Loss&quot; (1998)
** &quot;Dance of the Yellow-Breasted Luddites&quot; (2000)
** &quot;Inclination&quot; (2006)

In 1993 or 1994, Shunn wrote a style guide for standard manuscript format (the generally accepted method for preparing a fiction manuscript for submission to professional markets), based on advice gathered at the Clarion Workshop and elsewhere. First published to the web in 1995, this guide (and its later revisions), commonly known as &quot;Shunn format&quot;, has since been adopted by many magazines including Clarkesworld, Analog, and Interzone as a requirement for submissions.

<text>The Clarion Workshop is an American six-week workshop for aspiring science fiction and fantasy writers. Originally an outgrowth of Damon Knight&#x27;s and Kate Wilhelm&#x27;s Milford Writer&#x27;s Conference, held at their home in Milford, Pennsylvania, it was founded in 1968 by Robin Scott Wilson at Clarion State College in Pennsylvania. Knight and Wilhelm were among the first teachers at the workshop.

In 1972, the workshop moved to Michigan State University. It moved again, in 2006, to the University of California, San Diego.

In 2015, the Clarion Foundation received an anonymous gift of $100,000 to found an endowment funding the workshop.

The Clarion Workshop events for 2020 and 2021 were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the students selected for 2020 slated to attend in 2022.
== Other Clarion Workshops ==
Independently operated workshops which share the Clarion name and follow its founding principles include:
* Clarion West Writers Workshop, founded in Seattle, Washington in 1971 by Vonda N. McIntyre. It has been held annually since 1984.
* Clarion South Writers Workshop was held at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia. It was founded in 2004 and ran biennially to 2011. In 2009, Clarion South lost its venue, although the workshop was held that year. In March 2011, Clarion South organizers announced that future workshops were &quot;on hold indefinitely&quot;.

<doc id="73788" wikidata="Q611993" url="?curid=73788" title="Green Arrow">
<text>Green Arrow is a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Mort Weisinger and designed by George Papp, he first appeared in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; No. 73 on September 19, 1941 (cover dated November 1941), the same issue that debuted Aquaman. His real name is Oliver Jonas Queen, a wealthy businessman, owner of Queen Industries, and a well-known celebrity in Star City. He uses this position to hide the fact that he is Green Arrow. Partly inspired by Robin Hood, Green Arrow is an archer who uses his skills to fight crime in his home cities of Star City and Seattle, as well as alongside his fellow superheroes as a member of the Justice League. The world&#x27;s greatest archer, as well as a competent swordsman and martial artist, Green Arrow deploys a range of trick arrows (in contemporary times, they are referred as &quot;specialty arrows&quot;) with various special functions, such as glue, explosive-tipped, grappling hook, flash grenade, tear gas, and even kryptonite arrows for use in a range of special situations.

Green Arrow enjoyed moderate success in his early years, becoming the cover feature of &quot;More Fun&quot;, as well as having occasional appearances in other comics. Throughout his first twenty-five years, however, the character never enjoyed greater popularity. In the late 1960s, writer Denny O&#x27;Neil, inspired by the character&#x27;s dramatic visual redesign by Neal Adams, chose to have him lose his fortune, giving him the then-unique role of a streetwise crusader for the working class and the disadvantaged. In 1970, he was paired with a more law and order-oriented hero, Green Lantern, in a ground-breaking, socially conscious comic book series. Since then, he has been popular among comic book fans and most writers have taken an urban, gritty approach to the character. Oliver Queen was killed off in the 1990s and replaced by a new character, Oliver&#x27;s son Connor Hawke. Connor, however, proved a less popular character, and the original Oliver Queen character was resurrected in the 2001 &quot;Quiver&quot; storyline, by writer Kevin Smith. In the 2000s, the character has been featured in bigger storylines focusing on Green Arrow and Black Canary, such as the DC event &quot;The Green Arrow/Black Canary Wedding&quot; and the high-profile &quot;Justice League: Cry for Justice&quot; storyline, prior to the character&#x27;s relaunch alongside most of DC&#x27;s properties in 2011.

Green Arrow was not initially a well-known character outside of comic book fandom: He had appeared in a single episode of the animated series &quot;Super Friends&quot; in 1973. In the 2000s, the character appeared in a number of DC television properties, including the animated series &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, &quot;Young Justice&quot;, &quot;The Batman&quot; and &quot;&quot;, and several DC Universe Animated Original Movies. In live action, he appeared in the series &quot;Smallville&quot;, played by actor Justin Hartley, and became a core cast member. In 2012, the live action series &quot;Arrow&quot; debuted on The CW, in which the title character was portrayed by Stephen Amell, and launching several spin-off series, becoming the starting point for a shared television franchise called the Arrowverse.

==Publication history==

===Beginnings, 1941–1968===
Green Arrow and Speedy first appeared in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; No. 73 (cover-dated November 1941), which was illustrated by artist George Papp. When Mort Weisinger was creating the character, aside from the obvious allusions to Robin Hood, he took inspiration from a movie serial, &quot;The Green Archer&quot;, based on the novel by Edgar Wallace. He retooled the concept into a superhero archer with obvious Batman influences. These include Green Arrow&#x27;s sidekick Speedy, his use of an Arrowcar and Arrow-Plane for transportation, his use of an Arrow-Cave as his headquarters, his alter ego as a wealthy playboy, the use of an Arrow-Signal to summon him, as well as a clown-like arch foe named Bull&#x27;s Eye, similar to Batman&#x27;s arch-foe, the Joker. His and Speedy&#x27;s first origin stories were told in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; No. 89.
Green Arrow began as a back-up feature in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot;, but within four months the Green Arrow and Speedy replaced Doctor Fate and the Spectre as the cover feature. In &quot;Superhero Comics of the Golden Age&quot;, Mike Benton writes that &quot;their front cover star status was probably due to Speedy&#x27;s appeal – teenage sidekicks were the current rage.&quot; They were also given a spot as one of five back-up features to be promoted in one of the earliest team-up books, &quot;Leading Comics&quot;, starting with issue No. 1 (Winter 1941). They appeared in &quot;More Fun&quot; until issue No. 107 (January 1946), and then moved to &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; from No. 103 (April 1946) to No. 269 (February 1960). Green Arrow and Speedy also appeared in various issues of &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; until issue No. 140 (March 1964).

He was one of the few DC characters to keep going after the Golden Age of Comic Books. His longevity was due to the influence of creator Mort Weisinger, who kept him as a backup feature to the headlining Superboy, first in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; and then &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;; since Superman-related titles were all but guaranteed success during this period, Green Arrow endured the 1940s and 1950s relatively unchanged, outlasting most of his Golden Age contemporaries. As a result, he avoided being revived and &quot;re-imagined&quot; for the Silver Age, as the Flash, Green Lantern, and others were.

Aside from sharing &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; with him, issue No. 258 featured an encounter between a younger Oliver Queen and Superboy. The Green Arrow and Speedy feature during this period included a short run in 1958 written by Dick and Dave Wood and drawn by Jack Kirby. For much of this period, Green Arrow&#x27;s adventures were written by France Herron, who was the character&#x27;s primary scripter 1947–1963.

===Neal Adams and Dennis O&#x27;Neil, 1969–1983===
In 1969, artist Neal Adams updated the character&#x27;s visual appearance by giving him a Van Dyke beard and costume of his own design in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; No. 85 (August–September 1969). Writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil followed up on Green Arrow&#x27;s new appearance by completely remaking the character&#x27;s attitude in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #75 (cover-dated November 1969), having Oliver Queen lose his fortune and become an outspoken advocate of the underprivileged and the political left wing. The story also turned teammate Black Canary into a love interest for Queen.
In the early 1970s, Green Arrow became a co-feature with Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) in an acclaimed series of stories by O&#x27;Neil and Adams that dealt with various social and political issues. The two co-stars served to represent contrasting socio-political viewpoints: Green Arrow spoke for radical change while Green Lantern was an establishment liberal figure, wanting to work within existing institutions of government and law. Queen convinces Jordan to see beyond his strict obedience to the Green Lantern Corps, to help those who were neglected or discriminated against. O&#x27;Neil explained: &quot;He would be a hot-tempered anarchist to contrast with the cerebral, sedate model citizen who was Green Lantern.&quot; The duo embark on a quest in a beat-up pickup truck to &quot;find America&quot;, along the way witnessing the problems of corruption, racism, pollution, as well as overpopulation confronting the nation. One story (in issues #78-79) was even widely interpreted as an allegory for the Manson Family cult murders, though O&#x27;Neil has emphasized that the story was about the authoritarian left and not Manson.

In &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 2) #85–86, it was revealed that Green Arrow&#x27;s ward, Speedy, was addicted to heroin. Speedy overcame his addiction with the help of the Black Canary. This story prompted a massive public reaction, including a congratulatory letter from the mayor of New York, John Lindsay. However, &quot;Green Lantern&quot; sales had been in a major decline at the time Green Arrow was brought on as co-star, and the O&#x27;Neil/Adams stories failed to revive them. &quot;Green Lantern&quot; was canceled with issue No. 89 (April/May 1972), and the climactic story arc of the Green Lantern/Green Arrow series was published as a back-up feature in &quot;The Flash&quot; No. 217 through No. 219. In sharp contrast to the socially-relevant tales which preceded it, this story centered on emotional themes, with Green Arrow struggling to deal with the guilt of having killed a man. Afterwards Green Arrow appeared in solo stories run as backups in &quot;Action Comics&quot;, starting with No. 421. Elliot S. Maggin, who had made his comics debut with a Green Arrow story published in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 2) No. 87, was Green Arrow&#x27;s writer for the next several years.

In 1976, the &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot; title was re-launched, without the socially conscious themes of the original series, with O&#x27;Neil writing and Mike Grell drawing. After the title moved to solo Green Lantern stories, solo Green Arrow stories appeared in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot;. In his solo series, Oliver landed a job as a newspaper columnist, which allowed him to articulate his political beliefs in a more public field. In &quot;World&#x27;s Finest&quot; No. 255 (1979), Queen unsuccessfully ran for Mayor of Star City.

In May through August 1983, Green Arrow appeared for the first time in his own comic book, a four issue limited series. This miniseries introduced a running rivalry between Green Arrow and the supervillain Count Vertigo.

In 1985, the Earth-Two Green Arrow died in the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, still wearing red boots and gloves. The Golden Age Earth-2 character had been retconned as a time-lost member of the original Seven Soldiers of Victory superhero team, recovered by the Justice League and Justice Society. After the Crisis, the Earth-Two Green Arrow and Speedy were retconned out of existence altogether, given the end of DC&#x27;s former multiverse.

===Mike Grell&#x27;s reinterpretation===
In 1987, DC Comics launched the character into a new ongoing title as part of their mature audience comic line. Written and illustrated by Mike Grell, the revamp was launched with &quot;Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters&quot; mini-series. In this three-issue prestige format limited series, a routine adventure against a group of drug runners led to tragedy as the Black Canary was captured and brutally tortured. In response, Oliver murdered his girlfriend&#x27;s attackers. The mini-series also introduced the enigmatic female Japanese archer, Shado, whose family had suffered in a World War II internment camp. Shado later raped Oliver and became pregnant by him, producing a son named Robert after his father.

Under Grell, Green Arrow abandoned the use of his trademark gadget arrows and relocated from Star City to Seattle, Washington. As the series was part of DC Comics&#x27; mature audience line, it took on a more gritty, violent, as well as urban tone, with Green Arrow often using deadly force against his enemies. Grell wrote the series for the first 80 issues, downplaying the super-hero aspects of the characters: Oliver abandoned his mask and was never actually referred to as &quot;Green Arrow&quot; and Black Canary was never shown using her sonic scream power (sometimes, this was explained as having lost it due to the events of &quot;The Longbow Hunters&quot;, though this was not consistent with her appearances in other titles published during this period). While crossover specials were conceived to allow other writers (most notably Denny O&#x27;Neil, who wrote &quot;Batman&quot; and the mature audience comic &quot;The Question&quot;) to use Green Arrow, Grell wrote him as largely isolated from the rest of the DC Universe; when other DC characters like longtime friend Hal Jordan (also known as Green Lantern) appeared, they did so in street clothes and used only their civilian names.

In place of the superhero community, Grell created his own supporting cast. In addition to Shado, Grell introduced Seattle police Lieutenant Jim Cameron, who was disgusted with Green Arrow&#x27;s vigilante actions (including killing criminals), renegade CIA agent Greg Osborne, who began to monitor Queen&#x27;s activities, as well as mercenary Eddie Fyers, initially introduced as Queen&#x27;s adversary, but later to become a companion of necessity when Green Arrow was forced to leave Seattle after false accusations of aiding terrorists. Grell&#x27;s run ended with &quot;Green Arrow&quot; vol. 2 No. 80, shortly after Dinah dumped Oliver.

During this period, the writer also redefined the character&#x27;s origin in the four-part 1992 limited series, &quot;Green Arrow: The Wonder Year&quot;. Grell portrayed Oliver Queen as a thrill-seeker who inherits his family business at a very young age. Changed by his sojourn on the island, Oliver decided to take up crime fighting as a means of rebelling against his responsibilities. During his first adventure in Star City, Oliver meets an old flame, Brianna Stone, a former college radical who warns him if he continued to carry his bow, he would one day have to use it for real. Grell&#x27;s limited series also established Queen&#x27;s attraction toward dangerous women.

===Post-Grell and character&#x27;s temporary death===
Once Grell left the series, DC almost immediately began restoring Green Arrow to the mainstream DC Universe. His ongoing series (mostly written by Kelley Puckett and drawn by artist Jim Aparo) was removed from the &quot;Mature Audience&quot; line (which had evolved into &quot;Vertigo&quot;) with No. 63, prior to Grell&#x27;s departure and Green Arrow began appearing in various super-hero titles as a guest: most notably &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 3) #47, which had Oliver aiding Green Lantern in rescuing his longtime girlfriend Carol Ferris and her family from one of Hal&#x27;s enemies, as well as the 1994 DC Comics mini-series &quot;Zero Hour&quot;. In &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, where Hal Jordan seeks to remake the universe after the trauma of Coast City&#x27;s destruction drives him to destroy the Green Lantern Corps to gain the power to remake the universe, Queen is forced to shoot his old friend at a pivotal moment. Now tightly integrated in the DC Universe, the character Connor Hawke was introduced and revealed as Oliver Queen&#x27;s son from a previous relationship.

In &quot;Green Arrow&quot; (vol. 2) #100–101, Queen infiltrated a group of eco-terrorists known as the Eden Corps and sacrificed his life to prevent the group from detonating a bomb that would destroy the city of Metropolis. Superman attempted to intervene, but ultimately did not after Queen rebuked him for suggesting that Queen allow him to sever the arm attached to the bomb. The exchange between Queen and Superman pays tribute to Frank Miller&#x27;s 1986 work &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. Queen later admits in the &quot;Quiver&quot; storyline (where he is resurrected) that he refused due to both his own issues at this point in his life and the more practical issue that he would be useless as an archer with one arm. Queen&#x27;s death allowed the writers to shake up the status quo by making Connor Hawke a replacement Green Arrow. The series, now written by Chuck Dixon, would continue with Hawke as the main focus until issue No. 137, when the series was canceled.

===Smith, Hester and Parks/Meltzer 2000–2004===
Queen is revived in 2000&#x27;s, &quot;Green Arrow&quot; (vol. 3) as part of the &quot;Quiver&quot; story arc, written by Kevin Smith and illustrated by Phil Hester and Ande Parks. It is revealed that Hal&#x27;s resurrection of Oliver (seen on the last page of &quot;Green Arrow&quot; (vol. 2) No. 137, the final issue of the Oliver/Connor ongoing series) was in reality a deliberately flawed one. In Hal&#x27;s final hours before sacrificing his life to save the Earth during &quot;The Final Night&quot;, Hal speaks with Oliver&#x27;s soul in the afterlife. The two agree to bring back &quot;a&quot; version of Oliver Queen: one without a soul (so Oliver may properly stay in Heaven) and with no memory of the events of &quot;The Longbow Hunters&quot; mini-series or of the subsequent events that followed, up until his death, Oliver reasoning that things went wrong for him after the events that drove him to kill for the first time and feeling that the copy of him was restored at the best point in his life.

For some years, this resurrected Oliver lives in Star City as a vigilante hero, completely under the radar of his other superhero friends, but eventually he is discovered and learns the truth of his resurrection, leaving the resurrected Oliver feeling uncertain about his state now that he knows he has no soul. His resurrection is eventually used by the grandfather of Stanley Dover in an attempt to gain power over the monster that Dover accidentally bound to his grandson, Dover intending to take Oliver&#x27;s body- possible only due to his lack of a soul- and use his access to the JLA&#x27;s resources to find the monster. At the climax of the story, Oliver&#x27;s soul returns from heaven, re-inhabits his resurrected earthly form and helps his son Connor Hawke fight a horde of demons, the body of Oliver having made contact with his soul and convincing him to return to save their son. Dover is defeated and actually consumed by the Beast, who then leaves of his own accord. Oliver also finds himself independently wealthy again, as Dover had transferred all his financial assets to Oliver in anticipation of taking over his body. He also picked up a new sidekick, Mia Dearden, who would become the new Speedy, under Oliver&#x27;s tutelage.

After the resurrection storyline, Smith wrote a second and shorter arc involving a super-powered serial killer, calling himself Onomatopoeia, who sought to claim Connor as his latest victim. Smith then left the title and Brad Meltzer took over as writer.

Meltzer&#x27;s single storyline for &quot;Green Arrow&quot; featured Oliver and his former sidekick, Roy Harper, reuniting and going on a cross-country road trip to pick up old possessions of Oliver&#x27;s, most notably a spare Green Lantern power ring entrusted to him by Hal Jordan many years earlier. The story also revealed that Oliver knew all along that Connor was his son and was even present at his birth, but that Oliver ultimately abandoned Connor and his mother, because of his fear of the responsibilities of fatherhood. Meltzer&#x27;s storyline would continue into the mini-series &quot;Green Lantern: Rebirth&quot;, which featured Oliver&#x27;s attempts to use the ring against Sinestro- presumed dead for several years- before the ring is reclaimed by the reborn Hal Jordan.

Meltzer went on to write the mini-series &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, which heavily featured Green Arrow as one of the story&#x27;s main characters, investigating the murder of Sue Dibny – the wife of the Elongated Man – and revealing that the League had been involved in mind-wiping various villains in the past to conceal their secret identities.

During this time, the character also appeared in a number of other titles, such as the &quot;Justice League&quot;, when he is temporarily brought into a &#x27;reserve League&#x27; created by Batman after the original League is nearly killed by the powerful Gamemnae, and &quot;Justice League Elite&quot;, where Oliver joins a &#x27;black ops&#x27; super-team as the team&#x27;s tactical consultant. His time in the Elite is notable for showing a brief affair with Dawn, the wife of the team&#x27;s magical expert, Manitou Raven.

===Judd Winick, 2004–2008===
Judd Winick took over as &quot;Green Arrow&quot;&#x27;s writer and made many changes. Mia Dearden, the new Speedy, was revealed to be HIV positive and attempts were made to expand Green Arrow&#x27;s Rogues Gallery with Merlyn the archer, Constantine Drakon, as well as Danny Brickwell (the Brick) joining the cast of existing Green Arrow villains such as the illusion-casting Count Vertigo and the enigmatic Onomatopoeia, the latter of whom, himself, was a relatively recent addition. Other DC villains, such as the Riddler, made guest appearances throughout his run.

2006 saw the title (along with other DC comics titles) jump &quot;One Year Later&quot; after the events in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. Oliver, having once again amassed a large personal fortune, is the newly elected mayor of Star City, continuing his fight for justice both on the streets and within the political system. He also has a new costume, which appears to be a combination of the classic Neal Adams costume and the Mike Grell &quot;Longbow Hunters&quot; costume. In flashbacks, it is revealed that Oliver survived a near-fatal attack during the events of the Infinite Crisis, as well as used his recuperation time to retrain. He works with several expert instructors including a sensei known as Natas, who also trained Deathstroke, and becomes proficient in several martial arts including the use of swords, which he makes use of on occasion during this time, and proves that he and his family are now formidable combatants when battling Deathstroke and later Batman&#x27;s rogue protégé Jason Todd. He is eventually forced to resign from his position as mayor after a scandal where he learns that he had been secretly funding the Outsiders, essentially a bounty hunter team at this point in their history, coupled with his uncertain position with the voting public, having never had much more than 50% of the city on his side at a time. Queen is convinced to resign his position in exchange for his successor leaving the various social aid organisations and resources he had established alone, although Ollie was able to beat his opponent by resigning prior to the election and putting someone he trusted in charge of the city. The series concluded with Oliver proposing to Dinah (Black Canary).

In 2007, Andy Diggle and Jock&#x27;s &quot;Green Arrow: Year One&quot; presented the newest official version of his origin. Using concepts from previous iterations, Oliver Queen is a rich, thrill-seeking activist who is attacked, thrown overboard and washes up on an island where he learns of a smuggling operation. Upon witnessing the inhabitants&#x27; slave-like living conditions, he begins to take down the smugglers&#x27; operation. He eventually returns to civilization changed by his experiences. In the final part of the story, Oliver claims that a mutiny or the actions of a group of heroin dealers could be used as a cover story for what transpired, referencing the original Green Arrow origin story, as well as Mike Grell&#x27;s version.

===Green Arrow/Black Canary===

After the end of the ongoing series, DC Comics published a four-part bi-monthly Black Canary miniseries in which Green Arrow teamed up with Black Canary to help get Sin into school and establish a new life. This series concluded with the Black Canary accepting his proposal. This resulted in DC Comics publishing three interconnected specials revolving around the Green Arrow/Black Canary wedding that tied into that month&#x27;s &quot;Countdown&quot; stories. These were &quot;The Black Canary Wedding Planner&quot;, &quot;JLA Wedding Special&quot;, as well as &quot;The Green Arrow/Black Canary Wedding Special&quot;. The wedding special worked as a lead-in for a new &quot;Green Arrow/Black Canary&quot; series. At the conclusion of the wedding special, the Black Canary is forced to kill Green Arrow after he appears to go mad and attacks her.

The new ongoing series picked up on this, quickly revealing that Green Arrow was alive (the dead Green Arrow being an impostor) and being held hostage by &quot;Athena&quot;. The Black Canary, Connor and Mia launch a rescue mission to save Green Arrow. As the team is united and on their way to safety, Connor is struck by a bullet meant for Oliver and is left in a vegetative state. While Connor rests, Oliver and Dinah go out and are officially married, since they had never actually been married in the &quot;Wedding Special&quot;, but they come home to find Connor has been kidnapped.

This storyline led directly into the second arc that followed the rescue of Connor from a mysterious foe. Connor is eventually found, now having recovered thanks to manipulation by Doctor Sivana. With issue No. 15, Andrew Kreisberg took over as the series writer.

===&quot;Blackest Night&quot;===
Oliver is transformed into a Black Lantern Corps member and attacks his former allies, notably his son, wife and sidekick. During the battle, Connor says he never really forgave his father, while Oliver&#x27;s internal monologue reveals his thoughts, which express concerns for his &quot;family&quot; and disgust at his actions. The team manage to disable Oliver by freezing him with liquid nitrogen.

===&quot;Cry for Justice&quot; and &quot;Rise and Fall&quot;===
In the &quot;Cry for Justice&quot; miniseries, JLA foe Prometheus destroys Star City, as part of a grand scheme to &quot;hurt&quot; the Justice League community of heroes. During the episode, the identity of the Green Arrow was nearly revealed by an old friend, Moreno. After tricking the Justice League into releasing him, Green Arrow tracks Prometheus to his hidden lair and kills him with a single arrow right between the eyes.

This murder, committed in secret, is what Oliver considers justice for the bombings (which also cost the life of Lian Harper, Roy Harper&#x27;s (Red Arrow) daughter, who was killed in the bombing of Star City) and this immediately leads into the &quot;Rise and Fall&quot; storyline, in which Oliver obsessively hunts other super-villains allied with Prometheus during the recent events, including Prometheus&#x27;s former allies who were involved in the bombing. When his JLA comrades learn of this plot, they confront Green Arrow and he realizes he has crossed a line and turns himself in: Black Canary returns her wedding ring and declares their marriage over. The &quot;Green Arrow/Black Canary&quot; series ends during this story arc, as well as in the pages of &quot;Justice League: Rise and Fall Special&quot;; Oliver is tried, but found not guilty as most of the jury sympathise with his motives. He is exiled from Star City&#x27;s remains as a result, choosing to live in the mysterious forest which has grown at its centre.

===&quot;Brightest Day&quot;===
Following the events of &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Deadman was brought to the ruins of Star City by his white ring. Powered by the entity of life on Earth, the ring created a vast green forest, that instantly grew in the presence of the white light, in much of what remained of Star City.

Unbeknownst to the populace of Star City, Green Arrow returns and lives within the new forest, trying his best to protect a city still reeling from the death and destruction of Prometheus&#x27;s attacks. With the law breaking down and numerous public figures being murdered, a new owner of Queen Industries, the result of a hostile takeover, arrives to enforce peace and rebuild the city. This self-proclaimed &#x27;Queen&#x27; has a connection to Green Arrow&#x27;s father and claims to be upholding the Queen family legacy where Oliver failed.

===The New 52===

In 2011, DC chose to relaunch its titles with new No. 1 issues and a refreshed continuity and called this initiative The New 52. &quot;Green Arrow&quot; was one of 52 titles included in this. In the post-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; continuity, Oliver Queen is Green Arrow and he balances his own breaking of laws with his efforts to bring outlaws to justice across the globe. In the new continuity, Queen runs Q-Core, a communications technology company that is part of Queen Industries, through which he funds and armors himself as Green Arrow. He makes scarce allusion to his former partnership with Roy Harper, but Roy&#x27;s memories in &quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws&quot; establish that the pair fell out badly, leading Oliver to expel him from Q-Core, as well as prompting Roy&#x27;s own downward spiral. He is based once again in Seattle and supported in his vigilante activities by a small team of close friends who are tech geniuses. In addition, his romantic history with the Black Canary, his friendship with Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), and his being a father (to both Connor Hawke and Shado&#x27;s son Robert Queen II) did not take place as the result of the reboot.

The New 52 series was originally written by J.T. Krul, who was later replaced by Keith Giffen and Dan Jurgens, who were in turn replaced by Ann Nocenti. None of these writers&#x27; runs were well received by critics or fans. Beginning with issue 17, the series received a new creative team in writer Jeff Lemire and artist Andrea Sorrentino, who brought more positive reception to the book. Lemire&#x27;s story introduces new mysteries concerning Oliver&#x27;s original time on the island where he was shipwrecked, as well as a central mythology concerning the ancient Arrow Clan and several other weapon-themed analogues to the Arrow, known as the Outsiders. New antagonists include Komodo, who Oliver learns was his father&#x27;s archer apprentice and apparent murderer. It has also seen the New 52 debut of several characters, such as Count Vertigo, Shado, the Clock King, Richard Dragon, as well as John Diggle, a character originally created for the TV series &quot;Arrow&quot;.

When Oliver meets Shado, he learns she had a daughter from Oliver&#x27;s father (Robert Queen) named Emiko, whom Komodo has raised as his own daughter. When Oliver returns to the island as part of his investigation into the Outsiders, and in search of a relic known as &#x27;the green arrow&#x27;, he discovers that his father had survived to the present, and disguised as one of Oliver&#x27;s torturers on the island, he manipulated Oliver&#x27;s time there, culminating in Oliver&#x27;s transformation into the warrior he is today and the hero known as Green Arrow. Disgusted at this revelation, and taking the arrow relic with him, Oliver leaves Shado and his father behind, stranded on the island, before returning to America to take down the Outsiders. Shado and Robert followed Oliver to Prague, and Emiko turned against Komodo after learning the truth of her parentage. Robert was killed by Komodo in an attempt to save his daughter, and Komodo was later killed himself by Emiko.

From 2013, DC also chose to include Green Arrow as a headlining character in its &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (vol. 3) series, which runs alongside &quot;Justice League&quot; (vol. 2) and &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;. In this book, Queen is part of a crack state-sponsored team assembled by Amanda Waller and Steve Trevor of A.R.G.U.S. to bring in good PR for the US government and serve as a defense against the independent Justice League headed by Superman and Batman should they ever go rogue. Following the cancellation of &quot;JLA&quot; at the conclusion of the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline, Green Arrow appears in its replacement series, &quot;Justice League United&quot;, also written by Lemire.

Lemire and Sorrentino left &quot;Green Arrow&quot; after issue No. 34, to be replaced by writers Andrew Kreisberg and Ben Sokolowski, and artist Daniel Sampere. Kreisberg was the executive producer of &quot;Arrow&quot;, and Sokolowski served as a writer for the show. Kreisberg and Sokolowski&#x27;s first issue featured The New 52 debuts of Felicity Smoak and Mia Dearden. Kreisberg&#x27;s run saw him face off against the influential magnate John King, who is Mia&#x27;s father, and his hired gun, Merlyn. At a moment of desperation given King&#x27;s infinite resources and litany of loyal subjects, Felicity and Diggle recruit some of Green Arrow&#x27;s allies and old enemies to help in the fight: Batman, Arsenal, Emiko, Katana, Onyx, Cupid and even Lex Luthor, at that time a Justice League member.

Following DC&#x27;s &quot;Convergence&quot; storyline in April–May 2015, the title again received a new creative team in writer Ben Percy and artist Patrick Zircher, whose run was more influenced by the horror genre. Elements from &quot;Arrow&quot; were removed, and characters created by Lemire, such as Emiko and Henry Fyff, were restored to major roles. Percy&#x27;s first arc depicts Green Arrow confronting a racist serial killer using drone-like security technology in Seattle to systematically target criminals and potential criminals based on computer profiling and police data.

===DC Rebirth===

In 2016, DC relaunched its entire line of titles once again with the DC Rebirth event, this time intending to restore elements from the DC Universe prior to &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, while also maintaining the continuity of the New 52. Ben Percy remained the principal writer for the series, with a rotating art team consisting of Otto Schmidt, Juan Ferreyra and Stephen Byrne. During this run, Green Arrow is seemingly betrayed by Emiko as Percy reintroduces Shado, echoing elements from the Grell run, as well as John Diggle. In addition to restoring Green Arrow&#x27;s trademark Van Dyke beard, the series revisited a romance between Green Arrow and Black Canary for the first time since 2011. Percy also reestablished Green Arrow as a politically conscious figure, with the writer describing him as a &quot;social justice warrior&quot;. After it was revealed that Emiko was still on Oliver&#x27;s side, she eventually adopted the codename of &quot;Red Arrow&quot;.

This volume finished in March 2019, with issue No. 50 serving as an extra sized final issue.

=== Dawn of DC ===
In November 2022, it was announced that Joshua Williamson would write a new Green Arrow series following Oliver&#x27;s disappearance at the end of &quot;Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, with Sean Izaakse illustrating and launching in April 2023. On April 25, the day of the first issue&#x27;s release, it was announced that the initial six-issue miniseries would become a twelve-issue maxiseries.

Oliver eventually reunites with Connor Hawke, Roy Harper, Black Canary, Red Canary, and Liam Harper after defeating Merlyn. Oliver has seemingly worked with Amanda Waller and starts arresting his family. During his work with Waller, he digs up a box that seemingly makes him regain his memory. It is revealed that Martian Manhunter realized Amanda Waller&#x27;s plans to make the world hate metahumans, so he agreed to create a telepathic implant which will make Ollie fully believe in Waller&#x27;s goals. Oliver helps disable the Amazon bots and the heroes regain their powers. In the aftermath, Oliver explains he had to do it because the Justice League disbanded so quickly when the Titans were not ready for future loose ends. He then further states that if they all had been more communicative as they did in the past, the events of Absolute Power would never had happened. Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman begrudgingly agree with Oliver&#x27;s reasonings and tell Oliver that they are bringing back the Justice League.

==Supporting characters==
As with other DC superheroes, Green Arrow has an extensive supporting cast of characters, sometimes called Team Arrow, along with a unique rogues gallery of villains. His supporting cast has changed wildly over the course of the series, but has tended to include his sidekick Speedy (Roy Harper and Mia Dearden) and his fellow superhero and main romantic interest, Black Canary. His son Connor Hawke has also been a part of the Arrow vigilante family, along with Black Canary&#x27;s adopted daughter Sin. For a brief time, Green Arrow was also &quot;assisted&quot; by the aspiring superhero Miss Arrowette, with whom he had a brief affair. The New 52 reboot of Green Arrow has also introduced a number of new supporting characters for Oliver, including ex-Queen Industries technology experts Naomi Singh and Henry Fyff, and his archer half-sister Emiko Queen who later takes up the code-name &quot;Red Arrow&quot;. The characters of Felicity Smoak and John Diggle from the &quot;Arrow&quot; TV series were also adapted into the comic books in 2015 (though Felicity was later removed from the continuity). The archer Shado, though not part of Oliver&#x27;s unit of heroes, has also been a recurring character in Oliver&#x27;s life. Additionally, Green Arrow has been regularly paired with his fellow superhero Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) in comics, as the two co-starred in the series &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot; together for many years. The &quot;Arrow&quot; version of Team Arrow include Roy Harper/Arsenal, Sara Lance/White Canary, Thea Queen/Speedy, Laurel Lance/Black Canary, Curtis Holt/Mister Terrific, Rene Ramirez/Wild Dog, Rory Regan/Ragman, Evelyn Sharp/Artemis and Dinah Drake/Black Canary.

As a Justice League member, Green Arrow will also appear in crossovers with stories featuring other DC flagship characters from time to time. Of his Justice League colleagues, classic stories depict Ollie as having an ongoing feud with Hawkman owing to their differing outlooks on life, and more recently, he has been depicted as a good friend of his Justice League United colleague Animal Man. Green Arrow has also been a member of the Outsiders, both in its incarnation as a covert superhero team led by Batman and in its New 52 form as a secret society based around various weapon clans, including an Arrow Clan which Oliver is the rightful head of. In the Golden Age of Comic Books, Green Arrow and Speedy were also affiliated with the superhero group the Seven Soldiers of Victory.

===Enemies===
Recurring Green Arrow villains of course include his archenemies Merlyn, a master archer, and Count Vertigo, a foreign dignitary with the power to disrupt his enemy&#x27;s balance and perception. Other recurring villains have included China White, Clock King, Cupid, Brick, and Constantine Drakon. Since the 2000s, the longstanding DC supervillain Deathstroke has often been depicted as having a particular grudge against Green Arrow.

==Other versions==
===Amalgam Comics===
Two versions of Green Arrow exist in the &quot;Amalgam universe&quot;:
* Oliver Queen aka Goliath is an amalgamation of Green Arrow and the Marvel Comics character Erik Josten\Goliath.
* Clinton Archer as Hawkeye, an amalgam of Green Arrow and Clint Barton.

=== Earth-Two ===

For many years, DC Comics wrote stories in what it called a Multiverse, or a series of infinite parallel Earths. This allowed DC writers to freely retcon and retell stories, as well as explain continuity mistakes. The Green Arrow of the 1940s, like all Golden Age characters at that time, resided on Earth-Two and was a member of the Seven Soldiers of Victory and All-Star Squadron along with his sidekick Speedy. Despite having a different origin than the modern Green Arrow, the Golden Age character&#x27;s development largely parallels the modern one&#x27;s.

During DC&#x27;s landmark event &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Green Arrow is now in his 60s and is among the superheroes summoned by Monitor. He assists Changeling of Earth-One and Mento of Earth-One in fighting Shaggy Man II of Earth-One. While noticing that Shaggy Man is not a living being, Green Arrow defeated it with an explosive arrow. Green Arrow was among those who were killed by the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s Shadow Demons which he tried to fight in Chicago as Peacemaker of Earth-Four was unable to get to him in time. This was because Green Arrow of Earth-Two was not as fast as he used to be due to his current age. The Anti-Monitor&#x27;s defeat destroyed all the planets of the Multiverse and rebooted the DC universe with a single Earth.

=== Modern DC alternate universes ===
DC&#x27;s weekly series &quot;52&quot; established a new 52-Earth Multiverse. The ongoing series &quot;Countdown&quot; showcased several of these. On Earth-3, an evil equivalent of Green Arrow is a member of the supervillain co-op called the Crime Society of America. Another evil equivalent exists in the Antimatter Universe called Deadeye. On Earth-15, Roy Harper has replaced Oliver as Green Arrow. In the gender-reversed world of Earth-11, Oliver is now Olivia Queen, and that world&#x27;s version of the Black Canary closely resembles him in appearance. The &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; (Earth-22) and &quot;Dark Knight Returns&quot; (Earth-31) stories and their variations of Oliver were later amalgamated into the 52-Earth Multiverse.

In the alternate timeline of the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; event, Oliver Queen is the head of Green Arrow Industries, a major military contracting company, as well as leads an ex-military band of Green Arrows. Even though Oliver is an inventive genius, he steals advanced gadgets from super-villains for military use. one day, Oliver discovers his Green Arrows were killed by a female raider at his base at Starfish Island and killing his best friend/head of security Roy Harper. Taking his weapons and gadgets to hunt down the woman in battle, Oliver shockingly learns that she is a daughter of his and Vixen, Oliver&#x27;s former lover, as well as the reason she attacked him was because Green Arrow Industries built factories which specializing in testing super-villain weapons in American towns that inadvertently became targets for the super-villains looking to gain their weapons back. Shocked by her revelation, Oliver had only been stalling before his daughter is killed by his reserve teams he earlier called.

=== Earth-31/&quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; ===
The character appears in Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and the sequel &quot;&quot; listed as Earth-31. Despite missing an arm (implied to be because of Superman), Oliver still proves to be an effective archer (he grasps the nocks of his arrows in his teeth). Oliver was later requested by Batman to help the Dark Knight fight against Superman. Oliver accepts, and implants Batman&#x27;s synthetic kryptonite into the tip of one of his arrows causing Batman to emerge as the winner. After Batman fakes his death for him to go underground, Oliver, sporting a mechanical arm as a prosthesis for his left arm, joins Batman in his war against a corrupted American government run by Alexander Luthor. In &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, Queen is portrayed as an anarchist, while in &quot;The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot;, he is explicitly described as a &quot;billionaire turned Communist.&quot;

=== Other DC Elseworlds stories ===
In &quot;&quot; and , Oliver is a featured as a disabled ex-hero, having lost an arm, an eye, and the use of his legs in a fight with Amazo, which also resulted in the death of Hawkman. Bitter and furious, he now spreads fear on Perry White&#x27;s talk show about the JLA being aliens and claims that they are planning to conquer the world; his former teammates speculate that this is his method of coping. In the sequel, Oliver&#x27;s brain is transplanted into Amazo&#x27;s bodythe Flash having removed Amazo&#x27;s computerized brain in an earlier fightrestoring his sanity, allowing him to defeat the creature threatening the universe at the cost of his own life, after mending fences with his former teammates.

In &quot;&quot;, Oliver Queen is mentioned as having been executed, found guilty of supporting underground Jewish &quot;pornographers&quot;. He has a cameo as Bruce Wayne&#x27;s society friend in Dean Motter&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Oliver Queen also appears in Mike Mignola&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, where he is portrayed as a guilt-ridden latter-day Templar equipped with magic arrows dipped in the blood of Saint Sebastian. He is killed in issue No. 2 by Poison Ivy. Oliver appears in &quot;&quot;, where Oliver Queen is a reporter for the Daily Planet working underneath Perry White and eventually Lois Lane.

An older, balding Green Arrow appears in Mark Waid and Alex Ross&#x27; futuristic &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, in which Oliver has joined forces with Batman to oppose Superman&#x27;s army/Justice League. He married his longtime love Dinah Lance and they have a daughter, Olivia Queen aka Black Canary II.

Green Arrow appears in &quot;League of Justice&quot;, a &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;–inspired fantasy where the character is renamed &quot;Longbow Greenarrow&quot;: a mysterious wizard resembling Gandalf. &quot;JLA: Age of Wonder&quot; shows Green Arrow as a defender of the poor and an enemy of oppression.

=== &quot;Injustice&quot; series ===
In the &quot;&quot; universe, where the Joker kills Lois Lane and her unborn child, driving Superman to autocratic madness, Green Arrow joins Batman&#x27;s Insurgency against Superman&#x27;s Regime, recognizing the corrupt Man of Steel&#x27;s harsher approach to ending crime. In &quot;&quot;, he is married to Black Canary and also unintentionally becomes close to Harley Quinn, who he saves from a near-death encounter with Superman. Near the end of Year One (the comic&#x27;s first volume) he is beaten to death by Superman in his Fortress of Solitude after the former mistakenly believes that the Insurgency has come to harm his adopted parents kept there (though in reality it was a botched attempt to gain a super pill meant to give humans great power). With his final action, Oliver is able to use an arrow to deliver the super pill to the Insurgency so that the mission was not in vain. Year Two reveals Canary to be pregnant with Oliver&#x27;s child, leaving her determined to take down Superman for his murder.

*When Superman nearly kills Black Canary trying to avenge Green Arrow, Doctor Fate heals and takes Dinah to an alternate universe where a different version of Oliver Queen remains alive but his own Black Canary, along with most of his allies, are deceased. Doctor Fate leaves the two to raise the baby—named Conner—together, giving each other a chance at happiness. Five years later, in the prequel comic of the game&#x27;s sequel &quot;Injustice 2&quot;, alternate Oliver and Dinah receive news from Doctor Fate of Superman&#x27;s defeat at the hands of his Prime-Earth counterpart. While Dinah is brought home by Doctor Fate to help Batman restore Earth, the alternate Oliver joins in to honor his late-counterpart. The alternate Oliver discovers that, unlike himself, his deceased counterpart maintained his wealth and resources, and while the public is unaware that its Oliver Queen is dead, alternate Green Arrow is able to access them for the heroes&#x27; needs. He learns his counterpart&#x27;s marriage to Dinah, prompting her to ask the alternate Green Arrow his hand-in-marriage, which he accepts. He and Batman also do not get along, waiting for an opportunity to duel after Oliver reveals that, based on what he learned from Dinah, he has more training than his counterpart.

===Superman: American Alien===
In the 2016 comic book Superman: American Alien by Max Landis, which features an alternate retelling of Clark&#x27;s journey to becoming Superman, Oliver Queen encounters Clark Kent two times in his life. First is when Clark was nineteen and Oliver mistakes him for Bruce Wayne, whom he had thrown a birthday party for despite being aware that Wayne would never show up. Clark, after some hesitation, decides to enjoy himself and befriends Oliver, though he briefly becomes annoyed and shocked at how much money Oliver and his friends waste. Years later, after getting off Starfish Island, Oliver has matured more and encounters Clark again, who has begun his new career at the Daily Planet. At first believing him to be Bruce, Clark quickly comes clean. Oliver forgives him before introducing him to Lex Luthor, partly to annoy the latter.

===Earth 2===
In the pages of &quot;Earth 2: World&#x27;s End&quot;, Oliver Queen is an ally of Batman and operates as Red Arrow. When Batman was killed during the Apokoliptian invasion, Red Arrow continued to guard the Codex that contained the DNA of every animal, plant, and organism in an underwater fortress built by Bruce Wayne. When Batman and Huntress arrive at the underwater fortress, they meet Oliver Queen who assists in fighting the second Apokoliptian invasion. He and the Codex are among those evacuated from Earth when it was destroyed.

==In other media==
===&quot;Smallville&quot;===
Justin Hartley portrayed Oliver Queen/Green Arrow in &quot;Smallville&quot;, and is first introduced in the season six episode &quot;Sneeze&quot;. DC Comics writer Mark Waid had particular praise for Hartley&#x27;s performance, stating &quot;I think Justin Hartley nails Green Arrow perfectly, I mean, there&#x27;s that brashness, that, cockiness – but not to the point where you want to smack him – but right up to the edge.&quot;

Geoff Johns, former President and CCO of DC Entertainment, and who wrote for Hartley in the episode &quot;Absolute Justice&quot; concurred, saying &quot;I love Justin as Green Arrow. I didn&#x27;t realize how good he was until I saw him on screen. Like, I knew he was good; but every line he delivered was perfect. He can make any line sound good. So I was pleasantly surprised by how much he stole the scenes.&quot;

The character starts off as a recurring character who is already an established vigilante in his home of Star City, and is originally paired with Lois Lane in a romantic storyline. After a rough start, he becomes a trusted ally and friend of Clark Kent. Green Arrow retains his many unique arrows and demonstrates expert archery skill, along with skilled use of a crossbow with many trick arrows. In the episode &quot;Justice&quot;, Oliver teams up with Clark to put an end to Lex Luthor&#x27;s experimentation with supervillains by teaming up with other superheroes Clark has met on his journeys, forming a prototypical Justice League. Oliver is seen again in season seven for the episode &quot;Siren&quot;, in which he continues his fight against LuthorCorp and meets another superhero, Black Canary, whom he recruits for his Justice League. In a flashback sequence in the season seven episode &quot;Veritas&quot;, a young version of Oliver Queen can be seen being played by Luke Gair.

From season eight through season ten, Hartley is a series regular, and is woven into the backstory of &quot;Smallville&quot; through the Queens&#x27; business connections with the Luthor, Teague, and Swann families; Oliver was a childhood friend and schoolmate, and later a teenage bully, of Lex Luthor. In the season eight episode &quot;Requiem&quot;, Oliver risks his friendship with Clark by killing Lex, something which Clark would never support. Over the course of the series, Oliver and Clark become increasingly close friends and they establish themselves full-time as superheroes, working with other members of the Justice League when required. Oliver later becomes romantically involved with Clark&#x27;s best friend, Lois&#x27;s cousin Chloe Sullivan, whom he ultimately marries. In the series finale, Oliver serves as the best man at Clark and Lois&#x27; wedding service, and Chloe is shown to have a son in the future, who is implied to be Oliver&#x27;s. &quot;Smallville Season Eleven&quot;, a comic book continuation of the show, reveals he is Oliver&#x27;s son; Jonathan Queen, named after Clark&#x27;s adoptive father.

During the sixth season of &quot;Smallville&quot;, there was talk of spinning off Justin Hartley&#x27;s portrayal of the character Green Arrow into his own series. Hartley however refused to entertain the idea, feeling it was his duty to respect what &quot;Smallville&quot; had accomplished in five seasons, and not &quot;steal the spotlight&quot; because there was &quot;talk&quot; of a spin-off after his two appearances. According to Hartley, &quot;talking&quot; was as far as the spin-off idea ever got. A spin-off series in which Oliver led the Justice League made it into early development. The series was to have been helmed by Stephen S. DeKnight, who would later go on to be the showrunner for the first season of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Daredevil&quot;.

===Arrowverse===
 

In January 2012, following &quot;Smallville&quot;&#x27;s conclusion, The CW prepared a new series centered on the character Green Arrow. Andrew Kreisberg, Greg Berlanti and Marc Guggenheim were announced to be developing the series. A week later, the series was ordered to pilot, to be directed by David Nutter, who had previously directed the pilot for &quot;Smallville&quot;. When developing the series, producer Marc Guggenheim expressed that the creative team wanted to &quot;chart [their] own course, [their] own destiny&quot;, and avoid any direct connections to &quot;Smallville&quot;. Thus rather than continuing on with Hartley&#x27;s incarnation of the character, they opted to cast a new actor in the role and establish the series as its own separate continuity. At the end of the same month, Canadian actor Stephen Amell was cast in the titular role of Oliver Queen.

The series, titled simply &quot;Arrow&quot;, follows the story of former playboy billionaire turned vigilante Oliver Queen after he is rescued from a presumably deserted island, where he was shipwrecked five years earlier. It also features flashbacks to his time away. Guggenheim described the show as more of a &quot;hero show&quot; than a superhero one, wanting the show to be realistic, and stated that much of the inspiration for the flashback sequences was drawn from &quot;Green Arrow: Year One&quot;. Andrew Kreisberg explained that, &quot;We designed [Oliver] as a character a little more tortured&quot; than the comic series Green Arrow. The series premiered in North America on October 10, 2012, and was picked up for a full season later that month. The show went on to air for seven full seasons, with a shortened eighth and final season, consisting of ten episodes, concluding in January 2020. The series became the progenitor of a franchise of television shows and other associated media based around adaptations of a variety of DC Comics characters, set within a shared universe, collectively known as the &#x27;Arrowverse&#x27;, including &quot;The Flash&quot;, &quot;Supergirl&quot;, &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Black Lightning&quot;, and &quot;Batwoman&quot;.

=== DC Extended Universe ===
Stephen Amell had expressed interest in portraying the DC Extended Universe version of Green Arrow but Warner Bros. have explicitly said to have their TV and film universes separate. Green Arrow is mentioned in the eighth episode of &quot;Peacemaker&quot;.

=== &quot;Injustice 2&quot; ===
Oliver Queen / Green Arrow appears in the 2017 video games &quot;Injustice 2&quot;. In the game, he is married to Black Canary and is part of Batman&#x27;s insurgency. He is tasked alongside other allies such as a reformed Harley Quinn to take down a group of supervillains formed by Gorilla Grodd known as &quot;The Society&quot;.

=== &quot;Batman: Arkham Series&quot; ===
Queen Industries is first mentioned in &quot;.&quot; In &quot;,&quot; Queen Industries is shown owning various properties around Gotham. Green Arrow himself is never directly mentioned. A Queen Industries building is also a major landmark in the Metropolis of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.

<doc id="73797" wikidata="Q503010" url="?curid=73797" title="Federal Emergency Management Agency">
<text>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is an agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), initially created under President Jimmy Carter by Presidential Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1978 and implemented by two Executive Orders on April 1, 1979. The agency&#x27;s primary purpose is to coordinate the response to a disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms the resources of local and state authorities. The governor of the state in which the disaster occurs must declare a state of emergency and formally request from the president that FEMA and the federal government respond to the disaster. The only exception to the state&#x27;s gubernatorial declaration requirement occurs when an emergency or disaster takes place on federal property or to a federal asset—for example, the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, or the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; in the 2003 return-flight disaster.

While on-the-ground support of disaster recovery efforts is a major part of FEMA&#x27;s charter, the agency provides state and local governments with experts in specialized fields, funding for rebuilding efforts, and relief funds for infrastructure development by directing individuals to access low-interest loans, in conjunction with the Small Business Administration. In addition to this, FEMA provides funds for response personnel training throughout the United States and funds for non-federal entities to provide housing and services for migrants released from Department of Homeland Security custody.

==History==
Federal emergency management in the U.S. has existed in one form or another for over 200 years.

===Prior to 1930s===
A series of devastating fires struck the port city of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, early in the 19th century. The 7th U.S. Congress passed a measure in 1803 that provided relief for Portsmouth merchants by extending the time they had for remitting tariffs on imported goods. This is widely considered the first piece of legislation passed by the federal government that provided relief after a disaster.

Between 1803 and 1930, &quot;ad hoc&quot; legislation was passed more than 100 times for relief or compensation after a disaster. Examples include the waiving of duties and tariffs to the merchants of New York City after the Great Fire of New York (1835). After the collapse of the John T. Ford&#x27;s Theater in June 1893, the 54th Congress passed legislation compensating those who were injured in the building.

===Piecemeal approach (1930s–1960s)===
After the start of the Great Depression in 1929, President Herbert Hoover had commissioned the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in 1932. The purpose of the RFC was to lend money to banks and institutions to stimulate economic activity. RFC was also responsible for dispensing federal dollars in the wake of a disaster. RFC can be considered the first organized federal disaster response agency.

The Bureau of Public Roads in 1934 was given authority to finance the reconstruction of highways and roads after a disaster. The Flood Control Act of 1944 also gave the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers authority over flood control and irrigation projects and thus played a major role in disaster recovery from flooding.

===Department of Housing and Urban Development (1973–1979)===
Federal disaster relief and recovery was brought under the umbrella of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), in 1973 by Presidential Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, and the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration was created as an organizational unit within the department. This agency would oversee disasters until its incorporation into FEMA in 1978.

Prior to implementation of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1978 by E.O. 12127 and E.O. 12148, many government agencies were still involved in disaster relief; in some cases, more than 100 separate agencies might be jockeying for control and jurisdiction of a disaster.

Over the years, Congress increasingly extended the range of covered categories for assistance, and several presidential executive orders did the same. By enacting these various forms of legislative direction, Congress established a category for annual budgetary amounts of assistance to victims of various types of hazards or disasters, it specified the qualifications, and then it established or delegated the responsibilities to various federal and non-federal agencies.

In time, this expanded array of agencies themselves underwent reorganization. One of the first such federal agencies was the Federal Civil Defense Administration, which operated within the Executive Office of the President. Functions to administer disaster relief were then given to the President himself, who delegated to the Housing and Home Finance Administration. Subsequently, a new office of the Office of Defense Mobilization was created. Then, the new Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization, managed by the EOP; after that, the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization, which renamed the former agency; then, the Office of Civil Defense, under the Department of Defense (DoD); the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW); the Department of Agriculture; the Office of Emergency Planning (OEmP); the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency (replacing the OCD in the DoD); the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the General Services Administration (GSA) (upon termination of the OEmP).

These actions demonstrated that, during those years, the nation&#x27;s domestic preparedness was addressed by several disparate legislative actions, motivated by policy and budgetary earmarking, and not by a single, unifying, comprehensive strategy to meet the nation&#x27;s needs over time. Then, in 1978 an effort was made to consolidate the several singular functions; FEMA was created to house civil defense and disaster preparedness under one roof. This was a very controversial decision.

===FEMA as an independent agency (1979–2003)===

FEMA was established under the 1978 &quot;Reorganization Plan No. 3&quot; and was activated by President Jimmy Carter in an Executive Order on April 1, 1979.

In July, Carter signed Executive Order 12148 shifting disaster relief efforts to the new federal-level agency. FEMA absorbed the Federal Insurance Administration, the National Fire Prevention and Control Administration, the National Weather Service Community Preparedness Program, the Federal Preparedness Agency of the General Services Administration and the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration activities from HUD. FEMA was also given the responsibility for overseeing the nation&#x27;s Civil Defense, a function which had previously been performed by the Department of Defense&#x27;s Defense Civil Preparedness Agency.

One of the disasters FEMA responded to was the dumping of toxic waste into Love Canal in Niagara Falls, New York, in the late 1970s. FEMA also responded to the Three Mile Island nuclear accident where the nuclear-generating station suffered a partial core meltdown. These disasters, while showing the agency could function properly, also uncovered some inefficiencies.

In 1993, President Bill Clinton appointed James Lee Witt as FEMA Director. In 1996, the agency was elevated to cabinet rank; this was not continued by President George W. Bush. Witt initiated reforms that would help to streamline the disaster recovery and mitigation process. The end of the Cold War also allowed the agency&#x27;s resources to be turned away from civil defense to natural disaster preparedness.

After FEMA&#x27;s creation through reorganization and executive orders, Congress continued to expand FEMA&#x27;s authority by assigning responsibilities to it. Those responsibilities include dam safety under the National Dam Safety Program Act; disaster assistance under the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act; earthquake hazards reduction under the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 and further expanded by Executive Order 12699, regarding safety requirements for federal buildings and Executive Order 12941, concerning the need for cost estimates to seismically retrofit federal buildings; emergency food and shelter under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987; hazardous materials, under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.

In addition, FEMA received authority for counterterrorism through the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici amendment under the Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996, which was a response to the recognized vulnerabilities of the U.S. after the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995.

Congress funded FEMA through a combination of regular appropriations and emergency funding in response to events.

===FEMA under Department of Homeland Security (2003–present)===
Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to better coordinate among the different federal agencies that deal with law enforcement, disaster preparedness and recovery, border protection and civil defense. FEMA was absorbed into DHS effective March 1, 2003. As a result, FEMA became part of the Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate of Department of Homeland Security, employing more than 2,600 full-time employees. It became Federal Emergency Management Agency again on March 31, 2007, but remained in DHS.

President Bush appointed Michael D. Brown as FEMA&#x27;s director in January 2003. Brown warned in September 2003 that FEMA&#x27;s absorption into DHS would make a mockery of FEMA&#x27;s new motto, &quot;A Nation Prepared&quot;, and would &quot;fundamentally sever FEMA from its core functions&quot;, &quot;shatter agency morale&quot; and &quot;break longstanding, effective and tested relationships with states and first responder stakeholders&quot;. The inevitable result of the reorganization of 2003, warned Brown, would be &quot;an ineffective and uncoordinated response&quot; to a terrorist attack or a natural disaster.

Hurricane Katrina in 2005 demonstrated that the vision of further unification of functions and another reorganization could not address the problems FEMA had previously faced. The &quot;Final Report of the Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina&quot;, released February 15, 2006, by the U.S. Government Printing Office, revealed that federal funding to states for &quot;all hazards&quot; disaster preparedness needs was not awarded unless the local agencies made the purposes for the funding a &quot;just terrorism&quot; function. Emergency management professionals testified that funds for preparedness for natural hazards were given less priority than preparations for counter-terrorism measures. Testimony also expressed the opinion that the mission to mitigate vulnerability and prepare for natural hazard disasters before they occurred had been separated from disaster preparedness functions, making the nation more vulnerable to known hazards, like hurricanes.

After allegations of mismanagement during Hurricane Katrina, the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) was transferred from the Department of Homeland Security to the Department of Health and Human Services by the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, signed by President George W. Bush on December 18, 2006. In the same year, congress passed the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, which made FEMA a more independent agency within DHS, and better define its primary mission. The act also added a Surge Capacity Force, which allows the Department of Homeland Security to supplement FEMA employees with additional personnel from various federal departments in the event the agency is overwhelmed. The Force has been activated for Hurricane Sandy, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Maria, and the 2017 California wildfires.

In fall 2008, FEMA took over coordination of the Ready Campaign, the national public service advertising campaign in collaboration with the Ad Council, to educate and empower Americans to prepare for and respond to emergencies including natural and man-made disasters. The Ready Campaign and its Spanish-language version Listo asks individuals to do three things: build an emergency supply kit, make a family emergency plan and be informed about the different types of emergencies that can occur and how to respond. The campaign messages have been promoted through television, radio, print, outdoor and web PSAs, as well as brochures, toll-free phone lines and the English and Spanish language websites.

In 2013, as a response to FEMA&#x27;s response to Hurricane Sandy, congress passed the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 which allowed federall recognized tribes to directly request a presidential declaration of emergency.

The Stafford Act was amended by the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act (PETS Act) in 2006, and the Disaster Recovery Reform Act (DRRA) in 2018. DRRA made efforts to focus FEMA effort on improving resiliency, preparedness, and mitigating vulnerabilities for large disasters.

FEMA was put in charge of procuring medical supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to a tweet posted on April 12, 2022, by Deanne Criswell, the FEMA flag, used between 1981 and 2003, was reintroduced.

In 2025, FEMA was subjected to cuts by the Trump administration, firing more than 200 new and veteran employees on February 17th.

==Organization==
During the debate of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, some called for FEMA to remain as an independent agency. Following the failed response to Hurricane Katrina, critics called for FEMA to be removed from the Department of Homeland Security. Today, FEMA exists as a major agency of the Department of Homeland Security. The Administrator for Federal Emergency Management reports directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security. In March 2003, FEMA joined 22 other federal agencies, programs and offices in becoming the Department of Homeland Security. The new department, headed by Secretary Tom Ridge, brought a coordinated approach to national security from emergencies and disasters – both natural and man-made.

FEMA manages the National Flood Insurance Program. Other programs FEMA previously administered have since been internalized or shifted under direct DHS control.

FEMA is also home to the National Continuity Programs Directorate (formerly the Office of National Security Coordination). ONSC was responsible for developing, exercising, and validating agency-wide continuity of government plans as well as overseeing and maintaining continuity readiness including the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center. ONSC also coordinated the continuing efforts of other Federal Executive Agencies.

FEMA began administering the Center for Domestic Preparedness in 2007.

FEMA administers the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) which provides funding to state governments, local governments, Tribal governments, and Territorial governments along with specified Urban Areas and counties along international borders to invest in security enhancements. HSGP is broken out into three primary grant programs: State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSP), Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), and Operation Stonegarden (OPSG). As of 2024, the Tribal Homeland Security Grant Program (THSGP) is funded as a percentage carveout of HSGP as well. The Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) used to be funded under the HSGP as well, but Congress now funds that program separate from HSGP. NSGP provides funding for nonprofit organizations more at risk to terrorist actions and domestic violence extremeism to invest in target hardening. This includes, but is not limited to, organizations such as educational facilities, hospitals, and house of worship. In 2024, FEMA administered over $3 billion across the suite of homeland security grants.

===Budget===
In 2018, FEMA had an annual budget of $30 billion that is used and distributed in different states according to the emergencies that occur in each one. An annual list of the use of these funds is disclosed at the end of the year on FEMA&#x27;s website.

* Acquisitions (ACQ)
* Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
* Civil Rights (CVR)
* Disability Integration (DI)
* Disaster Emergency Communications (DEC)

==Pre-disaster mitigation programs==
FEMA&#x27;s Mitigation Directorate is responsible for programs that take action before a disaster, in order to identify risks and reduce injuries, loss of property, and recovery time. The agency has major analysis programs for floods, hurricanes and tropical storms, dams, and earthquakes.

FEMA works to ensure affordable flood insurance is available to homeowners in flood plains, through the National Flood Insurance Program, and also works to enforce no-build zones in known flood plains and relocate or elevate some at-risk structures.

Pre-Disaster Mitigation grants are available to acquire property for conversion to open space, retrofit existing buildings, construct tornado and storm shelters, manage vegetation for erosion and fire control, and small flood control projects. Critics say this program is underperforming because it is starved for funding compared to disaster response and recovery, the process of applying for a buyout is unreasonably slow, and is wasting taxpayer dollars because the National Flood Insurance Program has paid to reconstruct some properties up to 18 times. 1% of NFIP-insured properties are responsible for more than one quarter of the money the program has paid out.

The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds rebuilding after a current disaster in a way that reduces the impact of a similar future disaster.

==Response capabilities==

FEMA&#x27;s emergency response is based on small, decentralized teams trained in such areas as the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), Urban Search and Rescue (USAR), Disaster Mortuary Operations Response Team (DMORT), Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT), and Mobile Emergency Response Support (MERS).

===National Response Coordination Center (NRCC)===
FEMA&#x27;s National Response Coordination Center (NRCC) is a multiagency center located at FEMA HQ that coordinates the overall Federal support for major disasters and emergencies, including catastrophic incidents in support of operations at the regional level. The FEMA Administrator, or his or her delegate, activates the NRCC in anticipation of, or in response to, an incident by activating the NRCC staff, which includes FEMA personnel, the appropriate Emergency Support Functions, and other appropriate personnel (including nongovernmental organization and private sector representatives). During the initial stages of a response, FEMA will, as part of the whole community, focus on projected, potential, or escalating critical incident activities. The NRCC coordinates with the affected region(s) and provides needed resources and policy guidance in support of incident-level operations. The NRCC staff specifically provides emergency management coordination, planning, resource deployment, and collects and disseminates incident information as it builds and maintains situational awareness—all at the national-level. FEMA maintains the NRCC as a functional component of the NOC for incident support operations.

An example of NRCC activity is the coordination of emergency management activities that took place in connection with the 2013 Colorado floods.

===Disaster Medical Assistance Teams===

Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMAT) provide medical care at disasters and are typically made up of doctors and paramedics. There are also National Nursing Response Teams (NNRT), National Pharmacy Response Teams (NPRT) and Veterinary Medical Assistance Teams (VMAT). Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Teams (DMORT) provide mortuary and forensic services. National Medical Response Teams (NMRT) are equipped to decontaminate victims of chemical and biological agents.

===Urban Search and Rescue (US&amp;R)===
The Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces perform rescue of victims from structural collapses, confined spaces, and other disasters, for example, mine collapses and earthquakes.

===Mobile Emergency Response Support (MERS)===
These teams provide communications support to local public safety. For instance, they may operate a truck with satellite uplink, computers, telephone, and power generation at a staging area near a disaster so that the responders can communicate with the outside world. There are also Mobile Air Transportable Telecommunications System (MATTS) assets which can be airlifted in. Also, portable cell phone towers can be erected to allow local responders to access telephone systems.

The first test of the national wireless emergency system by FEMA was broadcast to an estimated 225 million electronic devices at 14:18 EDT on October 3, 2018. The text message was accompanied by a flashing warning sign and warning tone. The president may direct FEMA to broadcast such alerts only for national emergencies or if the public is in danger. The facility may not be used for personal messages from the president. Mobile phone owners can not opt out of these warnings.

===Preparedness for nuclear incidents===
On August 1, 2008, FEMA released &quot;Planning Guidance for Protection and Recovery Following Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD) and Improvised Nuclear Device (IND) incidents&quot;, which provide an action guide in the case of radioactive contamination. This guidance is specified as action guide for Radiological Dispersal Devices (RDD) and Improvised Nuclear Devices (IND) involving high levels of radiation. According to the Federation of American Scientists, during the Cold War FEMA prepared assessments of the likely consequences of a full-scale Soviet nuclear attack on the United States for use in planning mitigation and recovery efforts. FEMA also prepared plans for evacuating major U.S. cities in response to a nuclear war, dubbed CRP-2B.

===Training===
FEMA offers a large number of training classes, either at its own centers, through programs at the state level, in cooperation with colleges and universities, or online. The latter are free classes available to anyone, although only those with U.S. residency or work eligibility can take the final examinations. More information is available on the FEMA website under the &quot;Emergency Personnel&quot; and &quot;Training&quot; subheadings. Other emergency response information for citizens is also available at its website.

FEMA runs the Incident Workforce Academy, a two-week emergency preparedness training program for FEMA employees. The first class of the academy graduated in early 2014.

The Training and Education Division within FEMA&#x27;s National Integration Center directly funds training for responders and provides guidance on training-related expenditures under FEMA&#x27;s grant programs. Information on designing effective training for first responders is available from the Training and Education Division. Emergency managers and other interested members of the public can take independent study courses for certification at FEMA&#x27;s online Emergency Management Institute.

====Emergency Management Institute training and certifications====

EMI offers credentials and training opportunities for United States Citizens. Note that students do not have to be employed by FEMA or be a federal employee for some of the programs. However, they do need to create a FEMA SID to take the final exams

EMI maintains a strategic partnership with Frederick Community College. FCC has contracted with the Emergency Management Institute to provide college credit for the Independent Study Program (ISP). FCC offers eight specialized Letters of Recognition, an Undergraduate Certificate, and an Associate of Applied Science degree in Emergency Management.

==FEMA Corps==
FEMA Corps, who range in age from 18 to 26 years old, is a cadre dedicated to disaster response and recovery. It is a new partnership between The Corporation for National and Community Service&#x27;s AmeriCorps NCCC (National Civilian Community Corps) and FEMA.
The Corps, described as a &quot;dedicated, trained, and reliable disaster workforce&quot;, works full-time for 10 months on federal disaster response, recovery, mitigation, and preparedness efforts across numerous sections. Over 150 members of the inaugural FEMA Corps class graduated in June 2013, at the Southern Region AmeriCorps NCCC campus in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The Pacific Region campus in Sacramento, California and the Southern Region campus both support a FEMA Corps class annually. The Corps work on teams of 6 to 10 people and follow the traditional NCCC model of living together and traveling together. In addition to working with FEMA, Corps members must perform AmeriCorps responsibilities such as Physical Training three times a week, National Days of Service, and Individual Service Projects in communities throughout the United States. Members receive $6.10 a day for food ($15 a day when deployed to on disaster project) and a living stipend of approximately $3,500 over 10 months (Approximately $175 every two weeks). Team leaders receive a larger stipend of approximately $10,000 over the course of 10 months (Approximately $500 every two weeks). The Segal AmeriCorps education award is distributed to Corps members who successfully finish their term of service, completing 1,700 or more total hours. The amount of a full-time Segal AmeriCorps Education Award is equivalent to the maximum value of the Pell Grant for the fiscal year in which the term of national service is approved, and can therefore change between different classes.

FEMA has led a Public-Private Partnership in creating a National Donations Management Program making it easier for corporations or individuals not previously engaged to make offers of free assistance to States and the Federal Government in times of disaster. The program is a partnership among FEMA, relief agencies, corporations/corporate associations and participating state governments.

==Criticisms==
===Hurricane Andrew===

In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew struck the Florida and Louisiana coasts with 165 mph (265 km/h) sustained winds. FEMA was widely criticized for its response to Andrew, summed up by the famous exclamation, &quot;Where in the hell is the cavalry on this one?&quot; by Kate Hale, emergency management director for Miami-Dade County, Florida. FEMA and the federal government at large were accused of not responding fast enough to house, feed and sustain the approximately 250,000 people left homeless in the affected areas. Within five days the federal government and neighboring states had dispatched 20,000 National Guard and active duty troops to South Dade County to set up temporary housing. This event and FEMA&#x27;s performance was reviewed by the National Academy of Public Administration in its February 1993 report &quot;Coping With Catastrophe&quot; which identified several basic paradigms in Emergency Management and FEMA administration that were causes of the failed response.

FEMA had previously been criticized for its response to Hurricane Hugo, which hit South Carolina in September 1989, and many of the same issues that plagued the agency during Hurricane Andrew were also evident during the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Additionally, upon incorporation into DHS, FEMA was legally dissolved and a new Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate was established in DHS to replace it. Following enactment of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 FEMA was reestablished as an entity within DHS, on March 31, 2007.

===Southern Florida hurricanes===
South Florida newspaper &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; has an extensive list of documented criticisms of FEMA during the four hurricanes that hit the region in 2004.
Some of the criticisms include:
* When Hurricane Frances hit South Florida on Labor Day weekend (over 100 miles north of Miami-Dade County), 9,800 Miami-Dade applicants were approved by FEMA for $21 million in storm claims for new furniture; clothes; thousands of new televisions, microwaves and refrigerators; cars; dental bills; and a funeral even though the Medical Examiner recorded no deaths from Frances. A U.S. Senate committee and the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security found that FEMA inappropriately declared Miami-Dade county a disaster area and then awarded millions, often without verifying storm damage or a need for assistance.
* FEMA used hurricane aid money to pay funeral expenses for at least 203 Floridians whose deaths were not caused by the 2004 hurricanes, the state&#x27;s coroners have concluded. Ten of the people whose funerals were paid for were not in Florida at the time of their deaths.

The rising sea levels, global temperatures, and increase of flooding and severe storms has called for a change within the procedure of flood insurance. The communities that are directly impacted by these changes include coastal communities and waterfront homes. The procedural design of flood insurance is done through FEMA&#x27;s (Federal Emergency Management Agency) National Flood Insurance Program. Previously the Insurance Program created in 1968 was constructed around the &quot;100-year floodplain&quot; which is the &quot;area that would be inundated by the 100-year flood, better thought of as an area that has a one percent or greater chance of experiencing a flood in any single year&quot;, and large subsidies for coastal homes, especially in Florida. However, in 2019, major changes were made, and the new program called Risk Rating 2.0 was introduced, which prices a house on its individual flood risk. It will account for the distance one&#x27;s house is from a flood source, the types and frequency of flooding, and characteristics of the cost to rebuild. This new program will greatly impact states like Florida that have intense risk of hurricanes and sea level rise. Through the initial program, the homes on the coast were mostly being subsidized at the cost of the homeowners more inland, and more likely lower-income and people of color. However, as previously stated, with Risk Rating 2.0, homeowners in higher risk areas of greater flooding will be paying for that risk through insurance, and with that may come with re-evaluating the longevity of one&#x27;s place on the coasts of Florida. On the other hand, with FEMA&#x27;s program as a national program, we see different impacts in places like New England. It has been indicated that states like Maine will be greatly impacted positively by the new program. The bays, inlets, and coves are proved to be good protective measures for most waterfront properties. In addition to Maine, states like Iowa and Nebraska will see impacts to their flood insurance policies. It is stated that almost 50% of Nebraskans and 40% of Iowans will see a decrease in their policies. Overall we see many different types of complications to this new set-up, such as retirees on fixed incomes, long-term mortgages, and depreciation of household value. As this program is relatively new, impacts of the program will continue to be seen in the following years.

===Hurricane Katrina===
FEMA received intense criticism for its response to the Hurricane Katrina disaster in August 2005. FEMA had pre-positioned response personnel in the Gulf Coast region. However, many could not render direct assistance and were able to report only on the dire situation along the Gulf Coast, especially from New Orleans. Within three days, a large contingent of National Guard and active duty troops were deployed to the region.

The enormous number of evacuees simply overwhelmed rescue personnel. The situation was compounded by flood waters in the city that hampered transportation and poor communication among the federal government, state, and local entities. FEMA was widely criticized for what is seen as a slow initial response to the disaster and an inability to effectively manage, care for, and move those who were trying to leave the city.

Then-FEMA Director Michael D. Brown was criticized personally for a slow response and an apparent disconnection with the situation. Brown would eventually be relieved of command of the Katrina disaster and soon thereafter resigned.

According to the U.S. House of Representatives Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina:
*&quot;The Secretary Department of Homeland Security should have designated the Principal Federal Official on Saturday, two days prior to landfall, from the roster of PFOs who had successfully completed the required training, unlike then FEMA Director Michael Brown. Considerable confusion was caused by the Secretary&#x27;s PFO decisions.&quot;
*&quot;DHS and FEMA lacked adequate trained and experienced staff for the Katrina response.&quot;
*&quot;The readiness of FEMA&#x27;s national emergency response teams was inadequate and reduced the effectiveness of the federal response.&quot;
*&quot;Long-standing weaknesses and the magnitude of the disaster overwhelmed FEMA&#x27;s ability to provide emergency shelter and temporary housing.&quot;
*&quot;FEMA logistics and contracting systems did not support a targeted, massive, and sustained provision of commodities.&quot;
*&quot;Before Katrina, FEMA suffered from a lack of sufficiently trained procurement professionals.&quot;
Other failings were also noted. The Committee devoted an entire section of the report to listing the actions of FEMA. Their conclusion was:

For years emergency management professionals have been warning that FEMA&#x27;s preparedness has eroded. Many believe this erosion is a result of the separation of the preparedness function from FEMA, the drain of long-term professional staff along with their institutional knowledge and expertise, and the inadequate readiness of FEMA&#x27;s national emergency response teams. The combination of these staffing, training, and organizational structures made FEMA&#x27;s inadequate performance in the face of a
disaster the size of Katrina all but inevitable.

Pursuant to a temporary restraining order issued by Hon. Stanwood R. Duval, United States District Court Judge, Eastern District of Louisiana as a result of the McWaters v. FEMA class-action, February 7, 2006, was set as the deadline for the official end of any further coverage of temporary housing costs for Katrina victims.

After the February 7 deadline, Katrina victims were left to their own devices either to find permanent housing for the long term or to continue in social welfare programs set up by other organizations. There were many Katrina evacuees living in temporary shelters or trailer parks set up by FEMA and other relief organizations in the first months after the disaster hit, but much more were still unable to find housing.

In July 2007, ice that had been ordered for Katrina victims but had never been used and kept in storage facilities, at a cost of $12.5 million, was melted down.

In June 2008, a CNN investigation found that FEMA gave away about $85 million in household goods meant for Hurricane Katrina victims to 16 other states.

===Buffalo snowstorm===
FEMA came under attack for their response to the October Surprise Storm in Buffalo, New York, on October 13, 2006. As FEMA legally cannot interfere with state business unless asked, FEMA responded that as per procedure, the governor of the state of New York, George Pataki, had not asked for FEMA&#x27;s assistance. FEMA Headquarters had been in constant contact with State congressional offices providing them with the latest information available. Claims state that FEMA officials did not arrive until October 16, three days after the storm hit. The snowstorm damage by this time included downed power wires, downed trees, and caused structural damage to homes and businesses.

===Dumas, Arkansas, tornadoes===
Many people of Dumas, Arkansas, especially victims of tornadoes on February 24, 2007, criticized FEMA&#x27;s response in not supplying the number of new trailers they needed, and sending only a set of used trailers, lower than the needed quantity. Following the storm, U.S Senator Mark Pryor had criticized FEMA&#x27;s response to the recovery and cleanup efforts.

===California wildfires===

FEMA came under intense criticism when it was revealed that a press conference on the October 2007 California wildfires was staged. Deputy Administrator Harvey E. Johnson was answering questions from FEMA employees who were posing as reporters. Many of these questions were &quot;softball&quot; questions (i.e., &quot;Are you happy with FEMA&#x27;s response so far?&quot;), intentionally asked in a way that would evoke a positive response giving the impression that FEMA was doing everything right. In this way, any scrutiny from real reporters (many of whom were given only a 15-minute notice) would have been avoided. Fox News, MSNBC, and other media outlets aired the staged press briefing live. Real reporters were notified only 15 minutes in advance and were able to call into only a conference line, which was set to &quot;listen-only&quot; mode. The only people there were primarily FEMA public affairs employees.

===Hurricane Maria===

In September 2017, Hurricane Maria struck Dominica and Puerto Rico with 175 mph (280 km/h) sustained winds. Maria was the fifth-strongest storm to ever strike the United States with stronger winds than those brought by Irma and similar rain brought to Houston by Hurricane Harvey. 
Despite FEMA&#x27;s preemptive efforts in Puerto Rico, the island was still devastated beyond expectation. The agency had prepared some provisions for displaced residents before the storm struck, including: roughly 124 FEMA staff members being positioned on the island, food, water, and bedding. However, people reported the FEMA food packages were unhealthy snacks such as the confectionery Skittles. FEMA was widely criticized for its response to Maria, as the island quickly fell into a humanitarian crisis.

The island also experienced a massive loss of power as a result of flood and wind damage sustained during Maria. In the beginning of October 2017, Lieutenant General Todd Semonite, chief and commanding general of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, explained the extent of and necessity of aid for this power crisis. Semonite described some specifics of the outage to reporters, explaining that the island requires &quot;2,700 megawatts of electricity to operate and at last count had 376 megawatts available.&quot; This translates to about 14 percent of the grid being functional.

FEMA Administrator William &quot;Brock&quot; Long told reporters in a briefing following the storm that Puerto Rico politics had hindered the ability of the federal government to send aid. He explained that political divisions had prevented unity for leaders in this time of crisis, describing that their issue was &quot;even worse&quot; than the mainland United States&#x27; issue between Democrats and Republicans. Residents, in some cases, were required to fill out paperwork in English rather than Spanish with little to no hope of receiving the aid they had requested.

Brigadier General Jose Reyes of the Puerto Rico National Guard discussed a strategy to quicken the arrival of resources via the Port of Ponce, located on the southern coast of Puerto Rico. Reyes also attributed the delay in these services to the unprecedented series of storms that demanded attention from the agency within a short period of time. Regarding this, General Reyes told reporters &quot; We were not even getting back on our feet after Irma, then suddenly we got hit by Maria.&quot; He also addressed the disparities between aid sent to mainland disaster-stricken areas and Puerto Rico, explaining that in areas such as Florida and Texas, who had recently struck with similar damages, transportation of resources is relatively simpler. This is because they are able to utilize infrastructure to transport aid. Transporting similar resources to Puerto Rico has proved to be more difficult, as they must travel across the ocean, either in aircraft or in ships. Long also mentioned that Puerto Rico&#x27;s international airport was not able to operate at full capacity, which posed an additional obstacle for federal aid imports.

Long resigned on March 8, 2019, following criticism of his handling of Hurricane Maria and an ethical complaint over misuse of official vehicles, costing $151,000. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said that Long would have to reimburse the government for the cost of the vehicles and staff involved in the trips, many of which were between Washington and his home in North Carolina. Nielsen submitted her own resignation as Secretary of Homeland Security less than a month later on April 7, 2019.

===Hurricane Harvey===

Hurricane Harvey made landfall in late August 2017 as a Category 4 Hurricane with 130 mph (215 km/h) sustained winds. The Hurricane predominantly affected southeast Texas; however, its effects were felt as far as Arkansas, Kentucky, and Tennessee in the form of flash flooding. Harvey slowly progressed around southeast Texas, where it produced heavy precipitation over the region. This caused heavy flooding in residential areas such as Colorado City, Liberty, and Montgomery, Texas.

Harvey was the first of a series of hurricanes and tropical storms to affect the United States between August and September 2017. The effects of these storms included extreme flooding, damage from high speed winds, structural damage, and humanitarian concerns regarding the availability of basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter.

Some recipients were forced to wait up to two months before receiving aid from FEMA, as technical complications held up both their application for it and the processing of said applications. Some residents were denied Federal Aid and have to dispute their denial in efforts to rebuild and repair properties without taking a considerably large financial loss.

=== Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) ===
In early April 2020, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the Trump administration was &quot;quietly&quot; seizing medical supplies from states and hospitals, citing hospital and clinic officials catering to seven states. These officials stated that the administration has not informed them how they can otherwise get access to their ordered supplies. A FEMA representative said the agency, working with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense, has developed a system for identifying needed supplies from vendors and distributing them equitably. The federal government also seized an order for thermometers meant for Florida, an order for masks from the Texas Association of Community Health Centers, and an order for testing supplies meant for the PeaceHealth hospital system in Washington, Oregon and Alaska.

On April 24, San Francisco Mayor London Breed said &quot;We&#x27;ve had situations when things we&#x27;ve ordered that have gone through Customs were confiscated by FEMA to be diverted to other locations. We know everyone is dealing with a serious challenge. Through Customs, we&#x27;ve had situations where those items have been taken and put out on the market for the highest bidder, putting cities against cities and states against states.&quot;

Massachusetts Secretary of Health and Human Services Marylou Sudders cited a shipment of 3 million masks that the state had negotiated to buy from BJ&#x27;s Wholesale Club, until the federal government impounded them from the Port of New York and New Jersey on March 18. A further order from MSC Industrial Supply for 400 masks to be delivered on March 20 was also claimed by the federal government using force majeure. Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker reached out to the New England Patriots professional American football team, who used the team plane &quot;AirKraft&quot; to bring approximately 1.2 million N95 masks from China to Boston.

In late April, reports of the actions taken by FEMA in Massachusetts prompted Maryland Governor Larry Hogan to deploy the Maryland National Guard and task them with guarding a shipment of 500,000 COVID-19 testing kits purchased from South Korean company LabGenomics by the Government of Maryland. The tests were subsequently held in an &quot;undisclosed location,&quot; under the continued supervision of the Maryland National Guard.

The state of Colorado was set to purchase 500 ventilators before Federal Emergency Management Agency swooped in and bought them first. President Trump announced on Twitter that the federal government would be sending 100 ventilators to Colorado at the request of Senator Cory Gardner. The incident caused Colorado Governor Polis to make future supply purchases in secret.

In late April, 5,000,000 masks meant for hospitals of the Veterans Health Administration were seized by FEMA and redirected to the Strategic National Stockpile, stated Richard Stone, Executive in Charge, Veterans Health Administration. After an appeal from Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie to FEMA, the agency provided the VA with 500,000 masks.

==Federalism and FEMA==
The costs of a disaster to states and localities can escalate quickly. Federal assistance becomes fully available with the approval of the President and at the request of the governor. Public help for governments to repair facilities is 75% federally funded with local governments responsible for covering the rest (unless the state grants aid or loans). FEMA does not compensate for buildings that have been improperly maintained by the state or local government nor does it pay to upgrade or improve facilities. FEMA coordinates but does not fund disaster assistance provided by the Small Business Administration or the Farmers Home Administration. FEMA grant-in aid funds come from revenue sharing, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Transportation. Grants for disaster preparedness can be used by flood control districts.

Many states have disaster relief agencies of their own. In the event of a disaster outside of a state&#x27;s operating capacity, the director of said agency will advise the Governor whether or not to proclaim a state of emergency. Declaring a state of emergency, upon Presidential approval, entitles a state to federal assistance.

Proclaiming a state of emergency does not guarantee federal assistance. States also rely on mutual aid agreements, such as the Civil Defense and Disaster Compact and Emergency Management Assistance Compact. A mutual aid agreement can be between neighboring states, cities, counties and cities, states and cities or an entire region. These agreements allow agencies to share resources so they are better prepared for emergencies.

Local governments have the most immediate responsibility. Four factors shape local disaster response:
# The extent of tax base depletion
# The scope of lost sales tax revenue
# Access to other forms of revenue
# Amount of city debt
Having a mostly intact tax base allows local governments to maintain steady revenue stream. Business unharmed by a disaster will be able to continue to generate sales tax revenue. Cities with access to large revenue reserves and strong mutual aid agreements will have greater response capacity. While cities with large municipal debt that would be unable to pay back state or federal loans would be in a difficult situation.

===U.S. v. Parish of Jefferson et al===
This case gave FEMA the right to sue in order to recover funds paid out in flood insurance claims for flood damage as a result of poor decisions by local officials and developers. The case also gave FEMA the power to sue localities who fail to meet flood plain management requirements.

<text>In the Book of Mormon, the Nephites () are one of four groups (along with the Lamanites, Jaredites, and Mulekites) said to have settled in the ancient Americas. The term is used throughout the Book of Mormon to describe the religious, political, and cultural traditions of the group of settlers.

The Nephites are described as a group of people that descended from or were associated with Nephi, a son of the prophet Lehi, who left Jerusalem at the urging of God in about 600 BC and traveled with his family to the Western Hemisphere and arrived to the Americas in about 589 BC. The Book of Mormon notes them as initially righteous people who eventually &quot;had fallen into a state of unbelief and awful wickedness&quot; and were destroyed by the Lamanites in about AD 385.

Some Mormon scholars have suggested that the Nephites settled somewhere in present-day Central America. However, non-Mormon scholars and, notably, the Smithsonian Institution, have stated that they have seen no evidence to support the Book of Mormon as a historical account.

==Archaeology==
The existence of the Nephites is part of the Mormon belief system.

The Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), part of Brigham Young University, has performed extensive archaeological research on this subject, and publications on the subject and other historical topics are issued regularly by FARMS. This research is disputed by many researchers, including Michael Coe, a scholar in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican history, as well as the Smithsonian Institution.

In 1973, Coe addressed the issue in an article for &quot;&quot;:

In 1996, the Smithsonian Institution issued a statement that addressed claims made in the Book of Mormon by stating that the text is primarily a religious text and that archeologists affiliated with the Institution found &quot;no direct connection between the archeology of the New World and the subject matter of the book.&quot; The statement further says that there is genetic evidence that the Native Americans are closely related to peoples of Asia and that archaeological evidence indicates that the Native Americans migrated from Asia over a land bridge over the Bering Strait in prehistoric times. The statement said that there was no credible evidence of contact between Ancient Egyptian or Hebrew peoples and the New World, as indicated by the text of the Book of Mormon. The statement was issued in response to reports that the name of the Smithsonian Institution was being improperly used to lend credibility to the claims of those looking to support the events of the Book of Mormon. The National Geographic Society issued a similar letter in response to an inquiry from the Institute for Religious Research saying that &quot;the Society does not know of anything found so far that has substantiated &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;&quot;.

==Book of Mormon narrative==
===Kings===
After the Nephites arrived in America, up to the reign of Mosiah II (c. 592–91 BC), the Nephites were ruled by kings. Nephi&#x27;s brother Jacob explains that subsequent kings bore the title &quot;Nephi&quot;.

===Judges===
The last Nephite king was Mosiah II. About 91 BC, he declared that, instead of naming a new king, he would finish out his reign as king, after which the Nephites would elect judges to govern them. There were at least three levels of judges: one chief judge, several higher judges, and several lower judges. (Some passages speak of multiple &quot;chief judges&quot;, probably synonymous with &quot;higher judges&quot;; for example, Alma 62:47; 3 Nephi 6:21.)

Judges were paid according to the amount of time they spent officiating. Mosiah II set the rate at one senine of gold (or the equivalent senum of silver) for one day&#x27;s work (Alma 11:1, 3). He also arranged for checks in this system to avert corruption as much as possible:

After announcing the governmental shift from kings to judges, Mosiah explained the principle behind the change:

The system of judges lasted for 120 years, when it was briefly overthrown for about three years (c. 30–33 AD) by an aristocratic cadre, led by a man named Jacob. It was replaced by a loose system of tribes and kinships, which lasted until Jesus appeared in America and established a society that approached the ideals of Zion. The society endured for about two centuries before the people fell into wickedness again.

After 4 Nephi, no mention is made of whether the Nephites used judges or kings. Mormon mentions that &quot;the Lamanites had a king&quot; (Mormon 2:9). His inclusion of that detail, phrased as it is, can be seen as a contrast to the Nephites having a chief judge. Since no change in government form is specifically mentioned after 4 Nephi, it is possible that the Nephites continued to use judges until their destruction in about AD 385.

<doc id="73828" wikidata="Q41592" url="?curid=73828" title="Basil I">
<text>Basil I, nicknamed &quot;the Macedonian&quot; (; 811 – 29 August 886), was Byzantine emperor from 867 to 886. Born to a peasant family in Macedonia, he rose to prominence in the imperial court after gaining the favour of Emperor Michael III, whose mistress he married on his emperor&#x27;s orders. In 866, Michael proclaimed him co-emperor. Fearing a loss of influence, Basil orchestrated Michael&#x27;s assassination the next year and installed himself as sole ruler of the empire. He was the first ruler of the Macedonian dynasty.

Despite his humble origins, Basil was an effective and respected monarch. He initiated a complete overhaul of Byzantine law, an effort continued by his successor that ultimately became the &quot;Basilika&quot;. On the foreign front, he achieved military success against the heretical Paulicians, whom he subjugated in 872. He also pursued an active policy in the west, allying with Carolingian emperor Louis II against the Arabs, which led to a new period of Byzantine domination in Italy. Upon his death in a hunting accident in 886, he was succeeded by his son Leo VI, also rumoured to have been the son of Michael III.

==From peasant to emperor==
Basil was born to peasant parents in late 811 (or sometime in the 830s in the estimation of some scholars) at Chariopolis in the Byzantine theme of Macedonia (an administrative division corresponding to the area of Adrianople in Thrace). The name of his mother was Pankalo, the name of his paternal grandfather was Maiktes/Leo. His paternal grandmother&#x27;s father was named Leo/Maiktes. His ethnic origin is unknown and has been a subject of debate.

During Basil&#x27;s reign, an elaborate genealogy was produced that purported that his ancestors were not mere peasants, as everyone believed, but descendants of the Arsacid (Arshakuni) kings of Armenia, Alexander the Great and also of Constantine the Great. The Armenian historians Samuel of Ani and Stephen of Taron record that he hailed from the village of Thil in Taron. In contrast, Persian writers such as Hamza al-Isfahani, or al-Tabari, call both Basil and his mother &quot;Saqlabi&quot;, an ethnogeographic term that usually denoted the Slavs, but can also be interpreted as a generic term encompassing the inhabitants of the region between Constantinople and Bulgaria. Claims have therefore been made for an Armenian, Slavic, or indeed &quot;Armeno-Slavonic&quot; origin for Basil&#x27;s father. The name of his mother points to a Greek origin on the maternal side. The general scholarly consensus is that Basil&#x27;s father was &quot;probably&quot; of Armenian origin, and settled in Byzantine Thrace. His close associates and friends were mostly Armenians and, besides Greek, he might have spoken Armenian as well. Norman Tobias, the author of the only dedicated biography of Basil I in English, concluded that it is impossible to be certain what the ethnic origins of the emperor were, though Basil was definitely reliant on the support of Armenians in prominent positions within the Byzantine Empire.
One story asserts that he had spent a part of his childhood in captivity in Bulgaria, where his family had, allegedly, been carried off as captives of the Khan Krum (r. 803–814) in 813. Basil lived there until 836, when he and several others escaped to Byzantine-held territory in Thrace. Basil was ultimately lucky enough to enter the service of Theophilitzes, a relative of the Caesar Bardas (the uncle of Emperor Michael III), as a groom. While serving Theophilitzes, he visited the city of Patras, where he gained the favour of Danielis, a wealthy woman who took him into her household and endowed him with a fortune. He also earned the notice of Michael III by his abilities as a horse tamer and in winning a victory over a Bulgarian champion in a wrestling match; he soon became the Byzantine Emperor&#x27;s companion, confidant, and bodyguard (&quot;parakoimomenos&quot;). Symeon Magister describes Basil as &quot;... most outstanding in bodily form and heavy set; his eyebrows grew together, he had large eyes and a broad chest, and a rather downcast expression&quot;.

On Emperor Michael&#x27;s orders, Basil divorced his wife Maria and married Eudokia Ingerina, Michael&#x27;s favourite mistress, in around 865. Around the same time, Michael III offered him his sister Thekla as a mistress. Basil had an affair with her until 870, when he discovered that she was being unfaithful to him and, for this reason, he sent her back to the convent she had been immured in previously. During an expedition against the Arabs, Basil convinced Michael III that his uncle Bardas coveted the Byzantine throne, and subsequently murdered Bardas with Michael&#x27;s approval on 21 April 866. Basil then became the leading personality at court and was invested in the now vacant dignity of &quot;kaisar&quot; (Caesar), before being crowned co-emperor on 26 May 866. This promotion may have included Basil&#x27;s adoption by Michael III, himself a much younger man. It was commonly believed that Leo VI, Basil&#x27;s successor and reputed son, was really the son of Michael. Although Basil seems to have shared this belief (and hated Leo), the subsequent promotion of Basil to caesar and then co-emperor provided the child with a legitimate and Imperial parent and secured his succession to the Byzantine throne. When Leo was born, Michael III celebrated the event with public chariot races, whilst he pointedly instructed Basil not to presume on his new position as junior emperor.

When Michael III started to favour another courtier, Basiliskianos, Basil felt that his position was being undermined. Michael threatened to invest Basiliskianos with the Imperial title and this induced Basil to pre-empt events by organizing the assassination of Michael on the night of 24 September 867. Michael and Basiliskianos were insensibly drunk following a banquet at the palace of Anthimos when Basil, with a small group of companions (including his father Bardas, brother Marinos, and cousin Ayleon), gained entry. The locks to the chamber doors had been tampered with and the chamberlain had not posted guards; both victims were then put to the sword. On Michael III&#x27;s death, Basil, as an already acclaimed co-emperor, automatically became the ruling &quot;basileus&quot;.

==Reign==

Basil I became an effective and respected monarch despite being a man with no formal education and little military or administrative experience. Moreover, he had been the boon companion of a debauched monarch and had achieved power through a series of calculated murders. That there was little political reaction to the murder of Michael III is probably due to his unpopularity with the bureaucrats of Constantinople because of his disinterest in the administrative duties of the Imperial office. Also, Michael&#x27;s public displays of impiety had alienated the Byzantine populace in general. Once in power Basil soon showed that he intended to rule effectively and as early as his coronation he displayed an overt religiosity by formally dedicating his crown to Christ. He maintained a reputation for conventional piety and orthodoxy throughout his 19-year-long reign.

===Domestic policies===
Because of the great legislative work which Basil I undertook, he is often called the &quot;second Justinian.&quot; Basil&#x27;s laws were collected in the &quot;Basilika&quot;, consisting of sixty books, and smaller legal manuals known as the &quot;Eisagoge&quot;. Leo VI was responsible for completing these legal works. The &quot;Basilika&quot; remained the law of the Byzantine Empire down to its conquest by the Ottomans. Ironically, this codification of laws seems to have begun under the direction of the &quot;caesar&quot; Bardas who was murdered by Basil. Basil personally oversaw the construction of the &quot;Nea Ekklesia&quot; cathedral and his palatine hall the Kainourgion. His ecclesiastical policy was marked by good relations with Rome. One of his first acts was to exile the Patriarch of Constantinople, Photios, and restore his rival Ignatios, whose claims were supported by Pope Adrian II.

===Foreign affairs===

Emperor Basil&#x27;s reign was marked by the troublesome ongoing war with the heretical Paulicians, centered on Tephrike on the upper Euphrates, who rebelled, allied with the Arabs, and raided as far as Nicaea, sacking Ephesus. Basil&#x27;s general, Christopher, defeated the Paulicians in 872, and the death of their leader, Chrysocheir, led to the definite subjection of their state. Basil was the first Byzantine emperor since Constans II (r. 641–668) to pursue an active policy to restore the Empire&#x27;s power in the West. Basil allied with Holy Roman Emperor Louis II (r. 850–875) against the Arabs and sent a fleet of 139 ships to clear the Adriatic Sea of their raids. With Byzantine help, Louis II captured Bari from the Arabs in 871. The city eventually became Byzantine territory in 876. However, the Byzantine position on Sicily deteriorated, and Syracuse fell to the Emirate of Sicily in 878. This was ultimately Basil&#x27;s fault as he had diverted a relief fleet from Sicily to haul marble for a church instead. Although most of Sicily was lost, the general Nikephoros Phokas (the Elder) succeeded in taking Taranto and much of Calabria in 880. The successes in the Italian peninsula opened a new period of Byzantine domination there. Above all, the Byzantines were beginning to establish a strong presence in the Mediterranean Sea, and especially the Adriatic.
===Last years and succession===
Basil&#x27;s spirits declined in 879, when his eldest and favourite son, Constantine, died. Basil now raised his youngest son, Alexander, to the rank of co-emperor. Basil disliked the bookish Leo, on occasion physically beating him; he probably suspected Leo of being the son of Michael III. In his later years, Basil&#x27;s relationship with Leo was clouded by the suspicion that the latter might wish to avenge the murder of Michael III. Leo was eventually imprisoned by Basil after Theodore Santabarenos informed him of a plot against him, but the imprisonment resulted in public rioting; Basil threatened to blind Leo but was dissuaded by Patriarch Photios. Leo was eventually released after the passage of three years. Basil died on 29 August 886, from a fever contracted after a serious hunting accident when his belt was caught in the antlers of a deer, and he was allegedly dragged 16 miles through the woods. He was saved by an attendant who cut him loose with a knife, but he suspected the attendant of trying to assassinate him and had the man executed shortly before he himself died. One of the first acts of Leo VI as ruling emperor was to rebury, with great ceremony, the remains of Michael III in the Imperial Mausoleum within the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. This did much to confirm in public opinion the view that Leo considered himself to have been Michael&#x27;s son.

==Family==

Some modern controversy and historical ambiguity surrounds Basil I&#x27;s personal life, especially given a lack of contemporaneous sources. One question that has emerged in modern scholarship is whether or not Basil was involved in same-sex relationships and if such relationships played a role in his unlikely rise to power. Historian Shaun Fitzroy Tougher cites a history written by George the Monk that uses the Greek word &quot;pothos&quot; to describe Basil&#x27;s relationship with Michael, a word which had historically been used in some Greek Christian sources to describe the desire between a wife and a husband. However, within the law code, the &quot;Basilika&quot;, inaugurated by Basil I, the illegal nature of male homosexuality and its, largely theoretical, capital punishment were retained in full.

Aspects of the family relationships of Basil I are likewise uncertain and open to a variety of interpretations.
Therefore, the information given below should not be treated as comprehensive or definite:

*By his first wife Maria, Basil I had several children, including:
**Bardas.
**Anastasia, who married the general Christopher.
**Constantine (c. 860 – 3 September 879), crowned emperor in January 868. According to George Alexandrovič Ostrogorsky, Constantine was betrothed to Ermengard of Provence, daughter of Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor, and Engelberga in 869. The marital contract was broken in 871 when relations between Basil and Louis broke down.
*By Eudokia Ingerina, Basil I had the following children:
**Leo VI, who succeeded as Byzantine emperor and may actually have been a son of Michael III.
**Stephen I, Patriarch of Constantinople, who may also actually have been a son of Michael III.
**Alexander, who succeeded as Byzantine emperor in 912.
**Anna Porphyrogenita, a nun at the convent of St. Euphemia in Petrion.
**Helena Porphyrogenita, a nun at the convent of St. Euphemia in Petrion.
**Maria Porphyrogenita, a mother of nuns at the convent of St. Euphemia in Petrion.

Leo VI&#x27;s son Constantine VII wrote a biography of his grandfather, the &quot;Vita Basilii&quot;, around 950.

==In popular culture==
*Harry Turtledove, a historian noted for his speculative fiction based on alternative history, has written several series set in a place called Videssos, which is a thinly disguised Byzantine Empire. The &quot;Tale of Krispos&quot; trilogy – &quot;Krispos Rising&quot; (1991), &quot;Krispos of Videssos&quot; (1991), and &quot;Krispos the Emperor&quot; (1994) – are fictionalized retellings of the rise of Basil.
*Stephen Lawhead&#x27;s book, &quot;Byzantium&quot; (1996), uses the succession of Basil I as seed for the conspiracy which occupies most of the novel.
*Robert Greene&#x27;s book The 48 Laws of Power (1998), features Basil I&#x27;s rise to power, by way of his interactions and later his manipulations of Michael III, as an example of a &quot;transgression of the law&quot; for Law #2, &quot;Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies&quot;.

<text>Gerald McBoing-Boing is an animated short film about a little boy who speaks through sound effects instead of spoken words. Produced by United Productions of America (UPA), it was given a wide release by Columbia Pictures on November 2, 1950. The story was adapted by Phil Eastman and Bill Scott from a story by Dr. Seuss. Robert Cannon directed the short film, with John Hubley (also a producer) as the supervising director; Stephen Bosustow served as an executive producer. Marvin Miller was the narrator.

&quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing&quot; won the 1950 Oscar for Best Animated Short. In 1994, it was voted #9 of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field, making it the highest ranked UPA cartoon on the list. In 1995, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Original recording, UPA film and sequels==
Dr. Seuss&#x27;s story had originally appeared on a children&#x27;s record, scored by Billy May, issued by Capitol Records, and read by radio veteran Harold Peary as &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot;.

This film was the first successful theatrical cartoon produced by UPA after their initial experiments with a short series of cartoons featuring Columbia Pictures stalwarts the Fox and the Crow. It was an artistic attempt to break away from the strict realism in animation that had been developed and perfected by Walt Disney. Cartoons did not have to obey the rules of the real world (as the short films of Tex Avery and their cartoon physics proved), and so UPA experimented with a non-realistic style that depicted caricatures rather than lifelike representations.

This was a major step in the development of limited animation, which had the added advantage of being much less expensive to produce.

The story describes Gerald McCloy, a two-year-old boy who begins &quot;talking&quot; in the form of sound effects, his first word being the titular &quot;boing boing&quot;. Panicked, his father calls the doctor, who informs him that there is nothing he can do about it. As the boy grows up, he picks up more sounds and is able to make communicative gestures, but is still unable to utter a single word of the English language. In spite of this, he is admitted to a general public school, but more problems arise when he is chided by his peers and given the derogatory name &quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing&quot;. After startling (and enraging) his father, he has no choice but to run away and hop a train to an unknown location. Just before he catches the train, however, a talent scout from the NBC Radio Network (as identified by the NBC chimes) discovers Gerald and hires him as NBC&#x27;s foley artist, performing shows for a division of the company labeled &quot;XYZ&quot; on the microphones, and Gerald becomes very famous.

UPA produced three follow-up shorts: &quot;Gerald McBoing Boing&#x27;s Symphony&quot; (1953), &quot;How Now Boing Boing&quot; (1954), and &quot;Gerald McBoing! Boing! on Planet Moo&quot; (1956), an Academy Award nominee. The second and third films maintained the Dr. Seuss-style rhyming narration, but were not based on his work. The final film abandoned this approach.

All four &quot;Gerald McBoing Boing&quot; shorts were released in 1980 on home video under the title &quot;Columbia Pictures Presents Cartoon Adventures Starring Gerald McBoing Boing&quot;. The shorts were presented in sub-par quality, especially &quot;Planet Moo&quot;, which was squeezed to fit the CinemaScope frame to standard TV screen size. It was reissued in 1985 as part of RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video&#x27;s &quot;Magic Window&quot; series of children&#x27;s videotapes and went out of print in 1995.

The second short was included as a special feature on Sony&#x27;s 2001 DVD release of &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T&quot;. All but the second were included in the special features of the two-disc special edition of the DVD &quot;Hellboy&quot; (released on July 27, 2004), as the cartoon can be seen playing on TV monitors in the background in several scenes. In January 2006, Sony re-issued the four shorts on DVD, featuring cleaned-up prints and all presented in their original aspect ratio.

==Television==
===UPA===
The Gerald McBoing-Boing Show (1956–57)
In 1956, CBS created a half-hour &quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing Show&quot;, with well-known radio announcer Bill Goodwin narrating. Broadcast at 5:30 p.m. on Sunday evenings, it was a showcase for UPA&#x27;s cartoons, including &quot;Dusty of the Circus&quot;, &quot;The Twirlinger Twins&quot;, and &quot;Punch and Judy&quot;. The program proved too expensive to continue and lasted only three months.

The episodes were repeated on Friday nights in the summer of 1957. Thus, &quot;The Gerald McBoing-Boing Show&quot; apparently became the first cartoon series broadcast regularly during prime time, preceding &quot;The Flintstones&quot; by two seasons.

TV specials

A character similar to Gerald McBoing-Boing appeared as Tiny Tim in the 1962 TV special &quot;Mr. Magoo&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, now as a speaking character. A bonus feature of the 2001 &quot;Mr. Magoo&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; DVD features Gerald McBoing-Boing being babysat by the nearsighted Magoo, also a UPA character. The short is titled &quot;Magoo Meets McBoing-Boing&quot;.

===&quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing&quot; (2005–2007)===

A series based on the original cartoon started airing on Cartoon Network (United States) on August 22, 2005, as part of their short-lived &quot;Tickle-U&quot; programming block, and aired on Teletoon/Télétoon (Canada) on August 29 the same year. It uses the same basic art style as the original except more detailed: each 11-minute episode features a series of vignettes with Gerald, of which the &quot;fantasy tales&quot; are done in Seussian rhyme. Sound checks, gags, and &quot;real-life&quot; portions of the show are also included. It was also broadcast on ABC in Australia.

Gerald still only makes sounds (but is praised for it instead), but now has two speaking friends, Janine and Jacob, as well as a dog named Burp, who only burps. Gerald&#x27;s parents (names unknown) complete the regular cast, although his mother has black hair in this series instead of blonde. The series was produced in Canada by Cookie Jar Entertainment, and directed by Robin Budd and story edited/written by John Derevlany. The animation was done by Mercury Filmworks in Ottawa.

==In print==

A children&#x27;s picture book illustrated by Mel Crawford was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1952 and as of 2024 was still in print in multiple formats.

Crawford also illustrated a comic book adaptation of the story for the first issue of the Dell Comics series &quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing and the Nearsighted Mr. Magoo&quot;, also in 1952. Further adventures of the character were portrayed in four more issues of the series published through 1953.

<doc id="73841" wikidata="Q183813" url="?curid=73841" title="Justin II">
<text>Justin II (; ; died 5 October 578) was Eastern Roman emperor from 565 until 578. He was the nephew of Justinian I and the husband of empress Sophia, the niece of the empress Theodora.

Justin II inherited a greatly enlarged but overextended empire, with far fewer resources at his disposal compared to Justinian I. He ended the payment of tributes and adopted a hardline stance against the empire&#x27;s neighbors, which resulted in rekindling of war with the Sassanid Empire, and in a Lombard invasion which cost the Romans much of their territory in Italy.
==Family==
He was a son of Vigilantia and Dulcidio (sometimes rendered as Dulcissimus), respectively the sister and brother-in-law of Justinian. His siblings included Marcellus and Praejecta. With Sophia he had a daughter Arabia and possibly a son, Justus, who died young. He also had a niece named Helena.

==Early life==

During Justinian&#x27;s reign, he served in the position of &quot;curopalates&quot; at the court. He is first attested in the sources from 552 and 553 as being part of the embassy to Pope Vigilius during the Three-Chapter Controversy. 

In 559, he was sent by Justinian to escort the Kutrigur raiders retreating across the Danube. In 562 and 563, he was in charge of dissipating the urban riots caused by the circus factions in Constantinople. 

Over time, he built a network of supporters in the court. In the early 560s, his wife Sophia and his supporters were said to have pleaded with Justinian to name him &quot;caesar&quot;, albeit unsuccessfully. 

==Reign==

=== Accession ===
Justinian I died childless on 14 November 565. , the &quot;praepositus sacri cubiculi&quot;, seems to have been the only witness to his dying moments, and claimed that Justinian had designated Justin, his nephew, as his heir in a deathbed decision. This sidelined another relative and candidate for the throne, also named Justin, who was son of Germanus, cousin of Justinian. Modern historians suspect Callinicus may have fabricated the last words of Justinian to secure the succession for his political ally. As historian Robert Browning observed: &quot;Did Justinian really bring himself in the end to make a choice, or did Callinicus make it for him? Only Callinicus knew.&quot;

In any case, Callinicus started alerting those most interested in the succession, originally various members of the Senate. Then they jointly informed Justin and Sophia, offering the throne. Justin accepted after the traditional token show of reluctance, and with his wife Sophia, he was escorted to the Great Palace of Constantinople. The Excubitors blocked the palace entrances during the night, and early in the morning, John Scholasticus, Patriarch of Constantinople, crowned the new &quot;Augustus&quot;. Only then was the death of Justinian and the succession of Justin publicly announced in the Hippodrome of Constantinople. Justin&#x27;s coronation was written in detail by Corippus in his panegyric &quot;In laudem lustini Augusti minoris (In praise of Justin the Younger)&quot;.

Both the Patriarch and Tiberius, commander of the Excubitors, had been recently appointed, with Justin having played a part in their respective appointments, in his role as Justinian&#x27;s &quot;curopalates&quot;. It is thus seen that they were willing to elevate their patron and ally to the throne.

Justin&#x27;s first address to the senate contained criticisms of Justinian: &quot;Let the world rejoice that whatever was not done or put into practice because of our father’s old age has been corrected in the time of Justin.&quot; In the speech, he vowed to repay debts, restore the emptied treasury and promised not to confiscate senatorial properties.

===Early reign===

In the early days of his reign Justin paid his uncle&#x27;s debts and took a more reconciliatory stance toward the senatorial class. On 1 January 566, he became a consul, thereby reviving a post Justinian had discontinued since 541. Justin and Sophia initially promised to make peace with Justin&#x27;s cousin and rival to the throne, Justin (son of Germanus), but had him assassinated in Alexandria not long after. According to a hostile source, the imperial couple kicked his severed head.

In 566 he reversed Justinian&#x27;s ban on divorce by mutual consent, declaring that it resulted in spouses hating each other. Under the pretext of not understanding the fragile human nature:
===Administration and financial policy===
After Justin paid off the debts, he burned the bonds of the treasury. He additionally remitted his subjects&#x27; tax arrears back to 560. The contemporary John of Ephesus notes a rumour that his successor Tiberius II discovered piles of money Justin and Sophia gathered, possibly meaning that his reign generated a surplus.

He conceded greater control to the provincial elites. In 569, he allowed them to nominate their own governors, and if the nominees pleased the court, eliminated their appointment fees, resulting in less imperial oversight of the provinces.

=== Foreign policy ===
He discontinued Justinian&#x27;s practice of buying off potential enemies. Immediately after his accession, Justin halted the payment of subsidies to the Avars, ending a truce that had existed since 558. This move upset the delicate balance of power in the Pannonian Basin, since the Avar elites were forced to seek new sources of wealth to maintain their position and client networks. At first, this was agreeable for the Romans, since the Avars decided to raid the Franks instead of going into the Roman territory. But after the Avars and the neighbouring tribe of the Lombards had combined to destroy the Gepids, from whom Justin had obtained the Danube fortress of Sirmium, Avar pressure caused the Lombards to migrate West, and in 568 they invaded Italy under their king Alboin. They quickly overran the Po Valley, and within a few years they had made themselves masters of nearly the entire country. The Avars themselves crossed the Danube in 573 or 574, when the Empire&#x27;s attention was distracted by troubles on the Persian frontier. They were only placated by the payment of a subsidy of 60,000 silver pieces by Justin&#x27;s successor Tiberius.

The North and East frontiers were the main focus of Justin&#x27;s attention. Justin began to cement an alliance with the Turks, the new Central Asian power that threatened both the Avars and Persia from the mid 6th century. In 572 his refusal to pay tribute to the Persians in combination with overtures to the Turks led to a war with the Sassanid Empire. After two disastrous campaigns, in which the Persians under Khosrow I overran Syria and captured the strategically important fortress of Dara, Justin became inflicted with a severe mental illness.

Shortly after the smuggling of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire from China by Nestorian Christian monks, the 6th-century Byzantine historian Menander Protector writes of how the Sogdians attempted to establish a direct trade of Chinese silk with the Byzantine Empire. After forming an alliance with the Sassanid ruler Khosrow I to defeat the Hephthalite Empire, Istämi, the Göktürk ruler of the Western Turkic Khaganate, was approached by Sogdian merchants requesting permission to seek an audience with the Sassanid king of kings for the privilege of traveling through Persian territories in order to trade with the Byzantines. Istämi refused the first request, but when he sanctioned the second one and had the Sogdian embassy sent to the Sassanid king, the latter had the members of the embassy poisoned to death. Maniah, a Sogdian diplomat, convinced Istämi to send an embassy directly to Constantinople, which arrived in 568 and offered not only silk as a gift to Justin, but also proposed an alliance against Sassanid Persia. Justin agreed and sent an embassy to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct silk trade desired by the Sogdians.

His foreign policy has received unfavorable assessments in the 20th century.

== Succession and death ==

After 572, Justin was reported to have fits of insanity. John of Ephesus, whose Monophysite sect suffered persecutions under Justin, offered a vivid description of Justin&#x27;s madness, in which he behaved like a wild animal, was wheeled about on a mobile throne and required organ music to be played day and night.

Despite moments of clarity, Justin was no longer able to govern. Eastern Roman sources report that Tiberius, the commander of the Excubitors, directed the government from this point, alongside Sophia. In 574, about a year after his incapacitation, Justin elevated Tiberius as &quot;caesar&quot; at Sophia&#x27;s suggestion and adopted him as his son. On 7 December, according to Theophylact Simocatta, Justin remained sufficiently clear-minded to make an eloquent speech as he passed the crown:

Four years later, on 26 September 578, he elevated Tiberius as &quot;Augustus&quot;. Justin died only nine days later, on 5 October 578.

<text>Gertie the Dinosaur is a 1914 animated short film by American cartoonist and animator Winsor McCay. It is the first animated film to feature a dinosaur. McCay initially presented the film before live audiences as an interactive part of his vaudeville act; the frisky, childlike Gertie performed tricks at her master&#x27;s command. McCay&#x27;s employer William Randolph Hearst curtailed his vaudeville activities, prompting McCay to add a live-action introductory sequence to the film for its theatrical release, which was renamed Winsor McCay, the Famous Cartoonist, and Gertie. McCay abandoned a sequel, &quot;Gertie on Tour&quot; (), after producing about a minute of footage.

Although &quot;Gertie&quot; is popularly thought to be the earliest animated film, McCay had previously made &quot;Little Nemo&quot; (1911) and &quot;How a Mosquito Operates&quot; (1912). The American J. Stuart Blackton and the French Émile Cohl had experimented with animation even earlier. Gertie being a character with an appealing personality distinguished McCay&#x27;s film from these earlier &quot;trick films&quot;. &quot;Gertie&quot; was the first film to employ several animation techniques, like keyframes, registration marks, tracing paper, the Mutoscope action viewer, and animation loops. It influenced the next generation of animators, including the Fleischer brothers, Otto Messmer, Paul Terry, Walter Lantz, and Walt Disney. John Randolph Bray unsuccessfully tried to patent many of McCay&#x27;s animation techniques and is said to have been behind a plagiarized version of &quot;Gertie&quot; that appeared a year or two after the original. &quot;Gertie&quot; is the best preserved of McCay&#x27;s films—some of which have been lost or survive only in fragments—and has been preserved in the U.S. Library of Congress&#x27; National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; since 1991.

== Background ==
Winsor McCay ( – 1934) had already worked prolifically as a commercial artist and cartoonist by the time he began creating newspaper comic strips such as &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot; (1904–1911) and his signature strip &quot;Little Nemo&quot; (1905–1914). In 1906, McCay began performing on the vaudeville circuit, doing chalk talks—performances in which he drew before live audiences.

Inspired by the flip books his son brought home, McCay recognized the potential to create &quot;moving pictures&quot; from his cartoons. He claimed to be the first man in the world to make animated cartoons, but he was preceded by the American James Stuart Blackton and the French Émile Cohl. McCay&#x27;s first film starred his &quot;Little Nemo&quot; characters and debuted in movie theatres in 1911; he soon incorporated it into his vaudeville act. He followed it in 1912 with &quot;How a Mosquito Operates&quot;, in which a giant, naturalistically animated mosquito sucks the blood of a sleeping man. McCay gave the mosquito a personality and balanced humor with the horror of the nightmarish situation. His animation was criticized as being so lifelike that he must have traced the characters from photographs or resorted to tricks using wires. To show that he had not, McCay chose for his next film a creature that could not have been photographed.

In 1912, McCay consulted with the American Historical Society and announced plans to create a presentation featuring depictions of the great monsters that once roamed the earth. He spoke of the &quot;serious and educational work&quot; that the animation process could enable. McCay had earlier introduced dinosaurs into his comic strip work, like the March 4, 1905, episode of &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot; in which a &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; skeleton took part in a horse race, and the May 25, 1913, &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; episode in which a hunter unsuccessfully targets a dinosaur; the layout of the background to the latter bore a strong resemblance to what later appeared in &quot;Gertie&quot;. In the September 21, 1913, episode of McCay&#x27;s &quot;Little Nemo&quot; strip &quot;In the Land of Wonderful Dreams&quot;, titled &quot;In the Land of the Antediluvians&quot;, Nemo meets a blue dinosaur named Bessie which has the same design as that of Gertie.

McCay considered a number of names before settling on &quot;Gertie&quot;; his production notebooks used &quot;Jessie the &quot;. Disney animator Paul Satterfield recalled hearing McCay in 1915 relate how he had chosen the name &quot;Gertie&quot;:

== Content ==

&quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot; is the earliest animated film to feature a dinosaur. Its star Gertie performs tricks much like a trained elephant. She is animated in a naturalistic style unprecedented for the time; she breathes rhythmically, shifts her weight as she moves, and her abdominal muscles undulate as she draws water. McCay imbued her with a personality—while friendly, she could be capricious, ignoring or rebelling against her master&#x27;s commands.

=== Synopsis ===
The frisky, childlike Gertie appears from a cave after being called by her master McCay, eating a boulder and a tree on the way. The whip-wielding McCay orders her to do tricks like raising her foot or bowing to the audience. After being distracted by a sea serpent, Gertie nips back at her master. McCay scolds Gertie for this, which makes her cry, and he subsequently placates her with a pumpkin. Gertie eats the leftover tree trunk, and tosses a mammoth named Jumbo into the lake; when Jumbo teases her by spraying her with water, she hurls a boulder at it as it swims away. After a flying lizard catches Gertie&#x27;s attention, she quenches her thirst by draining the lake. McCay then has her carry him offstage while he bows to the audience.

In the live-action framing story added for later distribution, McCay and friends suffer a flat tire in front of the American Museum of Natural History. They enter the museum and, while viewing a &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; skeleton, McCay wagers a dinner that he can bring a dinosaur to life with his animation skills. The animation process and its &quot;10,000 drawings, each a little different from the one preceding it&quot; is put on display, with humorous scenes of mountains of paper, some of which an assistant drops. When the film is finished, the friends gather to view it in a restaurant.

== Production ==
&quot;Gertie&quot; was McCay&#x27;s first piece of animation with detailed backgrounds. Main production began in mid-1913. Working in his spare time, McCay drew thousands of frames of Gertie on sheets of rice paper, a medium good for drawing as it did not absorb ink. Since it was translucent, it was also ideal for the laborious retracing of backgrounds, a job that fell to art student neighbor John A. Fitzsimmons. The drawings themselves occupied a area of the paper, marked with registration marks in the corners to reduce jittering of the images when filmed. They were photographed mounted on large pieces of stiff cardboard.

McCay was concerned with accurate timing and motion; he timed his own breathing to determine the timing of Gertie&#x27;s breathing, and included subtle details such as the ground sagging beneath Gertie&#x27;s weight. McCay consulted with New York museum staff to ensure the accuracy of Gertie&#x27;s movements; the staff were unable to help him find out how an extinct animal would stand up from a lying position, so in a scene in which Gertie stood up, McCay had a flying lizard come on screen to draw away viewers&#x27; attention. When the drawings were finished, they were photographed at Vitagraph Studios in early 1914.

McCay pioneered the &quot;McCay Split System&quot; of animation, in which major poses or positions were drawn first and the intervening frames drawn after. This relieved tedium and improved the timing of the film&#x27;s actions. McCay was open about the techniques that he developed, and refused to patent his system, reportedly saying: &quot;Any idiot that wants to make a couple of thousand drawings for a hundred feet of film is welcome to join the club.&quot; During production of &quot;Gertie&quot;, he showed the details to a visitor who claimed to be writing an article about animation. The visitor was animator John Randolph Bray, who sued McCay in 1914 after taking advantage of McCay&#x27;s lapse to patent many of the techniques, including the use of registration marks, tracing paper, and the Mutoscope action viewer, as well as the cycling of drawings to create repetitive action. The suit was unsuccessful, and there is evidence that McCay may have countersued—he received royalty payments from Bray for licensing the techniques.

== Release ==
&quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot; first appeared as part of McCay&#x27;s vaudeville act in early 1914. It appeared in movie theaters in an edition with a live-action prologue, distributed by William Fox&#x27;s Box Office Attractions Company from December 28. Dinosaurs were still new to the public imagination at the time of Gertie&#x27;s release—a &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; skeleton was put on public display for the first time in 1905. Advertisements reflected this by trying to educate audiences: &quot;According to science this monster once ruled this planet  ... Skeletons now being unearthed measuring from 90 ft. to 160 ft. in length. An elephant should be a mouse beside Gertie.&quot;

=== Vaudeville ===
McCay originally used a version of the film as part of his vaudeville act. The first performance was on February 8, 1914, in Chicago at the Palace Theater. McCay began the show making his customary live sketches, which he followed with &quot;How a Mosquito Operates&quot;. He then appeared on stage with a whip and lectured the audience on the making of animation. Standing to the right of the film screen, he introduced &quot;the only dinosaur in captivity&quot;. As the film started, Gertie poked her head out of a cave, and McCay encouraged her to come forward. He reinforced the illusion with tricks such as tossing a cardboard apple at the screen, at which point he turned his back to the audience and pocketed the apple as it appeared in the film for Gertie to eat. For the finale, McCay walked offstage from where he &quot;reappeared&quot; in the film; Gertie lifted up the animated McCay, placed him on her back, and walked away as McCay bowed to the audience.

The show soon moved to New York. Though reviews were positive, McCay&#x27;s employer at the &quot;New York American&quot;, newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, was displeased that his star cartoonist&#x27;s vaudeville schedule interrupted his work illustrating editorials. At Hearst&#x27;s orders, reviews of McCay&#x27;s shows disappeared from the &quot;American&quot;″s pages. Shortly after, Hearst refused to run paid advertisements from the Victoria Theater, where McCay performed in New York. On March 8, Hearst announced a ban on artists in his employ from performing in vaudeville. McCay&#x27;s contract did not prohibit him from his vaudeville performances, but Hearst was able to pressure McCay and his agents to cancel bookings, and eventually McCay signed a new contract barring him from performing outside of greater New York.

=== Movie theaters ===
In November 1914, film producer William Fox offered to market &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot; to moving-picture theaters for &quot;spot cash and highest prices&quot;. McCay accepted, and extended the film to include a live-action prologue and intertitles to replace his stage patter. The film successfully traveled the country and had reached the west coast by December.

The live-action sequence was likely shot on November 19, 1914. It features McCay with several of his friends, such as cartoonists George McManus and Tad Dorgan, writer Roy McCardell, and actor Tom Powers; McCay&#x27;s son Robert had a cameo as a camera-room assistant. McCay used a bet as a plot device, as he had previously in the &quot;Little Nemo&quot; film.

=== 2018 reconstruction of McCay&#x27;s vaudeville act ===
Using extant original drawings by McCay, David L. Nathan reconstructed the lost &quot;Encore&quot; sequence from McCay&#x27;s original vaudeville version. He initiated a restoration of the entire film and, with animation historian Donald Crafton, proposed a reconstruction of McCay&#x27;s vaudeville performance. Crafton, Nathan and Marco de Blois of the Cinémathèque québécoise worked with a team of professionals from the National Film Board of Canada to complete the project, which premiered live during the closing ceremony of the 2018 Annecy International Animated Film Festival in France.

== McCay and animation after &quot;Gertie&quot; ==
McCay&#x27;s working method was laborious, and animators developed a number of methods to reduce the workload and speed production to meet the demand for animated films. Within a few years of &quot;Nemo&quot;″s release, Canadian Raoul Barré&#x27;s registration pegs combined with American Earl Hurd&#x27;s cel technology became near-universal methods in animation studios. McCay used cel technology in his follow-up to &quot;Gertie&quot;, &quot;The Sinking of the Lusitania&quot; (1918). It was his most ambitious film at 25,000 drawings, and took nearly two years to complete, but was not a commercial success.

Around 1921, McCay worked on a second animated film featuring Gertie, titled &quot;Gertie on Tour&quot;. The film was to have Gertie bouncing on the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, attempting to eat the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C., wading in on the Atlantic City shore, and other scenes. The film exists only in concept sketches and in two minutes of film footage in which Gertie plays with a trolley and dances before other dinosaurs.

McCay made six more films, though three of them were never made commercially available. After 1921, McCay was made to give up animation when Hearst learned he devoted more of his time to animation than to his newspaper illustrations. Unexecuted ideas McCay had for animation projects included a collaboration with &quot;Jungle Imps&quot; author George Randolph Chester, a musical film called &quot;The Barnyard Band&quot;, and a film about the Americans&#x27; role in World War I. 

In 1927, McCay attended a dinner in his honor in New York. After a considerable amount of drinking, McCay was introduced by animator Max Fleischer. McCay gave the gathered group of animators some technical advice, but when he felt the audience was not giving him attention, he berated them, saying: &quot;Animation is an art. That is how I conceived it. But as I see, what you fellows have done with it, is making it into a trade. Not an art, but a trade. &quot;Bad Luck!&quot;&quot; That September he appeared on the radio at WNAC, and on November 2 Frank Craven interviewed him for &quot;The Evening Journal&quot;″s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;. During both appearances he complained about the state of contemporary animation. McCay died on July 26, 1934, of a cerebral embolism.

== Reception and legacy ==
=== Reviews ===
&quot;Gertie&quot; pleased audiences and reviewers. It won the praise of drama critic Ashton Stevens in Chicago, where the act opened. On February 22, 1914, before Hearst had barred the &quot;New York American&quot; from mentioning McCay&#x27;s vaudeville work, a columnist in the paper called the act &quot;a laugh from start to finish  ... far funnier than his noted mosquito drawings&quot;. On February 28, the &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot; called it &quot;the greatest act in the history of motion picture cartoonists&quot;. Émile Cohl praised McCay&#x27;s &quot;admirably drawn&quot; films, and &quot;Gertie&quot; in particular, after seeing them in New York before he returned to Europe. Upon its theatrical release, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine wrote the film had &quot;plenty of comedy throughout&quot; and that it would &quot;always be remarked upon as exceptionally clever&quot;. In 1994, &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot; was voted number six of the 50 Greatest Cartoons by members of the animation field.

&quot;New York Times&quot; film critic Richard Eder, on seeing a retrospective of McCay&#x27;s animation at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1975, wrote of &quot;Gertie&quot; that &quot;Disney  ... struggled mightily to recapture&quot; the qualities in McCay&#x27;s animation, but that &quot;Disney&#x27;s magic, though sometimes scary, was always contained; McCay&#x27;s approached necromancy&quot;. Eder compared McCay&#x27;s artistic vision to that of poet William Blake, saying that &quot;it was too strange and personal to be generalized or to have any children&quot;.

&quot;Gertie&quot; has been written about in numerous books and articles. Animation historian Donald Crafton called &quot;Gertie&quot; &quot;the enduring masterpiece of pre-Disney animation&quot;. Brothers Simon and Kim Deitch loosely based their graphic novel &quot;The Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot; (2002) on McCay&#x27;s disillusionment with the animation industry in the 1920s. The story features an aged cartoonist named Winsor Newton, who in his younger years had a &quot;Gertie&quot;-like stage act featuring a mastodon named Milton. &quot;Gertie&quot; has been selected for preservation in the U.S. Library of Congress&#x27; National Film Registry. 

=== Legacy ===
A fake version of &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot; appeared a year or two after the original; it features a dinosaur performing most of Gertie&#x27;s tricks, but with less skillful animation, using cels on a static background. It is not known for certain who produced the film, though its style is believed to be that of Bray Productions. Filmmaker Buster Keaton rode the back of a clay-animated dinosaur in homage to &quot;Gertie&quot; in &quot;Three Ages&quot; (1923).

McCay&#x27;s first three films were the earliest animated works to have a commercial impact; their success motivated film studios to join the infant animation industry. Other studios used McCay&#x27;s combination of live action with animation, such as the Fleischer Studios series &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; (1918–1929) and Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; series (1923–1927). McCay&#x27;s clean-line, high-contrast, realistic style set the pattern for American animation to come, and set it apart from the abstract, open forms of animation in Europe. This legacy is most apparent in the feature films of the Walt Disney Animation Studios, such as &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940), which included anthropomorphic dinosaurs animated in a naturalistic style with careful attention to timing and weight. Shamus Culhane, Dave and Max Fleischer, Walter Lantz, Otto Messmer, Pat Sullivan, Paul Terry, and Bill Tytla were among the generation of American animators who drew inspiration from the films they saw in McCay&#x27;s vaudeville act. &quot;Gertie&quot;″s reputation was such that animation histories long named it as the first animated film.

Since his death, McCay&#x27;s original artwork has been poorly preserved. Much was destroyed in a late-1930s house fire, and more was sold off when the McCays needed money. About 400 original drawings from the film have been preserved, discovered by animator Robert Brotherton in disarray in Irving Mendelsohn&#x27;s fabric shop, into whose care McCay&#x27;s films and artwork had been entrusted in the 1940s. Besides some cels from &quot;The Sinking of the Lusitania&quot;, these &quot;Gertie&quot; drawings are the only original animation artwork of McCay&#x27;s to have survived. McCay destroyed many of his original cans of film to create more storage space. Of what he kept, not much has survived, as it was photographed on nitrate film, which deteriorates and is flammable. A pair of young animators discovered the film in 1947 and preserved what they could. In many cases only fragments could be saved, if anything at all. Of all of McCay&#x27;s films, &quot;Gertie&quot; is the best preserved, and has been kept in the U.S. Library of Congress&#x27; National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; since 1991. Mendelsohn and Brotherton tried fruitlessly to find an institution to store McCay&#x27;s films until the Cinémathèque québécoise, a Canadian film conservatory, approached them in 1967 on the occasion of that year&#x27;s World Animation Film Exposition in Montreal. The Cinémathèque québécoise has since curated McCay&#x27;s films. Of the surviving drawings, fifteen have been determined not to appear in extant copies of the film. They appear to come from a single sequence, likely at the close of the film, and have Gertie showing her head from the audience&#x27;s right and giving a bow.
McCay&#x27;s son Robert unsuccessfully attempted to revive Gertie with a comic strip called &quot;Dino&quot;. He and Disney animator Richard Huemer recreated the original vaudeville performance for the &quot;Disneyland&quot; television program in 1955; this was the first exposure the film had for that generation. Walt Disney expressed to the younger McCay his feeling of debt, and gestured to the Disney studios saying, &quot;Bob, all this should be your father&#x27;s.&quot; An ice cream shop in the shape of Gertie sits by Echo Lake in Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World. The first known specimen of the dinosaur &quot;Chindesaurus&quot;, discovered in Arizona&#x27;s Petrified Forest National Park in 1985, has been nicknamed Gertie after the cartoon, although unlike Gertie, &quot;Chindesaurus&quot; is not a sauropod.

<text>The BMW 328 was a sports car produced by BMW from 1936 to 1940. Its body design is credited to Peter Szymanowski, who became BMW chief of design after World War II (although technically the car was designed by Fritz Fiedler).

==Specifications==
==Awards==
In 1999 the BMW 328 was named one of 25 finalists for Car of the Century by a worldwide panel of automotive journalists.

==Motorsports==

The 328 was introduced at the Eifelrennen race at the Nürburgring in 1936, where Ernst Henne drove it to win the 2.0-litre class. The 328 had more than 100 class wins in 1937, including the RAC Tourist Trophy, the Österreichische Alpenfahrt, and the La Turbie hillclimb. In 1938, the 328 won its class at the RAC Tourist Trophy, the Alpine Rally, and the Mille Miglia.

The 328 won the RAC Rally in 1939 and came in fifth overall and first in class in the 1939 24 Hours of Le Mans.

Frank Pratt won the 1948 Australian Grand Prix driving a 328.

===Mille Miglia===
In 1938, BMW 328 became a class winner in Mille Miglia.

In 1940, the Mille Miglia Touring Coupe won the Mille Miglia with an average speed of .

In 2004, the BMW 328 Mille Miglia Touring Coupe became the first car to win both the Mille Miglia (1940) and the modern-day classical version of the race.

==Production==
After the Second World War, the manufacturing plant in Eisenach where the 328 had been built found itself in the Soviet occupation zone, and automobile manufacturing in Eisenach would follow a state-directed path until German Reunification in 1989.

==Influence on Bristol==
One of the Mille Miglia 328s (disguised as a Frazer Nash) and BMW&#x27;s technical plans for the car were taken from the bombed BMW factory by English representatives from the Bristol Aeroplane Company and Frazer Nash companies. Fiedler, the BMW engineer, was persuaded to come, too. Bristol Cars was set up to build complete cars, called Bristols, and would also supply engines to Frazer Nash for all their post-war cars. The first Bristol car, the 400, was heavily based on the BMW plans.
This Bristol engine was also an option in AC cars, before the Cobra.

<doc id="73874" wikidata="Q42021" url="?curid=73874" title="Justinian II">
<text>Justinian II (; ; 668/69 – 4 November 711), nicknamed &quot;the Slit-Nosed&quot; (), was the last Byzantine emperor of the Heraclian dynasty, reigning from 685 to 695 and again from 705 to 711. Like his namesake, Justinian I, Justinian II was an ambitious and passionate ruler who was keen to restore the Roman Empire to its former glories. However, he responded brutally to any opposition to his will and lacked the finesse of his father, Constantine IV. Consequently, he generated enormous opposition to his reign, resulting in his deposition in 695 in a popular uprising. He only returned to the throne in 705 with the help of a Bulgar and Slav army. His second reign was even more despotic than the first, and in 711 he was killed by mutinous soldiers.

==First reign==
Justinian II was the eldest son of Emperor Constantine IV and Anastasia. His father appointed him as his heir sometime after October 682, upon the deposition of his uncles Heraclius and Tiberius. In 685, at the age of sixteen, Justinian II succeeded his father as sole emperor.

As a result of Constantine IV&#x27;s victories, the political situation in the Eastern provinces of the Empire was stable when Justinian ascended the throne. After a preliminary strike against the Arabs in Armenia, Justinian managed to augment the sum paid by the Umayyad Caliphs as an annual tribute, and to regain control of part of Cyprus. The incomes of the provinces of Armenia and Iberia were divided among the two empires. In 687, as part of his agreements with the Caliphate, Justinian removed from their native Lebanon 12,000 Christian Maronites, who continually resisted the Arabs. Additional resettlement efforts, aimed at the Mardaites and inhabitants of Cyprus, allowed Justinian to reinforce naval forces depleted by earlier conflicts. In 688, Justinian signed a treaty with the Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan which rendered Cyprus neutral ground, with its tax revenue split.

This enabled Justinian to turn his attention to the Balkans, where much imperial territory had been lost to Slavic tribes. In 687 Justinian transferred cavalry troops from Anatolia to Thrace. With a great military campaign in 688–689, Justinian defeated the Slavs of Macedonia and was finally able to enter Thessalonica, the second most important Byzantine city in Europe.

The subdued Slavs were resettled in Anatolia, where they were to provide a military force of 30,000 men. Emboldened by the increase of his forces in Anatolia, Justinian now renewed the war against the Arabs, winning a battle in Armenia in 693. The Arabs met the challenge by bribing the new army to revolt. Most of the Slavic troops defected during the subsequent Battle of Sebastopolis, where Justinian was comprehensively defeated and compelled to flee to the Propontis. There, according to Theophanes, he vented his frustration by slaughtering as many of the Slavs in and around Opsikion as he could lay his hands on. Meanwhile, a Patrician named Symbatius rebelled in Armenia and opened up the province to the Arabs, who proceeded to conquer it in 694–695.

In domestic affairs, the Emperor&#x27;s bloody persecution of the Manichaeans, and his suppression of the popular traditions of those who were not of Chalcedonian origin, caused dissension within the Church. In 692 Justinian convened the so-called Quinisext Council at Constantinople to put his religious policies into effect. The Council expanded and clarified the rulings of the Fifth and Sixth ecumenical councils, but by highlighting differences between the Eastern and Western observances (such as the marriage of priests and the Catholic practice of fasting on Saturdays) it also compromised Byzantine relations with the Catholic Church. The emperor ordered Pope Sergius I arrested, but the militias of Rome and Ravenna sided with the Pope and rebelled.

Justinian contributed to the development of the thematic organization of the Empire, creating a new theme of Hellas in southern Greece and numbering the heads of the four major themes of the Opsikion, Anatolikon, Thracesion and Armeniakon, and the naval Karabisianoi corps, among the senior administrators of the Empire. He also sought to protect the rights of peasant freeholders (who served as the main recruitment pool for the imperial armies) against attempts by the aristocracy to acquire their land. This put him in direct conflict with some of the largest landholders in the Empire.

While his land policies threatened the aristocracy, his tax policy was very unpopular with the common people. Through his agents Stephen and Theodotos, the emperor raised the funds to gratify his sumptuous tastes and his mania for erecting costly buildings. This, plus ongoing religious discontent, conflicts with the aristocracy, and displeasure with his resettlement policy eventually drove his subjects into rebellion. In 695 the population rose under the leadership of Leontius, the &quot;strategos&quot; of Hellas, and proclaimed him Emperor. Justinian was deposed and his nose was cut off (later to be replaced by a solid gold replica of his original) to prevent his again seeking the throne: such mutilation was common in Byzantine culture. He was exiled to Cherson in the Crimea. Leontius, after a reign of three years, was in turn dethroned and imprisoned by Apsimarus, who then assumed the throne.

==Exile==
While in exile, Justinian began to plot and gather supporters for an attempt to retake the throne. Justinian became a liability to Cherson and the authorities decided to return him to Constantinople in 702 or 703. He escaped from Cherson and received help from Busir, the khagan of the Khazars, who received him enthusiastically and gave him his sister as a bride. Justinian renamed her Theodora, after the wife of Justinian I. They were given a home in the town of Phanagoria, at the entrance to the sea of Azov. Busir was offered a bribe by Tiberius to kill his brother-in-law, and dispatched two Khazar officials, Papatzys and Balgitzin, to do the deed. Warned by his wife, Justinian executed Papatzys and Balgitzin. He sailed in a fishing boat to Cherson, summoned his supporters, and they all sailed westwards across the Black Sea.

As the ship bearing Justinian sailed along the northern coast of the Black Sea, he and his crew became caught up in a storm somewhere between the mouths of the Dniester and the Dnieper Rivers. While it was raging, one of his companions reached out to Justinian saying that if he promised God that he would be magnanimous, and not seek revenge on his enemies when he was returned to the throne, they would all be spared. Justinian retorted: &quot;If I spare a single one of them, may God drown me here&quot;.

Having survived the storm, Justinian next approached Tervel of Bulgaria. Tervel agreed to provide all the military assistance necessary for Justinian to regain his throne in exchange for financial considerations, the award of a &quot;Caesar&quot;&#x27;s crown, and the hand of Justinian&#x27;s daughter, Anastasia, in marriage. In spring 705, with an army of 15,000 Bulgar and Slav horsemen, Justinian appeared before the walls of Constantinople. For three days, Justinian tried to convince the citizens of Constantinople to open the gates, but to no avail. Unable to take the city by force, he and some companions entered through an unused water conduit under the walls of the city, roused their supporters, and seized control of the city in a midnight coup d&#x27;état. On 21 August, Justinian regained the throne, breaking the tradition preventing the mutilated from Imperial rule. After tracking down his predecessors, he had his rivals Leontius and Tiberius brought before him in chains in the Hippodrome. There, before a jeering populace, Justinian, now wearing a golden nasal prosthesis, placed his feet on the necks of Tiberius and Leontius in a symbolic gesture of subjugation before ordering their execution by beheading, followed by many of their partisans, as well as deposing, blinding and exiling Patriarch Callinicus I to Rome.

==Second reign==

Justinian&#x27;s second reign was marked by unsuccessful warfare against Bulgaria and the Caliphate, and by cruel suppression of opposition at home. In 708 Justinian turned on Bulgarian Khan Tervel, whom he had earlier crowned &quot;caesar&quot;, and invaded Bulgaria, apparently seeking to recover the territories ceded to Tervel as a reward for his support in 705. The Emperor was defeated, blockaded in Anchialus, and forced to retreat. Peace between Bulgaria and Byzantium was quickly restored. This defeat was followed by Arab victories in Asia Minor, where the cities of Cilicia fell into the hands of the enemy, who penetrated into Cappadocia in 709–711.

He ordered Pope John VII to recognize the decisions of the Quinisext Council and simultaneously fitted out a punitive expedition against Ravenna in 709 under the command of the Patrician Theodore. The expedition was led to reinstate the Western Church&#x27;s authority over Ravenna, which was taken as a sign of disobedience to the emperor, and revolutionary sentiment. The repression succeeded, and the new Pope Constantine visited Constantinople in 710. Justinian, after receiving Holy Communion at the hands of the pope, renewed all the privileges of the Roman Church. Exactly what passed between them on the subject of the Quinisext Council is not known. It would appear, however, that Constantine approved most of the canons. This would be the last time a Pope visited the city until the visit of Pope Paul VI to Istanbul in 1967.
Justinian&#x27;s rule provoked another uprising against him. Cherson revolted, and under the leadership of the exiled general Bardanes the city held out against a counter-attack. Soon, the forces sent to suppress the rebellion joined it. The rebels then seized the capital and proclaimed Bardanes as Emperor Philippicus; Justinian had been on his way to Armenia, and was unable to return to Constantinople in time to defend it. He was arrested and executed in November 711, his head being exhibited in Rome and Ravenna.

On hearing the news of his death, Justinian&#x27;s mother took his six-year-old son and co-emperor, Tiberius, to sanctuary at St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Blachernae, but was pursued by Philippicus&#x27; henchmen, who dragged the child from the altar and, once outside the church, murdered him, thus eradicating the line of Heraclius.

==Legacy==
Justinian&#x27;s reign saw the continued slow and ongoing process of transformation of the Byzantine Empire, as the traditions inherited from the ancient Latin Roman state were gradually being eroded. This is most clearly seen in the coinage of Justinian&#x27;s reign, which saw the reintroduction of the Loros, the traditional consular costume that had not been seen on Imperial coinage for a century, while the office itself had not been celebrated for nearly half a century. This was linked to Justinian&#x27;s decision to unify the office of consul with that of emperor, thus making the Emperor the head of state not only de facto but also de jure. Although the office of the consulate continued to exist until Emperor Leo VI the Wise formally abolished it with Novel 94, it was Justinian who effectively ended its status as a separate political entity. He was formally appointed as Consul in 686, subsequently adopting the title for all the Julian years of his reign, consecutively numbered.

Though at times undermined by his own despotic tendencies, Justinian was a talented and perceptive ruler who succeeded in improving the standing of the Byzantine Empire. A pious ruler, Justinian was the first emperor to include the image of Christ on coinage issued in his name and attempted to outlaw various pagan festivals and practices that persisted in the Empire. He may have self-consciously modelled himself on his namesake, Justinian I, as seen in his enthusiasm for large-scale construction projects and the renaming of his Khazar wife as Theodora. Among the building projects he undertook was the creation of the &quot;triklinos&quot;, an extension to the imperial palace, a decorative cascade fountain located at the &quot;Augusteum&quot;, and a new Church of the Virgin at Petrion.

The veneration of Justinian II in the Orthodox Church is the subject of debate and confusion, as there are discrepancies in different Synaxarions. The Synaxarion of Constantinople from the 10th century lists the commemoration of the &quot;Emperor Justinian&quot;, giving no reference of the emperor&#x27;s life or whether it is Justinian I or II. Contemporary footnotes comment that this must be Justinian II, since Justinian I died in heresy, a position not held by the Orthodox Church today. According to Saint Nikodemos the Hagiorite, Emperor Justinian II was a bad man who lived a bad life, and he could not imagine that he would be commemorated as a saint, since in the Synaxarion of Saint Kallinikos of Constantinople on August 23, it does not say he died in repentance. Saint Nikodemos suggests this must be Justinian I, who is also celebrated the 15th of November with his wife Theodora.

Modern English translations and some Greek Synaxarions now list either Justinian I on August 2 or make no reference to either Justinian I or II. However, there are some Greek Synaxarions that list Justinian II.

==Family==
With his first wife Eudokia, Justinian II had at least one daughter, Anastasia, who was betrothed to the Bulgarian ruler Tervel. With his second wife, Theodora of Khazaria, Justinian II had a son, Tiberius, co-emperor from 706 to 711.

==Fictional account==
&quot;Justinian&quot;, a 1998 novel by Byzantine scholar Harry Turtledove, writing under the name H. N. Turteltaub, gives a fictionalized version of Justinian&#x27;s life as retold by a fictionalized lifelong companion, the soldier Myakes. In the novel, Turtledove speculates that while in exile Justinian had reconstructive surgery done by an itinerant Indian plastic surgeon to repair his damaged nose.

<text>The Godfather Part II is a 1974 American epic crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, loosely based on the 1969 novel &quot;The Godfather&quot; by Mario Puzo, who co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, as well as a rare example of a sequel that rivals its predecessor. It is both a sequel and a prequel to the 1972 film &quot;The Godfather&quot;, presenting parallel dramas: one picks up the 1958 story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), the new Don of the Corleone family, protecting the family business in the aftermath of an attempt on his life; the other covers the journey of his father, Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), from his Sicilian childhood to the founding of his family enterprise in New York City. The ensemble cast also features Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Morgana King, John Cazale, Marianna Hill and Lee Strasberg.

Following the first film&#x27;s success, Paramount Pictures began developing a follow-up, with many of the cast and crew returning. Coppola, who was given more creative control, had wanted to make both a sequel and a prequel to &quot;The Godfather&quot; that would tell the story of Vito&#x27;s rise and Michael&#x27;s fall. Principal photography began in October 1973 and wrapped up in June 1974. &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; premiered in New York City on December 12, 1974, and was released in the United States on December 20, 1974. It grossed $48 million in the United States and Canada and up to $93 million worldwide on a $13 million budget. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, and became the first sequel to win Best Picture. Its six Oscar wins also included Best Director for Coppola, Best Supporting Actor for De Niro and Best Adapted Screenplay for Coppola and Puzo. Pacino won Best Actor at the BAFTAs and was nominated at the Oscars.

Like its predecessor, &quot;Part II&quot; remains a highly influential film, especially in the gangster genre. In 1997, the American Film Institute ranked it as the 32nd-greatest film in American film history and it retained this position 10 years later. It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1993, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. 
Pauline Kael wrote: &quot;&quot;The Godfather&quot; was the greatest gangster picture ever made, and had metaphorical overtones that took it far beyond the gangster genre. In Part II, the wider themes are no longer merely implied. The second film shows the consequences of the actions in the first; it’s all one movie, in two great big pieces, and it comes together in your head while you watch.&quot;

&quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;, the final installment in the trilogy, was released 16 years later in 1990. 
== Plot ==

The film interweaves events some time after &quot;The Godfather&quot; and the early life of Vito Corleone.

=== Vito ===
In 1901, nine-year-old Vito Andolini escapes from Corleone, Sicily in the Kingdom of Italy to New York City after mafia chieftain Don Ciccio kills the rest of his family. An immigration officer registers him as Vito Corleone. By 1917 Vito is married in Little Italy and has an infant son, Sonny. Black Hand extortionist Don Fanucci preys on the neighborhood, costing Vito his grocery store job. He begins stealing for a living with his neighbor Peter Clemenza and has two more children: Fredo and Michael.

Vito, Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio sell stolen dresses door-to-door. Fanucci demands payoffs of $200 from Vito and his partners. Vito doubts Fanucci&#x27;s muscle and decides to offer less. He meets Fanucci and offers $100, which Fanucci grudgingly accepts. Emboldened, Vito tracks Fanucci back to his apartment and kills him. Vito&#x27;s reputation spreads, and neighbors ask him to defend them from other predatory figures.

In 1922, Vito and his family travel to Sicily to start an olive oil importing business. He and business partner Don Tommasino visit an elderly Don Ciccio. He obtains Ciccio&#x27;s blessing for their business, then reveals his identity and slices Ciccio&#x27;s stomach, avenging the Andolini family.

=== Michael ===
In 1958, Don Michael Corleone has several meetings at his Lake Tahoe compound during the First Communion of his son Anthony. Johnny Ola, representing Jewish Mob boss Hyman Roth, promises support in taking over a Las Vegas casino. Corleone &quot;capo&quot; Frank Pentangeli asks for help defending Bronx territory from Roth affiliates, the Rosato brothers. Michael refuses, frustrating Pentangeli. Senator Pat Geary demands a bribe to secure the casino license and insults Michael&#x27;s Italian heritage. That night, Michael narrowly escapes an assassination attempt. Suspecting a traitor in the family, he leaves &quot;consigliere&quot; Tom Hagen in charge and leaves the compound.

Michael separately tells Pentangeli and Roth that he suspects the other of planning the hit, and arranges a peace meeting between Pentangeli and the Rosatos. At the meeting the brothers attempt to strangle Pentangeli. A police officer drops in, forcing the brothers to flee. Hagen blackmails Geary into cooperating with the Corleones by having him framed for the death of a prostitute.

Roth invites Michael to Havana to invest in his activities under the Batista government. Michael expresses reservations, given the growing Cuban Revolution. Later Roth becomes angry when Michael asks who ordered the Rosatos to kill Pentangeli. Michael and Ola attend a New Year&#x27;s Eve party where Fredo pretends not to know Ola but later slips. Michael realizes that Fredo is a traitor and orders both Roth and Ola killed. Batista resigns and flees amid rebel advances, and Michael, Fredo and Roth separately escape Cuba. Ola is murdered by hitman Bussetta. Back home, Hagen tells Michael that his wife Kay miscarried.

A Senate committee on organized crime investigates the Corleone family. Pentangeli agrees to testify against Michael and is placed under witness protection. On returning to Nevada, Fredo tells Michael that he did not realize that Roth was planning an assassination. Michael disowns Fredo but orders that he should not be harmed while their mother Carmela is alive. Michael attends the committee hearing with Hagen and Pentangeli&#x27;s brother Vincenzo. Pentangeli, upon seeing Vincenzo, retracts his statement implicating Michael in organized crime, and the hearing dissolves in an uproar. Kay tells Michael that she had an abortion and intends to leave him and take their children. Michael strikes her in rage and banishes her alone.

At Carmela&#x27;s funeral, Fredo hugs a reluctant Michael and befriends Anthony over fishing. Roth returns to the United States after being refused entry to Israel. Corleone &quot;capo&quot; Rocco Lampone assassinates him at the airport and is shot dead trying to escape. Hagen visits Pentangeli at the army barracks where he is held and they discuss how failed conspirators against a Roman emperor could commit suicide to save their families. Pentangeli is later found dead in his bathtub, having slit his wrists. Enforcer Al Neri takes Fredo fishing and shoots him as Michael watches from the compound.

Michael recalls Vito&#x27;s 50th birthday party on December 7, 1941. While the family waits for Vito, Michael announces that he has dropped out of college and joined the Marines, angering Sonny and surprising Hagen. Only Fredo supports his decision. When Vito is heard arriving, Michael sits alone at the table while the others welcome him in surprise. After Fredo&#x27;s death, Michael sits pensively, alone, by the lake.

== Cast ==

== Production ==
=== Development ===

Mario Puzo started writing a script for a sequel in December 1971, before &quot;The Godfather&quot; was even released; its initial title was &quot;The Death of Michael Corleone&quot;. Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s idea for the sequel would be to &quot;juxtapose the ascension of the family under Vito Corleone with the decline of the family under his son Michael... I had always wanted to write a screenplay that told the story of a father and a son at the same age. They were both in their thirties and I would integrate the two stories... In order not to merely make &quot;Godfather I&quot; over again, I gave &quot;Godfather II&quot; this double structure by extending the story in both the past and in the present&quot;. Coppola met with Martin Scorsese about directing the film, but Paramount refused. Coppola also, in his director&#x27;s commentary on &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, mentioned that the scenes depicting the Senate committee interrogation of Michael Corleone and Frank Pentangeli are based on the Joseph Valachi federal hearings and that Pentangeli is a Valachi-like figure.

Production, however, nearly ended before it began when Pacino&#x27;s lawyers told Coppola that he had grave misgivings with the script and was not coming. Coppola spent an entire night rewriting it before giving it to Pacino for his review. Pacino approved it and the production went forward.
The film&#x27;s original budget was $6 million but costs increased to over $11 million, with &quot;Variety&quot;″s review claiming it was over $15 million.

=== Casting ===

Several actors from the first film did not return for the sequel. Marlon Brando initially agreed to return for the birthday flashback sequence, but the actor, feeling mistreated by the board at Paramount, failed to show up for the single day&#x27;s shooting. Coppola then rewrote the scene that same day. Richard S. Castellano, who portrayed Peter Clemenza in the first film, also declined to return, as he and the producers could not reach an agreement on his demands that he be allowed to write the character&#x27;s dialogue in the film, though this claim was disputed by Castellano″s widow in a 1991 letter to &quot;People&quot; magazine. The part in the plot originally intended for the latter-day Clemenza was then filled by the character of Frank Pentangeli, played by Michael V. Gazzo.

Coppola offered James Cagney a part in the film, but he refused. James Caan agreed to reprise the role of Sonny in the birthday flashback sequence, demanding he be paid the same amount he received for the entire previous film for the single scene in &quot;Part II&quot;, which he received. Among the actors depicting Senators in the hearing committee are film producer/director Roger Corman, writer/producer William Bowers, producer Phil Feldman, and actor Peter Donat.

=== Filming ===
&quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; was shot between October 1, 1973, and June 19, 1974. The scenes that took place in Cuba were shot in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Charles Bluhdorn, whose Gulf+Western conglomerate owned Paramount, felt strongly about developing the Dominican Republic as a movie-making site. Forza d&#x27;Agrò was the Sicilian town featured in the film.

Unlike with the first film, Coppola was given near-complete control over production. In his commentary, he said this resulted in a shoot that ran very smoothly despite multiple locations and two narratives running parallel within one film. Coppola discusses his decision to make this the first major U.S. motion picture to use &quot;Part II&quot; in its title in the director&#x27;s commentary on the DVD edition of the film released in 2002. Paramount was initially opposed because they believed the audience would not be interested in an addition to a story they had already seen. But the director prevailed, and the film&#x27;s success began the common practice of numbered sequels.

Only three weeks prior to the release, film critics and journalists pronounced &quot;Part II&quot; a disaster. The cross-cutting between Vito and Michael&#x27;s parallel stories were judged too frequent, not allowing enough time to leave a lasting impression on the audience. Coppola and the editors returned to the cutting room to change the film&#x27;s narrative structure, but could not complete the work in time, leaving the final scenes poorly timed at the opening.

It was the last major American motion picture to have release prints made with Technicolor&#x27;s dye imbibition process until the late 1990s.

=== Music ===

The score is by Nino Rota with additions by Carmine Coppola. It won the 1974 Academy Award for Best Original Score.

== Release ==
=== Theatrical ===
&quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; premiered in New York City on December 12, 1974, and was released in the United States on December 20, 1974.

=== Home media ===

Coppola created &quot;The Godfather Saga&quot; expressly for American television in a 1975 release that combined &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; with unused footage from those two films in a chronological telling that toned down the violent, sexual, and profane material for its NBC debut on November 18, 1977. In 1981, Paramount released the &quot;Godfather Epic&quot; VHS box set, which also told the story of the first two films in chronological order, again with additional scenes, but not redacted for broadcast sensibilities. Coppola returned to the film again in 1992 when he updated that release with footage from &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; and more unreleased material. This home viewing release, under the title &quot;The Godfather Trilogy 1901–1980&quot;, had a total run time of 583 minutes (9 hours, 43 minutes), not including the set&#x27;s bonus documentary by Jeff Werner on the making of the films, &quot;The Godfather Family: A Look Inside&quot;.

&quot;The Godfather DVD Collection&quot; was released on October 9, 2001, in a package that contained all three films—each with a commentary track by Coppola—and a bonus disc that featured a 73-minute documentary from 1991 entitled &quot;The Godfather Family: A Look Inside&quot; and other miscellany about the film: the additional scenes originally contained in &quot;The Godfather Saga&quot;; &quot;Francis Coppola&#x27;s Notebook&quot; (a look inside a notebook the director kept with him at all times during the production of the film); rehearsal footage; a promotional featurette from 1971; and video segments on Gordon Willis&#x27;s cinematography, Nino Rota&#x27;s and Carmine Coppola&#x27;s music, the director, the locations and Mario Puzo&#x27;s screenplays. The DVD also held a Corleone family tree, a &quot;Godfather&quot; timeline, and footage of the Academy Award acceptance speeches.

The restoration was confirmed by Francis Ford Coppola during a question-and-answer session for &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;, when he said that he had just seen the new transfer and it was &quot;terrific&quot;.

==== Restoration ====
After a careful restoration by Robert A. Harris of Film Preserve, the first two &quot;Godfather&quot; films were released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 23, 2008, under the title &quot;The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration&quot;. The Blu-ray Disc box set (four discs) includes high-definition extra features on the restoration and film. They are included on Disc 5 of the DVD box set (five discs).

Other extras are ported over from Paramount&#x27;s 2001 DVD release. There are slight differences between the repurposed extras on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets, with the HD box having more content.

Paramount Pictures restored and remastered &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, and &quot;The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone&quot; (a re-edited cut of the third film) for a limited theatrical run and home media release on Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the premiere of &quot;The Godfather&quot;. The disc editions were released on March 22, 2022.

==== Video game ====

A video game based on the film was released for Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in April 2009 by Electronic Arts. It received mixed or average reviews and sold poorly, leading Electronic Arts to cancel plans for a game based on &quot;The Godfather Part III.&quot;

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
Although &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; did not surpass the original film commercially, it grossed $47.5 million in the United States and Canada. and was Paramount Pictures&#x27; highest-grossing film of 1974, and the seventh-highest-grossing picture in the United States. According to its international distributor, the film had grossed $45.3 million internationally by 1994, for a worldwide total of $93 million.

=== Critical response ===
Pauline Kael in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was an early champion of the film, writing that it was visually &quot;far more complexly beautiful than the first, just as it&#x27;s thematically richer, more shadowed, more full.&quot; She writes: &quot;Twice I almost cried out at the acts of violence that De Niro&#x27;s Vito committed. I didn&#x27;t look away from the images, as I sometimes do in routine action pictures. I wanted to see the worst; there is a powerful need to see it. You need these moments as you need the terrible climaxes in a Tolstoy novel. A great novelist does not spare our feelings (as the historical romancer does); he intensifies them, and so does Coppola.&quot; However, while the film&#x27;s cinematography and acting were immediately acclaimed, many criticized it as overly slow-paced and convoluted. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; viewed the film unfavorably, describing it as &quot;stitched together from leftover parts. It talks. It moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own... The plot defies any rational synopsis.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; noted that Canby had been downbeat on the original too and claimed that he was in a minority of one and reported that the film had drawn mostly strongly admiring reviews. In A.D. Murphy&#x27;s review in &quot;Variety&quot; he described it as a &quot;masterful sequel&quot; and &quot;outstanding in all respects&quot;.

William Pechter of &quot;Commentary&quot;, while admiring the movie, regretted what he saw as its archness and self-importance, calling it an &quot;overly deliberate and self-conscious attempt to make a film that&#x27;s unmistakably a serious work of art,&quot; and professing to &quot;know of no one except movie critics who likes &quot;Part II&quot; as much as part one.&quot; Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; cited what he called &quot;gaps and distentions&quot; in the story. 

Roger Ebert awarded three out of four and wrote that the flashbacks &quot;give Coppola the greatest difficulty in maintaining his pace and narrative force. The story of Michael, told chronologically and without the other material, would have had really substantial impact, but Coppola prevents our complete involvement by breaking the tension.&quot; Though praising Pacino&#x27;s performance and lauding Coppola as &quot;a master of mood, atmosphere, and period&quot;, Ebert considered the chronological shifts of its narrative &quot;a structural weakness from which the film never recovers&quot;. Gene Siskel gave the film three-and-a-half out of four, writing that it was at times &quot;as beautiful, as harrowing, and as exciting as the original. In fact, &quot;The Godfather, Part II&quot; may be the &quot;second&quot; best gangster movie ever made. But it&#x27;s not the same. Sequels can never be the same. It&#x27;s like being forced to go to a funeral the second time—the tears just don&#x27;t flow as easily.&quot;

=== Critical re-assessment ===
The film quickly became the subject of a critical re-evaluation. Whether considered separately or with its predecessor as one work, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; is now widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema. Many critics compare it favorably with the originalalthough it is rarely ranked higher on lists of &quot;greatest&quot; films. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 96% approval rating based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 9.7/10. The consensus reads, &quot;Drawing on strong performances by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s continuation of Mario Puzo&#x27;s Mafia saga set new standards for sequels that have yet to be matched or broken.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Michael Sragow&#x27;s conclusion in his 2002 essay, selected for the National Film Registry website, is that &quot;[a]lthough &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; depict an American family&#x27;s moral defeat, as a mammoth, pioneering work of art it remains a national creative triumph.&quot; In his 2014 review of the film, Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote &quot;Francis Coppola&#x27;s breathtakingly ambitious prequel-sequel to his first &quot;Godfather&quot; movie is as gripping as ever. It is even better than the first film, and has the greatest single final scene in Hollywood history, a real coup de cinéma.&quot;

&quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; was featured on &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;″s Director&#x27;s list of the ten greatest films of all time in 1992 (ranked at No. 9) and 2002 (where it was ranked at No. 2. The critics ranked it at No. 4) On the 2012 list by the same magazine the film was ranked at No. 31 by critics and at No. 30 by directors. In 2006, Writers Guild of America ranked the film&#x27;s screenplay (Written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola) the 10th greatest ever. It ranked No. 7 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;, and #1 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 1999 list of the &quot;50 Greatest Movies of All Time on TV and Video&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; at No. 31 in its Top 250 &quot;Best Films of the Century&quot; list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. In January 2002, the film (along with &quot;The Godfather&quot;) made the list of the &quot;Top 100 Essential Films of All Time&quot; by the National Society of Film Critics. In 2017, it ranked No. 12 on Empire magazine&#x27;s reader&#x27;s poll of &quot;The 100 Greatest Movies&quot;. In an earlier poll held by the same magazine in 2008, it was voted 19th on the list of &#x27;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&#x27;. In 2015, it was tenth in the BBC&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest American films.

Many believe Pacino&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; is his finest acting work. It is now regarded as one of the greatest performances in film history. In 2006, &quot;Premiere&quot; issued its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Performances of all Time&quot;, putting Pacino&#x27;s performance at #20. Later in 2009, &quot;Total Film&quot; issued &quot;The 150 Greatest Performances of All Time&quot;, ranking Pacino&#x27;s performance fourth place.

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited it as one of his 100 favorite films.

Ebert added the film to his Great Movies canon, noting he &quot;would not change a word&quot; of his original review but praising the work as &quot;grippingly written, directed with confidence and artistry, photographed by Gordon Willis... in rich, warm tones.&quot; He praises the score: &quot;More than ever, I am convinced it is instrumental to the power and emotional effect of the films. I cannot imagine them without their Nino Rota scores. Against all our objective reason, they instruct us how to feel about the films. Now listen very carefully to the first notes as the big car drives into Miami. You will hear an evocative echo of Bernard Hermann’s score for &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, another film about a man who got everything he wanted and then lost it.&quot;
==Accolades==

This film is the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; remain the only original/sequel combination both to win Best Picture. Along with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Godfather Trilogy&quot; shares the distinction that all of its installments were nominated for Best Picture; additionally, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; are so far the only sequels to win Best Picture. Al Pacino became the third actor to be Oscar-nominated twice for playing the same character.

<doc id="73882" wikidata="Q214723" url="?curid=73882" title="The Gold Rush">
<text>The Gold Rush is a 1925 American silent comedy film written, produced, and directed by Charlie Chaplin. The film also stars Chaplin in his Little Tramp persona, Georgia Hale, Mack Swain, Tom Murray, Henry Bergman and Malcolm Waite.

Chaplin drew inspiration from photographs of the Klondike Gold Rush as well as from the story of the Donner Party who, when snowbound in the Sierra Nevada, were driven to cannibalism or eating leather from their shoes. Chaplin, who believed tragedies and comedies were not far from each other, decided to combine these stories of deprivation and horror in comedy. He decided that his famous rogue figure should become a gold-digger who joins a brave optimist determined to face all the pitfalls associated with the search for gold, such as sickness, hunger, cold, loneliness or the possibility that he may at any time be attacked by a grizzly. In the film, scenes like Chaplin cooking and dreaming of his shoe, or how his starving friend Big Jim sees him as a chicken could be seen.

&quot;The Gold Rush&quot; was critically acclaimed upon its release, and continues to be one of Chaplin&#x27;s most celebrated works; Chaplin himself cited it several times as the film for which he most wanted to be remembered. In 1942, Chaplin re-released a version with sound effects, music, and narration, which received Academy Award nominations for Best Music Score and Best Sound Recording. In 1958, the film was voted number 2 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo, by a margin of only five votes behind &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;. In 1992, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In 1953, the original 1925 version of the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.

==Plot==
&quot;The following is the plot of the 1942 re-release:&quot;

During the Klondike Gold Rush, in Alaska, gold prospector Big Jim finds an enormous gold deposit on his parcel of land when a blizzard strikes. The Lone Prospector gets lost in the same blizzard while also prospecting for gold. He stumbles into the cabin of Black Larsen, a wanted criminal. Larsen tries to throw the Prospector out when Jim also stumbles inside. Larsen tries to scare both out using his shotgun but is overpowered by Jim, and the three agree to a truce allowing them all to stay in the cabin.

When the storm is taking so long that food is running out, the three draw lots for who will have to go out into the blizzard to obtain food. Larsen loses and leaves the cabin. While outside looking for food, he encounters Jim&#x27;s gold deposit and decides to ambush him there when Jim returns.

Meanwhile, the two remaining in the cabin get so desperate that they cook and eat one of the Prospector&#x27;s shoes. Later, Jim gets delirious, imagines the Prospector as a giant chicken and attacks him. A bear then enters the cabin and is killed, supplying them with food.
After the storm subsides, both leave the cabin, the Prospector continuing on to the next gold boom town while Jim returns to his gold deposit. There, he is knocked out by Larsen with a shovel. While fleeing with some of the mined gold, Larsen dies in an avalanche. Jim recovers consciousness and wanders into the snow, having lost his memory from the blow. When he returns to the town, his memory has been partly restored and he remembers that he found a large gold deposit, that it was close to a cabin, and that he stayed there with the Prospector. But he knows neither the location of the deposit nor of the cabin, and so looks for the Prospector, hoping that he can lead him to the cabin.

The Prospector arrives at the town and encounters Georgia, a dance hall girl, and falls in love with her. To irritate Jack, a man who is making aggressive advances toward Georgia and is pestering her for a dance, she instead decides to dance with &quot;the most deplorable looking tramp in the dance hall&quot;, the Prospector. After encountering each other again, she accepts his invitation for a New Year&#x27;s Eve dinner, but does not take it seriously and forgets about it. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, while waiting for her to arrive to the dinner, the Prospector imagines entertaining her with a dance of bread rolls on forks. When she does not arrive until midnight, he walks alone through the streets, desperate. Meanwhile, Georgia remembers his invitation and decides to visit him. Finding his home empty but seeing the meticulously prepared dinner and a present for her, she has a change of heart and prepares a note asking to talk to him.
When the Prospector is handed the note, he goes searching for Georgia. Jim finds him and drags him away to go search for the cabin, giving the Prospector only enough time to tell Georgia that he will return to her as a millionaire. Jim and the Prospector find the cabin and stay for the night. Overnight, another blizzard blows the cabin half over a cliff right next to Jim&#x27;s gold deposit. The next morning the cabin is rocking dangerously over the cliff edge while the two try to escape. Jim eventually gets out and pulls the Prospector to safety right when the cabin falls off the cliff.

One year later, both have become wealthy, but the Prospector never could find Georgia. They return to the contiguous United States on a ship on which, unknown to them, Georgia is also traveling. When the Prospector agrees to don his old clothes for a photograph, he falls down the stairs, encountering Georgia once more. After she mistakenly thinks he is a stowaway and tries to save him from the ship&#x27;s crew, the misunderstanding is cleared up and both are happily reunited.

==Cast==
* Charlie Chaplin (as The Tramp) as The Lone Prospector
* Mack Swain as Big Jim McKay
* Tom Murray as Black Larsen
* Malcolm Waite as Jack Cameron
* Georgia Hale as The Girl, Georgia
* Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis
* Tiny Sandford as a Barman (uncredited)

==Production==
Chaplin attempted to film many of the scenes on location near Truckee, California in early 1924. He retained only the film&#x27;s opening scene. For two weeks the unit shot on location at Truckee in the snow country of the Sierra Nevada. Here Chaplin faithfully recreated the historic image of the prospectors struggling up the Chilkoot Pass. Six hundred extras clambered up the 2300-feet pass dug through the mountain snow.

The rest of the film was shot on the back lot and stages at Chaplin&#x27;s Hollywood studio, where elaborate Klondike sets were constructed.

Lita Grey, whom Chaplin married in November 1924, was originally cast as the leading lady but due to her pregnancy was replaced by Georgia Hale. Grey appeared in the film as an extra.

Discussing the making of the film in the documentary series &quot;Unknown Chaplin&quot;, Hale revealed that the marriage had collapsed during production of the film; the final scene of the original version, in which the two kiss, reflected the state of his relationship with Hale by that time.

==Box office==
&quot;The Gold Rush&quot; was a huge success in the US and worldwide. It is the fifth-highest-grossing silent film in cinema history, earning more than $4,250,000 at the box office in 1926 (~$ in ). Chaplin proclaimed at the time of its release that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered.

It earned United Artists $1 million and Chaplin himself a profit of $2 million.

==Critical reception==

Critics generally praised the original 1925 release of &quot;The Gold Rush&quot;. Mordaunt Hall wrote in &quot;The New York Times:&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; also published a rave review, saying that it was &quot;the greatest and most elaborate comedy ever filmed, and will stand for years as the biggest hit in its field, just as &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; still withstands the many competitors in the dramatic class.&quot;

&quot;The New Yorker&quot; published a mixed review, believing that the dramatic elements of the film did not work well alongside Chaplin&#x27;s familiar slapstick:

Nevertheless, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; included &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; in its year-end list of the ten best films of 1925.

At the 1958 Brussels World Fair, critics rated it the second greatest film in history, behind only Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;. In 1992, &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance considers &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; to be Chaplin&#x27;s greatest work of the silent-film era. He writes: &quot;&quot;The Gold Rush&quot; is arguably his greatest and most ambitious silent film; it was the longest and most expensive comedy produced up to that time. The film contains many of Chaplin&#x27;s most celebrated comedy sequences, including the boiling and eating of his shoe, the dance of the rolls, and the teetering cabin. However, the greatness of &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; does not rest solely on its comedy sequences but on the fact that they are integrated so fully into a character-driven narrative. Chaplin had no reservations about the finished product. Indeed, in the contemporary publicity for the film, he is quoted, &#x27;This is the picture that I want to be remembered by.&#x27;&quot;

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; as one of his favorite films.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 1998: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movies – #74
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Laughs – #25
* 2007: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – #58

&quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; at No. 49 in its Top 250 &quot;Best Films of the Century&quot; list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted it at No.15 on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. The film was voted at No. 97 on the list of &quot;100 Greatest Films&quot; by the prominent French magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; in 2008. In the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll, it was ranked the 91st-greatest film ever made in the directors&#x27; poll. In 2015, &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; ranked 17th on BBC&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest American Films&quot; list, voted on by film critics from around the world. The film was voted at No. 25 on the list of &quot;The 100 greatest comedies of all time&quot; by a poll of 253 film critics from 52 countries conducted by the BBC in 2017.

==1942 re-release==
In 1942, Chaplin released a new version of &quot;The Gold Rush&quot;, modifying the original silent 1925 film by adding a recorded musical score, adding a narration which he recorded himself and tightening the editing, which reduced the film&#x27;s running time by several minutes. The film was further shortened by being run at the 24 frames per second rate of sound films. Like most silent movies it was originally shot and exhibited at a slower speed. Chaplin also changed some plot points. Besides removing the ending kiss, another edit eliminated a subplot in which the Lone Prospector is tricked into believing Georgia is in love with him by Georgia&#x27;s paramour, Jack.

Literary critic Manny Farber, writing in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, on the 1942 re-release of &quot;The Gold Rush&quot;:
The new music score by Max Terr and the sound recording by James L. Fields were nominated for Academy Awards in 1943.

&quot;The Gold Rush&quot; was the first of Chaplin&#x27;s classic silent films that he converted to sound. The 2012 Blu-ray release revealed that the reissue of &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; preserved most of the footage from the original film. Even the restored print of the 1925 original shows noticeable degradation of image and missing frames, artifacts not seen in the 1942 version.

==Copyright and home media==
In 1953, the original 1925 film may have entered the public domain in the US, as Chaplin did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication in accordance with American law at the time. As such, the film was once widely available on home video in the US. After 1995, Chaplin&#x27;s estate blocked unauthorized releases of &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; in the United States by arguing that the film&#x27;s U.S. copyright had been restored by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. Regardless, in 2021, the original film definitively entered the public domain in the United States as 95 years had passed since its release.

In 2012, both the reconstruction of the 1925 silent version and the 1942 narrated reissue version were released on Blu-ray by the Criterion Collection. This set included a new audio commentary track by Chaplin biographer and scholar Jeffrey Vance.

==In popular culture==
The &quot;roll dance&quot; that the Little Tramp character performs in the film is considered one of the more memorable scenes in film history; however, Roscoe Arbuckle did something similar in the 1917 movie &quot;The Rough House&quot; which co-starred Buster Keaton. Curly Howard made a brief homage to the bit in the 1935 Three Stooges film &quot;Pardon My Scotch&quot;. Anna Karina&#x27;s character in &quot;Bande à part&quot; makes references to it before the famous dance scene. In more recent times, it was replicated by Robert Downey Jr. in his lead role as Charles Chaplin in the 1992 &quot;Chaplin&quot;, which briefly depicts the production of the film; Johnny Depp&#x27;s character in the 1993 film &quot;Benny and Joon&quot;; Grampa Simpson in the 1994 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Lady Bouvier&#x27;s Lover&quot;; and Amy Adams&#x27;s character in &quot;The Muppets&quot;. The &quot;hanging cabin on the edge of the cliff&quot; sequence (starting at 1:19 in video inserted above) has been used in two Indian movies: &quot;Michael Madana Kama Rajan&quot; and &quot;Welcome&quot;.

<doc id="73886" wikidata="Q31513" url="?curid=73886" title="Heraclonas">
<text>Heraclius (; 626 – 642), known by the diminutive Heraclonas or Heracleonas (), and sometimes called Heraclius II, was briefly Byzantine emperor in 641.

Heraclonas was the son of Heraclius and his niece Martina. His father had stipulated in his will that both of his sons, Heraclonas and Constantine III, should rule jointly upon his death. Heraclius also specified that his wife, Martina, was to be called &quot;Mother and Empress&quot; insofar as she might have influence at court as well. The emperor Heraclius died in February 641 from edema. When Martina made the late Emperor&#x27;s will public she faced staunch resistance to her playing any active role in government, but both Heraclonas and Constantine were proclaimed joint-emperors in February 641 without incident. After Constantine died of tuberculosis in May 641, Heraclonas became sole emperor, under the regency of his mother due to his young age. He reigned until October or November 641, when he was overthrown by Valentinus, a general and usurper of Armenian extract, who installed Constans II, the son of Constantine III. Valentinus had Heraclonas&#x27; nose cut off, then exiled him to Rhodes, where he is believed to have died in the following year.

==Early life and family==
Heraclonas was born in 626, in the suburban Palace of Sophianae. He was the son of Emperor Heraclius, and his niece-wife Martina, and was born while Heraclius campaigned in the east against the Persians.

Under Heraclius, the Byzantine Empire was invaded in 639 by the Arabs, due to the failure of the Theme of Mesopotamia to pay tribute. The cities of Edessa and Dara were quickly captured. In the same year, another group of Arabs, led by &#x27;Amr ibn al-&#x27;As, invaded Byzantine Egypt. He quickly occupied the coastal towns of Egypt, but was unable to cross the Nile, due to stiff resistance by Byzantine forces led by John (Prefect of Egypt). After a bloody battle between John and &#x27;Amr, in which John perished, &#x27;Amr was forced to appeal to the Rashidun Caliph Umar for more troops. John was replaced by another general, Theodore, who gathered his forces around Babylon Fortress, a major fortress in Egypt. By summer 640, &#x27;Amr&#x27;s forces had swelled to around 15,000 men. With these men, &#x27;Amr decisively defeated Theodore north of Babylon, before laying siege to the fortress itself.

==Life==
Heraclonas was made by Heraclius on 1 January 632, and further elevated to (co-emperor) on 4 July 638, at a ceremony in the chapel of Saint Stephen at the Palace of Daphne, alongside his younger brother David, who was made . A description of the ceremony is preserved in &quot;De Ceremoniis&quot; which says that the &quot;kamelaukion&quot; (caesar cap) of Heraclonas was removed from his head and replaced with the imperial crown. The same &quot;kamelaukion&quot; was then placed on David&#x27;s head.

Heraclius died of edema on 11 February 641, leaving the Empire jointly to his eldest son, Constantine III, and Heraclonas, who were both proclaimed emperor in late May 641. At the time of his elevation to co-emperor, Heraclonas was only 15 years old, whereas Constantine was 28, which effectively gave the real power to Constantine. Much of the Byzantine public objected to Heraclius″ will, as Heraclonas was the result of an avunculate marriage—a marriage between an uncle and niece—which many felt was illegal, thereby making Heraclonas a bastard. Also considered objectionable was the fact that Constantine&#x27;s ten-year-old son, Constans II, was not elevated alongside Constantine and Heraclonas, breaking the tradition of the succession of senior emperorship from father to eldest son, when possible. It was also thought that the lack of elevation could have precluded him from the succession entirely.

Shortly after Constantine took the throne, he was informed by his finance minister, Philagrius, that Heraclius had created a secret fund for Martina, administered by Patriarch Pyrrhus. Constantine confiscated this account, using it to help meet the budget for the spring military payroll, which, along with the traditional accessional donatives that comprised half of the payroll, totaled 2,016,000 nomisma. Constantine appointed Valentinus as the commander of the main eastern army, in the hopes of retaining at least the Egyptian coastline. However the Byzantine general Theodore was still unable to repel the Arab attacks. Constantine summoned Cyrus of Alexandria, made him Prefect of Egypt, and instructed him to prepare to reinforce Alexandria. Before this invasion could take place, Babylon surrendered to the Arabs, allowing them to besiege Alexandria.

Heraclius″ will also stated that Martina should serve as mother and empress-regent (sharing significant power), but this part was rejected by the Senate. Because of Heraclonas″ young age, Martina ruled through him, consistently opposing the policies of Constantine, leading to the creation of two different political factions. Constantine&#x27;s faction was initially the more powerful of the two, but this control was weakened by a flagging economy and the loss of Egypt to the Arabs. Shortly after, on 25 May 641, Constantine died of an advanced case of tuberculosis, although some supporters of Constantine alleged Martina had him poisoned, leaving Heraclonas as the sole ruler, under the regency of Martina.

===Sole rule and fall===

Martina maintained the plans of Constantine, and sent Cyrus to Alexandria, with much of the praesental army. She then summoned the Thracian army to Constantinople, to replace them. Around this time, the Patriarch Pyrrhus, an influential advisor of Martina, succeeded in reviving the policy of Monothelitism. As a result of this policy, Kyros, a monothelete, regained control of the see of Alexandria, giving him both religious and secular control. Martina instructed Kyros to attempt to negotiate with the Arabs, as they believed that they were unable to defeat them militarily. Kyros met with &#x27;Amr at the Babylon Fortress and there agreed upon the surrender of Egypt.

Martina was opposed by Valentinus, who was beyond her reach in Anatolia, although she exiled his patron, Philagrius, to Africa. Heraclonas and Martina lost the support of the Byzantine Senate and people due to the rumors that Martina had poisoned Constantine and their support for Monothelitism. Also at this time, both Heraclonas and Martina&#x27;s relations with the army suffered as a result of Martina&#x27;s inability to raise enough funds to match the donative given by Constantine.

In August 641, Valentinus marched his troops to Chalcedon, to force Martina to elevate Constans II to co-emperor. While Valentinus was encamped across the Bosphorus from Constantinople, a mob rose up in the city, demanding that Pyrrhus crown Constans II as emperor, and then abdicate, to be replaced by his steward Paul II. Martina, now in a truly desperate situation, offered the military further donatives, recalled Philagrius from Africa, and offered Valentinus the title of Count of the Excubitors. In late September/October, Martina elevated Constans to co-emperor, but also crowned Heraclonas″ brother David. Despite these offers, Valentinus entered the city in October/November, deposed Heraclonas and Martina, and then elevated Constans to emperor. Valentinus was unwilling to kill a woman and child, but had Martina&#x27;s tongue slit and Heraclonas&#x27; nose cut off in January 642, then exiled them to Rhodes; this is believed to be the first time that the political mutilation of Byzantine prisoners was utilized to signify that the person could no longer hold political power. After this, nothing is known of them, although it is believed that Heraclonas died in 642, likely in Rhodes.

<doc id="73887" wikidata="Q175113" url="?curid=73887" title="Bloody Sunday (1939)">
<text>Bloody Sunday (; ) was a sequence of violent events that took place in Bydgoszcz (), a Polish city with a sizable German minority, between 3 and 4 September 1939, during the German invasion of Poland.

Standing in the path of the German army&#x27;s advance during the early days of the invasion, tensions quickly escalated in Bydgoszcz between the city&#x27;s sizable German-speaking minority and its Polish majority. On 3 September, as the Wehrmacht was preparing to assault the city, members of the German minority working in conjunction with the German intelligence agency (Abwehr) attacked the Polish garrison. Polish soldiers and civilians reacted with violent reprisals against ethnic Germans, who in turn reacted with more violence. A Polish investigation concluded in 2004 that approximately 40–50 Poles and between 100 and 300 Germans were killed. 

The term &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; was applied to the events by Nazi propaganda officials, who highlighted and exaggerated German casualties. An instruction issued to the press said, &quot;... must show news on the barbarism of Poles against Germans in Bromberg. The expression &#x27;Bloody Sunday&#x27; must enter as a permanent term in the dictionary and circumnavigate the globe. For that reason, this term must be continuously underlined.&quot;

Approximately 200–400 Polish hostages were shot in a mass execution in the aftermath of the fall of the city on 5 September. Additionally, fifty Polish prisoners of war from Bydgoszcz were accused by Nazi summary courts of taking part in &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; and shot. The reprisals compounded violence stemming from the German attempts to pacify the city, and the premeditated murder of notable Poles as part of Operation Tannenberg. As part of the latter, the Germans murdered 1,200–3,000 Polish civilians in Bydgoszcz, in a part of the city that became known as the Valley of Death.

==Background==
Bydgoszcz (Bromberg) was part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1772, when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia during the First Partition of Poland. As a part of Prussia, the city was affected by the unification of Germany in 1871 and became part of the German Empire. It would remain a part of the German Empire until the end of World War I. In February 1920, the Treaty of Versailles awarded the city and the surrounding region to the Second Polish Republic (the administrative region of Pomeranian Voivodeship). This resulted in a number of ethnic Germans leaving the region for Germany. Over the interwar period, the German population decreased even further.

The emergence of the Nazi Party in Germany had an important impact on the city. Adolf Hitler revitalized the Völkisch movement, making an appeal to the German minority living outside of Germany&#x27;s post-World War I borders and recruiting its members for Nazi intelligence. It was Hitler&#x27;s explicit goal to create a Greater German State by annexing territories of other countries inhabited by German minorities. By March 1939, these ambitions, charges of atrocities on both sides of the German-Polish border, distrust, and rising nationalist sentiment in Nazi Germany led to the complete deterioration of Polish-German relations. Hitler&#x27;s demands for the Polish inhabited Polish Corridor and Polish resistance to Nazi annexation fueled ethnic tensions. For months prior to the 1939 German invasion of Poland, German newspapers and politicians like Adolf Hitler had carried out a national and international propaganda campaign accusing Polish authorities of organizing or tolerating violent ethnic cleansing of ethnic Germans living in Poland.

After armed conflict erupted on 1 September 1939, ethnic Germans living in Poland were in many places subjected to attacks, and the Polish government arrested ten to fifteen thousand on suspicion of being loyal to Germany, marching them toward the east of the country. Eventually, around 2000 ethnic Germans died in such actions. Nazi propagandists used these incidents to claim that the invasion was justified, and the events in Bydgoszcz became emblematic of this.

==The incident==
Beginning with the Nazi invasion of Poland on 1 September, fighting broke out in Bydgoszcz between Polish troops and ethnic Germans in the city, many of whom were later revealed to belonged to clandestine groups organized by the Nazi party. As the Wehrmacht&#x27;s Fourth Army prepared to storm the city of Bydgoszcz on 3 September, the violence intensified, resulting in the deaths of up to 300 ethnic Germans and 40 to 50 Poles. Sources differ on the circumstances of the killings, but it is apparent that at least some were killed in an anti-German pogrom.

The killings were incited by fifth column attacks by ethnic German partisans against the Polish garrison. According to historian Jochen Böhler, recently unearthed German documents confirm that the violence was sparked when Polish soldiers were attacked by agents of the Nazi intelligence organization Abwehr recruited from among the city&#x27;s German minority.

Beginning in early September, the Abwehr reported in documents prepared by general Erwin von Lahousen that German armed saboteurs conducting operations behind the front line in Bydgoszcz suffered heavy losses. Their operations coordinated by Abwehr residents in Bydgoszcz-Grischner are documented in operational reports and plans in Abwehr archives. Among the tasks allocated to armed saboteur groups documented in German archives were: blowing up the main office of the German organization Deutsche Vereinigung, the passport office Deutsche
Paßstelle, the German private school, and setting fire to the German theater and offices of the Jungdeutsche Partei. These operations are documented as coordinated and organized by Schutzstaffel SS.
Additionally a special Abwehr sabotage group was located in Bydgoszcz according to German records from Abwehr Breslau department, called Sabotage-Organisationen Gruppe 12 whose task was to disable a local power-plant and cut phone communications between Inowrocław and Toruń.

Besides these sabotage groups in Bydgoszcz, the Abwehr also recorded in its documents paramilitary groups that were formed in the city. According to German records stored in Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv in Freiburg they counted 150 members in Kampf-Organisation under leadership of a local German named Kleiss and were part of a larger military formation coordinated from Poznan which altogether had 2,077 members. In addition to this group a 10-member combat unit under command of a German named Otto Meister was also formed in Bydgoszcz and received orders from Wrocław local office of Abwehr. By the end of August just before the invasion took place Polish police conducted several arrests during which they found explosives, armbands and guns.

During the night between 2 and 3 September a number of German saboteurs dressed up in Polish uniforms woke up inhabitants of two districts in Bydgoszcz telling them to run as Poland has been defeated, and as a result a significant number of civilians panicked and started fleeing the city. The chaotic flight disrupted and restricted movements of the Polish military on the roads.

By the morning of 3 September a certain few Germans who were in good relationship with their Polish neighbors started warning them to hide as &quot;something bad will happen in the city&quot;, offering them shelter under the condition that they must hide by 10 AM, but stated they could not disclose details on what would take place.

As a contingent of the Polish Army (Army Pomorze&#x27;s 9th, 15th, and 27th Infantry Division) was withdrawing through Bydgoszcz it was attacked by German irregulars from within the city. According to a British witness, a retreating Polish artillery unit was shot at by Germans from within a house; the Poles returned fire and were subsequently shot at from a Jesuit church. In the ensuing fight both sides suffered some casualties; captured German nonuniformed armed insurgents were executed on the spot and some mob lynching was also reported. A Polish investigation concluded in 2004 that Polish troops had been shot at by members of the German minority and German military intelligence (Abwehr) agents; around 40–50 Poles and between 100 and 300 Germans were killed.

The German forces which entered the city also encountered resistance from members of the paramilitary Citizen Watch (&quot;Straż Obywatelska&quot;), particularly in the Szwederowo neighborhood, which was predominantly inhabited by working-class individuals. The Citizen Watch in Bydgoszcz relinquished its weapons after receiving assurances from General Eccard von Gablenz, commander of the &quot;Kampgruppe &quot;Netze&quot;&quot;, that its members would be treated in accordance with international law as POWs.

==German propaganda==

Goebbels&#x27; Propaganda Ministry heavily exploited the events to try to gain support in Germany for the invasion. As British historian Ian Kershaw wrote:
Hitler&#x27;s secret decree of 4 October 1939 stated that all crimes committed by the Germans between 1 September 1939 and 4 October 1939 were not to be prosecuted.

The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau investigation in 1939–1940 claimed that the events were a result of panic and confusion among the Polish troops. The Wehrmacht investigation included the interrogation of captive Polish soldiers, ethnic Germans from Bydgoszcz and surrounding villages, and Polish civilians. The bodies of the victims were exhumed and the cause of death and the possible involvement of military rifles was assessed.

==German reprisals and atrocities==
The events were followed by German reprisals and mass executions of Polish civilians. In an act of retaliation for Bloody Sunday, a number of Polish civilians were executed by German military units of the Einsatzgruppen, Waffen SS, and Wehrmacht. According to German historian Christian Raitz von Frentz, 876 Poles were tried by German tribunal for involvement in the events of Bloody Sunday before the end of 1939. 87 men and 13 women were sentenced without the right to appeal. Polish historian Czesław Madajczyk notes 120 executions in relation to Bloody Sunday, and the execution of 20 hostages after a German soldier was allegedly attacked by a Polish sniper.

The assurances issued to the Citizen Watch which surrendered after being promised that they were to be treated in accordance with international law as POWs were not upheld by the Germans. The captured Citizen Watch members were handed over by the Wehrmacht to members of Einsatzgruppe IV. Approximately 40 prisoners were subjected to fatal beatings by SS men using metal rods. The remaining POWs, which included the leaders of the Citizen Watch, Konrad Fiedler and Marian Maczuga, were executed by gunfire in the Bielawki neighborhood of Bydgoszcz.

Additionally, in the fifty Polish prisoners of war from Bydgoszcz were accused by Nazi summary courts for taking part in &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; and shot. 

According to a German version, Polish snipers attacked German troops in Bydgoszcz for several days (Polish sources and witnesses do not confirm this). The German governor, General Walter Braemer, (the commander of the rear army area), ordered the execution of 80 Polish hostages over the next few days. By September 8, between 200 and 400 Polish civilians had been killed. According to Richard Rhodes, a number of Boy Scouts were set up in the marketplace against a wall and shot; a devoted priest who rushed to administer the last sacrament was shot too, receiving five wounds. Murders continued all week; 34 of the leading tradespeople and merchants of the town were shot, as well as many other leading citizens.

Many Poles, particularly members of the intelligentsia and the Jews, were singled out for deportation, or killed outright. By December 1939 the Germans killed 5,000 Polish civilians from the Bydgoszcz County (about a third from Bydgoszcz itself). These victims included the mayor of Bydgoszcz, Many of those killings took place in a part of the city that became known as the Valley of Death. More broadly, they were also related to the wider Operation Tannenberg, a large scale anti-Polish extermination actions. More than 20,000 Polish citizens of Bydgoszcz (14% of the population) were either shot or died in concentration camps during the occupation.

==The debate in scholarship==
The exact number of victims of Bloody Sunday is disputed. Peter Aurich (a pseudonym of the German journalist Peter Nasarski) put the number of German civilian deaths in Bydgoszcz at 366, while Hugo Rasmus estimates it as at least 415. Two Polish historians, Włodzimierz Jastrzębski and Czesław Madajczyk, estimate ethnic German deaths at 103 (Jastrzębski), and about 300 (150 on September 3, the rest in the days after). The Polish historians point out that since these losses occurred during actual combat, most of the civilian losses should be attributed to accidents common in urban combat conditions; they argue that civilian losses might have occurred when the town was attacked by the German air force (Luftwaffe). Strafing of civilians in the town by the Luftwaffe is confirmed by German witnesses. Nazi propaganda reinforced Polish perceptions of the German minority as hostile, and during the invasion reported that the German minority was aiding the forces. This contributed to Polish misconceptions, as the Poles were expecting the German minority to be actively hostile.

An even bigger debate in the scholarship concerned the question whether—as the Polish historiography suggests—there were indeed any members of a German fifth column in the city who opened fire on the Polish troops (and if so, whether they were composed of members of the Bydgoszcz German minority or not), or whether—as critics among the German historiography argue—Polish troops (or panicking civilians) overreacted in the confusion and targeted innocent German civilians. This debate has been resolved by investigation of German archives, which confirmed existence of several diversion and saboteur groups in Bydgoszcz overseen by intelligence organizations by Nazi Germany. Among the Germans killed in the fighting historians identified Otto Niefeldt who was an Abwehr agent from Szczecin.
The account of Peter Nasarski alias Aurich has been called by Harry Gordon one of the most thorough German accounts; his work is however generally rejected in Poland, perhaps because he indiscriminately used witness statements collected by Nazi officials. According to Nasarski, after police forces retreated from Bydgoszcz, agitated Polish civilians accused many Germans of assaulting Polish soldiers and executed them and any Poles who stood up in their defence. Rasmus attributes the situation to confusion and the disorganised state of the Polish forces in the city.

Von Frentz wrote that &quot;In Bydgoszcz, the event was probably caused by confusion among the rapidly retreating soldiers, a general breakdown in public order and panic among the Polish majority after two German air raids and the discovery of a small reconnaissance group of the German Army on the previous day.&quot; He quotes Nazi German reports about the civilian victims and atrocities, later corroborated by a Red Cross commission that the Nazis invited to the scene. Von Frentz also noted that eyewitness accounts of atrocities committed against the German population are as unreliable as Polish accounts of the fifth columnists. While authors like Blanke write that no ethnic Germans are known to have spoken of participation in that event, by 2007 Nazi documents were uncovered confirming that assistance, supplies and aid were given to both German saboteurs and their families. In the post-war collaboration trials, no ethnic German was charged in relation to Bloody Sunday. Another counterargument that was made to the fifth column theory is that Polish troops were being targeted by advance units of the German regular army (Heer), or that the shots were fired by Polish soldiers in the confusion of the mass withdrawal. Von Frentz claims that Polish troops and civilians massacred German civilians due to confusion.

Polish historians, such as Madajczyk, Jastrzębski, Karol Marian Pospieszalski and Ryszard Wojan claim that the killings were triggered when the ethnic Germans, dressed as civilians, opened fire on the Polish troops (Jastrzebski later changed his views after starting to work with German expellee organizations). The Poles retaliated, killing many and executing prisoners afterwards. Polish historians Pospieszalski and Janusz Kutta point to a Nazi top secret false flag Operation Himmler (which took place on August 31 – September 1) and was designed to create an illusion of Polish aggression against Germany. Thus it is argued that actions like the Gleiwitz incident and events in Bydgoszcz were all part of a larger Nazi plan to discredit the Poles. Pospieszalski and Wojan argue that the German fifth column agents (or their higher-ups) might have been deliberately aiming to produce a situation likely to result in German civilian casualties as a way to fuel Nazi propaganda. This argument has been criticized: Harry Gordon questions whether the Germans were willing to sacrifice their citizens for propaganda gains.

==Recent discussion==
The modern consensus among Polish historians is that the events constituted an attack on the Polish population and military by German militia.

In 2004, historian Tomasz Chinciński in a publication of Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) summarized recent research related to Bloody Sunday, confirming that the majority of historians agree that an &quot;insurrection&quot; by agents who had arrived from the Third Reich as well as some German inhabitants of Bydgoszcz took place. He has published a work detailing new evidence of German diversionary activity in September 1939 in Poland. There are numerous Polish eyewitness accounts of action of a German fifth column which included members of local minority; Pospieszalski cited multiple witnesses for at least 46 cases of German civilians opening fire on Polish troops. There are numerous Polish Army reports and German documents confirming the saboteur actions of armed German Poles in other cities. According to German historians, any members of the fifth column, if present in the city, were infiltrators from Germany, not natives of Bydgoszcz. Eyewitness accounts have been criticised by Richard Blanke. In 2004, Chinciński discussed previously unpublished reports of Polish Army Pomorze, which reported &quot;a large scale diversion&quot; in Bydgoszcz on September 3 and numerous smaller incidents in surrounding area around that time.

A number of Polish and German historians discussed the problem on September 4, 2006, at the German Historical Institute in Warsaw. Chinciński discussed newly discovered documents of the Abwehr that show that there were indeed plans for fifth column and diversion activities in Bydgoszcz; several paramilitary groups were organized by Germany in the city, he discussed the bias of the Polish communist era historiography, which minimized cases of Polish mob lynching of ethnic Germans, which did occur in Bydgoszcz. German historian Hans-Erich Volkmann noted problems with German historiography, outlining some of the unreliability inherent in early post-war studies, which were still significantly affected by the Nazi era, and that the Bydgoszcz events were and still are used for political purposes. By 2007 after several years of studying German archives, documents were uncovered in which General Erwin Lahousen praised action of German saboteurs in Bydgoszcz and organized delivery of supplies and medical help to them. German historian Jochen Böhler, in his publication about the invasion of Poland, published in 2006, wrote that new documents uncovered from the German archives proved that Polish soldiers were attacked by Abwehr agents and members of the German minority.

<text>The Book of Mormon, a work of scripture of the Latter Day Saint movement, is asserted by both itself and Joseph Smith, the founder of the movement, to have been originally written in the Native American writing system of reformed Egyptian characters.

Scholarly reference works on languages do not acknowledge the existence of either a &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; language or &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; script as it was described by Joseph Smith. There is no archaeological, linguistic, or other evidence of the use of Egyptian writing in the ancient Americas.

==Reformed Egyptian and the Book of Mormon==
The Book of Mormon uses the term &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; in only one verse, , which says that &quot;the characters which are called among us the reformed Egyptian, [were] handed down and altered by us, according to our manner of speech&quot; and that &quot;none other people knoweth our language&quot; (). The book also says that its first author, Nephi, used the &quot;learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians&quot; () to write his record which constitutes the first two books of the Book of Mormon. The abridgment that the Book of Mormon says was prepared by Mormon and Moroni nearly a thousand years later in approximately 380 AD, containing most of the balance of the book, was written in &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; because it took less space than Hebrew, which had also been altered after the people left Jerusalem.

Latter-day Saint scholars note that other scripts were developed to write Egyptian through the centuries and have hypothesized that the term &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; refers to a form of Egyptian writing similar to other modified Egyptian scripts such as hieratic, a handwritten form of hieroglyphics thousands of years old by the first millennium BC, or early Demotic, a simplified derivative of hieratic, which was used in northern Egypt fifty years before the time that the Book of Mormon states that prophet-patriarch Lehi left Jerusalem for the Americas (). The archaeological record includes occasional use in the land of Israel, known as Palestinian Hieratic, mostly of isolated hieratic symbols, dating from the 8th through early 6th centuries BC.

Although accounts of the process differ, Smith is said to have translated the reformed Egyptian characters engraved on gold plates into English through various means, including the use of a seer stone or the interpreter stones, or both. Smith said when he had finished the translation, he returned the plates to the angel Moroni, and therefore they are unavailable for study.

==The &quot;Anthon Transcript&quot;==

The &quot;Anthon Transcript&quot; is a piece of paper on which Joseph Smith is said to have reformed Egyptian characters from the golden plates—the ancient record from which Smith claimed to have translated the Book of Mormon. A manuscript known as the &quot;Caractors&quot; document was previously thought to be this transcript. However, handwriting analysis suggests the document was most likely written by John Whitmer, one of the Eight Witnesses. This handwriting analysis casts doubt on the idea that &quot;Caractors&quot; document was the Anthon Transcript because John Whitmer was not affiliated with the Church until June 1829, while the Anthon Transcript was taken to New York in the winter of 1828.

Smith said that when this sample was presented by Smith&#x27;s colleague Martin Harris to Columbia College professor Charles Anthon, a noted classical scholar, that Anthon had attested to the characters&#x27; authenticity in writing but had then ripped up his certification after hearing that the plates had been revealed by an angel. Anthon wrote, to the contrary, that he had believed from the first that Harris was the victim of fraud.

In 1844, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints published a broadside about the Book of Mormon called &quot;The Stick of Joseph&quot; that reprinted some &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; characters that resemble those on the first three lines of the &quot;Caractors&quot; document. The broadside said that the characters were those that had been shown to Anthon. However, it is unlikely that the characters on the broadside came directly from the &quot;Caractors&quot; document because Whitmer was excommunicated in 1838 and took his papers with him.

==Mainstream scholarly view of reformed Egyptian==
Standard language reference works contain no reference to &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; and it is described with this term only in the Book of Mormon. No non-Mormon scholars acknowledge the existence of either a &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; language or a &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; script as it has been described in Mormon belief. For instance, in 1966, John A. Wilson, professor of Egyptology at the University of Chicago, wrote, &quot;From time to time there are allegations that picture writing has been found in America[...] In no case has a professional Egyptologist been able to recognize these characters as Egyptian hieroglyphs. From our standpoint there is no such language as &#x27;reformed Egyptian&#x27;.&quot; Anthropologist Michael D. Coe of Yale University, an expert in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican studies, wrote, &quot;Of all the peoples of the pre-Columbian New World, only the ancient Maya had a complete script.&quot; Fifteen examples of distinct writing systems have been identified in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, many from a single inscription.

==Mormon studies of reformed Egyptian==


Since no outside evidence exists, Mormon studies of reformed Egyptian are limited to whatever linguistic evidence can be obtained from the text of the Book of Mormon plus the extant seven-line &quot;Caractors&quot; document that may or may not be the symbols said to have been copied from the gold plates. Four Mormon non-linguist translators with varying levels of education have attempted to decipher the &quot;Caractors&quot; document. According to Brigham Young University Egyptologist John Gee, &quot;the corpus is not large enough to render decipherment feasible.&quot;

Mormon apologist Terryl Givens has suggested that the characters are early examples of Egyptian symbols being used &quot;to transliterate Hebrew words and vice versa,&quot; that Demotic is a &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot;, and that the mixing of a Semitic language with modified Egyptian characters is demonstrated in inscriptions of ancient Syria and the land of Israel. Other Mormon apologists have suggested that the characters resemble those of shorthand for various languages including Hebrew, Demotic (Egyptian), Hieratic (Egyptian), Coptic (Egyptian), Mayan/Olmec, and Irish ogham ciphers. Hugh Nibley argued that a &quot;revealed text in English&quot; is preferable to trying to understand the original language.
