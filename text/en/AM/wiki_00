<text>The term string quartet refers to either a type of musical composition or a group of four people who play them. Many composers from the mid-18th century onwards wrote string quartets. The associated musical ensemble consists of two violinists, a violist, and a cellist. The double bass is almost never used in the ensemble mainly because it would sound too loud and heavy.

The string quartet was developed into its present form by the Austrian composer Joseph Haydn, whose works in the 1750s established the ensemble as a group of four more-or-less equal partners. Since that time, the string quartet has been considered a prestigious form; writing for four instruments with broadly similar characteristics both constrains and tests a composer. String quartet composition flourished in the Classical era, and Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert each wrote a number of them. Many Romantic and early-twentieth-century composers composed string quartets, including Mendelssohn, Schumann, Brahms, Dvořák, Janáček, and Debussy. There was a slight lull in string quartet composition later in the 19th century, but it received a resurgence in the 20th century, with the Second Viennese School, Bartók, Shostakovich, Babbitt, and Carter producing highly regarded examples of the genre, and it remains an important and refined musical form.

The standard structure for a string quartet as established in the Classical era is four movements, with the first movement in sonata form, allegro, in the tonic key; a slow movement in a related key and a minuet and trio follow; and the fourth movement is often in rondo form or sonata rondo form, in the tonic key.

Some string quartet ensembles play together for many years and become established and promoted as an entity in a manner similar to an instrumental soloist or an orchestra.

==History and development==
=== Early history ===

The early history of the string quartet is in many ways the history of the development of the genre by the Austrian composer Joseph Haydn. There had been examples of divertimenti for two solo violins, viola and cello by the Viennese composers Georg Christoph Wagenseil and Ignaz Holzbauer; and there had long been a tradition of performing orchestral works one instrument to a part. The British musicologist David Wyn Jones cites the widespread practice of four players, one to a part, playing works written for string orchestra, such as divertimenti and serenades, there being no separate (fifth) contrabass part in string scoring before the 19th century. However, these composers showed no interest in exploring the development of the string quartet as a medium. 

The origins of the string quartet can be further traced back to the Baroque trio sonata, in which two solo instruments performed with a continuo section consisting of a bass instrument (such as the cello) and keyboard. A very early example is a four-part sonata for string ensemble by the Italian composer Gregorio Allegri that might be considered an important prototype. By the early 18th century, composers were often adding a third soloist; and moreover it became common to omit the keyboard part, letting the cello support the bass line alone. Thus when Alessandro Scarlatti wrote a set of six works entitled (Sonata for four instruments: two violins, viola, and cello without harpsichord), this was a natural evolution from the existing tradition.

=== Haydn&#x27;s impact ===
The musicologist Hartmut Schick has suggested that Franz Xaver Richter invented the &quot;classical&quot; string quartet around 1757, but the consensus amongst most authorities is that Haydn is responsible for the genre in its currently accepted form. The string quartet enjoyed no recognized status as an ensemble in the way that two violins with basso continuo – the so-called &#x27;trio sonata&#x27; – had for more than a hundred years. Even the composition of Haydn&#x27;s earliest string quartets owed more to chance than artistic imperative. 

During the 1750s, when the young composer was still working mainly as a teacher and violinist in Vienna, he would occasionally be invited to spend time at the nearby castle at Weinzierl of the music-loving Austrian nobleman Karl Joseph Weber, Edler von Fürnberg. There he would play chamber music in an &quot;ad hoc&quot; ensemble consisting of Fürnberg&#x27;s steward, a priest, and a local cellist, and when the Baron asked for some new music for the group to play, Haydn&#x27;s first string quartets were born. It is not clear whether any of these works ended up in the two sets published in the mid-1760s and known as Haydn&#x27;s Opp. 1 and 2 (&#x27;Op. 0&#x27; is a quartet included in some early editions of Op. 1, and only rediscovered in the 1930s), but it seems reasonable to assume that they were at least similar in character.

Haydn&#x27;s early biographer Georg August Griesinger tells the story thus:

The following purely chance circumstance had led him to try his luck at the composition of quartets. A Baron Fürnberg had a place in Weinzierl, several stages from Vienna, and he invited from time to time his pastor, his manager, Haydn, and Albrechtsberger (a brother of the celebrated contrapuntist Albrechtsberger) in order to have a little music. Fürnberg requested Haydn to compose something that could be performed by these four amateurs. Haydn, then eighteen years old, took up this proposal, and so originated his first quartet which, immediately it appeared, received such general approval that Haydn took courage to work further in this form.

Haydn went on to write nine other quartets around this time. These works were published as his Op. 1 and Op. 2; one quartet went unpublished, and some of the early &quot;quartets&quot; are actually symphonies missing their wind parts. They have five movements and take the form: fast movement, minuet and trio I, slow movement, minuet and trio II, and fast finale. As Ludwig Finscher notes, they draw stylistically on the Austrian divertimento tradition.

After these early efforts, Haydn did not return to the string quartet for several years, but when he did so, it was to make a significant step in the genre&#x27;s development. The intervening years saw Haydn begin his employment as Kapellmeister to the Esterházy princes, for whom he was required to compose numerous symphonies and dozens of trios for violin, viola, and the bass instrument called the baryton (played by Prince Nikolaus Esterházy himself). The opportunities for experiment which both these genres offered Haydn perhaps helped him in the pursuit of the more advanced quartet style found in the eighteen works published in the early 1770s as Opp. 9, 17, and 20. These are written in a form that became established as standard both for Haydn and for other composers. Clearly composed as sets, these quartets feature a four-movement layout having broadly conceived, moderately paced first movements and, in increasing measure, a democratic and conversational interplay of parts, close-knit thematic development, and skillful though often restrained use of counterpoint. The convincing realizations of the progressive aims of the Op. 20 set of 1772, in particular, makes them the first major peak in the history of the string quartet. Certainly they offered to their own time state-of-the art models to follow for the best part of a decade; the teenage Mozart, in his early quartets, was among the composers moved to imitate many of their characteristics, right down to the vital fugues with which Haydn sought to bring greater architectural weight to the finales of nos. 2, 5 and 6.

After Op. 20, it becomes harder to point to similar major jumps in the string quartet&#x27;s development in Haydn&#x27;s hands, though not due to any lack of invention or application on the composer&#x27;s part. As Donald Tovey put it: &quot;with Op. 20 the historical development of Haydn&#x27;s quartets reaches its goal; and further progress is not progress in any historical sense, but simply the difference between one masterpiece and the next.&quot;
The musicologist Roger Hickman has however dissented from this consensus view. He notes a change in string quartet writing towards the end of the 1760s, featuring characteristics which are today thought of as essential to the genre – scoring for two violins, viola and cello, solo passages, and absence of actual or potential basso continuo accompaniment. Noting that at this time other composers than Haydn were writing works conforming to these &#x27;modern&#x27; criteria, and that Haydn&#x27;s earlier quartets did not meet them, he suggests that &quot;one casualty [of such a perspective] is the notion that Haydn &quot;invented&quot; the string quartet... Although he may still be considered the &#x27;father&#x27; of the &#x27;Classical&#x27; string quartet, he is not the creator of the sting quartet genre itself... This old and otiose myth not only misrepresents the achievements of other excellent composers, but also distorts the character and qualities of Haydn&#x27;s opp. 1, 2 and 9&quot;. 

The musicologist Cliff Eisen contextualizes the Op. 20 quartets as follows: &quot;Haydn&#x27;s quartets of the late 1760s and early 1770s [opp. 9, 17, and 20] are high points in the early history of the quartet. Characterized by a wide range of textures, frequent asymmetries and theatrical gestures...these quartets established the genre&#x27;s four-movement form, its larger dimensions, and ...its greater aesthetic pretensions and expressive range.&quot;

That Haydn&#x27;s string quartets were already &quot;classics&quot; that defined the genre by 1801 can be judged by Ignaz Pleyel&#x27;s publication in Paris of a &quot;complete&quot; series that year, and the quartet&#x27;s evolution as vehicle for public performance can be judged by Pleyel&#x27;s ten-volume set of miniature scores intended for hearers rather than players – early examples of this genre of music publishing. Since Haydn&#x27;s day, the string quartet has been prestigious and considered one of the true tests of a composer&#x27;s art. This may be partly because the palette of sound is more restricted than with orchestral music, forcing the music to stand more on its own rather than relying on tonal color; or from the inherently contrapuntal tendency in music written for four equal instruments.

=== After Haydn ===
Quartet composition flourished in the Classical era. Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert each composed a number of quartets: &quot;Beethoven in particular is credited with developing the genre in an experimental and dynamic fashion, especially in his later series of quartets written in the 1820s up until his death. Their forms and ideas inspired and continue to inspire musicians and composers, such as Wagner and Bartók.&quot; Schubert&#x27;s last musical wish was to hear Beethoven&#x27;s Quartet in C minor, Op. 131, which he heard on 14 November 1828, just five days before his death. Upon listening to an earlier performance of this quartet, Schubert had remarked, &quot;After this, what is left for us to write?&quot; Wagner, when reflecting on Op. 131&#x27;s first movement, said that it &quot;reveals the most melancholy sentiment expressed in music&quot;. Of the late quartets, Beethoven cited his own favorite as Op. 131, which he saw as his most perfect single work.

Mendelssohn&#x27;s six string quartets span the full range of his career, from 1828 to 1847; Schumann&#x27;s three string quartets were all written in 1842 and dedicated to Mendelssohn, whose quartets Schumann had been studying in preparation, along with those of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. Several Romantic-era composers wrote only one quartet, while Dvořák wrote 14.

=== In the 20th century ===
In the modern era, the string quartet played a key role in the development of Schoenberg (who added a soprano in his String Quartet No. 2), Bartók, and Shostakovich especially. After the Second World War, some composers, such as Messiaen questioned the relevance of the string quartet and avoided writing them. However, from the 1960s onwards, many composers have shown a renewed interest in the genre. 

During his tenure as Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music, Peter Maxwell Davies produced a set of ten entitled the Naxos Quartets (to a commission from Naxos Records) from 2001 to 2007. Margaret Jones Wiles composed over 50 string quartets. David Matthews has written eleven, and Robin Holloway both five quartets and six &quot;quartettini&quot;. Over nearly five decades, Elliott Carter wrote a total of five string quartets; he won Pulitzer Prizes for two of them: No. 2 and No. 3. Three important string quartets were written by Helmut Lachenmann. The late 20th century also saw the string quartet expand in various ways: Morton Feldman&#x27;s vast Second String Quartet is one of the longest ever written, and Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s Helikopter-Streichquartett is to be performed by the four musicians in four helicopters.
==String quartets of the classical period==

Quartets written during the classical period usually had four movements, with a structure similar to that of a symphony:

The positions of the slow movement and third movement are flexible. For example, in Mozart&#x27;s six quartets dedicated to Haydn, three have a minuet followed by a slow movement and three have the slow movement before the minuet.

Substantial modifications to the typical structure were already present by the time of Beethoven&#x27;s late quartets, and despite some notable examples to the contrary, composers writing in the twentieth century increasingly abandoned this structure. Bartók&#x27;s fourth and fifth string quartets, written in the 1930s, are five-movement works, symmetrical around a central movement. Shostakovich&#x27;s final quartet, written in the 1970s, comprises six slow movements.

==Variations of string quartet==
Many other chamber groups can be seen as modifications of the string quartet:
* The string quintet is a string quartet augmented by a fifth string instrument. Mozart employed two violas in his string quintets, while Schubert&#x27;s string quintet utilized two cellos. Boccherini wrote a few quintets with a double bass as the fifth instrument. Most of Boccherini&#x27;s string quintets are for two violins, viola, and two cellos. Another composer who wrote a string quintet with two cellos is Ethel Smyth. 
* The string trio has one violin, a viola, and a cello.
* The piano trio has a piano, a violin, and a cello.
* The piano quintet is a string quartet with an added piano.
* The piano quartet is a string quartet with one of the violins replaced by a piano.
* The clarinet quintet is a string quartet with an added clarinet, such as those by Mozart and Brahms.
* The string sextet contains two each of violins, violas, and cellos. Brahms, for example, wrote two string sextets.
Further expansions have also produced works such as the String octet by Mendelssohn, consisting of the equivalent of two string quartets. Notably, Schoenberg included a soprano in the last two movements of his second string quartet, composed in 1908. Adding a voice has since been done by Milhaud, Ginastera, Ferneyhough, Davies, İlhan Mimaroğlu and many others. Another variation on the traditional string quartet is the electric string quartet with players performing on electric instruments.

Whereas individual string players often group together to make ad hoc string quartets, others continue to play together for many years in ensembles which may be named after the first violinist (e.g. the Takács Quartet), a composer (e.g. the Borodin Quartet) or a location (e.g. the Budapest Quartet). Established quartets may undergo changes in membership whilst retaining their original name.

<text>Anastasio &quot;Tachito&quot; Somoza Debayle (; 5 December 1925 – 17 September 1980) was the 53rd President of Nicaragua from 1967 to 1972 and again from 1974 to 1979. As head of the National Guard, he was &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the country between 1967 and 1979, even during the period when he was not the &quot;de jure&quot; ruler.

Somoza Debayle succeeded his older brother, Luis Somoza Debayle, in office. He was the last member of the Somoza family to be president, ending a dynasty that had been in power since 1937. After insurgents led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (; FSLN) were closing in on Managua in July 1979, Somoza fled Nicaragua. Power was ceded to the Junta of National Reconstruction. He was assassinated in 1980 while in exile in Paraguay.

==Early life and education==

Somoza Debayle, nicknamed &quot;Tachito&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Little Tacho&quot;) by his father, was born in 1925 as the third child of Anastasio Somoza García and Salvadora Debayle. At the age of seven, he was enrolled at the Instituto Pedagógico La Salle, run by the Christian Brothers. One of his classmates was Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal, who later became a journalist and publisher of &quot;La Prensa&quot; newspaper and one of the most prominent opponents of the Somoza dynasty.

From the age of ten, Tachito was educated in the United States. During this period, their father became president of Nicaragua, and served from 1937 to 1947, and again from 1950 into 1956. He and older brother Luis Somoza Debayle both attended St. Leo College Prep (Florida) and La Salle Military Academy on Long Island.

Somoza attended La Salle with Lt. Andrew Edward Tuck III, uncle of American television host Stephen Colbert, and would stay at the family home in Larchmont during the holidays instead of returning to Nicaragua. This led to Somoza going on several dates with Andrew Edward&#x27;s sister and Colbert&#x27;s mother, Lorna.

Somoza Debayle passed the examination for West Point, entered the United States Military Academy on July 3, 1943, and graduated on June 6, 1946.

After his return to Nicaragua, Somoza Debayle was appointed chief of staff of the National Guard (Nicaragua&#x27;s national army), by his father. The president had also appointed numerous family members and close personal friends to other important posts in his government. As commander of the Guard, the young Somoza was head of the nation&#x27;s armed forces, effectively the second-most powerful man in Nicaragua.

Two years after his return from West Point, Somoza Debayle had an affair and fathered a daughter, Patricia. She was later sent to a series of schools abroad.

On 10 December 1950, Somoza married Hope Portocarrero, an American citizen and his first cousin. Their wedding was held at the Cathedral in Managua and officiated by Archbishop Jose Antonio Lezcano. Over 4,000 guests attended the ceremony. The reception was given by Somoza&#x27;s father, President Anastasio Somoza García, in the luxurious and modern Palacio de Comunicaciones.

The couple had five children:
*Anastasio Somoza Portocarrero
*Julio Somoza Portocarrero
*Carolina Somoza Portocarrero, married to James Minskoff Sterling, son of New York real estate developer Henry H. Minskoff
*Carla Somoza Portocarrero
*Roberto Somoza Portocarrero

Somoza and Hope attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.

Following their father&#x27;s assassination on 21 September 1956, Somoza&#x27;s elder brother, Luis, took over the presidency. Anastasio also had a large hand in the government during this time; he helped ensure that the presidency was held by politicians loyal to his family from 1963 to 1967.

==Presidency==
Anastasio was elected president in his own right on 5 February 1967 and took office on 1 May, a few weeks after his brother&#x27;s death. While Luis had ruled more gently than his father, Anastasio shared his father&#x27;s cold intolerance of dissent. His rule soon resembled his father&#x27;s in all significant respects, with harsh repression of dissent.

On education Somoza in his memoirs states &quot;My dream was to provide a University equal to any in the world so that those young men and women with special qualifications could achieve educational equivalency with any student in any part of the world&quot;.

In 1968, Prince Rainier III bestowed Somoza with the Order of St. Charles, Monaco&#x27;s highest honor.

He was due to leave office in May 1972; at the time, Nicaraguan presidents were barred from immediate re-election. However, prior to that, Somoza worked out an agreement that allowed him to stand for re-election in 1974. He would be replaced as president by a three-man junta consisting of two members of his Nationalist Liberal Party and one member from the opposition Conservative while he retained control of the National Guard. Somoza and his triumvirate drew up a new constitution that was ratified by the triumvirate and the cabinet on April 3, 1971. He stepped down as president on May 1, 1972. However, as head of the National Guard, he remained the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the country.

Anastasio Somoza and his son were both part owners of Plasmaferesis. The company collected blood plasma from up to 1,000 of Nicaragua&#x27;s poorest persons every day for sale in the United States and Europe. According to &quot;El Diario Nuevo&quot; and &quot;La Prensa&quot;, &quot;Every morning the homeless, drunks, and poor people went to sell half a liter of blood for 35 (Nicaraguan) cordobas.

On 23 December 1972, an earthquake struck the nation&#x27;s capital, Managua, killing about 5,000 people and virtually destroying the city. The government declared martial law, and Somoza took over &quot;de jure&quot; as well as &quot;de facto&quot; control of the country as head of the National Emergency Committee. He reportedly embezzled a large amount of money from funds sent to Nicaragua from around the world to help rebuild Managua. These reports were debunked by the U.S. House subcommittee on International Development March 9, 1978, stating &quot;Since the 1972 earthquake, 28 major audits, two separate congressional staff surveys, and a General Accounting Office report on reconstruction activities have been completed. We are pleased to note that no diversion or misuse of official U.S. assistance has been revealed by these reports.&quot;

Some parts of Managua have yet to be rebuilt or restored, including the National Cathedral.

Somoza also allegedly exported freshly imported emergency blood plasma abroad at the time of the earthquake, when most medical supplies in Nicaragua were desperately in short supply.

Somoza was re-elected president in the 1974 election. By this time, the Catholic Church had begun to speak out against his government (one of his fiercest critics was Ernesto Cardenal, a leftist Nicaraguan priest who preached liberation theology and was later appointed as the Sandinista government&#x27;s Minister of Culture). By the late 1970s, human rights groups were condemning the record of the Somoza government. Support for the Sandinistas was growing inside and outside the country.

In July 1977, Somoza had a heart attack, and went to the US to recuperate.

==Fall==
In 1975 Somoza Debayle launched a campaign to crush the Sandinistas; individuals suspected of supporting the Front were targeted. The Front, named after Augusto César Sandino (a Nicaraguan rebel leader in the 1920s), began its guerrilla war against the Somozas in 1963. It received funds from the Soviet Union and Cuba under Fidel Castro. Support for the Sandinistas ballooned after the earthquake, especially when U.S. President Jimmy Carter withdrew American support for the regime for human rights reasons, including the televised murder of American journalist Bill Stewart by government soldiers.

At this point, the opposition to the Somozas included not only Sandinistas, but other prominent figures such as publisher Pedro Chamorro (assassinated on January 10, 1978). Israel was the last nation to supply weapons to the Somoza regime. During the 1947–1949 Palestine war when Israel expelled 700,000 Palestinians, Somoza&#x27;s father provided substantial financial support to Israel. President Carter forced the Israeli regime to call back a ship carrying weapons vital to the survival of the Somoza regime.

Because of Somoza&#x27;s status, most of his family members were forced to flee into Honduras, Guatemala, and the United States. It is uncertain where the surviving Somozas live; they changed their names to protect their own lives.

On July 17, 1979, Somoza resigned from the presidency and fled to Miami in a converted Curtiss C-46. He took with him the caskets of his father and brother and, it is claimed, much of Nicaragua&#x27;s national treasure. 
The country was left with $1.6 billion in foreign debt, the highest in Central America. After Somoza had fled, the Sandinistas found less than $2 million in the national treasury.

Denied asylum in the U.S. by President Carter, Somoza later took refuge in Paraguay, then under the rule of Alfredo Stroessner. He bought a ranch and a gated house at Avenida España no. 433 in Asunción, the capital. The president of the Nicaraguan Chamber of Deputies, Francisco Urcuyo, took over as acting president, but lasted only a day before peacefully handing Managua to the Sandinistas.

==Death==
Little more than a year later, Somoza was shot dead in Asunción on September 17, 1980. He was 54 years old. He was ambushed by a seven-strong Sandinista commando team (four men and three women). The action was known as &quot;Operation Reptile&quot;.

The Sandinista team were armed with two Soviet-made machine guns, two AK-47 assault rifles, two automatic pistols, and an RPG-7 rocket launcher, with four anti-tank grenades and two rockets. The leader was Argentinian Marxist revolutionary Enrique Gorriarán Merlo (code named &quot;Ramon&quot;), an ex-Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo member. One of the team members said: &quot;We cannot tolerate the existence of millionaire playboys while thousands of Latin Americans are dying of hunger. We are perfectly willing to give up our lives for this cause.&quot;
The Sandinista team had researched and planned their assault over a time period of more than six months. The team studied Somoza&#x27;s movements via a team member who was staked out at a newspaper kiosk near the estate. The commando team also utilized disinformation tactics to gain access into important residencies under the guise of a famous name, that being Julio Iglesias. They waited in ambush for Somoza in Avenida España. Somoza was often driven about the city in a Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan, which was believed to be unarmored. Team member Oswaldo, disguised as a paper boy, watched Somoza exit the estate and signaled when he was leaving at 10:10 am.

Once in position, Hugo Irurzún (&quot;Capitán Santiago&quot;) readied the RPG-7. He tried to fire an anti-tank rocket at the car, but the RPG-7 misfired. Ramon shot the chauffeur while Irurzún quickly reloaded the RPG with a new rocket. The second rocket directly hit the sedan. Accounts said that the car&#x27;s engine kept running after the rocket explosion. Previously, the commando team had considered the possibility that Somoza&#x27;s vehicle might be equipped with armor panels in front. Worried that it could deflect the rocket projectile, they chose to make a lateral attack on the vehicle. Somoza was killed instantly and burned, along with his new driver, César Gallardo, and Somoza&#x27;s financial advisor, Colombian citizen Jou Baittiner. Later media reports in Paraguay said that Somoza&#x27;s body was so unrecognizable that forensics had to identify him through his feet.

Of the seven assassins, six escaped. Iruzun was killed in a shootout with Paraguayan police the day after the assassination.

Somoza was buried in Miami, at Woodlawn Park Cemetery and Mausoleum, although his father Anastasio Somoza García and brother Luis Somoza Debayle, both prior presidents of Nicaragua, were buried in Nicaragua. A few months before Somoza&#x27;s murder, his memoirs, &quot;Nicaragua Betrayed&quot;, were published. He blamed the Carter administration for his downfall. His son, Anastasio Somoza Portocarrero, went into exile in Guatemala.

Brian Latell, a former US National Intelligence Officer for Latin America and Cuba, argues in his book, &quot;After Fidel&quot;, that the plan to assassinate Somoza was devised in Havana, with direct input from Fidel Castro. According to him, the Sandinistas had won power in July 1979 with the assistance of massive, covert Cuban military aid. Fidel and his brother Raúl Castro purportedly developed a complex, multinational covert action to provide the Sandinistas with huge quantities of modern armaments. Latell claims Cuban intelligence and paramilitary advisors poured into Nicaragua along with the equipment. He says the evidence indicated that Somoza&#x27;s assassination was similar to other such operations in which Cuban intelligence had been involved. He says that Somoza was a long-time nemesis of Castro after having provided critical support to the U.S. in preparing for the Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in April 1961. Jorge Masetti, a former Argentine guerrilla working with Cuban intelligence services, describes the Somoza assassination and also asserts that Cuba had a direct role in planning it in his memoir, &quot;In the Pirate&#x27;s Den&quot; (2002).

Somoza&#x27;s funeral attracted numerous wealthy Nicaraguan and Cuban exiles in South Florida, who protested the left-wing governments of Nicaragua, led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front, and Cuba, led by the Communist Party of Cuba. But some commentators noted that the exiles in Miami were also relieved at Somoza&#x27;s death. The newly founded Contra army, which consisted of many ex-members of Somoza&#x27;s National Guard, would have had to give the impression of having no relation to the old Somoza regime, for purposes of public relations and world opinion.

In 1979, the Brazilian newspaper &quot;Gazeta Mercantil&quot; estimated that the Somoza family&#x27;s fortune amounted to between $2 billion and $4 billion with its head, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, owning $1 billion. At the time he fled the country, he reportedly personally controlled 22 percent of the agricultural land of Nicaragua.

==In popular culture==
Somoza was the subject of the 1983 film &quot;Last Plane Out&quot;, in which he was portrayed by actor Lloyd Battista. The film chronicles journalist Jack Cox&#x27;s journey to Nicaragua, when Somoza was battling insurgents. The same year, he was depicted in &quot;Under Fire&quot;, set during the 1979 Nicaraguan Revolution, this time portrayed by actor René Enriquez. In Warren Beatty&#x27;s &quot;Rules Don&#x27;t Apply&quot;, Somoza is portrayed by Julio Oscar Mechoso.

In Graham Greene&#x27;s novel &quot;The Captain and the Enemy&quot;, the titular character&#x27;s final act is a failed attempt at assassinating Somoza by crashing a plane into his bunker, though Somoza himself never appears in the book.

American comedian Stephen Colbert&#x27;s mother briefly dated him. Colbert still has his pants in his house, as mentioned in the podcast &quot;Strike Force Five&quot;.

<text>A brake is a mechanical device that inhibits motion by absorbing energy from a moving system. It is used for slowing or stopping a moving vehicle, wheel, axle, or to prevent its motion, most often accomplished by means of friction.

==Background==

Most brakes commonly use friction between two surfaces pressed together to convert the kinetic energy of the moving object into heat, though other methods of energy conversion may be employed. For example, regenerative braking converts much of the energy to electrical energy, which may be stored for later use. Other methods convert kinetic energy into potential energy in such stored forms as pressurized air or pressurized oil. Eddy current brakes use magnetic fields to convert kinetic energy into electric current in the brake disc, fin, or rail, which is converted into heat. Still other braking methods even transform kinetic energy into different forms, for example by transferring the energy to a rotating flywheel.

Brakes are generally applied to rotating axles or wheels, but may also take other forms such as the surface of a moving fluid (flaps deployed into water or air). Some vehicles use a combination of braking mechanisms, such as drag racing cars with both wheel brakes and a parachute, or airplanes with both wheel brakes and drag flaps raised into the air during landing.

Since kinetic energy increases quadratically with velocity (formula_1), an object moving at 10 m/s has 100 times as much energy as one of the same mass moving at 1 m/s, and consequently the theoretical braking distance, when braking at the traction limit, is up to 100 times as long. In practice, fast vehicles usually have significant air drag, and energy lost to air drag rises quickly with speed.

Almost all wheeled vehicles have a brake of some sort. Even baggage carts and shopping carts may have them for use on a moving ramp. Most fixed-wing aircraft are fitted with wheel brakes on the undercarriage. Some aircraft also feature air brakes designed to reduce their speed in flight. Notable examples include gliders and some World War II-era aircraft, primarily some fighter aircraft and many dive bombers of the era. These allow the aircraft to maintain a safe speed in a steep descent. The Saab B 17 dive bomber and Vought F4U Corsair fighter used the deployed undercarriage as an air brake.

Friction brakes on automobiles store braking heat in the drum brake or disc brake while braking then conduct it to the air gradually. When traveling downhill some vehicles can use their engines to brake.

When the brake pedal of a modern vehicle with hydraulic brakes is pushed against the master cylinder, ultimately a piston pushes the brake pad against the brake disc which slows the wheel down. On the brake drum it is similar as the cylinder pushes the brake shoes against the drum which also slows the wheel down.

==Types==
Brakes may be broadly described as using friction, pumping, or electromagnetics. One brake may use several principles: for example, a pump may pass fluid through an orifice to create friction:

===Frictional===

Frictional brakes are most common and can be divided broadly into &quot;shoe&quot; or &quot;pad&quot; brakes, using an explicit wear surface, and hydrodynamic brakes, such as parachutes, which use friction in a working fluid and do not explicitly wear. Typically the term &quot;friction brake&quot; is used to mean pad/shoe brakes and excludes hydrodynamic brakes, even though hydrodynamic brakes use friction. Friction (pad/shoe) brakes are often rotating devices with a stationary pad and a rotating wear surface. Common configurations include shoes that contract to rub on the outside of a rotating drum, such as a band brake; a rotating drum with shoes that expand to rub the inside of a drum, commonly called a &quot;drum brake&quot;, although other drum configurations are possible; and pads that pinch a rotating disc, commonly called a &quot;disc brake&quot;. Other brake configurations are used, but less often. For example, PCC trolley brakes include a flat shoe which is clamped to the rail with an electromagnet; the Murphy brake pinches a rotating drum, and the Ausco Lambert disc brake uses a hollow disc (two parallel discs with a structural bridge) with shoes that sit between the disc surfaces and expand laterally.

A drum brake is a vehicle brake in which the friction is caused by a set of brake shoes that press against the inner surface of a rotating drum. The drum is connected to the rotating roadwheel hub.

Drum brakes generally can be found on older car and truck models. However, because of their low production cost, drum brake setups are also installed on the rear of some low-cost newer vehicles. Compared to modern disc brakes, drum brakes wear out faster due to their tendency to overheat.

The disc brake is a device for slowing or stopping the rotation of a road wheel. A brake disc (or rotor in U.S. English), usually made of cast iron or ceramic, is connected to the wheel or the axle. To stop the wheel, friction material in the form of brake pads (mounted in a device called a brake caliper) is forced mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically or electromagnetically against both sides of the disc. Friction causes the disc and attached wheel to slow or stop.

===Pumping===
Pumping brakes are often used where a pump is already part of the machinery. For example, an internal-combustion piston motor can have the fuel supply stopped, and then internal pumping losses of the engine create some braking. Some engines use a valve override called a Jake brake to greatly increase pumping losses. Pumping brakes can dump energy as heat, or can be regenerative brakes that recharge a pressure reservoir called a hydraulic accumulator.

===Electromagnetic===

Electromagnetic brakes are likewise often used where an electric motor is already part of the machinery. For example, many hybrid gasoline/electric vehicles use the electric motor as a generator to charge electric batteries and also as a regenerative brake. Some diesel/electric railroad locomotives use the electric motors to generate electricity which is then sent to a resistor bank and dumped as heat. Some vehicles, such as some transit buses, do not already have an electric motor but use a secondary &quot;retarder&quot; brake that is effectively a generator with an internal short circuit. Related types of such a brake are eddy current brakes, and electro-mechanical brakes (which actually are magnetically driven friction brakes, but nowadays are often just called &quot;electromagnetic brakes&quot; as well).

Electromagnetic brakes slow an object through electromagnetic induction, which creates resistance and in turn either heat or electricity. Friction brakes apply pressure on two separate objects to slow the vehicle in a controlled manner.

==Characteristics==
Brakes are often described according to several characteristics including:

* Peak force – The peak force is the maximum decelerating effect that can be obtained. The peak force is often greater than the traction limit of the tires, in which case the brake can cause a wheel skid.
* Continuous power dissipation – Brakes typically get hot in use and fail when the temperature gets too high. The greatest amount of power (energy per unit time) that can be dissipated through the brake without failure is the continuous power dissipation. Continuous power dissipation often depends on e.g., the temperature and speed of ambient cooling air.
* Fade – As a brake heats, it may become less effective, called brake fade. Some designs are inherently prone to fade, while other designs are relatively immune. Further, use considerations, such as cooling, often have a big effect on fade.
* Smoothness – A brake that is grabby, pulses, has chatter, or otherwise exerts varying brake force may lead to skids. For example, railroad wheels have little traction, and friction brakes without an anti-skid mechanism often lead to skids, which increases maintenance costs and leads to a &quot;thump thump&quot; feeling for riders inside.
* Power – Brakes are often described as &quot;powerful&quot; when a small human application force leads to a braking force that is higher than typical for other brakes in the same class. This notion of &quot;powerful&quot; does not relate to continuous power dissipation, and may be confusing in that a brake may be &quot;powerful&quot; and brake strongly with a gentle brake application, yet have lower (worse) peak force than a less &quot;powerful&quot; brake.
* Pedal feel – Brake pedal feel encompasses subjective perception of brake power output as a function of pedal travel. Pedal travel is influenced by the fluid displacement of the brake and other factors.
* Drag – Brakes have varied amount of drag in the off-brake condition depending on design of the system to accommodate total system compliance and deformation that exists under braking with ability to retract friction material from the rubbing surface in the off-brake condition.
* Durability – Friction brakes have wear surfaces that must be renewed periodically. Wear surfaces include the brake shoes or pads, and also the brake disc or drum. There may be tradeoffs, for example, a wear surface that generates high peak force may also wear quickly.
* Weight – Brakes are often &quot;added weight&quot; in that they serve no other function. Further, brakes are often mounted on wheels, and unsprung weight can significantly hurt traction in some circumstances. &quot;Weight&quot; may mean the brake itself, or may include additional support structure.
* Noise – Brakes usually create some minor noise when applied, but often create squeal or grinding noises that are quite loud.

===Foundation components===
Foundation components are the brake-assembly components at the wheels of a vehicle, named for forming the basis of the rest of the brake system. These mechanical parts contained around the wheels are controlled by the air brake system.

The three types of foundation brake systems are “S” cam brakes, disc brakes and wedge brakes.

===Brake boost===

Most modern passenger vehicles, and light vans, use a vacuum assisted brake system that greatly increases the force applied to the vehicle&#x27;s brakes by its operator. This additional force is supplied by the manifold vacuum generated by air flow being obstructed by the throttle on a running engine. This force is greatly reduced when the engine is running at fully open throttle, as the difference between ambient air pressure and manifold (absolute) air pressure is reduced, and therefore available vacuum is diminished. However, brakes are rarely applied at full throttle; the driver takes the right foot off the gas pedal and moves it to the brake pedal - unless left-foot braking is used.

Because of low vacuum at high RPM, reports of unintended acceleration are often accompanied by complaints of failed or weakened brakes, as the high-revving engine, having an open throttle, is unable to provide enough vacuum to power the brake booster. This problem is exacerbated in vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions as the vehicle will automatically downshift upon application of the brakes, thereby increasing the torque delivered to the driven-wheels in contact with the road surface.

Heavier road vehicles, as well as trains, usually boost brake power with compressed air, supplied by one or more compressors.

==Noise==
Although ideally a brake would convert all the kinetic energy into heat, in practice a significant amount may be converted into acoustic energy instead, contributing to noise pollution.

For road vehicles, the noise produced varies significantly with tire construction, road surface, and the magnitude of the deceleration. Noise can be caused by different things. These are signs that there may be issues with brakes wearing out over time.

==Fires==
Railway brake malfunctions can produce sparks and cause forest fires. In some very extreme cases, disc brakes can become red hot and set on fire. This happened in the Tuscan GP, when the Mercedes car, the W11 had its front carbon disc brakes almost bursting into flames, due to low ventilation and high usage. These fires can also occur on some Mercedes Sprinter vans, when the load adjusting sensor seizes up and the rear brakes have to compensate for the fronts.

==Inefficiency==
A significant amount of energy is always lost while braking, even with regenerative braking which is not perfectly efficient. Therefore, a good metric of efficient energy use while driving is to note how much one is braking. If the majority of deceleration is from unavoidable friction instead of braking, one is squeezing out most of the service from the vehicle. Minimizing brake use is one of the fuel economy-maximizing behaviors.

While energy is always lost during a brake event, a secondary factor that influences efficiency is &quot;off-brake drag&quot;, or drag that occurs when the brake is not intentionally actuated. After a braking event, hydraulic pressure drops in the system, allowing the brake caliper pistons to retract. However, this retraction must accommodate all compliance in the system (under pressure) as well as thermal distortion of components like the brake disc or the brake system will drag until the contact with the disc, for example, knocks the pads and pistons back from the rubbing surface. During this time, there can be significant brake drag. This brake drag can lead to significant parasitic power loss, thus impacting fuel economy and overall vehicle performance.

== Future Trends ==
Due to the high cost of traditional manufacturing techniques for brake pad production, it requires a significant amount of development and production time, including multiple precision machining processes. To avoid these limitations, 3D printing technology can be used to manufacture. This method can increase some economic costs and improve environmental protection.

==History==

===Early brake system ===

In the 1890s, Wooden block brakes became obsolete when Michelin brothers introduced rubber tires.

During the 1960s, some car manufacturers replaced drum brakes with disc brakes.

===Electronic brake system ===

In 1966, the ABS was fitted in the Jensen FF grand tourer.

In 1978, Bosch and Mercedes updated their 1936 anti-lock brake system for the Mercedes S-Class. That ABS is a fully electronic, four-wheel and multi-channel system that later became standard.

In 2005, ESC — which automatically applies the brakes to avoid a loss of steering control — become compulsory for carriers of dangerous goods without data recorders in the Canadian province of Quebec.

Since 2017, numerous United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) countries use &quot;Brake Assist System&quot; (BAS) a function of the braking system that deduces an emergency braking event from a characteristic of the driver&#x27;s brake demand and under such conditions assist the driver to improve braking.

In July 2013 UNECE vehicle regulation 131 was enacted. This regulation defines Advanced Emergency Braking Systems (AEBS) for heavy vehicles to automatically detect a potential forward collision and activate the vehicle braking system.

On 23 January 2020 UNECE vehicle regulation 152 was enacted, defining Advanced Emergency Braking Systems for light vehicles.

From May 2022, in the European Union, by law, new vehicles will have advanced emergency-braking system.

<text>Hydraulics () is a technology and applied science using engineering, chemistry, and other sciences involving the mechanical properties and use of liquids. At a very basic level, hydraulics is the liquid counterpart of pneumatics, which concerns gases. Fluid mechanics provides the theoretical foundation for hydraulics, which focuses on applied engineering using the properties of fluids. In its fluid power applications, hydraulics is used for the generation, control, and transmission of power by the use of pressurized liquids. Hydraulic topics range through some parts of science and most of engineering modules, and they cover concepts such as pipe flow, dam design, fluidics, and fluid control circuitry. The principles of hydraulics are in use naturally in the human body within the vascular system and erectile tissue.

Free surface hydraulics is the branch of hydraulics dealing with free surface flow, such as occurring in rivers, canals, lakes, estuaries, and seas. Its sub-field open-channel flow studies the flow in open channels.

==History==
===Ancient and medieval eras===

Early uses of water power date back to Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt, where irrigation has been used since the 6th millennium BC and water clocks had been used since the early 2nd millennium BC. Other early examples of water power include the Qanat system in ancient Persia and the Turpan water system in ancient Central Asia.

====Persian Empire and Urartu====
In the Persian Empire or previous entities in Persia, the Persians constructed an intricate system of water mills, canals and dams known as the Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System. The project, commenced by Achaemenid king Darius the Great and finished by a group of Roman engineers captured by Sassanian king Shapur I, has been referred to by UNESCO as &quot;a masterpiece of creative genius&quot;. They were also the inventors of the Qanat, an underground aqueduct, around the 9th century BC. Several of Iran&#x27;s large, ancient gardens were irrigated thanks to Qanats.

The Qanat spread to neighboring areas, including the Armenian highlands. There, starting in the early 8th century BC, the Kingdom of Urartu undertook significant hydraulic works, such as the Menua canal.

The earliest evidence of water wheels and watermills date back to the ancient Near East in the 4th century BC, specifically in the Persian Empire before 350 BCE, in the regions of Iraq, Iran, and Egypt.

====China====
In ancient China there was Sunshu Ao (6th century BC), Ximen Bao (5th century BC), Du Shi (circa 31 AD), Zhang Heng (78 – 139 AD), and Ma Jun (200 – 265 AD), while medieval China had Su Song (1020 – 1101 AD) and Shen Kuo (1031–1095). Du Shi employed a waterwheel to power the bellows of a blast furnace producing cast iron. Zhang Heng was the first to employ hydraulics to provide motive power in rotating an armillary sphere for astronomical observation.

====Sri Lanka====

In ancient Sri Lanka, hydraulics were widely used in the ancient kingdoms of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. The discovery of the principle of the valve tower, or valve pit, (Bisokotuwa in Sinhalese) for regulating the escape of water is credited to ingenuity more than 2,000 years ago. By the first century AD, several large-scale irrigation works had been completed. Macro- and micro-hydraulics to provide for domestic horticultural and agricultural needs, surface drainage and erosion control, ornamental and recreational water courses and retaining structures and also cooling systems were in place in Sigiriya, Sri Lanka. The coral on the massive rock at the site includes cisterns for collecting water. Large ancient reservoirs of Sri Lanka are Kalawewa (King Dhatusena), Parakrama Samudra (King Parakrama Bahu), Tisa Wewa (King Dutugamunu), Minneriya (King Mahasen)

====Greco-Roman world====
In Ancient Greece, the Greeks constructed sophisticated water and hydraulic power systems. An example is a construction by Eupalinos, under a public contract, of a watering channel for Samos, the Tunnel of Eupalinos. An early example of the usage of hydraulic wheel, probably the earliest in Europe, is the Perachora wheel (3rd century BC).

In Greco-Roman Egypt, the construction of the first hydraulic machine automata by Ctesibius (flourished c. 270 BC) and Hero of Alexandria (c. 10 – 80 AD) is notable. Hero describes several working machines using hydraulic power, such as the force pump, which is known from many Roman sites as having been used for raising water and in fire engines.

In the Roman Empire, different hydraulic applications were developed, including public water supplies, innumerable aqueducts, power using watermills and hydraulic mining. They were among the first to make use of the siphon to carry water across valleys, and used hushing on a large scale to prospect for and then extract metal ores. They used lead widely in plumbing systems for domestic and public supply, such as feeding thermae.

Hydraulic mining was used in the gold-fields of northern Spain, which was conquered by Augustus in 25 BC. The alluvial gold-mine of Las Medulas was one of the largest of their mines. At least seven long aqueducts worked it, and the water streams were used to erode the soft deposits, and then wash the tailings for the valuable gold content.

====Arabic-Islamic world====
In the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age and Arab Agricultural Revolution (8th–13th centuries), engineers made wide use of hydropower as well as early uses of tidal power, and large hydraulic factory complexes. A variety of water-powered industrial mills were used in the Islamic world, including fulling mills, gristmills, paper mills, hullers, sawmills, ship mills, stamp mills, steel mills, sugar mills, and tide mills. By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic world had these industrial mills in operation, from Al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. Muslim engineers also used water turbines, employed gears in watermills and water-raising machines, and pioneered the use of dams as a source of water power, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines.

Al-Jazari (1136–1206) described designs for 50 devices, many of them water-powered, in his book, &quot;The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices&quot;, including water clocks, a device to serve wine, and five devices to lift water from rivers or pools. These include an endless belt with jugs attached and a reciprocating device with hinged valves.

The earliest programmable machines were water-powered devices developed in the Muslim world. A music sequencer, a programmable musical instrument, was the earliest type of programmable machine. The first music sequencer was an automated water-powered flute player invented by the Banu Musa brothers, described in their &quot;Book of Ingenious Devices&quot;, in the 9th century. In 1206, Al-Jazari invented water-powered programmable automata/robots. He described four automaton musicians, including drummers operated by a programmable drum machine, where they could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns.

===Modern era (c. 1600–1870)===
====Benedetto Castelli and Italian Hydraulics====
In 1619 Benedetto Castelli, a student of Galileo Galilei, published the book &quot;Della Misura dell&#x27;Acque Correnti&quot; or &quot;On the Measurement of Running Waters,&quot; one of the foundations of modern hydrodynamics. He served as a chief consultant to the Pope on hydraulic projects, i.e., management of rivers in the Papal States, beginning in 1626.

The science and engineering of water in Italy from 1500-1800 in books and manuscripts is presented in an illustrated catalog published in 2022.

====Blaise Pascal====
Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) studied fluid hydrodynamics and hydrostatics, centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His discovery on the theory behind hydraulics led to his invention of the hydraulic press, which multiplied a smaller force acting on a smaller area into the application of a larger force totaled over a larger area, transmitted through the same pressure (or exact change of pressure) at both locations. Pascal&#x27;s law or principle states that for an incompressible fluid at rest, the difference in pressure is proportional to the difference in height, and this difference remains the same whether or not the overall pressure of the fluid is changed by applying an external force. This implies that by increasing the pressure at any point in a confined fluid, there is an equal increase at every other end in the container, i.e., any change in pressure applied at any point of the liquid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluids.

====Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille====
A French physician, Poiseuille (1797–1869) researched the flow of blood through the body and discovered an important law governing the rate of flow with the diameter of the tube in which flow occurred.

====In the UK====
Several cities developed citywide hydraulic power networks in the 19th century, to operate machinery such as lifts, cranes, capstans and the like. Joseph Bramah (1748–1814) was an early innovator and William Armstrong (1810–1900) perfected the apparatus for power delivery on an industrial scale. In London, the London Hydraulic Power Company was a major supplier its pipes serving large parts of the West End of London, City and the Docks, but there were schemes restricted to single enterprises such as docks and railway goods yards.

==== Hydraulic models ====
After students understand the basic principles of hydraulics, some teachers use a hydraulic analogy to help students learn other things.
For example:
* The MONIAC Computer uses water flowing through hydraulic components to help students learn about economics.
* The thermal-hydraulic analogy uses hydraulic principles to help students learn about thermal circuits.
* The electronic–hydraulic analogy uses hydraulic principles to help students learn about electronics.

The conservation of mass requirement combined with fluid compressibility yields a fundamental relationship between pressure, fluid flow, and volumetric expansion, as shown below:

: formula_1

Assuming an incompressible fluid or a &quot;very large&quot; ratio of compressibility to contained fluid volume, a finite rate of pressure rise requires that any net flow into the collected fluid volume create a volumetric change.

<text>Aleksandr Mikhailovich Lyapunov (Алекса́ндр Миха́йлович Ляпуно́в, – 3 November 1918) was a Russian mathematician, mechanician and physicist. He was the son of the astronomer Mikhail Lyapunov and the brother of the pianist and composer Sergei Lyapunov.

Lyapunov is known for his development of the stability theory of a dynamical system, as well as for his many contributions to mathematical physics and probability theory.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Lyapunov was born in Yaroslavl, Russian Empire. His father Mikhail Vasilyevich Lyapunov (1820–1868) was an astronomer employed by the Demidov Lyceum. His brother, Sergei Lyapunov, was a gifted composer and pianist. In 1863, M. V. Lyapunov retired from his scientific career and relocated his family to his wife&#x27;s estate at Bolobonov, in the Simbirsk province (now Ulyanovsk Oblast). After the death of his father in 1868, Aleksandr Lyapunov was educated by his uncle R. M. Sechenov, brother of the physiologist Ivan Mikhailovich Sechenov. At his uncle&#x27;s family, Lyapunov studied with his distant cousin Natalia Rafailovna, who became his wife in 1886. In 1870, his mother moved with her sons to Nizhny Novgorod, where he started the third class of the gymnasium. He graduated from the gymnasium with distinction in 1876.

=== Education ===

In 1876, Lyapunov entered the Physico-Mathematical department at the University of Saint Petersburg, but after one month he transferred to the Mathematics department of the university.

Among the Saint Petersburg mathematics professors were Chebyshev and his students Aleksandr Nikolaevich Korkin and Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev. Lyapunov wrote his first independent scientific works under the guidance of the professor of mechanics, D. K. Bobylev. In 1880 Lyapunov received a gold medal for a work on hydrostatics. This was the basis for his first published scientific works &quot;On the equilibrium of a heavy body in a heavy fluid contained in a vessel of a fixed form&quot; and &quot;On the potential of hydrostatic pressure&quot;. Lyapunov also completed his university course in 1880, two years after Andrey Markov who had also graduated at Saint Petersburg University. Lyapunov maintained scientific contact with Markov throughout his life.

=== Teaching and research ===
A major theme in Lyapunov&#x27;s research was the stability of a rotating fluid mass with possible astronomical application. This subject was proposed to Lyapunov by Chebyshev as a topic for his masters thesis which he submitted in 1884 with the title &quot;On the stability of ellipsoidal forms of rotating fluids&quot;. The main contribution was published in the celebrated monograph &#x27;A.M. Lyapunov, The general problem of the stability of motion. 1892. Kharkov Mathematical Society, Kharkov, 251p. (in Russian)&#x27;. This led on to his 1892 doctoral thesis &quot;The general problem of the stability of motion&quot;. The thesis was defended in Moscow University on 12 September 1892, with Nikolai Zhukovsky and V. B. Mlodzeevski as opponents. In 1908, the Kharkov edition was translated to French and republished by the University of Toulouse: &#x27;Probleme General de la Stabilite du Mouvement, Par M.A. Liapounoff. Traduit du russe par M.Edouard Davaux&#x27;.
In 1885, Lyapunov became privatdozent and was proposed to accept the chair of mechanics at Kharkov University, where he went the same year. About the initial stay at Kharkov, Smirnov writes in his biography of Lyapunov:

His student and collaborator, Vladimir Steklov, recalled his first lecture in the following way: &quot;A handsome young man, almost of the age of the other students, came before the audience, where there was also the old Dean, professor Levakovsky, who was respected by all students. After the Dean had left, the young man with a trembled voice started to lecture a course on the dynamics of material points, instead of a course on dynamical systems. This subject was already known to the students from the lectures of professor Delarue. But what Lyapunov taught us was new to me and I had never seen this material in any textbook. All antipathy to the course was immediately blown to dust. From that day students would show Lyapunov a special respect.&quot;

=== Later years ===
Lyapunov returned to Saint Petersburg in 1902, after being elected acting member of the Academy of Science as well as ordinary professor in the Faculty of Applied Mathematics of the university. The position had been left vacant by the death of his former teacher, Chebyshev. Not having any teaching obligations, this allowed Lyapunov to focus on his studies and in particular he was able to bring to a conclusion the work on the problem of Chebyshev with which he started his scientific career.

In 1908, he took part to the Fourth International Mathematical Congress in Rome. He also participated in the publication of Euler&#x27;s selected works: he was an editor of the volumes 18 and 19.

=== Death ===

By the end of June 1917, Lyapunov traveled with his wife to his brother&#x27;s palace in Odessa. Lyapunov&#x27;s wife was suffering from tuberculosis so they moved in accordance with her doctor&#x27;s orders. She died on 31 October 1918. The same day, Lyapunov shot himself in the head, and three days later he died. By that time, he was going blind from cataracts.

== Work ==

Lyapunov contributed to several fields, including differential equations, potential theory, dynamical systems and probability theory. His main preoccupations were the stability of equilibria and the motion of mechanical systems, especially rotating fluid masses, and the study of particles under the influence of gravity. His work in the field of mathematical physics regarded the boundary value problem of the equation of Laplace. In the theory of potential, his work from 1897 &quot;On some questions connected with Dirichlet&#x27;s problem&quot; clarified several important aspects of the theory. His work in this field is in close connection with the work of Steklov. Lyapunov developed many important approximation methods. His methods, which he developed in 1899, make it possible to define the stability of sets of ordinary differential equations. He created the modern theory of the stability of a dynamical system. In the theory of probability, he generalized the works of Chebyshev and Markov, and proved the Central Limit Theorem under more general conditions than his predecessors. The method of characteristic functions he used for the proof later found widespread use in probability theory.

Like many mathematicians, Lyapunov preferred to work alone and communicated mainly with few colleagues and close relatives. He usually worked late, four to five hours at night, sometimes the whole night. Once or twice a year he visited the theatre, or went to some concert. He had many students. He was an honorary member of many universities, an honorary member of the academy in Rome and a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences in Paris.

Lyapunov&#x27;s impact was significant, and the following mathematical concepts are named after him: 
* Lyapunov equation
* Lyapunov exponent
* Lyapunov function
* Lyapunov fractal
* Lyapunov stability
* Lyapunov&#x27;s central limit theorem
* Lyapunov vector

<doc id="65426" wikidata="Q795000" url="?curid=65426" title="Black supremacy">
<text>Black supremacy is a racial supremacist belief which maintains that black people are inherently superior to people of other races.

==Historical usage==
Black supremacy was advocated by Jamaican preacher Leonard Howell in the 1935 Rastafari movement tract &quot;The Promised Key&quot;. Howell&#x27;s use of &quot;Black Supremacy&quot; had both religious and political implications. Politically, as a direct counterpoint to white supremacy, and the failure of white governments to protect black people, he advocated the destruction of white governments. Howell had drawn upon as an influence the work of the earlier proto-Rastafari preacher Fitz Balintine Pettersburg, in particular the latter&#x27;s book &quot;The Royal Parchment Scroll of Black Supremacy&quot;.

The Associated Press described the teachings of the Nation of Islam (NOI) as having been black supremacist until 1975, when W. Deen Mohammed succeeded Elijah Muhammad (his father) as its leader. Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s black-supremacist doctrine acted as a counter to the supremacist paradigm established and controlled by white supremacy. The SPLC described the group as having a &quot;theology of innate black superiority over whites – a belief system vehemently and consistently rejected by mainstream Muslims&quot;.

==Groups associated with black supremacist views==

Several fringe groups have been described as either holding or promoting black supremacist beliefs. A source described by historian David Mark Chalmers as being &quot;the most extensive source on right-wing extremism&quot; is the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), an American nonprofit organization that monitors hate groups and extremists in the United States. Authors of the SPLC&#x27;s quarterly &quot;Intelligence Reports&quot; have described the following groups as holding black supremacist views:
* The Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ (ICGJC), which is headquartered in New York City, was described in 2008 by the SPLC as an American &quot;black supremacist sect&quot; and part of the growing &quot;black supremacist wing of the Hebrew Israelite movement&quot;. The ICGJC accepts the Old and New Testaments and the Apocrypha as inspired Scripture and has an apocalyptic view of the end of the world.
* The Israelite School of Universal Practical Knowledge (ISUPK), based in the Upper Darby Township of Philadelphia.
* The Nation of Islam (NOI) is a religious organization founded by Wallace Fard Muhammad in the United States in 1930. They have been described by the SPLC as having &quot;a theology of innate black superiority over whites&quot;. SPLC cites the NOI leaders&#x27; &quot;deeply racist, antisemitic and anti-LGBT rhetoric&quot; as reasons for the organization being categorized as a hate group.
* The Nation of Yahweh is a religious group based in the United States described as black supremacist by the SPLC. It is an offshoot of the Black Hebrew Israelite line of thought. It was founded by American Yahweh ben Yahweh (born Hulon Mitchell Jr.), whose name means &quot;God the Son of God&quot; in Hebrew. The Nation of Yahweh grew rapidly throughout the 1980s and at its height had headquarters in Miami, Florida, and temples in 22 states, ben Yahweh was imprisoned for 11 years for his links to nearly two dozen murders, and later released on restrictive parole.
* The United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors was founded by the American Dwight York, who has been described by the SPLC as advocating the belief that black people are superior to white people. The SPLC reported that York&#x27;s teachings included the belief that &quot;whites are &#x27;devils&#x27;, devoid of both heart and soul, their color the result of leprosy and genetic inferiority&quot;. The SPLC described the Nuwaubianism belief system as &quot;mix[ing] black supremacist ideas with worship of the Egyptians and their pyramids, a belief in UFOs and various conspiracy theories related to the Illuminati and the Bilderbergers&quot;.

== Opposition from Martin Luther King Jr. ==
During speeches given at the Freedom Rally in Cobo Hall on June 23, 1963, at Oberlin College in June 1965, and at the Southern Methodist University on March 17, 1966, Martin Luther King Jr. said:

<doc id="65427" wikidata="Q2707688" url="?curid=65427" title="Plainsong">
<text>Plainsong or plainchant (calque from the French &quot;plain-chant&quot;; ) is a body of chants used in the liturgies of the Western Church. When referring to the term plainsong, it is those sacred pieces that are composed in Latin text. Plainsong was the exclusive form of the Western Christian church music until the ninth century, and the introduction of polyphony.

The monophonic chants of plainsong have a non-metric rhythm, which is generally considered freer than the metered rhythms of later Western music. They are also traditionally sung without musical accompaniment, though recent scholarship has unearthed a widespread custom of accompanied chant that transcended religious and geographical borders.

There are three types of chant melodies that plainsongs fall into: syllabic, neumatic, and melismatic. The free flowing melismatic melody form of plainsong is still heard in Middle Eastern music being performed today.

Although the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches did not split until long after the origin of plainsong, Byzantine chants are generally not classified as plainsong.

==History==
Plainsong developed during the earliest centuries of Christianity, influenced possibly by the music of the Jewish synagogue and certainly by the Greek modal system. It has its own system of notation.

As the number of chants in the church&#x27;s repertoire increased, officials needed a better way to standardize the music. A unique form of musical notation was developed to help standardize the music and provide a reference for the performers and audience alike. The musical notations that were used were called neumes, and they are employed on a four-line staff, unlike the five-line staff we are accustomed to today. The neumes are placed above the chant&#x27;s words to help the performer identify the piece&#x27;s melody but did not specify the pitches or intervals that needed to be sung. Even though there were written musical manuscripts, the performers still needed to memorize the chants through oral traditions before interpreting the notation. It was not until the eleventh century that musical pitches were being integrated into written music.

Most of the early plainsong scripts have been destroyed due to war, purposeful destruction and natural causes such as water, fire, and poor environmental conditions. The Toledo Cathedral in Spain has one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of indigenous plainsong manuscripts devoted to Western Christianity. Their collection consists of 170 volumes of plainsong chants for the procession, Mass, and Office.

There are three methods of singing psalms or other chants, responsorial, antiphonal, and solo. In responsorial singing, the soloist (or choir) sings a series of verses, each one followed by a response from the choir (or congregation). In antiphonal singing, the verses are sung alternately by soloist and choir, or by choir and congregation. It is probable that even in the early period the two methods caused the differentiation in the style of musical composition which is observed throughout the later history of plain chant, the choral compositions being of a simple kind, the solo compositions more elaborate, using a more extended compass of melodies and longer groups of notes on single syllables. The last type of plainsong performance is the solo performed by the choir or the individual performer. A marked feature in plainchant is the use of the same melody for various texts. This is quite typical for the ordinary psalmody in which the same formula, the &quot;psalm tone&quot;, is used for all the verses of a psalm, just as in a hymn or a folk song the same melody is used for the various stanzas.

Gregorian chant is a variety of plainsong named after Pope Gregory I (6th century A.D.), but Gregory did not invent the chant. The tradition linking Gregory I to the development of the chant seems to rest on a possibly mistaken identification of a certain &quot;Gregorius&quot;, probably Pope Gregory II, with his more famous predecessor. The term Gregorian Chant is often incorrectly used as a synonym of plainsong.

For several centuries, different plainchant styles existed concurrently. Standardization on Gregorian chant was not completed, even in Italy, until the 12th century. Plainchant represents the first revival of musical notation after knowledge of the ancient Greek system was lost.

In the late 9th century, plainsong began to evolve into organum, which led to the development of polyphony. When polyphony reached its climax in the sixteenth century, the use of plainsong chant was less appealing and almost completely abandoned.

There was a significant plainsong revival in the 19th century, when much work was done to restore the correct notation and performance-style of the old plainsong collections, notably by the monks of Solesmes Abbey, in northern France. After the Second Vatican Council and the introduction of the vernacular Mass, use of plainsong in the Catholic Church declined and was mostly confined to the monastic orders and to ecclesiastical societies celebrating the traditional Latin Mass (also called &quot;Tridentine Mass&quot;). Since Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s &quot;motu proprio&quot;, &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;, use of the Tridentine rite has increased; this, along with other papal comments on the use of appropriate liturgical music, is promoting a new plainsong revival.

The Plainsong and Medieval Music Society was founded in 1888 to promote the performance and study of liturgical chant and medieval polyphony.

Interest in plainsong picked up in 1950s Britain, particularly in the left-wing religious and musical groups associated with Gustav Holst and the writer George B. Chambers. In the late 1980s, plainchant achieved a certain vogue as music for relaxation, and several recordings of plainchant became &quot;classical-chart hits&quot;.

<text>Nizhny Novgorod ( ; ; colloquially shortened to Nizhny) is a city and the administrative centre of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and the Volga Federal District in Russia. The city is located at the confluence of the Oka and the Volga rivers in Central Russia, with a population of over 1.2 million residents, up to roughly 1.7 million residents in the urban agglomeration. Nizhny Novgorod is the sixth-largest city in Russia, the second-most populous city on the Volga, as well as the Volga Federal District. The city is located 420 kilometers (260 mi) east of Moscow. It is an important economic, transportation, scientific, educational and cultural centre in Russia and the vast Volga-Vyatka economic region, and the main centre of river tourism in Russia. In the historic part of the city there are many universities, theatres, museums and churches.

The city was founded on 4 February 1221 by Prince George II of Vladimir. In 1612, Kuzma Minin and Prince Dmitry Pozharsky organized an army for the liberation of Moscow and all Russia from the Poles and Lithuanians. In 1817, Nizhny Novgorod became a great trade centre of the Russian Empire. In 1896, at a fair, an All-Russia Exhibition was organized. During the Soviet period, the city turned into an important industrial centre, and was known as Gorky. In particular, the Gorky Automobile Plant was constructed in this period. Around this time, the city was given the nickname &quot;Russian Detroit&quot;. Shortly before the dissolution of the Soviet Union the city was renamed Nizhny Novgorod once again. In 1985, the Nizhny Novgorod Metro was opened. In 2016, Vladimir Putin opened the new 70th Anniversary of Victory Plant, which is part of the Almaz-Antey Air and Space Defence Corporation.

The Kremlin – the historic centre of the city – contains the main government agencies of the city and the Volga Federal District. The demonym for a Nizhny Novgorod resident is “нижегородец” (&quot;nizhegorodets&quot;) for male or “нижегородка” (&quot;nizhegorodka&quot;) for female, rendered in English as &quot;Nizhegorodian&quot;. &quot;Novgorodian&quot; is improper; it refers to a resident of Veliky Novgorod. Nizhny Novgorod was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

== History ==
=== Name ===
Originally, the name was just Novgorod (“Newtown&quot;), but to distinguish it from the other, older and well-known Novgorod (Veliky Novgorod) to the west, the city was commonly called “Novgorod of the Lower lands,&quot; or “Lower Newtown.” This land was named “lower” (&quot;nizhniy&quot; (нижний)), even though it is actually higher in altitude than Veliky Novgorod, because it is situated downstream of other Russian cities such as Moscow, Vladimir and Murom.

From 1932 to 1990, the city was known as Gorky (, ).

=== Seat of medieval princes ===

The city traces its origin from a small Russian wooden hillfort that was founded by grand prince Yuri II of Vladimir in 1221 at the confluence of two of the most important rivers in his principality, the Volga and Oka rivers. It marked the eastern extreme of East Slavic settlement until the end of the medieval period, with Russian expansion eastward delayed until the
capture of Kazan in 1552.

The independent existence of the medieval fort was threatened by the continuous Mordvin attacks against it; the major attempt made by forces under Purgaz in April 1229 was repulsed. After the death of Yuri II on 4 March 1238 at the Battle of the Sit River, the Mongols occupied the fortress. Later a major stronghold for border protection, the fortress of Nizhny Novgorod took advantage of a natural moat formed by the two rivers.

Along with Moscow and Tver, Nizhny Novgorod was among several newly founded towns that escaped devastation during the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27; on account of their insignificance, but grew into great centres in Russian political life during the hegemony of the Golden Horde. With the agreement of the Khan, Nizhny Novgorod was incorporated into the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality in 1264. After 86 years its importance further increased when the seat of the powerful Suzdal Principality was moved there from Gorodets in 1350. Grand Duke Dmitry Konstantinovich (1323–1383) sought to make his capital a rival worthy of Moscow; he built a stone citadel and several churches and was a patron of historians. The earliest extant manuscript of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, the &quot;Laurentian Codex&quot;, was written for him by the local monk Laurentius in 1377.

=== Fortress city ===
After the city&#x27;s incorporation into the Grand Principality of Moscow in 1392, the local princes took the name Shuysky and settled in Moscow, where they were prominent at the court and briefly ascended the throne in the person of Vasily I of Moscow. After being burnt by the powerful Crimean Tatar chief Edigu in 1408, Nizhny Novgorod was restored and regarded by the Muscovites primarily as a great stronghold in their wars against the Tatars of Kazan. The enormous red-brick Kremlin, one of the strongest and earliest preserved citadels in Russia, was built in 1508–1511 under the supervision of Pietro Francesco. The fortress was strong enough to withstand Tatar sieges in 1520 and 1536.

In 1612, the so-called &quot;national militia&quot;, gathered by a local merchant, Kuzma Minin, and commanded by Knyaz Dmitry Pozharsky expelled the Polish troops from Moscow, thus putting an end to the “Time of Troubles” and establishing the rule of the Romanov dynasty. The main square in front of the Kremlin is named after Minin and Pozharsky, although it is locally known simply as Minin Square. Minin&#x27;s remains are buried in the citadel. In commemoration of these events, on 21 October 2005, an exact copy of the Red Square statue of Minin and Pozharsky was placed in front of St John the Baptist Church, which is believed to be the place from where the call to the people had been proclaimed.

In the course of the following century, the city prospered commercially and was chosen by the Stroganovs, the wealthiest merchant family of Russia, as a base for their operations. A particular style of architecture and icon painting, known as the Stroganov school, developed there at the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries.

The historical coat of arms of Nizhny Novgorod in 1781 was a red deer with black horns and hooves on a white field. The modern coat of arms from 2006 is the same, with a ribbon of order of Lenin and gold crown from above.

=== Commercial centre ===

In 1817, the Makaryev Fair, one of the liveliest in the world, was transferred to Nizhny Novgorod and started to attract millions of visitors annually. By the mid-19th century, the city was firmly established as the trade capital of the Russian Empire. The world&#x27;s first radio receiver by engineer Alexander Popov and the world&#x27;s first hyperboloid tower and lattice shell-coverings by engineer Vladimir Shukhov were demonstrated at the All-Russia industrial and art exhibition in Nizhny Novgorod in 1896. According to official Imperial Russian statistics, the population of Nizhny Novgorod as of 14 January 1913 was 97,000.

The largest industrial enterprise was the Sormovo Iron Works which was connected by the company&#x27;s own railway to Moskovsky railway station in the Lower City of Nizhny Novgorod. The Kazansky railway station was in the Upper city. Other industries gradually developed, and by the start of the 20th century, the city was also a first-rank industrial hub. Henry Ford helped build a large truck and tractor plant (GAZ) in the late 1920s, sending engineers and mechanics, including future labour leader Walter Reuther.

=== Soviet era ===
There were no permanent bridges over the Volga or Oka before the October Revolution in 1917. Temporary bridges were built during the trade fair. The first bridge over the Volga was started by the Moscow–Kazan Railway Company in 1914, but only finished in the Soviet Era when the railway to Kotelnich was opened for service in 1927.

The Marxist activist and Tsarist dissident Maxim Gorky was born in Nizhny Novgorod in 1868 as Alexey Maximovich Peshkov. In his novels he described the dismal life of the city proletariat. When he returned to the Soviet Union in 1932 on the invitation of Joseph Stalin, the city was renamed Gorky. The city bore Gorky&#x27;s name until 1990. His childhood home is preserved as a museum, known as the Kashirin House, after Alexey&#x27;s grandfather who owned the place.

During World War II, from 1941 to 1943, Gorky was subjected to air raids and bombardments by Germany. The Germans tried to destroy the city industry because it was a major supplier of military equipment to the front. Of the attacks made in the rear of the Soviet Union, these became the most powerful in the entire duration of the war.

During much of the Soviet era, the city was closed to foreigners to safeguard the security of Soviet military research and production facilities, even though it was a popular stopping point for Soviet tourists travelling up and down the Volga in tourist boats. Unusually for a Soviet city of that size, even street maps were not available for sale until the mid-1970s. In 1970, by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the city was awarded the Order of Lenin. Mátyás Rákosi, the former Stalinist General Secretary of Hungary&#x27;s communist party, died in exile there in 1971. On , in the city the first section of the metro was launched. The physicist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei Sakharov was exiled there during 1980–1986 to limit his contacts with foreigners. An end to the “closed” status of the city accompanied the reinstatement of the city&#x27;s original name in 1990.

=== Post-Soviet era ===
The 800th anniversary of Nizhny Novgorod was celebrated on 21 August 2021. It celebrated the history and the great people who came from the city. The climax of the celebration was the city&#x27;s 800th Anniversary Gala Show. Natalia Vodianova gave a speech and Vladimir Putin was in attendance. The Central Bank of Russia issued commemorative coins to honor the 800th anniversary.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Nizhny Novgorod is the administrative centre (capital) of Volga Federal District and Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one resort settlement and twelve rural localities, incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Nizhny Novgorod—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Nizhny Novgorod is incorporated as Nizhny Novgorod Urban Okrug.
In December 2011, Marat Safin was elected to the Russian Parliament as a member of Vladimir Putin&#x27;s United Russia Party, representing Nizhny Novgorod.

==City layout and divisions==
Nizhny Novgorod is divided by the Oka River into two distinct parts. The Upper City (, &quot;Nagornaya chast&quot;, &quot;Mountainous part&quot;) is located on the hilly eastern (right) bank of the Oka. It includes three of the eight city districts into which the city is administratively divided:

# Nizhegorodsky (the Kremlin, the historical and administrative centre of the city);
# Prioksky
# Sovetsky

The Lower City (, &quot;Zarechnaya chast&quot;, &quot;Over river part&quot;) occupies the low (western) side of the Oka, and includes five city districts:
# Avtozavodsky (built around the Gorky Automobile Plant);
# Kanavinsky (the site of the Nizhny Novgorod Fair and the location of the main train station);
# Leninsky.
# Moskovsky (home of the Sokol Aircraft Plant and its airfield);
# Sormovsky (where Krasnoye Sormovo and the Volga Shipyard are located);
All of today&#x27;s lower city was annexed by Nizhny Novgorod in 1929–1931.

==Demographics==
*Population: 
*Births (2009): 12,934

===Climate===
In 1834, the first weather station was opened in Nizhny Novgorod. A century later it transformed into Gorky Hydrometeorological service; since 1978, it has been known as the Higher Volga hydrometeorology and natural habitat control department.

The climate in the region is continental, specifically humid continental (&quot;Dfb&quot;), and it is similar to the climate in Moscow, although colder in winter, which lasts from late November until late March with a permanent snow cover. Average temperatures range from in July to in January. Average annual temperature is , wind speed 2.8 m/s, air humidity 76%. Being far enough away from the Baltic Sea for maritime effects to lower, Nizhny Novgorod has similar winters to Bothnian Bay climates near the Arctic Circle, but instead has very warm summers for its latitude.

Nizhny receives on average 1,775 hours of sunshine a year. The maximum duration of daylight is in June (17 hours 44 minutes), and the minimum in December (6 hours 52 minutes).

== Government and politics ==
Nizhny Novgorod constituency for the State Duma.

=== Government ===

The city of Nizhny Novgorod is governed by the city administration and the City Duma. The mayor of the city may be the chairman of the City Duma; however, it may be another person.

The mayor is at the head of the city. The city administration and the city duma are subordinate to him. There are no direct elections of the mayor for city residents. The mayor is appointed by the decision of the City Duma. Since 28 October 2020, Yuri Shalabaev has been the mayor of Nizhny Novgorod.

District heads are not elected.

=== Politics ===

From 1991 to 2009, the mayor of the city was elected by the townspeople for a term of 5 years. During this time, four people have been in this post: Dmitry Bednyakov, Ivan Sklyarov, Yuri Lebedev, Vadim Bulavinov (twice).

In recent years, the role of the regional government headed by the governor in city affairs has significantly increased.

On 25 October 2010, the position of mayor was abolished and instead two formal positions appeared - the head of the city and the head of the administration. Oleg Sorokin was elected mayor of the city. At an extraordinary meeting of the City Duma on 3 December 2010, Oleg Kondrashov was approved as the head of the administration of Nizhny Novgorod.

On 22 July 2015, by the decision of the City Duma of Nizhny Novgorod, Kondrashov was removed from his post. Since then, he has been wanted by the police. On 19 December 2017, the mayor of the city, Oleg Sorokin, was arrested. On 7 March 2019, the Nizhny Novgorod District Court sentenced him to 10 years in a strict regime colony with a fine of 460.8 million rubles.

On 7 October 2015, Ivan Karnilin became the head of the city. In December 2016, opposition blogger Alexei Navalny published a video of his investigation, featuring Karnilin as the hero. As it turned out, it is possible that his ex-wife bought two apartments in Miami in 2013 and 2014 for a total of almost $2 million. On 23 May 2017, Karnilin wrote a letter of resignation, which was adopted by the City Duma. All this time, an anti-corruption check was going on, which began long before the “investigation” of Alexei Navalny.

After Ivan Karnilin, the last position of the head of the city was held by Elizaveta Solonchenko, who held it from 21 June to 20 December 2017. After that, the post of mayor of the city returned, which was taken by Vladimir Panov. He held this position from 17 January 2018 to 6 May 2020. Panov resigned ahead of schedule in connection with the transfer to a new position of Deputy Chairman of the State Commission for the Development of the Arctic.

Since 6 May 2020, Yury Shalabaev has taken the post of mayor. He introduced the practice of weekly online meetings with city residents in his Telegram channel. This significantly affected the speed of execution of various instructions and control. Shalabaev works closely with Governor Gleb Nikitin. Under his mayorship, a large-scale modernization of public transport continues: the purchase of new transport, the introduction of contactless payment, the construction of new metro stations. The quality of roads has also improved. The system of Nizhny Novgorod central diameters was launched.

=== City symbols ===
The historical coat of arms of Nizhny Novgorod was approved on 16 August 1781.

The coat of arms and flag of the city depicts a red deer, which is a symbol of nobility, purity and greatness, life, wisdom and justice. The current city coat of arms and flag were adopted on 20 December 2006.

The coat of arms of the city of Nizhny Novgorod is an image of a deer on a French heraldic shield, framed on the sides and bottom with a ribbon of the Order of Lenin. Above the upper part of the coat of arms there is a five-toothed crown, showing that Nizhny Novgorod is an urban district - the capital of the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast.

The unofficial historical symbols of the city are also the Dmitrievskaya Tower of the Kremlin, the Spit and the Chkalov Stairs.

==Economy==
Since the reign of Emperor Alexander III, Nizhny Novgorod has become the centre of all-Russian merchants. On 15 July 1822 the largest Nizhny Novgorod fair was solemnly opened on the left bank of the Oka. Then Nizhny Novgorod became the main city of all-Russian and international trade. In 1929, the Fair was closed, and the city&#x27;s economy began to develop in a completely different direction.

The Soviet city of Gorky became one of the largest industrial centres in Russia, the leading role in which belonged to the enterprises of mechanical engineering, metalworking and information technology. At the same time, the first auto giant, the Gorky Automobile Plant, was built.

The very foundation of the city at the confluence of two navigable rivers predetermined both its military-strategic and commercial significance. Local merchants traded not only with Moscow, Kazan, Yaroslavl, Astrakhan, but also with the cities of Europe and Central Asia. In May 1767, during the royal visit of Empress Catherine II, she ordered the creation of a new enterprise, the Nizhny Novgorod Trading Company.
The main factor in the formation of Nizhny Novgorod as the main trading centre of Russia at the beginning of the 19th century was the transfer here in 1817 of the Makariev Fair.

At the expense of the treasury, under the general project and under the leadership of Augustine de Betancourt, the largest guest complex in Europe was created. At the stage before 1822, the Cathedral of the Savior was built according to the project of Auguste de Montferrand, 3 administrative, 4 “Chinese” wooden and 56 brick buildings with thousands of shops, hotels, taverns and a summer theatre. For the first time in Europe, sewerage was provided here. At the second stage, the complex of the Cathedral of the Savior was completed, a mosque and an Armenian-Gregorian church were built. The third stage marked a strict rectangular redevelopment of the fair with the paving of all streets, the creation of a number of new places of worship, including the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, a three-story commercial building, called the Persian Caravanserai, was erected near the mosque. The fourth stage was the last in a series of reconstructions and included: the construction of the stone circus of the Nikitin brothers, the Brazilian passage on theatre Square, the new Main Fair House in the Russian style, which became one of the largest passages of the Russian Empire.

The current Nizhny Novgorod fair is an interactive museum. The inauguration of the governor and various official events are held in the armorial hall.

Currently, trade in Nizhny Novgorod is represented mainly by its retail sector. In the 1990s, Belinsky Street was actively built up with shopping centres. In the mid-2000s, three shopping centres were built on the territory of Old Kanavino near the Railway Station, on Revolution Square. In 2008, in the very centre of Nizhny Novgorod, near the historical quarter known as the Black Pond, the Lobachevsky Plaza business centre was built, which was recognized as one of the best architectural projects of 2009.

In January 2019, Nizhny Novgorod was recognized as the best city in Russia in terms of quality of life. It took first place among Russian cities and 109th in the world in terms of quality of life. The rating was compiled by the website numbeo.com, which specializes in statistics on the cost of living and consumer prices in different countries of the world. When compiling the rating, the purchasing power of the population, safety, health care, the cost of living, the ratio of real estate prices and incomes of the population, traffic congestion, the level of environmental pollution, and climate were taken into account.

In 2022, the average nominal salary in Nizhny Novgorod, according to Federal State Statistics Service, was 45,795 rubles.

===Information technology===
Nizhny Novgorod is one of the centres of the IT industry in Russia. It ranks among the leading Russian cities in terms of the quantity of software R&amp;D providers. Intel has a big software research and development centre with more than 500 engineers in the city, as well as a major data centre. In 2022 Intel suspended business operations in Nizhny Novgorod.

In Nizhny Novgorod, there are also a number of offshore outsourcing software developers, including Bell Integrator, Itseez, Tecom, Luximax Systems Ltd, MERA, RealEast Networks, Auriga, SoftDrom and Teleca, as well as many other smaller companies specialising in the delivery of services to telecommunication vendors.

There are 25 scientific R&amp;D institutions focusing on telecommunications, radio technology, theoretical and applied physics, and 33 higher educational institutions, among them are Nizhny Novgorod State University, Nizhny Novgorod State Technical University, Privolzhsky Research Medical University, as well as Nizhny Novgorod Institute of Information Technologies, that focuses on information technologies, software development, system administration, telecommunications, cellular networks, Internet technologies, and IT management.

Nizhny Novgorod has also been chosen as one of four sites for building an IT-oriented technology park – a special zone that has an established infrastructure and enjoys a favourable tax and customs policy.

===Engineering industry===

Engineering is the leading industry of Nizhny Novgorod&#x27;s economy with transportation – the auto industry, shipbuilding, diesel engines, aircraft manufacture, and machine tools – predominating; the auto industry being the leading sector (50%).

Some of the largest plants include:

Passengers can continue from Nizhny Novgorod eastward along the Trans-Siberian Railway, with direct trains to major cities in the Urals and Siberia, as well as to Beijing, Pyongyang and Ulaanbaatar.

The first high-speed rail &quot;Sapsan&quot; train to Moscow (Kursky Rail Terminal) and Saint Petersburg (Moskovsky Rail Terminal) was launched on 30 July 2010. The route has been run using &quot;Strizh&quot; trains since 2015.

Suburban commuter trains (&quot;elektrichka&quot;) connect Nizhny Novgorod with Vladimir, Dzerzhinsk, Murom, Kirov, Arzamas, Zavolzhye, Balakhna, and others.

===Waterways===
Nizhny Novgorod is an important centre of Volga cargo and passenger shipping. During summer, cruise vessels operate between Nizhny Novgorod, Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Astrakhan. In 2006 a small number of Meteor-class hydrofoils resumed operations on the Volga river. In August 2019, river navigation within the region was resumed. The hydrofoil Valdai began to sail along the routes Nizhny Novgorod – Gorodets and Nizhny Novgorod – Makaryevo.

===Highway===
The city is served by the Russian highway M-7 (Moscow – Nizhny Novgorod – Kazan – Ufa), and is a hub of the regional highway network. Also through the city passes the federal highway P158 (Nizhny Novgorod – Saransk – Penza – Saratov).

===Intercity buses===
The system of Nizhny Novgorod&#x27;s bus terminals underwent significant changes in 2015, as the old main intercity bus terminal in Lyadov Square (just south of the city centre) closed, and a new bus terminal opened in Scherbinki, a few miles to the south. Currently, the city&#x27;s main bus terminals are the following:
* Kanavino Bus Station, near the Moscow Railway Station. Mostly serves directions west and northwest (e.g. toward Moscow)
* Scherbinki Bus Station, a few miles south of the city centre. Mostly serves directions east and south.
Out of the three bus terminals, only the Kanavino station is near a subway line; the other two are connected with the rest of the city by city buses.

===Aerial cableway===
In 2012, the cableway connecting Nizhny Novgorod and Bor was launched. The length of the cableway is . It has the largest unsupported span in Europe above the water surface, which is . The main purpose is to provide an alternative type of passenger transportation in addition to river taxis, electric trains and buses. The cable car has also become a popular tourist attraction, thanks to panoramic views from the cabins. 

Not far from Nizhegorodskaya station there are the Nizhny Novgorod Cathedral Mosque and Pechersky Ascension Monastery.

Around from the Borskaya station is the park of historical reconstruction of &quot;Pax Romana&quot;, which represents a collective image of a site of the Roman borderland at the turn of the 1st-2nd centuries AD, with a military camp and a small town that developed from the Marktant village at the camp. On 31 July 2014, there was an incident when lightning struck a metal support near the booth during a heavy thunderstorm, and the cable car was stopped with people in the cabins.

===Air travel===
Nizhny Novgorod is served by Strigino International Airport, which has direct flights to major Russian cities and the Middle East. The air base Sormovo was an important military airlift facility, and Pravdinsk air base was an interceptor aircraft base during the Cold War. S7 Airlines and Aeroflot fly to Moscow&#x27;s Domodedovo and Sheremetyevo Airports daily.

It is unknown when the first aerodrome in Nizhny Novgorod was built, but its location was north of where the “Moscow” cinema stands today. This aerodrome was named Nizhny Novgorod Airport. In 2011 HC Airports of Regions won their bid on the investment project into Nizhny Novgorod International Airport. In 2012, renovations were made in order to more efficiently exploit the existing facility while the new one is being built.

A new terminal was opened on 29 December 2015, able to handle around 300 passengers per hour. 

==Main sights==

Much of the central city is built in the Russian Revival and Stalin Empire styles. The dominating feature of the city skyline is the grand Kremlin (1500–1511), with its red-brick towers. After Bolshevik devastation, the only ancient edifice left within the Kremlin walls is the tent-like Archangel Cathedral (1624–1631), first built in stone in the 13th century.


There are more than 600 unique historic, architectural and cultural monuments in the city. There are about 200 municipal and regional art and cultural institutions within Nizhny Novgorod. Among these institutions, there are eight theatres, five concert halls, 97 libraries (with branches), 17 cinemas (including five for children), 25 institutions of children&#x27;s optional education, eight museums (16 including branches), and seven parks.

===The Fair===
The centre of the fair was the main building in the spirit of classicism and the side administrative buildings that formed the central square. To protect from floods, a high dam was built. On 4 November 2017, a new multimedia exhibition called “Russia is My History” was opened in the Main Fair Building. The main focus of the exhibition is the history of Nizhny Novgorod, starting from Finnic peoples. On the territory of the complex there are departments in which they tell about the foundation of the city, the struggle for independence in the Time of Troubles and the bombing of the city during the World War II.

===Bolshaya Pokrovskaya street===

The main street of Nizhny Novgorod, located in the city center. Most part of it is pedestrian. There are many architectural monuments and various street sculptures.

===Nizhny Novgorod art gallery===
The art gallery in Nizhny Novgorod is a large and important art gallery and museums of human history and culture.

===Houses of worship===

Other notable landmarks are the two great medieval abbeys. The Pechersky Ascension Monastery features the austere five-domed cathedral (1632) and two rare churches surmounted by tent roofs, dating from the 1640s. The Annunciation monastery, likewise surrounded by strong walls, has another five-domed cathedral (1649) and the Assumption church (1678). The only private house preserved from that epoch formerly belonged to the merchant Pushnikov.

There can be little doubt that the most original and delightful churches in the city were built by the Stroganovs in the nascent Baroque style. Of these, the Virgin&#x27;s Nativity Church (1719) graces one of the central streets, whereas the Church of Our Lady of Smolensk (1694–97) survives in the former village of Gordeyevka (now, part of the city&#x27;s Kanavinsky District), where the Stroganov palace once stood.

Other notable churches include:
* the Transfiguration Cathedral, also known as the Old Fair Cathedral, a huge domed edifice built at the site of the great fair to an Empire style design by Agustín de Betancourt and Auguste de Montferrand in 1822;
* the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, designed in the Russian Revival style and constructed between 1856 and 1880 at the Spit of Nizhny Novgorod (the confluence of the Oka and the Volga). It is the third-tallest Cathedral in Russia;

* the parish churches of the Holy Wives (1649) and of Saint Elijah (1656);
* the Assumption Church on St Elijah&#x27;s Hill (1672), with five green-tiled domes arranged unorthodoxly on the lofty cross-shaped barrel roof;
* the shrine of the Old Believers at the Bugrovskoe cemetery, erected in the 1910s to a critically acclaimed design by Vladimir Pokrovsky;
* the wooden chapel of the Intercession (1660), transported to Nizhny Novgorod from a rural area.

===Chkalov Stairs===
The Chkalov Staircase connects Minin and Pozharsky Square, the Upper Volga, and the Lower Volga embankments. It was built by the architects Alexander Yakovlev, Lev Rudnev, and Vladimir Munts. The staircase itself was constructed in the late 1940s by German prisoners of war forced to labour around Gorky. It is the longest staircase in Russia. The staircase starts from the monument to Chkalov, near St. George&#x27;s Tower of the Kremlin. It is built in the form of a figure of eight and consists of 560 steps if you count it on both sides. The number of steps from the bottom to the top is 442 on the right. In the intersections of the side slopes there are two observation platforms. At the bottom of the stairs is a monument to the Hero boat, which is located at the Lower Volga embankment.

<text>Accrington Stanley Football Club is a professional association football club based in Accrington, Lancashire, England, that compete in the , the fourth level of the English football league system. They have spent their complete history playing at the Crown Ground. The club is known as Accrington Stanley, Stanley or just Accrington. 

The club came to national prominence in 1989 due to the Milk Marketing Board&#x27;s popular television advert that featured the slogan &quot;Accrington Stanley, who are they?&quot;

The current club was formed in 1968, two years after the collapse of the original Accrington Stanley. The original club was founded in 1891 and played in the Football League from 1921 to 1962 after initially competing in the Lancashire Combination. The town&#x27;s original club, named simply Accrington, were founder members of the Football League in 1888, though folded just six years later. The current incarnation of the club entered the Lancashire Combination and moved on to the Cheshire County League after winning the Combination title in 1977–78. Stanley won Division Two of the Cheshire County League in 1980–81 and became founder members of the North West Counties League in 1982, before being placed in Division One of the Northern Premier League five years later. They were promoted to the Premier Division in 1990–91, though were relegated in 1999.

The early 21st century saw the club win three promotions over the course of seven seasons under the stewardship of John Coleman to gain a place in the Football League. They won three divisional titles in each of their three promotions: Northern Premier League Division One (1999–2000), Northern Premier League Premier Division (2002–03) and the Conference National (2005–06). This marked the return of Accrington to the professional league system after 44 years. They then spent 12 seasons mostly in the bottom half of the table in League Two, though did also lose two play-off semi-finals, before Coleman led them to promotion into League One as League Two champions in 2017–18.

==History==
===Re-formation (1968–2003)===
Accrington had been without a football team following the collapse of the original Accrington Stanley in 1966. The original team had been formed in 1891 and played in the Football League from 1921 to March 1962, but had spent its final four seasons in the Lancashire Combination. At a meeting at Bold Street Working Men&#x27;s Club in 1968 the revival was initiated, and in August 1970 the new club played at a new ground, the Crown Ground. Eric Whalley, a local businessman, took control of the club in 1995 and began the development of the club&#x27;s ground. After the club was relegated in 1999, Whalley appointed John Coleman as manager.

The club&#x27;s rise to the Football League is attributed in part to the windfall of hundreds of thousands of pounds reaped by the sell-on clause in the December 2001 transfer of former Stanley star Brett Ormerod to Southampton, which paid Blackpool over a million pounds for his contract. Stanley had taken £50,000 from Blackpool in 1997, with the agreement that Blackpool would pay Accrington a quarter of what it might have received if it in turn transferred Ormerod to another team. The 2002–03 championship of the Northern Premier League followed quickly on Accrington getting the cash.

===Conference years (2003–2006)===
In May 2003, the club was promoted for the first time in history to the Football Conference, following its win of the Northern Premier League. The club&#x27;s first-ever game in the league was away to another reformed club, Aldershot Town, on Sunday 10 August 2003. The game was shown live on Sky Sports and resulted in a 2–1 loss. The season was a success, with a final league position of 10th being achieved. The highlight of that first season in the 5th tier was a run to the FA Cup 3rd round, losing in a replay at League One side Colchester United.

In 2004, Accrington Stanley turned professional. The following 2004–05 season, Stanley yet again achieved a final position of 10th placed, with Stanley legend Paul Mullin amongst the top goal scorers yet again, adding another 20 to his tally.

Stanley&#x27;s stay in the Conference didn&#x27;t last long, with the club returning to the Football League at the end of the 2005–06 season. Finishing on 91 points, the club went on a 19-game unbeaten run stretching from October to March, leaving the club an easy passage to League Two. The likes of Paul Mullin, Rob Elliot and Gary Roberts led the club back to the league after 46 years away.

===Return to the Football League (2006–present)===

The club&#x27;s first Football League game took place on 5 August 2006 away to Chester City; it resulted in a 2–0 loss. The club was involved in a relegation battle throughout its first season in the fourth tier. A run of 5 wins in the last 9 games of the season led to a 20th-place finish and was enough to save the club from relegation in its first season back in the Football League.

Highlights of that first season back included the club&#x27;s first-ever Football League Cup match against former European Cup winners Nottingham Forest. The game resulted in a 1–0 win, leaving the club a 2nd-round away tie against then Premier League team Watford, eventually losing 6–5 on penalties after a 0–0 draw and extra-time. The club also took part in the Football League Trophy for the first time as a league club (after playing in the two previous seasons as one of 12 Conference sides, beating Bradford City away in September 2004) and, after defeating Carlisle United and Blackpool in the early rounds, were knocked out by Doncaster Rovers in the Area Quarter-finals.

The 2007–08 season produced more of the same, with the club involved in another relegation battle with strugglers Chester City, Wrexham and Mansfield Town. 5 wins in the final 12 games were enough to secure a 17th-place finish and another season in the 4th tier of English Football. However, the club failed to win a game in the FA Cup and League Cup, losing to Huddersfield Town and Leicester City respectively.

Performance during the 2008–09 season improved, with the club achieving a modest 16th-place finish in League Two. A run of 6 League wins in the last 12 games was a nice way to finish the season. This season saw the emergence of young prospect Bobby Grant, who finally fulfilled the early promise seen in previous seasons. The club again failed to make it past the early round of any of the domestic cups, losing in the first round to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the League Cup and Tranmere Rovers in both the FA Cup (albeit after a replay) and Football League Trophy.

The 2009–10 season was far better, with the club pushing for a play-off place at the turn of the year. A run of 9 wins in 10 League games saw the club with a chance of making the play-offs, only for this to fade in March/April. The emergence of the Michael Symes and Bobby Grant partnership was a key aspect and, following their achievements throughout the season, both moved on to bigger clubs. In terms of cup performance the club was superb, reaching the 2nd round of the League Cup losing only 2–1 to Queens Park Rangers, the quarter-finals of the Football League Trophy losing 2–0 to Leeds United, and the 4th round of the FA Cup losing 3–1 to Premier League team Fulham.

The club reached the Football League Two play-offs during the 2010–11 season, one of the most successful in its history. A run of 1 loss in 19 games, from February till May, saw the club finish in a best-ever 5th position, eventually losing to League Two newcomers Stevenage in the play-off semi-finals. The season saw the emergence of Jimmy Ryan as a star in the making, along with a number of others, including goalkeeper Alex Cisak and midfielder Sean McConville. In the domestic cups, Stanley reached the second round of the League Cup, losing 3–2 to Premier League team Newcastle United. The club actually won the first-round game of the Football League Trophy away to Tranmere Rovers, but was then forced to resign from the competition after fielding the ineligible Ray Putterill in the game. The club also reached the second round of the FA Cup, but lost to fellow League Two side Port Vale.

2011–12 was a season of transition for the club. The loss of no less than six of the playoff-chasing side of the previous season was a tough act to follow. Following a shaky start to the season the arrival of Bryan Hughes in October transformed the club&#x27;s fortunes. A run of 6 wins in 7 games over the Christmas period saw the club briefly enter the play-offs. However, following the sale of club captain Andrew Procter to Preston North End in the January 2012 transfer window, the third-longest serving management team of John Coleman and Jimmy Bell departed for Rochdale. Former Burnley and club favourite Paul Cook was brought in as manager, along with the promotion of Leam Richardson from caretaker manager to full-time assistant. Only 3 wins in the final 17 games of the season was a pretty poor finish the season. However, this meant the club achieved a solid mid-table finish in 14th position. In terms of the domestic cups Stanley exited both the League Cup and FA Cup at the 1st round stages, losing to Scunthorpe United and Notts County respectively. The club reached the second round of the Football League Trophy, after knocking out holders Carlisle United, but lost to Tranmere Rovers in the 2nd round after an eventual replay. This was following a serious head injury to young defender Thomas Bender in the initial tie.

==== Andy Holt&#x27;s stewardship (2015–present) ====
On 28 October 2015, the board of Accrington Stanley voted to approve local businessman Andy Holt&#x27;s takeover of the club. Holt, whose company What More UK sponsored, and still sponsor, Stanley&#x27;s Wham Stadium, attained a majority share of 75% in Accrington Stanley, in return for clearing the club&#x27;s £1.2m debt as well as providing the club with further funds of £600,000. Stanley&#x27;s chairman, Peter Marsden, remained as chairman whilst five new people joined the club&#x27;s board. At the time of the takeover, Stanley had been on the verge of folding due to crippling debts and its inability to fund day-to-day running costs, including wages and its suppliers. Due to its precarious financial situation, the club had been accepting sponsorship deals at a value lower than what should have been demanded.

Holt&#x27;s involvement with Stanley began in July 2015, when Holt attended Stanley&#x27;s pre-season friendly at home against local rivals Burnley, which they won 4–2. It was during this game that Holt got an insight into the dire state of Stanley, having discovered that the club&#x27;s bar was unable to serve spectators as a result of its failure to pay its suppliers. In his first season as owner of the club, the 2015–16 Football League Two season, the club narrowly missed out on promotion to League One on the final day of the season, having been held to a 0–0 draw with Stevenage. Stanley were then defeated in the semi-final of the League Two play-offs, losing 3–2 on aggregate to AFC Wimbledon, with Wimbledon going on to defeat Plymouth Argyle 2–0 in the play-off final. At the end of the season, Stanley lost several of its players who had helped spur them on a promotion push, such as Tom Davies, Ross Etheridge and Josh Windass, who had agreed contracts with clubs in a position to offer higher wages than Stanley had been able to. With Windass and Crooks being under-24, Stanley received £120,000 for the duo&#x27;s transfer to Rangers.

During the 2016–17 pre-season, Stanley made several improvements to the facilities on offer at the Crown Ground, including the replacement of vendors with its own in-house service. It was also during the 2016–17 pre-season that Stanley&#x27;s chairman, Marsden, stepped down after a decade at the helm of the club. Marsden was replaced by Holt in the position. In the following 2016–17 season, Stanley finished mid-table in 13th position, having struggled to replicate its promotion push from the season before. The club had, however, enjoyed a run to the fourth round of the FA Cup, with a 1–0 defeat away to Middlesbrough putting an end to their cup campaign.

At the end of the 2017–18 season, Stanley won the League Two, with their 2–0 win over Yeovil Town on 17 April 2018 sealing promotion. In their first season in League One finished the season in 14th place.

Stanley were relegated to League Two in 2022–23 after finishing second from bottom in League One. In March 2024, John Coleman was sacked as manager after nine and a half years in the role. John Doolan then took over finishing the season in 17th place.

== Name ==
The original town club, Accrington, was amongst the twelve founder members of the Football League in 1888, before resigning from the league after just five years. A team called Stanley Villa already existed at the time, named as such because they were based at the Stanley Working Men&#x27;s Club on Stanley Street in Accrington. With the demise of Accrington, Stanley Villa took the town name to become Accrington Stanley.

==Stadium==
Since leaving Peel Park, the club has played at the Crown Ground, currently known as the Wham Stadium as part of a three-year £200,000 sponsorship deal with What More UK Ltd.

Prior to Holt&#x27;s takeover of Stanley, the Crown Ground had a reputation for being one of the poorest grounds within the top four leagues of English football. However, Holt&#x27;s stewardship of the club lead to changes at the Crown Ground, with initial changes including improved match day facilities before the construction of a new Whinney Hill Stand, which was built and completed in late-2018.

The following season, Stanley invested around £300,000 in a new playing field, a move which saw new drainage and a levelled pitch installed to overcome the club&#x27;s issue with recurring flooding towards the Coppice End.

In January 2021, work begun on the construction of a new and improved Jack Barrett Stand, work which will see a new bar and hospitality area provided as part of the plans.

==Rivalries==
According to a survey conducted in August 2019, Stanley supporters consider traditional Lancashire clubs Rochdale, Morecambe and Bury to be their biggest rivals, with near neighbours Blackburn Rovers and Burnley following.

==Television advertisement==

In the 1980s, the club was mentioned in a British advert for milk, which briefly brought the club to the attention of the general public. The advertisement featured two boys in Liverpool replica shirts played by young actors Carl Rice and Kevin Spaine. It made reference to Accrington Stanley&#x27;s obscurity in comparison to Liverpool&#x27;s success at the time.
Boy 1: &quot;Milk! Urghh!&quot;
Boy 2: &quot;It&#x27;s what Ian Rush drinks.&quot;
Boy 1: &quot;Ian Rush?&quot;
Boy 2: &quot;Yeah. And he said if I didn&#x27;t drink lots of milk, when I grow up, I&#x27;ll only be good enough to play for Accrington Stanley.&quot;
Boy 1: &quot;Accrington Stanley, who are they?&quot;
Boy 2: &quot;Exactly.&quot;

In the former weekly football show, &quot;Soccer AM&quot;, the phrase &quot;Accrington Stanley, who are they?&quot; is said every time a fixture is read out that has the club in it, referring to the milk advert.

<text>David Eugene Tudor (January 20, 1926 – August 13, 1996) was an American pianist and composer of experimental music.

== Life and career ==
Tudor was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He studied piano with Irma Wolpe and composition with Stefan Wolpe and became known as one of the leading performers of avant garde piano music. He gave the first American performance of the &quot;Piano Sonata No. 2&quot; by Pierre Boulez in 1950, and a European tour in 1954 greatly enhanced his reputation. Karlheinz Stockhausen dedicated his &quot;Klavierstück VI&quot; (1955) to Tudor. Tudor also gave early performances of works by Morton Feldman, Earle Brown, Christian Wolff and La Monte Young.

The composer with whom Tudor is particularly associated is John Cage; he gave the premiere of Cage&#x27;s &quot;Music of Changes&quot;, &quot;Concert For Piano and Orchestra&quot; and the notorious &quot;4&#x27; 33&quot;&quot;. Cage said that many of his pieces were written either specifically for Tudor to perform or with him in mind, once stating &quot;what you had to do was to make a situation that would interest &quot;him&quot;. That was the role he played.&quot; The two worked closely together on many of Cage&#x27;s pieces, both works for piano and electronic pieces, including for the Smithsonian Folkways album: &quot;Indeterminacy: New Aspect of Form in Instrumental and Electronic Music (1959)&quot;. Tudor also performs on several recordings of Cage&#x27;s music, including the Mainstream record of &quot;Cartridge Music&quot;, the recording on Columbia Records of &quot;Variations II&quot;, and the two Everest records of &quot;Variations IV&quot;. Tudor selected the works to be performed for the 25th Anniversary Retrospective Concert of the music of John Cage (May 16, 1958), and performed in the premiere of the &quot;Concert For Piano and Orchestra&quot; given as the closing work for that concert. Moreover, Tudor received a Foundation for Contemporary Arts John Cage Award (1992).

After a stint teaching at Darmstadt from 1956 to 1961, Tudor began to wind up his activities as a pianist to concentrate on composing. He wrote mostly electronic works, many commissioned by Cage&#x27;s partner, choreographer Merce Cunningham. His homemade musical circuits are considered landmarks in live electronic music and electrical instrument building as a form of composition. One piece, &quot;Reunion&quot; (1968), written jointly with Lowell Cross features a chess game, where each move triggers a lighting effect or projection. At the premiere, the game was played between John Cage and Marcel Duchamp. &quot;Reunion&quot; is erroneously attributed to Cage in James Pritchett&#x27;s book &quot;The Music Of John Cage&quot;. &quot;Rain Forest&quot; is a sound installation created from constructed sculpture and everyday objects such as a metal barrel, a vintage computer disk, and plastic tubing which served as a musical accompaniment. (David Tudor and Composers Inside Electronics Inc.: Rain forest V (variation 1))

In 1969, Tudor set up India&#x27;s first electronic music studio at the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad.

Upon Cage&#x27;s death in 1992, Tudor took over as music director of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. Among many works created for the company, Tudor composed &quot;Soundings: Ocean Diary&quot; (1994), the electronic component of &quot;Ocean&quot;, which was conceived by John Cage and Merce Cunningham, with choreography by Merce Cunningham, orchestral music by Andrew Culver and design by Marsha Skinner.

Tudor died after a series of strokes in Tomkins Cove, New York at the age of 70.

== Piano realisations ==
From 1951 until the late 1960s, Tudor (mainly as pianist) regularly performed the indeterminate work of John Cage. Throughout this time, &quot;all of the music [Cage] composed&quot;, John Holzaepfel contends, &quot;was written with one person in mind&quot;, and this person was Tudor. The culmination of this period were works that required a significant imprint of Tudor in performance. &quot;Winter Music&quot; (1957), for example, comprises a score of twenty pages, that each contain from one to 61 cluster-chords per page, with the performer deciding which of these to play. In his realisations of these scores, Tudor &quot;pin[ned] them down like butterflies&quot;, making the indeterminate determined, such that each performance of these works was consistent with the last. He chose to &#x27;fix&#x27; his interpretation, such that he never improvised from the score, and rather each performance of &quot;Winter Music&quot; by Tudor was consistent across time. As Martin Iddon explains: &quot;Tudor&#x27;s practice was, broadly, to create a single realisation and then to use that version of the piece in all subsequent recordings&quot;.

Despite the significant role Tudor had in the creative act, &quot;during his years as a pianist, Tudor never considered himself as a composer, or even a co-composer, of the music he played&quot;.

However, Benjamin Piekut argues differently, drawing from the work of Bruno Latour. These fixed realisations are examples of &#x27;distributed authorship&#x27; where &quot;the conception, meaning and sound-world of a given composition is shared across multiple subjectivities&quot;. The conception and meaning of the work for Cage is always created with Tudor in mind, and thus shared across the subjectivities of these two actors. Similarly, the output &#x27;sound-world&#x27; is shared in that Tudor&#x27;s function in realising the score is decision making based on Cage&#x27;s stimuli (score), and Cage&#x27;s stimuli does not present a coherent sound-world on its own. Piekut goes on to align this creative-distribution with Cage&#x27;s Buddhist anti-ego worldview.

<doc id="65433" wikidata="Q1507" url="?curid=65433" title="Patagonia">
<text>Patagonia () is a geographical region that includes parts of Argentina and Chile at the southern end of South America. The region includes the southern section of the Andes mountain chain with lakes, fjords, temperate rainforests, and glaciers in the west and deserts, tablelands, and steppes to the east. Patagonia is bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the west, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and many bodies of water that connect them, such as the Strait of Magellan, the Beagle Channel, and the Drake Passage to the south.

The northern limit of the region is not precisely defined; the Colorado and Barrancas rivers, which run from the Andes to the Atlantic, are commonly considered the northern limit of Argentine Patagonia. The archipelago of Tierra del Fuego is sometimes considered part of Patagonia. Most geographers and historians locate the northern limit of Chilean Patagonia at Huincul Fault, in Araucanía Region.

When Spanish explorers first arrived, Patagonia was inhabited by several indigenous tribes. In a small portion of northwestern Patagonia, indigenous peoples practiced agriculture, while in the remaining territory, peoples lived as hunter-gatherers, moving by foot in eastern Patagonia and by dugout canoe and dalca in the fjords and channels. In colonial times indigenous peoples of northeastern Patagonia adopted a horseriding lifestyle. Despite laying claim, early exploration, and a few small coastal settlements, the Spanish Empire had been chiefly interested in keeping other European powers out of Patagonia, given the threat they would have posed to Spanish South America. After their independence from Spain, Chile and Argentina claimed the territories to their south and began to colonize their respective claims over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries. This process brought a great decline of the indigenous populations, whose lives and habitats were disrupted by the arrival of thousands of immigrants from Argentina, the Chiloé Archipelago, mainland Chile, and Europe. This caused war but the fierce indigenous resistance was crushed by a series of Argentine and Chiliean mililtary campaigns.

The contemporary economy of Argentine Patagonia revolves around sheep farming and oil and gas extraction, while in Chilean Patagonia fishing, salmon aquaculture, and tourism dominate.

==Etymology and toponomies==
The name Patagonia comes from the word &quot;patagón&quot;. Magellan used this term in 1520 to describe the native tribes of the region, whom his expedition thought to be giants. The people he called the Patagons are now believed to have been the Tehuelche, who tended to be taller than Europeans of the time. Argentine researcher Miguel Doura observed that the name Patagonia possibly derives from the ancient Greek region of modern Turkey called Paphlagonia, possible home of the &quot;patagon&quot; personage in the chivalric romances &quot;Primaleon&quot; printed in 1512, ten years before Magellan arrived in these southern lands. This hypothesis was published in a 2011 &quot;New Review of Spanish Philology&quot; report.

There are various placenames in the Chiloé Archipelago with Chono etymologies despite the main indigenous language of the archipelago at the arrival of the Spanish being Mapudungun. A theory postulated by chronicler José Pérez García explains this holding that the Cuncos (also known as Veliches) settled in Chiloé Island in Pre-Hispanic times as a consequence of a push from more northern Huilliches who in turn were being displaced by Mapuches. While being outside traditional Huilliche territory the western Patagonian volcanoes Michimahuida, Hornopirén and Chaitén have Huilliche etymologies.

In Chubut Province modern toponymy comes from the word &quot;chupat&quot; belonging to a transitional language between the southern and northern Tehuelche ethnic groups that were located in that region called Tewsün or Teushen. The word means transparency and is related to the clarity and purity of the river that bears that name and runs through the province. It is also related to the origin of the Welsh pronunciation of the word &quot;chupat&quot; which later became &quot;Chubut&quot;. It is called &quot;Camwy&quot; in Patagonian Welsh. Chupat, Chubut and Camwy have the same meaning and are used to talk about the river and the province. Welsh settlers and placenames are associated with one of the projects of the country of Wales, Project Hiraeth.

Due to the language, culture and location, many Patagonians do not consider themselves Latinos and proudly call themselves Patagonians instead. People from Y Wladfa, Laurie Island, the Atlantic Islands, Antarctica (including the Chilean town in Antarctica, &quot;The Stars Village&quot;, and the Argentine civilian settlement, &quot;Hope Base&quot;), other non-Latin speaking areas use this term as a patriotic and inclusive demonym. A Patagonian is a person that is part of the Patagonia region, language and culture. That person could be a citizen from Chilean Patagonia, Argentine Patagonia, or of native communities that existed before the land was divided by The Boundary Treaty of 1881.

Patagonia is divided between Western Patagonia (Chile) and Eastern Patagonia (Argentina) and several territories are still under dispute and claiming their rights. Mapuche people came from the Chilean Andes and voted to remain in different sides of Patagonia. Welsh settlers came from Wales and North America and voted to remain in Patagonia; when the treaty was signed, they voted for culture and administration to be apart from the country keeping the settlement, language, schools, traditions, regional dates, flag, anthems, and celebrations. Patagonians also live abroad in settlements like Saltcoats, Saskatchewan, Canada; New South Wales, Australia; South Africa; the Falkland Islands; and North America.

==Population and land area==
=== Largest cities ===
==Physical geography==
Argentine Patagonia is for the most part a region of steppe-like plains, rising in a succession of 13 abrupt about at a time, and covered with an enormous bed of shingle almost bare of vegetation. In the hollows of the plains are ponds or lakes of fresh and brackish water. Towards Chilean territory, the shingle gives way to porphyry, granite, and basalt lavas, and animal life becomes more abundant. Vegetation is more luxuriant, consisting principally of southern beech and conifers. The high rainfall against the western Andes (Wet Andes) and the low sea-surface temperatures offshore give rise to cold and humid air masses, contributing to the ice fields and glaciers, the largest ice fields in the Southern Hemisphere outside of Antarctica.

Among the depressions by which the plateau is intersected transversely, the principal ones are the Gualichu, south of the Río Negro, the Maquinchao and Valcheta (through which previously flowed the waters of Nahuel Huapi Lake, which now feed the Limay River), the Senguerr (spelled Senguer on most Argentine maps and within the corresponding region), and the Deseado River. Besides these transverse depressions (some of them marking lines of ancient interoceanic communication), others were occupied by either more or less extensive lakes, such as the Yagagtoo, Musters, and Colhue Huapi, and others situated to the south of Puerto Deseado in the center of the country.

Across much of Patagonia east of the Andes, volcanic eruptions have created formation of basaltic lava plateaus during the Cenozoic. The plateaus are of different ages with the older –of Neogene and Paleogene age– being located at higher elevations than Pleistocene and Holocene lava plateaus and outcrops.

Erosion, which is caused principally by the sudden melting and retreat of ice aided by tectonic changes, has scooped out a deep longitudinal depression, best in evidence where in contact with folded Cretaceous rocks, which are lifted up by the Cenozoic granite. It generally separates the plateau from the first lofty hills, whose ridges are generally called the pre-Cordillera. To the west of these, a similar longitudinal depression extends all along the foot of the snowy Andean Cordillera. This latter depression contains the richest, most fertile land of Patagonia. Lake basins along the Cordillera were also gradually excavated by ice streams, including Lake Argentino and Lake Fagnano, as well as coastal bays such as Bahía Inútil.

The establishment of dams near the Andes in Argentina in the 20th century has led to a sediment shortage along the Atlantic coast of Patagonia.

===Geology===
The geological limit of Patagonia has been proposed to be Huincul Fault, which forms a major discontinuity. The fault truncates various structures including the Pampean orogen found further north. The ages of base rocks change abruptly across the fault. Discrepancies have been mentioned among geologists on the origin of the Patagonian landmass. Víctor Ramos has proposed that the Patagonian landmass originated as an allochthonous terrane that separated from Antarctica and docked in South America 250 to 270 Mya in the Permian period. A 2014 study by R.J. Pankhurst and coworkers rejects any idea of a far-traveled Patagonia, claiming it is likely of parautochtonous (nearby) origin.

The Mesozoic and Cenozoic deposits have revealed a most interesting vertebrate fauna. This, together with the discovery of the perfect cranium of a turtle (chelonian) of the genus &quot;Niolamia&quot;, which is almost identical to &quot;Ninjemys oweni&quot; of the Pleistocene age in Queensland, forms an evident proof of the connection between the Australian and South American continents. The Patagonian &quot;Niolamia&quot; belongs to the Sarmienti Formation. Fossils of the mid-Cretaceous &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot;, which may be the largest of all dinosaurs, have been found in Patagonia, and a model of the mid-Jurassic &quot;Piatnitzkysaurus&quot; graces the concourse of the Trelew airport (the skeleton is in the Trelew paleontological museum; the museum&#x27;s staff has also announced the discovery of a species of dinosaur even bigger than &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot;). Of more than paleontological interest, the middle Jurassic Los Molles Formation and the still richer late Jurassic (Tithonian) and early Cretaceous (Berriasian) Vaca Muerta formation above it in the Neuquén basin are reported to contain huge hydrocarbon reserves (mostly gas in Los Molles, both gas and oil in Vaca Muerta) partly accessible through hydraulic fracturing. Other specimens of the interesting fauna of Patagonia, belonging to the Middle Cenozoic, are the gigantic wingless birds, exceeding in size any hitherto known, and the singular mammal &quot;Pyrotherium&quot;, also of very large dimensions. In the Cenozoic marine formation, considerable numbers of cetaceans have been discovered.

During the Oligocene and early Miocene, large swathes of Patagonia were subject to a marine transgression, which might have temporarily linked the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, as inferred from the findings of marine invertebrate fossils of both Atlantic and Pacific affinity in La Cascada Formation. Connection would have occurred through narrow epicontinental seaways that formed channels in a dissected topography. The Antarctic Plate started to subduct beneath South America 14 million years ago in the Miocene, forming the Chile Triple Junction. At first, the Antarctic Plate subducted only in the southernmost tip of Patagonia, meaning that the Chile Triple Junction was located near the Strait of Magellan. As the southern part of the Nazca Plate and the Chile Rise became consumed by subduction, the more northerly regions of the Antarctic Plate began to subduct beneath Patagonia so that the Chile Triple Junction advanced to the north over time. The asthenospheric window associated to the triple junction disturbed previous patterns of mantle convection beneath Patagonia inducing an uplift of c. 1 km that reversed the Miocene transgression.

==Political divisions==
At a state level, Patagonia visually occupies an area within two countries: approximately 10% in Chile and approximately 90% in Argentina. Both countries have organized their Patagonian territories into nonequivalent administrative subdivisions: provinces and departments in Argentina, as well as regions, provinces, and communes in Chile. As Chile is a unitary state, its first-level administrative divisions—the regions—enjoy far less autonomy than analogous Argentine provinces. Argentine provinces have elected governors and legislatures, while Chilean regions had government-appointed intendants prior to the adoption of elected governors from 2021.

The Patagonian Provinces of Argentina are Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz, and Tierra del Fuego. The southernmost part of Buenos Aires Province can also be considered part of Patagonia.

The two Chilean regions undisputedly located entirely within Patagonia are Aysén and Magallanes. Palena Province, a part of the Los Lagos Region, is also located within Patagonia. By some definitions, Chiloé Archipelago, the rest of the Los Lagos Region, and part of the Los Ríos Region are also part of Patagonia.

==Climate==
Patagonia&#x27;s climate is mostly cool and dry year round. The east coast is warmer than the west, especially in summer, as a branch of the southern equatorial current reaches its shores, whereas the west coast is washed by a cold current. However, winters are colder on the inland plateaus east of the slopes and further down the coast on the southeast end of the Patagonian region. For example, at Puerto Montt, on the inlet behind Chiloé Island, the mean annual temperature is and the average extremes are , whereas at Bahía Blanca near the Atlantic coast and just outside the northern confines of Patagonia, the annual temperature is and the range much greater, as temperatures above 35°C and below −5°C are recorded every year. At Punta Arenas, in the extreme south, the mean temperature is and the average extremes are . The prevailing winds are westerly, and the westward slope has a much heavier precipitation than the eastern in a rainshadow effect; the western islands close to Torres del Paine receive an annual precipitation of 4,000 to 7,000 mm, while the eastern hills are less than 800 mm and the plains may be as low as 200 mm annual precipitation.

Precipitation is highly seasonal in northwestern Patagonia. For example, Villa La Angostura in Argentina, close to the border with Chile, receives up to 434 mm of rain and snow in May, 297 mm in June, and 273 in July, compared to 80 in February and 72 in March. The total for the city is 2074 mm, making it one of the rainiest in Argentina. Further west, some areas receive up to 4,000 mm and more, especially on the Chilean side. In the northeast, the seasons for rain are reversed; most rain falls from occasional summer thunderstorms but totals barely reach 500 mm in the northeast corner, and rapidly decrease to less than 300 mm. The Patagonian west coast, which belongs exclusively to Chile, has a cool oceanic climate, with summer maximum temperatures ranging from 14°C in the south to 19°C in the north (and nights between 5 and 11°C) and very high precipitation, from 2,000 to more than 7,000 mm in local microclimates. Snow is uncommon at the coast in the north but happens more often in the south, and frost is usually not very intense.

Immediately east from the coast are the Andes, cut by deep fjords in the south and by deep lakes in the north, and with varying temperatures according to the altitude. The tree line ranges from close to 2,000 m on the northern side (except for the Andes in northern Neuquén in Argentina, where sunnier and dryer conditions allow trees to grow up to close to 3,000 m), and diminishes southward to only 600–800m in Tierra del Fuego. Precipitation changes dramatically from one spot to the other and diminishes very quickly eastward. An example of this is Laguna Frías, in Argentina, which receives 4,400 mm yearly. The city of Bariloche, about 40 km further east, receives about 1,000 mm, and the airport, another 15 km east, receives less than 600 mm. The easterly slopes of the Andes are home to several Argentine cities: San Martín de los Andes, Bariloche, El Bolsón, Esquel, and El Calafate. Temperatures there are milder in the summer (in the north, between 20 and 24°C, with cold nights between 4 and 9°C; in the south, summers are between 16 and 20°C, at night temperatures are similar to the north) and much colder in the winter, with frequent snowfall (although snow cover rarely lasts very long). Daytime highs range from 3 to 9°C in the north, and from 0 to 7°C in the south, whereas nights range from −5 to 2°C everywhere. Cold waves can bring much colder values; a temperature of −25°C has been recorded in Bariloche, and most places can often have temperatures between −12 and −15°C and highs staying around 0°C for a few days.
Directly east of these areas, the weather becomes much harsher; precipitation drops to between 150 and 300 mm, the mountains no longer protect the cities from the wind, and temperatures become more extreme. Maquinchao is a few hundred kilometers east of Bariloche, at the same altitude on a plateau, and summer daytime temperatures are usually about 5°C warmer, rising up to 35°C sometimes, but winter temperatures are much more extreme: the record is −35°C, and some nights not uncommonly reach 10°C colder than Bariloche. The plateaus in Santa Cruz province and parts of Chubut usually have snow cover through the winter, and often experience very cold temperatures. In Chile, the city of Balmaceda is known for being situated in this region (which is otherwise almost exclusively in Argentina), and for being the coldest place in Chile. In 2017, temperatures even dropped down to −20°C in the region.

The northern Atlantic coast has warm summers (28 to 32°C, but with relatively cool nights at 15°C) and mild winters, with highs around 12°C and lows about 2–3°C. Occasionally, temperatures reach −10 or 40°C, and rainfall is very scarce. The weather only gets a bit colder further south in Chubut, and the city of Comodoro Rivadavia has summer temperatures of 24 to 28°C, nights of 12 to 16°C, and winters with days around 10°C and nights around 3°C, and less than 250 mm of rain. However, a drastic drop occurs as one moves south to Santa Cruz; Rio Gallegos, in the south of the province, has summer temps of 17 to 21°C, (nights between 6 and 10°C) and winter temperatures of 2 to 6°C, with nights between −5 and 0°C, despite being right on the coast. Snowfall is common despite the dryness, and temperatures are known to fall to under −18°C and to remain below freezing for several days in a row. Rio Gallegos is also among the windiest places on Earth, with winds reaching 100 km/h occasionally.

Tierra del Fuego is extremely wet in the west, relatively damp in the south, and dry in the north and east. Summers are cool (13 to 18°C in the north, 12 to 16°C in the south, with nights generally between 3 and 8°C), cloudy in the south, and very windy. Winters are dark and cold, but without the extreme temperatures in the south and west (Ushuaia rarely reaches −10°C, but hovers around 0°C for several months, and snow can be heavy). In the east and north, winters are much more severe, with cold snaps bringing temperatures down to −20°C all the way to the Rio Grande on the Atlantic coast. Snow can fall even in the summer in most areas, as well.

==Fauna==
The guanaco (&quot;Lama guanicoe&quot;), South American cougar (&quot;Puma concolor concolor&quot;), the Patagonian fox (&quot;Lycalopex griseus&quot;), Patagonian hog-nosed skunk (&quot;Conepatus humboldtii&quot;), and Magellanic tuco-tuco (&quot;Ctenomys magellanicus&quot;; a subterranean rodent) are the most characteristic mammals of the Patagonian plains. The Patagonian steppe is one of the last strongholds of the guanaco and Darwin&#x27;s rheas (&quot;Rhea pennata&quot;), which had been hunted for their skins by the Tehuelches, on foot using boleadoras, before the diffusion of firearms and horses; they were formerly the chief means of subsistence for the natives, who hunted them on horseback with dogs and bolas. Vizcachas (&quot;Lagidum&quot; spp.) and the Patagonian mara (&quot;Dolichotis patagonum&quot;) are also characteristic of the steppe and the pampas to the north.

The fauna of Patagonia was heavily decimated by the end-Pleistocene extinction event around 12–10,000 years ago that resulted in the extinction of most large (megafaunal) animal species native to the region (as well as across the Americas). Species formerly present in the region include the large cow-sized ground sloth &quot;Mylodon&quot;, the large camel-like ungulate &quot;Macrauchenia,&quot; indigenous equines belonging to the genus &quot;Hippidion,&quot; the giant short-faced bear &quot;Arctotherium,&quot; and the large sabertooth cat &quot;Smilodon&quot;. The extinct fox &quot;Dusicyon avus&quot; (a close relative of the Falkland Islands wolf) also formerly inhabited the region, until apparently becoming extinct around 500–400 years ago. Patagonia was inhabited by the jaguar subspecies &quot;Panthera onca mesembrina&quot;, considerably larger than today&#x27;s jaguars, during the Pleistocene, with jaguars continuing to inhabit Patagonia until the late 19th century, but now extirpated from the region.

Bird life is often abundant. The crested caracara (&quot;Caracara plancus&quot;) is one of the characteristic aspects of a Patagonian landscape; the presence of austral parakeets (&quot;Enicognathus ferrugineus&quot;) as far south as the shores of the strait attracted the attention of the earlier navigators, and green-backed firecrowns (&quot;Sephanoides sephaniodes&quot;), a species of hummingbird, may be seen flying amid the snowfall. One of the largest birds in the world, the Andean condor (&quot;Vultur gryphus&quot;) can be seen in Patagonia. Of the many kinds of waterfowl the Chilean flamingo (&quot;Phoenicopterus chilensis&quot;), the upland goose (&quot;Chloephaga picta&quot;), and in the strait, the remarkable steamer ducks are found.

Signature marine fauna include the southern right whale, the Magellanic penguin (&quot;Spheniscus magellanicus&quot;), the killer whale, and elephant seals. The Valdés Peninsula is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, designated for its global significance as a site for the conservation of marine mammals.

The Patagonian freshwater fish fauna is relatively restricted compared to other similar Southern Hemisphere regions. The Argentine part is home to a total of 29 freshwater fish species, 18 of which are native. The introduced are several species of trout, common carp, and various species that originated in more northerly parts of South America. The natives are osmeriforms (&quot;Aplochiton&quot; and &quot;Galaxias&quot;), temperate perches (&quot;Percichthys&quot;), catfish (&quot;Diplomystes&quot;, &quot;Hatcheria&quot; and &quot;Trichomycterus&quot;), Neotropical silversides (&quot;Odontesthes&quot;) and characiforms (&quot;Astyanax&quot;, &quot;Cheirodon&quot;, &quot;Gymnocharacinus&quot;, and &quot;Oligosarcus&quot;). Other Patagonian freshwater fauna include the highly unusual aeglid crustaceans.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian Patagonia (10,000 BC – AD 1520)===

Human habitation of the region dates back thousands of years, with some early archaeological findings in the area dated to at least the 13th millennium BC, although later dates around the 10th millennium BC are more securely recognized. Evidence exists of human activity at Monte Verde in Llanquihue Province, Chile, dated to around 14,500 years Before Present (~12,500 BC). The glacial-period ice fields and subsequent large meltwater streams would have made settlement difficult at that time.

The region seems to have been inhabited continuously since 10,000 BC by various cultures and alternating waves of migration, the details of which are as yet poorly understood. Several sites have been excavated, notably caves such as Cueva del Milodon in Última Esperanza in southern Patagonia, and Tres Arroyos on Tierra del Fuego, that support this date. Hearths, stone scrapers, and animal remains dated to 9400–9200 BC have been found east of the Andes.

At the close of the Pleistocene around 12–11,000 years ago (10,000-9,000 BC) Fishtail projectile points (a type of knapped stone spear point) were widespread across Patagonia (along with much of the rest of South America). At several sites these points have been found associated with extinct megafauna, including the large ground sloth &quot;Mylodon&quot; and the native equine &quot;Hippidion&quot;.

The Cueva de las Manos is a famous site in Santa Cruz, Argentina. This cave at the foot of a cliff is covered in wall paintings, particularly the negative images of hundreds of hands, believed to date from around 8000 BC.

Based on artifacts found in the region, apparently hunting of guanaco, and to a lesser extent rhea (&quot;ñandú&quot;), were the primary food sources of tribes living on the eastern plains. It is also not clear if domestic dogs were part of early human activity. &quot;Bolas&quot; are commonly found and were used to catch guanaco and rhea. A maritime tradition existed along the Pacific coast, whose latest exponents were the Yaghan (Yámana) to the south of Tierra del Fuego, the Kaweshqar between Taitao Peninsula and Tierra del Fuego, and the Chono people in the Chonos Archipelago. The Selk&#x27;nam, Haush, and Tehuelche are generally thought to be culturally and linguistically related peoples physically distinct from the sea-faring peoples.

It is possible that Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego was connected to the mainland in the Early Holocene (c. 9000 years BP) much in the same way that Riesco Island was back then. A Selk&#x27;nam tradition recorded by the Salesian missionary Giuseppe María Beauvoir relate that the Selk&#x27;nam arrived in Tierra del Fuego by land, and that the Selk&#x27;nam were later unable to return north as the sea had flooded their crossing.

Agriculture was practised in Pre-Hispanic Argentina as far south as southern Mendoza Province. Agriculture was at times practised beyond this limit in nearby areas of Patagonia but populations reverted at times to non-agricultural lifestyles. By the time of the Spanish arrival to the area (1550s) there is no record of agriculture being practised in northern Patagonia. The extensive Patagonian grasslands and an associated abundance of guanaco game may have contributed for the indigenous populations to favour a hunter-gathered lifestyle.

The indigenous peoples of the region included the Tehuelches, whose numbers and society were reduced to near extinction not long after the first contacts with Europeans. Tehuelches included the Gununa&#x27;kena to the north, Mecharnuekenk in south-central Patagonia, and the Aonikenk or Southern Tehuelche in the far south, north of the Magellan strait. On Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, the Selk&#x27;nam (Ona) and Haush (Manek&#x27;enk) lived in the north and southeast, respectively. In the archipelagos to the south of Tierra del Fuego were Yámana, with the Kawéskar (Alakaluf) in the coastal areas and islands in western Tierra del Fuego and the southwest of the mainland. In the Patagonian archipelagoes north of Taitao Peninsula lived the Chonos. These groups were encountered in the first periods of European contact with different lifestyles, body decoration, and language, although it is unclear when this configuration emerged.

Towards the end of the 16th century, Mapuche-speaking agriculturalists penetrated the western Andes and from there across into the eastern plains and down to the far south. Through confrontation and technological ability, they came to dominate the other peoples of the region in a short period of time, and are the principal indigenous community today.

===Early European exploration (1520–1669)===
Navigators such as Gonçalo Coelho and Amerigo Vespucci possibly had reached the area (his own account of 1502 has it that they reached the latitude 52°S), but Vespucci&#x27;s failure to accurately describe the main geographical features of the region such as the Río de la Plata casts doubts on whether they really did so.

The first or more detailed description of part of the coastline of Patagonia is possibly mentioned in a Portuguese voyage in 1511–1512, traditionally attributed to captain Diogo Ribeiro, who after his death was replaced by Estevão de Frois, and was guided by the pilot and cosmographer João de Lisboa). The explorers, after reaching Rio de la Plata (which they would explore on the return voyage, contacting the Charrúa and other peoples) eventually reached San Matias Gulf, at 42°S. The expedition reported that after going south of the 40th parallel, they found a &quot;land&quot; or a &quot;point extending into the sea&quot;, and further south, a gulf. The expedition is said to have rounded the gulf for nearly and sighted the continent on the southern side of the gulf.

The Atlantic coast of Patagonia was first fully explored in 1520 by the Spanish expedition led by Ferdinand Magellan, who on his passage along the coast named many of its more striking features – San Matías Gulf, Cape of 11,000 Virgins (now simply Cape Virgenes), and others. Magellan&#x27;s fleet spent a difficult winter at what he named Puerto San Julián before resuming its voyage further south on 21 August 1520. During this time, it encountered the local inhabitants, likely to be Tehuelche people, described by his reporter, Antonio Pigafetta, as giants called Patagons.

The territory became the Spanish colony of the Governorate of New Léon, granted in 1529 to Governor , part of the Governorates of the Spanish Empire of the Americas. The territory was redefined in 1534 and consisted of the southernmost part of the South American continent and the islands towards Antarctica.

Rodrigo de Isla, sent inland in 1535 from San Matías by Simón de Alcazaba y Sotomayor (on whom western Patagonia had been conferred by Charles I of Spain, is presumed to have been the first European to have traversed the great Patagonian plain. If the men under his charge had not mutinied, he might have crossed the Andes to reach the Pacific coast.

Pedro de Mendoza, on whom the country was next bestowed, founded Buenos Aires, but did not venture south. (1539), Juan Ladrilleros (1557), and Hurtado de Mendoza (1558) helped to make known the Pacific coasts, and while Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s voyage in 1577 down the Atlantic coast, through the Strait of Magellan and northward along the Pacific coast, was memorable, yet the descriptions of the geography of Patagonia owe much more to the Spanish explorer Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa (1579–1580), who, devoting himself especially to the south-west region, made careful and accurate surveys. The settlements that he founded at Nombre de Jesús and San Felipe was neglected by the Spanish government, the latter being abandoned before Thomas Cavendish visited it in 1587 during his circumnavigation, and so desolate that he called it Port Famine. After the discovery of the route around Cape Horn, the Spanish Crown lost interest in southern Patagonia until the 18th century, when the coastal settlements Carmen de Patagones, San José, Puerto Deseado, and Nueva Colonia Floridablanca were established, although it maintained its claim of a &quot;de jure&quot; sovereignty over the area.

In 1669, the district around Puerto Deseado was explored by John Davis and was claimed in 1670 by Sir John Narborough for King Charles II of England, but the English made no attempt to establish settlements or explore the interior.

====Patagonian giants: early European perceptions====

The first European explorers of Patagonia observed that the indigenous people in the region were taller than the average Europeans of the time, prompting some of them to believe that Patagonians were giants.

According to Antonio Pigafetta, one of the Magellan expedition&#x27;s few survivors and its published chronicler, Magellan bestowed the name &quot;Patagão&quot; (or &quot;Patagón&quot;) on the inhabitants they encountered there, and the name &quot;Patagonia&quot; for the region. Although Pigafetta&#x27;s account does not describe how this name came about, subsequent popular interpretations gave credence to a derivation meaning &quot;land of the big feet&quot;. However, this etymology is questionable. The term is most likely derived from an actual character name, &quot;Patagón&quot;, a savage creature confronted by Primaleón of Greece, the hero in the homonymous Spanish chivalry novel (or knight-errantry tale) by Francisco Vázquez. This book, published in 1512, was the sequel of the romance &quot;Palmerín de Oliva&quot;;it was much in vogue at the time, and a favorite reading of Magellan. Magellan&#x27;s perception of the natives, dressed in skins, and eating raw meat, clearly recalled the uncivilized Patagón in Vázquez&#x27;s book. Novelist and travel writer Bruce Chatwin suggests etymological roots of both Patagon and Patagonia in his book, &quot;In Patagonia&quot;, noting the similarity between &quot;Patagon&quot; and the Greek word παταγος, which means &quot;a roaring&quot; or &quot;gnashing of teeth&quot; (in his chronicle, Pigafetta describes the Patagonians as &quot;roaring like bulls&quot;).
The main interest in the region sparked by Pigafetta&#x27;s account came from his reports of their meeting with the local inhabitants, whom they claimed to measure some 9 to 12 feet in height – &quot;so tall that we reached only to his waist&quot; – hence the later idea that Patagonia meant &quot;big feet&quot;. This supposed race of Patagonian giants or Patagones entered into the common European perception of this then little-known and distant area, to be further fueled by subsequent reports of other expeditions and famous travelers such as Sir Francis Drake, which seemed to confirm these accounts. Early charts of the New World sometimes added the legend &quot;regio gigantum&quot; (&quot;region of the giants&quot;) to the Patagonian area. By 1611, the Patagonian god Setebos (Settaboth in Pigafetta) was familiar to the hearers of &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

The concept and general belief persisted for a further 250 years and was to be sensationally reignited in 1767 when an &quot;official&quot; (but anonymous) account was published of Commodore John Byron&#x27;s recent voyage of global circumnavigation in HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot;. Byron and crew had spent some time along the coast, and the publication (&quot;Voyage Round the World in His Majesty&#x27;s Ship the Dolphin&quot;) seemed to give proof positive of their existence; the publication became an overnight bestseller, thousands of extra copies were to be sold to a willing public, and other prior accounts of the region were hastily republished (even those in which giant-like folk were not mentioned at all).

However, the Patagonian giant frenzy died down substantially only a few years later, when some more sober and analytical accounts were published. In 1773, John Hawkesworth published on behalf of the Admiralty a compendium of noted English southern-hemisphere explorers&#x27; journals, including that of James Cook and John Byron. In this publication, drawn from their official logs, the people Byron&#x27;s expedition had encountered clearly were no taller than , very tall but by no means giants. Interest soon subsided, although awareness of and belief in the concept persisted in some quarters even into the 20th century.

===Spanish outposts===
The Spanish failure at colonizing the Strait of Magellan made Chiloé Archipelago assume the role of protecting the area of western Patagonia from foreign intrusions. Valdivia, reestablished in 1645, and Chiloé acted as sentries, being hubs where the Spanish collected information and rumors from all over Patagonia.

As a result of the corsair and pirate menace, Spanish authorities ordered the depopulation of the Guaitecas Archipelago to deprive enemies of any eventual support from native populations. This then led to the transfer of the majority of the indigenous Chono population to the Chiloé Archipelago in the north while some Chonos moved south of Taitao Peninsula effectively depopulating the territory in the 18th century.

The publication of Thomas Falkner&#x27;s book &quot;A Description of Patagonia and the Adjacent Parts of South America&quot; in England fuelled speculations in Spain about renewed British interest in Patagonia. In response an order from the King of Spain was issued to settle the eastern coast of Patagonia. This led to the brief existence of colonies at the Gulf of San Jorge (1778–1779) and San Julián (1780–1783) and the more longlasting colony of Carmen de Patagones.

===Scientific exploration (1764–1842)===
In the second half of the 18th century, European knowledge of Patagonia was further augmented by the voyages of the previously mentioned John Byron (1764–1765), Samuel Wallis (1766, in the same HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot; which Byron had earlier sailed in) and Louis Antoine de Bougainville (1766). Thomas Falkner, a Jesuit who resided near forty years in those parts, published his &quot;Description of Patagonia&quot; (Hereford, 1774); Francisco Viedma founded &quot;El Carmen&quot;, nowadays Carmen de Patagones and Antonio settled the area of San Julian Bay, where he founded the colony of Floridablanca and advanced inland to the Andes (1782). Basilio Villarino ascended the Rio Negro (1782).
Two hydrographic surveys of the coasts were of first-rate importance; the first expedition (1826–1830) included HMS &quot;Adventure&quot; and HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; under Phillip Parker King, and the second (1832–1836) was the voyage of the &quot;Beagle&quot; under Robert FitzRoy. The latter expedition is particularly noted for the participation of Charles Darwin, who spent considerable time investigating various areas of Patagonia onshore, including long rides with gauchos in Río Negro, and who joined FitzRoy in a expedition taking ships&#x27; boats up the course of the Santa Cruz River.

===Spanish American independence wars===
During the independence wars, rumours about the imminent arrival of Spanish troops to Patagonia, either from Peru or Chiloé, were common among indigenous peoples of the Pampas and northern Patagonia. In 1820 Chilean patriot leader José Miguel Carrera allied with the indigenous Ranquel people of the Pampas to fight the rival patriots in Buenos Aires. José Miguel Carrera ultimately planned to cross the Andes into Chile and oust his rivals in Chile.

The last royalist armed group in what is today Argentina and Chile, the Pincheira brothers, moved from the vicinities of Chillán across the Andes into northern Patagonia as patriots consolidated control of Chile. The Pincheira brothers was an outlaw gang made of Europeans Spanish, American Spanish, Mestizos and local indigenous peoples. This group was able to move to Patagonia thanks to its alliance with two indigenous tribes, the Ranqueles and the Boroanos. In the interior of Patagonia, far from the de facto territory of Chile and the United Provinces, the Pincheira brothers established permanent encampment with thousands of settlers. From their bases the Pincheiras led numerous raids into the countryside of the newly established republics.

===Chilean and Argentine colonization (1843–1902)===
In the early 19th century, the araucanization of the natives of northern Patagonia intensified, and many Mapuches migrated to Patagonia to live as nomads that raised cattle or pillaged the Argentine countryside. The cattle stolen in the incursions (&quot;malones&quot;) were later taken to Chile through the mountain passes and traded for goods, especially alcoholic beverages. The main trail for this trade was called Camino de los chilenos and runs a length around 1000 km from the Buenos Aires Province to the mountain passes of Neuquén Province. The &quot;lonco&quot; Calfucurá crossed the Andes from Chile to the pampas around 1830, after a call from the governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas, to fight the Boroano people. In 1859, he attacked Bahía Blanca in Argentina with 3,000 warriors. As in the case of Calfucura, many other bands of Mapuches got involved in the internal conflicts of Argentina until Conquest of the Desert. To counter the cattle raids, a trench called the Zanja de Alsina was built by Argentina in the pampas in the 1870s.

In the mid-19th century, the newly independent nations of Argentina and Chile began an aggressive phase of expansion into the south, increasing confrontation with the Indigenous peoples of the region. In 1860, French adventurer Orelie-Antoine de Tounens proclaimed himself king of the Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia of the Mapuche.

Following the last instructions of Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins, the Chilean president Manuel Bulnes sent an expedition to the Strait of Magellan and founded Fuerte Bulnes in 1843. Five years later, the Chilean government moved the main settlement to the current location of Punta Arenas, the oldest permanent settlement in Southern Patagonia. The creation of Punta Arenas was instrumental in making Chile&#x27;s claim of the Strait of Magellan permanent. In the 1860s, sheep from the Falkland Islands were introduced to the lands around the Straits of Magellan, and throughout the 19th century, sheepfarming grew to be the most important economic sector in southern Patagonia.

George Chaworth Musters in 1869 wandered in company with a band of Tehuelches through the whole length of the country from the strait to the Manzaneros in the northwest, and collected a great deal of information about the people and their mode of life.

====Conquest of the Desert and the 1881 treaty====

Argentine authorities worried that the strong connections araucanized tribes had with Chile would allegedly give Chile certain influence over the pampas. Argentine authorities feared that in an eventual war with Chile over Patagonia, the natives would side with the Chileans and the war would be brought to the vicinity of Buenos Aires.

The decision to plan and execute the Conquest of the Desert was probably catalyzed by the 1872 attack of Cufulcurá and his 6,000 followers on the cities of General Alvear, Veinticinco de Mayo, and Nueve de Julio, where 300 &quot;criollos&quot; were killed, and 200,000 heads of cattle taken. In the 1870s, the Conquest of the Desert was a controversial campaign by the Argentine government, executed mainly by General Julio Argentino Roca, to subdue or, some claim, to exterminate the native peoples of the south.

In 1885, a mining expeditionary party under the Romanian adventurer Julius Popper landed in southern Patagonia in search of gold, which they found after traveling southwards towards the lands of Tierra del Fuego. This led to the further opening up of the area to prospectors. European missionaries and settlers arrived throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, notably the Welsh settlement of the Chubut Valley. Numerous Croatians also settled in Patagonia.

During the first years of the 20th century, the border between the two nations in Patagonia was established by the mediation of the British crown. Numerous modifications have been made since then, the last conflict having been resolved in 1994 by an arbitration tribunal constituted in Rio de Janeiro. It granted Argentina sovereignty over the Southern Patagonia Icefield, Cerro Fitz Roy, and Laguna del Desierto.

Until 1902, a large proportion of Patagonia&#x27;s population were natives of Chiloé Archipelago (Chilotes), who worked as peons in large livestock-farming &quot;estancias&quot;. Because they were manual laborers, their social status was below that of the &quot;gauchos&quot; and the Argentine, Chilean, and European landowners and administrators.

Before and after 1902, when the boundaries were drawn, Argentina expelled many Chilotes from their territory, as they feared that having a large Chilean population in Argentina could pose a risk to their future control. These workers founded the first inland Chilean settlement in what is now the Aysén Region; Balmaceda. Lacking good grasslands on the forest-covered Chilean side, the immigrants burned down the forest, setting fires that could last more than two years.

==Economy==
The area&#x27;s principal economic activities have been mining, whaling, livestock (notably sheep throughout) agriculture (wheat and fruit production near the Andes towards the north), and oil after its discovery near Comodoro Rivadavia in 1907.

Energy production is also a crucial part of the local economy. Railways were planned to cover continental Argentine Patagonia to serve the oil, mining, agricultural, and energy industries, and a line was built connecting San Carlos de Bariloche to Buenos Aires. Portions of other lines were built to the south, but the only lines still in use are La Trochita in Esquel, the Train of the End of the World in Ushuaia, both heritage lines,
and a short run Tren Histórico de Bariloche to Perito Moreno.

In the western forest-covered Patagonian Andes and archipelagoes, wood logging has historically been an important part of the economy; it impelled the colonization of the areas of the Nahuel Huapi and Lácar lakes in Argentina and Guaitecas Archipelago in Chile.

===Livestock===


Sheep farming introduced in the late 19th century has been a principal economic activity. After reaching its heights during the First World War, the decline in world wool prices affected sheep farming in Argentina. Nowadays, about half of Argentina&#x27;s 15 million sheep are in Patagonia, a percentage that is growing as sheep farming disappears in the pampas to the north. Chubut (mainly Merino) is the top wool producer with Santa Cruz (Corriedale and some Merino) second. Sheep farming revived in 2002 with the devaluation of the peso and firmer global demand for wool (led by China and the EU). Still, little investment occurs in new abattoirs (mainly in Comodoro Rivadavia, Trelew, and Rio Gallegos), and often phytosanitary restrictions reduce the export of sheep meat. Extensive valleys in the Cordilleran Range have provided sufficient grazing lands, and the low humidity and weather of the southern region make raising Merino and Corriedale sheep common.

Livestock also includes small numbers of cattle, and in lesser numbers, pigs and horses. Sheep farming provides a small but important number of jobs for rural areas with little other employment.

===Tourism===
In the second half of the 20th century, tourism became an ever more important part of Patagonia&#x27;s economy. Originally a remote backpacking destination, the region has attracted increasing numbers of upmarket visitors, cruise passengers rounding Cape Horn or visiting Antarctica, and adventure and activity holiday-makers. Principal tourist attractions include the Perito Moreno glacier, the Valdés Peninsula, the Argentine Lake District and Ushuaia and Tierra del Fuego (the city is also a jumping-off place for travel to Antarctica, bringing in still more visitors). Tourism has created new markets locally and for export for traditional crafts such as Mapuche handicrafts, guanaco textiles, and confectionery and preserves.

A spin-off from increased tourism has been the buying of often enormous tracts of land by foreigners, often as a prestige purchase rather than for agriculture. Buyers have included Sylvester Stallone, Ted Turner, and Christopher Lambert, and most notably Luciano Benetton, Patagonia&#x27;s largest landowner. His &quot;Compañia de Tierras Sud&quot; has brought new techniques to the ailing sheep-rearing industry and sponsored museums and community facilities, but has been controversial particularly for its treatment of local Mapuche communities.

===Energy===


Due to its sparse rainfall in agricultural areas, Argentine Patagonia already has numerous dams for irrigation, some of which are also used for hydropower. The Limay River is used to generate hydroelectricity at five dams built on its course: Alicurá, Piedra del Águila, Pichi Picún Leufú, El Chocón, and Arroyito. Together with the Cerros Colorados Complex on the Neuquén River, they contribute more than one-quarter of the total hydroelectric generation in the country.

Patagonia has always been Argentina&#x27;s main area, and Chile&#x27;s only area, of conventional oil and gas production. Oil and gas have played an important role in the rise of Neuquén-Cipolleti as Patagonia&#x27;s most populous urban area, and in the growth of Comodoro Rivadavia, Punta Arenas, and Rio Grande, as well. The development of the Neuquén basin&#x27;s enormous unconventional oil and gas reserves through hydraulic fracturing has just begun, but the YPF-Chevron Loma Campana field in the Vaca Muerta formation is already the world&#x27;s largest producing shale oil field outside North America according to former YPF CEO Miguel Gallucio.

Patagonia&#x27;s notorious winds have already made the area Argentina&#x27;s main source of wind power, and plans have been made for major increases in wind power generation. Coal is mined in the Rio Turbio area and used for electricity generation.

==Cuisine==
Argentine Patagonian cuisine is largely the same as the cuisine of Buenos Aires – grilled meats and pasta – with extensive use of local ingredients and less use of those products that have to be imported into the region. Lamb is considered the traditional Patagonian meat, grilled for several hours over an open fire. Some guide books have reported that game meats, especially guanaco and introduced deer and boar, are popular in restaurant cuisine. However, since guanaco is a protected animal in both Chile and Argentina, it is unlikely to appear commonly as restaurant fare. Trout and &quot;centolla&quot; (king crab) are also common, though overfishing of &quot;centolla&quot; has made it increasingly scarce. In the area around Bariloche, a noted Alpine cuisine tradition remains, with chocolate bars and even fondue restaurants, and tea rooms are a feature of the Welsh communities in Gaiman and Trevelin, as well as in the mountains. Since the mid-1990s, some success with winemaking has occurred in Argentine Patagonia, especially in Neuquén.

==Foreign land buyers issue==
Foreign investors, including Italian multinational Benetton Group, media magnate Ted Turner, British billionaire Joe Lewis and the conservationist Douglas Tompkins, own major land areas. This situation has caused several conflicts with local inhabitants and the governments of Chile and Argentina, for example, the opposition by Douglas Tompkins to the planned route for Carretera Austral in Pumalín Park. A scandal is also brewing about two properties owned by Ted Turner: the &quot;estancia&quot; La Primavera, located inside Nahuel Huapi National Park, and the &quot;estancia&quot; Collón Cura. Benetton has faced criticism from Mapuche organizations, including Mapuche International Link, over its purchase of traditional Mapuche lands in Patagonia. The Curiñanco-Nahuelquir family was evicted from their land in 2002 following Benetton&#x27;s claim to it, but the land was restored in 2007.

==In literature==

In Jules Verne&#x27;s 1867–1868 novel (The Children of Captain Grant, alternatively &#x27;In Search of the Castaways&#x27;), the search for Captain Grant gets underway when the &quot;Duncan&quot;, a vessel in the ownership of Lord Glenarvan, is taken on a journey to the western shore of South America&#x27;s Patagonian region where the crew is split up, and Lord Glenarvan proceeds to lead a party eastwards across Patagonia to eventually reunite with the &quot;Duncan&quot; (which had doubled the Cape in the meanwhile).

The future history depicted in Olaf Stapledon&#x27;s 1930 novel &quot;Last and First Men&quot; includes a far future time in which Patagonia becomes the center of a new world civilization while Europe and North America are reduced to the status of backward poverty-stricken areas.

In William Goldman’s 1987 movie &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, Westley, the current inheritor of the moniker &quot;the Dread Pirate Roberts&quot;, states that the &quot;real&quot; (original) Dread Pirate Roberts is retired and &quot;living like a king in Patagonia&quot;.

In David Grann&#x27;s 2023 non-fiction book &quot;The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder&quot;, the surviving crew of HMS &quot;Wager&quot; are shipwrecked on the Chilean coast of Patagonia, estimating their position to be &quot;at around 47 degrees south and 81:40 degrees west&quot;.

In Madeleine l&#x27;Engle&#x27;s &quot;A Swiftly Tilting Planet&quot;, the fictional country Vespugia is &quot;set in the middle of what used to be called Patagonia, a sizeable area along what are now the boundaries of Chile and Argentina&quot;.

<doc id="65434" wikidata="Q723727" url="?curid=65434" title="Sin City">
<text>Sin City is a series of neo-noir comics by American comic book writer-artist Frank Miller. The first story originally appeared in &quot;Dark Horse Presents Fifth Anniversary Special&quot; (April 1991), and continued in &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; 51–62 from May 1991 to June 1992, under the title of &quot;Sin City&quot;, serialized in thirteen parts. Several other stories of variable lengths have followed. The intertwining stories, with frequently recurring characters, take place in Basin City.

A film adaptation of &quot;Sin City&quot;, co-directed by Robert Rodriguez and Miller, was released on April 1, 2005. A sequel, &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot;, was released on August 22, 2014.

==Publication history==
Writer-artist Frank Miller rose to fame within the American comics industry with his 1981–1983 work on Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Daredevil&quot;, and the 1986 DC Comics miniseries &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, both of which exhibited subtle elements of film noir. Miller&#x27;s venture into the film noir genre deepened with his creator-owned series &quot;Sin City&quot;, which began publishing in serialized form in the Dark Horse Comics anthology series &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; #51–62. The story was released in a trade paperback and later re-released in 1995 under the name &quot;Sin City: The Hard Goodbye&quot;.

In a 2016 interview with the Kubert School, Miller explained his inspiration for &quot;Sin City&quot; thus:

I&#x27;ve been a fanatic for a long time for old crime movies and old crime novels. But it started with the movies. And the old Cagney movies. Bogart and all that. I loved just how the morals of the stories are. They&#x27;re all about right and wrong. But in &quot;Sin City&quot; in particular I wanted them all to happen to in a world where virtuous behavior was rare, which greatly resembled the world I lived in. It&#x27;s kinda like the old Rolling Stones song, where every cop&#x27;s a criminal, and all the sinners are saints, where the lowlifes would often be heroic, and the most stridently beautiful and sweet women would be prostitutes. I wanted it to be a world out of balance, where virtue is defined by individuals in difficult situations, not by an overwhelming sense of goodness that was somehow governed by this godlike Comics Code.

The film noir influence on the series&#x27; artwork is seen in its use of shadow and stark backgrounds. Black and white are the sole colors most of the time, with exception of red, yellow, blue, and pink, of which limited use is made in some stories to draw attention to particular characters.

The writing style also draws heavily on detective and crime pulp fiction.

Miller&#x27;s &quot;Sin City&quot; work challenges some conventions of comic book form. The letters of onomatopoeic words like &quot;blam&quot; are often incorporated into scenes via lighting effects, or are suggested by the negative space between panels, or are created by the outline of the panels themselves. This is especially evident in early &quot;yarns,&quot; such as &quot;The Hard Goodbye&quot;, which were more experimental.

On April 28, 2022, it was officially announced that Miller was launching the comic book publishing company Frank Miller Presents (FMP), with one of his initial contributions being a Western tale set in Sin City&#x27;s past, titled &quot;Sin City 1858&quot;.

==Setting==

Basin City, almost universally referred to by the nickname &quot;Sin City&quot;, is a fictional town in the Western United States. The climate is hot and arid, although Sacred Oaks is characterized as being heavily wooded. A major river runs through the city, which has an extensive waterfront. Usually twice a year, a major downpour comes, and the city is prone to heavy snowfall in the winter. Desert lizards and palm trees are common, while tar pits, desert areas, mountain ranges and flat farmland make up the landscape around the city.

The Basin City Police Department are more or less along the lines of paramilitary or SWAT, as they have to deal with incredibly high crime rates among criminals and civilians alike, which is why they have access to what most would consider &quot;heavy weaponry&quot; and full body armor. Those who make up the force have been described as commonly being lazy, cowardly and/or corrupt. Only a handful of the cops are honest, though frequently the wealthy of the city bribe the corrupt members of the police into performing their duty (usually as a result of some crime being committed or threatened against a member of their family).

During the California Gold Rush, the Roark family &quot;imported&quot; a large number of attractive women to keep the miners happy, making a fortune and turning a struggling mining camp into a thriving, bustling city. Over the years, as the Roark family migrated into other areas of business and power, these women ended up forming the district of Old Town, the prostitute quarter of the city where they rule with absolute authority. In addition, the people charged with governing the city, most of them from the Roark line, remained in power for generations, running it as they saw fit.

As the various yarns progress, the audience gradually becomes familiar with key locations in and around Basin City:

*The Projects, the run-down and poor side of Sin City, are a tangle of high-rise run-down and desolated apartments where crime runs rampant with no police inside. Its inhabitants have apparently evolved their own independent society with almost no legal contact with the outside world and SWAT teams rarely go in The Projects. Marv was born in the Projects, and currently resides there. Dwight avoids The Projects and hates the neighborhood.
*The Docks, a collection of wharfs and warehouses that are local to the Projects, since The Docks overlook The Projects. Hartigan and Roark Junior have their first confrontation here in &quot;That Yellow Bastard&quot;, and Marv drives a stolen police car off one of the piers at the beginning of &quot;The Hard Goodbye&quot;.
*Kadie&#x27;s Club Pecos is a strip club and bar in Old Town, where Nancy Callahan and Shellie work, and where Dwight McCarthy and Marv spend their spare time. Despite being filled with drunk and violent men, Kadie&#x27;s bar is one of the safest areas in Sin City since it is heavily guarded by prostitutes and their protectors. Marv, who possesses an extraordinarily high sense of chivalry, protects the female employees of Kadie&#x27;s from any violence that makes its way inside.
*Roark Family Farm (a.k.a. &quot;The Farm&quot;) is located at North Cross and Lennox on the hills outside Basin City and shows up in several stories, including &quot;The Hard Goodbye&quot;, &quot;That Yellow Bastard&quot;, &quot; The Babe Wore Red&quot; and &quot;Hell and Back&quot;. It was also home to Kevin, a serial killer with ties to the Roark family. Marv burns down one of the buildings, and the Farm is abandoned sometime after the initial &quot;Sin City&quot; storyline. The Farm is the only location in the comic books that is outside Basin City.
*Old Town is the red-light district, where the city&#x27;s population of prostitutes reside. Old Town is run by Goldie and Wendy. Old Town is off limits to the police. Though willing to engage in almost any sexual act for the right price, the women of Old Town show no mercy to those who &quot;break the rules,&quot; and back up their independence with lethal force. The mafia families and pimps who were into Old Town&#x27;s business were thrown out of the neighborhood.
*Sacred Oaks is the home to the rich and powerful of Sin City. This suburb is located on the outskirts of Basin City as a protection. A university is located in Sacred Oaks, and the entire area is patrolled by armed employees of its wealthy inhabitants, mostly SWAT teams.
*Basin City Central Train Station, which has a direct connection to Phoenix. It is located in the outskirts near The Docks and it is considered one of safer places.
*Mimi&#x27;s, a small run-down motel on the far outskirts of Basin City, with only few rooms and a place where young couples make love. Nancy and Hartigan hid in Mimi&#x27;s where she confessed her love to him. Junior also attacked Hartigan here and left him to die, although he saved himself.
*The Santa Yolanda Tar Pits, an abandoned amusement park of sorts outside the city, where several tar pits are located and dinosaur bones were excavated at some time. After a &quot;big-budget dinosaur movie&quot; caused a sensation, the county put up concrete statues of dinosaurs there to draw crowds. However, after an old lady fell through a railing into one of the pits and had a heart attack, the place was shut down indefinitely. They are frequently used as a place to dump things that people don&#x27;t want found; high-schoolers also tend to sneak in there a lot. This is where Delia tells Phil to drive in &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; and where Dwight takes the corpses of Jackie Boy and his friends in &quot;The Big Fat Kill&quot;. Frank Miller has admitted the main reason the Tar Pits exist is as an excuse to draw the dinosaur statues.

===Individuals===
* Marv
* Dwight McCarthy
* Nancy Callahan 
* Gail
* Miho
* Detective John Hartigan
* Wallace

===Organizations===
Because a large majority of the residents of Basin City are criminals, there are several organizations and cartels central to the stories who are vying for monopoly over the various criminal enterprises in the city. Listed below are crime syndicates, gangs and other low-lifes who figure heavily in the Sin City mythos.

The Basin City Police Department: So deep does corruption and criminality run in Basin City that even their police officers qualify as a gang of paid thugs, turning a blind eye to the affairs of those too poor to pay them off. Few among them are considered incorruptible; even the honest officers are unable (or unwilling) to curtail the criminal actions of the dishonest ones. Notable characters in the series who are police include Detective John Hartigan, his partner Bob, Lieutenants Jack Rafferty and Mort, Commissioner Liebowitz, and Officers Manson and Bundy from &quot;Hell and Back&quot;.

Roark family: A dynasty of corrupt landowners and politicians whose influence over Basin City has stretched as far back as the days of the Old West. Famous Roarks of this generation include a senator, a cardinal, an attorney general, and Roark Junior, &#x27;That Yellow Bastard&#x27;.

The Girls of Old Town: Populating the region of Basin City known as Old Town is a group of women in the world&#x27;s oldest profession, having made a truce with the cops to allow them to govern and police themselves. As of &quot;A Dame to Kill For&quot;, they were led by the twins, Goldie and Wendy.

Wallenquist Organization: A powerful crime syndicate led by Herr Wallenquist, a mysterious crime lord with a broad range of criminal enterprises to his name. Although they are one of the city&#x27;s two &quot;normal&quot; criminal organizations, the Wallenquist management seems to be the most peaceful and forgiving of the various leaders. It is unknown which crime rings they hold.

Magliozzi Crime Family: The undisputed heads of the local Cosa Nostra, the Magliozzi family seems to be the purest example of &quot;true&quot; Mafia lifestyle. While they appear in only one story, it is hinted that the Mafia influence in Basin City&#x27;s underworld is a lot larger than just their family and that there are more families.

Other groups that have been seen or mentioned in the comics include:

Tong gangsters: Mentioned, but not seen as of &quot;A Dame to Kill For&quot;. Miho&#x27;s life was saved by Dwight when he secretly protected her during a fight with several Tong gangsters in a dark alleyway.

White slavers: Mentioned, but not seen as of &quot;A Dame to Kill For&quot;. Led by a man named Manuel, whose brothers were also involved. Were &quot;taken care of&quot; by Dwight prior to the events of &quot;A Dame to Kill For&quot;.

Irish mercenaries: Seen during &quot;The Big Fat Kill&quot;, most of them are evidently former IRA members, as implied by one of the mercenaries referring to his glee at blowing up a public house (British pubs were targeted by the IRA). All are killed by Dwight and Miho.

==&quot;Sin City&quot; yarns==
These are the individual stories, usually referred to as &quot;yarns,&quot; set in Frank Miller&#x27;s Sin City universe.

===Collected editions===
The stories have been collected into a number of trade paperbacks and hardcover editions. There is also a collection of art, &quot;The Art of Sin City&quot;.

In 2016, Dark Horse Comics released an ambitious, oversized edition titled &quot;Frank Miller’s Sin City The Hard Goodbye Curator’s Collection&quot;. This 15 x 21 inch book reprints the entire first storyline, scanned and reproduced exactly from the original art at 1:1 size. When referencing the production process in an interview with Michael Dooley for Print Magazine, editor/designer John Lind gave the anecdote “When Frank and I first reviewed some of the scanned pages from &quot;Sin City&quot;, he pulled one aside and said, ‘You can see details in some of the scans where you can tell what the humidity was like when I was lettering because you can see the smudging from my hand.’ That type of reaction represents the level of detail I&#x27;m working hard to achieve with the production.

==Adaptations==
===Films===
A film adaptation of &quot;Sin City&quot;, co-directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, was released on April 1, 2005. A sequel, &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot;, was released on August 22, 2014.

===Television===

Dimension Films planned to develop a soft reboot of the series for television; Stephen L’Heureux who produced the second film was to oversee the series with &quot;Sin City&quot; creator Frank Miller. The new TV series would feature new characters and timelines and be more like the comics rather than the films. On November 15, 2019, Legendary Pictures bought the rights for the television series.

<doc id="65436" wikidata="Q219155" url="?curid=65436" title="Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)">
<text>Dawn of the Dead is a 1978 zombie horror film written, directed, and edited by George A. Romero, and produced by Richard P. Rubinstein. An American-Italian international co-production, it is the second film in Romero&#x27;s series of zombie films, and though it contains no characters or settings from the preceding film &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (1968), it shows the larger-scale effects of a zombie apocalypse on society. In the film, a phenomenon of unidentified origin has caused the reanimation of the dead, who prey on human flesh. David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger, and Gaylen Ross star as survivors of the outbreak who barricade themselves inside a suburban shopping mall amid mass hysteria.

Romero waited to make another zombie film after &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; for several years to avoid being stereotyped as a horror director. Upon visiting Monroeville Mall in Monroeville, Pennsylvania with a friend whose company managed the complex, he decided to use the location as the basis for the film&#x27;s story. The project came to the attention of Italian filmmaker Dario Argento who, along with his brother Claudio and producer Alfredo Cuomo, agreed to co-finance the film in exchange for its international distribution rights. Argento also consulted with Romero during the scriptwriting phase. Principal photography on &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; took place between November 1977 and February 1978 on location in Monroeville and Pittsburgh. The special make-up effects were created by Tom Savini, whose work on the film led to an extensive career creating similar effects for other horror films. In post-production, Romero and Argento edited separate versions of the film for their respective markets. Argento&#x27;s version features a progressive rock score composed and performed by his frequent collaborators Goblin, while Romero&#x27;s cut primarily favors stock cues from the De Wolfe Music Library.

Following its Italian premiere on September 1, 1978, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was released in other markets the following year. Despite facing difficulties with various national censorship boards – in the United States, it was released unrated to improve its commercial prospects after it was given an X by the Motion Picture Association of America, and in Britain it was liable for seizure during the 1980s &quot;video nasties&quot; moral panic – the film proved to be a major success at the box office, grossing $66 million worldwide against its estimated budget of $640,000. Noted for its satirical portrayal of consumerism, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; has received widespread critical acclaim since its initial release, and is widely considered to be one of the greatest horror films ever made, as well as the greatest zombie film. Like its predecessor, it has garnered a large, international cult following. In 2008, it was chosen by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine as one of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;, along with &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;.

&quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was followed by four official sequels, beginning with 1985&#x27;s &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;, and a separate series of unofficial Italian-made sequels, beginning with 1979&#x27;s &quot;Zombi 2.&quot; It has also inspired a 2004 remake film directed by Zack Snyder, as well as numerous parodies and pop culture references in other media such as &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Dead Rising&quot;, and &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot;.

==Plot==
The United States is devastated by a mysterious plague that reanimates recently-dead human beings as flesh-eating zombies. At the dawn of the crisis, it has been reported that millions of people have died and reanimated. Despite the government&#x27;s best efforts, social order is collapsing. While rural communities have natural barriers, such as Johnstown, and the National Guard have been effective in fighting the zombie hordes in open country, urban centers have descended into chaos.

At WGON-TV, a television studio in Philadelphia, traffic reporter Stephen Andrews and his pregnant girlfriend, producer Fran Parker, are planning to steal the station&#x27;s helicopter to escape the city. Across town, Philadelphia Police Department SWAT officer Roger DeMarco and his team raid a low-income housing project, whose mostly black and Latino tenants are defying the martial law of delivering their dead to the National Guard. The tenants and the officers exchange gunfire as the officers try to gain entry, and indiscriminate attacks by racist officers and the reanimated dead exacerbate the resulting chaos. Roger encounters an officer from another unit, Peter Washington. As the SWAT team successfully dispatch the zombies, a disillusioned Roger suggests that he and Peter desert and join up with Stephen (who is Roger&#x27;s friend) in escaping the city.

Roger and Peter join Fran and Stephen at a police dock and then leave Philadelphia in a stolen WGON-TV news helicopter. Following some close calls while stopping for fuel, the group comes across a shopping mall, and decide to remain there since there is plenty of food, medicine, and all kinds of consumables. Roger, Peter and Stephen camouflage the entrance to the stairwell leading to their safe room and block the mall entrances with trucks to keep the undead from penetrating. This involves driving through crowds of zombies, who attack the trucks. Roger becomes reckless and is soon bitten by the zombies.

After clearing the mall&#x27;s interior of zombies, the four enjoy a hedonistic lifestyle with all the goods available to them. Roger eventually succumbs to his wounds and dies; when he reanimates, Peter shoots him in the head and buries his body in the mall. Sometime later, all emergency broadcast transmissions cease, suggesting that the government has collapsed. Now isolated, the three load some supplies into the helicopter, in case they might need to leave suddenly. Fran gets Stephen to teach her how to fly in case he is killed or incapacitated.

A nomadic biker gang sees the helicopter in flight and breaks into the mall, destroying the barriers and allowing hundreds of zombies back inside. Despite having a fallback plan should the mall be attacked, Stephen, consumed by territorial rage, takes matters into his own hands by firing on the looters, beginning a protracted battle. On their way out, straggling bikers are overwhelmed and eaten by the zombies. Stephen tries to hide in the elevator shaft, but gets shot and subsequently mauled by roaming zombies. When Stephen reanimates, he instinctively returns to the safe room and leads the undead to Fran and Peter. Peter kills the undead Stephen while Fran escapes to the roof. Peter, not wanting to leave, locks himself in a room and contemplates suicide. When the zombies burst in, he has a change of heart and fights his way up to the roof, where he joins Fran. Having escaped and low on fuel, the two then fly away in the helicopter to an uncertain future.

==Production==
===Development===
The history of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; began in 1974, when George A. Romero was invited by friend Mark Mason of Oxford Development Company—whom Romero knew from an acquaintance at his alma mater, Carnegie Mellon—to visit the Monroeville Mall, which Mason&#x27;s company managed. After showing Romero hidden parts of the mall, during which Romero noted the bliss of the consumers, Mason jokingly suggested that someone would be able to survive in the mall, should an emergency ever occur. With this inspiration, Romero began to write the screenplay for the film.

Romero and his producer, Richard P. Rubinstein, were unable to procure any domestic investors for the new project. By chance, word of the sequel reached Italian horror director Dario Argento. A fan of &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; and an early critical proponent of the film, Argento was eager to help the horror classic receive a sequel. He met Romero and Rubinstein, helping to secure financing in exchange for international distribution rights. Argento invited Romero to Rome so he would have a change of scenery while writing the screenplay. The two could also discuss plot developments. Romero was able to secure the availability of the Monroeville Mall as well as additional financing through his connections with the mall&#x27;s owners at Oxford Development. Once the casting was completed, principal shooting was scheduled to begin in Pennsylvania on November 13, 1977.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography for &quot;Dawn of the Living Dead&quot; (its working title at the time) began on November 13, 1977, at the Monroeville Mall in Monroeville, Pennsylvania. Use of an actual, open shopping mall during the Christmas shopping season caused numerous time constraints. Filming began nightly once the mall closed, starting at 11 PM and ending at 7 AM, when automated music came on. As December arrived, the production decided against having the crew remove and replace the Christmas decorations—a task that had proved to be too time-consuming. Filming was shut down during the last three weeks of the year to avoid the possible continuity difficulties and lost shooting time. Production would resume on January 3, 1978. During the break in filming, Romero took the opportunity to begin editing his existing footage.

The airfield scenes were filmed at the Harold W. Brown Memorial Airfield in Monroeville, an airport located about two miles from the mall that is still in use. The scenes of the group&#x27;s hideout at the top of the mall were filmed on a set built at Romero&#x27;s then-production company, The Latent Image. The elevator shaft was located there as well, as no such area of the mall actually existed. The gun store was also not located in the mall—for filming, the crew used Firearms Unlimited, a shop that existed in the East Liberty district of Pittsburgh at the time. The police dock scene was filmed in downtown Pittsburgh right next the Monongahela River at 1 S. 6th St. The building, landing pad, and pumps are long gone, and the location is now an outdoor art gallery called The Color Park. The truck yard scene was filmed at the B&amp;P Motor Express Co. which is now a First Student school bus company in Irwin, PA, about 22 minutes from the Monroeville Mall.

Principal photography on &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; ended in February 1978, and Romero&#x27;s process of editing would begin. By using numerous angles during the filming, Romero allowed himself an array of possibilities during editing—choosing from these many shots to reassemble into a sequence that could dictate any number of responses from the viewer simply by changing an angle or deleting or extending portions of scenes. This amount of superfluous footage is evidenced by the numerous international cuts, which in some cases affects the regional version&#x27;s tone and flow.

According to the original screenplay, Peter and Francine were to kill themselves, Peter by shooting himself and Fran by sticking her head into the path of the rotating main helicopter blades. The ending credits would run over a shot of the helicopter blades turning until the engine winds down, implying that the two would not have gotten far if they had chosen to escape. During production, it was decided to change the ending of the film.

Much of the lead-in to the two suicides remains in the film as Francine leans out of the helicopter upon seeing the zombies approach, and Peter puts a gun to his head, ready to shoot himself. An additional scene, showing a zombie having the top of its head cut off by the helicopter blades (thus foreshadowing Francine&#x27;s suicide) was included early in the film. Romero has stated that the original ending was scrapped before being shot, although behind-the-scenes photos show the original version was at least tested. The head appliance made for Francine&#x27;s suicide was instead used in the opening SWAT raid, made-up to resemble an African American male and blown apart by a shotgun blast.

==== Make-up and effects ====
 Tom Savini, who had been offered the chance to provide special effects and make-up for Romero&#x27;s first zombie film, &quot;Night of the Living Dead,&quot; before being drafted into the Vietnam War, made his debut as an effects artist on &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;. Savini had been known for his make-up in horror for some time, prior to &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, and in his book explaining special effects techniques, &quot;Bizarro&quot;, explains how his time in Vietnam influenced his craft. He had a crew of eight to assist in applying gray makeup to two to three hundred extras each weekend during the shoot. One of his assistants during production was Joseph Pilato, who played a police captain in the film and would go on to play the lead villain in the film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;, Captain Henry Rhodes.

The makeup for the multitudes of extras in the film was a basic blue or gray tinge to the face of each extra. Some featured zombies, who would be seen close-up or on-screen longer than others, had more time spent on their look. Many of the featured zombies became part of the fanfare, with nicknames based upon their look or activity—such as Machete Zombie, Sweater Zombie, and Nurse Zombie. &quot;Sweater Zombie&quot; Clayton Hill was described by a crew member as &quot;one of the most convincing zombies of the bunch&quot; citing his skill at maintaining his stiff pose and rolling his eyes back into his head, including heading down the wrong way in an escalator while in character.

A cast of Ross&#x27; head that was to be used in the original ending of the film (involving a suicide rather than the escape scene finally used) ended up as an exploding head during the tenement building scene. The head, filled with food scraps, was shot with an actual shotgun to get the head to explode. One of the unintentional standout effects was the bright, fluorescent color of the fake blood that was used in the film. Savini was an early opponent of the blood, produced by 3M, but Romero thought it added to the film, claiming it emphasised the comic book feel of the movie.

==== Music ====

The film&#x27;s music varies with Romero&#x27;s and Argento&#x27;s cuts. For Romero&#x27;s theatrical version, musical cues and selections were chosen from the De Wolfe Music Library, a compilation of stock music scores and cues. In the montage scene featuring the hunters and National Guard, the song played in the background is Cause I&#x27;m a Man&quot; by the Pretty Things. The song was first released on the group&#x27;s LP &quot;Electric Banana&quot;. The music heard playing in a sequence in the mall and over the film&#x27;s end credits is an instrumental titled &quot;The Gonk&quot;—a polka style tune from the De Wolfe Music Library written by Herbert Chappell, with a chorus of zombie moans added by Romero.

For Argento&#x27;s international cut, the Italian director used the band Goblin (incorrectly credited as &quot;The Goblins&quot;) extensively. Goblin is a four-piece Italian progressive rock band that mostly provides contract work for film soundtracks. Argento, who received a credit for original music alongside Goblin, collaborated with the group to get music for his cut of the film. Romero used three of their pieces in his theatrical release version. The Goblin score would later find its way onto a &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;-inspired film, &quot;Hell of the Living Dead&quot;. Many tracks would also appear in the Tsui Hark film &quot;Dangerous Encounters of the First Kind&quot;. The version of &quot;Dawn&quot; released on video in the mid-nineties under the label &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; does not use most of the Goblin tracks, as they had not been completed at the time of that edit.

=== Post-production ===
&quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; has received a number of re-cuts and re-edits, due mostly to Argento&#x27;s rights to edit the film for international foreign language release. Romero controlled the final cut of the film for English-language territories. In addition, the film was edited further by censors or distributors in certain countries. Romero, acting as the editor for his film, completed a hasty 139-minute version of the film (now known as the Extended, or previously erroneously as Director&#x27;s Cut) for premiere at the 1978 Cannes Film Market. This was later pared down to 126 minutes for the US theatrical release. The US theatrical cut of the film earned the taboo rating of X because of its graphic violence. Rejecting this rating, Romero and the producers chose to release the film unrated to help the film&#x27;s commercial success. United Film Distribution Company eventually agreed to release it domestically in the United States. The film was refused classification in Australia twice: in its theatrical release in 1978 and once again in 1979. The cuts presented to the Australian Classification Board were Argento&#x27;s cut and Romero&#x27;s cut, respectively. &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was finally released there by United Artists, with an R18+ rating following six minutes worth of cuts compared to Romero&#x27;s US version, in February 1980.

Internationally, Argento controlled the Euro cut for non-English speaking countries. The version he created clocked in at 119 minutes. It included changes such as more music from Goblin than the cuts completed by Romero, removal of some expository scenes, and a faster cutting pace. There are, however, extra lines of dialogue and gore shots that are not in either of Romero&#x27;s edits. It actually debuted nearly nine months before the US theatrical cut. &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was released under different names in Europe: in Italy as , followed in March 1979 in France as , in Spain as , in the Netherlands as , in Germany by Constantin Film as , and in Denmark as .

&quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was successful internationally. Its success in then-West Germany earned it the Golden Screen Award, given to films that have at least three million admissions within 18 months of release. A majority of these versions were released on DVD in the 2004 Special Edition, and have previously been released on VHS. The freelance photographer Richard Burke, working for &quot;Pittsburgh Magazine&quot;, released in May 2010 the first exclusive behind-the-scenes photos from the set.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
On September 1, 1978, a 119-minute cut of the film created for non-English speaking countries premiered in Turin, Italy under the title &quot;Zombi&quot;, with Dario Argento in attendance. The same cut would open in Japan the weekend on March 27, 1979, and immediately top its box office there. A 126-minute cut for English-language speaking territories premiered in the United States on April 7, 1979, at the USA Film Festival in Dallas, Texas, having been selected for the event by film critic Roger Ebert. The following weekend, United Film Distribution opened the same cut in seventeen Pittsburgh cinemas, and continued with a wider rollout over the next month. The picture opened in New York City on April 20, and in Los Angeles on May 11.

===Home media===
In 2004, after numerous VHS, Laserdisc and DVD releases of several different versions of the film from various companies, Anchor Bay Entertainment released a definitive &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; DVD box set of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, following a single-disc U.S. theatrical cut released earlier in the year. The set features all three widely available versions of the film, along with different commentary tracks for each version, documentaries and extras. Also re-released with the DVD set was Roy Frumkes&#x27; &quot;Document of the Dead&quot;, which chronicled the making of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; and Romero&#x27;s career to that point. The &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; earned a Saturn Award for Best Classic Film Release.

The U.S. theatrical cut of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was released on Blu-ray by Anchor Bay on October 7, 2007, in the U.S. It was released on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom by Arrow Video, which includes the theatrical cut and two DVDs with the Cannes and Argento cut. An Australian Blu-ray was released by Umbrella Entertainment. Reportedly, the film went out of print on home media as a result of Rubinstein significantly increasing its home media licensing fees. Some speculate that this was due to a desire to recoup the $6 million he spent producing a 3D conversion of the film.

In November 2016, Koch Media, under their Midnight Factory line, released a six-disc Collector&#x27;s Edition Blu-ray package for the Italian market. This release includes the Argento cut in 4K Ultra HD format, as well as both the original 1.85:1 theatrical framing and 1.33:1 full-frame of the Argento cut, as well as the original theatrical cut and the extended Cannes cut of the film in high definition Blu-ray format. Koch also released a four-disc set, omitting the UHD and 1.33:1 discs, and a single Blu-ray of the European cut.

In 2018, XT Video released the complete version of the film for Blu-ray, which is a fusion of the long and Italian versions of the film, plus cut scenes.

In November 2020, British home media distributor Second Sight Films released a limited edition box set of the film in separate Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray formats, featuring the theatrical, Cannes and Argento cuts of the film. For this release, all three cuts were remastered and restored in 4K resolution, with the theatrical and Cannes versions presented on the 4K Blu-ray sets in HDR10+. The theatrical and Cannes cuts were restored from the original camera negative by Second Sight at Final Frame New York and London under the supervision and approval of Michael Gornick, the film&#x27;s cinematographer. The audio, presented in Mono (with additional Stereo and 5.1 Surround tracks for the theatrical cut), was restored from the negative&#x27;s optical soundtrack. Scenes exclusive to the Cannes version were restored using that version&#x27;s color reversal internegative, while the Argento version, presented in SDR, was restored from its interpositive, and similarly features Mono, Stereo and 5.1 Surround audio tracks. The box set also contains a Blu-ray disc with a collection of original and archival bonus features; three CDs featuring Goblin&#x27;s original soundtrack and a compilation of the De Wolfe Music cues featured in the theatrical and Cannes cuts; &quot;Dawn of the Dead: Dissecting the Dead&quot;, a hardcover book containing essays, artwork and other archival features; and a paperback copy of the film&#x27;s novelisation.

=== 3D re-release ===
Work on a 3D conversion of the film was begun in 2007 under the supervision of Rubinstein. It was completed in 2013 at a reported cost of $6 million. The 3D version had its world premiere in October 2013 at the Busan International Film Festival. In October 2022, it finally received a wider release, exclusively in 250 Regal Cinemas theaters. It was screened again at five North American theaters as part of a 45th anniversary re-release of the film in 2024.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; performed well thanks both to commercial advertising and word-of-mouth. Ad campaigns and posters declared the film &quot;the most intensely shocking motion picture experience for all times&quot;. The film earned $900,000 on its opening weekend in the United States. After four weeks it had grossed in the United States and Canada, and went on to gross $16 million with rentals of $6.8 million.

Internationally it did well too, grossing $1.5 million in six Japanese cinemas over a period of 42 days and over $1 million in Italy, and by October 1979 it had grossed $24 million worldwide. &quot;The Numbers&quot; claims it had an international gross of $49.9 million, which with a domestic gross of $16 million, gives a worldwide total of $66 million, making it the most profitable film in the &quot;Dead&quot; series.

===Critical reception===

Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 92% of 59 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review. The average rating is 8.70/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;One of the most compelling and entertaining zombie films ever, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; perfectly blends pure horror and gore with social commentary on material society.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it four out of four stars and proclaimed it &quot;one of the best horror films ever made.&quot; While conceding &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; to be &quot;gruesome, sickening, disgusting, violent, brutal and appalling,&quot; Ebert said that &quot;nobody ever said art had to be in good taste.&quot; Steve Biodrowski of &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; praised the film, calling it a &quot;broader&quot; version of &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, and gave particular credit to the acting and themes explored: &quot;the acting performances are uniformly strong; and the script develops its themes more explicitly, with obvious satirical jabs at modern consumer society, as epitomized by the indoor shopping mall where a small band of human survivors take shelter from the zombie plague sweeping the country.&quot; He went on to say that &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was a &quot;savage (if tongue-in-cheek) attack on the foibles of modern society&quot;, showcasing explicit gore and horror and turning them into &quot;a form of art&quot;. Gene Siskel liked the movie as well, giving it 3 stars in his Chicago Tribune print review and specifically praising George Romero&#x27;s satirical view of indoor shopping malls relative to a zombie apocalypse; the review was later cited along with some other films (including Scanners) when horror movie fans castigated Siskel for what they felt was his knee-jerk rejection of movies in that genre.

Similar to the preceding &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, some critical reviewers did not like the gory special effects. Particularly displeased at the large amount of gore and graphic violence was &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Janet Maslin, who claimed she walked out after the first fifteen minutes due to &quot;a pet peeve about flesh-eating zombies who never stop snacking,&quot; and Gene Shalit of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show dismissed it as &quot;Yawn of the Living.&quot; Others, particularly &quot;Variety&quot;, attacked the film&#x27;s writing, suggesting that the violence and gore detract from any development of the characters, making them &quot;uninteresting&quot;, resulting in a loss of impact. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Dawn&quot; pummels the viewer with a series of ever-more-grisly events — shootings, knifings, flesh tearings — that make Romero&#x27;s special effects man, Tom Savini, the real &quot;star&quot; of the film—the actors are as woodenly uninteresting as the characters they play.&quot; Pauline Kael wrote that, in contrast to the &quot;truly frightening&quot; &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, &quot;you begin to laugh with relief that you&#x27;re not being emotionally challenged or even affected; [&quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; is] just a gross-out.&quot; Leslie Halliwell of &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; stated that the film was &quot;occasionally laughable, otherwise sickening or boring.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; dismissed it as &quot;fake mayhem and not worth getting exercised about,&quot; adding: &quot;Here is a picture that anyone can walk out of with head held high and a clear and untroubled conscience.&quot;

The film is often cited as being one of the few sequels that are superior to the original. The film was selected as one of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot; by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine in 2008. It was also named as one of &quot;The Best 1000 Movies Ever Made&quot;, a list published by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 2016, James Charisma of &quot;Playboy&quot; ranked the film #10 on a list of &quot;15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals&quot;. The 25th anniversary issue of &quot;Fangoria&quot; named it the best horror film of 1979 (although it was released a year earlier), and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it #27 on a list of &quot;The Top 50 Cult Films.&quot; Film.com and Filmsite.org rated it as one of the best films of 1978. In 2024, Paste Magazine ranked &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; number 8 on its list of the 100 greatest horror movies.

==Remake==

Released in 2004, the remake of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was directed by Zack Snyder (in his directorial debut) and written by James Gunn. It stars Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, and Jake Weber with cameos from original cast members Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger, and Tom Savini.

==Novelization==
George Romero and Susanna Sparrow&#x27;s paperback book based on the film was released in 1978. It was reissued, with a new introduction by Simon Pegg, on May 26, 2015, by Gallery Books. It was reissued again in November 2020, with Pegg&#x27;s introduction and new artwork, as part of Second Sight Films&#x27; limited edition Blu-ray release of the film.

<text>Glenn Herbert Gould (; né Gold; 25 September 19324 October 1982) was a Canadian classical pianist. He was among the most famous and celebrated pianists of the 20th century, renowned as an interpreter of the keyboard works of Johann Sebastian Bach. His playing was distinguished by remarkable technical proficiency and a capacity to articulate the contrapuntal texture of Bach&#x27;s music.

Gould rejected most of the Romantic piano literature by Chopin, Schumann, Liszt, Rachmaninoff, and others, in favour of Bach and Beethoven mainly, along with some late-Romantic and modernist composers. Gould also recorded works by Haydn, Mozart, and Brahms; pre-Baroque composers such as Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, William Byrd, and Orlando Gibbons; and 20th-century composers including Paul Hindemith, Arnold Schoenberg, Alexander Scriabin and Richard Strauss.

Gould was also a writer and broadcaster, and dabbled in composing and conducting. He produced television programmes about classical music, in which he would speak and perform, or interact with an interviewer in a scripted manner. He made three &quot;musique concrète&quot; radio documentaries, collectively the &quot;Solitude Trilogy&quot;, about isolated areas of Canada. He was a prolific contributor to music journals, in which he discussed music theory. Gould was known for his eccentricities, ranging from his unorthodox musical interpretations and mannerisms at the keyboard to aspects of his lifestyle and behaviour. He disliked public performance, and stopped giving concerts at age 31 to concentrate on studio recording and media.

==Life==

===Early life===
Glenn Gould was born at home at 32 Southwood Drive in The Beaches, Toronto, on September 25, 1932, the only child of Russell Herbert Gold and Florence Emma Gold (born Greig, a distant relative of the Norwegian composer and pianist Edvard Grieg), Presbyterians of Scottish and English ancestry. The family&#x27;s surname was informally changed to Gould around 1939 to avoid being mistaken for Jewish, given the prevailing antisemitism of prewar Toronto. Gould had no Jewish ancestry, though he sometimes joked about it, saying, &quot;When people ask me if I&#x27;m Jewish, I always tell them that I was Jewish during the war.&quot;

Gould&#x27;s interest in music and his talent as a pianist were evident very early. Both parents were musical; his mother, especially, encouraged his musical development from infancy. Hoping he would become a successful musician, she exposed him to music during her pregnancy. She taught him the piano and as a baby, he reportedly hummed instead of crying, and wiggled his fingers as if playing a keyboard instrument, leading his doctor to predict that he would &quot;be either a physician or a pianist&quot;. He learned to read music before he could read words, and it was observed that he had perfect pitch at age three. When presented with a piano, the young Gould was reported to strike single notes and listen to their long decay, a practice his father Bert noted was different from typical children. Gould&#x27;s interest in the piano was concomitant with an interest in composition. He played his pieces for family, friends, and sometimes large gatherings—including, in 1938, a performance at the Emmanuel Presbyterian Church (a few blocks from the Gould family home) of one of his compositions.

Gould first heard a live musical performance by a celebrated soloist at age six. This profoundly affected him. He later described the experience:
It was Hofmann. It was, I think, his last performance in Toronto, and it was a staggering impression. The only thing I can really remember is that, when I was being brought home in a car, I was in that wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds going through your mind. They were all sounds, but was playing them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann. I was enchanted.

At age 10, he began attending the Toronto Conservatory of Music in Toronto (known since 1947 as The Royal Conservatory of Music). He studied music theory with Leo Smith, organ with Frederick C. Silvester, and piano with Alberto Guerrero. Around the same time, he injured his back as a result of a fall from a boat ramp on the shore of Lake Simcoe. This incident is apocryphally related to the adjustable-height chair his father made shortly thereafter. Gould&#x27;s mother would urge the young Gould to sit up straight at the keyboard. He used this chair for the rest of his life, taking it with him almost everywhere. The chair was designed so that Gould could sit very low and allowed him to pull down on the keys rather than striking them from above, a central technical idea of Guerrero&#x27;s.

Gould developed a technique that enabled him to choose a very fast tempo while retaining the &quot;separateness&quot; and clarity of each note. His extremely low position at the instrument permitted him more control over the keyboard. Gould showed considerable technical skill in performing and recording a wide repertoire including virtuosic and romantic works, such as his own arrangement of Ravel&#x27;s &quot;La valse&quot; and Liszt&#x27;s transcriptions of Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth and Sixth Symphonies. Gould worked from a young age with Guerrero on a technique known as finger-tapping: a method of training the fingers to act more independently from the arm.

Gould passed his final Conservatory examination in piano at age 12, achieving the highest marks of any candidate, and thus attaining professional standing as a pianist. One year later he passed the written theory exams, qualifying for an Associate of the Toronto Conservatory of Music (ATCM) diploma.

Gould&#x27;s next-door neighbour as a child and lifelong best friend was Robert Fulford, who became a prominent journalist and essayist. In 1952, Fulford and Gould founded New Music Associates, which produced and promoted Gould&#x27;s first three public performances, including Gould&#x27;s debut performance of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;.

===Piano===
Gould was a child prodigy and was described in adulthood as a musical phenomenon. He claimed to have almost never practiced on the piano itself, preferring to study repertoire by reading, another technique he had learned from Guerrero. He may have spoken ironically about his practising, though, as there is evidence that, on occasion, he did practise quite hard, sometimes using his own drills and techniques. He seemed able to practise mentally, once preparing for a recording of Brahms&#x27;s piano works without playing them until a few weeks before the sessions. Gould could play a vast repertoire of piano music, as well as a wide range of orchestral and operatic transcriptions, from memory. He could &quot;memorize at sight&quot; and once challenged a friend to name any piece of music that he could not &quot;instantly play from memory&quot;.

The piano, Gould said, &quot;is not an instrument for which I have any great love as such ... [but] I have played it all my life, and it is the best vehicle I have to express my ideas.&quot; In the case of Bach, Gould noted, &quot;[I] fixed the action in some of the instruments I play on—and the piano I use for all recordings is now so fixed—so that it is a shallower and more responsive action than the standard. It tends to have a mechanism which is rather like an automobile without power steering: you are in control and not it; it doesn&#x27;t drive you, you drive it. This is the secret of doing Bach on the piano at all. You must have that immediacy of response, that control over fine definitions of things.&quot;

As a teenager, Gould was significantly influenced by Artur Schnabel and Rosalyn Tureck&#x27;s recordings of Bach (which he called &quot;upright, with a sense of repose and positiveness&quot;), and the conductor Leopold Stokowski. Gould was known for his vivid imagination. Listeners regarded his interpretations as ranging from brilliantly creative to outright eccentric. His pianism had great clarity and erudition, particularly in contrapuntal passages, and extraordinary control. Gould believed the piano to be &quot;a contrapuntal instrument&quot; and his whole approach to music was centered in the Baroque. Much of the homophony that followed he felt belongs to a less serious and less spiritual period of art.

Gould had a pronounced aversion to what he termed &quot;hedonistic&quot; approaches to piano repertoire, performance, and music generally. For him, &quot;hedonism&quot; in this sense denoted a superficial theatricality, something to which he felt Mozart, for example, became increasingly susceptible later in his career. He associated this drift toward hedonism with the emergence of a cult of showmanship and gratuitous virtuosity on the concert platform in the 19th century and later. The institution of the public concert, he felt, degenerated into the &quot;blood sport&quot; with which he struggled, and which he ultimately rejected.

===Performances===
On 5 June 1938, at age five, Gould played in public for the first time, joining his family on stage to play piano at a church service at the Business Men&#x27;s Bible Class in Uxbridge, Ontario, in front of a congregation of about 2,000. In 1945, at 13, he made his first appearance with an orchestra in a performance of the first movement of Beethoven&#x27;s 4th Piano Concerto with the Toronto Symphony. His first solo concert followed in 1947, and his first recital on radio was with the CBC in 1950. This was the beginning of Gould&#x27;s long association with radio and recording. He founded the Festival Trio chamber group in 1953 with cellist Isaac Mamott and violinist Albert Pratz.

Gould made his American debut on 2 January 1955, in Washington, D.C. at The Phillips Collection. The music critic Paul Hume wrote in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;January 2 is early for predictions, but it is unlikely that the year 1955 will bring us a finer piano recital than that played yesterday afternoon in the Phillips Gallery. We shall be lucky if it brings us others of equal beauty and significance.&quot; A performance at The Town Hall in New York City followed on 11 January. Gould&#x27;s reputation quickly grew. In 1957, he undertook a tour of the Soviet Union, becoming the first North American to play there since World War II. His concerts featured Bach, Beethoven, and the serial music of Schoenberg and Berg, which had been suppressed in the Soviet Union during the era of Socialist Realism. Gould debuted in Boston in 1958, playing for the Peabody Mason Concert Series. On 31 January 1960, Gould first appeared on American television on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Ford Presents&quot; series, performing Bach&#x27;s Keyboard Concerto No. 1 in D minor (BWV 1052) with Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic.

Gould believed that the institution of the public concert was an anachronism and a &quot;force of evil&quot;, leading to his early retirement from concert performance. He argued that public performance devolved into a sort of competition, with a non-empathetic audience mostly attendant to the possibility of the performer erring or failing critical expectation; and that such performances produced unexceptional interpretations because of the limitations of live music. He set forth this doctrine, half in jest, in &quot;GPAADAK&quot;, the Gould Plan for the Abolition of Applause and Demonstrations of All Kinds. On 10 April 1964, he gave his last public performance, at Los Angeles&#x27;s Wilshire Ebell Theater. Among the pieces he performed were Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 30, selections from Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;, and Hindemith&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 3. Gould performed fewer than 200 concerts, of which fewer than 40 were outside Canada. For a pianist such as Van Cliburn, 200 concerts would have amounted to about two years&#x27; touring.

One of Gould&#x27;s reasons for abandoning live performance was his aesthetic preference for the recording studio, where, in his words, he developed a &quot;love affair with the microphone&quot;. There, he could control every aspect of the final musical product by selecting parts of various takes. He felt that he could realize a musical score more fully this way. Gould felt strongly that there was little point in re-recording centuries-old pieces if the performer had no new perspective to bring. For the rest of his life, he eschewed live performance, focusing instead on recording, writing, and broadcasting.

===Eccentricities===

Gould was widely known for his unusual habits. He often hummed or sang while he played, and his audio engineers were not always able to exclude his voice from recordings. Gould claimed that his singing was unconscious and increased in proportion to his inability to produce his intended interpretation on a given piano. It is likely that the habit originated in his having been taught by his mother to &quot;sing everything that he played&quot;, as his biographer Kevin Bazzana wrote. This became &quot;an unbreakable (and notorious) habit&quot;. Some of Gould&#x27;s recordings were severely criticised because of this background &quot;vocalising&quot;. For example, a reviewer of his 1981 rerecording of the &quot;&quot; wrote that many listeners would &quot;find the groans and croons intolerable&quot;. Gould was known for his peculiar, even theatrical, gesticulations while playing. Another oddity was his insistence on absolute control over every aspect of his environment. The temperature of the recording studio had to be precisely regulated; he invariably insisted that it be extremely warm. According to another of Gould&#x27;s biographers, Otto Friedrich, the air-conditioning engineer had to work just as hard as the recording engineers.

The piano had to be set at a certain height and would be raised on wooden blocks if necessary. A rug would sometimes be required for his feet. He had to sit exactly above the floor, and would play concerts only with the chair his father had made. He continued to use the chair even when its seat was completely worn, and became so closely identified with it that it is displayed in a glass case at Library and Archives Canada.

Conductors had mixed responses to Gould and his playing habits. George Szell, who led Gould in 1957 with the Cleveland Orchestra, remarked to his assistant, &quot;That nut&#x27;s a genius.&quot; Bernstein said, &quot;There is nobody quite like him, and I just love playing with him.&quot; Bernstein created a stir at the concert of April 6, 1962, when, just before the New York Philharmonic was to perform the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor with Gould, he informed the audience that he was assuming no responsibility for what they were about to hear. He asked the audience: &quot;In a concerto, who is the bossthe soloist or the conductor?&quot;, to which the audience laughed. &quot;The answer is, of course, sometimes the one and sometimes the other, depending on the people involved.&quot; Specifically, Bernstein was referring to their rehearsals, with Gould&#x27;s insistence that the entire first movement be played at half the indicated tempo. The speech was interpreted by Harold C. Schonberg, music critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, as an abdication of responsibility and an attack on Gould. Plans for a studio recording of the performance came to nothing. The live radio broadcast was subsequently released on CD, Bernstein&#x27;s disclaimer included.

Gould was averse to cold and wore heavy clothing (including gloves) even in warm places. He was once arrested, possibly being mistaken for a vagrant, while sitting on a park bench in Sarasota, Florida, dressed in his standard all-climate attire of coat, hat and mittens. He also disliked social functions. He hated being touched, and in later life limited personal contact, relying on the telephone and letters for communication. On a visit to Steinway Hall in New York City in 1959, the chief piano technician at the time, William Hupfer, greeted Gould with a slap on the back. Gould was shocked by this, and complained of aching, lack of coordination, and fatigue because of it. He went on to explore the possibility of litigation against Steinway &amp; Sons if his apparent injuries were permanent. He was known for cancelling performances at the last minute, which is why Bernstein&#x27;s aforementioned public disclaimer opened with, &quot;Don&#x27;t be frightened, Mr. Gould is here ... [he] will appear in a moment.&quot;

In his liner notes and broadcasts, Gould created more than two dozen alter egos for satirical, humorous, and didactic purposes, permitting him to write hostile reviews or incomprehensible commentaries on his own performances. Probably the best-known are the German musicologist Karlheinz Klopweisser, the English conductor Sir Nigel Twitt-Thornwaite, and the American critic Theodore Slutz. These facets of Gould, whether interpreted as neurosis or &quot;play&quot;, have provided ample material for psychobiography.

Gould was a teetotaller and did not smoke. He did not cook; instead he often ate at restaurants and relied on room service. He ate one meal a day, supplemented by arrowroot biscuits and coffee. In his later years he claimed to be vegetarian, though this is not certain.

===Personal life===
Gould lived a private life. The documentary filmmaker Bruno Monsaingeon said of him: &quot;No supreme pianist has ever given of his heart and mind so overwhelmingly while showing himself so sparingly.&quot; He never married, and biographers have spent considerable time on his sexuality. Bazzana writes that &quot;it is tempting to assume that Gould was asexual, an image that certainly fits his aesthetic and the persona he sought to convey, and one can read the whole Gould literature and be convinced that he died a virgin&quot;—but he also mentions that evidence points to &quot;a number of relationships with women that may or may not have been platonic and ultimately became complicated and were ended&quot;.

One piece of evidence arrived in 2007. When Gould was in Los Angeles in 1956, he met Cornelia Foss, an art instructor, and her husband Lukas, a conductor. After several years, she and Gould became lovers. In 1967, she left her husband for Gould, taking her two children with her to Toronto. She purchased a house near Gould&#x27;s apartment. In 2007, Foss confirmed that she and Gould had had a love affair for several years. According to her, &quot;There were a lot of misconceptions about Glenn, and it was partly because he was so very private. But I assure you, he was an extremely heterosexual man. Our relationship was, among other things, quite sexual.&quot; Their affair lasted until 1972, when she returned to her husband. As early as two weeks after leaving her husband, Foss noticed disturbing signs in Gould, alluding to unusual behaviour that was more than &quot;just neurotic&quot;. Specifically, he believed that &quot;someone was spying on him&quot;, according to Foss&#x27;s son.

===Health and death===
Though an admitted hypochondriac, Gould had many pains and ailments, but his autopsy revealed few underlying problems in areas that often troubled him. He worried about everything from high blood pressure (which in his later years he recorded in diary form) to the safety of his hands. (Gould rarely shook people&#x27;s hands, and habitually wore gloves.) The spine injury he experienced as a child led physicians to prescribe, usually independently, an assortment of analgesics, anxiolytics, and other drugs. Bazzana has speculated that Gould&#x27;s increasing use of a variety of prescription medications over his career may have had a deleterious effect on his health. It had reached the stage, Bazzana writes, that &quot;he was taking pills to counteract the side effects of other pills, creating a cycle of dependency&quot;. In 1956, Gould told photojournalist Jock Carroll about &quot;my hysteria about eating. It&#x27;s getting worse all the time.&quot; In his biography, psychiatrist Peter F. Ostwald noted Gould&#x27;s increasing neurosis about food in the mid-1950s, something Gould had spoken to him about. Ostwald later discussed the possibility that Gould had developed a &quot;psychogenic eating disorder&quot; around this time. In 1956, Gould was also taking Thorazine, an anti-psychotic medication, and reserpine, another anti-psychotic, which can also be used to lower blood pressure. Cornelia Foss has said that Gould took many antidepressants, which she blamed for his deteriorating mental state.

Whether Gould&#x27;s behaviour fell within the autism spectrum has been debated. The diagnosis was first suggested by psychiatrist Peter Ostwald, a friend of Gould&#x27;s, in the 1997 book &quot;Glenn Gould: The Ecstasy and Tragedy of Genius&quot;. There has also been speculation that he may have had bipolar disorder, because he sometimes went several days without sleep, had extreme increases in energy, drove recklessly, and in later life endured severe depressive episodes.

On 27 September 1982, two days after his 50th birthday, after experiencing a severe headache, Gould had a stroke that paralyzed the left side of his body. He was admitted to Toronto General Hospital and his condition rapidly deteriorated. By 4 October, there was evidence of brain damage, and Gould&#x27;s father decided that his son should be taken off life support. Gould&#x27;s public funeral was held in St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church on 15 October with singing by Lois Marshall and Maureen Forrester. The service was attended by over 3,000 people and was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He is buried next to his parents in Toronto&#x27;s Mount Pleasant Cemetery (section 38, lot 1050). The first few bars of the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; are carved on his grave marker. An animal lover, Gould left half his estate to the Toronto Humane Society; the other half went to the Salvation Army.

In 2000, a movement disorder neurologist suggested in a paper that Gould had dystonia, &quot;a problem little understood in his time.&quot;

== Perspectives ==
===Writings===
Gould periodically told interviewers he would have been a writer if he had not been a pianist. He expounded his criticism and philosophy of music and art in lectures, convocation speeches, periodicals, and CBC radio and television documentaries. Gould participated in many interviews, and had a predilection for scripting them to the extent that they may be seen to be as written work as much as off-the-cuff discussions. Gould&#x27;s writing style was highly articulate, but sometimes florid, indulgent, and rhetorical. This is especially evident in his (frequent) attempts at humour and irony. Bazzana writes that although some of Gould&#x27;s &quot;conversational dazzle&quot; found its way into his prolific written output, his writing was &quot;at best uneven [and] at worst awful&quot;. While offering &quot;brilliant insights&quot; and &quot;provocative theses&quot;, Gould&#x27;s writing is often marred by &quot;long, tortuous sentences&quot; and a &quot;false formality&quot;, Bazzana writes.

In his writing, Gould praised certain composers and rejected what he deemed banal in music composition and its consumption by the public, and also gave analyses of the music of Richard Strauss, Alban Berg and Anton Webern. Despite a certain affection for Dixieland jazz, Gould was mostly averse to popular music. He enjoyed a jazz concert with his friends as a youth, mentioned jazz in his writings, and once criticized the Beatles for &quot;bad voice leading&quot;—while praising Petula Clark and Barbra Streisand. Gould and jazz pianist Bill Evans were mutual admirers, and Evans made his record &quot;Conversations with Myself&quot; using Gould&#x27;s Steinway model CD 318 piano.

===On art===
Gould&#x27;s perspective on art is often summed up by this 1962 quotation: &quot;The justification of art is the internal combustion it ignites in the hearts of men and not its shallow, externalized, public manifestations. The purpose of art is not the release of a momentary ejection of adrenaline but is, rather, the gradual, lifelong construction of a state of wonder and serenity.&quot;

Gould repeatedly called himself &quot;the last puritan&quot;, a reference to the philosopher George Santayana&#x27;s 1935 novel of the same name. But he was progressive in many ways, promulgating the atonal composers of the early 20th century, and anticipating, through his deep involvement in the recording process, the vast changes technology had on the production and distribution of music. Mark Kingwell summarizes the paradox, never resolved by Gould nor his biographers, this way:

===Technology===
The issue of &quot;authenticity&quot; in relation to an approach like Gould&#x27;s has been greatly debated (although less so by the end of the 20th century): is a recording less authentic or &quot;direct&quot; for having been highly refined by technical means in the studio? Gould likened his process to that of a film director—one knows that a two-hour film was not made in two hours—and implicitly asked why the recording of music should be different. He went so far as to conduct an experiment with musicians, sound engineers, and laypeople in which they were to listen to a recording and determine where the splices occurred. Each group chose different points, but none was wholly successful. While the test was hardly scientific, Gould remarked, &quot;The tape does lie, and nearly always gets away with it&quot;.

In the lecture and essay &quot;Forgery and Imitation in the Creative Process&quot;, one of his most significant texts, Gould makes explicit his views on authenticity and creativity. He asks why the epoch in which a work is received influences its reception as &quot;art&quot;, postulating a sonata of his own composition that sounds so like one of Haydn&#x27;s that it is received as such. If, instead, the sonata had been attributed to an earlier or later composer, it becomes more or less interesting as a piece of music. Yet it is not the work that has changed but its relation within the accepted narrative of music history. Similarly, Gould notes the &quot;pathetic duplicity&quot; in the reception of high-quality forgeries by Han van Meegeren of new paintings attributed to the Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, before and after the forgery was known.

Gould preferred an ahistorical, or at least pre-Renaissance, view of art, minimizing the identity of the artist and the attendant historical context in evaluating the artwork: &quot;What gives us the right to assume that in the work of art we must receive a direct communication with the historical attitudes of another period? ... moreover, what makes us assume that the situation of the man who wrote it accurately or faithfully reflects the situation of his time? ... What if the composer, as historian, is faulty?&quot;

==Recordings==

===Studio===
In creating music, Gould much preferred the control and intimacy provided by the recording studio. He disliked the concert hall, which he compared to a competitive sporting arena. He gave his final public performance in 1964, and thereafter devoted his career to the studio, recording albums and several radio documentaries. He was attracted to the technical aspects of recording, and considered the manipulation of tape to be another part of the creative process. Although Gould&#x27;s recording studio producers have testified that &quot;he needed splicing less than most performers&quot;, Gould used the process to give himself total artistic control over the recording process. He recounted his recording of the A minor fugue from Book I of &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; and how it was spliced together from two takes, with the fugue&#x27;s expositions from one take and its episodes from another.

Gould&#x27;s first commercial recording (of Berg&#x27;s Piano sonata, Op. 1) came in 1953 on the short-lived Canadian Hallmark label. He soon signed with Columbia Records&#x27; classical music division and, in 1955, recorded &quot;&quot;, his breakthrough work. Although there was some controversy at Columbia about the appropriateness of this &quot;debut&quot; piece, the record received extraordinary praise and was among the best-selling classical music albums of its era. Gould became closely associated with the piece, playing it in full or in part at many recitals. A new recording of the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;, in 1981, was among his last albums; the piece was one of a few he recorded twice in the studio. The 1981 release was one of CBS Masterworks&#x27; first digital recordings. The 1955 interpretation is highly energetic and often frenetic; the later is slower and more deliberate—Gould wanted to treat the aria and its 30 variations as a cohesive whole.

Gould said Bach was &quot;first and last an architect, a constructor of sound, and what makes him so inestimably valuable to us is that he was beyond a doubt the greatest architect of sound who ever lived&quot;. He recorded most of Bach&#x27;s other keyboard works, including both books of &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; and the partitas, French Suites, English Suites, inventions and sinfonias, keyboard concertos, and a number of toccatas (which interested him least, being less polyphonic). For his only recording at the organ, he recorded some of &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;, which was also released posthumously on piano.

As for Beethoven, Gould preferred the composer&#x27;s early and late periods. He recorded all five of the piano concertos, 22 of the piano sonatas, and numerous bagatelles and variations. Gould was the first pianist to record any of Liszt&#x27;s piano transcriptions of Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies (beginning with the Fifth Symphony, in 1967, with the Sixth released in 1969).

Gould also recorded works by Brahms, Mozart, and many other prominent piano composers, though he was outspoken in his criticism of the Romantic era as a whole. He was extremely critical of Chopin. When asked whether he found himself wanting to play Chopin, he replied: &quot;No, I don&#x27;t. I play it in a weak moment—maybe once a year or twice a year for myself. But it doesn&#x27;t convince me.&quot; But in 1970, he played Chopin&#x27;s B minor sonata for the CBC and said he liked some of the miniatures and &quot;sort of liked the first movement of the B minor&quot;.

Although he recorded all of Mozart&#x27;s sonatas and admitted enjoying the &quot;actual playing&quot; of them, Gould said he disliked Mozart&#x27;s later works. He was fond of a number of lesser-known composers such as Orlando Gibbons, whose &quot;Anthems&quot; he had heard as a teenager, and whose music he felt a &quot;spiritual attachment&quot; to. He recorded a number of Gibbons&#x27;s keyboard works, and called him his favourite composer, despite his better-known admiration for Bach. He made recordings of piano music by Jean Sibelius (the Sonatines and &quot;Kyllikki&quot;), Georges Bizet (the &quot;Variations Chromatiques de Concert&quot; and the &quot;Premier nocturne&quot;), Richard Strauss (the Piano Sonata, the Five Pieces, and &quot;Enoch Arden&quot; with Claude Rains), and Hindemith (the three piano sonatas and the sonatas for brass and piano). He also made recordings of Schoenberg&#x27;s complete piano works. In early September 1982, Gould made his final recording: Strauss&#x27;s Piano Sonata in B minor.

===Collaborations===
The success of Gould&#x27;s collaborations was to a degree dependent upon his collaborators&#x27; receptiveness to his sometimes unconventional readings of the music. The musicologist Michael Stegemann considered Gould&#x27;s television collaboration with American violinist Yehudi Menuhin in 1965, in which they played works by Bach, Beethoven and Schoenberg, a success because &quot;Menuhin was ready to embrace the new perspectives opened up by an unorthodox view&quot;. But Stegemann deemed the 1966 collaboration with soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, recording Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Ophelia Lieder&quot;, an &quot;outright fiasco&quot;. Schwarzkopf believed in &quot;total fidelity&quot; to the score, and objected to the temperature:

Gould recorded Schoenberg, Hindemith, and Ernst Krenek with numerous vocalists, including Donald Gramm and Ellen Faull. He also recorded Bach&#x27;s six sonatas for violin and harpsichord (BWV 1014–1019) with Jaime Laredo, and the three sonatas for viola da gamba and keyboard with Leonard Rose. Claude Rains narrated their recording of Strauss&#x27;s melodrama &quot;Enoch Arden&quot;. Gould also collaborated with members of the New York Philharmonic, the flutist Julius Baker and the violinist Rafael Druian, in a recording of Bach&#x27;s Brandenburg Concerto No. 4, and with Leopold Stokowski and the American Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 5 in 1966.

Gould collaborated extensively with Vladimir Golschmann and the Columbia Symphony Orchestra for the Columbia Masterworks label in his recording of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 in 1958 and several works by Bach in the 1960s, including the Keyboard Concerto No. 3 (BWV 1054), the Keyboard Concerto No. 5 (BWV 1056) and the Keyboard Concerto No. 7 (BWV 1058) in 1967 and the Keyboard Concerto No. 2 in E major (BWV 1053) and the Keyboard Concerto No. 4 in A major (BWV 1055) in 1969.

===Documentaries===
Gould made numerous television and radio programs for CBC Television and CBC Radio. Notable productions include his &quot;musique concrète&quot; &quot;Solitude Trilogy&quot;, which consists of &quot;The Idea of North&quot;, a meditation on Northern Canada and its people; &quot;The Latecomers&quot;, about Newfoundland; and &quot;The Quiet in the Land&quot;, about Mennonites in Manitoba. All three use a radiophonic electronic-music technique that Gould called &quot;contrapuntal radio&quot;, in which several people are heard speaking at once—much like the voices in a fugue—manipulated through overdubbing and editing. His experience of driving across northern Ontario while listening to Top 40 radio in 1967 inspired one of his most unusual radio pieces, &quot;The Search for Petula Clark&quot;, a witty and eloquent dissertation on Clark&#x27;s recordings.

Also among Gould&#x27;s CBC programs was an educational lecture on the music of Bach, &quot;Glenn Gould On Bach&quot;, which featured a collaborative performance with Julius Baker and Oscar Shumsky of the Brandenburg Concerto No. 5.

==Transcriptions, compositions, and conducting==

Gould was also a prolific transcriber of orchestral repertoire for piano. He transcribed his own Wagner and Ravel recordings, as well as Strauss&#x27;s operas and Schubert&#x27;s and Bruckner&#x27;s symphonies, which he played privately for pleasure.

Gould dabbled in composition, with few finished works. As a teenager, he wrote chamber music and piano works in the style of the Second Viennese School. Significant works include a string quartet, which he finished in his 20s (published 1956, recorded 1960), and his cadenzas to Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1. Later works include the Lieberson Madrigal (soprano, alto, tenor, bass [SATB] and piano), and &quot;So You Want to Write a Fugue?&quot; (SATB with piano or string-quartet accompaniment). His String Quartet (Op. 1) received a mixed reaction: &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; and &quot;Saturday Review&quot; were quite laudatory, the &quot;Montreal Star&quot; less so. There is little critical commentary on Gould&#x27;s compositions because there are few of them; he never succeeded beyond Opus 1, and left a number of works unfinished. He attributed his failure as a composer to his lack of a &quot;personal voice&quot;. Most of his work is published by Schott Music. The recording &quot;Glenn Gould: The Composer&quot; contains his original works.

Towards the end of his life, Gould began conducting. He had earlier directed Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concerto No. 5&quot; and the cantata &quot;Widerstehe doch der Sünde&quot; from the harpsipiano (a piano with metal hammers to simulate a harpsichord&#x27;s sound), and Gustav Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 (the &quot;Urlicht&quot; section) in the 1960s. His first known public appearance conducting occurred in 1939 when he was six, while appearing as a pianist in a concert for the Business Men&#x27;s Bible Class in Uxbridge. By 1957 he emerged as the conductor for the CBC Television program &quot;Chrysler Festival&quot;, in which he collaborated with Maureen Forrester. In the same year he also joined forces with the CBC Vancouver Orchestra as a conductor in a radio broadcast of Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 and Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 4 (&quot;Tragic&quot;).

In 1958, Gould wrote to Golschmann of his &quot;temporary retirement&quot; from conducting, apparently as a result of the unanticipated muscular strain it created. Gould found himself &quot;practically crippled&quot; after his conducting appearances and unable to perform properly at the piano. Yet even at the age of 26, Gould continued to contemplate retiring as a piano soloist and devoting himself entirely to conducting. Immediately before his death, he was finalizing plans to appear as a conductor of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 in 1982 and in recordings of Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Hebrides Overture&quot; and Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Coriolan Overture&quot; in 1983. His last recording as a conductor was of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Siegfried Idyll&quot; in its original chamber-music scoring. He intended to spend his later years conducting, writing about music, and composing while pursuing an idyllic &quot;neoThoreauvian way of life&quot; in the countryside.

==Legacy and honours==

Gould is one of the most acclaimed musicians of the 20th century. His unique pianistic method, insight into the architecture of compositions, and relatively free interpretation of scores created performances and recordings that were revelatory to many listeners and highly objectionable to others. Philosopher Mark Kingwell wrote, &quot;his influence is made inescapable. No performer after him can avoid the example he sets ... Now, everyone must perform &quot;through&quot; him: he can be emulated or rejected, but he cannot be ignored.&quot; Among the pianists who acknowledged Gould&#x27;s influence are András Schiff, Zoltán Kocsis, Ivo Pogorelić, and Peter Serkin. Artists influenced by Gould include painter George Condo.

One of Gould&#x27;s performances of the Prelude and Fugue in C major from Book II of &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; was chosen for inclusion on the NASA Voyager Golden Record by a committee headed by Carl Sagan. The record was placed on the spacecraft &quot;Voyager 1&quot;. On 25 August 2012, the spacecraft became the first to cross the heliopause and enter the interstellar medium.

Gould is a popular subject of biography and critical analysis. Philosophers such as Kingwell and Giorgio Agamben have interpreted his life and ideas. References to Gould and his work are plentiful in poetry, fiction, and the visual arts. François Girard&#x27;s Genie Award-winning 1993 film &quot;Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould&quot; includes interviews with people who knew him, dramatizations of scenes from his life, and fanciful segments including an animation set to music. Thomas Bernhard&#x27;s 1983 novel &quot;The Loser&quot; purports to be an extended first-person essay about Gould and his lifelong friendship with two fellow students from the Mozarteum school in Salzburg, both of whom have abandoned their careers as concert pianists due to the intimidating example of Gould&#x27;s genius.

Gould left an extensive body of work beyond the keyboard. After retiring from concertising, he was increasingly interested in other media, including audio and film documentary and writing, through which he mused on aesthetics, composition, music history, and the effect of the electronic age on media consumption. (Gould grew up in Toronto at the same time that Canadian theorists Marshall McLuhan, Northrop Frye, and Harold Innis were making their mark on communications studies.) Anthologies of Gould&#x27;s writing and letters have been published, and Library and Archives Canada holds a significant portion of his papers.

In 1983, Gould was posthumously inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. He was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Toronto in 1998, and designated a National Historic Person in 2012. Both his childhood home and his longtime apartment on Saint Clair Avenue West bear Heritage Toronto plaques honouring his life, and a federal plaque was erected next to a sculpture of him in downtown Toronto. The Glenn Gould Studio at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Toronto was named after him. To commemorate what would have been Gould&#x27;s 75th birthday, the Canadian Museum of Civilization held an exhibition, &quot;Glenn Gould: The Sounds of Genius&quot;, in 2007. The multimedia exhibit was held in conjunction with Library and Archives Canada.

===Glenn Gould Foundation===

The Glenn Gould Foundation was established in Toronto in 1983 to honour Gould and keep alive his memory and life&#x27;s work. The foundation&#x27;s mission &quot;is to extend awareness of the legacy of Glenn Gould as an extraordinary musician, communicator, and Canadian, and to advance his visionary and innovative ideas into the future&quot;, and its prime activity is the triennial awarding of the Glenn Gould Prize to &quot;an individual who has earned international recognition as the result of a highly exceptional contribution to music and its communication, through the use of any communications technologies.&quot; The prize consists of and the responsibility of awarding the Glenn Gould Protégé Prize to a young musician of the winner&#x27;s choice.

===Glenn Gould School===

The Royal Conservatory of Music Professional School in Toronto adopted the name The Glenn Gould School in 1997 after its most famous alumnus.

==Awards==
Gould received many honours both during his lifetime and posthumously. He was awarded the 1969 Molson Prize, then worth C$15,000. In 1970, the Canadian government offered him the Companion of the Order of Canada, but he declined, believing himself too young.

===Juno Awards===
The Juno Awards are presented annually by the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Gould won three, accepting one in person.
===Grammy Awards===
The Grammys are awarded annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Gould won four and, as with the Junos, accepted one in person. In 1983 he was inducted posthumously into the Grammy Hall of Fame for his 1955 recording of the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;.

Wanamaker was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2001 by Queen Elizabeth II. She has received numerous accolades including a Laurence Olivier Award and nominations for three BAFTA Awards, and four Tony Awards.

A nine-time Olivier Award nominee, she won for &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; (1979) and &quot;Electra&quot; (1998). She has also received four Tony Award nominations for her work on Broadway; for &quot;Piaf&quot; (1981), &quot;Loot&quot; (1986), &quot;Electra&quot; (1999), and &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot; (2006).

She has acted in the films &quot;Wilde&quot; (1997), &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001), and &quot;My Week with Marilyn&quot; (2011). She was twice nominated for the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress, for &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; (1991) and &quot;Love Hurts&quot; (1992–1994). She portrayed Susan Harper in the sitcom &quot;My Family&quot; (2000–2011), and appeared in the ITV dramas &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; (2005–2013), &quot;Mr Selfridge&quot; (2015), and &quot;Girlfriends&quot; (2018).

==Early life and education==
Zoë Wanamaker was born in New York City on 13 May 1949, the daughter of Canadian actress and radio performer Charlotte Holland and American actor, film director, and radio producer Sam Wanamaker (born Samuel Wattenmacker). Her father was of Ukrainian-Jewish descent, although she had a secular and non-observant upbringing. The BBC series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, broadcast on 24 February 2009, revealed that her paternal grandfather Maurice Wanamaker (originally Manus Watmacher) was a tailor from Mykolaiv.

Whilst working in the United Kingdom in 1952, Wanamaker&#x27;s father found out he had been blacklisted in Hollywood. Her parents therefore decided to remain in the UK. She was educated at the independent King Alfred School in Hampstead and at Sidcot School, a Quaker boarding school in Winscombe, Somerset. Zoe attended Hornsey College of Art for the Pre-Diploma Course before she trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama.

==Career==
===Stage===
Wanamaker&#x27;s career started in the theatre. From 1976 to 1984 she was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. She won an Olivier Award for her 1979 performance in &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; and a second for Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Electra&quot; in 1998. In 1985, she played Verdi&#x27;s wife Giuseppina Strepponi in the original production of &quot;After Aida&quot;. She appeared on stage playing the part of Beatrice opposite Simon Russell Beale as Benedick in the National Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. She has received Tony Award nominations for her performances in &quot;Piaf&quot;, &quot;Loot&quot;, &quot;Electra&quot;, and &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot;.

In 1997, Wanamaker was the first person to speak on the stage of the newly completed replica theatre, Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe, on London&#x27;s South Bank. This was in recognition of the role played by her father in founding the new theatre. She subsequently became Honorary President of the Globe.

From May to October 2010, Wanamaker appeared in Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;All My Sons&quot; as Kate Keller at the Apollo Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue in London.

Wanamaker appeared in Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;All On Her Own&quot; from 24 October 2015 until 13 January 2016 at the Garrick Theatre. The work is a one-woman play that preceded Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;Harlequinade&quot;, which she also appeared in, each night as part of a never-before-seen double bill. In 2016 she appeared in the world premiere production of &quot;Elegy&quot; at the Donmar Warehouse.

She returned to the Broadway stage in the 2023 Sharr White memory play &quot;Pictures From Home&quot; alongside Nathan Lane and Danny Burstein. The play is adapted from photographer Larry Sultan&#x27;s photo memoir of the same name.

===Screen===
Starting in the early 1980s, Wanamaker began performing on screen, most notably in a number of critically acclaimed television productions, such as the BBC Television production &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;; she was nominated for a BAFTA Award for her portrayal of the love interest of a suspected serial killer in the first instalment of the Granada series &quot;Prime Suspect&quot;.

Television series have included &quot;Paradise Postponed&quot; (as Charlotte Fanner-Titmuuss, 1986) and &quot;Love Hurts&quot; (1992–94) with Adam Faith. She appeared with Wendy Hiller in &quot;The Countess Alice&quot; in 1992, playing a rebellious woman searching for the truth about her past in war-torn Germany. She played Clarice, one of the dim-witted twin sisters of Lord Groan in &quot;Gormenghast&quot; (2000), a BBC television adaptation of Mervyn Peake&#x27;s trilogy. She played Madam Hooch in the film &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001). She did not reprise the role in the rest of the sequels, accusing the producers of underpaying their actors.

Wanamaker portrayed Susan Harper in the BBC situation comedy &quot;My Family&quot; from 2000 to 2011. She voiced a CGI character named Lady Cassandra in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The End of the World&quot; (2005), and reprised the role (also appearing in the flesh this time) in the episode &quot;New Earth&quot; (2006). Wanamaker lent her voice to the 2008 Xbox 360 game &quot;Fable II&quot; as the blind Seeress Theresa, who guides the playing character throughout the game. She returned to voice Theresa again in &quot;Fable III&quot; in 2010, and again in 2012 for &quot;&quot;.

She played Ariadne Oliver in six episodes of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;. In 2011, she played Paula Strasberg in Simon Curtis&#x27; &quot;My Week with Marilyn&quot;, which depicts the making of the 1957 film &quot;The Prince and the Showgirl&quot; starring Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier. In 2015, she joined the cast of &quot;Mr. Selfridge&quot; as Princess Marie, the Russian mother-in-law of Rosalie Selfridge/Bolotoff. In 2021, she played Baghra, Alina Starkov&#x27;s strict teacher and knowing adviser in &quot;Shadow and Bone&quot;.

==Honours==
Wanamaker was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2001 New Year Honours for services to drama. She also received an honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of East Anglia on 19 July 2012.

==Public advocacy==
Wanamaker has been a Patron of the UK charity Tree Aid, since 1997. Tree Aid enables communities in Africa&#x27;s drylands to fight poverty and become self-reliant, while improving the environment. In 2006 Wanamaker recorded a successful Radio 4 appeal for the charity.

She is a patron of Dignity in Dying, the Lymphoedema Support Network, Youth Music Theatre UK and of the Young Actors&#x27; Theatre, Islington. She is also one of the Honorary Patrons of the London children&#x27;s charity Scene &amp; Heard. Wanamaker also supports Survival International&#x27;s campaign to save the threatened native tribes in Brazil.

In August 2014, Wanamaker was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

Wanamaker is one of nine presidents of Better Planet Education.

==Personal life==
Wanamaker lived for many years with fellow Royal Shakespeare Company actor David Lyon. In November 1994, she married the Scottish actor, playwright and screenwriter Gawn Grainger. Wanamaker holds both British and American citizenship, having become a British citizen in 2000.

<text>Robert Rick McCammon (born July 17, 1952) is an American novelist from Birmingham, Alabama. One of the influential names in the late 1970s–early 1990s American horror literature boom, by 1991 McCammon had three &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers (&quot;The Wolf&#x27;s Hour&quot;, &quot;Stinger&quot;, and &quot;Swan Song&quot;) and around 5 million books in print. Since 2002, he&#x27;s written ten books in a historical mystery series featuring an 18th-century magistrate’s clerk, Matthew Corbett, as he unravels mysteries in colonial America.

==Personal life==
His parents are Jack, a musician, and Barbara Bundy McCammon. After his parents&#x27; divorce, McCammon lived with his grandparents in Birmingham. He received a B.A. in Journalism from the University of Alabama in 1974. McCammon lives in Birmingham. He has a daughter, Skye, with his former wife, Sally Sanders.

==Career==
McCammon has published multiple award-winning books, including &quot;Mine&quot; in 1990 and &quot;Boy&#x27;s Life&quot; in 1991. After the release of&quot; Gone South&quot;, McCammon chose to leave his publisher. After clashing with an editor at a new publisher over the direction for his historical fiction novel &quot;Speaks the Nightbird&quot;, he retired from writing. After a long hiatus which resulted from the reorganization of the publishing industry and McCammon&#x27;s personal depression and soul searching, he returned to the publishing world with &quot;Speaks the Nightbird&quot;, the first book in the Matthew Corbett series. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called it a &quot;compulsively readable yarn,&quot; and said, &quot;McCammon&#x27;s loyal fans will find his resurfacing reason to rejoice.&quot; Since 2002, seventeen new books have been published, including the ten books in the Matthew Corbett series.

In 1985, McCammon&#x27;s story &quot;Nightcrawlers&quot; was adapted into an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (1985).

After years out-of-print, &quot;Baal&quot;, &quot;Bethany&#x27;s Sin&quot;, &quot;The Night Boat&quot;, and &quot;They Thirst&quot; were re-released by Subterranean Press as limited edition novels. In a 2013 interview, McCammon acknowledged that some readers would like to have a complete collection of his work, and said &quot;reading back over those books I find they’re not as poorly written as I recall them to be.&quot;

<doc id="65448" wikidata="Q1136406" url="?curid=65448" title="Invisible ink">
<text>Invisible ink, also known as security ink or sympathetic ink, is a substance used for writing, which is invisible either on application or soon thereafter, and can later be made visible by some means, such as heat or ultraviolet light. Invisible ink is one form of steganography.

==History==
One of the earliest writers to mention an invisible ink is Aeneas Tacticus, in the 4th century BC. He mentions it in discussing how to survive under siege but does not indicate the type of ink to be used. This was part of his list of the 20 different methods of secret communications in a book called &quot;On the Defense of Fortifications&quot;. One of the techniques that involved steganography involved puncturing a tiny hole above or below letters in a document to spell out a secret message. This did not include an invisible ink but the Germans improved on the method during World War I and World War II. They used invisible ink and microdots instead of pinpricks.

Philo of Byzantium may be the first writer known to describe an invisible ink using a reagent around 217218 BC, with oak galls and vitriol. These ingredients were used to make oak gall ink. People soon discovered that they could write invisibly with one of the ingredients and then cause the writing to appear by adding the other. Pliny the Elder and the Roman poet Ovid gave advice on the use of plant juices and milk to write secret messages.

Lemons were also used as organic inks by Arabs around 600AD, and during the 16th century in Europe.

Giovanni Battista della Porta is credited with the first recipe for a sympathetic ink, derived from alum and vinegar, as well as the first book on secret writing and invisible inks, (1558, 1589). Since then, a wide variety of invisible inks have been used for all sorts of secretive purposes. A formula similar to oak gall ink was created by James Jay and used by George Washington and the Culper Spy Ring during the American Revolution and lemon juice was used by the &#x27;Lemon Juice Spies&#x27; (Carl Muller and four other Germans, who all died for their efforts either by suicide or execution, along with John Hahn, an English baker) during World War I. In World War II, neutral or acidic solutions of phenolphthalein, a chemical compound extracted from pills for constipation, were used as invisible ink. It is colorless but turns pink when exposed to alkali such as ammonia and bicarbonate soda.

== General application and use ==

Invisible ink can be applied to a writing surface with a specialty purpose stylus, stamp, fountain pen, toothpick, calligraphy pen, Cotton swab, or even a finger dipped in the liquid. Once dry, the written surface looks as if it were blank, with a similar texture and reflectivity as the surrounding surface.

The ink can be later made visible by different methods according to the type of invisible ink used. The ink may be revealed by heat or by application of an appropriate chemical, or it may be made visible by viewing under ultraviolet light. Inks which are developed by a chemical reaction may depend on an acid-base reaction (like litmus paper), reactions similar to the blueprint process, or any of hundreds of others. Developer fluids may be applied using a spray bottle, but some developers are in the form of vapor, e.g. ammonia fumes used to develop phenolphthalein ink.

There are also toy invisible ink pens which have two tips—one tip for invisible ink writing, and another tip for developing the ink. Invisible ink is sometimes used to print parts of pictures or text in books for children to play with, always including a &quot;decoder pen&quot; which is used to show the invisible parts of texts or pictures, thus revealing answers to questions printed in regular ink or completing missing parts of pictures.
Security marker pens or UV markers with fluorescent ink that glows when illuminated with a UV light is often used to invisibly mark valuable household items in case of burglary. There are specialty security maker pens formulated for writing on non-porous surfaces such as glass, plastic, metal, etc. The mark can be read by using a blacklight or other UV light source. Security marker pens can be obtained commercially and are widely used as a crime countermeasure.

Some commercially available invisible inks glow very brightly, in a variety of colors, under ultraviolet light. This makes them suitable for use in readmission such as hand stamping.

There are some invisible ink types that can only be invisible when applied to certain types of surfaces, but are still visible on others.

Some vendors now offer invisible ink for use in computer inkjet printers. Such inks are usually visible under ultraviolet light. Typical uses include printing information on business forms for use by the form processor, without cluttering up the visible contents of the form. For example, some United States Postal Service mail sorting stations use UV-visible ink to print bar codes on mailed envelopes giving routing information for use by mail handling equipment further down the line before delivery.

An E2E voting system called Scantegrity II uses invisible ink to enable the voter to obtain a confirmation code only for the voted selection.

== Properties of an &quot;ideal&quot; invisible ink ==

What an &quot;ideal&quot; invisible ink is depends on its intended use. For example, property marking should ideally be done with ink easily read under ultraviolet light, whereas in espionage such an ink would be considered too easily detectable since a large number of letters may be screened relatively quickly using UV light.

Invisible inks are inherently &quot;insecure&quot; against a determined and well-equipped inspector, which must be balanced against the logistical difficulty in carrying out mass-screening of posted mail. It is easier to perform large-scale undetected screening of millions of electronic communications, than to mass-screen even a small fraction of conventional mail. Apart from in dictatorships where large numbers of personnel are employed to spy on fellow nationals, screening of posted mail is only feasible in particular situations, such as letters to and from a particular suspect or facility.

The British SOE training manual used in the Second World War identified the following properties of an &quot;ideal&quot; invisible ink:

# Mixes with water.
# Non-volatile, i.e. no pronounced smell.
# Not depositing crystals on paper, i.e. not easily seen in glancing light.
# Invisible under ultraviolet light.
# Does not decompose or discolor the paper e.g. silver nitrate.
# Nonreactive with iodine, or with any of the other usual developers.
# Potential developers for the ink should be as few as possible.
# Should not develop under heat.
# Easily obtainable and has at least one plausible innocent use by the holder.
# Not a compound of several chemicals, as this would violate .

From practical experience &quot;6&quot; and &quot;9&quot; were usually incompatible. SOE agents were trained not to risk their lives through reliance on insecure inks, most of which were from World War I. In general, SOE used invisible inks as a back-up method of communication when other, more secure communication techniques were unavailable. The agency was known to supply special inks to its field agents, rather than have them depend upon improvisation from obtainable everyday chemicals. When agents were forced to improvise, they were advised to dilute their invisible ink as much as possible to reduce chances of detection.

== Screening letters for secret messages ==

Any invisible ink can be made visible by someone who is sufficiently determined, but the limitation is generally time available and the fact that one cannot apply hours of effort to every single piece of paper. Thus successful use of invisible ink depends on not arousing suspicion that invisible ink may be present.

Telltale signs of invisible ink, such as pen scratches from a sharp pen, roughness, or changed reflectivity of the paper (either more dull or more shiny, usually from using undiluted ink), can be obvious to a careful observer who simply makes use of strong light, a magnifying glass and their nose. Also, key words in the visible letter, such as &quot;heat&quot; or any other odd code name, in an out of place context may alert a censor to the presence of invisible ink. Invisible ink is not effective with glossy or very smooth paper types, since the sizing of these papers prevents ink from being absorbed deep into the paper and it is easily visible, especially if the paper is examined under glancing light. There are, however, commercially available inks for non-porous surfaces that are only visible under ultraviolet light and are otherwise virtually invisible on such surfaces.

Using either ultraviolet light or an iodine fume cupboard, messages can be quickly screened for invisible ink and also read without first permanently developing the invisible ink. Thus, if a censor uses this method to intercept messages, the letter may then be sent to the intended recipient, who will be unaware that the secret message has already been intercepted by a third party.

A &quot;screening station&quot; theoretically could involve visual and olfactory inspection, an examination under ultraviolet light and then the heating of all objects in an oven before finally trying exposure to iodine fumes to produce optimal security in optimal time.

== Invisible ink types ==

For practical reasons, the inks are listed here according to their method of development. It must be understood however that some inks – particularly those of organic origin or those consisting of a mixture of several chemicals – may be made visible by several methods. For example, invisible writing with soap water may be made visible either by heat, reaction with phenolphthalein, viewing under ultraviolet light, or by placing the page inside an iodine fume cupboard.

=== Inks developed by heat ===
Some of these are organic substances that oxidize when heated, which usually turns them brown. For this type of &quot;heat fixed&quot; ink, any acidic fluid will work. The most secure way to use any of the following substances for invisible ink is by dilution, usually with water, close to the point when they become difficult to develop.

* Cola drink
* Honey solution, sugar (sugar turns into caramel by dehydration)
* Lemon, apple, orange or onion juice (organic acids and the paper forms ester under heat)
* Milk (lactose dehydrates)
* Bodily fluids such as blood serum.
* Soap solution (carboxylic partially oxidizes)
* Wine, or vinegar
* Cobalt chloride, which turns blue when heated and becomes invisible again after a while (if not overly heated)

The writing is rendered visible by heating the paper, either on a radiator, by ironing it, using a hair dryer, or by placing it in an oven. A 100-watt light bulb is less likely to damage the paper.

=== Inks developed by chemical reaction ===

In most cases, these substance changes color when mixed with an acid or base.

* Phenolphthalein, commonly used as a pH indicator, turns pink in the presence of a base such as ammonia fumes or sodium carbonate.
* Vinegar, is revealed by red cabbage water Vinegar contains acetic acid that affects the pH indicator in red cabbage water. Vinegar may also be developed by heat.
* Ammonia, developed by red cabbage water.
* Semen, developed .
* Copper sulfate, developed by sodium iodide, sodium carbonate, ammonium hydroxide or potassium ferricyanide.
* Lead(II) nitrate, developed by sodium iodide.
* Iron(II) sulfate, developed by sodium carbonate or potassium ferricyanate.
* Cobalt(II) chloride, developed by potassium ferricyanide.
* Iron(III) sulfate, developed by sodium sulfide.
* Starch, developed by iodine solution which turns starch dark blue and the paper light blue.
* Lemon juice, developed by iodine solution (ink turns white, paper turns light blue).
* Sodium chloride (common table salt), developed by silver nitrate.
* Cerium oxalate developed by manganese sulfate and hydrogen peroxide

=== Inks visible under ultraviolet light ===

Some inks glow faintly (fluoresce) when under an ultraviolet lamp. This is a property of many substances, particularly organic substances and body fluids.

Other inks work in a near opposite way by ultraviolet light but without fluorescing. When these are used on fluorescent paper, the inked areas fluoresce less than the surrounding paper area when under an ultraviolet lamp. This is especially a property of inks with a yellow tint.

Some UV-visible inks may be detected on a photocopy, due to the relatively strong ultraviolet component in light from the photocopier scanning head.

Examples of inks revealed by ultraviolet light are:

* Laundry detergents containing optical brighteners
* Soap
* Body fluids, serum, saliva
* Sunscreen
* Lemon juice

=== Inks which alter the surface of paper ===

This includes virtually all invisible inks, but pure distilled water can also be used in this way. Application of any fluid will alter the paper surface fibers or sizing.

Fumes created from heating iodine crystals will develop the writing, which will appear brown because the iodine sticks preferentially to the altered areas of the paper. Exposing the paper to strong sunlight will return the writing to its invisible state, as will using a bleach solution.

Slightly dampening paper with a sponge or by steam and then drying it before writing a message will prevent writing from being developed by this method, but overdoing dampening will result in telltale paper cockling.

== Modern usage ==
Former MI6 agent Richard Tomlinson stated that Pentel Rolling Writer rollerball pens were extensively used by MI-6 agents to produce secret writing in the form of invisible messages while on missions.

In 2002, a gang was indicted for spreading a riot between federal penitentiaries using coded telephone messages, and messages in invisible ink.

=== United States declassification of invisible ink recipes ===

In 1995, President Clinton issued an executive order requesting that all agencies declassify information 25 years or older by the year 2000. Six World War I documents referencing the recipes for invisible ink were due to be declassified under this order, including:

* &quot;Secret Inks&quot;
* &quot;Detection of Secret Ink&quot;
* &quot;German Secret Ink Formula&quot;
* &quot;Pamphlet on Invisible Photography and Writing&quot;

In 1999, however, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) successfully exempted these documents, arguing that the recipes provided the basis for more advanced formulas still in use at the time. This exemption made the recipes for invisible ink the oldest classified documents held by the National Archives until their declassification in 2011. At this time, the CIA no longer considered the documents sensitive due to recent advancements in technology.

=== Invisible ink in art===

Invisible ink is not commonly used in art. Some artists, however, have incorporated invisible ink into their work, either alone or in conjunction with more conventional media.

Jean-Michel Basquiat is known to have worked with invisible ink. In 2012, Sotheby&#x27;s London discovered Basquiat&#x27;s signature painted in invisible ink on the 1982 work, &quot;Orange Sports Figure&quot;. In 2018, analysis by an art conservator revealed invisible ink markings on an untitled Basquiat painting from 1981.

In 2012, the Hayward Gallery exhibition, &quot;Invisible: Art about the Unseen, 1957-2012&quot;, included the 1989 work, &quot;Magic Ink&quot;, by Gianni Motti. It consisted of two drawings created with undeveloped invisible ink.

In 2015, Aowen Jin exhibited artwork drawn in invisible ink at the Horniman Museum in London. The illustrations, drawn on the walls and floor of the Music Gallery Performance Space, were only visible under UV light.
== Disappearing inks ==

Inks that are visible for a period of time without the intention of being made visible again are called disappearing inks. Disappearing inks typically rely on the chemical reaction between thymolphthalein and a basic substance such as sodium hydroxide. Thymolphthalein, which is normally colorless, turns blue in solution with the base. As the base reacts with carbon dioxide (always present in the air), the pH drops below 10.5 and the color disappears. Pens are now also available that can be erased simply by swiping a special pen over the original text. Disappearing inks have been used in gag squirtguns, for limited-time secret messages, for security reasons on non-reusable passes, for fraudulent purposes, and for dress-making and other crafts where measurement marks are required to disappear.

<doc id="65450" wikidata="Q169226" url="?curid=65450" title="Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band">
<text>Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band (often referred to simply as Sgt. Pepper) is the eighth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. Released on 26May 1967, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is regarded by musicologists as an early concept album that advanced the roles of sound composition, extended form, psychedelic imagery, record sleeves, and the producer in popular music. The album had an immediate cross-generational impact and was associated with numerous touchstones of the era&#x27;s youth culture, such as fashion, drugs, mysticism, and a sense of optimism and empowerment. Critics lauded the album for its innovations in songwriting, production and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for reflecting the interests of contemporary youth and the counterculture.

At the end of August 1966, the Beatles had permanently retired from touring and pursued individual interests for the next three months. During a return flight to London in November, Paul McCartney had an idea for a song involving an Edwardian military band that formed the impetus of the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; concept. For this project, they continued the technological experimentation marked by their previous album, &quot;Revolver&quot; (1966), this time without an absolute deadline for completion. Sessions began on 24November at EMI Studios with compositions inspired by the Beatles&#x27; youth, but after pressure from EMI, the songs &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; were released as a double A-side single in February 1967 and left off the LP. The album was then loosely conceptualised as a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band, an idea that was conceived after recording the title track. 

A landmark work of British psychedelia, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is considered one of the first art rock LPs and a progenitor to progressive rock. It incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including vaudeville, circus, music hall, avant-garde, and Western and Indian classical music. With assistance from producer George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick, many of the recordings were coloured with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified on &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot; and &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. Recording was completed on 21April. The cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a tableau of celebrities and historical figures, was designed by the pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth.

&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;″s release was a defining moment in pop culture, heralding the album era and the 1967 Summer of Love, while its reception achieved full cultural legitimisation for popular music and recognition for the medium as a genuine art form. The first Beatles album to be released with the same track listing in both the UK and the US, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart in the United Kingdom and 15 weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart in the United States. In 1968, it won four Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, the first rock LP to receive this honour; in 2003, it was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. It has topped several critics&#x27; and listeners&#x27; polls for the best album of all time, including those published by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and in the book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, and the UK&#x27;s &quot;Music of the Millennium&quot; poll. More than 32 million copies had been sold worldwide as of 2011. It remains one of the best-selling albums of all time and was, as of 2018, the UK&#x27;s best-selling studio album. A remixed and expanded edition of the album was released in 2017.
== Background ==
By late 1965, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. In John Lennon&#x27;s opinion, they could &quot;send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They&#x27;re just bloody tribal rites.&quot; In June 1966, two days after finishing the album &quot;Revolver&quot;, the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: &quot;Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.&quot; The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan&#x27;s religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles&#x27; planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary.

The publication in the US of Lennon&#x27;s remarks about the Beatles being &quot;more popular than Jesus&quot; then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America&#x27;s Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group&#x27;s record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes:

On the Beatles&#x27; return to England, rumours began to circulate that they had decided to break up. George Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band, but he was persuaded to stay on the assurance that there would be no more tours. The group took a three-month break, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy. Having been the last of the Beatles to concede that their live performances had become futile, Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film &quot;The Family Way&quot; and holidayed in Kenya with Mal Evans, one of the Beatles&#x27; tour managers. Lennon acted in the film &quot;How I Won the War&quot; and attended art showings, such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono. Ringo Starr used the break to spend time with his wife Maureen and son Zak.

== Inspiration and conception ==
While in London without his bandmates, McCartney took the hallucinogenic drug LSD (or &quot;acid&quot;) for the first time, having long resisted Lennon and Harrison&#x27;s insistence that he join them and Starr in experiencing its perception-heightening effects. According to author Jonathan Gould, this initiation into LSD afforded McCartney the &quot;expansive new sense of possibility&quot; that defined the group&#x27;s next project, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Gould adds that McCartney&#x27;s succumbing to peer pressure allowed Lennon &quot;to play the role of psychedelic guide&quot; to his songwriting partner, thereby facilitating a closer collaboration between the two than had been evident since early in the Beatles&#x27; career. For his part, Lennon had turned deeply introspective during the filming of &quot;How I Won the War&quot; in southern Spain in September 1966. His anxiety over his and the Beatles&#x27; future was reflected in &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, a song that provided the initial theme, regarding a Liverpool childhood, of the new album. On his return to London, Lennon embraced the city&#x27;s arts culture, of which McCartney was a part, and shared his bandmate&#x27;s interest in avant-garde and electronic-music composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, John Cage and Luciano Berio.

In November, during his and Evans&#x27; return flight from Kenya, McCartney had an idea for a song that eventually formed the impetus of the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; concept. His idea involved an Edwardian-era military band, for which Evans invented a name in the style of contemporary San Francisco-based groups such as Big Brother and the Holding Company and Quicksilver Messenger Service. In February 1967, McCartney suggested that the new album should represent a performance by the fictional band. This alter ego group would give them the freedom to experiment musically by releasing them from their image as Beatles. Martin recalled that the concept was not discussed at the start of the sessions, but it subsequently gave the album &quot;a life of its own&quot;.

Portions of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; reflect the Beatles&#x27; general immersion in the blues, Motown and other American popular musical traditions. The author Ian MacDonald writes that when reviewing their rivals&#x27; recent work in late 1966, the Beatles identified the most significant LP as the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, which Brian Wilson, the band&#x27;s leader, had created in response to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. McCartney was highly impressed with the &quot;harmonic structures&quot; and choice of instruments used on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, and said that these elements encouraged him to think the Beatles could &quot;get further out&quot; than the Beach Boys had. He identified &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; as his main musical inspiration for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, adding that &quot;[we] nicked a few ideas&quot;, although he felt it lacked the avant-garde quality he was seeking. &quot;Freak Out!&quot; by the Mothers of Invention has also been cited as having influenced &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. According to the biographer Philip Norman, during the recording sessions McCartney repeatedly stated: &quot;This is our &quot;Freak Out!&quot;&quot; The music journalist Chet Flippo stated that McCartney was inspired to record a concept album after hearing &quot;Freak Out!&quot;

Indian music was another touchstone on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, principally for Lennon and Harrison. In a 1967 interview, Harrison said that the Beatles&#x27; ongoing success had encouraged them to continue developing musically and that, given their standing, &quot;We can do things that please us without conforming to the standard pop idea. We are not only involved in pop music, but all music.&quot; McCartney envisioned the Beatles&#x27; alter egos being able to &quot;do a bit of B. B. King, a bit of Stockhausen, a bit of Albert Ayler, a bit of Ravi Shankar, a bit of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, a bit of the Doors&quot;. He saw the group as &quot;pushing frontiers&quot; similar to other composers of the time, even though the Beatles did not &quot;necessarily like what, say, Berio was doing&quot;.

== Recording and production ==
===Recording history===
Sessions began on 24 November 1966 in Studio Two at EMI Studios (subsequently Abbey Road Studios), marking the first time that the Beatles had come together since September. Afforded the luxury of a nearly limitless recording budget, and with no absolute deadline for completion, the band booked open-ended sessions that started at 7 pm and allowed them to work as late as they wanted. They began with &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, followed by two other songs that were thematically linked to their childhoods: &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot;, the first session for which took place on 6 December, and &quot;Penny Lane&quot;.

&quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; were subsequently released as a double A-side in February 1967 after EMI and Epstein pressured Martin for a single. When it failed to reach number one in the UK, British press agencies speculated that the group&#x27;s run of success might have ended, with headlines such as &quot;Beatles Fail to Reach the Top&quot;, &quot;First Time in Four Years&quot; and &quot;Has the Bubble Burst?&quot; In keeping with the band&#x27;s approach to their previously issued singles, the songs were then excluded from &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Martin later described the decision to drop these two songs as &quot;the biggest mistake of my professional life&quot;. In his judgment, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, which he and the band spent an unprecedented 55 hours of studio time recording, &quot;set the agenda for the whole album&quot;. He explained: &quot;It was going to be a record ... [with songs that] couldn&#x27;t be performed live: they were designed to be studio productions and that was the difference.&quot; McCartney declared: &quot;Now our performance that record.&quot;
According to the musicologist Walter Everett, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; marks the beginning of McCartney&#x27;s ascendancy as the Beatles&#x27; dominant creative force. He wrote more than half of the album&#x27;s material while asserting increasing control over the recording of his compositions. In an effort to get the right sound, the Beatles attempted numerous re-takes of McCartney&#x27;s song &quot;Getting Better&quot;. When the decision was made to re-record the basic track, Starr was summoned to the studio, but called off soon afterwards as the focus switched from rhythm to vocal tracking. Much of the bass guitar on the album was mixed upfront. Preferring to overdub his bass part last, McCartney tended to play other instruments when recording a song&#x27;s backing track. This approach afforded him the time to devise bass lines that were melodically adventurous – one of the qualities he especially admired in Wilson&#x27;s work on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; – and complemented the song&#x27;s final arrangement. McCartney played keyboard instruments such as piano, grand piano and Lowrey organ, in addition to electric guitar on some songs, while Martin variously contributed on Hohner Pianet, harpsichord and harmonium. Lennon&#x27;s songs similarly showed a preference for keyboard instruments.
Although Harrison&#x27;s role as lead guitarist was limited during the sessions, Everett considers that &quot;his contribution to the album is strong in several ways.&quot; He provided Indian instrumentation in the form of sitar, tambura and swarmandal, and Martin credited him with being the most committed of the Beatles in striving for new sounds. Starr&#x27;s adoption of loose calfskin heads for his tom-toms ensured his drum kit had a deeper timbre than he had previously achieved with plastic heads. As on &quot;Revolver&quot;, the Beatles increasingly used session musicians, particularly for classical-inspired arrangements. Norman comments that Lennon&#x27;s prominent vocal on some of McCartney&#x27;s songs &quot;hugely enhanced their atmosphere&quot;, particularly &quot;Lovely Rita&quot;.

Within an hour of completing the last overdubs on the album&#x27;s songs, on 20 April 1967, the group returned to Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Only a Northern Song&quot;, the basic track of which they had taped in February. The Beatles overdubbed random sounds and instrumentation before submitting it as the first of four new songs they were contracted to supply to United Artists for inclusion in the animated film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. In author Mark Lewisohn&#x27;s description, it was a &quot;curious&quot; session, but one that demonstrated the Beatles&#x27; &quot;tremendous appetite for recording&quot;. During the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; sessions, the band also recorded &quot;Carnival of Light&quot;, a McCartney-led experimental piece created for the Million Volt Light and Sound Rave, held at the Roundhouse Theatre on 28 January and 4 February. The album was completed on 21 April with the recording of random noises and voices that were included on the run-out groove, preceded by a high-pitched tone that could be heard by dogs but was inaudible to most human ears.

===Studio ambience and happenings===
The Beatles sought to inject an atmosphere of celebration into the recording sessions. Weary of the bland look inside EMI, they introduced psychedelic lighting to the studio space, including a device on which five red fluorescent tubes were fixed to a microphone stand, a lava lamp, a red darkroom lamp, and a stroboscope, the last of which they soon abandoned. Harrison later said the studio became the band&#x27;s clubhouse for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;; David Crosby, Mick Jagger and Donovan were among the musician friends who visited them there. The band members also dressed up in psychedelic fashions, leading one session trumpeter to wonder whether they were in costume for a new film. Drug-taking was prevalent during the sessions, with Martin later recalling that the group would steal away to &quot;have something&quot;.

The 10 February session for orchestral overdubs on &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; was staged as a happening typical of the London avant-garde scene. The Beatles invited numerous friends and the session players wore formal dinner-wear augmented with fancy-dress props. Overseen by NEMS employee Tony Bramwell, the proceedings were filmed on seven handheld cameras, with the band doing some of the filming. Following this event, the group considered making a television special based on the album. Each of the songs was to be represented with a clip directed by a different director, but the cost of recording &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; made the idea prohibitive to EMI. For the 15 March session for &quot;Within You Without You&quot;, Studio Two was transformed with Indian carpets placed on the walls, dimmed lighting and burning incense to evoke the requisite Indian mood. Lennon described the session as a &quot;great swinging evening&quot; with &quot;400 Indian fellas&quot; among the guests.

The Beatles took an acetate disc of the completed album to the flat of American singer Cass Elliot, off King&#x27;s Road in Chelsea. There, at six in the morning, they played it at full volume with speakers set in open window frames. The group&#x27;s friend and former press agent, Derek Taylor, remembered that residents of the neighbourhood opened their windows and listened without complaint to what they understood to be unreleased Beatles music.

===Technical aspects===
In his book on ambient music, &quot;The Ambient Century&quot;, Mark Prendergast views &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as the Beatles&#x27; &quot;homage&quot; to Stockhausen and Cage, adding that its &quot;rich, tape-manipulated sound&quot; shows the influence of electronic and experimental composer Pierre Schaeffer. Martin recalled that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; &quot;grew naturally out of &quot;Revolver&quot;&quot;, marking &quot;an era of almost continuous technological experimentation&quot;. The album was recorded using four-track equipment, since eight-track tape recorders were not operational in commercial studios in London until late 1967. As with previous Beatles albums, the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; recordings made extensive use of reduction mixing, a technique in which one to four tracks from one recorder are mixed and dubbed down onto a master four-track machine, enabling the engineers to give the group a virtual multitrack studio. EMI&#x27;s Studer J37 four-track machines were well suited to reduction mixing, as the high quality of the recordings that they produced minimised the increased noise associated with the process. When recording the orchestra for &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, Martin synchronised a four-track recorder playing the Beatles&#x27; backing track to another one taping the orchestral overdub. The engineer Ken Townsend devised a method for accomplishing this by using a 50 Hz control signal between the two machines.

The production on &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; was especially complex, involving the innovative splicing of two takes that were recorded in different tempos and pitches. Emerick remembers that during the recording of &quot;Revolver&quot;, &quot;we had got used to being asked to do the impossible, and we knew that the word &#x27;no&#x27; didn&#x27;t exist in the Beatles&#x27; vocabulary.&quot; A key feature of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is Martin and Emerick&#x27;s liberal use of signal processing to shape the sound of the recording, which included the application of dynamic range compression, reverb and signal limiting. Relatively new modular effects units were used, such as running voices and instruments through a Leslie speaker. Several innovative production techniques feature prominently on the recordings, including direct injection, pitch control and ambiophonics. The bass part on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; was the first example of the Beatles recording via direct injection (DI), which Townsend devised as a method for plugging electric guitars directly into the recording console. In Kenneth Womack&#x27;s opinion, the use of DI on the album&#x27;s title track &quot;afforded McCartney&#x27;s bass with richer textures and tonal clarity&quot;.

Some of the mixing employed automatic double tracking (ADT), a system that uses tape recorders to create a simultaneous doubling of a sound. ADT was invented by Townsend during the &quot;Revolver&quot; sessions in 1966 especially for the Beatles, who regularly expressed a desire for a technical alternative to having to record doubled lead vocals. Another important effect was varispeeding, a technique that the Beatles used extensively on &quot;Revolver&quot;. Martin cites &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; as having the most variations of tape speed on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. During the recording of Lennon&#x27;s vocals, the tape speed was reduced from 50 cycles per second to 45, which produced a higher and thinner-sounding track when played back at the normal speed. For the album&#x27;s title track, the recording of Starr&#x27;s drum kit was enhanced by the use of damping and close-miking. MacDonald credits the new recording technique with creating a &quot;three-dimensional&quot; sound that, along with other Beatles innovations, engineers in the US would soon adopt as standard practice.

Artistic experimentation, such as the placement of random gibberish in the run-out groove, became one of the album&#x27;s defining features. &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was the first pop album to be mastered without the momentary gaps that are typically placed between tracks as a point of demarcation. It made use of two crossfades that blended songs together, giving the impression of a continuous live performance. Although both stereo and monaural mixes of the album were prepared, the Beatles were minimally involved in what they regarded as the less important stereo mix sessions, leaving the task to Martin and Emerick. Emerick recalls: &quot;We spent three weeks on the mono mixes and maybe three days on the stereo.&quot; Most listeners ultimately heard only the stereo version. He estimates that the group spent 700 hours on the LP, more than 30 times that of the first Beatles album, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, which cost £400 to produce. The final cost of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was approximately £25,000 ().

===Band dynamics===

Author Robert Rodriguez writes that while Lennon, Harrison and Starr embraced the creative freedom afforded by McCartney&#x27;s band-within-a-band idea, they &quot;went along with the concept with varying degrees of enthusiasm&quot;. Studio personnel recalled that Lennon had &quot;never seemed so happy&quot; as during the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; sessions. In a 1969 interview with Barry Miles, however, Lennon said he was depressed and that while McCartney was &quot;full of confidence&quot;, he was &quot;going through murder&quot;. Lennon explained his view of the album&#x27;s concept: &quot;Paul said, &#x27;Come and see the show&#x27;, I didn&#x27;t. I said, &#x27;I read the news today, oh boy.

Everett describes Starr as having been &quot;largely bored&quot; during the sessions, with the drummer later lamenting: &quot;The biggest memory I have of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; ... is I learned to play chess&quot;. In &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;, Harrison said he had little interest in McCartney&#x27;s concept of a fictitious group and that, after his experiences in India, &quot;my heart was still out there... I was losing interest in being &#x27;fab&#x27; at that point.&quot; Harrison added that, having enjoyed recording &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot;, he disliked how the group&#x27;s approach on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; became &quot;an assembly process&quot; whereby, &quot;A lot of the time it ended up with just Paul playing the piano and Ringo keeping the tempo, and we weren&#x27;t allowed to play as a band as much.&quot;

In Lewisohn&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; represents the group&#x27;s last unified effort, displaying a cohesion that deteriorated immediately following the album&#x27;s completion and entirely disappeared by the release of &quot;The Beatles&quot; (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;) in 1968. Martin recalled in 1987 that throughout the making of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, &quot;There was a very good spirit at that time between all the Beatles and ourselves. We were all conscious that we were doing something that was great.&quot; He said that while McCartney effectively led the project, and sometimes annoyed his bandmates, &quot;Paul appreciated John&#x27;s contribution on &quot;Pepper&quot;. In terms of quantity, it wasn&#x27;t great, but in terms of quality, it was enormous.&quot;

==Songs==
===Overview===
Among musicologists, Allan Moore says that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is composed mainly of rock and pop music, while Michael Hannan and Naphtali Wagner both see it as an album of various genres; Hannan says it features &quot;a broad variety of musical and theatrical genres&quot;. According to Hannan and Wagner, the music incorporates the stylistic influences of rock and roll, vaudeville, big band, piano jazz, blues, chamber, circus, music hall, avant-garde, and Western and Indian classical music. Wagner feels the album&#x27;s music reconciles the &quot;diametrically opposed aesthetic ideals&quot; of classical and psychedelia, achieving a &quot;psycheclassical synthesis&quot; of the two forms. Musicologist John Covach describes &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as &quot;proto-progressive&quot;.

According to author George Case, all of the songs on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; were perceived by contemporary listeners as being drug-inspired, with 1967 marking the pinnacle of LSD&#x27;s influence on pop music. Shortly before the album&#x27;s release, the BBC banned &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; from British radio because of the phrase &quot;I&#x27;d love to turn you on&quot;; the BBC stated that it could &quot;encourage a permissive attitude towards drug-taking&quot;. Although Lennon and McCartney denied any drug-related interpretation of the song at the time, McCartney later suggested that the line referred to either drugs or sex. The meaning of &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; became the subject of speculation, as many believed that the title was code for LSD. In &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot;, the reference to &quot;Henry the Horse&quot; contains two common slang terms for heroin. Fans speculated that Henry the Horse was a drug dealer and &quot;Fixing a Hole&quot; was a reference to heroin use. Others noted lyrics such as &quot;I get high&quot; from &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, &quot;take some tea&quot; – slang for cannabis use – from &quot;Lovely Rita&quot;, and &quot;digging the weeds&quot; from &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot;.

The author Sheila Whiteley attributes &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; underlying philosophy not only to the drug culture, but also to metaphysics and the non-violent approach of the flower power movement. The musicologist Oliver Julien views the album as an embodiment of &quot;the social, the musical, and more generally, the cultural changes of the 1960s&quot;. The album&#x27;s primary value, according to Moore, is its ability to &quot;capture, more vividly than almost anything contemporaneous, its own time and place&quot;. Whiteley agrees, crediting the album with &quot;provid[ing] a historical snapshot of England during the run-up to the Summer of Love&quot;. Several scholars have applied a hermeneutic strategy to their analysis of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; lyrics, identifying loss of innocence and the dangers of overindulgence in fantasies or illusions as the most prominent themes.

=== Side one ===
==== &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; ====
&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; opens with the title track, starting with 10 seconds of the combined sounds of a pit orchestra warming up and an audience waiting for a concert, creating the illusion of the album as a live performance. McCartney serves as the master of ceremonies, welcoming the audience to a twentieth-anniversary reunion concert by Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s band, who, led by Lennon, then sing a message of appreciation for the crowd&#x27;s warm response. Womack says the lyric bridges the fourth wall between the artist and their audience. He argues that, paradoxically, the lyrics &quot;exemplify the mindless rhetoric of rock concert banter&quot; while &quot;mock[ing] the very notion of a pop album&#x27;s capacity for engendering authentic interconnection between artist and audience&quot;. In his view, the mixed message ironically serves to distance the group from their fans while simultaneously &quot;gesturing toward&quot; them as alter egos.

The song&#x27;s five-bar bridge is filled by a French horn quartet. Womack credits the recording&#x27;s use of a brass ensemble with distorted electric guitars as an early example of rock fusion. MacDonald agrees, describing the track as an overture rather than a song, and a &quot;fusion of Edwardian variety orchestra&quot; and contemporary hard rock. Hannan describes the track&#x27;s unorthodox stereo mix as &quot;typical of the album&quot;, with the lead vocal in the right speaker during the verses, but in the left during the chorus and middle eight. McCartney returns as the master of ceremonies near the end of the song, announcing the entrance of an alter ego named Billy Shears.

==== &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; ====
The title track segues into &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; amid the sound of screaming fans recorded during a Beatles concert at the Hollywood Bowl. In his role as Billy Shears, Starr contributes a baritone lead vocal that Womack credits with imparting an element of &quot;earnestness in sharp contrast with the ironic distance of the title track&quot;. Written by Lennon and McCartney, the song&#x27;s lyrics centre on a theme of questions, beginning with Starr asking the audience whether they would leave if he sang out of tune. In the call-and-response style, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison go on to ask their bandmate questions about the meaning of friendship and true love; by the final verse, Starr provides unequivocal answers. In MacDonald&#x27;s opinion, the lyric is &quot;at once communal and personal ... [and] meant as a gesture of inclusivity; everyone could join in.&quot; Everett comments that the track&#x27;s use of a major key double-plagal cadence became commonplace in pop music following the release of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.

==== &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; ====
Despite widespread suspicion that the title of &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; contained a hidden reference to LSD, Lennon insisted that it was derived from a pastel drawing by his four-year-old son Julian. A hallucinatory chapter from Lewis Carroll 1871 novel &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, a favourite of Lennon&#x27;s, inspired the song&#x27;s atmosphere. According to MacDonald, &quot;the lyric explicitly recreates the psychedelic experience&quot;.

The first verse begins with what Womack characterises as &quot;an invitation in the form of an imperative&quot; through the line: &quot;Picture yourself in a boat on a river&quot;, and continues with imaginative imagery, including &quot;tangerine trees&quot;, &quot;rocking horse people&quot; and &quot;newspaper taxis&quot;. The musical backing includes a phrase played by McCartney on a Lowrey organ, treated with ADT to sound like a celeste, and tambura drone. Harrison also contributed a lead guitar part that doubles Lennon&#x27;s vocal over the verses in the style of a sarangi player accompanying an Indian khyal singer. The music critic Tim Riley identifies the track as a moment &quot;in the album, [where] the material world is completely clouded in the mythical by both text and musical atmosphere&quot;.
==== &quot;Getting Better&quot; ====
MacDonald considers &quot;Getting Better&quot; to contain &quot;the most ebullient performance&quot; on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Womack credits the track&#x27;s &quot;driving rock sound&quot; with distinguishing it from the album&#x27;s overtly psychedelic material; its lyrics inspire the listener &quot;to usurp the past by living well and flourishing in the present&quot;. He cites it as a strong example of Lennon and McCartney&#x27;s collaborative songwriting, particularly Lennon&#x27;s addition of the line &quot;It can&#x27;t get no worse&quot;, which serves as a &quot;sarcastic rejoinder&quot; to McCartney&#x27;s chorus: &quot;It&#x27;s getting better all the time&quot;. Lennon&#x27;s contribution to the lyric also includes a confessional regarding his having been violent with female companions: &quot;I used to be cruel to my woman&quot;. In Womack&#x27;s opinion, the song encourages the listener to follow the speaker&#x27;s example and &quot;alter their own angst-ridden ways&quot;: &quot;Man I was mean, but I&#x27;m changing my scene and I&#x27;m doing the best that I can.&quot;

==== &quot;Fixing a Hole&quot; ====
&quot;Fixing a Hole&quot; deals with McCartney&#x27;s desire to let his mind wander freely and to express his creativity without the burden of self-conscious insecurities. Womack interprets the lyric as &quot;the speaker&#x27;s search for identity among the crowd&quot;, in particular the &quot;quests for consciousness and connection&quot; that differentiate individuals from society as a whole. MacDonald characterises it as a &quot;distracted and introverted track&quot;, during which McCartney forgoes his &quot;usual smooth design&quot; in favour of &quot;something more preoccupied&quot;. He cites Harrison&#x27;s electric guitar solo as serving the track well, capturing its mood by conveying detachment. Womack notes McCartney&#x27;s adaptation of the lyric &quot;a hole in the roof where the rain leaks in&quot; from Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re Gonna Move&quot;.

==== &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot; ====

In Everett&#x27;s view, the lyrics to &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot; address the problem of alienation &quot;between disagreeing peoples&quot;, particularly those distanced from each other by the generation gap. McCartney&#x27;s narrative details the plight of a young woman escaping the control of her parents, and was inspired by a piece about teenage runaways published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. Lennon supplies a supporting vocal that conveys the parents&#x27; anguish and confusion. It is the first track on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; that eschews the use of guitars and drums, featuring only a string nonet with a harp. Music historian Doyle Greene views it as the first of the album&#x27;s songs to address &quot;the crisis of middle-class life in the late 1960s&quot; and comments on its surprisingly conservative sentiments, given McCartney&#x27;s absorption in the London avant-garde scene.

==== &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot; ====

Lennon adapted the lyrics for &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot; from an 1843 poster for Pablo Fanque&#x27;s circus that he purchased at an antique shop in Kent on the day of filming the promotional film for &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;. Womack views the track as an effective blending of a print source and music, while MacDonald describes it as &quot;a spontaneous expression of its author&#x27;s playful hedonism&quot;. Tasked by Lennon to evoke a circus atmosphere so vivid that he could &quot;smell the sawdust&quot;, Martin and Emerick created a sound collage comprising randomly assembled recordings of harmoniums, harmonicas and calliopes. Everett says that the track&#x27;s use of Edwardian imagery thematically links it with the album&#x27;s title song. Gould also views &quot;Mr. Kite!&quot; as a return to the LP&#x27;s opening motif, albeit that of show business and with the focus now on performers and a show in a radically different setting.

=== Side two ===
==== &quot;Within You Without You&quot; ====
Harrison&#x27;s Hindustani classical music-inspired &quot;Within You Without You&quot; reflects his immersion in the teachings of the Hindu Vedas, while its musical form and Indian instrumentation, such as sitar, tabla, dilrubas and tamburas, recalls the Hindu devotional tradition known as bhajan. Harrison recorded the song with London-based Indian musicians from the Asian Music Circle; none of the other Beatles played on the recording. He and Martin then worked on a Western string arrangement that imitated the slides and bends typical of Indian music. The song&#x27;s pitch is derived from the eastern Khamaj scale, which is akin to the Mixolydian mode in the West.

MacDonald regards &quot;Within You Without You&quot; as &quot;the most distant departure from the staple Beatles sound in their discography&quot;, and a work that represents the &quot;conscience&quot; of the LP through the lyrics&#x27; rejection of Western materialism. Womack calls it &quot;quite arguably, the album&#x27;s ethical soul&quot; and views the line &quot;With our love we could save the world&quot; as a concise reflection of the Beatles&#x27; idealism that soon inspired the Summer of Love. The track ends with a burst of laughter gleaned from a tape in the EMI archive; some listeners interpreted this as a mockery of the song, but Harrison explained: &quot;It&#x27;s a release after five minutes of sad music ... You were supposed to hear the audience anyway, as they listen to Sergeant Pepper&#x27;s Show. That was the style of the album.&quot;

==== &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot; ====
MacDonald characterises McCartney&#x27;s &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot; as a song &quot;aimed chiefly at parents&quot;, borrowing heavily from the English music hall style of George Formby, while invoking images of the illustrator Donald McGill&#x27;s seaside postcards. Its sparse arrangement includes clarinets, chimes and piano. Moore views the song as a synthesis of ragtime and pop, adding that its position following &quot;Within You Without You&quot; – a blend of Indian classical music and pop – demonstrates the diversity of the album&#x27;s material. He says the music hall atmosphere is reinforced by McCartney&#x27;s vocal delivery and the recording&#x27;s use of chromaticism, a harmonic pattern that can be traced to Scott Joplin&#x27;s &quot;The Ragtime Dance&quot; and &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; by Johann Strauss. Varispeeding was used on the track, raising its pitch by a semitone in an attempt to make McCartney sound younger. Everett comments that the lyric&#x27;s protagonist is sometimes associated with the Lonely Hearts Club Band, but in his opinion the song is thematically unconnected to the others on the album.

==== &quot;Lovely Rita&quot; ====
Womack describes &quot;Lovely Rita&quot; as a work of &quot;full-tilt psychedelia&quot; that contrasts sharply with the preceding track. Citing McCartney&#x27;s recollection that he drew inspiration from learning that the American term for a female traffic warden was a meter maid, Gould deems it a celebration of an encounter that evokes Swinging London and the contemporaneous chic for military-style uniforms. MacDonald regards the song as a &quot;satire on authority&quot; that is &quot;imbued with an exuberant interest in life that lifts the spirits, dispersing self-absorption&quot;. The arrangement includes a quartet of comb-and-paper kazoos, a piano solo by Martin, and a coda in which the Beatles indulge in panting, groaning and other vocalised sounds. In Gould&#x27;s view, the track represents &quot;the show-stopper in the Pepper Band&#x27;s repertoire: a funny, sexy, extroverted song that comes closer to the spirit of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll than anything else on the album&quot;.

==== &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot; ====
Lennon was inspired to write &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot; after watching a television commercial for Kellogg&#x27;s Corn Flakes, the jingle of which he adapted for the song&#x27;s refrain. The track uses the bluesy Mixolydian mode in A, which Everett credits with &quot;perfectly express[ing] Lennon&#x27;s grievance against complacency&quot;. According to Greene, the song contrasts sharply with &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot; by providing &quot;the more &#x27;avant-garde&#x27; subversive study of suburban life&quot;. The time signature varies across 5/4, 3/4 and 4/4, while the arrangement includes a horn section comprising members of Sounds Inc. MacDonald highlights the &quot;rollicking&quot; brass score, Starr&#x27;s drumming and McCartney&#x27;s &quot;coruscating pseudo-Indian guitar solo&quot; among the elements that convey a sense of aggression on a track he deems a &quot;disgusted canter through the muck, mayhem, and mundanity of the human farmyard&quot;. A series of animal noises appear during the fade-out that are sequenced – at Lennon&#x27;s request – so that each successive animal could conceivably scare or devour the preceding one. The sound of a chicken clucking overlaps with a stray guitar note at the start of the next track, creating a seamless transition between the two songs.

==== &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)&quot; ====
&quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)&quot; follows as a segue to the album&#x27;s finale. The hard-rocking song was written after Neil Aspinall, the Beatles&#x27; road manager, suggested that since &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; opened the album, the fictional band should make an appearance near the end. Sung by all four Beatles, the reprise omits the brass section from the title track and has a faster tempo. With Harrison on lead guitar, it serves as a rare example from the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; sessions where the group taped a basic track live with their usual stage instrumentation. MacDonald finds the Beatles&#x27; excitement tangibly translated on the recording, which is again augmented with ambient crowd noise.

==== &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; ====
The last chord of the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; reprise segues amid audience applause to acoustic guitar strumming and the start of what Moore calls &quot;one of the most harrowing songs ever written&quot;. &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; consists of four verses by Lennon, a bridge, two aleatoric orchestral crescendos, and an interpolated middle part written and sung by McCartney. The first crescendo serves as a segue between the third verse and the middle part, leading to a bridge known as the &quot;dream sequence&quot;. Lennon drew inspiration for the lyrics from a &quot;Daily Mail&quot; report on potholes in the Lancashire town of Blackburn and an article in the same newspaper relating to the death of Beatles friend and Guinness heir Tara Browne.

According to Martin, Lennon and McCartney were equally responsible for the decision to use an orchestra. Martin said that Lennon requested &quot;a tremendous build-up, from nothing up to something absolutely like the end of the world&quot;, while McCartney realised this idea by drawing inspiration from Cage and Stockhausen. Womack describes Starr&#x27;s performance as &quot;one of his most inventive drum parts on record&quot;. The thunderous piano chord that concludes the track and the album was produced by recording Lennon, Starr, McCartney and Evans simultaneously sounding an E major chord on three separate pianos; Martin then augmented the sound with a harmonium.

Riley characterises the song as a &quot;postlude to the &quot;Pepper&quot; fantasy ... that sets all the other songs in perspective&quot;, while shattering the illusion of &quot;Pepperland&quot; by introducing the &quot;parallel universe of everyday life&quot;. MacDonald describes the track as &quot;a song not of disillusionment with life itself, but of disenchantment with the limits of mundane perception&quot;.

As &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; ends, a 15-kilohertz high-frequency tone is heard; it was added at Lennon&#x27;s suggestion with the intention that it would annoy dogs. This is followed by the sounds of backwards laughter and random gibberish that were pressed into the record&#x27;s concentric run-out groove, which loops back into itself endlessly on any record player not equipped with an automatic needle return. Lennon can be heard saying, &quot;Been so high&quot;, followed by McCartney&#x27;s response: &quot;Never could be any other way.&quot;

===Concept===
According to Womack, with &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; opening song &quot;the Beatles manufacture an artificial textual space in which to stage their art.&quot; The reprise of the title song appears on side two, just before the climactic &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, creating a framing device. In Lennon and Starr&#x27;s view, only the first two songs and the reprise are conceptually connected. In a 1980 interview, Lennon stated that his compositions had nothing to do with the Sgt. Pepper concept, adding: &quot;&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is called the first concept album, but it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere ... it works because we it worked.&quot;

In MacFarlane&#x27;s view, the Beatles &quot;chose to employ an overarching thematic concept in an apparent effort to unify individual tracks&quot;. Everett contends that the album&#x27;s &quot;musical unity results ... from motivic relationships between key areas, particularly involving C, E, and G&quot;. Moore argues that the recording&#x27;s &quot;use of common harmonic patterns and falling melodies&quot; contributes to its overall cohesiveness, which he describes as narrative unity, but not necessarily conceptual unity. MacFarlane agrees, suggesting that with the exception of the reprise, the album lacks the melodic and harmonic continuity that is consistent with cyclic form.

In a 1995 interview, McCartney recalled that the Liverpool childhood theme behind the first three songs recorded during the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; sessions was never formalised as an album-wide concept, but he said that it served as a &quot;device&quot; or underlying theme throughout the project. MacDonald identifies allusions to the Beatles&#x27; upbringing throughout &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; that are &quot;too persuasive to ignore&quot;. These include evocations of the postwar Northern music-hall tradition, references to Northern industrial towns and Liverpool schooldays, Lewis Carroll-inspired imagery (acknowledging Lennon&#x27;s favourite childhood reading), the use of brass instrumentation in the style of park bandstand performances (familiar to McCartney through his visits to Sefton Park),&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvin/Mojo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the album cover&#x27;s flower arrangement akin to a floral clock. Norman partly agrees; he says that &quot;In many ways, the album carried on the childhood and Liverpool theme with its circus and fairground effects, its pervading atmosphere of the traditional northern music hall that was in both its main creators&#x27; [McCartney and Lennon&#x27;s] blood.&quot;

== Packaging ==
===Front cover===
Pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth designed the album cover for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Blake recalled of the concept: &quot;I offered the idea that if they had just played a concert in the park, the cover could be a photograph of the group just after the concert with the crowd who had just watched the concert, watching them.&quot; He added, &quot;If we did this by using cardboard cut-outs, it could be a magical crowd of whomever they wanted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Humphries/MojoSpecial&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to McCartney, he himself provided the ink drawing on which Blake and Haworth based the design. The cover was art-directed by Robert Fraser and photographed by Michael Cooper.

The front of the LP includes a colourful collage featuring the Beatles in costume as Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band, standing with a group of life-sized cardboard cut-outs of famous people. Each of the Beatles sports a heavy moustache, after Harrison had first grown one as a disguise during his visit to India. The moustaches reflected the growing influence of hippie style trends, while the group&#x27;s clothing, in Gould&#x27;s description, &quot;spoofed the vogue in Britain for military fashions&quot;. The centre of the cover depicts the Beatles standing behind a bass drum on which fairground artist Joe Ephgrave painted the words of the album&#x27;s title. In front of the drum is an arrangement of flowers that spell out &quot;Beatles&quot;. The group are dressed in satin day-glo-coloured military-style uniforms that were manufactured by the London theatrical costumer M. Berman Ltd. Next to the Beatles are wax sculptures of the band members in their suits and moptop haircuts from the Beatlemania era, borrowed from Madame Tussauds. Amid the greenery are figurines of the Eastern deities Buddha and Lakshmi.

The cover collage includes 57 photographs and nine waxworks. Author Ian Inglis views the tableau &quot;as a guidebook to the cultural topography of the decade&quot; that conveyed the increasing democratisation of society whereby &quot;traditional barriers between &#x27;high&#x27; and &#x27;low&#x27; culture were being eroded&quot;, while Case cites it as the most explicit demonstration of pop culture&#x27;s &quot;continuity with the avant-gardes of yesteryear&quot;. The final grouping included Stockhausen and Carroll, along with singers such as Bob Dylan and Bobby Breen; film stars Marlon Brando, Tyrone Power, Tony Curtis, Marlene Dietrich, Mae West and Marilyn Monroe; artist Aubrey Beardsley; boxer Sonny Liston and footballer Albert Stubbins. Also included were comedians Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy; writers H.G. Wells, Oscar Wilde and Dylan Thomas; and the philosophers and scientists Karl Marx, Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Harrison chose the Self-Realization Fellowship gurus Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswar and Paramahansa Yogananda. The Rolling Stones are represented by a doll wearing a shirt emblazoned with a message of welcome to the band.

Fearing controversy, EMI rejected Lennon&#x27;s request for images of Adolf Hitler and Jesus Christ and Harrison&#x27;s for Mahatma Gandhi. When McCartney was asked why the Beatles did not include Elvis Presley among the musical artists, he replied: &quot;Elvis was too important and too far above the rest even to mention.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleming/RS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Starr was the only Beatle who offered no suggestions for the collage, telling Blake, &quot;Whatever the others say is fine by me.&quot; The final cost for the cover art was nearly £3,000 (), an extravagant sum for a time when album covers would typically cost around £50 ().

===Back cover, gatefold and cut-outs===
The 30 March 1967 photo session with Cooper also produced the back cover and the inside gatefold, which Inglis describes as conveying &quot;an obvious and immediate warmth ... which distances it from the sterility and artifice typical of such images&quot;. McCartney recalled the inner-gatefold image as an example of the Beatles&#x27; interest in &quot;eye messages&quot;, adding: &quot;So with Michael Cooper&#x27;s inside photo, we all said, &#x27;Now look into this camera and really say I love you! Really try and feel love; really give love through this!&#x27;... [And] if you look at it you&#x27;ll see the big effort from the eyes.&quot; In Lennon&#x27;s description, Cooper&#x27;s photos of the band showed &quot;two people who are flying [on drugs], and two who aren&#x27;t&quot;.

The album&#x27;s lyrics were printed in full on the back cover, the first time this had been done on a rock LP. The record&#x27;s inner sleeve featured artwork by the Dutch design team the Fool that eschewed for the first time the standard white paper in favour of an abstract pattern of waves of maroon, red, pink and white. Included as a bonus gift was a sheet of cardboard cut-outs designed by Blake and Haworth. These consisted of a postcard-sized portrait of Sgt. Pepper (probably based on a photograph of British Army officer James Melville Babington, but also noted as being similar to a statue from Lennon&#x27;s house that was used on the front cover), a fake moustache, two sets of sergeant stripes, two lapel badges, and a stand-up cut-out of the band in their satin uniforms. Moore writes that the inclusion of these items helped fans &quot;pretend to be in the band&quot;.

==Release==
===Radio previews and launch party===
The album was previewed on the pirate radio station Radio London on 12 May and officially on the BBC Light Programme&#x27;s show &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot;, by Kenny Everett, on 20 May. Everett played the entire album apart from &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. The day before Everett&#x27;s broadcast, Epstein hosted a launch party for music journalists and disc jockeys at his house in Belgravia in central London. The event was a new initiative in pop promotion and furthered the significance of the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reporter described it as the first &quot;listen-in&quot; and typical of the Beatles&#x27; penchant for innovation.
The party marked the band&#x27;s first group interaction with the press in close to a year. Norrie Drummond of the &quot;NME&quot; wrote that they had been &quot;virtually incommunicado&quot; over that time, leading a national newspaper to complain that the band were &quot;contemplative, secretive and exclusive&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drummond/NME&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the journalists present were shocked by the Beatles&#x27; appearance, particularly that of Lennon and Harrison, as the band members&#x27; bohemian attire contrasted sharply with their former image.&lt;ref name=&quot;Womack/LaunchParty&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Music journalist Ray Coleman recalled that Lennon looked &quot;haggard, old, ill&quot; and clearly under the influence of drugs. Biographer Howard Sounes likens the Beatles&#x27; presence to a gathering of the British royal family and highlights a photo from the event that shows Lennon shaking McCartney&#x27;s hand &quot;in an exaggeratedly congratulatory way, throwing his head back in sarcastic laughter&quot;.

On 26 May, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was given a rush-release in the UK, ahead of the scheduled date of 1 June. The band&#x27;s eighth LP, it was the first Beatles album where the track listings were exactly the same for the UK and US versions. The US release took place on 2 June. Capitol Records&#x27; advertising for the album emphasised that the Beatles and Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s band were one and the same.

===Public reaction===
&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was widely perceived by listeners as the soundtrack to the Summer of Love, during a year that author Peter Lavezzoli calls &quot;a watershed moment in the West when the search for higher consciousness and an alternative world view had reached critical mass&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Langdon Winner recalled:

According to Riley, the album &quot;drew people together through the common experience of pop on a larger scale than ever before&quot;. In MacDonald&#x27;s description, an &quot;almost religious awe surrounded the LP&quot;; he says that its impact was cross-generational, as &quot;Young and old alike were entranced&quot;, and era-defining, in that the &quot;psychic shiver&quot; it inspired across the world was &quot;nothing less than a cinematic dissolve from one &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; to another&quot;. In his view, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; conveyed the psychedelic experience so effectively to listeners unfamiliar with hallucinogenic drugs that &quot;If such a thing as a cultural &#x27;contact high&#x27; is possible, it happened here.&quot; Music journalist Mark Ellen, a teenager in 1967, recalls listening to part of the album at a friend&#x27;s house and then hearing the rest playing at the next house he visited as if the record was emanating communally from &quot;one giant Dansette&quot;. He says the most remarkable thing was its acceptance by adults who had turned against the Beatles when they became &quot;gaunt and enigmatic&quot;, and how the group, recast as polished &quot;masters of ceremony&quot;, were now &quot;the very family favourites they&#x27;d sought to satirise&quot;.

Writing in his book &quot;Electric Shock&quot;, Peter Doggett describes &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as &quot;the biggest pop happening&quot; to take place between the Beatles&#x27; debut on American television in February 1964 and Lennon&#x27;s murder in December 1980, while Norman writes: &quot;A whole generation, still used to happy landmarks through life, would always remember exactly when and where they first played it...&quot; The album&#x27;s impact was felt at the Monterey International Pop Festival, the second event in the Summer of Love, organised by Taylor and held over 16–18 June in county fairgrounds south of San Francisco. &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was played in kiosks and stands there, and festival staff wore badges carrying Lennon&#x27;s lyric &quot;A splendid time is guaranteed for all&quot;.

American radio stations interrupted their regular scheduling, playing the album virtually non-stop, often from start to finish. Emphasising its identity as a self-contained work, none of the songs were issued as singles at the time or available on spin-off EPs. Instead, the Beatles released &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; as a single in July, after performing the song on the &quot;Our World&quot; satellite broadcast on 25 June before an audience estimated at 400 million. According to sociomusicologist Simon Frith, the international broadcast served to confirm &quot;the Beatles&#x27; evangelical role&quot; amid the public&#x27;s embrace of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frith/HoR&quot;&gt; Available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, &quot;Our World&quot; also quelled the furore that followed McCartney&#x27;s repeated admission in mid-June that he had taken LSD. In Norman&#x27;s description, this admission was indicative of how &quot;invulnerable&quot; McCartney felt after &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;; it made the band&#x27;s drug-taking public knowledge and confirmed the link between the album and drugs.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; topped the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; albums chart (now the UK Albums Chart) for 23 consecutive weeks from 10 June, with a further four weeks at number one in the period through to February 1968. The record sold 250,000 copies in the UK during its first seven days on sale there. The album held the number one position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart in the US for 15 weeks, from 1 July to 13 October 1967, and remained in the top 200 for 113 consecutive weeks. It also topped charts in many other countries.

With 2.5 million copies sold within three months of its release, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; initial commercial success exceeded that of all previous Beatles albums. In the UK, it was the best-selling album of 1967 and of the decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mawer/1969&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to figures published in 2009 by former Capitol executive David Kronemyer, further to estimates he gave in &quot;MuseWire&quot; magazine, the album had sold 2,360,423 copies in the US by 31 December 1967 and 3,372,581 copies by the end of the decade.

== Contemporary critical reception ==

The release of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; coincided with a period when, with the advent of dedicated rock criticism, commentators sought to recognise artistry in pop music, particularly in the Beatles&#x27; work, and identify albums as refined artistic statements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton/Slate&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In America, this approach had been heightened by the &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; / &quot;Penny Lane&quot; single, and was also exemplified by Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s television program &quot;Inside Pop: The Rock Revolution&quot;, broadcast by CBS in April 1967. Following the release of the Beatles&#x27; single, in author Bernard Gendron&#x27;s description, a &quot;discursive frenzy&quot; ensued as &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; and other publications from the cultural mainstream increasingly voiced their &quot;ecstatic approbation toward the Beatles&quot;.

The vast majority of contemporary reviews of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; were positive, with the album receiving widespread critical acclaim. Schaffner said that the consensus was aptly summed up by Tom Phillips in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, when he called the LP &quot;the most ambitious and most successful record album ever issued&quot;. Among Britain&#x27;s pop press, Peter Jones of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; said the album was &quot;clever and brilliant, from raucous to poignant and back again&quot;, while &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot; reviewer called it &quot;a beautiful and potent record, unique, clever, and stunning&quot;. In &quot;The Times&quot;, William Mann described &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as a &quot;pop music master-class&quot; and commented that, so considerable were its musical advances, &quot;the only track that would have been conceivable in pop songs five years ago&quot; was &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;. Having been among the first British critics to fully appreciate &quot;Revolver&quot;, Peter Clayton of &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine said that the new album was &quot;like nearly everything the Beatles do, bizarre, wonderful, perverse, beautiful, exciting, provocative, exasperating, compassionate and mocking&quot;. He found &quot;plenty of electronic gimmickry on the record&quot; before concluding: &quot;but that isn&#x27;t the heart of the thing. It&#x27;s the combination of imagination, cheek and skill that make this such a rewarding LP.&quot; Wilfrid Mellers, in his review for &quot;New Statesman&quot;, praised the album&#x27;s elevation of pop music to the level of fine art, while Kenneth Tynan, &quot;The Times&quot;″ theatre critic, said it represented &quot;a decisive moment in the history of Western civilisation&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; Jack Kroll called &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and compared its lyrics with literary works by Edith Sitwell, Harold Pinter and T. S. Eliot, particularly &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, which he likened to Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; paired the Beatles with Duke Ellington, as artists who operated &quot;in that special territory where entertainment slips into art&quot;. 

One of the few well-known American rock critics at the time, and another early champion of &quot;Revolver&quot;, Richard Goldstein wrote a scathing review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He characterised &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as a &quot;spoiled&quot; child and &quot;an album of special effects, dazzling but ultimately fraudulent&quot;, and was critical of the Beatles for sacrificing their authenticity to become &quot;cloistered composers&quot;. Although he admired &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, comparing it to a work by Richard Wagner, Goldstein said that the songs lacked lyrical substance such that &quot;tone overtakes meaning&quot;, an aesthetic he blamed on &quot;posturing and put-on&quot; in the form of production effects such as echo and reverb. As a near-lone voice of dissent, he was widely castigated for his views. Four days later, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, where Goldstein had become a celebrated columnist since 1966, reacted to the &quot;hornet&#x27;s nest&quot; of complaints, by publishing Phillips&#x27; highly favourable review. According to Schaffner, Goldstein was &quot;kept busy for months&quot; justifying his opinions, which included writing a defence of his review, for the &quot;Voice&quot;, in July.

Among the commentators who responded to Goldstein&#x27;s critique, composer Ned Rorem, writing in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, credited the Beatles with possessing a &quot;magic of genius&quot; akin to Mozart and characterised &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as a harbinger of a &quot;golden Renaissance of Song&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; quoted musicologists and avant-garde composers who equated the standard of the Beatles&#x27; songwriting to Schubert and Schumann, and located the band&#x27;s work to electronic music; the magazine concluded that the album was &quot;a historic departure in the progress of music – any music&quot;. Literary critic Richard Poirier wrote a laudatory appreciation of the Beatles in the journal &quot;Partisan Review&quot; and said that &quot;listening to the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; album one thinks not simply of the history of popular music but the history of this century.&quot; In his December 1967 column for &quot;Esquire&quot;, Robert Christgau described &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as &quot;a consolidation, more intricate than &quot;Revolver&quot; but not more substantial&quot;. He suggested that Goldstein had fallen &quot;victim to overanticipation&quot;, identifying his primary error as &quot;allow[ing] all the filters and reverbs and orchestral effects and overdubs to deafen him to the stuff underneath, which was pretty nice&quot;.

==Sociocultural influence==
===Contemporary youth and counterculture===

In the wake of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, the underground and mainstream press widely publicised the Beatles as leaders of youth culture, as well as &quot;lifestyle revolutionaries&quot;. In Moore&#x27;s description, the album &quot;seems to have spoken (in a way no other has) for its generation&quot;. An educator referenced in a July 1967 &quot;New York Times&quot; article was reported to have said on the topic of music studies and its relevance to the day&#x27;s youth: &quot;If you want to know what youths are thinking and feeling... you cannot find anyone who speaks for them or to them more clearly than the Beatles.&quot;
&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was the focus of much celebration by the counterculture. American Beat poet Allen Ginsberg said of the album: &quot;After the apocalypse of Hitler and the apocalypse of the Bomb, there was here an exclamation of joy, the rediscovery of joy and what it is to be alive.&quot; The American psychologist and counterculture figure Timothy Leary labelled the Beatles &quot;avatars of the new world order&quot; and said that the LP &quot;gave a voice to the feeling that the old ways were over&quot; by stressing the need for cultural change based on a peaceful agenda. According to author Michael Frontani, the Beatles &quot;legitimiz[ed] the lifestyle of the counterculture&quot;, just as they did popular music, and formed the basis of Jann Wenner&#x27;s scope on these issues when launching &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in late 1967. Further to Lennon wearing an Afghan sheepskin coat at the album launch party, &quot;Afghans&quot; became a popular garment among hippies, and Westerners increasingly sought out the coats on the hippie trail in Afghanistan.

McCartney&#x27;s LSD admission formalised the link between rock music and drugs, and attracted scorn from American religious leaders and conservatives. Vice-president Spiro Agnew contended that the &quot;friends&quot; referred to in &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; were &quot;assorted drugs&quot;. As part of an escalating national debate that triggered an investigation by the US Congress, he launched a campaign in 1970 to address the issue of American youth being &quot;brainwashed&quot; into taking drugs through the music of the Beatles and other rock artists. In the UK, according to historian David Simonelli, the album&#x27;s obvious drug allusions inspired a hierarchy within the youth movement for the first time, based on listeners&#x27; ability to &quot;get&quot; psychedelia and align with the elite notion of Romantic artistry. Harrison was eager to separate the message of &quot;Within You Without You&quot; from the LSD experience, telling an interviewer: &quot;It&#x27;s nothing to do with pills... It&#x27;s just in your own head, the realisation.&quot;
The Beatles&#x27; presentation as Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s band resonated at a time when many young people in the UK and the US were seeking to redefine their own identity and were drawn to communities that espoused the transformational power of mind-altering drugs. In the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, the recognised centre of the counterculture, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was viewed as a &quot;code for life&quot;, according to music journalist Alan Clayson, with street people such as the Merry Band of Pranksters offering &quot;Beatle readings&quot;. American social activist Abbie Hoffman credited the album as his inspiration for staging the attempted levitation of the Pentagon during the Mobe&#x27;s anti-Vietnam War rally in October 1967. The Byrds&#x27; David Crosby later expressed surprise that by 1970 the album&#x27;s powerful sentiments had not been enough to stop the Vietnam War.

&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; informed Frank Zappa&#x27;s parody of the counterculture and flower power on the Mothers of Invention&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;. By 1968, according to music critic Greil Marcus, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; appeared shallow against the emotional backdrop of the political and social upheavals of American life. Simon Frith, in his overview of 1967 for &quot;The History of Rock&quot;, said that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; &quot;defined the year&quot; by conveying the optimism and sense of empowerment at the centre of the youth movement. He added that the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; – an album that contrasted sharply with the Beatles&#x27; message by &quot;offer[ing] no escape&quot; – became more relevant in a cultural climate typified by &quot;the Sex Pistols, the new political aggression, the rioting in the streets&quot; during the 1970s. In a 1987 review for &quot;Q&quot; magazine, Charles Shaar Murray asserted that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; &quot;remains a central pillar of the mythology and iconography of the late &#x27;60s&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;CSM/Q&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while Colin Larkin states in his 1989 &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;: &quot;[it] turned out to be no mere pop album but a cultural icon, embracing the constituent elements of the 60s&#x27; youth culture: pop art, garish fashion, drugs, instant mysticism and freedom from parental control.&quot;

===Cultural legitimisation of popular music===
In &quot;The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature&quot;, Kevin Dettmar writes that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; achieved &quot;a combination of popular success and critical acclaim unequaled in twentieth-century art... never before had an aesthetic and technical masterpiece enjoyed such popularity.&quot; Through the level of attention it received from the rock press and more culturally elite publications, the album achieved full cultural legitimisation for pop music and recognition for the medium as a genuine art form. Riley says that pop had been due this accreditation &quot;at least as early as &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; in 1964. He adds that the timing of the album&#x27;s release and its reception ensured that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; has attained the kind of populist adoration that renowned works often assume regardless of their larger significance – it&#x27;s the Beatles&#x27; &#x27;Mona Lisa&#x27;.&quot; At the 10th Annual Grammy Awards in March 1968, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; won awards in four categories: Album of the Year; Best Contemporary Album; Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical; and Best Album Cover, Graphic Arts. Its win in the Album of the Year category marked the first time that a rock LP had received this honour.

Among the recognised composers who helped legitimise the Beatles as serious musicians at the time were Luciano Berio, Aaron Copland, John Cage, Ned Rorem and Leonard Bernstein. According to Rodriguez, an element of exaggeration accompanied some of the acclaim for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, with particularly effusive approbation coming from Rorem, Bernstein and Tynan, &quot;as if every critic was seeking to outdo the other for the most lavish embrace of the Beatles&#x27; new direction&quot;. In Gendron&#x27;s view, the cultural approbation represented American &quot;highbrow&quot; commentators (Rorem and Poirier) looking to establish themselves over their &quot;low-middlebrow&quot; equivalent, after &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; had led the way in recognising the Beatles&#x27; artistry, and over the new discipline of rock criticism. Gendron describes the discourse as one whereby, during a period that lasted for six months, &quot;highbrow&quot; composers and musicologists &quot;jostl[ed] to pen the definitive effusive appraisal of the Beatles&quot;.

Aside from the attention afforded the album in literary and scholarly journals, the American jazz magazines &quot;Down Beat&quot; and &quot;Jazz&quot; both began to cover rock music for the first time, with the latter changing its name to &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; as a result. In addition, following &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, established American publications such as &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot; and the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; started discussing rock as art, in terms usually reserved for jazz criticism. Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1969, Michael Lydon said that reviewers had had to invent &quot;new criticism&quot; to match pop&#x27;s musical advances, since: &quot;Writing had to be an appropriate response to the music; in writing about, say, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, you had to try to write something as good as &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Because, of course, what made that record beautiful was the beautiful response it created in you; if your written response was true to your listening response, the writing would stand on its own as a creation on par with the record.&quot;

Through its acceptance by &quot;serious&quot; composers, according to Schaffner, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; satisfied the ambitions of a staid, middle-age American audience keen to be seen as in tune with young people&#x27;s tastes, and every major rock LP was subsequently given the same level of critical analysis. In 1977, the LP won Best British Album at the inaugural Brit Awards, held by the BPI to celebrate the best British music of the last 25 years as part of Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. When EMI issued the Beatles&#x27; catalogue on CD in 1987, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was the only album afforded a dedicated release. EMI marketed it as &quot;the most important record ever released on compact disc&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petridis/Guardian&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of popular music===
====Industry and market changes====

Julien describes &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as a &quot;masterpiece of British psychedelia&quot; and says that it represents the &quot;epitome of the transformation of the recording studio into a compositional tool&quot;, marking the moment when &quot;popular music entered the era of phonographic composition&quot;. Many acts copied the album&#x27;s psychedelic sounds and imitated its production techniques, resulting in a rapid expansion of the producer&#x27;s role. In this regard, Lennon and McCartney complained that Martin had received too much attention for his part in the album&#x27;s creation, so beginning a feeling of resentment by the Beatles towards their longtime producer.

In 1987, Anthony DeCurtis of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as the album that &quot;revolutionized rock and roll&quot;, while music journalists Andy Greene and Scott Plagenhoef credit it with marking the beginning of the album era. For several years following its release, straightforward rock and roll was supplanted by a growing interest in extended form, and for the first time in the history of the music industry, sales of albums outpaced those of singles. In Gould&#x27;s description, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was &quot;the catalyst for an explosion of mass enthusiasm for album-formatted rock that would revolutionize both the aesthetics and the economics of the record business in ways that far out-stripped the earlier pop explosions triggered by the Elvis phenomenon of 1956 and the Beatlemania phenomenon of 1963&quot;. The music industry swiftly grew into a billion-dollar enterprise, although record company executives were blindsided by the appeal of new acts who defied established formulas.

Music critic Greg Kot said that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; introduced a template not only for creating album-oriented rock but also for consuming it, &quot;with listeners no longer twisting the night away to an assortment of three-minute singles, but losing themselves in a succession of 20-minute album sides, taking a journey led by the artist&quot;. In Moore&#x27;s view, the album was &quot;pivotal&quot; in heralding &quot;the realignment of rock from its working-class roots to its subsequent place on the college circuit&quot;, as students increasingly embraced the genre and record companies launched labels targeted towards this new market. As another result of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, US record companies no longer altered the content of albums by major British acts such as the Rolling Stones, the Kinks and Donovan, and their LPs were released in the artists&#x27; intended configuration.
====Albums and artistry====

According to Simonelli, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; established the standard for rock musicians, particularly British acts, to strive towards in their self-identification as artists rather than pop stars, whereby, as in the Romantic tradition, creative vision dominated at the expense of all commercial concerns. In the US, the album paved the way for British groups such as Pink Floyd and the Incredible String Band, whose work echoed the eclectic, mystical and escapist qualities of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.

Following the Beatles&#x27; example, many acts spent months in the studio creating their albums, focused on an artistic aesthetic and in the hope of winning critical approval. Among the many LPs influenced by &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; were Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s &quot;After Bathing at Baxter&#x27;s&quot;, the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; and the Moody Blues&#x27; &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;, all released in 1967; and the Zombies&#x27; &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot;, the Small Faces&#x27; &quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot; and the Pretty Things&#x27; &quot;S.F. Sorrow&quot;, all issued the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chilton/uDiscover&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; All rock albums were subsequently measured against &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Discussing &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;, Wenner referred to &quot;the post–&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; trap of trying to put out a &#x27;progressive,&#x27; &#x27;significant&#x27; and &#x27;different&#x27; album, as revolutionary as the Beatles. But it couldn&#x27;t be done, because only the Beatles can put out an album by the Beatles.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; viewed the album&#x27;s effect on Carla Bley as one of the &quot;50 key events in the history of dance music&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis/Guardian&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Bley spent four years crafting her musical response to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; – the 1971 avant-jazz triple album &quot;Escalator Over the Hill&quot; – which combined rock, Indo-jazz fusion and chamber jazz. Roger Waters cited &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as his influence when Pink Floyd created their 1973 album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, saying: &quot;I learned from Lennon, McCartney and Harrison that it was OK for us to write about our lives and express what we felt... More than any other record it gave me and my generation permission to branch out and do whatever we wanted.&quot;

Over subsequent decades, musical acts referred to their major artistic work as &quot;our &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;&quot;. In this regard, &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine recognises Prince&#x27;s &quot;Around the World in a Day&quot; (1985), Tears for Fears&#x27; &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot; (1989), The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; (1995), Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997), Oasis&#x27; &quot;Be Here Now&quot; (1997) and the Flaming Lips&#x27; &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; (1999) as albums that &quot;for better or for worse... would not have existed&quot; without &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Writing for &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2007, John Harris said that the album&#x27;s influence resonates in the &quot;identity games&quot; of Gnarls Barkley, in the ambitious song cycle of Green Day&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;American Idiot&quot;, in the respect afforded adventurous musicians such as Damon Albarn and Wayne Coyne, and particularly in the audience&#x27;s expectation that foremost artists will &quot;progress&quot; and perhaps &quot;ascend to a watershed point at which influence, experience and ambition cohere into something that just might blow our minds&quot;.

====Stylistic developments====
&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was highly influential on bands in the US acid rock (or psychedelic rock) scene. Lavezzoli views it as a key factor in 1967&#x27;s standing as the &quot;annus mirabilis&quot; for Indian classical music&#x27;s acceptance in the West, with the genre having been fully absorbed into psychedelic music. &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is commonly recognised as having originated progressive rock, due to the album&#x27;s self-conscious lyrics, its studio experimentation, and its efforts to expand the barriers of conventional three-minute tracks. In addition to influencing Pink Floyd records such as &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, it was a source of inspiration for Robert Fripp when he formed King Crimson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes/Prog&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The band&#x27;s 1969 debut &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; was intended as a homage to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.

MacFarlane writes that, despite concerns regarding its thematic unity, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; &quot;is widely regarded as the first true concept album in popular music&quot;. According to author Martina Elicker, despite earlier examples, it was &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; that familiarised critics and listeners with the notion of a &quot;concept and unified structure underlying a pop album&quot;, thus originating the term &quot;concept album&quot;. Further to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, musicians increasingly explored literary and sociological themes in their concept albums and adopted its anti-establishment sentiments. It also inspired rock opera works such as the Who&#x27;s double album &quot;Tommy&quot; and the musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;.

Author Carys Wyn Jones locates &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as the beginning of art rock. Doyle Greene says that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; provides a &quot;crucial locus in the assemblage of popular music and avant-garde/experimental music&quot;, notwithstanding the Beatles&#x27; presentation of the latter within formal song structures. He also says that, although the band are usually viewed as modernists, the album &quot;can be heard as a crucial &quot;postmodernist&quot; moment&quot;, through its incorporation of self-conscious artistry, irony and pastiche, and &quot;arguably marked rock music&#x27;s entry into postmodernism as opposed to high-modernism&quot;. During the 1970s, glam rock acts co-opted the Beatles&#x27; use of alter ego personas, including David Bowie when he adopted the guise of Ziggy Stardust. 
====Graphic design====
Inglis states that almost every account of the significance of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; emphasises the cover&#x27;s &quot;unprecedented correspondence between music and art, time and space&quot;. The cover helped to elevate album art as a respected topic for critical analysis whereby the &quot;structures and cultures of popular music&quot; could henceforth justify intellectual discourse in a way that – before &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; – would have seemed like &quot;fanciful conceit&quot;. He writes: &quot;[The &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;] cover has been regarded as groundbreaking in its visual and aesthetic properties, congratulated for its innovative and imaginative design, credited with providing an early impetus for the expansion of the graphic design industry into popular music, and perceived as largely responsible for the connections between art and pop to be made explicit.&quot;

&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; contributed to the popular trend for military-style fashions as adopted by London&#x27;s boutique shops. Following the LP&#x27;s release, rock acts afforded cover art greater consideration and increasingly sought to create a thematic link between their album artwork and the record&#x27;s musical statements. Riley describes the cover as &quot;one of the best-known works that pop art ever produced&quot;, while Norman calls it &quot;the most famous album cover of all time&quot;. The Beatles&#x27; 1968 self-titled double LP became known as the White Album for its plain white sleeve, which the band chose as a contrast with the wave of psychedelic imagery and album covers inspired by &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. In the late 1990s, the BBC included the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; cover in its list of British masterpieces of twentieth-century art and design, placing it ahead of the red telephone box, Mary Quant&#x27;s miniskirt, and the Mini motorcar.

== Retrospective appraisal ==

Although few critics initially agreed with Richard Goldstein&#x27;s criticism of the album, many came to appreciate his sentiments by the early 1980s. In his 1979 book &quot;Stranded: Rock and Roll for a Desert Island&quot;, Greil Marcus described &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as &quot;playful but contrived&quot; and &quot;a Day-Glo tombstone for its time&quot;. Marcus believed that the album &quot;strangled on its own conceits&quot; while being &quot;vindicated by world-wide acclaim&quot;. Lester Bangs – the so-called &quot;godfather&quot; of punk rock journalism – wrote in 1981 that &quot;Goldstein was right in his much-vilified review ... predicting that this record had the power to almost singlehandedly destroy rock and roll.&quot; He added: &quot;In the sixties rock and roll began to think of itself as an &#x27;art form&#x27;. Rock and roll is not an &#x27;art form&#x27;; rock and roll is a raw wail from the bottom of the guts.&quot;

In a 1976 article for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Christgau revisited the &quot;supposedly epochal Works of Art&quot; from 1967 and found that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; appeared &quot;bound to a moment&quot; amid the year&#x27;s culturally important music that had &quot;dated in the sense that it speaks with unusually specific eloquence of a single point in history&quot;. Christgau said of the album&#x27;s &quot;dozen good songs and true&quot;, &quot;Perhaps they&#x27;re too precisely performed, but I&#x27;m not going to complain.&quot; In his 1981 assessment, Simon Frith described &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as &quot;the last great pop album, the last LP ambitious to amuse &quot;.
Once the Beatles&#x27; catalogue became available on CD in 1987, a critical consensus formed around &quot;Revolver&quot; standing as the band&#x27;s best work; the White Album also surpassed &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; in many critics&#x27; estimation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quantick/ClassicRock&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In his feature article on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; 40th anniversary, for &quot;Mojo&quot;, John Harris said that, such was its &quot;seismic and universal&quot; impact and subsequent identification with 1967, a &quot;fashion for trashing&quot; the album had become commonplace. He attributed this to iconoclasm, as successive generations identified the album with baby boomers&#x27; retreat into &quot;nostalgia-tinged smugness&quot; during the 1970s, combined with a general distaste for McCartney following Lennon&#x27;s death. Citing its absence from the &quot;NME&quot; best-albums list in 1985 after it had topped the magazine&#x27;s previous poll, in 1974, Harris wrote:
Though by no means universally degraded... &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; had taken a protracted beating from which it has perhaps yet to fully recover. Regularly challenged and overtaken in the Best Beatle Album stakes... it suffered more than any Beatles record from the long fall-out after punk, and even the band&#x27;s Britpop-era revival mysteriously failed to improve its standing.

Writing in the 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Rob Sheffield described &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as &quot;a revelation of how far artists could go in a recording studio with only four tracks, plenty of imagination, and a drug or two&quot;, but also &quot;a masterwork of sonics, not songwriting&quot;. In his review for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham said that, while the album&#x27;s detractors typically bemoan McCartney&#x27;s dominant role, the reliance on studio innovation, and the unconvincing concept, &quot;as long as there are pairs of ears willing to disappear under headphones for forty minutes... &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; will continue to cast its considerable spell.&quot; Among reviews of the 2009 remastered album, Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote: &quot;It is impossible to overstate its impact: from a contemporary Sixties perspective it was utterly mind-blowing and original. Looking back from a point when its sonic innovations have been integrated into the mainstream, it remains a wonky, colourful and wildly improbable pop classic, although a little slighter and less cohesive than it may have seemed at the time.&quot; Mark Kemp, writing for &quot;Paste&quot;, said the album was a &quot;blast of avant-rock genius&quot; but also &quot;one of rock&#x27;s most overrated albums&quot;.

According to BBC Music critic Chris Jones, while &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; has long been subsumed under &quot;an avalanche of hyperbole&quot;, the album retains an enduring quality &quot;because its sum is greater than its whole... These guys weren&#x27;t just recording songs; they were inventing the stuff with which to make this record as they went along.&quot; Although the lyrics, particularly McCartney&#x27;s, were &quot;a far cry from the militancy of their American peers&quot;, he continues, &quot;what was revolutionary was the sonic carpet that enveloped the ears and sent the listener spinning into other realms.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic considers the album to be a refinement of &quot;Revolver&quot; &quot;previously unheard-of level of sophistication and fearless experimentation&quot; and a work that combines a wide range of musical styles yet &quot;Not once does the diversity seem forced&quot;. He concludes: &quot;After &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, there were no rules to follow – rock and pop bands could try anything, for better or worse.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Further public and critical recognition===

&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; sustained its immense popularity into the 21st century while breaking numerous sales records. With certified sales of 5.1 million copies in the UK, as of April 2019, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is the third-best-selling album in UK chart history and the best-selling studio album there. It is one of the most commercially successful albums in the US, where the RIAA certified sales of 11 million copies in 1997. By 2000, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was among the top 20 best-selling albums of all time worldwide. As of 2011, it had sold more than 32 million copies worldwide, making it one of the highest-selling albums of all time.

&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; has topped many &quot;best album&quot; lists. It was voted in first place in Paul Gambaccini&#x27;s 1978 book &quot;Critic&#x27;s Choice: Top 200 Albums&quot;, based on submissions from around 50 British and American critics and broadcasters including Christgau and Marcus, and again in the 1987 edition. In the latter year, it also topped &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of &quot;The 100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years&quot;. In 1994, it was ranked first in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. It was voted best album of all time in the 1998 &quot;Music of the Millennium&quot; poll conducted by HMV and Channel 4, and in the following year&#x27;s expanded survey, which polled 600,000 people across the UK. Among its appearances in other critics&#x27; polls, the album was third in &quot;Q&quot; 2004 list &quot;The Music That Changed the World&quot; and fifth in the same magazine&#x27;s 2005 list &quot;The 40 Greatest Psychedelic Albums of All Time&quot;.

In 1993, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and ten years later it was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry, honouring the work as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number one in the magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, a ranking it retained in the revised list of 2012, and described the album as &quot;the pinnacle of the Beatles&#x27; eight years as recording artists&quot;. The editors also said that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was &quot;the most important rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll album ever made&quot;, a point to which June Skinner Sawyers adds, in her 2006 collection of essays &quot;Read the Beatles&quot;: &quot;It has been called the most famous album in the history of popular music. It is certainly among the most written about. It is still being written about.&quot; On &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; third such list, published in September 2020, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; appears at number 24.

In 2006, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 best albums of all time. Writing that year, Kevin Dettmar described it as &quot;quite simply, the most important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded&quot;. It is featured in Chris Smith&#x27;s 2009 book &quot;101 Albums That Changed Popular Music&quot;, where Smith highlights the album among the most &quot;obvious&quot; choices for inclusion due to its continued commercial success, the wealth of imitative works it inspired, and its ongoing recognition as &quot;a defining moment in the history of music&quot;. In the &quot;NME&quot; 2014 article &quot;25 Albums With the Most Incredible Production&quot;, Emily Barker described &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as &quot;kaleidoscopic&quot; and an &quot;orchestral baroque pop masterpiece the likes of which has rarely been matched since&quot;.

===Adaptations, tributes and anniversary projects===

The Sgt. Pepper mythology was reimagined for the plot of &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. In the animated film, the Beatles travel to Pepperland and rescue Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s band from evildoers, the Blue Meanies. The album inspired the 1974 off-Broadway musical &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band on the Road&quot;, directed by Tom O&#x27;Horgan, and the 1978 film &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, produced by Robert Stigwood. In July 2012, athletes donned Sgt. Pepper uniforms to pay tribute to the Beatles&#x27; album during the opening ceremony of the London Olympics.

&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; has been the subject of many tribute albums, including a multi-artist CD available with the March 2007 issue of &quot;Mojo&quot; and a 2009 live album, &quot;Sgt. Pepper Live&quot;, by Cheap Trick. Other tribute recordings include &quot;Sgt. Pepper Knew My Father&quot;, a multi-artist charity compilation released by the &quot;NME&quot; in 1988; Big Daddy&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s&quot;, which Moore recognises as &quot;the most audacious&quot; of all the interpretations of the Beatles&#x27; LP up to 1997; and the Flaming Lips&#x27; &quot;With a Little Help from My Fwends&quot;, released in 2014. BBC Radio 2 broadcast &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s 40th Anniversary&quot; in June 2007. The programme contained new versions of the songs by artists such as Oasis, the Killers and Kaiser Chiefs, produced by Emerick using EMI&#x27;s original four-track recording equipment.

The 1987 CD release attracted considerable media interest and coincided with a Granada TV documentary, &quot;It Was Twenty Years Ago Today&quot;, that located the album at the centre of the Summer of Love.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jensen/UPI&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The reissue peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and topped &quot;Billboard&quot; CDs chart. The album&#x27;s 25th anniversary was observed with &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; presentation of Martin&#x27;s TV documentary &quot;The Making of Sgt. Pepper&quot;, which included interviews with the three surviving Beatles. Although there was no official campaign for the 30th anniversary, BBC Radio 2 broadcast &quot;Pepper Forever&quot; in the UK and some 12,000 schools across the US listened to a radio special dedicated to the album on 2 June 1997. Aside from Radio 2&#x27;s June 2007 project, the 40th anniversary was marked by the University of Leeds hosting a meeting of British and American commentators to debate the extent of the album&#x27;s social and cultural impact.
On 26 May 2017, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; was reissued for the album&#x27;s 50th anniversary as a six-disc box set. The first CD contains a new stereo remix of the album, created by Giles Martin using first-generation tapes rather than their subsequent mixdowns. Apple Corps produced the TV documentary &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Musical Revolution&quot; to commemorate the anniversary, which was also celebrated with posters, billboards and other decorations in cities around the world. In Liverpool, the anniversary was the focus of a three-week cultural festival that included events dedicated to each of the album&#x27;s thirteen songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kennedy/Guardian&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the festival, Mark Morris choreographed &quot;Pepperland&quot; to four of the songs from &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, arranged by Ethan Iverson, plus six original compositions by Iverson, and a dawn-to-dusk celebration of Indian music was held in recognition of Harrison&#x27;s absorption in the genre. The 50th anniversary edition of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; topped the UK Albums Chart.

<doc id="65452" wikidata="Q734727" url="?curid=65452" title="Galangal">
<text>Galangal () is a common name for several tropical rhizomatous spices.

==Differentiation==
The word &quot;galangal&quot;, or its variant &quot;galanga&quot; or archaically &quot;galingale&quot;, can refer in common usage to the aromatic rhizome of any of four plant species in the Zingiberaceae (ginger) family, namely:
* &quot;Alpinia galanga&quot;, also called &quot;greater galangal&quot;, &quot;lengkuas&quot;, &quot;Siamese ginger&quot; or &quot;laos&quot;
* &quot;Alpinia officinarum&quot;, or &quot;lesser galangal&quot;
* &quot;Boesenbergia rotunda&quot;, also called &quot;Chinese ginger&quot; or &quot;fingerroot&quot;
* &quot;Kaempferia galanga&quot;, also called &quot;kencur&quot;, &quot;black galangal&quot; or &quot;sand ginger&quot;

The term &quot;galingale&quot; is sometimes also used for the rhizome of the unrelated &quot;sweet cyperus&quot; (&quot;Cyperus longus&quot;), traditionally used as a folk medicine in Europe.

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===

Various galangal rhizomes are used in traditional Southeast Asian cuisine, such as Khmer kroeung (Cambodian paste), Thai and Lao tom yum and tom kha gai soups, Vietnamese Huế cuisine (tré) and throughout Indonesian cuisine, as in soto and opor. Polish Żołądkowa Gorzka vodka is flavoured with galangal. While all species of galangal are closely related to common ginger, each is unique in its own right. Due to their unique taste and &#x27;hotness&#x27; profiles, the individual varieties are usually distinguished from ginger, and from each other, in traditional Asian dishes. The taste of galangal has been variously described as &quot;flowery&quot;, &quot;like ginger with cardamom&quot; and &quot;like peppery cinnamon&quot;. Lesser galangal was popular in European medieval cooking.

Galangals are commonly available in Asian markets in a variety of forms: as whole fresh rhizomes; dried and sliced; and powdered.

=== Medical ===

In ethnobotany, galangal has been used for its purported merits in promoting digestion and alleviating respiratory diseases and stomach problems. Specific medical virtues have been attributed to each galangal variety.

<doc id="65453" wikidata="Q601521" url="?curid=65453" title="Rickey Henderson">
<text>Rickey Nelson Henley Henderson (December 25, 1958 – December 20, 2024), nicknamed &quot;Man of Steal&quot;, was an American professional baseball left fielder who played 25 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for nine teams from 1979 to 2003, including four separate tenures with his original team, the Oakland Athletics. He is widely regarded as baseball&#x27;s greatest leadoff hitter and baserunner. He holds MLB records for career stolen bases, runs, unintentional walks, and leadoff home runs. At the time of his last major league game in 2003, the 10-time American League (AL) All-Star ranked among the sport&#x27;s top 100 all-time home run hitters and was its all-time leader in walks. In 2009, he was inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.

Henderson holds the single-season record for stolen bases (130 in 1982) and is the only player in AL history to steal 100 bases in a season, having done so three times (in 1980, 1982, and 1983). His 1,406 career steals is 50% higher than the previous record of 938 by Lou Brock. Henderson is the all-time stolen base leader for the Oakland Athletics and previously held the New York Yankees&#x27; franchise record from 1988 to 2011. He was among the league&#x27;s top ten base stealers in 21 different seasons.

Henderson was named the AL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1990, and he was twice the lead-off hitter for World Series champions: the 1989 Oakland Athletics and the 1993 Toronto Blue Jays. A 12-time stolen base champion, Henderson led the league in runs five times. His 25-season career elevated him to the top ten in several other categories, including career at-bats, games, and outfield putouts and total chances. His high on-base percentage, power hitting, and stolen base and run totals made him one of the most dominant and innovative players of all time. He was further known for his passion for playing baseball and a buoyant, eccentric, and quotable personality that both perplexed and entertained fans. Once asked if he thought Henderson was a future Hall of Famer, statistician Bill James replied, &quot;If you could split him in two, you&#x27;d have two Hall of Famers.&quot;

==Early life==
Henderson was born on December 25, 1958, in Chicago in the back seat of an Oldsmobile on the way to the hospital. Henderson later joked, &quot;I was already fast. I couldn&#x27;t wait.&quot; The son of John L. Henley and Bobbie Henley, he was named Rickey Nelson Henley, after singer-actor Ricky Nelson. When he was two years old, his father moved to Oakland, California. Rickey lived with his grandmother in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, from when he was two until he was seven, when he migrated to Oakland with his family. His father died in an automobile accident 10 years after leaving home. His mother married Paul Henderson in Rickey Henley&#x27;s junior year of high school and the family adopted the Henderson surname. As a child learning to play baseball in Oakland, Henderson developed the ability to bat right-handed although he was a naturally left-handed thrower—a rare combination for baseball players, especially non-pitchers. In the entire history of Major League Baseball through the 2008 season, only 57 position players are known to have batted right and thrown left, and Henderson is easily the most successful player to do so. Henderson later said, &quot;All my friends were right-handed and swung from the right side, so I thought that&#x27;s the way it was supposed to be done.&quot;

In 1976, Henderson graduated from Oakland Technical High School in Oakland, California, where he played baseball, basketball and football, and was an All-American running back with two 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He also ran track, but did not stay with the team as the schedule conflicted with baseball. Henderson received over a dozen scholarship offers to play football. Despite a childhood dream to play for the Oakland Raiders, he turned down the scholarships on the advice of his mother, who argued that football players had shorter careers.

==Minor leagues==
Henderson was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the fourth round of the 1976 Major League Baseball draft. For the first season of his minor league career he was with the Boise A&#x27;s of the Northwest League. In 46 games, he batted .336 and hit three home runs and two triples. Henderson spent the following season with the Modesto A&#x27;s, where he batted .345 in 134 games during a record-setting season. Henderson, along with Darrell Woodard, nearly broke the league record for team stolen bases. The Modesto A&#x27;s finished the season with 357 stolen bases, just shy of the league record of 370. While Woodard tied the single-season player record with 90 stolen bases, Henderson beat the record by stealing 95 bases, and was awarded the Sundial Trophy, given to the Modesto A&#x27;s Most Valuable Player.

Henderson spent the 1978 season with the Jersey City A&#x27;s of the Eastern League. After the minor league season ended, he played the 1978–1979 winter season for the Navojoa Mayos of the Mexican Pacific League. He played in six games for the team, which won its first championship. In 1979, Henderson started the season with the Ogden A&#x27;s of the Pacific Coast League. In 71 games for Ogden, he had a batting average of .309 and stole 44 bases.

==Major leagues==
===Oakland Athletics (1979–1984)===
Henderson made his major league debut with Oakland on June 24, 1979, getting two hits in four at-bats, along with a stolen base. He batted .274 with 33 stolen bases in 89 games. In 1980, Henderson became the third modern-era player to steal 100 bases in a season (Maury Wills 104 in 1962 and Lou Brock&#x27;s 118 in 1974 had preceded him). His 100 steals broke Eddie Collins&#x27; franchise record of 81 in 1910 with what were then the Philadelphia Athletics and set a new American League (AL) record, surpassing Ty Cobb&#x27;s 96 set in 1915. He also batted .303, had 179 hits (tied for ninth in AL), scored 111 runs (fourth in AL), drew 117 walks (second in AL), had a .420 on-base percentage (third in AL) and led the AL by reaching base 301 times.

That winter, Henderson played in the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League; his 42 stolen bases broke that league&#x27;s record as well.

Henderson was an MVP candidate a year later, in a season shortened by a players&#x27; strike. He hit .319, fourth in the AL, and led the league in hits (135), runs (89) and in steals (56). Henderson was also third in on-base percentage (.408), tied for second in triples (7), fourth in walks (64), eighth in total bases (185) and second in times reaching base (201). In so doing, he became the emblematic figure of Oakland manager Billy Martin&#x27;s aggressive &quot;Billy Ball&quot; philosophy, which received much media attention. Finishing second to the Milwaukee Brewers&#x27; Rollie Fingers in the MVP voting, Henderson earned his only Gold Glove Award in fielding that season. He later became known for his showboat &quot;snatch catches&quot;, in which he would flick his glove out at incoming fly balls, then whip his arm behind his back after making the catch.

In 1982, Henderson broke Lou Brock&#x27;s modern major league single season record by stealing 130 bases, a total which has not been approached since. He stole 84 bases by the All-Star break; no player has stolen as many as 84 bases in an entire season since 1988, when Henderson himself stole 93. He also led the AL in walks (116), was fourth in runs (119) and third in on-base percentage (.398).

Inspired by Dodgers leadoff hitter Rudy Law, Henderson adopted an exaggerated crouch as his batting stance, which reduced his strike zone without sacrificing much power. Sportswriter Jim Murray described Henderson&#x27;s strike zone as being &quot;smaller than Hitler&#x27;s heart&quot;. In 1982, he described his approach to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;:

Regarding Henderson&#x27;s 1982 season, the mid-1980s book &quot;The Hidden Game of Baseball&quot; looked at such statistics as .78 expected runs with a runner on first and no outs, 1.07 expected runs with runner on second and no outs, and only .25 expected runs with no one on and one out. The authors concluded that with Henderson&#x27;s 130 stolen bases he contributed 22.2 runs to the A&#x27;s offense. By being caught stealing 42 times, he cost his team 20.6 runs, and therefore, the authors concluded, the net effect of his running activity was merely 1.6 extra runs for the season. A later analysis determined his net contribution was 5.3 runs for the season.

In 1983, he led the AL in stolen bases (108), walks (103) while finishing fourth in runs scored (105). He was also second in on-base percentage (.414), tied for ninth in triples (7) and fifth in times on base, reaching 257 times.

In 1984, Henderson hit 16 home runs while leading the league in stolen bases (66), finishing second in runs scored (113) and third in on-base-percentage (.399). After the season, he was traded to the New York Yankees along with Bert Bradley for five players: Tim Birtsas, Jay Howell, Stan Javier, Eric Plunk, and José Rijo.

===New York Yankees (1985–1989)===
In his first season with the Yankees, Henderson led the league in runs scored (146) and stolen bases (80), was fourth in batting average (.314), walks (99) and on-base percentage (.419), seventh in slugging (.516), third in OPS (.934). Combining his stolen bases with his 24 home runs, he became the first AL player to join the 20–50 club, and its first member to reach 20–80. He also won the Silver Slugger Award, and was third in the voting for the MVP award. His 146 runs scored were the most since Ted Williams had 150 in 1950, and he became the first player since Jimmie Foxx in 1939 to amass more runs scored than games played. Henderson also became the first player in major league history to reach 80 stolen bases and 20 home runs in the same season. He matched the feat in 1986, as did Eric Davis of the Cincinnati Reds; they remain the only players in major league history to reach those thresholds. It was with the Yankees that Henderson, who had previously worn number 35 with Oakland, which was already taken by his Yankees teammate Phil Niekro, switched to his now famous 24, a number he would wear for the rest of his career (with exceptions: (1) he briefly wore number 14 in 1993 while playing with the Blue Jays, (2) he wore his &quot;old&quot; number 35 in 2000 and 2002 while playing with the Mariners and the Red Sox, and (3) he wore number 25 while playing with the Dodgers).

In 1986, he led the AL in runs scored (130) and stolen bases (87) for the second year in a row, and was seventh in walks (89) and extra base hits (64) while hitting 28 home runs (9 of which led off games) and recording a career-high 74 runs batted in (RBIs).

In 1987, he had a below-average season by his standards, fueling criticism from the New York media, which had never covered Henderson or his eccentricities kindly. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner issued a press release claiming that manager Lou Piniella wanted to trade Henderson for &quot;jaking it&quot; (playing lackadaisically). Still, Henderson had his best on-base percentage to that point in his career (.423), with a .291 batting avg., was fifth in the AL in stolen bases (41) and hit 17 home runs despite playing only 95 games. It was the only season from 1980 to 1991 in which Henderson did not lead the AL in steals. Seattle&#x27;s Harold Reynolds led the league with 60 steals; Reynolds tells the story of getting an impish phone call from Henderson after the season:

The phone rings. &quot;Henderson here.&quot; I say, &quot;Hey, what&#x27;s going on, Rickey?&quot; I think he&#x27;s calling to congratulate me, but he goes, &#x27;&quot;&quot;Sixty&quot; stolen bases? You ought to be ashamed. Rickey would have 60 at the break&quot;... then click, he hung up.

In 1988, Henderson led the AL in steals (93), was third in runs scored (118), fifth in OBP (.394) and seventh in walks (82), while hitting .305. Though only in New York for seasons, Henderson set the Yankees&#x27; franchise record with 326 stolen bases; the previous high (248) had been held by Hal Chase, who last played for the Yankees in 1913, when the team was still known as the Highlanders. On May 28, 2011, Henderson&#x27;s total was surpassed by Derek Jeter, who by that point had already played 1,700 more games as a Yankee than Henderson.

===Return to Oakland (1989–1993)===
On June 21, 1989, the Yankees traded Henderson back to Oakland for Plunk, Greg Cadaret, and Luis Polonia. After the trade, his 52 steals and 72 runs scored led the Athletics into the postseason; his 126 walks for the year were the most for any AL hitter since Frank Howard&#x27;s 132 in 1970. Henderson was named MVP of the 1989 American League Championship Series (ALCS) after hitting .400, scoring eight runs and delivering two home runs, five RBIs, seven walks and a 1.000 slugging percentage. He had eight stolen bases in the five-game series, breaking Brock&#x27;s postseason series record of seven, which he set in 1967 and repeated in 1968. Leading the Athletics to a four-game sweep over the San Francisco Giants and the franchise&#x27;s first World Series title since 1974, Henderson hit .474 with an .895 slugging average (including two triples and a homer), while stealing three more bases. On August 22, 1989, he became Nolan Ryan&#x27;s 5,000th strikeout victim, but Henderson took an odd delight in the occurrence, saying, &quot;If you haven&#x27;t been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you&#x27;re nobody.&quot;

A year later, Henderson finished second in the league in batting average with a mark of .325, losing out to the Kansas City Royals&#x27; George Brett on the final day of the season. Henderson had a remarkably consistent season, with his batting average falling below .320 for only one game, the third of the year. Reaching safely by a hit or a walk in 125 of his 136 games, he led the league in runs (119), stolen bases (65), on-base percentage (.439) and OPS (1.016) was second in slugging percentage (.577), fourth in walks (97) and extra base hits (66), sixth in home runs (28) and total bases (282) and had 61 RBIs. Henderson won the AL&#x27;s MVP award and helped Oakland to another pennant. He again performed well in the World Series (.333 batting, .667 slugging, a home run and three steals in four games), but the A&#x27;s were swept by the underdog Cincinnati Reds.

On May 1, 1991, Henderson broke one of baseball&#x27;s most noted records when he stole the 939th base of his career, one more than Brock&#x27;s total compiled from 1961 to 1979, mainly with the St. Louis Cardinals. After his historic achievement, Henderson shouted out: &quot;I&#x27;m the Greatest&quot;.

On July 16, 1993, Henderson broke the world stolen base record by stealing his 1,066th base, breaking the record held by Yutaka Fukumoto. In 90 games with Oakland, he was batting .327 with 17 home runs and 47 RBIs. He also had scored 77 runs, stolen 31 bases, drew 85 walks, had a .469 on-base percentage and was slugging .553.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1993)===
In July 1993, the Athletics traded Henderson to the playoff-bound Toronto Blue Jays for Steve Karsay and José Herrera. He performed disappointingly for the Jays, hitting only .215 in 44 games, which was probably due to the fact that he fractured a bone on his hand early on with the team, after being hit by a pitch, although he still contributed 22 stolen bases and 37 runs scored. However, his hitting woes continued in the post-season, batting .120 in the American League Championship Series and .227 in the World Series. Nevertheless, Henderson was involved in the final play of the World Series that year. He and Paul Molitor scored on Joe Carter&#x27;s Series-ending home run, one of the most famous moments in baseball history.

===Third stint with Oakland (1994–1995)===
After the 1993 season, Henderson re-signed as a free agent with Oakland in December 1993. In 1994 and 1995, Henderson finished in the top 10 in the league in walks, steals and on-base percentage. His .300 average in 1995 marked his sixth and final season in the AL with a .300 or better average.

===San Diego Padres (1996–1997)===
Henderson signed with the San Diego Padres in the offseason. In 1996, he again finished in the top ten in the National League (NL) in walks, OBP, steals and runs.

===Anaheim Angels (1997)===
On August 13, 1997, the Padres traded Henderson to the Anaheim Angels for minor leaguers Ryan Hancock and Stevenson Agosto, as well as a player to be named later. The Padres acquired George Arias to complete the trade. As an Angel, Henderson batted only .183 for the rest of the season.

===Fourth stint with Oakland (1998)===
In January 1998, Henderson signed as a free agent with the Athletics, the fourth time he played for the franchise. That season he led the majors in stolen bases (66) and the AL in walks (118), while scoring 101 runs. In so doing, the 39-year-old became the oldest player to lead a league in stolen bases, and the oldest player to reach 50 steals.

===New York Mets (1999–2000)===
In 1999, he was seventh in the NL in on-base percentage. Henderson was voted the 1999 National League comeback player of the year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. He wore number 24, which—although not officially retired—had not been regularly worn by a Mets player since Willie Mays&#x27; retirement in 1973. Nonetheless, Henderson and the Mets were an uneasy fit. After the Mets&#x27; loss in the 1999 NLCS, the New York press made much of a card game between Henderson and Bobby Bonilla. Both players had been substituted out of the lineup, and they reportedly left the dugout before the playoff game had concluded.

Henderson sought a raise on his $1.9 million salary for the 2000 season, but the Mets refused to renegotiate. He also feuded with manager Bobby Valentine and complained about traveling to Tokyo for the 2000 season opening series against the Chicago Cubs. Worse, he put in minimal effort, effectively tanking, and forcing his release. Henderson batted .219 with no home runs and two RBIs. The Mets offered him to every team in the league, with no takers. The team then put him on waivers and granted him his release in May, which Mets&#x27; general manager Steve Phillips called &quot;addition by subtraction&quot;.

===Seattle Mariners (2000)===
After his release from the Mets, Henderson signed as a free agent with the Seattle Mariners. In his second game as a Mariner, on May 20, Henderson hit a leadoff home run, thus becoming the third player to hit a home run in four different decades (Ted Williams and Willie McCovey were the others). Despite starting the season in the National League, Henderson finished fourth in the AL in stolen bases (31).

===Return to San Diego (2001)===

A free agent in March 2001, Henderson returned to the Padres. During the 2001 season, he broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone. He broke Babe Ruth&#x27;s record of 2,062 career walks, Ty Cobb&#x27;s record of 2,245 career runs, and Zack Wheat&#x27;s record of 2,328 career games in left field, and on the final day of the season (October 7) collected his 3,000th career hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson in San Diego. That final game was also Tony Gwynn&#x27;s last major league game, and Henderson had originally wanted to sit out so as not to detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play.

===Boston Red Sox (2002)===

At age 43, Henderson was the oldest player in the American League.

While playing in Boston, Henderson wore his old number 35, as his regular number 24 was already taken by Red Sox teammate Manny Ramirez.

===Newark Bears and Los Angeles Dodgers (2003)===
As the 2003 season began, Henderson was without a team for the first time in his career. He played in the independent Atlantic League with the Newark Bears, hoping for a chance with another major league organization. After being named the Atlantic League All-Star Game MVP, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed him in July. In 30 games with the Dodgers, he had 15 hits and three stolen bases, with a .208 batting average.

In 60 postseason games, including 3 World Series (1989, &#x27;90, and &#x27;93), Henderson batted .284 (63-for-222) with 47 runs scored, 12 doubles, 4 triples, 5 home runs, 20 RBI, 33 stolen bases, 37 walks, .389 on-base percentage, .441 slugging percentage, and .831 on-base plus slugging percentage.

===Retirement===

Before the 2003 season, his last in the majors, Henderson discussed his reputation for hanging onto his lengthy baseball career:

Henderson played his last major league game on September 19, 2003; he was hit by a pitch in his only plate appearance, and came around to score his 2,295th run. Though it became increasingly unlikely that he would return, he continued to publicly debate his own official retirement. After leaving the Dodgers, Henderson started his second consecutive season with the Newark Bears in May 2004. In 91 games he had a .462 OBP, with more than twice as many walks (96) as strikeouts (41), and stole 37 bases while being caught only twice. On May 9, 2005, Henderson signed with the San Diego Surf Dawgs of the Golden Baseball League, an independent league. This was the Surf Dawgs&#x27; and the Golden Baseball League&#x27;s inaugural season, and Henderson helped the team to the league championship. In 73 games he had a .456 OBP, with 73 walks while striking out 43 times, and 16 steals while being caught only twice. It would be his final professional season.

Henderson would not accept the end of his major league career. In May 2005, he was still insisting that he was capable of playing in the major leagues. NBC and ESPN reported that Henderson had announced his much-delayed official retirement on December 6, 2005, but his agent denied the report the following day. On February 10, 2006, he accepted a position as a hitting instructor for the Mets, while leaving the door open to returning as a player. In July 2006, Henderson discussed an offer he&#x27;d received to rejoin the Surf Dawgs for the 2006 season, which would have been his 31st in professional baseball, but suggested he&#x27;d had enough. Six weeks later, though, on August 11, he claimed &quot;It&#x27;s sort of weird not to be playing, but I decided to take a year off&quot;, adding, &quot;I can&#x27;t say I will retire. My heart is still in it... I still love the game right now, so I&#x27;m going to wait it out and see what happens.&quot;

On May 18, 2007, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided it did not &quot;infringe on the integrity of the roster or of the season&quot;, so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A&#x27;s player. A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, &quot;One day? I don&#x27;t want one day. I want to play again, man. I don&#x27;t want nobody&#x27;s spot... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there. If I don&#x27;t, just get rid of me, release me. And if I belong, you don&#x27;t have to pay me but the minimum—and I&#x27;ll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how&#x27;s that hurtin&#x27; anybody?... Don&#x27;t say goodbye for me... When I want that one day they want to give me so bad, I&#x27;ll let you know.&quot; The Athletics retired Henderson&#x27;s #24 on August 1, 2009.

Henderson finally conceded his &quot;official retirement&quot; on July 13, 2007: &quot;I haven&#x27;t submitted retirement papers to MLB, but I think MLB already had their papers that I was retired.&quot; Characteristically, he added, &quot;If it was a situation where we were going to win the World Series and I was the only player that they had left, I would put on the shoes.&quot;

Contrary to speculation, Henderson&#x27;s refusal to officially retire had not been delaying his eligibility for Hall of Fame induction. Since the 1970s, the five-year waiting period has been based on major league service only. Henderson was elected as part of the 2009 Hall of Fame vote, in his first appearance on the ballot. At a press conference two days after his election, the 50-year-old Henderson told reporters, &quot;I believe today, and people say I&#x27;m crazy, but if you gave me as many at-bats that you would give the runners out there today, I would outsteal every last one of them ... they can always ring my phone and I&#x27;ll come on down and help their ballclub, that&#x27;s how much I love the game.&quot;

In 2011, on the 20th anniversary of his record-breaking stolen base, the Oakland A&#x27;s held &quot;Rickey Henderson Bobblehead Day&quot;. At Henderson&#x27;s insistence, the giveaway plastic dolls had one atypical modification: &quot;I told them, put a little dirt on mine, make sure that [it looks] like I&#x27;m playing the game.&quot; Almost eight years after his final game, Henderson also reiterated his desire to return: &quot;Sometimes when I sit around and look at the game and things ain&#x27;t going right, I just think, &#x27;Just let me put on the uniform and go out there and take a chance&#x27;.&quot;

===Coaching===
The New York Mets hired Henderson as a special instructor in 2006, primarily to work with hitters and to teach base stealing. Henderson&#x27;s impact was noticeable on José Reyes, the Mets&#x27; former leadoff hitter. &quot;I always want to be around the game,&quot; Henderson said in May 2007. &quot;That&#x27;s something that&#x27;s in my blood. Helping them have success feels just as good.&quot;

On July 13, 2007, the Mets promoted Henderson from special instructor to first base coach, replacing Howard Johnson, who became the hitting coach. Henderson was not retained as a coach for 2008. Henderson had periodically been a special instructor in the Athletics&#x27; spring training camps. In 2010, he worked on base stealing (most notably with Rajai Davis and Coco Crisp) and outfield drills.

==Image and personality==
&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Tom Verducci wrote in 2003, &quot;There are certain figures in American history who have passed into the realm of cultural mythology, as if reality could no longer contain their stories: Johnny Appleseed. Wild Bill Hickok. Davy Crockett. Rickey Henderson. They exist on the sometimes narrow margin between Fact and Fiction.&quot;

Henderson referred to himself in the third-person.

According to Verducci, during one off-season, Henderson called Padres general manager Kevin Towers and left this message: &quot;Kevin, this is Rickey. Calling on behalf of Rickey. Rickey wants to play baseball.&quot; However, Henderson denied that this happened in a February 26, 2009, interview on Mike and Mike in the Morning. In 2003, he discussed his unusual phraseology, saying, &quot;People are always saying, &#x27;Rickey says Rickey.&#x27; But it&#x27;s been blown way out of proportion. Rickey says it when Rickey doesn&#x27;t do what Rickey needs to be doing. Rickey uses it to remind himself, like, &#x27;Rickey, what you doing, you stupid. ... &#x27; Rickey&#x27;s just scolding himself.&quot; Henderson did use the first person pronoun on occasion, such as when he defended his position during a contract dispute: &quot;All I&#x27;m asking for is what I want.&quot;

Henderson was so proud of a $1 million signing bonus that he framed it instead of cashing it, thus losing several months&#x27; interest. Similarly, Henderson refused to spend his per diem money that all players receive on road trips: instead, he would put the envelopes containing the cash in a box, and when one of his children performed well in school he would invite them to choose an envelope out of the box and keep its contents. In 2002, following an argument with pitcher Orlando Hernández, Henderson stated, &quot;He needs to grow up a little bit. I ain&#x27;t a kid. When I broke into the game, he was crawling on his hands and knees. Unless he&#x27;s as old as I am. He probably is.&quot; (Hernández is approximately seven years younger.)

Henderson had a reputation for forgetting or not learning people&#x27;s names, including those of his teammates.

There are many unconfirmed stories about Henderson. A Padres teammate (variously reported as Steve Finley or Tony Gwynn) once offered him a seat anywhere on the bus, saying that Henderson had tenure. Henderson supposedly replied, &quot;Ten years? What are you talking about? Rickey got 16, 17 years.&quot; One widely reported story was a fabrication that began as a clubhouse joke made by a visiting player. While playing for Seattle in 2000, Henderson was said to have commented on first baseman John Olerud&#x27;s practice of wearing a batting helmet while playing defense, noting that a former teammate in Toronto did the same thing. Olerud was reported to have replied, &quot;That was me.&quot; The two men had been together the previous season with the 1999 Mets, as well as with the 1993 World Champion Blue Jays. Several news outlets originally reported the story as fact.

Verducci wrote, &quot;Rickey is the modern-day Yogi Berra, only faster.&quot; Henderson himself was resigned to his persona: &quot;A lot of stuff they had me doing or something they said I had created, it&#x27;s comedy. I guess that&#x27;s how they want to judge me, as a character.&quot;

A bobblehead of Henderson as an Athletic appeared in &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
In 1983, Henderson married his high-school sweetheart, Pamela. They had three children.

Henderson died on December 20, 2024, five days before his 66th birthday, at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center following a bout of pneumonia. According to Dave Stewart, Henderson, who was asthmatic and endured related sinus issues, had originally been admitted to the hospital that day for a related surgery, but never recovered from the operation and eventually died; news of Henderson&#x27;s death spread that evening on X as an unconfirmed rumor, but was not confirmed by his family in the media until the following day.

==Legacy==


On May 1, 1991, Henderson stole his 939th base to pass Lou Brock and became the sport&#x27;s all-time stolen base leader. Henderson&#x27;s speech after breaking Brock&#x27;s record was similar to the standard victory or award speech. He thanked God and his mother, as well as the people that helped him in baseball. Because his idol was Muhammad Ali, Henderson decided to use the words &quot;greatest of all time.&quot; These words have since been taken by many to support the notion that Henderson is selfish and arrogant, although years later, Henderson revealed that he had gone over his planned remarks ahead of time with Brock, and the Cardinals Hall of Famer &quot;had no problem with it. In fact, he helped me write what I was going to say that day.&quot; On the day of the speech, Brock later told reporters amiably, &quot;He spoke from his heart.&quot; Brock and Henderson had had a friendly relationship ever since their first meeting in 1981. Brock pronounced the young speedster as the heir to his record, saying, &quot;How are we gonna break it?&quot;

Henderson has mixed feelings about his comments:

At the end of his July 2009 Hall of Fame induction, Henderson alluded to his earlier speech, saying:

Asked if he believes the passage of time will improve his reputation, Henderson said:

Henderson had 468 more stolen bases in his career than Brock, one short of 50% more than the game&#x27;s second-most prolific basestealer. In 1993, Henderson stole his 1,066th base, surpassing the world record established ten years earlier by Yutaka Fukumoto for the Hankyu Braves in Japan&#x27;s Pacific League. In his prime, Henderson had a virtual monopoly on the stolen base title in the American League. Between 1980 and 1991, he led the league in steals every season except 1987, when he missed part of the season due to a nagging hamstring injury, allowing Mariners second baseman Harold Reynolds to win the title. Henderson had one more league-leading season after that stretch, when his 66 steals in 1998 made him the oldest steals leader in baseball history. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Henderson also owns the record for times caught stealing (335). Due to incomplete historical recordkeeping for that statistic, though, it is unknown whether he is the actual career leader. However, Henderson&#x27;s overall 81% success rate on the basepaths is among the highest percentages in history. (Carlos Beltran ranks first among players with at least 300 career attempts, at just over 86%.)

On July 29, 1989, Henderson stole five bases against the Mariners&#x27; left-handed Randy Johnson, his career high, and one shy of the single-game major league record. Unusually, Henderson was hitless in the game (he had four walks). Henderson had 18 four-steal games during his career. In August 1983, in a three-game series against the Brewers and a 2-game series versus the Yankees, Henderson had 13 stolen bases in five games. Baltimore Orioles third baseman Floyd Rayford described the confusion he felt during a particular game, when Henderson was leading off first base and signaling him with two fingers. Henderson quickly stole second base, then third, and Rayford understood the gesture.

Longtime scout Charlie Metro remembered the havoc caused by Henderson: &#x27;&quot;I did a lot of study and I found that it&#x27;s impossible to throw Rickey Henderson out. I started using stopwatches and everything. I found it was impossible to throw some other guys out also. They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey&#x27;s can&#x27;t be thrown out, and he&#x27;s proven it.&quot;

Sportswrite Joe Posnanski marveled that Henderson had 796 career walks when leading off an inning:

Henderson was a headfirst slider. In September 2008, Henderson discussed his base-stealing technique at length with &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;:

I wanted to know how to dive into the base because I was getting strawberries on my knees and strawberries on my ass... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [low-to-the-ground] technique from airplanes... I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you&#x27;re running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn&#x27;t no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn&#x27;t have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think.Padres closer Trevor Hoffman said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to put into words how fortunate I was to spend time around one of the icons of the game. I can&#x27;t comprehend that yet. Years from now, though, I&#x27;ll be able to say I played with Rickey Henderson, and I imagine it will be like saying I played with Babe Ruth.&quot; When Henderson was 44 years old and playing for the Newark Bears in 2003, Padres general manager Kevin Towers said, &quot;I get e-mails daily from fans saying, &#x27;Sign Rickey.&#x27;... I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody... We&#x27;ve had some special players come through San Diego. But there&#x27;s an aura about him nobody else has.&quot;

Tony La Russa, Henderson&#x27;s manager in the late 1980s in Oakland, said, &quot;He rises to the occasion—the big moment—better than anybody I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Coach Rene Lachemann said, &quot;If you&#x27;re one run down, there&#x27;s nobody you&#x27;d ever rather have up at the plate than Rickey.&quot; Teammate Mitchell Page said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t until I saw Rickey that I understood what baseball was about. Rickey Henderson is a run, man. That&#x27;s it. When you see Rickey Henderson, I don&#x27;t care when, the score&#x27;s already 1–0. If he&#x27;s with you, that&#x27;s great. If he&#x27;s not, you won&#x27;t like it.&quot;

A&#x27;s pitching coach Dave Duncan said of Henderson, &quot;You have to be careful because he can knock one out. But you don&#x27;t want to be too careful because he&#x27;s got a small strike zone and you can&#x27;t afford to walk him. And that&#x27;s only half the problem. When he gets on base he&#x27;s more trouble still.&quot; Sportswriter Tom Verducci wrote, &quot;Baseball is designed to be an egalitarian sort of game in which one player among the 18 is not supposed to dominate... Yet in the past quarter-century Henderson and Barry Bonds have come closest to dominating a baseball game the way Michael Jordan could a basketball game.&quot;

In July 2007, &quot;New York Sun&quot; sportswriter Tim Marchman posited that Henderson&#x27;s accomplishments were &quot;not because of his body, but because of his brain&quot;. He praised his ability to detect if a pitcher was throwing to first or home plate, and his discipline to coax walks as a means to get on base. Added Marchman:

===Career milestones===

, Henderson ranks first all-time in runs scored (2,295) and stolen bases (1,406), fourth in career games played (3,081), 13th in at bats (10,961), and 26th in hits (3,055). He has the second-highest career power–speed number, behind Barry Bonds, at 490.4. Henderson reached 20+ homers and 50+ steals in the same season a record four times. His record for most career walks (2,190) has since been broken by Barry Bonds; Henderson is now second but continues to hold the record for most unintentional walks (2,129). While his career batting average of .279 is considered somewhat modest for a leadoff hitter, his walks helped him post a stout .401 on-base percentage (OBP) for his career. He posted an OBP of at least .400 in 16 separate seasons, with a high mark of .439 in his 1990 MVP season. Henderson averaged 115 walks per 162 games over his career.

Henderson also holds the record for most home runs to lead off a game, with 81; George Springer is second with 60 going into the 2025 season. During the 2003 season, Henderson surpassed Babe Ruth for the career record in secondary bases (total bases compiled from extra base hits, walks, stolen bases, and times hit by pitch). In 1993, he led off both games of a doubleheader with homers. At the time of his last major league game, Henderson was still in the all-time top 100 home run hitters, with 297. Bill James wrote in 2000, &quot;Without exaggerating one inch, you could find fifty Hall of Famers who, all taken together, don&#x27;t own as many records, and as many &quot;important&quot; records, as Rickey Henderson.&quot;

Henderson&#x27;s record for the most postseason stolen bases was broken by Kenny Lofton&#x27;s 34th career steal during the 2007 ALCS; Henderson is the only American League player to steal more than 100 bases in a single season (having accomplished the feat three times), and he is the all-time stolen base leader for the Oakland A&#x27;s.

In 1999, before breaking the career records for runs scored and walks, Henderson was ranked number 51 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2005, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; updated their 100 Greatest Players list, and Henderson had inched up to number 50. On January 12, 2009, Henderson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot, receiving 94.8% of the vote. This was the 13th highest percentage in major league history.

Asked to choose the best player in history, Henderson declined, saying, &quot;There are guys who have done different things very well, but I don&#x27;t know of anyone who mastered everything.&quot; Offered the chance to assess his own placement among the game&#x27;s greats, he said, &quot;I haven&#x27;t mastered the homers or RBI. The little things, I probably mastered.&quot; Of his various records and achievements, he values his career-runs-scored mark the most: &quot;You have to score to win.&quot;

<doc id="65456" wikidata="Q8709" url="?curid=65456" title="London Stansted Airport">
<text>Stansted Airport is an international airport serving London, the capital of England and the United Kingdom. It is located near Stansted Mountfitchet, Uttlesford, Essex, northeast of Central London.

As London&#x27;s third-busiest airport, Stansted serves over 180 destinations across Europe, Asia and North Africa. London Stansted is a base for a number of European low-cost carriers. This includes being the largest base for low-cost airline Ryanair, with over 150 destinations served by the airline. , it is the fourth-busiest airport in the United Kingdom after Heathrow, Gatwick, and Manchester.
During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, it ranked second in the country. Stansted&#x27;s runway is also used by private companies such as the Harrods Aviation, Titan Airways, and XJet terminals, which are private ground handlers that can handle private flights, charter flights, and state visits.

Converted to civil use from RAF Stansted Mountfitchet in the late 1940s, Stansted was used by charter airlines. It came under British Airports Authority control in 1966. The privatised
BAA sold Stansted in February 2013 to Manchester Airports Group as a result of a March 2009 ruling by the Competition Commission against BAA&#x27;s monopoly position.

The airport has one main passenger terminal which opened in 1991, with three passenger satellites containing the departure gates. The terminal building was designed by Foster and Partners and is regarded as influential for airport architecture.

From 1997 to 2007, Stansted had rapid expansion of passenger numbers on the back of the boom in low-cost air travel, peaking at 24 million passengers in the 12 months to October 2007, but passenger numbers declined in the next five years. Passenger totals later increased, and in 2016 recorded an annual increase of 8.0% to 24.3 million, and numbers have since continued to rise.

==History==


===Second World War===
The airfield opened in early July 1943 with a dedication ceremony for the Stansted Airfield with a parade of builders, the 825th Engineer Aviation Battalion EAB and the 850th Engineer Aviation Battalion EAB of the United States Army, along with a small group of the British Royal Engineers who offered to help and wanted to learn how to operate the heavy construction equipment. Stansted Mountfitchet Airport was used during the Second World War as RAF Stansted Mountfitchet by the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces as a bomber airfield and as a major maintenance depot. Although the official name was Stansted Mountfitchet, the base was known as simply Stansted in both written and spoken form.

The station was first allocated to the USAAF Eighth Air Force in August 1942 as a heavy-bomber airfield. As well as an operational bomber base, Stansted was also an Air Technical Services Command maintenance and supply depot concerned with major overhauls and modification of B-26s. After D-Day, these activities were transferred to France, but the base was still used as a supply storage area for the support of aircraft on the continent.

===Postwar use===
After the withdrawal of the Americans on 12 August 1945, Stansted was taken over by the Air Ministry and used by No. 263 Maintenance Unit, RAF, for storage purposes. In addition, between March 1946 and August 1947, Stansted was used for housing German prisoners of war.

In November 1946, the recently established British cargo airline, London Aero and Motor Services, equipped with ex-RAF Handley Page Halifaxes, moved into Stansted, using it as a base for its operations until it was wound up in July 1948.

The Ministry of Civil Aviation finally took control of Stansted in 1949 and the airport was then used as a base by several UK charter airlines. The US military returned in 1954 to extend the runway for a possible transfer to NATO. The transfer to NATO was never realised, however, and the airport continued in civil use, ending up under BAA control in 1966.

During the 1960s, &#x27;70s, and early &#x27;80s, the Fire Service Training School was based on the eastern side of the airfield under the auspices of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, now the Civil Aviation Authority. The school was responsible for the training of all aviation fire crews for British airfields, as well as those of many overseas countries.
=== Under BAA ownership (1966–2013) ===
Beginning in 1966, after Stansted was placed under BAA control, the airport was used by holiday charter operators wishing to escape the higher costs associated with operating from Heathrow and Gatwick.
Stansted had been held in reserve as a third London airport since the 1950s. However, after a public inquiry at Chelmsford in 1966–67, the government set up the Roskill Commission to review the need afresh. The Commission for the Third London Airport (the &quot;Roskill Commission&quot;) of 1968–71 did not include Stansted as one of its four short-listed sites and recommended that Cublington in Buckinghamshire should be developed as London&#x27;s third airport. However, the Conservative government under Ted Heath agreed with a minority recommendation that a site at Foulness in the Thames Estuary, later renamed Maplin, should be developed, but in 1974, the incoming Labour government under Harold Wilson cancelled the Maplin project because of the economic situation.

Stansted was then considered as an option for long-term development in the Advisory Committee on Airports Policy and the Study Group on South East Airports and was selected from a short list of six by the Conservative government in December 1979. The proposal, for a new terminal associated with the existing runway and the safeguarding of land for a second runway, was considered at the Airports Inquiries of 1981–83. The &quot;Inspector&#x27;s Report&quot; was published in 1984 and the decision, announced in a white paper in 1985, was to approve a plan to develop Stansted in two phases, involving both airfield and terminal improvements that would increase the airport&#x27;s capacity to 15 million passengers per year, but to reject the second runway.

==== Redevelopment into London&#x27;s third airport ====
The redevelopment of Stansted into London&#x27;s third airport began with outline planning permission granted in 1985, for a new terminal building to accommodate up to 15 million passengers annually.

Initially, the project was planned in two phases. The first phase was designed to permit an annual capacity of 8 million passengers, while the second phase was intended to expand the terminal&#x27;s capacity to 15 million passengers per annum. It was initially believed that any future development beyond this capacity would require the construction of a second major terminal building.

==== Foster Associates terminal ====
Foster Associates, founded by architect Norman Foster, was commissioned to design the new terminal building, with structural engineering led by Peter Rice at principal engineers Ove Arup &amp; Partners. The plans were approved in 1985, and construction took place between 1988 and 1991 by the John Laing company at a cost of £100 million. The terminal building originally comprised a square structure of 11 bays by 11 bays, and opened to the public in 1991. It received the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture (Mies van der Rohe Award) in 1990. As part of the development, a railway branch was built to the airport for Stansted Airport railway station, built at ground level within the terminal.

The building was recognised as a landmark work of high-tech architecture. Foster + Partners&#x27; design for Stansted Airport is widely regarded as a transformative influence on airport architecture. The building features open canopies that visually connect the landside and airside, and challenged conventional airport layouts by relocating essential services underground, instead creating an open and flexible main concourse that is naturally illuminated. The &quot;floating&quot; roof, supported by a space frame of inverted-pyramid roof trusses, creates the impression of a stylised swan in flight. The base of each truss structure is a &quot;utility pillar&quot;, which provides indirect uplighting illumination and is the location for air-conditioning, water, telecommunications, and electrical outlets. The layout of the airport was originally designed to provide an unobstructed flow for passengers to arrive at the short-stay car park, move through the check-in hall, and go through security and on to the departure gates, all on the same level. These principles influenced the design of future projects around the world.

In 1999, planning permission was granted for Phase 2 of the terminal expansion, which included extending the width to 15 bays, as well as the addition of the third satellite building.

==== Further developments ====
A major expansion programme to the terminal took place between 2007 and 2009, extending the width by 2 bays, with nearly of floorspace, to give space for additional baggage carousels, a new immigration and passport control hall.

In November 2006, Uttlesford District Council rejected a BAA planning application to increase the permitted number of aircraft movements and to remove the limit on passenger numbers. BAA immediately appealed against the decision and a public inquiry opened, lasting from May until October 2007. Planning Inspector Alan Boyland made his recommendations in January 2008. Those recommendations were largely followed by the Secretary of State for Transport (Geoff Hoon) and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Hazel Blears), who jointly allowed the applicant&#x27;s appeal in October 2008. A legal challenge by community campaign group Stop Stansted Expansion was rejected by the High Court in March 2009.

The Competition Commission ruled in March 2009 that BAA should sell Gatwick and Stansted Airports within two years. The ruling was quashed within a year following an appeal, but was subsequently upheld. The Competition Commission reconfirmed its ruling in July 2011 that the airport be sold, and the Court of Appeal turned down an appeal by BAA on 26 July 2012. In light of the result, BAA chose not to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and confirmed on 20 August 2012 that the airport would be sold.

=== Under MAG ownership (2013–) ===
In January 2013 it was announced that MAG (Manchester Airports Group) had agreed to purchase London Stansted Airport for £1.5 billion. The sale was completed on 28 February 2013.

MAG announced on 20 June 2013 as part of a visit to the airport by the Secretary of State for Transport that it would be launching an £80 million terminal redevelopment programme. MAG has invested £40 million and the remainder was invested by other commercial partners. The redevelopment included relocation of the security area, doubling the amount of seating, and improving the information displays. The new Departure Lounge offers a food court, new shops, and an Escape Lounge.

In 2017, Antonov Airlines opened a UK office at Stansted for cargo charter flights, generally of outsize loads.

==== COVID-19 pandemic and recovery ====
The COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on London Stansted Airport, leading to a significant reduction in passenger numbers and operational challenges. In 2020, the airport served just over 7.5 million passengers, a large decline from its pre-pandemic levels of around 28 million annually. At the height of the crisis, Stansted experienced a 95% drop in passenger footfall compared to 2019. Cargo operations, however, saw a 53% increase as the airport adapted to new demands. Airport authorities described the situation as an unprecedented crisis, likening the passenger levels to those seen in the early 1990s.

As travel restrictions began to ease in July 2021, London Stansted Airport experienced widespread disruption as passenger numbers surged during the summer holidays. The airport faced staff shortages and increased COVID-19 documentation requirements, leading to long queues and chaotic scenes, with insufficient personnel available to manage the crowds effectively. The airport showed signs of recovery by late 2022, with passenger levels nearing 97% of pre-pandemic volumes.

In the wake of this recovery, in 2023 Stansted Airport announced a £1.1 billion expansion plan including a £600m extension of the terminal and facilities, to increase its capacity to serve up to 43 million passengers per year. This expansion is expected to add 200 flights per day to the airport&#x27;s schedule and create over 5,000 jobs over the next five years.

==Infrastructure==
===Terminal and satellite buildings===
The terminal is separated into three general areas: Check-in and main concourse along the front, departures towards the southern end, and international arrivals to the northern end of the building. There is a separate baggage reclaim for Domestic arrivals. No gates are in the main terminal building; instead, they are located in three separate oblong satellite buildings, one connected to the main terminal by air bridges, one by the Stansted Airport Transit System people mover, and one by both. Four further bussing gates are accessed from below the main terminal building. The airport has 52 gates with 12 serviceable jetbridges. Long-term plans for Satellite 4, approved in 1999 and revised in 2005, have not been realised, but its site was developed as remote stands in 2018.

As of 2013, Satellite 1 (Gates 1-19) had been redeveloped with the aim to attract more long-haul airlines to Stansted. Furthermore, a dual jetbridge has been added at Stand 13 (Boarding Gate 12), allowing faster boarding and deboarding of wide-body aircraft. An additional building, known as the Advanced Passenger Vehicle (APV), was brought back into use in 2016 for flights departing during the busy 06:00 to 09:00 period. The APV building is linked to the main terminal building by an accessible route and acts as a bus terminal for international flights at remote stands. Prior to the completion of Satellite 3, this terminal (then consisted of gates 90–95) was in regular passenger use.

Domestic arrivals (from the UK) use a separate exit route, located at the opposite end of the Terminal to the International arrivals hall. This exit is connected solely by footbridge from Satellite 2 gates 8188. When a domestic flight arrives at a gate which is not located in Satellite 2, passengers are transported to a gate on Satellite 2 by a courtesy bus service from the aircraft.

Common Travel Area arrivals are coached from stand, and taken to a separate entrance located at the North East of the terminal which leads to the main terminal baggage reclaim belts, bypassing Border Force, but without bypassing Customs.

===Car parks ===
Stansted has a variety of car parking including long-, mid-, and short-stay options along with valet and meet-and-greet parking services. Two drop off areas also are available. The express area is located near the short-stay car park, while a free service is within the mid-stay area. A fee is charged for the express service. Terminal Road North and its free drop-off area directly outside the terminal was closed shortly after MAG took over the airport in 2013.

===Control tower===

Stansted&#x27;s air traffic control tower was completed in 1996 and was the tallest in Britain at the time of its construction. It is located on the southside of the airfield alongside the main terminal building. It replaced the old control tower, which offered poor views of the airfield once the current terminal building was opened in 1991.

===Cargo handling===
There are several cargo buildings and hangars around the airfield. The main cargo centre is located by the control tower and handles most cargo operations, including aircraft such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and the Boeing 747. There are a small number of hangars on the other side of the runway to the rest of the airport. The largest are located at the south east of the airfield, one of which is used by Ryanair.

===Other facilities===
Titan Airways has its head office in the Enterprise House on the airport property. Several airlines at one time had their head offices on the airport property. AirUK (later KLM uk) had its head office in the Stansted House. When Buzz existed, its head office was in the Endeavour House. When AB Airlines existed, its head office was in the Enterprise House. For a period Lloyd International Airways had its head office at the Lloyd House at Stansted. When Go Fly existed its head office was at the Enterprise House.

Since 2004, Stansted also offers a range of hotel accommodation including Holiday Inn Express, Novotel, Premier Inn, and Radisson Blu hotels and the recently opened Hampton by Hilton, the last two of which are both within two minutes of the terminal building via an undercover walkway. Regular bus service handles transfers between the terminal building and Stansted&#x27;s car parks and hotels.

==Proposed developments==
=== Runway ===
==== Plans for a second runway ====
On 11 March 2008, BAA submitted a planning application (titled &quot;G2&quot;) to expand the airport by and for the construction of a second runway and terminal, etc., in line with a recommendation in the 2003 Air Transport White Paper (ATWP). This would have been the subject of a public inquiry, and if approved, would have allowed Stansted to handle more passengers than Heathrow did at the time of the application.

In May 2010, BAA withdrew its plans to build a second runway at Stansted and withdrew the plans to build a new runway at Heathrow.

The ATWP had anticipated that a second runway would be operational by 2011, but this date continued to slip. BAA&#x27;s 2008 planning application envisaged operation commencing in 2015, and in 2009, BAA revised the anticipated opening date to 2017.

Prior to the United Kingdom&#x27;s May 2010 general election, all three major political parties pledged not to approve a second runway. Soon after the election, the new government confirmed this, and BAA withdrew its application for planning permission, having spent nearly £200 million preparing for the public inquiry and buying up properties.

The public inquiry into BAA&#x27;s second runway application had been scheduled to start on 15 April 2009, but the start was delayed by Secretary of State Hazel Blears to allow time for BAA and the government to consider the implications of the March 2009 Competition Commission&#x27;s ruling that BAA must sell Stansted within two years. As 2011 drew to a close, BAA was still appealing against the Competition Commission ruling. On 20 August 2012, after losing a case at the Court of Appeal, BAA agreed to cease challenging the Competition Commission&#x27;s ruling and to sell Stansted.

On 10 February 2010, Secretary of State John Denham, in an open letter, concluded that the inquiry could not reasonably start until after the general election. In addition, he commented that the planning application documents were nearly two years old and would require updating. Eventually, BAA realised the futility of pursuing its G2 application in the context of the new government policy and withdrew it on 24 May 2010.

==== Stop Stansted Expansion ====
The advocacy group Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE) was formed in 2002, as a working group of the North West Essex and East Herts Preservation Association, in response to the Government&#x27;s consultation on expanding UK airports and, particularly, runway expansion plans for Stansted Airport subsequently defined in the Air Transport white paper in December 2003. In September 2012, as a result of pressure from the aviation industry, the government set up the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies, to consider what, if anything, needed to be done to maintain the UK&#x27;s status as a global aviation hub. The commission concluded that an additional runway would be required for South East England and that it should be added to either Heathrow or Gatwick. Following the 2015 election, the commission made a final recommendation to expand Heathrow subject to certain environmental constraints.

=== Terminal ===
==== Ongoing Terminal extension ====

In July 2023, MAG announced a new proposal for a reconfiguration and three-bay extension to the existing terminal building, which will increase its size by a third. This plan aims to create increased passenger amenities, with an expected cost of £600 million. The extension plan will increase the terminal&#x27;s size by 16,500 square metres, and is designed to accommodate an increase in passenger capacity from 35 million to 43 million annual passengers. On 1 November 2023, the government&#x27;s Planning Inspectorate approved the expansion plan. The new terminal design will incorporate a larger departure lounge, an enlarged security hall, and new amenities, including additional shops, bars, and restaurants. The baggage reclaim area will also feature new carousels and increased baggage handling capacity. The redevelopment will include the installation new check-in desks, and next-generation security scanners. Satellite 2 (gates 20-39) is also set to receive an overhaul, with upgraded floor and gate area seating. The existing gate areas will also be reconfigured to model conventional gate-rooms as seen in other airports, with the aim to create more space for passengers when pre-boarding their aircraft 

As part of the redevelopment project, the existing passenger transit system will be decommissioned and replaced with new walkways that will connect the terminal to the satellite buildings. Additionally, the immigration hall will be relocated to a new area downstairs within the terminal. Also included in the programme is the installation of a 14.3-megawatt on-site solar farm.

Construction of the extension is planned to begin in 2025 and is expected to last two to three years.

==== Proposed Satellite 4 ====

Plans for Satellite 4 have never been realised. Located to the northeast of Satellite 3, Satellite 4 was approved for planning permission in 1999 as part of an expansion strategy to increase the airport&#x27;s capacity from 8 to 15 million passengers per annum. A revised scheme in 2005 included a pier link for the proposed satellite, with construction planned for 2013-2015, however plans did not proceed after the sale of BAA to Ferrovial, and construction never commenced. In 2018, the site of Satellite 4 was instead built as remote stands. The current expansion plans for 2024 do not include Satellite 4, and instead focuses on other airfield and terminal improvements.

==== Formerly proposed Arrivals Terminal ====
In December 2016, London Stansted Airport unveiled plans for a new £130 million arrivals terminal aimed to handle increasing passenger numbers and relieve pressure on the existing single-terminal setup, which is the busiest of its kind in the UK.

The new arrivals terminal was to be located adjacent to the existing terminal and Radisson Blu Hotel. It would feature a larger immigration and baggage reclaim area. This new facility would allow the existing terminal to be reconfigured exclusively for departures, expanding space for check-in, security, and the international departures lounge, and would make London Stansted the only airport in the UK with separate arrivals and departures terminals.

Initial construction was due to start in 2018, taking three years to complete. However, the arrivals terminal was put on hold at the end of 2019, due to fluctuating travel demand and economic uncertainties. In 2020, Uttlesford District Council refused planning permission for the expansion plan, but the Planning Inspectorate overturned this decision following a public inquiry in 2021. Despite the approval, further delays and changes to the airport&#x27;s priorities led to the arrivals terminal being deferred.

In 2023, following a review of various proposals for increasing terminal capacity, Stansted Airport decided to cancel the arrivals terminal project, opting instead to focus on expanding the existing 1991 terminal building.

==== Formerly proposed artwork ====
As part of the terminal&#x27;s initial development, in 1988 Norman Foster and British architectural artist Brian Clarke made several proposals for an integral artwork for the terminal building. The principal proposal would have seen the east and west elevations of the terminal clad in two sequences of traditionally mouth-blown, leaded stained glass, along the full length of the building. However, for technical and security reasons, the artwork was not executed. In 1991, the British Airports Authority commissioned a second, smaller stained glass project from Clarke for Stansted Airport in place of the 1988 proposal. The artist designed two stained glass friezes and a high tower of stained glass for a circulation area in the centre of the terminal which, in their composition, echoed elements of Foster&#x27;s structure; by 1994 the tower had been removed to &#x27;allow greater flow of traffic through the space&#x27;, and later the friezes were likewise removed.

==Airlines and destinations==

===Passenger===
The following airlines operate regular scheduled flights to and from Stansted Airport:


;Notes
===Cargo===

=== Route development ===

Long-haul scheduled services commenced in 1987 with a short lived service from the Scottish airline Highland Express to Newark Liberty International Airport via Prestwick Airport. In the early 1990s American Airlines operated a transatlantic service between Stansted and Chicago–O&#x27;Hare, but the route was unprofitable and was withdrawn in 1993. Continental Airlines also operated services in the late 1990s from Newark Liberty International Airport, but this service was stopped shortly after the September 11 attacks in 2001.

Long-haul services to the United States returned in late 2005, when Eos Airlines and MAXjet Airways commenced all-business class services from Stansted to New York–JFK. In 2006, MAXjet expanded their service with flights to Washington–Dulles, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles. American Airlines began daily flights to Stansted in October 2007 from New York–JFK and was originally expected to operate a second daily flight from April 2008. However, because of the jump in fuel price, weakening economic performance, and worsening credit environment at the time, all three services to the United States have since been discontinued following the demise of MAXjet Airways in December 2007 and Eos Airlines in April 2008. Finally, in July 2008, American Airlines withdrew from Stansted, alongside its services to Gatwick, and consolidated all operations at Heathrow.

Long-haul transatlantic operations made a brief return to Stansted in June 2010, when Sun Country Airlines announced a seasonal weekly service from Stansted to Minneapolis/St. Paul. The flights made a refuelling stopover in Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador as the aircraft used for the flight, a Boeing 737-800, would not be able to complete a nonstop westbound flight from Stansted to Minneapolis. The flights operated from 11 June to 15 August 2010. In 2011, Sun Country operated to Gatwick rather than Stansted and then discontinued flights due to the price involved in carrying fuel on long-haul flights. .
Long-haul services to Asia commenced in March 2009 with Malaysian low-cost airline AirAsia X providing direct flights to Kuala Lumpur International Airport; however, on 24 October 2011, this service moved to Gatwick Airport before being later withdrawn completely. Low-cost airline Primera Air launched non-stop flights from Stansted to Boston, Newark, Toronto-Pearson and Washington–Dulles, until the collapse of the airline meant the discontinuation of the routes by 2018, leaving Stansted without transatlantic routes once more. In 2018, Emirates began operating daily flights to its hub at Dubai-International using its Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. The route has since increased to a twice daily service.

The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the aviation industry, with Stansted Airport not being immune from the fallout. Ural Airlines (to Moscow–Domodedovo), Scandinavian Airlines (to Copenhagen), Air India (to Amritsar and Mumbai), Air Senegal (to Dakar–Diass) and El Al (to Tel Aviv), were either scheduled to begin in 2020, or had recently began operation but have since not returned. Additionally, easyJet, one of the largest operators at the airport at the time, announced the closure of their base at Stansted, which had more than two dozen routes and existed for more than a decade, in August 2020.

==Statistics==
===Development===
In 1988, over 1.1 million passengers passed through Stansted, the first time annual passenger numbers had exceeded 1 million at the airport. Consistent year-on-year growth followed, and by 1997, the total had reached over 5 million, rapidly rising to almost 12 million in 2000.

In 2007, passenger numbers peaked at nearly 24 million, but then declined for five years, and in 2012, the total was around 17.5 million. An increase of 2.2% was recorded in 2013 to 17.8 million passengers, then 11.7% in 2014 to 19.9 million, followed by 12.8% in 2015 to 22.5 million, and 8.0% in 2016 to a record total of 24.3 million, making Stansted the fourth-busiest airport in the United Kingdom. Stansted also is a major freight airport, the third-busiest in the UK during 2016, behind London Heathrow and East Midlands Airport, handling in excess of 223,203 tonnes per annum, although freight throughput has declined slightly from its 2005 peak level.

Passenger numbers for the year ending September 2016 increased by 8.4% to over 24 million for the first time since 2007. Passenger numbers for 2023 was 28 million.

===Airside Transit system===
The Stansted Airport Transit System connects the terminal to the satellite buildings via a free automated people mover service, which runs on dual concrete tracks. The system uses a mix of Adtranz C-100 and CX-100 vehicles to carry passengers to departure gates. Unlike the similar Gatwick Airport Shuttle Transit, the Stansted transit is only accessible &quot;airside&quot; (i.e. only after passengers pass through security). As part of the airport expansion plans, it is planned to decommission the Transit System in spring 2026 to make way for an expanded terminal. The transit will be replaced with pedestrian bridges.
===Trains===

Stansted Airport railway station is situated in the terminal building directly below the main concourse.

Services to London are on the Stansted Express train to and from Liverpool Street in Central London. This service operates every 15minutes and the usual journey time is between 45 and 53minutes. Liverpool Street is served by London Underground and the Elizabeth line, offering access throughout London. The Stansted Express also calls at Tottenham Hale, for the Underground&#x27;s Victoria line and connections to various destinations in North London and the West End. Some Stansted Express services also call at Stansted Mountfitchet, Bishop&#x27;s Stortford and/or Harlow Town en route to London Liverpool Street.

CrossCountry operates a two-hourly service from the airport to Birmingham New Street, via Cambridge, Peterborough, , and Leicester. Greater Anglia operates services to Norwich via Cambridge.

===Buses and coaches===
Scheduled express bus or coach services which run to and from London are provided by National Express and Airport Bus Express. The bus station is next to the terminal building.

Airport Bus Express operates service A21 to and from Liverpool Street Station via Stratford. National Express operates nearly 200 round trips a day and runs services A6 to Paddington Station typically every 30minutes and taking 100minutes (via Golders Green, Finchley Road, St. John&#x27;s Wood, Baker Street and Marble Arch), A7 to Victoria Coach Station typically every 30minutes and taking 115minutes (via Bow, Mile End, Whitechapel, Southwark, and Waterloo), A8 to King&#x27;s Cross Station typically every 30minutes and taking 115minutes (via Tottenham Hale, Shoreditch and Liverpool Street) and A9 non-stop to Stratford typically up to three times an hour and taking 50minutes.

National Express also runs direct coach services to the airport from Luton Airport and Heathrow, and additionally from Birmingham (11 per day), Oxford (eight per day), Norwich (ten per day), and Cambridge (11 per day).

Stansted is also the start of the Essex Airlink X30 coach service to Southend-on-Sea via Chelmsford and London Southend Airport, the X20 coach service to Colchester via Braintree and the X10 coach service to Basildon via Chelmsford, all operated hourly by First Essex.

Local bus services operate to nearby communities, including the 510/509/508 (Harlow to Stansted via Stansted Mountfitchet, Parsonage Lane and Takeley, respectively), 7/7a (Bishops Stortford to Stansted), 133 (Braintree), and 6 (Saffron Walden), operated by Arriva.

===Roads===
Stansted is connected to northeast London and Cambridge by the M11 motorway and to Braintree, Colchester, and Harwich by the A120, which is dual-carriageway until Braintree. The road distance to London is .

As of October 1996, the airport has 2,500 short-stay parking spaces within walking distance to the terminal. In addition, as of the same month, the airport has over 8,000 long-stay spaces located near the M11 motorway and A120 junction. A courtesy bus service links the long-stay spaces to the terminal. The airport also offers mid-stay parking, closer to the terminal than its long-stay spaces. Stansted Airport also offers valet parking and a meet-and-greet service, which is similar to valet, but marketed more at the leisure-traveller market; both are run from the short-stay car park.

==Incidents and accidents==
Stansted has been designated by the UK government as its preferred airport for any hijacked planes requesting to land in the UK. This is because its design allows a hijacked airliner to be isolated well away from any terminal buildings or runways, allowing the airport to continue to operate while negotiations are carried out, or even while an assault or rescue mission is undertaken. For this reason, Stansted has been involved in more hijack incidents than might be expected for an airport of its size.
* On 30 April 1956, a Scottish Airlines Avro 685 York C.1 suffered a runway excursion during a rejected takeoff, winding up in a drain on the side of the runway, collapsing the undercarriage. Two passengers died out of 54 on board.
* On 23 December 1957, a Scottish Airlines Avro 685 York C.1, a cargo flight, crashed on its third approach to Stansted striking a tree 3/4 of a mile short of the runway, crashing in flames. All four occupants died.
* On 27 February 1982, an Air Tanzania Boeing 737-2R8C landed at the airport after having been hijacked on an internal flight from Mwanza to Dar es Salaam and flown to the UK via Nairobi, Jeddah, and Athens, where two passengers had been released. The hijackers demanded to speak to exiled Tanzanian opposition politician Oscar Kambona. This request was granted, and after 26 hours on the ground, the hijackers surrendered and the passengers were released.
*On 30 March 1998, an Emerald Airways Hawker Siddeley HS 748 carrying the Leeds United F.C. was brought down immediately after takeoff when its starboard engine exploded. 40 passengers were onboard (18 from the Leeds team). Only two passengers were injured.
* On 22 December 1999, Korean Air Cargo Flight 8509, a Boeing 747-200F, crashed shortly after take-off from the airfield due to pilot error. The only people on board at the time were the aircrew, and all four were killed. The aircraft crashed in Hatfield Forest near the village of Great Hallingbury.
* On 6 February 2000, an Ariana Afghan Airlines Boeing 727 with 156 people on board was hijacked and flown – stopping at Tashkent, Kazakhstan, and Moscow – to Stansted Airport. After a four-day stand-off, the hostages on board were safely freed and the incident ended peacefully. The motive behind the hijack was to gain asylum in the UK, sparking another debate about immigration into the country. A large number of passengers on board the plane also applied for asylum. The remainder returned to Afghanistan. Nine hijackers were jailed, but their convictions for hijacking were quashed for misdirection of the jury in 2003, and in July 2004, a court ruled that they could not be deported from the UK.
* On 24 May 2013, Pakistan International Airlines Flight 709 from Lahore, Pakistan, was escorted by RAF Typhoons after being diverted from Manchester Airport due to an onboard threat. Two men were charged with endangering an aircraft.
* On 21 September 2013, SriLankan Airlines Flight UL503 inbound to Heathrow was escorted by RAF Typhoons to Stansted Airport after being diverted. Two men were detained for endangering an aircraft, and one was formally arrested.

=== Protest incidents ===

* In 2008, 57 people were arrested after Plane Stupid, an environmental activist group, broke through the barriers and created a &quot;stockade&quot; on a taxiway, which resulted in 52 flights being cancelled.
* In March 2018, a group of activists delayed a deportation flight to Nigeria. Fifteen of the protestors were found guilty of &quot;intentional disruption of services at an aerodrome&quot;, under the &quot;Aviation and Maritime Security Act 1990&quot;. This verdict on the &quot;Stansted 15&quot; was described in &quot;New Statesman&quot; as having a chilling effect on public dissent.

<doc id="65458" wikidata="Q3271288" url="?curid=65458" title="Ripping Yarns">
<text>Ripping Yarns is a British television adventure comedy anthology series. It was written by Michael Palin and Terry Jones of Monty Python fame and transmitted on BBC 2. Following an initial pilot episode in January 1976, it ran for two series — five episodes in September and October 1977 and three episodes in October 1979. Each episode had a different setting and characters, looking at a different aspect of British culture and parodying pre-World War II literature aimed at schoolboys. In the title, &quot;ripping&quot; is a chiefly British slang colloquialism for &quot;exciting&quot; or &quot;thrilling&quot;, with &quot;yarn&quot; used in the sense of a story.

==Pilot episode==
In 1975, the BBC commissioned a pilot episode from Palin and Jones, which was envisaged to be a light entertainment comedy piece. The result was &quot;Tomkinson&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; (a title loosely inspired by &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; and suggested by BBC director Terry Hughes). Palin and Jones both wrote and starred in multiple roles. Once the series was picked up, Jones did not appear in any further episodes, following a decision by Jimmy Gilbert that it should be a “Michael Palin series”.

==Episodes==

The nine episodes and their original airdates are:

===First series===
#&quot;Tomkinson&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; – pilot – 7 January 1976
#&quot;The Testing of Eric Olthwaite&quot; – 27 September 1977
#&quot;Escape from Stalag Luft 112B&quot; – 4 October 1977
#&quot;Murder at Moorstones Manor&quot; – 11 October 1977
#&quot;Across the Andes by Frog&quot; – 18 October 1977
#&quot;The Curse of the Claw&quot; – 25 October 1977

===Second series===
#&quot;Whinfrey&#x27;s Last Case&quot; – 10 October 1979
#&quot;Golden Gordon&quot; – 17 October 1979
#&quot;Roger of the Raj&quot; – 24 October 1979

==Production details==
&quot;Tomkinson&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; was shot on videotape in front of a studio audience, with filmed exterior scenes. The remaining episodes were all shot on film, and were originally shown with laugh tracks (recorded by showing each completed film to an audience), but with a couple of exceptions these have been omitted from reruns.

In 2014, the series was repeated on BBC4, commencing with &quot;Tomkinson&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; on 3 April. This broadcast included a laugh track. The first episode was preceded by a documentary, &quot;Alexander Armstrong&#x27;s Real Ripping Yarns&quot;, which examined the assumptions and outlook of the original boys&#x27; magazines of which &quot;Ripping Yarns&quot; were a parody. Both Palin and Jones contributed to the programme.

The theme tune for the series was &quot;Fanfare&quot; from the ‘Facade Suite No. 2&#x27;, by Sir William Walton, played by the City of Birmingham Orchestra, conducted by Louis Frémaux.

===Directors===
Terry Hughes, who had directed &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; and would later direct &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; and &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot;, directed early episodes of &quot;Ripping Yarns&quot;. Jim Franklin, known for &quot;The Goodies&quot;, directed other episodes and two episodes in the second series were directed by Alan J. W. Bell, known for &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; and &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;. Bell used Michael Radford, who later became noted for the films &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, &quot;White Mischief&quot; and &quot;Il Postino&quot;, as cinematographer.

===Cast===
Each episode featured several guest character actors including Ian Ogilvy, Kenneth Colley, Isabel Dean, Liz Smith, Roy Kinnear, Frank Middlemass, Iain Cuthbertson, John Le Mesurier, Jan Francis, Denholm Elliott, Gwen Taylor, Harold Innocent, Richard Vernon, Gwen Watford, Barbara New, Gerald Sim, Gilly Flower, Joan Sanderson, Roger Sloman and David Griffin. John Cleese makes a cameo appearance in the episode &quot;Golden Gordon&quot;.

==Reception==
The series was nominated for a BAFTA award in 1978 for &#x27;Best Film Cameraman&#x27; (Peter Hall) and won in 1980 for &#x27;Best Light Entertainment Programme/Series&#x27;.

==Books==

The scripts were published in book form, with sepia-tinted stills, as &quot;Ripping Yarns&quot; (1978; ) and &quot;More Ripping Yarns&quot; (1980; ) and later collected in an omnibus volume, &quot;The Complete Ripping Yarns&quot; (1999; ).

&quot;Across the Andes by Frog&quot; originally appeared in &quot;Bert Fegg&#x27;s Nasty Book for Boys and Girls&quot;, co-authored by Palin and Jones.

==Home media==
The series was released on three VHS tapes in the UK in the 1990s. Two of these compilations were reissued by Revelation Films on Region 0 (worldwide) DVD in 2000, though the six episodes included were not remastered.

The fully restored series was released in October 2004 as &quot;The Complete Ripping Yarns&quot;. This two-disc Region 2 DVD set included commentaries on all nine episodes by Palin and Jones and a deleted scene (without soundtrack) from &quot;Murder at Moorstones Manor&quot;. All of the episodes, except &quot;Tomkinson&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; and &quot;Murder at Moorstones Manor&quot;, have optional laugh-free soundtracks.

The DVD set also includes the only surviving (and rather poor quality) recording of Palin and Jones&#x27;s comic BBC play &quot;Secrets&quot; from 1973, as well as a documentary by Michael Palin entitled &quot;Comic Roots&quot; in which he goes back to visit his home town. Not linked in the menu are scans of the first drafts of the scripts for six episodes (&quot;Tomkinson&#x27;s Schooldays&quot;, &quot;The Testing of Eric Olthwaite&quot;, &quot;Murder at Moorstone Manor&quot;, &quot;Across the Andes by Frog&quot;, &quot;The Curse of the Claw&quot; and &quot;Whinfrey&#x27;s Last Case&quot;), type-written with Palin&#x27;s handwritten comments and changes in the margin. There is an informative booklet enclosed. This set was also released in Region 1 with all of the above included, apart from &quot;Secrets&quot;. A further box set, fully remastered, including the directors commentary, was released in 2004.

The DVD was re-released in March 2012. To publicise the event, Network hosted a &quot;Hopathon&quot; to recreate the &quot;Tomkinson&#x27;s School Days&quot; episode. The intention was to break a Guinness World Record, but not enough people took part.

<text>Lynn Nolan Ryan Jr. (born January 31, 1947), nicknamed &quot;the Ryan Express&quot;, is an American former professional baseball pitcher and sports executive. Over a record 27-year playing career in Major League Baseball (MLB), Ryan pitched for the New York Mets, California Angels, Houston Astros, and Texas Rangers. After his retirement in 1993, Ryan served as chief executive officer (CEO) of the Texas Rangers and an executive advisor to the Houston Astros. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999 in his first year of eligibility, and is widely considered to be one of the greatest pitchers of all time.

Ryan was a right-handed power pitcher who consistently threw pitches that were clocked above 100 miles per hour (161 km/h). He maintained this velocity throughout his pitching career, being known as one of the top pitchers in Major League Baseball into his mid-40s. Ryan was also known to throw a devastating 12–6 curveball at exceptional velocity for a breaking ball.

Ryan had a lifetime win–loss record of 324–292 (.526) and was an eight-time All-Star. He has 5,714 career strikeouts, an MLB record that is 839 more than runner-up Randy Johnson. Similarly, Ryan&#x27;s 2,795 bases on balls lead second-place Steve Carlton by 962 – walking over 50% more hitters than any other pitcher in MLB history. Ryan&#x27;s lifetime batting average against of .204 is also a major league record. He recorded 300 strikeouts in a season six different times, a Major League record. Ryan, Pedro Martínez, Randy Johnson, Trevor Hoffman, and Sandy Koufax are the only five pitchers inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame who had more strikeouts than innings pitched. Ryan is one of three players in history to have his number retired by at least three teams, along with Jackie Robinson (whose number was retired by Major League Baseball) and Frank Robinson.

Ryan is the all-time leader in no-hitters with seven, three more than any other pitcher. He is tied with Bob Feller for the most one-hitters, with 12. Ryan also pitched 18 two-hitters. Despite this, he never pitched a perfect game, nor did he ever win a Cy Young Award; both were largely attributed to his high walk rate. Ryan is one of only 31 players in baseball history to have appeared in MLB games in four different decades.

==Early life==

Lynn Nolan Ryan Jr. was born on January 31, 1947, in Refugio, Texas, a small town located just south of Victoria in the southern part of the state. Ryan was the youngest of six children born to Martha Lee (&quot;née&quot; Hancock; 1913–1990) and Lynn Nolan Ryan Sr. (1907–1970). The senior Ryan operated a newspaper delivery service for the &quot;Houston Post&quot; that required him to rise in the early morning hours to prepare 1,500 newspapers for delivery over a 55-mile route. The children were expected to help with the daily tasks. Ryan&#x27;s family lived in nearby Woodsboro, Texas, in Refugio County, until they moved to Alvin, Texas, in Brazoria County, when Nolan was six weeks old. As a young boy, Nolan enjoyed throwing objects at any target. His father thought baseball a better usage for his arm; therefore, he encouraged Nolan to play the game.

Ryan joined Alvin Little League Baseball when he was nine, made the all-star team when he was 11 and 12, and pitched the first no-hitter of his life a few years later. Ryan also played various positions besides pitcher. In junior high school, Ryan could throw a softball over 100 yards. After ninth grade, Ryan quit playing football after a tackle and fumble caused by future NFL running back Norm Bulaich made him decide to focus on baseball.

Ryan played baseball for Coach Jim Watson at Alvin High School for all of his high school career. Ryan held the school&#x27;s single game strikeout record for 44 years, striking out 21 hitters in a seven-inning game. The record was tied by Alvin High School pitchers Aaron Stewart and Josh Land in the same week in 2009. In 1963, at an Alvin High School game at Clear Creek High School in League City, Texas, Red Murff, a scout for the New York Mets, first noticed sophomore pitcher Ryan. Coach Watson recounted to Murff that some opponents refused to bat against Ryan and how his hard pitches would sometimes break bones in his catchers&#x27; hands. In his subsequent report to the Mets, Murff stated that Ryan had &quot;the best arm I&#x27;ve seen in my life.&quot; As a senior in 1965, Ryan had a 19–3 record and led the Alvin Yellow Jackets to the Texas high school state finals. Ryan pitched in 27 games, with 20 starts. He had 12 complete games, with 211 strikeouts and 61 walks.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
After graduating from Alvin, the New York Mets selected Ryan in the 12th round, with the 295th overall pick, of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft. Ryan signed with the Mets and immediately pitched for the Marion Mets in the Appalachian League and for the Mets team in the Florida Instructional League. Overall, he was 6–9 in 1965 with a 4.33 ERA and 150 strikeouts in 120 innings. In 1966, Ryan pitched for the Class A Greenville Mets of the Western Carolinas League, where he went 17–2 with a 2.51 ERA and 272 strikeouts in 183 innings. He was then promoted to the Class AA Williamsport Mets of the Eastern League, where he was 0–2 with a 0.95 ERA, striking out 35 batters in 19 innings. Overall, Ryan had 307 strikeouts in 202 minor league innings in 1966, earning a late-season call-up to the New York Mets. In 1967, Ryan pitched three games in relief for the Class AAA Jacksonville Suns, started one game for the Class A Winter Haven Mets and pitched eight games for the Mets team in the Florida Instructional League. In 34 total innings, Ryan had 54 strikeouts in 1967.

===New York Mets (1966, 1968–1971)===
When Ryan was called up by the New York Mets in 1966, he was the second-youngest player in the league. Playing in only two games, his first strikeout was Pat Jarvis, and he gave up his first major league home run to Joe Torre.

Ryan missed much of the 1967 season due to illness, an arm injury, and service with the Army Reserve; he pitched only seven innings for the Mets&#x27; minor league affiliate in Jacksonville. In the 1968 season, Ryan returned to the major leagues, where he stayed until his retirement in 1993. Ryan was unable to crack into the Mets&#x27; pitching rotation, led by Tom Seaver and Jerry Koosman. Ryan was used as a reliever and spot starter by the 1969 Mets. Ryan had frequent blisters on his throwing hand and tried several remedies including dipping his fingers in pickle brine.

Ryan pitched well for the Mets in the 1969 postseason. Against the Atlanta Braves in the NLCS, Ryan completed a Mets sweep by throwing seven innings of relief in Game 3, getting his first playoff win (it took him 12 years to get another). Then in the 1969 World Series, Ryan saved Game 3, pitching shutout innings against the Baltimore Orioles. The Game 3 victory gave the Mets a 2–1 lead in the Series, which they went on to win in five games. It was Ryan&#x27;s only World Series appearance in his career.

On April 18, 1970, Ryan tied a Mets record by striking out 15 batters in one game. Four days later, Ryan&#x27;s teammate Seaver topped it with a then-MLB record 19 against the San Diego Padres (Ryan tied this record four years later). Ryan has credited his time with Seaver and the Mets with turning him from just a flamethrower into a pitcher.

Ryan&#x27;s performance declined sharply in the second half of his final season with the Mets. His earned run average for the first half of the 1971 season was 2.24; in the second half, it was 7.74. , this was the steepest second half increase in ERA for a starting pitcher in MLB history.

In five seasons with the Mets, 105 games and 74 starts, Ryan had a 29–38 record, with a 3.58 ERA, 1.39 WHIP, with 344 walks and 493 strikeouts in 511 innings.

===California Angels (1972–1979)===
On December 10, 1971, the 24-year-old Ryan was traded to the California Angels along with pitcher Don Rose, catcher Francisco Estrada, and outfielder Leroy Stanton for shortstop Jim Fregosi (who later managed Ryan in Anaheim). The deal has been cited as one of the worst in Mets history, but was not viewed as unreasonable at the time given Ryan&#x27;s relatively unremarkable numbers as a Met and Fregosi&#x27;s good career to that point.

In his first season with the Angels, Ryan was given a chance to pitch regularly as a starter for the first time in his career, mainly because by then he had fulfilled his military obligation and no longer had to commute to Houston every other week. He had a league-leading 329 strikeouts—nearly a third more than the AL runner-up, and the fourth-highest total of the 20th century to that point. Within five seasons, the season was only Ryan&#x27;s fourth-highest strikeout total. He also set a still-standing Major League record by allowing only 5.26 hits per nine innings, breaking Luis Tiant&#x27;s 5.30 in 1968, as well as posting a 2.28 earned run average that year, to date the second-lowest in franchise history, trailing only Dean Chance&#x27;s 1.65 in 1964. Though Ryan&#x27;s actual winning percentage hovered only slightly over .500, his strikeouts and no-hitters brought him media attention. Meanwhile, Fregosi failed to produce as a Met, making no significant contribution to the Mets&#x27; 1973 pennant-winning campaign; he was sold to the Texas Rangers mid-season.

Although the Angels were a sub-.500 team and remained one for much of Ryan&#x27;s time with them, he managed to post some winning records, notably 19–16 in 1972, 21–16 in 1973, and 22–16 in 1974 (the 22 wins tied what remains the Angels franchise record, set by Clyde Wright in 1970). He finished second in the Cy Young Award balloting (losing to Jim Palmer 88–62) in 1973. It was the closest he ever came to winning the award. Ryan also led the league in losses in 1976 with a 17–18 record (one short of the franchise record for losses). In the early 1970s, many teams used a four-man rotation and expected the starter to complete the game; thus most of the games Ryan started ended in a decision.

On July 9, 1972, Ryan struck out three batters on nine pitches in the second inning of a 3–0 win over the Boston Red Sox; he became the seventh American League pitcher to accomplish the immaculate inning, and the first pitcher in Major League history to accomplish the feat in both leagues (on April 19, 1968, he had struck out three batters on nine pitches in the second inning of a 2–1 win over the St. Louis Cardinals, becoming the eighth National League pitcher and the 14th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish the feat).

Ryan threw a no-hitter against the Kansas City Royals on May 15, 1973. He threw a second no-hitter on July 15 against the Detroit Tigers, he struck out 17 batters – the most in a recorded no-hitter. (This record was later tied by Max Scherzer on October 3, 2015.) Ryan was so dominant in this game, it led to one of baseball&#x27;s best-remembered pranks. Tigers first baseman and cleanup hitter Norm Cash came to the plate with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, having already struck out twice, and was carrying a clubhouse table leg instead of a bat. Plate umpire Ron Luciano ordered Cash to go back and get a regulation bat, to which Cash replied, &quot;Why? I won&#x27;t hit him anyway!&quot; With a regulation bat in hand, Cash did finally make contact, but popped out to end the game. Cash&#x27;s teammate Mickey Stanley commented on facing Ryan that day by saying, &quot;Those were the best pitches I ever heard.&quot;

In 1973, Ryan set his first major record when he struck out 383 batters in one season, beating Sandy Koufax&#x27;s old mark by one. Remarking on this feat, Koufax joked, &quot;Yeah, and he also surpassed my total for bases on balls in a single season by 91. I suspect half of those guys he struck out swung rather than get hit.&quot; Ryan finished second in balloting for the Cy Young Award, behind Jim Palmer.

Pitching 13 innings against the Boston Red Sox on June 14, 1974, Ryan threw 235 pitches, striking out 19, walking 10 and getting a no-decision.

During a September 7, 1974 game against the Chicago White Sox at Anaheim Stadium, Ryan became the first Major League pitcher to have his pitch speed measured during a game. A primitive radar gun clocked a ninth-inning fastball at when it was in front of home plate. This exceeded an earlier pitch by Bob Feller which was measured at at home plate and previously thought to be the fastest pitch ever recorded.

Ryan added a third no-hitter in 1974 and a fourth in 1975, tying another of Koufax&#x27;s records. In 1974 he twice struck out 19 batters, tying Tom Seaver and Steve Carlton for the single-game record for a nine-inning game. Roger Clemens became the first pitcher with a 20-strikeout game in 1986.

The Angels finally made the playoffs in Ryan&#x27;s eighth and final year there in 1979. He started Game 1 of the ALCS against the Baltimore Orioles and threw seven innings against the Orioles&#x27; Jim Palmer, but neither man was involved in the decision as Baltimore won in the 10th inning. Ryan was scheduled to pitch Game 5, but the Angels were eliminated in four. The season complete, Ryan became a free agent.

Ryan led the American League in strikeouts seven times during his eight seasons with the Angels, but he also led the league in walks in six of those years, and finished second the other two seasons: 1975 and 1979. Aside from Bob Feller in 1938, Ryan is the only man since 1900 to walk 200 batters in a season, which he did twice: in 1974 and 1977. Emblematic of this, his 1974 no-hitter against the Minnesota Twins included eight walks.

Though Ryan&#x27;s strikeouts and no-hitters got him considerable media attention, he did not persuade Angels general manager Buzzie Bavasi, who dismissed him as a flashy .500 pitcher (Ryan was 26–27 in the last two years he was with the Angels).

In his eight seasons with the Angels, Ryan was 138–121, a 3.07 ERA, 1.29 WHIP, with 1,302 walks and 2,416 strikeouts in 2181 innings over 288 starts and 156 complete games.

===Houston Astros (1980–1988)===

On November 19, 1979, Ryan signed a four-year contract worth $4.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) with the Houston Astros, becoming MLB&#x27;s first million-dollar player. The salary quadrupled what he had been making with the California Angels. In a nationally televised game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 12, 1980, Ryan hit a three-run home run off Don Sutton. It was the first of two homers in Ryan&#x27;s career and produced half of the six RBIs he got that year. On July 4 at Riverfront Stadium, Ryan recorded his 3,000th career strikeout, the victim being César Gerónimo of the Cincinnati Reds. The Astros made the 1980 MLB postseason. In the 1980 NLCS versus the Philadelphia Phillies, Ryan pitched well in Game 2, leaving the game tied 2–2 in the seventh (having contributed to both Astros runs with a run scored following a walk, and a sacrifice bunt leading to a run) but again got a no-decision in a game that went extra innings. In the fifth and final game of the series, Ryan and the Astros held a 5–2 lead entering the 8th inning. But Ryan allowed three consecutive singles before walking in the third run. The Houston bullpen allowed the Phillies to take a 7–5 lead, and only a game-tying Astro rally permitted Ryan to escape the loss.

On September 26, 1981, Ryan threw his fifth no-hitter, breaking Koufax&#x27;s mark while becoming the third pitcher to throw a no-hitter in each league. That season, his 1.69 ERA was the best in the National League.

Facing the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1981 NLDS, Ryan threw a complete game two-hitter in the opener, outlasting the Dodgers&#x27; rookie sensation Fernando Valenzuela. It was Ryan&#x27;s second and last career postseason win. In the fifth and final game of the series, Ryan left trailing 3–0 and took the loss.
By the end of the 1982 season, both Ryan and Steve Carlton were approaching Walter Johnson&#x27;s all-time strikeout record, sometimes passing one another&#x27;s career totals in successive starts. On April 27, 1983, Ryan won the race with his 3,509th whiff, against Brad Mills of the Montreal Expos. (Carlton reached the same mark two weeks after Ryan, and Gaylord Perry did so later that season.) On July 11, 1985, Ryan struck out Danny Heep for his 4,000th career strikeout.

In 1986, Ryan&#x27;s Astros faced the New York Mets in the National League Championship Series. Ryan had a shaky start in Game 2, taking the loss. He returned in Game 5, throwing 9 innings of 2-hit, 1-run, 12-strikeout ball, but one of those hits was a Darryl Strawberry home run that tied the game at 1, as Dwight Gooden matched Ryan pitch for pitch. Ryan got a no-decision as his Astros lost in 12 innings.

In 1987, Ryan led the major leagues in both ERA (2.76) and strikeouts (270) at the age of 40, but finished 8–16 as the result of extremely poor run support; the Astros scored a total of 27 runs in his 16 losses–an average of 1.69 runs per game. Despite his .333 winning percentage, Ryan tied for 5th place in the 1987 Cy Young voting. Ryan hit his second and final career home run in a 12–3 win on May 1, 1987, against the Atlanta Braves.

In nine seasons as a pitcher with the Astros (his longest tenure with any team), Ryan compiled a 106–94 record in 282 starts, a 3.13 ERA, 1.20 WHIP, with 796 walks and 1,866 strikeouts in 1,854 innings.

===Texas Rangers (1989–1993)===

Ryan left Houston after a contract dispute following the 1988 season and signed with the Texas Rangers at age 42. He became the first player to play for all four MLB original expansion teams: the Mets, Angels, Houston Colt .45s/ Astros and Washington Senators/Texas Rangers. (Ryan was joined in this category by Darren Oliver, who made his major league debut as Ryan&#x27;s teammate in September 1993. Oliver&#x27;s father Bob had also been a teammate of Ryan&#x27;s, with the Angels from 1972 to 1974.) In 1989, he went 16–10 and led the league with 301 strikeouts. Against the Oakland Athletics on August 22, Ryan struck out Rickey Henderson, becoming the only pitcher to record 5,000 career strikeouts. Following the game, Henderson was quoted as saying, &quot;If he ain&#x27;t struck you out, then you ain&#x27;t nobody.&quot; His 4,999th and 5,001st strikeouts were against the same man, Athletics catcher Ron Hassey. Two years later, at 44, Ryan finished fifth in the league in ERA (2.91) and third in strikeouts (203).

In 1990, Ryan threw his sixth no-hitter on June 11 against the Athletics, and earned his 300th win on July 31 against the Milwaukee Brewers. On May 1, 1991, at age 44, Ryan extended his record by throwing the seventh no-hitter of his career, striking out Roberto Alomar of the Toronto Blue Jays for the final out. On August 6, 1992, Ryan had the only ejection of his career after engaging in a shouting match with Oakland Athletics outfielder Willie Wilson with two outs in the eighth inning.

Before the 1993 season began, Ryan announced that he would retire as a player at the end of that season. On August 4, Ryan hit Robin Ventura of the Chicago White Sox with a pitch, and Ventura charged the mound in order to fight Ryan, who was 20 years his senior. Ryan secured the 26-year-old Ventura in a headlock with his left arm, while pummeling Ventura&#x27;s head with his right fist six times before catcher Iván Rodríguez was able to pull Ventura away from Ryan. Ryan stated afterwards that it was the same maneuver he used on steers he had to brand on his Texas ranch. Videos of the incident were played that evening throughout the country. While Ventura was ejected, Ryan–who had barely moved from his spot on the mound in the fracas–was allowed to remain in the game. White Sox manager Gene Lamont vehemently argued this, leading to his own ejection. Ryan pitched a hitless game the rest of the way. He had been determined to be more aggressive after coming out on the wrong side of an altercation with Dave Winfield in 1980.

Ryan tore a ligament in his pitching arm in Seattle on September 22, 1993. The injury ended his career two starts earlier than planned, at age 46. Ryan briefly attempted to pitch past the injury, and he threw one additional pitch after tearing his ligament. Ryan&#x27;s last start was his career-worst; he allowed a single, four walks, and a grand slam in the top of the first without recording an out. It was his record-setting 10th grand slam given up of his career. (Ryan left trailing 5–0, and the fourth walk was completed by a reliever after Ryan&#x27;s injury, but credited to Ryan.) Greg Myers of the California Angels was the last strikeout victim of Nolan Ryan&#x27;s career, on September 17, 1993.

Ryan finished his career having played in the major leagues a record of 27 seasons. He was the final active player from the 1960s to retire from Major League Baseball, outlasting Carlton Fisk (the final active position player) by three months.

In five seasons with the Rangers, Ryan had a 51–39 record, a 3.43 ERA, 1.12 WHIP, with 353 walks and 939 strikeouts in 840 innings over 129 starts.

===Career statistics===

===Seven no-hitters===
Ryan threw a record seven no-hitters during his major league career, three more than any other pitcher. The no-hitters spanned three decades of pitching. In those seven games, Ryan accumulated a total of 94 strikeouts and 26 walks; a ratio of 3.6 strikeouts per walk (his career K:BB was 2.0). Ryan struck out 17 in his no-hitter on July 15, 1973, versus Detroit and walked eight in his subsequent no-hitter against Minnesota, both respective highs for his no-hitters.

==Later activity==
Nolan Ryan&#x27;s post-retirement business interests include being the principal owner of Ryan Sanders Sports and Entertainment, which is the ownership group for the Round Rock Express, the Triple-A Affiliate of the Texas Rangers.
Ryan threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 3 of the 2005 World Series between the Astros and the White Sox, the first World Series game played in Texas. That game went 14 innings, equaling the longest in innings in World Series history (at 5 hours and 41 minutes, it was the longest in time). ESPN suggested the Astros might have needed to pull the 58-year-old Ryan out of retirement if the game had gone much longer.

Ryan has co-written six books: autobiographies &quot;Miracle Man&quot; (with Jerry Jenkins, 1992), &quot;Throwing Heat&quot; (with Harvey Frommer, 1988) and &quot;The Road to Cooperstown&quot; (with Mickey Herskowitz and T.R. Sullivan, 1999); &quot;Kings of the Hill&quot; (with Mickey Herskowitz, 1992), about contemporary pitchers; and instructional books &quot;Pitching and Hitting&quot; (with Joe Torre and Joel Cohen, 1977), and &quot;Nolan Ryan&#x27;s Pitcher&#x27;s Bible&quot; (with Tom House, 1991).

In addition to his baseball activities, Ryan was majority owner and chairman of Express Bank of Alvin but sold his interest in 2005. He also owned a restaurant in Three Rivers, Texas. He served on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission from 1995 to 2001. He appeared as a TV spokesman for Advil for several years. He also has appeared in various television commercials shown in the Texas market.

After retiring from baseball, Ryan teamed up with the federal government to promote physical fitness. His likeness was used in the &quot;Nolan Ryan Fitness Guide&quot;, published by The President&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports in 1994. Ryan suffered a heart attack on April 25, 2000, and had to receive a double coronary bypass.

===Texas Rangers president and CEO (2008–2013)===

In February 2008, the Rangers hired Ryan as team president. After the 2009 season, Ryan and Chuck Greenberg submitted a bid to purchase the Rangers from owner Tom Hicks. At midnight on August 5, 2010, the Ryan/Greenberg group, Rangers Baseball Express, was announced the winners of the final auction to purchase the Rangers, after final approval from Major League Baseball. The final cash bid to purchase the franchise was $385 million. The opposing high bidder was Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. Greenberg became managing general partner and CEO, while Ryan remained as team president.

Greenberg left the group in March 2011, reportedly due to a philosophical clash with Ryan. Ryan was immediately named as CEO while keeping the title of president. Although Texas oil magnates Ray Davis and Bob Simpson served as co-chairmen and held larger stakes, Ryan became the undisputed head of the franchise, with Davis and Simpson serving mostly as senior consultants.

Ryan was named the Dallas–Fort Worth&#x27;s 2012 CEO of the Year by Southern Methodist University&#x27;s Cox School of Business.

During the baseball owners&#x27; meetings in Scottsdale, Arizona, on March 1, 2013, the Rangers announced that general manager Jon Daniels would add president of baseball operations to his title. Rick George was promoted to president of business operations. Ryan&#x27;s title was changed simply to CEO, but he remained operating head of the franchise; both Daniels and George reported to him. On October 17, 2013, Ryan announced that he was stepping down as Rangers CEO effective October 31, 2013.

===Houston Astros special assistant (2014–2019)===
On February 11, 2014, Ryan accepted a position as an executive adviser for the Houston Astros under owner Jim Crane. Ryan&#x27;s son, Reid Ryan, was hired the previous year as president of business operations for the Astros. The Astros won the 2017 World Series and won the 2019 American League pennant. Reid Ryan was demoted by the Astros after the 2019 World Series, and shortly thereafter Nolan Ryan sent a text message to a reporter indicating that he would not return to the Astros front office for the 2020 season.

==Legacy==
Ryan played in more seasons (27) than any other player since 1900 in major league history. (For all-time he is tied with Cap Anson for #1). Ryan ranks first for all-time in strikeouts (5,714), fewest hits allowed per nine innings (6.56), and no-hitters (7). He is also fifth in innings pitched (5,386), second in games started (773), seventh in shutouts (61), is tied for 14th in wins (324), and is third in losses (292).

Opposing hitters hit only .204 against Ryan during his career, although they had a .309 on-base percentage against him. He also limited hitters to a .298 slugging percentage. Ryan had 15 or more strikeouts in a game 26 times, second only to Randy Johnson, who had 28. Ryan&#x27;s lengthy career spanned generations as he struck out seven pairs of fathers and sons (for example, Bobby Bonds and Barry Bonds), another major league record. Ryan also played during the administrations of seven U.S. Presidents—Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton—equaling a 20th-century record that had been set by Jim Kaat.

Ryan also ranks high on the list for four &quot;negative&quot; records; he ranks first all-time in walks allowed (2,795), first in wild pitches (277), third in losses (292 – most in the post-1920 live-ball era), and ninth in batters hit (158). Ryan was the first pitcher in MLB history to give up ten grand slam home runs, including one to Dann Howitt, the next-to-last batter Ryan faced in his career; that record has since been surpassed.

Bill James focuses on this dichotomy between Ryan&#x27;s positive and negative statistics. While ranking him as the 24th best pitcher of all time, he notes, &quot;Ryan has been retired almost ten years [in 2001], in another ten perhaps we will begin to get a little bit of perspective on him. Ryan&#x27;s log of spectacular accomplishments is as thick as Bill Clinton&#x27;s little black book; his list of flaws and failures is lengthy but dry, and will never make for good reading.&quot;

Other writers have delved more into the specifics of James&#x27; general concerns. ESPN writer Rob Neyer stated in a 2003 column that while Ryan was among the 20 best pitchers since World War II, he &quot;often had trouble throwing strikes, [and] he wasn&#x27;t any good at fielding his position&quot;. In another column, Neyer, while stating that Ryan belonged in the Hall of Fame, pointed to Ryan&#x27;s record-breaking walks total and noted that his .309 on-base percentage against &quot;wasn&#x27;t even close to being in the top 100&quot;.

Ryan and Frank Robinson are the only two major league players to have their number retired by three teams on which they played. The California Angels retired the number 30 on June 16, 1992; the Texas Rangers retired his number 34 on September 15, 1996; and the Houston Astros retired number 34 on September 29, 1996. His number was the first retired by the Rangers.

Ryan was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999 in his first year of eligibility with 98.79% of the vote (491 out of 497 possible), six votes short of a unanimous election and the sixth-highest percentage in history, behind Mariano Rivera (100%, 425 out of 425 possible), Derek Jeter (99.75%, 396 out of 397 possible), Ichiro Suzuki (99.75%, 393 out of 394 possible), Ken Griffey Jr. (99.32%, 437 out of 440 possible), and Tom Seaver (98.84%, 425 out of 430 possible). He chose to wear a Rangers cap for his HOF plaque to reflect his Texas heritage, as well as the fact that his 300th win, 5000th strikeout, and last two no-hitters came as a Ranger. He was the first Hall of Famer inducted as a Ranger. However, the Hall of Fame recognizes the Los Angeles Angels as his primary team.

In 1999, he ranked 41st on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. He was inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame in 2003, and named the Rangers&#x27;, and Astros&#x27; Hometown Hero in 2006—the only player to be so named by two franchises. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Ryan at number 50 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

In 2011, he was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame.

In 1992, the United States Mint produced a $1 commemorative coin honoring Olympic baseball depicting a pitcher in a USA Baseball uniform in a pose nearly identical to Ryan&#x27;s photo on his 1991 Fleer baseball card. The numismatic community subsequently referred to the coin as the &quot;Nolan Ryan dollar.&quot;

In 1995 the Texas State Legislature declared State Highway 288, which passes near Alvin, as the Nolan Ryan Expressway.

The Alvin Independent School District opened Nolan Ryan Junior High School, located at 11500 Shadow Creek Parkway (FM 2234) in Pearland, Texas, just a few hundred yards away from the Nolan Ryan Expressway.

The Nolan Ryan Foundation is a Texas nonprofit organization that supports youth, education, and community development and is headquartered in Round Rock, Texas.

The Texas Trail of Fame inducted Ryan in 2009. The Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame inducted Ryan in 2010.

A documentary, &quot;Facing Nolan&quot;, was released in 2022.

== Personal life ==
Ryan married his high school sweetheart, Ruth Holdorff, on June 26, 1967. Nolan and Ruth attended Alvin High School together. Ruth was a high school state tennis champion. They have three children: Reid, Reese, and Wendy. Reid and Reese were both pitchers for the TCU Horned Frogs. Reid also pitched briefly in the minor leagues. On May 17, 2013, Reid was announced as president of the Houston Astros.

Nolan frequently pitched in the off-seasons, with Ruth often donning catching gear and serving as his catcher. Ruth Ryan also coached their sons&#x27; little league teams for a few summers.

Nolan Ryan resides in the Cimarron Hills community in Georgetown, Texas.

===Political activity===

Ryan wrote in his 1992 autobiography &quot;Miracle Man&quot; that he voted for Jimmy Carter over Gerald Ford in 1976, but since then has generally identified as a Republican, though he does not automatically vote this way and looks at individual candidates, mentioning disgust at one particular election in which the two major parties were forcing a choice between &quot;the racist or the criminal.&quot; He also crossed party lines in 2002 to headline a group of Republicans and Independents supporting a Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Texas. He has maintained a decades-long friendship with the Bush family, partially due to George W. Bush being a part-owner of the Rangers while Ryan played there. However, in his 1992 book Ryan expressed some criticisms of the elder Bush&#x27;s (George H.W. Bush) management of domestic issues and said he wasn&#x27;t &quot;locked in&quot; to voting for Bush that fall. In 1996 Ryan campaigned on behalf of Ron Paul in the election for Texas&#x27;s 14th congressional district; his hometown of Alvin was located in the district.

On April 7, 2011, Todd Staples announced that Nolan Ryan would be his statewide chairman for his exploratory committee for lieutenant governor. Ryan is quoted as saying, &quot;Todd Staples is the top prospect for the Texas Republican Party in 2014.&quot; Staples, however, lost that race to current Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick of Houston.

<text>Leo I (; 401 – 18 January 474), also known as &quot;the Thracian&quot; (; ), was Eastern Roman emperor from 457 to 474. He was a native of Dacia Aureliana near historic Thrace. He is sometimes surnamed with the epithet &quot;the Great&quot; (; ), probably to distinguish him from his young grandson and co-&quot;augustus&quot; Leo II ().

During his 17-year rule, he oversaw a number of ambitious political and military plans, aimed mostly at aiding the faltering Western Roman Empire and recovering its former territories. He is notable for being the first Eastern Emperor to legislate in Koine Greek rather than Late Latin. He is commemorated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, with his feast day on 20 January.

== Reign ==
He was born in Thracia or in Dacia Aureliana province in the year 401 to a Thraco-Roman family. His Dacian origin is mentioned by Candidus Isaurus, while John Malalas believes that he was of Bessian Thracian stock. According to the &quot;Patria of Constantinople&quot; he had one sister, Euphemia, who never married; Leo is said to have visited her in Constantinople on a weekly basis, and she later erected a statue in his honor. The late and not particularly reliable source for Euphemia leaves her existence open to doubt. Leo served in the Roman army, rising to the rank of &quot;comes rei militaris&quot;. He was the last of a series of emperors placed on the throne by Aspar, the Alan serving as commander-in-chief of the army, who thought Leo would be an easy puppet ruler. Instead, Leo became more and more independent from Aspar, causing tension that would culminate in Aspar&#x27;s assassination.

Leo&#x27;s coronation as emperor on 7 February 457, was the first to add a Christian element to the traditional Roman procedure. Though he was already crowned by the &quot;campidoctor&quot; in the official coronation ceremony at Hebdomon, he went to Hagia Sophia and deposited his crown at the altar. As he left the church, Patriarch of Constantinople placed the crown back on his head, a fact which symbolized the transformation of Roman imperial traditions into Medieval Roman and Christian ones. This Christian coronation ritual was later imitated by courts all over Europe. 

His coronation &quot;adventus&quot; gave a key role to Aspar, who rode with Leo in his chariot during the procession in Constantinople and offered him a golden crown when they arrived at the Forum of Constantine.


Leo I made an alliance with the Isaurians and was thus able to eliminate Aspar. The price of the alliance was the marriage of Leo&#x27;s daughter to Tarasicodissa, leader of the Isaurians, who, as Zeno, became emperor in 474. In 469, Aspar attempted to assassinate Zeno and very nearly succeeded. Finally, in 471, Aspar&#x27;s son Ardabur was implicated in a plot against Leo but was killed by palace eunuchs acting on Leo&#x27;s orders.

Leo sometimes overestimated his abilities and made mistakes that threatened the internal order of the Empire. The Balkans were ravaged by the Ostrogoths, after a disagreement between the Emperor and the young chief Theodoric the Great, who had been raised at Leo&#x27;s court in Constantinople, where he was steeped in Roman government and military tactics. There were also some raids by the Huns. However, none of these attackers had the siege engines necessary to capture Constantinople, whose walls had been rebuilt and reinforced in the reign of Theodosius II.

Leo&#x27;s reign was also noteworthy for his influence in the Western Roman Empire, marked by his appointment of Anthemius as Western Roman emperor in 467. He attempted to build on this political achievement with an expedition against the Vandals in 468. 1,113 ships carrying 100,000 men participated in the expedition, which ended in defeat because of bad leadership from Leo&#x27;s brother-in-law Basiliscus. This disaster drained the Empire of men and money. Procopius estimated the costs of the expedition to be 130,000 pounds of gold; John the Lydian estimated the costs to be 65,000 pounds of gold and 750,000 pounds of silver.

In 472, Leo issued an edict which stipulated that high-ranking officers who permitted pagan sacrifices on their land were to be demoted and have their possessions confiscated. Lower-ranking offenders were to be tortured and condemned to labour in the mines.

Leo died of dysentery at the age of 73 on 18 January 474.

== Marriage and children ==
Leo and Verina had three children. Their eldest daughter Ariadne was born prior to the death of Marcian (reigned 450 – 457). Ariadne had a younger sister, Leontia. Leontia was first betrothed to Patricius, a son of Aspar, but their engagement was probably annulled when Aspar and another of his sons, Ardabur, were assassinated in 471. Leontia then married Marcian, a son of Emperor Anthemius and Marcia Euphemia. The couple led a failed revolt against Zeno in 478–479. They were exiled to Isauria following their defeat.

An unknown son was born in 463. He died five months following his birth. The only sources about him are a horoscope by Rhetorius and a hagiography of Daniel the Stylite.

 The &quot;Georgian Chronicle&quot;, a 13th-century compilation drawing from earlier sources, reports a marriage of Vakhtang I of Iberia to Princess Helena of Byzantium, identifying her as a daughter of the predecessor of Zeno. This predecessor was probably Leo I, the tale attributing a third daughter to Leo. Cyril Toumanoff identified two children of this marriage: Mithridates of Iberia; and Leo of Iberia. This younger Leo was father of Guaram I of Iberia. The accuracy of the descent is unknown.
