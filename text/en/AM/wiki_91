<text>The Black Pirate is a 1926 American silent action adventure film shot entirely in two-color Technicolor about an adventurer and a &quot;company&quot; of pirates. Directed by Albert Parker, it stars Douglas Fairbanks, Donald Crisp, Sam De Grasse, and Billie Dove. In 1993, &quot;The Black Pirate&quot; was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures to be added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==

Pirates capture, badly maul and loot a ship. After relieving the ship and crew of valuables, the pirates fire the ship, blowing up the gunpowder on board, sinking her. While the pirates celebrate, two survivors wash up on an island, an old man and his son. Before dying, the older man gives his signet ring to his son. His son buries him, vowing vengeance.

The Pirate Captain and Lieutenant bring some crew to the other side of the same island to bury some of their plunder. They then plan to murder the other pirates: &quot;Dead men tell no tales.&quot; But first, the son appears as the &quot;Black Pirate&quot;, who offers to join their company and fight their best man to prove his worth. After much fighting, the Black Pirate kills the Pirate Captain. The Pirate Lieutenant sneers, and says there is more to being a pirate than sword tricks. To further prove his worth, the Black Pirate says he will capture the next ship of prey single-handed, which he does. He then uses his wits to prevent the pirates from blowing up the ship along with the crew and passengers, suggesting that they hold the ship for ransom.

When a woman is discovered on board, the Pirate Lieutenant claims her. Being in love at first sight for her, the Black Pirate finds a way to temporarily save her from this fate by presenting her as a &quot;princess&quot; and urging the crew to use her as a hostage to ensure their ransom will be paid, as long as she remains &quot;spotless and unharmed&quot;.

The pirates cheer the Black Pirate, and want to name him captain. The Pirate Lieutenant jeers but consents to wait to see if the ransom is paid by noon the next day. However, he secretly has a confederate destroy the ransom ship later that night to ensure it will not return. Then, when the Black Pirate is caught trying to release the woman, the Pirate Lieutenant exposes him as a traitor and the pirates force him to walk the plank.

At noon the next day, with the ransom ship having failed to show, the Pirate Lieutenant goes to the woman to claim his prize. But just then, the Black Pirate, who with the help of the sympathetic one-armed pirate MacTavish, had survived being sent overboard, returns leading troops to stop the pirates. After a long fight, the pirates are routed. In the end, the Black Pirate is revealed to be a Duke, and the &quot;Princess&quot; he loves a noble Lady. Even MacTavish is moved to tears of joy by the happy ending.

==Production notes==
Donald Crisp (MacTavish) had directed Fairbanks&#x27; &quot;Don Q, Son of Zorro&quot; (1925) in addition to playing the villain in that film. Crisp, who had been in films for over a decade at this point, was also a major director of silent films. He continued as a character actor for another forty years, winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1942 (&quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;).

The script was adapted by Jack Cunningham from a story by Fairbanks, who used his middle names &quot;Elton Thomas&quot; as a pseudonym. The film was directed by Albert Parker.

Fairbanks had conceived of the film as early as 1920 or 1921, after finishing &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;. He was allegedly inspired to produce the film after a conversation with Jackie Coogan. Off-hand, Coogan had mentioned how much he loved the &quot;Book of Pirates&quot; by Howard Pyle. Fairbanks and his art director, Carl Oscar Borg, sought to replicate Pyle&#x27;s evocative illustrations in the film.

Fairbanks&#x27; wife Mary Pickford doubled for Dove for the kiss between the Princess and Black Pirate at the end of the film.

==Technicolor==
&quot;The Black Pirate&quot; was the third feature to be filmed in an early two-tone Technicolor process that had been first introduced in the 1922 feature &quot;The Toll of the Sea&quot;. This reproduces a limited but pleasing range of colors. &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; – filmed around the same time – contains two-tone sequences but is shot primarily in black-and-white with tinting and toning in many scenes.

Fairbanks spent considerable money on color tests before making &quot;Pirate&quot;. Two-tone Technicolor at that time required two strips of 35mm film to be fused together back-to-back to create the two-tone palette. Due to the heat of the projector, there would be so-called cupping of the film, making it difficult to keep the film in focus during projection. (Technicolor later perfected its process, so that two-color films required only a single strip of film.) A limitation of the process was that hues on film shot indoors under artificial light differed from that shot outdoors in sunlight, so two sets of costumes with slightly different colors for each character were required to get matching colors in the final film.

==Legacy==

Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance maintains that “&quot;The Black Pirate&quot; was the most carefully prepared and controlled work of Fairbanks’s entire career” and “the most important feature-length silent film designed entirely for color cinematography.” Vance believes the limitations imposed by early Technicolor forced him to remove the &quot;pageantry and visual effects&quot; of his earlier swashbuckler and produce a straightforward action adventure. &quot;The result was a refreshing return to form and a dazzling new showcase for the actor-producer’s favorite production value: himself. Fairbanks is resplendent as the bold buccaneer and buoyed by a production brimming with rip-roaring adventure and spiced with exceptional stunts and swordplay, including the celebrated ‘sliding down the sails’ sequence, arguably the most famous set piece of the entire Fairbanks treasure chest.”

A two-year-long restoration of &quot;The Black Pirate&quot; was begun in 1970 by the British National Film Archive at the request of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. One original release print and two incomplete negatives were used to restore the film. In addition to the surviving color film, some black and white outtakes and test footage have been found and included in the Blu-ray release of the film, with narration by Rudy Behlmer.

The film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1993.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2001: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills – Nominated
* 2003: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains:
** “The Black Pirate” – Nominated Hero

==In popular culture==

*The sail-sliding scene was replicated in other pirate-themed media, including &quot;Against All Flags&quot;, &quot;Rage of the Buccaneers&quot;, &quot;The Goonies&quot;, &quot;Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds&quot;, and the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; IDW comic &quot;Turtles in Time&quot; #3 (August 2014).
*The Marx Bros 1935 movie &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; ends with a scene of chaos during an operatic performance. Drops and flies appear as would-it-be painted sails of Fairbanks&#x27; pirate ship as Harpo swings on ropes between them, ultimately descending down one, legs astride a splitting scene-painted canvas – a full sail-slide descent.
*It was also subjected to a test by &quot;MythBusters&quot;, where the stunt was declared implausible (&quot;busted&quot;).

<text>Blacksmith Scene (also known as Blacksmith Scene #1 and Blacksmithing Scene) is an 1893 American short black-and-white silent film directed by William K.L. Dickson, the Scottish-French inventor who, while under the employ of Thomas Edison, developed one of the first fully functional motion picture cameras. It is historically significant as the first Kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition on May 9, 1893, and is the earliest known example of actors performing a role in a film. It was also the first U.S. motion picture film ever copyrighted that same year. 102 years later, in 1995, &quot;Blacksmithing Scene&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. It is the second-oldest film included in the Registry, after &quot;Newark Athlete&quot; (1891).

==Production==
The film was produced by the Edison Manufacturing Company, which had begun making films in 1890 under the direction of William K.L. Dickson. It was filmed entirely within the Black Maria studio at West Orange, New Jersey, in the United States, which is widely referred to as &quot;America&#x27;s First Movie Studio&quot;. It is believed to have been filmed in April 1893 and was shown publicly, in a Kinetoscope viewer, at the Brooklyn Institute on May 9, 1893.

According to the Internet Movie Database, the film was made in a 35 mm format with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1. The movie was intended to be displayed on a Kinetoscope. Dickson selected a lens that worked best for medium shots and medium close-up shots and probably stationed his camera approximately ten to twelve feet from the anvil.

The men featured are not true blacksmiths, nor are they in a blacksmith shop working on metal: they are performers on a set pretending to be blacksmiths and to have a drink in between. While the background is simply left black, the crew went through some trouble to bring in a real anvil, real sledgehammers and leather aprons.

== Current status ==
A surviving 35-mm print of this film was found at the Henry Ford Museum; it is the source of the negative preserved by the Museum of Modern Art film archive. Another copy is at the Edison National Historic Site, administered by the National Park Service. Because the film was finished before 1925, its copyright has expired; it is freely available on the World Wide Web.

<doc id="73373" wikidata="Q1165349" url="?curid=73373" title="Malvasia">
<text>Malvasia (), also known as Malvazia, is a group of wine grape varieties grown historically in the Mediterranean region and Macaronesia, but now grown in many of the winemaking regions of the world. In the past, the names Malvasia, Malvazia, and Malmsey have been used interchangeably for Malvasia-based wines; however, in modern oenology, &quot;Malmsey&quot; is now used almost exclusively for a sweet variety of Madeira wine made from the Malvasia grape. Grape varieties in this family include Malvasia bianca, Malvasia di Schierano, Malvasia negra, , Malvasia nera di Brindisi, Malvasia di Candia aromatica, Malvasia odorosissima, and a number of other varieties.

Malvasia wines are produced in Greece (regions of Peloponnese, Cyclades and Crete), Italy (including Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Lombardia, Apulia, Sicily, Lipari, Emilia-Romagna, and Sardinia), Slovenia (including Istria), Croatia (including Istria), Corsica, the Iberian Peninsula, the Canary Islands, the island of Madeira, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Australia and Brazil. These grapes are used to produce white (and more rarely red) table wines, dessert wines, and fortified wines of the same name, or are sometimes used as part of a blend of grapes, such as in Vin Santo.

==History==
Most ampelographers believe that the Malvasia family of grapes are of ancient origin, most likely originating in Crete, Greece. The name &quot;Malvasia&quot; comes from the Italian name for Monemvasia, a medieval and early Renaissance Byzantine fortress on the coast of Laconia; the town&#x27;s port acted as a trading center for wine produced in the eastern Peloponnese and perhaps in some of the Cyclades. During the Middle Ages, the Venetians became so prolific in the trading of Malvasia wine that merchant wine-shops in Venice were known as &quot;malvasie&quot;. The occasional claim that the name might come from the district of Malevizi, near Iraklion, Crete, is not taken seriously by scholars.

Malmsey was one of the three major wines exported from Greece in medieval times. (For other examples, see Rumney wine and Cretan wine). It is alleged that when Edward IV of England convicted his brother, George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, of high treason, his private execution (1478) consisted of being &quot;drowned in a butt of malmsey wine&quot;, as dramatized in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;.
Both Monemvasia and Candia have lent their names to modern grape varieties. In Greece there is a variety known as Monemvasia, evidently named after the port, though now grown primarily in the Cyclades. In western Europe, a common variety of Malvasia is known as &quot;Malvasia Bianca di Candia&quot; (white malmsey of Crete), from its reputed origin in that area. The Monemvasia grape was long thought to be ancestral to the western European Malvasia varieties, but recent DNA analysis does not suggest a close relationship between Monemvasia and any Malvasia varieties. DNA analysis does, however, suggest that the Athiri wine grape (a variety widely planted throughout Greece) is ancestral to Malvasia.

==Grape varieties and wine regions==
Most varieties of Malvasia are closely related to Malvasia bianca. One notable exception is the variety known as Malvasia di Candia which is a distinctly different sub-variety of Malvasia. Malvasia bianca is grown widely throughout the world in places like Italy; Sitges in Catalonia, with the renowned variety Malvasia de Sitges; the San Joaquin Valley of California; or the Greek Islands of Paros and Syros. Throughout Central Italy, Malvasia is often blended with Trebbiano to add flavor and texture to the wine. In Rioja, it performs a similar function when blended with Viura.

=== Catalan variety ===
==== Malvasia de Sitges ====
With recorded presence in Catalonia since early 14th century. Legend has it that a soldier from the Almogàvers fleet commanded by Roger de Flor brought a stem of malvasia from the eastern Mediterranean. But the &quot;Chronicle&quot; (1325) by Ramon Muntaner acknowledges its name, value and origin. It was widely grown and exported since medieval times until the advent of phylloxera. Being prone to mildew and other attacks, its cultivation now is much diminished, but the wines produced with it are still highly appreciated globally.

This variety is now only grown in the countryside of Sitges and its surroundings. The grape must, once fermented, gives way to a fragrant, sweet drink with a high alcohol content which is usually drunk after celebrations and after the &quot;xatonadas&quot;. Nevertheless, it is also used in the preparation of various meat dishes, such as duck breast with raisins or pig&#x27;s trotters. Its unusual bouquet is the result of various factors: proximity to the sea, a late harvest and the considerable alcohol content and acidity of the wine.

Malvasia de Sitges is an authorised vine variety in the DOPs of Penedès and Catalunya.

===Croatian varieties===
; Malvazija Istarska

Malvazija Istarska got the name after peninsula of Istria shared between Croatia, Slovenia and Italy (see also Slovene and Italian varieties). It represents one of the main white wines of Croatian Istria and the north Dalmatian coast. The vine was introduced to the area by Venetian merchants who brought cuttings from Greece. The malvasia is called &quot;malvazija&quot; in Croatian. It is the main white wine in the region.

; Other

The Dalmatian &quot;Maraština&quot; (also known as &quot;Rukatac&quot; etc.) is identical to the Italian variety &quot;Malvasia Lunga&quot;.

===Italian varieties===
; Malvasia Bianca di Candia
Malvasia Bianca di Candia is Italy&#x27;s most widely planted Malvasia. 

; Malvasia Istriana
In Italy this wine is grown in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region in Collio DOC and Isonzo DOC. The name comes from the Istria peninsula, which takes in parts of Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy (see also Croatian and Slovene varieties). The vine was introduced into the area by Venetian merchants who brought cuttings from Greece. Malvasia Istriana is also found in the Colli Piacentini region of Emilia, where it is used to make sparkling wine known locally as &quot;champagnino&quot; or &quot;little Champagne&quot;.

; Malvasia di Grottaferrata, Malvasia di Bosa, Malvasia di Planargia
In the 19th century and early 20th century, sweet &quot;passito&quot; style dessert wines made from the Malvasia grape were held in high esteem and considered among Italy&#x27;s finest wines. Following the Second World War, lack of interest in the consumer market led to a sharp decline in plantings, with many varieties going to the verge of extinction. Today only a few dedicated producers are still making these Malvasia dessert wines from local varieties including the Malvasia di Grottaferrata in Lazio and the Malvasia di Bosa and Malvasia di Planargia in Sardinia.

; Malvasia delle Lipari
Since the 1980s, dessert wines made from the Malvasia delle Lipari variety has seen a resurgence in interest on the volcanic Aeolian Islands off the north east coast of Sicily. With distinctive orange notes, this Sicilian wine saw its peak of popularity just before the phylloxera epidemic, when more than 2.6 million gallons (100,000 hectoliters) were produced annually.
While most varieties of Malvasia produce white wine, is a red wine variety that in Italy is used primarily as a blending grape, being valued for the dark color and aromatic qualities it can add to a wine. Piedmont is the only significant region to make this varietal , with two DOC zones covering less than 250 acres (100 hectares): Malvasia di Casorzo and Malvasia di Castelnuovo Don Bosco. In the Apulian regions of Brindisi and Lecce it is blended with Negroamaro, while in the 1970s &amp; 1980s, it was a frequent blending partner of Sangiovese in Tuscany. In recent times, Cabernet Sauvignon has been supplanting in Tuscany in both planting and in use as a blending partner with Sangiovese. Other regions growing include the Bolzano region of Alto Adige, Sardinia, Basilicata and Calabria. wines are often noted for their rich chocolate notes with black plums and floral aromas.

; Malvasia di Candia, Malvasia Puntinata, Malvasia di Lazio
The Lazio region of Frascati is the source of the majority of plantings of Malvasia di Candia, a distinct sub-variety of Malvasia that is not part of the Malvasia bianca branch of the grape family. It is most often used for blending with the related Malvasia Puntinata and Malvasia di Lazio being more highly prized due to their higher acidity and tendency to produce less flabby wines.

===Portuguese varieties===
In Portugal, there are no fewer than 12 varieties known as &quot;Malvasia&quot;. They may or may not be related to true Malvasia. 

; Malvasia Fina
In 2004, there was nearly 18,533 acres (7500 ha) of Malvasia Fina grown in Portugal where it is also known as Boal (though it is most likely not related to the grape Bual which is used to produce the Boal style of Madeira). Malvasia Fina is found in the Douro where it is a permitted grape in the production of white Port. It is also found in the Tejo and the Dão DOC where it is grown on vineyard land located at high elevations. 

; Malvasia Candida
Malvasia Candida (different from the variety known as Malvasia di Candia) has been historically grown on the island of Madeira being used to produce the sweetest style of Madeira wine known Malmsey.

; Malvasia Rei
Malvasia Rei is believed to be the Palomino grown in Spain for Sherry production which may be related to the Malvasia family. In Portugal, Malvasia Rei is grown in the Douro, Beiras and Lisboa region. 

; Malvasia Corada
Malvasia Corada is a synonym used in the Douro for an obscure white wine grape variety known as Vital that may or may not be related to true Malvasia. 

; Malvasia da Trincheira
Malvasia da Trincheira is a synonym used in the Douro for the white Port grape Folgasão that may or may not be related to true Malvasia.

===Slovene variety===
; Istrska Malvazija or simply Malvazija
: (Italian Malvasia Istriana and Croatian Malvazija Istarska)

In Slovenian Istria the malvasia grape is grown in Koper area, especially on Debeli Rtič, Škocjan, Kortina and Labor. It is also grown in Italy and Croatia (see Italian and Croatian varieties). The vine was introduced to the area in the 14th century by Venetian merchants who brought cuttings from Greece. Over matured grapes give a dessert wine with non-fermented sugars and high alcohol level (around 12%) called &quot;sweet malvasia&quot; (Slovene and Croatian: sladka/slatka malvazija).

===Spanish varieties===
In Spain the Malvasía name is a synonym for Alarije, a white grape variety from Extremadura, south-west Spain, but this variety is genetically distinct from the true Malvasias of Malvasi di Lipari (under the Spanish name Malvasía Rosada) and Malvasía de Lanzarote grown in Canary Islands. Malvasía de Lanzarote is a white variety from the Canary Islands, that may be a natural cross between Mavasi di Lipari and Marmajuelo.

; Malvasía Rosada 
Malvasía Rosada is a red grape variety that is a colour mutation of Malvasi di Lipari / Malvasía de Sitges, and grown on the Canary Islands.

; Malvasia Fina
The name Malvasia Fina is for a Portuguese variety that goes under the synonyms Gual and Torrontés in Spain.

===Common synonyms===
The various varieties of Malvasia are known under a wide range of synonyms including Malvasier in Germany, Malvazija and Malvazia in Istria. Despite its similar-sounding name, the French grape varieties (it is a widely used synonym) referred to variously as &quot;Malvoisie&quot; are not related to Malvasia. The one possible exception may be the Malvoisie of Corsica that ampelographers believe is actually the Vermentino grape that may be related to Malvasia. Other synonyms for the various sub-varieties of Malvasia include Uva Greca, Rojal, Subirat, Blanquirroja, Blancarroga, Tobia, Cagazal and Blanca-Rioja.

==Viticulture==
While differences among the many sub-varieties of Malvasia exist, there are some common viticultural characteristics of the family. Malvasia tends to prefer dry climates with vineyards planted on sloping terrain of well-drained soils. In damp conditions, the vine can be prone to developing various grape diseases such as mildew and rot. The rootstock is moderately vigorous and capable of producing high yields if not kept in check.

==Wines==
Given the broad expanse of the Malvasia family, generalizations about the Malvasia wine are difficult to pinpoint. Most varieties of Malvasia are derived from Malvasia bianca which is characterized by its deep color, noted aromas and the presence of some residual sugar. The red varieties of Malvasia tend to make wines with pale, pinkish to light red color. In their youth, Malvasia wines are characterized by their heavy body that is often described as &quot;round&quot; or &quot;fat&quot; and soft texture in the mouth. Common aroma notes associated with Malvasia include peaches, apricots and white currants. Red Malvasia wines are characterized by a richness and chocolate notes. Fortified Malvasia, such as Madeira, are noted for their intense smokey notes and sharp acidity. As Malvasia ages, the wines tend to take on more nutty aromas and flavors though many Malvasia have a short life span of only a few years after vintage.

===Malmsey===
In the past, the names &quot;Malvasia&quot; and &quot;Malmsey&quot; occurred interchangeably. , however, &quot;Malvasia&quot; generally refers to unfortified white table or dessert wines produced from this grape, while &quot;Malmsey&quot; refers to a sweet variety of Madeira wine, though this is also sometimes called &quot;Malvasia&quot; or &quot;Malvazia&quot;. Further confusion results from the fact that, in the past, the term &quot;Malmsey&quot; referred to any very sweet Madeira wine, regardless of the grape variety involved. This resulted from the devastation of Madeiran vineyards by phylloxera in the late 19th century, which greatly reduced the production of Malvasia and other &quot;noble grape&quot; varieties on Madeira for the next century. As a result, most non-vintage-dated &quot;Malmsey&quot; was made from the widely grown Tinta Negra Mole or even from fox grape varieties. This changed when Portugal entered the European Union (EU) in 1986; EU regulations required that any wine bearing the name &quot;Malmsey&quot; contain at least 85% Malvasia grapes. Even further confusion results from the fact that vintage-dated Malmseys are often labeled &quot;Malvasia&quot; or &quot;Malvazia&quot;, probably because the relatively rare vintage Malvasias were always made with Malvasia grapes even when most non-vintage &quot;Malmsey&quot; came from lesser varieties. Some companies occasionally use the name &quot;Malvasia&quot; or &quot;Malvazia&quot; for non-vintage Madeiras, especially those primarily marketed to Portuguese-speaking countries.

English historical tradition associates Malmsey wine with the death of George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, brother of King Edward IV of England. Following his conviction for treason, he was &quot;privately executed&quot; at the Tower on 18 February 1478, by tradition in the Bowyer Tower, and soon after the event, the rumour gained ground that he was drowned in a butt of Malmsey wine.

<text>A mercenary is a private individual who joins an armed conflict for personal profit, is otherwise an outsider to the conflict, and is not a member of any other official military. Mercenaries fight for money or other forms of payment rather than for political interests.

Beginning in the 20th century, mercenaries have increasingly come to be seen as less entitled to protection by rules of war than non-mercenaries. The Geneva Conventions declare that mercenaries are not recognized as legitimate combatants and do not have to be granted the same legal protections as captured service personnel of the armed forces. In practice, whether or not a person is a mercenary may be a matter of degree, as financial and political interests may overlap.

==International and national laws of war==
Protocol Additional GC 1977 (APGC77) is a 1977 amendment protocol to the Geneva Conventions. Article 47 of the protocol provides the most widely accepted international definition of a mercenary, though it is not endorsed by some countries, including the United States. The &quot;Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts&quot; (Protocol I), 8 June 1977 states:
All the criteria, as listed in 2(a) through 2(f), must be met, according to the Geneva Convention, for a combatant to be considered a mercenary. While mercenaries do not enjoy the same protection as prisoners of war do, they must still be treated humanely according to the rules of the Protocol and they may not be punished without a trial.

On 4 December 1989, the United Nations passed resolution 44/34, the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries. It entered into force on 20 October 2001 and is usually known as the UN Mercenary Convention. Article 1 of the UN Mercenary Convention contains the definition of a mercenary. Article 1.1 is similar to Article 47 of Protocol I. Article 1.2 broadens the definition to include a non-national recruited to overthrow a &quot;Government or otherwise undermin[e] the constitutional order of a State; or Undermin[e] the territorial integrity of a State&quot;; and &quot;Is motivated to take part therein essentially by the desire for significant private gain and is prompted by the promise or payment of material compensation&quot;. Under Article 1.2, a person does not have to take a direct part in the hostilities in a planned &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; to be a mercenary.

===Austria===
If a person is proven to have worked as a mercenary for any other country while retaining Austrian citizenship, their Austrian citizenship will be revoked.

===France===
In 2003, France criminalized mercenary activities, as defined by the protocol to the Geneva convention for French citizens, permanent residents, and legal entities (Penal Code, L436-1, L436-2, L436-3, L436-4, L436-5). This law does not prevent French citizens from serving as volunteers in foreign forces. The law applies to military activities with a specifically mercenary motive or with a mercenary level of remuneration. However, due to jurisdictional loopholes several French companies provide mercenary services.

The French state owns 50% of Défense conseil international, which it founded, a private military company (PMC) which does not supply any fighters but is used to export military training services. It realised a profit of €222 million in 2019.

===Germany===
It is an offence &quot;to recruit&quot; German citizens &quot;for military duty in a military or military-like facility in support of a foreign power&quot; (§109h StGB).
Furthermore, a German citizen who enlists in the armed forces of a state they are also a citizen of risks the loss of their citizenship
( StAG).

===South Africa===
In 1998, South Africa passed the Foreign Military Assistance Act that banned citizens and residents from any involvement in foreign wars, except for humanitarian operations, unless a government committee approved deployment. In 2005, the legislation was reviewed by the government because:

* South African citizens were working as security guards in Iraq during the American occupation of Iraq; 
* consequences of the mercenary soldier sponsorship case against Mark Thatcher for the &quot;possible funding and logistical assistance in relation to an alleged attempted coup in Equatorial Guinea&quot; organized by Simon Mann.

As of 2010, South Africa forbids citizens from fighting in foreign wars unless they are under the direct control of their own national armed forces.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the Foreign Enlistment Act 1819 and the Foreign Enlistment Act 1870 make it unlawful for British subjects to join the armed forces of any state warring with another state at peace with Britain. During the Greek War of Independence, British volunteers fought with the Greek rebels, which could have been unlawful per the Foreign Enlistment Act. It was unclear whether or not the Greek rebels constituted a &#x27;state&#x27;, but the law was later clarified to indicate that they were.

The British government considered using the Act against British subjects fighting for the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War and the FNLA in the Angolan Civil War, but on both occasions chose not to do so.

===United States===
Civilians with the US Armed Forces lose their law of war protection from direct attack if, and for such time as, they directly participate in hostilities.

The Anti-Pinkerton Act of 1893 () forbids the US government from using Pinkerton National Detective Agency employees or similar private police companies.

In 1977, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit interpreted the Anti-Pinkerton Act as forbidding the U.S. government from employing companies offering &quot;mercenary, quasi-military forces&quot; for hire (United States ex rel. &quot;Weinberger v. Equifax&quot;, 557 F.2d 456, 462 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1035 (1978)). There is disagreement over whether this proscription is limited to strikebreakers only, because &quot;Weinberger v. Equifax&quot; states the following:

In the 7 June 1978 Letter to the heads of Federal Departments and Agencies, the Comptroller General interpreted this decision in a way that carved out an exemption for &quot;Guard and Protective Services&quot;.

A United States Department of Defense (DoD) interim rule revised DoD Instruction 3020.41 to authorize contractors, other than private security contractors, to use deadly force against enemy armed forces only in self-defense (71 Fed. Reg. 34826), effective 16 June 2006. Per that interim rule, private security contractors were authorized to use deadly force when protecting their client&#x27;s assets and persons, consistent with their contract&#x27;s mission statement. One interpretation is that this authorized contractors to engage in combat on behalf of the US government. It is the combatant commander&#x27;s responsibility to ensure that private security contract mission statements do not authorize performance of inherently governmental military functions, i.e. preemptive attacks, assaults, or raids, etc.

On 18 August 2006, the US Comptroller General rejected bid protest arguments that the United States Army contracts violated the Anti-Pinkerton Act by requiring that contractors provide armed convoy escort vehicles and labor, weapons, and equipment for internal security operations at Victory Base Complex in Iraq. The Comptroller General reasoned the act was unviolated because the contracts did not require contractors to provide quasi-military forces as strikebreakers.

In 2007, the US Army was temporarily barred from awarding a $475 million security contract in Iraq, the largest one at that time, because of a lawsuit filed by a US citizen alleging violation of the Anti-Pinkerton Act of 1893. Three of the candidates under final consideration for the contract (to include intelligence services and security for reconstruction work by the United States Army Corps of Engineers) included British firms Aegis Defence Services and Erinys Iraq, as well as Blackwater of North Carolina. The case was later dismissed.

==Foreign national servicemen==
The better-known combat units in which foreign nationals serve in another country&#x27;s armed forces are the Gurkha regiments of the British Army and Indian Army, the French Foreign Legion, the Spanish Legion and the Ukraine Foreign Legion.

Recruits from countries of the Commonwealth of Nations in the British Army swear allegiance to the British monarch and are liable to operate in any unit. Gurkhas, however, operate in dedicated Gurkha units of the British Army (specifically units that are administered by the Brigade of Gurkhas) and the Indian Army. Although they are nationals of Nepal, a country that is not part of the Commonwealth, they still swear allegiance (either to the Crown or the Constitution of India) and abide by the rules and regulations under which all British or Indian soldiers serve. French Foreign Legionnaires serve in the French Foreign Legion, which deploys and fights as an organized unit of the French Army. This means that as members of the armed forces of Britain, India, and France these soldiers are not classed as mercenary soldiers per APGC77 Art 47.e and 47.f. Volunteers for the Ukraine Foreign legion have three-year contracts, and are eligible for Ukrainian citizenship (the probation period being the duration of the war).

==Private military companies==
The private military company (PMC) is a private company providing armed combat or security services for financial gain. PMCs refer to their personnel as security contractors or private military contractors. PMC contractors are civilians (in governmental, international, and civil organizations) authorized to accompany an army to the field; thus, the term &quot;civilian contractor&quot;. PMCs may use armed force, defined as: &quot;legally established enterprises that make a profit, by either providing services involving the potential exercise of [armed] force in a systematic way and by military means, and/or by the transfer of that potential to clients through training and other practices, such as logistics support, equipment procurement, and intelligence gathering&quot;.

Private paramilitary forces are functionally mercenary armies, though they may serve as security guards or military advisors; however, national governments reserve the right to control the number, nature, and armaments of such private armies, arguing that, provided they are not pro-actively employed in front-line combat, they are not mercenaries. In February 2002, a British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) report about PMCs noted that the demands of the military service from the UN and international civil organizations might mean that it is cheaper to pay PMCs than use soldiers. PMC &quot;civilian contractors&quot; tend to have poor reputations among professional government soldiers and officers—the U.S. Military Command has questioned their war zone behavior.

In September 2005, Brigadier General Karl Horst, deputy commander of the Third Infantry Division charged with Baghdad security after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, said of DynCorp and other PMCs:

In 2004, the US and Coalition governments hired PMCs for security in Iraq. In March 2004, four Blackwater employees escorting food supplies and other equipment were attacked and killed in Fallujah in a videotaped attack; the killings and subsequent dismemberments were a cause for the First Battle of Fallujah.

Afghan war operations also boosted the business. The United States has made extensive use of PMCs in Afghanistan since 2001, mostly in a defensive role. PMC teams have been used to guard bases and to protect VIPs from Taliban assassins, but almost never in offensive operations. One mercenary stated about his work in Afghanistan: &quot;We are there purely to protect the principals and get them out, we&#x27;re not there to get into huge firefights with the bad guys&quot;. One team from DynCorp provided bodyguards for President Hamid Karzai.

===Colombia===
In 2006, a US congressional report listed a number of PMCs and other enterprises that have signed contracts to carry out anti-narcotics operations and related activities as part of Plan Colombia. Referring to the use of American PMCs in Colombia, the former US Ambassador to Colombia Myles Frechette has said: &quot;Congress and the American people don&#x27;t want any servicemen killed overseas. So it makes sense that if contractors want to risk their lives, they get the job&quot;.

Not only have foreign PMCs worked in Colombia, but a disproportionate number of the mercenaries with PMCs are Colombian, as Colombia&#x27;s long history of civil war has led to a surplus of experienced soldiers. Also, Colombian soldiers are much cheaper than soldiers from developed countries. PMCs from several Middle Eastern countries have signed contracts with the Colombian Defense Ministry to carry out security or military activities.

===UN concerns over legality of PMCs===
The United Nations questions whether PMC soldiers are sufficiently accountable for their war zone actions. A common argument for using PMCs (used by the PMCs themselves), is that PMCs may be able to help combat genocide and civilian slaughter where the UN or other countries are unwilling or unable to intervene. Yet, after considering using PMCs to support UN operations, Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, decided against it.

In October 2007, the United Nations released a two-year study that stated, that although hired as &quot;security guards&quot;, private contractors were performing military duties. The report found that the use of contractors such as Blackwater was a &quot;new form of mercenary activity&quot; and illegal under international law.

Most countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, are not signatories to the 1989 United Nations Mercenary Convention banning the use of mercenaries. A spokesman for the U.S. Mission to U.N. denied that Blackwater security guards were mercenaries, saying &quot;Accusations that U.S. government-contracted security guards, of whatever nationality, are mercenaries is inaccurate and demeaning to men and women who put their lives on the line to protect people and facilities every day.&quot;

==History==
===Europe===

====Classical era====
=====Greek mercenaries in Persian Empire=====
* Xerxes I, King of Persia, employed Arcadian mercenaries during his invasion of Greece.
* In Anabasis, Xenophon recounts how Cyrus the Younger hired a large army of Greek mercenaries (the &quot;Ten Thousand&quot;) in 401 BC to seize the throne of Persia from his brother, Artaxerxes II. Though Cyrus&#x27; army was victorious at the Battle of Cunaxa, Cyrus himself was killed in battle and the expedition rendered moot. Stranded deep in enemy territory, the Spartan general Clearchus and most of the other Greek generals were subsequently killed by treachery. Xenophon played an instrumental role in encouraging &quot;The Ten Thousand&quot; Greek army to march north to the Black Sea in an epic fighting retreat.
* The Sileraioi were a group of ancient mercenaries most likely employed by the tyrant Dionysius I of Syracuse.
* In 378 BC the Persian Empire hired the Athenian general Iphicrates with his mercenaries in the Egyptian campaign.
* The Mania, who was a sub-satrap, used Greek mercenaries in order to capture other cities in the region.
* Memnon of Rhodes (380–333 BC) was the commander of the Greek mercenaries working for the Persian King Darius III when Alexander the Great of Macedonia invaded Persia in 334 BC and won the Battle of the Granicus River. Alexander also employed Greek mercenaries during his campaigns. These were men who fought for him directly and not those who fought in city-state units attached to his army.

=====Greek mercenaries in ancient India=====
Tamil poems described the Greek soldiers who served as mercenaries for Indian kings as: &quot;The valiant-eyed Yavanas (Greeks), whose bodies were strong and of terrible aspect&quot;.

Alfred Charles Auguste Foucher said that some of the troops of Mara in the Gandhara sculptures may represent Greek mercenaries.

Stephanus of Byzantium wrote about a city called Daedala or Daidala () in India, which he called Indo-Cretan, most probably because it was a settlement of Cretan mercenaries.

=====Carthage=====
* Carthage contracted Balearic Islands shepherds as slingers during the Punic Wars against Rome. The vast majority of the Carthaginian military – except the highest officers, the navy, and the home guard – were mercenaries.
* Xanthippus of Carthage was a Spartan mercenary general employed by Carthage.
* Greek mercenaries were hired by Carthage to fight against the Dionysius I of Syracuse. Dionysius made Carthage pay a very high ransom for the Carthaginian prisoners, but he left the Greek mercenaries prisoners free without any ransom. This made the Carthaginians suspicious of their Greek mercenaries and discharged them all from their service. With this trick Dionysius did not have to fight again against the Greek mercenaries of Carthage who were very dangerous enemies.

=====Byzantine Empire=====
In the late Roman Empire, it became increasingly difficult for Emperors and generals to raise military units from the citizenry for various reasons: lack of manpower, lack of time available for training, lack of materials, and, inevitably, political considerations. Therefore, beginning in the late 4th century, the empire often contracted whole bands of barbarians either within the legions or as autonomous foederati. The barbarians were Romanized and surviving veterans were established in areas requiring population. The Varangian Guard of the Byzantine Empire is the best known formation made up of barbarian mercenaries (see next section).

=====Other=====
* Members of independent Thracian tribes such as the Bessi and Dii often joined the ranks of large organized armies as mercenaries.
* The Sons of Mars were Italian mercenaries used by the Greek kings of Syracuse until after the Punic Wars.
* A figure in oral legend, Milesius was given the princess Scota after conducting a successful campaign for Ancient Egypt.
* Mithridates VI Eupator recruited a large number of Iranians along with the Galatians into the Pontic army during the Mithridatic Wars against Rome, using the Leucosyri, Persians and Scythians.
* Illyrians were hired across the Balkans and further. They were known for their unreliability.

====Medieval warfare====


Byzantine emperors followed the Roman practice and contracted foreigners especially for their personal corps guard called the Varangian Guard. They were chosen among war-prone peoples, of whom the Varangians (Norsemen) were preferred. Their mission was to protect the Emperor and Empire and since they did not have links to the Greeks, they were expected to be ready to suppress rebellions. One of the most famous guards was the future king Harald III of Norway, also known as Harald Hardrada (&quot;Hard-counsel&quot;), who arrived in Constantinople in 1035 and was employed as a Varangian Guard. He participated in eighteen battles and was promoted to , the commander of the Guard, before returning home in 1043. He was killed at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066 when his army was defeated by an English army commanded by King Harold Godwinson. The point at which the Varangians ceased to be in the service of the Roman Empire remains unclear.

In England at the time of the Norman Conquest, Flemings (natives of Flanders) formed a substantial mercenary element in the forces of William the Conqueror with many remaining in England as settlers under the Normans. Contingents of mercenary Flemish soldiers were to form significant forces in England throughout the time of the Norman and early Plantagenet dynasties (11th and 12th centuries). A prominent example of these were the Flemings who fought during the English civil wars, known as the Anarchy or the Nineteen-Year Winter (AD 1135 to 1154), under the command of William of Ypres, who was King Stephen&#x27;s chief lieutenant from 1139 to 1154 and who was made Earl of Kent by Stephen.

In Italy, the was a military chief offering his troops, the , to Italian city-states. The were extensively used by the Italian city-states in their wars against one another. At times, the seized control of the state, as one , Francesco Sforza, made himself the Duke of Milan in 1450. During the ages of the Taifa kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula, Christian knights like El Cid could fight for a Muslim ruler against his Christian or Muslim enemies. The Almogavars originally fought for the counts of Barcelona and kings of Aragon, but as the Catalan Company, they followed Roger de Flor in the service of the Byzantine Empire. In 1311, the Catalan Great Company defeated at the Battle of Halmyros their former employer, Walter V, Count of Brienne, after he refused to pay them, and took over the Duchy of Athens. The Great Company ruled much of central and southern Greece until 1388–1390 when a rival mercenary company, the Navarrese Company were hired to oust them. Catalan and German mercenaries also had prominent role in the Serbian victory over Bulgarians in the Battle of Velbuzd in 1330.

During the later Middle Ages, Free Companies (or &quot;Free Lances&quot;) were formed, consisting of companies of mercenary troops. Nation-states lacked the funds needed to maintain standing forces, so they tended to hire free companies to serve in their armies during wartime. Such companies typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict, when men-at-arms were no longer needed by their respective governments. The veteran soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment, often becoming mercenaries. Free Companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia.

The formed a distinctive subculture in medieval France who alternated between serving as mercenaries in wartime and bandits in peacetime. The were very destructive and became a significant social problem. After the Treaty of Brétigny ended the war between England and France in 1360, the French countryside was overrun by Free Companies of while the French Crown lacked the necessary military and economic strength to put an end to their activities. To rid France of the rampaging mercenaries and to overthrow the pro-English King Pedro the Cruel of Castile, Marshal Bertrand du Guesclin was directed by King Charles V of France to take the Free Companies into Castile with the orders to put the pro-French Enrique de Trastámara on the Castilian throne. Guesclin&#x27;s mercanaries were organized into the Big Companies and French Companies and placed a decisive role in putting Enrique on the Castilian throne in 1369, who styled himself King Enrique II, the first Castilian monarch of the House of Trastámara.

The White Company commanded by Sir John Hawkwood is the best known English Free Company of the 14th century. Between the 13th and 17th centuries the Gallowglass fought within the Islands of Britain and also mainland Europe. A Welshman Owain Lawgoch (Owain of the Red Hand) formed a free company and fought for the French against the English during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, before being assassinated by a Scot named Jon Lamb, under the orders of the English Crown, during the siege of Mortagne in 1378.

====15th and 16th centuries====

Swiss mercenaries were sought during the late 15th and early 16th centuries as being an effective fighting force, until their somewhat rigid battle formations became vulnerable to arquebuses and artillery being developed at the same time. The Swiss Guard in particular were employed by the Papal States from 1506 (continuing to serve today as the military of Vatican City).

It was then that the German landsknechts, colourful mercenaries with a redoubtable reputation, took over the Swiss forces&#x27; legacy and became the most formidable force of the late 15th and throughout the 16th century, being hired by all the powers in Europe and often fighting at opposite sides. Sir Thomas More in his Utopia advocated the use of mercenaries in preference to citizens. The barbarian mercenaries employed by the Utopians are thought to be inspired by the Swiss mercenaries.

At approximately the same period, Niccolò Machiavelli argued against the use of mercenary armies in his book of political advice &quot;The Prince&quot;. His rationale was that since the sole motivation of mercenaries is their pay, they will not be inclined to take the kind of risks that can turn the tide of a battle, but may cost them their lives. He also noted that a mercenary who failed was obviously no good, but one who succeeded may be even more dangerous. He astutely pointed out that a successful mercenary army no longer needs its employer if it is more militarily powerful than its supposed superior. This explained the frequent, violent betrayals that characterized mercenary/client relations in Italy, because neither side trusted the other. He believed that citizens with a real attachment to their home country will be more motivated to defend it and thus make much better soldiers.

The Stratioti or Stradioti (Italian: Stradioti or Stradiotti; Greek: Στρατιώτες, Stratiotes) were mercenary units from the Balkans recruited mainly by states of southern and central Europe from the 15th until the middle of the 18th century. The stradioti were recruited in Albania, Greece, Dalmatia, Serbia and later Cyprus. Most modern historians have indicated that the Stratioti were mostly Albanians. According to a study by a Greek author, around 80% of the listed names attributed to the stradioti were of Albanian origin while most of the remaining ones, especially those of officers, were of Greek origin; a small minority were of South Slavic origin. Among their leaders there were also members of some old Byzantine Greek noble families such as the Palaiologoi and Comneni. The stratioti were pioneers of light cavalry tactics during this era. In the early 16th century heavy cavalry in the European armies was principally remodeled after Albanian stradioti of the Venetian army, Hungarian hussars and German mercenary cavalry units (Schwarzreitern). They employed hit-and-run tactics, ambushes, feigned retreats and other complex maneuvers. In some ways, these tactics echoed those of the Ottoman sipahis and akinci. They had some notable successes also against French heavy cavalry during the Italian Wars. They were known for cutting off the heads of dead or captured enemies, and according to Commines they were paid by their leaders one ducat per head.

In Italy, during inter-family conflicts such as the Wars of Castro, mercenaries were widely used to supplement the much smaller forces loyal to particular families. Often these were further supplemented by troops loyal to particular &quot;duchies&quot; which had sided with one or more of the belligerents.

====17th and 18th centuries====
During the 17th and 18th centuries, extensive use was made of foreign recruits in the now regimented and highly drilled armies of Europe, beginning in a systematized way with the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Historian Geoffrey Parker notes that 40,000 Scotsmen (about fifteen percent of the adult male population) served as soldiers in Continental Europe from 1618 to 1640.
After the signing of the Treaty of Limerick (1691) the soldiers of the Irish Army who left Ireland for France took part in what is known as the &quot;Flight of the Wild Geese&quot;. Subsequently, many made a living from fighting in continental armies, the most famous of whom was Patrick Sarsfield, who, having fallen mortally wounded at the Battle of Landen fighting for the French, said &quot;If this was only for Ireland&quot;.

The brutality of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, in which several parts of Germany were ransacked by the mercenary troops, and left almost unpopulated, led to the formation of standing armies of professional soldiers, recruited locally or abroad. These armies were active also in peacetime. The formation of these armies in the late 18th century led to professionalization and standardization of clothing (uniforms), equipment, drill, weapons, etc. Since smaller states like the Dutch Republic could afford a large standing army, but could not find enough recruits among its own citizens, recruiting foreigners was common. Prussia had developed a form of conscription, but relied in wartime also on foreign recruits, although the regulations stated that no more than one third of the recruits were to be foreign. Prussian recruiting methods were often aggressive, and resulted more than once in conflicts with neighbouring states. The term mercenary gained its notoriety during this development, since mercenaries were—and now are—often seen as soldiers who fight for no noble cause, but only for money, and who have no loyalty than to the highest bidder, as opposed to the professional soldiers who takes an oath of loyalty and who is seen as the defender of the nation.

The mercenary soldiers thus fell out of favour and was replaced by the professional soldier. To augment the army, major European powers like France, Britain, the Dutch Republic and Spain contracted regiments from Switzerland, the Southern Netherlands (modern day Belgium), and several smaller German states. About a third of the infantry regiments of the French Royal Army prior to the French Revolution were recruited from outside France. The largest single group were the twelve Swiss regiments (including the Swiss Guard). Other units were German and one Irish Brigade (the &quot;Wild Geese&quot;) had originally been made up of Irish volunteers. By 1789 difficulties in obtaining genuinely Irish recruits had led to German and other foreigners making up the bulk of the rank and file. The officers however continued to be drawn from long established Franco-Irish families. During the reign of Louis XV there was also a Scottish (), a Swedish (), an Italian (Royal-Italien) and a Walloon (Horion-Liegeois) regiment recruited outside the borders of France. The foreign infantry regiments comprised about 20,000 men in 1733, rising to 48,000 at the time of the Seven Years&#x27; War and being reduced in numbers thereafter.

The Dutch Republic had contracted several Scots, Swiss and German regiments in the early 18th century, and kept three Scots, one Walloon, and six Swiss regiments (including a Guard regiment raised in 1749) throughout the 18th century. The Scots regiments were contracted from Great Britain, but as relations between Britain and the Republic deteriorated, the regiments could no longer recruit in Scotland, leading to the regiments being Scots in name only until they were nationalized in 1784. Patrick Gordon, a Scottish mercenary fought at various times for Poland and Sweden, constantly changing his loyalty based on who could pay him the best, until he took up Russian service in 1661. In August 1689, during a coup d&#x27;état attempt in Moscow against co-tsar Peter the Great led by the Sophia Alekseyevna in the name of the other co-tsar, the intellectually disabled Ivan V, Gordon played the decisive role in defeating the coup and ensuring Peter&#x27;s triumph. Gordon remained one of Peter&#x27;s favorite advisers until his death.

The Spanish Army also made use of permanently established foreign regiments. These were three Irish regiments (Irlanda, Hiberni and Ultonia); one Italian (Naples) and five Swiss (Wimpssen, Reding, Betschart, Traxer and Preux). In addition one regiment of the Royal Guard including Irishmen as &quot;Patten&quot;, &quot;McDonnell&quot; and &quot;Neiven&quot;, was recruited from Walloons. The last of these foreign regiments was disbanded in 1815, following recruiting difficulties during the Napoleonic Wars. One complication arising from the use of non-national troops occurred at the Battle of Bailén in 1808 when the &quot;red Swiss&quot; (so-called from their uniforms) of the invading French Army clashed bloodily with &quot;blue Swiss&quot; in the Spanish service.

During the American Revolutionary War, the British government hired several regiments from German principalities to supplement the Army. They became known to revolutionaries as Hessians and were portrayed by propagandists as mercenaries. However, they were auxiliaries and do not meet the definition of mercenary.

====19th–21st centuries====
During the South American wars of independence from Spain, the British Legions from 1817 onward fought for General Simón Bolívar. Some of the British Legionaries were liberal idealists who went to South America to fight in a war for freedom, but others were the more classic mercenaries, mostly unemployed veterans of the Napoleonic wars, who fought for money. In South America, especially in Colombia, the men of the British Legions are remembered as heroes for their crucial role in helping end Spanish rule. During the First Carlist War, the British government suspended the Foreign Enlistment Act to allow the recruitment of a quasi-official British Auxiliary Legion under George de Lacy Evans, which went to Spain to fight for Queen Isabel II against the followers of Don Carlos, the pretender to the Spanish throne.

The Atholl Highlanders, a private Scottish infantry regiment of the Duke of Atholl, was formed in 1839 purely for ceremonial purposes. It was granted official regimental status by Queen Victoria in 1845 and is the only remaining legal private army in Europe.

Turkey and Azerbaijan deployed Syrian mercenaries during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war.

Syrian mercenaries are being deployed by Russia, with expected numbers ranging from hundreds to up to 40,000 fighters ultimately expected to take part. Wagner mercenaries are active in the Syrian civil war and sledgehammered a Syrian man to death. On the Ukrainian side, the Mozart Group was active in Ukraine.

===East Asia===

====Warring States====
Mercenaries were regularly used by the kingdoms of the Warring States period of China. Military advisers and generals trained through the works of Mozi and Sun Tzu would regularly offer their services to kings and dukes.

After the Qin conquest of the Warring States, the Qin and later Han Empires would also employ mercenaries – ranging from nomadic horse archers in the Northern steppes or soldiers from the Yue kingdoms of the South. The 7th-century Tang dynasty was also prominent for its use of mercenaries, when they hired Tibetan and Uyghur soldiers against invasion from the Göktürks and other steppe civilizations.

====15th to 18th centuries====
The Saika mercenary group of the Kii Province, Japan, played a significant role during the Siege of Ishiyama Hongan-ji that took place between August 1570 to August 1580. The Saikashuu were famed for the support of Ikkō Buddhist sect movements and greatly impeded the advance of Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s forces.

Ninja were peasant farmers who learned the art of war to combat the &quot;daimyō&quot;″s samurai. They were hired out by many as mercenaries to perform capture, infiltration and retrieval, and, most famously, assassinations. Ninja possibly originated around the 14th century, but were not widely known or used till the 15th century and carried on being hired till the mid 18th century. In the 16th-17th centuries, the Spanish in the Philippines employed samurai mercenaries from Japan to help control the archipelago. Abroad the wreck of one Spanish galleon, the &quot;San Diego&quot;, that sunk in Filipino waters on 14 December 1600 were found numerous &quot;tsubas&quot;, the handguards of the &quot;katanas&quot;, the distinctive swords used by the samurai.

In 1615, the Dutch invaded Ai Island with Japanese mercenaries.

====19th century====
Between 1850 and 1864, the Taiping Rebellion raged as the Taiping (Heavenly Peace) Army led by Hong Xiuquan, the self-proclaimed younger brother of Jesus Christ, engaged in a bloody civil war against the forces loyal to the Qing emperor. As Hong and his followers, who numbered in the millions, were hostile to Western business interests, a group of Western merchants based in Shanghai created a mercenary army known as the Ever Victorious Army. During the Taiping Rebellion, the Qing came close to losing control of China. It was common for the financially hard-pressed Qing emperors to subcontract out the business of raising armies to fight the Taiping to the loyalist provincial gentry, which formed the origins of the warlords who were to dominate China after the overthrow of the Qing in 1912.

The rank and file of the Ever-Victorious Army were Chinese, but the senior officers were Westerners. The first commander was an American adventurer, Colonel Frederick Townsend Ward. After Ward was killed in action in 1862, command was assumed by another American adventurer, Henry Andres Burgevine, but the Chinese disliked him on the account of his racism and his alcoholism. Burgevine was replaced with a British Army officer seconded to Chinese service, Colonel Charles &quot;Chinese&quot; Gordon.

A highly successful commander, Gordon won thirty-three battles in succession against the Taipings in 1863–1864 as he led the Ever Victorious Army down the Yangtze river valley and played a decisive role in defeating the Taipings. Through technically not a mercenary as Gordon had been assigned by the British government to lead the Ever Victorious Army, the &quot;Times&quot; of London in a leader (editorial) in August 1864 declared: &quot;the part of the soldier of fortune is in these days very difficult to play with honour...but if ever the actions of a soldier fighting in foreign service ought to be viewed with indulgence, and even with admiration, this exceptional tribute is due to Colonel Gordon&quot;.

During the French conquest of Vietnam, their most persistent and stubborn opponents were not the Vietnamese, but rather the Chinese mercenaries of the Black Flag Army commanded by Liu Yongfu, who been hired by the Emperor Tự Đức. In 1873, the Black Flags killed the French commander, Francis Garnier, attracting much attention in France. In 1883, Captain Henri Rivière, leading another French expedition into Vietnam was also killed by the Black Flags. When the French conquest of Vietnam was finally completed in 1885, one of the peace terms were the disbandment of the Black Flag Army. Chinese flag rebels also fought in the Haw wars in Laos and northern Thailand.

Philo McGiffin served as a naval mercenary in the Sino-French War and First Sino-Japanese War.

====20th century====
In the Warlord Era of China, some British mercenaries like Morris &quot;Two Gun&quot; Cohen, and Francis Arthur &quot;One Armed&quot; Sutton found employ in China.

Easily the largest group of mercenaries in China were the Russian emigres who arrived after 1917 and who hired themselves out to various Chinese warlords in the 1920s. Unlike the Anglo-American mercenaries, the Russians had no home to return to nor were any foreign nations willing to accept them as refugees, causing them to have a grim, fatalistic outlook as they were trapped in what they regarded as a strange land that was as far from home as imaginable. One group of Russians wore Tartar hats and the traditional dark greycoats, and fought for Marshal Zhang Zuolin, the &quot;Old Marshal&quot; who ruled Manchuria. White Russian mercenaries claimed that they had considerable effectiveness against ill-trained armies of the Chinese warlords; one White Russian claimed that when he and other Russians serving Marshal Zhang they &quot;went through the Chinese troops like a knife through butter&quot;.

Chinese forces slaughtered most of a 350 strong White Russian forces in June 1921 under Colonel Kazagrandi in the Gobi desert, with only two batches of 42 men and 35 men surrendering separately as Chinese were wiping out White Russian remnants following the Soviet Red army defeat of Ungern Sternberg, and other Buryat and White Russian remnants of Ungern-Sternberg&#x27;s army were massacred by Soviet Red Army and Mongol forces.

One group of Russian mercenaries led by General Konstantin Petrovich Nechaev were dressed in the uniform of the Imperial Russian Army and fought for General Zhang Zongchang, the &quot;Dogmeat General&quot; who ruled Shangdong province. Zhang Zongchang had Russian women as concubines. Nechaev and his men were infamous for their ruthlessness, and on one occasion in 1926, rode three armored trains through the Chinese countryside, killing everybody they met. When the Chinese peasants tore up the rails to stop Nechaev&#x27;s rampage, he and his men vented their fury by sacking in an especially brutal manner the nearest town. Nechaev suffered a huge defeat at the hands of Chinese, when he and one armoured train under his command were trapped near Suichzhou in 1925. Their Chinese adversaries had pulled up the rail, and took this opportunity to massacre almost all Russian mercenaries on board the train. Nechaev managed to survive this incident, but lost a part of his leg during the bitter fighting. In 1926 Chinese warlord Sun Chuanfang inflicted bloody death tolls upon the White Russian mercenaries under Nechaev&#x27;s brigade in the 65th division serving Zhang Zongchang, reducing the Russian numbers from 3,000 to only a few hundred by 1927 and the remaining Russian survivors fought in armored trains. During the Northern Expedition Chinese Nationalist forces captured an armoured train of Russian mercenaries serving Zhang Zongchang and brutalized the Russian prisoners by piercing their noses with rope and marching them in public through the streets in Shandong in 1928, described as &quot;stout rope pierced through their noses&quot;.

Alcoholic White Russian mercenaries defeated Muslim Uyghurs in melee fighting when Uyghurs tried to take Urumqi on 21 February 1933 in the Battle of Ürümqi (1933). Wu Aitchen mentioned that 600 Uyghurs were slaughtered in a battle by White Russian mercenaries in the service of the Xinjiang clique warlord Jin Shuren. Jin Shuren would take Russian women as hostages to force their husbands to serve as his mercenaries.

Hui Muslims fought brutal battles against White Russians and Soviet Red Army Russians at the Battle of Tutung and Battle of Dawan Cheng inflicting heavy losses on the Russian forces.

Chinese forces killed many White Russian soldiers and Soviet soldiers in 1944-1946 when the White Russians of Ili and Soviet Red Army served in the Second East Turkestan Republic&#x27;s military during the Ili Rebellion.

During the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War, a number of foreign pilots served in the Chinese Air Force, most famously in the 14th Squadron, a light bombardment unit often called the International Squadron, which was briefly active in February and March 1938.

===India===

====18th to 19th centuries====
In the medieval period, Purbiya mercenaries from Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh were a common feature in kingdoms in western and northern India. They were also later recruited by the Marathas and the British. In southern India, there is a caste/community of mercenaries in the state of Karnataka which is called Bunt. The word &quot;bunt&quot; itself translates to warrior or mercenary, this community later elevated itself as the rulers of the land, several powerful dynasties emerged from this community. The most notable dynasty being the Alupas of Dakshina Kannada, which reigned for 1,300 years. This community still survives and has adopted the surnames shetty, Rai, Alva, chowta etc. In Tamil Nadu, the three crowned empires used the Kongar pastro-peasantry tribes of the Kongunad region and the Kongar peasant tribes of the Erumainad region as their swordsman mercenaries, cavalry mercenaries, and as chariot soldier mercenaries, as well as personal guards. Kongars worked along with the three empires&#x27; warrior tribes such as the Kallar, Maravar, Aghamudaiyar, Parkavar, Valaiya-Mutharaiyar, and Mazhavar tribes. During that time, these Kongar tribes were led only by the chiefs of their own tribe and would not come under the command of the emperor or his military general. Though these Kongar tribes of Kongunad were feudatories to the three crowned empires, Kongunad was divided into 24 subdivisions and was only ruled by Kongars. However, the Kongars (Gangars) of Erumainad established their own empire, the Western Ganga dynasty, and ruled over it for centuries. Kongar tribes still exist in the modern world, where they are referred as Kongu Vellala Gounder (Kongunadu) and Gangadhikar Vokkaliga Gowda (Erumainad).

The Mukkuvar clan of Malabar Coast and Sri Lankan coast did the role of soldiers in Kalinga Magha&#x27;s invasion to Sri Lanka and in Nair&#x27;s battle with the Dutch in the Battle of Colachel.

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the imperial Mughal power was crumbling and other powers, including the Sikh Misls and Maratha chiefs, were emerging. At this time, a number of mercenaries, arriving from several countries found employment in India. Some of the mercenaries emerged to become independent rulers. The Sikh Maharaja, Ranjit Singh, known as the &quot;Lion of the Punjab&quot;, employed Euro-American mercenaries such as the Neapolitan Paolo Avitabile; the Frenchmen Claude Auguste Court and Jean-François Allard; and the Americans Josiah Harlan and Alexander Gardner. The Sikh army, &quot;Dal Khalsa&quot;, was trained by Singh&#x27;s French mercenaries to fight alone the lines used by the French in the Napoleonic era, and following French practice, &quot;Dal Khalsa&quot; had excellent artillery. Singh had a low opinion of his Euro-American mercenaries, once saying &quot;German, French or English, all these European bastards are alike&quot;.

Until 1858, India was a proprietary colony that belonged to the East India Company, not the British Crown. The East India Company became the world&#x27;s most influential corporation, having exclusive monopolies on trade with India and China. By the early 19th century, the East India Company in its proprietary colony of India ruled over 90 million Indians and controlled of land under its own flag, issued its own currency and maintained its own civil service and its own army of 200,000 men led by officers trained at its officer school, giving the company an army larger than that possessed by most European states. In the 17th century, the East India Company recruited Indian mercenaries to guard its warehouses and police the cities under its rule. However, these forces were ad hoc and disbanded as quickly as they were recruited.

Starting in 1746, the Company recruited Indian mercenaries into its own army. By 1765, the board of directors of the Company had come to accept it was necessary to rule its conquests to maintain a standing army, voting to maintain three presidency armies to be funded by taxes on Indian land. The number of Indians working for the Company&#x27;s armies outnumbered the Europeans ten to one. When recruiting, the East India Company tended to follow Indian prejudices in believing the pale-skinned men from northern India made for better soldiers than the dark-skinned peoples of southern India, and that high-caste Hindus were superior to the low-caste Hindus. Despite these prejudices, the men of the Madras Army were from south India. The Bengal Army were largely high-cast Hindus from northern India while the Bombay Army prided itself on being a &quot;melting pot&quot;.

Because the East India Company ultimately by the end of the 18th century came to offer higher pay than the Maharajahs did, and offered the novelty in India of paying a pension to veterans and their families, it came to attract the best of the Indian mercenaries. Initially, the mercenaries serving in the company&#x27;s armies brought along their own weapons, which was the normal practice in India, but after the 1760s the company began to them arm with the standard British weapons. The East India Company, generally known in both Britain and in India as &quot;the Company&quot;, had sufficient lobbying power in London to ensure that several British Army regiments were also stationed to work alongside the Company army, whose troops were mostly &quot;Sepoys&quot; (Indians). The Company never entirely trusted the loyalty of its sepoys. The company had its own officer training school at the Addiscombe Military Seminary. The company&#x27;s armies were trained in the Western style and by the end of the 18th century its troops were ranked as the equal of any European army.

===Latin America===

====Nicaragua====
In 1855, during a civil war in Nicaragua between the Conservatives and Liberals, the latter recruited an American adventurer named William Walker who promised to bring 300 mercenaries to fight for the Liberals. Through Walker only brought 60 mercenaries with him, to be joined by another 100 Americans together with the Belgian mercenary Charles Frederick Henningsen who were already in Nicaragua, he was able to defeat the Conservatives at the Battle of La Virgen on 4 September 1855 and by 13 October, Walker had taken Grenada, the Conservative capital. After his victories, Walker became the &quot;de facto&quot; dictator of Nicaragua, which many both inside and outside of the country soon started to call &quot;Walkeragua&quot;.

At the time, Nicaragua was an extremely important transit point between the Western and Eastern United States. In the days before the Panama Canal and the first transcontinental railroad, ships from the Eastern United States would sail up the San Juan River to Lake Nicaragua, where passengers and goods were unloaded at the port of Rivas and then made the short journey via stagecoach to the Pacific coast, to be loaded onto ships that would take them to the west coast of the United States. One of the most important companies of the Nicaraguan stagecoach business was the Accessory Transit Company owned by Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt of New York. Walker confiscated the Accessory Transit Company&#x27;s assets in Nicaragua, which he handed over to the Morgan &amp; Garrison company, owned by rivals of Vanderbilt. As Vanderbilt happened to be the richest man in the United States, he launched a lobbying campaign against Walker in Washington, D.C., and was able to pressure President Franklin Pierce into withdrawing American recognition of Walker&#x27;s regime.

Once it was understood that the US government was no longer supporting Walker, Costa Rica invaded Nicaragua with the aim of deposing Walker, whose ambitions were felt to be a threat to all of Central America. The Costa Ricans defeated Walker at the Battle of Santa Rosa and the Second Battle of Rivas. The beleaguered Walker sought to appeal to support in his native South by restoring slavery in Nicaragua, making English the official language, changing the immigration law to favor Americans, and declaring his ultimate intention was to bring Nicaragua into the United States as a slave state. By this point, Walker had thoroughly alienated public opinion in Nicaragua while he was besieged in Grenada by a coalition of Guatemalan, Salvadorian, and Costa Rican troops. The decision by Henningsen to burn down Grenada enraged Nicaraguan people and in March 1857, Walker, with his dreams of an empire in tatters, fled Nicaragua.

In the 1980s, one of the Reagan administration&#x27;s foreign policy was to overthrow the left-wing Sandinista government by arming guerrillas known as the Contras. Between 1982 and 1984, Congress passed the three Boland amendments which limited the extent of American aid to the Contra rebels. By the late 1970s, the popularity of magazines such as &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;, which glorified the mercenary subculture, led to the opening of numerous camps in the United States designed to train men to be mercenaries and also to serve as guerrillas in case of a Soviet conquest of the United States. The vast majority of the men who trained in these camps were white men who saw para-military training as a &quot;reverse the previous twenty years of American history and take back all the symbolic territory that has been lost&quot; as the possibility of becoming mercenaries gave them &quot;the fantastic possibility of escaping their present lives, being reborn as warrior and remaking the world&quot;.

Owing to the legal problems posed by the Boland amendments, the Reagan administration turned to the self-proclaimed mercenaries to arm and train the Contra guerrillas. In 1984, the CIA created the Civilian Military Assistance (CMA) group to aid the Contras. The CMA were led by a white supremacist from Alabama named Tom Posey, who like all of the other members of the CMA were graduates of the mercenary training camps. John Negroponte, the American ambassador to Honduras, arranged for permission to be given for the CMA to operate from Honduran territory. However, the operation collapsed later in 1984 when the Nicaraguans shot down a CMA plane carrying arms to the Contras, killing two Americans. Sam Hall, a self proclaimed mercenary hero and &quot;counter-terrorist&quot; who joined the CMA entered Nicaragua with the aim of performing sabotage operations. In 1986, Hall was captured by the Sandinistas, who held him for four months before releasing him under the grounds that he was not a mercenary, but rather a mercenary imposer. John K. Singlaub who worked alongside Hall described him as suffering from a &quot;Walter Mitty type complex&quot;.

====Colombia====
In 1994, President César Gaviria of Colombia signed Decree 356, which allowed wealthy landowners to recruit private armies of their own and liberalised the law on settling up PMCs in order to fight the Communist FARC (&quot;Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia&quot; – Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) guerrillas. As a result of Decree 356, by 2014 Colombia had 740 PMCs operating, more than anywhere else in the world. Increasingly Colombian mercenaries have been hired by American PMCs as being cheaper than American mercenaries. The government of the United Arab Emirates has hired Colombian mercenaries to fight its war in Yemen.

===Africa===

====Ancient Africa====
An early recorded use of foreign auxiliaries dates back to ancient Egypt, the thirteenth century BC, when Pharaoh Ramesses II used 11,000 mercenaries during his battles. A long established foreign corps in the Egyptian forces were the Medjay—a generic term given to tribal scouts and light infantry recruited from Nubia serving from the late period of the Old Kingdom through that of the New Kingdom. Other warriors recruited from outside the borders of Egypt included Libyan, Syrian and Canaanite contingents under the New Kingdom and Sherdens from Sardinia who appear in their distinctive horned helmets on wall paintings as body guards for Ramesses II. Celtic mercenaries were greatly employed in the Greek world (leading to the sack of Delphi and the Celtic settlement of Galatia). The Greek rulers of Ptolemaic Egypt, too, used Celtic mercenaries. Carthage was unique for relying primarily on mercenaries to fight its wars, particularly Gaul and Spanish mercenaries.

====19th and 20th centuries====

In the 20th century, mercenaries in conflicts on the continent of Africa have in several cases brought about a swift end to bloody civil war by comprehensively defeating the rebel forces. There have been a number of unsavory incidents in the brushfire wars of Africa, some involving recruitment of European and American men &quot;looking for adventure&quot;. 

Many of the adventurers in Africa who have been described as mercenaries were in fact ideologically motivated to support particular governments, and would not fight &quot;for the highest bidder&quot;. An example of this was the British South Africa Police (BSAP), a paramilitary, mounted infantry force formed by the British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes in 1889–1890 that evolved and continued until 1980.

Famous mercenaries in Africa include:
* Frederick Russell Burnham was an American scout for the British South Africa Company who served in both the First Matabele War (1893–94) and the Second Matabele War (1896–97). He effectively ended the Second Matabele War by assassinating the Ndebele religious leader, Mlimo, but Burnham is best known in this war for teaching American Frontier scouting to Robert Baden-Powell and inspiring him to found the boy scouts. In the Second Boer War (1900–1904), Burnham served as Chief of Scouts to the British Army. He was presented the Cross of the Distinguished Service Order for his heroism and given a commission as Major in the British Army by King Edward VII personally even though he declined to renounce his American citizenship. Burnham&#x27;s real-life adventures also heavily influenced H. Rider Haggard who created the fictional Allan Quatermain adventurer, a character who later was transformed by George Lucas into Indiana Jones.
* Mike Hoare was a British career soldier who served with distinction in the London Irish Rifles during World War II. He later emigrated to South Africa, and was contracted by the State of Katanga in the early 1960s to form &quot;4 Commando (Force Katangaise)&quot;, a unit of foreign military advisers in the local gendarmerie. Most of Hoare&#x27;s recruits were Belgians or South Africans. After Katanga&#x27;s integration in 1963, Hoare remained active in Congo affairs. He was solicited by General Joseph-Desiré Mobutu in 1964 to form &quot;5 Commando&quot; – a second mercenary force raised to crush the Simba Rebellion, which included European adventurers of at least twenty nationalities. Hoare later resurfaced in 1981, shortly after France-Albert René&#x27;s ascension in the Seychelles, attempting to carry out a coup d&#x27;état on behalf of former president James Mancham. His troops were intercepted shortly after debarking on Mahé and only escaped by hijacking an Air India Boeing, which they flew to Durban.
* Bob Denard was a former French intelligence operative, policeman, and dedicated anti-communist who saw action during the First Indochina War and Algerian War of Independence. After a brief inroad into civilian life, Denard returned to military service with the Katangese gendarmerie in 1961. Refusing to surrender when secessionist forces collapsed in January 1963, he disappeared into Angola with a nucleus of other die-hards and sought work training North Yemen royalists before returning to the Congo at the request of then-Prime Minister Moise Tshombe. Denard formed his own unit to fight the Simba Rebellion, &quot;les affreux&quot;, who were also instrumental in suppressing an attempted coup d&#x27;état in 1966. Dismissed by Congolese president Joseph Kasa Vubu, the French mercenary joined the Kisangani Mutinies and was wounded in action. He later went on to serve as a military adviser to several African governments, including Gabon and Rhodesia. Denard has since carried out five attempted coup d&#x27;etats in Benin and the Comoros Islands, three of them successful.
* Neall Ellis was a South African aviator who achieved prominence for his extensive action in Sierra Leone&#x27;s long-running civil war. Ellis was raised in Bulawayo, Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), but after an unsuccessful career in the Rhodesian Army, emigrated to join the South African Air Force. During the South African Border War, he flew improvised Aérospatiale Alouette III and Atlas Oryx gunships over Angola and Mozambique in support of South African expeditionary forces conducting external raids. He retired a colonel upon the end of apartheid, piloting Yugoslav Mil Mi-8s as an operational freelancer. In 1998, Ellis returned to participate in the Angolan Civil War with private military firm Executive Outcomes, which eventually dispatched him to Sierra Leone. During the Battle for Freetown, he was instrumental in fighting off Revolutionary United Front insurgents from a Mil Mi-24 Hind and providing air support for British forces executing Operation Barras. He has founded his own paramilitary company, &quot;Jesa Air West Africa&quot;, and continues to fly helicopters for Iraq and Somalia.
* Simon Mann was found guilty in Zimbabwe of &quot;attempting to buy weapons&quot; &quot;(BBC 27 August)&quot; allegedly for a coup in Equatorial Guinea in 2004 (see below).

=====Congo Crisis=====
The Congo Crisis (1960–1965) was a period of turmoil in the First Republic of the Congo that began with national independence from Belgium and ended with the seizing of power by Joseph Mobutu. During the crisis, mercenaries were employed by various factions, and also at times helped the United Nations and other peace keepers.

In 1960 and 1961, Mike Hoare worked as a mercenary commanding an English-speaking unit called &quot;4 Commando&quot; supporting a faction in Katanga, a province trying to break away from the newly independent Congo under the leadership of Moïse Tshombe. Hoare chronicled his exploits in his book the &quot;Road to Kalamata&quot;.

In 1964, Tshombe (then Prime Minister of Congo) hired Major Hoare to lead a military unit called &quot;5 Commando&quot; made up of about 300 men, most of whom were from South Africa. The unit&#x27;s mission was to fight a rebel group called Simbas, who already had captured almost two-thirds of the country.

In Operation Dragon Rouge, &quot;5 Commando&quot; worked in close cooperation with Belgian paratroopers, Cuban exile pilots, and CIA hired mercenaries. The objective of Operation Dragon Rouge was to capture Stanleyville and save several hundred civilians (mostly Europeans and missionaries) who were hostages of the Simba rebels. The operation saved many lives; however, the Operation damaged the reputation of Moïse Tshombe as it saw the return of white mercenaries to the Congo soon after independence and was a factor in Tshombe&#x27;s loss of support from president of Congo Joseph Kasa-Vubu who dismissed him from his position

At the same time Bob Denard commanded the French-speaking &quot;6 Commando&quot;, &quot;Black Jack&quot; Schramme commanded &quot;10 Commando&quot; and William &quot;Rip&quot; Robertson commanded a company of anti-Castro Cuban exiles.

Later, in 1966 and 1967, some former Tshombe mercenaries and Katangese gendarmes staged the Mercenaries&#x27; Mutinies.

=====Biafra=====
Mercenaries fought for Biafra in the Fourth Commando Brigade led by Rolf Steiner during the Nigerian Civil War (1967–1970). Other mercenaries flew aircraft for the Biafrans. In October 1967, for example, a Royal Air Burundi DC-4M Argonaut, flown by mercenary Heinrich Wartski, also known as Henry Wharton, crash-landed in Cameroon with military supplies destined for Biafra.

It was hoped that employing mercenaries in Nigeria would have similar impact to the Congo, but the mercenaries proved largely ineffective. The British historian Philip Baxter wrote the principle difference was that the Congolese militias commanded by leaders with almost no military experience were no match for the mercenaries, and by contrast the Sandhurst-trained Nigerian Army officers were of an &quot;altogether higher caliber&quot; than Congolese militia leaders. Through much of the leadership of the Nigerian Army had been killed in two coups in 1966, there were still just enough Sandhust graduates left in 1967 to hold the Nigerian Army together and provide enough of a modicum of military professionalism to defeat the mercenaries. By October 1967, most of the mercenaries who had been expecting easy victories like those won in the Congo had already left Biafra, complaining that the Nigerians were a much tougher opponent who were defeating them in battle.

When asked about the impact of the white mercenaries, General Philip Effiong, the chief of the Biafran general staff replied: &quot;They had not helped. It would have made no difference if not a single one of them came to work for the secessionist forces. Rolf Steiner stayed the longest. He was more of a bad influence than anything else. We were happy to get rid of him.&quot; One Biafran officer, Fola Oyewole, wrote about the sacking of Steiner in late 1968: &quot;Steiner&#x27;s departure from Biafra removed the shine from the white mercenaries, the myth of the white man&#x27;s superiority in the art of soldering&quot;. Oyewole wrote that the white mercenaries were hated by the ordinary people of Biafra due to their high-handed behavior; a tendency to retreat when it appeared possible the Nigerians were about to cut them off instead of holding their ground; and a fondness for looting, noting that the European mercenaries seemed more interested in stealing as much as possible instead of helping Biafra.&quot;

In May 1969, Count Carl Gustaf von Rosen formed a squadron of five light aircraft known as the &quot;Babies of Biafra&quot;, which attacked and destroyed Nigerian jet aircraft on the ground and delivered food aid. Count von Rosen was assisted by ex-RCAF fighter pilot Lynn Garrison.

=====Angola=====
In 1975, John Banks, an Englishman, recruited mercenaries to fight for the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) against the &quot;Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola&quot; (MPLA) in the civil war that broke out when Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975. In the United States, David Bufkin, a self-proclaimed mercenary hero started a recruiting campaign in &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; magazine calling for anti-Communist volunteers, especially Vietnam veterans, to fight in Angola as mercenaries, claiming to be funded to the tune of $80,000 by the Central Intelligence Agency. Bufkin was in fact a former U.S. Army soldier &quot;who has gone AWOL several times, has been tried for rape, and been in and out of jail several times&quot;, did not have $80,000, was not supported by the CIA, instead being a con-man who had stolen most of the money paid to him. Bufkin managed to get a dozen or so American mercenaries to Angola, where several of them were killed in action with the rest being captured.

One of the leaders of the mercenaries was Costas Georgiou (the self-styled &quot;Colonel Callan&quot;), who was described by the British journalist Patrick Brogan as a psychopathic killer who personally executed fourteen of his fellow mercenaries for cowardice, and who was extremely brutal to black people. Within 48 hours of his arrival in Angola, Georgiou had already led his men in disarming and massacring a group of FNLA fighters (his supposed allies), who he killed just for the &quot;fun&quot; of it all. At his trial, it was established that Georgiou had personally murdered at least 170 Angolans. Inept as a military leader as he was brutal, Georgiou notably failed as a commander. It was believed in 1975–76 that recruiting white mercenaries to fight in Angola would have a similar impact that the mercenaries had in the Congo in the 1960s, but in Angola the mercenaries failed completely as Brogan described their efforts as a &quot;debacle&quot;. If anything, the white mercenaries with their disdain for blacks, or in the case of Georgiou murderous hatred seemed to have depressed morale on the FNLA side.

Many of the mercenaries in Angola were not former professional soldiers as they claimed to have been, but instead merely fantasists who had invented heroic war records for themselves. The fantasist mercenaries did not know how to use their weapons properly, and often injured themselves and others when they attempted to use weaponry that they did not fully understand, leading to some of them being executed by the psychopathic killer Georgiou who did not tolerate failure. On 27 January 1976, a group of 96 British mercenaries arrived in Angola and within a week about dozen had accidentally maimed themselves by trying to use weapons that they falsely claimed to be proficient with. The MLPA forces were better organized and led, and the dispatch of 35,000 Cuban Army troops in November 1975 decided the war for the MLPA. Cuban accounts of the Angolan war speak of the efforts of the mercenaries in a tone of contempt as Cuban veterans contend that the mercenaries were poor soldiers who they had no trouble defeating.

When captured, John Derek Barker&#x27;s role as a leader of mercenaries in Northern Angola led the judges to send him to face the firing squad following the Luanda Trial. Nine others were imprisoned. Three more were executed: American Daniel Gearhart was sentenced to death for advertising himself as a mercenary in an American newspaper; Andrew McKenzie and Georgiou, who had both served in the British Army, were sentenced to death for murder. Georgiou was shot by firing squad in 1976. Costas&#x27; cousin Charlie Christodoulou was killed in an ambush.

Executive Outcomes employees, Captains Daniele Zanata and Raif St Clair (who was also involved in the 1981 Seychelles coup attempt), fought on behalf of the MPLA against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in the 1990s in violation of the Lusaka Protocol.

=====Comoros=====
A major aim of French foreign policy was and still is to maintain the French sphere of influence in what is called &quot;Françafrique&quot;. In 1975, Ali Soilih took power in the Comoros via a coup, and proved unwilling to accept the French viewpoint that his nation was part of &quot;Françafrique&quot;. Unhappy with Soilih, the French secret service, the &quot;Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage&quot; in 1978 hired the French mercenary Bob Denard to invade the Comoros to overthrow Soilih. Making the Comoros a tempting target for Denard were its small size, consisting of only three islands in the Indian Ocean. Moreover, Soilih had abolished the Comorian Army, replacing the Army with a militia known as the Moissy, made up mostly of teenage boys with only the most rudimentary military training. The Moissy, which was modeled after the Red Guards in China, existed mainly to terrorize Soilih&#x27;s opponents and was commanded by a 15-year-old boy, appointed solely because of his blind devotion to Soilih.

On the night of 13 May 1978, Denard and 42 other mercenaries landed on Grande Comore island, annihilated the poorly trained and badly commanded Moissy, none of whom had any military experience, and by the morning the Comoros was theirs. President Soilih was high on marijuana and naked in his bed together with three nude teenage schoolgirls watching a pornographic film, when Denard kicked in the door to his room to inform him that he was no longer president. Soilih was later taken out and shot with the official excuse being that he was &quot;shot while trying to escape&quot;. The new president of the Comoros, Ahmed Abdallah, was a puppet leader and the real ruler of the Comoros was Colonel Denard, who brought the Comoros back into &quot;Françafrique&quot;.

As a ruler, Denard proved himself to be extremely greedy as he rapaciously plundered the Comorian economy to make himself into a very rich man. Denard served as the commander of the Comorian Presidential Guard and became the largest single landowner in the Comoros, developing the best land by the sea into luxury resorts catering to tourists who wanted to enjoy the tropics. Denard converted to Islam (the prevailing religion in the Comoros), and took advantage of the Islamic rules on polygamy to maintain for himself a harem of Comorian women. Officially, France was committed to the United Nations sanctions against the apartheid government of South Africa, which French and South African businesses circumvented via the Comoros, a form of sanctions-busting that was tolerated by Denard as long as he received his cut of the profits.

Ultimately, Denard&#x27;s antics as the &quot;great white conqueror&quot; of the Comoros and his lavish lifestyle made him into embarrassment for the French government, as there were charges that France was engaged in neo-colonialism in the Comoros. At the same time there were alternatives to Denard in the form of black Comorian politicians who wanted Denard out, but were willing to keep the Comoros in &quot;Françafrique&quot;, which would allow Paris to achieve its aims without the embarrassment of a white European exploiting a country inhabited by black Africans. When Abdallah tried to dismiss Denard as commander of the Presidential Guard, Denard had him assassinated on 26 November 1989. At that point, the French government, which had an alternative leadership in place, intervened by sending paratroopers to remove Denard and the other mercenaries from the Comoros while installing Said Mohamed Djohar as president.

On 28 September 1995, Denard again invaded the Comoros, but this time, Paris was against the invasion, and staged Operation Azalee – dispatching 600 paratroops to the Comoros to usher Denard and his mercenaries out. Denard was charged in France with the murder of President Abdallah, but was acquitted owing to a lack of evidence. In 2006, he was found guilty of conspiracy to overthrow the government of the Comoros in 1995, but by this point Denard was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and he did not serve a day in prison, instead dying in a Paris hospital on 13 October 2007.

=====Seychelles=====
In 1981, &quot;Mad Mike&quot; Hoare was hired by the government of South Africa to lead an invasion of the Seychelles with the aim of deposing the left-wing President France-Albert René, who had roundly criticized apartheid, and replacing him with a more apartheid-friendly leader. Disguised as a drinking club, Ye Ancient Order of Froth-Blowers, and as rugby players, Hoare led a force of 53 men into the airport at Port Larue on 25 November 1981. Hoare&#x27;s men failed to make it past the customs at the airport as an alert customs officer noticed one of the &quot;rugby players&quot; had an AK-47 assault rifle hidden in his luggage. What followed was a shoot-out at the airport between Hoare&#x27;s men and Seychellois customs officers. Realizing the invasion was doomed, Hoare and his men escaped by hijacking an Air India jet which flew them back to South Africa. The fiasco of the Seychelles invasion marked the beginning of the decline of the traditional soldier of fortune, centered around a charismatic figure like Hoare or Denard, and a change over to the corporatized private military company, run by men who shunned the limelight.

=====Eritrea and Ethiopia=====
Both sides hired mercenaries in the Eritrean–Ethiopian War from 1998 to 2000. Russian mercenaries were believed to be flying in the air forces of both sides.

=====Sierra Leone=====
American Robert C. MacKenzie was killed in the Malal Hills in February 1995, while commanding Gurkha Security Guards (GSG) in Sierra Leone. GSG pulled out soon afterwards and was replaced by Executive Outcomes. Both were employed by the Sierra Leone government as military advisers and to train the government soldiers. It has been alleged that the firms provided soldiers who took an active part in the fighting against the Revolutionary United Front (RUF).

In 2000, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s (ABC-TV) international affairs program &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; broadcast a special report &quot;Sierra Leone: Soldiers of Fortune&quot;, focusing on former 32BN and Recce members who operated in Sierra Leone while serving for SANDF. Officers like De Jesus Antonio, TT D Abreu Capt Ndume and Da Costa were the forefront because of their combat and language skills and also the exploits of South African pilot Neall Ellis and his MI-24 Hind gunship. The report also investigated the failures of the UN Peacekeeping Force, and the involvement of mercenaries and private military contractors in providing vital support to UN operations and British military Special Operations in Sierra Leone in 1999–2000.

=====Equatorial Guinea=====
In August 2004 there was a plot, which later became known as the &quot;Wonga Coup&quot;, to overthrow the government of Equatorial Guinea in Malabo. eight South African apartheid-era soldiers, organised by Neves Matias (former Recce major and De Jesus Antonio former Captain in 2sai BN) with (the leader of whom is Nick du Toit) and five local men were held in Black Beach prison on the island. They were accused of being an advanced guard for a coup to place Severo Moto in power. Six Armenian aircrew, also convicted of involvement in the plot, were released in 2004 after receiving a presidential pardon. CNN reported on 25 August, that:
It was planned, allegedly, by Simon Mann, a former SAS officer. On 27 August 2004 he was found guilty in Zimbabwe of purchasing arms, allegedly for use in the plot (he admitted trying to procure dangerous weapons, but said that they were to guard a diamond mine in DR Congo). It is alleged that there is a paper trail from him which implicates Sir Mark Thatcher, Lord Archer and Ely Calil (a Lebanese-British oil trader).

The BBC reported in an article entitled &quot;Q&amp;A: Equatorial Guinea coup plot&quot;:

The BBC reported on 10 September 2004 that in Zimbabwe:
=====Libya=====
Muammar Gaddafi in Libya was alleged to have been using mercenary soldiers during the 2011 Libyan civil war, including Tuaregs from various nations in Africa. Many of them had been part of his Islamic Legion created in 1972. Reports say around 800 had been recruited from Niger, Mali, Algeria, Ghana and Burkina Faso. In addition, small numbers of Eastern European mercenaries have also turned up supporting the Gaddafi regime. Most sources have described these troops as professional Serbian veterans of the Yugoslav conflict, including snipers, pilots and helicopter experts. Certain observers, however, speculate that they may be from Poland or Belarus. The latter has denied the claims outright; the former is investigating them. Although the Serbian government has denied that any of their nationals are currently serving as mercenary soldiers in North Africa, five such men have been captured by anti-Gaddafi rebels in Tripoli and several others have also allegedly fought during the Second Battle of Benghazi. a number of unidentified white South African mercenaries were hired to smuggle Gaddafi and his sons to exile in Niger. Their attempts were thwarted by NATO air activity shortly before the death of Libya&#x27;s ousted strongman. Numerous reports have indicated that the team was still protecting Saif al-Islam Gaddafi shortly before he was apprehended.

Amnesty International has claimed that such allegations against Gaddafi and the Libyan state turned out to either be false or lacking any evidence. Human Rights Watch has indicated that while many foreign migrants were erroneously accused of fighting with Gaddafi, there were also genuine mercenaries from several nations who participated in the conflict.

More recently in 2020 at least several hundred mercenaries from the Russian Wagner Group have been fighting on the side of the warlord, General Khalifa Haftar, whom the government of Russia supports. The Wagner Group mercenaries arrived in Libya in late 2019. The Wagner Group have excelled as snipers, and one result of their arrival was a rapid increase in the number of sniper deaths on the opposing side that holds Tripoli. In response, the government of Turkey hired 2,000 Syrian mercenaries to fight for the opposing faction that it is supporting in the Libyan civil war.

Since 2019, Turkey deployed Syrian mercenaries in the Libya (See: Turkish military intervention in the Second Libyan Civil War). In July 2020 Al Arabiyah reported that Turkey sent Syrian, Tunisian, Egyptian and Sudanese mercenaries into Libya.

A November 2020 report by human rights advocacy group Human Rights Watch claimed that approximately hundreds of Sudanese men were hired by an Emirati security firm Black Shield Security Services as security guards for shopping centres and hotels in the UAE, but were subsequently tricked into fighting in the Libyan Civil War. Reportedly 390 men were recruited from Khartoum, out of which 12 spoke to HRW and told that they were made to live alongside Libyan fighters aligned with UAE-backed General Khalifa Haftar. The recruits were hired to safeguard the oil facilities controlled by the Haftar forces.

===Middle East===

====Egypt====
By 1807, Muhammad Ali the Great, the Albanian tobacco merchant turned &quot;de facto&quot; independent Ottoman &quot;vali&quot; (governor) of Egypt had imported about 400 French mercenaries to train his army. After the end of the Napoleonic wars, Muhammad Ali recruited more mercenaries from all over Europe and the United States to train his army, through French and Italian veterans of the Napoleonic wars were much preferred and formed the largest two groups of mercenaries in Egypt. The most famous of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s mercenaries was the Frenchman Joseph-Anthelme Sève who set up the first staff school in Egypt and served as the chief of staff to Ibrahim Pasha, the son of the &quot;vali&quot; and his favorite general. By the 1820s, Muhammad Ali&#x27;s mercenaries had created a mass conscript army trained to fight in the Western style together with schools for training Egyptian officers and factories for manufacturing Western style weapons as the &quot;vali&quot; did not wish to be dependent upon imported arms.

Muhammad Ali&#x27;s grandson, Ismail the Magnificent, who ruled as the Khedive of Egypt between 1863 and 79 recruited mercenaries on large scale. After Napoleon III made an unfavorable arbitration ruling in 1869 about the share of royalties from the newly opened Suez canal, which cost Ismail 3, 000, 000 Egyptian pounds per year, Ismail came to distrust his French mercenaries, and began to look elsewhere. A number of Italian mercenaries such as Romolo Gessi, Gaetamo Casati, Andreanni Somani, and Giacomo Messedaglia played prominent roles in the Egyptian campaigns in the Sudan. Ismail also recruited British mercenaries such as Samuel Baker and the Swiss mercenaries such as Werner Munzinger. After 1869, Ismail recruited 48 American mercenaries to command his army. General Charles Pomeroy Stone, formerly of the United States Army, served as the chief of the Egyptian general staff between 1870 and 1883. Ismail&#x27;s Americans went to Egypt largely because of the high pay he offered, through several were Confederate veterans who were barred from serving in post-1865 United States Army; the fact that the Americans in Egyptian service had fought on opposing sides in the Civil War was a source of recurring tension as the antagonism between North and South continued in Egypt.

====Syrian civil war====
The Free Syrian Army claimed the Bashar al-Assad regime recruited mercenaries from Iran, Hezbollah militia, and the Iraqi Mahdi Army militia during the Syrian civil war. The Russian government had approved of the deployment in 2016 of the Wagner Group mercenaries to fight for the Syrian government. The Wagner Group is reported to have played an important role in helping to turn the tide of the Syrian civil war in favor of the government, which in 2015 appeared to be close to collapse. On 7 February 2018, the Wagner Group mercenaries were reported to have attacked an American base in Syria together with a pro-Assad militia in what is known as the Battle of Khasham.

Turkey used Syrian mercenaries against the Kurds in Syria.

====Yemen civil war====
Multiple mercenary groups, called Popular Committees, which consists of Yemeni tribes loyal to different factions, were formed by both the Hadi government as well as the Houthi Supreme Political Council in the Yemeni Civil War.

====Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen====
During Operation Decisive Storm, multiple sources reported that Latin American military contractors from Academi headed by Erik Prince were hired by UAE Armed Forces to assist in the fight against Houthis.

<doc id="73375" wikidata="Q875904" url="?curid=73375" title="Bride of Frankenstein">
<text>Bride of Frankenstein is a 1935 American Gothic science fiction horror film, and the first sequel to Universal Pictures&#x27; 1931 film &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. As with the first film, &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; was directed by James Whale starring Boris Karloff as the Monster and Colin Clive as Dr. Frankenstein. The sequel features Elsa Lanchester in the dual role of Mary Shelley and the bride. Colin Clive reprises his role as Henry Frankenstein, and Ernest Thesiger plays the role of Doctor Septimus Pretorius. Oliver Peters Heggie plays the role of the old blind hermit.

Taking place immediately after the events of the earlier film, it is rooted in a subplot of the original Mary Shelley novel, &quot;Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus&quot; (1818). Its plot follows a chastened Henry Frankenstein as he attempts to abandon his plans to create life, only to be tempted and finally blackmailed by his old mentor Dr. Pretorius, along with threats from the Monster, into constructing a bride for the Monster.

The preparation to film the sequel began shortly after the premiere of the first film, but script problems delayed the project. Principal photography began in January 1935, with creative personnel from the original returning in front of and behind the camera. &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; was released to critical and popular acclaim, although it encountered difficulties with some state and national censorship boards. Since its release the film&#x27;s reputation has grown, and it is now frequently considered one of the greatest sequels ever made; many fans and critics consider it to be an improvement on the original, and it has been hailed as Whale&#x27;s masterpiece. In 1998, it was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, having been deemed &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In a castle on a stormy night, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron praise Mary Shelley for her story of Frankenstein and his Monster. She reminds them that her intention for writing the novel was to impart a moral lesson, the consequences of a mortal man who tries to . Mary says she has more of the story to tell. The scene shifts to the close of the 1931 movie &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; where villagers gathered around the burning windmill cheer the apparent death of the Monster.

Hans, the father of a girl the creature drowned, wants to see the Monster&#x27;s bones. He falls into a flooded pit underneath the mill, where the Monster—having survived the fire—strangles him. Hauling himself from the pit, the Monster casts Hans&#x27; wife to her death. He next encounters Frankenstein&#x27;s servant Minnie, who flees in terror.

The body of Henry Frankenstein, who is thought to have died at the windmill, is returned to his fiancée Elizabeth at his castle home. Minnie arrives to sound the alarm about the Monster, but her warning goes unheeded. Elizabeth, seeing Henry move, realizes he is still alive. Nursed back to health by Elizabeth, Henry has renounced his creation, but still believes he may be destined to unlock the secret of life and immortality. A hysterical Elizabeth cries that she foresees death.

Henry visits the lab of his former mentor Doctor Septimus Pretorius, where Pretorius shows Henry several homunculi he has created. Pretorius wishes to work with Henry to create a mate for the Monster, with the proposed venture involving Pretorius growing an artificial brain while Henry gathers parts for the mate.

The Monster saves a young shepherdess from drowning. Her screams upon seeing the Monster alert two hunters, who shoot and injure him. The hunters raise a mob that sets out in pursuit. Captured and trussed to a pole, the Monster is hauled to a dungeon and chained. Left alone, he breaks his chains, overpowers the guards, and escapes into the woods.

That night, the Monster encounters an old blind hermit who thanks God for sending him a friend. He teaches the monster words like &quot;friend&quot; and &quot;good&quot; and shares a meal with him. Two lost hunters stumble upon the cottage and recognize the Monster. He attacks them and accidentally burns down the cottage as the hunters lead the hermit away.

Taking refuge from another angry mob in a crypt, the Monster spies Pretorius and his cronies Karl and Ludwig breaking open a grave. The henchmen depart as Pretorius has supper. The Monster reveals himself, eats some of the food, and learns that Pretorius plans to create a mate for him.

Henry and Elizabeth, now married, are visited by Pretorius. Henry expresses his refusal to assist Pretorius, who calls the Monster. The Monster demands Henry&#x27;s help, to no avail. Pretorius orders the Monster out, secretly signaling him to kidnap Elizabeth. Pretorius guarantees her safe return upon Henry&#x27;s participation. Henry returns to his tower laboratory and, despite himself, grows excited over his work. After being assured of Elizabeth&#x27;s safety, Henry completes the Bride&#x27;s body.

A storm rages as final preparations are made to bring the Bride to life. Her bandage-wrapped body is raised through the roof, where electricity is harnessed from lightning to animate her. Henry and Pretorius lower her and, after realizing their success in bringing her to life, remove her bandages and help her to stand.

The Monster comes down the steps after killing Karl on the rooftop and sees his mate. The Monster reaches out to her and asks: &quot;Friend?&quot; The Bride, screaming, rejects him. He observes: &quot;She hate me! Like others.&quot; As Elizabeth races to Henry&#x27;s side, the Monster rampages through the lab. Before destroying everything, the Monster pauses and tells Henry and Elizabeth: &quot;Go! You live! Go!&quot; To Pretorius and the Bride, he says: &quot;You stay. We belong dead.&quot; While Henry and Elizabeth flee, the Bride hisses at the Monster. Shedding a tear, the Monster pulls a lever to trigger the laboratory and tower&#x27;s destruction.

==Production==

Universal considered making a sequel to &quot;Frankenstein&quot; as early as its 1931 preview screenings, following which the film&#x27;s original ending was changed to allow for Henry Frankenstein&#x27;s survival. James Whale initially refused to direct &quot;Bride&quot;, believing he had &quot;squeezed the idea dry&quot; on the first film. Kurt Neumann was originally scheduled to replace Whale but decided to film &quot;The Black Cat&quot; instead. Following the success of Whale&#x27;s &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, producer Carl Laemmle, Jr. realized that Whale was the only possible director for &quot;Bride&quot;; Whale took advantage of the situation in persuading the studio to let him make &quot;One More River&quot;. Whale believed the sequel would not top the original, so he decided instead to make it a memorable &quot;hoot&quot;. According to a studio publicist, Whale and Universal&#x27;s studio psychiatrist decided &quot;the Monster would have the mental age of a ten-year-old boy and the emotional age of a lad of fifteen&quot;.

Screenwriter Robert Florey wrote a treatment entitled &quot;The New Adventures of Frankenstein — The Monster Lives!&quot;, but it was rejected without comment early in 1932. Universal staff writer Tom Reed wrote a treatment under the title &quot;The Return of Frankenstein&quot;, a title retained until filming began. Following its acceptance in 1933, Reed wrote a full script that was submitted to the Hays office for review. The script passed its review, but Whale, who by then had been contracted to direct, complained that &quot;it stinks to heaven&quot;. L. G. Blochman and Philip MacDonald were the next writers assigned, but Whale also found their work unsatisfactory. In 1934, Whale set John L. Balderston to work on yet another version, and it was he who returned to an incident from the novel in which the creature demands a mate. In the novel Frankenstein creates a mate, but destroys it without bringing it to life. Balderston also created the Mary Shelley prologue. After several months Whale was still not satisfied with Balderston&#x27;s work and handed the project to playwright William J. Hurlbut and Edmund Pearson. The final script, combining elements of a number of these versions, was submitted for Hays office review in November 1934. Kim Newman reports that Whale planned to make Elizabeth the heart donor for the bride, but film historian Scott MacQueen states that Whale never had such an intention.

Sources report that Bela Lugosi and Claude Rains were considered, with varying degrees of seriousness, for the role of Frankenstein&#x27;s mentor, Pretorius; others report that the role was created specifically for Ernest Thesiger. Because of Mae Clarke&#x27;s ill health, Valerie Hobson replaced her as Henry Frankenstein&#x27;s love interest, Elizabeth. Early in production, Whale decided that the same actress cast to play the Bride should also play Mary Shelley in the film&#x27;s prologue, to represent how the story — and horror in general — springs from the dark side of the imagination. He considered Brigitte Helm and Phyllis Brooks before deciding on Elsa Lanchester. Lanchester, who had accompanied husband Charles Laughton to Hollywood, had met with only moderate success while Laughton had made a strong impact with several films including &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; (for which he had won an Oscar) and Whale&#x27;s own &quot;The Old Dark House&quot;. Lanchester had returned alone to London when Whale contacted her to offer her the dual role. Lanchester modeled the Bride&#x27;s hissing on the hissing of swans. She gave herself a sore throat while filming the hissing sequence, which Whale shot from multiple angles.

Colin Clive and Boris Karloff reprised their roles from &quot;Frankenstein&quot; as creator and creation, respectively. Hobson recalled Clive&#x27;s alcoholism had worsened since filming the original, but Whale did not recast the role because his &quot;hysterical quality&quot; was necessary for the film. Karloff strongly objected to the decision to allow the Monster to speak: &quot;Speech! Stupid! My argument was that if the monster had any impact or charm, it was because he was inarticulate – this great, lumbering, inarticulate creature. The moment he spoke you might as well ... play it straight&quot;. This decision also meant that Karloff could not remove his dental plate, so now his cheeks did not have the sunken look of the original film. Whale and the studio psychiatrist selected 44 simple words for the Monster&#x27;s vocabulary by looking at test papers of ten-year-olds working at the studio. Dwight Frye returned to play the doctor&#x27;s assistant, Karl, having played the hunchback Fritz in the original. Frye also filmed a scene as an unnamed villager and the role of &quot;Nephew Glutz&quot;, a man who murdered his uncle and blamed the death on the Monster. Boris Karloff is credited simply as KARLOFF, which was Universal&#x27;s custom during the height of his career. Elsa Lanchester is credited for Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, but in a nod to the earlier film, the Monster&#x27;s bride is credited only as &quot;?&quot; just as Boris Karloff had been in the opening credits of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.
Universal makeup artist Jack Pierce paid special attention to the Monster&#x27;s appearance in this film. He altered his 1931 design to display the after-effects of the mill fire, adding scars and shortening the Monster&#x27;s hair. Over the course of filming, Pierce modified the Monster&#x27;s makeup to indicate that the Monster&#x27;s injuries were healing as the film progressed. Pierce co-created the Bride&#x27;s makeup with strong input from Whale, especially regarding the Bride&#x27;s iconic hair style, based on Nefertiti. Lanchester&#x27;s hair was given a Marcel wave over a wire frame to achieve the style. Lanchester disliked working with Pierce, who she said &quot;really did feel that he made these people, like he was a god ... in the morning he&#x27;d be dressed in white as if he were in hospital to perform an operation&quot;. To play Mary Shelley, Lanchester wore a white net dress embroidered with sequins of butterflies, stars, and moons, which the actress had heard required 17 women 12 weeks to make. Lanchester said of her bride costume: &quot;I drank as little liquid as possible. It was too much of an ordeal to go to the bathroom--all those bandages--and having to be accompanied by my dresser&quot;.

Kenneth Strickfaden created and maintained the laboratory equipment. Strickfaden recycled a number of the fancifully named machines he had created for the original &quot;Frankenstein&quot; for use in &quot;Bride&quot;, including the &quot;Cosmic Ray Diffuser&quot;, and the &quot;Nebularium&quot;. A lightning bolt generated by Strickfaden&#x27;s equipment has become a stock scene, appearing in any number of films and television shows. The man behind the film&#x27;s special photographic effects was John P. Fulton, head of the special effects department at Universal Studios at the time. Fulton and David S. Horsley created the homunculi over the course of two days by shooting the actors in full-size jars against black velvet and aligning them with the perspective of the on-set jars. The foreground film plate was rotoscoped and matted onto the rear plate. Diminutive actor Billy Barty is briefly visible from the back in the finished film as a homunculus infant in a high chair, but Whale cut the infant&#x27;s reveal before the film&#x27;s release.

Whale met Franz Waxman at a party and asked him to score the picture. Whale told him: &quot;Nothing will be resolved in this picture except the end destruction scene. Would you write an unresolved score for it?&quot; Waxman created three distinctive themes: one for the Monster; one for the Bride; and one for Pretorius. The score closes, at Whale&#x27;s suggestion, with a powerful dissonant chord, intended to convey the idea that the on-screen explosion was so powerful that the theater where the film was being screened was affected by it. Constantin Bakaleinikoff conducted 22 musicians to record the score in a single nine-hour session.

Shooting began on January 2, 1935, with a projected budget of US$293,750 ($ as of ) – almost exactly the budget of the original – and an estimated 36-day shooting schedule. On the first day, Karloff waded in the water below the destroyed windmill wearing a rubber suit under his costume. Air got into the suit and expanded it like an &quot;obscene water lily&quot;. Later that day, Karloff broke his hip, necessitating a stunt double. Clive had also broken his leg. Shooting was completed on March 7. The film was ten days over schedule because Whale shut down the picture for ten days until Heggie became available to play the Hermit. With a final cost of $397,023 ($ as of ), &quot;Bride&quot; was more than $100,000 ($ as of ) over budget. As originally filmed, Henry died fleeing the exploding castle. Whale re-shot the ending to allow for their survival, although Clive is still visible on-screen in the collapsing laboratory. Whale completed his final cut, shortening the running time from about 90 to 75 minutes and re-shooting and re-editing the ending, only days before the film&#x27;s scheduled premiere date.

==Censorship==

&quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; was subjected to censorship, both during production by the Hays office and following its release by local and national censorship boards. Joseph Breen, lead censor for the Hays office, objected to lines of dialogue in the originally submitted script in which Henry Frankenstein and his work were compared to that of God. He continued to object to such dialogue in revised scripts, and to a planned shot of the Monster rushing through a graveyard to a figure of a crucified Jesus and attempting to rescue the figure from the cross. Breen also objected to the number of murders, both seen and implied by the script and strongly advised Whale to reduce the number. The censors&#x27; office, upon reviewing the film in March 1935, required a number of cuts. Whale agreed to delete a sequence in which Dwight Frye&#x27;s &quot;Nephew Glutz&quot; kills his uncle and blames the Monster, and shots of Elsa Lanchester as Mary Shelley in which Breen felt too much of her breasts were visible. Despite his earlier objection, Breen offered no objection to the cruciform imagery throughout the film – including a scene with the Monster lashed Christ-like to a pole – nor to the presentation of Pretorius as a coded homosexual. &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; was approved by the Production Code office on April 15.

Following its release with the Code seal of approval, the film was challenged by the censorship board in the state of Ohio. Censors in England and China objected to the scene in which the Monster gazes longingly upon the body intended for reanimation as the Bride, citing concerns that it looked like necrophilia. Universal voluntarily withdrew the film from Sweden because of the extensive cuts demanded, and &quot;Bride&quot; was rejected outright by Trinidad, Palestine, and Hungary. Additionally, Japanese censors objected to the scene in which Pretorius chases his miniature Henry VIII with tweezers, asserting that it constituted &quot;making a fool out of a king&quot;.

==Reception==

The film premiered on April 19 in San Francisco, California, at the Orpheum Theater. The film went into general release on April 20.

&quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; was profitable for Universal, with a 1943 report showing that the film had by then earned approximately $2 million ($ in money) for the studio, a profit of about $950,000 ($ as of ). Contemporary reviews were mostly positive, though the film&#x27;s reputation has grown over time. 

The film was critically praised upon its release, although some reviewers did qualify their opinions based on the film&#x27;s being in the horror genre. The &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; called the film &quot;good entertainment of its kind&quot;. The &quot;New York Post&quot; described it as &quot;a grotesque, gruesome tale which, of its kind, is swell&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; similarly called the film &quot;a joy for those who can appreciate it&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; did not so qualify its review: &quot;[It is] one of those rare instances where none can review it, or talk about it, without mentioning the cameraman, art director, and score composer in the same breath as the actors and director&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; also praised the cast, writing that &quot;Karloff manages to invest the character with some subtleties of emotion that are surprisingly real and touching ... Thesiger as Dr. Pretorious [is] a diabolic characterization if ever there was one ... Lanchester handles two assignments, being first in a preamble as author Mary Shelley and then the created woman. In latter assignment she impresses quite highly&quot;.

In another unqualified review, &quot;Time&quot; wrote that the film had &quot;a vitality that makes their efforts fully the equal of the original picture ... Screenwriters Hurlbut &amp; Balderston and Director James Whale have given it the macabre intensity proper to all good horror pieces, but have substituted a queer kind of mechanistic pathos for the sheer evil that was &quot;Frankenstein&quot;&quot;. The &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; concurred it was &quot;a fantasy produced on a rather magnificent scale, with excellent stagecraft and fine photographic effects&quot;. While the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; thought that the electrical equipment might have been better suited to Buck Rogers, nonetheless the reviewer praised the film as &quot;exciting and sometimes morbidly gruesome&quot;, declaring that &quot;all who enjoyed &quot;Frankenstein&quot; will welcome his &quot;Bride&quot; as a worthy successor&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Karloff &quot;so splendid in the role that all one can say is &#x27;he is the Monster&#x27;&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; praised the entire principal cast and Whale&#x27;s direction in concluding that &quot;Bride&quot; is &quot;a first-rate horror film&quot;, and presciently suggested that &quot;the Monster should become an institution, like Charlie Chan&quot;. &quot;Bride&quot; was nominated for one Academy Award, for Sound Recording (Gilbert Kurland).

The film&#x27;s reputation has persisted and grown in the decades since its release. In 1998, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry, having been deemed &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. Frequently identified as James Whale&#x27;s masterpiece, the film is lauded as &quot;the finest of all gothic horror movies&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; rated &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; in its &quot;All-Time 100 Movies&quot;, in which critics Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel overruled the magazine&#x27;s original review to declare the film &quot;one of those rare sequels that is infinitely superior to its source&quot;. Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; added &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; to his list of The Great Movies in 1999. He described it as &quot;the best of the Frankenstein movies--a sly, subversive work that smuggled shocking material past the censors by disguising it in the trappings of horror. Some movies age; others ripen.&quot; Ebert also added how Lanchester&#x27;s character provided &quot;one of the immortal images of the cinema with lightning-like streaks of silver in her weirdly towering hair&quot;.

In 2008, &quot;Bride&quot; was selected by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine as one of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. Also that year, the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; named it the second greatest horror film after &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. In 2016, James Charisma of &quot;Playboy&quot; ranked the film #7 on a list of &quot;15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; considers the film superior to &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.

==Interpretations==
===Christian imagery===

Christian imagery appears throughout the film. In addition to the scenes of the Monster trussed in a cruciform pose and the crucified figure of Jesus in the graveyard, the hermit has a crucifix on the wall of his hut – which, to Whale&#x27;s consternation, editor Ted Kent made glow during a fade-out – and the Monster consumes the Christian sacraments of bread and wine at his &quot;last supper&quot; with the hermit. Horror scholar David J. Skal suggests that Whale&#x27;s intention was to make a &quot;direct comparison of Frankenstein&#x27;s monster to Christ&quot;. Film scholar Scott MacQueen, noting Whale&#x27;s lack of any religious convictions, disputes the notion that the Monster is a Christ-figure. Rather, the Monster is a &quot;mockery of the divine&quot; since, having been created by Man rather than God, it &quot;lacks the divine spark&quot;. In crucifying the Monster, he says, Whale &quot;pushes the audience&#x27;s buttons&quot; by inverting the central Christian belief of the death of Christ followed by the resurrection. The Monster is raised from the dead first, then crucified.

===Gay reading=== 

In the decades since its release, modern film scholars have noted the possible gay interpretations of the film. Director James Whale was openly gay, and some of the actors in the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and, according to rumor, Colin Clive, were respectively gay or bisexual. Although James Curtis, Whale&#x27;s biographer, rejects the notion that Whale would have identified with the Monster from a homosexual perspective, scholars have perceived a gay subtext suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius and his relationship with Henry.

Gay film historian Vito Russo, in considering Pretorius, stops short of identifying the character as gay, instead referring to him as &quot;sissified&quot;, &quot;sissy&quot; itself being Hollywood code for &quot;homosexual&quot;. Pretorius serves as a &quot;gay Mephistopheles&quot;, a figure of seduction and temptation, going so far as to pull Frankenstein away from his bride on their wedding night to engage in the unnatural act of creating non-procreative life. A novelization of the film published in the United Kingdom made the implication clear, having Pretorius say to Frankenstein: &quot;Be fruitful and multiply. Let us obey the Biblical injunction: you of course, have the choice of natural means; but as for me, I am afraid that there is no course open to me but the scientific way&quot;.

The Monster, whose affections for the male hermit and the female Bride he discusses with identical language (&quot;friend&quot;) has been interpreted as sexually &quot;unsettled&quot; and bisexual. Gender studies author Elizabeth Young writes: &quot;He has no innate understanding that the male-female bond he is to forge with the bride is assumed to be the primary one or that it carries a different sexual valence from his relationships with [Pretorius and the hermit]: all affective relationships are as easily &#x27;friendships&#x27; as &#x27;marriages&#x27;&quot;. Indeed, his relationship with the hermit has been interpreted as a same-sex marriage that heterosexual society will not tolerate: &quot;No mistake – this is a marriage, and a viable one ... But Whale reminds us quickly that society does not approve. The monster – the outsider – is driven from his scene of domestic pleasure by two gun-toting rubes who happen upon this startling alliance and quickly, instinctively, proceed to destroy it&quot;, writes cultural critic Gary Morris for &quot;Bright Lights Film Journal&quot;. The creation of the Bride scene, Morris continues, is &quot;Whale&#x27;s reminder to the audience – his Hollywood bosses, peers, and everyone watching – of the majesty and power of the homosexual creator&quot;.

Filmmaker Curtis Harrington, a friend and confidant of Whale&#x27;s, dismissed this as &quot;a younger critic&#x27;s evaluation. All artists do work that comes out of the unconscious mind and later on you can analyze it and say the symbolism may mean something, but artists don&#x27;t think that way and I would bet my life that James Whale would never have had such concepts in mind&quot;. Specifically in response to the &quot;majesty and power&quot; reading, Harrington stated: &quot;My opinion is that&#x27;s just pure bullshit. That&#x27;s a critical interpretation that has nothing to do with the original inspiration&quot;. He concludes: &quot;I think the closest you can come to a homosexual metaphor in his films is to identify that certain sort of camp humor&quot;. Whale&#x27;s companion David Lewis stated flatly that Whale&#x27;s sexual orientation was &quot;not germane&quot; to his filmmaking: &quot;Jimmy was first and foremost an artist, and his films represent the work of an artist – not a gay artist, but an artist&quot;.

<doc id="73376" wikidata="Q179743" url="?curid=73376" title="Bringing Up Baby">
<text>Bringing Up Baby is a 1938 American screwball comedy film directed by Howard Hawks, and starring Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant. It was released by RKO Radio Pictures. The film tells the story of a paleontologist in a number of predicaments involving a scatterbrained heiress and a leopard named Baby. The screenplay was adapted by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde from a short story by Wilde which originally appeared in &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; magazine on April 10, 1937.

The script was written specifically for Hepburn, and tailored to her personality. Filming began in September 1937 and wrapped in January 1938, over schedule and over budget. Production was frequently delayed by Hepburn and Grant&#x27;s uncontrollable laughing fits. Hepburn struggled with her comedic performance and was coached by another cast member, vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett. A tame leopard named Nissa was used during the shooting and played two roles in the film; Nissa&#x27;s trainer stood off-screen with a whip for all of its scenes.

&quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; was a box-office bomb upon its release, although it eventually made a small profit after its re-release in the early 1940s. Shortly after the film&#x27;s premiere, Hepburn was one of a group of actors labeled as &quot;box office poison&quot; by the Independent Theatre Owners of America. Her career waned until &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; two years later. The film&#x27;s reputation began to grow during the 1950s when it was shown on television.

Since then, the film has gained acclaim from both critics and audiences for its zany antics and pratfalls, absurd situations and misunderstandings, comic timing, completely screwball cast, series of lunatic and hare-brained misadventures, disasters, light-hearted surprises and romantic comedy.

In 1990, &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant,&quot; and it has appeared on a number of greatest-films lists, ranking 88th on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 100 greatest American films of all time list.

==Plot==
David Huxley is a mild-mannered paleontologist. For the past four years, he has been assembling the skeleton of a &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; but is missing one bone: the &quot;intercostal clavicle.&quot; Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to Alice Swallow and the need to impress Elizabeth Random, who is considering a million-dollar donation to his museum.

The day before his wedding, David meets Susan Vance by chance on a golf course. She plays his ball, but she is oblivious to the fact that she has made a mistake. Susan is a free-spirited, somewhat scatterbrained, young lady, unfettered by logic. These qualities soon embroil David in several frustrating incidents.

Susan&#x27;s brother Mark has sent her a tame leopard named Baby from Brazil. Its tameness is helped by hearing the song &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything but Love, Baby&quot;. Susan thinks David is a zoologist, and manipulates him into accompanying her in taking Baby to her farm in Connecticut. Complications arise when Susan falls in love with him, and she tries to keep him at her house as long as possible, even hiding his clothes, to prevent his imminent marriage.

David&#x27;s prized intercostal clavicle is delivered, but Susan&#x27;s aunt&#x27;s dog George takes it and buries it somewhere. When Susan&#x27;s aunt arrives, she discovers David in a negligee. To David&#x27;s dismay, she turns out to be Elizabeth Random. A second message from Mark makes clear the leopard is for Elizabeth, as she always wanted one. Baby and George, who have befriended one another, run off. The zoo is called to help capture Baby. Susan and David race to find Baby before the zookeepers do and, mistaking a dangerous leopard from a nearby circus for Baby, they let it out of its cage.
David and Susan are jailed by a befuddled town policeman, Constable Slocum, for acting strangely at the house of Dr. Fritz Lehman, where they have cornered the circus leopard, thinking it is Baby. When Slocum does not believe their story, Susan tells him they are members of the &quot;Leopard Gang&quot;; she calls herself &quot;Swingin&#x27; Door Susie,&quot; and David &quot;Jerry the Nipper.&quot; Eventually, when everyone&#x27;s identity has been cleared up, Susan
(who earlier escaped out a window) returns, dragging a leopard on a rope. When it is revealed that this is not Baby but the highly irritated circus leopard, David saves Susan, using a chair to shoo the big cat into a cell.

Some time later, Susan finds David, who has been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high platform working on his &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; reconstruction at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur to be closer to him. She tells David that her aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life. They declare their love for each other, and Susan, distracted by the moment, unconsciously swings the ladder from side to side. As they talk, and the ladder sways more and more with each swing, Susan and David finally notice that Susan is in danger. Frightened, she climbs onto the skeleton, eventually causing it to collapse. David grabs her hand before she falls, lifts her onto the platform, and halfheartedly complains about the loss of his years of work on his &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; as she talks him into forgiving her. Resigning himself to a future of chaos, David embraces and kisses Susan.

==Production==

===Development and writing===

In March 1937, Howard Hawks signed a contract at RKO for an adaptation of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Gunga Din&quot;, which had been in pre-production since the previous fall. When RKO was unable to borrow Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for the film and the adaptation of &quot;Gunga Din&quot; was delayed, Hawks began looking for a new project. In April 1937, he read a short story by Hagar Wilde in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine called &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; and immediately wanted to make a film from it, remembering that it made him laugh out loud. RKO bought the screen rights in June for $1,004, and Hawks worked briefly with Wilde on the film&#x27;s treatment. Wilde&#x27;s short story differed significantly from the film: David and Susan are engaged, he is not a scientist and there is no dinosaur, intercostal clavicle or museum. However, Susan gets a pet panther from her brother Mark to give to their Aunt Elizabeth; David and Susan must capture the panther in the Connecticut wilderness with the help of Baby&#x27;s favorite song, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything but Love, Baby&quot;.

Hawks then hired screenwriter Dudley Nichols, best known for his work with director John Ford, for the script. Wilde would develop the characters and comedic elements of the script, while Nichols would take care of the story and structure. Hawks worked with the two writers during summer 1937, and they came up with a 202-page script. Wilde and Nichols wrote several drafts together, beginning a romantic relationship and co-authoring the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film &quot;Carefree&quot; a few months later. The &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; script underwent several changes, and at one point there was an elaborate pie fight, inspired by Mack Sennett films. Major Applegate had an assistant and food taster named Ali (which was intended to be played by Mischa Auer), but this character was replaced with Aloysius Gogarty. The script&#x27;s final draft had several scenes in the middle of the film in which David and Susan declare their love for each other which Hawks cut during production.

Nichols was instructed to write the film for Hepburn, with whom he had worked on John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Mary of Scotland&quot; (1936). Barbara Leaming alleged that Ford had an affair with Hepburn, and claims that many of the characteristics of Susan and David were based on Hepburn and Ford. Nichols was in touch with Ford during the screenwriting, and the film included such members of the John Ford Stock Company as Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald, D&#x27;Arcy Corrigan and associate producer Cliff Reid. John Ford was a friend of Hawks, and visited the set. The round glasses Grant wears in the film are reminiscent of Harold Lloyd and of Ford.

Filming was scheduled to begin on September 1, 1937 and wrap on October 31, but was delayed for several reasons. Production had to wait until mid-September to clear the rights for &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything but Love, Baby&quot; for $1,000. In August, Hawks hired gag writers Robert McGowan and Gertrude Purcell for uncredited script rewrites, and McGowan added a scene inspired by the comic strip &quot;Professor Dinglehoofer and his Dog&quot; in which a dog buries a rare dinosaur bone. RKO paid King Features $1,000 to use the idea for the film on September 21.

====Unscripted ad-lib by Grant====
It has been debated whether &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; is the first fictional work (apart from pornography) to use the word &quot;gay&quot; in a homosexual context. In one scene, Cary Grant&#x27;s character is wearing a woman&#x27;s marabou-trimmed négligée; when asked why, he replies exasperatedly &quot;Because I just went gay all of a sudden!&quot; (leaping into the air at the word &quot;gay&quot;). As the term &quot;gay&quot; was not familiar to the general public until the Stonewall riots in 1969, it is questioned whether the word is used by Grant in its original sense (meaning &quot;happy&quot;) or is an intentional, joking reference to homosexuality.

The line in the film was an ad-lib by Grant, and was not in the script. According to Vito Russo in &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot; (1981, revised 1987), the script originally had Grant&#x27;s character say &quot;I...I suppose you think it&#x27;s odd, my wearing this. I realize it looks odd...I don&#x27;t usually...I mean, I don&#x27;t own one of these&quot;. Russo suggests that this indicates that people in Hollywood (at least in Grant&#x27;s circles) were familiar with the slang connotations of the word; however, there is no record that Grant or anyone involved with the film ever discussed the matter publicly.

The 1933 film &quot;My Weakness&quot; had previously used the word &quot;gay&quot; as an overt descriptor of homosexuality; one of two men pining away for the same woman suddenly suggests a solution to their mutual problem: &quot;Let&#x27;s be gay!&quot; However, the Studio Relations Committee censors decreed that the line was too risqué and had to be muffled. The film &quot;This Side of Heaven&quot; (1934) included a scene in which a fussy, gossipy interior decorator tries to sell a floral fabric pattern to a customer, who knowingly replies, &quot;It strikes me as a bit too gay.&quot;

===Casting===

After briefly considering Hawks&#x27;s cousin Carole Lombard for the role of Susan Vance, producers chose Katharine Hepburn to play the wealthy New Englander because of her background and similarities to the character. RKO agreed to the casting, but had reservations because of Hepburn&#x27;s salary and lack of box-office success for several years. Producer Lou Lusty said, &quot;You couldn&#x27;t even break even, if a Hepburn show cost eight hundred grand.&quot; At first, Hawks and producer Pandro S. Berman could not agree on whom to cast in the role of David Huxley. Hawks initially wanted silent-film comedian Harold Lloyd; Berman rejected Lloyd and Ronald Colman, offering the role to Robert Montgomery, Fredric March and Ray Milland (all of whom turned it down).

Hawks&#x27; friend Howard Hughes finally suggested Cary Grant for the role. Grant had just finished shooting his breakthrough romantic comedy &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; (1937), and Hawks may have seen a rough cut of the unreleased film. Grant then had a non-exclusive, four-picture deal with RKO for $50,000 per film, and Grant&#x27;s manager used his casting in the film to renegotiate his contract, earning him $75,000 plus the bonuses Hepburn was receiving. Grant was concerned about being able to play an intellectual character and took two weeks to accept the role, despite the new contract. Hawks built Grant&#x27;s confidence by promising to coach him throughout the film, instructing him to watch Harold Lloyd films for inspiration. Grant met with Howard Hughes throughout the film to discuss his character, which he said helped his performance.

Hawks obtained character actors Charlie Ruggles on loan from Paramount Pictures for Major Horace Applegate and Barry Fitzgerald on loan from The Mary Pickford Corporation to play gardener Aloysius Gogarty. Hawks cast Virginia Walker as Alice Swallow, David&#x27;s fiancée; Walker was under contract to him and later married his brother William Hawks. As Hawks could not find a panther that would work for the film, Baby was changed to a leopard so they could cast the trained leopard Nissa, who had worked in films for eight years, making several B-movies.

===Filming===
Shooting began September 23, 1937, and was scheduled to end November 20, 1937, on a budget of $767,676. Filming began in-studio with the scenes in Susan&#x27;s apartment, moving to the Bel Air Country Club in early October for the golf-course scenes. The production had a difficult start due to Hepburn&#x27;s struggles with her character and her comedic abilities. She frequently overacted, trying too hard to be funny, and Hawks asked vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett to help coach her. Catlett acted out scenes with Grant for Hepburn, showing her that he was funnier when he was serious. Hepburn understood, acted naturally and played herself for the rest of the shoot; she was so impressed by Catlett&#x27;s talent and coaching ability that she insisted he play Constable Slocum in the film.

Most shooting was done at the Arthur Ranch in the San Fernando Valley, which was used as Aunt Elizabeth&#x27;s estate for interior and exterior scenes. Beginning at the Arthur Ranch shoot, Grant and Hepburn often ad-libbed their dialogue and frequently delayed production by making each other laugh. The scene where Grant frantically asks Hepburn where his bone is, was shot from 10 am until well after 4 pm because of the stars&#x27; laughing fits. After one month of shooting Hawks was seven days behind schedule. During the filming, Hawks would refer to four different versions of the film&#x27;s script and make frequent changes to scenes and dialogue. His leisurely attitude on set and shutting down production to see a horse race contributed to the lost time. He took twelve days to shoot the Westlake jail scene instead of the scheduled five. Hawks later facetiously blamed the setbacks on his two stars&#x27; laughing fits and having to work with two animal actors.

The terrier George was played by Skippy, known as Asta in &quot;The Thin Man&quot; film series and co-starring with Grant (as Mr. Smith) in &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;. The tame leopard Baby and the escaped circus leopard were both played by a trained leopard, Nissa; Nissa was supervised by its trainer, Olga Celeste, who stood by with a whip during shooting. At one point, when Hepburn spun around (causing her skirt to twirl) Nissa lunged at her and was subdued when Celeste cracked her whip. Hepburn wore heavy perfume to keep Nissa calm and was unafraid of the leopard, but Grant was terrified; most scenes of the two interacting are done in close-up with a stand-in. Hepburn played upon his fear by throwing a toy leopard through the roof of Grant&#x27;s dressing room during production. There were several news reports about Hawks&#x27;s difficulty filming the live leopard, and the potential danger to highly valuable actors, so some scenes required rear-screen projection, while several others were shot using traveling mattes. In a scene where Grant has Baby on a leash, it is quite obvious that the leash was hand painted on film because it proved impossible to make the two parts of the leash join in the traveling matte.

Hawks and Hepburn had a confrontation one day during shooting. While Hepburn was chatting with a crew member, Hawks yelled &quot;Quiet!&quot; until the only person still talking was Hepburn. When Hepburn paused and realized that everyone was looking at her, she asked what was the matter. Hawks asked her if she was finished imitating a parrot. Hepburn took Hawks aside, telling him never to talk to her like that again since she was old friends with most of the crew. When Hawks (an even older friend of the crew) asked a lighting tech whom he would rather drop a light on, Hepburn agreed to behave on set. A variation of this scene, with Grant yelling &quot;Quiet!&quot;, was incorporated into the film.

The Westlake Street set was shot at 20th Century Fox Studios. Filming was eventually completed on January 6, 1938, with the scenes outside Mr. Peabody&#x27;s house. RKO producers expressed concern about the film&#x27;s delays and expense, coming in 40 days over schedule and $330,000 over budget, and also disliked Grant&#x27;s glasses and Hepburn&#x27;s hair. The film&#x27;s final cost was $1,096,796.23, primarily due to overtime clauses in Hawks&#x27;s, Grant&#x27;s and Hepburn&#x27;s contracts. The film&#x27;s cost for sets and props was only $5,000 over budget, but all actors (including Nissa and Skippy) were paid approximately double their initial salaries. Hepburn&#x27;s salary rose from $72,500 to $122,000, Grant&#x27;s from $75,000 to $123,000 and Hawks&#x27;s from $88,000 to $203,000; Hawks received an additional $40,000 to terminate his RKO contract on March 21, 1938.

===Post-production and previews===
Hawks&#x27;s editor, George Hively, cut the film during production and the final prints were made a few days after shooting ended. The first cut of the film (10,150 feet long) was sent to the Hays Office in mid-January. Despite several double entendres and sexual references it passed the film, overlooking Grant saying he &quot;went gay&quot; or Hepburn&#x27;s reference to George urinating. The censor&#x27;s only objections were to the scene where Hepburn&#x27;s dress is torn, and references to politicians (such as Al Smith and Jim Farley).

Like all Hawks&#x27;s comedies, the film is fast paced (despite being filmed primarily in long medium shots, with little cross-cutting). Hawks told Peter Bogdanovich, &quot;You get more pace if you pace the actors quickly within the frame rather than cross cutting fast&quot;.

By February 18, the film had been cut to 9,204 feet. It had two advance previews in January 1938, where it received either As or A-pluses on audience-feedback cards. Producer Pandro S. Berman wanted to cut five more minutes, but relented when Hawks, Grant and Cliff Reid objected. At the film&#x27;s second preview, the film received rave reviews and RKO expected a hit. The film&#x27;s musical score is minimal, primarily Grant and Hepburn singing &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything But Love, Baby&quot;. There is incidental music in the Ritz scene, and an arrangement of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything But Love, Baby&quot; during the opening and closing credits by musical director Roy Webb.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

The film received good advance reviews, with Otis Ferguson of &quot;The New Republic&quot; writing the film was very funny, and praising Hawks&#x27;s direction. &quot;Variety&quot; also praised the film, singling out Hawks&#x27; pacing and direction, calling Hepburn&#x27;s performance &quot;one of her most invigorating screen characterizations&quot; and saying Grant &quot;performs his role to the hilt&quot;; their only criticism was the length of the jail scene. &quot;Film Daily&quot; called it &quot;literally a riot from beginning to end, with the laugh total heavy and the action fast.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called the film &quot;An excellent farce&quot; with &quot;many situations that provoke hearty laughter,&quot; and John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that both stars &quot;manage to be funny&quot; and that Hepburn had never &quot;seemed so good-natured.&quot; However, Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; disliked the film, considering it derivative and cliché-ridden, a rehash of dozens of other screwball comedies of the period. He labeled Hepburn&#x27;s performance &quot;breathless, senseless, and terribly, terribly fatiguing&quot;, and added, &quot;If you&#x27;ve never been to the movies, &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; will be new to you – a zany-ridden product of the goofy-farce school. But who hasn&#x27;t been to the movies?&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 68 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;With Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant at their effervescent best, &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; is a seamlessly assembled comedy with enduring appeal.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 91 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Box office===
Despite &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;s reputation as a flop, it was successful in some parts of the U.S. The film premiered on February 16, 1938, at the Golden Gate Theatre in San Francisco (where it was a hit), and was also successful in Los Angeles, Portland, Denver, Cincinnati and Washington, D.C. However, it was a financial disappointment in the Midwest, as well as most other cities in the country, including NYC; to RKO&#x27;s chagrin, the film&#x27;s premiere in New York on March 3, 1938, at Radio City Music Hall made only $70,000 and it was pulled after one week in favor of &quot;Jezebel&quot; with Bette Davis.

During its first run, &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; made $715,000 in the U.S. and $394,000 in foreign markets for a total of $1,109,000; its reissue in 1940 and 1941 made an additional $95,000 in the US and $55,000 in foreign markets. Following its second run, the film made a profit of $163,000. Due to its perceived failure, Hawks was released early from his two-film contract with RKO and &quot;Gunga Din&quot; was eventually directed by George Stevens. Hawks later said the film &quot;had a great fault and I learned an awful lot from that. There were &quot;no&quot; normal people in it. Everyone you met was a screwball and since that time I learned my lesson and don&#x27;t intend ever again to make everybody crazy.&quot; The director went on to work with RKO on three films over the next decade. Long before &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;s release, Hepburn had been branded &quot;box office poison&quot; by Harry Brandt (president of the Independent Theatre Owners of America) and thus was allowed to buy out her RKO contract for $22,000. However, many critics marveled at her new skill at low comedy; &quot;Life&quot; magazine called her &quot;the surprise of the picture&quot;. Hepburn&#x27;s former boyfriend Howard Hughes bought RKO in 1948, and sold it in 1955; when he sold the company, Hughes retained the copyright to six films (including &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;).

==Themes and interpretations==
Several commentators have written that &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; blurs or reverses stereotypical gender roles assigned to men and women, as the bumbling, &quot;sexless&quot; workaholic David is pursued and eventually won over by the anarchic, confident Susan; this is contrasted by David&#x27;s fiancé Alice, who &quot;dismisses sexuality and reproduction in favor of work.&quot; Academics Robin L. Murray and Joseph K. Heumann write, &quot;The bone and leopard are not only real, but they also represent elements missing from David&#x27;s urban life as resident museum paleontologist and Alice&#x27;s fiancé: sex and children.&quot; By the end of the film, they note, &quot;Instead of returning to his original role intact, David declares his love for Susan, even as his brontosaurus tumbles to the ground, signifying the success of Susan&#x27;s reeducation of him. Not only has she crushed his glasses to enhance his beauty, but she has also demolished his work.&quot;

Murray and Heumann argue that the film&#x27;s narrative &quot;promotes a cynical view of marriage and a rational urban society&quot;, an element that writer and film critic Sheila O&#x27;Malley characterizes as common in Hawks&#x27;s filmography: &quot;Marriage barely exists in Hawks&#x27;s films, and when it does show up, it&#x27;s not exactly a blessing. [...] &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; may end in an embrace, but it is impossible to imagine David and Susan in a conventional domestic relationship.&quot; Over the course of the film, O&#x27;Malley adds, &quot;David becomes a real person. Alice dumps him, saying, &#x27;You showed yourself up in your true colors. You&#x27;re just a butterfly.&#x27; Alice, of course, misses the point, as the Alices of the world always do. A butterfly doesn&#x27;t symbolize irresponsibility. A butterfly symbolizes transformation. Susan forces David out of his chrysalis, and he emerges into the limitless night air, where a man can breathe, where a woman not only loves him but returns his bone to him, at last.&quot;

In addition to its playing with gender roles, Murray and Heumann write that &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; contains themes of exploitation, and the impact of colonialism and the removing of animals from their natural habitats:
Focusing on the unlikely pairing of zany heiress Susan and befuddled paleontologist David, &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; broaches multiple ecocritical questions: Does a natural history museum and its paleontologist David deserve a $1 million donation from Susan&#x27;s Aunt Elizabeth (May Robson)? Is a rational woman like David&#x27;s fiancé Alice (Virginia Walker) more or less appealing than an irrational but sexualized Susan? Should wild creatures be extracted and domesticated from colonized jungles? And does reconstructed nature trump the natural landscape of the gendered body?

==Legacy==
&quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; was the second of four films starring Grant and Hepburn; the others were &quot;Sylvia Scarlett&quot; (1935), &quot;Holiday&quot; (1938) and &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940). The film&#x27;s concept was described by philosopher Stanley Cavell as a &quot;definitive achievement in the history of the art of film.&quot; Cavell noted that &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; was made in a tradition of romantic comedy with inspiration from ancient Rome and Shakespeare. Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and &quot;As You Like It&quot; have been cited in particular as influences on the film and the screwball comedy in general, with their &quot;haughty, self-sufficient men, strong women and fierce combat of words and wit.&quot; Hepburn&#x27;s character has been cited as an early example of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl film archetype.

The popularity of &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; has increased since it was shown on television during the 1950s, and by the 1960s film analysts (including the writers at in France) affirmed the film&#x27;s quality. In a rebuttal of fellow &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Nugent&#x27;s scathing review of the film at the time of release, A. O. Scott has said that you&#x27;ll &quot;find yourself amazed at its freshness, its vigor, and its brilliance—qualities undiminished after sixty-five years, and likely to withstand repeated viewings.&quot; Leonard Maltin stated that it is now &quot;considered the definitive screwball comedy, and one of the fastest, funniest films ever made; grand performances by all.&quot;

&quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; has been adapted several times. Hawks recycled the nightclub scene in which Hepburn&#x27;s dress is torn and Grant walks behind her in the comedy &quot;Man&#x27;s Favorite Sport&quot; (1964). Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s film &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; (1972), starring Barbra Streisand and Ryan O&#x27;Neal, was intended as an homage to the film, and has contributed to its reputation. In the commentary track for &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;, Bogdanovich discusses how the coat-ripping scene in &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; was based on the scene in which Grant&#x27;s coat and Hepburn&#x27;s dress are torn in &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;.

The French film &quot;Une Femme ou Deux&quot; (English: &quot;One Woman or Two&quot;; 1985), starring Gérard Depardieu, Sigourney Weaver, and Dr. Ruth Westheimer, is a rework of &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;. The film &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl?&quot; (1987), starring Madonna, is also loosely based on &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;.

In 1990 (the registry&#x27;s second year), &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted the film 24th on its list of greatest films. In 2000, readers of &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine voted it the 47th-greatest comedy film of all time. &quot;Premiere&quot; ranked Cary Grant&#x27;s performance as Dr. David Huxley 68th on its list of 100 all-time greatest performances, and ranked Susan Vance 21st on its list of 100 all-time greatest movie characters.

The National Society of Film Critics also included &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; in their &quot;100 Essential Films&quot;, considering it to be arguably the director&#x27;s best film.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

* 1998: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies – #97
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #14
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – #51
* 2007: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – #88

<text>Broken Blossoms or The Yellow Man and the Girl, often referred to simply as Broken Blossoms, is a 1919 American silent melodrama film directed by D. W. Griffith. It was distributed by United Artists and premiered on May 13, 1919. It stars Lillian Gish, Richard Barthelmess, and Donald Crisp, and tells the story of young girl, Lucy Burrows, who is abused by her alcoholic prizefighting father, Battling Burrows, and meets Cheng Huan, a kind-hearted Chinese man who falls in love with her. It was the first film distributed by United Artists. It is based on Thomas Burke&#x27;s short story &quot;The Chink and the Child&quot; from the 1916 collection &quot;Limehouse Nights&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures to be added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress.

==Plot==
Cheng Huan leaves his native China because he &quot;dreams to spread the gentle message of Buddha to the Anglo-Saxon lands.&quot; His idealism fades as he is faced with the brutal reality of London&#x27;s gritty inner-city. However, his mission is finally realized in his devotion to the &quot;broken blossom&quot; Lucy Burrows, the beautiful but unwanted and abused daughter of boxer Battling Burrows.

After being beaten and discarded one evening by her raging father, Lucy finds sanctuary in Cheng&#x27;s home, the beautiful and exotic room above his shop. As Cheng nurses Lucy back to health, the two form a bond as two unwanted outcasts of society. All goes astray for them when Lucy&#x27;s father gets wind of his daughter&#x27;s whereabouts and in a drunken rage drags her back to their home to punish her. Fearing for her life, Lucy locks herself inside a closet to escape her contemptuous father.

By the time Cheng arrives to rescue Lucy, whom he so innocently adores, it is too late. Lucy&#x27;s lifeless body lies on her modest bed as Battling has a drink in the other room. As Cheng gazes at Lucy&#x27;s youthful face which, in spite of the circumstances, beams with innocence and even the slightest hint of a smile, Battling enters the room to make his escape. The two stand for a long while, exchanging spiteful glances, until Battling lunges for Cheng with a hatchet, and Cheng retaliates by shooting Burrows repeatedly with his handgun. After returning to his home with Lucy&#x27;s body, Cheng builds a shrine to the Buddha and takes his own life with a knife to the chest.

==Cast==
* Lillian Gish as Lucy Burrows
* Richard Barthelmess as Cheng Huan
* Donald Crisp as Battling Burrows
* Arthur Howard as Burrows&#x27; manager

* George Beranger as The Spying One
* Norman Selby (aka Kid McCoy) as A prizefighter

==Production and style==
Unlike Griffith&#x27;s more extravagant earlier works like &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; or &quot;Intolerance&quot;, &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; is a small-scale film that uses controlled studio environments, to create a more intimate &quot;impressionistic&quot; effect, reminiscent of the &quot;impressionist school of painting&quot;. Shot entirely in the studio, &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; is notable in that most of Hollywood productions at the time &quot;relied heavily on location work to provide any kind of effective atmosphere&quot;. The visual style of &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; emphasizes the seedy Limehouse streets with their dark shadows, drug addicts, and drunkards, contrasting them with the beauty of Cheng and Lucy&#x27;s innocent attachment as expressed by Cheng&#x27;s decorative apartment. Conversely, the Burrows&#x27; bare cell reeks of oppression and hostility. Film critic and historian Richard Schickel goes so far as to credit this gritty realism with inspiring &quot;the likes of Pabst, Stiller, von Sternberg, and others, [and then] re-emerging in the United States in the sound era, in the genre identified as Film Noir&quot;.

Griffith was known for his willingness to collaborate with his actors and on many occasions join them in research outings. As such, &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; is “the fusion of directorial and acting style.”

Griffith was unsure of his final product and took several months to complete the editing, saying: &quot;I can&#x27;t look at the damn thing; it depresses me so.&quot;

==Box office==
The film was originally made for Famous Players–Lasky. The company sold it to the newly founded United Artists for $250,000. The film turned out to be a hit at the box office and earned a profit of $700,000. It was the first film ever distributed by United Artists.

==Reception==
&quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; premiered in May 1919, at George M. Cohan&#x27;s Theatre in New York City as part of the D. W. Griffith Repertory Season. According to Lillian Gish&#x27;s autobiography, theaters were decorated with flowers, moon lanterns and beautiful Chinese brocaded draperies for the premiere. Critics and audiences were pleased with Griffith&#x27;s follow-up film to his 1916 epic &quot;Intolerance&quot;. Contrasting with &quot;Intolerance&quot;&#x27;s grand story, set and length, Griffith charmed audiences by the delicacy with which &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; handled such a complex subject.
The scenes of child abuse nauseated backers when Griffith gave them a preview of the film; according to Lillian Gish in interviews, a &quot;Variety&quot; reporter invited to sit in on a second take left the room to vomit.
Today, &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; is widely regarded as one of Griffith&#x27;s finest works. In 2012, the film received five critics&#x27; votes and one director&#x27;s vote in the British Film Institute&#x27;s decennial &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll. Roger Ebert was a longtime champion of the film, having added it to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; series; and in 1996, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Akira Kurosawa, the legendary Japanese director, named this movie as one of his 100 favorite films.

&quot;Unbroken Blossoms&quot;, a play about the making of the film told from the perspective of the two Chinese American consultants hired to work on the project, premiered at East West Players in Summer 2024. 

==Themes==
Cruelty and injustice against the innocent are a recurring theme in Griffith&#x27;s films and are graphically portrayed here. The introductory card says, &quot;We may believe there are no Battling Burrows, striking the helpless with brutal whip — but do we not ourselves use the whip of unkind words and deeds? So, perhaps, Battling may even carry a message of warning.&quot;

&quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; was released during a period of strong anti-Chinese feeling in the U.S., a fear known as the Yellow Peril. The phrase &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; was common in the U.S. newspapers owned by William Randolph Hearst. It was also the title of a popular book by an influential U.S. religious figure, G. G. Rupert, who published &quot;The Yellow Peril; or, Orient vs. Occident&quot; in 1911. Griffith changed Burke&#x27;s original story to promote a message of tolerance. In Burke&#x27;s story, the Chinese protagonist is a sordid young Shanghai drifter pressed into naval service, who frequents opium dens and brothels; in the film, he becomes a Buddhist missionary whose initial goal is to spread the word of Buddha and peace (although he is also shown frequenting opium dens when he is depressed). Even at his lowest point, he still prevents his gambling companions from fighting.

Literary critic Edward Wagenknecht places &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; thematically among the works of Shakespeare and the ancient Greek dramatists, “who wrought their material out of sordid material.”

==The &quot;closet scene&quot;==
The most-discussed scene in &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; is Lillian Gish&#x27;s &quot;closet&quot; scene. Here Gish performs Lucy&#x27;s horror by writhing in the claustrophobic space like a tortured animal who knows there is no escape. There is more than one anecdote about the filming of the &quot;closet&quot; scene, Richard Schickel writes:
 The scene is also used to demonstrate Griffith&#x27;s uncanny ability to create an aural effect with only an image. Gish&#x27;s screams apparently attracted such a crowd outside the studio that people needed to be held back.

==Remakes==
A UK remake, also titled &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot;, followed in 1936. It was remade in Japan twice, both set in Yokohama&#x27;s Chinatown. A 1959 version was known as 戦場のなでしこ (Senjō no Nadeshiko, Nadeshiko on the Battlefield), directed by Teruo Ishii for Shintoho.

<text>Carmen Jones is a 1943 Broadway musical with music by Georges Bizet (orchestrated for Broadway by Robert Russell Bennett) and lyrics and book by Oscar Hammerstein II which was performed at The Broadway Theatre. Conceptually, it is Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot; updated to a World War II-era, African-American setting. Bizet&#x27;s opera was, in turn, based on the 1846 novella by Prosper Mérimée. The Broadway musical was produced by Billy Rose, using an all-black cast, and directed by Hassard Short. Robert Shaw prepared the choral portions of the show.

The original Broadway production starred Muriel Smith (alternating with Muriel Rahn) in the title role. The original Broadway cast members were nearly all new to the stage; Kennedy and Muir each wrote that on the first day of rehearsal only one member had ever been on a stage before this musical.

The 1954 film was adapted by Hammerstein and Harry Kleiner. It was directed by Otto Preminger and starred Dorothy Dandridge and Harry Belafonte.

The musical has been revived in London, running for a season in 1991 at Old Vic and most recently in Royal Festival Hall in the Southbank Centre in 2007.

In 2018, it was revived off-Broadway at the Classic Stage Company under the direction of John Doyle and Anika Noni Rose in the title role.

==Plot==
Parachute maker Carmen Jones makes a play for a &quot;fly boy&quot; Air Force man, Joe, who is in love with sweet Cindy Lou and about to marry her on a day pass when Carmen gets into a fight with another woman.

Joe&#x27;s pass is cancelled in order for him to drive her to the next town to be handed over to the non-military police. Instead, Carmen charms him and escapes, and he is put in the stockade for not delivering her to the authorities.

While Carmen waits for Joe to be released from military prison, she hangs around Billy Pastor&#x27;s jive cafe where she encounters boxer Husky Miller, who is instantly besotted with Carmen, calling her &quot;heatwave&quot;.

Carmen initially is uninterested, but her friends Frankie and Mert know that their invitation from Husky&#x27;s manager to see him fight in Chicago depends on Carmen&#x27;s being there, too.
Joe, having been released from the stockade, turns up at the cafe the same evening. At first, his prospects seem to be looking up, as his connections have put Joe back on track for aviator school. Carmen lays down a guilt trip, protesting that a long-distance relationship with Joe away at school just isn&#x27;t what she had in mind. He immediately gets into a fight with his sergeant, who is making a move on Carmen, as well as putting pressure on Joe. Starting the fight would have been enough to put Joe back in military prison for years, but the fight goes badly, and the sergeant ends up apparently dead. Carmen makes Joe hide the body because desertion seems better than a lengthy sentence.

The train ticket to Chicago originally given to Carmen offers them a way of avoiding the MPs. After a few days hiding in a seedy hotel with no money and no future with Joe, Carmen pays a visit to her two friends, now covered in diamonds and furs, at Husky&#x27;s training camp. She only is looking for a loan, but they try to draw her to give up Joe and &quot;go with the money&quot; by staying with Husky.

Later, at Husky&#x27;s apartment, Frankie reads Carmen&#x27;s &quot;cards&quot;, and reveals the nine of spades - the card of death. In the belief that her days are numbered, Carmen gives in to Husky&#x27;s advances, abandoning Joe for the luxurious life Husky can offer her.

Cindy Lou comes to look for Joe, but he is still in love with Carmen and spurns Cindy Lou. The night of Husky&#x27;s title fight, Joe tries to convince Carmen to return to him, but when she rejects him, he kills her, thus making the card&#x27;s prophecy a reality.

==Music==
Oscar Hammerstein II heavily adapted the libretto for Georges Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot; from the original French for his Broadway production. Arts and Entertainment Editor Elisabeth Vincentelli clarifies: &quot;The music was pretty much left intact, but Hammerstein transferred the action to World War II America. Carmen&#x27;s tobacco factory became Carmen Jones&#x27; parachute factory, bullfighter Escamillo became boxer Husky Miller, and so on. As if this weren&#x27;t enough, there also was the &#x27;small&#x27; detail of casting the show only with African-Americans...many of the show&#x27;s songs retain a surprising impact. The feverish intensity of &#x27;Beat Out dat Rhythm on a Drum&#x27;, for instance, hasn&#x27;t dimmed over the years, and the song&#x27;s been covered by a wide variety of performers, from Pearl Bailey and Marc Almond to Mandy Patinkin.&quot; The majority of the actors performing the songs in the film &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; were dubbed. Even singer Harry Belafonte was dubbed by LeVern Hutcherson, and Dorothy Dandridge was dubbed by Marilyn Horne (long before Horne became a well-known opera singer).

<doc id="73384" wikidata="Q176125" url="?curid=73384" title="Gideon">
<text>Gideon (; ) also named Jerubbaal and Jerubbesheth, was a military leader, judge and prophet whose calling and victory over the Midianites are recounted in of the Book of Judges in both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Bible.

Gideon was the son of Joash, from the Abiezrite clan in the tribe of Manasseh and lived in Ephra (Ophrah). As a leader of the Israelites, he won a decisive victory over a Midianite army despite a vast numerical disadvantage, leading a troop of 300 men.
Archaeologists in southern Israel have found a 3,100-year-old fragment of a jug with five letters written in ink that appear to represent the name Jerubbaal, or Yeruba&#x27;al.

==Names==
The nineteenth-century Strong&#x27;s Concordance derives the name &quot;Jerubbaal&quot; from &quot;Baal will contend&quot;, in accordance with the folk etymology, given in . According to biblical scholar Lester Grabbe (2007), &quot;[Judges] 6.32 gives a nonsensical etymology of his name; it means something like &#x27;Let Baal be great.

Likewise, where Strong gave the meaning &quot;hewer&quot; to the name Gideon, Biblical scholar Simon John DeVries (1975) suggests the etymology &quot;driver&quot;.

The &quot;besheth&quot; part of the name &quot;Jerubbesheth&quot; () means &quot;shame&quot;. This a pious editorialization of &quot;Baal&quot;, as is also found in the names of Saul&#x27;s son Ish-bosheth and grandson Mephibosheth.

==Biblical narrative==

As is the pattern throughout the Book of Judges, the Israelites again turned away from Yahweh after 40 years of peace brought by Deborah&#x27;s victory over Canaan; as punishment, the Midianites, Amalekites and other Bedouin peoples harried Israel for seven years.

===Calling===
God chose Gideon, a young man from the tribe of Manasseh, to free the people of Israel and to condemn their idolatry. The Angel of the Lord, or &quot;the Lord&#x27;s angelic messenger&quot; came &quot;in the character ... of a traveller who sat down in the shade [of the terebinth tree] to enjoy a little refreshment and repose&quot; and entered into conversation with Gideon. The narrative has echoes of the meeting between Abraham and the visitors who came to him in the terebinths of Mamre and promised Abraham and Sarah, in their old age, that they would have a son (). The angel greeted Gideon: &quot;The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valor!&quot;

Gideon requested proof of God&#x27;s will by three miracles: firstly a sign from the angel, in which the angel appeared to Gideon and caused fire to shoot up out of a rock, and then two signs involving a fleece, performed on consecutive nights and the exact opposite of each other. First Gideon woke up to his fleece covered in dew, but the surrounding ground dry; then the next morning, his fleece was dry but the surrounding ground covered in dew.

On God&#x27;s instruction, Gideon destroyed the town&#x27;s altar to Baal and the symbol of the Goddess Asherah beside it, receiving the byname of &quot;Jerubbaal&quot; from his father:
===Gathering an army===
Gideon then sent out messengers to gather men from the tribes of Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, as well as his own tribe of Manasseh, in order to meet an armed force of Midian and Amalek that had crossed the Jordan River. Gideon&#x27;s force encamped at En Harod, while the Midianites camped near the &quot;Hill of Moreh&quot;.

God informed Gideon that the men he had gathered were too many: with so many men, the Israelites might claim the victory as their own, rather than crediting God. God first instructed Gideon to send home those men who were afraid. Gideon invited any man who wanted to leave, to do so; 22,000 men returned home and 10,000 remained. God then told Gideon that this number was still too many, and instructed Gideon to bring the men to the water to drink. God commanded Gideon to separate those who had bowed down on their knees to drink like dogs, and those who lapped the water from their hands. Only the 300 men who had lapped the water from their cupped hands were allowed to remain.

===Night attack===

During the night, God instructed Gideon to approach the Midianite camp. There, Gideon overheard a Midianite man tell a friend of a dream in which &quot;a loaf of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian&quot;, causing their tent or camp to collapse. This was interpreted as meaning that God had given the Midianites over to Gideon. Gideon returned to the Israelite camp and gave each of his men a shofar and a clay jar with a torch hidden inside. Divided into three companies, Gideon and his 300 men marched on the enemy camp. He instructed them to blow the trumpet, give a battle cry and light torches, simulating an attack by a large force. As they did so, the Midianite army fled.

Gideon sent messengers ahead into Israel calling for the Ephraimites to pursue the retreating Midianites and two of their leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. Gideon and the three hundred pursued Zebah and Zalmunna, the two Midianite kings. When he had asked for provisions in his pursuit, the men of Succoth and Peniel refused and taunted Gideon. After capturing the two kings, Gideon punished the men of Succoth, and pulled down the tower of Peniel killing all the men there. Gideon invited his eldest son, Jether, to slay Zebah and Zalmunna, but being still young at the time, he did not have the confidence to carry out his father&#x27;s request, so Zebah and Zalmunna called on Gideon to perform the deed himself. Gideon then killed Zebah and Zalmunna as justice for the death of his brothers (). The place where Gideon slew Oreb after the defeat of the Midianites was called the &quot;Rock of Oreb&quot;. It was probably the place now called Orbo, on the east of Jordan, near Bethshean. Zeeb was killed at &quot;the wine press of Zeeb&quot;.

===Subsequent events===
The Israelites invited Gideon to become their king and to found a dynasty, but he refused, telling them that only God was their ruler.

Gideon went on to make an &quot;ephod&quot; out of the gold won in battle. This action eventually caused the whole of Israel to turn away from God yet again and the ruin of Gideon and his family. Gideon had 70 sons from the many women he took as wives. He also had a Shechemite concubine who bore him a son whom he named Abimelech, which means &quot;my father is king&quot;.

There was peace in Israel for 40 years during the life of Gideon. As soon as Gideon died of old age, the Israelites again turned to worship the false god Baal Berith and ignored the family of Gideon (). Gideon was succeeded for a brief time as ruler of Shechem by his son Abimelech.

==Rabbinic commentary==
According to Louis Ginzberg&#x27;s Midrash anthology &quot;The Legends of the Jews&quot;: &quot;Elated by the victory over Sisera, Israel sang a hymn of praise, the song of Deborah, and God, to reward them for their pious sentiments, pardoned the transgression of the people. But they soon slipped back into the old ways, and the old troubles harassed them. Their back-sliding was due to the witchcraft of a Midianite priest named Aud. He made the sun shine at midnight, and so convinced the Israelites that the idols of Midian were mightier than God, and God chastised them by delivering them into the hands of the Midianites. They worshipped their own images reflected in the water, and they were stricken with dire poverty. They could not bring so much as a meal offering, the offering of the poor. On the eve of one Passover, Gideon uttered the complaint: &quot;Where are all the wondrous works which God did for our fathers in this night, when he slew the first-born of the Egyptians, and Israel went forth from slavery with joyous hearts?&quot; God appeared unto him, and said: &quot;Thou who art courageous enough to champion Israel, thou art worthy that Israel should be saved for thy sake.&quot;

To explain why the men who brought water to their mouths with their hands were chosen to fight, while the others who lapped the water directly or bowed down were not chosen, some writers explain that lapping directly is disgraceful and similar to a dog, while bowing down resembles idolatry. Those who were faithful were allowed to depart.

According to &quot;The Legends of the Jews&quot;: &quot;..In the high priest&#x27;s breastplate, Joseph was represented among the twelve tribes by Ephraim alone, not by Manasseh, too. To wipe out this slight upon his own tribe, Gideon made an ephod bearing the name of Manasseh. He consecrated it to God, but after his death homage was paid to it as an idol. In those days the Israelites were so addicted to the worship of Beelzebub that they constantly carried small images of this god with them in their pockets, and every now and then they were in the habit of bringing the image forth and kissing it fervently. Of such idolaters were the vain and light fellows who helped Abimelech, the son of Gideon by his concubine from Shechem, to assassinate the other sons of his father. But God is just. As Abimelech murdered his brothers upon a stone, so Abimelech himself met his death through a millstone. It was proper, then, that Jotham, in his parable, should compare Abimelech to a thorn-bush, while he characterized his predecessors, Othniel, Deborah, and Gideon, as an olive-tree, or a fig-tree, or a vine. This Jotham, the youngest of the sons of Gideon, was more than a teller of parables. He knew then that long afterward the Samaritans would claim sanctity for Mount Gerizim, on account of the blessing pronounced from it upon the tribe. For this reason he chose Gerizim from which to hurl his curse upon Shechem and it inhabitants.&quot;&quot;Tan B 1 103. The parable of Jotham is said to refer to the prominent judges: Othniel [=Olive tree], Deborah [=fig tree], Gideon [=vine], and Elimelech [=bramble]. Tan. also states that Abimelech reigned for three years, as a reward for the modesty of his father Gideon, who in a &quot;tripartite&quot; sentence refused the royal crown offered him by his people; see Jud. 8.23. Abimelech, in contrast to his father [Jud.8.27], was very greedy for riches, and his end therefore came speedily; Aggadat Bereshit 26, 54., see also ibid., 52-53 where Abimelech wickedness and greed was contrasted with the piety and liberality of his namesake Abimelech, the King of Getar. The ingratitude of the Israelites who permitted Abimelech to murder the children of their benefactor Gideon was counted unto them as though they had forsaken God; ingratitude is as grave a sin as idolatry; Yelammedenu in Yalkut II, 64.&quot;

==Textual history==
In the early twentieth century, the text of Judges 6–8 was regarded by the &quot;critical school&quot; as a composite narrative, combining Jahwist, Elohist and Deuteronomic sources, with further interpolations and editorial comments of the Second Temple period. According to this approach, the D source or (D) material has an overwhelming presence in Judges 6–8. The earlier source material used is present. However, the message and theological view has the style of the Deuteronomistic school of Authors. The core (Jahwist) narrative consists of Gideon wishing to avenge the death of his brothers, gathering 300 men of his own clan and pursuing the Midianite chiefs Zebah and Zalmunna, slaying them and consecrating an idol (&quot;ephod&quot;) made from the spoils of war, which makes his city of Ophrah the seat of an oracle and giving Gideon himself the status of a rich chief with a large harem (Judges 8:4–10a, 11–21, 24–27a, 29–32).

However, other scholars see the story as a single narrative, whose author made allusions to various Pentateuchal passages that he was familiar with. The story also contains consistent thematic elements which suggest a unified composition.

Emil G. Hirsch alleged a historical nucleus in the narrative, reflecting the struggle of the tribe of Manasseh with hostile Bedouins across the Jordan, along with &quot;reminiscences of tribal jealousies on the part of Ephraim&quot; in the early period of Hebrew settlement, later conflated with the religious context of connecting Yahweh with the shrine at Ophrah.

G. A. Cooke, writing in the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges notes the discontinuity between Ephraimite anger towards Gideon shown in and the proposition of kingship over [all] Israel, and therefore concludes that &quot;these verses appear to come from a [secondary] source&quot;.

According to Yairah Amit, Mark S. Smith, and Simon John De Vries, the use of both names &quot;Gideon&quot; and &quot;Jerubbaal&quot; reflects two originally independent sets of stories combined by an editor who wishes them to be seen as referring to a single character. The name Jerubbaal given to Gideon is originally a theophoric name meaning &quot;Baal strives&quot;, but it was later given the interpretation of &quot;let Baal strive against him&quot; in order to avoid conflict with the more rigorous development of the religion of Yahweh in later centuries.

==Christian reception==
In the New Testament, Gideon is mentioned in chapter 11 of the Epistle to the Hebrews as an example of a man of faith, one of several &quot;heroes of faith&quot; mentioned there:

Gideon is regarded as a saint by the Eastern Orthodox Church and Catholic Church. He is also commemorated, together with the other righteous figures of the Old Testament, on the Sunday before Christmas (Fourth Sunday of Advent). He is commemorated as one of the Saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on July 30, and in the Roman Martyrology on September 26.

In the Protestant Reformation, the Gideon narrative was employed in polemics against the Catholic clergy. Hans von Rüte&#x27;s &quot;Gideon&quot; (1540) compares the removal of saints&#x27; relics from churches to Gideon&#x27;s destruction of Baal&#x27;s altar.

Gideons International is an American organization dedicated to Christian evangelism, founded in 1899, dedicated to the distribution of free Bibles. The organization&#x27;s logo represents a two-handled pitcher and torch, symbolizing the implements used by Gideon to scare the Midianite army.

==Cultural references==
The Gideons International, an evangelical Christian organization known for distributing Bibles, takes its name from Gideon:

&quot;Gideon was a man who was willing to do exactly what God wanted him to do, regardless of his own judgment as to the plans or results. Humility, faith, and obedience were his great elements of character. This is the standard that The Gideons International is trying to establish in all its members, each man to be ready to do God&#x27;s will at any time, at any place, and in any way that the Holy Spirit leads.&quot;

=== Origin of the phrase &quot;putting out a fleece&quot; ===

The origin of the phrase &quot;putting out a fleece&quot; is a reference to the story of Gideon meaning to look for a sign from God before undertaking some action or carrying out some plan.

===Military references===
Much like the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae, Gideon has become symbolic of military success of a small elite force against overwhelming numerical odds. The 12th-century &quot;Poem of Almería&quot; invokes &quot;the strength of Samson and the sword of Gideon&quot; in the context of the Reconquista of Almería led by Ponce Giraldo de Cabrera (1147). Benedikt Gletting (16th century) invokes the &quot;Sword of Gideon&quot; in a call for a pious and confident defense of the Old Swiss Confederacy against the threat of the Franco-Ottoman alliance. The Gideon narrative was invoked by Covenanter commander Archibald Strachan prior to Battle of Carbisdale (1650). The Gideon Force was a small British-led special force in the East African Campaign during World War II. El Junquito raid code-named Operation Gideon in 2018 and Operation Gideon (2020) were dissident military operations in Venezuela.

== Archaeological evidence ==
A five-letter inscription appearing to represent the name Jerubbaal (another name used in the Hebrew Bible for Gideon) was discovered on a 3100-year old fragment of a jug in Israel. According to Smithsonian Magazine, &quot;the artifact&#x27;s age lines up with the time period depicted in the Book of Judges.&quot;

<doc id="73389" wikidata="Q135569" url="?curid=73389" title="Baphetidae">
<text>Baphetidae is an extinct family of stem-tetrapods. Baphetids were large labyrinthodont predators of the Late Carboniferous period (Namurian through Westphalian) of Europe. Fragmentary remains from the Early Carboniferous of Canada have been tentatively assigned to the group. The phylogenetic relationships of baphetids is uncertain; while many studies have placed the group as a close relative of Amniota, other analyses have found Baphetidae to be a more basal clade of early stem tetrapods. Baphetids were among the first of the Carboniferous fossil tetrapods to be found and were originally described in 1850 by John William Dawson. The baphetids have been referred to the family Loxommatidae, but this group was later shown to be a junior synonym of Baphetidae, which was named earlier in 1865. Baphetids are known mainly from skulls; very little postcranial material has been found.

==Palaeobiology==
The presence of lateral lines and the long rows of needle-like teeth show that most were fish-eaters. Their development was likely amphibian, though no larval fossils are known. Their best-known characteristic was a curious, keyhole-shaped orbit formed by excavation of the lacrimal and prefrontal bones in front of the eye. It has been suggested that this space accommodated a salt gland or some kind of electrosensory organ. Perhaps the better hypothesis is that the space allowed room for the contraction of an enlarged pterygoideus muscle. In that case, this skull modification would represent an early form of skull fenestration for jaw muscles.

The skull is shallow. Unlike the better-known embolomeres, the baphetid cheek and skull roof are sutured together. There is a strongly embayed spiracular (&quot;otic&quot;) notch, but the stapes is distally broad, which seems to rule out a sensitive hearing apparatus. The palate is closed—a primitive character, but very different from the temnospondyls. The coronoids bear no teeth or denticles, while the dentary has a double tooth row.

Since the taxon is based almost exclusively on skulls, the body is very poorly known. It is often said that the body was crocodile-like, but this appears to be largely supposition. 
It is not clear whether all of the genera assigned to this group are really closely related. The traditional four genera of baphetids (&quot;Loxomma&quot;, &quot;Baphetes&quot;, &quot;Megalocephalus&quot;, and &quot;Spathicephalus&quot;) have recently been supplemented by &quot;Eucritta&quot;, a somewhat different form. It has also been suggested that &quot;Crassigyrinus&quot; may be closely related.

==Taxonomy==
Baphetids were first described by Edward Drinker Cope when he erected the family Baphetidae in 1865 for &quot;Baphetes&quot;. Richard Lydekker named Loxomatinae in 1889 for &quot;Loxomma&quot;, which later became known as Loxommatidae. D. M. S. Watson described the group as Loxommidae in 1917. Later studies have shown &quot;Baphetes&quot; and &quot;Loxomma&quot; to be close relatives within the same family, and because Baphetidae was named before Loxommatidae, it has seniority and is the valid name of the group.

=== Phylogeny ===
Baphetids have been previously considered primitive temnospondyls and more recently batrachosaurs (reptile-like amphibia). It is likely, however, that they represent one more of a number of early Carboniferous tetrapodomorph radiations. Computer-assisted phylogenetic analyses of a data matrix using characteristics of most of the major groups of terrestrial vertebrates place the Baphetids close to the ancestry of amniotes.

With the reinterpretation of the Ichthyostegalia as aquatic forms, baphetids are good candidates for the spot of first labyrinthodont group to actually spend substantial time on land. If so, baphetids may be a rather important taxon

<doc id="73390" wikidata="Q830513" url="?curid=73390" title="Residue theorem">
<text>In complex analysis, the residue theorem, sometimes called Cauchy&#x27;s residue theorem, is a powerful tool to evaluate line integrals of analytic functions over closed curves; it can often be used to compute real integrals and infinite series as well. It generalizes the Cauchy integral theorem and Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula. The residue theorem should not be confused with special cases of the generalized Stokes&#x27; theorem; however, the latter can be used as an ingredient of its proof.

==Statement of Cauchy&#x27;s residue theorem==

The statement is as follows:

Residue theorem: Let formula_1 be a simply connected open subset of the complex plane containing a finite list of points formula_2 formula_3 and a function formula_4 holomorphic on formula_5 Letting formula_6 be a closed rectifiable curve in formula_7 and denoting the residue of formula_4 at each point formula_9 by formula_10 and the winding number of formula_6 around formula_9 by formula_13 the line integral of formula_4 around formula_6 is equal to formula_16 times the sum of residues, each counted as many times as formula_6 winds around the respective point:

formula_18

If formula_6 is a positively oriented simple closed curve, formula_20 is formula_21 if formula_9 is in the interior of formula_6 and formula_24 if not, therefore

formula_25

with the sum over those formula_9 inside 
The relationship of the residue theorem to Stokes&#x27; theorem is given by the Jordan curve theorem. The general plane curve must first be reduced to a set of simple closed curves formula_27 whose total is equivalent to formula_6 for integration purposes; this reduces the problem to finding the integral of formula_29 along a Jordan curve formula_30 with interior formula_31 The requirement that formula_4 be holomorphic on formula_33 is equivalent to the statement that the exterior derivative formula_34 on formula_5 Thus if two planar regions formula_36 and formula_37 of formula_1 enclose the same subset formula_39 of formula_40 the regions formula_41 and formula_42 lie entirely in formula_7 hence

formula_44

is well-defined and equal to zero. Consequently, the contour integral of formula_29 along formula_46 is equal to the sum of a set of integrals along paths formula_47 each enclosing an arbitrarily small region around a single formula_48 — the residues of formula_4 (up to the conventional factor formula_16 at formula_51 Summing over formula_52 we recover the final expression of the contour integral in terms of the winding numbers formula_53

In order to evaluate real integrals, the residue theorem is used in the following manner: the integrand is extended to the complex plane and its residues are computed (which is usually easy), and a part of the real axis is extended to a closed curve by attaching a half-circle in the upper or lower half-plane, forming a semicircle. The integral over this curve can then be computed using the residue theorem. Often, the half-circle part of the integral will tend towards zero as the radius of the half-circle grows, leaving only the real-axis part of the integral, the one we were originally interested in.

== Calculation of residues ==
==Examples==
===An integral along the real axis===
The integral
formula_54

arises in probability theory when calculating the characteristic function of the Cauchy distribution. It resists the techniques of elementary calculus but can be evaluated by expressing it as a limit of contour integrals.

Suppose and define the contour that goes along the real line from to and then counterclockwise along a semicircle centered at 0 from to . Take to be greater than 1, so that the imaginary unit is enclosed within the curve. Now consider the contour integral
formula_55

Since is an entire function (having no singularities at any point in the complex plane), this function has singularities only where the denominator is zero. Since , that happens only where or . Only one of those points is in the region bounded by this contour. Because is
formula_56
the residue of at is
formula_57

According to the residue theorem, then, we have
formula_58

The contour may be split into a straight part and a curved arc, so that
formula_59
and thus
formula_60

Using some estimations, we have
formula_61
and
formula_62

The estimate on the numerator follows since , and for complex numbers along the arc (which lies in the upper half-plane), the argument of lies between 0 and . So,
formula_63

Therefore,
formula_64

If then a similar argument with an arc that winds around rather than shows that

formula_65

and finally we have
formula_66

(If then the integral yields immediately to elementary calculus methods and its value is .)

===Evaluating zeta functions===
The fact that has simple poles with residue 1 at each integer can be used to compute the sum
formula_67

Consider, for example, . Let be the rectangle that is the boundary of with positive orientation, with an integer . By the residue formula,

formula_68

The left-hand side goes to zero as since formula_69 is uniformly bounded on the contour, thanks to using formula_70 on the left and right side of the contour, and so the integrand has order formula_71 over the entire contour. On the other hand,

formula_72 where the Bernoulli number formula_73

(In fact, .) Thus, the residue is . We conclude:

formula_74
which is a proof of the Basel problem.

The same argument works for all formula_75 where formula_76 is a positive integer, giving usformula_77The trick does not work when formula_78, since in this case, the residue at zero vanishes, and we obtain the useless identity formula_79.

=== Evaluating Eisenstein series ===
The same trick can be used to establish the sum of the Eisenstein series:formula_80

<doc id="73391" wikidata="Q178159" url="?curid=73391" title="Vernation">
<text>Vernation or leafing is the formation of new leaves or fronds. In plant anatomy, it is the arrangement of leaves in a bud.

In pine species, new leaves are short and encased in sheaths. Each leaf bundle consists of two to five needles. All the leaves on one section of branch grow in length together. In cabbage species, new leaves are folded over, each covered by the previous leaf.

==Name==
The term &quot;vernation&quot; is borrowed from New Latin , the act of being verdant or flourishing (). It is cognate with (Latin for &quot;spring&quot;) and (&quot;vernal&quot;).

==Circinate vernation==


Circinate vernation is the manner in which most fern fronds emerge. As the fern frond is formed, it is tightly curled so that the tender growing tip of the frond (and each subdivision of the frond) is protected within a coil. At this stage it is called a crozier (after the shepherd&#x27;s crook) or fiddlehead (after the scrollwork at the top of a violin). As the lower parts of the frond expand and toughen up, they begin to photosynthesize, supporting the further growth and expansion of the frond. By photosynthesizing, the frond increases the amount of solute inside the frond, which lowers the internal water gradient and facilitates an increase in volume that forces uncoiling. In the case of many fronds, long hairs or scales provide additional protection to the growing tips before they are fully uncoiled. Circinate vernation may also be observed in the extension of leaflets, in the compound leaves of cycads. Circinate vernation is also typical of the carnivorous plant family Droseraceae, for example see this photo of  &quot;Drosera filiformis&quot;. It is also seen in the related genera &quot;Drosophyllum&quot; and &quot;Triphyophyllum&quot;, and in the much more distantly related &quot;Byblis&quot;; however in these three genera, the leaves are coiled &quot;outwards&quot; towards the abaxial surface of the leaf (reverse circinate vernation): this appears to be unique to these three plants among the angiosperms. 

==Convolute vernation==

The process of convolute vernation involves the wrapping of one margin of the leaf&#x27;s blade over the other. This folding mechanism makes the emerging leaf look like a tube. 

==Involute vernation==

In involute vernation both margins on opposing sides of the leaf are rolled up towards the upper (axial) surface of the leaf, forming two tubes that may meet at the midrib of the leaf.

==Revolute vernation==
Revolute vernation is the opposite of involute vernation: the margins of the leaf are rolled up towards the under (abaxial) surface of the leaf.

<doc id="73392" wikidata="Q3240551" url="?curid=73392" title="Chan Is Missing">
<text>Chan Is Missing is a 1982 American independent comedy-drama film directed, co-written, produced and edited by Wayne Wang. It is his solo directorial debut. The film, which is shot in black-and-white, is plotted as a mystery with noir undertones, and its title is a play on the Charlie Chan film series, which focuses on a fictional Chinese immigrant detective in Honolulu. It is widely recognized as the first Asian-American feature narrative film to gain both theatrical distribution and critical acclaim outside of the Asian American community.

&quot;Chan Is Missing&quot; turns the Charlie Chan detective trope on its head by making &quot;Chan&quot; the missing person that the film&#x27;s two protagonists, Jo (Wood Moy) and Steve (Marc Hayashi), search for. In the process of trying to locate Chan, a fractured, even contradictory portrait of him emerges, mirroring the complexities of the polyglot Chinese American community that Chan&#x27;s character allegorizes.

In 1995, &quot;Chan Is Missing&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Jo is a taxi driver in Chinatown, San Francisco who, with his nephew Steve, is seeking to purchase a cab license. Jo&#x27;s friend Chan Hung was the go-between for the transaction but has disappeared, taking Jo&#x27;s money. The two men search for Chan by speaking with various Chinatown locals, each of whom has a different impression of Chan&#x27;s personality and motivations. The portrait that is created is incomplete and, at times, contradictory.

As the mystery behind Chan&#x27;s disappearance deepens, Jo becomes paranoid that Chan may be involved in the death of a man killed during a &quot;flag-waving incident&quot; between opposing supporters of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (mainland China) and the Republic of China (Taiwan).

In the end, Chan remains missing but, through his daughter, returns Jo and Steve&#x27;s money. Jo, holding a photo of Chan where his face is completely obscured, eventually accepts that Chan is an enigma, saying in a voiceover, &quot;here&#x27;s a picture of Chan Hung but I still can&#x27;t see him.&quot;

== Cast ==


==Themes and analysis==
Chinese America and absence

The absence, ambiguity, and lack of definite character in the film are central themes in &quot;Chan Is Missing&quot;, and reflect how the film takes on the challenge of being an early Chinese/Asian American feature narrative. &quot;Chan Is Missing&quot; is able to use the absence of Chan to fill that space with a series of a broad and complicated portrait of San Francisco&#x27;s Chinese American community. According to Diane Mei Lin Mark, who wrote the framing essay for the movie&#x27;s published screenplay, &quot;this very presentation of diversity among Chinese American characters in a film is a concept largely untested in American movies.&quot; The diversity is addressed in the film in at least two ways. First, there is Chan himself, who every character seems to have a different impression of. In a voiceover monologue at the end of the film, Jo explains, &quot;Steve thinks that Chan Hung is slow-witted, but sly when it comes to money. Jenny thinks that her father is honest and trustworthy. Mrs. Chan thinks her husband is a failure because he isn&#x27;t rich. Amy thinks he&#x27;s a hard-headed political activist...Presco thinks he&#x27;s an eccentric who likes mariachi music.&quot; Chan, it would seem, is meant to stand in for the Chinese American community as a whole.

Second, there is also an eclectic cast of other Chinese American characters that Steve and Jo encounter while looking for Chan. That includes Henry, the cook, who wears a Samurai Night Fever T-shirt while singing &quot;Fry Me to the Moon&quot; as he stir-fries in the kitchen. Both Chan and the film&#x27;s characters suggest that Chinese America, is also impossible to easily summarize or characterize.

Film scholar Peter Feng suggests that &quot;Chan Is Missing&quot; can be understood via the metaphor of a doughnut: &quot;Each character...holds a doughnut that contains the possibilities of for Chinese American identity in its center. Each of the film&#x27;s characters only serve to widen that hole, thus widening the space for spectatorial subjectivity and by extension, Asian American subjectivity.&quot;
Sound and language

Sound is strategically deployed throughout the film to enhance the atmosphere. As Jo begins to suspect that Chan might be involved in a murder cover-up, Jo&#x27;s paranoia is echoed through an explicitly ominous score. There is also a scene where Jo and Steve go to the Manilatown Center, and during their conversation with a Center employee (Presco), the camera moves from the men to focusing on a loudspeaker and loud, ambient noise in the scene obscures their conversation. This un-joining of the speaker and subject leaves the viewer disoriented, which only adds to the general mystery of the film and its plot. A similar scene happens when Jo speaks with Chan&#x27;s wife and her home and loud music is also used to obscure their conversation.

In the original theatrical version of &quot;Chan Is Missing&quot;, there are no subtitles provided for scenes where characters are either speaking in Mandarin or Cantonese. This is a common technique in Wang&#x27;s film. As he told an interviewer regarding his 2008 film, &quot;A Thousand Years of Good Prayers&quot;, &quot;I didn’t want subtitles because the audience should experience what those two are experiencing and not have any more information. Yet you could still understand. Sometimes the specifics of a language are not as important as the music of the language and the body language of the language.&#x27;

==Release==
Wayne Wang&#x27;s primary distribution goal was to have the film, &quot;play at festivals and college campuses&quot;, and as one of the first Asian American feature films, audience reactions to it spanned a spectrum of responses, sometimes dependent on the ethnicity of the viewer. One Chinese American viewer claimed the movie was written for a white audience because &quot;…there being so much explaining, so many footnotes...&quot; says Lem. Also according to Sterrit we see that &quot;…its initial audience has not been an ethnic one, Chinese viewers are being wooed through newspaper ads…&quot; Furthermore, the Asians were ‘wooed’ to watch the film by the white reviewers who reviewed the movie in the Asian press, therefore raising questions about whom the film catered to. Peter X Feng believes the success of this movie was through &quot;the art-house audiences and brought the Asian Americans into the theaters.&quot; He also states that &quot;reviews in the Asian American press often simply advertise the screenings; but the lengthier reviews usually refer to how white reviewers see Chinese Americans and how Asian American texts are received by non-Asian audiences.&quot;

Wang arranged for the film to be screened at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) where it premiered as part of the New Directors/New Films series on April 24, 1982.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Chan is Missing&quot; is highly acclaimed. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 49 reviews with the consensus: &quot;An entertaining mystery that&#x27;s also rich in setting and character detail, &quot;Chan is Missing&quot; suggests thrilling potential from director/co-writer Wayne Wang.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote that the film is &quot;whimsical treasure of a film that gives us a real feeling for the people of San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown&quot; and it &quot;has already become something of a legend because of the way it was filmed&quot; that it demonstrates a &quot;warm, low-key, affectionate and funny look at some real Chinese-Americans&quot; and went to say &quot;almost without realizing it, we are taken beyond the plot into the everyday lives of these people.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said in his review that &quot;Chan Is Missing is not only an appreciation of a way of life that few of us know anything about; it&#x27;s a revelation of a marvelous, completely secure new talent.&quot;

A review by Dennis Schwartz stated that, &quot;It&#x27;s breezy and warmly done, a low-key comedy that takes you into an ethnic group that has rarely been captured on film in such a revealing way. A true Indy film, and a delight.&quot;

The film won &#x27;Best Experimental/Independent Film&#x27; at the 1982 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards.

==Preservation==
In 1995, &quot;Chan Is Missing&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>The Cheat is a 1915 American silent drama film directed by Cecil B. DeMille, starring Fannie Ward, Sessue Hayakawa, and Jack Dean, Ward&#x27;s real-life husband.

==Plot==
Edith Hardy is a spoiled society woman who continues to buy expensive clothes even when her husband, Richard, tells her all his money is sunk into a stock speculation and he can&#x27;t pay her bills until the stock goes up. She even delays paying her maid her wages, and the embarrassed Richard must do so. Edith is also the treasurer of the local Red Cross fund drive for Belgian refugees, which holds a gala dance at the home of Hishuru Tori, a rich Japanese ivory merchant (or, in the 1918 re-release, Haka Arakau, a rich Burmese ivory merchant). He is an elegant and dangerously sexy man, to whom Edith seems somewhat drawn; he shows her his roomful of treasures, and stamps one of them with a heated brand to show that it belongs to him.

A society friend of the Hardys tells Edith that Richard&#x27;s speculation will not be profitable and he knows a better one; he then offers to double her money in one day if she gives it to him to invest in the suggested enterprise. Edith, wanting to live lavishly and unwilling to wait for Richard to realize his speculation, takes the $10,000 the Red Cross has raised from her bedroom safe and gives it to the society friend.

The next day, however, her horrified friend tells her his tip was worthless and her money is completely lost. The Red Cross ladies have scheduled the handover of the money to the refugee fund for the day after that. Edith goes to Tori/Arakau to beg for a loan of the money, and he agrees to write her a check in return for her sexual favours the next day. She reluctantly agrees to this, takes his check and is able to give the money to the Red Cross. Then Richard announces elatedly that his investments have paid off and they are very rich. Edith asks him for $10,000, saying it is for a bridge debt, and he writes her a check for the amount with no reproof.

She takes it to Tori/Arakau, but he says she cannot buy her way out of their bargain. When she struggles against his advances, he takes his heated brand used to mark his possessions and brands her with it on the shoulder. In their struggle after that, she finds a gun on the floor and shoots him. She runs away just as Richard, hearing the struggle, bursts into the house. He finds the check he wrote to his wife there. Tori/Arakau is only wounded in the shoulder, not killed; when his servants call the police, Richard declares that he shot him, and Tori/Arakau does not dispute this.

Edith pleads with Tori/Arakau not to press charges, but he refuses to spare Richard. She visits Richard in his jail cell and confesses everything, and he orders her not to tell anyone else and let him take the blame. At the crowded trial, both he and Tori/Arakau, his arm in a sling, testify that he was the shooter but will not say why. The jury finds Richard guilty.

This is too much for Edith, and she rushes to the witness stand and shouts that she shot Tori/Arakau &quot;and this is my defense&quot;. She bares her shoulder and shows everyone in the courtroom the brand on her shoulder. The male spectators are infuriated and rush to the front, clearly intending to lynch Tori/Arakau. The judge protects him and manages to hold them off. He then sets aside the verdict, and the prosecutor withdraws the charges. Richard lovingly and protectively leads the chastened Edith from the courtroom.

==Production and release==
&quot;The Cheat&quot; featured art direction by Wilfred Buckland.

Upon its release, &quot;The Cheat&quot; was both a critical and commercial success. The film&#x27;s budget was $17,311. It grossed $96,389 domestically and $40,975 in the overseas market. According to Scott Eyman&#x27;s &quot;Empire of Dreams: The Epic Life of Cecil B. DeMille&quot;, the film cost $16,540 to make, and grossed $137,364.

Upon its release, the character of Hishuru Tori was described as a Japanese ivory merchant. Japanese Americans protested against the film for portraying a Japanese person as sinister. In particular, a Japanese newspaper in Los Angeles, &quot;Rafu Shimpo&quot;, waged a campaign against the film and heavily criticized Hayakawa&#x27;s appearance. When the film was re-released in 1918, the character of Hishuru was renamed &quot;Haka Arakau&quot; and described in the title cards as a &quot;Burmese ivory king&quot;. The change of the character&#x27;s name and nationality were done because Japan was an American ally at the time. Robert Birchard, author of the book &quot;Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;, surmised that the character&#x27;s nationality was changed to Burmese because there were &quot;not enough Burmese in the country to raise a credible protest.&quot; Despite the changes, the film was banned in the United Kingdom and was never released in Japan.

The film inspired French film critics to coin the term &quot;photogenie&quot; to specify cinema&#x27;s medium-specific qualities and was filmed with innovative usage of lighting that helped raise awareness of film as a serious art form.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Moving Picture World&quot; gave it a glowing review: Space bids me be brief. I cannot, however, omit words of unqualified praise for Fanny Ward, whose impersonation of the social butterfly with the singed wings was a masterly performance. The lighting effects must be mentioned, too. They are beyond all praise in their art, their daring and their originality. There are those deft and subtle touches that we find all the Lasky pictures possess--only here they crowd upon one another. What a delicate but powerful effect was the omission of the bars in the prison scene. The shadow of the bars, the sombre light, the bent head of the prisoner silhouetted against the bare wall--this is but one of the numerous happy touches. &quot;The Cheat&quot; is worth advertising to the limit. It is one feature in a hundred.

==Accolades==
The film was nominated for the American Film Institute&#x27;s 2001 list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills. It was also nominated in the 2007 AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) list.

==Remakes and adaptations==
The film was remade in 1923, with George Fitzmaurice as director and Pola Negri and Jack Holt starring. In 1931, Paramount again remade &quot;The Cheat&quot;, with Broadway mogul George Abbott as director and starring Tallulah Bankhead.

&quot;The Cheat&quot; was also remade in France as &quot;Forfaiture&quot; (1937) directed by Marcel L&#x27;Herbier. This version, however, makes significant changes to the original story, even though Hayakawa was cast once again as the sexually predatory Asian man.

An operatic adaptation of the story, &quot;La Forfaiture&quot;, with music by Camille Erlanger and a libretto by André de Lorde and Paul Milliet, premiered at the Opéra-Comique in 1921. The first opera to be based on a film scenario, it was not a success, playing only three times.

==Preservation and availability==
In 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

Copies of &quot;The Cheat&quot; are held by: 
* George Eastman House on 35 mm movie film. This surviving version is the 1918 re-release footage which includes changes to the Hishuru Tori character.
* Cinematheque Royale de Belgique
* Cineteca Del Friuli in Gemona on 16 mm film
* Library of Congress on 35 mm film and Laserdisc
* British Film Institute
* UCLA Film and Television Archive on 35 mm film and video
* Academy Film Archive on video
* Harvard Film Archive on 35 mm film

&quot;The Cheat&quot;, which is now in public domain, was released on DVD in 2002 with another DeMille film &quot;Manslaughter&quot; (1922) by Kino International.

<text>City Lights is a 1931 American synchronized sound romantic comedy-drama film written, produced, directed by, and starring Charlie Chaplin. While the film has no audible dialog, it was released with a synchronized musical score with sound effects. The story follows the misadventures of Chaplin&#x27;s Tramp as he falls in love with a blind woman (Virginia Cherrill) and develops a turbulent friendship with an alcoholic millionaire (Harry Myers).

Although talking pictures (or films with recorded dialogue) were on the rise when Chaplin started developing the script in 1928, he decided to continue working without dialogue only incorporating sound with the use of a synchronized musical score with sound effects. Filming started in December 1928 and ended in September 1930. &quot;City Lights&quot; marked the first time Chaplin composed the film score to one of his productions and it was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston. The main theme, used as a leitmotif for the blind flower girl, is the song &quot;La Violetera&quot; (&quot;Who&#x27;ll Buy my Violets&quot;) from Spanish composer José Padilla. Chaplin lost a lawsuit to Padilla for not crediting him.

&quot;City Lights&quot; was immediately successful upon release on March 7, 1931, with positive reviews and worldwide rentals of more than $4 million. Today, many critics consider it not only the highest accomplishment of Chaplin&#x27;s career, but one of the greatest films of all time. Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance believes &quot;&quot;City Lights&quot; is not only Charles Chaplin&#x27;s masterpiece; it is an act of defiance&quot; as it premiered four years into the era of sound films which began with the premiere of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927). In 1991, the Library of Congress selected &quot;City Lights&quot; for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked it 11th on its list of the best American films ever made. In 1949, the critic James Agee called the film&#x27;s final scene &quot;the greatest single piece of acting ever committed to celluloid&quot;.

==Plot==
The unveiling of a new monument to &quot;Peace and Prosperity&quot; reveals the Little Tramp asleep in the lap of one of the sculpted figures. He escapes the assembly&#x27;s fury and roams the city.

The Tramp encounters a flower girl on a street corner. He is instantly smitten and realizes she is blind while buying a flower from her. The woman mistakes him for a wealthy man when the door of an automobile slams shut as he departs.

That evening, the Tramp saves a drunken millionaire from suicide. The millionaire takes the Tramp, his new best friend, back to his mansion for champagne, then to a party. After helping the millionaire home the next morning, he sees the flower girl en route to her street corner. He gets some money from the millionaire, buys all her flowers and drives her home in the millionaire&#x27;s car. After the Tramp leaves, the flower girl tells her grandmother about her kind, wealthy friend. Meanwhile, the Tramp returns to the mansion, where the millionairenow soberdoes not remember him and throws him out. Later that day, the millionaire is once again intoxicated and, seeing the Tramp on the street, invites him home for a lavish party. However, the millionaire is sober again the next morning and again kicks the Tramp out.

Finding that the woman is not at her usual corner, the Tramp goes to her apartment and overhears a doctor telling the grandmother that she has a fever. Determined to help, the Tramp takes a job as a street sweeper. On his lunch break, he brings her groceries. To entertain her, he reads a newspaper aloud, including a story about a Viennese doctor&#x27;s blindness cure. &quot;Wonderful, then I&#x27;ll be able to see you,&quot; says the woman. He also finds an eviction notice the woman&#x27;s grandmother has hidden. As he leaves, he pledges to pay the rent.

The Tramp is fired for frequently being late. A boxer convinces him to fight in a fake match and split the prize money. However, the boxer is replaced at the last minute by a no-nonsense fighter who knocks the Tramp out despite the Tramp&#x27;s nimble evasions.

The Tramp encounters the drunken millionaire again and is invited to the mansion. He relates the flower girl&#x27;s plight and receives money for her operation. Burglars knock the millionaire out and take the rest of his money. The police find the Tramp with the money given to him by the millionaire, who, because of the knock on the head, does not remember giving it. The Tramp evades the police long enough to give the money to the flower girl, telling her he will be going away for a time; he is arrested and imprisoned.

When the Tramp is released months later, he goes to the flower girl&#x27;s customary street corner but does not find her. The womanher sight restorednow runs a busy flower shop with her grandmother. However, she still remembers the mysterious benefactor, who she mistakes for a young customer. The Tramp happens by the shop, where the woman is arranging flowers in the window. He stoops to pick up a discarded flower and turns to the shop&#x27;s window. He suddenly sees the woman, who has been watching him. At the sight of her, he momentarily freezes, but then breaks into a broad smile. The woman giggles to her employee, &quot;I&#x27;ve made a conquest!&quot; She offers him a fresh flower and a coin. Suddenly embarrassed, the Tramp begins to shuffle away, but the woman again offers the flower, which the Tramp shyly accepts. She takes his hand and presses the coin into it, then abruptly stops as she recognizes the touch of his hand. She runs her fingers along his arm and shoulder, then gasps, &quot;You?&quot; The Tramp nods and asks, &quot;You can see now?&quot; She replies, &quot;Yes, I can see now&quot;, and presses his hand to her heart with a tearful smile. Relieved and elated, the Tramp smiles back.

==Production==

===Pre-production===

Chaplin&#x27;s feature &quot;The Circus&quot;, released in 1928, was his last film before the motion picture industry embraced sound recording and brought the silent movie era to a close. As his own producer and distributor (part owner of United Artists), Chaplin could still conceive &quot;City Lights&quot; as a silent film. Technically the film was a crossover, as its soundtrack had synchronized music and sound effects but no spoken dialogue. The dialogue was presented on intertitles. Chaplin was first contacted by inventor Eugene Augustin Lauste in 1918 about making a sound film, but he never ended up meeting with Lauste. Chaplin was dismissive about &quot;talkies&quot; and told a reporter that he would &quot;give the talkies three years, that&#x27;s all.&quot; He was also concerned about how to adjust the Little Tramp to sound films.

In early 1928, Chaplin began writing the script with Harry Carr. The plot gradually grew from an initial concept Chaplin had considered after the success of &quot;The Circus&quot;, where a circus clown goes blind and has to conceal his handicap from his young daughter by pretending that his inability to see is an on-going series of pratfalls. This inspired the Blind Girl. The first scenes Chaplin thought up were of the ending, where the newly cured blind girl sees the Little Tramp for the first time. A highly detailed description of the scene was written, as Chaplin considered it to be the center of the entire film.

For a subplot, Chaplin first considered a character even lower on the social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short &quot;The Idle Class&quot;. The millionaire plot was based on an old idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he woke up, the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is the Tramp&#x27;s friend when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.

Chaplin officially began pre-production of the film in May 1928 and hired Australian art director Henry Clive to design the sets that summer. Chaplin eventually cast Clive in the role of the millionaire. Although the film was originally set in Paris, the art direction is inspired by a mix of several cities. Robert Sherwood said that &quot;it is a weird city, with confusing resemblances to London, Los Angeles, Naples, Paris, Tangiers and Council Bluffs. It is no city on earth and it is all cities.&quot;

On August 28, 1928, Chaplin&#x27;s mother Hannah Chaplin died at the age of 63. Chaplin was distraught for several weeks and pre-production did not resume until mid fall of 1928. Psychologist Stephen Weissman has hypothesized that &quot;City Lights&quot; is highly autobiographical, with the blind girl representing Chaplin&#x27;s mother, while the drunken millionaire represents Chaplin&#x27;s father. Weissman also compared many of the film&#x27;s sets with locations from Chaplin&#x27;s real childhood, such as the statue in the opening scene resembling St. Mark&#x27;s Church on Kennington Park Road and Chaplin referring to the waterfront set as the Thames Embankment.

Chaplin had interviewed several actresses to play the blind flower girl but was unimpressed with them all. While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. Cherrill waved and asked if she would ever get the chance to work with him. After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin eventually invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness, and Cherrill signed a contract on November 1, 1928.

===Principal photography===
Filming for &quot;City Lights&quot; officially began on December 27, 1928, after Chaplin and Carr had worked on the script for almost an entire year. On the set, Chaplin was noted for doing many more &quot;takes&quot; than other directors at the time. Production began with the first scene at the flower stand where the Little Tramp first meets the Blind Flower Girl. The scene took weeks to shoot, and Chaplin first began to have second thoughts about casting Cherrill. Years later, Cherrill said, &quot;I never liked Charlie and he never liked me.&quot; In his autobiography, Chaplin took responsibility for his on-set tensions with Cherrill, blaming the stress of making the film for the conflict. &quot;I had worked myself into a neurotic state of wanting perfection&quot;, he remembered. Filming the scene continued until February 1929 and again for ten days in early April before Chaplin put the scene aside to be filmed later. He then shot the opening scene of the Little Tramp waking up in a newly unveiled public statue. This scene involved up to 380 extras and was especially stressful for Chaplin to shoot. During this part of shooting, construction was being done at Chaplin Studios because the city of Los Angeles had decided to widen La Brea Avenue and Chaplin was forced to move several buildings away from the road.

Chaplin then shot the sequence where the Little Tramp first meets the millionaire and prevents him from committing suicide. During filming, Henry Clive suddenly decided that he did not want to jump into the tank of cold water in the scene, causing Chaplin to storm off the set and fire Clive. He was quickly replaced by Harry Myers, who Chaplin had known while under contract at Keystone Studios. Chaplin finished shooting the sequence on July 29, 1929, with exteriors at Pasadena Bridge. Chaplin then shot a sequence that was eventually cut from the film involving the Little Tramp attempting to retrieve a stick that was stuck in a grate. The scene included a young Charles Lederer; Chaplin later praised the scene, but insisted that it needed to be cut. He then continued filming the scenes with the millionaire until September 29, 1929.

In November, Chaplin began working with Cherrill again in some of the Flower Girl&#x27;s less dramatic scenes. While waiting for her scenes for several months, Cherrill had become bored and openly complained to Chaplin. During the filming of one scene, Cherrill asked Chaplin if she could leave early so that she could go to a hair appointment. Chaplin fired Virginia Cherrill and replaced her with Georgia Hale, Chaplin&#x27;s co-star in &quot;The Gold Rush&quot;. Although Chaplin liked her screen test, even he realized he had shot far too much already to reshoot all of the flower girl&#x27;s scenes. Chaplin also briefly considered sixteen-year-old actress Violet Krauth, but he was talked out of this idea by his collaborators. Chaplin finally re-hired Cherrill to finish &quot;City Lights&quot;. She demanded and got a raise to $75 per week. Approximately seven minutes of test footage of Hale survives and is included on the DVD release; excerpts were first seen in the documentary &quot;Unknown Chaplin&quot; along with an unused opening sequence.

Chaplin then cast Florence Lee as the Blind Girl&#x27;s grandmother and shot scenes with Cherrill and Lee for five weeks. In late 1929, Chaplin re-shot the first Flower Shop scene with Cherrill. This time, the scene was completed in six days and Chaplin was happy with Cherrill&#x27;s performance. Chaplin had been shooting the film for a year and was only a little more than half way finished. From March to April 1930, Chaplin shot the scenes inside of the millionaire&#x27;s house at the Town House on Wilshire Boulevard. He hired Joe Van Meter and Albert Austin, whom he had known since his days working for Fred Karno, as the burglars. In the late spring of 1930, Chaplin shot the last major comedy sequence: the boxing match. Chaplin hired Keystone actor Hank Mann to play the Tramp&#x27;s opponent. Chaplin took four days to rehearse, and then six to shoot it, between June 23 and 30. Chaplin was initially nervous over the attendance for this scene so he invited his friends to be extras. Over 100 extras were present. Chaplin&#x27;s performance in the scene was so humorous that more people arrived daily to be an extra.

In July and August, Chaplin finished up six weeks of smaller scenes, including the two scenes of the Tramp being harassed by newsboys, one of whom was played by a young Robert Parrish.

In September 1930, Chaplin finished the shooting of the iconic final scene which took six days. Chaplin said that he was happy with Cherrill&#x27;s performance in the scene, and that she had eventually understood the role. When talking about his directing style on set, Chaplin stated that &quot;everything I do is a dance. I think in terms of dance. I think more so in &quot;City Lights&quot;.&quot;

From October to December 1930, Chaplin edited the film and created the title cards. When he completed the film, silent films had become generally unpopular. But &quot;City Lights&quot; was one of the great financial and artistic successes of Chaplin&#x27;s career, and it was his personal favorite of his films. Especially fond of the final scene, he said, &quot;[I]n &quot;City Lights&quot; just the last scene ... I&#x27;m not acting ... Almost apologetic, standing outside myself and looking ... It&#x27;s a beautiful scene, beautiful, and because it isn&#x27;t over-acted.&quot;

The amount of film used for the project was uncharacteristic for the time and was a sign of the long production process. Chaplin shot 314,256 feet of film, and the completed film ran 8,093 feet. This made a shooting ratio of approximately 38.8 feet of film for each foot of film that made it in the final version.

===Music===
&quot;City Lights&quot; marked the first time Chaplin composed the film score to one of his productions. While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound, by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that &quot;I really didn&#x27;t write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it down, and I wish you would give him credit because he did a very good job. It is all simple music, you know, in keeping with my character.&quot; The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters&#x27; emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.

The main theme used as a leitmotif for the blind flower girl is the song &quot;La Violetera&quot; (&quot;Who&#x27;ll Buy my Violets&quot;) from Spanish composer José Padilla. Chaplin was unable to secure the original song performer, Raquel Meller, in the lead role, but used her song anyway as a major theme. Chaplin lost a lawsuit to Padilla (which took place in Paris, where Padilla lived) for not crediting him. Some modern editions released for video include a new recording by Carl Davis.

==Release, reception, and legacy==
Two weeks prior to the premiere, Chaplin decided to have an unpublicized preview at Los Angeles&#x27; Tower Theatre. It went poorly, attracting a small and unenthusiastic crowd. Better results were seen at the gala premiere on January 30, 1931, at the Los Angeles Theater. Albert Einstein and his wife were the guests of honor, and the film received a standing ovation. It next premiered at the George M. Cohan Theater in New York where Chaplin closely supervised the release, spending the day doing interviews, and previously spending $60,000 on the advertising, as he was frustrated with what UA&#x27;s publicists had come up with. Chaplin demanded half of the total gross, and considering audiences would be more attracted by the film itself than its technology, he demanded higher ticket prices compared to talkies.

Chaplin was nervous about the film&#x27;s reception because silent films were becoming obsolete by then, and the preview had undermined his confidence. Nevertheless, &quot;City Lights&quot; became one of Chaplin&#x27;s most financially successful and critically acclaimed works. Following the good reception by American audiences, with estimated theatrical rentals of $2 million, a quarter of which came from its 12-week run at the Cohan, Chaplin went on a sixteen-day world tour between February and March 1931, starting with a premiere at London&#x27;s Dominion Theatre on February 27. The film was enthusiastically received by Depression-era audiences, earning $4.25 million in worldwide rentals during its initial release.

Reviews were mostly positive. A film critic for the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; said that &quot;not since I reviewed the first Chaplin comedies way back in the two-reel days has Charlie given us such an orgy of laughs.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Mordaunt Hall considered it &quot;a film worked out with admirable artistry&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; declared it was &quot;not Chaplin&#x27;s best picture&quot; but that certain sequences were &quot;hilarious&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that it was &quot;on the order of his other [films], perhaps a little better than any of them&quot; and that it gave an impression &quot;not often—oh, very seldom—found in the movies; an indefinable impression perhaps best described as a quality of charm.&quot; On the other hand, Alexander Bakshy of &quot;The Nation&quot; was highly critical of &quot;City Lights&quot;, objecting to the silent format and over-sentimentality and describing it as &quot;Chaplin&#x27;s feeblest&quot;.

The popularity of &quot;City Lights&quot; endured, with the film&#x27;s re-release in 1950 again positively received by audiences and critics. In 1949, the critic James Agee wrote in &quot;Life&quot; magazine, that the final scene was the &quot;greatest single piece of acting ever committed to celluloid.&quot; Richard Meryman called the final scene one of the greatest moments in film history. Charles Silver, Curator of Film at the Museum of Modern Art, stated that the film is so highly regarded because it brought forth a new level of lyrical romanticism that had not appeared in Chaplin&#x27;s earlier works. He adds that like all romanticism, it is based in the denial of the real world around it. When the film premiered, Chaplin was much older, he was in the midst of another round of legal battles with former spouse Lita Grey, and the economic and political climate of the world had changed. Chaplin uses the Girl&#x27;s blindness to remind the Tramp of the precarious nature of romanticism in the real world, as she unknowingly assaults him multiple times. Film.com critic Eric D. Snider said that by 1931, most Hollywood filmmakers either embraced sound films, resigned themselves to their inevitability, or just gave up making movies, yet Chaplin held firm with his vision in this project. He also noted that few in Hollywood had the clout to make a silent film at that late date, let alone do it well. One reason was that Chaplin knew the Tramp could not be adapted to talking movies and still work.

Several well-known directors have praised &quot;City Lights&quot;. Orson Welles said it was his favorite film. In a 1963 interview in the American magazine &quot;Cinema&quot;, Stanley Kubrick rated &quot;City Lights&quot; as fifth among his top ten films. In 1972, the renowned Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky placed &quot;City Lights&quot; as fifth among his top ten and said of Chaplin, &quot;He is the only person to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt. The films he left behind can never grow old.&quot; The acclaimed French filmmaker Robert Bresson placed this film as first and second on his top ten films of all time. George Bernard Shaw called Chaplin &quot;the only genius to come out of the movie industry&quot;. Celebrated Italian director Federico Fellini often praised this film, and his &quot;Nights of Cabiria&quot; refers to it. In the 2003 documentary &quot;Charlie: The Life and Art of Charles Chaplin&quot;, Woody Allen said it was Chaplin&#x27;s best picture. Allen is said to have based the final scene of his 1979 film &quot;Manhattan&quot; on its final scene. Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance has summarized all the best criticism and all the notable filmmakers who have singled out &quot;City Lights&quot; as their favorite Chaplin film throughout the decades in the Criterion Collection audio commentary track for the film. Vance has written that among all the praise afforded the film can be added that &quot;City Lights also holds the distinction of being Chaplin&#x27;s own favorite of all his films.&quot;

French experimental musician and film critic Michel Chion has written an analysis of &quot;City Lights&quot;, published as &quot;Les Lumières de la ville&quot;. Slavoj Žižek used the film as a primary example in his essay &quot;Why Does a Letter Always Arrive at Its Destination?&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars out of four writing the film &quot;contains the slapstick, the pathos, the pantomime, the effortless physical coordination, the melodrama, the bawdiness, the grace, and, of course, the Little Tramp--the character said, at one time, to be the most famous image on earth.&quot; He added the film in his Great Movies list. Chaplin&#x27;s original &quot;Tramp&quot; suit from the film was donated by him to the Museum of Natural History of Los Angeles County.

&quot;City Lights&quot; was released as a dual-format Blu-ray and DVD by the Criterion Collection in 2013, both of which include trailers of the film, archival footage from production, and an audio commentary track by Chaplin biographer and scholar Jeffrey Vance, among others. The new cover was illustrated by Canadian cartoonist Seth.

<doc id="73402" wikidata="Q1065711" url="?curid=73402" title="Sullivan's Travels">
<text>Sullivan&#x27;s Travels is a 1941 American comedy film written and directed by Preston Sturges. A satire of the film industry, it follows a famous Hollywood comedy director (Joel McCrea) who, longing to make a socially relevant drama, sets out to live as a tramp to gain life experience for his forthcoming film. Along the way he unites with a poor aspiring actress (Veronica Lake) who accompanies him. The title is a reference to &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, the 1726 novel by satirist Jonathan Swift about another journey of self-discovery.

&quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; received disparate critical reception upon its release. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;the most brilliant picture yet this year&quot;, praising Sturges&#x27;s mix of escapist fun with underlying significance, and ranked it as one of the ten best films of 1941. But &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said that it lacked the &quot;down to earth quality and sincerity which made [Sturges&#x27;s] other three pictures of 1941 – &quot;The Great McGinty&quot;, &quot;The Lady Eve&quot;, and &quot;Christmas in July&quot; – &quot;a joy to behold&quot;.

Over time, the film&#x27;s reputation has improved tremendously. Media historian Hal Erickson classified it as a &quot;classic&quot;, &quot;one of the finest movies about movies ever made&quot; and a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. In 1990, &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
John L. Sullivan is a popular young Hollywood director of profitable but shallow comedies. Dissatisfied with making such films as &quot;Ants in Your Plants of 1939&quot;, he tells his studio boss, Mr. LeBrand, that he wants his next project to be a serious exploration of the plight of the downtrodden based on the novel &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; LeBrand wants him to direct another lucrative comedy instead, but Sullivan refuses. He wants to &quot;know trouble&quot; firsthand, and plans to travel as a tramp so he can make a film that truly depicts the sorrows of humanity. His British butler and valet both openly question the wisdom of his plan.

Sullivan dresses as a hobo and takes to the road, followed by staff in a bus imposed on him for his own safety by the studio. Nobody is happy with the arrangement, and Sullivan, after trying to lose the bus in a fast-paced car chase, eventually persuades his guardians to leave him alone and arranges to rendezvous with them later in Las Vegas. However, he soon returns to Los Angeles. There, in a diner, Sullivan meets a struggling young actress who has failed to make it in Hollywood and is just about to give up and go home. She believes he is a penniless tramp and buys him breakfast.

In return for her kindness, Sullivan retrieves his car from his estate and gives her a ride. He neglects to tell his servants that he has returned, so they report the car stolen. Sullivan and the girl are briefly apprehended by police, but are released after things are cleared up. He and the girl go to his palatial mansion. After seeing how wealthy he is, she shoves him into his swimming pool for deceiving her. However, when he insists on trying again, she goes with him, over his objections, disguised as a boy.

This time Sullivan succeeds. After riding in a cattle car, eating in soup kitchens and sleeping in homeless shelters with the girl (where someone steals his shoes), Sullivan finally decides he has had enough. His experiment is publicized by the studio as a huge success. The girl wants to stay with him, but Sullivan reveals to her that he is married, lovelessly, to someone else, having been advised to do so solely to reduce his taxes. Worse, the plan backfired, with Sullivan&#x27;s joint returns higher than when he was single and his wife having an affair with his business manager.

Sullivan decides to thank the homeless for the insights he has gained by handing out $5 bills. At a train yard, a man knocks Sullivan unconscious, steals his money and shoes, and dumps him in a departing boxcar. While escaping with Sullivan&#x27;s money, the thief gets run over by another train. When the mangled body is found, the ID cards sewn into the stolen shoes identify the deceased as Sullivan.

Sullivan wakes up in another city, with no memory of who he is or how he got there. A yard bull finds him and accosts him for illegally entering the rail yard. In his dazed state, Sullivan hits the man with a rock, earning himself a six-year sentence of hard labor in a work camp. He gradually regains his memory. In the camp, he attends a showing of Walt Disney&#x27;s 1934 &quot;Playful Pluto&quot; cartoon, a rare treat for the prisoners, and is surprised to find himself laughing along with the rest of them.

Unable to convince anybody either that he is Sullivan or communicate with the outside world, he comes up with a solution: after learning of his unsolved &quot;killing&quot; on the front page of an old newspaper, he confesses to being the murderer. When his picture makes the front page, he is recognized and released. His &quot;widow&quot; has married his business manager, meaning she will have to grant him a divorce or be charged with bigamy. Sullivan&#x27;s boss finally tells him he can make &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; Sullivan confesses he has changed his mind; he now wants to continue making comedies, having seen firsthand the joy they bring to the downtrodden.

==Cast==
==Themes==

The film&#x27;s primary theme is best summed up in the last line of dialogue as spoken by Sullivan: &quot;There&#x27;s a lot to be said for making people laugh. Did you know that&#x27;s all some people have? It isn&#x27;t much, but it&#x27;s better than nothing in this cockeyed caravan.&quot;

The scene in which the prisoners are taken to watch the 1934 Disney cartoon &quot;Playful Pluto&quot; takes place in a Southern black church; the film treats the African-American characters there with a level of respect unusual in films of the period. The Secretary of the NAACP, Walter White, wrote to Sturges:
I want to congratulate and thank you for the church sequence in &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot;. This is one of the most moving scenes I have seen in a moving picture for a long time. But I am particularly grateful to you, as are a number of my friends, both white and colored, for the dignified and decent treatment of Negroes in this scene. I was in Hollywood recently and am to return there soon for conferences with production heads, writers, directors, and actors and actresses in an effort to induce broader and more decent picturization of the Negro instead of limiting him to menial or comic roles. The sequence in &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; is a step in that direction and I want you to know how grateful we are.

==Production==
===Development===
Paramount purchased Sturges&#x27;s script for &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; for $6,000. He wrote the film as a response to the &quot;preaching&quot; he found in other comedies &quot;which seemed to have abandoned the fun in favor of the message.&quot;

The film as released opens with a dedication:To the memory of those who made us laugh: the motley mountebanks, the clowns, the buffoons, in all times and in all nations, whose efforts have lightened our burden a little, this picture is affectionately dedicated. This was originally intended to be spoken by Sullivan. Sturges wanted the film to begin with the prologue: &quot;This is the story of a man who wanted to wash an elephant. The elephant darn near ruined him.&quot; Paramount contracted with the Schlesinger Corp., who made the Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons, to make an animated main title sequence, but this was not used in the film, if it was ever actually produced.

The censors at the Hays Office had objections to the script they received. They felt that the word &quot;bum&quot; would be rejected by British censors, and warned that there should be no &quot;suggestion of sexual intimacy&quot; between Sullivan and The Girl in the scenes in which they are sleeping together at the mission.

===Casting===
Sturges wrote the film with Joel McCrea in mind, but found the female lead—Veronica Lake—through the casting process. Before Lake was cast, Barbara Stanwyck was considered, as well as Frances Farmer.

===Filming===
&quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; went into production on May 12, 1941, and wrapped on July 22. Location shooting took place in Canoga Park, San Marino, Castaic and at Lockheed Air Terminal.

Lake was six months pregnant at the beginning of production, a fact she did not disclose to Sturges until filming began. Sturges was so furious that, according to Lake, he had to be physically restrained. Sturges consulted with Lake&#x27;s doctor to see if she could perform the part, and hired former Tournament of Roses queen Cheryl Walker as Lake&#x27;s double. Costume designer Edith Head was tasked to find ways of concealing Lake&#x27;s pregnancy. Reportedly, Lake was disliked by a few of her co-stars. McCrea refused to work with her again, and subsequently turned down a lead role with her in &quot;I Married a Witch&quot;. Fredric March, who took the latter part, did not much enjoy working with Lake, either. However, McCrea got along famously with Sturges, and afterward presented him with a watch engraved &quot;for the finest direction I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; Sturges&#x27; assistant director, Anthony Mann, also was influenced heavily by his experience on the production.

There were some minor problems during filming. Sturges had wanted to use a clip from a Charlie Chaplin film for the church scene, but was turned down by Chaplin and the Disney cartoon substituted instead. Lake does parody Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;Little Tramp&quot; character earlier in the film. Also, the poverty montage was scheduled to take three hours to film, but took seven hours. The film cost $689,000 to produce, some $86,000 over budget.

==Release==
The film was given a pre-screening for critics on December 4, 1941, before premiering in Jackson, Tennessee on December 29, 1941. Its Hollywood premiere occurred on February 12, 1942, at the Los Angeles Paramount Theatre.

When the film was released, the U.S. Office of Censorship declined to approve it for export overseas during wartime, because of the &quot;long sequence showing life in a prison chain gang which is most objectionable because of the brutality and inhumanity with which the prisoners are treated.&quot; This conformed with the office&#x27;s standing policy of not exporting films that could be used for propaganda purposes by the enemy. The producers of the film declined to make suggested changes that could have altered the film&#x27;s status.

===Critical response===
&quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; was not immediately successful at the box office as were earlier Sturges films such as &quot;The Great McGinty&quot; and &quot;The Lady Eve&quot;, and received mixed critical reception. Although the review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;the most brilliant picture yet this year&quot; and praised Sturges&#x27; mix of escapist fun with underlying significance, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said that it lacked the &quot;down to earth quality and sincerity which made [Sturges&#x27;s] other three pictures a joy to behold&quot; and that &quot;Sturges...fails to heed the message that writer Sturges proves in his script. Laughter is the thing people want—not social studies.&quot; &quot;The New Yorker&quot; review said that &quot;anyone can make a mistake, Preston Sturges, even. The mistake in question is a pretentious number called &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot;.&quot; Nevertheless, the &quot;Times&quot; named it as one of the ten best films of 1941, and the National Board of Review nominated it as best picture of the year.

Over time, the reputation of the film has improved tremendously, and it is now considered a classic; at least one reviewer called it Sturges&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece&quot; and &quot;one of the finest movies about movies ever made.&quot; On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 8.7/10.

In 2020, &quot;Diabolique Magazine&quot; described Lake&#x27;s character as &quot;captivating, magical, and extremely sexy, whether sitting on McCrea&#x27;s lap in a bathrobe and combing his hair or walking along the road in a hobo overcoat ... She wasn&#x27;t great with all her dialogue but Sturges made her spit it out at rapid-fire pace and protected her limitations. It&#x27;s a performance for the ages.&quot;

<text>Civilization is a 1916 American pacifist drama film produced by Thomas H. Ince, written by C. Gardner Sullivan and Edward Sloman, and directed by Ince, Reginald Barker and Raymond B. West. The story involves a submarine commander who refuses to fire at a civilian ocean liner supposedly carrying ammunition for his country&#x27;s enemies. The film was a big-budget spectacle that was compared to both &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; and the paintings of Jean-François Millet. The film was a popular success and was credited by the Democratic National Committee with helping to re-elect Woodrow Wilson as the U.S. president in 1916. The film was one of the early movies to depict Jesus Christ as a character, leading some to criticize the depiction as in &quot;poor taste.&quot;

&quot;Civilization&quot; is sometimes viewed as one of the first anti-war films. In 1999, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Prologue==
The film opened with a lengthy prologue. In some theaters, the prologue was performed by live actors and an orchestra. It included music composed by Victor Schertzinger and depicted a peaceful country home, with hills in the distance, a stream and clouds floating peacefully through the sky. Suddenly, the boom of a cannon is heard, artillery guns belch fire, and a Zeppelin flies over the city dropping bombs. In the smoke, &quot;Civilization&quot; is depicted kneeling pleadingly at the feet of a menacing &quot;God of War.&quot; Soldiers are seen retreating before deadly gas. Against these scenes, the film&#x27;s title cards express the film&#x27;s anti-war message, concluding with the following comments:

Today, the great sorrowful eyes of this same Son of God gaze down upon blackened fields, where the mangled bodies of men are strewn as grains of wheat, upon flaming shattered hamlets and stricken firesides. As He listens to the screaming of the shells, the crashing of monstrous guns, all the ghastly symphony of the reddest war mankind has ever known, His heart must recognize the bitter truth in the statement of one of the world&#x27;s foremost educators— That in nineteen centuries Civilization has failed to accept honestly the teachings of Jesus Christ. This is an allegorical story of a war that has laughed at the world&#x27;s flaunting boast of a higher progress. It does not concern itself as to which side is in the right or wrong, but deals with those ranks which are paying, the grim penalty—the ranks of Humanity. If the awful trail of battle stretches vividly through the scenes of the narrative, it is in the hope that a shocked and appalled world may henceforth devote itself more earnestly in the cause of peace. Let our Civilization not be a mockery of our cherished ideals, but rather a synonym of that glorious work—Humanity. Dedicated to that vast, pitiful army whose tears have girdled the universe—the mothers of the dead.

==Plot==

The film opens with the outbreak of a war in the previously peaceful kingdom of Wredpryd. Count Ferdinand is the inventor of a new submarine who is assigned to command the new ship in battle. The King of Wredpryd orders the Count to sink the &quot;ProPatria&quot; (&quot;for my country&quot;), a civilian ship that is believed to be carrying munitions as well as civilian passengers. In his mind&#x27;s eye, the Count sees a vision of what would happen if he sent a torpedo crashing into the liner, and he recoils. He refuses to follow his orders, saying he is &quot;obeying orders -- from a Higher Power.&quot; Realizing his crew will carry out the orders, the Count fights with the crew and blows up his submarine, sending it to the bottom of the sea.

The Count&#x27;s soul descends into purgatory, where he encounters Jesus. Jesus announces that the Count can find redemption by returning to the living world as a voice for peace. Jesus tells the Count &quot;Peace to thee, child, for in thy love for humanity is thy redemption. In thy earthly body will I return, and with thy voice plead for peace. Much evil is being wrought in my name.&quot;

The Count returns to life and is stoned and reviled by his countrymen. He is put on trial by the king, a modern Pontius Pilate, and is sentenced to death. Five thousand women gather at the palace singing a song of peace and pleading with the king to end the war. The mothers&#x27; plea inspires the king to visit the cell of the condemned Count. The Count is found dead in his cell, and Jesus emerges from the Count&#x27;s body and takes the king on a tour of the battlefields. Jesus asks &quot;See here thy handiwork? Under thy reign, thy domain hath become a raging hell!&quot; In the film&#x27;s most famous scene, Jesus walks through the battlefields amid the carnage of war.

The signing of a peace treaty follows, and the closing scenes depicts the happiness in store for the returning soldiers.

==Production==

&quot;Civilization&quot; was a big budget spectacle from Thomas H. Ince. It was in production for nearly a year and advertised to have cost $1,000,000 to make but actually cost only $100,000 and returned $800,000.

C. Gardner Sullivan, The film&#x27;s screenwriter, said he received the inspiration for the film on Easter Sunday morning in 1915. He wrote an outline on a single piece of typewriter paper, originally calling it &quot;The Mothers of Men.&quot; Sullivan showed the outline to Ince, and Ince decided it was worth investing $1 million.

In April 1916, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote:

The next large feature looming on the horizon is the Ince photoplay, &quot;Civilization&quot;...It was nearly a year in the making, and is the most pretentious of the Ince features. Many hundreds of persons took part, and it is said that the film contains some of the most beautiful photography ever shown on the screen.

At the time of its release, it was described as &quot;the ultimate achievement of the Ince studios.&quot; 

The film included large scale battle scenes, scenes of naval battles, trench warfare, aerial battles, and the resulting devastation. Ships from the United States Navy were utilized in the scenes depicting sea battles. Advertising for the film (&quot;pictured at right&quot;) boasted of the extravagant expense incurred in presenting the spectacle:

George Fisher was given the daunting role of playing &quot;The Christ&quot; in &quot;Civilization&quot;. He was &quot;the first cinema actor to portray Christ for the screen.&quot; At the time of the film&#x27;s release, Fisher told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that, to get in the proper mood for the role, &quot;he lived the life of a recluse, spending his time in study and meditation.&quot; He expressed his hope that the film&#x27;s message would be heard:

I can say in truth that the playing of this part has affected my whole life and the impressions will never leave me. I have tried earnestly and sincerely, with a deep prayer in my heart, to bring a message to the world, one which will reach, perhaps, millions. Now my only wish is that whoever may witness the performances of &quot;Civilization&quot; will realize only the truth and beauty of the message.

The premiere was held at the Majestic Theatre in Los Angeles on April 17, 1916.

==Popular response==
The film was a popular success when it was released in 1916. The Democratic National Committee credited the film with helping to re-elect President Woodrow Wilson in 1916. After the United States&#x27;s entry into World War I, the film was pulled from distribution.

Film director Yasujirō Ozu claimed that he first decided to become a film director when watching &quot;Civilization&quot;.

==Critical reaction==
Among critics, the reaction was mixed.

===Positive reviews===
In La Crosse, Wisconsin, a newspaper reviewer called it a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and the &quot;Biggest Spectacle in History of Motion Pictures,&quot; surpassing even D.W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;:

The photoplay and the spoken drama will be united for the first time in...the million dollar masterpiece of Thomas H. Ince...&quot;Civilization&quot; is an encyclopedia of the emotions. It is inevitable to compare such a picture, epic in its scope, including battles and the upheaval of a nation, to a similar picture, Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;. Ince has excelled his predecessor in the art of suggestion. In the vivid battle scenes of &quot;Civllization&quot;, there are four suggestive flashes for every one Griffith gave us. The conception is classically correct. No theater could be conceived that would be adequate in space or speed of action to carry across to an audience what was conveyed in this film.

In Indiana, a reviewer emphasized the film&#x27;s spectacular effects and its depiction of Jesus:

&#x27;If Christ Should Visit Verdun&#x27; would make a good subtitle for &quot;Civilization&quot;, for that is really its theme...Pictorially, and in the spectacular effects that can be achieved within range of the camera, as well as in the sheer beauty of many of its scenes, it is a masterpiece indeed. Days of peace in the little town of Wrepryd, which is its locale, and in the peaceful country thereabout, might have been posed by the artist Millet, so strikingly do they stand out.

In Fairbanks, Alaska, a reviewer wrote that, if the film had been shown to the people of Europe before the war started there would have been no war:

&quot;Civilization&quot; is worth $1.50 today, tomorrow, or at any time. It is a masterpiece—a picture that grips and thrills. It preaches a powerful sermon and preaches it in a way that makes it interesting...After seeing &quot;Civilization&quot; one can truthfully say that had Henry Ford produced a film like this one that Ince directed, and sent it broadcast throughout the civilized world as an argument against war, he would have accomplished more for universal peace than did his famous &#x27;peace expedition.&#x27; He would have reached the great mass of people who have but a faint recollection of the horrors of war, and would have showed them the pain and the suffering and the sorrow that war brings with it. Had such a picture as &quot;Civilization&quot; been shown to the people of Europe before the war started there would have been no war.

===Negative reviews===
Henry Christeen Warnack in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was troubled by the depiction of The Christ and wrote that the film &quot;is not daring, it is only poor taste.&quot; He opined that it was offensive to the beliefs of Christians, Jews and atheists alike:

[T]he play will...be popular with everybody with the exception of three classes: It will probably prove offensive to Christians because they are likely to think of it as irreverent; to the Hebrew it will seem mystical and exaggerated; the non-church-goer will find it absurd and undramatic. Outside of the Christian, the Jew and the unbeliever, I haven&#x27;t the doubt of its appeal.

Warnack concluded his review as follows:

This violation of good taste and this error in judgment belong to the misconception of the story...Realizing the vast sum of money and the huge investment of talent and good faith that have been expended in this pretentious film, it is with deep regret that I am compelled to report it as a disappointment.

<doc id="73408" wikidata="Q212340" url="?curid=73408" title="To Kill a Mockingbird">
<text>To Kill a Mockingbird is a 1960 novel by American author Harper Lee. It became instantly successful after its release; in the United States, it is widely read in high schools and middle schools. &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize a year after its release, and it has become a classic of modern American literature. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee&#x27;s observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was ten.

Despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality, the novel is renowned for its warmth and humor. Atticus Finch, the narrator&#x27;s father, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. The historian Joseph Crespino explains, &quot;In the twentieth century, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its main character, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism.&quot; As a Southern Gothic novel and &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;, the primary themes of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in the Deep South. Lessons from the book emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice. Despite its themes, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets. In 2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one &quot;every adult should read before they die&quot;.

Reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication. Despite the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education, literary analysis of it is sparse. Author Mary McDonough Murphy, who collected individual impressions of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; by several authors and public figures, calls the book &quot;an astonishing phenomenon&quot;. It was adapted into an Academy Award-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan, with a screenplay by Horton Foote. Since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee&#x27;s hometown.

&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; was Lee&#x27;s only published book until &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot;, an earlier draft of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, was published on July 14, 2015. Lee continued to respond to her work&#x27;s impact until her death in February 2016. She was very guarded about her personal life, and gave her last interview to a journalist in 1964.

== Biographical background and publication ==
Born in 1926, Harper Lee grew up in the Southern town of Monroeville, Alabama, where she became a close friend of soon-to-be-famous writer Truman Capote. She attended Huntingdon College in Montgomery (1944–45), and then studied law at the University of Alabama (1945–49). While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: &quot;Huntress&quot; at Huntingdon and the humor magazine &quot;Rammer Jammer&quot; at the University of Alabama. At both colleges, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time. In 1950, Lee moved to New York City, where she worked as a reservation clerk for British Overseas Airways Corporation; there, she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in Monroeville. Hoping to be published, Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a literary agent recommended by Capote. An editor at J. B. Lippincott, who bought the manuscript, advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing.

Donations from friends allowed her to write uninterrupted for a year. After finishing the first draft and returning it to Lippincott, the manuscript, at that point titled &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot;, fell into the hands of Therese von Hohoff Torrey, known professionally as Tay Hohoff. Hohoff was impressed: &quot;[T]he spark of the true writer flashed in every line,&quot; she would later recount in a corporate history of Lippincott, but as Hohoff saw it, the manuscript was by no means fit for publication. It was, as she described it, &quot;more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel.&quot; During the following two and a half years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form.

After the &quot;Watchman&quot; title was rejected, it was re-titled &quot;Atticus&quot; but Lee renamed it &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; to reflect that the story went beyond a character portrait. The book was published on July 11, 1960. The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies. In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said,

I never expected any sort of success with &#x27;Mockingbird.&#x27; ... I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I&#x27;d expected.

Instead of a &quot;quick and merciful death&quot;, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest Condensed Books&quot; chose the book for reprinting in part, which gave it a wide readership immediately. Since the original publication, the book has never been out of print.

== Plot summary ==

The story, told by Jean Louise Finch, takes place during three years (1933–35) of the Great Depression in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, the seat of Maycomb County. Nicknamed Scout, the narrator, who is six years old at the beginning of the book, lives with her older brother Jeremy, nicknamed Jem, and their widowed father Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. They also have a black cook, Calpurnia, who has been with the family for many years and helps Atticus raise the two children.

Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Charles Baker Harris, nicknamed Dill, who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer. The three children are terrified, yet fascinated, by their neighbor, the reclusive Arthur &quot;Boo&quot; Radley. The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo, and many of them have not seen him for many years. The children feed one another&#x27;s imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house. After two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone is leaving them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place. Several times the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, he never appears in person.

Judge Taylor appoints Atticus to defend Tom Robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, Mayella Ewell. Although many of Maycomb&#x27;s citizens disapprove, Atticus agrees to defend Tom to the best of his ability. Other children taunt Jem and Scout for Atticus&#x27;s actions, calling him a &quot;nigger-lover&quot;. Scout is tempted to stand up for her father&#x27;s honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. One night, Atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching Tom. Scout, Jem, and Dill unexpectedly show up, and Scout inadvertently breaks the mob mentality by recognizing and talking to a classmate&#x27;s father, causing the would-be lynchers to disperse.

Atticus does not want Jem and Scout to be present at Tom Robinson&#x27;s trial. No seat is available on the main floor, but the Rev. Sykes, the pastor of Calpurnia&#x27;s church, invites Jem, Scout and Dill to watch from the colored balcony. Atticus establishes that Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying. It is revealed that Mayella made sexual advances toward Tom, resulting in her being beaten by her father. The townspeople refer to the Ewells as &quot;white trash&quot; who are not to be trusted, but the jury convicts Tom regardless. Jem&#x27;s faith in justice is badly shaken. Atticus is hopeful that he can get the verdict overturned, but Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison.

Despite Tom&#x27;s conviction, Bob Ewell is humiliated by the events of the trial. Atticus explains that he destroyed Ewell&#x27;s last shred of credibility. Ewell vows revenge, spitting in Atticus&#x27; face, trying to break into the judge&#x27;s house and menacing Tom Robinson&#x27;s widow. Finally, he attacks Jem and Scout while they are walking home on a dark night after a school pageant. Jem suffers a broken arm and is knocked unconscious in the struggle, but amid the confusion, someone comes to the children&#x27;s rescue. The mysterious man carries Jem home, where Scout realizes that he is Boo Radley.

Sheriff Tate arrives and discovers Ewell dead from a knife wound. Atticus believes that Jem was responsible, but Tate is certain it was Boo. The sheriff tells Atticus that, to protect Boo&#x27;s privacy, he will report that Ewell simply fell on his own knife during the attack. Boo asks Scout to walk him home. After she says goodbye to him at his front door, he disappears, never to be seen again by Scout. While standing on the Radley porch, Scout imagines life from Boo&#x27;s perspective.

== Autobiographical elements ==
Lee said that &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is not an autobiography, but rather an example of how an author &quot;should write about what he knows and write truthfully&quot;. Nevertheless, several people and events from Lee&#x27;s childhood parallel those of the fictional Scout. Amasa Coleman Lee, Lee&#x27;s father, was an attorney similar to Atticus Finch. In 1919, he defended two black men accused of murder. After they were convicted, hanged and mutilated, he never took another criminal case. Lee&#x27;s father was also the editor and publisher of the Monroeville newspaper. Although more of a proponent of racial segregation than Atticus, he gradually became more liberal in his later years. Though Scout&#x27;s mother died when she was a baby, Lee was 25 when her mother, Frances Cunningham Finch, died. Lee&#x27;s mother was prone to a nervous condition that rendered her mentally and emotionally absent.

Lee modeled the character of Dill on Truman Capote, her childhood friend known then as Truman Persons. Just as Dill lived next door to Scout during the summer, Capote lived next door to Lee with his aunts while his mother visited New York City. Like Dill, Capote had an impressive imagination and a gift for fascinating stories. Both Lee and Capote loved to read, and were atypical children in some ways: Lee was a scrappy tomboy who was quick to fight, and Capote was ridiculed for his advanced vocabulary and lisp. She and Capote made up and acted out stories they wrote on an old Underwood typewriter that Lee&#x27;s father gave them. They became good friends when both felt alienated from their peers; Capote called the two of them &quot;apart people&quot;. In 1960, Capote and Lee traveled to Kansas together to investigate the multiple murders that were the basis for Capote&#x27;s nonfiction novel &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;.

Down the street from the Lees lived a family whose house was always boarded up; they served as the models for the fictional Radleys. The son of the family got into some legal trouble and the father kept him at home for 24 years out of shame. He was hidden until virtually forgotten; he died in 1952.

The origin of Tom Robinson is less clear, although many have speculated that his character was inspired by several models. When Lee was 10 years old, a white woman near Monroeville accused a black man named Walter Lett of raping her. The story and the trial were covered by her father&#x27;s newspaper, which reported that Lett was convicted and sentenced to death. After a series of letters appeared claiming Lett had been falsely accused, his sentence was commuted to life in prison. He died there of tuberculosis in 1937. Scholars believe that Robinson&#x27;s difficulties reflect the notorious case of the Scottsboro Boys, in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on negligible evidence. However, in 2005, Lee stated that she had in mind something less sensational, although the Scottsboro case served &quot;the same purpose&quot; to display Southern prejudices. Emmett Till, a black teenager who was murdered for allegedly flirting with a white woman in Mississippi in 1955, and whose death is credited as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement, is also considered a model for Tom.

== Style ==

The strongest element of style noted by critics and reviewers is Lee&#x27;s talent for narration, which in an early review in &quot;Time&quot; was called &quot;tactile brilliance&quot;. Writing a decade later, another scholar noted, &quot;Harper Lee has a remarkable gift of story-telling. Her art is visual, and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without jolts of transition.&quot; Lee combines the narrator&#x27;s voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman&#x27;s reflecting on her childhood, using the ambiguity of this voice combined with the narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives. This narrative method allows Lee to tell a &quot;delightfully deceptive&quot; story that mixes the simplicity of childhood observation with adult situations complicated by hidden motivations and unquestioned tradition. However, at times the blending causes reviewers to question Scout&#x27;s preternatural vocabulary and depth of understanding. Both Harding LeMay and the novelist and literary critic Granville Hicks expressed doubt that children as sheltered as Scout and Jem could understand the complexities and horrors involved in the trial for Tom Robinson&#x27;s life.

Writing about Lee&#x27;s style and use of humor in a tragic story, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin states: &quot;Laughter ... [exposes] the gangrene under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it; one can hardly ... be controlled by what one is able to laugh at.&quot; Scout&#x27;s precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspired National Endowment of the Arts director David Kipen to call her &quot;hysterically funny&quot;. To address complex issues, however, Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee uses parody, satire, and irony effectively by using a child&#x27;s perspective. After Dill promises to marry her, then spends too much time with Jem, Scout reasons the best way to get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up, which she does several times. Scout&#x27;s first day in school is a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further. Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society. Satire and irony are used to such an extent that Tavernier-Courbin suggests one interpretation for the book&#x27;s title: Lee is doing the mocking—of education, the justice system, and her own society—by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval.

Critics also note the entertaining methods used to drive the plot. When Atticus is out of town, Jem locks a Sunday school classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of Shadrach. This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson&#x27;s. Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing the audience to laugh uproariously. She is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.

=== Genres ===
Scholars have characterized &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; as both a Southern Gothic and a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;. The grotesque and near-supernatural qualities of Boo Radley and his house, and the element of racial injustice involving Tom Robinson, contribute to the aura of the Gothic in the novel. Lee used the term &quot;Gothic&quot; to describe the architecture of Maycomb&#x27;s courthouse and in regard to Dill&#x27;s exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley. Outsiders are also an important element of Southern Gothic texts and Scout and Jem&#x27;s questions about the hierarchy in the town cause scholars to compare the novel to &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; and &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;. Despite challenging the town&#x27;s systems, Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above all others, because he believes that following one&#x27;s conscience is the highest priority, even when the result is social ostracism. However, scholars debate about the Southern Gothic classification, noting that Boo Radley is, in fact, human, protective, and benevolent. Furthermore, in addressing themes such as alcoholism, incest, rape, and racial violence, Lee wrote about her small town realistically rather than melodramatically. She portrays the problems of individual characters as universal underlying issues in every society.

As children coming of age, Scout and Jem face hard realities and learn from them. Lee seems to examine Jem&#x27;s sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout&#x27;s. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie the day after the trial, &quot;It&#x27;s like bein&#x27; a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon ... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that&#x27;s what they seemed like&quot;. This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, &quot;&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be.&quot;

== Themes ==
Despite the novel&#x27;s immense popularity upon publication, it has not received the close critical attention paid to other modern American classics. Don Noble, the editor of a book of essays about the novel, estimates that the ratio of sales to analytical essays may be a million to one. Christopher Metress writes that the book is &quot;an icon whose emotive sway remains strangely powerful because it also remains unexamined&quot;. Noble suggests it does not receive academic attention because of its consistent status as a best-seller (&quot;If that many people like it, it can&#x27;t be any good.&quot;) and that general readers seem to feel they do not require analytical interpretation.

Harper Lee had remained famously detached from interpreting the novel since the mid-1960s. However, she gave some insight into her themes when, in a rare letter to the editor, she wrote in response to the passionate reaction her book caused:Surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct, Christian in its ethic, that is the heritage of all Southerners.

=== Southern life and racial injustice ===

When the book was released, reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts, and opinion was mixed about Lee&#x27;s ability to connect them. The first part of the novel concerns the children&#x27;s fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood. Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem&#x27;s observations of their quirky neighbors. One writer was so impressed by Lee&#x27;s detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romantic regionalism. This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee&#x27;s representation of the Southern caste system to explain almost every character&#x27;s behavior in the novel. Scout&#x27;s Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb&#x27;s inhabitants&#x27; faults and advantages to genealogy (families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks), and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb. This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell&#x27;s apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Scout&#x27;s definition of &quot;fine folks&quot; being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have. The South itself, with its traditions and taboos, seems to drive the plot more than the characters.

The second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed &quot;the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro&quot;. In the years following its release, many reviewers considered &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it &quot;reasonable to believe&quot; that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks&#x27; refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the Montgomery bus boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980). In writing about the historical context of the novel&#x27;s construction, two other literary scholars remark: &quot;&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition.&quot;

Scholar Patrick Chura, who suggests Emmett Till was a model for Tom Robinson, enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional Tom that Till also faced. Chura notes the icon of the black rapist causing harm to the representation of the &quot;mythologized vulnerable and sacred Southern womanhood&quot;. Any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused. Tom Robinson&#x27;s trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence, as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury&#x27;s decision. Furthermore, the victim of racial injustice in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; was physically impaired, which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of, but also crippled him in other ways. Roslyn Siegel includes Tom Robinson as an example of the recurring motif among white Southern writers of the black man as &quot;stupid, pathetic, defenseless, and dependent upon the fair dealing of the whites, rather than his own intelligence to save him&quot;. Although Tom is spared from being lynched, he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison, being shot seventeen times.

The theme of racial injustice appears symbolically in the novel as well. For example, Atticus must shoot a rabid dog, even though it is not his job to do so. Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog, must fight against the town&#x27;s racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom&#x27;s trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, &quot;[t]he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson ... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury&#x27;s and the town&#x27;s anger.&quot;

=== Class ===
In a 1964 interview, Lee remarked that her aspiration was &quot;to be ... the Jane Austen of South Alabama.&quot; Both Austen and Lee challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing. When Scout embarrasses her poorer classmate, Walter Cunningham, at the Finch home one day, Calpurnia, their black cook, chastises and punishes her for doing so. Atticus respects Calpurnia&#x27;s judgment, and later in the book even stands up to his sister, the formidable Aunt Alexandra, when she strongly suggests they fire Calpurnia. One writer notes that Scout, &quot;in Austenian fashion&quot;, satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify. Literary critic Jean Blackall lists the priorities shared by the two authors: &quot;affirmation of order in society, obedience, courtesy, and respect for the individual without regard for status&quot;.

Scholars argue that Lee&#x27;s approach to class and race was more complex &quot;than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to &#x27;poor white trash&#x27; ... Lee demonstrates how issues of gender and class intensify prejudice, silence the voices that might challenge the existing order, and greatly complicate many Americans&#x27; conception of the causes of racism and segregation.&quot; Lee&#x27;s use of the middle-class narrative voice is a literary device that allows an intimacy with the reader, regardless of class or cultural background, and fosters a sense of nostalgia. Sharing Scout and Jem&#x27;s perspective, the reader is allowed to engage in relationships with the conservative antebellum Mrs. Dubose; the lower-class Ewells, and the Cunninghams who are equally poor but behave in vastly different ways; the wealthy but ostracized Mr. Dolphus Raymond; and Calpurnia and other members of the black community. The children internalize Atticus&#x27; admonition not to judge someone until they have walked around in that person&#x27;s skin, gaining a greater understanding of people&#x27;s motives and behavior.

=== Courage and compassion ===
The novel has been noted for its poignant exploration of different forms of courage. Scout&#x27;s impulsive inclination to fight students who insult Atticus reflects her attempt to stand up for him and defend him. Atticus is the moral center of the novel, however, and he teaches Jem one of the most significant lessons of courage. In a statement that both foreshadows Atticus&#x27; motivation for defending Tom Robinson and describes Mrs. Dubose, who is determined to break herself of a morphine addiction, Atticus tells Jem that courage is &quot;when you&#x27;re licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what&quot;.

Charles J. Shields, who wrote the first book-length biography of Harper Lee, offers the reason for the novel&#x27;s enduring popularity and impact is that &quot;its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal&quot;. Atticus&#x27; lesson to Scout that &quot;you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view—until you climb around in his skin and walk around in it&quot; exemplifies his compassion. She ponders the comment when listening to Mayella Ewell&#x27;s testimony. When Mayella reacts with confusion to Atticus&#x27; question if she has any friends, Scout offers that she must be lonelier than Boo Radley. Having walked Boo home after he saves their lives, Scout stands on the Radley porch and considers the events of the previous three years from Boo&#x27;s perspective. One writer remarks, &quot;... [w]hile the novel concerns tragedy and injustice, heartache and loss, it also carries with it a strong sense [of] courage, compassion, and an awareness of history to be better human beings.&quot;

=== Gender roles ===
Just as Lee explores Jem&#x27;s development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout&#x27;s primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout&#x27;s primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong-willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout&#x27;s lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus&#x27; intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, &quot;Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.&quot;

Absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel. Scout and Jem&#x27;s mother died before Scout could remember her, Mayella&#x27;s mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo&#x27;s confinement to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers. Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter, and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house to the extent that Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men, as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society, can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: &quot;It is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight.&quot;

=== Laws, written and unwritten ===
Allusions to legal issues in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, particularly in scenes outside of the courtroom, have drawn the attention of legal scholars. Claudia Durst Johnson writes that &quot;a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals&quot;. The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb reads: &quot;Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.&quot; Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem&#x27;s childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one&#x27;s palm, and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season? Many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms: Mr. Dolphus Raymond has been exiled by society for taking a black woman as his common-law wife and having interracial children; Mayella Ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing Tom Robinson; by being turned into a non-person, Boo Radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him. Scout repeatedly breaks codes and laws and reacts to her punishment for them. For example, she refuses to wear frilly clothes, saying that Aunt Alexandra&#x27;s &quot;fanatical&quot; attempts to place her in them made her feel &quot;a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on [her]&quot;. Johnson states, &quot;[t]he novel is a study of how Jem and Scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of (their) small worlds.&quot;

=== Loss of innocence ===

Songbirds and their associated symbolism appear throughout the novel. Their family name Finch is also Lee&#x27;s mother&#x27;s maiden name. The titular mockingbird is a key motif of this theme, which first appears when Atticus, having given his children air-rifles for Christmas, allows their Uncle Jack to teach them to shoot. Atticus warns them that, although they can &quot;shoot all the bluejays they want&quot;, they must remember that &quot;it&#x27;s a sin to kill a mockingbird&quot;. Confused, Scout approaches her neighbor Miss Maudie, who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures. She points out that mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs, saying, &quot;They don&#x27;t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.&quot; Writer Edwin Bruell summarized the symbolism when he wrote in 1964, &quot;&#x27;To kill a mockingbird&#x27; is to kill that which is innocent and harmless—like Tom Robinson.&quot; Scholars have noted that Lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when trying to make a moral point.

Tom Robinson is the chief example, among several in the novel, of innocents being carelessly or deliberately destroyed. However, scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley: &quot;Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun (as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history), Scout comes to see him as a &#x27;mockingbird&#x27;—that is, as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished.&quot; The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her, and, in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, states about a character who was misunderstood, &quot;when they finally saw him, why he hadn&#x27;t done any of those things ... Atticus, he was real nice,&quot; to which he responds, &quot;Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.&quot;

The novel exposes the loss of innocence so frequently that reviewer R. A. Dave claims that because every character has to face, or even suffer defeat, the book takes on elements of a classical tragedy. In exploring how each character deals with his or her own personal defeat, Lee builds a framework to judge whether the characters are heroes or fools. She guides the reader in such judgments, alternating between unabashed adoration and biting irony. Scout&#x27;s experience with the Missionary Society is an ironic juxtaposition of women who mock her, gossip, and &quot;reflect a smug, colonialist attitude toward other races&quot; while giving the &quot;appearance of gentility, piety, and morality&quot;. Conversely, when Atticus loses Tom&#x27;s case, he is last to leave the courtroom, except for his children and the black spectators in the colored balcony, who rise silently as he walks underneath them, to honor his efforts.

== Reception ==
Despite her editors&#x27; warnings that the book might not sell well, it quickly became a sensation, bringing acclaim to Lee in literary circles, in her hometown of Monroeville, and throughout Alabama. The book went through numerous subsequent printings and became widely available through its inclusion in the Book of the Month Club and editions released by &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest Condensed Books&quot;.

Initial reactions to the novel were varied. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; declared Lee &quot;a skilled, unpretentious, and totally ingenuous writer&quot;, and &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;&#x27;s reviewer rated the book &quot;pleasant, undemanding reading&quot;, but found the narrative voice—&quot;a six-year-old girl with the prose style of a well-educated adult&quot;—to be implausible. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1960 review of the book states that it &quot;teaches the reader an astonishing number of useful truths about little girls and about Southern life&quot; and calls Scout Finch &quot;the most appealing child since Carson McCullers&#x27; Frankie got left behind at the wedding&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Sunday Tribune&quot; noted the even-handed approach to the narration of the novel&#x27;s events, writing: &quot;This is in no way a sociological novel. It underlines no cause ... &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a novel of strong contemporary national significance.&quot;

Not all reviewers were enthusiastic. Some lamented the use of poor white Southerners, and one-dimensional black victims, and Granville Hicks labeled the book &quot;melodramatic and contrived&quot;. When the book was first released, Southern writer Flannery O&#x27;Connor commented, &quot;I think for a child&#x27;s book it does all right. It&#x27;s interesting that all the folks that are buying it don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re reading a child&#x27;s book. Somebody ought to say what it is.&quot; Carson McCullers apparently agreed with the &quot;Time&quot; magazine review, writing to a cousin: &quot;Well, honey, one thing we know is that she&#x27;s been poaching on my literary preserves.&quot;

One year after its publication &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; had been translated into ten languages. In the years since, it has sold more than 30 million copies and been translated into more than 40 languages. The novel has never been out of print in hardcover or paperback, and has become part of the standard literature curriculum. A 2008 survey of secondary books read by students between grades 9–12 in the U.S. indicates the novel is the most widely read book in these grades. A 1991 survey by the Book of the Month Club and the Library of Congress Center for the Book found that &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; was fourth in a list of books that are &quot;most often cited as making a difference&quot;. It is considered by some to be the &quot;Great American Novel&quot;.

The 50th anniversary of the novel&#x27;s release was met with celebrations and reflections on its impact. Eric Zorn of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; praises Lee&#x27;s &quot;rich use of language&quot; but writes that the central lesson is that &quot;courage isn&#x27;t always flashy, isn&#x27;t always enough, but is always in style&quot;. Jane Sullivan in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; agrees, stating that the book &quot;still rouses fresh and horrified indignation&quot; as it examines morality, a topic that has recently become unfashionable. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; states that Lee, rare among American novelists, writes with &quot;a fiercely progressive ink, in which there is nothing inevitable about racism and its very foundation is open to question&quot;, comparing her to William Faulkner, who wrote about racism as an inevitability. Literary critic Rosemary Goring in Scotland&#x27;s &quot;The Herald&quot; notes the connections between Lee and Jane Austen, stating the book&#x27;s central theme, that &quot;one&#x27;s moral convictions are worth fighting for, even at the risk of being reviled&quot; is eloquently discussed.

Native Alabamian sports writer Allen Barra sharply criticized Lee and the novel in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; calling Atticus a &quot;repository of cracker-barrel epigrams&quot; and the novel represents a &quot;sugar-coated myth&quot; of Alabama history. Barra writes, &quot;It&#x27;s time to stop pretending that &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is some kind of timeless classic that ranks with the great works of American literature. Its bloodless liberal humanism is sadly dated&quot;. Thomas Mallon in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; criticizes Atticus&#x27; stiff and self-righteous demeanor, and calls Scout &quot;a kind of highly constructed doll&quot; whose speech and actions are improbable. Although acknowledging that the novel works, Mallon blasts Lee&#x27;s &quot;wildly unstable&quot; narrative voice for developing a story about a content neighborhood until it begins to impart morals in the courtroom drama, following with his observation that &quot;the book has begun to cherish its own goodness&quot; by the time the case is over. Defending the book, Akin Ajayi writes that justice &quot;is often complicated, but must always be founded upon the notion of equality and fairness for all.&quot; Ajayi states that the book forces readers to question issues about race, class, and society, but that it was not written to resolve them.

Many writers compare their perceptions of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; as adults with when they first read it as children. Mary McDonagh Murphy interviewed celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Rosanne Cash, Tom Brokaw, and Harper&#x27;s sister Alice Lee, who read the novel and compiled their impressions of it as children and adults into a book titled &quot;Scout, Atticus, and Boo&quot;.

The New York Times announced &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; as the best book of the past 125 years on December 28, 2021.

=== Atticus Finch and the legal profession ===

One of the most significant impacts &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; has had is Atticus Finch&#x27;s model of integrity for the legal profession. As scholar Alice Petry explains, &quot;Atticus has become something of a folk hero in legal circles and is treated almost as if he were an actual person.&quot; Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center cites Atticus Finch as the reason he became a lawyer, and Richard Matsch, the federal judge who presided over the Timothy McVeigh trial, counts Atticus as a major judicial influence. One law professor at the University of Notre Dame stated that the most influential textbook he taught from was &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, and an article in the &quot;Michigan Law Review&quot; claims, &quot;No real-life lawyer has done more for the self-image or public perception of the legal profession,&quot; before questioning whether &quot;Atticus Finch is a paragon of honor or an especially slick hired gun&quot;.

In 1992, an Alabama editorial called for the death of Atticus, saying that as liberal as Atticus was, he still worked within a system of institutionalized racism and sexism and should not be revered. The editorial sparked a flurry of responses from attorneys who entered the profession because of him and esteemed him as a hero. Critics of Atticus maintain he is morally ambiguous and does not use his legal skills to challenge the racist status quo in Maycomb. However, in 1997, the Alabama State Bar erected a monument to Atticus in Monroeville, marking his existence as the &quot;first commemorative milestone in the state&#x27;s judicial history&quot;. In 2008, Lee herself received an honorary special membership to the Alabama State Bar for creating Atticus who &quot;has become the personification of the exemplary lawyer in serving the legal needs of the poor&quot;.

=== Social commentary and challenges ===
&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; has been a source of significant controversy since its being the subject of classroom study as early as 1963. The book&#x27;s racial slurs, profanity, and frank discussion of rape have led people to challenge its appropriateness in libraries and classrooms across the United States. The American Library Association reported that &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; was number 21 of the 100 most frequently challenged books of 2000–2009. Following parental complaints about the racist language it contains, the novel was removed from classrooms in Virginia in 2016 and Biloxi, Mississippi, where it was described as making people &quot;uncomfortable&quot;, in 2017. In the Mississippi case, the novel was removed from the required reading list but subsequently made available to interested students with parental consent. Such decisions have been criticised: the American Civil Liberties Union noted the importance of engaging with the novel&#x27;s themes in places where racial injustice persists. In 2021, a group of teachers in Mukilteo, Washington proposed to take the book off the list of required reading for freshman and off the list of district-approved books to be studied and analyzed in classrooms, arguing that it &quot;centers on whiteness&quot;. The school board approved the former but not the latter proposal. Becky Little, of The History Channel, and representatives of the Mark Twain House noted that the value of classics lies in their power to &quot;challenge the way we think about things&quot; (Twain&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; has attracted similar controversy). Arne Duncan, who served as Secretary of Education under President Obama, noted that removal of the book from reading lists was evidence of a nation with &quot;real problems&quot;. In 1966, a parent in Hanover, Virginia, protested that the use of rape as a plot device was immoral. Johnson cites examples of letters to local newspapers, which ranged from amusement to fury; those letters expressing the most outrage, however, complained about Mayella Ewell&#x27;s attraction to Tom Robinson over the depictions of rape. Upon learning the school administrators were holding hearings to decide the book&#x27;s appropriateness for the classroom, Harper Lee sent $10 to &quot;The Richmond News Leader&quot; suggesting it be used toward the enrollment of &quot;the Hanover County School Board in any first grade of its choice&quot;. The National Education Association in 1968 placed the novel second on a list of books receiving the most complaints from private organizations—after &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot;.

With a shift of attitudes about race in the 1970s, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; faced challenges of a different sort: the treatment of racism in Maycomb was not condemned harshly enough. This has led to disparate perceptions that the novel has a generally positive impact on race relations for white readers, but a more ambiguous reception by black readers. In one high-profile case outside the U.S., school districts in the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia attempted to have the book removed from standard teaching curricula in the 1990s, stating:

Furthermore, despite the novel&#x27;s thematic focus on racial injustice, its black characters are not fully examined. In its use of racial epithets, stereotyped depictions of superstitious blacks, and Calpurnia, who to some critics is an updated version of the &quot;contented slave&quot; motif and to others simply unexplored, the book is viewed as marginalizing black characters. One writer asserts that the use of Scout&#x27;s narration serves as a convenient mechanism for readers to be innocent and detached from the racial conflict. Scout&#x27;s voice &quot;functions as the not-me which allows the rest of us—black and white, male and female—to find our relative position in society&quot;. A teaching guide for the novel published by &quot;The English Journal&quot; cautions, &quot;what seems wonderful or powerful to one group of students may seem degrading to another&quot;. A Canadian language arts consultant found that the novel resonated well with white students, but that black students found it &quot;demoralizing&quot;. With racism told from a white perspective with a focus on white courage and morality, some have labeled the novel as having a &quot;white savior complex&quot;, a criticism also leveled at the film adaptation with its white savior narrative. Another criticism, articulated by Michael Lind, is that the novel indulges in classist stereotyping and demonization of poor rural &quot;white trash&quot;.

The novel is cited as a factor in the success of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, in that it &quot;arrived at the right moment to help the South and the nation grapple with the racial tensions (of) the accelerating civil rights movement&quot;. Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement, despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them. Civil Rights leader Andrew Young comments that part of the book&#x27;s effectiveness is that it &quot;inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion&quot; and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set. Young views the novel as &quot;an act of humanity&quot; in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices. Alabama author Mark Childress compares it to the impact of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, a book that is popularly implicated in starting the U.S. Civil War. Childress states the novel

gives white Southerners a way to understand the racism that they&#x27;ve been brought up with and to find another way. And most white people in the South were good people. Most white people in the South were not throwing bombs and causing havoc ... I think the book really helped them come to understand what was wrong with the system in the way that any number of treatises could never do, because it was popular art, because it was told from a child&#x27;s point of view.

Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian of the Birmingham campaign, asserts that &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; condemns racism instead of racists, and states that every child in the South has moments of racial cognitive dissonance when they are faced with the harsh reality of inequality. This feeling causes them to question the beliefs with which they have been raised, which for many children is what the novel does. McWhorter writes of Lee, &quot;for a white person from the South to write a book like this in the late 1950s is really unusual—by its very existence an act of protest.&quot; Author James McBride calls Lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave:

I think by calling Harper Lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism ... She certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed, but in many ways I feel ... the moral bar&#x27;s been lowered. And that&#x27;s really distressing. We need a thousand Atticus Finches.

McBride also defends the book&#x27;s sentimentality, and the way Lee approaches the story with &quot;honesty and integrity&quot;.

=== Honors ===
During the years immediately following the novel&#x27;s publication, Harper Lee enjoyed the attention its popularity garnered her, granting interviews, visiting schools, and attending events honoring the book. In 1961, when &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; was in its 41st week on the bestseller list, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, stunning Lee. It also won the Brotherhood Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews in the same year, and the Paperback of the Year award from &quot;Bestsellers&quot; magazine in 1962. Starting in 1964, Lee began to turn down interviews, complaining that the questions were monotonous, and grew concerned that the attention she received bordered on the kind of publicity celebrities sought. Since then, she declined to talk with reporters about the book. She also steadfastly refused to provide an introduction, writing in 1995: &quot;Introductions inhibit pleasure, they kill the joy of anticipation, they frustrate curiosity. The only good thing about Introductions is that in some cases they delay the dose to come. &quot;Mockingbird&quot; still says what it has to say; it has managed to survive the years without preamble.&quot;

In 2001, Lee was inducted into the Alabama Academy of Honor. In the same year, Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley initiated a reading program throughout the city&#x27;s libraries, and chose his favorite book, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, as the first title of the One City, One Book program. Lee declared that &quot;there is no greater honor the novel could receive&quot;. By 2004, the novel had been chosen by 25 communities for variations of the citywide reading program, more than any other novel. David Kipen of the National Endowment of the Arts, who supervised The Big Read, states &quot;people just seem to connect with it. It dredges up things in their own lives, their interactions across racial lines, legal encounters, and childhood. It&#x27;s just this skeleton key to so many different parts of people&#x27;s lives, and they cherish it.&quot;

In 2006, Lee was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Notre Dame. During the ceremony, the students and audience gave Lee a standing ovation, and the entire graduating class held up copies of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; to honor her. Lee was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 5, 2007, by President George W. Bush. In his remarks, Bush stated, &quot;One reason &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; succeeded is the wise and kind heart of the author, which comes through on every page ... &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; has influenced the character of our country for the better. It&#x27;s been a gift to the entire world. As a model of good writing and humane sensibility, this book will be read and studied forever.&quot;

After remaining at number one throughout the entire five-month-long voting period in 2018, the American public, via PBS&#x27;s &quot;The Great American Read&quot;, chose &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; as America&#x27;s Favorite Book.

In 2003, the novel was listed at No. 6 on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read after a year-long survey of the British public, the highest ranking non-British book on the list. On November 5, 2019, BBC News listed &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels. In 2020, the novel was number five on the list of &quot;Top Check Outs OF ALL TIME&quot; by the New York Public Library.

== &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot; ==

An earlier draft of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, titled &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot;, was controversially released on July 14, 2015. This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York City to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The &quot;Watchman&quot; manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee&#x27;s lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it, but this claim has been widely disputed. &quot;Watchman&quot; contains early versions of many of the characters from &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. According to Lee&#x27;s agent Andrew Nurnberg, &quot;Mockingbird&quot; was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: &quot;They discussed publishing &quot;Mockingbird&quot; first, &quot;Watchman&quot; last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.&quot; This assertion has been discredited, however, by rare-books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee&#x27;s attorney and found them to be only another draft of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. Nurnberg&#x27;s statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler&#x27;s description of how &quot;Watchman&quot; was seen as just the first draft of &quot;Mockingbird&quot;.
Instances where many passages overlap between the two books, in some case word for word, also refute this assertion. Both books were also investigated with the help of forensic linguistics and their comparative study confirmed that Harper Lee was their sole author.

== Other media ==

=== 1962 film ===
The book was made into the well-received 1962 film with the same title, starring Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. The film&#x27;s producer, Alan J. Pakula, remembered Universal Pictures executives questioning him about a potential script: &quot;They said, &#x27;What story do you plan to tell for the film?&#x27; I said, &#x27;Have you read the book?&#x27; They said, &#x27;Yes.&#x27; I said, &#x27;That&#x27;s the story.&#x27;&quot; The movie was a hit at the box office, quickly grossing more than $20 million from a $2-million budget. It won three Oscars: Best Actor for Gregory Peck, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White, and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for Horton Foote. It was nominated for five more Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Mary Badham, the actress who played Scout. At the time, she was the youngest actress nominated in the category.

Lee was pleased with the film, &quot;In that film the man and the part met ... I&#x27;ve had many, many offers to turn it into musicals, into TV or stage plays, but I&#x27;ve always refused. That film was a work of art&quot;. Peck met Lee&#x27;s father, the model for Atticus, before the filming. Lee&#x27;s father died before the film&#x27;s release. Lee was so impressed with Peck&#x27;s performance that she gave him her father&#x27;s pocket watch, which he had with him the evening he was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor. Years later, he was reluctant to tell Lee that the watch was stolen out of his luggage in London Heathrow Airport. When Peck eventually did tell Lee, she told him, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s only a watch&quot;. He said, &quot;Harper—she feels deeply, but she&#x27;s not a sentimental person about things&quot;. Lee and Peck shared a friendship long after the movie was made. Peck&#x27;s grandson was named &quot;Harper&quot; in her honor.

In May 2005, Lee made an uncharacteristic appearance at the Los Angeles Public Library at the request of Peck&#x27;s widow Veronique, who said of Lee:

She&#x27;s like a national treasure. She&#x27;s someone who has made a difference ... with this book. The book is still as strong as it ever was, and so is the film. All the kids in the United States read this book and see the film in the seventh and eighth grades and write papers and essays. My husband used to get thousands and thousands of letters from teachers who would send them to him.

=== Plays ===
The book was first adapted as a play by Christopher Sergel. This adaptation debuted in 1990 in Monroeville, a town that labels itself &quot;The Literary Capital of Alabama&quot;. The play runs every May on the county courthouse grounds and townspeople make up the cast. White male audience members are chosen at the intermission to make up the jury. During the courtroom scene, the production moves into the Monroe County Courthouse and the audience is racially segregated. Author Albert Murray said of the relationship of the town to the novel (and the annual performance): &quot;It becomes part of the town ritual, like the religious underpinning of Mardi Gras. With the whole town crowded around the actual courthouse, it&#x27;s part of a central, civic education—what Monroeville aspires to be.&quot;

Sergel&#x27;s play toured in the UK starting at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds in 2006, and again in 2011 starting at the York Theatre Royal, both productions featuring Duncan Preston as Atticus Finch. The play also opened the 2013 season at Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre in London where it played to full houses and starred Robert Sean Leonard as Atticus Finch, his first London appearance in 22 years. The production returned to the venue to close the 2014 season, prior to a UK tour.

According to a &quot;National Geographic&quot; article, the novel is so revered in Monroeville that people quote lines from it like Scripture; however, Harper Lee herself refused to attend any performances, because &quot;she abhors anything that trades on the book&#x27;s fame&quot;. To underscore this sentiment, Lee demanded that a book of recipes named &quot;Calpurnia&#x27;s Cookbook&quot; not be published and sold out of the Monroe County Heritage Museum. David Lister in &quot;The Independent&quot; states that Lee&#x27;s refusal to speak to reporters made them desire to interview her all the more, and her silence &quot;makes Bob Dylan look like a media tart&quot;. Despite her discouragement, a rising number of tourists made Monroeville their destination, hoping to see Lee&#x27;s inspiration for the book, or Lee herself. Local residents call them &quot;Mockingbird groupies&quot;, and although Lee was not reclusive, she refused publicity and interviews with an emphatic &quot;Hell, no!&quot;

In 2018, a new adaptation was written by Aaron Sorkin, debuting on Broadway. The Broadway production was nominated for nine Tony Awards, winning one.

=== Graphic novel ===
In October 2018, Fred Fordham adapted and illustrated the story as a graphic novel. Some of the longer descriptive and commentary passages have been left out - &quot;the bits that children tend to skip anyway&quot; as C. J. Lyons says in her review of the graphic novel in the New York Journal of Books), who goes on to say &quot;the heart of Lee&#x27;s fictional 1933 Maycomb is faithfully recreated via the art and dialogue&quot;.

<text>Cops is a 1922 American two-reel silent comedy film about a young man (Buster Keaton) who accidentally gets on the bad side of the entire Los Angeles Police Department during a parade and is chased all over town. It was written and directed by Edward F. Cline and Keaton. This very Kafka-esque film was filmed during the rape-and-murder trial of Fatty Arbuckle, a circumstance that may have influenced the short&#x27;s tone of hopeless ensnarement.

It was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry in 1997.

==Plot==

Even though the central character&#x27;s intentions are good, he cannot win, no matter how inventively he tries. He gets into various scraps with police officers throughout the film. Eventually, he unwittingly throws a bomb into a police parade and ends up being chased by a horde of cops.

At the end of the film, Keaton&#x27;s character locks up the cops in the police station. However, the girl he is trying to woo disapproves of his behavior and gives him the cold shoulder. Therefore, he unlocks the police station and is immediately pulled in by the cops. The film ends with the title &quot;The End&quot; written on a tombstone with Keaton&#x27;s pork pie hat propped on it.

<text>North by Northwest is a 1959 American spy thriller film produced and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, and James Mason. The original screenplay written by Ernest Lehman was intended to be the basis for &quot;the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures&quot;.

&quot;North by Northwest&quot; is a tale of mistaken identity: an innocent man is pursued across the United States by agents of a mysterious organization that aims to prevent him from blocking their plan to smuggle microfilm containing government secrets out of the country. It is one of several Hitchcock films featuring a musical score by Bernard Herrmann and an opening title sequence by graphic designer Saul Bass. The film was the first to feature extended use of kinetic typography in its opening credits.

&quot;North by Northwest&quot; is listed among the canonical Hitchcock films of the 1950s and is often ranked among the greatest films. In 1995, the Library of Congress selected &quot;North by Northwest&quot; for preservation in the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. After its first screening, reviewers for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; hailed it as comedic, sophisticated self-parody.

== Plot ==
A waiter pages George Kaplan at the Oak Room restaurant at the Plaza Hotel in New York City at the request of two well-dressed men. As advertising executive Roger Thornhill summons the same waiter, he is mistaken for Kaplan, kidnapped by the pair, and brought to the estate of Lester Townsend in Glen Cove. Townsend interrogates Thornhill and subsequently arranges to kill him in a staged drunk driving crash; Thornhill survives, but fails to convince the police or his mother of what happened. Returning to the estate, Thornhill learns that Townsend is a United Nations diplomat.

Thornhill and his mother sneak into Kaplan&#x27;s empty room at the Plaza, where the thugs have followed him. Thornhill heads to the U.N. General Assembly Building to meet Townsend, who turns out to be a completely different man, the &quot;real&quot; Lester Townsend. As he asks him about the man impersonating him, one of the gang&#x27;s thugs throws a knife into Townsend&#x27;s back. Townsend collapses in Thornhill&#x27;s arms, and Thornhill is photographed grabbing at the knife, giving the appearance that he is the murderer. Thornhill flees, attempting to find the real Kaplan.

The &quot;United States Intelligence Agency&quot; realizes that Thornhill has been mistaken for Kaplan, a non-existent agent they created as a decoy to distract their quarries, but its chief, &quot;the Professor&quot;, decides against rescuing him for fear of compromising their operation.

Thornhill sneaks aboard the luxurious &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; train to Chicago without a ticket, where he meets attractive young Eve Kendall, who hides him from the police in her stateroom&#x27;s upper berth. The two establish a relationship—on Kendall&#x27;s part because she is secretly working with the espionageurs—and she helps him elude a police dragnet. She then tells Thornhill that she has arranged a meeting with Kaplan at a rural bus stop in Indiana. When Thornhill arrives there, he is attacked by a crop duster armed with a machine gun. After being flushed from cover in a cornfield, he attempts to halt a passing tanker truck; the airplane crashes into it and both explode. In the ensuing confusion he steals a bystander&#x27;s pickup truck. At Kaplan&#x27;s hotel in Chicago Thornhill learns that Kaplan had checked out before the time when Kendall claimed to have spoken with him. He goes to her room and confronts her, but she eludes him.

Thornhill tracks Kendall to an art auction, where the Townsend-impersonator—Vandamm, the ringleader—is purchasing a small primitive statue. Vandamm instructs his henchmen to deal with Thornhill. To escape, Thornhill disrupts the auction until police are called to remove him. He confesses to them he is the fugitive murderer, but the Professor intervenes. At the airport bound for South Dakota he tells Thornhill that Kaplan was fictitious and that Eve Kendall is their real agent. Vandamm lives above Mount Rushmore, and the agency thinks he will be leaving the country by plane from there. Thornhill agrees to help maintain Kendall&#x27;s cover.

At the Mount Rushmore visitor center, now playing the role of Kaplan at the USAI&#x27;s request, he negotiates for Vandamm&#x27;s turnover of Kendall to be arrested. Kendall shoots Thornhill dead and flees—an act to fool Vandamm. Afterward, the Professor arranges for Thornhill and Kendall to meet; Thornhill learns that Kendall is to depart on the plane with Vandamm and his right-hand man Leonard. He tries to dissuade her from going, but is knocked unconscious by the Professor&#x27;s driver and locked in a hospital room.

Thornhill escapes and goes to Vandamm&#x27;s home to rescue Kendall, where he overhears that the sculpture holds microfilm and that Leonard has discovered the blanks in Kendall&#x27;s gun. Vandamm indicates that he will dispose of Kendall by throwing her from the plane; Thornhill manages to warn her with a surreptitious note. Vandamm, Leonard, and Kendall head for the plane. Thornhill is momentarily held at gunpoint by the housekeeper until he realizes she&#x27;s holding Kendall&#x27;s gun. As Vandamm boards, Kendall takes the sculpture, runs to the pursuing Thornhill, and they flee to the top of Mount Rushmore. As they climb down, they are pursued by Vandamm&#x27;s men. A park ranger fatally shoots Leonard, and Vandamm is taken into custody by the Professor.

As Kendall hangs on by her fingertips, Thornhill reaches down to pull her up. 

She is next seen—as Mrs. Thornhill—being pulled into an upper berth on a train, which immediately enters a tunnel.

&quot;Cast information from Turner Classic Movies Database&quot; 
Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo appearances are a signature occurrence in most of his films. In &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, he is seen getting a bus door slammed in his face, just as his credit is appearing on the screen. There has been some speculation as to whether he made one of his rare &quot;second&quot; appearances, this time at around the 45-minute mark in drag as a woman in a turquoise dress on the train, but in fact, the woman was played by Jesslyn Fax, who went on to appear in many episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. She had previously appeared in &quot;Rear Window&quot;.

== Production ==

=== Writing ===
Hitchcock often told journalists of an idea that he had about Cary Grant hiding from the villains inside Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s nose and being given away when he sneezes. He speculated that the film could be called &quot;The Man on Lincoln&#x27;s Nose&quot;. Hitchcock sat on the idea, waiting for the right screenwriter to develop it. The original traveling salesman character had been suited to James Stewart, but Lehman changed it to a Madison Avenue advertising executive, a position that he had formerly held.

John Russell Taylor&#x27;s 1978 biography &quot;Hitch: The Life and Times of Alfred Hitchcock&quot; suggests that the story originated after a spell of writer&#x27;s block during the scripting of another film project:
Lehman repeated this story in the documentary &quot;Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North by Northwest&quot; that accompanied the 2001 DVD release of the film. Screenwriter William Goldman insisted in &quot;Which Lie Did I Tell?&quot; that it was Lehman who created &quot;North by Northwest&quot; and that many of Hitchcock&#x27;s ideas were not used. Hitchcock had the idea of the hero being stranded in the middle of nowhere but suggested that the villains try to kill him with a tornado. &quot;But &quot;they&#x27;re&quot; trying to kill him. How are &quot;they&quot; going to work up a cyclone?&quot; Lehman responded. &quot;I just can&#x27;t tell you who said what to whom, but somewhere during that afternoon, the cyclone in the sky became the crop-duster plane.&quot;

Hitchcock had been working on the story for nearly nine years prior to meeting Lehman. Otis Guernsey was the American journalist who had the idea which influenced Hitchcock, inspired by a true story during World War II when British Intelligence obtained a dead body, invented a fictitious officer who was carrying secret papers, and arranged for the body and misleading papers to be discovered by the Germans as a disinformation scheme called Operation Mincemeat. Guernsey turned his idea into a story about an American salesman who travels to the Middle East and is mistaken for a fictitious agent, becoming &quot;saddled with a romantic and dangerous identity&quot;.

Guernsey admitted that his treatment was full of &quot;corn&quot; and &quot;lacking logic&quot;, and he urged Hitchcock to do what he liked with the story. Hitchcock bought the 60 pages for $10,000. In an interview in the book &quot;Screenwriters on Screenwriting&quot; (1995), Lehman stated that he had already written much of the screenplay before coming up with critical elements of the climax. An example of the &quot;corn&quot; in the finished screenplay was the scene where Roger Thornhill returns to the Townsend estate with the detectives to find everything changed. If Thornhill was indeed a spy, he would have had no reason to return to the estate after his escape the previous night, nor would the criminals be expecting him to return as they obviously did.

This was the only Hitchcock film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Since 1986, it has been owned by Turner Entertainment, as part of the pre-May 1986 MGM film library that it acquired through temporary ownership of MGM.

Production costs on &quot;North by Northwest&quot; rose when a delay in filming put Cary Grant into the penalty phase of his contract, resulting in his being paid an additional $5,000 per day before shooting even began.

=== Casting ===
Eva Marie Saint&#x27;s agent had told her that she had received an invitation to a dinner with Alfred Hitchcock and his family, the first time she and Hitchcock met. Days after the dinner, Saint&#x27;s mother called her and reminded her that Hitchcock loved casting women wearing beige clothing and white gloves. Following her mother&#x27;s advice, she met with Hitchcock again, wearing that combination. She credited this for helping her win the role. MGM wanted Cyd Charisse for the role of Eve Kendall. Hitchcock stood by his choice of Saint.

Hitchcock attended the &quot;Middle of the Night&quot; play in order to watch a performance by Edward G. Robinson. After being impressed by the performance of Martin Landau, Hitchcock asked to meet him at MGM. Landau arrived and Hitchcock showed him the entirety of the project, including the storyboards. While they were looking at the project, Hitchcock turned and told Landau, &quot;You&#x27;re now Leonard.&quot;

=== Filming ===

At Hitchcock&#x27;s insistence, the film was made in Paramount&#x27;s VistaVision widescreen process. The only other VistaVision film made at MGM was &quot;High Society&quot;.

The aircraft flying in the aerial chase scene is a Naval Aircraft Factory N3N Canary, better known as the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;, a World War II Navy primary trainer sometimes converted for crop-dusting. The aircraft that hits the truck and explodes is a wartime Boeing-Stearman Model 75 trainer, and many of these were used for agricultural purposes until the 1970s. The plane was piloted by Bob Coe, a crop-duster from Wasco, California. Hitchcock placed replicas of square Indiana highway signs in the scene. In 2000, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the crop-duster scene at No. 29 on their list of &quot;The top 100 film moments&quot;. The British film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; ranked it as the &quot;greatest movie moment&quot; of all time in its August 2009 issue.

Among the locations used in the film are:
* 430 Park Avenue 
** This is the building used by Saul Bass during the opening credits. The building was constructed in 1916 as a luxury apartment tower called the Avenue Apartments and was designed by the firm Warren and Wetmore. In 1953, the building was stripped of its façade, given a new curtain wall designed by Emery Roth and Sons in the style of Lever House, and converted to offices. Bass&#x27;s title sequence is based on the geometric structure of the international style.
* Commercial Investment Trust Building (650 Madison Avenue, New York) 
** This is the location of Roger Thornhill&#x27;s office, and the building he walks out of in his first appearance in the film. The CIT Building was designed by the firm Harrison and Abramovitz and constructed in 1957.
* Plaza Hotel (768 Fifth Avenue, New York) 
** After taking a cab with his secretary, Thornhill has a drink in the Oak Room of the Plaza Hotel. It is here that he is kidnapped by Vandamm&#x27;s henchmen. Thornhill later returns to the Plaza, where he breaks into George Kaplan&#x27;s room. For space reasons, most of the shots in and around the Oak Room were actually done on a set.
* Old Westbury Gardens (71 Old Westbury Road, Old Westbury) 
** Thornhill&#x27;s kidnappers drive him to Townsend&#x27;s estate on Long Island. After questioning Thornhill, Vandamm instructs Leonard and his other henchmen to intoxicate Thornhill by force.
* United Nations headquarters 
** Following Thornhill&#x27;s escape from Vandamm&#x27;s henchmen at the Plaza, he takes a taxi to the United Nations headquarters to meet Lester Townsend. The U.N. headquarters buildings were also designed by Harrison and Abramovitz, the architects of Thornhill&#x27;s office. The scene of Cary Grant going to the United Nations in New York was filmed illicitly because, after reviewing the script, U.N. authorities denied permission to film on or near its property. After two failed attempts to get the required shots, Hitchcock had Grant pull up in a taxicab right outside the General Assembly Building while a hidden camera crew filmed him exiting the vehicle and walking across the plaza.
* Grand Central Terminal (89 East 42nd Street, New York) 
** Following the murder of Townsend at the United Nations, Thornhill rushes to Grand Central Terminal, where he sneaks onto the &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; en route to Chicago.
* LaSalle Street Station (414 South LaSalle Street, Chicago) 
** Thornhill and Eve Kendall arrive in Chicago at the LaSalle Street Station. At the station, Kendall gives Thornhill the instructions for his meeting with Kaplan.
* Prairie Stop 
** The famous &quot;crop duster scene&quot;, which in the film takes place in rural Indiana, was actually filmed on a highway in central California near the town Wasco. Hitchcock added square signs to the location to replicate those found in Indiana.
* Ambassador East Hotel 
** Thornhill returns to Chicago in a stolen truck he parks outside the Ambassador East Hotel. The hotel opened in 1926 and was designed by Robert S. DeGolyer and Co. Today, it continues to be operated as a hotel, under the name The Ambassador.
* Chicago Midway Airport 
** Following Thornhill&#x27;s arrest at the auction, he and the Professor travel to Midway Airport, where they board a flight for Rapid City, South Dakota. The terminal seen in the film was built in 1945-46 and was designed by architect Paul Gerhardt Sr. This terminal building was demolished in 2002.
* Memorial View Building, Mount Rushmore 
** The spurious murder of Roger Thornhill takes place in the Buffalo Room of the Memorial View Building at Mount Rushmore—the one location in the park where Hitchcock was permitted to film. This building was constructed in 1957 as part of the National Park Service&#x27;s Mission 66 program, and was designed jointly by NPS architect Cecil J. Doty and local architect Harold Spitznagel. The building was demolished in 1994.
* Vandamm House
** Vandamm&#x27;s house, set on a cliff atop Mount Rushmore, was not a real structure. Hitchcock asked the set designers to make the house in the style of Frank Lloyd Wright, the most popular architect in United States at the time, using the materials, form, and interiors associated with him. Set designer Robert F. Boyle planned the house, which featured a cantilevered living room and made extensive use of limestone. Exterior shots were done using matte paintings, while interior shots were filmed using a set built in Culver City, California, where MGM&#x27;s studios were located.

=== Costuming ===
A panel of fashion experts convened by &quot;GQ&quot; in 2006 said the gray suit worn by Cary Grant throughout almost the entire film was the best suit in film history, and the most influential on men&#x27;s style, stating that it has since been copied for Tom Cruise&#x27;s character in &quot;Collateral&quot; and Ben Affleck&#x27;s character in &quot;Paycheck&quot;. This sentiment has been echoed by writer Todd McEwen, who called it &quot;gorgeous&quot; and wrote a short story, &quot;Cary Grant&#x27;s Suit&quot;, that recounts the film&#x27;s plot, featuring the suit.

There is some disagreement as to who tailored the suit; &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine claimed it was Norton &amp; Sons of London, although according to &quot;The Independent&quot;, it was Quintino of Beverly Hills. Another article states that Grant used his Savile Row tailor, Kilgour French and Stanbury for the suit. A label reading &quot;Quintino&quot; is visible on one of the suits in the film, but this is because Quintino made duplicate suits for scenes involving more activity or stunts.

Eva Marie Saint&#x27;s wardrobe for the film was originally entirely chosen by MGM. Hitchcock disliked MGM&#x27;s selections, and the actress and director went to Bergdorf Goodman in New York to select what she would wear.

=== Editing and post-production ===
In François Truffaut&#x27;s book-length interview, &quot;Hitchcock/Truffaut&quot; (1967), Hitchcock said that MGM wanted &quot;North by Northwest&quot; cut by 15 minutes so the film&#x27;s length would run under two hours. Hitchcock had his agent check his contract, learned that he had absolute control over the final cut, and refused.

One of Eva Marie Saint&#x27;s lines in the dining-car seduction scene was redubbed. She originally said, &quot;I never make love on an empty stomach&quot;, but it was changed in post-production to &quot;I never discuss love on an empty stomach&quot;, as the censors considered the original version too risqué.

=== Critical reception ===
A contemporary in &quot;Time&quot; called the film &quot;smoothly troweled and thoroughly entertaining&quot;. A. H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; made it a &quot;Critic&#x27;s Pick&quot; and said it was the &quot;year&#x27;s most scenic, intriguing and merriest chase&quot;; he also complimented the two leads:

Period film critic Charles Champlin saw the film as an &quot;anthology of typical Hitchcockian situations&quot; and was particularly taken by the scene and suspense in which Grant&#x27;s character avoids death when attacked by a crop-dusting plane in the cornfields, which he believed was representative of Hitchcock&#x27;s finest work. &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critic Penelope Houston called it &quot;the purest piece of entertainment filmmaking&quot;.

&quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked &quot;North by Northwest&quot; at No. 49 in its &quot;Top 250 Best Films of the Century&quot; list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. 

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted it the 44th-greatest film of all time in 1999. 

In 2002 author and journalist Nick Clooney praised Lehman&#x27;s original story and sophisticated dialogue, calling the film &quot;certainly Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s most stylish thriller, if not his best&quot;.

The London edition of &quot;Time Out&quot;, reviewing the film in 2008, commented:
The film was voted at No. 28 on the list of &quot;100 Greatest Films&quot; by the prominent French magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; in 2008. 

In 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it as the second-best action and war film of all time. 

The film ranks at No. 98 in &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s 2011 list of the 500 Greatest Films of All Time. 

In the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls of the greatest films ever made, &quot;North by Northwest&quot; was ranked 53rd among critics; 

As of 2014 &quot;North by Northwest&quot; holds a 97% rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 113 reviews, with an average rating of 9.3/10. The site states the critical consensus as: &quot;Gripping, suspenseful and visually iconic, this late-period Hitchcock classic laid the groundwork for countless action thrillers to follow.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 98 out of 100, based on reviews from 16 critics. In 1998, &quot;Time Out&quot; conducted a poll, and &quot;North by Northwest&quot; was voted the twelfth greatest film of all time.

&quot;North by Northwest&quot; was ranked 13th in BBC&#x27;s 2015 list of the 100 greatest American films. In 2022, &quot;Time Out&quot; named &quot;North by Northwest&quot; the greatest thriller film ever made.

The Writers Guild of America ranked the screenplay No. 21 on its 2020 list of 101 Greatest Screenplays ever written. It is ranked the 40th-greatest American film by the American Film Institute.

The Sight and Sound Greatest Films of All Time 2022 poll ranked the film 45th among critics.

=== Awards ===
&quot;North by Northwest&quot; was nominated for three Academy Awards—Best Film Editing (George Tomasini), Best Art Direction – Set Decoration, Color (William A. Horning, Robert F. Boyle, Merrill Pye, Henry Grace, and Frank R. McKelvy), and Best Original Screenplay (Ernest Lehman)—at the 32nd Academy Awards ceremony. Two of the three awards went instead to &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, and the other went to &quot;Pillow Talk&quot;. The film—and Lehman specifically—also won a 1960 Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Hitchcock received his second Silver Shell for Best Director award at the San Sebastián International Film Festival. (He was also awarded the Silver Shell the year before for &quot;Vertigo&quot;.)

In 1995, &quot;North by Northwest&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its &quot;10 Top 10&quot;—the best 10 films in 10 &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;North by Northwest&quot; was acknowledged as the seventh-best film in the mystery genre. It was also listed as No. 40 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies, No. 4 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills, and No. 55 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition).

== Themes and motifs ==
Hitchcock planned the film as a change of pace after his dark romantic thriller &quot;Vertigo&quot; a year earlier. In his book-length interview &quot;Hitchcock/Truffaut&quot; (1967) with François Truffaut, Hitchcock said that he wanted to do &quot;something fun, light-hearted, and generally free of the symbolism permeating his other movies.&quot; Writer Ernest Lehman has also mocked those who look for symbolism in the film. Despite its popular appeal, the film is considered to be a masterpiece for its themes of deception, mistaken identity, and moral relativism in the Cold War era.

Some have mistaken the title &quot;North by Northwest&quot; as having come from a line in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (&quot;I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw&quot;), a work also concerned with the shifty nature of reality. However, Hitchcock explained in an interview with Peter Bogdanovich in 1963: &quot;It&#x27;s a fantasy. The whole film is epitomized in the title—there is no such thing as north-by-northwest on the compass.&quot; (The similar &quot;northwest by north&quot; is indeed one of 32 points of the compass.)

Lehman states that he used a working title for the film of &quot;In a Northwesterly Direction&quot; because the film&#x27;s action was to begin in New York and climax in Alaska. Then the head of the story department at MGM suggested &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, but this was still to be a working title. Other titles were considered, including &quot;The Man on Lincoln&#x27;s Nose&quot;, but &quot;North by Northwest&quot; was kept because, according to Lehman, &quot;We never did find a [better] title.&quot; The Northwest Airlines was worked into the film, reinforcing the title.

The film&#x27;s plot involves a &quot;MacGuffin&quot;—a term popularized by Hitchcock—which is a physical object that everyone in the film is chasing, but which has no deep relationship to the plot. Late in &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, it emerges that the spies are attempting to smuggle microfilm containing government secrets out of the country. The film&#x27;s protagonist, Roger Thornhill, only becomes involved through a case of mistaken identity (with a spy that does not even exist, &quot;George Kaplan&quot;), and only becomes a target for elimination when he becomes a persistent nuisance as a result.

&quot;North by Northwest&quot; has been referred to as &quot;the first James Bond film&quot; because of its splashily colorful settings, secret agents, and an elegant, daring, wisecracking leading man opposite a sinister yet strangely charming villain. The crop-duster scene inspired the helicopter chase in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;.

The film&#x27;s final shot—that of the train speeding into a tunnel during a romantic embrace onboard—is a famous bit of self-conscious Freudian symbolism reflecting Hitchcock&#x27;s mischievous sense of humor. In the book &quot;Hitchcock/Truffaut&quot; (pp. 107–108), Hitchcock called it a &quot;phallic symbol ... probably one of the most impudent shots I ever made&quot;.

== Influences ==
The film was very influential on the James Bond films and subsequent action-thriller films, as well as the TV series &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, where Leo G. Carroll played the same sort of role as the head of a top secret intelligence agency.

The film&#x27;s title is reported to have been the influence for the name of the popular annual live-music festival South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, started in 1987, with the name idea coming from Louis Black, editor and co-founder of the local alternative weekly &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, as a play on the Hitchcock film title.

The third episode of the 14th season of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; (1976) includes an homage to &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, when the Doctor, who like Hitchcock&#x27;s hero is falsely accused of a politically motivated murder, is attacked by gunfire from a biplane piloted by one of his enemy&#x27;s henchmen.

The 2010 Spanish dark comedy film &quot;The Last Circus&quot; pays visual homage to the Mount Rushmore scene in its climactic scene atop a controversial Francoist monument.

== Adaptations ==
&quot;North by Northwest&quot; was adapted as a stage play by Carolyn Burns. The adaptation premiered at the Melbourne Theatre Company in 2015.

<text>A Corner in Wheat is a 1909 American short silent film which tells of a greedy tycoon who tries to corner the world market in wheat, destroying the lives of the people who can no longer afford to buy bread. It was directed by D. W. Griffith and adapted by Griffith and Frank E. Woods from a novel and a short story by Frank Norris, titled &quot;The Pit&quot; and &quot;A Deal in Wheat&quot;.

Intercutting (cross-cutting) between still tableaux of the poor in the bread line and the lavish, active parties of the wealthy speculator somewhat anticipates the collision montage which became a hallmark of the politically charged Soviet cinema a decade or so later.

In 1994, &quot;A Corner in Wheat&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

The film was also released on 8mm in the 1960s.

==Cast==

* Frank Powell as The wheat king
* James Kirkwood as The poor farmer
* Linda Arvidson as The poor farmer&#x27;s wife
* Gladys Egan as The poor farmer&#x27;s daughter
* Henry B. Walthall as The wheat king&#x27;s assistant
* Grace Henderson as The wheat king&#x27;s wife
* W. Chrystie Miller as The poor farmer&#x27;s father

==Release==
The film was released on December 13, 1909. Because of an upsurge in political populism, audiences reacted to the film positively. Before &quot;A Corner in Wheat&quot;, Griffith avoided making political statements in his work. After the film&#x27;s success, he began to make bolder statements about society and politics, such as famously championing white supremacy in &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915).

<text>The Cool World is a 1963 American drama film directed by Shirley Clarke about African-American life in the Royal Pythons, a youth gang in Harlem. In 1994, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
The plot concerns the obsession of Duke (Hampton Clanton), a 15-year-old member of the gang Royal Pythons, to get a gun from a racketeer named Priest (Carl Lee), in order to become the president of the Pythons and a big shot in Harlem. After their friend Littleman&#x27;s father was forced out of his apartment, the Pythons take over the place and install Luanne, Python president Blood&#x27;s girlfriend, as resident prostitute. Discovering that Blood is a heroin addict, Duke assumes leadership of the gang and Luanne becomes his girl. During an outing at Coney Island, however, Luanne vanishes, and Duke returns to Harlem alone.

Priest, who is pursued by his enemies, seeks refugee in the Python headquarter and is allowed to stay. In an ensuing battle with the Wolves, a rival gang, Duke stabs an antagonist. Seeking refuge, he returns to Python headquarter and discovers Priest&#x27;s corpse. Duke then rushes back home and is apprehended by the police.

Utilizing first-time actors and true-life ghettos for scenery, Shirley Clarke&#x27;s film dramatizes the life of young gang bangers in 1960s Harlem and transcends its narrative to deliver a vivid picture of inner city life.

==Cast==
&quot;The Cool World&quot; stars real Harlem youth and some real gang members:
==Production==
This semi-documentary style movie was produced by soon-to-be documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman, directed by Shirley Clarke, and adapted by Clarke and Carl Lee from the 1959 novel &quot;The Cool World&quot; by Warren Miller, with original music was by Mal Waldron and cinematography by Baird Bryant

A play, written by Miller and Robert Rossen based on the novel, was first shown in Philadelphia and then twice at Broadway&#x27;s Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre on February 22 and 23, 1960, featuring Raymond St. Jacques, James Earl Jones, Calvin Lockhart, Hilda Simms, and others. The film helped launch Antonio Fargas, Clarence Williams III, Carl Lee, and Gloria Foster, who married Williams three years later.

== Release and reception ==
&quot;The Cool World&quot; debuted September 2, 1963 at the Venice Film Festival with a running time of 125 minutes. It received a standing ovation and was nominated for the festival&#x27;s Golden Lion award, as noted in the Sep 4, 1963 &quot;New York Times.&quot; Following its loss to the Italian film &quot;Hands Over the City&quot; (1963), the Sep 18, 1963 &quot;Variety&quot; reported that at least one Italian publication, &quot;Il Messaggero,&quot; decried the judges’ decision.

Early reviews were mixed. While &quot;Variety&quot; commended Clarke for her achievement and &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave a largely positive review, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; expressed disappointment, adding that African Americans were better qualified to make films about their people.

In the Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds positive reviews from six of six of the site&#x27;s designated top critics. Richard Brody of the &quot;New Yorker&quot; praised the film: &quot;Clarke&#x27;s images endow the characters&#x27; energies with a sculptural grandeur and embrace street life with a keenly attentive, unsentimental avidity.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum also reviewed it positively: &quot;It certainly had a visceral impact when it first appeared, helped enormously by Baird Bryant&#x27;s cinematography and Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s score.&quot;

Currently there is no home video release of the film. Frederick Wiseman owns the rights, and he is unwilling to release a home video version of &quot;The Cool World&quot; or to allow Milestone Films to release it among its Shirley Clarke series. Amy Taubin has, in response, called for a boycott of Wiseman films.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to the film was recorded by Dizzy Gillespie and his quintet, and was released as an album of the same name in 1964.

<text>In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.

It does so by iteratively marking as composite (i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the first prime number, 2. The multiples of a given prime are generated as a sequence of numbers starting from that prime, with constant difference between them that is equal to that prime. This is the sieve&#x27;s key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime. Once all the multiples of each discovered prime have been marked as composites, the remaining unmarked numbers are primes.

The earliest known reference to the sieve (, &quot;kóskinon Eratosthénous&quot;) is in Nicomachus of Gerasa&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to Arithmetic&quot;, an early 2nd century CE book which attributes it to Eratosthenes of Cyrene, a 3rd century BCE Greek mathematician, though describing the sieving by odd numbers instead of by primes.

One of a number of prime number sieves, it is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes. It may be used to find primes in arithmetic progressions.

==Overview==
A prime number is a natural number that has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: the number 1 and itself.

To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer by Eratosthenes&#x27; method:

# Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through : .
# Initially, let equal 2, the smallest prime number.
# Enumerate the multiples of by counting in increments of from to , and mark them in the list (these will be ; the itself should not be marked). 
# Find the smallest number in the list greater than that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
# When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list are all the primes below .

The main idea here is that every value given to will be prime, because if it were composite it would be marked as a multiple of some other, smaller prime. Note that some of the numbers may be marked more than once (e.g., 15 will be marked both for 3 and 5).

As a refinement, it is sufficient to mark the numbers in step 3 starting from , as all the smaller multiples of will have already been marked at that point. This means that the algorithm is allowed to terminate in step 4 when is greater than . 

Another refinement is to initially list odd numbers only, , and count in increments of in step 3, thus marking only odd multiples of . This actually appears in the original algorithm. This can be generalized with wheel factorization, forming the initial list only from numbers coprime with the first few primes and not just from odds (i.e., numbers coprime with 2), and counting in the correspondingly adjusted increments so that only such multiples of are generated that are coprime with those small primes, in the first place.

===Example===
To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to 30, proceed as follows.

First, generate a list of integers from 2 to 30:

  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30

The first number in the list is 2; cross out every 2nd number in the list after 2 by counting up from 2 in increments of 2 (these will be all the multiples of 2 in the list):

  2 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 

The next number in the list after 2 is 3; cross out every 3rd number in the list after 3 by counting up from 3 in increments of 3 (these will be all the multiples of 3 in the list):

  2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 25 29 

The next number not yet crossed out in the list after 3 is 5; cross out every 5th number in the list after 5 by counting up from 5 in increments of 5 (i.e. all the multiples of 5):

  2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 

The next number not yet crossed out in the list after 5 is 7; the next step would be to cross out every 7th number in the list after 7, but they are all already crossed out at this point, as these numbers (14, 21, 28) are also multiples of smaller primes because 7 × 7 is greater than 30. The numbers not crossed out at this point in the list are all the prime numbers below 30:

  2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29

==Algorithm and variants==
===Pseudocode===
The sieve of Eratosthenes can be expressed in pseudocode, as follows:

 algorithm Sieve of Eratosthenes is
 input: an integer &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1.
 output: all prime numbers from 2 through &quot;n&quot;.
 let &quot;A&quot; be an array of Boolean values, indexed by integers 2 to &quot;n&quot;,
 initially all set to true.
 for &quot;i&quot; = 2, 3, 4, ..., not exceeding do
 if &quot;A&quot;[&quot;i&quot;] is true
 for &quot;j&quot; = &quot;i&quot;2, &quot;i&quot;2+&quot;i&quot;, &quot;i&quot;2+2&quot;i&quot;, &quot;i&quot;2+3&quot;i&quot;, ..., not exceeding &quot;n&quot; do
 set &quot;A&quot;[&quot;j&quot;] := false
 return all &quot;i&quot; such that &quot;A&quot;[&quot;i&quot;] is true.

This algorithm produces all primes not greater than . It includes a common optimization, which is to start enumerating the multiples of each prime from . The time complexity of this algorithm is , provided the array update is an operation, as is usually the case.

===Segmented sieve===
As Sorenson notes, the problem with the sieve of Eratosthenes is not the number of operations it performs but rather its memory requirements. For large , the range of primes may not fit in memory; worse, even for moderate , its cache use is highly suboptimal. The algorithm walks through the entire array , exhibiting almost no locality of reference.

A solution to these problems is offered by &quot;segmented&quot; sieves, where only portions of the range are sieved at a time. These have been known since the 1970s, and work as follows:

# Divide the range 2 through into segments of some size .
# Find the primes in the first (i.e. the lowest) segment, using the regular sieve.
# For each of the following segments, in increasing order, with being the segment&#x27;s topmost value, find the primes in it as follows:
## Set up a Boolean array of size .
## Mark as non-prime the positions in the array corresponding to the multiples of each prime found so far, by enumerating its multiples in steps of starting from the lowest multiple of between and .
## The remaining non-marked positions in the array correspond to the primes in the segment. It is not necessary to mark any multiples of &quot;these&quot; primes, because all of these primes are larger than , as for , one has formula_1.

If is chosen to be , the space complexity of the algorithm is , while the time complexity is the same as that of the regular sieve.

For ranges with upper limit so large that the sieving primes below as required by the page segmented sieve of Eratosthenes cannot fit in memory, a slower but much more space-efficient sieve like the pseudosquares prime sieve, developed by Jonathan P. Sorenson, can be used instead.

===Incremental sieve===
An incremental formulation of the sieve generates primes indefinitely (i.e., without an upper bound) by interleaving the generation of primes with the generation of their multiples (so that primes can be found in gaps between the multiples), where the multiples of each prime are generated directly by counting up from the square of the prime in increments of (or for odd primes). The generation must be initiated only when the prime&#x27;s square is reached, to avoid adverse effects on efficiency. It can be expressed symbolically under the dataflow paradigm as

 &quot;primes&quot; = [&quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, ...] \ [[&quot;p&quot;², &quot;p&quot;²+&quot;p&quot;, ...] for &quot;p&quot; in &quot;primes&quot;],

using [[list comprehension]] notation with codice_1 denoting [[Complement (set theory)#Relative complement|set subtraction]] of [[arithmetic progressions]] of numbers.

Primes can also be produced by iteratively sieving out the composites through [[Trial division|divisibility testing]] by sequential primes, one prime at a time. It is not the sieve of Eratosthenes but is often confused with it, even though the sieve of Eratosthenes directly generates the composites instead of testing for them. Trial division has worse theoretical [[Analysis of algorithms|complexity]] than that of the sieve of Eratosthenes in generating ranges of primes.

When testing each prime, the &quot;optimal&quot; trial division algorithm uses all prime numbers not exceeding its square root, whereas the sieve of Eratosthenes produces each composite from its prime factors only, and gets the primes &quot;for free&quot;, between the composites. The widely known 1975 [[functional programming|functional]] sieve code by [[David Turner (computer scientist)|David Turner]] is often presented as an example of the sieve of Eratosthenes but is actually a sub-optimal trial division sieve.

==Algorithmic complexity==
The sieve of Eratosthenes is a popular way to benchmark computer performance. The [[time complexity]] of calculating all primes below in the [[random access machine]] model is operations, a direct consequence of the fact that the [[prime harmonic series]] asymptotically approaches . It has an exponential time complexity with regard to length of the input, though, which makes it a [[Pseudo-polynomial time|pseudo-polynomial]] algorithm. The basic algorithm requires of memory.

The [[bit complexity]] of the algorithm is bit operations with a memory requirement of .

The normally implemented page segmented version has the same operational complexity of as the non-segmented version but reduces the space requirements to the very minimal size of the segment page plus the memory required to store the base primes less than the square root of the range used to cull composites from successive page segments of size .

A special (rarely, if ever, implemented) segmented version of the sieve of Eratosthenes, with basic optimizations, uses operations and bits of memory.

Using [[big O notation]] ignores constant factors and offsets that may be very significant for practical ranges: The sieve of Eratosthenes variation known as the Pritchard wheel sieve has an performance, but its basic implementation requires either a &quot;one large array&quot; algorithm which limits its usable range to the amount of available memory else it needs to be page segmented to reduce memory use. When implemented with page segmentation in order to save memory, the basic algorithm still requires about bits of memory (much more than the requirement of the basic page segmented sieve of Eratosthenes using bits of memory). Pritchard&#x27;s work reduced the memory requirement at the cost of a large constant factor. Although the resulting wheel sieve has performance and an acceptable memory requirement, it is not faster than a reasonably Wheel Factorized basic sieve of Eratosthenes for practical sieving ranges.

==Euler&#x27;s sieve==
Euler&#x27;s [[Proof of the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function#Proof of the Euler product formula|proof of the zeta product formula]] contains a version of the sieve of Eratosthenes in which each composite number is eliminated exactly once. The same sieve was rediscovered and observed to take [[linear time]] by . It, too, starts with a [[list (computing)|list]] of numbers from 2 to in order. On each step the first element is identified as the next prime, is multiplied with each element of the list (thus starting with itself), and the results are marked in the list for subsequent deletion. The initial element and the marked elements are then removed from the working sequence, and the process is repeated:
  [2] (3) 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 47 49 51 53 55 57 59 61 63 65 67 69 71 73 75 77 79 ...
  [3] (5) 7 11 13 17 19 23 25 29 31 35 37 41 43 47 49 53 55 59 61 65 67 71 73 77 79 ...
  [4] (7) 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 49 53 59 61 67 71 73 77 79 ...
  [5] (11) 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 ...


Here the example is shown starting from odds, after the first step of the algorithm. Thus, on the th step all the remaining multiples of the th prime are removed from the list, which will thereafter contain only numbers coprime with the first primes (cf. [[wheel factorization]]), so that the list will start with the next prime, and all the numbers in it below the square of its first element will be prime too.

Thus, when generating a bounded sequence of primes, when the next identified prime exceeds the square root of the upper limit, all the remaining numbers in the list are prime. In the example given above that is achieved on identifying 11 as next prime, giving a list of all primes less than or equal to 80.

Note that numbers that will be discarded by a step are still used while marking the multiples in that step, e.g., for the multiples of 3 it is , , , , ..., , ..., so care must be taken dealing with this.

<text>Czechoslovakia 1968 (also known as &quot;Czechoslovakia 1918-1968&quot;) is a 1969 short documentary film about the &quot;Prague Spring&quot;, the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. The film was produced by the United States Information Agency (USIA) under the direction of Robert M. Fresco and Denis Sanders and features the graphic design of Norman Gollin.

It won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject and in 1997, was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress having been identified as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Controversy==
In 1972, Senator James L. Buckley obtained a copy of &quot;Czechoslovakia 1968&quot; to show on New York television stations. The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, J. William Fulbright, objected to the broadcast based on an interpretation of the Smith–Mundt Act, which would prohibit the domestic dissemination of material produced by the USIA. Fulbright complained to the Attorney General, but the Justice Department refused to intervene based on the interpretation of existing US law. In 1972, Congress amended the Smith-Mundt Act, based on this event, to explicitly prohibit the domestic dissemination of materials produced by the USIA. The USIA was abolished in 1999.

<doc id="73418" wikidata="Q266317" url="?curid=73418" title="Lilium lancifolium">
<text>Lilium lancifolium (syn. &quot;L. tigrinum&quot;) is an Asian species of lily, native to China, Japan, Korea, and the Russian Far East. It is widely planted as an ornamental because of its showy orange-and-black flowers, and sporadically occurs as a garden escapee in North America, particularly the eastern United States including New England, and has made incursions into some southern states such as Georgia.

It has the English name tiger lily, but that name has been applied to other species as well. 
== Description ==

Like other true lilies, the flowers are borne on upright stems that are tall and bear lanceolate leaves long and broad. &quot;L. lancifolium&quot; produces aerial bulblets, known as bulbils, in the leaf axils. These bulbils are uncommon in &quot;Lilium&quot; species and they produce new plants that are clones of the original plant.

The flowers are odorless. Each lasts a few days and if pollinated produce capsules with many thin seeds.

==Taxonomy==

=== Varieties ===
The names of names considered as varieties at some time are:
The &quot;Lilium tigrinum flore pleno&quot;, the double-flowered variety, had been exported out of Japan by William Bull since 1869.

=== Names ===

==== Scientific names ====
Botanists for many years considered &quot;L. tigrinum&quot; (after Ker Gawler) the correct scientific name until it was determined that older name &quot;L. lancifolium&quot; (after Thunberg) refers to the same species, and the latter became the accepted name.

==== Vernacular names ====
Its common name is tiger lily. Although this name is ambiguous across several species, it is correctly applied to this species alone.

== Cat toxicity ==
A case study of the successful treatment of a cat that ingested this particular species was published in 2007.

== Uses ==

It is cultivated and wild foraged in Asia for its edible bulbs. The cultivar &#x27;Splendens&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. In Taiwan, both the flower and bulbs are used as food, as are the other related species: &quot;L. brownii&quot; var. &quot;viridulum&quot;, &quot;L. pumilum&quot; and &quot;L. candidum&quot;.

A feature-length film made on a tiny budget over several days, it is a work of experimental fiction presented as an autobiographical documentary. &quot;A self-portrait by a fictional character in a real place—New York&#x27;s Upper West Side,&quot; the film comments on the title character&#x27;s personality and life as well as on documentary filmmaking and the medium of cinema more generally. In 1991, &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and recommended for preservation.

== Synopsis ==
L. M. Kit Carson plays David, a young white man living alone in his modest studio apartment on Manhattan&#x27;s West 71st Street during July 1967. The film begins without the conventional opening credits or music that would signify a professionally made documentary or fiction film. Instead, it&#x27;s just David at home saying plainly that he has recently lost his job and may soon be drafted into the military and sent to Vietnam. He does not identify the job in question, but his apartment décor and cinephile personality imply that it may have involved film. Sitting on a chair with film equipment and posters behind him, and quoting Jean-Luc Godard, he says he has decided to make a video diary to try to document and understand his life. After this introduction, what follows is a series of filmed diary entries that David makes over a period of several days, depicting his daily life, his surroundings, and his most personal thoughts and feelings.

In some scenes, David goes around filming his neighborhood, from various people and historical buildings to spontaneous moments such as police officers helping an apparent robbery victim. This video is sometimes silent and at other times accompanied by dialogue or ambient sound, or sound that he may have taped separately and added to the film later, such as radio broadcasts. David interviews some people and lets others talk freely to the camera. In a scene about one-third of the way into the film, his friend Pepe gives an extended monologue on his critical assessment of the diary as it is shaping up so far, namely that David is making &quot;a very bad work of art.&quot; Saying, &quot;Your life is not a very good script,&quot; Pepe recommends that David try harder to find what is truly interesting. If he&#x27;s going to focus on himself—someone who &quot;is not a good character&quot; to watch—then maybe he should take more risks, expose his vulnerabilities—perhaps even try filming himself standing naked in front of the camera, for as long as it takes to find some interesting truths. (Andrew Noren is one underground filmmaker from this time and place who had a lot of such nudity in his films.)

Most often in the film, David sits at home talking to his Lavalier microphone and 16mm Éclair camera about topics important to him, from film theory to his girlfriend Penny, who is a fashion model. Over the several days of making his diary, and maybe following some of Pepe&#x27;s advice, David becomes increasingly obsessed with filming Penny, without her permission, and even once when she&#x27;s sleeping in the nude. In that particular moment, she wakes up and attacks him for this transgression, and breaks up with him; this is followed by several failed attempts to contact her, and his monologue praising masturbation. David also repeatedly films through the window of a woman across the street, whom he nicknames &quot;Sandra&quot;, after the title character in Luchino Visconti&#x27;s eponymous 1965 film. And, in another scene, he follows an anonymous woman out of the subway and onto the street, quietly stalking her until she turns around and tells him, &quot;Beat it!&quot;

David&#x27;s diary project hits bottom after he leaves town for a day, to attend a family funeral, and returns to find all of his film equipment stolen. He reveals this in his last diary entry, which combines an audio recording of his voice with a series of photos David made of himself with rented or borrowed equipment. Disappointed and disillusioned, he says that this is the end of the film. The sound then stops and the image goes black for about ten seconds, seemingly the end of this diary film. But then &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; takes a sudden unexpected turn. It displays a title card (still no sound) saying simply &quot;DAVID HOLZMAN&#x27;S DIARY,&quot; followed by another card identifying L.M. Kit Carson as the actor playing him. Then some cards for the rest of the cast and the crew. The cards effectively acknowledge that the preceding was a work of fiction posing as an autobiographical documentary.

== Production ==

Film critic Richard Brody writes that, &quot;This ingenious, scruffy 1967 metafiction by Jim McBride is an exotic fruit grown in New York from the seed of the French New Wave.&quot; Jaime Wolf writes that, &quot;At once a fictional narrative within a recognizable documentary setting and a kind of essay on the conditions of filmmaking, &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; stands as one of the few American equivalents to the work which Godard was doing at the time.&quot; The French New Wave clearly was an inspiration for this film, but there were others as well. One influence was &quot;The Diary of a Lost Girl&quot;, a book published in 1905 as a supposedly authentic diary of a prostitute named Thymian, but actually written by its &quot;editor,&quot; Margarete Böhme; it was later adapted into a popular 1929 German film starring Louise Brooks as Lulu. This is what David refers to in the beginning of his film when he cites &quot;the famous Lulu&#x27;s diary&quot; as an inspiration for his work. Jaime N. Christley notes some other cinematic influences, saying that, &quot;the real point of origin is either Peter Watkins&#x27;s docudrama &quot;The War Game&quot; (which won the documentary Oscar for 1967) or Luis Buñuel&#x27;s &quot;Land Without Bread&quot;, depending on where you draw the fault lines.&quot; James McBride identified his more immediate American context for making the film:

I entered the world of movies when cinema vérité work like the Maysles brothers&#x27; and Richard Leacock&#x27;s and D. A. Pennebaker&#x27;s was new and exciting, and when a lot of underground filmmakers were trying to use the medium in a more poetic way, as an exercise in different kinds of liberation—you know, from personal liberation to liberation from the classical forms of filmmaking. So there were a lot of alternatives to Hollywood moviemaking then. These movies were all trying to find a new way of looking at life. And I was a young, idealistic filmmaker dealing with these same questions. You know: what is one supposed to be trying to do in the movies and how ought one go about doing it? My film, &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot;, was about this guy who makes a diary of his own life to try to find some truth that he can&#x27;t perceive in real time. It was meant to be kind of an ironical formula, let&#x27;s say, to explore a lot of those ideas.

&quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; was filmed in about a week with borrowed equipment and a mere $2,500 budget. According to L.M. Kit Carson, the money came from a book advance from The Museum of Modern Art, intended for him and McBride to research and write a book on cinema verité. After conducting several filmmaker interviews, they changed their minds and decided to do something better with the money:

Halfway through the book-writing, McBride says to me: &quot;There is no Truth on Film. Basically as soon as you turn the camera on – everything changes – to not real – gets like unreal.&quot; So we decide it&#x27;s more quote/unquote &quot;un-truth-ful&quot; to write this book – we decide not to write this book. We take the $2,500.00 book-advance – and over the 10-day Easter Break from college – we make a cinema-verite mock-documentary – we figure it&#x27;s the strongest way to question cinema-verite: &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary.&quot;

&quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; exemplifies guerrilla filmmaking, a mode of production defined not by genre but by a drastic lack of production resources along with a by-any-means-necessary mindset. The needed resources include money, equipment, facilities, and professional cast and crew; lacking them requires filmmakers to be very economical and creative, as with McBride and Carson&#x27;s use of the $2,500 MoMA book money. Or with the writing of the film&#x27;s dialogue. Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum says the dialogue in &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; &quot;was basically written (when it was written) on a scene by scene basis&quot; with the actors involved. Other scenes were completely impromptu, such as the one with &quot;the frank sexual talk from the lady in the Thunderbird–actually a transsexual who&#x27;d recently undergone a sex-change operation.&quot; David B. Lee describes this woman as actually a &quot;pre-op transsexual,&quot; and more importantly notes that this is the only woman in the film who isn&#x27;t victimized by David&#x27;s camera; who instead openly engages with it, cracking bawdy jokes and even explicitly soliciting sex.

Earlier in the 1960s, McBride had attended NYU&#x27;s film school, in the same class as Martin Scorsese. &quot;When he was doing &quot;Who&#x27;s That Knocking at My Door&quot; and I was doing &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot;, we were both working with the same cinematographer, Michael Wadleigh.&quot; It turns out that Wadleigh was key to making &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot;, and not simply as its cinematographer. According to McBride, Wadleigh was doing commercial work at the time, and took creative advantage of that situation to get resources for their film:

It&#x27;s kind of a complicated process, but we would go out and shoot something for somebody and if he had to shoot something on the following Monday, say, we&#x27;d keep the equipment over the weekend. So Mike&#x27;s idea was, this movie you want to make, why don&#x27;t we just use this free equipment we have on the weekends and shoot stuff. So that&#x27;s what we did. We used leftover film stock. To process the film we would go to the lab under the aegis of some other project we were working on.

The choice of the Upper West Side location for the film came from McBride&#x27;s own life experience: &quot;I was born and raised there and I still lived there, not with my parents but I still lived in the neighborhood long after I left home and so these were the streets that I walked, these were the things that I saw. [It] was kind of my world and I wanted to share a little bit.&quot;

== Distribution ==

A highly unconventional film made completely outside the studio system, &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; was not distributed theatrically. However, it had early successes at film festivals, cinema clubs, and museums. It screened at the New York Film Festival and the San Francisco Film Festival, and won awards at the Mannheim, Brussels, and Pesaro film festivals. It screened in 1968 at the Flaherty Seminar and the Museum of Modern Art, and in 1973 at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Regarding the MoMA screening, L. M. Kit Carson said the museum, &quot;was not happy that we did not make the contracted book,&quot; until the film won awards at festivals. &quot;Then the Museum arranged for a high-profile Special Screening of the mock-doc – the beginning of a film-series called CINEPROBE&quot; and then added the film to its collection.

In 1991, &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; It has since had varying distribution on videotape, laserdisc, DVD, and online.

==Reception and legacy==
In 1973, Chuck Kraemer predicted that &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; would be remembered as &quot;the underground autobiographical cinema verité film of the sixties,&quot; and that &quot;scholars of the nineties will revere it.&quot; Since then, the film has remained obscure to the general public while developing and maintaining a strong critical reputation, such that its ratings on Rotten Tomatoes are 91% approval among critics and 76% approval among audiences. Likewise, the &quot;TV Guide&quot; website says that &quot;this provocative, endlessly self-conscious film today stands as one of the best independent films of the 1960s.&quot;

After its initial years on the festival circuit, &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; gradually became &quot;a classic, shown in university classes and film classes&quot; for reasons including its engagement with film theory and practice. In terms of film practice, it shows a young man using various newly available film technologies and innovative techniques, including &quot;static long takes with monologues; extended passages of black screen; fish-eye distortions; [and] lateral travellings that offer Arbus-like views of everyday grotesquerie.&quot; It shows David using these techniques in making a diary film, a format that is technically simple and affordable—a natural option for young creative filmmakers with limited resources. One such young filmmaker at the time was Brian De Palma, who said that:

When I first got my 8mm sound camera, I&#x27;d carry it around like David Holzman and try to film everything I did and look at it. My friends and I had cameras all the time and we were all film directors. I filmed a whole section of my life—people I was going out with, my friends. I just shot everything. I directed the scenes, too. And it all came from &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot;.

&quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; has been referenced directly or indirectly in subsequent films including the 1969 drama &quot;Coming Apart&quot;, the 1974 comedy feature &quot;Yackety Yack&quot;, the 2001 comedy-drama &quot;CQ&quot;, and the 2002 comedy short &quot;Camera Noise&quot;. In 2011, Kevin B. Lee made a two-part online documentary about the film titled &quot;Diary of David Holzman&quot;. Film critics, scholars, and fans also have written a lot about various aspects of the film, mostly its complicated relations between fact and fiction; between art and life; and between the public and private spheres.

=== Relations Between Fact and Fiction ===
This film&#x27;s engagement with fact vs. fiction elicited some of its earliest and strongest critical reactions, namely from audience members who felt duped; angry that they were led to believe that David Holzman was an actual person and the film was a documentary. Viewers at the Flaherty Seminar screening were reportedly &quot;outraged&quot; at the film, which also was &quot;booed at the 1968 San Francisco Film Festival when the end credits revealed it to be fiction.&quot; A college newspaper review noted a sense of &quot;great shock&quot; at having &quot;thought we&#x27;d found a truth about life from a film of lived life; instead, we got that meaning from a piece of imaginative art.&quot; L. M. Kit Carson said that, given such reactions, when MoMA was to screen the film in 1968, the museum billed the film as a comedy rather than a documentary.

All this shock and anger may seem to be overreacting, but the film touched a nerve by being so convincing and waiting until the latest possible moment to reveal that it was all staged. The film was so convincing due to many techniques, including its consistent use of mobile camera and sound equipment, location filming, minimal editing, unknown actors, improvised dialogue, and highly personal subject matter, with the David character talking extensively about himself. Louise Spence and Vinicius Navarro identify some additional techniques: &quot;the direct address to the camera, the wandering narrative, the visual and aural disorder (muddy sound and blurred focus), and the compulsive use of dates to describe the day&#x27;s filming.&quot; Altogether, they write, this carefully crafted film violated &quot;the contract that binds documentary filmmakers to their audiences;&quot; it did a lot of work to &quot;upset our faith in documentary representation and presumptions that are often associated with non-fiction cinema.&quot;

Further blurring lines between fiction and fact, this film explores how, even in actual documentaries, truth can be manipulated—consciously or unconsciously—before, during, and after filming. Vincent Canby wrote that the film &quot;highlights questions we all have about the quality of truth that can be captured by the cinema verité camera,&quot; and about the &quot;awful possibilities for distortion&quot; via the editing process. In his critical monologue within the film, Pepe speaks to how the act of filming can change what&#x27;s being filmed:

As soon as you start filming something, whatever happens in front of the camera is not reality any more. It becomes a work of art ... And you stop living somehow. And you get very self-conscious about anything you do. &#x27;Should I put my hand here?&#x27; ... &#x27;Should I place myself on this side of the frame?&#x27; And your decisions stop being moral decisions, and they become aesthetical decisions.

Putting this differently, Jaime Wolf writes that &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; applies what film critic Andrew Sarris described as the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle of documentary filmmaking, namely &quot;the inevitable effect of the presence of an observer on the behavior of the observed.&quot; For better or worse, consciously or not, overtly or subtly, people often play to the camera, behaving differently than they otherwise would. Nowhere in this film is this more overt than in David&#x27;s scene with the unnamed character dubbed by some as the &quot;Thunderbird Lady.&quot; This extended scene of a woman—a self-proclaimed nude model—sitting in her car and talking boldly and crudely to the cameraman, mostly about sex—is just too extreme for an actual unmediated encounter, even on the streets of New York. Several critics noted her exaggerated performance for the camera, as well as the fact that she also altered what was going on behind the camera during this scene. L. M. Kit Carson reports that he &quot;choked and dummied up&quot; and &quot;became so unnerved&quot; at this bizarre interview situation that Michael Wadleigh had to take over and complete the interview for him, something barely noticeable in the final film.

David begins his diary by quoting Godard&#x27;s famous statement that the medium of cinema is &quot;truth twenty-four times a second.&quot; However, as Edward Copeland has observed, David does not mention that Godard&#x27;s full quote ends with, &quot;and every cut is a lie.&quot; Many writers have discussed the implications of &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; for truth beyond the area of documentary film—for cinema and photographic media more generally. Emanuel Levy writes that &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; is an example of &quot;the impossibility of achieving complete objectivity on screen.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; describes the film as, &quot;One of cinema&#x27;s most pointed statements about the impossibility of objectivity in film.&quot; Similarly, Justin Stewart calls the film &quot;a hoaxed blast of &#x27;reality&#x27; whose main subject is the impossibility of objective documentation.&quot;

Many writers have described &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; as a satire of documentary films or filmmakers. For example, that the film &quot;takes funny jabs&quot; at the self-importance or seriousness of practitioners of the new &quot;personal cinema.&quot; These were filmmakers who &quot;established a new relationship with their subjects: intimate, revelatory and personal, countering a documentary tradition in which human beings were primarily used to illustrate various social themes.&quot; Filmmakers including Richard Leacock, D.A. Pennebaker, Andrew Noren, and the Maysles brothers. Regarding the extent to which his film mocks such filmmakers, McBride says he was not criticizing specific works or people; instead, he was jabbing at ideas—popular ideas about film and truth:

There was this general feeling or idea that there was this kind of truth that could be revealed that had never been revealed before. This was very enticing to me, but at the same time it was also silly, the idea that there is some kind of objective truth that can be revealed. And so I got this idea to make a film about a guy who thought he could find out the truth about himself and about his life by filming it, and not succeed.

More recent writings on &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; sometimes group the film with subsequent fiction films that likewise posed as documentaries, including &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; and films by Christopher Guest such as &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot;. Dave Kehr describes &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; as, &quot;much more convincing than Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Zelig&quot;.&quot; Jaime N. Christley groups it with &quot;Catfish&quot; and &quot;Exit Through the Gift Shop&quot;. Other writings from recent years cite filmmaking techniques in &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; that were unusual at the time but have become more common, such as the direct address by characters to the camera, or the creative use of end credit sequences, usually in the form of entertaining behind-the-scenes outtakes captured while making fiction films.

=== Relations Between Art and Life ===
Many writers have noted ways that &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; depicts complicated relations between art and life; how David&#x27;s life motivates and shapes his art, and vice versa. How his social life, his daily life at home, his background in film—all shape his artistic energy and choices, with various affects. And, vice versa, how David&#x27;s art shapes his life, and the lives of others, unfortunately often negatively. Film critic Chuck Kraemer captures some of this complexity when he writes that David is, &quot;every down-and-out filmmaker struggling for a vision, every sensitive New Yorker overwhelmed by the city&#x27;s visual fecundity, every young man suffering lost love, every inchoate artist trying to sort out his life, to explain himself to himself, and to the world.&quot;

For David, art and life are fused in New York film culture. He is deeply immersed in films, constantly thinking about them, watching them, and quoting other people about them. Film is his obsession, but his daily life also includes radio and TV consumption. As Brody writes, David&#x27;s city life depicts an &quot;endless stream of Top Forty radio and a wondrous, hectic view of television.&quot; The Top Forty radio that David listens to includes news reports of war and social unrest along with popular music; and the &quot;hectic view&quot; refers to the sequence that David made by filming one frame from each shot from a whole evening&#x27;s worth of network TV. Sitting all evening and clicking his camera once after every shot transition, David produced a two-and-a-half minute deluge of separate shots from a &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; newscast; then from episodes of &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, and a talk show; and then a late-night airing of the Shirley Temple film &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;. And, as David Blakeslee writes, a lot of commercials, &quot;Still capable after all these years, and even in this incomprehensibly compressed format of delivering their powerfully efficient subliminal messages.&quot; This blast of television images speaks to aspects of David&#x27;s life including the multitudes of images coming to him (and us) daily; and his rather boring life, insular and filled with TV and radio broadcasts along with film. It may also refer to Godard&#x27;s &quot;24 frames per second,&quot; how each individual frame conveys meaning in itself and in relation to other frames, in this case with a total of about 3,600 consecutive frames.

David&#x27;s life is shaped by images and popular culture, but he is not simply a passive consumer. He is an energetic and creative young filmmaker. Making films takes up a lot of his time, and affects his life, and those of other people, in various ways, not always with good results. While making his film, poking into peoples&#x27; lives, David alienates and even endangers women and gets himself punched by a cop. As Jaime N. Christley observes, &quot;we meet David in personal and professional freefall. Bad choices, bad pathology, and just plain bad luck coalesce into a black cloud that eventually consumes his life, and before the spare title cards indicate the film&#x27;s conclusion, our hero will have lost his girlfriend, his camera and sound kit, and revealed himself to be a minor sociopath with major control issues.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; likewise lauds the film for being &quot;unafraid to present and implicitly criticize the more unpleasant sides of its &#x27;hero.&#x27;&quot;

=== Relations Between Public and Private ===
One key part of this film&#x27;s engagement with art and life is its depiction of relations between public and private, relations that are gendered. As James Latham writes, David uses his film project partly to assert power over women; to spy on them, stalk them, and record them with or without permission, and thereby to potentially make those images public. Part of David&#x27;s motivation for asserting this power, Latham writes, is that he is experiencing flipped gender roles, or &quot;patriarchy in crisis.&quot; In an era when women (as well as people of color and members of the LGBT community) are gradually gaining some power in public spaces, David &quot;represents the growing realization that male power over women is waning.&quot; Whereas Sandra, Penny, and the anonymous subway woman &quot;are independent and associated with the outside man&#x27;s world, David is comparatively needy, impotent, and isolated in his small inner world. [Only the &quot;Thunderbird Lady&quot;] is willing to indulge him, except she is too liberated and aggressive for David.&quot;

Many writers have noted the film&#x27;s clear references to &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954) and &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; (1960) and their related issues. Jonathan Rosenbaum writes, for example, that these films examine &quot;notions of the camera as a probing instrument, especially in relation to voyeurism and other forms of aggressive sexual appropriation as well as self-scrutiny.&quot; Other critics note the public-private irony of fashion model Penny being unwilling to appear in David&#x27;s film; or that David is &quot;naked to everyone, but invisible to himself.&quot;

More recent writings on &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; sometimes refer to how technology and culture have evolved since the 1960s, further blurring boundaries between private and public. For example, David Blakeslee writes that when he watched the film recently on the Vimeo website, he knew practically nothing about it, except that &quot;it could be seen as a precursor of sorts to the 21st century phenomenon of YouTube vloggers who chronicle their lives to varying degrees of mundane detail, seeking to pull viewers into whatever fascinating experiences or excruciating dilemmas they think would hold their attention. Obviously, a lot has happened in the realm of personal public self-disclosure on film and video between 1967 and now.&quot;

===Aftermath===
Typical for a small independent film, &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot; was made by a small group of young and virtually unknown people who mostly continued to be unknown. This was the feature film debut for McBride and Carson; both of them continued to work over the years together or separately on some film and TV projects. Carson worked as a writer on the 1984 film &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; and on McBride&#x27;s 1983 remake of Godard&#x27;s &quot;Breathless&quot;. McBride directed the 1987 New Orleans neo-noir film &quot;The Big Easy&quot; and the 1989 Jerry Lee Lewis biopic &quot;Great Balls of Fire!&quot;, as well as episodes of the television shows &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;. Michael Wadleigh directed and was a cinematographer and writer for the Oscar-winning 1970 concert documentary &quot;Woodstock&quot;, and directed, wrote, and acted in the 1981 horror thriller &quot;Wolfen&quot;.

<text>Lilium ( ) is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants growing from bulbs, all with large and often prominent flowers. Lilies are a group of flowering plants which are important in culture and literature in much of the world. Most species are native to the Northern Hemisphere and their range is temperate climates and extends into the subtropics. Many other plants have &quot;lily&quot; in their common names, but do not belong to the same genus and are therefore not true lilies. True lilies are known to be highly toxic to cats.

==Description==

Lilies are tall perennials ranging in height from . They form naked or tunicless scaly underground bulbs which are their organs of perennation. In some North American species the base of the bulb develops into rhizomes, on which numerous small bulbs are found. Some species develop stolons. Most bulbs are buried deep in the ground, but a few species form bulbs near the soil surface. Many species form stem-roots. With these, the bulb grows naturally at some depth in the soil, and each year the new stem puts out adventitious roots above the bulb as it emerges from the soil. These roots are in addition to the basal roots that develop at the base of the bulb, a number of species also produce contractile roots that move the bulbs deeper into the soil.

The flowers are large, often fragrant, and come in a wide range of colors including whites, yellows, oranges, pinks, reds and purples. Markings include spots and brush strokes. The plants are late spring- or summer-flowering. Flowers are borne in racemes or umbels at the tip of the stem, with six tepals spreading or reflexed, to give flowers varying from funnel shape to a &quot;Turk&#x27;s cap&quot;. The tepals are free from each other, and bear a nectary at the base of each flower. The ovary is &#x27;superior&#x27;, borne above the point of attachment of the anthers. The fruit is a three-celled capsule.

Seeds ripen in late summer. They exhibit varying and sometimes complex germination patterns, many adapted to cool temperate climates.

Most cool temperate species are deciduous and dormant in winter in their native environment. But a few species native to areas with hot summers and mild winters (&quot;Lilium candidum&quot;, &quot;Lilium catesbaei&quot;, &quot;Lilium longiflorum&quot;) lose their leaves and enter a short dormant period in summer or autumn, sprout from autumn to winter, forming dwarf stems bearing a basal rosette of leaves until, after they have received sufficient chilling, the stem begins to elongate in warming weather.

The basic chromosome number is twelve (n=12).

==Taxonomy==
Taxonomical division in sections follows the classical division of Comber, species acceptance follows the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, the taxonomy of section &quot;Pseudolirium&quot; is from the Flora of North America, the taxonomy of Section &quot;Liriotypus&quot; is given in consideration of Resetnik et al. 2007, the taxonomy of Chinese species (various sections) follows the Flora of China and the taxonomy of Section &quot;Sinomartagon&quot; follows Nishikawa et al. as does the taxonomy of Section &quot;Archelirion&quot;.

The &quot;Sinomartagon&quot; are divided in three paraphyletic groups, while the &quot;Leucolirion&quot; are divided in two paraphyletic groups.

There are seven sections:
*&quot;Martagon&quot;
*&quot;Pseudolirium&quot;
*&quot;Liriotypus&quot;
*&quot;Archelirion&quot;
*&quot;Sinomartagon&quot;
*&quot;Leucolirion&quot;
*&quot;Daurolirion&quot;

There are 119 species counted in this genus. For a full list of accepted species with their native ranges, see List of Lilium species.

Some species formerly included within this genus have now been placed in other genera. These genera include &quot;Cardiocrinum&quot;, &quot;Notholirion&quot;, and &quot;Fritillaria&quot;. Four other genuses, 
&quot;Lirium&quot;, &quot;Martagon&quot;, &quot;Martagon&quot; and &quot;Nomocharis&quot; are considered to synonyms by most sources.

===Etymology===
The botanic name &quot;Lilium&quot; is the Latin form and is a Linnaean name. The Latin name is derived from the Greek word &quot;leírion&quot;, generally assumed to refer to true, white lilies as exemplified by the Madonna lily. The word was borrowed from Coptic (dial. Fayyumic) , from standard , from Demotic , from Egyptian &quot;flower&quot;. Meillet maintains that both the Egyptian and the Greek word are possible loans from an extinct, substratum language of the Eastern Mediterranean. , , was used by the Greeks, albeit for lilies of any color.

The term &quot;lily&quot; has in the past been applied to numerous flowering plants, often with only superficial resemblance to the true lily, including water lily, fire lily, lily of the Nile, calla lily, trout lily, kaffir lily, cobra lily, lily of the valley, daylily, ginger lily, Amazon lily, leek lily, Peruvian lily, and others. All English translations of the Bible render the Hebrew &quot;shūshan&quot;, &quot;shōshan&quot;, &quot;shōshannā&quot; as &quot;lily&quot;, but the &quot;lily among the thorns&quot; of &quot;Song of Solomon&quot;, for instance, may be the honeysuckle.

==Distribution and habitat==

The range of lilies in the Old World extends across much of Europe, across most of Asia to Japan, south to India, and east to Indochina and the Philippines. In the New World they extend from southern Canada through much of the United States. They are commonly adapted to either woodland habitats, often montane, or sometimes to grassland habitats. A few can survive in marshland and epiphytes are known in tropical southeast Asia. In general they prefer moderately acidic or lime-free soils.

==Ecology==
Lilies are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Dun-bar.

The proliferation of deer (e.g. &quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;) in North America, mainly due to factors such as the elimination of large predators for human safety, is responsible there for a downturn in lily populations in the wild and is a threat to garden lilies as well. Fences as high as 8 feet may be required to prevent them from consuming the plants, an impractical solution for most wild areas.

==Cultivation==
Many species are widely grown in the garden in temperate, sub-tropical and tropical regions. Numerous ornamental hybrids have been developed. They are used in herbaceous borders, woodland and shrub plantings, and as patio plants. Some lilies, especially &quot;Lilium longiflorum&quot;, form important cut flower crops or potted plants. These are forced to flower outside of the normal flowering season for particular markets; for instance, &quot;Lilium longiflorum&quot; for the Easter trade, when it may be called the Easter lily.

Lilies are usually planted as bulbs in the dormant season. They are best planted in a south-facing (northern hemisphere), slightly sloping aspect, in sun or part shade, at a depth 2½ times the height of the bulb (except &quot;Lilium candidum&quot; which should be planted at the surface). Most prefer a porous, loamy soil, and good drainage is essential. Most species bloom in July or August (northern hemisphere). The flowering periods of certain lily species begin in late spring, while others bloom in late summer or early autumn. They have contractile roots which pull the plant down to the correct depth, therefore it is better to plant them too shallowly than too deep. A soil pH of around 6.5 is generally safe. Most grow best in well-drained soils, and plants are watered during the growing season. Some species and cultivars have strong wiry stems, but those with heavy flower heads are staked to stay upright.

===Classification of garden forms===
Numerous forms, mostly hybrids, are grown for the garden. They vary according to the species and interspecific hybrids that they derived from, and are classified in the following broad groups:

====Asiatic hybrids (Division I)====

: These are derived from hybrids between species in &quot;Lilium&quot; section &quot;Sinomartagon&quot;.
: They are derived from central and East Asian species and interspecific hybrids, including &quot;Lilium amabile&quot;, &quot;Lilium bulbiferum&quot;, &quot;Lilium callosum&quot;, &quot;Lilium cernuum&quot;, &quot;Lilium concolor&quot;, &quot;Lilium dauricum&quot;, &quot;Lilium davidii&quot;, &quot;Lilium × hollandicum&quot;, &quot;Lilium lancifolium&quot; (syn. &quot;Lilium tigrinum&quot;), &quot;Lilium lankongense&quot;, &quot;Lilium leichtlinii&quot;, &quot;Lilium × maculatum&quot;, &quot;Lilium pumilum&quot;, &quot;Lilium × scottiae&quot;, &quot;Lilium wardii&quot; and &quot;Lilium wilsonii&quot;.
: These are plants with medium-sized, upright or outward facing flowers, mostly unscented. There are various cultivars such as Lilium &#x27;Cappuccino&#x27;, Lilium &#x27;Dimension&#x27;, Lilium &#x27;Little Kiss&#x27; and Lilium &#x27;Navona&#x27;.
* Dwarf (Patio, Border) varieties are much shorter, c.36–61 cm in height and were designed for containers. They often bear the cultivar name &#x27;Tiny&#x27;, such as the &#x27;Lily Looks&#x27; series, e.g. &#x27;Tiny Padhye&#x27;, &#x27;Tiny Dessert&#x27;.

====Martagon hybrids (Division II)====

:These are based on &quot;Lilium dalhansonii&quot;, &quot;Lilium hansonii&quot;, &quot;Lilium martagon&quot;, &quot;Lilium medeoloides&quot;, and &quot;Lilium tsingtauense&quot;.
:The flowers are nodding, Turk&#x27;s cap style (with the petals strongly recurved).

====Candidum (Euro-Caucasian) hybrids (Division III)====

: This includes mostly European species: &quot;Lilium candidum&quot;, &quot;Lilium chalcedonicum&quot;, &quot;Lilium kesselringianum&quot;, &quot;Lilium monadelphum&quot;, &quot;Lilium pomponium&quot;, &quot;Lilium pyrenaicum&quot; and &quot;Lilium × testaceum&quot;.

====American hybrids (Division IV)====
: These are mostly taller growing forms, originally derived from &quot;Lilium bolanderi&quot;, &quot;Lilium × burbankii&quot;, &quot;Lilium canadense&quot;, &quot;Lilium columbianum&quot;, &quot;Lilium grayi&quot;, &quot;Lilium humboldtii&quot;, &quot;Lilium kelleyanum&quot;, &quot;Lilium kelloggii&quot;, &quot;Lilium maritimum&quot;, &quot;Lilium michauxii&quot;, &quot;Lilium michiganense&quot;, &quot;Lilium occidentale&quot;, &quot;Lilium × pardaboldtii&quot;, &quot;Lilium pardalinum&quot;, &quot;Lilium parryi&quot;, &quot;Lilium parvum&quot;, &quot;Lilium philadelphicum&quot;, &quot;Lilium pitkinense&quot;, &quot;Lilium superbum&quot;, &quot;Lilium ollmeri&quot;, &quot;Lilium washingtonianum&quot;, and &quot;Lilium wigginsii&quot;.
:Many are clump-forming perennials with rhizomatous rootstocks.

====Longiflorum hybrids (Division V)====
: These are cultivated forms of this species and its subspecies.
:They are most important as plants for cut flowers, and are less often grown in the garden than other hybrids.

====Trumpet lilies (Division VI), including Aurelian hybrids (with &quot;L. henryi&quot;)====
: This group includes hybrids of many Asiatic species and their interspecific hybrids, including &quot;Lilium × aurelianense&quot;, &quot;Lilium brownii&quot;, &quot;Lilium × centigale&quot;, &quot;Lilium henryi&quot;, &quot;Lilium × imperiale&quot;, &quot;Lilium × kewense&quot;, &quot;Lilium leucanthum&quot;, &quot;Lilium regale&quot;, &quot;Lilium rosthornii&quot;, &quot;Lilium sargentiae&quot;, &quot;Lilium sulphureum&quot; and &quot;Lilium × sulphurgale&quot;.
:The flowers are trumpet shaped, facing outward or somewhat downward, and tend to be strongly fragrant, often especially night-fragrant.

====Oriental hybrids (Division VII)====
: These are based on hybrids within &quot;Lilium&quot; section &quot;Archelirion&quot;, specifically &quot;Lilium auratum&quot; and &quot;Lilium speciosum&quot;, together with crossbreeds from several species native to Japan, including &quot;Lilium nobilissimum&quot;, &quot;Lilium rubellum&quot;, &quot;Lilium alexandrae&quot;, and &quot;Lilium japonicum&quot;.
:They are fragrant, and the flowers tend to be outward facing. Plants tend to be tall, and the flowers may be quite large. The whole group are sometimes referred to as &quot;stargazers&quot; because many of them appear to look upwards. (For the specific cultivar, see &quot;Lilium&quot; &#x27;Stargazer&#x27;.)

====Other hybrids (Division VIII)====

: Includes all other garden hybrids.

====Species (Division IX)====
: All natural species and naturally occurring forms are included in this group.

The flowers can be classified by flower aspect and form:
* Flower aspect:
:*a up-facing
:*b out-facing
:*c down-facing
* Flower form:
:*a trumpet-shaped
:*b bowl-shaped
:*c flat (or with tepal tips recurved)
:*d tepals strongly recurved (with the Turk&#x27;s cap form as the ultimate state)

Many newer commercial varieties are developed by using new technologies such as ovary culture and embryo rescue.

===Pests and diseases===

Aphids may infest plants. Leatherjackets feed on the roots. Larvae of the Scarlet lily beetle can cause serious damage to the stems and leaves. The scarlet beetle lays its eggs and completes its life cycle only on true lilies (&quot;Lilium&quot;) and fritillaries (&quot;Fritillaria&quot;). Oriental, rubrum, tiger and trumpet lilies as well as Oriental trumpets (orienpets) and Turk&#x27;s cap lilies and native North American &quot;Lilium&quot; species are all vulnerable, but the beetle prefers some types over others. The beetle could also be having an effect on native Canadian species and some rare and endangered species found in northeastern North America. Daylilies (&quot;Hemerocallis&quot;, not true lilies) are excluded from this category. Plants can suffer from damage caused by mice, deer and squirrels. Slugs, snails and millipedes attack seedlings, leaves and flowers.

Brown spots on damp leaves may signal an infection of &quot;Botrytis elliptica&quot;, also known as Lily blight, lily fire, and botrytis leaf blight. Various viral diseases can cause mottling of leaves and stunting of growth, including lily curl stripe, ringspot, and lily rosette virus.

===Propagation and growth===
Lilies can be propagated in several ways;
* by division of the bulbs
* by growing-on bulbils which are adventitious bulbs formed on the stem
* by scaling, for which whole scales are detached from the bulb and planted to form a new bulb
* by seed; there are many seed germination patterns, which can be complex
* by micropropagation techniques (which include tissue culture); commercial quantities of lilies are often propagated in vitro and then planted out to grow into plants large enough to sell. A highly efficient technique for multiple shoot and propagule formation was given by Yadav et al., in 2013.

Plant grow regulators (PGRs) are used to limit the height of lilies, especially those sold as potted plants. Commonly used chemicals include ancymidol, fluprimidol, paclobutrazol, and uni-conazole, all of which are applied to the foliage to slow the biosynthesis of gibberellins, a class of plant hormones responsible for stem growth.

==Research==

A comparison of meiotic crossing-over (recombination) in lily and mouse led, in 1977, to the conclusion that diverse eukaryotes share a common pattern of meiotic crossing-over. &quot;Lilium longiflorum&quot; has been used for studying aspects of the basic molecular mechanism of genetic recombination during meiosis.

==Toxicity==
&lt;section begin=lilium-toxicity /&gt;Some &quot;Lilium&quot; species are toxic to cats. This is known to be so especially for &quot;Lilium longiflorum&quot;, though other &quot;Lilium&quot; and the unrelated &quot;Hemerocallis&quot; can also cause the same symptoms with equal lethality. The true mechanism of toxicity is undetermined, but it involves damage to the renal tubular epithelium (composing the substance of the kidney and secreting, collecting, and conducting urine), which can cause acute kidney failure. Veterinary help should be sought, as a matter of urgency, for any cat that is suspected of eating any part of a lily – including licking pollen that may have brushed onto its coat. Due to the high mortality rate, medical care should be sought immediately once it is known a cat came into contact with lilies, ideally before any symptoms develop.&lt;section end=lilium-toxicity /&gt;

==Culinary uses==
===Chinese cuisine===
Lily bulbs are starchy and edible as root vegetables, though bulbs of some species may be too bitter to eat.

&quot;Lilium brownii&quot; var. &quot;viridulum&quot;, known as 百合 (&quot;pak hop&quot;; ), is one of the most prominent edible lilies in China. Its bulbs are large in size and not bitter. They were even exported and sold in the San Francisco Chinatown in the 19th century, available both fresh and dry. A landrace called 龍牙百合 () mainly cultivated in Hunan and Jiangxi is especially renowned for its good-quality bulbs.

&quot;L. lancifolium&quot; () is widely cultivated in China, especially in Yixing, Huzhou and Longshan. Its bulbs are slightly bitter.

&quot;L. davidii&quot; var. &quot;unicolor&quot; () is mainly cultivated in Lanzhou and its bulbs are valued for sweetness.

Other edible Chinese lilies include &quot;L. brownii&quot; var. &quot;brownii&quot;, &quot;L. davidii&quot; var. &quot;davidii&quot;, &quot;L. concolor&quot;, &quot;L. pensylvanicum&quot;, &quot;L. distichum&quot;, &quot;L. martagon&quot; var. &quot;pilosiusculum&quot;, &quot;L. pumilum&quot;, &quot;L. rosthornii&quot; and &quot;L. speciosum&quot; var. &quot;gloriosoides&quot;. Researchers have also explored the possibility of using ornamental cultivars as edible lilies.

The dried bulbs are commonly used in the south to flavor soup. They may be reconstituted and stir-fried, grated and used to thicken soup, or processed to extract starch. Their texture and taste draw comparisons with the potato, although the individual bulb scales are much smaller.

The commonly marketed &quot;lily&quot; flower buds, called &quot;kam cham tsoi&quot; () in Chinese cuisine, are actually from daylilies, &quot;Hemerocallis citrina&quot;, or possibly &quot;H. fulva&quot;. Flowers of the &quot;H. graminea&quot; and &quot;Lilium bulbiferum&quot; were reported to have been eaten as well, but samples provided by the informant were strictly daylilies and did not include &quot;L. bulbiferum&quot;.

Lily flowers and bulbs are eaten especially in the summer, for their perceived ability to reduce internal heat. A 19th century English source reported that &quot;Lily flowers are also said to be efficacious in pulmonary affections, and to have tonic properties&quot;.

Asiatic lily cultivars are also imported from the Netherlands; the seedling bulbs must be imported from the Netherlands every year.

The parts of &quot;Lilium&quot; species which are officially listed as food material in Taiwan are the flower and bulbs of &quot;Lilium lancifolium&quot;, &quot;Lilium brownii&quot; var. &quot;viridulum&quot;, &quot;Lilium pumilum&quot; and &quot;Lilium candidum&quot;.

===Japanese cuisine===

The lily bulb or &quot;yuri-ne&quot; is sometimes used in Japanese cuisine. It may be most familiar in the present day as an occasional in the chawan-mushi (savoury egg custard), where a few loosened scales of this optional ingredient are found embedded in the &quot;hot pudding&quot; of each serving. It could also be used as an ingredient in a clear soup or .

The boiled bulb may also be strained into purée for use, as in the sweetened &quot;kinton&quot;, or &quot;chakin-shibori&quot;.

====Yokan====
There is also the &quot;yuri-yōkan&quot;, one recipe of which calls for combining measures of yuri starch with agar dissolved in water and sugar. This was a specialty of Hamada, Shimane, and the shop established in 1885 became famous for it. Because a certain Viscount Jimyōin wrote a waka poem about the confection which mentioned &quot;hime-yuri&quot; &quot;princess lily&quot;, one source stated that the &quot;hime-yuri&quot; (usually taken to mean &quot;L. concolor&quot;) had to have been used, but another source points out that the city of Hamada lies back to back with across a mountain range with Fuchu, Hiroshima which is renowned for its production of &quot;yama-yuri&quot; (&quot;L. auratum&quot;).

====Species used====

Current Japanese governmental sources () list the following lily species as prominent in domestic consumption: the &quot;oni yuri&quot; or tiger lily &quot;Lilium lancifolium&quot;, the &quot;kooni yuri&quot; &quot;Lilium leichtlinii&quot; var. &quot;maximowiczii&quot;, and the gold-banded white &quot;yama-yuri&quot; &quot;L. auratum&quot;.

But Japanese sources c. 1895–1900, give a top-three list which replaces &quot;kooni yuri&quot; with the named from the gaps between the tepals.

There is uncertainty regarding which species is meant by the &quot;hime-yuri&quot; used as food, because although this is usually the common name for L. concolor in most up-to-date literature, it used to ambiguously referred to the tiger lily as well, c. 1895–1900. The non-tiger-lily &quot;himeyuri&quot; is certainly described as quite palatable in the literature at the time, but the extent of exploitation could not have been as significant.

===North America===
The flower buds and roots of Lilium columbianum are traditionally gathered and eaten by North American indigenous peoples. Coast Salish, Nuu-chah-nulth and most western Washington peoples steam, boil or pit-cook the bulbs of &quot;Lilium columbianum&quot;. Bitter or peppery-tasting, they were mostly used as a flavoring, often in soup with meat or fish.

==Medicinal uses==
Traditional Chinese medicine list the use of the following: 野百合 &quot;Lilium brownii&quot;, 百合 &quot;Lilium brownii&quot; var. &quot;viridulum&quot;, 渥丹 &quot;Lilium concolor&quot;, 毛百合 &quot;Lilium dauricum&quot;, 卷丹 &quot;Lilium lancifolium&quot;, 山丹 &quot;Lilium pumilum&quot;, 南川百合 &quot;Lilium rosthornii&quot;, 药百合&quot;Lilium speciosum&quot; var. &quot;gloriosoides&quot;, 淡黄花百合 &quot;Lilium sulphureum&quot;.

In Taiwan, governmental publications list &quot;Lilium lancifolium&quot; Thunb., &quot;Lilium brownii&quot; var. &quot;viridulum&quot; Baker, &quot;Lilium pumilum&quot; DC.

In the &quot;kanpō&quot; or Chinese medicine as practiced in Japan, the official Japanese governmental pharmacopeia includes the use of lily bulb (known as in traditional pharmacological circles), listing the use of the following species: &quot;Lilium lancifolium&quot;, &quot;Lilium brownii&quot;, &quot;Lilium brownii&quot; var. &quot;colchesteri&quot;, &quot;Lilium pumilum&quot; The scales flaked off from the bulbs are used, usually steamed.

In South Korea, the lilium species which are officially listed for medicinal use are 참나리 &quot;Lilium lancifolium&quot; Thunberg; 당나리 &quot;Lilium brownii&quot; var. &quot;viridulun&quot; Baker.

==In culture==
===Symbolism===
In the Victorian language of flowers, lilies portray love, ardor, and affection for your loved ones, while orange lilies stand for happiness, love, and warmth.

Lilies are the flowers most commonly used at funerals, where they symbolically signify that the soul of the deceased has been restored to the state of innocence. 

&quot;Lilium formosanum&quot;, or Taiwanese lily, is called &quot;the flower of broken bowl&quot; () by the elderly members of the Hakka ethnic group. They believe that because this lily grows near bodies of clean water, harming the lily may damage the environment, just like breaking the bowls that people rely on. A different viewpoint proposes that parents discourage kids from picking lilies by informing them of the possible repercussions, like their dinner bowls breaking if they harm the flower. The indigenous Rukai people who call this same species &quot;bariangalay&quot; consider it as a symbol of bravery and perseverance.

In Western Christianity, Madonna lily or &quot;Lilium candidum&quot; has been associated with the Virgin Mary since at least the Medieval Era. Medieval and Renaissance depictions of the Virgin Mary, especially at the Annunciation, often show her with these flowers. Madonna lilies are also commonly included in depictions of Christ&#x27;s resurrection. &quot;Lilium longiflorum&quot;, the Easter lily, is a symbol of Easter, and &quot;Lilium candidum&quot;, the Madonna lily, carries a great deal of symbolic value in many cultures. See the articles for more information.

===Heraldry===
&quot;Lilium bulbiferum&quot; has long been recognised as a symbol of the Orange Order in Northern Ireland.

&quot;Lilium mackliniae&quot; is the state flower of Manipur. &quot;Lilium michauxii&quot;, the Carolina lily, is the official state flower of North Carolina. Idyllwild, California, hosts the Lemon Lily Festival, which celebrates &quot;Lilium parryi&quot;. &quot;Lilium philadelphicum&quot; is the floral emblem of Saskatchewan province in Canada, and is on the flag of Saskatchewan.

===Other plants referred to as lilies===
Lily of the valley, flame lilies, daylilies, water lilies and spider lilies are symbolically important flowers commonly referred to as lilies, but they are not in the genus &quot;Lilium&quot;.

<text>The Day the Earth Stood Still is a 1951 American science fiction film from 20th Century Fox, produced by Julian Blaustein and directed by Robert Wise. It stars Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Hugh Marlowe, Sam Jaffe, Billy Gray, Frances Bavier and Lock Martin. The screenplay was written by Edmund H. North, based on the 1940 science fiction short story &quot;Farewell to the Master&quot; by Harry Bates. The film score was composed by Bernard Herrmann. Set in the Cold War during the early stages of the nuclear arms race, the storyline involves a humanoid alien visitor who comes to Earth, accompanied by a powerful robot, to deliver an important message that will affect the entire human race. In 1995, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. 
==Plot==
After a flying saucer lands in Washington, D.C., the United States Army quickly surrounds it. A humanoid emerges and announces that he comes &quot;in peace and with good will&quot;. When he unexpectedly opens a small device, he is shot and wounded by a nervous soldier. A tall robot emerges from the saucer and quickly disintegrates the soldiers&#x27; weapons. The alien orders the robot, Gort, to desist. He explains that the now-broken device was a gift for the President of the United States that would have enabled him &quot;to study life on the other planets&quot;.

The alien, Klaatu, is taken to Walter Reed Army Hospital. After surgery, he uses a salve to quickly heal his wound. The Army is unable to enter the saucer. Gort stands outside, silent and unmoving.

Klaatu tells the President&#x27;s secretary, Mr. Harley, that he has a message that must be delivered to all the world&#x27;s leaders simultaneously. Harley tells him that in the current world situation, this is impossible. Klaatu proposes that he spend time among ordinary humans to better understand their &quot;unreasoning suspicions and attitudes&quot;. Harley rejects the proposal, and Klaatu remains locked in his hospital room.

Klaatu escapes and stays in a boarding house using the name Mr. Carpenter, adopted from a dry cleaner&#x27;s suit tag. Among the residents are young widow Helen Benson and her son Bobby. Helen&#x27;s boyfriend, Tom Stevens, becomes jealous of the stranger.

Bobby takes Klaatu on a tour of the city, including a visit to his father&#x27;s grave in Arlington National Cemetery; Klaatu learns that most of the dead are soldiers killed in wars. They also visit the Lincoln Memorial. When Klaatu asks Bobby, &quot;Who is the greatest living person?&quot;, Bobby suggests Professor Barnhardt. They visit the scientist&#x27;s home, but he is out; Klaatu sees that Barnhardt&#x27;s blackboard is covered with equations (an attempt to solve the three-body problem). Klaatu adds to them and, after being discovered by the housekeeper, leaves his contact information.

That evening, a government agent escorts Klaatu to Barnhardt. Klaatu tells Barnhardt that the people of other planets are concerned about Earth&#x27;s possible aggression, now that humanity has developed rockets and rudimentary atomic power. He states that if his message is ignored, Earth could be &quot;eliminated&quot;. Barnhardt agrees to gather scientists from around the world at the saucer; he also suggests that Klaatu peacefully demonstrate the power he possesses beforehand.

Klaatu returns to his spaceship, unaware that Bobby is following him. Bobby watches as Gort knocks out two soldiers so Klaatu can reenter the saucer. Bobby runs home and tells Helen. She does not believe him, but Tom is suspicious.

The next day, for half an hour, starting at 12 noon east coast time, all electrical equipment on Earth ceases to function, except for essential services, such as hospitals and aircraft in flight.

Klaatu learns that Bobby watched him the previous night. He visits Helen at work, reveals his mission, and asks that she not betray him. Helen asks Tom to keep Klaatu&#x27;s identity secret, but he refuses to listen, already in the process of alerting the military.

Helen and Klaatu rush to Barnhardt&#x27;s home. They hope that Barnhardt can hide Klaatu until the meeting that evening. Klaatu tells Helen that if anything should happen to him, she must go to Gort and say, &quot;Klaatu barada nikto.&quot;

The Army tracks them in their taxi. Klaatu is shot and killed, and his body is moved to a nearby police station cell. Helen rushes to the saucer and says Klaatu&#x27;s phrase to Gort. Gort retrieves Klaatu&#x27;s body, and revives him inside the saucer, though Klaatu tells Helen that his revival is only temporary.

Helen departs the spaceship with Klaatu and Gort, joining Dr. Barnhart among the gathered scientists. Klaatu tells the scientists gathered outside that an interplanetary organization has created a police force of invincible robots like Gort. &quot;In matters of aggression, we have given them absolute power over us&quot;. Klaatu concludes, &quot;Your choice is simple: join us and live in peace, or pursue your present course and face obliteration. We shall be waiting for your answer.&quot; Klaatu and Gort depart in the saucer.

==Cast==
* Michael Rennie as Klaatu
* Patricia Neal as Helen Benson
* Hugh Marlowe as Tom Stevens
* Sam Jaffe as Professor Jacob Barnhardt
* Billy Gray as Bobby Benson
* Frances Bavier as Mrs. Barley
* Lock Martin as Gort

Top broadcast journalists of their time, Elmer Davis, H.V. Kaltenborn, Drew Pearson, and Gabriel Heatter, had cameo roles. Spencer Tracy and Claude Rains originally were considered for the part of Klaatu.

==Metaphors==

In a 1995 interview, producer Julian Blaustein explained that Joseph Breen, the film censor installed by the Motion Picture Association of America at the Twentieth Century Fox studios, balked at the portrayal of Klaatu&#x27;s resurrection and limitless power. At the behest of the MPAA, a line was written into the script; when Helen asks Klaatu whether Gort has unlimited power over life and death, Klaatu explains that Gort has only revived him temporarily: &quot;that power is reserved to the Almighty Spirit.&quot; Of the elements that he added to Klaatu&#x27;s character, screenwriter Edmund North said, &quot;It was my private little joke. I never discussed this angle with Blaustein or Wise because I didn&#x27;t want it expressed. I had originally hoped that the Christ comparison would be subliminal.&quot;

That the question even came up in an interview is proof enough that such comparisons did not remain subliminal, but they are subtle enough so that it is not immediately obvious to all viewers that those elements were intended to compare Klaatu to Jesus Christ. When Klaatu escapes from the hospital, he steals the clothing of a Maj. John Carpenter, giving him the initials J.C.. Carpentry was the profession the Bible says Jesus learned from Joseph, his father. His previous actions are misunderstood, and he eventually is killed by military authority. At the end of the film, Klaatu, having been restored to life, ascends into the (night) sky. Other parallels include: his coming to Earth with a message for all mankind; his befriending of a child; possessing wisdom and specialized scientific knowledge beyond any human being; and people being given a sign of his power. At the very start of the film, one of the British radar technicians, upon observing the speed of Klaatu&#x27;s spaceship, is heard to exclaim, &quot;Holy Christmas&quot;!

==Production==
===Development===
Producer Julian Blaustein originally set out to make a film under the working titles of &quot;Farewell to the Master&quot; and &quot;Journey to the World&quot; which illustrated the fear and suspicion that characterized the early Cold War and Atomic Age. He reviewed more than two hundred science fiction short stories and novels in search of a storyline that could be used because this film genre was well suited for a metaphorical discussion of such grave issues. Studio head Darryl F. Zanuck gave the go-ahead for this project, and Blaustein hired Edmund North to write the screenplay based on elements from Harry Bates&#x27;s 1940 short story &quot;Farewell to the Master&quot;. The revised final screenplay was completed on February 21, 1951. Science fiction writer Raymond F. Jones worked as an uncredited adviser.

===Pre-production===
The set was designed by Thomas Little and Claude Carpenter. They collaborated with the architect Frank Lloyd Wright for the design of the spacecraft. Paul Laffoley has suggested that the futuristic interior was inspired by Wright&#x27;s Johnson Wax Headquarters, completed in 1936. Laffoley quotes Wright and his attempt in designing the exterior: &quot;...to imitate an experimental substance that I have heard about which acts like living tissue. If cut, the rift would appear to heal like a wound, leaving a continuous surface with no scar.&quot;

===Filming===
Principal outdoor photography was shot on the 20th Century Fox sound stages and on its studio back lot (now located in Century City, California), with a second unit shooting background and other scenes in Washington, D.C., and at Fort George G. Meade in Maryland. The shooting schedule was from April 9 to May 23, 1951, and the primary actors never traveled to Washington to make the film. Director Robert Wise indicated in the DVD commentary that the United States Department of Defense refused participation in the film based on a reading of the script. The military equipment shown, however, came from the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment then stationed at Fort Meade which supplied the vehicles, equipment, and soldiers for the segments depicting Army operations. One of the film&#x27;s tanks bears the &quot;Brave Rifles&quot; insignia of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment.

The robot Gort was played by Lock Martin, who worked as an usher at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre and stood seven feet and seven inches tall. Not accustomed to a confining, heat-inducing costume, he worked carefully while wearing the two oversized, laced up, foamed neoprene suits for the illusion of a seamless metallic Gort. Wise decided Martin&#x27;s on-screen shooting time would be limited to half-hour intervals, so Martin, with his generally weak constitution, would face no more than minor discomfort. These segments, in turn, were then edited together into the film&#x27;s final print.

In a commentary track on DVD, interviewed by fellow director Nicholas Meyer, Wise said he wanted the film to appear as realistic and believable as possible, to push the core message against armed conflict in the real world. The original title is &quot;The Day the World Stops&quot;. Blaustein said his aim was to promote a &quot;strong United Nations&quot;.

===Herrmann&#x27;s score===
The music score was composed by Bernard Herrmann in August 1951, and is the first film score he composed after moving from New York to Hollywood. Herrmann chose unusual instrumentation for the film: violin, cello, and bass (all three electric), two theremin electronic instruments (played by Dr. Samuel Hoffman and Paul Shure), two Hammond organs, Fox studio&#x27;s Wurlitzer organ, three vibraphones, two glockenspiels, marimba, tam-tam, two bass drums, three sets of timpani, two pianos, celesta, two harps, one horn, three trumpets, three trombones, and four tubas. Herrmann&#x27;s advances in film scoring included Unison organs, tubas, piano, and bass drum, staggered tritone movement, and glissando in theremins, as well as exploitation of the dissonance between D and E-flat and experimentation with unusual overdubbing and tape-reversal techniques. In using the theremin, Herrmann made an early foray into electronic music, one year before Karlheinz Stockhausen and three years before Edgard Varèse.

==Music and soundtrack==

20th Century Fox later reused the Bernard Herrmann title theme in the original pilot episode of Irwin Allen&#x27;s 1965 TV series &quot;Lost in Space&quot;; the music was also used extensively in Allen&#x27;s &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; TV series in various episodes. Danny Elfman noted &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;″s score inspired his interest in film composing, and made him a fan of Herrmann.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Variety&quot; praised the documentary style: &quot;the yarn is told interestingly enough and imbued with sufficient science-fiction lures and suspense so that only seldom does its moralistic wordiness get in the way... Cast, although secondary to the story, works well&quot;. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote: &quot;Very good! It is by far the best of the science-fiction pictures yet produced. It holds one&#x27;s interest undiminished from start to finish and, although the theme is admittedly fantastic, one is made to feel as if he is seeing a real-life occurrence because of the expert handling of the subject matter and the extremely fine special effects work.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the film&#x27;s seriousness, though it also found &quot;certain subversive elements&quot;. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; dismissed the film as &quot;tepid entertainment&quot; and described Gort as &quot;oddly unmenacing&quot;.

&quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; was moderately successful when released, accruing in distributors&#x27; U.S. and Canadian rentals, making it the year&#x27;s 52nd biggest earner. &quot;Rentals&quot; refers to the distributor/studio&#x27;s share of the box office gross, which, according to Gebert, is roughly half of the money generated by ticket sales.

&quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; earned more plaudits in other countries: the Hollywood Foreign Press Association gave the filmmakers a special Golden Globe Award for &quot;promoting international understanding&quot;. Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s score also received a nomination at the Golden Globes. The French magazine &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; was impressed, its contributor Pierre Kast called it &quot;almost literally stunning&quot; and praised its &quot;moral relativism&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; received recognition from the American Film Institute and was selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress&#x27;s National Film Registry. In 2001, it was ranked number 82 on &quot;100 Years... 100 Thrills&quot;, a list of America&#x27;s most heart-pounding films. It placed number 67 on a similar list &quot;100 Years... 100 Cheers&quot;, a list of America&#x27;s most inspiring films. In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its &quot;10 Top 10&quot;the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genresafter polling more than 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; was acknowledged as the fifth best film in the science fiction genre. In 2004, the film was selected by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of &quot;The Best 1000 Movies Ever Made&quot;.

Ringo Starr brought the imagery of the film back into popular culture by using a modified scene of the ship and Klaatu for the cover of his 1974 album &quot;Goodnight Vienna&quot;. Lou Cannon and Colin Powell believed the film inspired Ronald Reagan to discuss uniting against an alien invasion when meeting Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985. Two years later, Reagan told the United Nations, &quot;I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.&quot; The film is playing in the opening scene of the first episode of &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; when Captain Pike refers to it as a &quot;classic&quot;. American rock musician Willie Nile released an album entitled &quot;The Day The Earth Stood Still&quot; in 2021. The album&#x27;s title track was inspired by the deserted streets of New York City during the Covid-19 pandemic, and contains the &quot;Klaatu Barada Nikto&quot; phrase in its chorus.

&quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; is now considered one of the best films released in 1951. &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; is in Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s list of the 12 best science fiction films of all time. The film holds a 97% rating at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 57 reviews, with an average rating of 8.10/10. The consensus states, &quot;Socially minded yet entertaining, &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; imparts its moral of peace and understanding without didacticism.&quot; Tony Magistrale describes the film as one of the best examples of early techno-horror.

===Adaptations===
The film was dramatized as a radio play on January 4, 1954, for the &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;; Michael Rennie reprised his lead role as Klaatu with actress Jean Peters as Helen Benson. This production was later re-broadcast on the &quot;Hollywood Radio Theater&quot;, the re-titled &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;, which aired on the Armed Forces Radio Service.

The 2008 remake &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; was directed by Scott Derrickson and stars Keanu Reeves as Klaatu. Rather than leaving to humans the chance to collaborate, the remake rests on Klaatu&#x27;s decision whether to let humanity be destroyed or saved.

===Klaatu barada nikto===
Since the release of the film, the phrase &quot;Klaatu barada nikto&quot; has appeared repeatedly in fiction and in popular culture. The Robot Hall of Fame described it as &quot;one of the most famous commands in science fiction&quot;, and Frederick S. Clarke of &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; called it in 1970 &quot;the most famous phrase ever spoken by an extraterrestrial&quot;.

Patricia Neal had a problem speaking the phrase, though she was proud of the film overall. &quot;I do think it&#x27;s the best science fiction film ever made, although I admit that I sometimes had a difficult time keeping a straight face. Michael would patiently watch me bite my lips to avoid giggling and ask, with true British reserve, &#x27;Is that the way you intend to play it?&#x27;&quot;

Edmund H. North, who wrote &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, also created the alien language used in the film, including the iconic phrase &quot;Klaatu barada nikto.&quot; The official spelling for the phrase comes directly from the script and provides insight as to its proper pronunciation. No translation was given in the film. Philosophy professor Aeon J. Skoble speculates the famous phrase is a &quot;safe-word&quot; which is part of a fail-safe feature used during diplomatic missions such as the one Klaatu and Gort make to Earth. With the use of the safe-word, Gort&#x27;s deadly force can be deactivated in the event the robot is mistakenly triggered into a defensive posture. Skoble observes that the theme has evolved into a &quot;staple of science fiction that the machines charged with protecting us from ourselves will misuse or abuse their power.&quot;

&quot;Fantastic Films&quot; explored the meaning of &quot;Klaatu barada nikto&quot; in a 1978 article titled &quot;The Language of Klaatu&quot;. The article, written by Tauna Le Marbe, who is listed as its &quot;alien linguistics editor&quot;, attempts to translate all the alien words Klaatu used throughout the film. In the article, the literal translation for Klaatu barada nikto was &quot;Stop Barbarism (I have) death, bind&quot; and the free translation was &quot;I die, repair me, do not retaliate.&quot;

The documentary &quot;Decoding &quot;Klaatu Barada Nikto&quot;: Science Fiction as Metaphor&quot; examined the phrase &quot;Klaatu barada nikto&quot; with some of the people involved in the production of &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;. Robert Wise, the director of the film, conveyed an account of Edmund North telling him, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s just something I kind of cooked up. I thought it sounded good.&quot; Billy Gray, who played Bobby Benson in the film, said he believed the message was coming from Klaatu and that &quot;Barada Nikto must mean... save Earth.&quot;

Florence Blaustein, widow of the producer Julian Blaustein, said North had to pass a street called &quot;Baroda&quot; every day going to work and indicated &quot;I think that&#x27;s how that was born.&quot; The film historian Steven Jay Rubin recalled an interview he had with North when he asked the question, &quot;What is the direct translation of Klaatu Barada Nikto, and Edmund North said to me &#x27;There&#x27;s hope for Earth, if the scientists can be reached&#x27;.&quot; Director Robert Wise clearly remembered the phrase for when he was awarded the American Film Institute&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997, he ended his acceptance speech with the phrase: &quot;Klaatu barada nikto&quot;, which tonight means: &quot;Thank you from the bottom of my heart.&quot;

<doc id="73423" wikidata="Q1936875" url="?curid=73423" title="Dead Birds (1963 film)">
<text>Dead Birds is a 1963 American documentary film by Robert Gardner about the ritual warfare cycle of the Dugum Dani people who live in the Baliem Valley in present-day Highland Papua province (then a part of Papua province known as &quot;Irian Jaya&quot;) on the western half of the island of New Guinea in Indonesia. The film presents footage of battles between the Willihiman-Wallalua confederation (-) of Gutelu alliance () and the Wittaia alliance () with scenes of the funeral of a small boy killed by a raiding party, the women&#x27;s work that goes on while battles continue, and the wait for enemy to appear. In 1964 the film received the Grand Prize &quot;Marzocco d&#x27;Oro&quot; at the 5th &quot;Festival dei Popoli rassegna internazionale del film etnografico e sociologico&quot; (&quot;Festival of the Peoples International Film Festival&quot;) in Florence, Italy, the Robert J. Flaherty Award given by the City College of New York, and was a featured film at the Melbourne Film Festival (now Melbourne International Film Festival). In 1998, &quot;Dead Birds&quot; was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and recommended for preservation. &quot;Dead Birds&quot; has come to hold canonical status among ethnographic films.

==Synopsis==
The film&#x27;s theme is the encounter that all people must have with death, as told in a Dugum Dani myth of the origins of death that bookends the film. The film uses a nonlinear narrative structure of parallel or braided narrative that traces three individuals through a season of three deaths and one near-death as relayed by an expository voiceover that describes scenes and the thoughts of the film&#x27;s protagonists. The film&#x27;s establishing shot, an extreme long shot, tilts and pans over the Baliem valley from left to right, following the flight of a bird across the village, its cultivated fields, and the fighting ground. A voiceover describes the great race between a bird and a snake which was to determine the lives of human beings: Should men shed their skins and live forever like snakes, or die like birds? The bird won: the fate of humans is death. Abruptly the sounds and sights of a funeral envelope the screen. Weyak, an adult man, farms, guards the frontier, and creates a complex knotted strap that will be presented to another at a funeral as Laca (or Laka), his wife, harvests sweet potatoes and goes to make salt with other women of the community. The small boy Pua tends pigs, explores nature, and plays with his friends. Enemy announce their intentions and the men come to the fighting ground, while the women continue to the salt grounds and Pua plays and tends his pigs. One fighter is wounded, it begins to rain, and the battle ends. &quot;Dead Birds&quot; now focuses on the relationship of the living to the ghosts and the rituals that placate them and keep them away from the village. As a pig ritual is planned and pigs are slaughtered, news comes that Pua&#x27;s little friend Weyakhe has been killed. The next sequence details Weyakhe&#x27;s funeral ceremony. Laca receives the funeral strap: Weyak does not want to touch it. He heads to his guard tower. In the distance, the enemy dance to celebrate this victory over Weyak&#x27;s group. The victory does not last long, for Weyak&#x27;s people kill a man who tried to steal a pig. Now the victors celebrate with their own dance. Scenes of the celebration are intercut with those of Weyak completing his weaving. As dusk closes in the camera and voiceover lingers on the celebration, on birds, and death.

== Production ==


Robert Gardner sought to film the last days of indigenous warfare in western New Guinea and accordingly organized the Harvard-Peabody Expedition (1961–65) which brought together a multidisciplinary team to collect data on various aspects of war and culture in the Baliem Valley of western New Guinea. In addition to filmmaker Gardner, team members included Jan Broekhuijse (anthropologist), Karl Heider (anthropologist), Peter Matthiesson (naturalist), and Michael Rockefeller (sound). Gardner carried out the filming from the team&#x27;s arrival in early 1961 while Rockefeller captured samples of wild sound for later use, as the filming did not use the then-new synchronous sound technology. Gardner composed the film narrative and edited the raw footage into the film after his return to the United States in August, 1961. The sound used in the film was post-synchronized from Rockefeller&#x27;s samples along with the added voiceover and composed narrative of the film. In line with similar works of ethnographic film at this time, some of the scenes in the film were composed out of shots filmed at different times.

=== Companion works ===

Research conducted for the film and in conjunction with it resulted in several companion works and related publications by Gardner and members of the Harvard-Peabody Expedition. Robert Gardner and Karl Heider&#x27;s book &quot;Gardens of War&quot; detailed the filmmaking and aspects of Dani culture relating to the film&#x27;s themes . A recent work by Gardner and Charles Warren described the making of this film. Karl G. Heider authored &quot;The Dani of West Irian: an Ethnographic Companion to the Film Dead Birds&quot;, ethnographic monographs, and film shorts. Peter Matthiessen separately wrote about the Dugum Dani and Baliem Valley in his book &quot;Under the Mountain Wall: a Chronicle of Two Seasons in the Stone Age.&quot;

== Background ==
&quot;Dead Birds&quot; reflects the concerns of anthropology emergent by the early 1960s relating to the practice of warfare in non-state level societies. The film also fits the-then dominant paradigm of structural-functionalism that emphasized demonstrating how diverse characteristics fit into the larger pattern of the culture. &quot;Dead Birds&quot; has been taken to exemplify the approach of anthropological holism as it knits together small and seemingly insignificant moments and actions, with those of great cultural significance.

== Release ==
The film was first shown at an evening meeting of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences held at the Cohen Arts Center at Tufts University, Boston, on Nov. 13, 1963. It was first distributed by Contemporary Films at 267 West 25th Street, New York.

==Reception==
Since the film&#x27;s release, some reviewers have praised filmmaker Gardner&#x27;s presentation as poetic and cinematographic, while others have criticized it as lacking a clear scientific and ethnographic focus. Reviewers have frequently remarked on its evocation of a Dani fable and its supporting shots of birds. The most-noted visual is the long take of a bird soaring over the Baliem Valley that is the film&#x27;s establishing shot. Reviewers point out that the film foregrounds Dugum Dani understandings of the world. Others complained that the film gave short shrift to data on the culture such as the kinship system and food production. Though stylistically impressive, &quot;Dead Birds&quot; has been criticized with respect to its authenticity. The characters who speak in the film are never subtitled, and even then the voice itself is not always what it seems. What the audience perceives as Weyak&#x27;s voice is actually a post-filming dub of Karl G. Heider speaking Dani. Gardner himself did not speak Dani, and so all his interpretations of events are second-hand. The battle sequences are made up of many shots taken during different battles and stitched together to give the appearance of temporal unity. The apparent continuity stems from the post-synchronized sound, and in fact all the sound in the film is post-synched. Heider, himself, admits in his book &quot;Ethnographic Film&quot;, that some of the battle films were edited out of sequence, intercut with a scene of the women at the salt pool, which was filmed at a different time than the battle sequences.

<doc id="73425" wikidata="Q201674" url="?curid=73425" title="The Deer Hunter">
<text>The Deer Hunter is a 1978 American epic war drama film co-written and directed by Michael Cimino about a trio of Slavic-American steelworkers whose lives are upended after fighting in the Vietnam War. The soldiers are played by Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage, with John Cazale (in his final role), Meryl Streep, and George Dzundza in supporting roles. The story takes place in Clairton, Pennsylvania, a working-class town on the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh, and in Vietnam.

The film was based in part on an unproduced screenplay called &quot;The Man Who Came to Play&quot; by Louis A. Garfinkle and Quinn K. Redeker about Las Vegas and Russian roulette. Producer Michael Deeley, who bought the script, hired Cimino who, with Deric Washburn, rewrote the script, taking the Russian roulette element and placing it in the Vietnam War. The film went over-budget and over-schedule, costing $15 million. Its production company EMI Films released it internationally, while Universal Pictures handled its domestic distribution.

&quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; received acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise for Cimino&#x27;s direction, the performances of its cast, its screenplay, realistic themes and tones, and cinematography. It was also successful at the box office, grossing $49 million. At the 51st Academy Awards, it was nominated for nine Academy Awards, and won five: Best Picture, Best Director for Cimino, Best Supporting Actor for Walken, Best Sound, and Best Film Editing. It was Meryl Streep&#x27;s first Academy Award nomination (for Best Supporting Actress).

&quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; has been included on lists of the best films ever made, including being named the 53rd-greatest American film of all time by the American Film Institute in 2007 in their 10th Anniversary Edition of the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies list. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1996, as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
In 1968, three friends in a tight-knit Slavic American community in Western PennsylvaniaMike Vronsky, Steven Pushkov, and Nikanor &quot;Nick&quot; Chevotarevichwork in a steel mill and hunt deer with their co-workers Stanley (&quot;Stan&quot;) and Peter &quot;Axel&quot; Axelrod, along with friend and bartender John Welsh. Mike, Steven, and Nick are preparing to leave for military service in Vietnam. Steven is engaged to Angela Ludhjduravic, who was secretly impregnated by another man. Mike and Nick are close friends who live together and both love Linda, who will be moving into their home to escape from her alcoholic father. After catching the bouquet at Steven and Angela&#x27;s wedding, Linda accepts Nick&#x27;s spontaneous marriage proposal. Nick implores Mike to ensure he returns from Vietnam. Mike, Nick, and their friends go on a final hunting trip. Mike kills a deer with a single shot.

In 1969 in Vietnam, Mike, now a Green Beret, happens upon Nick and Steven, who land in a village during an Air Assault mission. The three are soon imprisoned by the Viet Cong in a cage along a river and forced to participate in games of Russian roulette while the jailers bet. Steven fires his round at the ceiling and is forced into a cage with rats and previous victims of the jailers. Mike convinces his captors to put three bullets into the revolver&#x27;s cylinder. Mike kills two captors as he and Nick overpower their captors; however, Nick is wounded in the leg. They quickly escape, rescuing Steven in the process.

The trio floats down the river on a felled tree trunk, but Nick and Steven are weak from their wounds. They are found by an American helicopter. Nick boards and is rescued, but Steven falls back into the river while trying to hold onto the helicopter skids, and Mike drops down to help him. With Steven breaking both of his legs on the river’s rock bottom, Mike carries him until they join refugees and a South Vietnamese Army convoy fleeing to Saigon.

There, Nick is treated at a U.S. military hospital. Once released, Nick, now suffering from PTSD, wanders into a gambling den. French businessman Julien Grinda persuades him to come inside. Upset, Nick interrupts a game of Russian roulette, pulling the trigger on himself. Mike happens to be present as a spectator, but Nick and Julien hurriedly leave.

Sometime later, Mike returns home, but cannot integrate into civilian life. He avoids a welcome-home party, opting to stay alone in a hotel. He visits Linda and learns that Nick has deserted. Mike then visits Angela, who is now a mother, but has slipped into catatonia following the return of Steven, who has had both his legs amputated. Stan, Axel, and John understand nothing of war or what Mike has experienced. Linda and Mike find comfort in each other&#x27;s company. During a hunting trip, Mike stops himself from shooting a deer and returns to the cabin where he finds Stan cavalierly threatening Axel with his pistol. Mike takes it, chambering a single round, and triggers an empty chamber at Stan&#x27;s head.

Mike visits Steven at a veterans&#x27; hospital; in addition to his legs, he has lost the use of an arm. Steven refuses to come home, saying he no longer fits in. He tells Mike that he has been regularly receiving large sums of money from Vietnam. Mike intuits that Nick is the source of these payments, and forces Steven to return home to Angela. Mike returns to Vietnam in search of Nick. Wandering around Saigon, which is now in a state of chaos shortly before its fall, Mike finds Julien and persuades him to take him to the gambling den. Mike finds himself facing Nick, who has become a professional in the macabre game and fails to recognize Mike. Mike attempts to bring Nick back to reason by invoking memories of their hunting trips back home, but Nick maintains his indifference. However, during a game of Russian roulette between Mike and Nick, Nick recalls Mike&#x27;s &quot;one shot&quot; method and smiles before pulling the trigger and killing himself.

Mike and his friends attend Nick&#x27;s funeral, and the atmosphere at their local bar is dim and silent. Moved by emotion, John begins to sing &quot;God Bless America&quot; in honor of Nick, as everyone joins in.

==Cast==
* Robert De Niro as Staff Sergeant Mikhail Vronsky (&quot;Mike&quot;). After Roy Scheider withdrew from the cast two weeks before the start of filming over creative differences, producer Michael Deeley pursued De Niro, who was paid one million dollars for the role, in search of star power to sell a film with a &quot;gruesome-sounding storyline and a barely known director.&quot; De Niro later said: &quot;I liked the script, and [Cimino] had done a lot of prep. I was impressed.&quot; He prepared by socializing with steelworkers in local bars and by visiting their homes. De Niro claimed this was his most physically exhausting film and that the sequence in which Mike visits Steven in the hospital was the most emotional scene of his career.
* Christopher Walken as Corporal Nikanor Chevotarevich (&quot;Nick&quot;). His performance won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.
* John Savage as Corporal Steven Pushkov
* John Cazale as Stanley (&quot;Stan&quot;/&quot;Stosh&quot;). All scenes involving Cazale, who had terminal cancer, were filmed first. Because of his illness, the studio wanted to dismiss him, but Streep, with whom he was in a romantic relationship, and Cimino threatened to withdraw from the project if Cazale was released. He was also uninsurable, and according to Streep, De Niro paid for his insurance because he wanted Cazale in the film. This was Cazale&#x27;s last film, as he died shortly after filming wrapped. Cazale never saw the finished film.
* Meryl Streep as Linda. In the screenplay, Streep&#x27;s role was negligible, but Cimino explained the role to her and suggested that she write her own lines.
* George Dzundza as John Welsh
* as Julien Grinda
* Shirley Stoler as Steven&#x27;s mother
* Chuck Aspegren&lt;ref name=&quot;gi/CA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ha/cA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as Peter Axelrod (&quot;Axel&quot;). Aspegren was not an actor; he was the foreman at an East Chicago steel factory visited early in preproduction by De Niro and Cimino. They were so impressed with him that they offered him the role. He was the second person to be cast in the film after De Niro.
* Rutanya Alda as Angela Ludhjduravic-Pushkov
* Paul D&#x27;Amato as Sergeant
* Amy Wright as Bridesmaid
* Joe Grifasi as Bandleader
* John F. Buchmelter III as a bar patron. Buchmelter was a steel worker whom Cimino wanted in order to lend the film a sense of authenticity.
* Somsak Sengvilai as the VC Referee. Casting local actors to play the stone-faced Referee during the famous Russian-Roulette scene proved troublesome, as many refused to authentically slap De Niro and Walken. When Sengvilai was cast, he was noted as holding a particular disdain towards Americans, and the slaps he delivered in the scene were genuine.

While Deeley was pleased with the revised script, he was still concerned about being able to sell the film. He later wrote: &quot;We still had to get millions out of a major studio, as well as convince our markets around the world that they should buy it before it was finished. I needed someone with the caliber of Robert De Niro.&quot; Deeley felt that De Niro was &quot;the right age, apparently tough as hell, and immensely talented.&quot;

De Niro, who knew many actors in New York, brought Streep and Cazale to the attention of Cimino and Deeley. De Niro also accompanied Cimino to scout locations for the steel mill sequence and rehearsed with the actors to use the workshops as a bonding process.

Each of the six principal male characters carried a photo in his back pocket depicting them all together as children in order to enhance the sense of camaraderie among them. Cimino instructed the props department to fashion complete photo IDs for each of them, including driver licenses and medical cards, to enhance each actor&#x27;s sense of his character.

==Production==
===Preproduction===
There has been considerable debate and controversy about how &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; was initially developed and written. Director and cowriter Michael Cimino, writer Deric Washburn and producers Barry Spikings and Michael Deeley all have different versions of how the film came to be. 

====Development====
In 1968, record company EMI formed a new company, EMI Films, headed by producers Barry Spikings and Deeley. Deeley purchased the first draft of a spec script called &quot;The Man Who Came to Play&quot;, written by Louis A. Garfinkle and Quinn K. Redeker, for $19,000. It was about people who go to Las Vegas to play Russian roulette. Deeley later wrote: &quot;The screenplay had struck me as brilliant, but it wasn&#x27;t complete. The trick would be to find a way to turn a very clever piece of writing into a practical, realizable film.&quot; When the film was being planned during the mid-1970s, the Vietnam War was still a taboo subject with all major Hollywood studios. According to Deeley, the standard response was that &quot;no American would want to see a picture about Vietnam.&quot;

After consulting various Hollywood agents, Deeley found Cimino and was impressed by Cimino&#x27;s television commercial work and crime film &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot; (1974). Cimino was confident that he could further develop the principal characters of &quot;The Man Who Came to Play&quot; without losing the essence of the original. According to Deeley, Cimino questioned the need for the Russian roulette element of the script, but Redeker fervently fought to preserve it. Cimino and Deeley discussed the work needed in the first part of the script, and Cimino believed that he could develop the stories of the main characters in the film&#x27;s first 20 minutes.

====Screenplay====
Cimino worked for six weeks with Deric Washburn on the script. Cimino and Washburn had previously collaborated with Steven Bochco on the screenplay for &quot;Silent Running&quot; (1972). According to producer Barry Spikings, Cimino said that he wanted to work again with Washburn. According to Deeley, he only heard from an office rumor that Washburn was contracted by Cimino to work on the script. &quot;Whether Cimino hired Washburn as his sub-contractor or as a co-writer was constantly being obfuscated,&quot; wrote Deeley, &quot;and there were some harsh words between them later on, or so I was told.&quot;

=====Cimino&#x27;s claim=====
According to Cimino, he would call Washburn while on the road scouting for locations and feed him notes on dialogue and story. Upon reviewing Washburn&#x27;s draft, Cimino said, &quot;I came back and read it and I just could not believe what I read. It was like it was written by somebody who was ... mentally deranged.&quot; Cimino confronted Washburn at the Sunset Marquis in LA about the draft, and Washburn supposedly replied that he couldn&#x27;t take the pressure and had to go home. Cimino then fired Washburn. Cimino later claimed to have written the entire screenplay himself. Washburn&#x27;s response to Cimino&#x27;s comments was, &quot;It&#x27;s all nonsense. It&#x27;s lies. I didn&#x27;t have a single drink the entire time I was working on the script.&quot;

=====Washburn&#x27;s claim=====
According to Washburn, he and Cimino spent three days together in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;; nor did he do any research. &quot;I had a month, that was it,&quot; he explains. &quot;The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all I had to do was watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were out there in the field with the guys. I mean, they had stuff that you wouldn&#x27;t dream of seeing about Iraq.&quot; When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; who went on to produce two more of Cimino&#x27;s later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, &quot;We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, &#x27;Well, Deric, it&#x27;s fuck-off time.&#x27; I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he&#x27;ll go away. I was so tired, I didn&#x27;t care. I&#x27;d been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job.&quot;

=====Deeley&#x27;s reaction to the revised script=====
Deeley felt the revised script, now called &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, broke fresh ground for the project. The protagonist in the Redeker/Garfinkle script, Merle, was an individual who sustained a bad injury in active service and was damaged psychologically by his violent experiences, but was nevertheless a tough character with strong nerves and guts. Cimino and Washburn&#x27;s revised script distilled the three aspects of Merle&#x27;s personality and separated them out into three distinct characters. They became three old friends who grew up in the same small industrial town and worked in the same steel mill, and in due course were drafted together to Vietnam. In the original script, the roles of Merle (later renamed Mike) and Nick were reversed in the last half of the film. Nick returns home to Linda, while Mike remains in Vietnam, sends money home to help Steven, and meets his tragic fate at the Russian roulette table.

A Writers&#x27; Guild arbitration process awarded Washburn sole &quot;Screenplay by&quot; credit. Garfinkle and Redeker were given a shared &quot;Story by&quot; credit with Cimino and Washburn. Deeley felt the story credits for Garfinkle and Redeker &quot;did them less than justice.&quot; Cimino contested the results of the arbitration. &quot;In their Nazi wisdom,&quot; added Cimino, &quot;[they] didn&#x27;t give me the credit because I would be producer, director and writer.&quot; All four writers—Cimino, Washburn, Garfinkle, and Redeker—received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay for the film.

===Filming===
&quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; began principal photography on June 20, 1977. It was the first feature film depicting the Vietnam War to be filmed in Thailand. All scenes were shot on location (no sound stages). &quot;There was discussion about shooting the film on a back lot, but the material demanded more realism,&quot; says Spikings. The cast and crew watched large amounts of news footage from the war to ensure authenticity. The film was shot over six months. The scenes of the &quot;Clairton, Pennsylvania&quot; comprise footage shot in eight different towns in three states: West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.&lt;ref name=&quot;mL/Dh&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The film&#x27;s initial budget was $8.5 million.

Meryl Streep accepted the role of the &quot;vague, stock girlfriend&quot; to remain for the duration of filming with John Cazale, who had been diagnosed with lung cancer. De Niro had spotted Streep in her stage production of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; and suggested she play his girlfriend Linda. Meryl Streep wrote all of her lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;fnn/MS77c&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Streep is said to have accepted the role, primarily, to be with Cazale.&lt;ref name=&quot;9h/streep-gummer&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the beginning of principal photography, Deeley met with the film&#x27;s appointed line producer, Robert Relyea, whom Deeley hired after meeting him on the set of &quot;Bullitt&quot; (1968) and being impressed with his experience. However, Relyea declined the job, refusing to disclose his reason why. Deeley suspected that Relyea sensed in director Cimino something that would have made production difficult. As a result, Cimino was acting without the day-to-day supervision of a producer.

Because Deeley was busy overseeing the production of Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Convoy&quot; (1978), he hired John Peverall to oversee Cimino&#x27;s shoot. Peverall&#x27;s expertise with budgeting and scheduling made him a natural successor to Relyea, and Peverall knew enough about the picture to be elevated to producer status. &quot;John is a straightforward Cornishman who had worked his way up to become a production supervisor,&quot; wrote Deeley, &quot;and we employed him as EMI&#x27;s watchman on certain pictures.&quot;

====The wedding scenes====
The wedding scenes were filmed at historic St. Theodosius Russian Orthodox Cathedral in the Tremont neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;ref name=&quot;LL/dH&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They took five days to film. St. Theodosius&#x27; Father Stephen Kopestonsky was cast as the priest. The reception scene was filmed at nearby Lemko Association Hall. The amateur extras cast for the crowded wedding-dance sequences drank real liquor and beer. The scenes were filmed in the summer, in 95 °F (35 °C) weather,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wi/DHf&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but were set in the fall. To accomplish a fall look, individual leaves were removed from deciduous trees. Zsigmond also had to desaturate the colors of the exterior shots, partly in camera and partly in laboratory processing.

The production manager asked each of the extras portraying Russian immigrants to bring to the location a gift-wrapped box to double for wedding presents. The manager figured that if the extras did this, not only would the production save time and money, but the gifts would look more authentic. Once the unit unwrapped and the extras disappeared, the crew discovered to their amusement that the boxes weren&#x27;t empty but filled with real presents, from china to silverware. &quot;Who got to keep all these wonderful offerings,&quot; wrote Deeley, &quot;is a mystery I never quite fathomed.&quot;

Cimino originally claimed that the wedding scene would take up 21 minutes of screen time; in the end, it took 51 minutes. Deeley believes that Cimino always planned to make this prologue last for an hour, and &quot;the plan was to be advanced by stealth rather than straight dealing.&quot;

At this point in the production, nearly halfway through principal photography, Cimino was already over-budget, and producer Spikings could tell from the script that shooting the extended scene could sink the project.

====The bar and the steel mill====
The bar was specially constructed in an empty storefront in Mingo Junction, Ohio for $25,000; it later became an actual saloon for local steel mill workers. U.S. Steel allowed filming inside its Cleveland mill, including placing the actors around the furnace floor, only after securing a $5 million insurance policy. Other filming took place in Pittsburgh.

====Hunting the deer====
The first deer to be shot was depicted in a &quot;gruesome close-up&quot;, although he was hit only with a tranquilizer dart. This was not a whitetail buck, which is native to Pennsylvania, but a red deer native to Eurasia. The stag that Michael lets escape was the same one later used on TV commercials for The Hartford.

====Vietnam and the Russian roulette scenes====
The Viet Cong Russian roulette scenes were shot with real rats and mosquitoes, as the three principals (De Niro, Walken, and Savage) were tied up in bamboo cages erected along the River Kwai. The woman who was given the task of casting extras in Thailand had much difficulty finding a local to play the vicious-looking individual who runs the game. The first actor hired turned out to be incapable of slapping De Niro in the face. The casting agent then found a local Thai man, Somsak Sengvilai, who held a particular dislike of Americans, and so cast him. De Niro suggested that Walken be slapped by one of the guards without any warning, and Walken&#x27;s reaction was genuine. Producer Deeley has said that Cimino shot the brutal Vietcong Russian roulette scenes brilliantly and more efficiently than any other part of the film.

De Niro and Savage performed their own stunts in the fall into the river, filming the drop 15 times in two days. During the helicopter stunt, the skids caught on the rope bridge as the helicopter rose, threatening to seriously injure De Niro and Savage. The actors gestured and shouted to the crew in the helicopter to warn them. Footage of this is included in the film.

According to Cimino, De Niro requested a live cartridge in the revolver for the scene in which he subjects John Cazale&#x27;s character to an impromptu game of Russian roulette, to heighten the intensity of the situation. Cazale agreed without protest, but obsessively rechecked the gun before each take to be sure that the live round was not in the next chamber.

While appearing later in the film, the first scenes shot on arrival in Thailand were the hospital sequences between Walken and the military doctor. Deeley believed that this scene was &quot;the spur that would earn him an Academy Award&quot;.

In the final scene in the gambling den between Mike and Nick, Cimino had Walken and De Niro improvise in one take. His direction to his actors: &quot;You put the gun to your head, Chris, you shoot, you fall over and Bobby cradles your head.&quot;

===Post-production===
By this point, &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; had cost $13 million and the film still had to go through an arduous post-production. Film editor Peter Zinner was given of printed film to edit, a monumental task at the time. Producers Spikings and Deeley were pleased with the first cut, which ran for three and a half hours. &quot;We were thrilled by what we saw,&quot; wrote Deeley, &quot;and knew that within the three and a half hours we watched there was a riveting film.&quot;

Executives from Universal, including Lew Wasserman and Sid Sheinberg, were not very enthusiastic. &quot;I think they were shocked,&quot; recalled Spikings. &quot;What really upset them was &#x27;God Bless America&#x27;. Sheinberg thought it was anti-American. He was vehement. He said something like &#x27;You&#x27;re poking a stick in the eye of America.&#x27; They really didn&#x27;t like the movie. And they certainly didn&#x27;t like it at three hours and two minutes.&quot; Deeley was not surprised by the Universal response: &quot;&quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; was a United Artists sort of picture, whereas &quot;Convoy&quot; was more in the style of Universal. I&#x27;d muddled and sold the wrong picture to each studio.&quot; Deeley did agree with Universal that the film needed to be shorter, not just because of pacing but also to ensure commercial success. &quot;A picture under two and a half hours can scrape three shows a day,&quot; wrote Deeley, &quot;but at three hours you&#x27;ve lost one third of your screenings and one third of your income for the cinemas, distributors, and profit participants.&quot;

Universal president Thom Mount said: &quot;This was just a... continuing nightmare from the day Michael finished the picture to the day we released it. That was simply because he was wedded to everything he shot. The movie was endless. It was &quot;The Deer Hunter and the Hunter and the Hunter&quot;. The wedding sequence was a cinematic event all unto its own.&quot; Mount says he turned to Verna Fields, Universal&#x27;s head of post-production. &quot;I sicced Verna on Cimino,&quot; Mount says. &quot;Verna was no slouch. She started to turn the heat up on Michael, and he started screeching and yelling.&quot;

Zinner eventually cut the film to . Cimino later fired Zinner when he discovered that Zinner was editing the wedding scenes. Zinner eventually won the Best Editing Oscar for &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. Regarding his clashes with Cimino, Zinner stated: &quot;Michael Cimino and I had our differences at the end, but he kissed me when we both got Academy Awards.&quot; Cimino later commented in &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, &quot;[Zinner] was a moron ... I cut &quot;Deer Hunter&quot; myself.&quot;

====Sound design====
&quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; was Cimino&#x27;s first film to use the Dolby noise-reduction system. &quot;What Dolby does,&quot; replied Cimino, &quot;is to give you the ability to create a &quot;density of detail&quot; of sound—a richness so you can demolish the wall separating the viewer from the film. You can come close to demolishing the screen.&quot; It took five months to mix the soundtrack. One short battle sequence—200 feet of film in the final cut—took five days to dub. Another sequence recreated the 1975 American evacuation of Saigon; Cimino brought the film&#x27;s composer, Stanley Myers, out to the location to listen to the auto, tank, and jeep horns as the sequence was being photographed. The result, according to Cimino: Myers composed the music for that scene in the same key as the horn sounds, so the music and the sound effects would blend with the images to create one jarring, desolate experience.

====Previews====
Both the long and short versions were previewed to Midwestern audiences, although there are differing accounts among Cimino, Deeley, and Spikings as to how the previews panned out. Director Cimino claims he bribed the projectionist to interrupt the shorter version, in order to obtain better reviews of the longer one. According to producer Spikings, Wasserman let EMI&#x27;s CEO Bernard Delfont decide between the two and chose Cimino&#x27;s longer cut. Deeley claims that the two-and-a-half-hour version tested had a better response.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; was released on audio CD on October 25, 1990.

===Selected tracks===
* Stanley Myers&#x27; &quot;Cavatina&quot; (also known as &quot;He Was Beautiful&quot;), performed by classical guitarist John Williams, is commonly known as &quot;The Theme from The Deer Hunter&quot;. According to producer Deeley, he discovered that the piece was originally written for a film called &quot;The Walking Stick&quot; (1970) and, as a result, had to pay the original purchaser an undisclosed sum.
* &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot;, a 1967 hit song, sung by Frankie Valli. It is played in John&#x27;s bar when all of the friends sing along and at the wedding reception. According to Cimino, the actors sang along to a recording of the song as it was played instead of singing to a beat track, a standard filmmaking practice. Cimino felt that would make the sing-along seem more real.
*During the wedding ceremonies and party, the Russian Orthodox songs such as &quot;Slava&quot;, and Russian folk songs such as &quot;Korobushka&quot; and &quot;Katyusha&quot;, are played.
*The final passage from Kamarinskaya by Mikhail Glinka is heard briefly when the men are driving through the mountains. Also, a part of the opening section of the same work is heard during the second hunt when Michael is about to shoot the stag.
*Russian Orthodox funeral music is also employed during Nick&#x27;s funeral scene, mainly &quot;Vechnaya Pamyat&quot;, which means &quot;eternal memory&quot;.

==Theatrical release==

The producer Allan Carr took over its marketing and convinced the studio to allow the film to be played on the Z Channel before theatrical release.&lt;ref name=&quot;afi/MC/dH&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; debuted at one theater each in New York and Los Angeles for a week on December 8, 1978. The release strategy was to qualify the film for Oscar consideration and close after a week to build interest.

After the Oscar nominations, Universal widened the distribution to include major cities, building up to a full-scale release on February 23, 1979, just following the Oscars. This film pioneered a new release pattern for so-called prestige pictures that screen only at the end of the year to qualify for Academy Award recognition. The film eventually grossed $48.9 million at the US box office.

CBS paid $3.5 million for three runs of the film. The network later cancelled the acquisition on the contractually permitted grounds of the film containing too much violence for US network transmission; the Russian Roulette scene was deemed controversial.

==Home media==
&quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; has twice been released on DVD in America. The first 1998 issue was by Universal, with no extra features and a non-anamorphic transfer, and has since been discontinued. A second version, part of the &quot;Legacy Series&quot;, was released as a two-disc set on September 6, 2005, with an anamorphic transfer of the film. The set features a cinematographer&#x27;s commentary by Vilmos Zsigmond, deleted and extended scenes, and production notes.

The Region 2 version of &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, released in the UK and Japan, features a commentary track from director Michael Cimino.

The film was released on HD DVD on December 26, 2006.

StudioCanal released the film on the Blu-ray format in countries other than the United States on March 11, 2009. It was released on Blu-ray in the U.S. on March 6, 2012.

On May 26, 2020, Shout! Factory released the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray featuring a new Dolby Vision transfer.

==Analysis==

===Controversy over Russian roulette===

One of the most talked-about sequences in the film, the Viet Cong&#x27;s use of Russian roulette with POWs, was criticized as being contrived and unrealistic since there were no documented cases of Russian roulette in the Vietnam War. Associated Press reporter Peter Arnett, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the war, wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;In its 20 years of war, there was not a single recorded case of Russian roulette ... The central metaphor of the movie is simply a bloody lie.&quot;

Cimino countered that his film was not political, polemical, literally accurate, or posturing for any particular point of view. Nevertheless, he also claimed he had news clippings from Singapore that confirm Russian roulette was used during the war, without specifying which article.

====Critics&#x27; response====
In his review, Roger Ebert defended the artistic license of Russian roulette, arguing &quot;it is the organizing symbol of the film: Anything you can believe about the game, about its deliberately random violence, about how it touches the sanity of men forced to play it, will apply to the war as a whole. It is a brilliant symbol because, in the context of this story, it makes any ideological statement about the war superfluous.&quot;

Film critic and biographer David Thomson also agrees that the film works despite the controversy: &quot;There were complaints that the North Vietnamese had not employed Russian roulette. It was said that the scenes in Saigon were fanciful or imagined. It was also suggested that De Niro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage were too old to have enlisted for Vietnam (Savage, the youngest of the three, was thirty). Three decades later [written in 2008], &#x27;imagination&#x27; seems to have stilled those worries ... and &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; is one of the great American films.&quot;

In her review, Pauline Kael wrote &quot;The Vietcong are treated in the standard inscrutable-evil Oriental style of the Japanese in the Second World War movies ... The impression a viewer gets is that if we did some bad things there we did them ruthlessly but impersonally; the Vietcong were cruel and sadistic.&quot;

In his &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article &quot;The Vietnam Oscars&quot;, Peter Biskind wrote that the political agenda of &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; was something of a mystery: &quot;It may have been more a by-product of Hollywood myopia, the demands of the war-film genre, garden-variety American parochialism, and simple ignorance than it was the pre-meditated right-wing road map it seemed to many.&quot;

====Cast and crew response====
According to Christopher Walken, the historical context was not paramount: &quot;In the making of it, I don&#x27;t remember anyone ever mentioning Vietnam!&quot; De Niro added to this sentiment: &quot;Whether [the film&#x27;s vision of the war] actually happened or not, it&#x27;s something you could imagine very easily happening. Maybe it did. I don&#x27;t know. All&#x27;s fair in love and war.&quot; Producer Spikings, while proud of the film, regrets the way the Vietnamese were portrayed. &quot;I don&#x27;t think any of us meant it to be exploitive,&quot; Spikings said. &quot;But I think we were ... ignorant. I can&#x27;t think of a better word for it. I didn&#x27;t realize how badly we&#x27;d behaved to the Vietnamese people ...&quot;

Producer Deeley, on the other hand, was quick to defend Cimino&#x27;s comments on the nature and motives of the film: &quot;&quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; wasn&#x27;t really &#x27;about&#x27; Vietnam. It was something very different. It wasn&#x27;t about drugs or the collapse of the morale of the soldiers. It was about how individuals respond to pressure: different men reacting quite differently. The film was about three steel workers in extraordinary circumstances. &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; is surreal. &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; is a parable ... Men who fight and lose an unworthy war, face some obvious and unpalatable choices. They can blame their leaders.. or they can blame themselves. Self-blame has been a great burden for many war veterans. So how does a soldier come to terms with his defeat and yet still retain his self-respect? One way is to present the conquering enemy as so inhuman, and the battle between the good guys (us) and the bad guys (them) so uneven, as to render defeat irrelevant. Inhumanity was the theme of &quot;The Deer Hunter&#x27;s&quot; portrayal of the North Vietnamese prison guards forcing American POWs to play Russian roulette. The audience&#x27;s sympathy with prisoners who (quite understandably) cracked thus completes the chain. Accordingly, some veterans who suffered in that war found the Russian roulette a valid allegory.&quot;

===Director Cimino&#x27;s autobiographical intent===
Cimino frequently referred to &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; as a &quot;personal&quot; and &quot;autobiographical&quot; film, although later investigation by journalists like Tom Buckley of &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; revealed inaccuracies in Cimino&#x27;s accounts and reported background.

===Male friendship ===
&quot;AFI&quot;″s Movie Club says &quot;the film portrays male friendship in an atypical way for the time&quot; and asks: &quot;how does the friendship of the characters played by Robert De Niro, John Savage, Christopher Walken and John Cazale evolve throughout the film?&quot;

===Coda of &quot;God Bless America&quot;===
The final scene in which all the main characters gather and sing &quot;God Bless America&quot; became a subject of heated debate among critics when the film was released. It raised the question of whether this conclusion was meant ironically or not – &quot;as a critique of patriotism or a paean to it&quot;. Cimino later spoke of his intentions for the scene:

&quot;The ending is really, not meant to be so much a statement of patriotism, but a statement of communion. When people are in trouble, as they are when they&#x27;re very troubled and sick inside, spiritually very sick, they need, sometimes to do something together. In this case it&#x27;s make a sound. And they sing that song because it&#x27;s a song that every American child knows by heart, because you&#x27;re taught it in school. Everybody knows the words of &quot;God Bless America&quot;, and so it&#x27;s a communal sound, and they begin to sing the one song they all know from grade school on. And you never forget those words as long as you live. And so they sing... the one song they happen to know happens to be &quot;God Bless America&quot;, and it reunites them as a family. It becomes a family communion. Instead of a Last Supper, it becomes a first breakfast, if you will, of a new family. It is breakfast that they&#x27;re eating. It&#x27;s not the Last Supper, it&#x27;s the first breakfast.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Upon its release, &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; received acclaim from critics, who considered it the best American epic since Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot;. The film was praised for its depiction of realistic working-class settings and environment; Cimino&#x27;s direction; the performances of De Niro, Walken, Streep, Savage, Dzundza and Cazale; the symphonic shifts of tone and pacing in moving from America to Vietnam; the tension during the Russian roulette scenes; and the themes of American disillusionment. The film holds an approval rating of 86% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 132 reviews, with an average score of 8.60/10. The consensus reads: &quot;Its greatness is blunted by its length and one-sided point of view, but the film&#x27;s weaknesses are overpowered by Michael Cimino&#x27;s sympathetic direction and a series of heartbreaking performances from Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, and Christopher Walken&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 90 out of 100 based on reviews from 18 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four out of four stars and called it &quot;one of the most emotionally shattering films ever made.&quot; Gene Siskel from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; praised the film, saying, &quot;This is a big film, dealing with big issues, made on a grand scale. Much of it, including some casting decisions, suggest inspiration by &quot;The Godfather&quot;.&quot; Leonard Maltin also gave the film four stars, calling it a &quot;sensitive, painful, evocative work&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; &quot;a big, awkward, crazily ambitious motion picture that comes as close to being a popular epic as any movie about this country since &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Its vision is that of an original, major new filmmaker.&quot; David Denby of &quot;New York&quot; called it &quot;an epic&quot; with &quot;qualities that we almost never see any more—range and power and breadth of experience.&quot; Jack Kroll of &quot;Time&quot; asserted it put director Cimino &quot;right at the center of film culture.&quot; Stephen Farber pronounced the film in &quot;New West&quot; magazine as &quot;the greatest anti-war movie since &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot;.&quot;

However, &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; was not without critical backlash. Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote a positive review with some reservations: &quot;[It is] a small minded film with greatness in it ... with an enraptured view of common life ... [but] enraging, because, despite its ambitiousness and scale, it has no more moral intelligence than the Eastwood action pictures.&quot; William Goldman, in his book &quot;Adventures in the Screen Trade&quot;, described &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; as a &quot;well-disguised comic-book movie&quot;. He wrote, &quot;I enjoyed it every bit as I used to be enthralled by Batman having it out with the Penguin — and precisely on that level.&quot;

Andrew Sarris wrote that the film was &quot;massively vague, tediously elliptical, and mysteriously hysterical ... It is perhaps significant that the actors remain more interesting than the characters they play.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum disparaged &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; as an &quot;Oscar-laden weepie about macho buddies&quot; and &quot;a disgusting account of what the evil Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans&quot;. John Simon of &quot;New York&quot; wrote: &quot;For all its pretensions to something newer and better, this film is only an extension of the old Hollywood war-movie lie. The enemy is still bestial and stupid, and no match for our purity and heroism; only we no longer wipe up the floor with him—rather, we litter it with his guts.&quot; In a review of &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; for &quot;Chicago&quot; magazine, Studs Terkel wrote that he was &quot;appalled by its shameless dishonesty,&quot; and that &quot;not since &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; has a non-Caucasian people been portrayed in so barbaric a fashion.&quot; Cimino&#x27;s dishonesty &quot;was to project a sadistic psyche not only onto &#x27;Charlie&#x27; but to all the Vietnamese portrayed.&quot;

Author Karina Longworth notes that Streep &quot;made a case for female empowerment by playing a woman to whom empowerment was a foreign concept—a normal lady from an average American small town, for whom subservience was the only thing she knew&quot;. She states that &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; &quot;evokes a version of dominant masculinity in which male friendship is a powerful force&quot;. It has a &quot;credibly humanist message&quot;, and that the &quot;slow study of the men in blissfully ignorant homeland machismo is crucial to it&quot;.

Despite its critical acclaim and awards, some critics derided what they considered the film&#x27;s simplistic, bigoted, and historically inaccurate depictions of the Viet Cong and America&#x27;s position in the Vietnam War. The central theme of the Viet Cong forcing American captives to play Russian roulette has been widely criticized as having no historical basis, a claim Cimino denied but did not refute with evidence.

During the 29th Berlin International Film Festival in 1979, the Soviet delegation expressed its indignation with the film which, in their opinion, insulted the Vietnamese people in numerous scenes. Other communist states also voiced their solidarity with the &quot;heroic people of Vietnam&quot;. They protested against the screening of the film and insisted that it violated the statutes of the festival because it in no way contributed to the &quot;improvement of mutual understanding between the peoples of the world&quot;. The ensuing domino effect led to the walk-outs of the Cubans, East Germans, Hungarians, Bulgarians, Poles and Czechoslovakians, and two members of the jury resigned in sympathy.

===Top-ten lists===
* 3rd—Roger Ebert, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. Ebert also placed &quot;Deer Hunter&quot; on his list of the best films of the 1970s.
* 3rd—Gene Siskel, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;

Academy Award-winning film director Miloš Forman and Academy Award-nominated actor Mickey Rourke consider &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; to be one of the greatest films of all time.

===Revisionism following &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;===
Cimino&#x27;s next film, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1980), debuted to lacerating reviews and took in only $3 million in ticket sales, effectively leaving United Artists bankrupt. The failure of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; led several critics to revise their positions on &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. Canby said in his famous review of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, &quot;[The film] fails so completely that you might suspect Mr. Cimino sold his soul to the Devil to obtain the success of &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, and the Devil has just come around to collect.&quot; Andrew Sarris wrote in his review of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a little surprised that many of the same critics who lionized Cimino for &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; have now thrown him to the wolves with equal enthusiasm.&quot; Sarris added, &quot;I was never taken in ... Hence, the stupidity and incoherence in &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; came as no surprise since very much the same stupidity and incoherence had been amply evident in &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;.&quot; In his book &quot;Final Cut: Dreams and Disaster in the Making of Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, Steven Bach wrote, &quot;critics seemed to feel obliged to go on the record about &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, to demonstrate that their critical credentials were un-besmirched by having been, as Andrew Sarris put it, &#x27;taken in.&#x27;&quot; Film critic Mark Kermode described &quot;Deer Hunter&quot; as &quot;a genuinely terrible film&quot;.

However, many critics, including David Thomson and A. O. Scott, maintain that &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; is still a great film, the power of which has not diminished.

==Awards==
===Lead-up to awards season===
Film producer and &quot;old-fashioned mogul&quot; Allan Carr used his networking abilities to promote &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. &quot;Exactly how Allan Carr came into &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;″s orbit I can no longer remember,&quot; recalled producer Deeley, &quot;but the picture became a crusade to him. He nagged, charmed, threw parties, he created word-of-mouth – everything that could be done in Hollywood to promote a project. Because he had no apparent motive for this promotion, it had an added power and legitimacy and it finally did start to penetrate the minds of the Universal&#x27;s sales people that they actually had in their hands something a bit more significant than the usual.&quot; Deeley added that Carr&#x27;s promotion of the film was influential in positioning &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; for Oscar nominations.

On the &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; special &quot;Oscar Preview for 1978&quot;, Roger Ebert correctly predicted that &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; would win for Best Picture while Gene Siskel predicted that &quot;Coming Home&quot; would win. However, Ebert incorrectly guessed that Robert De Niro would win for Best Actor for &quot;Deer Hunter&quot; and Jill Clayburgh would win for Best Actress for &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot; while Siskel called the wins for Jon Voight as Best Actor and Jane Fonda as Best Actress, both for &quot;Coming Home&quot;. Both Ebert and Siskel correctly predicted the win for Christopher Walken receiving the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.

According to producer Deeley, orchestrated lobbying against &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; was led by Warren Beatty, whose own picture &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; had multiple nominations. Beatty also used ex-girlfriends in his campaign: Julie Christie, serving on the jury at the Berlin Film Festival where &quot;Deer Hunter&quot; was screened, joined the walkout of the film by the Russian jury members. Jane Fonda also criticized &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; in public. Deeley suggested that her criticisms partly stemmed from the competition between her film &quot;Coming Home&quot; vying with &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; for Best Picture. According to Deeley, he planted a friend of his in the Oscar press area behind the stage to ask Fonda if she had seen &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. Fonda replied she had not seen the film, and to this day she still has not.

As the Oscars drew near, the backlash against &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; gathered strength. When the limos pulled up to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on April 9, 1979, they were met by demonstrators, mostly from the Los Angeles chapter of Vietnam Veterans Against the War. The demonstrators waved placards covered with slogans that read &quot;No Oscars for racism&quot; and &quot;&quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; a bloody lie&quot; and thrust pamphlets berating &quot;Deer Hunter&quot; into long lines of limousine windows. Washburn, nominated for Best Original Screenplay, claims his limousine was pelted with stones. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;Police and &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; protesters clashed in a brief but bloody battle that resulted in 13 arrests.&quot;

De Niro was so anxious that he did not attend the Oscars ceremony. He asked the Academy to allow him to sit out the show backstage, but when the Academy refused, De Niro stayed home in New York. Producer Deeley made a deal with fellow producer David Puttnam, whose film &quot;Midnight Express&quot; was nominated, that each would take $500 to the ceremony so if one of them won, the winner would give the loser the $500 to &quot;drown his sorrows in style.&quot;

===Complete list of awards===
==Legacy==
&quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; was among the early, and most controversial, major theatrical films to be critical of the American involvement in Vietnam following 1975 when the war officially ended. While the film opened the same year as Hal Ashby&#x27;s &quot;Coming Home&quot;, Sidney Furie&#x27;s &quot;The Boys in Company C&quot;, and Ted Post&#x27;s &quot;Go Tell the Spartans&quot;, it was the first film about Vietnam to reach a wide audience and critical acclaim, culminating in the winning of the Oscar for Best Picture. Other films released later that illustrated the &#x27;hellish&#x27;, futile conditions of bloody Vietnam War combat included:

* Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979)
* Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Platoon&quot; (1986)
* Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987)
* Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Casualties of War&quot; (1989)
* Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; (1989)

David Thomson wrote in an article titled &quot;&quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;: Story of a scene&quot; that the film changed the way war-time battles were portrayed on film: &quot;The terror and the blast of firepower changed the war film, even if it only used a revolver. More or less before the late 1970s, the movies had lived by a Second World War code in which battle scenes might be fierce but always rigorously controlled. &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; unleashed a new, raw dynamic in combat and action, paving the way for &quot;Platoon&quot;, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and Clint Eastwood&#x27;s Iwo Jima films.&quot;

In a 2011 interview with Rotten Tomatoes, actor William Fichtner retrospectively stated that he and his partner were silenced after seeing the film, stating that &quot;the human experience was just so pointed; their journeys were so difficult, as life is sometimes. I remember after seeing it, walking down the street — I actually went with a girl on a date and saw &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, and we left the theater and walked for like an hour and nobody said anything; we were just kind of stunned about that.&quot;

The deaths of approximately 25 people who died playing Russian roulette were reported as having been influenced by scenes in the movie.

===Honors and recognition===
In 1996, &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

American Film Institute included the film as #79 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies, #30 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills, and #53 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition).

The film ranks 467th in the &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time, noting:

Cimino&#x27;s bold, powerful &#x27;Nam epic goes from blue-collar macho rituals to a fiery, South East Asian hell and back to a ragged singalong of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; [sic]. De Niro holds it together, but Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep and John Savage are unforgettable.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its &quot;Best 1000 Movies Ever&quot; list.

Jan Scruggs, a Vietnam veteran who became a counselor with the U.S. Department of Labor, thought of the idea of building a National Memorial for Viet Nam Veterans after seeing a screening of the film in March 1979, and he established and operated the memorial fund which paid for it. Director Cimino was invited to the memorial&#x27;s opening.

<text>Iris is a flowering plant genus of 310 accepted species with showy flowers. As well as being the scientific name, iris is also widely used as a common name for all &quot;Iris&quot; species, as well as some belonging to other closely related genera. A common name for some species is flags, while the plants of the subgenus &quot;Scorpiris&quot; are widely known as junos, particularly in horticulture. It is a popular garden flower.

The often-segregated, monotypic genera &quot;Belamcanda&quot; (blackberry lily, &quot;I. domestica&quot;), &quot;Hermodactylus&quot; (snake&#x27;s head iris, &quot;I. tuberosa&quot;), and &quot;Pardanthopsis&quot; (vesper iris, &quot;I. dichotoma&quot;) are currently included in &quot;Iris&quot;.

Three &quot;Iris&quot; varieties are used in the &quot;Iris&quot; flower data set outlined by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper &quot;The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems&quot; as an example of linear discriminant analysis.

==Description==
Irises are perennial plants, growing from creeping rhizomes (rhizomatous irises) or, in drier climates, from bulbs (bulbous irises). They have long, erect flowering stems which may be simple or branched, solid or hollow, and flattened or have a circular cross-section. The rhizomatous species usually have 3–10 basal sword-shaped leaves growing in dense clumps. The bulbous species also have 2–10 narrow leaves growing from the bulb.

===Flower===
The inflorescences are in the shape of a fan and contain one or more symmetrical six-lobed flowers. These grow on a pedicel or peduncle. The three sepals, which are usually spreading or droop downwards, are referred to as &quot;falls&quot;. They expand from their narrow base (the &quot;claw&quot; or &quot;haft&quot;), into a broader expanded portion (&quot;limb&quot; or &quot;blade&quot;) and can be adorned with veining, lines or dots. In the centre of the blade, some of the rhizomatous irises have a &quot;beard&quot;, a row of fuzzy hairs at the base of each falls petal which gives pollinators a landing place and guides them to the nectar.

The three, sometimes reduced, petals stand upright, partly behind the sepal bases. They are called &quot;standards&quot;. Some smaller iris species have all six lobes pointing straight outwards, but generally limb and standards differ markedly in appearance. They are united at their base into a floral tube that lies above the ovary (This flower, with the petals, and other flower parts, above the ovary is known as an epigynous flower, and it is said to have an inferior ovary, that is an ovary below the other flower parts). The three styles divide towards the apex into petaloid branches; this is significant in pollination.

The iris flower is of interest as an example of the relation between flowering plants and pollinating insects. The shape of the flower and the position of the pollen-receiving and stigmatic surfaces on the outer petals form a landing-stage for a flying insect, which in probing for nectar, will first come into contact with the perianth, then with the three stigmatic stamens in one whorled surface which is borne on an ovary formed of three carpels. The shelf-like transverse projection on the inner whorled underside of the stamens is beneath the overarching style arm below the stigma, so that the insect comes in contact with its pollen-covered surface only after passing the stigma; in backing out of the flower it will come in contact only with the non-receptive lower face of the stigma. Thus, an insect bearing pollen from one flower will, in entering a second, deposit the pollen on the stigma; in backing out of a flower, the pollen which it bears will not be rubbed off on the stigma of the same flower.

The iris fruit is a capsule which opens up in three parts to reveal the numerous seeds within. In some species, the seeds bear an aril, such as &quot;Iris stolonifera&quot; which has light brown seeds with thick white aril.
==Etymology==
The genus takes its name from the Greek word &quot;îris&quot; &quot;rainbow&quot;, which is also the name for the Greek goddess of the rainbow, Iris. Some authors state that the name refers to the wide variety of flower colors found among the many species. 

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Iris&quot; is the largest genus of the family Iridaceae with up to 300 species – many of them natural hybrids. Plants of the World Online lists 310 accepted species from this genus as of 2022. Modern classifications, starting with Dykes (1913), have subdivided them. Dykes referred to the major subgroupings as sections. Subsequent authors such as Lawrence (1953) and Rodionenko (1987) have generally called them subgenera, while essentially retaining Dykes&#x27; groupings, using six subgenera further divided into twelve sections. Of these, section &quot;Limneris&quot; (subgenus &quot;Limneris&quot;) was further divided into sixteen series. Like some older sources, Rodionenko moved some of the bulbous subgenera (&quot;Xiphium&quot;, &quot;Scorpiris&quot; and &quot;Hermodactyloides&quot;) into separate genera (&quot;Xiphion&quot;, &quot;Juno&quot; and &quot;Iridodictyum&quot; respectively), but this has not been accepted by later writers such as Mathew (1989), although the latter kept &quot;Hermodactylus&quot; as a distinct genus, to include &quot;Hermodactylus tuberosus&quot;, now returned to &quot;Hermodactyloides&quot; as &quot;Iris tuberosa&quot;.

Rodionenko also reduced the number of sections in subgenus Iris, from six to two, depending on the presence (&quot;Hexapogon&quot;) or absence (&quot;Iris&quot;) of arils on the seeds, referred to as &quot;arilate&quot; or &quot;nonarilate&quot;. Taylor (1976) provides arguments for not including all arilate species in &quot;Hexapogon&quot;.

In general, modern classifications usually recognise six subgenera, of which five are restricted to the Old World; the sixth (subgenus &quot;Limniris&quot;) has a Holarctic distribution. The two largest subgenera are further divided into sections. The Iris subgenus has been divided into six sections; bearded irises (or pogon irises), Psammiris, Oncocyclus, Regelia, Hexapogon and Pseudoregelia. Iris subg. Limniris has been divided into 2 sections; Lophiris (or &#x27;Evansias&#x27; or crested iris) and Limniris which was further divided into 16 series.

===Evolution===
The concept of introgressive hybridization (or &quot;introgression&quot;) was first coined to describe the pattern of interspecific hybridization followed by backcrossing to the parentals that is common in this genus.

===Subgeneric division===

====Subgenera====
* &quot;Iris&quot; (Bearded rhizomatous irises)
* &quot;Limniris&quot; (Beardless rhizomatous irises)
* &quot;Xiphium&quot; (Smooth-bulbed bulbous irises: Formerly genus &quot;Xiphion&quot;)
* &quot;Nepalensis&quot; (Bulbous irises: Formerly genus &quot;Junopsis&quot;)
* &quot;Scorpiris&quot; (Smooth-bulbed bulbous irises: Formerly genus &quot;Juno&quot;)
* &quot;Hermodactyloides&quot; (Reticulate-bulbed bulbous irises: Formerly genus &quot;Iridodictyum&quot;)

====Sections, series and species====
==Distribution and habitat==

Nearly all species are found in temperate Northern Hemisphere zones, from Europe to Asia and across North America. Although diverse in ecology, &quot;Iris&quot; is predominantly found in dry, semi-desert, or colder rocky mountainous areas. Other habitats include grassy slopes, meadowlands, woodland, bogs and riverbanks. Some irises like &quot;Iris setosa&quot; can tolerate damp (bogs) or dry sites (meadows), and &quot;Iris foetidissima&quot; can be found in woodland, hedge banks and scrub areas.

==Diseases==
&quot;Narcissus mosaic virus&quot; is most commonly known from &quot;Narcissus&quot;. Wylie &quot;et al.&quot;, 2014, made the first identification of &quot;Narcissus mosaic virus&quot; infecting this garden plant genus, and the first record in Australia. &quot;Japanese iris necrotic ring virus&quot; also, commonly infects this genus. It was, however, unknown in Australia until Wylie &quot;et al.&quot;, 2012, identified it in Australia on &quot;I. ensata&quot;.

==Cultivation==
Iris is extensively grown as ornamental plant in home and botanical gardens. Presby Memorial Iris Gardens in New Jersey, for example, is a living iris museum with over 10,000 plants, while in Europe the most famous iris garden is arguably the Giardino dell&#x27;Iris in Florence (Italy) which every year hosts a well attended iris breeders&#x27; competition. Irises, especially the multitude of bearded types, feature regularly in shows such as the Chelsea Flower Show.

For garden cultivation, iris classification differs from taxonomic classification. Garden iris are classed as either bulb iris or rhizome iris (called rhizomatous) with a number of further subdivisions. Due to a wide variety of geographic origins, and thus great genetic diversity, cultivation needs of iris vary greatly.

Generally, Irises grow well in most garden soil types providing they are well-drained, depending on the species. The earliest to bloom are species like &quot;I. reticulata&quot; and &quot;I. reichenbachii&quot;, which flower as early as February and March in the Northern Hemisphere, followed by the dwarf forms of &quot;I. pumila&quot; and others. In May or June, most of the tall bearded varieties start to bloom, such as the German iris and its variety &quot;florentina&quot;, sweet iris, Hungarian iris, lemon-yellow iris (&quot;I. flavescens&quot;), &quot;Iris sambucina&quot;, and their natural and horticultural hybrids such as those described under names like &quot;I. neglecta&quot; or &quot;I. squalens&quot; and best united under &quot;I. × lurida&quot;.

The iris is promoted in the United Kingdom by the British Iris Society. The National Collection of Arthur Bliss Irises is held in Gloucestershire.

The American Iris Society is the International Cultivar Registration Authority for &quot;Iris&quot;, and recognises over 30,000 registered cultivar names.

===Bearded rhizome iris===
Bearded iris are classified as dwarf, tall, or aril. In Europe, the most commonly found garden iris is a hybrid iris (falsely called German iris, &quot;I. germanica&quot; which is sterile) and its numerous cultivars. Various wild forms (including &quot;Iris aphylla&quot;) and naturally occurring hybrids of the Sweet iris (&quot;I. pallida&quot;) and the Hungarian iris (&quot;I. variegata&quot;) form the basis of almost all modern hybrid bearded irises. Median forms of bearded iris (intermediate bearded, or IB; miniature tall bearded, or MTB; etc.) are derived from crosses between tall and dwarf species like &quot;Iris pumila&quot;.

The &quot;beard&quot;, short hairs arranged to look like a long furry caterpillar, is found toward the back of the lower petals and its purpose is to guide pollinating insects toward the reproductive parts of the plant. Bearded irises have been cultivated to have much larger blooms than historically; the flowers are now twice the size of those a hundred years ago. Ruffles were introduced in the 1960s to help stabilize the larger petals.

Bearded iris are easy to cultivate and propagate and have become very popular in gardens. A small selection is usually held by garden centres at appropriate times during the season, but there are thousands of cultivars available from specialist suppliers (more than 30,000 cultivars of tall bearded iris). They are best planted as bare root plants in late summer, in a sunny open position with the rhizome visible on the surface of the soil and facing the sun. They should be divided in summer every two or three years, when the clumps become congested.

A truly red bearded iris, like a truly blue rose, remains an unattained goal despite frequent hybridizing and selection. There are species and selections, most notably based on the beardless rhizomatous Copper iris (&quot;I. fulva&quot;), which have a relatively pure red color. However, getting this color into a modern bearded iris breed has proven very difficult, and thus, the vast majority of irises are in the purple and blue range of the color spectrum, with yellow, pink, orange and white breeds also available. Irises like many related genera lack red-based hues because their anthocyanins are delphinidin-derived. Pelargonidin-derived anthocyanins would lend the sought-after blue-based colors but these genera are metabolically disinclined to produce pelargonidin. Dihydroflavonol 4-reductases in &quot;Iris&quot;″s relatives selectively do not catalyse dihydrokaempferol to leucopelargonidin, the precursor, and this is probably the case here as well. The other metabolic difficulty is the presence of flavonoid 3&#x27;-hydroxylase, which in &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot; inhibits pelargonidin synthesis. The bias in irises towards delphinidin-anthocyanins is so pronounced that they have served as the gene donors for transgenic attempts at the aforementioned blue roses. Although these have been technically successful over 99% of their anthocyanins are blue their growth is crippled and they have never been commercializable.

====AGM cultivars====
The following is a selection of bearded irises that have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:
*&#x27;Alizes&#x27; (tall bearded, blue &amp; white) 
*&#x27;Bumblebee Deelite&#x27; (miniature tall bearded, yellow/purple)
*&#x27;Early Light&#x27; (tall bearded, pale yellow) 
*&#x27;Jane Phillips&#x27; (tall bearded, pale blue) 
*&#x27;Langport Wren&#x27; (intermediate bearded, maroon) 
*&#x27;Maui Moonlight&#x27; (intermediate bearded, pale yellow) 
*&#x27;Orinoco Flow&#x27; (border bearded, white/violet) 
*&#x27;Raspberry Blush&#x27; (intermediate bearded, pink) 
*&#x27;Sarah Taylor&#x27; (dwarf bearded, pale yellow) 
*&#x27;Thornbird&#x27; (tall bearded, pale yellow) 
*&#x27;Titan&#x27;s Glory&#x27; (tall bearded, deep blue)

====Bearded iris &quot;Oncocyclus&quot; section====
This section contains the cushion irises or royal irises, a group of plants noted for their large, strongly marked flowers. Between 30 and 60 species are classified in this section, depending on the authority. Species of section &quot;Oncocyclus&quot; are generally strict endemics, typically occurring in a small number of scattered, disjunct populations, whose geographical isolation is enhanced by their pollination strategy and myrmecochory seed dispersal. Morphological divergence between populations usually follows a cline reflecting local adaptation to environment conditions; furthermore, this largely overlaps divergence between species, making it difficult to identify discrete species boundaries in these irises. Compared with other irises, the cushion varieties are scantily furnished with narrow sickle-shaped leaves and the flowers are usually borne singly on the stalks; they are often very dark and in some almost blackish. The cushion irises are somewhat fastidious growers, and to be successful with them they must be planted rather shallow in very gritty well-drained soil. They should not be disturbed in the autumn, and after the leaves have withered the roots should be protected from heavy rains until growth starts again naturally.

====Bearded iris &quot;Regelia&quot; section====
This section, closely allied to the cushion irises, includes several garden hybrids with species in section &quot;Oncocyclus&quot;, known as &quot;Regelio-cyclus&quot; irises. They are best planted in September or October in warm sunny positions, the rhizomes being lifted the following July after the leaves have withered.

===Beardless rhizome iris (subgenus &quot;Limniris&quot;)===
There are six major subgroupings of the beardless iris, depending on origin. They are divided into Pacific Coast, Siberica, Spuria, Louisiana, Japanese, and other.

Beardless rhizomatous iris types commonly found in the European garden are the Siberian iris (&quot;I. sibirica&quot;) and its hybrids, and the Japanese Iris (&quot;I. ensata&quot;) and its hybrids. &quot;Japanese iris&quot; is also a catch-all term for the Japanese iris proper (&quot;hanashōbu&quot;), the blood iris (&quot;I. sanguinea, ayame&quot;) and the rabbit-ear iris (&quot;I. laevigata, kakitsubata&quot;). &quot;I. unguicularis&quot; is a late-winter-flowering species from Algeria, with sky-blue flowers with a yellow streak in the centre of each petal, produced from Winter to Spring. Yet another beardless rhizomatous iris popular in gardening is &quot;I. ruthenica&quot;, which has much the same requirements and characteristics as the tall bearded irises. In North America, Louisiana iris and its hybrids are often cultivated.

===Crested rhizome iris (subgenus &quot;Limniris&quot;)===
One specific species, &quot;Iris cristata&quot; from North America.

===Bulbing juno iris (subgenus &quot;Scorpiris&quot;)===
Often called &#x27;junos&#x27;, this type of iris is one of the more popular bulb irises in cultivation. They are generally earliest to bloom.

===Bulbing European iris (subgenus &quot;Xiphium&quot;)===
This group includes irises generally of European descent, and are also classified as Dutch, English, or Spanish iris.
*&quot;Iris reticulata&quot; and &quot;Iris persica&quot;, both of which are fragrant, are also popular with florists.
*&quot;Iris xiphium&quot;, the Spanish Iris (also known as Dutch Iris) and
*&quot;Iris latifolia&quot;, the English Iris. Despite the common names both the Spanish and English iris are of Spanish origin, and have very showy flowers, so they are popular with gardeners and florists. They are among the hardier bulbous irises, and can be grown in northern Europe. They require to be planted in thoroughly drained beds in very light open soil, moderately enriched, and should have a rather sheltered position. Both these present a long series of varieties of the most diverse colours, flowering in May, June and July, the smaller Spanish iris being the earlier of the two.

===Bulbing reticulate iris (subgenus &quot;Hermodactyloides&quot;)===
Reticulate irises with their characteristic bulbs, including the yellow &quot;I. danfordiae&quot;, and the various blue-purple &quot;I. histrioides&quot; and &quot;I. reticulata&quot;, flower as early as February and March. These reticulate-bulbed irises are miniatures and popular spring bulbs, being one of the first to bloom in the garden. Many of the smaller species of bulbous iris, being liable to perish from excess of moisture, should have a well-drained bed of good but porous soil made up for them, in some sunny spot, and in winter should be protected by a covering of half-decayed leaves or fresh coco-fiber. 
==Uses==

===Aromatic rhizomes===
Rhizomes of the German iris (&quot;I. germanica&quot;) and sweet iris (&quot;I. pallida&quot;) are traded as orris root and are used in perfume and medicine, though more common in ancient times than today. Today, Iris essential oil (absolute) from flowers are sometimes used in aromatherapy as sedative medicines. The dried rhizomes are also given whole to babies to help in teething. Gin brands such as Bombay Sapphire and Magellan Gin use orris root and sometimes iris flowers for flavor and color.

For orris root production, iris rhizomes are harvested, dried, and aged for up to 5 years. In this time, the fats and oils inside the roots undergo degradation and oxidation, which produces many fragrant compounds that are valuable in perfumery. The scent is said to be similar to violets. The aged rhizomes are steam-distilled which produces a thick oily compound, known in the perfume industry as &quot;iris butter&quot; or orris oil.

Iris rhizomes also contain notable amounts of terpenes, and organic acids such as ascorbic acid, myristic acid, tridecylenic acid and undecylenic acid. Iris rhizomes can be toxic. Larger blue flag (&quot;I. versicolor&quot;) and other species often grown in gardens and widely hybridized contain elevated amounts of the toxic glycoside iridin. These rhizomes can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or skin irritation, but poisonings are not normally fatal. Irises should only be used medicinally under professional guidance.

===Water purification===

In water purification, yellow iris (&quot;I. pseudacorus&quot;) is often used. The roots are usually planted in a substrate (e.g. lava-stone) in a reedbed-setup. The roots then improve water quality by consuming nutrient pollutants, such as from agricultural runoff. This highly aggressive grower is now considered a noxious weed and prohibited in some states of the US where it is found clogging natural waterways.

==In culture==

The iris has been used in art and as a symbol, including in heraldry. The symbolic meaning has evolved, in Christendom moving from a symbol of Mary mother of Jesus, to a French heraldic sign, the fleur-de-lis, and from French royalty it spread throughout Europe and beyond.

===Art===
Vincent van Gogh has painted several famous pictures of irises.

The American artist Joseph Mason – a friend of John James Audubon – painted a precise image of what was then known as the Louisiana flag or copper iris (&quot;Iris fulva&quot;), to which Audubon subsequently added two Northern paraula birds (&quot;Parula americana&quot;) for inclusion as Plate 15 in his &quot;Birds of America&quot;.

The artist Philip Hermogenes Calderon painted an iris in his 1856 work &quot;Broken Vows&quot;; he followed the principles of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. An ancient belief is that the iris serves as a warning to be heeded, as it was named for the messenger of Olympus. It also conveys images of lost love and silent grief, for young girls were led into the afterlife by the goddess Iris. &quot;Broken Vows&quot; was accompanied with poetry by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow when it was first exhibited.

Contemporary artist George Gessert, who introduced the cultivation of flowers as an art form, has specialised in breeding irises.

===Local varieties as symbol===
&quot;Iris nigricans&quot;, the black iris is the national flower of Jordan.

Iris bismarckiana, the Nazareth Iris, is the symbol of the city of Upper Nazareth.

The Iris croatica is the unofficial national flower of Croatia.

A stylized yellow iris is the symbol of Brussels, since historically the important Saint Gaugericus Island was carpeted in them. The iris symbol is now the sole feature on the flag of the Brussels-Capital Region.

In 1998, &quot;Iris lacustris&quot;, the Dwarf Lake iris, was designated the state wildflower of Michigan, where the vast majority of populations exist.

In 1990, the Louisiana iris was voted the state wildflower of Louisiana (see also fleur-de-lis:United States, New France), though the state flower is the magnolia blossom.

An iris — species unspecified — is one of the state flowers of Tennessee. It is generally accepted that the species &quot;Iris versicolor&quot;, the Purple Iris, is the state flower alongside the wild-growing purple passionflower (&quot;Passiflora incarnata&quot;), the state&#x27;s other floral emblem. Greeneville, Tennessee, is home to the annual Iris Festival celebrating the iris, local customs, and culture.

The species &quot;Iris versicolor&quot; is also the provincial flower of Quebec, Canada, having replaced the Madonna lily which is not native to the province (see also fleur-de-lis: Canada). The provincial flag of Québec carries the harlequin blueflag (&quot;I. versicolor&quot;, &quot;iris versicolore&quot; in French).

===China===
It is thought in China that Iris anguifuga has the ability to keep snakes from entering the garden. It grows all winter, keeping snakes out, but then goes dormant in the spring, allowing the snakes back into the garden. In the autumn, the iris re-appears and can stop the snakes again.

===Ancient Greece===
In the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter&quot;, the goddess Persephone and her companion nymphs (the Oceanids along with Artemis and Athena) were gathering flowers such as rose, crocus, violet, iris (also called &#x27;agallis&#x27; or ἀγαλλίς (in Greek script), lily, larkspur, and hyacinth in a springtime meadow before she was abducted by the god Hades.

It has been suggested that the &#x27;agallis&#x27; mentioned was a dwarf iris, as described by leaf and root shape,) and identified as Iris attica.

===Muslim culture===
In Iran and Kashmir, &quot;Iris kashmiriana&quot; and &quot;Iris germanica&quot; are most commonly grown on Muslim grave yards.

===Fleur-de-lis and associated heraldry===

French King Clovis I (466–511), when he converted to Christianity, changed his symbol on his banner from three toads to irises (the Virgin&#x27;s flower).

The fleur-de-lis, a stylized iris, first occurs in its modern use as the emblem of the House of Capet. The fleur-de-lis has been associated with France since Louis VII adopted it as a symbol in the 12th century. The yellow fleur-de-lis reflects the yellow iris (&quot;I. pseudacorus&quot;), common in Western Europe. Contemporary uses can be seen in the Quebec flag and the logo of the New Orleans Saints professional football team and on the flag of Saint Louis, Missouri.

The red fleur-de-lis in the coat-of-arms and flag of Florence, Italy, descends from the white iris which is native to Florence and which grew even in its city walls. This white iris displayed against a red background was the symbol of Florence until the Medici family reversed the colors to signal a change in political power, setting in motion a centuries-long and still on-going breeding program to hybridize a red iris.

====Scouting, fraternities &amp; sororities====
The fleur-de-lis is the almost-universal symbol of Scouting and one of the symbols adopted by the sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma.

The &quot;Iris versicolor&quot; is the official flower of Kappa Pi International Honorary Art Fraternity.

===Other===
The Iris is one of the flowers listed as birth flower for February.

<text>Detour is a 1945 American independent film noir directed by Edgar G. Ulmer, and starring Tom Neal and Ann Savage. The screenplay was adapted by Martin Goldsmith and an uncredited Martin Mooney from Goldsmith&#x27;s 1939 novel of the same title, and released by the Producers Releasing Corporation, one of the so-called Poverty Row film studios in mid-20th-century Hollywood.

The film, which today is in the public domain and freely available for viewing at various online sources, was restored by the Academy Film Archive in 2018. In April that year, the 4K restoration premiered in Los Angeles at the TCM Festival. In 1992, &quot;Detour&quot; was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Al Roberts, an unemployed piano player, hitches a ride, arriving at a roadside diner in Reno, Nevada. Another customer in the diner plays a song on the jukebox, that disturbs Al, for it reminds him of his former life in New York City.

Al recalls a time there when he was bitter about squandering his musical talent playing in a cheap nightclub. After his girlfriend Sue Harvey, the nightclub&#x27;s lead singer, quits her job and leaves New York to seek fame in Hollywood, Al becomes depressed. After anguishing a while, Al decides to travel to California to marry Sue. With little money to his name, Al is forced to hitchhike across the country.

In Arizona, bookie Charles Haskell Jr. gives Al a ride in his convertible and tells him that he is in luck; for he is driving to Los Angeles to place a bet on a horse. During the drive, he has Al pass him his pills on several occasions, which he swallows as he drives. That night, Al drives while Haskell sleeps. When a rainstorm forces Al to pull over to put up the convertible&#x27;s top, he is unable to rouse Haskell. Al opens the passenger-side door and Haskell tumbles out, falling to the ground and striking his head on a rock.

Al realizes the bookie is dead. It is likely that Haskell died earlier from a heart attack, but Al is certain that if he calls the police, they will arrest him for killing Haskell, so Al hides the body in the brush. He takes the dead man&#x27;s money, clothes, and identification, and drives away, intent on abandoning the car near Los Angeles.

Al crosses into California and spends a night in a motel. The next day, as he leaves a gas station near Desert Center Airport, he picks up a hitchhiker, who gives her name as Vera. At first, she travels silently with Al, who has identified himself as Haskell, but suddenly challenges his identity and ownership of the car, revealing that she had been picked up by Haskell earlier in Louisiana, but got out in Arizona after he tried to force himself on her. Al tells her how Haskell died, but she blackmails him by threatening to turn him over to the police. She takes the cash that Al retrieved from Haskell&#x27;s wallet and demands whatever money they get by selling the car.

In Hollywood, they rent an apartment, posing as Mr. and Mrs. Haskell, to provide an address when they sell the car. When they are about to make the sale, Vera learns from a local newspaper that Haskell&#x27;s wealthy father is near death and a search is under way for his long-estranged son. Vera demands that Al impersonate Haskell and position himself to inherit the estate. Al refuses, arguing that the impersonation would require detailed knowledge he lacks.

Back at the apartment, Vera gets drunk and they begin arguing intensely. In a drunken rage, she threatens to call the police and runs into the bedroom with the telephone. She locks the door then falls on the bed and begins to fall asleep, the telephone cord tangled around her neck. From the other side of the door, Al pulls on the cord to try to disconnect the phone. When he breaks down the door, he discovers he has inadvertently strangled Vera.

Al gives up the idea of contacting Sue again and returns to hitchhiking. He later finds out that Haskell is wanted in connection with the murder of &quot;his wife.&quot; Back in the diner in Reno where the film opened, he imagines his inevitable arrest.

==Production==
In 1972, Ulmer said in an interview that the film was shot in six days. However, in a 2004 documentary, Ulmer&#x27;s daughter Arianne presented a shooting script title page which noted, &quot;June 14, 1945-June 29. Camera days 14.&quot; Moreover, Ann Savage was contracted to Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) for the production of &quot;Detour&quot; for three six-day weeks, and she later said the film was shot in four six-day weeks, with an additional four days of location work in the desert at Lancaster, California.

While popular belief long held that &quot;Detour&quot; was shot for about $20,000, Noah Isenberg, in conducting research for his book on the film, discovered that the production&#x27;s final cost was closer to $100,000. Even so, it still had one of the highest profit margins, if not the highest, of any film noir listed in the National Film Registry.

Billy Halop was tested for the role of Al Roberts, was selected for the part, but was replaced by Tom Neal just three days before filming began.

===Editing===

As detailed in &quot;Savage Detours: The Life and Work of Ann Savage&quot;, great care was taken during the postproduction of &quot;Detour&quot;. The final picture was tightly cut down from a much longer shooting script, which had been shot with more extended dialogue sequences that are not in the released print. The soundtrack is also fully realized, with ambient backgrounds, motivated sound effects, and a carefully scored original musical soundtrack by Leo Erdody, who had previously worked with Ulmer on &quot;Strange Illusion&quot; (1945). Erdody took extra pains to underscore Vera&#x27;s introduction with a sympathetic theme, giving the character a light musical shading in contrast to her razor-sharp dialogue and its ferocious delivery by Savage.

The film was completed, negative cut, and printed throughout the late summer and fall of 1945, and was released in November of that year. The total period of preproduction through postproduction at PRC ran from March through November 1945.

In contrast, during the period &quot;Detour&quot; was in post-production, PRC shot, posted, and released &quot;Apology for Murder&quot; (1945), also starring Savage. &quot;Apology&quot; was given a shorter production period and a quick sound job, and used library music for the soundtrack. Clearly, &quot;Detour&quot; was a higher priority to PRC, and the release was well promoted in theaters with a full array of color print support, including six-sheet posters, standees, hand drawn portraits of the actors, and a jukebox tie-in record with Bing Crosby singing &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe That You&#x27;re in Love with Me&quot; (1926).

With reshoots out of the question for such a low-budget movie, director Ulmer put storytelling above continuity. For example, he flipped the negative for some of the hitchhiking scenes. This showed the westbound New York City to Los Angeles travel of the character with a right-to-left flow across the screen, though it also made cars seem to be driving on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the road, with the hitchhiker getting into the car on the driver&#x27;s side.

===Charlie Haskell&#x27;s car===

The car owned by the character Charlie Haskell and later driven by Al Roberts is a customized 1941 Lincoln Continental V-12 convertible, a base model of a &quot;Cabriolet&quot; but one that features bolted-on rear wheel-well covers and some exterior components added later from Lincoln&#x27;s limited 1942 version of the same model. Reportedly, the production budget for &quot;Detour&quot; was so tight that director Ulmer decided to use this car, his &quot;personal car&quot;, for the cross-country crime drama.

===Censorship===
The Motion Picture Production Code did not allow murderers to get away with their crimes, so Ulmer satisfied the censors by having Al picked up by a police car at the very end of the film after foreseeing his arrest in the earlier narration.

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;Detour&quot; was generally well received on its initial release, with positive reviews in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot; in other major newspapers and trade publications. Contemporary screenings of &quot;Detour&quot; were also not confined to grindhouse theaters; they were presented at top &quot;movie houses&quot;. For example, in downtown Los Angeles in May 1946, it played at the 2,200-seat Orpheum in combination with a live stage show featuring the hit Slim Gaillard Trio and the Buddy Rich Orchestra. Business was reported to be excellent despite a transit strike.

Shortly after the film&#x27;s release in November 1945, Mandel Herbstman, the reviewer for the trade journal &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot;, rated the production as only &quot;fair&quot;. Herbstman was impressed, however, with the film&#x27;s overall structure. &quot;Venturing far from the familiar melodramatic pattern&quot;, he wrote, &quot;director Edgar G. Ulmer has turned out an adroit, albeit unpretentious production about a man who stumbles into a series of circumstances which seals his doom.&quot; He especially liked its conclusion and noted, &quot;Making no compromise with the &#x27;happy ending&#x27; formula, the film has a number of ironic and suspenseful moments.&quot;

The film was released to television in the early 1950s, and it was broadcast in syndicated TV markets until the advent of mass cable systems. TV reviewers casually recommended it in the 1960s and 1970s as a worthwhile &quot;B&quot; movie. Then, by the 1980s, critics began citing &quot;Detour&quot; increasingly as a prime example of &quot;film noir&quot;, and revival houses, universities and film festivals began presenting the crime drama in tributes to Edgar G. Ulmer and his work. The director died in 1972, unfortunately before the full revival of &quot;Detour&quot; and the critical re-evaluation of his career occurred. Tom Neal died the same year as Ulmer, but Ann Savage lived long enough to experience the newfound acclaim. From 1985 until just two years before her death in 2008, she made a series of live appearances at public screenings of the film.

Critical response to the film decades after its release is almost universally positive. More current reviewers contrast the technical shoddiness of the film with its successful atmospherics as film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his essay for &quot;The Great Movies&quot;, &quot;This movie from Hollywood&#x27;s poverty row, shot in six days, filled with technical errors and ham-handed narrative, starring a man who can only pout and a woman who can only sneer, should have faded from sight soon after it was released in 1945. And yet it lives on, haunting and creepy, an embodiment of the guilty soul of film noir. No one who has seen it has easily forgotten it.&quot; &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; reviewer Philip Kemp later wrote, &quot;Using unknown actors and filming with no more than three minimal sets, a sole exterior (a used-car lot) to represent Los Angeles, a few stock shots and some shaky back-projection, Ulmer conjures up a black, paranoid vision, totally untainted by glamour, of shabby characters trapped in a spiral of irrational guilt.&quot; Novelists Edward Gorman and Dow Mossman wrote, &quot;&quot;Detour&quot; remains a masterpiece of its kind. There have been hundreds of better movies, but none with the feel for doom portrayed by ... Ulmer. The random universe Stephen Crane warned us about—the berserk cosmic impulse that causes earthquakes and famine and AIDS—is nowhere better depicted than in the scene where Tom Neal stands by the roadside, soaking in the midnight rain, feeling for the first time the noose drawing tighter and tighter around his neck.&quot;

In 2007, Richard Corliss, the former editor-in-chief of &quot;Film Comment&quot; and a notable film critic for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, ranked Savage&#x27;s portrayal of Vera number 6 on his list of the &quot;Top 25 Greatest Villains&quot; in cinema history, placing her just behind Barbara Stanwyck&#x27;s character Phyllis Dietrichson in &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944). As part of his assessment of Vera, Corliss describes her effects on not only her traveling companion Al Roberts but on viewers of the film as well:

==Remake==
A remake of &quot;Detour&quot; was produced in 1992, starring Neal&#x27;s son, Tom Neal Jr., and Lea Lavish, along with Susanna Foster making her first acting appearance in 43 years and her final appearance on film. Produced, written, and directed by Wade Williams and released by his distribution company, Englewood Entertainment, it was released on VHS and in 1998 on DVD.

<text>Do the Right Thing is a 1989 American comedy-drama film produced, written and directed by Spike Lee. It stars Lee, Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Richard Edson, Giancarlo Esposito, Bill Nunn, John Turturro and Samuel L. Jackson and is the feature film debut of Martin Lawrence and Rosie Perez. The story explores a Brooklyn neighborhood&#x27;s simmering racial tension between its African-American residents and the Italian-American owners of a local pizzeria, culminating in tragedy and violence on a hot summer&#x27;s day.

&quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; premiered in the 42nd Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 1989, and was released in the United States on June 30, 1989, by Universal Pictures. A critical and commercial success, the film received accolades, including Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (for Aiello&#x27;s portrayal of Sal, the pizzeria owner). In 1999, it was selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, citing its preservation as &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2022, the film was ranked the 24th greatest of all time in &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; magazine&#x27;s decennial poll of international critics, programmers, curators, archivists and academics. It has since been featured on many other lists of the greatest films of all time by numerous critics.

==Plot==

Twenty-five-year-old Mookie lives in Bedford–Stuyvesant with his sister Jade, has a toddler son named Hector with his Latina girlfriend Tina, and works as a delivery man at a pizzeria owned by Italian-American Salvatore &quot;Sal&quot; Frangione. Sal&#x27;s oldest son, Pino, is a racist who holds contempt for all the neighborhood blacks. Sal&#x27;s younger son, Vito, is friends with Mookie, which Pino feels undermines their fraternal bond.

Other residents of the neighborhood include friendly drunk Da Mayor; Mother Sister, who observes the block from her brownstone; Radio Raheem, who blasts Public Enemy&#x27;s &quot;Fight the Power&quot; on his boombox; Buggin&#x27; Out, a fast-talking young man who talks about black civil rights to anyone who&#x27;ll listen; Smiley, a mentally disabled man who meanders around town with hand-colored pictures of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.; and local DJ Mister Señor Love Daddy.

At Sal&#x27;s, Buggin&#x27; Out questions Sal about his &quot;Wall of Fame&quot;, which is decorated with photos of famous Italian-Americans. He demands that Sal put up pictures of black celebrities since the pizzeria is in a black neighborhood. Sal refuses, feeling he&#x27;s not required to put anyone but Italians on the wall, and ejects him. Buggin&#x27; Out attempts to start boycotting the pizzeria, but only Raheem joins him.

During the day, local teenagers open a fire hydrant to beat the heat wave before white police officers Mark Ponte and Gary Long intervene. Mookie confronts Pino about his contempt towards African Americans. Later, Pino expresses his hatred for African Americans to Sal, who insists on keeping the business in the majority African-American neighborhood.

That night, Buggin&#x27; Out and Raheem march into Sal&#x27;s and demand that the Wall of Fame include Black celebrities. Sal demands that Raheem turn his boombox off, but he refuses. Buggin&#x27; Out badmouths Sal and threatens to shutter the pizzeria for good. Finally, Sal snaps and smashes Raheem&#x27;s boombox. Enraged, Raheem attacks Sal. A fight ensues that spills out into the street, attracting a crowd. The police arrive, including Long and Ponte, who break up the fight and apprehend Raheem and Buggin&#x27; Out. As the officers attempt to restrain Raheem, Long begins choking him with his nightstick. Though Ponte and the onlookers plead for him to stop, Long tightens his choke-hold on Raheem, killing him. Attempting to save face, the duo place his body in the back of a police car and drive off.

The onlookers blame Sal for Raheem&#x27;s death, but Da Mayor unsuccessfully tries to convince the crowd of Sal&#x27;s innocence. Suddenly, Mookie grabs a trash can and throws it through the pizzeria&#x27;s window, sparking the crowd to destroy it. Smiley sets the building ablaze, and Da Mayor pulls Sal, Pino, and Vito away from the mob, which turns toward the Korean market across the street to destroy it, too. Sonny, the owner, eventually dissuades the group.

The police return with the fire department and riot patrols to extinguish the fire and disperse the crowd. The firefighters, after several warnings to the crowd, turn their hoses on the mob, enraging them and causing more arrests. The next day, Mookie returns to Sal and demands his weekly pay. After an argument, Sal pays Mookie, and the two cautiously reconcile. Mookie leaves to visit Hector as Mister Señor Love Daddy announces that the mayor of New York City has founded a committee to investigate the incident and dedicates a song to Raheem.

An epilogue shows two quotations that demonstrate the dichotomy of the film&#x27;s theme – one from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who claims violence is never justified, and one from Malcolm X, who claims violence is &quot;intelligence&quot; when used in self-defense – and dedicates the film to six black people, five—Eleanor Bumpurs, Arthur Miller Jr., Edmund Perry, Yvonne Smallwood, and Michael Stewart—killed by police officers and one—Michael Griffith—killed by a white mob.

==Production==
===Development===
Writer, director, and actor Spike Lee conceived the idea for &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; after discussing a 1986 incident at Howard Beach, Queens, with actor Robert De Niro. This incident involved an attack on African-American men in a predominantly Italian-American neighborhood, resulting in one victim being struck by a car and killed. Lee was also influenced by the &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; episode &quot;Shopping for Death,&quot; in which the main characters discuss their theory that hot weather increases violent tendencies, and the killing of Eleanor Bumpurs by police. He wrote the screenplay in two weeks.

The original script of &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; ended with a stronger reconciliation between Mookie and Sal than Lee used in the film. In this version, Sal&#x27;s comments to Mookie are similar to Da Mayor&#x27;s earlier comments in the film and hint at some common ground and perhaps Sal&#x27;s understanding of why Mookie tried to destroy his restaurant. Lee has not explicitly explained why he changed the ending but his contemporaneous notes compiled in the film&#x27;s companion book indicate Lisa Jones expressed Sal&#x27;s reaction as &quot;too nice&quot; as originally written.

===Casting===
Initially considering De Niro for the role of &quot;Sal,&quot; Lee eventually cast Danny Aiello at De Niro&#x27;s suggestion. Aiello&#x27;s son Rick played Gary Long, the police officer who kills Radio Raheem. Roger Guenveur Smith, who was pestering Lee for a role in the film, created the character of Smiley, who was not in the original script. Four of the cast members were stand-up comedians: Martin Lawrence, Steve Park, Steve White and Robin Harris. Samuel L. Jackson was chosen for the role of Mister Señor Love Daddy. Jackson later revealed that he spent much of his time on set sleeping as he has no scenes outside. Lee originally wanted Bill Nunn to play the role of Mister Señor Love Daddy but later recast him as Radio Raheem. The acting couple Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, who were friends of Lee&#x27;s father Bill, were cast as Da Mayor and Mother Sister. Perez was cast as Mookie&#x27;s love interest Tina after Lee saw her dancing at a Los Angeles dance club. Perez decided to take the part because her sister lived four blocks from the set. She had never been in a film before and became upset during the filming of Radio Raheem&#x27;s death scene.

===Filming===
Principal photography commenced on July 18, 1988, on a single block in Brooklyn, New York. The film crew transformed the dilapidated Stuyvesant Avenue, between Quincy Street and Lexington Avenue in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood, creating new structures such as the Korean grocery store, a functional pizza parlor representing Sal&#x27;s Famous Pizzeria, and a radio station replacing a burnt-out building. Some characters&#x27; residences were set in a former crack house shut down by the production, and the brownstone serving as the home of the only white resident, &quot;Clifton,&quot; was a vacant building before filming. Lee organized a block party before principal photography to foster a positive relationship between the neighborhood residents and the filmmakers. Production designer Wynn Thomas altered the street&#x27;s color scheme, using a great deal of red and orange paint to convey the sense of a heatwave. During filming, the neighborhood&#x27;s crack dealers threatened the film crew for disturbing their business, leading Lee to hire Fruit of Islam members to provide security. Filming wrapped on September 14, 1988, with a budget of $6.2 million.

During the final confrontation between Aiello&#x27;s &quot;Sal&quot; and Giancarlo Esposito&#x27;s character, &quot;Buggin Out,&quot; Lee allowed the actors to improvise racist remarks. Esposito, who was of half-Italian and half-African-American descent, found the scene cathartic.

===Radio Raheem===
The character of Radio Raheem (Nunn) was the subject of much analysis. In the film, Raheem recites a soliloquy on love and hate, an ode to a similar monologue delivered by Robert Mitchum in &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; (1955). In this scene, he is wearing brass knuckle rings that say &quot;hate&quot; on his left hand and &quot;love&quot; on his right. Lee shoots this scene by having the camera replace the position of Mookie, opposite Raheem. Thus, Raheem breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the camera and the audience. This deliberate cinematography frames Raheem&#x27;s monologue as a moment of sincerity and importance, resulting in the effect of Raheem commenting on black history and the struggle against racism in the real world, on the other side of the camera. Raheem poetically articulates the allure of both love and hate and the constant fluctuation that occurs between these two opposing forces. His monologue can be seen to reveal that the solution to such a nuanced historical issue as racism lies in the combined effort and fluctuation of both forces. In &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;, a serial killer masking as a preacher (Mitchum) speaks of love and hate as an internal struggle within oneself. Raheem&#x27;s performance of the same topic, however, is portrayed as an external struggle against the outside world.

Critic Ted Kulczycky comments on Spike Lee&#x27;s use of direct address in Radio Raheem&#x27;s soliloquy on love and hate as a &quot;break from realism&quot;, thus creating an &quot;atypical effect&quot;. Kulczycky cites the influence of Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s film &quot;Weekend&quot;. Kulczycky describes Raheem&#x27;s direct address as having the dual effect of reminding viewers of the constructed nature of the film, but also &quot;fueling their involvement&quot;. The boombox prop used in the film is on display in the &quot;A Changing America: 1968 and Beyond&quot; exhibit at the National Museum of African American History and Culture.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

At the time of the film&#x27;s release, both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert ranked the film as the best of 1989, and later each ranked it as one of the top 10 films of the decade ( for Siskel and for Ebert). Siskel described the film as &quot;a spiritual documentary that shows racial joy, hatred and confusion at every turn&quot;, while Ebert lauded it for coming &quot;closer to reflecting the current state of race relations in America than any other movie of our time.&quot; Ebert later added the film to his list of &quot;The Great Movies&quot;. In a retrospective review in 2019, Kambole Campbell of the British magazine &quot;Little White Lies&quot; noted the film&#x27;s lasting relevance and called it &quot;a bold expression of love and frustration and care and anger that is so vivid and expressive it feels like it exists in the here and now.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; film critic Wesley Morris has called &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; his favorite film.

Some critics were less favorable in their reviews. Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two stars out of four; while calling the film &quot;amiable&quot;, he resented it for employing white guilt and &quot;seeing violence as a liberating symbol rather than a debasing reality.&quot; Ralph Novak, writing for &quot;People&quot;, panned the film as incoherent and having an unclear message and no likable characters: &quot;If Lee is saying that racism is profoundly painful, frustrating and confusing, no one will argue. But this film states the case without offering any insight.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 92%, based on 110 reviews, with an average rating of 9.2/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Smart, vibrant and urgent without being didactic, &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; is one of Spike Lee&#x27;s most fully realized efforts – and one of the most important films of the 1980s.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 93 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, and placing it as the 68th-highest film of all-time on the site. 

===Controversies===
After release, many reviewers protested its content. Some columnists opined that the film could incite Black audiences to riot. Lee criticized White reviewers in turn for suggesting that Black audiences were incapable of restraining themselves while watching a fictional motion picture. In a 2014 interview, Lee said, &quot;That still bugs the shit out of me&quot;, calling the remarks &quot;outrageous, egregious and, I think, racist.&quot; He said, &quot;I don&#x27;t remember people saying people were going to come out of theaters killing people after they watched Arnold Schwarzenegger films.&quot;

An open question near the end of the film is whether Mookie &quot;does the right thing&quot; by throwing the garbage can through the window, inciting the riot that destroys Sal&#x27;s pizzeria. Some critics have interpreted Mookie&#x27;s action as one that saves Sal&#x27;s life by redirecting the crowd&#x27;s anger away from Sal to his property, while others say that it was an &quot;irresponsible encouragement to enact violence&quot;. The quotations by two major Black leaders used at the end of the film provide no answers: one advocates nonviolence, the other advocates armed self-defense in response to oppression.

Lee has remarked that only White viewers ask him if Mookie did the right thing; Black viewers do not ask him the question. Lee believes the key point is that Mookie was angry at the wrongful death of Radio Raheem, stating that viewers who question the riot are explicitly failing to see the difference between property damage and the death of a Black man.

Lee has been criticized for his treatment of women in his films. bell hooks said that he wrote Black women in the same objectifying way that White male filmmakers write the characters of White women. Rosie Perez, who made her acting debut as Tina in the film, later said that she was very uncomfortable with doing the nude scene in the film:

Subsequently, Perez stated that Lee had offered an apology, and the two remained friends.

In June 2006, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; at No. 22 on its list of The 25 Most Controversial Movies Ever.

In the 2021 Cannes Film Festival award ceremony, Chaz Ebert, the wife of the late film critic Roger Ebert, noted that her husband had been appalled that the film had not received any awards from the Cannes jury in 1989, and had even threatened to boycott the festival as a result. Lee noted that the U.S. press at the time thought the film &quot;would start race riots all across America&quot;. Drawing a loud applause from attending press, he pointed to the continued relevance of the film&#x27;s story, more than three decades on, saying: &quot;You would think and hope that 30-something motherfucking years later that Black people would have stopped being hunted down like animals.&quot;

===Track listing===

==In popular culture==
In 1990, the film was parodied in a sketch on &quot;In Living Color&quot;. Many television series have parodied the trash can scene, including &quot;The Critic&quot;, &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, and &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot;.

The scene where Buggin&#x27; Out confronts the white Celtics fan about scuffing his Air Jordans is parodied in the music video for the 2008 Nelly song &quot;Stepped on My J&#x27;z&quot;.

In 2016, Air Jordan released a special Radio Raheem sneaker.

In 2014, the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary, Barack and Michelle Obama praised the film, and said they went to see it together on their first date. This was later referenced in the 2016 film &quot;Southside with You&quot; where Barack discusses Mookie&#x27;s motives with a white colleague after seeing the film.

==Do The Right Thing Way==
The section of Stuyvesant Avenue between Quincy Street and Lexington Avenue in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, where the entire film was shot, was renamed Do The Right Thing Way in 2015. The renaming came from a push by Bed-Stuy&#x27;s city council representative Robert Cornegy Jr. and was included as part of a bill to honor important figures from New York City&#x27;s history. The renaming was meant to occur in 2014, but was delayed by the city. The street is the only street in New York City named after a work of fiction, and one of the only streets named after a work of fiction in the world. Lee was reportedly “excited” by the renaming, and has also begun selling faux street signs for the street on his website.

==Related films==
Officers Gary Long and Mark Ponte return in &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; (1991). In Lee&#x27;s 2006 film, &quot;Inside Man&quot;, the police provide Sal&#x27;s pizza to the hostages.

Mookie makes another appearance in the 2012 film &quot;Red Hook Summer&quot;, where he is shown delivering pizzas. According to Lee, Sal took the insurance money from his burned pizzeria and reopened the restaurant in Red Hook. He then rehired Mookie, agreeing to include Black celebrities on his Wall of Fame.

In the second season of Netflix series &quot;She&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot;, based on the film of the same name, Rosie Perez returns to portray Tina once more and it is revealed that not only is she the mother of Mars Blackmon (Anthony Ramos), but that Mookie is Blackmon&#x27;s biological father.

<text>The Docks of New York is a 1928 American silent drama film directed by Josef von Sternberg and starring George Bancroft, Betty Compson, and Olga Baclanova. The movie was adapted by Jules Furthman from the John Monk Saunders story &quot;The Dock Walloper&quot;.

== Plot ==

An American tramp steamer docks in New York harbor sometime in the early years of the 20th century before prohibition. In the bowels of the ship, coal stokers are shutting down the furnaces in the anticipation of shore leave for the night. The bullying third engineer, Andy (Mitchell Lewis), warns the exhausted crew that they will be punished if they return drunk when the vessel sails the following morning. The stokers gather to leer at crude pornographic graffiti scrawled on the engine room wall before debarking to carouse at the local gin-mills. 
On shore, Andy enters The Sandbar, dance-hall saloon, craving a beer and female companionship. He has an unexpected encounter with his estranged wife, Lou (Olga Baclanova). During his absence of three years, she has become a &quot;habitué&quot; of the saloon, where she freely enjoys male companionship. The “couple” join one another for a drink; no love is lost between them.

The stoker Bill Roberts (George Bancroft) – a swaggering brawler when on leave – rescues a drowning prostitute named Mae (Betty Compson) who has leapt off the dock to end her sordid life. Bill, ignoring the admonishment of his sidekick “Sugar” Steve (Clyde Cook), impassively carries the semi-conscious woman to a room above The Sandbar, indifferent to the protests from the proprietor&#x27;s wife, Mrs. Crimp (May Foster). Lou intercedes to provide first-aid and revives Mae, a fallen angel like herself. Bill&#x27;s growing awareness of Mae&#x27;s physical beauty assumes a proprietary quality. He fetches her a beverage from the bar and presents her with a pretty dress he steals from a pawn shop next door. Bill exhorts her to join him for the evening, and Mae, distraught and vulnerable, accepts his invitation. They meet downstairs in the raucous tavern.

Andy attempts to pull rank and cut in on the couple, but the powerful stoker drives him off with blows. Lou, observing her husband&#x27;s boorishness, looks on with contempt. Mae and Bill mutually confess their sexual histories to one another, she with regret, he with masculine pride. So as to win Mae&#x27;s favors for the night, Bill consents to marry her on the spot, and Mae wistfully obliges.

The local missionary “Hymn Book” Harry (Gustav von Seyffertitz) is summoned and sternly delivers the sacrament. Lou provides Mae with a ring: her own, now superfluous wedding ring. The couple takes their vows, each shamefacedly, and the formerly boisterous patrons observe with mock solemnity, then erupt in cheers when the newlyweds kiss.

The following morning, Bill slips quietly from the flophouse honeymoon suite, without a word to Mae. Andy, observing that the stoker is abandoning his “wife”, goes to Mae&#x27;s room, where she has just discovered Bill&#x27;s desertion. Andy attempts to force himself on her, but Lou arrives and guns him down. The police suspect Mae of the murder, but Lou confesses and is arrested.

Under the blandishments of “Sugar” Steve, Bill takes leave of Mae. Driven to distraction by his perfidy, she angrily drives him from her room.

Aboard the steamer, Bill has an epiphany. He bolts from the subterranean furnaces to the sunny deck, leaps overboard and swims to shore. There he inquires as to Mae&#x27;s whereabouts and discovers that she is in custody at Night Court, charged with stealing the clothing he had bestowed on her. Moments after the judge sentences her to jail, Bill presents himself and confesses to the crime, exonerating Mae. He pledges to reunite with Mae after he serves his 60-day sentence, and she agrees to wait for him.

== Production ==

On May 5, 1928, Paramount Pictures announced their next picture would be &quot;The Docks of New York&quot;; with Josef von Sternberg enlisted to direct and George Bancroft to star with an adapted script of Monk Saunders&#x27;s &quot;The Dock Walloper&quot; provided by Jules Furthman. Before production von Sternberg and Furthman went to New York to conduct research for the film.

A highly collaborative work, &quot;The Docks of New York&quot; benefited from the screenwriting of Jules Furthman, such that “the director’s vision...cannot be easily distinguished from Furthman’s scenarios.&quot; Scripting for Sternberg&#x27;s most celebrated movies, among them &quot;Morocco&quot; (1930), &quot;Shanghai Express&quot; (1932) and &quot;Blonde Venus&quot; (1932) was provided by Furthmann. Sternberg also benefited from the cinematography of Harold Rosson, who was inspired by the director&#x27;s “fresh, innovative ideas.” Art director Hans Dreier, formerly of Germany&#x27;s UFA, created the evocative set for the &quot;Sandbar&quot; saloon with its subjective &quot;demimonde&quot; atmosphere of Sternberg&#x27;s New York waterfront. Dreier would subsequently oversee studio production design for decades as head of Paramount&#x27;s art department.

Production began on the film on June 25, with principal photography beginning on July 10, 1928. The production was shot entirely at Paramount Studios where they created sets to resemble the New York City waterfront.

The Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, formed by the film industry in 1922, regulated the content of films through a list of subjects that were to be avoided. While Betty Compson portrayed a prostitute in &quot;The Docks of New York&quot;, this was acceptable as prostitution was not explicitly barred so long as it was not forced (i.e., white slavery) and aspects of her work was not directly shown in the film. The wedding ceremony held in the bar makes later activities in the film ambiguous.

== Release ==

The film opened in New York City on September 16, 1928, at the Paramount Theatre and was released on September 29 throughout other parts of the country. The film earned $88,000 in its first week of release at the Paramount Theatre, breaking a record set previously by von Sternberg&#x27;s 1927 film &quot;Underworld&quot;, also starring George Bancroft.

== Reception ==
&quot;Variety&quot; called the film “a corking program picture” and says the film misses greatness by a “whisker”. They also praised the performance of Bancroft, the direction of von Sternberg, the cinematography of Harold Rosson, and the intertitles from Julian Johnson.

Film critic John Baxter observed that &quot;&quot;The Docks of New York&quot;...is today the most popular of Sternberg&#x27;s silent films, although it did poorly at the box-office on its release.&quot;

&quot;The Docks of New York&quot; was one of the last films of the silent era. Previewed by the New York City press during the same week that saw the fanfare opening of Al Jolson’s &quot;The Singing Fool&quot;, Sternberg’s film was “completely passed over in the clamor” that accompanied the advent of talking pictures. Film critic Andrew Sarris lamented that Sternberg&#x27;s film “quickly vanished in undeserved oblivion...confirm[ing] Chaplin’s observation that the silent movies learned their craft just about the time they went out of business.”

Museum of Modern Art film curator Charles Silver ranked &quot;The Docks of New York&quot; as “probably the last genuinely great silent film made in Hollywood [rivaling] Chaplin’s masterpieces of the 1930s.” With respect to Sternberg&#x27;s oeuvre, &quot;The Docks of New York&quot; was “the first in which his prodigious pictorial genius was fully realized.” A “deceptively simple” and ‘emotionally affecting film”, Sternberg combined spectacle and emotion, where &quot;his characters gain in clarity what they lose in complexity.&quot;

&quot;The Docks of New York&quot; was added to the Criterion Collection as part of the “Three Silent Classics by Josef von Sternberg” series.

== Themes ==

Despite the lurid mise-en-scène that provides the canvas for Sternberg&#x27;s imagination, the film is neither &quot;a crime thriller, nor a hardboiled noir...&quot;The Docks of New York&quot; is an elegant and elegiac love story [and] the most emotionally affecting film&quot; of Sternberg&#x27;s career.

A standard melodrama with a &quot;deceptively simple&quot; plot, Sternberg does not dwell upon the social conditions of the working class figures; he is &quot;not concerned with the class consciousness of the characters.&quot; Rather than striving to be realistic, Sternberg&#x27;s photography served to &quot;give visual experience feelings more than facts.&quot; Through the combination of camera movement (as opposed to montage) and his mise-en-scène compositions &quot;that closely resemble German expressionist cinema&quot;, Sternberg conveys a &quot;deeply felt emotional maturity and raw passion not previously seen on the American screen.&quot;

Film critic William Blick reserves special mention for the film&#x27;s wedding scene:

Critic Andrew Sarris considers the &quot;sewing&quot; scene, with its use of &quot;subjective camera&quot; the key psychological moment of the film:

== Accolades ==
In 1999, &quot;The Docks of New York&quot; was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and recommended for preservation.

<text>Dog Star Man is a series of short experimental films, all directed by Stan Brakhage, featuring Jane Wodening. It was released in installments between 1961 and 1964 and comprises a prelude and four parts. In 1992, &quot;Dog Star Man&quot; was included in its entirety in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and recommended for preservation.

Described as a &quot;cosmological epic&quot; and &quot;creation myth&quot; (particularly the &quot;Prelude&quot;), &quot;Dog Star Man&quot; illustrates the odyssey of a bearded woodsman (Brakhage) climbing through a snow-covered mountain with his dog to chop down a tree. While doing so, he witnesses various mystical visions with various recurring imagery such as a woman, child, nature, and the cosmos while making his ascent.

The five short films all form one larger film, and they are almost always shown together as one film. In 1965, Brakhage used the same footage from &quot;Dog Star Man&quot; and re-edited it into a much longer film, &quot;The Art of Vision&quot;. Both are generally considered the greatest works of his first mature period.

== Background ==
After editing and completing &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle,&quot; Brakhage began filming &quot;Dog Star Man.&quot; At the time when he began work on the project, Brakhage had not set on any particular idea on what the project would be about. In addition to this, he had also faced different sets of crisis including the questioning of his distant relationship with his wife Jane at the time, experiencing visions, and contemplations of death and decay. The filming of &quot;Dog Star Man&quot; took on gradually as Brakhage also worked on &quot;The Dead.&quot;

== Structure ==
Ever since he commissioned the idea of the project, Brakhage had already had a prelude and four parts in mind. &quot;Dog Star Man,&quot; like Brakhage&#x27;s other works, is characterized and known for their abstract imagery and techniques such as scratching and punching holes into the film. While the work is considered difficult and unorthodox by many, there is a general structure to the narrative of the film cycle that comprises the prelude and four parts. 
=== Prelude ===
The opening of &quot;Dog Star Man&quot; is entitled &quot;Prelude&quot; and runs at around 26 minutes, making it one of the longer parts of the film cycle. Brakhage described the &quot;Prelude&quot; as a &quot;created dream&quot; for the film as opposed to Surrealism in which the work itself is inspired by the dream of the artist. In it, the &quot;Prelude&quot; contains many of the images that recur throughout the rest of the film series, creating a visual leitmotif of the many symbols and concepts of the series of films. There are also many instances to what Brakhage calls &quot;close-eyed vision&quot;. Broadly, the &quot;Prelude&quot; exemplifies, among other things, the creation of the universe.

=== Part I ===
The longest of the film cycle, running at about 30 minutes, &quot;Part I&quot; comprises most of the narrative of the film cycle in which the woodsman struggles with his journey up the mountain along with his dog. Unlike the &quot;Prelude,&quot; where there are many instances of superimposed images that are more abstract to the eye, &quot;Part I&quot; is more impressionistic. Major parts of the film are in slow-motion; others, in time-lapse photography, speeding up motion. One of the most important images in &quot;Part I&quot; is the mountain that Brakhage attempts to climb.

=== Part II ===
In contrast to the lengthy running times of the earlier films, &quot;Part II&quot; begins a series of shorter segments that run from around 5–7 minutes. Its central focus is on the birth of a child which was filmed on black and white film stock as a part of Brakhage&#x27;s home movies that he shot during the time; stylistically, the filming of childbirth in an almost documentary-like way is quite similar to &quot;Window Water Baby Moving&quot;. Two layers of imagery are imposed over one another, suggesting that the woodsman&#x27;s life is passing right before his eyes.

==Legacy==
The entire film (Prelude and Parts 1 through 4) was named to the National Film Registry in 1992.

Below are the individual films of the series and their release dates:
* &quot;Prelude: Dog Star Man&quot; (1961)
