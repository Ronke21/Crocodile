<doc id="67533" wikidata="Q1154521" url="?curid=67533" title="Economy of Australia">
<text>Australia is a highly developed country with a mixed economy. As of 2023, Australia was the 14th-largest national economy by nominal GDP (gross domestic product), the 19th-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP, and was the 21st-largest goods exporter and 24th-largest goods importer. Australia took the record for the longest run of uninterrupted GDP growth in the developed world with the March 2017 financial quarter. It was the 103rd quarter and the 26th year since the country had a technical recession (two consecutive quarters of negative growth). As of June 2021, the country&#x27;s GDP was estimated at $1.98 trillion.

The Australian economy is dominated by its service sector, which in 2017 comprised 62.7% of the GDP and employed 78.8% of the labour force. At the height of the mining boom in 2009–10, the total value-added of the mining industry was 8.4% of GDP. Despite the recent decline in the mining sector, the Australian economy has remained resilient and stable and did not experience a recession from 1991 until 2020. Among OECD members, Australia has a highly efficient and strong social security system, which comprises roughly 25% of GDP. 

The Australian Securities Exchange in Sydney is the 16th-largest stock exchange in the world in terms of domestic market capitalisation and has one of the largest interest rate derivatives markets in the Asia-Pacific region. Some of Australia&#x27;s largest companies include Commonwealth Bank, BHP, CSL, Westpac, NAB, ANZ, Fortescue, Wesfarmers, Macquarie Group, Woolworths Group, Rio Tinto, Telstra, Woodside Energy and Transurban. The currency of Australia and its territories is the Australian dollar, which it shares with several Pacific nation states.

Australia&#x27;s economy is strongly intertwined with the countries of East and Southeast Asia, also known as ASEAN Plus Three (APT), accounting for about 64% of exports in 2016. China in particular is Australia&#x27;s main export and import partner by a wide margin. Australia is a member of the APEC, G20, OECD and WTO. The country has also entered into free trade agreements with ASEAN, Canada, Chile, China, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Japan, Singapore, Thailand and the United States. The ANZCERTA agreement with New Zealand has greatly increased integration with the economy of New Zealand.

==History==
===20th century===
Australia&#x27;s average GDP growth rate for the period 1901–2000 was 3.4% annually. As opposed to many neighbouring Southeast Asian countries, the process towards independence was relatively peaceful and thus did not have significant negative impact on the economy and standard of living. Growth peaked during the 1920s, followed by the 1950s and the 1980s. By contrast, the late 1910s/early 1920s, the 1930s, the 1970s and early 1990s were marked by financial crises.

====Economic liberalisation====

From the early 1980s onwards, the Australian economy has undergone intermittent economic liberalisation. In 1983, under prime minister Bob Hawke, but mainly driven by treasurer Paul Keating, the Australian dollar was floated and financial deregulation was undertaken.

====Early 1990s recession====

The early 1990s recession came swiftly after the Black Monday of October 1987, as a result of a stock collapse of unprecedented size which caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average to fall by 22.6%. This collapse, larger than the stock market crash of 1929, was handled effectively by the global economy and the stock market began to quickly recover. But in North America, the lumbering savings and loans industry was facing decline, which eventually led to a savings and loan crisis which compromised the well-being of millions of US people. The following recession thus impacted the many countries closely linked to the US, including Australia. Paul Keating, who was treasurer at the time, famously referred to it as &quot;the recession that Australia had to have.&quot; During the recession, GDP fell by 1.7%, employment by 3.4% and the unemployment rate rose to 10.8%. However, the recession did assist in reducing long-term inflation rate expectations and Australia has maintained a low inflation environment since the 1990s to the present day.

===Mining===

Mining has contributed to Australia&#x27;s high level of economic growth, from the gold rush in the 1840s to the present day. The opportunities for large profits in pastoralism and mining attracted considerable amounts of British capital, while expansion was supported by enormous government outlays for transport, communication, and urban infrastructures, which also depended heavily on British finance. As the economy expanded, large-scale immigration satisfied the growing demand for workers, especially after the end of convict transportation to the eastern mainland in 1840. Australia&#x27;s mining operations secured continued economic growth and Western Australia itself benefited strongly from mining iron ore and gold from the 1960s and 1970s which fuelled the rise of suburbanisation and consumerism in Perth, the capital and most populous city of Western Australia, as well as other regional centres.

===Global financial crisis===
The Australian government stimulus package ($11.8 billion) helped to prevent a recession.

The World Bank expected Australia&#x27;s GDP growth rate to be 3.2% in 2011 and 3.8% in 2012. The economy expanded by 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2011, and expanded by 1.3% in the first quarter of 2012. The growth rate was reported to be 4.3% year-on-year.

The International Monetary Fund in April 2012 predicted that Australia would be the best-performing major advanced economy in the world over the next two years; the Australian Government Department of the Treasury anticipated &quot;forecast growth of 3.0% in 2012 and 3.5% in 2013&quot;, the National Australia Bank in April 2012 cut its growth forecast for Australia to 2.9% from 3.2%., and JP Morgan in May 2012 cut its growth forecast to 2.7% in calendar 2012 from a previous forecast of 3.0%, also its forecast for growth in 2013 to 3.0% from 3.3%. Deutsche Bank in August 2012, and Société Générale in October 2012, warned that there is risk of recession in Australia in 2013.

While Australia&#x27;s overall national economy grew, some non-mining states and Australia&#x27;s non-mining economy experienced a recession.

===2020 recession===
In September 2020, it was confirmed that due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Australian economy had gone into recession for the first time in nearly thirty years, as the country&#x27;s GDP fell 7 per cent in the June 2020 quarter, following a 0.3 per cent drop in the March quarter. It officially ended at the beginning of December 2020.

== Data ==

The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2023 (with IMF staff estimates in 2024–2027). Inflation under 5% is in green.
==Overview==

Australia&#x27;s per-capita GDP is higher than that of the UK, Canada, Germany and France in terms of purchasing power parity. Per Capita GDP (PPP) Australia is ranked 18th in the world (CIA World Factbook 2016). The country was ranked fifth in the United Nations 2022 Human Development Index and sixth in &quot;The Economist&quot; worldwide quality-of-life index 2005. In 2014, using constant exchange rates, Australia&#x27;s wealth had grown by 4.4% annually on average after the financial crisis of 2007–2008, compared with a 9.2% rate over 2000–2007. Australia&#x27;s sovereign credit rating is &quot;AAA&quot; for all three major rating agencies, higher than the United States of America.

The emphasis on exporting commodities rather than manufactures underpinned a significant increase in Australia&#x27;s terms of trade during the rise in commodity prices since 2000. However, due to a colonial heritage a lot of companies operating in Australia are foreign-owned and as a result, Australia has had persistent current account deficits for over 60 years despite periods of positive net merchandise exports; given the net income outlay between Australia and the rest of the world is always negative. The current account deficit totalled AUD$44.5 billion in 2016 or 2.6% of GDP.

Inflation has typically been between 2 and 3% and the pre-GFC cash rate typically ranged between 5 and 7%, however, partly in response to the end of the mining boom the cash rate has recently been steadily falling, dropping from 4.75% in October 2011 to 1.5% in Aug 2016, then to 1.25% in June 2019 and 1.0% in July 2019. The service sector of the economy, including tourism, education and financial services, constitutes 69% of GDP. Australian National University in Canberra also provides a probabilistic interest-rate-setting project for the Australian economy, which is compiled by shadow board members from the ANU academic staff.

Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural products, particularly wheat and wool, minerals such as iron ore and gold, and energy in the forms of liquified natural gas and coal. Although agriculture and natural resources constitute only 3% and 5% of GDP, respectively, they contribute substantially to Australia&#x27;s export composition. Australia&#x27;s largest export markets are Japan, China, South Korea, India and the United States.

At the turn of the current century, Australia experienced a significant mining boom. The mining sector&#x27;s contribution to overall GDP grew from around 4.5% in 1993–94, to almost 8% in 2006–07. The services sector also grew considerably, with property and business services in particular growing from 10% to 14.5% of GDP over the same period, making it the largest single component of GDP (in sectoral terms). This growth has largely been at the expense of the manufacturing sector, which in 2006–07 accounted for around 12% of GDP. A decade earlier, it was the largest sector in the economy, accounting for just over 15% of GDP.

In 2018 Australia became the country with the largest median wealth per adult, but slipped back to second highest after Switzerland in 2019. Australia&#x27;s total wealth was estimated to be AUD$10.9 trillion as of September 2019.

===Regional differences===
Between 2010 and 2013, much of the economic growth in Australia was attributed to areas of the country where mining- and resource-based industries and services are mostly located. Western Australia and the Northern Territory are the only states that have economic growth. During 2012 and 2013 Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria experienced recessions at various times. The Australian economy is characterised as a &quot;two-speed economy&quot;. From June 2012 to March 2013 Victoria experienced a recession. In 2012 the Government of Victoria cut 10% of all jobs in the public service. The period since has seen these trends reversed with Western Australia and Northern Territory, who are heavily dependent on mining, experience significant downturns in GDP while the eastern states returned to growth, led by strong upturns in NSW and Victoria.

===Taxation===
Taxation in Australia is levied at the federal, state, and local government levels. The federal government raises revenue from personal income taxes and business taxes. Other taxes include the goods and services tax (General Service Tax), excise and customs duties. The federal government is the main source of income for state governments. As a result of state dependence on federal taxation revenue to meet decentralised expenditure responsibilities, Australia is said to have a vertical fiscal imbalance.

Besides receipts of funds from the federal government, states and territories have their own taxes, in many cases as slightly different rates. State taxes commonly include payroll tax levied on businesses, a poker-machine tax on businesses that offer gambling services, land tax on people and businesses that own land and most significantly, stamp duty on sales of land (in every state) and other items (chattels in some states, unlisted shares in others, and even sales of contracts in some states).

The states effectively lost the ability to raise income tax during the Second World War. In 1942, Canberra invoked its Constitutional taxation power (s. 51 (ii)) and enacted the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot; and three other statutes to levy a uniform income tax across the country. These acts sought to raise the funds necessary to meet burgeoning wartime expenses and reduce the unequal tax burden between the states by replacing state income taxes with a centralised tax system. The legislation could not expressly prohibit state income taxes (s. 51(ii) does not curtail the power of states to levy taxes) but the federal government&#x27;s proposal made localised income tax extremely difficult politically. The federal government offered instead compensatory grants authorised by s. 96 of the Constitution for the loss of state income (&quot;State Grants (Income Tax Reimbursement) Act 1942&quot;).

The states rejected Canberra&#x27;s regime and challenged the legislation&#x27;s validity in the First Uniform Tax Case (&quot;South Australia v Commonwealth&quot;) of 1942. The High Court of Australia held that each of the statutes establishing Commonwealth income tax was a valid use of the s. 51(ii) power, in which Latham CJ noted that the system did not undermine essential state functions and imposed only economic and political pressure upon them.

The Second Uniform Tax Case (&quot;Victoria v Commonwealth&quot; (1957)) reaffirmed the court&#x27;s earlier decision and confirmed the power of the federal government&#x27;s power to make s. 96 grants conditionally (in this case, a grant made on the condition that the recipient state does not levy income tax).

Since the Second Uniform Tax Case, a number of other political and legal decisions have centralised fiscal power with the Commonwealth. In &quot;Ha vs. New South Wales&quot; (1997), the High Court found that the &quot;Business Franchise Licences (Tobacco) Act 1987&quot; (NSW) was invalid because it levied a customs duty, a power exercisable only by the Commonwealth (s.90). This decision effectively invalidated state taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and petrol. Similarly, the imposition of a Commonwealth goods and services tax (GST) in 2000 transferred another revenue base to the Commonwealth.

Consequently, Australia has one of the most pronounced vertical fiscal imbalances in the world: the states and territories collect just 18% of all governmental revenues but are responsible for almost 50% of the spending areas. Furthermore, the centralisation of revenue collection has allowed Canberra to force state policy in areas well beyond the scope of its constitutional powers, by using the grants power (s.96) to mandate the terms on which the states spend money in areas over which it has no power (such as spending on education, health and policing).

Local governments (called &quot;councils&quot; in Australia) have their own taxes (called rates) to enable them to provide services such as local road repairs, local planning and building management, garbage collection, street cleaning, park maintenance services, libraries, and museums. Councils also rely on state and federal funding to provide infrastructure and services such as roads, bridges, sporting facilities and buildings, aged care, maternal and child health, and childcare.

In 2000, a goods and services tax (GST) was introduced, similar to the European-style VAT.

==Employment==
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) seasonally adjusted estimates, the unemployment rate rose 0.1 points to 4.1% in January 2025 while the labour force participation rate increased 0.2 points to 67.3%. The participation rate for 15- to 24-year-olds increased by 0.4 points to 70.7% while the unemployment rate for this group decreased by 0.1 points to 9.1%. According to the ABS, in January 2024, the underemployment rate remained steady at 6.0%, while the underutilisation rate (the unemployed plus the under-employed) decreased by 0.1 points to 10.0% in trend terms.

According to Roy Morgan Research the unemployment rate in April 2019 was 8.9%, while Australian workers who were considered either unemployed or underemployed was estimated to be 17.7% (2.381 million) in the same month. Around 4.219 million were estimated to be in part-time employment.

In 2007, 228,621 Newstart unemployment allowance recipients were registered, a total that increased to 646,414 or 5.3% of the total labour force by March 2013. As of December 2018, the number of Newstart recipients stands at 722,923 or 5.4% of the labour force.

The accuracy of official unemployment figures has been brought into question in the Australian media due to discrepancies between the methods of different research bodies (Roy Morgan versus the ABS), differing definitions of the term &#x27;unemployed&#x27; and the ABS&#x27; practice of counting under-employed people as &quot;employed&quot;.

As of February 2024, the Australia labour force were employed in the following industries (seasonally adjusted) :

===Employment for newly qualified professionals===
According to the Australian Graduate Survey done by &quot;Graduate Careers Australia&quot;, full-time employment for newly qualified professionals from various occupations (around four months after the completion of their qualifications) experienced some declines between 2012 and 2015. Some examples are:

The Graduate Careers Survey 2014 explained, &quot;However, GCA&#x27;s Beyond Graduation Survey (BGS) indicates that the middle- and longer-term outlook is very positive, with the employment figures for 2010 graduates growing by 14 percentage points three years later.&quot; The Beyond Graduation Survey 2013 included 12,384 responses and the Graduate Careers Survey 2014 survey included 113,263 responses (&quot;59.3 per cent of the almost 191,000 Australian resident graduates who were surveyed responded to the AGS.&quot;)

The professional associations of some of these occupations expressed their criticism of the immigration policy in 2014.

==Sectors==

===Industry===

====Mining====

In 2019, the country was the 2nd largest world producer of gold; 8th largest world producer of silver; 6th largest world producer of copper; the world&#x27;s largest producer of iron ore; the world&#x27;s largest producer of bauxite; the 2nd largest world producer of manganese; 2nd largest world producer of lead; 3rd largest world producer of zinc; 3rd largest world producer of cobalt; 3rd largest producer of uranium; 6th largest producer of nickel; 8th largest world producer of tin; 14th largest world producer of phosphate; 15th largest world producer of sulfur; in addition to being the 5th largest world producer of salt. The country is also a major producer of precious stones. Australia is the world&#x27;s largest producer of opal and is one of the largest producers of diamond, ruby, sapphire and jade. In non-renewable energies, in 2020, the country was the 30th largest producer of oil in the world, extracting 351.1 thousand barrels / day. In 2019, the country consumed 1 million barrels / day (20th largest consumer in the world). The country was the 20th largest oil importer in the world in 2018 (461.9 thousand barrels / day). In 2015, Australia was the 12th largest world producer of natural gas, 67.2 billion m3 per year. In 2019, the country was the 22nd largest gas consumer (41.9 billion m3 per year) and was the 10th largest gas exporter in the world in 2015: 34.0 billion m3 per year. In the production of coal, the country was the 4th largest in the world in 2018: 481.3 million tons. Australia is the 2nd largest coal exporter in the world (387 million tons in 2018).

In 2014–15 mineral extraction in Australia was valued at 212 billion Australian dollars. Of this, coal represented 45,869 million, oil and natural gas 40,369 million, iron ore 69,486 million, gold ore 13,685 million, and other metals 7,903 million.

Coal is mined primarily in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Fifty-four per cent of the coal mined in Australia is exported, mostly to East Asia. In 2000–01, 258.5 million tonnes of coal was mined, and 193.6 million tonnes exported. Coal provides about 85% of Australia&#x27;s electricity production. In fiscal year 2008–09, 487 million tonnes of coal was mined, and 261 million tonnes exported. Australia is the world&#x27;s leading coal exporter.

The Australian mining corporations Rio Tinto Group and BHP are among the largest in the world.

Rio Tinto&#x27;s Argyle mine in Western Australia was the second-largest diamond mine in the world. The Argyle mine opened in 1983 and has produced more than 95 per cent of Australia&#x27;s diamonds, including some of the world&#x27;s most valuable pink and red diamonds. Due to the depletion of ore, Argyle closed in 2020—the closure was expected to reduce Australia&#x27;s yearly diamond output from 14.2 million carats to 134.7 thousand carats.

====Manufacturing====

The manufacturing industry in Australia has declined from 30% of GDP in the 1960s to 12% of GDP in 2007.

In 2008, four companies mass-produced cars in Australia. Mitsubishi ceased production in March 2008, followed by Ford in 2016, and Holden and Toyota in 2017.

Until trade liberalisation in the mid-1980s, Australia had a large textile industry. This decline continued through the first decade of the 21st century. Since the 1980s, tariffs have steadily been reduced; in early 2010, the tariffs were reduced from 17.5 per cent to 10 per cent on clothing, and 7.5–10% to 5% for footwear and other textiles.
As of 2010, most textile manufacturing, even by Australian companies, is performed in Asia.
====Agriculture====

In 2019, the value added from agriculture, fishing and forestry combined made up approximately 2.1% of Australia&#x27;s GDP. 60% of farm products are exported. Irrigation is an important and widespread practice for a country where many parts receive low rainfall. Agriculture, forestry and fishing was the second-strongest industry from 2013 to 2015, with the number of employees growing from 295,495 in February 2013 to 325,321 in February 2015.

===Services===
IT-related jobs (such as computer systems design and engineering) are defined as Professional, Scientific and Technical Services by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations of Australia. IT job creation occurs mostly in the state capital cities of Australia.

====Finance====
Australia&#x27;s &quot;big four banks&quot; (National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and Westpac) are among the &#x27;World&#x27;s 50 Safest Banks&#x27; as of April 2012.

Between 1991 and 2013, 36,720 mergers and acquisitions with a total known value of US$2,040 billion with the involvement of Australian firms have been announced. In the year 2013, 1,515 transactions valued at US$78 billion had been announced which was a decrease in terms of numbers (−18%) and value (−11%) compared to 2012. The largest takeover or merger transaction involving Australian companies was the 2007 takeover of the Coles Group by Wesfarmers, totalling A$22 billion.

====Tourism====
In the financial year 2017/18, tourism represented 3.1% of Australia&#x27;s GDP contributing A$57.2 billion to the national economy. Domestic tourism is a significant part of the tourism industry, representing 73% of the total direct tourism GDP.

In calendar year 2018, there were 9.3 million visitor arrivals. Tourism employed 646,000 people in Australia in 2017–18, 5.2% of the workforce. About 43.7% of persons employed in tourism were part-time. Tourism also contributed 8.0% of Australia&#x27;s total export earnings in 2010–11.

==== Creativity and culture ====
Growing importance is being given to the economic contribution of the creative industries to the national economy. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) recompiles statistics about the export and import of goods and services related to the creative industries. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has assisted in the preparation of national studies measuring the size of over 50 copyright industries around the world. According to the WIPO compiled data, the national contribution of Creative industries varies from 2% to 11% depending on the country.

The Australian Copyright Council (ACC) has been consistently compiling reports using the WIPO-guided framework on the impact of the copyright-based industries to Australia&#x27;s economy in 2011, 2012, and 2014. In the most up-to-date WIPO-supported study published in 2017, the copyright industries contributed $122.8 billion to the Australian economy in 2016 amounting to 7.4% of Australia&#x27;s total economic output. The 2016 figure represented an increase of $8.5 billion compared to 2011, with a growth in value added growing at 1.4% per annum (since 2011). Further, it found that these industries generated more economic output than the manufacturing, health care and mining sectors in 2016, and moved from being the 7th largest industry in 2011 to the 3rd in 2016.

====Media====

In 2018, Australia was ranked 19th out of 180 countries in accordance to press freedom. The media industry is highly consolidated, with News Corp Australia and Nine Entertainment publishing the majority of popular newspapers, owning multiple television and radio stations, and providing the two major Australian streaming services, Binge and Stan. Other major media companies include Ten Network, Seven West Media and the national broadcasters ABC and SBS.

====Education====

School attendance is compulsory in Australia, from the age of 5 up until approximately 16 (although it varies between each state and territory). Australia also has an adult literacy rate that was estimated to be 99% in 2003.

In the Programme for International Student Assessment, Australia regularly scores among the top five of thirty major developed countries (member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). In 2018 there were 525,054 international students in Australia, comprising a market of 32,2 billion A$.

====Logistics====
==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Australia&#x27;s total transport activity contributed 7.9% to GDP in 2020–21, being highly dependent on road transport. It is estimated that roads contribute to more than A$245 billion, to the economic activity, significantly serving to agriculture, forestry, fishing, manufacturing and construction industries. There are more than 300 airports with paved runways. Passenger rail transport includes widespread commuter networks in the major capital cities with more limited intercity and interstate networks. The Australian mining sector is reliant upon rail to transport its product to Australia&#x27;s ports for export.

===Energy===
The Australian economy is dependent on imported crude oil and petroleum products, the economy&#x27;s petroleum import dependency is around 80%—crude oil + petroleum products.

==Trade and economic performance==

In the second half of the 20th century, Australian trade shifted away from Europe and North America to Japan and other East Asian markets. Regional franchising businesses, now a $128 billion sector, have been operating co-branded sites overseas for years with new investors coming from Western Australia and Queensland.

In the late 19th century, Australia&#x27;s economic strength relative to the rest of the world was reflected in its GDP. In 1870, Australia had the highest GDP per capita in the world due to economic growth fuelled by its natural resources. However, as Australia&#x27;s population grew rapidly over the 20th century, its GDP per capita dropped relative to countries such as the US and Norway. However, the Australian economy has been performing nominally better than other economies of the OECD and has supported economic growth for over 20 consecutive years. According to the Reserve Bank of Australia, Australian per capita GDP growth is higher than that of New Zealand, US, Canada and The Netherlands. The past performance of the Australian economy has been heavily influenced by US, Japanese and Chinese economic growth.

===Australian national debt===
Australia&#x27;s net external debt exceeded $1 trillion in April 2017 as a result of Australia&#x27;s structural current account deficits. Although these deficits have narrowed over the last decade due to an increase in net merchandise trade, this effect has been partly offset by the return of Australian government debt; net federal debt was estimated at $326.0 billion in the 2016–17 federal budget of which 60% is owed to foreigners. The entirety of the debt has been accumulated through ten straight budget deficits as Australia had negative net government debt (i.e. The Australian government had net positive bond holdings) a decade earlier in the 2006–07 fiscal year.

===Chinese investment===
There is substantial export to China of iron ore, wool and other raw materials, and over 120,000 Chinese students study in Australian schools and universities. China is the largest purchaser of Australian debt. In 2009, offers were made by state-owned Chinese companies to invest $22 billion in Australia&#x27;s resource extraction industry.

The Signing of the China-Australia Free-Trade Agreement, signed November 2014, has the potential to drastically increase Chinese Investments as agriculture and services become more lenient.

Australia&#x27;s special investor visa program introduced in 2012 encouraged Chinese investment. The visa program fast-tracks visas and eases the residency requirement for a permanent visa for those ready to invest over five million Australian dollars into state government bonds, specific infrastructure and property investments. Wealthy Chinese interested in direct investment began looking to Australia after Canada started scaling back its investment visa program in 2012 and eliminated its main investor visa program in 2014. In early 2014 it was reported that the Australia&#x27;s special investor visa was granted to 65 mostly Chinese millionaires who brought over $440 million into the country. By 2017, almost 90% of the more than 1,300 foreigners who used Australia&#x27;s special investor visa program were from China. Australia also has an investor visa program with a required investment of one million Australian dollars but with more restrictions and a lengthier period of time to get a permanent visa.

In 2017, it was reported that Australia is the third-most popular destination for Chinese to invest wealth offshore, with a 7% increase in Chinese private wealth flowing into Australia while interest in the top two investment destinations, Hong Kong and the United States, fell by 18% and 3%, respectively. In 2017 there were 1.6 million high-net-worth Chinese (with at least 10 million Chinese yuan to invest) and 24 per cent of the 3,000 wealthy Chinese surveyed had private investments in Australia. Migration was one of the top three reasons for Chinese investment offshore.

In 2018, in the Lowy Institute poll there had a sharp rise in the proportion of the Australian population who say the Australian government is &quot;allowing too much investment from China&quot;.

This number rose from 56 per cent in 2014 to 72 per cent in 2018.

===Australia&#x27;s balance of payments===

In trade terms, the Australian economy has had persistently large current account deficits (CADs) for more than 50 years. One of the factors that undermines balance of payments is Australia&#x27;s export base, making it highly vulnerable to the volatility in the prices of commodity goods. In addition, due to a colonial heritage a lot of companies operating in Australia are foreign-owned and, as a result, Australia&#x27;s net income outlay between it and the rest of the world is always negative; this results in persistent current account deficits even when there is a positive export.

Dependent upon commodities, the Australian government endeavoured to redevelop the Australian manufacturing sector. This initiative, also known as microeconomic reform, helped Australian manufacturing to grow from 10.1% in 1983–1984 to 17.8% in 2003–2004.

There are other factors that have contributed to the extremely high current account deficit in Australia such as lack of international competitiveness.

However, as Australia&#x27;s CAD is almost entirely generated by the private sector, as outlined in Professor John Pitchford&#x27;s &#x27;Consenting Adults Thesis&#x27; in the early 1990s, there is an argument that the CAD is not a significant issue. Historically, Australia has relied on overseas capital to fill the gap between domestic savings and investment, and many of these investment opportunities could not have been pursued if Australia did not have access to foreign savings. This suggests that Australia&#x27;s apparently low savings level and CAD are not necessarily a significant problem. As long as the investment that is being funded by overseas capital inflow generates sufficient returns to pay for the servicing costs in the future, the increase in foreign liabilities can be viewed as sustainable in the longer term.

===Personal wealth===

According to the 2011 Credit Suisse Global Wealth report, Australia&#x27;s wealth per adult had quadrupled over the past decade, and its total wealth was US$6.4 trillion. In the report Australia was the second-wealthiest country in the world behind Switzerland based on average wealth per adult, and had the highest median wealth in the world (US$222,000, nearly four times the amount of each US adult) and a proportion of people with wealth above US$100,000 that was eight times the world average. This was attributed to a resilient Australian dollar, property ownership levels and a strong labour market. Compared to the rest of the world, very few Australians had a net worth of less than US$1,000, which was attributed to relatively low credit card and student loan debt. In 2013, Australia was identified by the Credit Suisse as retaining its 2012 position as the nation with the second-highest average wealth per adult (US$403,000); however, the nation&#x27;s poverty rate was also reported to have increased from 10.2% in 2000–01 to 11.8% at the time of the 2013 report on global wealth.

Despite the economic slowdown, in the 2014 Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report, Australia continued to have the second-highest average wealth per adult (US$430,800) and the highest median wealth (US$225,400), with a total wealth of $7.2 trillion. The average level of real assets (US$319,700) was the second-highest in the world after Norway and 60% of gross household assets. The report explained that this partly reflects a large endowment of land and natural resources relative to population, and also high urban real estate prices. Only 6% of Australians had a net worth below US$10,000, compared to 29% in the US and 70% for the world as a whole. The average debt was 20% of gross assets. The proportion of people with wealth above US$100,000 was the highest in the world (eight times the world average). Australia had 3.8% (1,783,000 people) of the top 1% of global wealth holders while having 0.4% of the world&#x27;s adult population. The wealth share by Australia&#x27;s top decile was 51.1% in 2000, 50.7% in 2007, and 51.1% in 2014. In 2016, Australia continued to be the second-wealthiest nation in terms of wealth per adult.

In 2017, Australia was the world&#x27;s top destination for millionaires, beating the United States for the second consecutive year. An estimated 11,000 millionaires moved to Australia in 2016, compared with the 10,000 who moved to the United States. Australia was especially attractive to Chinese millionaires due to its relative proximity, cleaner environment, political and economic stability, and investor visa programs. Also, the primary reason for millionaires leaving China is top schools abroad that will give their children a better education and career connections.

=== Mergers and acquisitions ===
All in all over 43,150 deals have been completed national, inbound or outbound Australia. This cumulates to an overall value of US$2,554 billion. There was a strong upward trend between 1989 and 2007. In this peak year almost 3,100 deals took place, which is almost 60% more than in 2017, the current low. Australian companies are particularly investing in the fields of metals and minerals (15% of all deals from Australia into foreign countries). Runner-up is the oil and gas industry with only 6.4%.

Here is a list of the top 10 deals with participation of Australian companies as the acquirer or target company:
==Poverty==
In 2022 ACOSS released a report revealing that poverty is growing in Australia, with an estimated 3.3 million people, or 13.5% of the population, living below the internationally accepted poverty line of 50% of a country&#x27;s median income. It also estimated that there are 761,000 (17.7%) children under the age of 15 that are in poverty. Indigenous Australians face significantly higher poverty rates, with 30% of Indigenous households in income poverty, emerging as the most socially and economically deprived group in Australia.

==Homelessness==
There were 105,237 people experiencing homelessness in Australia on census night in 2011. This equated to 1 in 200 Australians, and represented an increase of 17% from the 2006 census, with the rate of homelessness increasing from 45 per 10,000 to 49 per 10,000.

The number of homeless people in Australia jumped by more than 14,000—or 14 per cent—in the five years to 2016, according to census data. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said 116,000 people were homeless on census night in 2016, representing 50 homeless people per 10,000.

<text>The Paralympic Games or Paralympics is a periodic series of international multisport events involving athletes with a range of disabilities. There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games, which since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, have been held shortly after the corresponding Olympic Games. All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).

The Paralympics began as a small gathering of British World War II veterans in 1948. The 1960 Games in Rome drew 400 athletes with disabilities from 23 countries, as proposed by doctor Antonio Maglio. Currently it is one of the largest international sporting events: the 2020 Summer Paralympics featuring 4,520 athletes from 163 National Paralympic Committees. Paralympians strive for equal treatment with non-disabled Olympic athletes, but there is a large funding gap between Olympic and Paralympic athletes.

The Paralympic Games are organized in parallel with and in a similar way to the Olympic Games. The IOC-recognized Special Olympics World Games include athletes with intellectual disabilities (although since 1992, people with intellectual disabilities also participate in the Paralympic Games), and the Deaflympics held since 1924 are exclusive for deaf athletes.

Given the wide variety of disabilities of Para athletes, there are several categories in which they compete. The allowable disabilities are divided into ten eligible impairment types: impaired muscle power, impaired passive range of movement, limb deficiency, leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and intellectual impairment. These categories are further divided into various subcategories.

== Forerunners ==
=== Athletes with disabilities at the Olympic Games ===
Athletes with disabilities did compete at the Olympic Games prior to the advent of the Paralympics. The first athlete to do so was German-American gymnast George Eyser in 1904, who had one artificial leg. Olivér Halassy, a Hungarian amputee water polo player, competed in three successive Olympic Games, beginning in 1928. Hungarian Károly Takács competed in shooting events in both the 1948 and 1952 Summer Olympics. He was a right-arm amputee and could shoot left-handed. Another athlete with a disability who appeared in the Olympics prior to the Paralympic Games was Lis Hartel, a Danish equestrian athlete who had contracted polio in 1943 and won a silver medal in the dressage event in the 1952 Summer Olympics.

=== Stoke Mandeville Games ===
The first organized athletic event for athletes with disabilities that coincided with the Olympic Games took place on the day of the opening of the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. The German-Jewish doctor Ludwig Guttmann, of Stoke Mandeville Hospital, who had fled Nazi Germany with the help of the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (CARA) in 1939, hosted a sports competition for British World War II veteran patients with spinal cord injuries. The first games were called the 1948 International Wheelchair Games, and were intended to coincide with the 1948 Olympics. Guttman&#x27;s aim was to create an elite sports competition for people with disabilities that would be equivalent to the Olympic Games. The games were held at the same location each year, and in 1952 Dutch and Israeli veterans took part alongside the British, making it the first international competition of its own kind. In 1960, the 9th annual games took place outside of the UK for the first time in Rome, to coincide with the 1960 Summer Olympics which were also being held in Rome. These were to be later designated the 1st Paralympic Games.

These early competitions have been described as the precursors of the Paralympic Games, and Stoke Mandeville holds a similar place in the history of the Paralympic movement as Greece holds in the Olympic Games; since 2012, the Paralympic flame has incorporated a &quot;heritage flame&quot; lit at Stoke Mandeville, although it was combined with flames lit in the host country for the formal start of the torch relay. Beginning in 2024, future Paralympic torch relays will officially begin in Stoke Mandeville, as an equivalent to the Olympic flame being created in Olympia.

==Milestones==

There have been several milestones in the Paralympic movement. The first official Paralympic Games, coincident with the ninth Stoke Mandeville Games but no longer open solely to war veterans, was held in Rome in 1960. They were the brainchild of Antonio Maglio, a friend and follower of Guttmann and were financed almost entirely by Maglio&#x27;s employer, the Workers National Accident Insurance Fund of Italy, then led by Renato Morelli, who was also Chairman of the International Social Security Association. Four hundred athletes from 23 countries competed at the 1960 Games. Since 1960, the Paralympic Games have taken place in the same year as the Olympic Games. The Games were initially open only to athletes in wheelchairs; at the 1976 Summer Games, athletes with different disabilities were included for the first time at a Summer Paralympics. With the inclusion of more disability classifications the 1976 Summer Games expanded to 1,600 athletes from 40 countries. 

The 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul was another milestone for the Paralympic movement. It was in Seoul that the Paralympic Summer Games were held directly after the 1988 Summer Olympics, in the same host city, and using the majority of the venues. This set a precedent that was followed in 1992, 1996 and 2000. It was eventually formalized in an agreement between the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2001, and was extended through 2020. On March 10, 2018, the two committees further extended their contract to 2032. Despite being held in the same region, the 1992 Winter Paralympics used different competition venues than those used for the Olympic Games. 1994 Winter Paralympics were the first Winter Games to use the same venues and had the same Organizing Committee as the Winter Olympics.

==Winter Games==

The first Winter Paralympic Games were held in 1976 in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. This was the first Paralympics in which multiple categories of athletes with disabilities could compete. The Winter Games were celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart, just as the Olympics were. This tradition was upheld through the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, the Winter Paralympics and the Winter Olympics have been held in those even-numbered years separate from the Summer Olympics. The winter games happen two years after the summer games.

==International Paralympic Committee==
The International Paralympic Committee is the global governing body of the Paralympic Movement. It comprises 178 National Paralympic Committees (NPC) and four disability-specific international sports federations. The president of the IPC is Andrew Parsons. The IPC&#x27;s international headquarters are in Bonn, Germany. The IPC is responsible for organizing the Summer and Winter Paralympic Games. It also serves as the International Federation for nine sports (Paralympic athletics, Paralympic swimming, Paralympic archery, Paralympic powerlifting, Para-alpine skiing, Paralympic biathlon, Paralympic cross-country skiing, ice sledge hockey and Wheelchair DanceSport). This requires the IPC to supervise and coordinate the World Championships and other competitions for each of the nine sports it regulates. 

IPC membership also includes National Paralympic Committees and international sporting federations. International Federations are independent sport federations recognized by the IPC as the sole representative of a Paralympic Sport. International Federations responsibilities include technical jurisdiction and guidance over the competition and training venues of their respective sports during the Paralympic Games. The IPC also recognizes media partners, certifies officials, judges, and is responsible for enforcing the bylaws of the Paralympic Charter.

Since its creation in 1989, IPC has a cooperative relationship with the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Delegates of the IPC are also members of the IOC and participate on IOC committees and commissions. The two governing bodies remain distinct, with separate Games, despite the close working relationship.
The Paralympic Games were designed to emphasize the participants&#x27; athletic achievements and not their disability. Recent games have emphasized that these games are about ability and not disability. The movement has grown dramatically since its early days – for example, the number of athletes participating in the Summer Paralympic Games has increased from 400 athletes in Rome in 1960 to 4,342 athletes from 159 countries in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. Both the Paralympic Summer and Winter Games are recognized on the world stage.

Unlike the Olympic Games, English is the official language of the Paralympic movement. The other languages used at each Paralympic Games are the official languages of the host country or host region. Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these two or more languages.

==Name and symbols==
Although the name was originally coined as a portmanteau combining &quot;paraplegic&quot; (due to its origins as games for people with spinal injuries) and &quot;Olympic&quot;, the inclusion of other disability groups meant that this was no longer considered very accurate. The present formal explanation for the name is that it derives from the Greek preposition , (&#x27;beside&#x27; or &#x27;alongside&#x27;) and thus refers to a competition held in parallel with the Olympic Games. The Summer Games of 1988 held in Seoul was the first time the term &quot;Paralympic&quot; came into official use.

&quot;Spirit in Motion&quot; is the current motto for the Paralympic movement. The current Paralympic flag is used since 2020 and contains three colours, red, blue, and green, which are the colours most widely represented in the flags of nations. The colours are each in the shape of an Agito (which is Latin for &#x27;I move/I shake/I stir&#x27;), which is the name given to an asymmetrical crescent specially designed for the Paralympic movement. The three Agitos circle a central point, which is a symbol for the athletes congregating from all points of the globe. The motto and symbol of the IPC were changed in 2003 to their current versions. The change was intended to convey the idea that Paralympians have a spirit of competition and that the IPC as an organization realizes its potential and is moving forward to achieve it. The vision of the IPC is, &quot;To enable Paralympic athletes to achieve sporting excellence and to inspire and excite the world.&quot; The Paralympic anthem is &quot;Hymne de l&#x27;Avenir&quot; or &quot;Anthem of the Future&quot;. It was composed by Thierry Darnis and adopted as the official anthem in March 1996.

==Ceremonies==
===Opening===

As mandated by the Paralympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremonies of the Paralympic Games. Most of these rituals were established are the same that 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp and were shared with the Olympic Games. The Opening ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country&#x27;s flag and a performance of its national anthem. Immediately after the welcome act and the host country anthem and hosting their flag the &quot;Parade of Nations&quot; starts with the athletes into the stadium grouped by nation. Since the 1960 Summer Paralympics, the nations enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country&#x27;s or region official language, though with the host country&#x27;s athletes being the last to enter. Beginning with the 2020 Summer Paralympics, the succeeding hosts of the respective Olympic Games (summer or winter) will enter immediately before the current host in descending order. The host nation presents artistic displays of their culture and folklore.

Protocolary segments are held with the speeches given, formally opening the games. After the opening declaration, the Paralympic flag enters the stadium and is hosted along with the Paralympic Anthem, aside from the host country flag, and the oaths by athletes, coaches, and judges are taken. Finally, the Paralympic flame is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier—often a Paralympic athlete from the host nation—who lights the Paralympic flame in the stadium&#x27;s cauldron.

===Closing===
The closing ceremony of the Paralympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction.
The Paralympic flag is taken down. Since the 1988 Winter Paralympics, with some exceptions, the national flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Paralympic Games is hoisted while the corresponding national anthem is played. The games are officially closed, and the Paralympic flame is extinguished. After these compulsory elements, the next host nation briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture.

===Medal presentation===

A medals ceremony is held after the conclusion of each Paralympic event. The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum when they are awarded their respective medal by an IPC member. The national flags of the medalists are then raised while the national anthem of the gold medalist is played. Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers. For every Paralympic event, the respective medal ceremony is held, at most, one day after the event&#x27;s final.

==Equality==
===Relationship with the Olympics===
In June 2001, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) signed an agreement that would ensure that the staging of the Paralympic Games is automatically included in the bid for the Olympic Games. The agreement was set to take effect at the 2008 Paralympic Summer Games in Beijing and the 2010 Paralympic Winter Games in Vancouver. However, the Salt Lake 2002 Organizing Committee (SLOC) chose to follow the practice of &quot;one bid, one city&quot;, with one Organizing Committee for both Games, which was followed up by the 2004 Summer Games in Athens. The agreement was adjusted in 2003. An extension was signed in June 2006, after some troubles at the 2006 Winter Paralympics. Initially agreed to remain in effect until the 2012 Summer Olympics, this was later extended to encompass all Summer and Winter games up until the 2020 Summer Olympics. Even beyond this, all Summer and Winter host cities announced are preparing pairs of Olympic and Paralympics Games. This was further confirmed when on 10 March 2018, the IOC and the IPC agreed to further extend the contract to the 2032 Summer Olympics.

The IOC has written its commitment to equal access to athletics for all people into its charter, which states,
While the charter is silent on discrimination specifically related to disability; given the language in the charter regarding discrimination it is reasonable to infer that discrimination on the basis of disability would be against the ideals of the Olympic Charter and the IOC. This is also consistent with the Paralympic Charter, which forbids discrimination on the basis of political, religious, economic, disability, gender, sexual orientation or racial reasons.

Chairman of the London organising committee, Sebastian Coe, said about the 2012 Summer Paralympics and 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England, that, &quot;We want to change public attitudes towards disability, celebrate the excellence of Paralympic sport and to enshrine from the very outset that the two Games are an integrated whole.&quot;

The 2014 Winter Paralympic Games is the first such Paralympics hosted by Russia. Russia ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities during that period. Notably at 2010 Vancouver, their Paralympic team topped the medal table at the Winter Paralympics, while their Olympic team performed well below expectations at the Winter Olympics. This led the media to highlight the contrast between the achievements of the country&#x27;s Olympic and Paralympic delegations, despite the greater attention and funding awarded to the Olympic athletes. The Russian Federation organizers of the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games have, since 2007, made efforts to make the host city Sochi more accessible.

In 2012, as part of its prohibition on unauthorised advertising, the Paralympic movement began requiring any tattoo of the Olympic rings to be covered during competition, on the basis that the Olympics is technically a third-party organisation. In 2024 the prohibition was ended after protests from athletes.

====Paralympians at the Olympics====
Paralympic athletes have sought equal opportunities to compete at the Olympic Games. The precedent was set by Neroli Fairhall, a Paralympic archer from New Zealand, who competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.
In 2008, Oscar Pistorius, a South African sprinter, attempted to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Pistorius had both his legs amputated below the knee and races with two carbon fibre blades manufactured by Össur. He holds the Paralympic world record in the 400 meter event. Pistorius missed qualifying for the 2008 Summer Olympics in the 400 meter race, by 0.70 seconds. He qualified for the 2008 Summer Paralympics where he won gold medals in the 100, 200, and 400 meter sprints. 

In 2011, Pistorius qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics and competed in two events: he made the semi-final in the 400 metres race; and his team came 8th in the final of the 4 × 400 metres relay race. Even though all athletes are given equal opportunities to participate in these events, such as the 400 meter race, there has been growing criticism that the games may not be fair to all athletes. For example, athletes running a race with a left prosthetic leg may be disadvantaged compared to those with a right side prosthesis because the races are run in an anticlockwise direction, giving some athletes an advantage.

Some athletes without a disability also compete at the Paralympics. The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete with visual impairment and the guide are considered a team, and both athletes are medal candidates.

====Funding====
Starting at the 1992 Summer Paralympics, recent games have also been supported by contributions from major sponsors. Unlike the Olympics, where the IOC mandates that arenas be clean of sponsor logos, the Paralympics do allow the logos of official sponsors to be displayed inside arenas and on uniforms.

===Media coverage===
While the Olympic Games have experienced tremendous growth in global media coverage since the 1984 Summer Paralympics, the Paralympics had been slower to develop a consistent mainstream media presence. In June 2023, IPC executives noted that interest in the Paralympics had been improving among broadcasters, citing that it had already reached rights deals for the 2024 Summer Paralympics covering 75% of the world over a year in advance (in comparison to 2020, where many deals were made &quot;last minute&quot;), and that it had been pushing for broader coverage and increased rights fees since broadcasters were starting to &quot;[realize] that [the Paralympics are] actually a great sporting event&quot;, and not treat them as a low-effort obligation bundled with their Olympics rights. Unlike the Olympics, the IPC holds the digital rights to the Paralympics in some markets, allowing it to promote live coverage and other highlights via its own social media platforms to engage online audiences.

Television broadcasts of Paralympic Games began in 1976, but this early coverage was confined to tape-delayed broadcasts to one nation or region. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics, there were 45 hours of live coverage but it was available only in Europe. Other countries broadcast highlight packages during the Games. No meaningful improvements in coverage occurred until the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney. 

The 2000 Paralympics represented a significant increase in global media exposure for the Paralympic Games. A deal was reached between the Sydney Paralympic Organizing Committee (SPOC) and All Media Sports (AMS) to broadcast the Games internationally. Deals were reached with Asian, South American, and European broadcast companies to distribute coverage to as many markets as possible. The Games were also webcast for the first time. Because of these efforts, the Sydney Paralympics reached a global audience estimated at 300 million people. Also significant was the fact that the organizers did not have to pay networks to televise the Games as had been done at the 1992 and 1996 Games. 

Despite these advances, consistent media attention has been a challenge, which was evidenced in the coverage in Great Britain of the 2010 Winter Paralympics. The BBC was criticized for its minimal coverage of the 2010 Winter Paralympics as compared to its coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics. The BBC announced it would stream some content on its website and show a one-hour highlight program after the Games ended. For the Winter Olympics the BBC aired 160 hours of coverage. The response from the BBC was that budget constraints and the &quot;time zone factor&quot; necessitated a limited broadcast schedule. The reduction in coverage was done in spite of increased ratings for the 2008 Summer Paralympics, which was watched by 23% of the population of Great Britain. In Norway, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) broadcast 30 hours of the 2010 Winter Games live. NRK-sport were critical of parts of the TV production from Vancouver, and notified the EBU of issues such as the biathlon coverage excluding the shooting, and cross-country skiing with skiers in the distance, making it hard to follow the progress of the competition. NRK were far more pleased with the production of the ice sledge hockey and wheelchair curling events, which they felt reached the same level as the Olympic Games. 

Not all Paralympic events have received television coverage; the IPC and its organisers currently contract with the IOC&#x27;s media unit Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) to produce the broadcast feeds for the Paralympics. At the Summer Paralympics, coverage was limited to 16 sports in 2016, but increased to 19 sports in 2020. In 2024, all 22 Summer Paralympic sports were televised for the first time.

In the UK, Channel 4 assumed the television rights beginning in the 2012 Summer Paralympics, promising major increases in coverage on television and digital platforms, efforts to heighten the Games&#x27; profile, and commitments to incorporate people with disabilities among its staff and presenters. Its coverage of the Paralympics have been promoted through major marketing campaigns; several of its advertisements have won Cannes Lions awards, with its trailer for 2016 &quot;We&#x27;re the Superhumans&quot; receiving an overall Grand Prix award. In January 2020, the Paralympics were classified as a Category A &quot;listed&quot; event by the British telecom regulator Ofcom as with the Olympics, mandating that they be broadcast in whole or in part by a free-to-air network, as with the Olympics. Channel 4 reported that its coverage of the 2024 Summer Paralympics was seen by a total audience of 20 million, with the channel achieving its highest viewer share since the 2012 Paralympics.

===Outside the Games===
A 2010 study by the University of British Columbia (UBC) on the Olympic Games Impact (OGI), showed that of roughly 1,600 Canadian respondents, 41 to 50 percent believed the 2010 Paralympic and Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, triggered additional accessibility of buildings, sidewalks and public spaces. 23 percent of employers said the Games had increased their willingness to hire people with disabilities.

Chief Executive Officer for the International Paralympic Committee Xavier Gonzalez said about the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, China, that:

===Down syndrome participation===

Within the framework of the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s commitment to equal access to athletics, concerns have been raised regarding inclusion of athletes with Down syndrome in the Paralympic Games. While the Paralympic movement strives for inclusivity, the absence of a specific classification for athletes with Down syndrome within Paralympic swimming events raises questions about equal and fair competition for Down syndrome athletes.

International Paralympic Committee Para-swimming classification codes are based upon single impairment only, whereas Down syndrome individuals have both physical and intellectual impairments. Although swimmers with Down syndrome are able to compete in the S14 intellectual impairment category (provided they score low in IQ tests), they are often outmatched by the superior physicality of their opponents. At present there is no designated Paralympic category for swimmers with Down syndrome, meaning they have to compete as intellectually disadvantaged athletes. This disregards their physical disabilities.

A number of advocacy groups globally have been lobbying for the inclusion of a distinct classification category for Down syndrome swimmers within the IPC Classification Codes framework. Initiatives aimed at promoting greater inclusivity within the Paralympic movement have emerged, including advocacy and awareness-raising efforts targeting discrimination and ensuring equal opportunities for athletes with Down syndrome. Despite ongoing advocacy, the issue remains unresolved, and swimmers with Down syndrome continue to face challenges in accessing appropriate classification pathways.

==Classification==
The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has established ten disability categories. Athletes are divided within each category according to their level of impairment, in a functional classification system which differs from sport to sport.

===Categories===
The IPC has established ten disability categories, including physical, visual, and intellectual impairment. Athletes with one of these disabilities can compete in the Paralympics, though not every sport can allow for every disability category. These categories apply to both Summer and Winter Paralympics.

Physical Impairment – There are eight different types of physical impairment:
* Impaired muscle power – With impairments in this category, the force generated by muscles, such as the muscles of one limb, one side of the body or the lower half of the body is reduced, (e.g. spinal cord injury, spina bifida, post-polio syndrome).
* Impaired passive range of movement – The range of movement in one or more joints is reduced in a systematic way. Acute conditions such as arthritis are not included.
* Loss of limb or limb deficiency – A total or partial absence of bones or joints from partial or total loss due to illness, trauma, or congenital limb deficiency (e.g., dysmelia).
* Leg-length difference – Significant bone shortening occurs in one leg due to congenital deficiency or trauma.
* Short stature – Standing height is reduced due to shortened legs, arms and trunk, which are due to a musculoskeletal deficit of bone or cartilage structures. (e.g., achondroplasia, growth hormone deficiency, osteogenesis imperfecta)
* Hypertonia – Hypertonia is marked by an abnormal increase in muscle tension and reduced ability of a muscle to stretch. Hypertonia may result from injury, disease, or conditions which involve damage to the central nervous system (e.g., cerebral palsy).
* Ataxia – Ataxia is an impairment that consists of a lack of coordination of muscle movements (e.g., cerebral palsy, Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia, multiple sclerosis).
* Athetosis – Athetosis is generally characterized by unbalanced, involuntary movements and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture (e.g., cerebral palsy, choreoathetosis).

Visual impairment – Athletes with visual impairment ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged legally blind, to total blindness. This includes impairment of one or more component of the visual system (eye structure, receptors, optic nerve pathway, and visual cortex). The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete with visual impairment and the guide are considered a team. Beginning in 2012, these guides along with sighted goalkeepers in 5-a-side football became eligible to receive medals of their own.

Intellectual Disability – Athletes with a significant intellectual impairment and associated limitations in adaptive behaviour. The IPC primarily serves athletes with physical disabilities, but the disability group Intellectual Disability has been added to some Paralympic Games. This includes only elite athletes with intellectual disabilities diagnosed before the age of 18. However, the IOC-recognized Special Olympics World Games are open to all people with intellectual disabilities.

===Classification system===

Within the disability categories, athletes are further divided into Sport Classes according to the degree of activity limitation resulting from their impairments; this aims to minimise the impact of an athlete&#x27;s impairment on their sporting performance against their rivals. Sport Classes are numbered, with a lower number signifying a greater level of impairment: for example, in Paralympic swimming athletes with visual impairments compete in three Sport Classes from S/SB11 to S/SB13, with S/SB11 athletes having a very low light acuity and/or no light perception, and S/SB13 athletes having the least severe visual impairment eligible for Paralympic sport.

====Medical classification (until the 1980s)====
From its inception until the 1980s, the Paralympic system for classifying athletes consisted of a medical evaluation and diagnosis of impairment. An athlete&#x27;s medical condition was the only factor used to determine what class they competed in. For example, an athlete who had a spinal cord injury that resulted in lower limb paresis, would not compete in the same wheelchair race as an athlete with a double above-knee amputation. The fact that their disability caused the same impairment did not factor into classification determination, the only consideration was their medical diagnosis. It was not until views on disabled athletics shifted from just a form of rehabilitation to an end in itself, that the classification system changed from medical diagnosis to a focus on the functional abilities of the athlete.

====Functional classification (since the 1980s)====

While there is no clear date when the shift occurred, a functional classification system became the norm for disabled athletic classification in the 1980s. In a functional system, the focus is on what effect the athlete&#x27;s impairment has on his or her athletic performance. Under this system, athletes with total loss of function in their legs will compete together in most sports, because their functional loss is the same and the reason for the loss is immaterial. The only exception to the functional system is the classification format used by International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), which still uses a medically based system.

Some sports are only held for certain disability types. For example, goalball is only for visually impaired athletes. The Paralympics recognizes three different grades of visual impairment, consequently all competitors in goalball must wear a visor or &quot;black out mask&quot; so that athletes with less visual impairment will not have an advantage. Other sports, like athletics, are open to athletes with a wide variety of impairments. In athletics, participants are broken down into a range of classes based on the disability they have and then they are placed in a classification within that range based on their level of impairment. For example: classes 11–13 are for visually impaired athletes, which class they are in depends on their level of visual impairment.
There are also team competitions such as wheelchair rugby. Members of the team are each given a point value based on their activity limitation. A lower score indicates a more severe activity limitation than a higher score. A team cannot have more than a certain maximum total of points on the field of play at the same time to ensure equal competition. For example, in wheelchair rugby, the four players&#x27; combined disability number must total no more than eight points.

==Sports==

There are twenty-two sports on the Summer Paralympic program and six sports on the Winter Paralympics program. Within some of the sports are several events. For example, alpine skiing has downhill, super combined, super-G, slalom, giant slalom. The IPC has governance over several of the sports but not all of them. Other international organizations, known as International Sports Federations (IF), notably the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS), the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), and the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA), govern some sports that are specific to certain disability groups. There are national chapters for these International Sport Federations including National Paralympic Committees, which are responsible for recruitment of athletes and governance of sports at the national level.

==Alleged cheating==

After the 2000 Sydney games, a Spanish basketball player alleged that several members of the gold medal-winning Spanish basketball team with intellectual disabilities (ID) did not have disabilities. He claimed that only two athletes out of the twelve-member team met the qualifications of an athlete with an intellectual disability. A controversy ensued and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) called on the Spanish National Paralympic Committee to launch an investigation. The investigation uncovered several Spanish athletes who had flouted the ID rules. In an interview with the president of the federation that oversees ID competition, Fernando Martín Vicente admitted that athletes around the world were breaking the ID eligibility rules. The IPC responded by starting an investigation of its own. The results of the IPC&#x27;s investigation confirmed the Spanish athlete&#x27;s allegations and also determined that the incident was not isolated to the basketball ID event or to Spanish athletes. As a result, all ID competitions were suspended indefinitely. The ban was lifted after the 2008 Games after work had been done to tighten the criteria and controls governing admission of athletes with intellectual disabilities. Four sports, swimming, athletics, table tennis and rowing, were anticipated to hold competitions for ID athletes at the 2012 Summer Paralympics.

The Paralympics have also been tainted by steroid use. At the 2008 Games in Beijing, three powerlifters and a German basketball player were banned after having tested positive for banned substances. This was a decrease in comparison to the ten powerlifters and one track athlete who were banned from the 2000 Games. German skier Thomas Oelsner became the first Winter Paralympian to test positive for steroids. He had won two gold medals at the 2002 Winter Paralympics, but his medals were stripped after his positive drug test. At the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver, Swedish curler Glenn Ikonen tested positive for a banned substance and was suspended for six months by the IPC. He was removed from the rest of the curling competition but his team was allowed to continue. The 54-year-old curler said his doctor had prescribed a medication on the banned substances list.

Another concern now facing Paralympic officials is the technique of &quot;boosting&quot;. Athletes can artificially increase their blood pressure, often by self-harming, which has been shown to improve performance by up to 15%. This is most effective in the endurance sports such as cross-country skiing. To increase blood pressure athletes will deliberately cause trauma to limbs below a spinal injury. This trauma can include breaking bones, strapping extremities in too tightly, and using high-pressure compression stockings. The injury is painless but it does affect the athlete&#x27;s blood pressure.

Another potential concern is the use of gene therapy among Paralympic athletes. All Paralympic athletes are banned from enhancing their abilities through gene doping, but it is extremely difficult to differentiate these concepts. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is currently researching both gene doping and gene therapy, in part to discern the boundary between the two closely related concepts.

The IPC have been working with WADA since 2003, to ensure compliance with WADA&#x27;s anti-doping code among its Paralympic athletes. The IPC has also promised to continue increasing the number of athletes tested at each of its Games, in order to further minimize the possible effect of doping in Paralympic sports. Mandatory in- and out-of competition testing has also been implemented by the IPC to further ensure all of its athletes are performing in compliance with WADA regulations.

Having sent samples for forensic analysis, the IPC found evidence that the prevalent doping by Russian athletes was in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi. On 7 August 2016, the IPC&#x27;s Governing Board voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, citing the Russian Paralympic Committee&#x27;s inability to enforce the IPC&#x27;s Anti-Doping Code and the World Anti-Doping Code which is &quot;a fundamental constitutional requirement&quot;. IPC President Sir Philip Craven stated that the Russian government had &quot;catastrophically failed its Para athletes&quot;. IPC Athletes&#x27; Council Chairperson and CPC Member Todd Nicholson said that Russia had used athletes as &quot;pawns&quot; in order to &quot;show global prowess&quot;.

==Notable champions and achievements==

Trischa Zorn of the United States is the most decorated paralympian in history. She competed in the blind swimming events and won a total of 55 medals, 41 of which are gold. Her Paralympic career spanned 24 years from 1980 to 2004. She was also an alternate on the 1980 American Olympic swim team, but did not go to the Olympics due to a boycott by the United States and several of its allies. Ragnhild Myklebust of Norway holds the record for the most medals ever won at the Winter Paralympic Games. Competing in a variety of events between 1988 and 2002, she won a total of 22 medals, of which 17 were gold. After winning five gold medals at the 2002 Games she retired at the age of 58. Neroli Fairhall, a paraplegic archer from New Zealand, was the first paraplegic competitor, and the third Paralympian, to participate in the Olympic Games, when she competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. She placed thirty-fourth in the Olympic archery competition, and won a Paralympic gold medal in the same event.

<text>The Australian Defence Force (ADF) is the military organisation responsible for the defence of the Commonwealth of Australia and its national interests. It consists of three branches: the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The ADF has a strength of just over 89,000 personnel and is supported by the Department of Defence alongside other civilian entities.

During the first decades of the 20th century, the Australian Government established the armed services as separate organisations, with each service having an independent chain of command. In 1976, the government made a strategic change and established the ADF to place the services under a single headquarters. Over time, the degree of integration has increased, and tri-service headquarters, logistics, and training institutions have supplanted many single-service establishments. The ADF has been deployed around the world in combat, peacekeeping and disaster-relief missions.

The ADF is technologically sophisticated but relatively small for its landmass. Although the ADF&#x27;s 57,346 full-time active-duty personnel and 32,049 active reservists make it the largest military in Oceania, it is smaller than most Asian military forces. However with a national population of just over 27 million, the ADF has an average ratio of military personnel per capita. The ADF is supported by a significant budget by worldwide standards and is well equipped and trained, with defence spending at 2.04% of GDP (as of 2023/24).

==Legal standing==
Section 51(vi) of the Australian Constitution gives the Australian Parliament the power to make laws regarding Australia&#x27;s defence and defence forces and section 114 prevents the states from raising armed forces without the permission of the Commonwealth. Under section 119 the Commonwealth is assigned responsibility for defending Australia from invasion. This section also sets out the conditions under which the government can deploy the defence force domestically.

The Constitution states that the governor-general is the commander in chief of the ADF. In practical terms, this role is largely ceremonial. The governor-general exercises this power based on advice from the prime minister following deliberations of the National Security Committee of Cabinet (NSC) that considers important national security matters. In practice, the governor-general does not play an active part in the ADF&#x27;s command structure and the elected government controls the ADF through the minister for Defence. The minister for Defence exercises control of the ADF under section 8 of the &quot;Defence Act 1903&quot; that states &quot;the Minister has general control and administration of the Defence Force&quot;.

The Constitution does not contain a provision that expressly states who is responsible for committing Australia to war. Contemporary practice, is that a decision to commit the ADF to an &quot;international armed conflict is an exercise of prerogative power pursuant to section 61 of the Constitution&quot; that is made by the NSC without involving the governor-general. The NSC may refer its decision to the full Cabinet for its endorsement. The Commonwealth Government has never been required by the Constitution or legislation to seek parliamentary approval for decisions to deploy military forces overseas or go to war.

==History==
===Formation===

By 1870, each of the then Australian colonies maintained their own military forces. On 1 January 1901, the colonies federated into a new nation and on 1 March 1901, these colonial forces were amalgamated to establish the Australian Army and Commonwealth Naval Force. In 1911, the government established the Royal Australian Navy, which absorbed the Commonwealth Naval Force. The Army established the Australian Flying Corps in 1912 which was separated to form the Royal Australian Air Force in 1921. The services were not linked by a single chain of command, as they each reported to their own separate Minister and had separate administrative arrangements. The three services saw action around the world during World War I and World War II, and took part in conflicts in Asia during the Cold War.

The importance of joint warfare was made clear to the Australian military during World War II when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands. Following the war, several senior officers lobbied for the appointment of a commander-in-chief of the three services. The government rejected this proposal and the three services remained fully independent. The absence of a central authority resulted in poor coordination between the services, with each service organising and operating under different military doctrine.

The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis due to inefficient arrangements during the Vietnam War which at times hindered the military&#x27;s efforts. In 1973, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Arthur Tange, submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service under a single &quot;Department of Defence,&quot; and the creation of the position of Chief of the Defence Force Staff. The government accepted these recommendations, and the Australian Defence Force was established on 9 February 1976.

===Defence of Australia era===

Until the 1970s, Australia&#x27;s military strategy centred on the concept of &quot;forward defence&quot;, in which the role of the Australian military was to co-operate with allied forces to counter threats in Australia&#x27;s region. In 1969, when the United States began the Guam Doctrine and the British withdrew east of Suez, Australia developed a defence policy which emphasised self-reliance and the defence of continental Australia. This was known as the Defence of Australia Policy. Under this policy, the focus of Australian defence planning was to protect Australia&#x27;s northern maritime approaches (the Air-Sea Gap) against enemy attack. In line with this goal, the ADF was restructured to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia. The ADF achieved this by increasing the capabilities of the RAN and RAAF and relocating regular Army units to northern Australia.

At this time, the ADF had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia. In 1987, the ADF made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji in response to the 1987 Fijian coups d&#x27;état. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.

Since the late 1980s, the Government has increasingly called upon the ADF to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to Namibia in early 1989, Cambodia between 1992 and 1993, Somalia in 1993, Rwanda between 1994 and 1995 and Bougainville in 1994 and from 1997 onwards.

The Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF. Although the warships and clearance diving team deployed to the Persian Gulf did not see combat, the deployment tested the ADF&#x27;s capabilities and command structure. Following the war the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions imposed on Iraq.

===East Timor deployment===
In 1996, John Howard led the Liberal Party&#x27;s election campaign and became prime minister. Subsequently, there were significant reforms to the ADF&#x27;s force structure and role. The new government&#x27;s defence strategy placed less emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and Australia&#x27;s allies to manage potential security threats. From 1997 the Government also implemented a series of changes to the ADF&#x27;s force structure to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and improve the ADF&#x27;s combat effectiveness.

The ADF&#x27;s experiences during the deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australia&#x27;s defence policies and, an enhancement of the ADF&#x27;s ability to conduct operations outside Australia. This successful deployment was the first time a large ADF force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in its ability to mount and sustain such operations.

In 2000, the Government released a new Defence White Paper, &quot;Defence 2000 – Our Future Defence Force&quot;, that placed a greater emphasis on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. The Government committed to improve the ADF&#x27;s capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3% per year; in the event, expenditure increased by 2.3% per annum in real terms in the period to 2012–13. In 2003 and 2005, the &quot;Defence Updates&quot; emphasised this focus on expeditionary operations and led to an expansion and modernisation of the ADF.

===Iraq and Afghanistan===
Since 2000, the ADF&#x27;s expanded force structure and deployment capabilities have been put to the test on several occasions. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, Australia committed a special forces task group and an air-to-air refuelling aircraft to operations in Afghanistan, and naval warships to the Persian Gulf as Operation Slipper. In 2003, approximately 2,000 ADF personnel, including a special forces task group, three warships and 14 F/A-18 Hornet aircraft, took part in the invasion of Iraq.

The ADF was subsequently involved in the reconstruction of Iraq. From 2003 until 2005 this was mainly limited to a Security Detachment which protected the Australian embassy, the attachment of officers to multi-national headquarters, small numbers of transport and maritime patrol aircraft, and teams of air traffic controllers and medical personnel. From 2005 until 2008 a battalion-sized Australian Army battle group (initially designated the Al Muthanna Task Group, and later Overwatch Battle Group (West)) was stationed in southern Iraq. In addition, teams of ADF personnel were deployed to train Iraqi military units. In line with a 2007 election commitment, the Rudd government withdrew combat-related forces from Iraq in mid-2008, and most of the remaining Australian units left the country the next year.
The ADF also undertook several operations in Australia&#x27;s immediate region during the 2000s. In 2003, elements of all three services were dispatched to Solomon Islands as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. Regular deployments of Australian forces continued to the islands until 2017. Between December 2004 and March 2005, 1,400 ADF personnel served in Indonesia as part of Operation Sumatra Assist, which formed part of Australia&#x27;s response to the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. In May 2006, approximately 2,000 ADF personnel deployed to East Timor in Operation Astute following unrest between elements of the Timor Leste Defence Force. This deployment concluded in March 2013.

From 2006 until 2013 a battalion-sized Australian Army task force operated in Urozgan Province, Afghanistan; this unit was primarily tasked with providing assistance for reconstruction efforts and training Afghan forces, but was frequently involved in combat. In addition, Special Forces Task Groups were deployed from 2005 to 2006 and 2007 until 2013. Other specialist elements of the ADF, including detachments of CH-47 Chinook helicopters and RAAF radar and air traffic control units, were also periodically deployed to the country. A total of 40 ADF personnel were killed in Afghanistan between 2002 and 2013, and 262 wounded. Following the withdrawal of the combat forces in 2013, ADF training teams have continued to be stationed in the country to train Afghan forces.

The Australian Labor Party (ALP) governments led by prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard between 2007 and 2013 commissioned two defence white papers, which were published in 2009 and 2013. The 2009 document, &quot;Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century: Force 2030&quot;, had a focus on responding to China&#x27;s rapidly growing influence. It included commitments to expand the RAN, including acquiring twelve submarines, and increasing defence spending by three percent per year in real terms. This increase in spending did not occur, however. The &quot;Defence White Paper 2013&quot; had similar strategic themes, but set out a more modest program of defence spending which reflected the government&#x27;s constrained finances. As part of an election commitment, the Liberal–National Coalition Abbott government commissioned a further defence white paper that was published in 2016. This document also included a commitment to expand the ADF&#x27;s size and capabilities. There has generally been bipartisan agreement between the ALP and the Liberal–National Coalition on the ADF&#x27;s role since the mid-1970s. Both political groupings currently support the ADF&#x27;s focus on expeditionary operations, and the broad funding target set out in the &quot;2016 Defence White Paper&quot;. The ADF&#x27;s broad force structure has also experienced little change since the 1980s. For instance, throughout this period the Army&#x27;s main combat formations have been three brigades and the RAAF has been equipped with around 100 combat aircraft. Most of the equipment used by the services has been replaced or upgraded, however.

It is stated in the &quot;2016 Defence White Paper&quot; that Australia&#x27;s changing security environment will lead to new demands being placed on the Australian Defence Force. Although it is not expected that Australia will face any threat of direct attack from another country, terrorist groups and tensions between nations in East Asia pose threats to Australian security. More broadly, the Australian Government believes that it needs to make a contribution to maintaining the rules-based order globally. There is also a risk that climate change, weak economic growth and social factors could cause instability in South Pacific countries.

The ADF has developed strategies to respond to Australia&#x27;s changing strategic environment. The &quot;2016 Defence White Paper&quot; states that &quot;the Government will ensure Australia maintains a regionally superior ADF
with the highest levels of military capability and scientific and technological sophistication&quot;. To this end, the government intends to improve the ADF&#x27;s combat power and expand the number of military personnel. This will include introducing new technologies and capabilities. The ADF is also seeking to improve its intelligence capabilities and co-operation between the services.

Beginning in August 2014, RAAF combat forces, an Army special forces task force and an Army training unit were deployed to the Middle East during Operation Okra as part of the international war against the Islamic State. The RAAF aircraft conducted air strikes in Iraq and Syria and provided airborne command and control and air-to-air refuelling for the coalition forces. The special forces advised the Iraqi Army and the training unit trained Iraqi soldiers. The RAAF combat aircraft completed operations in January 2018, and the other aircraft were withdrawn in September 2020. The Army training force departed in mid-2020.

===2020–present===

The Australian Government believes that the country&#x27;s strategic circumstances are worsening due to the threat posed by China. This has led to decisions to expand the ADF and enhance its ability to participate in high intensity combat. The &quot;2020 Defence Strategic Update&quot; called for the ADF&#x27;s efforts to be focused on the Indo-Pacific region. It also concluded that there was no longer a ten-year period of strategic warning before Australia could be involved in a major war. The document stated that the ADF&#x27;s funding would be expanded, and its capacity to strike at targets from a long distance be improved. In September 2021, Australia entered into the AUKUS trilateral security partnership with the United Kingdom and United States. As part of this partnership, Australia will obtain nuclear attack submarines to significantly improve the RAN&#x27;s capabilities - this replaced a plan to acquire 12 conventionally powered &quot;Attack&quot;-class submarines in partnership with France. The three AUKUS countries also agreed to collaborate on a range of military technologies.

An investigation of allegations of Australian war crimes in Afghanistan was completed in November 2020. The Brereton Report found that there was evidence that 25 Australian special forces personnel committed war crimes on 25 occasions, resulting in the deaths of 39 people and the mistreatment of two others. General Angus Campbell accepted all of the 143 recommendations made in the report. The government announced the implementation of 139 of the recommendations in 2024, with the remaining relating to ongoing criminal investigations by the newly created Office of the Special Investigator. The office charged a first soldier with war crimes in March 2023.

During August 2021, RAAF aircraft participated in an international airlift to evacuate people from Kabul in Afghanistan after it fell to the Taliban. An Army infantry company was deployed to Kabul as part of this operation. More than 3,500 people were evacuated by the RAAF. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 Australia provided military assistance to Ukraine. , this included the transfer of military equipment from the ADF worth $A475 million and the deployment of an Army training team to the United Kingdom to train Ukrainian soldiers.

The election of the ALP Albanese government in May 2022 did not significantly change Australia&#x27;s defence posture, as the ALP and Coalition parties have broadly similar defence policies. This includes an agreement on China posing a threat to Australia&#x27;s security. The main difference is that the ALP sees climate change as an important security issue. After coming to power, the Albanese government commissioned the Defence Strategic Review that was publicly released in April 2023. The review found that the security challenges facing Australia had continued to worsen, and called for the ADF to be restructured to meet the threats. This includes transitioning the ADF from its traditional structure of a &quot;balanced force&quot; capable of a range of activities to a &quot;focused force&quot; tailored mainly to protecting Australia from military attack or coercion. As part of this change, the review recommended reducing the planned size of the Army&#x27;s mechanised forces and expanding its long-range firepower. The review also identified climate change as a threat to Australia and called for a &quot;whole of nation effort&quot; to defending Australia that goes beyond the ADF. The government accepted most of the review&#x27;s recommendations.

==Structure==
The Australian Defence Force and Department of Defence make up the Australian Defence Organisation (ADO), which is often referred to as &quot;Defence&quot;. A diarchy of the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) and the Secretary of the Department of Defence administers the ADO. The Department of Defence is staffed by both civilian and military personnel, and includes agencies such as the Defence Intelligence Organisation (DIO) and Defence Science and Technology Group (DST Group).

===Command arrangements===

The ADF&#x27;s command arrangements are specified in the &quot;Defence Act 1903&quot; and subordinate legislation. This act states that the Minister for Defence &quot;has general control and administration of the Defence Force&quot; and that the CDF and the Secretary of the Department of Defence must &quot;comply with any directions of the Minister&quot;. The leaders of the ADO are also responsible to the junior ministers who are appointed to manage specific elements of the defence portfolio. Under the Albanese Ministry two cabinet-level ministers have been responsible for the Defence portfolio since May 2022: the position of Minister for Defence held by the Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles, and Matt Keogh is the Minister for Defence Personnel and the Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs. In addition, there are two junior ministers: Matt Thistlethwaite is the Assistant Minister for Defence and Assistant Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs and Pat Conroy is the Minister for Defence Industry.

The CDF is the most senior appointment in the ADF and commands the force. The CDF is the only four-star officer in the ADF and is a general, admiral or air chief marshal. As well as having command responsibilities, the CDF is the Minister for Defence&#x27;s principal military adviser. Admiral David Johnston is the current CDF, and assumed this position on 10 July 2024. Hugh White, a prominent academic and former Deputy Secretary in the Department of Defence, has criticised the ADF&#x27;s current command structure. White argues that the Minister plays too large a role in military decision-making and does not provide the CDF and Secretary of Defence with necessary and sufficient authority to manage the ADO effectively.

Under the current ADF command structure the day-to-day management of the ADF is distinct from the command of military operations. The services are administered through the ADO, with the head of each service (the Chief of Navy, Chief of Army and Chief of Air Force) and the service headquarters being responsible for raising, training and sustaining combat forces. Each chief is also the CDF&#x27;s principal adviser on matters concerning the responsibilities of their service. The CDF chairs the Chiefs of Service Committee which comprises the service chiefs, Vice Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Joint Operations (CJOPS). The CDF and service chiefs are supported by an integrated ADF Headquarters, which replaced separate service headquarters on 1 July 2017.

While the individual members of each service ultimately report to their service&#x27;s Chief, the Chiefs do not control military operations. Control of ADF operations is exercised through a formal command chain headed by the CJOPS, who reports directly to the CDF. The CJOPS commands the Headquarters Joint Operations Command (HQJOC) as well as temporary joint task forces. These joint task forces comprise units assigned from their service to participate in operations or training exercises.

===Joint forces===

Operational command of the ADF is exercised by HQJOC, which is located at a purpose-built facility near Bungendore, New South Wales. This is a joint headquarters comprising personnel from the three services and includes a continuously manned Joint Control Centre. HQJOC&#x27;s main role is to &quot;plan, monitor and control&quot; ADF operations and exercises, and it is organised around groups of plans, operations and support staff. HQJOC also monitors the readiness of the ADF units which are not assigned to operations and contributes to developing Australia&#x27;s military doctrine.

As well as HQJOC, the ADF has permanent joint operational commands responsible to the CJOPS. Joint Operations Command (JOC) includes the two headquarters responsible for patrolling Australia&#x27;s maritime borders on a day-to-day basis, Northern Command and Maritime Border Command. Other JOC units include the Joint Movements Group and the Air and Space Operations Centre. Individual ADF units and Joint Task Groups are assigned to JOC during operations, and HQJOC includes officers responsible for submarine and special operations forces.

The ADF includes a number of joint operational and training units. These include the Joint Military Police Unit and the Joint Helicopter Aircrew Training School.

In 2023, after the release of the Defence Strategic Review (DSR) and a recommendation to consolidate the ADF&#x27;s guided weapons and explosive ordnance (GWEO) across the services, leading to the creation of the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Group (GWEOG), and the appointment of Air Marshal Leon Phillips, OAM as its head. This moved the responsibility of acquisition and sustainment of the ADF&#x27;s explosive materiel from CASG to the newly formed GWEOG.

===Royal Australian Navy===

The Royal Australian Navy is the naval branch of the Australian Defence Force. The RAN operates just under 50 commissioned warships, including destroyers, frigates, submarines, patrol boats and auxiliary ships, as well as a number of non-commissioned vessels. In addition, the RAN maintains a force of combat, logistics and training helicopters.

There are two parts to the RAN&#x27;s structure. One is an operational command, Fleet Command, and the other is a support command, Navy Strategic Command. The Navy&#x27;s assets are administered by five &quot;forces&quot; which report to the Commander Australian Fleet. These are the Fleet Air Arm, the Mine Warfare, Clearance Diving, Hydrographic, Meteorological and Patrol Force, Shore Force, Submarine Force and Surface Force.

===Australian Army===

The Army is organised into three main elements which report to the Chief of Army; the Headquarters of the 1st Division, Special Operations Command and Forces Command. As of 2017, approximately 85% of Army personnel were in units assigned to Forces Command, which is responsible for preparing units and individuals for operations. Headquarters 1st Division is responsible for high-level training activities and is capable of being deployed to command large scale ground operations. Only a small number of units are permanently assigned to the 1st Division; these include the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment which forms the pre-landing force for the Australian Amphibious Force, a signals regiment and three training and personnel support units.

The Australian Army&#x27;s main combat forces are grouped in brigades. Its main conventional forces are three regular combat brigades which are organised on a common structure; the 1st, 3rd and 7th Brigades. Support for the units in these formations is provided by an aviation brigade (16th Aviation Brigade), a combat support and ISTAR brigade (6th Brigade) and a logistics brigade (the 17th Sustainment Brigade). Under a restructure of the Army&#x27;s health capability, a new health brigade, designated the 2nd Health Brigade, will be raised in 2023. In addition, there are six Army Reserve brigades; these brigades are administered by the 2nd Division and &quot;paired&quot; with the three regular combat brigades. The Army&#x27;s main tactical formations are combined arms battlegroups made up of elements drawn from different units.

The Special Operations Command commands the Army&#x27;s special forces units. It comprises the Special Air Service Regiment, the 2nd Commando Regiment, the reserve 1st Commando Regiment and the Special Operations Engineer Regiment as well as logistics and training units. The Army&#x27;s special forces units have been expanded since 2001 and are well equipped and capable of being deployed by sea, air or land. As of 2014, Special Operations Command comprised approximately 2,200 personnel.

===Royal Australian Air Force===

The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) is the air power branch of the ADF. The RAAF has modern combat and transport aircraft and a network of bases in strategic locations across Australia.

The RAAF has a single operational command, Air Command. Air Command is the operational arm of the RAAF and consists of Air Combat Group, Air Mobility Group, Surveillance and Response Group, Combat Support Group, Air Warfare Centre and Air Force Training Group. Each group consists of several wings.

The RAAF has nineteen flying squadrons; five combat squadrons, two maritime patrol squadrons, six transport squadrons, six training squadrons (including three Operational Conversion Units and a forward air control training squadron) as well as one Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control squadron and a Joint Terminal Attack Controller squadron. The ground units supporting these flying squadrons include three expeditionary combat support squadrons, three security force squadrons and a range of intelligence, air traffic control, communications, radar and medical units.

==Logistic support ==
The ADF&#x27;s logistics are managed by the Department of Defence&#x27;s Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group (CASG). The CASG was established in 2015 from the previously semi-independent Defence Materiel Organisation. CASG is responsible for the acquisition of all materiel (except guided weapons and explosive ordnance) and services used by the ADF and maintaining this equipment throughout its life of type.

CASG is not directly responsible for supplying deployed ADF units; this is the responsibility of the Joint Logistics Command (JLC) and the single service logistic units, instead CASG has responsibility for the supply and transport of materiel from manufacturers to supply depots. These units include the Navy&#x27;s Strategic Command and replenishment ships, the Army&#x27;s 17th Sustainment Brigade and Combat Service Support Battalions, and the Combat Support Group RAAF.

The ADF maintains stockpiles of ammunition, fuel and other supplies. Since the late 1990s, ammunition for the three services has been stored in a network of facilities managed by the JLC. The creation of a GWEO Group moved the responsibility of acquisition and sustainment of Explosive Materiel within the ADF from JLC and CASG to itself. The ADF also holds several months&#x27; worth of fuel for the Navy&#x27;s vessels and several weeks&#x27; worth for aircraft and vehicles. A number of defence analysts have raised concerns over the adequacy of the fuel stockpile, especially as Australia is largely dependent on imports which could be disrupted in the event of war.

The increasing role of the private sector forms an important trend in the ADF&#x27;s logistics arrangements. During the 1990s many of the ADF&#x27;s support functions were transferred to the private sector to improve the efficiency with which they were provided. Since these reforms most of the &quot;garrison&quot; support services at military bases have been provided by private firms. The reforms also led to many of the ADF&#x27;s logistics units being disbanded or reduced in size. Since this time private firms have increasingly been contracted to provide critical support to ADF units deployed outside Australia. This support has included transporting equipment and personnel and constructing and supplying bases.

==Military intelligence and surveillance==
The Australian Defence Force&#x27;s intelligence collection and analysis capabilities include each of the services&#x27; intelligence systems and units, two joint civilian-military intelligence gathering agencies and two strategic and operational-level intelligence analysis organisations.
Each of the three services has its own intelligence collection assets. RAN doctrine stresses the importance of collecting a wide range of information and combining it to inform decisions. It also notes that the &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarines are particularly effective sources of &quot;acoustic, electromagnetic and environmental information&quot;. The Army&#x27;s intelligence and surveillance units include the 1st Intelligence Battalion, 7th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare), 20th Surveillance and Target Acquisition Regiment, three Regional Force Surveillance Units and the Special Air Service Regiment. The RAAF monitors the airspace of Australia and neighbouring countries using the Vigilare system, which combines input from the service&#x27;s Jindalee Operational Radar Network, other ADF air defence radars (including airborne and naval systems) and civilian air traffic control radars. The RAAF&#x27;s other intelligence assets include No. 87 Squadron and the AP-3C Orion aircraft operated by No. 92 Wing. A C band radar and a telescope located at Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt provide a space situational awareness capability, which includes tracking space assets and debris. Australia also provides personnel to the US Joint Space Operations Center in Colorado Springs which tracks and identifies any man-made object in orbit.

The Defence Strategic Policy and Intelligence Group within the Department of Defence supports the services and co-operates with the civilian agencies within the Australian Intelligence Community. This Group consists of the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation (AGO), Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) and Defence Intelligence Organisation (DIO). The AGO is responsible for geospatial intelligence and producing maps for the ADF, the ASD, originally the Defence Signals Directorate, is Australia&#x27;s signals intelligence agency, and the DIO is responsible for the analysis of intelligence collected by the other intelligence agencies. The three agencies are headquartered in Canberra, though the AGO has staff in Bendigo and the ASD maintains permanent signals collection facilities in other locations.

The ASD also includes the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) which is responsible for protecting Defence and other Australian Government agencies against cyberwarfare attacks. The ACSC was established in January 2010 and is jointly staffed by the ASD and personnel from the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department, Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, and Australian Federal Police. Unlike the United States military, the ADF does not class cyberwarfare as being a separate sphere of warfare. In July 2017 an Information Warfare Division was raised, tasked with both defensive and offensive cyber operations.

The Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) has been involved in ADF operations since the Vietnam War including East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2012, the Director-General of ASIS stated that the service&#x27;s agents had saved the lives of Australian soldiers, enabled special forces operations and that &quot;it&#x27;s difficult to see a situation in the future where the ADF would deploy without ASIS alongside&quot;. It has been reported that one of the Special Air Service Regiment&#x27;s squadrons works with ASIS and has undertaken independent covert intelligence-collection operations outside Australia.

==Personnel==

The Australian military has been an all-volunteer force since the abolition of conscription in 1972. Both men and women can enlist in the ADF, with women being able to apply for all roles. Only Australian citizens and permanent residents who are eligible for Australian citizenship can enlist. Recruits must be aged at least 17, and meet health, educational and aptitude standards. The ADF is one of the few areas of the Australian Government to continue to have compulsory retirement ages: permanent personnel must retire at 60 years of age and reservists at 65. Both permanent and reserve personnel can work through flexible arrangements, including part-time hours or remotely from their duty station, subject to approval. Discipline of defence personnel is guided by the &quot;Defence Force Discipline Act&quot; &quot;1982&quot;, ultimately overseen by the Judge Advocate General of the ADF.

Australian demographic trends will put pressure on the ADF in the future. Excluding other factors, the ageing of the Australian population will result in smaller numbers of potential recruits entering the Australian labour market each year. Some predictions are that population ageing will result in slower economic growth and increased government expenditure on pensions and health programs. As a result of these trends, the ageing of Australia&#x27;s population may worsen the ADF&#x27;s manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget. Few young Australians consider joining the military and the ADF has to compete for recruits against private sector firms which are able to offer higher salaries.

===Personnel numbers===
As of the June 2023, the ADF comprised 57,346 permanent (full-time) and 32,049 active reserve (part-time) personnel. Compared to 56,172 permanent and 25,680 active reserve personnel ten years prior in June 2013. The Army is the largest service, followed by the RAAF and RAN. The ADO also employed 18,126 civilian Australian Public Service (APS) staff as at 30 June 2023. During the 2022–23 financial year 5,537 people enlisted in the ADF on a permanent basis and 6,397 left, representing a net loss of 860 personnel. 

The distribution of ADF personnel between the services and categories of service on 30 June 2023 was as follows:

The number of ADF personnel has changed over the last 20 years. During the 1990s the strength of the ADF was reduced from around 70,000 to 50,000 permanent personnel as a result of budget cuts and the outsourcing of some military functions. The ADF began to grow from 2000 after the defence white paper released that year called for an expansion to the military&#x27;s strength, though the size of the military decreased between the 2003–04 to 2005–06 financial years due to problems with attracting further recruits. By 2009–10 the ADF was above its budgeted size, leading to reductions until 2014–15. The size of the ADF grew between the 2014–15 and 2016–17 financial years. The ADF has not met its recruitment targets over the period since the 1995–96 financial year.

In March 2022 Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that by 2040 the strength of the ADF would grow by around 30% to be almost 80,000 permanent personnel. The expansion is estimated to cost at least A$38 billion which includes increasing the number of APS personnel.

In June 2024, the government announced a new policy to grow the ADF as outlined in the &quot;National Defence Strategy&quot; released in April 2024. Under the policy, permanent residents who have lived in Australia for 12 months from countries in the Five Eyes alliance will become eligible to join the ADF. From July 2024, New Zealand permanent residents will be eligible to join the ADF. From January 2025, permanent residents from the United Kingdom, United States and Canada will be eligible to join the ADF. Once the person has served 90 days in the ADF they will become eligible for Australian citizenship and would be expected to apply.

The ADF is small compared to many other national militaries. Both the number of personnel in the ADF and the share of the Australian population this represents is smaller than that in many countries in Australia&#x27;s immediate region. Several NATO member countries, including France and the United States, also have a higher share of their population in the military. This is a continuation of long-term trends, as outside of major wars Australia has always had a relatively small military. The size of the force is a result of Australia&#x27;s relatively small population and the military being structured around a maritime strategy focused on the RAN and RAAF rather than a manpower-intensive army.

===Reserves===

Each of the branches of the ADF has a reserve component. These forces are the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Australian Army Reserve and Royal Australian Air Force Reserve. The main role of the reserves is to supplement the permanent elements of the ADF during deployments and crises, including natural disasters. This can include attaching individual reservists to regular units or deploying units composed entirely of reserve personnel. As reservists serve on a part-time basis, they are less costly to the government than permanent members of the ADF, but the nature of their service can mean that reservists have a lower level of readiness than regular personnel and require further training before they can be deployed. It has historically proven difficult to set a level of training requirements which allows reservists to be rapidly deployable yet does not act as a disincentive to recruitment and continued participation. Successive governments since the 1960s have also been reluctant to use the &quot;call out&quot; powers to require reservists to undertake active service.
There are two main categories of reserve personnel; those in the active reserve and those in the standby reserve. Members of the active reserve have an annual minimum training obligation. Reservists can volunteer to undertake more than the minimum periods of training and active service. Members of the standby reserve are not required to undertake training, and would only be called up in response to a national emergency or to fill a specialised position. Most standby reservists are former full-time members of the ADF.

While Australian Naval Reserve personnel are assigned to permanent units, most members of the Army Reserve and Air Force Reserve are members of reserve units. Most of the RAAF&#x27;s reserve units are not intended to be deployed, and reserve personnel are generally attached to regular air force units during their periods of active service. The Army Reserve is organised into permanent combat and support units, though most are currently manned at levels well below their authorised strengths and are not capable of deploying as formed units.

The ADF&#x27;s increased activities since 1999 and shortfalls in recruiting permanent personnel has led to reservists being more frequently called to active service. This has included large scale domestic deployments, which have included providing security for major events such as the 2000 Summer Olympics and responding to natural disasters. Large numbers of reserve personnel have also been deployed as part of ADF operations in Australia&#x27;s region; this has included the deployment of Army Reserve rifle companies to East Timor and the Solomon Islands. Smaller numbers of reservists have taken part in operations in locations distant from Australia. Notably, companies of the Army Reserve 1st Commando Regiment were regularly deployed to Afghanistan as part of the Special Operations Task Group.

===Training===

Individual training of Australian servicemen and women is generally provided by the services in their own training institutions. Each service has its own training organisation to manage this individual training. Where possible, however, individual training is increasingly being provided through tri-service schools.

Military academies include for the Navy, Royal Military College, Duntroon, for the Army, and the Officers&#x27; Training School for the Air Force. The Australian Defence Force Academy is a tri-service university for officer cadets of all services who wish to attain a university degree through the ADF. Navy recruit training is conducted at , Army recruits are trained at the Army Recruit Training Centre and Air Force recruits at RAAF Base Wagga.

===Women in the ADF===

Women first served in the Australian military during World War II when each service established a separate female branch. The RAAF was the first service to fully integrate women into operational units, doing so in 1977, with the Army and RAN following in 1979 and 1985 respectively. The ADF initially struggled to integrate women, with integration being driven by changing Australian social values and Government legislation rather than a change in attitudes within the male-dominated military.
The number of positions available to women in the ADF has increased over time. Although servicewomen were initially barred from combat positions, these restrictions began to be lifted in 1990. In September 2011 Minister for Defence Stephen Smith announced that the Cabinet had decided to remove all restrictions on women serving in combat positions, and that this change would come into effect within five years. This decision was supported by the CDF and the chiefs of the services. Serving women became able to apply for all positions on 1 January 2013 except special forces roles in the Army which became open to women in January 2014. In January 2016, civilian women became able to be directly recruited to all positions.

Despite the expansion in the number of positions available to women and other changes which aim to encourage increased female recruitment and retention, the growth in the proportion of female permanent defence personnel has been slow. In the 1989–1990 financial year women made up 11.4% of the ADF personnel. In the 2008–2009 financial year women occupied 13.5% of ADF positions. During the same period the proportion of civilian positions filled by women in the Australian Defence Organisation increased from 30.8% to 42.8%. In 2017–2018, women made up 17.9% of the ADF&#x27;s permanent force. The proportion of women in the permanent force differs by service: 14.3% of members of the Army are female, compared to 21.5% of the RAN and 22.1% for the RAAF. In 2015 the ADF adopted targets to increase the proportion of service personnel who are female by 2023: by this time it is planned that women will make up 25% of the RAN, 15% of the Army and 25% of the RAAF.

There continue to be concerns over the incidence of sexual abuse and gender-based discrimination in the ADF. In 2014 the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce estimated that around 1,100 currently-serving ADF personnel had abused other members of the military, and recommended that a royal commission be conducted to investigate long-running allegations of sexual abuse and assault of servicewomen at the Australian Defence Force Academy. In 2013 Chief of Army General David Morrison publicly released a video in which he warned against gender-based discrimination, and stated that he would dismiss members of the Army who engaged in such conduct.

===Ethnic and religious composition===

A high percentage of ADF personnel are drawn from the Anglo-Celtic portion of Australia&#x27;s population. In 2011 the proportion of ADF personnel born in Australia and the other predominately Anglo-Celtic countries was higher than this population group&#x27;s share of both the Australian workforce and overall population. As a result, analyst Mark Thomson has argued that the ADF is unrepresentative of Australia&#x27;s society in this regard and that recruiting more personnel from other ethnic backgrounds would improve the ADF&#x27;s language skills and cultural empathy. In 2013, the ADF launched the &quot;Defence Diversity and Inclusion Strategy 2012-2017&quot; to recruit more volunteers from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and to improve statistics collection.

On 30 June 2020, 3.2% of ADF permanent personnel and 2.6% of Reserves were Indigenous Australians. The &quot;Defence Reconciliation Action Plan 2019-2022&quot; aims to increase the number of Indigenous Australians the ADF recruits and to improve their retention rate, and has set a target of 5% Indigenous representation by 2025. Restrictions on Indigenous Australians&#x27; ability to enlist in the military existed until the 1970s, though hundreds of Indigenous men and women had joined the military when restrictions were reduced during the world wars. By 1992 the representation of Indigenous Australians in the ADF was equivalent to their proportion of the Australian population, though they continue to be under-represented among the officer corps. Two of the Army&#x27;s three Regional Force Surveillance Units (NORFORCE and the 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment) are manned mostly by Indigenous Australian reservists. In 2015 Indigenous Australians made up around 2% of ADF personnel, which was smaller than the Indigenous share of the total Australian population.

In line with trends across the broader Australian population, the proportion of ADF personnel who are not religious has increased considerably over recent years. The proportion of ADF personnel who reported that their religion was Christianity in service censuses and human relations databases decreased from around 66% in 2003 to just over 52% in 2015. Over this period, the proportion who stated that they do not have a religious affiliation increased from 31% to 47%. Only 1% of ADF members reported having a non-Christian religious affiliation in 2015. In 2023 it was reported that 80% of new ADF recruits did not have religious beliefs.

===Sexuality and gender identity===
Australia allows gay men and lesbians to serve openly. Openly gay and lesbian personnel were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this change at the time, and it caused considerable public debate. Opponents of lifting the ban on gay and lesbian personnel argued that doing so would greatly harm the ADF&#x27;s cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on gay service did not have any negative effects on the ADF&#x27;s morale, effectiveness or recruitment and retention, and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments. Few members of the ADF came out as lesbian, gay or bisexual until the late 1990s, however, and those who did were not always welcomed by their comrades.

ADF personnel in same-sex relationships experienced discriminatory treatment until the 2000s. This included Defence not recognising same-sex spouses, which prevented these couples from receiving the financial entitlements available to opposite-sex couples and could be a barrier to the spouse being treated as their partner&#x27;s next of kin. The ADF officially recognised same-sex relationships in 2005, and since 1 January 2009 these couples have had the same access to military retirement pensions and superannuation as opposite-sex couples. Transgender personnel have been permitted to serve in the ADF since 2010, and are provided with support when necessary. Despite the removal of restrictions on gay and lesbian personnel, harassment and discrimination continued to occur; for instance a 2013 survey found that 10% of gay soldiers had experienced discrimination and more than 30% hid their sexuality. The ADF has actively encouraged the inclusion of LGBTI personnel since the mid-2010s, with its leadership highlighting the importance of the issue and the military justice system being strongly used to prevent harassment and discrimination. Defence Force Recruiting also encourages LGBTI people to enlist. As of 2023, 4.8 percent of ADF personnel identified as members of the LGBTI+ community.

==Defence expenditure and procurement==
===Current expenditure===

The Australian Government allocated to the Australian Defence Organisation in the 2017–18 financial year. This level of expenditure is equivalent to approximately 1.9% of Australian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 7.28% of total Australian Government expenditure. This was an increase in nominal terms from the allocated in the 2016–17 financial year which represented approximately 1.83% of GDP. In broad terms the Defence budget is divided into expenditure on personnel, operating costs and capital investment; in 2016–17 37% of expenditure was on personnel, 36% on operational costs and 27% on capital investments. It is expected that by 2030 defence spending will account for 2.4% of GDP.

Australia&#x27;s defence expenditure is much larger in dollar terms to that of most countries in Australia&#x27;s immediate region. The share of GDP Australia spends on defence is also larger than that in most developed economies and major South-East Asian countries. China allocates approximately the same proportion of GDP to Defence as Australia does, and has been rapidly increasing its nominal expenditure. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has estimated that Australia&#x27;s defence spending in 2017 was the 13th highest of any country in real terms. As a proportion of GDP Australia&#x27;s defence spending ranks as 49th of the countries for which data is available.

===Long term procurement projects===

The 2016–17 budget forecasts that defence expenditure will increase to $42 billion in 2020–21, which is estimated to represent 2.03% of GDP. This reflects a bipartisan commitment to increase defence expenditure to 2% of GDP. The &quot;2016 Defence White Paper&quot; included a commitment to further increases in spending beyond this time, with nominal expenditure being projected to be around $58.8 billion in 2020–25; the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has estimated that this would represent about 2.16% of GDP.

The &quot;Integrated Investment Program&quot; that was released alongside the &quot;2016 Defence White Paper&quot; sets out the ADF&#x27;s long term capital programs. This document is the successor to the &quot;Defence Capability Plans&quot; which were regularly produced from 2000. The total value of the projects in the Integrated Investment Program over the period to 2025–26 is $162 billion.

==Equipment==
The ADF seeks to be a high-technology force. Although most of the ADF&#x27;s weapons are only used by single service, there is an increasing emphasis on commonality. The three services use the same small arms and the FN Herstal 35 is the ADF&#x27;s standard hand gun, the F88 Austeyr the standard rifle, the F89 Minimi the standard light support weapon, the FN Herstal MAG-58 the standard light machine gun and the Browning M2HB the standard heavy machine gun.

The ADF is equipped with conventional weapons only. Australia does not possess weapons of mass destruction and has ratified the Biological Weapons Convention, Chemical Weapons Convention and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Australian Government is committed to encouraging nuclear disarmament internationally. Australia is also a party to international agreements which prohibit land mines and cluster munitions.

, the Royal Australian Navy operated a large number of ships and submarines. The Navy&#x27;s main surface combatants were eight &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigates and three &quot;Hobart&quot;-class destroyers. The RAN&#x27;s submarine force had six &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarines. There were ten &quot;Armidale&quot;-class and five Cape-class patrol boats for border security and fisheries patrol duties in Australia&#x27;s northern waters. The RAN&#x27;s amphibious force comprises the two &quot;Canberra&quot;-class landing helicopter docks and the dock landing ship . The Navy&#x27;s minesweeping force is equipped with four &quot;Huon&quot;-class minehunters. Two &quot;Supply&quot;-class replenishment oilers support these combatants. The RAN also operated four survey vessels (the &quot;Leeuwin&quot; and &quot;Paluma&quot; classes). Non-commissioned ships operated by the RAN include the sail training ship &quot;Young Endeavour&quot;. There were also four auxiliary ships operated by private companies on behalf of the RAN. The Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s helicopter force comprised 24 MH-60R Seahawk anti-submarine and 6 MRH 90 transport helicopters and a training force equipped with 15 EC 135T2+ helicopters. The Navy also operated S-100 Camcopter and ScanEagle uncrewed aerial vehicles.

The Australian Army is equipped with a wide range of equipment in order to be able to employ combined arms approaches in combat. , the Army&#x27;s armoured fighting vehicle holdings included 59 M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks, 416 M113 armoured personnel carriers, 221 ASLAV armoured reconnaissance vehicles and 25 Boxer combat reconnaissance vehicles. Approximately 950 Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles were in service and 1,000 Hawkei protected mobility vehicles were in service and on order. The Army&#x27;s artillery holdings consisted of 48 155 mm towed M777 howitzers, 216 81 mm mortars, RBS-70 surface-to-air missiles and FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missiles. Australian Army Aviation operated several different models of helicopters. These included 22 Eurocopter Tiger armed reconnaissance helicopters, 14 CH-47F Chinook and 41 MRH 90 transport helicopters. The Army also operated 15 RQ-7B Shadow 2000 uncrewed aerial vehicles. The Army&#x27;s fleet of watercraft at this time included 15 LCM-8 landing craft.

The Royal Australian Air Force operates combat, maritime patrol, transport and training aircraft. As 2023 the combat aircraft force comprised 56 F-35A Lightning IIs with another 16 on order, 24 F/A-18F Super Hornets and 11 EA-18G Growlers with another on order. The intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance force was equipped with 12 P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft with 2 more on order, 6 E-7A Wedgetail AEW&amp;C aircraft and 2 AP-3C Orions. The air transport force operated 12 C-130J-30 Super Hercules, 8 C-17 Globemaster IIIs and 10 C-27J Spartans. A further 12 Super King Air 350s were used in both the transport and training roles. The RAAF also operated 3 Challenger and 2 Boeing 737 aircraft as VIP transports. The RAAF had seven KC-30 Multi-Role Tanker Transports. The RAAF&#x27;s training units were equipped with 49 PC-21s and 33 Hawk 127s. In October 2022 the RAAF received its first MQ-4C with a further 6 on order, and plans to acquire 6 MQ-28 Ghost Bat UCAV

==Bases==
The Australian Defence Force maintains 60 major bases and many other facilities across all the states and territories of Australia. These bases occupy millions of hectares of land, giving the ADO Australia&#x27;s largest real estate portfolio. Defence Housing Australia manages around 19,000 residences occupied by members of the ADF. While most of the Army&#x27;s permanent force units are based in northern Australia, the majority of Navy and Air Force units are based near Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. Few ADF bases are currently shared by different services. Small Army and RAAF units are also located at Royal Malaysian Air Force Base Butterworth. The administrative headquarters of the ADF and the three services is located in Canberra alongside the main offices of the Department of Defence.

The Royal Australian Navy has two main bases; Fleet Base East (HMAS &quot;Kuttabul&quot;) in Sydney and Fleet Base West (HMAS &quot;Stirling&quot;) near Perth. The Navy&#x27;s operational headquarters, Fleet Headquarters, is located adjacent to Fleet Base East. The majority of the Navy&#x27;s patrol boats are based at in Darwin, Northern Territory, with the remaining patrol boats and the hydrographic fleet located at in Cairns. The Fleet Air Arm is based at near Nowra, New South Wales.

The Australian Army&#x27;s regular units are concentrated in a few bases, most of which are located in Australia&#x27;s northern states. The Army&#x27;s operational headquarters, Forces Command, is located at Victoria Barracks in Sydney. Most elements of the Army&#x27;s three regular brigades are based at Robertson Barracks near Darwin, Lavarack Barracks in Townsville, Queensland, and Gallipoli Barracks in Brisbane. The 1st Division&#x27;s Headquarters is also located at Gallipoli Barracks. Other important Army bases include the Army Aviation Centre near Oakey, Queensland, Holsworthy Barracks near Sydney, Woodside Barracks near Adelaide, South Australia, and Campbell Barracks in Perth. Dozens of Army Reserve depots are located across Australia.

The Royal Australian Air Force maintains several air bases, including three which are only occasionally activated. The RAAF&#x27;s operational headquarters, Air Command, is located at RAAF Base Glenbrook near Sydney. The Air Force&#x27;s combat aircraft are based at RAAF Base Amberley near Ipswich, Queensland, RAAF Base Tindal near Katherine, Northern Territory, and RAAF Base Williamtown near Newcastle, New South Wales. The RAAF&#x27;s maritime patrol aircraft are based at RAAF Base Edinburgh near Adelaide and most of its transport aircraft are based at RAAF Base Richmond in Sydney. RAAF Base Edinburgh is also home to the control centre for the Jindalee Operational Radar Network. Most of the RAAF&#x27;s training aircraft are based at RAAF Base Pearce near Perth with the remaining aircraft located at RAAF Base East Sale near Sale, Victoria, and RAAF Base Williamtown. The RAAF also maintains a network of bases in northern Australia to support operations to Australia&#x27;s north. These bases include RAAF Base Darwin and RAAF Base Townsville and three &#x27;bare bases&#x27; in Queensland and Western Australia. Of the RAAF&#x27;s operational bases, only Tindal is located near an area in which the service&#x27;s aircraft might feasibly see combat. While this protects the majority of the RAAF&#x27;s assets from air attack, most air bases are poorly defended and aircraft are generally hangared in un-hardened shelters.

==Domestic responsibilities==

In addition to its military role, the ADF contributes to domestic security as well as disaster relief efforts in Australia and overseas. These functions are primarily the responsibility of civilian agencies, and the ADF&#x27;s role in them requires specific justification and authorisation.

Elements of the ADF are frequently called out to contribute to relief efforts following natural disasters in Australia or overseas. The ADF&#x27;s role in these efforts is set out in Australia&#x27;s emergency management plans. The ADF typically contributes specialist capabilities, such as engineers or transport, to support the civil authorities. For major disasters, this can involve a large-scale deployment of personnel and assets. While the ADF has a commitment to assist relief efforts, several defence white papers have specified that this is a secondary responsibility to the force&#x27;s focus on maintaining combat capabilities. As a result, requests for assistance have to be balanced against military priorities. No elements of the ADF are specifically tasked with or equipped for disaster relief efforts.

The ADF can also be tasked with providing aid to civil authorities outside of natural disasters; for instance in response to industrial action or to assist civilian police maintain law and order. This rarely occurs, however, and most Australians consider the use of military personnel to break strikes or undertake law enforcement to be inappropriate. Due to the political sensitivities associated with strike breaking, the ADF conducts little planning or other preparations for this role and the &quot;Defence Act&quot; explicitly states that reservists may not be called out or deployed in response to industrial action.
Over recent years, the ADF has been frequently committed to disaster relief. This has included deployments of large numbers of personnel to support fire fighting efforts during the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season and to assist state police and healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The scale of these deployments and the disruption they have caused to military training has led to suggestions that either elements of the Army Reserve be dedicated to disaster relief or a separate civilian organisation be established to take on the duties the ADF is undertaking.

The ADF makes a significant contribution to Australia&#x27;s domestic maritime security. ADF ships, aircraft and Regional Force Surveillance Units conduct patrols of northern Australia in conjunction with the Australian Border Force (ABF). This operation, which is code-named Operation Resolute, is commanded by the Maritime Border Command which is jointly manned by members of the ADF and ABF. This operation involves a considerable proportion of the ADF&#x27;s assets, with the forces assigned typically including two major naval vessels, multiple patrol boats, Regional Force Surveillance Unit patrols and AP-3 Orion aircraft. The ADF also often contributes to search and rescue efforts coordinated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and other civilian agencies.

While the ADF does not have a significant nation-building role, it provides assistance to remote Indigenous Australian communities through the Army Aboriginal Community Assistance Program. Under this program, which has been conducted since 1997, an engineer squadron works with one community for several months each year to upgrade local infrastructure and provide training. The ADF also took part in the intervention in remote Northern Territory Indigenous communities between June 2007 and October 2008. During this operation more than 600 ADF personnel provided logistical support to the Northern Territory Emergency Response Task Force and helped conduct child health checks.

The ADF shares responsibility for counter-terrorism with civilian law enforcement agencies. Under &quot;Australia&#x27;s Counter-Terrorism Strategy&quot;, the state and territory police and emergency services have the primary responsibility for responding to any terrorist incidents on Australian territory. If a terrorist threat or the consequences of an incident are beyond the capacity of civilian authorities to resolve, the ADF may be called out to provide support following a request from the relevant state or territory government. The Commonwealth Government has responsibility for responding to offshore terrorist incidents. ADF liaison officers are posted to civilian law enforcement agencies, and the military offers specialised training to police counter-terrorism teams. To meet its counter-terrorism responsibilities the ADF maintains two elite Tactical Assault Groups, the Special Operations Engineer Regiment as well as a company-sized high readiness group in each Army Reserve brigade and the 1st Commando Regiment. ADF intelligence assets also work with other Australian Government and police agencies to counter foreign terrorist threats. While these forces provide a substantial counter-terrorism capability, the ADF does not regard domestic security as being part of its &quot;core business&quot;.

==Foreign defence relations==
The Australian Defence Force cooperates with militaries around the world. Australia&#x27;s formal military agreements include the ANZUS Alliance with the United States, the Closer Defence Program with New Zealand, the Five Power Defence Arrangements with Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and the ABCA Armies Standardisation Program with the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. Australia has also established a partnership with NATO. ADF activities under these agreements include participating in joint planning, intelligence sharing, personnel exchanges, equipment standardisation programs and joint exercises. Australia is also a member of the UKUSA signals intelligence gathering agreement. Members of the ADF are posted to Australian diplomatic missions around the world as defence attachés; in 2016 the role of these officers was expanded to include promoting export sales for the Australian defence industry. The &quot;2016 Defence White Paper&quot; stated that the Government will seek to further expand the ADF&#x27;s international engagement.

Singapore and the United States maintain military units in Australia. Two Republic of Singapore Air Force pilot training squadrons with a total of 230 personnel are based in Australia. The Singapore Armed Forces also uses the Shoalwater Bay Military Training Area in Queensland for large-scale exercises; under the terms of a bilateral agreement, these run for up to 18 weeks each year and involve as many as 14,000 Singaporean personnel.
The United States maintains intelligence and communications facilities in Australia which are staffed by 1,700 personnel. The intelligence facilities comprise the Pine Gap satellite tracking station near Alice Springs and Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt near Exmouth, Western Australia. Pine Gap is jointly operated by Australian and United States personnel and Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt has been an exclusively Australian-operated facility since 1999. In early 2007 the Australian Government approved the construction of a new US communications installation at the Defence Signals Directorate Australian Defence Satellite Communications Station facility near Geraldton, Western Australia, to provide a ground station for the US-led Wideband Global System which Australia is partly funding. The United States Military also frequently uses Australian exercise areas and these facilities have been upgraded to support joint Australian-United States training. In November 2011, the Australian and American Governments announced plans to base on rotational basis a United States Marine Corps Marine Air-Ground Task Force in the Northern Territory for training and exercise purposes and increase rotations of United States Air Force (USAF) aircraft through northern Australia. As part of this agreement, the Marine Rotational Force – Darwin has been deployed to Australia for six months each year since 2012. It is planned for this force to eventually comprise around 2,500 personnel with supporting aircraft and equipment. The expanded rotations of USAF units to Australia began in early 2017.

The ADF provides assistance to militaries in Australia&#x27;s region through the Defence Cooperation Program. Under this program the ADF provides assistance with training, infrastructure, equipment and logistics and participates in joint exercises with countries in South East Asia and Oceania. The Pacific Patrol Boat Program is the largest Defence Cooperation Program activity and supports 22 Pacific class patrol boats operated by twelve South Pacific countries. Other important activities include supporting the development of the Timor Leste Defence Force and Papua New Guinea Defence Force and supplying watercraft to the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Australia also directly contributes to the defence of Pacific countries by periodically deploying warships and aircraft to patrol their territorial waters; this includes an annual deployment of RAAF AP-3 Orions to the region as part of a multi-national maritime surveillance operation. Under an informal agreement Australia is responsible for the defence of Nauru.

Since the signing of the Japan-Australia Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement, the Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation between Japan and Australia, and the Reciprocal Access Agreement between Japan and Australia, the Australian Defence Force has been working closely with the Japan Self-Defense Forces on various joint operations, training exercises, and strategic initiatives. These agreements have significantly enhanced bilateral defence cooperation, improving interoperability, mutual support, and coordination in regional security matters.

<text>Foreign relations of Australia are influenced by its position as a leading trading nation and as a significant donor of humanitarian aid. Australia&#x27;s foreign policy is guided by a commitment to multilateralism and regionalism, as well as to build strong bilateral relations with its allies. Key concerns include free trade, terrorism, refugees, economic co-operation with Asia and stability in the Indo-Pacific. Australia is active in the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations. Given its history of starting and supporting important regional and global initiatives, it has been described as a regional middle power par excellence.

It maintains significant ties with ASEAN and has become steadfastly allied with New Zealand, through long-standing ties dating back to the 1800s. The country also has a longstanding alliance with the United States of America. Over recent decades Australia has sought to strengthen its relationship with Asian countries, with this becoming the focus of the country&#x27;s network of diplomatic missions. In 2021, Australia signed a significant security partnership with the United Kingdom and the United States of America (AUKUS) aimed at upholding security in the Indo-Pacific region.

==History==

===Post-Federation period===
The Department of External Affairs was one of the inaugural departments created upon the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901, but largely remained an appendage of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department. Outside of the prime minister, the role of Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom (established in 1910) remained the most significant conduit for Australian foreign relations, with its significance emphasisesd that the first three appointees were former prime ministers. It has been suggested that, for Australia&#x27;s early governments, foreign policy meant &quot;relations with London on matters of imperial foreign policy on which Australia might have an interest&quot;.

Australia&#x27;s first prime minister Edmund Barton was in favour of a uniform foreign policy for the British Empire, suggesting Australia could have no &quot;foreign policy of its own&quot; but expected that the British government would defer to the Australian perspective for &quot;regional&quot; imperial policy. Barton&#x27;s successor Alfred Deakin also repeatedly lobbied the British government for greater consultation on imperial foreign policy and suggested the establishment of an imperial department of state to coordinate policy, as part of his broader support for an Imperial Federation. Deakin took some of the first steps towards diplomatic independence by dealing directly with the Japanese consul-general, for which he was reminded by the Colonial Office that it &quot;expected Australia to conduct any dealings with a foreign power through London&quot;. He also dealt directly with the U.S. consul in Sydney to engineer the visit of the Great White Fleet in 1908. His actions &quot;set a precedent for unilateralism&quot; in foreign policy that was followed by his immediate successors as prime minister, although with a continued reliance on the British diplomatic service and policy-making apparatus and no efforts to develop Australian equivalents.

===World War I and 1920s===
World War I brought about an increase in direct Australian engagement with govermnents outside the British Empire, prompted by strategic concerns including the fate of German territories in the Pacific captured by Australian troops during the war. Prime Minister Billy Hughes visited the United States in 1918 and &quot;in a series of meetings and speeches, called on the US to cooperate with Australia in ensuring postwar security in the Far East&quot;. At the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, Hughes led an Australian section within the British delegation and co-signed the Treaty of Versailles on behalf of Australia, as with other British dominions. Hughes lobbied powerfully for Australian interests at the conference, including the granting of League of Nations mandates over the former German New Guinea and Nauru and opposition to Japan&#x27;s Racial Equality Proposal to protect the White Australia policy.

The 1920s marked &quot;the genesis of a distinct Australian foreign policy&quot;, largely in response to changing power dynamics and the decline in British influence in the Pacific following the Washington Naval Conference of 1922 influence. Australia continued continued to rely on &quot;the UK and its imperial machinery for diplomatic representation and economic and material security&quot;. Following the 1923 Imperial Conference, attempts to formulate a uniform imperial foreign policy were largely abandoned in favour of a system of dominion ratification of British decisions. Governmental interest in foreign policy declined during the Great Depression as the Scullin government concentrated on internal economic matters. In 1929, internationalist Frederic Eggleston complained to a Senate committee that &quot;no parliament which is responsible for its own foreign policy has less discussion on foreign affairs than does the Australian Parliament&quot;.

While yet to exchange formal diplomatic representatives, Australia made a number of &quot;quasi-diplomatic&quot; appointments in the post-war period, who functioned as official representatives of the Australian government but held no diplomatic rank. These included appointment of Henry Braddon to the United States in 1918 with the title of &quot;commissioner&quot; and the appointment of Clive Voss as &quot;commercial agent&quot; in France in 1919. In 1921, Australia appointed its first official representative in Asia, with the appointment of Edward S. Little as trade commissioner to China, based in Shanghai. Senator Thomas Bakhap undertook a trade mission to China in 1922 at the instigation of Hughes, and in the same year Egbert Sheaf was appointed as a trade commissioner to &quot;the East&quot;, based in Singapore. The initial trade commissioner service was partially funded by state governments and ultimately failed due to a lack of support from Prime Minister Stanley Bruce and state premiers.

===1930s: appeasement and rearmament===
The appointment of the Lyons government in 1932 marked a renewed interest in foreign policy, complemented by the establishment of foreign policy departments at universities and non-governmental advisory bodies like the Australian Institute of International Affairs. Prime Minister Joseph Lyons took a keen interest in foreign relations and exerted significant influence over the government&#x27;s foreign policy. He authorised three &quot;Pacific initiatives&quot; as a sign of greater Australian interest in the Asia-Pacific. The first was the Australian Eastern Mission of 1934, led by deputy prime minister John Latham, which visited seven Asian countries and has been identified as a milestone in the early development of Australian foreign policy. The second initiative was the appointment in 1935 of Australian representatives in China, the Dutch East Indies, Japan, and United States – albeit below the rank of ambassador – where previously Australia&#x27;s interests had been represented solely by British officials. The third was Lyons&#x27;s &quot;Pacific Pact&quot; proposal, which envisioned a non-aggression pact between the major powers in the Pacific. Although he championed the pact at the 1937 Imperial Conference, discussions failed to progress. In Bird&#x27;s opinion, &quot;the Lyons years should thus be seen as a part of the evolution of Australian external policy from dependency towards autonomy […] it is perhaps the continuation and acceleration of the process of transition for which Lyons as Prime Minister ought to be best remembered&quot;.

===World War II===
The first accredited diplomat sent to a foreign country was Richard Casey, appointed as the first Minister to the United States in January 1940. This was followed shortly after by the arrival of the first Australian high commissioner to Canada, and by appointments of Ministers to Japan in 1940 and China in 1941. With the entry of Japan into the war in December 1941 and the consequent heightened vulnerability of Australia to attack, a critical decision was made by the Curtin Government to more closely seek the military protection of the United States. Since that time, United States has been the most important security ally. The close security relationship with the United States was formalized in 1951 by the Australia, New Zealand, United States Security (ANZUS) Treaty which remains the cornerstone of Australian security arrangements.

In parallel with the evolution of the British Empire to the Commonwealth of Nations, Australia progressively took responsibility for fully managing its foreign relations with other states. Australia concluded an agreement in 1944 with New Zealand dealing with the security, welfare, and advancement of the people of the dependent territories of the Pacific (the ANZAC pact). Australia was one of the founders of the United Nations (1945) and the South Pacific Commission (1947), and in 1950, it proposed the Colombo Plan to assist developing countries in Asia. After the war, Australia played a role in the Far Eastern Commission in Japan and supported Indonesian independence during that country&#x27;s revolt against the Dutch (1945–49).

===Cold War===
As the Cold War deepened, Australia aligned itself fully with the Western Powers. In addition to contributing to UN forces in the Korean War – it was the first country to announce it would do so after the United States – Australia sent troops to assist in putting down the communist revolt in Malaya in 1948–60 and later to combat the Indonesian-supported invasion of Sarawak in 1963–65. Australia sent troops to repel communism and assist South Vietnamese and American forces in the Vietnam War, in a move that stirred up antiwar activism at home. Australia has been active in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, and in the Australia – New Zealand – United Kingdom agreement and the Five Power Defence Arrangement—successive arrangements with Britain and New Zealand to ensure the security of Singapore and Malaysia.

===Contemporary issues===
After the end of the Cold War, Australia remained an important contributor to UN peacekeeping missions and to other multilateral security missions, often in alliance with the United States. Notably, it joined coalition forces in the Persian Gulf War in 1991, the War in Afghanistan (2001-2021), the Iraq War of 2003–2011 and the War in Iraq (2013-2017). In 1999 Australian peace keeping forces intervened in East Timor following its referendum to secede from Indonesia. In 2006 Australia sent a contingent of Australian troops to the state to assist in the 2006 East Timor crisis. Australia has also most recently led security assistance, peacekeeping and policing missions elsewhere in its neighbourhood, including in the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and Tonga.

In the late 20th Century and early 21st Century, a new element in Australia&#x27;s foreign relations was the growing relationship with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. After the establishment of diplomatic relations in December 1972, Sino-Australian relations grew rapidly, to a point where China became Australia&#x27;s main trading partner and extensive official and people-to-people links were well established. In the first 15 years of the 21st Century, Australia maintained privileged relations with both the United States and China. Since 2017, Sino-Australian relations have deteriorated dramatically, as a result of Australian criticism of policies and actions taken under General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping. This has strongly influenced recent Australian bilateral and multi-lateral engagements such as the Pacific Step-Up with Pacific Island states, the development of comprehensive strategic partnerships with a number of regional states, and the pursuit of alliances directed at countering Chinese predominance in the Indo-Pacific region. Since 2017, existing security arrangements have been augmented by a revived Quadrilateral Security Dialogue involving India, Japan and United States, the 2021 AUKUS security partnership with the United States and United Kingdom and the 2022 Australia-Japan Reciprocal Access Agreement, which provides for closer Australian-Japanese cooperation on defence and humanitarian operations.

==International agencies, treaties, and agreements==

=== Membership of international organizations and groupings ===
One of the drafters of the UN Charter, Australia has given firm support to the United Nations system. Australia held the first Presidency of the Security Council in 1946 and provided the first military observers under UN auspices a year later, to Indonesia. It has been a member of the Security Council a further four times, in 1956–57, 1973–74, 1986–87 and 2013–14. It has been regularly elected a member of the Economic and Social Council most recently for 2020–22, a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2018–20 and its predecessor the UN Commission on Human Rights in the 1990s. Australia takes a prominent part in many other UN activities, including peacekeeping, disarmament negotiations, and narcotics control. In September 1999, acting under a UN Security Council mandate, Australia led an international coalition to restore order in East Timor upon Indonesia&#x27;s withdrawal from that territory. Australia has also been closely engaged in international development cooperation and humanitarian assistance through the Specialized agencies, Funds and Programmes and Regional Commissions of the United Nations and major International Financial Institutions, in particular the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

Australia is a member of the G20, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the APEC forum. It is active in meetings of the Commonwealth Heads of Government, the Pacific Islands Forum and other Pacific Islands regional organizations and the Indian Ocean Rim Association. It has been a leader in the Cairns Group – countries pressing for agricultural trade reform in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations. Australia is also a member of MIKTA, an informal and diverse middle power partnership between Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey and Australia, led by its foreign ministers, which seeks to promote an effective, rules-based global order.

Australia has devoted particular attention in the early 21st century to promoting regional architecture centred around the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to support dialogue on political, security and economic challenges in the Indo-Pacific region. Australia is an active participant in the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), and the ASEAN sponsored East Asia Summit. Australia&#x27;s place at the 2005 inaugural summit was only secured after it agreed to to ASEAN&#x27;s Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. Australia had been reluctant to sign the treaty out of concerns regarding how it would affect Australia&#x27;s obligation under other treaty arrangements including ANZUS.

=== Security treaties ===

=== Special strategic partnership ===
*Japan (as of 2014). Under this partnership, Australia and Japan have established a strong and broad-ranging security relationship under the renewed 2022 Australia-Japan Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation.

=== Comprehensive strategic partnerships ===
Comprehensive strategic partnerships are broad, high level relationships which have increasingly been formalized in the Asia-Pacific region under this description since the early 21st century. They are arrangements which, in general, convey a sense of mutual value, strategic alignment and positive intent to further strengthen ties. They establish the framework for an intensified level of engagement across governments and indicate particularly close bilateral relations. Australia has a formal comprehensive strategic partnership with the following countries and multi-national organizations:

*Singapore (as of 2016)
*Indonesia (as of 2018)
*India (as of 2020)
*Papua New Guinea (as of 2020)
*Malaysia (as of 2021)
*South Korea (as of 2021)
*ASEAN (as of 2021)
*Vietnam (as of 2024)

In 2014, the Australian Prime Minister and Chinese President agreed to describe the relationship as a &quot;comprehensive strategic partnership&quot;, and this helped facilitate an extensive program of engagement. This partnership went into dormancy, particularly from 2020, but is being gradually revived with the improvement of relations since 2023.

==Trade==
Overall Australia&#x27;s largest trading partners are the United States, South Korea, Japan, China, and the United Kingdom. Australia currently has bilateral Free Trade Agreements with New Zealand, the United States, Thailand and Singapore as of 2007 and the United Kingdom as of 2021. As well as this, Australia is in the process undertaking studies on Free Trade Agreements with ASEAN, China, Chile, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia.

===Armaments===

To bolster its foreign policy, Australia maintains a very well-equipped military.
According to SIPRI, Australia is the eight largest importer of major weapons in the world.The US supplied 80 per cent of Australia&#x27;s imports and Spain 15 per cent. All armed services have received new major arms in 2014–18, but mainly aircraft and ships. The F-35 combat aircraft and antisubmarine warfare aircraft from the USA made up 53 per cent of Australian arms imports in 2014–18, while ships from Spain accounted for 29 per cent.

Australia is modernising its armed forces but also acquiring weapons that significantly increase its long-range capabilities. Among the weapons imported in 2010–14 were 5 tanker aircraft and the first of 2 amphibious assault ships from Spain, along with 2 large transport aircraft and 4 airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft from the USA. Australia also received 26 combat aircraft from the US, with 82 more on order (see box 3), as well as 8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft from the US and 3 Hobart destroyers from Spain. 

In 2021, after Australia ended its 20-year military mission in Afghanistan, the defence officials held formal talks on strengthening military ties with the United Arab Emirates. However, the human rights groups said that it was &quot;very concerning&quot; to witness, as the Emirates was accused of carrying out &quot;unlawful attacks&quot; in war-torn nations like Libya and Yemen.

In contrast to 2014-18, the period from 2019-23 saw a 21 per cent decline in Australia&#x27;s major arms imports. 
However, in December 2021, Australia signed a defence procurement deal with South Korea worth $1billion AUD (US$720 million) for modern artillery, supply trucks and radars supplied by South Korean defense company Hanwha. The South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison met for the signing of the agreement and additionally announced they were formally upgrading the Australian-South Korean relationship to a &quot;comprehensive strategic partnership.&quot; Moreover, in 2023 Australia reached an agreement with the UK and the USA to import at least six nuclear-powered submarines. 

==International aid==
According to the Australian think tank Lowy Institute, Australia is the Pacific region&#x27;s largest development partner, disbursing A$17 billion worth of international aid between 2008 and 2021, accounting for 40% of the region&#x27;s overseas development finance (ODF). Australian international aid in the Pacific exceeded other regional partners including the Asian Development Bank, China, New Zealand and Japan. Between 2019 and 2021, Australian&#x27;s overseas development finance in the Pacific rose from A$1.34 billion in 2019 to A$1.89 billion in 2021.

In May 2024, RNZ reported that the Albanese Government had slightly increased Australia&#x27;s foreign aid budget by four percent, bringing its total 2024–2025 aid o A$4.961 billion budget. In August 2023, the Government had released its new international development strategy, which promised new country, gender, disability and humanitarian aid strategies.

==Diplomatic relations==

As of 2011, Australia had established formal diplomatic relations with all members of the United Nations as well as the Holy See, Kosovo, Cook Islands and (in 2014) Niue. In many cases, diplomatic relations are maintained on a non-resident basis, with the Australian ambassador or high commissioner based in another country. Since 2012, diplomatic relations have been effectively suspended with the Syrian Arab Republic, with no diplomatic accreditation by either country maintained, but consular relations continue. In the case of Afghanistan, following the Taliban takeover in 2021, diplomatic relations are in an ambiguous status with Australia &quot;temporarily&quot; closing its embassy in Kabul and not recognizing the Islamic Emirate government but maintaining the credentials of the embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in Canberra. A number of Canadian missions provide consular assistance to Australians in countries in Africa where Australia does not maintain an office (and Australia reciprocates this arrangement for Canada in some other countries) through the Canada-Australia Consular Services Sharing Agreement.

Due to the One China Policy of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Australian Office in Taiwan (formerly the Australian Commerce and Industry Office) unofficially represents Australia&#x27;s interest in Taiwan, serving a function similar to other Australian Consulates.

Australia is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum and other regional organisations. As part of its Pacific Step-Up initiative announced in 2016 Australia has uniquely established resident High Commissions and embassies in all independent and self governing members of the Pacific Islands Forum as well as consulates-general in New Caledonia and French Polynesia. Australia provides aid to many of its developing Pacific Islands neighbours, and to Papua New Guinea. For decades, it has been the largest donor of aid to the Oceania region. China and New Zealand, the next biggest donors, donated only one sixth of Australia&#x27;s aid during the 2010s.

Since the end of the Cold War, the understanding from the United States has been that Australia and New Zealand would assume responsibility for the security of much of the Oceania region, whom they already share pre-existing cultural and economic ties to.

Australia&#x27;s approach to the Pacific has included frequent references to what it has perceived as an &quot;Arc of Instability&quot; among its island neighbours. In August 2006 Australian Defence Minister Brendan Nelson stated to the Australian Parliament:

We cannot afford to have failing states in our region. The so-called &#x27;arc of instability&#x27;, which basically goes from East Timor through to the south-west Pacific states, means that not only does Australia have a responsibility in preventing and indeed assisting with humanitarian and disaster relief, but also that we cannot allow any of these countries to become havens for transnational crime, nor indeed havens for terrorism.

As from early 2008, the Australian government led by Kevin Rudd began what it called a &quot;new approach&quot; to relations between Australia and the Pacific, appointing a Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs, Duncan Kerr. In February, Kerr and fellow Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Bob McMullan visited Samoa, Tonga and Kiribati in February, and stated:

Broadly, the approach is one of much more partnership and engagement on the basis of mutual respect. We&#x27;re not going to be lecturing or hectoring, we&#x27;re going to try and work together with them and I think we set a pretty good standard with the way we started. The relationships we&#x27;ve established with ministers and leaders in those countries [Kiribati, Tonga and Samoa] is very positive.

Richard Marles, the deputy leader of the Australian Labor Party, has strongly advocated for Australia to prioritize its role in the Pacific. In 2021, he wrote a book titled &quot;Tides that bind: Australia in the Pacific&quot;, and claimed in an interview that, &quot;By any measure, we are huge part of the Pacific. We&#x27;re the largest donor into the Pacific, we&#x27;ve got the biggest diplomatic footprint in the Pacific, we&#x27;ve got the most development resources in the Pacific of any country. For most of the Pacific, we&#x27;re the most important bilateral relationship they have, more important than the United States, more important than China.&quot;

<text>[[Austria]] is a predominantly mountainous country in Central Europe, approximately between Germany, Italy and Hungary. It has a total area of .

Austria shares national borders with Switzerland (a non-European Union member state, which it borders for 158 km, or 98 mi) and the principality of Liechtenstein (also a non-EU member state, of which it borders for 34 km or 21 mi) to the west, Germany (801 km or 497 mi) and the Czech Republic (402 km or 249 mi) and Slovakia (105 km or 65 mi) to the north, Hungary to the east (331 km or 205 mi), and Slovenia (330 km or 185 mi) and Italy (404 km or 251 mi) to the south (total: 2,534 km or 1,574 mi).

The westernmost third of the somewhat pear-shaped country consists of a narrow corridor between Germany and Italy that is between wide. The rest of Austria lies to the east and has a maximum north–south width of . The country measures almost in length, extending from Lake Constance (German &quot;Bodensee&quot;) on the Austrian-Swiss-German border in the west to the Neusiedler See on the Austrian-Hungarian border in the east. The contrast between these two lakes – one in the Alps and the other a typical steppe lake on the westernmost fringe of the Hungarian Plain – illustrates the diversity of Austria&#x27;s landscape.

Seven of Austria&#x27;s nine federal states have long historical traditions predating the establishment of the Republic of Austria in 1918: Upper Austria, Lower Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Salzburg, Tyrol, and Vorarlberg. The states of Burgenland and Vienna were established after World War I. Most of Burgenland had been part of the Kingdom of Hungary, but it had a predominantly German-speaking population and hence became Austrian. Administrative and ideological reasons played a role in the establishment of Vienna as an independent state. Vienna, historically the capital of Lower Austria, was a socialist stronghold, whereas Lower Austria was conservative, and both socialists and conservatives wanted to consolidate their influence in their respective states. Each state has a state capital with the exception of Vienna, which is a state in its own right in addition to being the federal capital. In Vienna, the City Council and the mayor function as a state parliament (Landtag) and state governor (Landeshauptmann), respectively.

== Physical geography ==

===Landform regions===

Austria may be divided into three unequal geographical areas. The largest part of Austria (62%) is occupied by the relatively young mountains of the Alps, but in the east, these give way to a part of the Pannonian plain, and north of the river Danube lies the Bohemian Forest, an older, but lower, granite mountain range.

==== River Danube ====
The Danube has its source near Donaueschingen in southwestern Germany and flows through Austria before emptying into the Black Sea. It is the only major European river that flows eastwards, and its importance as an inland waterway has been enhanced by the completion in 1992 of the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal in Bavaria, which connects the rivers Rhine and Main with the Danube and makes barge traffic from the North Sea to the Black Sea possible.

The major rivers north of the watershed of the Austrian Alps (the Inn in Tyrol, the Salzach in Salzburg, and the Enns in Styria and Upper Austria) are direct tributaries of the Danube and flow north into the Danube valley, whereas the rivers south of the watershed in central and eastern Austria (the Gail and Drau rivers in Carinthia and the Mürz and Mur in Styria) flow south into the drainage system of the Drau, which eventually empties into the Danube in Serbia. Consequently, central and eastern Austria are geographically oriented away from the watershed of the Alps: the provinces of Upper Austria and Lower Austria toward the Danube and the provinces of Carinthia and Styria toward the Drau.

==== The Alps ====
Three major ranges of the Alps – the Northern Calcareous Alps, Central Alps, and Southern Calcareous Alps – run west to east through Austria. The Central Alps, which consist largely of a granite base, are the largest and highest ranges in Austria. The Central Alps run from Tyrol to approximately the Styria-Lower Austria border and include areas that are permanently glaciated in the Ötztal Alps on the Tyrolean–Italian border and the High Tauern in East Tyrol and Carinthia. The Northern Calcareous Alps, which run from Vorarlberg through Tyrol into Salzburg along the German border and through Upper Austria and Lower Austria toward Vienna, and the Southern Calcareous Alps, on the Carinthia-Slovenia border, are predominantly limestone and dolomite. At 3,797 m, Großglockner is the highest mountain in Austria. As a general rule, the farther east the Northern and Central Alps run, the lower they become. The altitude of the mountains also drops north and south of the central ranges.

As a geographic feature, the Alps literally overshadow other landform regions. Just over 28% of Austria is moderately hilly or flat: the Northern Alpine Foreland, which includes the Danube Valley; the lowlands and hilly regions in northeastern and eastern Austria, which include the Danube Basin; and the rolling hills and lowlands of the Southeastern Alpine Foreland. The parts of Austria that are most suitable for settlement – that is, arable and climatically favorable – run north of the Alps through the provinces of Upper Austria and Lower Austria in the Danube Valley and then curve east and south of the Alps through Lower Austria, Vienna, Burgenland, and Styria. Austria&#x27;s least mountainous landscape is southeast of the low Leithagebirge, which forms the southern lip of the Vienna Basin, where the steppe of the Hungarian Plain begins.

==== Bohemian Forest (mountain range) ====
The granite massif of the Bohemian Forest (known in German as the &quot;Böhmerwald&quot;), a low mountain range with bare and windswept plateaus and a harsh climate, is located north of the Danube Valley and covers the remaining 10% of Austria&#x27;s area. Notable is the Manhartsberg a granite ridge which separates Waldviertel from Weinviertel.

=== Forests ===
In Austria forest cover is around 47% of the total land area, equivalent to 3,899,150 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, up from 3,775,670 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 2,227,500 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 1,671,500 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 2% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 23% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 18% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership, 82% private ownership and 0% with ownership listed as other or unknown.

==Human geography==


Land-use patterns in Austria change from Alpine to non-Alpine regions. Approximately one-tenth of Austria is barren or unproductive, that is, extremely Alpine or above the tree line. Just over 40% of Austria is covered by forests, the majority of which is in Alpine regions. Less than one-fifth of Austria is arable and suitable for conventional agriculture. The percentage of arable land in Austria increases in the East as the country becomes less alpine. More than one-fifth of Austria is pasture and meadow located at varying altitudes. Almost half of this grassland consists of high Alpine pastures.

Historically, high Alpine pastures have been used during the summer for grazing dairy cattle, thus making space available at lower altitudes for cultivating and harvesting fodder for winter. Many of the high pastures are at altitudes of more than 1,000 m.

Although agriculture in mountainous areas was at one time economically viable, in recent decades it has survived only with the help of extensive subsidies.

The Alps make many areas of Austria uninhabitable. Austria&#x27;s so-called areas of permanent settlement – regions that are cultivated, continuously inhabited, and used for transportation, but do not include forests, Alpine pastures, or barren land – cover only 40% or 35,000 km2 of the country. The great majority of the area of permanent settlement is in the Danube valley and the lowlands or hilly regions north, east, and south of the Alps, where approximately two-thirds of the population lives.

In the country&#x27;s predominantly Alpine provinces, most of the population live in river valleys: Bregenz on the shores of Lake Constance in Vorarlberg; Innsbruck on the river Inn in Tyrol; Salzburg on the river Salzach in Salzburg; and Klagenfurt on the Wörthersee lake in Carinthia. The higher the Alps are, the less inhabitable they become in terms of soil, microclimate, and vegetation. Conversely, the lower and broader the Alpine valleys are, the more densely populated they become.

Tyrol illustrates most clearly the relationship between Alpine geography and habitation. As the most mountainous province (less than 3% of the land is arable), it is the most sparsely inhabited, with an area of permanent settlement of only 15%.

Because of the Alps, the country as a whole is one of the least densely populated states of Western and Central Europe. With ninety-three inhabitants per square kilometre, Austria has a population density similar to that of the former Yugoslavia.

Austria&#x27;s national borders and geography have corresponded very little. Since the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Alps and the Danube have not served to mark political boundaries. Even within Austria, provincial borders were only occasionally set by the ranges and ridges of the Alps.

Although the Alps did not mark political boundaries, they often separated groups of people from one another. Because in the past the Alps were impassable, inhabitants isolated in valleys or networks of valleys developed distinct regional subcultures. Consequently, the inhabitants of one valley frequently maintained dialects, native or traditional dress, architectural styles, and folklore that substantially differed from those of the next valley. Differences were great enough that the origins of outsiders could easily be identified. However, mass media, mobility, prosperity, and tourism have eroded the distinctness of Alpine regional subcultures to a great extent by reducing the isolation that gave them their particular character.

Despite the Alps, Austria has historically been a land of transit. The Danube valley, for centuries Central Europe&#x27;s aquatic link to the Balkan Peninsula and the &quot;Orient&quot; in the broadest sense of the word, has always been an avenue of east–west transit. However, Europe&#x27;s division into two opposing economic and military blocs after World War II diminished Austria&#x27;s importance as a place of transit. Since the opening of Eastern Europe in 1989, the country has begun to re-assume its historical role. By the early 1990s, it had already experienced a substantial increase in the number of people and vehicles crossing its eastern frontiers.

Within the Alps, four passes and the roads that run through them are of particular importance for north–south transit. The Semmering Pass on the provincial border of Lower Austria and Styria connects the Vienna Basin with the Mürz and Mur valleys, thus providing northeast–southwest access to Styria and Slovenia, and, via Carinthia, to Italy.

The Pyrhn Pass between the provinces of Upper Austria and Styria and the Tauern Pass between the High Tauern range and the Lower Tauern range of the Central Alps in Salzburg, provide access to the Mur Valley in Styria and the Drau Valley in Carinthia, respectively. The highways that run through these passes are important northwest–southeast lines of communication through the Alps. The Pyrhn highway has been nicknamed the &quot;Fremdarbeiterweg&quot; (&quot;foreign workers&#x27; route&quot;) because millions of &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot; (&quot;guest workers&quot;) in Germany use it to return to their homes in the Balkans and Turkey for vacation. Many Germans and northern Europeans also use it in the summer months to reach the Adriatic coast. After the outbreak of hostilities in Yugoslavia in the summer of 1991, however, a substantial amount of this traffic was re-routed through the Danube Valley and Hungary.

The most important pass in the Austrian Alps is the Brenner Pass, located on the Austrian-Italian border in Tyrol. At 1,370 m, it is one of the lowest Alpine passes. The route up the Inn valley and over the Brenner Pass has been historically an important and convenient route of north–south transit between Germany and Italy, and provides the most direct route between Europe&#x27;s two most highly industrialized regions: Germany and northern Italy.

==Climate==

The Alps serve as a watershed for Europe&#x27;s three major kinds of weather systems that influence Austrian weather. The Atlantic maritime climate from the northwest is characterized by low-pressure fronts, mild air from the Gulf Stream, and precipitation. It has the greatest influence on the northern slopes of the Alps, the Northern Alpine Foreland, and the Danube valley. The continental climate is characterized by low pressure fronts with precipitation in summer and high pressure systems with cold and dry air in winter. It affects mainly eastern Austria. Mediterranean high-pressure systems from the south are characterized by few clouds and warm air, and they influence the weather of the southern slopes of the Alps and that of the Southeastern Alpine Foreland, making them the most temperate part of Austria.

One peculiarity of the Mediterranean weather systems is the föhn wind, a warm air mass that originates in the African Sahara and moves north rapidly, periodically raising temperatures up to in a short period of time. Many people respond to this rapid weather change with headaches, irritability, and circulatory problems. During the winter, the rapid warming that accompanies a föhn can thaw the snow cover in the Alps to such an extent that avalanches occur.

Given the importance of Alpine skiing for the Austrian tourist industry, December is the month during which the weather is watched with the greatest anticipation. As a rule, Atlantic maritime weather systems bring snow, and continental weather systems help keep it. However, a predominance of cold, dry continental systems or warm Mediterranean ones inevitably postpone the beginning of the ski season. In the summer, Mediterranean high-pressure systems bring warm, sunny weather.

==Ecological concerns==
Austrians faced a number of ecological problems in the 1990s. One of the most pressing is the pollution caused by the staggering increase of traffic through the country. Traffic on the superhighway going through the Brenner Pass has, for example, increased from 600,000 vehicles per year in the early 1970s to over 10 million per year in the early 1990s. One quarter of the traffic crossing Austria consists of semitrailers used for heavy transport. The opening of Eastern Europe has only exacerbated the problem of transit traffic.

The Alpine valleys through which much of this traffic passes are unusually vulnerable to ecological damage. Narrow valleys are not conducive to dissipation of noise or pollutants caused by motor vehicles. Inversions – cold layers of air that trap warm layers of air or warm layers of air that trap cold layers in the valleys and lowlands – also seasonally contribute to the magnitude of the pollution problem.

Austria has negotiated with the EU to set limits on the amount of commercial transit traffic, especially through Tyrol. Work is also under way to develop a &quot;piggy-back&quot; system of loading semitrailers on to flatbed railroad cars in southern Germany and northern Italy, transporting them through Tyrol by rail. Environmentalists have pushed for measures that are more far-reaching. They advocate, for example, digging a tunnel from Garmisch-Partenkirchen in southern Germany to Bolzano in northern Italy.

Pollution is also brought by the weather systems that determine the country&#x27;s climate. Atlantic maritime weather systems carry pollution into Austria from northwestern Europe. Austria&#x27;s proximity to industrialized regions of former Communist states, with negligible or no pollution control policies or equipment, combined with the influence of continental weather systems also have proved to be extremely harmful. Mediterranean weather systems transmit industrial pollutants from northern Italy.

As a result of domestic and foreign pollution, 37% of Austria&#x27;s forests had been damaged by acid rain and/or pollutant emissions by 1991. The damage to forests has had dire consequences, including the decimation of forests that for centuries had protected many Alpine communities from avalanches, erosion, mudslides, or flooding caused by runoff.

The seriousness of the ecological problems confronting the country gave rise in the 1970s to an environmentalist movement. Political parties were formed, and representatives were elected to parliament. A referendum in 1978 closed down a newly completed nuclear power station and turned the country away from the exploitation of nuclear energy. Public opposition in 1984 stopped the planned construction of a hydroelectric power station in a wetlands region.

The country&#x27;s long-standing commercial use of the Alps for recreational purposes has also come under examination. Extensive tourism places an inordinate amount of pressure on sensitive Alpine ecosystems. Ski runs damage forests, as do summer sports such as off-trail mountain hiking or mountain biking. Many Alpine villages have also grown greatly because of the tourist industry. In extreme cases, they have up to twenty hotel beds for each inhabitant, a ratio that places a disproportionate seasonal burden on communal infrastructures and the environment. For these reasons, efforts have been made to introduce &quot;green&quot; or &quot;soft&quot; forms of tourism that are more compatible with the Alpine environment.

Part of the solution to Austria&#x27;s ecological problems is being sought in stricter environmental legislation at the domestic level. Ultimately, however, pan-European and global cooperation in the realm of pollution and emission control will be necessary to protect the country&#x27;s environment.

<doc id="67545" wikidata="Q8085" url="?curid=67545" title="Economy of Austria">
<text>The economy of Austria is a highly developed social market economy, with the country being one of the fourteen richest in the world in terms of GDP (gross domestic product) per capita. Until the 1980s, many of Austria&#x27;s largest industry firms were nationalised. In recent years, privatisation has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies. Among OECD nations, Austria has a highly efficient and strong social security system; social expenditure stood at roughly 29.4% of GDP. 

Labor movements are particularly strong in Austria, and they have a large influence on labor politics. Next to a highly developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the national economy. The economy of Austria&#x27;s average GDP is 13th growth in OECD countries, from 1992 to 2017. In Austria, 1.37% over average population growth is the strong factor.

Germany has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making the Austrian economy vulnerable to rapid changes in the German economy. However, since Austria became a member state of the European Union, it has gained closer ties to other European Union economies. This development reduced its economic dependence on Germany. In addition, Austria&#x27;s membership in the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors.

They were attracted by Austria&#x27;s access to the European Single Market and the country&#x27;s proximity to the aspiring economies of the European Union. Growth in GDP has accelerated in recent years, and reached 3.3% in 2006.

In 2024 Austria has a very high, $58,669 nominal GDP per capita ranked 13th.

Vienna was ranked the fifth richest NUTS-2 region within Europe (see Economy of the European Union), with its GDP reaching €38,632 per capita. It was trailing behind Inner London, Luxembourg, the Brussels-Capital Region and Hamburg.

Growth had been steady between 2002 and 2006, varying between 1 and 3.3%. After hitting 0% in 2013, growth had picked up a little. As of 2016, growth was set at 1.5%.

==History==
=== Foundation and &quot;Interbellum&quot; ===
First Austrian Republic, founded as a result of the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, inherited an economy battered by the ravages of the First World War, namely:

* The abolition of the gold standard in 1914.
* Provision by the central bank of credit to the state, increasing the money supply.
* The balance-of-payments deficit caused by the Austrian need to import food and fuel, devaluing the krone (the Austrian currency at the time).
* The use of deficit spending to finance food subsidies, leading to a 12-fold increase of banknotes in circulation.

A number of international relief schemes failed to garner enough support while a report by Sir William Goode argued that the Austrian economy would collapse without swift foreign intervention. As such, the Austrian economic crisis stretched into its second year, with inflation running at 99%.

==== League of Nations Bailout ====

Source:

With annual inflation running at 2,877%, the League of Nations was officially appointed to organise an Austrian reconstruction plan in August 1922. The League scheme was based on the view that Austrian troubles as a result of an inability to pay for necessities and obtain credit, and therefore, an Austrian financial revival was critical to Austrian survival. To this end, the plan was focused solely on financial reconstruction. Austria would receive loans raised from international money markets and the Austrian public, which would be secured on customs and tobacco taxes. In exchange, Austria would in effect lose sovereignty over its economy, agreeing to:

* Relinquish control over the mints to an independent bank, with the aim of returning to the gold standard.
* Terminate the printing of money by the central bank.
* Eliminate the budget deficit (requiring the implementation of austerity measures and monetary control).

The measures took effect in 1923. Short-term effects were impressive; during the announcement to undertake Austrian reconstruction in August 1922, public confidence soared. Foreign currency holdings were converted back into krone, stabilising the currency. This allowed the Austrian Foreign Exchange Agency to finally intervene to fix the krone to the dollar, something that the wild gyrations of the past had not permitted. Capital rushed back into Austria, and domestic prices stabilised, pronouncing the end of hyperinflation.

The steam ran out shortly after implementation. Growth averaged 0.35% per annum until 1929, unemployment leapt five-fold, bankruptcies increased 41-fold, and the trade deficit doubled.

=== &quot;Anschluss&quot; ===

Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, and consequently lost control of its own economic policy until the formation of the Second Republic in 1945.

=== Post World War II ===
Ever since the end of the World War II, Austria has achieved sustained economic growth. In the soaring 1950s, the rebuilding efforts for Austria lead to an average annual growth rate of more than 5% in real terms and averaged about four-point five percent through most of the 1960s. Following moderate real GDP growth of 1.7%, 2% and 1.2%, respectively, in 1995, 1996, and 1997, the economy rebounded and with real GDP expansion of 2.9 percent in 1998 and 2.2% in 1999.

Austria became a member of the EU on 1 January 1995. Membership brought economic benefits and challenges and has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria&#x27;s access to the single European market. Austria also has made progress in generally increasing its international competitiveness. As a member of the economic and monetary union of the European Union (EMU), Austria&#x27;s economy is closely integrated with other EU member countries, especially with Germany. On 1 January 1999, Austria introduced the new Euro currency for accounting purposes. In January 2002, Euro notes and coins were introduced, replacing those of the Austrian schilling.

==Currency==

In Austria, Euros appear as 1999, however all Austrian euro coins introduced in 2002 have this year on it; unlike other countries of the Eurozone where mint year is minted in the coin. Eight different designs, one per face value, were selected for the Austrian coins. In 2007, in order to adopt the new common map like the rest of the Eurozone countries, Austria changed the common side of its coins.

Before adopting the Euro in 2002 Austria had maintained use of the Austrian schilling which was first established in December 1924. The Schilling was abolished in the wake of the Anschluss in 1938 and has been reintroduced after the end of the World War II in November 1945.

Austria has one of the richest collection of collectors&#x27; coins in the Eurozone, with face value ranging from 10 to 100 euro (although a 100,000 euro coin was exceptionally minted in 2004). These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of minting of silver and gold coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender in all the eurozone. For instance, a €5 Austrian commemorative coin cannot be used in any other country.

==Privatisation, state participation and labour movements==

Many of the country&#x27;s largest firms were nationalised in the early post-war period to protect them from Soviet takeover as war reparations. For many years, the government and its state-owned industries conglomerate played a very important role in the Austrian economy. However, starting in the early 1990s, the group was broken apart, state-owned firms started to operate largely as private businesses, and a great number of these firms were wholly or partially privatised. The government still operates some firms, state monopolies, utilities, and services. In the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 two banks were nationalised. Since 2019 the Österreichische Industrieholding (ÖBAG) administers the investments of the Republic of Austria in partially or entirely nationalized companies, but came under strong criticism after leaked messages showed how Thomas Schmidt had a say in the appointment of the supervisory board and became sole director. Austria enjoys well-developed industry, banking, transportation, services, and commercial facilities.

Austria has a strong labour movement. The Austrian Trade Union Federation (ÖGB) comprises constituent unions with a total membership of about 1.5 million—more than half the country&#x27;s wage and salary earners. Since 1945, the ÖGB has pursued a moderate, consensus-oriented wage policy, cooperating with industry, agriculture, and the government on a broad range of social and economic issues in what is known as Austria&#x27;s &quot;social partnership&quot;. The ÖGB has often opposed the Schüssel government&#x27;s programme for budget consolidation, social reform, and improving the business climate, and indications are rising that Austria&#x27;s peaceful social climate could become more confrontational.

==Agriculture, industry and services==

Austrian farms, like those of other west European mountainous countries, are small and fragmented, and production is relatively expensive. Since Austria&#x27;s becoming a member of the EU in 1995, the Austrian agricultural sector has been undergoing substantial reform under the EU&#x27;s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Although Austrian farmers provide about 80% of domestic food requirements, the agricultural contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) has declined since 1950 to less than 3%.

Although some industries are global competitors, such as several iron and steel works, chemical plants and oil corporations that are large industrial enterprises employing thousands of people, most industrial and commercial enterprises in Austria are relatively small on an international scale.

Most important for Austria is the service sector generating the vast majority of Austria&#x27;s GDP. Vienna has grown into a finance and consulting metropole and has established itself as the door to the East within the last decades. Viennese law firms and banks are among the leading corporations in business with the new EU member states. Tourism is very important for Austria&#x27;s economy, accounting for around 10 percent of Austria&#x27;s GDP. In 2001, Austria was the tenth most visited country in the world with over 18.2 million tourists. Previously, dependency on German guests made this sector of the Austrian economy very dependent on German economy. However recent developments have brought a change, especially since winter ski resorts such as Arlberg or Kitzbühel are now more and more frequented by Eastern Europeans, Russians and Americans.

Austria produced in 2018:

* 2.3 million tons of sugar beet (the beet is used to manufacture sugar and ethanol);
* 2.1 million tons of maize;
* 1.3 million tons of wheat;
* 697 thousand tons of potato;
* 695 thousand tons of barley;
* 387 thousand tons of apple;
* 367 thousand tons of grape;
* 278 thousand tons of triticale;
* 184 thousand tons of soybean;
* 177 thousand tons of rye (12th largest world producer);
* 132 thousand tons of onion;
* 120 thousand tons of rapeseed;
* 111 thousand tons of pear;

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.

== Health care services ==


Austria&#x27;s health care system was developed alongside other social welfare programmes by the social democrats in Vienna initially.

==Trade position==
Trade with other EU countries accounts for almost 66% of Austrian imports and exports. Expanding trade and investment in the emerging markets of central and eastern Europe is a major element of Austrian economic activity. Trade with these countries accounts for almost 14% of Austrian imports and exports, and Austrian firms have sizable investments in and continue to move labour-intensive, low-tech production to these countries. Although the big investment boom has waned, Austria still has the potential to attract EU firms seeking convenient access to these developing markets.

== Mergers and acquisitions ==

The mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) landscape in Austria has witnessed significant activity, with companies and investors from the country actively engaging in such transactions. Since 1991, more than 7,183 M&amp;A deals have been announced, amounting to a known total value of 261.6 billion EUR. In 2017 alone, there were over 245 deals with a combined value exceeding 12.9 billion EUR.

Austrian companies have not only been involved in domestic M&amp;A transactions but have also emerged as important investors in cross-border M&amp;A ventures. Among the countries where Austrian companies have been active in M&amp;A, Germany stands out as a particularly crucial partner. To date, Austrian parent companies have acquired 854 German companies in outbound M&amp;A deals, highlighting the strong bilateral ties between the two nations.

When analyzing the industries that have witnessed the most M&amp;A activity in Austria, the financial sector emerges as a prominent player in terms of transaction value. The financial industry has been the focus of significant M&amp;A deals, with companies in this sector exploring opportunities to strengthen their market positions, expand their product portfolios, and enhance their capabilities.

On the other hand, when considering the number of transactions, the Industrials sector takes the lead, representing approximately 19.2% of the total M&amp;A deals in Austria. This sector encompasses a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, engineering, construction, and transportation, among others. The strong presence of M&amp;A activity in the Industrials sector signifies the ongoing interest in consolidating businesses, driving synergies, and fostering growth through strategic partnerships and acquisitions.

The M&amp;A landscape in Austria continues to evolve, influenced by various factors such as market dynamics, economic conditions, and global trends. As companies seek opportunities for expansion, diversification, and innovation, M&amp;A transactions will remain a strategic tool for achieving their business objectives. The financial sector and the Industrials sector are likely to remain at the forefront of M&amp;A activity, demonstrating the vibrancy and potential for further growth in these industries.

== Data ==
The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2021 (with IMF staff estimtates in 2022–2027). Inflation under 5% is in green.
===Companies===
In 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in Austria is Services with 97,733 companies followed by Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate and Retail Trade with 70,696 and 59,942 companies respectively.

The Austrian Armed Forces () are the combined military forces of Austria.

The military consists of 16,000 active-duty personnel and 125,600 reservists. The military budget is 1.0% of national GDP (including pensions) or €3.317 billion (2023,without pensions).

== History ==
=== Interwar ===
In 1918, the Republic of German-Austria established a military known as the (&quot;People&#x27;s Defence&quot;). &quot;Volkswehr&quot; forces took part in military confrontations with Royal Yugoslav Army troops which occupied parts of Carinthia that Austria claimed as its own. In 1920, after the Republic of German-Austria transitioned into the First Austrian Republic, the new regime changed the military&#x27;s name to the (&quot;Federal Army&quot;), which it has been known by ever since. In 1938, officers led by Alfred Jansa developed a military operation plan to defend against a potential invasion by Nazi Germany, which ultimately went unused due to a lack of political willpower when Austria was annexed by the Germans in the same year during the &quot;Anschluss&quot;. Under German rule, the was disbanded, and many Austrians served during World War II in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;.

World War II role of the &quot;Bundesheer&quot;:
*Elements of Austrian Army became 9th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht) 
*Elements of Austrian Army became 44th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)
*4th Austrian Division became the 45th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)
*5th and 7th Austrian Divisions became the 3rd Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)
*6th Austrian Division became the 2nd Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)

In 1955, Austria issued its Declaration of Neutrality, meaning that it would never join a military alliance. The Austrian Armed Forces&#x27; main purpose since then has been the protection of Austria&#x27;s neutrality. Its relationship with NATO is limited to the Partnership for Peace programme.

With the end of the Cold War, the Austrian military have increasingly assisted the border police in controlling the influx of undocumented migrants through Austrian borders. The war in the neighbouring Balkans resulted in the lifting of the restrictions on the range of weaponry of the Austrian military that had been imposed by the Austrian State Treaty.

===Cold War===
On 1 March 1978, the &quot;Wehrgesetz 1978&quot; became law, which encompassed the &quot;Heeresgliederung 1978&quot; plan to grow the Austrian Armed Forces to 384,000 (84,000 active, 300,000 militia) by the early 1990s to be able to fully employ the Austrian concept. A total of 30 new Landwehrstammregimenter were to be raised. On 6 October 1987, the Austrian government enacted the &quot;Heeresgliederung 1987&quot;, which instructed the armed forces to stop the growth of the militia at 200,000. Afterwards only the militia&#x27;s infantry grew, making 1988-1989 the timeframe Austria&#x27;s armed forces reached their maximum strength. On 29 May 1990 the &quot;Wehrgesetz 1978&quot; was cancelled and the army began to shrink, which accelerated with the &quot;Gesamte Rechtsvorschrift für Wehrgesetz 1990&quot; ( of 31.12.1992).

==== Raumverteidigung ====
NATO&#x27;s Central Army Group in Southern Germany was arrayed against attacks from East Germany and Czechoslovakia, with only the German Army&#x27;s 10th Panzer Division available to cover the army group&#x27;s Austrian flank. To strengthen the flank NATO would have deployed the French Army&#x27;s II Corps, which would have required seven days for mobilization and approach. The arrival of Warsaw Pact forces in southern Bavaria within the first six days after the start of hostilities would have prompted NATO to use tactical nuclear weapons to block the enemy approach routes through Upper Austria. To prevent the use of tactical nuclear weapons on Austrian territory the Austrian military developed the Raumverteidigung (Area Defense) concept, which envisioned that Austrian forces would delay, harass and decimate Warsaw Pact forces with determined, sustained and costly resistance along their expected axis of advance.

===== Strategic considerations =====
The Austrian military assumed that Warsaw Pact forces would include Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Army, Hungarian People&#x27;s Army, and Soviet Army units. A mixed Czechoslovak-Soviet corps of three divisions was expected to mass in the Břeclav-Brno-Znojmo region and attack through the Weinviertel north of Vienna. The expected crossing of the Danube was expected to occur between Tulln and Krems, from where the enemy forces would have turned West to reach the Sankt Pölten area. In parallel the 5th Hungarian Army, consisting of Hungarian units, Soviet Central Group of Forces and Southern Group of Forces units, and Czechoslovak units based in Slovakia was expected to strike from Sopron through the Wiener Wald towards Sankt Pölten.

After taking Sankt Pölten the Austrian armed forces expected the combined Warsaw Pact forces to strike West to take possession of the Linz-Steyr-Wels, supported by an advance of two Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Army divisions through the Mühlviertel to the North of Linz. After taking possession of the Linz basin the Warsaw Pact attack would have continued into Bavaria. The Austrian military also expected an advance by up to three Hungarian People&#x27;s Army divisions, supported by Romanian People&#x27;s Army units, into Styria and across the Soboth Pass and Pack Saddle towards Klagenfurt and Villach, from where the Eastern forces could turn South towards the Italian Army&#x27;s 5th Army Corps or West towards the Italian 4th Alpine Army Corps.

While it was imagined that NATO troops could likewise use Austria as a stepping stone for invasions of the Warsaw Pact countries, such a scenario was considered highly unlikely, unrealistic and eventually remained theoretical in strategic realization.

===== Initial dispositions =====
In 1978 the Austrian Armed Forces enacted its new concept of Raumverteidigung. The Raumverteidigung divided the entire nation into Key Zones (Schlüsselzonen), Area Security Zones (Raumsicherungszonen), and Subzones (Teilzonen). Key zones were set up in those areas of the national territory, which an aggressor had to take possession of in order to achieve his military goals. Area security zones were set up to deny an aggressor the possibility to bypass key zones and prevent the massing, movement, supply, and maintenance of enemy units. Operationally the aim was to block the direct march lines through layered defenses in the key zones and to prevent an aggressor from freely using the space in the area security zones through mobile warfare. Both types of zones were to be defended by militia formations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keusch/Halbartschlager&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The four subzones formed the Central Area in Austria&#x27;s mountainous interior, which was outside of the anticipated main axis of a Warsaw Pact advance. In the event of an attack and an occupation of most of Austria, one or more the sub zones would form the national territory, which would justify the continuation of Austria as a subject of international law. The central area was therefore of essential importance and had to be defended at its entrances. The Army Command and Austrian government would have retreat to a bunker complex in St Johann im Pongau in the central area. Furthermore, the central area acted as main depot of Austria&#x27;s war stocks. The capital Vienna would not have been defended and was therefore excluded from defense preparations.

Geographically the country was divided into 34 areas:

* 10 Key zones
* 19 Area security zones
* 1 reinforced key area designated Block Zone 33 (Sperrzone 33)
* 4 Sub zones / Central Area

Each key zone and area security zone, and Block Zone 33 were overseen during peacetime by a Landwehrstammregiment, which were tasked with training the militia forces needed for the defense of their assigned zone. The Landwehrstammregiments consisted of a staff company, training companies, a supply train, and mobilization depots. Some of the Landwehrstammregiment also trained and fielded an active Jäger battalion. In case of war the Landwehrstammregiments would have reformed as Landwehr Regiments with various types of militia battalions and companies, allowing the regiments to fight delaying actions from fortified positions as well has hit and run attacks on enemy formations trying to pass through their zone. The Landwehr regiments formed the area-bound Landwehr and fielded the following types of Landwehr units:

* Landwehr battalions (Landwehrbataillone) tasked with defending their zone
* Blocking battalions and companies (Sperrbataillone and Sperrkompanien) tasked to man more than 500 bunkers and fortified positions
* Jagdkampf battalions and companies (Jagdkampfbataillone and Jagdkampfkompanien) tasked to fight behind enemy lines and disrupt enemy supply lines
* River-blocking companies (Flusssperrkompanien) tasked with blocking river fords
* Guard companies (Wachkompanien) tasked to guard key infrastructure
* Guard-blocking companies (Wachsperrkompanien) tasked to guard and defend key transport infrastructure, and to prevent the enemy from capturing it
* Stationary artillery batteries (Artilleriebatterie ortsfest) with M2 155mm howitzers in bunkers to lay suppressing fire on enemy approach routes

Operationally the country was divided initially into three operational areas (Operationsraum), which were commanded by the Army Command.

* Operational Area East under Corps Command I, in Graz, encompassing the states of Vienna, Burgenland, Steiermark and Lower Austria, the latter without Key Zone 35
* Operational Area Center under Corps Command II, in Salzburg, encompassing the states of Kärnten, Salzburg and Upper Austria, Key Zone 35, and East Tyrol
* Operational Area West under Military Command Tyrol, in Innsbruck, encompassing the states of Tyrol (without East Tyrol) and Vorarlberg (later merged into Operational Area Center)

The Air Division and army&#x27;s support troops were under direct Army Command. In wartime the operational commands would command nine brigades, which formed the mobile Landwehr. The mobile Landwehr was the Austrian armed forces reserve, which once the intentions of the opponent were determined, could be used to counterattack enemy formations. The mobile Landwehr consisted of six light Jäger brigades, which would only be fully manned during wartime, and three Panzergrenadier brigades, equipped with main battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, which were fully manned at all times. The staffs of the six Jäger brigades would have been formed upon war by the armed forces military commands, which in peacetime had territorial functions in the states. The three Panzergrenadier brigades were assigned to the 1st Panzergrenadier Division and based along the Danube valley from Vienna to Linz.

===== Raumverteidigung Organization =====
Each Austrian military command was numbered from 1 to 9, with all zones and units assigned to the command or part of the command starting with the same number. The only exception was the 9th Panzergrenadier Brigade, which carried the number of the Vorarlberg Military Command in the extreme West of the country, but was based near Vienna in the East of the country and manned by conscripts from Vienna. The Austrian military commands of the Raumverteidigung concept, their assigned number, zones and main units during peacetime were:

Under the area defence strategy, which determined the army&#x27;s structure until 1993, the army was divided into three principal elements: the standing alert force () of active units, including the 1st Panzergrenadier Division and the air division; the mobile militia (), organized as eight mechanized reserve brigades to be deployed to key danger spots in the event of mobilization; and the stationary militia () of twenty-six reserve infantry regiments organized for territorial defence. Both the mobile militia and the stationary militia were brought up to strength only in times of mobilization or during periods allotted for refresher training, usually three weeks in June. Training of conscripts was conducted by twenty-eight training and equipment-holding regiments (). On mobilization, these regiments would disband, with their cadre reassigned to lead reserve units or form replacement regiments and battalions.

At the army level were a headquarters, guard, and special forces battalions and an artillery battalion at cadre strength. Two corps headquarters, one in the east at Graz and one in the west at Salzburg, would, on mobilization, command the provincially organized units in their respective zones. Each corps included artillery, antitank, antiaircraft, and engineering battalions, and a logistics regiment, all on a cadre basis.

Each of the nine provincial military commands supervised the training and maintenance activities of their training and equipment-holding regiments. On mobilization, these nine commands would convert to a divisional headquarters commanding mobile militia, stationary militia, and other independent units.

The only active units immediately available in an emergency were those of the standing alert force of some 15,000 career soldiers supplemented by eight-month conscripts. The force was organized as a mechanized division consisting of three armored infantry brigades. Each brigade was composed of one tank battalion, one mechanized infantry battalion, and one self-propelled artillery battalion. Two of the brigades had antitank battalions equipped with self-propelled weapons. The divisional headquarters was at Baden bei Wien near Vienna; the 3rd, 4th, and 9th Brigades were based in separate locations, also in the northeast of the country. 3rd Brigade was at Mautern an der Donau, 4th at Linz, and 9th Brigade at Götzendorf an der Leitha.

===Post-Cold War===

The New Army Structure—the reorganization plan announced in late 1991 and scheduled to be in place sometime in 1995—replaces the previous two-corps structure with one of three corps. The new corps is headquartered at Baden, with responsibility for the two northeastern provinces of Lower Austria and Upper Austria. Army headquarters will be eliminated, as will the divisional structure for the three standing brigades. The three corps—in effect, regional commands—will be directly subordinate to the general troop inspector. The three mechanized brigades will be placed directly under the new Third Corps at Baden, although in the future one brigade may be assigned to each of the three corps. The mobile militia will be reduced from eight to six mechanized brigades. Each of the nine provincial commands will have at least one militia regiment of two to six battalions as well as local defence companies.

Total personnel strength—both standing forces and reserves—is to be materially contracted under the new plan. The fully mobilized army will decline in strength from 200,000 to 120,000. The standing alert force will be reduced from 15,000 to 10,000. Reaction time is to be radically shortened so that part of the standing alert force can be deployed within hours to a crisis zone (for example, one adjacent to the border with Slovenia). A task force ready for immediate deployment will be maintained by one of the mechanized brigades on a rotational basis. Separate militia training companies to which all conscripts are assigned will be dismantled; in the future, conscripts will undergo basic training within their mobilization companies. Conscripts in the final stages of their training could supplement the standing forces by being poised for operational deployment at short notice.

Promotion is not based solely on merit but on position attained, level of education, and seniority. Officers with advanced degrees (for which study at the National Defence Academy qualifies) can expect to attain grade VIII before reaching the retirement age of sixty to sixty-five. Those with a baccalaureate degree can expect to reach grade VII (colonel). Career NCOs form part of the same comprehensive personnel structure. It is common for NCOs to transfer at some stage in their careers to civilian status at the equivalent grade, either in the Ministry for National Defence or in the police or prison services after further training.

==== Strong Europe Tank Challenge 2017 ====
Austria took first place in the Strong Europe Tank Challenge 2017 as six nations and partner nations battled it out in Grafenwoehr, Germany. The Austrian tankers defeated teams from France, Germany, Poland, Ukraine and from the United States in the exercise. The Austrian soldiers used Leopard 2A4 tanks during the competition.

==== 2019 Uniform changes ====
Since 2019 the new service uniform with a six colour camouflage pattern is issued, but the old service uniform in olive is still widespread and will be taken out of service very slowly. The dress uniform is grey; for formal occasions a white uniform may be worn. The air force uniform is identical, with the addition of wings worn on the right jacket breast—gold for officers and silver for enlisted personnel. Branches of service are identified by beret colours: scarlet for the honour Guard; green for infantry; black for armour; cherry for airborne; and dark blue for quartermaster. Insignia of rank are worn on the jacket lapel of the dress uniform (silver stars on a green or gold shield) and on the epaulets of the field uniform (white, silver or gold stars on an olive drab field).

== Organization ==

The armed forces consist solely of the army, of which the air force is considered a constituent part. In 1993, the total active complement of the armed forces was 52,000, of whom 20,000 to 30,000 were conscripts undergoing training of six to eight months. The army had 46,000 personnel on active duty (including an estimated 19,500 conscripts), and the air force had 6,000 personnel (2,400 conscripts).

=== Governance ===



Under the constitution, the President is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. In reality, the Chancellor has the decision-making authority, exercised through the Minister for National Defence. The Chancellor also chairs the National Defence Council, which has as its members a vice-chairman, the minister for national defence, an appointee of this minister, the Chief of the General Staff, and a parliamentary representative. The minister for national defence, acting in co-operation with the minister for interior, coordinates the work of the four major committees under the National Defence Council: the Military Defence Committee; the Civil Defence Committee; the Economic Defence Committee; and the Psychological Defence Committee. The Chief of the General Staff acts as the senior military adviser to the Minister for National Defence, assists the minister in the exercise of his authority, and, as the head of the general staff, is responsible for planning. However, the army commander exercises direct operational control of the Bundesheer in both peacetime and wartime.

Article 79 of the constitution, as amended in 1985, states that the Army is entrusted with the military defence of the country. Insofar as the legally constituted civil authority requests its co-operation, the army is further charged with protecting constitutional institutions and their capacity to act, as well as the democratic freedoms of the inhabitants; maintaining order and security in the interior; and rendering aid in disasters and mishaps of extraordinary scope. In administering the armed forces, the Ministry for National Defence is organized into four principal sections and the inspectorate general: Section I deals with legal and legislative matters; Section II handles personnel and recruitment matters, including discipline and grievances; Section III is concerned with troop command, schools, and other facilities, and it also comprises departments G-1 through G-5 as well as a separate department for air operations; and Section IV deals with procurement and supply, quartermaster matters, armaments, and ordnance.

The general troop inspectorate is a separate section of the ministry with responsibility for co-ordination and fulfilment of the missions of the armed forces. It encompasses a general staff department, an attaché department, and planning and inspection groups.

=== Mission ===
The main constitutional tasks of today&#x27;s Austrian military are:
* to protect the constitutionally established institutions and the population&#x27;s democratic freedoms.
* to maintain order and security inside the country.
* to render assistance in the case of natural catastrophes and disasters of exceptional magnitude.

=== Ranks ===

Of the eight enlisted ranks, only a sergeant (Wachtmeister) or above is considered an NCO. There are two warrant officer ranks—Offiziersstellvertreter and Vizeleutnant. The lowest commissioned rank of officer candidate (Fähnrich)—is held by cadets at the military academy and by reserve officers in training for the rank second lieutenant. To maintain conformity with grade levels in the civil service, there are only two ranks of general in the personnel system—brigadier general (one star) and general lieutenant (three stars). However, the ranks of major general (two stars) and full general (equivalent to four stars) are accorded to officers holding particular military commands.

==Branches==

=== Unit locations ===
=== Air Force ===
Austria&#x27;s air force () has as its missions the defence of Austrian airspace, tactical support of Austrian ground forces, reconnaissance and military transport, and search-and-rescue support when requested by civil authorities.

Until 1985, when the first of twenty-four Saab 35 Draken were delivered, the country had remained essentially without the capacity to contest violations of its airspace. The Drakens, reconditioned after having served the Swedish Air Force since the early 1960s, were armed, in accordance with the restrictions on missiles in the State Treaty of 1955, only with a cannon. However, following Austria&#x27;s revised interpretation of its obligations under the treaty, a decision was made in 1993 to procure AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. The first of these missiles were purchased from Swedish air force inventory, while later a higher performance model was acquired directly from the United States, with deliveries commencing in 1995. French Mistral surface-to-air missiles systems were purchased to add ground-based protection against air attack. The first of the systems arrived in Austria in 1993; final deliveries concluded in 1996.

The Drakens were retired in 2005 and 12 F-5E Tiger II were leased from Switzerland to avoid a gap in the Austrian air defence capabilities until the first Austrian Eurofighter Typhoon units became operational in 2007. Besides one squadron of 15 Eurofighter Typhoons, the air force has a squadron with 28 Saab 105 trainers, which double as reconnaissance and close air support planes.

The helicopter fleet includes 23 AB 212 helicopters used as light transport. 24 French Alouette III are in service as search-and-rescue helicopters. Furthermore, the air force fields 10 OH-58B Kiowa as light scout helicopters. After Austria had to request assistance from the United States Army, Swiss Air Force, French Air Force, and German Bundeswehr to evacuate survivors after the 1999 Galtür Avalanche a decision was taken to equip the Austrian Air Force with medium-sized transport helicopters. Thus in 2002 Austria acquired 9 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. In 2003 the air force received 3 C-130K Hercules transport aircraft to support the armed forces in their UN peacekeeping and humanitarian activities.

=== Special Operations Forces ===
The Jagdkommando (lit. &quot;Hunting Command&quot;) is the Austrian Armed Forces&#x27; Special Operations group. The duties of this elite unit match those of its foreign counterparts, such as the United States Army Special Forces and British Special Air Service being amongst others counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency. Jagdkommando soldiers are highly trained professionals whose thorough and rigorous training enables them to take over when tasks or situations outgrow the capabilities and specialization of conventional units.

==Conscription, training and reserves==


Until 1971, Austrian males were obligated to serve nine months in the armed forces, followed by four days of active service every two years for training and inspection. In 1971 the period of initial service was reduced to six months, followed by a total of sixty days of refresher training in the reserves. In the early 1990s, about 45,000 conscripts completed their initial military training every year, and 80,000 reservists participated in some form of exercises each year.

Reducing the mobilization strength of the army to 120,000 under the New Army Structure plan is to be accomplished in part by limiting initial training of recruits to six months, followed by reducing the period allotted for refresher training from twenty years to ten years. Each reservist is to receive training over a twelve-day period every second year during his first ten years of reserve duty, generally not extending beyond the time he reaches his mid-thirties. The reduced need for conscripts corresponds to a lower pool of young men because of a declining birth rate. The availability of about 40,000 fit trainees annually in 1993 was expected to fall to barely 30,000 by 2000 and to 26,000 by 2015.

In 2006 conscription was reduced to six months total. Mandatory reserve training was abolished. Since then the army reserve battalions (Miliz) are suffering from a lack of new reservists and are therefore overaging.

Under a 1974 law, conscientious objectors can be assigned work as medical orderlies, or other occupations in lieu of military service. Exemptions from service are liberally granted—in 1992 about 12,000 persons were exempted, a great increase over the 1991 total of 4,500. The increase occurred after a new law, valid only for 1992 and 1993, no longer required young men to present their objections to the military in a credible way. Previously, that had not been the case. In 1990, for example, two young men rejected by the alternate service commission on the grounds that they did not present their beliefs in a credible manner were sentenced to prison terms of three months and one month, respectively.

Conscripts may attain the rank of private first class by the completion of initial training. Those with leadership potential may serve a longer period to obtain noncommissioned officer (NCO) status in the militia. Those volunteering for the career service can, after three to four years, apply to attend the NCO academy and later a senior NCO course to qualify as warrant officers. Both regular and militia officer candidates undergo a one-year program of basic training. After a further three years, regular officer candidates attending the military academy at Wiener Neustadt and militia officer candidates undergoing periodic intensified refresher training qualify as second lieutenants. The reserve obligation of conscripts generally ends by the time they reach their mid-thirties; NCOs and officers usually end their reserve status at a later age depending on their rank and specialization. By the early 1990s, some 1.3 million men had completed their initial service and refresher training obligations and had no further active-duty commitment.

The military personnel system is an integral part of a comprehensive civil service system. The nine officer ranks from officer candidate through general correspond to grades I through IX of the civil service system. The highest grade, IX, may be occupied by a section chief (undersecretary), a career ambassador, or a three-star general. A grade VIII position may be held by a departmental counselor, a career minister, or a brigadier general. Salary levels are the same for both civil and military personnel in the equivalent grades, although various allowances may be added, such as flight pay or hazardous-duty pay.

The system of promotion in the Austrian military, which offers no incentive for early retirement, means that the military is top-heavy with senior officers. The New Army Structure, which is intended to result in many fewer active-duty and reserve commands, compounds the difficulty. Personnel changes can be implemented only gradually, as the surplus of officers shrinks by attrition. In 1991, the army had four officers of general rank, fifty-nine at the rank of brigadier general (one star), 155 colonels, and 254 lieutenant colonels. The education of career officers is conducted at the Maria Theresia Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt, forty-five kilometres south of Vienna, which was founded in 1752. Young men who have completed their university entrance requirements are eligible to compete for places. The three-year course graduated 212 students in 1990. At the National Defence Academy in Vienna, which has a curriculum comparable to those of the National Defence University and the Army War College in the United States, operational and troop commanders of field-grade rank study for three years in preparation for general staff and command positions. The NCO school is located at Enns near Linz. Troop schools provide continuous specialized courses for officers and NCOs in artillery, air defence, armour, combat engineering, communications, and the like.

In 1998 the Austrian government approved women&#x27;s membership in the Austrian Armed Forces. All service branches are open for female volunteers. In a public opinion survey in 1988, about 66 percent of those polled approved of opening the military to voluntary service by women; only nine percent favoured obligatory service.

==Equipment==
The Austrian military has a wide variety of equipment. Recently, Austria has spent considerable amounts of money modernizing its military arsenal. Leopard 2 main battle tanks, Ulan and Pandur infantry fighting vehicles, C-130 Hercules transport planes, S-70 Black Hawk utility helicopters, and Eurofighter Typhoon multi-purpose combat aircraft have been purchased, along with new helicopters to replace the inadequate ones used after the 1999 Galtür Avalanche.

== International operations ==

Currently (2024) there are forces in:
* 
** EUFOR Althea (former SFOR)
** 292 personnel
** since 2 December 2004 under European Union Command
** KFOR (within the MSU until 2013)
** 273 personnel
** UNIFIL
** 175 personnel
** UNTSO
** 4 personnel

** MINURSO
** 4 personnel
== Traditions ==
Some of the traditions of the old Austro-Hungarian Army continue to be carried on in . For example, the most famous regiment in the Bundesheer is the &quot;Hoch und Deutschmeister Regiment&quot;, now known as Jägerbataillon Wien 1 based in &quot;Maria Theresien Kaserne&quot;, named after Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. Also nearly every other regiment of the Bundesheer carries on traditions of the famous Austro-Hungarian regiments like &quot;Kaiserjäger&quot;, &quot;Rainer&quot;, etc.

<doc id="67551" wikidata="Q3123409" url="?curid=67551" title="Geography of the Bahamas">
<text>The Bahamas are a group of about 700 islands and cays in the western Atlantic Ocean, of which only between 30 and 40 are inhabited. The largest of the islands is Andros Island, located north of Cuba and southeast of Florida. The Bimini islands are to its northwest. To the North is the island of Grand Bahama, home to the second-largest city in the country, Freeport. The island of Great Abaco is to its east. In the far south is the island of Great Inagua, the second-largest island in the country. Other notable islands include Eleuthera, Cat Island, San Salvador Island, Acklins, Crooked Island, and Mayaguana. Nassau is the capital and largest city, located on New Providence. The islands have a tropical savannah climate, moderated by the Gulf Stream. The total size is . Due to the many widespread islands it has the 41st largest Exclusive Economic Zone of .

The islands are surface projections of two oceanic Bahama Banks - the Little Bahama Bank and the Great Bahama Bank. The highest point is only above sea level on Cat Island; the island of New Providence, where the capital city of Nassau is located, reaches a maximum elevation of only thirty-seven meters. The land on the Bahamas has a foundation of fossil coral, but much of the rock is oolitic limestone; the stone is derived from the disintegration of coral reefs and seashells. The land is primarily either rocky or mangrove swamp. Low scrub covers much of the surface area. Pineyards are found on four of the northern islands: Grand Bahama, Great Abaco, New Providence, and Andros. On some of the southern islands, low-growing tropical hardwood flourishes. Although some soil is very fertile, it is also very thin. Only a few freshwater lakes and just one river, located on Andros Island, are found in the Bahamas.

==Climate==

The climate of the Bahama islands is mostly tropical savanna, with two seasons, a hot and wet summer (wet season) and dry winter (dry season).

During the wet season, which extends from May through October, the climate is dominated by warm, moist tropical air masses as the Bermuda High brings a southeasterly flow from the deep tropics. Daily high temperatures are in the range, with a dew point temperatures in the range, creating the typical hot and sultry island weather. Brief but intense thundershowers are common with thunder and lightning. In the wet season, tropical storms and weak tropical lows may also contribute to the seasonal rainfall.

In the dry season, extending from November through April, the subtropical high retreats, and a mix of drier northeast trade winds and occasional westerlies coming down from the North American mainland impact the Bahamas. Sunny, arid conditions prevail in the Bahamas in the dry season, and at times drought conditions can impact farming and agriculture. High temperatures during the dry season are in the range.

Annual rainfall averages and is usually concentrated in the May–June and September–October periods. Rainfall often occurs in short-lived, fairly intense, but brief thundershowers accompanied by strong gusty winds, followed by a return to clear skies.

Winds are predominantly easterly throughout the year but tend to become northeasterly from October to April and southeasterly from May to September. These winds seldom exceed twenty-four kilometres per hour except during hurricane season. Although the hurricane season officially lasts from June to November, most hurricanes in the Bahamas occur between July and October. The strongest storm to strike the country was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, until Hurricane Dorian struck in 2019. Damage was estimated at US$250 million and mainly affected agricultural products.

The most intense hurricane to strike the Bahamas was Hurricane Dorian in 2019, with wind gusts of up to being recorded. 84 people died (74 of which were from the Bahamas), and there was catastrophic damage to buildings, homes, and boats, and sometimes complete destruction. Preliminary damage estimates are in the US$7 billion range.



=== Climate change ===
Climate change is causing temperature increases in the Bahamas. The average temperature has increased by approximately 0.5 °C since 1960. The rate of the temperature increase varies seasonally, with average daily maximum temperatures for July recently increasing at a rate of 2.6 °C per 100 years. Global temperature rise of 2 °C above preindustrial levels can increase the likelihood of extreme hurricane rainfall by four to five times in the Bahamas. The IPCC expects the 20-year average global temperature to exceed +1.5 °C in the early 2030s.

The Bahamas is expected to be highly affected by sea level rise because at least 80% of the total land is below 10 meters elevation. As a small island developing state, the Bahamas is vulnerable to escalating disease outbreaks, and climate change could affect the seasonality of outbreaks and transmission of disease.

Although the country&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions are comparatively small (2.94 million tonnes of green house gases emitted in 2023), the Bahamas is reliant on imported fossil fuels for energy generation. The government plans to increase solar energy capacity to 30% of the country&#x27;s total energy production by 2033. The Bahamas has pledged to reduce its emissions by 30% by 2030, if international support is received.

<text>An invasive species is an introduced species that harms its new environment. Invasive species adversely affect habitats and bioregions, causing ecological, environmental, and/or economic damage. The term can also be used for native species that become harmful to their native environment after human alterations to its food web. Since the 20th century, invasive species have become serious economic, social, and environmental threats worldwide.

Invasion of long-established ecosystems by organisms is a natural phenomenon, but human-facilitated introductions have greatly increased the rate, scale, and geographic range of invasion. For millennia, humans have served as both accidental and deliberate dispersal agents, beginning with their earliest migrations, accelerating in the Age of Discovery, and accelerating again with international trade. Notably invasive plant species include the kudzu vine, giant hogweed, Japanese knotweed, and yellow starthistle. Notably invasive animals include European rabbits, domestic cats, and carp.

== Terminology ==
Invasive species are the subset of established non-native alien or naturalized species that are a threat to native species and biodiversity. The term &quot;invasive&quot; is poorly defined and often very subjective. Invasive species may be plants, animals, fungi, and microbes; some include native species that have invaded human habitats such as farms and landscapes. Some broaden the term to include indigenous or &quot;native&quot; species that have colonized natural areas. Some sources name &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; as an invasive species, but broad appreciation of human learning capacity and their behavioral potential and plasticity may argue against any such fixed categorization. The definition of &quot;native&quot; can be controversial. For example, the ancestors of &quot;Equus ferus&quot; (modern horses) evolved in North America and radiated to Eurasia before becoming extinct in North America. Upon being introduced to North America in 1493 by Spanish conquistadors, it is debatable whether the feral horses were native or exotic to the continent of their evolutionary ancestors.

While invasive species can be studied within many subfields of biology, most research on invasive organisms has been in ecology and biogeography. Much of the work has been influenced by Charles Elton&#x27;s 1958 book &quot;The Ecology of Invasion by Animals and Plants&quot; which creates a generalized picture of biological invasions. Studies remained sparse until the 1990s. This research, largely field observational studies, has disproportionately been concerned with terrestrial plants. The rapid growth of the field has driven a need to standardize the language used to describe invasive species and events. Despite this, little standard terminology exists; the field lacks any official designation but is commonly referred to as &quot;invasion ecology&quot; or more generally &quot;invasion biology&quot;. This lack of standard terminology has arisen due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field which borrows terms from disciplines such as agriculture, zoology, and pathology, as well as due to studies being performed in isolation.

In an attempt to avoid the ambiguous, subjective, and pejorative vocabulary that so often accompanies discussion of invasive species even in scientific papers, Colautti and MacIsaac proposed a new nomenclature system based on biogeography rather than on taxa. By discarding taxonomy, human health, and economic factors, this model focused only on ecological factors. The model evaluated individual populations rather than entire species. It classified each population based on its success in that environment. This model applied equally to indigenous and to introduced species, and did not automatically categorize successful introductions as harmful.

The USDA&#x27;s National Invasive Species Information Center defines invasive species very narrowly. According to Executive Order 13112, Invasive species&#x27; means an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health.&quot;

== Causes ==
Typically, an introduced species must survive at low population densities before it becomes invasive in a new location. At low population densities, it can be difficult for the introduced species to reproduce and maintain itself in a new location, so a species might reach a location multiple times before it becomes established. Repeated patterns of human movement, such as ships sailing to and from ports or cars driving up and down highways, offer repeated opportunities for establishment (a high propagule pressure). 

=== Ecosystem-based mechanisms ===
In ecosystems, the availability of resources determines the impact of additional species on the ecosystem. Stable ecosystems have a resource equilibrium, which can be changed fundamentally by the arrival of invasive species. When changes such as a forest fire occur, normal ecological succession favors native grasses and forbs. An introduced species that can spread faster than natives can outcompete native species for food, squeezing them out. Nitrogen and phosphorus are often the limiting factors in these situations. Every species occupies an ecological niche in its native ecosystem; some species fill large and varied roles, while others are highly specialized. Invading species may occupy unused niches, or create new ones. For example, edge effects describe what happens when part of an ecosystem is disturbed, as in when land is cleared for agriculture. The boundary between the remaining undisturbed habitat and the newly cleared land itself forms a distinct habitat, creating new winners and losers and possibly hosting species that would not thrive outside the boundary habitat.

In 1958, Charles S. Elton claimed that ecosystems with higher species diversity were less subject to invasive species because fewer niches remained unoccupied. Other ecologists later pointed to highly diverse, but heavily invaded ecosystems, arguing that ecosystems with high species diversity were more susceptible to invasion. This debate hinged on the spatial scale of invasion studies. Small-scale studies tended to show a negative relationship between diversity and invasion, while large-scale studies tended to show the reverse, perhaps a side-effect of invasives&#x27; ability to capitalize on increased resource availability and weaker species interactions that are more common when larger samples are considered. However, this pattern does not seem to hold true for invasive vertebrates.

Island ecosystems may be more prone to invasion because their species face few strong competitors and predators, and because their distance from colonizing species populations makes them more likely to have &quot;open&quot; niches. For example, native bird populations on Guam have been decimated by the invasive brown tree snake. 

In New Zealand the first invasive species were the dogs and rats brought by Polynesian settlers around 1300. These and other introductions devastated endemic New Zealand species. The colonization of Madagascar brought similar harm to its ecosystems. Logging has caused harm directly by destroying habitat, and has allowed non-native species such as prickly pear and silver wattle to invade. The water hyacinth forms dense mats on water surfaces, limiting light penetration and hence harming aquatic organisms, and causing substantial management costs. The shrub lantana (&quot;Lantana camara&quot;) is now considered invasive in over 60 countries, and has invaded large geographies in several countries prompting aggressive federal efforts at attempting to control it. 

Primary geomorphological effects of invasive plants are bioconstruction and bioprotection. For example, kudzu (&quot;Pueraria montana&quot;), a vine native to Asia, was widely introduced in the southeastern United States in the early 20th century to control soil erosion. The primary geomorphological effects of invasive animals are bioturbation, bioerosion, and bioconstruction. For example, invasions of the Chinese mitten crab (&quot;Eriocheir sinensis&quot;) have resulted in higher bioturbation and bioerosion rates.

A native species can become harmful and effectively invasive to its native environment after human alterations to its food web. This has been the case with the purple sea urchin (&quot;Strongylocentrotus purpuratus&quot;), which has decimated kelp forests along the northern California coast due to overharvesting of its natural predator, the California sea otter (&quot;Enhydra lutris&quot;).

===Species-based mechanisms===

Invasive species appear to have specific traits or specific combinations of traits that allow them to outcompete native species. In some cases, the competition is about rates of growth and reproduction. In other cases, species interact with each other more directly. One study found that 86% of invasive species could be identified from such traits alone. Another study found that invasive species often had only a few of the traits, and that noninvasive species had these also. Common invasive species traits include fast growth and rapid reproduction, such as vegetative reproduction in plants; association with humans; and prior successful invasions. Domestic cats are effective predators; they have become feral and invasive in places such as the Florida Keys.

An introduced species might become invasive if it can outcompete native species for resources. If these species evolved under great competition or predation, then the new environment may host fewer able competitors, allowing the invader to proliferate. Ecosystems used to their fullest capacity by native species can be modeled as zero-sum systems, in which any gain for the invader is a loss for the native. However, such unilateral competitive superiority (and extinction of native species with increased populations of the invader) is not the rule. 

An invasive species might be able to use resources previously unavailable to native species, such as deep water accessed by a long taproot, or to live on previously uninhabited soil types. For example, barbed goatgrass was introduced to California on serpentine soils, which have low water-retention, low nutrient levels, a high magnesium/calcium ratio, and possible heavy metal toxicity. Plant populations on these soils tend to show low density, but goatgrass can form dense stands on these soils and crowd out native species.

Invasive species might alter their environment by releasing chemical compounds, modifying abiotic factors, or affecting the behaviour of herbivores, impacting on other species. Some, like &quot;Kalanchoe daigremontana&quot;, produce allelopathic compounds that inhibit competitors. Others like &quot;Stapelia gigantea&quot; facilitate the growth of seedlings of other species in arid environments by providing appropriate microclimates and preventing herbivores from eating seedlings.

Changes in fire regimens are another form of facilitation. &quot;Bromus tectorum&quot;, originally from Eurasia, is highly fire-adapted. It spreads rapidly after burning, and increases the frequency and intensity of fires by providing large amounts of dry detritus during the fire season in western North America. Where it is widespread, it has altered the local fire regimen so much that native plants cannot survive the frequent fires, allowing it to become dominant in its introduced range.

Ecological facilitation occurs where one species physically modifies a habitat in ways advantageous to other species. For example, zebra mussels increase habitat complexity on lake floors, providing crevices in which invertebrates live. This increase in complexity, together with the nutrition provided by the waste products of mussel filter-feeding, increases the density and diversity of benthic invertebrate communities.

Introduced species may spread rapidly and unpredictably. When bottlenecks and founder effects cause a great decrease in the population size and may constrict genetic variation, the individuals begin to show additive variance as opposed to epistatic variance. This conversion can lead to increased variance in the founding populations, which permits rapid evolution. Selection may then act on the capacity to disperse as well as on physiological tolerance to new stressors in the environment, such as changed temperature and different predators and prey. 

Rapid adaptive evolution through intraspecific phenotypic plasticity, pre-adaptation and post-introduction evolution lead to offspring that have higher fitness. Critically, plasticity permits changes to better suit the individual to its environment. Pre-adaptations and evolution after the introduction reinforce the success of the introduced species.

The enemy release hypothesis states that evolution leads to ecological balance in every ecosystem. No single species can occupy a majority of an ecosystem due to the presences of competitors, predators, and diseases. Introduced species moved to a novel habitat can become invasive, with rapid population growth, when these controls do not exist in the new ecosystem.

==Vectors==
Non-native species have many vectors, but most are associated with human activity. Natural range extensions are common, but humans often carry specimens faster and over greater distances than natural forces. An early human vector occurred when prehistoric humans introduced the Pacific rat (&quot;Rattus exulans&quot;) to Polynesia.

Vectors include plants or seeds imported for horticulture. The pet trade moves animals across borders, where they can escape and become invasive. Organisms stow away on transport vehicles. Incidental human assisted transfer is the main cause of introductionsother than for polar regions. Diseases may be vectored by invasive insects: the Asian citrus psyllid carries the bacterial disease citrus greening. The arrival of invasive propagules to a new site is a function of the site&#x27;s invasibility.

Many invasive species, once they are dominant in the area, become essential to the ecosystem of that area, and their removal could be harmful. Economics plays a major role in exotic species introduction. High demand for the valuable Chinese mitten crab is one explanation for the possible intentional release of the species in foreign waters.

=== Within the aquatic environment ===
Maritime trade has rapidly affected the way marine organisms are transported within the ocean; new means of species transport include hull fouling and ballast water transport. In fact, Molnar et al. 2008 documented the pathways of hundreds of marine invasive species and found that shipping was the dominant mechanism for the transfer of invasive species. 

Many marine organisms can attach themselves to vessel hulls. Such organisms are easily transported from one body of water to another, and are a significant risk factor for a biological invasion event. Controlling for vessel hull fouling is voluntary and there are no regulations currently in place to manage hull fouling. However, the governments of California and New Zealand have announced more stringent control for vessel hull fouling within their respective jurisdictions.

Another vector of non-native aquatic species is ballast water taken up at sea and released in port by transoceanic vessels. Some 10,000 species are transported via ballast water each day. Many of these are harmful. For example, freshwater zebra mussels from Eurasia most likely reached the Great Lakes via ballast water. These outcompete native organisms for oxygen and food, and can be transported in the small puddle left in a supposedly empty ballast tank. Regulations attempt to mitigate such risks, not always successfully. 

Climate change is causing an increase in ocean temperature. This in turn will cause range shifts in organisms, which could harm the environment as new species interactions occur. For example, organisms in a ballast tank of a ship traveling from the temperate zone through tropical waters may experience temperature fluctuations as much as 20 °C. Heat challenges during transport may enhance the stress tolerance of species in their non-native range, by selecting for genotypes that will survive a second applied heat stress, such as increased ocean temperature in the founder population.

=== Effects of wildfire and firefighting ===
Invasive species often exploit disturbances to an ecosystem (wildfires, roads, foot trails) to colonize an area. Large wildfires can sterilize soils, while adding nutrients. 
Invasive plants that can regenerate from their roots then have an advantage over natives that rely on seeds for propagation.

==Adverse effects==
Invasive species can affect the invaded habitats and bioregions adversely, causing ecological, environmental, or economic damage.

===Ecological===
The European Union defines &quot;Invasive Alien Species&quot; as those that are outside their natural distribution area, and that threaten biological diversity. Biotic invasion is one of the five top drivers for global biodiversity loss, and is increasing because of tourism and globalization. This may be particularly true in inadequately regulated fresh water systems, though quarantines and ballast water rules have improved the situation.

Invasive species may drive local native species to extinction via competitive exclusion, niche displacement, or hybridisation with related native species. Therefore, besides their economic ramifications, alien invasions may result in extensive changes in the structure, composition and global distribution of the biota at sites of introduction, leading ultimately to the homogenisation of the world&#x27;s fauna and flora and the loss of biodiversity. It is difficult to unequivocally attribute extinctions to a species invasion, though there is for example strong evidence that the extinction of about 90 amphibian species was caused by the chytrid fungus spread by international trade.

Multiple successive introductions of different non-native species can worsen the total effect, as with the introductions of the amethyst gem clam and the European green crab. The gem clam was introduced into California&#x27;s Bodega Harbor from the US East Coast a century ago. On its own, it never displaced native clams (&quot;Nutricola&quot; spp.). In the mid-1990s, the introduction of the European green crab resulted in an increase of the amethyst gem at the expense of the native clams. In India, multiple invasive plants have invaded 66% of natural areas, reducing the densities of native forage plants, declining the habitat-use by wild herbivores and threatening the long-term sustenance of dependent carnivores, including the tiger.

Invasive species can change the functions of ecosystems. For example, invasive plants can alter the fire regime (cheatgrass, &quot;Bromus tectorum&quot;), nutrient cycling (smooth cordgrass &quot;Spartina alterniflora&quot;), and hydrology (&quot;Tamarix&quot;) in native ecosystems. Invasive species that are closely related to rare native species have the potential to hybridize with the native species. Harmful effects of hybridization have led to a decline and even extinction of native species. For example, hybridization with introduced cordgrass, &quot;Spartina alterniflora&quot;, threatens the existence of California cordgrass (&quot;Spartina foliosa&quot;) in San Francisco Bay. Invasive species cause competition for native species and because of this 400 of the 958 endangered species under the Endangered Species Act are at risk.

The unintentional introduction of forest pest species and plant pathogens can change forest ecology and damage the timber industry. Overall, forest ecosystems in the U.S. are widely invaded by exotic pests, plants, and pathogens.

The Asian long-horned beetle (&quot;Anoplophora glabripennis&quot;) was first introduced into the U.S. in 1996, and was expected to infect and damage millions of acres of hardwood trees. As of 2005 thirty million dollars had been spent in attempts to eradicate this pest and protect millions of trees in the affected regions. The woolly adelgid has inflicted damage on old-growth spruce, fir and hemlock forests and damages the Christmas tree industry. Chestnut blight and Dutch elm disease are plant pathogens with serious impacts. Garlic mustard, &quot;Alliaria petiolata&quot;, is one of the most problematic invasive plant species in eastern North American forests, where it is highly invasive of the understory, reducing the growth rate of tree seedlings and threatening to modify the forest&#x27;s tree composition.

Native species can be threatened with extinction through the process of genetic pollution. Genetic pollution is unintentional hybridization and introgression, which leads to homogenization or replacement of local genotypes as a result of either a numerical or fitness advantage of the introduced species. Genetic pollution occurs either through introduction or through habitat modification, where previously isolated species are brought into contact with the new genotypes. Invading species have been shown to adapt to their new environments in a remarkably short amount of time. The population size of invading species may remain small for a number of years and then experience an explosion in population, a phenomenon known as &quot;the lag effect&quot;.
Hybrids resulting from invasive species interbreeding with native species can incorporate their genotypes into the gene pool over time through introgression. Similarly, in some instances a small invading population can threaten much larger native populations. For example, &quot;Spartina alterniflora&quot; was introduced in the San Francisco Bay and hybridized with native &quot;Spartina foliosa.&quot; The higher pollen count and male fitness of the invading species resulted in introgression that threatened the native populations due to lower pollen counts and lower viability of the native species. Reduction in fitness is not always apparent from morphological observations alone. Some degree of gene flow is normal, and preserves constellations of genes and genotypes. An example of this is the interbreeding of migrating coyotes with the red wolf, in areas of eastern North Carolina where the red wolf was reintroduced, reducing red wolf numbers.

=== Environmental ===
In South Africa&#x27;s Cape Town region, analysis demonstrated that the restoration of priority source water sub-catchments through the removal of thirsty alien plant invasions (such as Australian acacias, pines and eucalyptus, and Australian black wattle) would generate expected annual water gains of 50 billion liters within 5 years compared to the business-as-usual scenario (which is important as Cape Town experiences significant water scarcity). This is the equivalent to one-sixth of the city&#x27;s current supply needs. These annual gains will double within 30 years. The catchment restoration is significantly more cost-effective then other water augmentation solutions (1/10 the unit cost of alternative options). A water fund has been established, and these exotic species are being eradicated.

=== Human health ===
Invasive species can affect human health. With the alteration in ecosystem functionality (due to homogenization of biota communities), invasive species have resulted in negative effects on human well-being, which includes reduced resource availability, unrestrained spread of human diseases, recreational and educational activities, and tourism. Alien species have caused diseases including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), monkey pox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

Invasive species and accompanying control efforts can have long term public health implications. For instance, pesticides applied to treat a particular pest species could pollute soil and surface water. Encroachment of humans into previously remote ecosystems has exposed exotic diseases such as HIV to the wider population. Introduced birds (e.g. pigeons), rodents and insects (e.g. mosquito, flea, louse and tsetse fly pests) can serve as vectors and reservoirs of human afflictions. Throughout recorded history, epidemics of human diseases, such as malaria, yellow fever, typhus, and bubonic plague, spread via these vectors. A recent example of an introduced disease is the spread of the West Nile virus, which killed humans, birds, mammals, and reptiles. The introduced Chinese mitten crabs are carriers of Asian lung fluke. Waterborne disease agents, such as cholera bacteria (&quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;), and causative agents of harmful algal blooms are often transported via ballast water.

=== Economic ===
Globally, invasive species management and control are substantial economic burdens, with expenditures reaching approximately $1.4 trillion annually. The economic impact of invasive alien species alone was estimated to exceed $423 billion annually as of 2019. This cost has exhibited a significant increase, quadrupling every decade since 1970, underscoring the escalating financial implications of these biological invasions.

Invasive species contribute to ecological degradation, altering ecosystem functionality and reducing the services ecosystems provide. This necessitates additional expenditures to control the spread of biological invasions, mitigate further impacts, and restore affected ecosystems. For example, the damage caused by 79 invasive species between 1906 and 1991 in the United States has been estimated at US$120 billion. Similarly, in China, invasive species have been reported to reduce the country&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) by 1.36% per year.

The management of biological invasions can be costly. In Australia, for instance, the expense to monitor, control, manage, and research invasive weed species is approximately AU$116.4 million per year, with costs directed solely to central and local government.

While in some cases, invasive species may offer economic benefits, such as the potential for commercial forestry from invasive trees, these benefits are generally overshadowed by the substantial costs associated with biological invasions. In most cases, the economic returns from invasive species are far less than the costs they impose.

==== United States ====
In the Great Lakes region the sea lamprey is an invasive species. In its original habitat, it had co-evolved as a parasite that did not kill its host. However, in the Great Lakes Region, it acts as a predator and can consume up to 40 pounds of fish in its 12–18 month feeding period. Sea lampreys prey on all types of large fish such as lake trout and salmon. The sea lampreys&#x27; destructive effects on large fish negatively affect the fishing industry and have helped cause the collapse of the population of some species.

Economic costs from invasive species can be separated into direct costs through production loss in agriculture and forestry, and management costs. Estimated damage and control costs of invasive species in the U.S. amount to more than $138 billion annually. Economic losses can occur through loss of recreational and tourism revenues. When economic costs of invasions are calculated as production loss and management costs, they are low because they do not consider environmental damage; if monetary values were assigned to the extinction of species, loss in biodiversity, and loss of ecosystem services, costs from impacts of invasive species would drastically increase. It is often argued that the key to invasive species management is early detection and rapid response. However, early response only helps when the invasive species is not frequently reintroduced into the managed area, and the cost of response is affordable.

Weeds reduce yield in agriculture. Many weeds are accidental introductions that accompany imports of commercial seeds and plants. Introduced weeds in pastures compete with native forage plants, threaten young cattle (e.g., leafy spurge, &quot;Euphorbia virgata&quot;) or are unpalatable because of thorns and spines (e.g., yellow starthistle). Forage loss from invasive weeds on pastures amounts to nearly US$1 billion in the U.S. A decline in pollinator services and loss of fruit production has been caused by honey bees infected by the invasive varroa mite. Introduced rats (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot; and &quot;R. norvegicus&quot;) have become serious pests on farms, destroying stored grains. The introduction of leaf miner flies (Agromyzidae), including the American serpentine leaf miner (&quot;Liriomyza trifolii&quot;), to California has caused losses in California&#x27;s floriculture industry, as the larvae of these invasive species feed on ornamental plants.

Invasive plant pathogens and insect vectors for plant diseases can suppress agricultural yields and harm nursery stock. Citrus greening is a bacterial disease vectored by the invasive Asian citrus psyllid. As a result, citrus is under quarantine and highly regulated in areas where the psyllid has been found.

Invasive species can impact outdoor recreation, such as fishing, hunting, hiking, wildlife viewing, and water-based activities. They can damage environmental services including water quality, plant and animal diversity, and species abundance, though the extent of this is under-researched. Eurasian watermilfoil (&quot;Myriophyllum spicatum&quot;) in parts of the US, fills lakes with plants, complicating fishing and boating. The loud call of the introduced common coqui depresses real estate values in affected neighborhoods of Hawaii. The large webs of the orb-weaving spider &quot;Zygiella x-notata&quot;, invasive in California, disrupts garden work.

==== Europe ====
The overall economic cost of invasive alien species in Europe between 1960 and 2020 has been estimated at around US$140 billion (including potential costs that may or may not have actually materialised) or US$78 billion (only including observed costs known to have materialised). These estimates are very conservative. Models based on these data suggest a true &quot;annual&quot; cost of around US$140 billion in 2020.

 is one of the most invaded countries in Europe, with an estimate of more than 3,000 alien species. The impacts of invasive alien species on the economy has been wide-ranging, from management costs, to loss of crops, to infrastructure damage. The overall economic cost of invasions to Italy between 1990 and 2020 was estimated at US$819.76 million (EUR€704.78 million). However, only 15 recorded species have more reliably estimated costs, hence the actual cost may be much larger than the aforementioned sum.

 has an estimated minimum of 2,750 introduced and invasive alien species. Renault et al. (2021) obtained 1,583 cost records for 98 invasive alien species and found that they caused a conservative total cost between US$1.2 billion and 11.5 billion over the period 1993–2018. This study extrapolated costs for species invading France, but for which costs were reported only in other countries but not in France, which yielded an additional cost ranging from US$151 million to $3.03 billion. Damage costs were nearly eight times higher than management expenditure. Insects, and in particular the Asian tiger mosquito &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot; and the yellow fever mosquito &quot;Ae. aegypti&quot;, totalled very high economic costs, followed by non-graminoid terrestrial flowering and aquatic plants (&quot;Ambrosia artemisiifolia&quot;, &quot;Ludwigia&quot; sp. and &quot;Lagarosiphon major&quot;). Over 90% of alien species currently recorded in France had no costs reported in the literature, resulting in high biases in taxonomic, regional and activity sector coverages. However, no reports does not mean that there are no negative consequences and thus no costs.

==Favorable effects==
The entomologist Chris D. Thomas argues that most introduced species are neutral or beneficial with respect to other species but this is a minority opinion. The scientific community ubiquitously considers their effects on biodiversity to be negative.

Some invasive species can provide a suitable habitat or food source for other organisms. In areas where a native has become extinct or reached a point that it cannot be restored, non-native species can fill their role. For instance, in the US, the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher mainly nests in the non-native tamarisk. 
The introduced mesquite is an aggressive invasive species in India, but is the preferred nesting site of native waterbirds in small cities like Udaipur in Rajasthan. Similarly, Ridgway&#x27;s rail has adapted to the invasive hybrid of &quot;Spartina alterniflora&quot; and &quot;Spartina foliosa&quot;, which offers better cover and nesting habitat. In Australia, saltwater crocodiles, which had become endangered, have recovered by feeding on introduced feral pigs.

Non-native species can act as catalysts for restoration, increasing the heterogeneity and biodiversity in an ecosystem. This can create microclimates in sparse and eroded ecosystems, promoting the growth and reestablishment of native species. For example, in Kenya, guava trees in farmland are attractive to many fruit-eating birds, which drop seeds from rainforest trees as much as away beneath the guavas, encouraging forest regeneration.

Non-native species can provide ecosystem services, functioning as biocontrol agents to limit the effects of invasive agricultural pests. Asian oysters, for example, filter water pollutants better than native oysters in Chesapeake Bay. Some species have invaded an area so long ago that they are considered to have naturalised there. For example, the bee &quot;Lasioglossum leucozonium&quot;, shown by population genetic analysis to be an invasive species in North America, has become an important pollinator of caneberry (&quot;Rubus&quot; spp.) as well as cucurbit, apple trees, and blueberry bushes. In the US, the endangered Taylor&#x27;s checkerspot butterfly has come to rely on invasive ribwort plantain as the food plant for its caterpillars.

Some invasions offer potential commercial benefits. For instance, silver carp and common carp can be harvested for human food and exported to markets already familiar with the product, or processed into pet foods, or mink feed. Water hyacinth can be turned into fuel by methane digesters, and other invasive plants can be harvested and utilized as a source of bioenergy.

== Control, eradication, and study ==
Humans are versatile enough to remediate adverse effects of species invasions. The public is motivated by invasive species that impact their local area. 
The control of alien species populations is important in the conservation of biodiversity in natural ecosystem. One of the most promising methods for controlling alien species is genetic.

=== Cargo inspection and quarantine ===
The original motivation was to protect against agricultural pests while still allowing the export of agricultural products. In 1994 the first set of global standards were agreed to, including the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement). These are overseen by the World Trade Organization. The International Maritime Organization oversees the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships&#x27; Ballast Water and Sediments (the Ballast Water Management Convention). Although primarily targeted at other, more general environmental concerns, the Convention on Biological Diversity does specify some steps that its members should take to control invasive species. The CBD is the most significant international agreement on the environmental consequences of invasive species; most such measures are voluntary and unspecific.

=== Slowing spread ===
Firefighters are becoming responsible for decontamination of their own equipment, public water equipment, and private water equipment, due to the risk of aquatic invasive species transfer. In the United States this is especially a concern for wildland firefighters because quagga and zebra mussel invasion and wildfires co-occur in the American West.

=== Reestablishing species ===
Island restoration deals with the eradication of invasive species. A 2019 study suggests that if eradications of invasive animals were conducted on just 169 islands, the survival prospects of 9.4% of the Earth&#x27;s most highly threatened terrestrial insular vertebrates would be improved.

Invasive vertebrate eradication on islands aligns with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15 and associated targets.

Rodents were carried to South Georgia, an island in the southern Atlantic Ocean with no permanent inhabitants, in the 18th century by sealing and whaling ships. They soon wrought havoc on the island&#x27;s bird population, eating eggs and attacking chicks. In 2018, the South Georgia Island was declared free of invasive rodents after a multi-year extermination effort. Bird populations have rebounded, including the South Georgia pipit and South Georgia pintail, both endemic to the island.

=== Taxon substitution ===
Non-native species can be introduced to fill an ecological engineering role that previously was performed by a native species now extinct. The procedure is known as taxon substitution. On many islands, tortoise extinction has resulted in dysfunctional ecosystems with respect to seed dispersal and herbivory. On the offshore islets of Mauritius, tortoises now extinct had served as the keystone herbivores. Introduction of the non-native Aldabra giant tortoises on two islets in 2000 and 2007 has begun to restore ecological equilibrium. The introduced tortoises are dispersing seeds of several native plants and are selectively grazing invasive plant species. Grazing and browsing are expected to replace ongoing intensive manual weeding, and the introduced tortoises are already breeding.

=== By using them as food ===
The practice of eating invasive species to reduce their populations has been explored. In 2005 Chef Bun Lai of Miya&#x27;s Sushi in New Haven, Connecticut created the first menu dedicated to invasive species. At that time, half the items on the menu were conceptual because those invasive species were not yet commercially available. By 2013, Miya&#x27;s offered invasive aquatic species such as Chesapeake blue catfish, Florida lionfish, Kentucky silver carp, Georgia cannonball jellyfish, and invasive plants such as Japanese knotweed and autumn olive. Joe Roman, a Harvard and University of Vermont conservation biologist and recipient of the Rachel Carson Environmental award, runs a website named &quot;Eat The Invaders&quot;. In the 21st century, organizations including Reef Environmental Educational Foundation and the Institute for Applied Ecology have published cookbooks and recipes using invasive species as ingredients. Invasive plant species have been explored as a sustainable source of beneficial phytochemicals and edible protein.

Proponents of eating invasive organisms argue that humans have the ability to eat away any species that it has an appetite for, pointing to the many animals which humans have been able to hunt to extinction—such as the Caribbean monk seal, and the passenger pigeon. They further point to the success that Jamaica has had in significantly decreasing the population of lionfish by encouraging the consumption of the fish. Skeptics point out that once a foreign species has entrenched itself in a new place—such as the Indo-Pacific lionfish that has now virtually taken over the waters of the Western Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico—eradication is almost impossible. Critics argue that encouraging consumption might have the unintended effect of spreading harmful species even more widely.

===Pesticides and herbicides===
Pesticides are commonly used to control invasives. Herbicides used against invasive plants include fungal herbicides. Although the effective population size of an introduced population is bottlenecked, some genetic variation has been known to provide invasive plants with resistance against these fungal bioherbicides. Invasive populations of &quot;Bromus tectorum&quot; exist with resistance to &quot;Ustilago bullata&quot; used as a biocontrol, and a similar problem has been reported in &quot;Microstegium vimineum&quot; subject to &quot;Bipolaris microstegii&quot; and &quot;B. drechsleri&quot;. This is not solely a character of invasive plant genetics but is normal for wild plants such as the weed &quot;Linum marginale&quot; and its fungal pathogen &quot;Melampsora lini&quot;. Crops have another disadvantage over any uncontrolled plant – wild native or invasive – namely their greater uptake of nutrients, as they are deliberately bred to increase nutrient intake to enable increased product output.

=== Gene drive ===
A gene drive could be used to eliminate invasive species and has, for example, been proposed as a way to eliminate invasive mammal species in New Zealand. Briefly put, an individual of a species may have two versions of a gene, one with a desired coding outcome and one not, with offspring having a 50:50 chance of inheriting one or the other. Genetic engineering can be used to inhibit inheritance of the non-desired gene, resulting in faster propagation of the desired gene in subsequent generations. Gene drives for biodiversity conservation purposes are being explored as part of The Genetic Biocontrol of Invasive Rodents program because they offer the potential for reduced risk to non-target species and reduced costs when compared to traditional invasive species removal techniques. A wider outreach network for gene drive research exists to raise awareness of the value of gene drive research for the public good. Some scientists are concerned that the technique could wipe out species in their original native habitats. The gene could mutate, causing unforeseen problems, or hybridize with native species.

=== Predicting invasive plants ===
Accurately predicting the impacts of non-native plants can be an especially effective management option because most introductions of non-native plant species are intentional. Weed risk assessments attempt to predict the chances that a specific plant will have negative effects in a new environment, often using a standardized questionnaire. The resulting total score is associated with a management action such as &quot;prevent introduction&quot;. Assessments commonly use information about the physiology, life history, native ranges, and phylogenetic relationships of the species evaluated. The effectiveness of the approach is debated.

According to the 2001 book &quot;The Dedalus Book of Absinthe&quot;, it was made by combining gin with a pinch of DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), an insecticide that would later be banned in most countries; consumers of this concoction reportedly claimed that its effects were similar to absinthe.

Due to a lack of documentary evidence, it has been questioned whether this is a modern urban legend rather than a historical reality. As of January 2023, the earliest reference on Newspapers.com to the drink is in the television listing for a 1992 episode of &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, a BBC documentary series.

This beverage should not be confused with the knockout drink known as the Mickey Finn.

== Effects of consumption of DDT by humans ==
In a 2009 study, DDT was linked to various health problems in humans. However, the negative health effects on humans have not always been apparent. &quot;Time Magazine&quot;, reported on August 1, 1971, that Pest Control Executive Robert Loibl and his wife Louise start breakfast with a 10 mg capsule of DDT to demonstrate its safety, doing so for three months in front of witnesses. The well-known British entomologist Kenneth Mellanby often ate small amounts of DDT during his 40 years of lectures. On p. 75 of his 1992 book &quot;The DDT Story&quot;, Mellanby famously wrote:

The entomologist Gordon Edwards also frequently demonstrated DDT consumption, and he appeared in the September 1971 edition of &quot;Esquire magazine&quot; doing so. None of them reported any psychoactive effects of their consumption of DDT.

There have been no reports of this tasteless chemical having any psychoactive effects. The comparison to absinthe basically does not indicate any effect at all (aside from that of the alcohol in the cocktail), since the assumed psychedelic effect of absinthe, that is, the effect of the chemical thujone, has in recent times been revealed to be close to non-existent.

<doc id="67575" wikidata="Q203828" url="?curid=67575" title="Gustave Moreau">
<text>Gustave Moreau (; 6 April 1826 – 18 April 1898) was a French artist and an important figure in the Symbolist movement. Jean Cassou called him &quot;the Symbolist painter par excellence&quot;. He was an influential forerunner of symbolism in the visual arts in the 1860s, and at the height of the symbolist movement in the 1890s, he was among the most significant painters. Art historian Robert Delevoy wrote that Moreau &quot;brought symbolist polyvalence to its highest point in &quot;Jupiter and Semele&quot;.&quot; He was a prolific artist who produced over 15,000 paintings, watercolors, and drawings. Moreau painted allegories and traditional biblical and mythological subjects favored by the fine art academies. J. K. Huysmans wrote, &quot;Gustave Moreau has given new freshness to dreary old subjects by a talent both subtle and ample: he has taken myths worn out by the repetitions of centuries and expressed them in a language that is persuasive and lofty, mysterious and new.&quot; The female characters from the Bible and mythology that he so frequently depicted came to be regarded by many as the archetypical symbolist woman. His art (and symbolism in general) fell from favor and received little attention in the early 20th century but, beginning in the 1960s and 70s, he has come to be considered among the most paramount of symbolist painters.

Gustave Moreau was born in Paris and showed an aptitude for drawing at an early age. He received a sound education at Collège Rollin (now Collège-lycée Jacques-Decour) and traditional academic training in painting at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. In the early 1850s he developed a close friendship/mentorship with Théodore Chassériau and had some modest success exhibiting as the Paris Salon. Chassériau&#x27;s premature death in 1856 deeply affected Moreau, and he left Paris to travel in Italy from 1857 to 1859, returning with hundreds of copies and studies he made of old master paintings there. In 1864 his painting &quot;Oedipus and the Sphinx&quot; received a great deal attention at the Paris Salon, winning a medal and establishing his reputation. He had continued success through the 1860s, gradually gaining a select group of enthusiastic and loyal admirers and collectors. Although his painting &quot;Prometheus&quot; received a medal at the Salon of 1869, criticisms in the press were severe and he did not submit paintings to the Salon again until 1876, permanently withdrawing after 1880.

Moreau was decorated Officier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur in 1883. Somewhat misanthropic, he grew increasingly reclusive in later years, although he maintained a close circle of friends. He was often reluctant to sell his work, seldom exhibited, and turned down a number of prestigious offers, including an invitation to exhibit at the Salon Les XX in Brussels (1887), rejected the post of a professor when he was elected to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts (1888), and rejected offers to decorate buildings at the Sorbonne (1891). It was only after the death of his friend Élie Delaunay in 1891 that he agreed to take over Delaunay&#x27;s studio at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Moreau excelled as a teacher, counting Henri Matisse, Georges Rouault, and other notable artists amongst his pupils. His parents bought a townhouse in 1852 at 14 Rue de La Rochefoucauld, converting the top floor into a studio for Moreau, where he lived and worked, a bachelor, for the rest of his life, his father dying in 1862, and his mother, Adèle-Pauline in 1884. Moreau died of cancer in 1898, bequeathing the townhome and studio with nearly 1200 paintings and watercolors, and over 10,000 drawings to the State to be converted into a museum. The Musée Gustave Moreau opened to the public in 1903 and is still open today. It is by far the largest and most significant collection of his work.

==Biography==
===Education and early career (1826–1856)===

Gustave Moreau was born in Paris, into a cultured, upper-middle-class family. His father, Louis Jean Marie Moreau (1790–1862), was an architect, and his mother, née Adèle Pauline Desmoutier (1802–1884) was a musician. During a turbulent period in French history his father worked for the city of Paris, but being of liberal leanings, he was at times dismissed and later reinstated from various offices as powers shifted. The family lived in Vesoul, France from 1827 to 1830. After the July Revolution of 1830, he was appointed highway commissioner for the city of Paris. Although the office was not highly revered, his duties were more varied than the title suggests and he remained there until he retired in 1858. As a child Moreau was of frail health. Beginning at about the age of eight, he started drawing incessantly. In 1837 he began attending the Collège Rollin (Collège-lycée Jacques-Decour) in Paris as a boarder, but in 1840 when his older sister died at the age of 13, he was withdrawn from the school and lived a somewhat sheltered life with his parents. His father encouraged and supported his artistic tendencies but was adamant that he received a solid classical education. Moreau learned Greek, Latin, and read both French and classical literature in his father&#x27;s rather substantial library. He learned piano and was a very good tenor. In 1841 he visited Italy with his mother and relatives, where he filled a 60-page album with drawings.

Visiting museums and galleries in Italy profoundly impressed Moreau and influenced his resolution to pursue a career as an artist. Upon returning in 1841 he started attending a drawing studio in the evenings. In 1844 he entered the private studio of François-Édouard Picot, a member of the École des Beaux-Arts, who offered classes to aspiring young artists to prepare for the entrance examinations at the École des Beaux-Arts. In 1846 Moreau was admitted to Picot&#x27;s formal class at the École des Beaux-Arts. Moreau had grand aspirations of winning the prestigious Grand Prix de Rome, but when he failed to make the final rounds in 1848 and 1849 he left the École des Beaux-Arts prematurely. His style soon drifted away from those favored by the academy, but many of the basic Beaux-Arts methods and concepts he learned would remain with him for the rest of his life, as would his commitment to history painting.

Moreau spent his time copying paintings in the Louvre and was soon drawn to romanticism. Two contemporary artists he greatly admired were Eugène Delacroix and Théodore Chassériau, both of whom lived and worked in his neighborhood. Chassériau had entered the private studio of the great Neoclassical painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres at the age of ten and later spent time with Ingres at the French Academy in Rome, but in his late teens he turned away from Neoclassicism to Delacroix and romanticism. Chassériau never attended the École des Beaux-Arts, but he was driven and hardworking and managed to establish a reputation for himself, securing commissions, and living a rather bohemian and sometimes turbulent life. Moreau developed a friendship with Chassériau, seven years his senior, and rented a studio near Chassériau&#x27;s. He soon followed suit, becoming something of a dapper man about town during this period, attending the opera and theater, and even singing at the social gatherings he frequented. Anecdotal accounts say Moreau visited Delacroix&#x27;s studio around 1850; he was 28 years older than Moreau, but there is little evidence of a relationship beyond that.

Moreau&#x27;s father bought a townhome at 14 rue de la Rochefoucauld in 1853, converting the top floor into a studio for Moreau, where he and his parents lived for the rest of their lives. Shortly before moving in, Moreau had started an ambitious canvas, &quot;a scene of epic slaughter&quot; based on an episode from the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, titled &quot;The Suitors&quot; (1852–1896). He worked on the painting on and off for the rest of his life, even adding strips of canvas to enlarge the work to a monumental 3.85 x 3.43 meters, but it was still unfinished at the time of his death. Moreau began exhibiting his work with some regularity in the 1850s. He secured some commissions from the city for paintings with the help of his father. He participated in the Paris Salon for the first time in 1852, presenting a &quot;Pieta&quot; which was purchased by the state for 600 francs. In the Salon of 1853 he exhibited &quot;Darius Fleeing after the Battle of Arbela&quot; and &quot;Song of Songs&quot;, both showing some influence of Chassériau, and the latter bought by the state for 2,000 francs for the Dijon Museum. There was no Salon in 1854, although he received a commission from the state in 1854 for &quot;Athenians being Delivered to the Minotaur in the Cretan Labyrinth&quot; which was shown at the 1855 Paris World&#x27;s Fair and purchased for 4,000 francs for the Bourg-en-Bresse Museum. After a few short weeks of declining health in 1856, Chassériau died at the age of 37. On 10 October 1856, Delacroix noted in his journal &quot;Funeral procession of poor Chassériau. I saw Dauzats, Diaz, and the young Moreau. I quite like him&quot; Moreau started work on &quot;The Young Man and Death&quot; in 1856, finished in 1865 and dedicated to Chassériau.

===Early work===
===Italy (1857–1859)===
The death of Chasseriau in 1856 caused Moreau in his grief to withdraw from public life. Concerned about his condition, Moreau&#x27;s parents suggested he travel to Italy again. Living in Italy, he found a renewed love for art. He gained inspiration from the artists of the Italian Renaissance, such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo.

Moreau left Paris in October 1857 with his friend, artist Frédéric Charlot de Courcy, sailing from Marseille to Civitavecchia and on to Rome. He approached his time in Italy as a period of extended study, a compensation for his premature withdraw from the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris of sorts. After a few days of getting oriented and taking in the sights he began studying and copying art in the city in earnest. He spent the better part of two months in the Sistine Chapel copying figures from the ceiling seven or eight hours a day. He copied the work of relatively obscure and unknown artists as often as the established masters. He was particularly interested in examining complex grouping of multiple figures and compositional color schemes. He frequented the Villa Medici, where he could work from live models, and there he established friendships with other Parisians studying in Italy, including Elie Delaunay, Henri Chapu, Émile Lévy, and Georges Bizet. He met a young Edgar Degas, for whom Moreau was to become something of a mentor while in Italy. In August 1858 he was joined by his parents. His father, having recently retired, was particularly interested in the architecture. In Venice he developed a fascination with Vittore Carpaccio, a little known artist at that time, and copied several of his works. Visits were made to Florence, Milan, Pisa, and Siena.

The Second Italian War of Independence broke out in the spring of 1859, making the summer in Naples and Pompeii a tense period. Moreau largely copied the work of others in Italy, and produced only a few original works there. Examples include some large drawings on the theme of &quot;Hesiod and the Muse&quot; and a number of fine landscapes in watercolors, painted en plein air. In September 1859 Moreau and his parents returned to Paris with several hundred drawings and paintings. Back in Paris, Degas painted a small portrait of Moreau in 1860, that hung in Moreau&#x27;s studio for the rest of his life. However, their relationship began to drift as Degas soon fell under the influence of Édouard Manet and impressionism, while Moreau stayed focused on history painting. Moreau once remarked to Degas &quot;You pretend to be able to renew art through ballet?&quot; to which Degas replied &quot;And you think you will be able to do it by jewelry?&quot;

=== Salon success and mid career (1860–1880)===
Moreau never married and very little information is known about his personal and romantic relationships. In the past some biographers speculated that he was gay, largely inferred from the fact that he was a bachelor, a lack of information regarding women in his life, and the sometimes effeminate or androgynous appearance of male figures in some of his paintings. However, more recent research and documents revealed a relationship with Adelaide-Alexandrine Dureux (b. Guise, 8 November 1835 – d. Paris, March 1890) that lasted over 30 years. Moreau apparently met Alexandrine soon after his return from Italy and in following years he produced many drawings and watercolors of her, as well as romantic caricatures of the two of them walking on clouds together. He subsidized an apartment for her on Rue Notre-Dame de Lorette, just a few blocks from the townhome where he lived with his parents. Their relationship was very discreet and known by only a few in his closest circle. His mother was aware of their relationship and apparently fond of her, as indicated by a stipulation in her will that provided an annuity for Alexandrine should Gustave die before her. He designed her tombstone, engraved with their interlaced initials, A and G, which is located near his family plot where he was interred with his parents.

&quot;Oedipus and the Sphinx&quot;, one of his first Symbolist paintings, won a medal at the Salon in 1864. Its style revealed his close study of the work of Vittore Carpaccio, Mantegna and Giovanni Bellini. Its firm outlines and detailed modeling are typical of the works that brought him success with critics and the public for the remainder of the decade. Moreau quickly gained a reputation for eccentricity. One commentator said Moreau&#x27;s work was &quot;like a pastiche of Mantegna created by a German student who relaxes from his painting by reading Schopenhauer&quot;. The painting currently resides in the permanent collection at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.

In the 1870s, disturbed by criticism that his work had become formulaic, he stopped exhibiting for a few years while he concentrated on renewing his art. In 1876 he completed &quot;Salome Dancing before Herod&quot;, which announced a more painterly style that would characterize his later works.

He was made a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1875 and was promoted to an Officier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1883.

===Teaching and later career (1881–1898)===
Moreau increasingly withdrew from society in his later years; he stopped exhibiting at the Salon, and refused to exhibit abroad. However, he continued to produce paintings and sporadically exhibited his work in other venues such as the 1889 Paris World&#x27;s Fair. He occasionally entertained guests at his townhome and was known for his engaging conversation, but visitors were rarely allowed in his studio to see his work. He was exceptionally cultivated, erudite, and a voracious reader with a personal library of over 1,600 volumes. Compared to other artists who had achieved his level of success in Paris at that time, he lived a fairly modest lifestyle. Edgar Degas, who lived nearby and occasionally still interacted with him, described Moreau in later years as &quot;a hermit who knows what time the trains leave&quot;.

Art collector Anthony Roux commissioned several artists to produce works based on Jean de La Fontaine&#x27;s Fables in 1879, including Moreau, Paul-Jacques-Aimé Baudry, Jules-Élie Delaunay, Gustave Doré, Henri Gervex, Henri Harpignies, Ernest Hébert, Nélie Jacquemart, Eugène Lami, Jean-François Raffaëlli, Félix Ziem, and others. The results were all exhibited together in 1881 at Cercle des Aquarellistes in Paris. The exhibit was celebrated by the critics of the day, and the work of Moreau&#x27;s (who completed 25 pieces, more than any other) was judged far superior to most of the others. He alone was commissioned to continue the series. In the only private show in his life, 64 La Fontaine fables with six other large watercolors were exhibited at the Goupil &amp; Cie Gallery in 1886, where Thëo Van Gogh was manager, and later in London. The series was exhibited again posthumously in Paris in 1906, and one was donated to the Musée national Gustave Moreau. Remarkably, after Roux&#x27;s death in 1914, 63 of the watercolors were sold to a single collector, and although regarded as among his finest work, they were not exhibited by the buyer, or their heirs, for well over 100 years, and are known only from some early, low quality black and white reproductions. Nearly half of the paintings later disappeared during the reign of the Nazis and have not resurfaced.

Moreau and his mother were very close throughout his life. She lost her hearing in her later years and Gustave communicated with her by writing notes on slips of paper, often giving his thoughts regarding the paintings he was working on. His assistant Henri Rupp saved many of the notes, which are archived at the museum and provide significant insight into Moreau&#x27;s ideas on his art. The death of his mother at the age of 82 in 1884 caused him deep despair. For a while he could not spend nights alone in the family townhome and took refuge at the apartment of Alexandrine Dureux nearby. Ultimately, the room where his mother died was left unchanged and became something of a shrine that he never entered. Six years later he was at Alexandrine Dureux&#x27;s bedside when she died on 28 March 1890 after five months of deteriorating health. Her death also affected him greatly. He bought back several watercolors that he had given her over the years and some furniture from her heirs, which he placed in a room of his townhome in her memory. Both deaths reinforced his isolation and he buried himself in his work, which took on an even greater melancholic edge.

Moreau was elected into the École des Beaux-Arts in 1888, but he declined professorship and a class, and the director Paul Dubois, exempted him from all formal obligations. However, on his death bed, Élie Delaunay (a close friend since their time in Rome) asked Moreau to succeed him and direct one of the main ateliers at the school. Moreau reluctantly took the class on a temporary basis in October 1891, but later accepted the appointment of professor and atelier director in January 1892 at the age of sixty-five. Moreau was a contrasting individual from the academic artists at the École des Beaux-Arts, including Léon Gërôme, Léon Bonnat, William Bougueruau, Jean-Paul Laurens, Luc-Olivier Merson, and Jules-Eugène Lenepveu. About 125 students passed through Moreau&#x27;s studio between 1891 and 1898; among them were Pierre Marcel-Béronneau, Simon Bussy, Charles Camoin, Henri Evenepoel, Jules Flandrin, Raoul du Gardier, Jacques Grüber, Charles-François-Prosper Guérin, Henri Matisse, Albert Marquet, Henri Manguin, Edgard Maxence, Theodor Pallady, Léon Printemps, Georges Rouault, and Fernand Sabatté.

&quot;Here, during his last years, he displayed remarkable talents as a teacher.&quot; Moreau&#x27;s class quickly attracted the most progressive and adventurous students. As early as 1896 Roger-Marx wrote, &quot;The fires of insurrection have been lit in the very heart of the École des Beaux-Arts: all the rebels against routine all those who wish to develop in their own individual way, have gathered under the shield of Gustave Moreau.&quot; Moreau made no attempt to impose his own views or style on his students. He gave them a stimulating atmosphere and intelligent encouragement to follow their own ideas. He took his pupils to the Louvre to study and copy the masters, unheard of at the École des Beaux-Arts: Matisse said &quot;It was an almost revolutionary attitude on his part to show us the way to the Museum.&quot; Students were invited to his home on Sunday afternoons (but not allowed to see his studio), and occasionally he visited his students.

Yesterday at half past one I was walking along the embankment when I met Gustave Moreau, who like myself was on his way to see a good chum of mine, Henri Matisse, a delicate painter, skilful in the art of using grays. He suffers from violent neuralgia in his arm and can hardly walk. Somehow or other we reached the Quai Saint-Michel, where Matisse was strolling about, waiting for him. We made our way painfully up the stairs of that old house at No 19. There we were at last in the small studio full of torn wallpaper and knick-knacks, all gray with dust. Moreau said to me &quot;We are the jury.&quot; He sat down in an armchair, with me beside him, and we spent a delightful hour. He told us the whys and the wherefores of his likes and dislikes. Matisse showed us his entries for the Champs de Mars exhibition [i.e. Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts], some ten canvases, with beautiful colors, practically all of them still lifes, and they provided the starting point for talk about everything connected with art, including music. Moreau has remained astonishingly young. There is nothing professorial about him, not a hint of pedantry. He is a friend.&quot; – Henri Evenepoel

Georges Rouault said, &quot;He was not a professor in the commonly accepted sense, but a man whom it did you good to emulate.&quot; Rouault was already a student when Moreau took the class. He soon recognized Rouault&#x27;s exceptional talent, and Rouault always held Moreau in the highest esteem. &quot;Half a century later Rouault still spoke of him with the same veneration, with the same sympathy and cordiality, as if Moreau were still living, and as if Rouault himself were still a raw youth at the feet of a mentor whose judgments he trusted implicitly both in art and in life. Matisse said, &quot;Gustave Moreau&#x27;s great quality was to regard the mind of a young student as needing to develop continuously throughout his life, and not to push him to get through the various scholastic examinations.&quot; Matisse had been denied admission to the École des Beaux-Arts, but Moreau saw him drawing in the public courtyard of the school and invited him to join his class, exempting him from the entrance examination. Matisse soon became the central figure among a faction of students in Moreau&#x27;s studio that developed into the fauvist. Albert Marquet said, &quot;As early as 1898, Matisse and I were working in what was later to be called the fauve manner&quot;, exemplified by &quot;Fauve Nude&quot;, painted in Moreau&#x27;s atelier. For decades his pupils credited the significance of their teacher, recalling his prophetic comments that were often taken to heart: &quot;the more elementary your means are, the more your sensibility shows through.&quot;; &quot;One must think color, one must have it in the imagination.&quot; &quot;Nature in itself is nothing! It merely gives the artist an occasion to express himself. Art is the unflagging pursuit through plastic means of expression and inner feeling.&quot; 

Moreau&#x27;s concerns for the fate of his life&#x27;s work started in the 1860s. He began an inventory of his paintings about 1884, and the death of Delaunay in 1891 exemplified what could become of an artist&#x27;s work after their death. Moreau arrived at the idea of leaving his house to the state as a museum, and remodeled his townhome in 1895, expanding his small studio on the top floor into a much larger exhibition space. After about a year of declining health, Moreau died of stomach cancer on 18 April 1898 and was buried at the Cimetière de Montmartre in Paris in his parents&#x27; tomb. He left instructions stipulating that his death was not to be announced in the press; his funeral was to be a very small, simple service; and any flowers were to be placed on the grave of Alexandrine Dureux, not his own. The government was hesitant to accept the estate, as artist&#x27;s house museums were very rare at that time and unprecedented in France. His assistant Henri Rupp was significant in organizing the estate and persuading the state to take it over.

==Art==
I believe neither in what I touch nor in what I see and only in what I feel. My brain and my reason seem to be ephemeral and of dubious reality. My inner feeling alone appears to me eternal and unquestionably certain. – Gustave Moreau

=== Exoticism ===
Gustave Moreau&#x27;s education in classical drawing did not stop him from experimenting with different styles of art. By traveling to other countries such as Italy or Holland and reading publications, Moreau was able to develop his unique form of art. The most important publications he owned were &quot;The Grammar of Ornament&quot; by Owen Jones, &quot;Le costume historique&quot; by August Racinet, and &quot;Le Costume&quot; by Frederick Hottenroth. All these influences led Moreau to draw not only humans, but animals and architectural monuments. He started his career drawing classical art, but by incorporating exotic images he developed a mysterious and unique form of art.

==Legacy==
During his lifetime, Moreau produced more than 15,000 paintings, watercolors and drawings. Due to his reluctance to sell his work, when he died he still owned 1,200 paintings and watercolors and 10,000 drawings which he left to the state. The Musée national Gustave Moreau at 14 rue de la Rochefoucauld (9th arrondissement), opened to the public on 14 January 1903, with his former student Georges Rouault appointed curator.

 &quot;A visionary like none other, he made the land of dreams his own, but from the madness of his dreams a sense of anguish and despair found its way into his works. A master sorcerer, he cast a spell over his period, enthralled his contemporaries, and brought a tinge of idealism to the skeptical and practical fin-de siècle. Under the influence of his painting, a whole generation of young men have grown up doleful and languid, their eyes obstinately turned to the past and the magic of other days; a whole generation of men of letters, especially poets, have become nostalgically enamored of slender Salomes glittering with jewels, of Muses carrying blood drained severed heads.&quot; – Jean Lorrain

His influence on symbolism in his lifetime and the decade following his death was tremendous. &quot;Gustave Moreau was the man of the moment. Aloof, independent, solitary, he yet became fashionable in high society and was taken up in masonic and occult circles.&quot; Art historian Jean Selz wrote &quot;He was a symbolist before the Symbolist and the most extraordinary of all of them.&quot; He influenced the next generation of Symbolists, particularly leading figures in Belgian Symbolism such as Jean Delville and Fernand Khnopff, and Odilon Redon in France. Redon said of his work &quot;Moreau, a bachelor, produced the work of an elegant bachelor, strictly sealed up against the shocks of life; his work is the fruit of it, it is art and nothing but art, and that is a saying a good deal.&quot;

Many poets and writers of the day revered Moreau&#x27;s paintings, Théophile Gautier, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Stéphane Mallarmé, Paul de Saint-Victor, and Emile Zola all praised his work. It was a common practice at the time for poets to paraphrase in verse paintings they admired, and the paintings of Gustave Moreau were among the most lauded of the symbolist poets. Théodore de Banville, José Maria de Heredia, Claudius Popelin, Jean Lorrain, Henri Cazalis, and others wrote of Moreau&#x27;s work in poetry.

Interest in his work remained fairly high in the first decade of the 20th century and occasional exhibitions of his paintings were held in the 15 years following his death. However, when the museum opened there was some disappointment in the audiences of the time in seeing the large numbers of drawings and unfinished paintings, and not a museum full of highly finished masterworks in oils, and attendance began to drop off after the opening. With the rise and prevalence of realism, impressionism and postimpressionism, followed by the onslaught of fauvism, cubism, futurism, expressionism, abstract art, and dada, Moreau (and most symbolist painting not realized in an expressionist style), appeared less relevant to modernism and was all but forgotten. After World War I, what little fame and notoriety Moreau had was largely related on his status as the teacher of Rouault and Matisse and the Fauvist. One of the only exhibitions in the 40-year period between 1918 and 1958 was a show held in Paris in 1926 centered around Moreau and his pupils.

===Moreau and surrealism===
André Breton famously used to &quot;haunt&quot; the museum and regarded Moreau as a precursor of Surrealism. In his &quot;Manifesto of Surrealism&quot;, he listed forerunners of the movement, poets and painters who &quot;could pass for Surrealist&quot;, and included Moreau with Picasso, de Chirico, and a short list of other examples. Breton wrote in 1961: &quot;My discovery of the Gustave Moreau Museum in Paris when I was sixteen years old shaped my likes and loves for the rest of my life. It was there, in certain women&#x27;s faces and figures, that I had the revelation of beauty and love.&quot; Georges Bataille wrote enthusiastically of his work, calling him a precursor of surrealism. Salvador Dalí was also a great admirer of Moreau&#x27;s work and a regular visitor to the Gustave Moreau Museum: &quot;To those I love, I recommend visiting the Museum, going and plunging into this twilight world where, risen from the gulf of erotic and scatological obsession, constellations of precious stones float like so many promises of archangelical redemption.&quot; It was at the Gustave Moreau Museum in 1970 that Dalí (holding a wax replica of his own head on a silver platter) chose to make the public announcement of his plans to open his own museum, Teatro-Museo Dalí, in Figueras, Spain. Max Ernst is known to have used reproductions of Moreau&#x27;s work on occasion to create collages.

Andre Breton advocated for Moreau&#x27;s work throughout his life, whenever he had the opportunity, in his writings, and introduced other writers and artists to the museum in Paris. At a time when Moreau and symbolism had largely drifted into obscurity, Breton sponsored an exhibition of symbolist drawings in Paris, at the Dateau-Lavoir Gallery in 1958. The exhibit has been identified as a significant event in re-establishing recognition of Moreau&#x27;s work. It was a small, &quot;over-confidential&quot; exhibition, but it succeeded in getting the attention of the right curators and in 1961, no less than the Louvre Museum and the Museum of Modern Art mounted exhibitions of Moreau&#x27;s paintings, which in turn were followed by a landmark exhibition of symbolism, &quot;Le Groupe des XX et son temps&quot; in Brussels in 1962. By the 1970s, exhibitions and monographs on Moreau and symbolism were appearing with some regularity.

The Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano, known for works such as &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Angel&#x27;s Egg&quot;, and &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot;, was inspired by Moreau&#x27;s style. Amano said in an interview that when he was first experimenting with styles to try to find his own, he would try to mimic the works of Moreau.

<text>Albania is a unitary parliamentary constitutional republic, in which the president of Albania is the head of state and the prime minister of Albania is the head of government in a multi-party system. The executive power is exercised by the Government and the prime minister with its Cabinet. Legislative power is vested in the Parliament of Albania. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The political system of Albania is laid out in the 1998 constitution. The Parliament adopted the current constitution on 28 November 1998. Historically Albania has had many constitutions. Initially constituted as a monarchy in 1913, Albania became briefly a republic in 1925, and then a authoritarian monarchy in 1928. In 1939 Albania was invaded by Fascist Italian forces, imposing a puppet state, and later occupied by Nazi German forces. Following the partisan liberation from the Nazis in 1944 a provisional government was formed, which by 1946 had transformed into a communist one-party state. In March 1991 democracy was restored with multi-party elections.

The president represents the unity of the Albanian people in the country and abroad as the head of state and is also the commander-in-chief of the military. The president is nominated through a secret vote and without debate by the Parliament of Albania by a majority of three-fifths of all its members and is in every case elected for five years. The president maintains regular and coordinated operation and stability of the national government system, safeguards the independence and territorial integrity of Albania and appoints prime ministers on the basis of the balance of power in the Parliament. The prime minister is appointed by the president after each parliamentary election and must have the confidence of the Parliament stay in office. The prime minister is elected on the basis of universal suffrage, through a secret ballot, for a four-year term. The constitution sets no limit as to office terms of the prime minister. The prime minister is &quot;de facto&quot; the most powerful and influential person in Albanian politics. However, in the absence of the prime minister, the deputy prime minister takes over his functions, such as chairing the cabinet and the council of ministers of Albania.

The Parliament is a unicameral legislative body of Albania. It is vested in both the government as well as in the parliament. The number of representatives is 140, which are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The oldest parliament with extant records was held on 2 March 1444, forged in Lezhë under Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu as the leader against the Ottoman Empire. Since 1991, the introduction of pluralism, the party system is dominated by the Democratic and the post-communist Socialist. Parliamentary elections are held every four years, the most recent in 2021. In April 2021 parliamentary election, ruling Socialist Party, led by Prime Minister Edi Rama, secured its third consecutive victory, winning nearly half of votes and enough seats in parliament to govern alone. In February 2022, Albania&#x27;s Constitutional Court overturned parliament&#x27;s impeachment of President Ilir Meta, opponent of the ruling Socialist Party.

Albania is a member state of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and also an official candidate for membership in the European Union.

 with &quot;free and fair elections&quot; in place.

Since the Declaration of Independence in 1912, Albania has experienced different models of governance, including an international protectorate, a monarchy, a state-party regime and the parliamentary republic as well. Throughout all this period, the function of the head of state has been exercised in various forms.

Nowadays, the President of Albania &quot;(Presidenti)&quot; is the head of state, commander-in-chief of the military and the representative of the unity of the Albanian people.

The president has the power to declare war, to grant pardon and to conclude agreements of peace, alliance, and participation in international organizations; upon the request of the government a simple parliamentary majority is required to ratify such actions, agreements, or treaties.
The prime minister of Albania &quot;(Kryeministri)&quot; is the head of government. According to the Constitution, the prime minister is the most senior minister of cabinet in the executive branch of government in the Albanian parliamentary system. The prime minister is appointed by the president; ministers are nominated by the president as well on the basis of the prime minister&#x27;s recommendation.

== Legislative ==

The Parliament of Albania &quot;(Kuvendi i Shqipërisë)&quot; is a unicameral legislative body. It is composed of not less than 140 members elected to a four-year term on the basis of direct, universal, periodic and equal suffrage by secret ballot. As of Article 45 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to vote, the people of Albania exercise their power through their elected representatives in the Parliament. When the Parliament is elected, the first session shall be held no later than 20 days after the completion of elections with the president as the speaker. There are 15 permanent committees. Extraordinary meets can be called by the president, by the Chairperson of the Parliament, by the prime minister or by the one fifth of the members. Decisions are made based on a majority vote if more than half of the members are present, except in cases where the Constitution provides for a special majority. As specified by the current electoral legislation in Albania, 140 members of the Parliament are elected in multi-seat constituencies. Within any constituency, parties must meet a threshold of 3 percent of votes, and pre-election coalitions must meet a threshold of 5 percent of votes. All laws passed by the Parliament are published through the Fletorja Zyrtare, the official journal of the government.

The official function is to moderate debate, make rulings on procedure, announce the results of votes, decides who may speak and has the powers to discipline members who break the procedures of the chamber or house. When the president is temporarily absent or incapable of exercising its powers, the chairperson takes over his functions.

== Judiciary ==
Albania follows the civil law tradition, which is based on the French law system. It has a three-tiered, independent judicial system governed by the constitution and national legislation enacted by the Parliament. The judicial branch of Albania is divided into three main institutions; the &#x27;Highest Courts&#x27;, which includes the Supreme Court (Gjykata e Lartë) and the Constitutional Court (Gjykata Kushtetuese), the &#x27;Intermediate Courts&#x27; such as the Courts of Appeal (Gjykata e Apelit), Court of Appeals against corruption and organized crime (Gjykata e Apelit kundër Korrupsionit dhe Krimit të Organizuar), and the Administrative Court of Appeals (Gjykata Administrative e Apelit) as well as the &#x27;First Instance Courts&#x27; such as the District Courts (Gjykata e Juridksionit të Përgjithshëm) and the Court of First Instance against corruption and organized crime (Gjykata e Shkallës së Parë kundër Korrupsionit dhe Krimit të Organizuar).

The Supreme Court is the highest court of appeal in Albania; its hearings are open and judgments are made publicly, except in cases where the privacy of the accused is to be protected. It is composed of nineteen judges such as the president of the Supreme Court and eightteen members of the Supreme Court. The judges are selected and appointed amongst judges with more than 10 years of seniority or prominent lawyers, who have exercised their activity for more than 15 years. The members can serve for a single term of nine years, without the right of reappointment. The Constitutional Court is the final authority for the interpretation of the Constitution and the compliance of laws in accordance with the constitution.
== Elections ==
Following the collapse of the communist regime in the nation, the first multi-party elections were held in 1991, simultaneously with the 1991 parliamentary elections. The 1998 Constitution of Albania guarantees the right to vote without restriction due to sex, race, social status, education level, or wealth. Every Albanian citizen who has reached the age of 18 has the right to vote. Regular elections take place for the office of the president, parliamentary, county prefects, county assemblies, city and municipal mayors and city and municipal councils.

The president is elected through a secret vote and without debate by the Parliament by a majority of three-fifths majority of all its members, for five years. The Constitution sets a limit to a maximum of two terms in office. The Parliament is elected to a four-year term in twelve multi-seat constituencies analogous to the 12 county borders, with amendments to achieve a uniform number of eligible voters in each constituency to within 3%. Within the constituencies, seats are elected by closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of 3% for parties and 5% for alliances. Seats were allocated to alliances using the d&#x27;Hondt system, then to political parties using the Sainte-Laguë method.

The county prefects and city and municipal mayors are elected to four-year terms by majority of votes cast within applicable local government units. A runoff election is held if no candidate achieves a majority in the first round of voting. Members of county, city, and municipal councils are also elected to four-year terms through proportional representation.

== Parties ==
Albania has a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must collaborate in order to form coalition governments. The two major parties are the Socialist Party of Albania (PS) and the Democratic Party of Albania (PD). Albania also has a number of minor parties. Following is a list of political parties with elected representation at the national level in the Parliament following the general parliamentary elections of 2021.

In the 2023 Albanian local elections the Democratic Party of Albania (PD) were not allowed to register their candidates, a court upheld that decision accordingly the Socialist Party of Albania (PS) won most seats.

== Foreign policy ==

Foreign policy is conducted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tirana. Albania maintains a network of 50 diplomatic missions abroad and holds relations with more than 115 countries. It is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), United Nations (UN), Council of Europe, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and several others. Citizens of the country have visa-free or visa on arrival access to 98 countries and territories, with the Albanian passport ranking 55th in terms of travel freedom according to the Henley visa restrictions index. Today, Albania maintains strong diplomatic relations with such countries as the United States, Italy, Brazil, Greece, Austria, Croatia, China, Germany, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Kuwait and Switzerland.

Since the collapse of communism in 1990, the country has extended its responsibilities and position in European and international affairs, supporting and establishing friendly relations with other nations. The main objectives are the accession of Albania to the European Union; the international recognition of Kosovo; the recognition of the expulsion of Cham Albanians; and helping and protecting the rights of Albanians in Montenegro, Macedonia, Greece, southern Serbia, Italy and the Albanian diaspora.

Furthermore, the country became one of the first eastern European countries to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Politicians of Albania considered admission to NATO as a top priority for the country. Since 1992, it has been extensively engaged with NATO, and has maintained its position as a stability factor and a strong ally of the United States and European Union in the troubled and divided region of the Balkans. At the April 2008 summit in Bucharest, NATO agreed to the accession of Albania and Croatia. One year later in April 2009, both countries joined the alliance. Although, the country received candidate status for the European Union membership in 2014, based on its 2009 application. Today, Albania plays a central role in the negotiation of the Berlin Process.

== Administrative divisions ==
With a total area of , Albania is divided into twelve administrative counties (&#x27;). The counties are further subdivided into 61 municipalities (&#x27;). In addition, the counties were further subdivided in 36 districts (&quot;&quot;), which became defunct in 2000.

The counties were created on 31 July 2000 to replace the thirty-six former districts. The government introduced a new administrative division to be implemented in 2015, whereby municipalities were reduced to 61, while rural ones called (&#x27;) are abolished. The defunct municipalities are known as Neighborhoods or Villages (&#x27;). There are overall 2980 villages or communities in the entire country, formerly known as localities (&quot;&quot;). The municipalities are the first level of local governance, responsible for local needs and law enforcement.
As part of the reform, major town centers in the country were physically redesigned and façades painted to reflect a more Mediterranean look.

<doc id="67577" wikidata="Q2087341" url="?curid=67577" title="Demographics of Algeria">
<text>Demographic features of the population of Algeria include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects. All figures are from National Office of Statistics Algeria and the United Nations Demographic Yearbooks, unless otherwise indicated.

Ninety-one percent of the Algerian population lives along the Mediterranean coast on 12% of the country&#x27;s total land mass. 75% of the population is urban, and urbanization continues, despite government efforts to discourage migration to the cities.

97% of the population follows Sunni Islam; the few non-Sunni Muslims are mainly Ibadis from the Mozabite valley at 1.3% (see Islam in Algeria).

Christianity in Algeria constitutes about 1% of the total population. While significantly greater during the French colonial years, a mostly foreign Roman Catholic community still exists, as do some Protestants. The Jewish community of Algeria, which once constituted 2% of the total population, has substantially decreased due to emigration, mostly to France and Israel.

Algeria&#x27;s educational system has grown rapidly since 1962. In 2022, there were almost 11 million pupils and 2 million students. Education is free and compulsory to age 16. Modest numbers of Algerian students study abroad, primarily in France and French-speaking Canada. In 2000, the government launched a major review of the country&#x27;s educational system.

==Ethnic groups==

Arabs make up 73.6% of the population of Algeria, Berbers make up 23.2%, Arabized Berbers make up 3%, and others constitute 0.2%. Phoenicians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Turks as well as other ethnic groups have contributed to the ethnic makeup and genetic structure of the Algerian population. Descendants of Andalusian refugees are also present in the population of Algiers and other cities. Moreover, Spanish was spoken by these Aragonese and Castillian Morisco descendants deep into the 18th century, and even Catalan was spoken at the same time by Catalan Morisco descendants in the small town of Grish El-Oued.

The Arab population of Algeria is a result of the inflow of sedentary and nomadic Arab tribes from Arabia since the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in the 7th century with a major wave in the 11th century. The majority of Algerians identify with an Arab-based identity due to the 20th century Arab nationalism. The ethnic Berbers are divided into many groups with varying languages. The largest of these are the Kabyles, who live in the Kabylia region east of Algiers, the Chaoui of North-East Algeria, the Tuaregs in the southern desert and the Shenwa people of North Algeria.

During the colonial period, there was a large (15% in 1960) European population who became known as &quot;Pied-Noirs&quot;. They were primarily of French, Spanish and Italian origin. Almost all of this population left during the war of independence or immediately after its end.

=== Genetics ===
==== Y-DNA frequencies in coastal Algeria ====
In a recent genetic study by Semino et al. (2004), the Haplogroup J1 associated with the diffusion of Arabs was found at 35% in Algeria, which is one of the most common haplogroups in Algeria, like the rest of the Maghreb, along with E1b1b.

Recent studies on the common J1 Y chromosome suggest it arrived over 10,000 years ago in North Africa, and M81/E3b2 is a Y chromosome specific to North African ancestry, dating to the Neolithic. A thorough study by Arredi et al. (2004) which analyzed populations from Algeria concludes that the North African pattern of Y-chromosomal variation (including both E3b2 and J haplogroups is largely of Neolithic origin, which suggests that the Neolithic transition in this part of the world was accompanied by demic diffusion of Afro-Asiatic–speaking pastoralists from the Middle East. This Neolithic origin was later confirmed by Myles et al. (2005) which suggest that &quot;contemporary Berber populations possess the genetic signature of a past migration of pastoralists from the Middle East&quot;, although later papers have suggested that this date could have been as longas ten thousand years ago, with the transition from the Oranian to the Capsian culture in North Africa.

==Languages==
Arabic and Berber serve as both official languages and national languages in Algeria.

Algerian Arabic (Algerian Dziriya or Darja) is the language used by the majority of the population. Colloquial Algerian Arabic has many Berber and French loanwords.

Although French has no official status, Algeria is the second-largest Francophone country in the world in terms of speakers, and French is widely used in government, media (newspapers, radio, local television), and both the education system (from primary school onwards) and academia due to Algeria&#x27;s colonial history. It can be regarded as the &quot;de facto&quot; co-official language of Algeria. In 2008, 11.2 million Algerians could read and write in French. An Abassa Institute study in April 2000 found that 60% of households could speak and understand French. In recent decades the government has reinforced the study of French and TV programs have reinforced use of the language.

Algeria emerged as a bilingual state after 1962. Colloquial Arabic is spoken by about 83% of the population and Berber by 27.4%.

===Spoken and popular languages===
* Arabic language: 83% (dialectal Algerian Arabic including all dialects: Eastern, Western, Algiers dialect, Saharan)
* French: 70% (as a 2nd or 3rd language, spoken by both low and highly educated people)
* Berber languages: 27.4% Chaouia, Kabyle, Tamahaq, Chenoua, Mozabite (Tumẓabt)
* English: 15% (as a 3rd language, spoken by highly educated people)
* Korandje language (Kwarandzyey): 0.01%

===Official and recognized languages===
* Modern Standard Arabic: official language of the state.
* Berber language (Tamazight): official language of the state.

==Religion==

Islam is the predominant religion with 99% of the population. There are about 150,000 Ibadis in the M&#x27;zab Valley in the region of Ghardaia.

There were an estimated 10,000 Christians in Algeria in 2008. In a 2009 study the UNO estimated there were 45,000 Catholics and 50,000–100,000 Protestants in Algeria. A 2015 study estimates 380,000 Muslims converted to Christianity in Algeria.

<text>Demographic features of the population of Albania include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects. The demography of Albania is monitored by the Institute of Statistics of Albania. The institute has performed demographic censuses since the 1920s. The latest census in Albania was performed in September 2023.

Albania is a fairly ethnically and linguistically homogeneous country, with ethnic Albanians forming 91% of the total population in the country. The total population residing in Albania in September 2023 was 2,402,113 according to the most recent INSTAT census.

The first official population statistic for Albania was the 1923 census, when the country had a total of 823,000 inhabitants. Previous censuses were carried out by the Ottoman Empire, which are not yet available. A shift in administrative borders in 1913 make comparison of various periods more complicated. Maddison from 2001, estimates that in Albania about 200,000 people lived up to the year 1600, and that the population grew to 300,000 by 1700, implying an annual average growth rate of 0.4% in that period. However, population growth accelerated from the declaration of independence in 1912 to 1944 to 0.7% per year. This was due in part because Albania had the largest birth rate and the smallest death rate in Europe at the time. After the second World War, population increase policies pursued by the communist government and a large life expectancy fuelled a 2.5% annual increase for the following 45 years. The growth strained economic resources during communism in a Malthusian fashion that led to the collapse of the regime and the emigration of about 20 to 25 percent of the population in the following two decades. Albania experienced a demographic transition starting from 1960s, when crude birth rates began a slow decline, despite a government policy that called for a population increase. After the 1990s, the population showed an average decline of about 0.3% per year, caused by emigration. In the 2001 Census, the population declined to 3,023,000 from almost 3,300,000 million in 1990.

The permanent population of Albania at the 2023 census had decreased of 420,000 people compared to the 2011 census. The population density in 2023 was 84 inhabitants per square kilometre. The overall life expectancy in Albania at birth was 78 years in 2011. In 2011, for the first time in the history of population censuses in Albania, the population in urban areas (53.7%) was larger than the population of rural areas (46.3%). The Albanian language is the official language, but minority languages are officially used in some local government units. Albanian is declared as the native language by 98.76% of the population. The Albanian people are considered one of the most polyglot people in Europe. They generally speak more than two languages, which are mainly French, Greek, Italian, and English, which are increasing due to migration return, and new Greek and Italian communities in the country. The main religions of Albania are Islam (50.67%), Christianity (16%) of which Roman Catholicism (8.38%), Eastern Orthodoxy (7.22%) and Evangelicism (0.4%), other religions (0.15%), Believers without denomination (13.83%) and Atheists (3.55%) according to the 2023 census. There were also those who preferred not to answer (10.17%), 

The main ethnic groups in Albania are Albanians (91%), Greeks (1%), Egyptians (0.5%), Romani people (0.4%), Bulgarians (0.3%), as well as Bosniaks, Aromanians, Macedonians, Serbs and Montenegrins.

Albania has a high Human Development Index of 0.764, ranking 75th in the world in 2016. In 2016, Albania had a total population of 2,786,026, 1,361,326 being males and 1,424,700 females. 42,922 inhabitants have left Albania and in the same year the number of immigrants in the country was 25,846.

Albanian demographics are difficult to ascertain and verify due to political corruption at the local and central level as noted by the Council of Europe.

==Population==
With an estimated population of 2.40 million in 2023, Albania ranks 143rd in the world by population. The population density is 101 inhabitants per square kilometre. The overall life expectancy in Albania at birth is 78 years. The total fertility rate of 1.70 children per mother is one of the lowest in the world. In 2016, the population of Albania was about 2.89 million, comprising 1,447 million male and 1,443 female persons. There were 38,003 live births and 20,737 deaths in Albania. The natural increase of the population was positive, as the number of births exceeded the number of deaths by 17,266. Due to external migration and low birth rate, the population declined by 18,307. The total dependency ratio of population in Albania is 46.8%.

In 2001, the number of households amounted to 726,895. The age structure was under 6 years by 10.8% and 65 years and older by 7.5%. However, the sex ratio amounted to 49.9% males and 50.1% females of the total population. Furthermore, 2,737,614 of the population was older than 6 years. In 2011, the total population was 2,831,741. The comparison of the figures shows that the population has decreased by 7.7% in about ten years. Large scale emigration and fertility decline are supposed to be the main causes of the observed population decrease. A preliminary estimate of the number of persons that refused to participate in the census is 29,355 (1.04%). This figure is based on the number of dwellings for which a refusal was recorded and is included in the total population. The total population is composed of 1,421,810 males (50.2%) and 1,409,931 females (49.8%). For the first time in the history of population censuses in the nation, the population in urban areas is larger than the population of rural areas. According to 2011 census preliminary results, 53.7 percent of the population lives in urban areas and 46.3 percent in rural areas.

The 2011 census is regarded as unreliable and inaccurate by the Council of Europe, showing incompatibility with the protection of national minorities. Also, the World Council of Churches sent letters to the United Nations Human Rights Council regarding the matter, having conducted their own questionnaire which showed major irregularities. It was the first census to include ethnicity, was struck by controversy since according to article 20 of the Census law, there is a $1,000 fine for anyone who declares anything other than what was written down on the individual&#x27;s birth certificate. Some of the minorities, mainly the Greeks, boycotted the census. The religious affiliation of the population was 56.7% Muslims, 13.79% undeclared, 10.03% Catholics, 6.75% Orthodox believers, 5.49% other, 2.5% Atheists, 2.09% Bektashis and 0.14% other Christians.
According to the Institute of Statistics INSTAT, the population in 2016 was 2,886,026. Tirana County is the area with the highest population of 811,649 in the country. Fier County remains the population with the second highest population with a total of 312,488. The Counties with the lowest result are Gjirokastër, Kukës and Dibër respectively with 70,331, 84,035 and 134,153 inhabitants. About 53.4% of Albania&#x27;s population live in cities. The three largest counties account for half of the population.

Almost 53.4% of the population of Albania living in cities. According to the Institute of Statistics (INSTAT), the three largest counties account for half of the population. Over 1 million people live in Tirana and Durrës, making it the largest urban area in Albania. The area of the capital Tirana, is one of largest cities in the Balkan Peninsula and ranks 7th with a population about 800,000.
The second largest is the port city of Durrës, with a population of 201.110, followed by Vlorë, the largest city in southern Albania, with 141.513 inhabitants. The Institute of Statistics forecast that the population may even increase by less than a fifth from 763.560 by 2011 to 909.252
by 2031, depending on the actual birth rate and the level of net migration.

==Ethnic groups==

Albania is inhabited mostly by Albanians. In the 2011 official census, 97.8% of those who disclosed their identity were Albanians (82.58% overall), while 2.3% stated other ethnicities (1.9% overall). Albania recognizes nine national minorities. These include Aromanians, Balkan Egyptians, Greeks, Bulgarians, Bosniaks, Macedonians, Montenegrins, Serbs, and Roma. As conducting a satisfactory census of ethnic minorities is one of the country&#x27;s commitments to the European Union, the Government of Albania conducted an official census to clarify the ethnic composition of the population in 2011. However this census was deemed unreliable by internal and external organisations, including the Council of Europe and many of Albania&#x27;s ethnic minority groups. The last census to include data on ethnic minorities was conducted in 1989. The census conducted in 2001 did not collect information about ethnic groups and nationalities in the population.

Since the 21st century, Albania has also witness a significant settlement of foreign expats into the country, such as Italians, Chinese, Turks, Bengalis, Americans, Portuguese and other foreign workers. In 2021 there were as many as 15,000 foreigners living in Albania (0.5% of the population).

Albania also houses 3,200 Afghan refugees and over 3,800 Ukrainian refugees.


;Notes
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.
==Religion==


According to the 2023 census, there were 1,101,718 (45.86%) Muslims (mostly Sunni Muslims and Non-denominational Muslims) 201,530 (8.38%) Catholics, 173,645 (7.22%) Eastern Orthodox, 115,644 (4.81%) Bektashi Muslims, 9,658 (0.4%) Evangelicals, 3 670 (0.15%) of other religions, 332,155 (13.82%) believers without denomination, 85,311 (3.55%) Atheists and 378,782 (15.76%) did not provide an answer.

The Constitution of Albania extends freedom of religion to all citizens and the government generally respects this right in practice. It declares no official religion and provides for equality of all religions. However, the predominant religious communities enjoy a greater degree of official recognition and social status based on their historical presence in the country. All registered religious groups have the right to hold bank accounts and to own property and buildings. Religious freedoms have in large part been secured by the generally amicable relationship among religions. The Ministry of Education has the right to approve the curricula of religious schools to ensure their compliance with national education standards while the State Committee on Cults oversees implementation. There are also 68 vocational training centers administered by religious communities.

Government policy and practice contributed to the generally free exercise of religion. The government is secular and the Ministry of Education asserts that public schools in the country are secular and that the law prohibits ideological and religious indoctrination. Religion is not taught in public schools.

==Language==


The Albanian language is the official language of Albania. It has two distinct dialects, Tosk, spoken in the south, and Gheg, spoken in the north. The Shkumbin river is the rough dividing line between the two dialects. The language is spoken primarily in Greece, Italy, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Montenegro. Centuries-old communities speaking Albanian-based dialects can be found scattered in Greece (Arvanites), Southern Italy, Sicily and Calabria (Arbëreshë) and in Ukraine. However, due to the large Albanian diaspora, the total number of speakers is much higher than the native speakers in Southern Europe. The four dialects include Tosk Albanian, Gheg Albanian, Arbëresh and Arvanitika.

Foreign languages spoken generally include one – or more – amongst the following: English, French, Greek, Italian. Language knowledge is increasing due to returning migrants, as well as new Greek and Italian communities in the country. In particular, Italian is widely spoken throughout Albania. La Francophonie states that 30,000 French speakers can be found in Albania. Greek, the language of the Greek minority of the south, is also very widespread in that region. Nowadays, knowledge of English is growing very rapidly, especially among the youth.

The ethnic minorities languages include Aromanian, Serbian, Macedonian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Gorani, and Roma. Greek is the largest minority language of the country as well as the first largest foreign language. Approximately 5,000 Macedonian language-speakers can be found in Albania. Most of these living in the southeastern part of the country.

== Education ==


Literacy in the country is 98.7 percent. The school life expectancy (primary to tertiary education) of Albania is 16 years. The nation ranks 25th out of 167 countries in the world. In 2015, the overall literacy rate in Albania was 98.7%; the male literacy rate was 99.2% and female literacy rate was 98.3%.

Education for primary &quot;(arsimi fillor)&quot;, secondary &quot;(arsimi i mesëm)&quot;, and tertiary &quot;(arsimi universitar)&quot; levels are mostly supported by the state. Classes start in September or October and end in June or July. Albanian is the primary language of instruction in all public schools. Education takes place in three stages: primary, secondary, and pre-university. Primary education is obligatory from grade 1 to 9. Students must pass the graduation exams at the end of the 9th grade in order to continue their education. After primary school, the general education is provided at the secondary schools. Students get prepared for the Matura examination, allowing them to obtain their matura diploma, which grants admission to higher education. The country follows the Bologna model in accordance with the 2007 Law on &#x27;Higher Education&#x27;. These institutions can be public or private, and may offer one, two or three levels of higher education depending on the institution.

== Health ==
Albania has a universal health care system. In 2000, Albania had the world&#x27;s 55th best healthcare performance.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Albania ranks around the 40th in the world in terms of life expectancy. Compared to other Western countries, Albania has a low rate of obesity.

== Diaspora ==


Albanians have established communities in many regions throughout southern Europe. The modern Albanian diaspora was formed largely in the 15th century, when many Albanians emigrated to southern Italy, especially in Sicily and Calabria also to Greece, to escape either various socio-political difficulties and the Ottoman conquest. Other destinations include the US, Canada, Argentina, and Turkey.

Over the last twenty years, Albania has experienced major demographic changes, having the highest population growth in Europe before the collapse of communism in the country. Albania has also shifted to population decline since the changes. However, during the final days of the transition from communism to capitalism in 1990, over a million Albanians moved to foreign countries. These include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Nordic countries, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. About 440,000 of them settled in Greece, where Albanians make up 60% of immigrants. 350,000 Albanians have migrated to Italy over the 1990s to 2000s, however the number has increased substantially. The situation in Kosovo is similar. More than a million Albanians have left Kosovo permanently since the late 1980s, not counting those fleeing the Kosovo War who have subsequently returned. Important destinations for Albanians emigrating from Kosovo have been Switzerland and Germany.

<text>Since its independence from France in 1962, Algeria has pursued an activist foreign policy. In the 1960s and 1970s, Algeria was noted for its support of Third World policies and independence movements. Since its independence, Algeria has been a member of the Arab League, the African Union and of the United Nations.

== History of foreign relations since independence ==

=== During Ben Bella&#x27;s presidency (1962–1965) ===
Following its independence in 1962, Algeria developed deep ties with many foreign countries with a heavy presence in the global scene. The Algerian government, pursuing the dynamics that had started during the Algerian War for Independence and into the Cold War used the country&#x27;s strategic geopolitical position – at the crossroads of Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian world – to assert its own interests. Algeria came to see itself as a full actor in the Cold War and not simply a bystander caught in a crossfire between the Western and Eastern blocs. Moreover, Algeria played a central role in the creation of the Third World as a global political project, using its position at the intersection of international agendas – notably between non-alignment and Afro-Asianism positions, and between anticolonial and socialist movements.

==== Algeria at the center of the competition between the Western and Eastern superpowers ====
Being a newly independent country from colonial rule of a Western power – France – and having waged a liberation war with a socialist orientation, Algeria was naturally inclined to turn towards the Soviet Union and its allies. However, the country&#x27;s strategic advantages increased its importance to the eyes of the Western bloc. Primarily, France wanted to preserve its interests in the oil and gas exploitations in Algeria. As Charles de Gaulle stated to the Algerian finance minister in 1963, &quot;If the Algerian government respects its commitments and takes into account our interests, it can count on our cooperation&quot;. Hence, French economic aid continued to flow in Algeria, to ensure control on the petroleum and gas industry as well as maintain continued use of Algerian soil to run atomic tests in the Saharan desert. Under Ben Bella, diplomatic relations with France were normalized, the negotiations concerning oil and gas leading to an agreement in 1964. As to the United States, they wanted to prevent Algeria from becoming yet another socialist country joining the ranks of the Soviet bloc. Hence, along with minor military equipment, the United States provided Algeria with a food program (PL-480) which delivered free food to the population. However, the Algerian commitment to supporting anti-colonial movements in Africa went against American interests in the continent, which led to an indirect conflict with the United States and an increasingly hostile relationship between the two countries.

During the war for independence, the ALN had already benefitted from equipment, training and advice from communist countries: the USSR (though its help was quite timid until the final months of the war), China, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. Moreover, ALN delegations had visited China and North Vietnam to learn from their guerrilla strategies. Help and support from the communist bloc therefore increased after independence:

* Even though Algeria was not a communist regime, the Soviet Union invested massive amounts of money and material help in the country. For instance, in 1963, the USSR granted $200 million in import credits for Soviet machinery to help build the Algerian industry, and committed to building a petrochemical research institute. The Soviet Union also agreed to buy agricultural products and minerals that Algeria was struggling to export. It was finally the country&#x27;s main military supplier, providing planes, tanks, armored vehicles, ships, light weapons and ammunition for a total of 11 billion dollars from 1962 to 1989.
* The other great communist power, China, demonstrated its interest in Algeria as a fellow antiimperialist country. Hence, when Zhou Enlai visited Algeria in December 1963, he granted Algeria a low-interest loan of $100 million. Moreover, the Chinese were more aggressive in their support for armed groups fighting imperialist and neo-imperialist regimes in Africa. Algeria and China therefore cooperated on this matter, with China contributing to ANP training camps, and shipping weapons and revolutionary militants to Algeria.

The Sino-Soviet split strengthened the two communist countries&#x27; competition for Algeria. However, China was inferior economically and militarily to the USSR, and could not match the USSR&#x27;s industrial equipment and sophisticated armaments. Moreover, as the autogestion model proved to be widely inefficient, Algeria started to move towards a more centralized and Soviet-style economy by the end of 1964.

==== Algeria and the Third World project ====
Ben Bella&#x27;s foreign policy was marked by globalism, as it was not restrained to a specific culture nor geographical region. Rather, the project of the Third World and its diverse manifestations – the Non-Aligned Movement, the Afro-Asian People&#x27;s Solidarity Organization, etc. – were meant to include all the developing and anti-imperialist countries, and Algeria intended to play a major role in its development.

This role is perfectly summarized by Amilcar Cabral&#x27;s – leader of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde – famous declaration that Algeria was the &quot;Mecca of revolution&quot;. Indeed, the Algerian foreign policy had been influenced by Frantz Fanon&#x27;s and other radical Third World thinkers&#x27; urgings to &quot;export revolution&quot; to other countries suffering from the yoke of imperial oppression. Therefore, the support of armed nationalists and revolutionaries was one of the foundations of Algerian relations with African countries. Ever since 1960, the FLN camps in Algeria&#x27;s neighboring countries (Morocco, Tunisia and Mali) had been used to provide training and material help to revolutionary movements. By 1963, Algeria was offering refuge, funds, weapons and training to rebels from a dozen African countries: the left-wing opposition in Morocco, the secessionist Sanwi government in Ivory Coast, the Sawaba party in Niger, the CNL (or &quot;Simbas&quot;) in Congo-Leopoldville, the UPC in Cameroon, the MPLA and FNLA in Angola (250 recruits were trained in Algeria and 70 tons of armaments were sent to this country), and several armed groups in Zanzibar, Portuguese Guinea, South Africa and Namibia.

However, the Third World project also materialized through the various conferences and international organizations that united developing countries. Firstly, the Non-Aligned Movement, which was founded in Belgrade in 1961, and which Algeria joined shortly after its independence, defined the concept of non-alignment in the Cold War as a way for poor countries to exploit the conflicts and tensions and hence to promote their own interests. According to Jeffrey J. Byrne, the Algerian conception of the Non-Aligned Movement was that of a &quot;political, goal-oriented and geographically unbounded anti-imperial solidarity&quot;. The Third World coalition could therefore encompass Latin America countries, and even Europe ones like Yugoslavia. Algeria was particularly important in this sense, as it acted as a bridge between blocs and regions. For instance, its position at the crossroads of the Arab and the sub-Saharan worlds enabled Algeria to create links and unity between these two regions: at Algeria&#x27;s request, Arab countries supported Angolan and other African revolutions, while African countries endorsed the Palestinian cause. However, these global Third World solidarity links went further than Africa: for example, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam opened a permanent office in Algiers (one of only two that were located in non-communist countries). One of the most successful Third World projects was the Organization of African Unity, founded in Addis Ababa in 1963 to formalize and institutionalize the main Third World principles. Moreover, Algeria advocated for the creation within the organization of a &quot;liberation committee&quot;, the &quot;Committee of Nine&quot;, to support national liberation movements (even by military means). This embodies the Algerian view of Third Worldism: the institutionalization of collective defiance towards the imperial system.

Therefore, if the multipolarity of international relations – the traditional East versus West bipolarism, but also the intra-communist poles and the development of Third World alternatives – had benefitted the non-aligned states such as Algeria, the latter&#x27;s increasing reliance on the Soviet Union – especially since the Sand War against Morocco in 1963 – risked jeopardizing the country&#x27;s independence and its relations with other powers, such as the United States or China.

=== During Boumediene&#x27;s presidency (1965–1978) ===
Algerian foreign relations during the presidency of Houari Boumediene marked a shift towards more stable and Algero-centered policies, in opposition to Ben Bella&#x27;s cosmopolitism. However, this greater focus on the country&#x27;s economic needs and traditional Islamic culture did not end the period of international ambitions.

==== Algeria&#x27;s centrality in the Third World ====
Pan-Africanism and Pan-Arabism were strengthened during the Boumediene era. Algeria had joined the Arab League in 1962, and hosted its 1973 summit in Algiers. This strong relation with other Arab countries, notably with Egypt, was reinforced after Boumediene&#x27;s seizure of power. For instance, in 1966, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser sent thousands of teachers to support Algeria in the Arabization of its educational system. After Nasser&#x27;s death in 1970, Boumediene increasingly represented the political project of Pan-Arabism; and in 1973, Algeria played a major role in the organization of the war against Israel, as well as calling for oil to be used as a weapon in the OPEC. Moreover, in 1969, Algiers hosted the Pan-African Cultural Festival: this grandiose display of an African identity, forged from the continent&#x27;s common experience of Western imperialism, reunited anticolonial militants from numerous countries of the Third World. Far from being opposed, Pan-Arabism and Pan-Africanism were, under Algerian influence, united: Boumediène summoned an extraordinary session of the Organization for African Unity following the Kippur War in 1973, which resulted in the creation of a special committee to coordinate the Organization and the Arab League, and in the break of diplomatic relations of 42 African states with Israel. Finally, Boumediène presided over a larger and more powerful Non-Aligned Movement in 1973.

Algeria&#x27;s approach to international politics was motivated by the need for a &quot;liberation&quot; from the Western neocolonial economic superiority. Hence, in October 1967, Algiers hosted the meeting of the &quot;Group of 77&quot;, which united 77 developing countries on major revendications: a global reform of the terms of trade and a greater collaboration between Third World countries to set the prices for their raw materials. Furthermore, the main points of Boumediene&#x27;s address to the United Nations General Assembly in 1974 – reparations for colonization and a transfer of resources from North to South – were adopted by UN. The notion of a &quot;new international economic order&quot; emerged as a way to reshape the world economy to the benefit of developing countries, based on the principle of sovereign equality between states.

==== A careful equilibrium between Cold War powers ====
Boumediene took pride in Algeria&#x27;s non-aligned status, by claiming its distance from both Soviet-style socialism and Western capitalism, while the country enjoyed an increasing prosperity. However, support from the Communist bloc did not halt. Indeed, because of their dependence on raw materials and their lack of hard currencies, commerce between Third World countries was negligible. The USSR, on the contrary, was able to deliver military equipment, industrial expertise, and trade outputs: the Soviets replaced France as the first destination for Algerian wine, and provided 200,000 tons of wheat when a drought hit the country in 1966.

Once again, the support Algeria received from the Soviet bloc was not exclusive to that of the Western bloc. Even though Boumediene took strong public stands, as when he claimed in 1969 after a summer of violence against Algerians living in France that if the French government could not insure the security of Algerian immigrants, he would repatriate them regardless of the cost, Algerian-French relations were progressively normalized during the 1970 decade. This posturing, like the nationalization of oil in 1971, served to increase his popularity in internal politics. However, France remained a model of prosperity, Algeria was still heavily dependent on France economically, and in 1975, French President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing made the first presidential visit since independence. More generally, Algeria continued to do business with the West, and avoided to be overly dependent on Soviet support. Indeed, despite the break of relations with the United States after the Six-Day War in 1967, the Americans had almost replaced France as Algeria&#x27;s primary trade partner by the early 1970s. Therefore, the competition between the West and the USSR gave Algeria opportunities to diversify its economic partnerships.

=== During Bouteflika&#x27;s presidency (1999 - 2019) ===
Since his inauguration in 1999, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika sought to extend Algeria&#x27;s international influence, traveling extensively throughout the world. In July 2001, he became the first Algerian President to visit the US White House in 16 years.

He made official visits, among others, to France, South Africa, Italy, Spain, Germany, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia.

=== After Bouteflika (2019-) ===

On 24 August 2021, Algeria cut diplomatic relations with neighbouring Morocco, accusing Morocco of supporting a separatist group and hostile actions against Algeria. Morocco called the decision unjustified.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Algeria has tried to keep good relations with both Russia and the West by remaining neutral at the UN on other votes.

<doc id="67582" wikidata="Q1155736" url="?curid=67582" title="Politics of Andorra">
<text>The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, and a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government, with the Head of Government of Andorra as chief executive. Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.

Before 1993, Andorra&#x27;s political system had no clear division of powers into executive, legislative, and judicial branches. A constitution ratified and approved in 1993 establishes Andorra as a sovereign parliamentary democracy that retains the Bishop of Urgell and president of France as co-princes and heads of state. However, the head of government retains executive power. The two co-princes serve coequally with limited powers that do not include an individual veto over government acts (however, a bill can in effect be &quot;vetoed&quot; if both do not sign the legislation). They are each represented in Andorra by a personal representative.

The fundamental impetus for this political transformation was a recommendation by the Council of Europe in 1990 that, if Andorra wished to attain full integration in the European Union (EU), it should adopt a modern constitution that guarantees the rights of those living and working there. A Tripartite Commission – made up of representatives of the co-princes, the General Council, and the Executive Council – was formed in 1990 and finalized the draft constitution in April 1991, making the new constitution a fact.

One remaining, symbolic, legacy of Andorra&#x27;s special relationship with France and Spain, is that the principality has no postal service of its own – French and Spanish postal services operate side by side, although each of them issues separate stamps for Andorra, instead of using their own.

==Government==
===Executive branch===

Under the 1993 constitution, the co-princes continue as heads of state, but the head of government retains executive power. The two co-princes serve coequally with limited powers that do not include veto over government acts. Both are represented in Andorra by a delegate, although since 1993, France and Spain have their own embassies. As co-princes of Andorra, the Bishop of Urgell and the President of France maintain supreme authority in approval of all international treaties with France and Spain, as well as all those that deal with internal security, defense, Andorran territory, diplomatic representation, and judicial or penal cooperation. Although the institution of the co-princes is viewed by some as an anachronism, the majority sees them as both a link with Andorra&#x27;s traditions and a way to balance the power of Andorra&#x27;s two much larger neighbors.

The way the two princes are chosen makes Andorra one of the most politically distinct nations on earth. One co-prince is the sitting Bishop of Urgell of the Catalan city of La Seu d&#x27;Urgell, currently Joan Enric Vives i Sicilia. The other is the sitting President of France, currently Emmanuel Macron (it has historically been any head of state of France, including kings and emperors of the French). As neither prince lives in Andorra, their role is almost entirely ceremonial.

In 1981, the Executive Council, consisting of the Cap de Govern (head of government) and seven ministers, was established. Every four years, after the general elections, the General Council elects the head of government, who, in turn, chooses the other members of the Executive Council.

===Legislative branch===
Andorra&#x27;s main legislative body is the 28-member General Council (Parliament). The sindic (president), the subsindic and the members of the Council are elected in the general elections to be held every four years. The Council meets throughout the year on dates set by tradition or as required.

At least one representative from each parish must be present for the General Council to meet. Historically, within the General Council, four deputies apiece from each of the seven parishes have provided representation. This system allowed parishes with as few as 350 voters the same number of representatives as larger parishes with up to 2,600 voters. To reduce this imbalance, a provision in the new constitution modified the structure and format for electing Council members. Under the new format, half of the representatives are chosen by the traditional system, and the other half selected from nationwide lists.

A sindic and a subsindic are chosen by the General Council to implement its decisions. They serve three-year terms and may be reappointed once. They receive an annual salary. Sindics have virtually no discretionary powers, and all policy decisions must be approved by the Council as a whole.

===Judicial branch===
The judicial system is independent. Courts apply the customary law of Andorra, supplemented with Roman law and customary Catalan law. Civil cases are first heard by the Court of &quot;Batlles&quot; – a group of four judges, two chosen by each co-prince. Appeals are heard in the Court of Appeals. The highest body is the five-member Superior Court of Justice.

==Political parties and elections==

The last election for the General Council was held on 7 April 2019.

===April 2019 Andorran General Council election results===
==Administrative divisions==
Andorra is formed by seven parishes (parròquies, singular - parròquia); Andorra la Vella, Canillo, Encamp, La Massana, Escaldes-Engordany, Ordino, Sant Julia de Loria.

==Security==
The Government of Andorra maintains a small ceremonial Army, a well-equipped modernized Police Corps, a Fire Brigade, a Mountain Rescue Service, and the GIPA, which is a para-military unit trained in hostage and counter-terrorism roles.

==Political conditions==
Andorra&#x27;s young democracy is in the process of redefining its political party system. Three out of the five parties that dominated the political scene in past years have dissolved. The Liberal Union (UL) tried to reshape itself and change its name to that of the Liberal Party of Andorra (PLA) to offer a political umbrella to small parties and groups that have not yet found their place. Another party, the Social Democratic Party of Andorra, has been formed. It was designed to attract parties previously aligned with socialist ideals. Since the 1993 constitutional ratification, three coalition governments have formed. For instance, one government united the UL, the CNA (National Andorran Coalition), and another relatively small party with Marc Forné Molné, a Liberal Unionist, as Cap de Govern, or head of government. In the 2011 election, however, the Democrats for Andorra won a landslide victory over the Social Democrats, capturing 20 of the legislature&#x27;s 28 seats, with the Social Democrats winning six and the Lauredian Union winning two.

In recent years the government has instituted many reforms. It legalized political parties and trade unions, and legally guaranteed freedom of religion and assembly. There has also been a redefinition of the qualifications for Andorran citizenship, a major issue in a country where only 13,000 of 65,000 residents were legal citizens. In 1995, a law to broaden citizenship was passed, but citizenship remains difficult to acquire. Only Andorran nationals are able to transmit citizenship automatically to their children, a legal principal known as jus sanguinis. Lawful residents in Andorra who are nationals of France, Spain or Portugal may obtain citizenship after 10 years of residency. Other nationals may obtain citizenship after 20 years of residency. Children of residents may opt for Andorran citizenship after age 18 if they resided most of their lives in Andorra. Mere birth on Andorran soil, a legal principal known as jus soli, does not confer citizenship. Dual nationality is not permitted. Non-citizens are allowed to own only a 33% share of a company. Only after residing in the country for 20 years may they own 100% of a company. A proposed law to reduce the necessary years from 20 to 10 was debated in Parliament.

By creating a modern legal framework for the country, the 1993 constitution has allowed Andorra to begin a shift from an economy based largely on duty-free shopping to one based on international banking and finance. Despite promising new changes, it is likely that Andorra will, at least for the short term, continue to confront a number of difficult issues arising from the large influx of foreign residents and the need to develop modern social and political institutions. In addition to questions of Andorran nationality and immigration policy, other priority issues include allowing freedom of association, dealing with housing scarcities and speculation in real estate, developing the tourism industry, and renegotiating the relationship with the European Union.

<doc id="67583" wikidata="Q40425" url="?curid=67583" title="Born in the U.S.A.">
<text>Born in the U.S.A. is the seventh studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen, released on June 4, 1984, by Columbia Records. Produced by Springsteen, Jon Landau, Steven Van Zandt, and Chuck Plotkin, the album was recorded in New York City with the E Street Band over two years between January 1982 and March 1984. Some of the songs originated from the demo tape that yielded Springsteen&#x27;s previous album, the solo effort &quot;Nebraska&quot; (1982), while others were written afterward. The sessions yielded between 70 and 90 songs; some were released as B-sides, some later saw release on compilation albums, while others remain unreleased.

&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; has a more pop-influenced sound than Springsteen&#x27;s previous albums. Its production is typical of mainstream 1980s rock music, with prominent use of synthesizers. The lyrics contrast with the album&#x27;s livelier sound and continue the themes of previous records, particularly &quot;Nebraska&quot;. Topics include working-class struggles, disillusionment, patriotism, and personal relationships, while several tracks incorporate humorous lyrics. The cover photograph of Springsteen from behind against a backdrop of the American flag has appeared on lists of the best album covers ever.

Accompanied by a vast promotional campaign that featured seven singles, five music videos, and three dance remixes, &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; was a massive commercial success, becoming the best-selling album of 1985 and topping the charts in nine countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. All seven of its singles, including &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot;, and &quot;Glory Days&quot;, reached the U.S. top ten. The album has sold over 30 million copies worldwide, making it Springsteen&#x27;s best-selling album and one of the best-selling albums of all time. Upon its release, music critics praised the album&#x27;s storytelling and musical performances, while others criticized the use of similar lyrical themes as Springsteen&#x27;s previous albums. Springsteen and the E Street Band supported the album on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour.

&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; transformed Springsteen into a worldwide superstar and brought him his largest amount of success to date as a recording and performing artist. He later expressed reservations about the album itself and the fame it brought him; its success influenced his career path for the rest of the 1980s and 1990s. &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; helped popularize American heartland rock and influenced later artists who wanted to mimic its power and impact. In later decades, publications such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; one of the best albums by Springsteen, of the 1980s, and of all time. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2012.

== Background ==
Following the conclusion of the River Tour in September 1981, Bruce Springsteen rented a ranch in Colts Neck, New Jersey. While there, he spent time writing new material, including a song called &quot;Vietnam&quot;, about a Vietnam veteran returning home from the war to an unenthusiastic response. During the tour, Springsteen read &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;, a 1976 autobiography by Ron Kovic, an anti-war activist who was wounded and paralyzed during the Vietnam War. Kovic&#x27;s story inspired Springsteen to meet various Vietnam veterans in Los Angeles, California, which in turn inspired the writing of several tracks that centered on or included themes about the Vietnam War: &quot;Vietnam&quot;, &quot;Shut Out the Light&quot;, &quot;A Good Man Is Hard to Find (Pittsburgh)&quot;, &quot;Highway Patrolman&quot;, and &quot;Brothers Under the Bridges&quot;.

As Springsteen continued developing &quot;Vietnam&quot;, the director Paul Schrader asked him to write music for an unmade film called &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; The screenplay concerned a Cleveland factory worker who works during the day and plays guitar in a bar band at night. Springsteen revised the lyrics and music of &quot;Vietnam&quot;, using the film&#x27;s title to create &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; Schrader eventually made the film but retitled it &quot;Light of Day&quot;, which was released in 1987; Springsteen provided its title song.

Using a four-track tape recorder purchased by his guitar technician Mike Batlan, Springsteen demoed tracks he had written during that period in the bedroom of his Colts Neck home between December 17, 1981, and January 3, 1982. These included &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;Nebraska&quot;, &quot;Atlantic City&quot;, &quot;Mansion on the Hill&quot;, &quot;Downbound Train&quot;, and &quot;Child Bride&quot;. Springsteen intended to rerecord the Colts Neck demos with the E Street Band – Roy Bittan (piano), Clarence Clemons (saxophone), Danny Federici (organ), Garry Tallent (bass), Steven Van Zandt (guitar), and Max Weinberg (drums) – during sessions booked to begin in April 1982 at the Power Station in New York City, where &quot;The River&quot; (1980) had been recorded. From February to March, Springsteen demoed more tracks, including &quot;Wages of Sin&quot;, &quot;Your Love is All Around Me&quot;, &quot;Baby I&#x27;m So Cold&quot;, and &quot;Fade to Black&quot;.
== Recording history ==

=== Initial sessions and &quot;Nebraska&quot; ===

In late January 1982, weeks after recording the demos in Colts Neck, Springsteen and the E Street Band were at the Hit Factory in New York City recording a session for Gary U.S. Bonds&#x27; album &quot;On the Line&quot;, for which Springsteen had written seven songs and was co-producing with Van Zandt. During the session, the band recorded &quot;Cover Me&quot;, a song Springsteen had written for Donna Summer. His manager-producer Jon Landau convinced Springsteen to keep it for his next album after hearing the finished recording; Springsteen subsequently wrote Summer another song, &quot;Protection&quot;, and recorded a version of that song with the E Street Band.
In April, Springsteen and the E Street Band regrouped at the Power Station to record the demos as full-band versions for release on the next album. Production was handled by Springsteen, Landau, Van Zandt, and &quot;The River&quot; mixer Chuck Plotkin, while Toby Scott returned from the Hit Factory sessions as engineer. The band spent two weeks attempting full-band arrangements of the Colts Neck tracks, including &quot;Nebraska&quot;, &quot;Johnny 99&quot;, and &quot;Mansion on the Hill&quot;, but Springsteen and his co-producers were dissatisfied with the recordings. Plotkin has described the performances with E Street as &quot;less meaningful... less compelling... less honest&quot; than the demo recordings.

Other songs from the tape, including &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;Downbound Train&quot;, &quot;Child Bride&quot; (now rewritten as &quot;Working on the Highway&quot;), and &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;, proved successful in full-band arrangements. According to the author Dave Marsh, the night the band recorded &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; was when &quot;they knew they&#x27;d really begun making an album.&quot; Over the next few weeks into May, the band&#x27;s productivity increased as they recorded material absent from the Colts Neck tape, including &quot;Darlington County&quot;, &quot;Frankie&quot;, &quot;Glory Days&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; Down&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot;, &quot;Johnny Bye-Bye&quot;, &quot;Murder Incorporated&quot;, &quot;My Love Will Not Let You Down&quot;, &quot;A Good Man Is Hard to Find (Pittsburgh)&quot;, &quot;This Hard Land&quot;, &quot;None but the Brave&quot;, and &quot;Wages of Sin&quot;. as well as a new recording of &quot;Cover Me&quot;. According to Weinberg, these sessions featured little rehearsal as the band went through songs without knowing them fully, often in less than five takes.

Despite the band&#x27;s productivity and excitement about the recorded material, Springsteen remained focused on the rest of the Colts Neck songs. Realizing the tracks would not work in full-band arrangements, he decided to release the demos as is. Springsteen briefly considered releasing a double album of acoustic and electric songs before deciding to release the acoustic ones on their own to give them &quot;greater stature&quot;. The album, &quot;Nebraska&quot;, was released in September 1982. It featured nine songs from the original demo tape, and &quot;My Father&#x27;s House&quot;, recorded at Colts Neck in late May. The album sold well, reaching number three in the U.S. and the U.K. charts. According to the pop culture scholar Gillian G. Gaar, music critics praised the album as &quot;a brave artistic statement&quot;. Springsteen himself did not promote the album; he conducted no interviews and, for the first time after an album release, did not tour, instead vacationing on a cross-country road trip to California.

=== Further demos and continued sessions ===
In late 1982, Springsteen and Batlan constructed an eight-track studio in the former&#x27;s new Los Angeles home. There, he spent time recording new demos that were stylistically similar to the &quot;Nebraska&quot; tracks, albeit with a drum machine. Songs demoed from January to April 1983 included &quot;Shut Out the Light&quot;, &quot;Johnny Bye-Bye&quot;, &quot;Cynthia&quot;, &quot;Unsatisfied Heart&quot;, &quot;Sugarland&quot;, &quot;The Klansman&quot;, &quot;My Hometown&quot;, &quot;Delivery Man&quot;, and &quot;Follow That Dream&quot;, a reworking of the 1962 Elvis Presley single of the same name. Like the &quot;Nebraska&quot; tracks, Springsteen felt the new material would not work in a band setting; he considered but ultimately dismissed releasing another solo acoustic album. During this period, Springsteen made numerous lifestyle changes, including therapy and working on his physique with a weight-training program. At the end of April, he departed California and traveled back to New York to record more material with the E Street Band.

Springsteen and the E Street Band resumed recording at the Hit Factory between May and June 1983. These sessions featured re-recordings of solo material Springsteen had recently demoed (&quot;Cynthia&quot; and &quot;My Hometown&quot;), as well as work on other tracks such as &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;, &quot;Car Wash&quot;, &quot;TV Movie&quot;, &quot;Stand on It&quot;, and &quot;County Fair&quot;. These were the first sessions without Van Zandt, who departed the E Street Band in June the year prior and had started a solo career, performing under the name Little Steven. According to the author Fred Goodman, Van Zandt departed due to personal clashes with Landau, although other sources state Van Zandt had felt trapped in the E Street Band and was ready to perform solo. By the summer of 1983, Van Zandt was touring supporting his second solo album, &quot;Voice of America&quot;. Springsteen&#x27;s friendship with Van Zandt inspired the writing of two new songs, &quot;Bobby Jean&quot; and &quot;No Surrender&quot;.

By July 1983, Springsteen and his co-producers had over fifty tracks to choose from for the album, tentatively titled &quot;Murder Incorporated&quot;. The recorded tracks encompassed numerous styles, including R&amp;B (&quot;Lion&#x27;s Den&quot;, &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;), rockabilly (&quot;Stand on It&quot;, &quot;Delivery Man&quot;), hard rock (&quot;Murder Incorporated&quot;, &quot;My Love Will Not Let You Down&quot;), and country and folk (&quot;This Hard Land&quot;, &quot;County Fair&quot;, &quot;None but the Brave&quot;). At the end of July, Springsteen asked Plotkin to develop a rough mix of the album that included &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;Glory Days&quot;, &quot;My Hometown&quot;, &quot;Downbound Train&quot;, &quot;Follow That Dream&quot;, &quot;Shut Out the Light&quot;, &quot;My Love Will Not Let You Down&quot;, and &quot;Sugarland&quot;. Plotkin dismissed the tentative list as &quot;a conceptual mess&quot;; he felt the album should begin with &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, end with &quot;My Hometown&quot;, and include &quot;Working on the Highway&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot;.

=== Final sessions, mixing, and mastering ===

With Springsteen still unsatisfied with the album, recording continued into the new year. Mixing began around this time by Bob Clearmountain, who had mixed &quot;The River&quot; &quot;Hungry Heart&quot;. In October 1983, the band recorded &quot;Bobby Jean&quot; and &quot;No Surrender&quot;, while November yielded &quot;Brothers Under the Bridge&quot; and more unreleased songs, including &quot;Shut Down&quot; and &quot;100 Miles From Jackson&quot;. At this point, Landau had grown tired of the prolonged recording sessions but remained supportive of Springsteen&#x27;s vision. By December, Springsteen and his co-producers had tentatively settled on &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;Glory Days&quot;, &quot;Downbound Train&quot;, and &quot;This Hard Land&quot; as final choices for the album. &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; was decided as the album title by January 1984. The same month, the band recorded &quot;Rockaway the Days&quot; and &quot;Man at the Top&quot;.

In February, Landau felt the album was still missing a lead single that would introduce Springsteen to a new pop audience. After an initial disagreement about the need for another song, Springsteen came in the next day with &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; written; it was recorded shortly after. The sessions ended in March. Springsteen struggled with the final track-list, but was convinced by Landau and Plotkin to stick with a selection of material largely from the May 1982 sessions. He explained in his 2016 autobiography &quot;Born to Run&quot;: &quot;By that time, I&#x27;d recorded a lot of music... But in the end, I circled back to my original groups of songs. There I found a naturalism and aliveness that couldn&#x27;t be argued with. They weren&#x27;t exactly what I&#x27;d been looking for, but they were what I had.&quot; Eleven songs were selected by April. When Van Zandt heard about the final track listing, he urged Springsteen to include &quot;No Surrender&quot;, as he felt it acted as a bridge between Springsteen&#x27;s earlier and current works. Springsteen complied, bringing the final track count to twelve. The album was mastered by Bob Ludwig at Masterdisk in New York City.

===Outtakes===
After over two years of recording, the &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; sessions yielded between 70 and 90 songs. Five were released as B-sides between 1984 and 1985: &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;, &quot;Shut Out the Light&quot;, &quot;Johnny Bye-Bye&quot;, &quot;Stand on It&quot;, and &quot;Janey, Don&#x27;t You Lose Heart&quot;. All five later appeared on the 1998 compilation album &quot;Tracks&quot;. Other outtakes that appeared on &quot;Tracks&quot; included &quot;A Good Man Is Hard to Find (Pittsburgh)&quot;, &quot;Wages of Sin&quot;, &quot;Cynthia&quot;, &quot;My Love Will Not Let You Down&quot;, &quot;This Hard Land&quot;, &quot;Frankie&quot;, &quot;TV Movie&quot;, &quot;Lion&#x27;s Den&quot;, &quot;Car Wash&quot;, &quot;Rockaway the Days&quot;, &quot;Brothers under the Bridge&quot; (titled &quot;Brothers Under the Bridges &#x27;83&quot;), and &quot;Man at the Top&quot;. &quot;Murder Incorporated&quot; was later released on &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1995), while &quot;County Fair&quot; and &quot;None but the Brave&quot; appeared on the limited edition bonus disc of &quot;The Essential Bruce Springsteen&quot; (2003). Songs such as &quot;Sugarland&quot;, &quot;Richfield Whistle&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Back Down&quot;, &quot;Follow That Dream&quot;, &quot;Fugitive&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Little Girl&quot;, &quot;Seven Tears&quot;, and &quot;The Klansman&quot; have appeared on bootlegs.

== Music and lyrics ==
&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; is a rock and roll, heartland rock, and pop album, with elements of folk and rockabilly. The album&#x27;s sound and production have been described as characteristic of mid-1980s mainstream rock, featuring prominent synthesizers, &quot;slamming&quot; guitars, &quot;massive&quot; drums, and &quot;front-and-center&quot; vocals. Some critics noted in 1984 that Springsteen inputted various electronic textures into the album but remained true to his traditional rock and roll roots. The author Geoffrey Himes has written that the album was unified by &quot;pop pleasure&quot;; songs such as &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;Glory Days&quot;, &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; Down&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot; were earworms, featuring melodies and rhythms that &quot;resonated with emotions as basic as lust, loneliness, anger, and yearning and gave them shape&quot;. Most of the songs are built around only two or three chords.
Contrasting with the album&#x27;s livelier sound, &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; continues several of the lyrical themes from Springsteen&#x27;s previous records, particularly &quot;Nebraska&quot;. The author Peter Ames Carlin has written that &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; &quot;filtered the dystopian gloom of the &quot;Nebraska&quot; songs into the living world of love, work, and the hobbled pursuit of happiness.&quot; Springsteen&#x27;s characters are married, in their mid-&#x27;30s, and dealing with parenthood and recession. For AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann, the album is an apotheosis for Springsteen&#x27;s reoccurring characters, where for the first time ever, the characters &quot;really seemed to relish the fight and to have something to fight for&quot;. Following their journeys through Springsteen&#x27;s first six albums, from being &quot;romantic young boys&quot; to living &quot;the working life&quot; to &quot;fac[ing] despair&quot; on &quot;Nebraska&quot;, the characters on his seventh album were alive &quot;with their sense of humor and their determination intact&quot;. Like Ruhlmann, on &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; other critics have likewise heard humor, or optimism: for &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; Gabriel Fine, the album seems to argue that &quot;one can both love America and rage against its brokenness&quot;. By contrast, the main theme throughout &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; for Stephen Holden is &quot;the decline of small-town working class life in a post-industrial society&quot;. Holden noted that against the mostly upbeat music is &quot;a sad and serious album about the end of the American dream – of economic hope and security, and of community – for a dwindling segment of our society.&quot;

===Side one===

&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; is an energetic, rock and roll song driven by synthesizer and pounding drums. A protest song, it dissects the cruel mistreatment of Vietnam veterans upon their return home after the war. The song&#x27;s message is widely regarded as misunderstood, as many Americans, including president Ronald Reagan, interpreted it as a patriotic anthem; several critics also noted how the song could be misconstrued in favor of jingoism. Margotin and Guesdon discuss the juxtaposition of the verses, which express &quot;the somber reality of a soldier&quot;, with the chorus, which &quot;loudly and proudly proclaims the glory of American civilization&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Mike DeGayne argued that while the song would have been effective as an acoustic ballad, similar to &quot;My Hometown&quot; or &quot;Nebraska&quot; &quot;Atlantic City&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s the fervor and the might of Springsteen in front of a bombastic array of guitar and drums that help to drive his message home&quot;.

&quot;Cover Me&quot; is a straightforward rock song, with elements of pop, disco, and funk. Lyrically, it describes a love story wherein the narrator, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, pleas for his lover to stay with him and protect him from the outside world. &quot;Darlington County&quot; is an upbeat rock song that some critics compared to the music of Creedence Clearwater Revival. It tells the story of two New York friends who embark on a road trip. Upon their arrival in Darlington, South Carolina, they plan to find jobs but instead spend their time with women. The author Rob Kirkpatrick said the song was &quot;steeped in countrified blue-collarism&quot;.

&quot;Working on the Highway&quot; is a rockabilly track that sets upbeat music against more downbeat lyrics. It tells the story of a man who runs away to Florida with an underage girl against her father&#x27;s wishes. When he gets there, he gets arrested and sentenced to forced labor on a highway. Originally &quot;Child Bride&quot; from the &quot;Nebraska&quot; demo tape, the final track retains the same story and several lines from the original lyrics.

&quot;Downbound Train&quot; is a minimalist rock ballad featuring a synthesizer. Called the album&#x27;s saddest song by &quot;Billboard&quot; Caryn Rose, the lyrics include themes of disillusionment and loss. It follows a man who has lost everything: after being laid off from his lumberyard job, his wife leaves him, after which he struggles to make a living working at a car wash. Distressed, he dreams of his now ex-wife. The song&#x27;s narrator is similar to the ones on &quot;Nebraska&quot; and &quot;Stolen Car&quot; from &quot;The River&quot;. &quot;Downbound Train&quot; originated from a &quot;Nebraska&quot; demo called &quot;Son You May Kiss the Bride&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot; is a minimalist ballad whose instrumentation consists of picked guitar, synthesizer, and brushed drums. Musically inspired by Johnny Cash, the song is an ode to adulterous lust, in which the narrator expresses an obsessive and uncontrollable desire for the heroine. Analyzing the song&#x27;s placement in the track listing at the end of side one, Fine wrote that the song leaves &quot;a hushed, solemn interlude in the center of a mostly upbeat, ebullient album&quot;, further arguing that &quot;it seems symbolic, both structurally and musically, as if marking a turning point in Springsteen&#x27;s career from middle-America heartland rocker to synth- and dance-influenced mainstream star.&quot;

===Side two===

&quot;No Surrender&quot; is an upbeat 1950s/1960s-style rock song with a &quot;dense, rich, and heavy sound&quot;. Lyrically, the song is a statement of friendship, freedom, and &quot;youthful defiance with allusions to blood brotherhood and forced warlike metaphors&quot;. The song is complemented by &quot;Bobby Jean&quot;, another song about friendship. In it, the narrator visits the childhood home of the title character, causing his memories of them to come back in a nostalgic tone. Commentators have interpreted the title character&#x27;s gender as intentionally ambiguous and could refer to the name of any close friend the singer had known since he was a teenager. Musically, it is a rock and roll ballad with an accented rhythm and near-dance groove. Both &quot;No Surrender&quot; and &quot;Bobby Jean&quot; have been described as tributes to Steven Van Zandt and his friendship with Springsteen.

&quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; Down&quot; is a rock song with elements of rockabilly. Its upbeat music contrasts with the lyrics, which tell a melancholic story about a couple on the verge of a break-up. The narrator&#x27;s girlfriend has lost her passion and turned to indifference. &quot;Glory Days&quot; is an energetic synth-rock song that follows a protagonist speaking with old high-school classmates – a former baseball star and a popular girl now divorced with two kids – in a bar reflecting on the &quot;glory days&quot; of their youth with sadness. It was partially based on a true story of Springsteen meeting an old friend at a bar who had had the potential to become a professional baseball player in the early 1970s. Commentators have argued the song opposes nostalgia rather than embracing it, as the protagonist pities the former high-school heroes.

&quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; is an upbeat synth-pop and dance-rock song led by synthesizer. Its protagonist struggles with life – he is bored with himself, cannot look at himself in a mirror, and feels trapped – and wants to change his daily routine by finding a spark that will reignite his imagination. He asks his romantic partner to help him find the &quot;spark&quot;, as for now the two live life &quot;without a purpose&quot;, or &quot;dancing in the dark&quot;. Kirkpatrick argued the song examines its author&#x27;s creative process, showing Springsteen struggling to live up to expectations as both a songwriter and a performer. The song ends with a jazzy saxophone solo from Clemons.

&quot;My Hometown&quot; is a folk ballad driven by a synthesizer. Throughout its four verses, the narrator grows up and experiences hardship living in his hometown. Based on Springsteen&#x27;s personal experiences in his own hometown growing up in the 1960s, the song returns to the social issues present throughout the album&#x27;s first side, with themes centered on working-class life, racial tensions, violence, and economic strife. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Sam Sodomsky argued the song &quot;captures what &#x27;Born in the U.S.A.&#x27; failed to: the tragedy of the American dream, the brutality and injustice that is fundamental to American citizenship, and the complicated, intractable love for one&#x27;s home that still manages to take root in the midst of it all.&quot;

== Artwork ==
The cover photograph depicts Springsteen standing with his back to the camera against the stripes of an American flag. He is wearing a white T-shirt and jeans, with a red baseball cap tucked into his right back pocket; the cap belonged to the recently deceased father of Springsteen&#x27;s friend Lance Larson. Springsteen has said that the flag was included on the cover because the first track was called &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; and the record&#x27;s overarching theme reflected his writing of the past six or seven years. It was initially controversial; some commentators believed Springsteen was urinating on the flag, which Springsteen asserted was inaccurate, telling Kurt Loder in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that &quot;the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face&quot; and that there was no &quot;secret message&quot;. The cover, designed by Andrea Klein, is one of a small number of Springsteen&#x27;s studio album covers to not feature his face, alongside &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot; (1973), &quot;Nebraska&quot;, &quot;Human Touch&quot; (1992), &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; (1995), and &quot;Western Stars&quot; (2019).

The photograph was taken by the rock photographer Annie Leibovitz, formerly of the magazines &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. Leibovitz herself did not like the photo, referring to it as a &quot;grab shot&quot;. Other photographs shot by Leibovitz were used for other promotional materials, such as the &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; single cover (capturing Springsteen jumping mid-air wearing a blue shirt, black leather jacket, and black pants) and the Born in the U.S.A. Tour&#x27;s program (depicting Springsteen jumping in front of the American flag yielding a guitar in a Pete Townshend-like windmill pose).

The inside of the sleeve contains a black-and-white photograph of Springsteen, another of him with the E Street Band, and song lyrics. The sleeve also includes Springsteen&#x27;s farewell words to Van Zandt written in Italian: &quot;Buon viaggio, mia fratello, Little Steven&quot; (&quot;Safe travels, my brother, Little Steven&quot;). The cover has appeared on &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; lists of the 100 best album covers of all time at numbers 31 and 42, respectively.

== Release and promotion ==
Columbia Records released &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; on June 4, 1984. The album was the first compact disc manufactured in the United States for commercial release. It was manufactured by CBS (Columbia&#x27;s international distributor) and Sony Music at their newly opened plant, Digital Audio Disc Corporation, in Terre Haute, Indiana in September; Columbia&#x27;s CDs were previously manufactured in Japan.

&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; debuted at number nine on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 Albums chart during the week of June 23, 1984, topping the chart two weeks later on July 7. It stayed in the top 10 for 84 consecutive weeks and on the chart itself for almost three years. It was also a commercial success in Europe and Oceania. In the United Kingdom, the album entered the UK Albums Chart at number two on June 16, and after thirty-four weeks, on February 16, 1985, it reached number one and topped the chart for five non consecutive weeks; it was present on the chart for 135 weeks. It also topped the album charts in Australia, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. The album reached number two in France, Italy, Spain, and on the European Top 100 Albums chart. It also reached number six in Japan.

&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; was the best-selling album of 1985 and of Springsteen&#x27;s career. It is one of the best-selling albums of all time, with worldwide sales of over 30 million copies. It was certified three times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in July 1985, denoting shipments of 900,000 units in the U.K. After the advent of the North American Nielsen SoundScan tracking system in 1991, the album sold an additional 1,463,000 copies, and in May 2022, it was certified seventeen times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 17 million copies in the US.

===Singles===
By 1984, the music industry had become reliant on singles and music videos for success following the rise of MTV in the U.S. With the success of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; (1982), record labels wanted to turn albums into &quot;mega-albums&quot;. The music industry historian Steve Kropper has said that &quot;Thriller&quot; created a &quot;video-driven blueprint&quot; to keep an album high in the charts for at least an entire year. Springsteen and Landau had only envisioned one or two singles from &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;. Feeling otherwise, Columbia planned &quot;at least half a dozen&quot; possible singles, each accompanied by dance remixes and music videos to broaden airplay, both on the radio and in clubs. Sodomsky later wrote: &quot;MTV had evolved into a legitimate arm of the music industry, and Springsteen&#x27;s new look [muscular with a bandana] helped him gain traction in an image-centric medium.&quot; Springsteen also conducted interviews with media outlets including &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.
&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; was supported by a record-tying seven top ten singles. The first, &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; with &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot; on the B-side, was released on May 9, 1984. It peaked at number two on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and spent 21 weeks on the chart. Elsewhere, it topped the singles charts in Canada, the Netherlands, and Belgium, and also reached number four in the U.K. The 12&quot; single featured three dance remixes of &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; by the producer Arthur Baker; it was the best-selling 12&quot; single of the year. &quot;Cover Me&quot;, featuring a 1981 live recording of Tom Waits&#x27; &quot;Jersey Girl&quot; as the B-side, was released as the second single on July 31. It spent 18 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reaching number seven, as well as number two on &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart. A dance remix by Baker appeared on a 12&quot; single. &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, backed by &quot;Shut Out the Light&quot;, was issued as the third single on October 30. It spent 17 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reaching number nine. Elsewhere, it topped the charts in Ireland and New Zealand, and peaked at number two in Australia, and number five in the U.K. A dance remix by Baker appeared on a 12&quot; single in January 1985.

&quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot;, backed by &quot;Johnny Bye-Bye&quot;, was released as the fourth single on February 6, 1985. It peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and remained on the chart for 20 weeks. &quot;Glory Days&quot; followed on May 13, with &quot;Stand On It&quot; as the B-side. It spent 18 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number five. The sixth single, &quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; Down&quot;, was issued on August 27, backed by &quot;Janey, Don&#x27;t You Lose Heart&quot;. It reached number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and also charted in Sweden and Italy. The seventh and final single, &quot;My Hometown&quot;, was released on November 21, with a 1975 live recording of the Christmas song &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot; as the B-side. It reached numbers six and nine in the U.S. and the U.K., respectively. CBS compiled the three extended dance remixes, two other singles, the five exclusive B-sides, and several songs from Springsteen&#x27;s previous albums for release on &quot;The Born in the U.S.A. 12&quot; Single Collection&quot; in the U.K. in 1985.

===Music videos===

Five of the album&#x27;s seven singles were supported with music videos. The video for &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot;, Springsteen&#x27;s first true music video, depicts a live performance of the song by Springsteen and the E Street Band. Directed by Brian De Palma, it was shot at the St. Paul Civic Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on June 28 and 29, 1984. In the video, Springsteen pulls a young fan, played by the then-unknown actress Courteney Cox, on stage to dance; Springsteen recreated the bit frequently with young female fans throughout the tour. De Palma&#x27;s video introduced Springsteen to the MTV generation and helped Springsteen reach the audience he had always wanted since his signing to Columbia in 1972. The filmmaker John Sayles directed the videos for &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot;, and &quot;Glory Days&quot;. For the title track, Sayles interspersed concert footage of Springsteen singing the song, shot in Los Angeles in 1984, with footage of small-town America.

&quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot; was Springsteen&#x27;s first narrative video, starring Springsteen himself as an auto mechanic captivated by an unseen young woman in a white dress. The video won the award for Best Male Video at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1985. The video for &quot;Glory Days&quot; starred Springsteen as the song&#x27;s titular baseball player, working on a construction site and practicing baseball pitches alone, reflecting on his &quot;glory days&quot;. It transitions to a performance of the song at a club with the E Street Band, featuring both Steven Van Zandt and his replacement guitarist Nils Lofgren, alongside new backing vocalist Patti Scialfa. The video ends with Springsteen&#x27;s character playing a game of catch with his son until his wife, played by Springsteen&#x27;s first wife Julianne Phillips, picks them up. The video for &quot;My Hometown&quot; depicts a live performance of the song. It was directed by Arthur Rosato and was shot towards the end of the tour at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
== Critical reception ==
&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; received favorable reviews from music critics on release. The album was praised as an accessible record with new musical elements that a few, including Robert Hilburn and Sandy Robertson, believed would please longtime fans and attract new ones. Writing for Shreveport, Louisiana&#x27;s &quot;The Times&quot;, Marshall Fine wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s a superb effort, an album of rich musical and lyrical textures that can only enhance Springsteen&#x27;s reputation as a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll original.&quot; Some critics described &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; as a more accessible version of &quot;Nebraska&quot;, one that is more easily digestible for a wider audience. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Debby Miller said &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; was as well thought-out as &quot;Nebraska&quot;, but with more sophistication and spirit.

Springsteen&#x27;s storytelling drew particular attention; Miller saw Springsteen creating &quot;such a vivid sense of these characters&quot; by &quot;[giving] them voices a playwright would be proud of&quot;. &quot;Cash Box&quot; anticipated &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; would find success on album-oriented rock radio due to Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;special&quot; ability to convey the lyrical messages of every song. &quot;Saturday Review&quot; John Swenson commended Springsteen for &quot;championing traditional rock values at a time when few newer bands show interest in such a direction&quot;, while Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; praised his evolution as an artist. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden highlighted Springsteen as &quot;one of a very small number of rock performers who uses rock to express an ongoing epic vision of [America], individual social roots and the possibility of heroic self-creation.&quot; Others praised the instrumentation, Springsteen&#x27;s vocal performances, and the performances of the E Street Band.

Not all reviews were positive. Several reviewers criticized the use of similar lyrical themes as prior albums; Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;The problem is that Springsteen&#x27;s taken us down these mean sidestreets and through these badlands all too often since 1978&#x27;s &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot;.&quot; Robertson took less issue with the similar themes, arguing that Springsteen was &quot;polishing and perfecting his craft&quot;, making &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; his best work yet. Other critics, such as Harrington and &quot;NME&quot; Charles Shaar Murray, were more negative, calling the music &quot;deadly dull&quot; and &quot;dry&quot;, respectively. Harrington said that &quot;Springsteen has become a brooding, boorish visionary, with no respite of working class advocacy or the resilient spirit of youth,&quot; while Carr argued: &quot;By abandoning all that &#x27;rebel triumphant&#x27; blabber&#x27;n smoke, Springsteen displays the kind of moral and artistic integrity that rock music rarely shows any more.&quot; He summarized: &quot;No-one&#x27;s going to get high on fantasy or rebellion from listening to &quot;Born in the U.S.A&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; was voted the best album of the year in the 1984 Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll. Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator, also ranked it number one on his list and in 1990 named it the ninth-best album of the 1980s. &quot;NME&quot;, in their end-of-the-year list, placed it at number two, behind Bobby Womack&#x27;s &quot;The Poet II&quot;. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Springsteen and the E Street Band won artist and band of the year, album of the year for &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, and single and music video of the year for &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot;. At the 27th Annual Grammy Awards in 1985, &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, while &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; was nominated for Record of the Year and won the award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male. &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; was nominated for Record of the Year at the following year&#x27;s ceremony.

==Tour==
Springsteen and the E Street Band supported &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, which ran 156 concerts from June 29, 1984, to October 2, 1985. Rehearsals began in early May 1984. By that point, the E Street Band had not performed together in two and a half years. The lineup included returning members Bittan, Clemons, Tallent, Federici, Weinberg; Nils Lofgren, who replaced Van Zandt as a second guitarist; and Patti Scialfa, who was hired by Springsteen as a backing vocalist four days before the tour began. Springsteen reworked his image to be &quot;highly masculinized&quot; for the tour; he wore sleeveless shirts to show off his new muscular physique, was clean-shaven, and held his curly hair up with a bandana.

The tour began in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where the video for &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; was filmed. With over sixty unperformed songs in Springsteen&#x27;s repertoire since the end of the River Tour, the shows consisted of material throughout Springsteen&#x27;s whole career. &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; or &quot;Thunder Road&quot; (1975) often started the shows, after which the first set typically consisted of older material (including songs from &quot;Nebraska&quot;). The second set primarily included songs written after &quot;Nebraska&quot; release, such as &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot;, &quot;No Surrender&quot;, and &quot;Bobby Jean&quot;. Unlike previous tours, the setlists for the Born in the U.S.A. Tour typically remained the same every night, with few exceptions.

Springsteen attracted political attention during the initial U.S. leg when the conservative political commentator George Will attended the show in Largo, Maryland, on August 25. Will published a column in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; about Springsteen the following month, wherein he praised the performer&#x27;s work ethic and discussed his &quot;presumed patriotism&quot; with the usage of the phrase &quot;born in the U.S.A.&quot; Less than a week after the column&#x27;s publishing, president Ronald Reagan, in the middle of his reelection campaign, praised Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;patriotism&quot; during a campaign rally in Hammonton, New Jersey. Springsteen himself dismissively responded to Reagan&#x27;s comments two days later during a show in Pittsburgh, and from around this time began talking more frequently at his shows about his socialist ideology; from November he additionally started donating some concert proceeds to local charities or community organizations. Springsteen was also compared to the Sylvester Stallone character John Rambo in an opinion piece by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Paul Galloway, published in August 1985, who argued the two muscle-bounded figures positively represented America&#x27;s strength.

The initial American leg of the tour ran through January 1985. During the break, Springsteen participated in the recording of the charity single &quot;We Are the World&quot; with other recording artists including Huey Lewis, Michael Jackson, and Lionel Richie. The tour continued from late March to July around the world with shows in Australia, Japan, Europe, and the U.K. Springsteen married his first wife Julianne Phillips in May, between the Oceania and European legs. The European leg drew large crowds, including a 100,000 attendance in Ireland and three sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium in London. The final U.S. leg ran from August to October 2, ending with four consecutive shows at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The tour&#x27;s massive success led to the creation of Springsteen&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Live 1975–85&quot;, released in November 1986.

Springsteen and the E Street Band performed the full &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; album during a show at the Hard Rock Calling Festival in London at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park on June 30, 2013. A DVD of the full performance, titled &quot;Born in the U.S.A. Live: London 2013&quot;, was packaged with Amazon pre-orders of Springsteen&#x27;s 18th studio album &quot;High Hopes&quot; in January 2014.

==Legacy==
===Impact on Springsteen===
&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; made Springsteen a superstar and brought him his largest amount of success to date as a recording and performing artist, touching off a wave of what the author Chris Smith termed &quot;Bossmania&quot;. Although he had been a well-known star before its release, Larry Rodgers wrote in &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; that &quot;it was not until he hit the gym to get buffed up and showed off his rear end in [the] cover photo for &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; that he became an American pop icon&quot;. The author Bryan K. Garman suggested that this new image helped Springsteen popularize his persona on a new scale, while tying him to certain political and socio-cultural issues, at a time when Ronald Reagan was promoting prosperity and U.S. global influence &quot;within a decidedly masculine framework&quot;. &quot;Stereogum&quot; Ryan Leas later called the album &quot;one of the defining records of the &#x27;80s&quot;.
Despite &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; commercial success, Springsteen was initially wary of his newfound fame and attention. He later expressed reservations about the album, writing in his 2003 book &quot;Songs&quot;, &quot;I put a lot of pressure on myself over a long period of time to reproduce the intensity of &quot;Nebraska&quot; on &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; I never got it.&quot; He further felt the title track &quot;more or less stood by itself&quot; and that &quot;the rest of the album contains a group of songs about which I&#x27;ve always had some ambivalence&quot;. Gabriel Fine argued that a &quot;central&quot; part of the album&#x27;s legacy is the title track&#x27;s misunderstood message and the &quot;struggle&quot; to make that message clear. According to Kirkpatrick, the album&#x27;s legacy is complicated for longtime fans due to its large success and Springsteen&#x27;s public image of &quot;muscular patriotism&quot; that surrounded its release and accompanying tour. The album also created a generational divide between older and newer fans.

The album&#x27;s success ultimately influenced Springsteen&#x27;s career trajectory for the rest of the 1980s and 1990s. In response to his newfound fame, Springsteen attempted to scale himself back to be viewed as a &quot;normal&quot; middle-aged singer-songwriter. He later described the Born in the U.S.A. Tour as representing the end of the first phase of his career, believing he created an &quot;icon&quot; image that was not true to himself. For &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; (1987), the follow-up to &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, he recorded most of the parts himself using a synthesizer and wrote lyrics about love, romantic commitment, and married life. He used the E Street Band sparingly on the album before disbanding the group in 1989. In the 1990s, Springsteen ignored dominant music trends, such as grunge and alternative rock, as he created the music he wanted to make despite being aware of the potential commercial shortcomings. His albums during this period, &quot;Human Touch&quot;, &quot;Lucky Town&quot; (both 1992), and &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; (1995), suffered commercially as a result. The author Steven Hyden argues that it was not until his and the E Street Band&#x27;s Reunion Tour from 1999 to 2000, and the accompanying &quot;Live in New York City&quot; film and live album, that Springsteen re-established himself as a cultural icon. The following album, &quot;The Rising&quot; (2002), was his first full-length album with the E Street Band since &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; and his first to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 since &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;.

===Influence===
&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; helped popularize American heartland rock. By 1985, the album had boosted the profiles of other heartland rock artists and their albums, such as John Mellencamp (&quot;Scarecrow&quot;), Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (&quot;Southern Accents&quot;), Dire Straits (&quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;), and Bob Seger. Mellencamp, in particular, was accused at the time of being a pale imitation of Springsteen. &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; also helped establish synthesizers as a key component of the 1980s rock sound. Older artists who found success in this style included Don Henley (&quot;Building the Perfect Beast&quot;), Robbie Robertson (&quot;Robbie Robertson&quot;), and Bob Dylan (&quot;Empire Burlesque&quot;). According to Hyden, in his book &quot;There Was Nothing You Could Do: Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; and the End of the Heartland&quot;, which dissects &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; and its impact forty years after its original release, the album served as an influence for later rock bands who wanted to mimic the album&#x27;s power and impact, such as the Killers with &quot;Sam&#x27;s Town&quot; (2006), Arcade Fire with &quot;The Suburbs&quot; (2010), the War on Drugs with &quot;Lost in the Dream&quot; (2014), and Sam Fender with &quot;Hypersonic Missiles&quot; (2019).

===Retrospective reviews===
In later decades, &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; has generally been regarded as one of Springsteen&#x27;s best records. Himes argued that &quot;as a total package&quot;, &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; is Springsteen&#x27;s best album. Sodomsky called it &quot;the bold, brilliant, and misunderstood apex of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s imperial era&quot;. Hyden describes &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; as Springsteen&#x27;s most iconic album in the pop-culture zeitgeist and the one that defines his persona &quot;in the broadest sense&quot;. The music journalist Matty Karas regarded it as &quot;a quintessential pop album that was also a perfect distillation of the anger and bitterness seething beneath the surface of Reagan-era America.&quot; Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; stated: &quot;&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; remains the most tightly honed of Springsteen&#x27;s albums,&quot; one that unifies the &quot;two disparate strands of &quot;The River&quot;&quot; and &quot;comes up with something that manages to be both angry and celebratory, often in the same song&quot;.

The album still attracts mixed assessments. While one critic felt the album aged well into the 2000s, others have felt that its production dates it to the 1980s, but maintained that it added &quot;historical value&quot; and that the quality of the songs made up for it. Writing in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, Colin Larkin described &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; as an example of an artist&#x27;s best-selling work not being their best creative or artistic work. More negatively, &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s journalist Richard Williams criticized Springsteen&#x27;s exaggeration of his usual characters and themes in a deliberate attempt at commercial success. He accused the singer of trying to &quot;exploit the American flag&quot; and &quot;to bury the anti-war message of &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; beneath an impenetrable layer of clenched-fist bombast&quot;, which he felt was &quot;downright irresponsible&quot;.

===Rankings===
&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; has appeared on several best-of lists. In 1987, &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; was voted the fifth greatest rock album of all time in Paul Gambaccini&#x27;s &quot;Critic&#x27;s Choice&quot; poll of 81 critics, writers, and radio broadcasters. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; number 85 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, 86 in a 2012 revised list, and 142 in a 2020 revised list. In 2013, it was named the 428th greatest album in a similar list published by &quot;NME&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. The album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2012. The same year, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine ranked it the fourth best album of the 1980s. In 2015, &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; included it on a list compiling the best rock albums of the 1980s.

==Reissues==
&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; was first reissued by Columbia on CD in 2000, followed by an LP and CD reissue by Sony BMG in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In 2015, Sony Music released a remastered version of the album on both LP and CD. On June 14, 2024, Sony Music reissued the album again on translucent red vinyl, featuring a booklet with new sleeve notes by Springsteen&#x27;s archivist Erik Flannigan and a lithograph to mark its 40th anniversary.

<doc id="67584" wikidata="Q8071" url="?curid=67584" title="Economy of Andorra">
<text>The economy of Andorra is a developed and free market economy driven by finance, retail, and tourism. The country&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) was US$6.00 billion in 2024. Attractive for shoppers from France and Spain as a free port, Andorra also has developed active summer and winter tourist resorts. With some 270 hotels and 400 restaurants, as well as many shops, the tourist trade employs a growing portion of the domestic labour force. An estimated 10 million tourists visit annually.

There is a fairly active trade in consumer goods, including imported manufactured items, which, because they are duty-free, are less expensive in Andorra than in neighboring countries. Andorra&#x27;s duty-free status also has had a significant effect on the controversy concerning its relationship with the European Union (EU). Its negotiations on duty-free status and relationship with the EU began in 1987, soon after Spain joined. An agreement that went into effect in July 1991 sets duty-free quotas and places limits on certain items – mainly milk products, tobacco products and alcoholic beverages. Andorra is permitted to maintain price differences from other EU countries, and visitors enjoy limited duty-free allowances.

The results of Andorra&#x27;s elections thus far indicate that many support the government&#x27;s reform initiatives and believe the country must, to some degree, integrate into the European Union in order to continue to enjoy its prosperity. Although arable land comprises less than 2% of the country, agriculture was the mainstay of the Andorran economy until the upsurge in tourism. Sheep raising has been the principal agricultural activity, but tobacco growing is lucrative. Most of Andorra&#x27;s food is imported.

In addition to handicrafts, manufacturing includes cigars, cigarettes and furniture for domestic and export markets. A hydroelectric plant at Les Escaldes, with a capacity of 26.5 megawatts, provides 40% of Andorra&#x27;s electricity; Spain provides the rest.

==Overview==
Tourism is the mainstay of Andorra&#x27;s economy, accounting for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra&#x27;s duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra&#x27;s comparative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its &quot;tax haven&quot; status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars and furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs).

<text>The telephone system in Andorra, including mobile, data and Internet is operated exclusively by the Andorran national telecommunications company, Andorra Telecom, formerly known as Servei de Telecomunicacions d&#x27;Andorra (STA). The same company is also responsible for managing the technical infrastructure and national broadcasting networks for radio and television, both analogue and digital.

At one time, Andorra shared the country code of France (+33), and also had a special routing code for calls from Spain, but now has its own country calling code, 376.

==Internet==
Internet access is available only through the national telephone company, Andorra Telecom (formerly STA). Access was first provided in the 1990s by dial-up, but this has since been mostly replaced throughout the country by ADSL at a fixed speed of 2 Mbit/s, and in metropolitan areas of the country by fibre to the home at a fixed speed of 100 Mbit/s. The average cost of a high-speed internet connection is €35.35. The whole country was to have Fibre-Optic to the Home at a minimum speed of 100 Mbit/s by 2010, and the availability was complete in June 2012 although actual available bandwidth to the end user never exceeds 10 Mbit/s.

<text>Andorra is a landlocked country in Europe, which lies between France and Spain, whose transport infrastructure is primarily road provision.

==Railways==
Andorra has no railways, and never had, although the line connecting Latour-de-Carol and Toulouse, which in turn connects to France&#x27;s TGVs at Toulouse, runs within of the Andorran border. One station in France is connected by bus to Andorra la Vella — L&#x27;Hospitalet-près-l&#x27;Andorre (served by the SNCF). A bus service used to run to Latour-de-Carol, served by both SNCF&#x27;s line to Toulouse and Spain&#x27;s (Renfe&#x27;s) line to Barcelona.

A new public transport system, &quot;Metro Aeri&quot;, was proposed by the government in 2004, but has not been built. It would have been an elevated cable metro system that would glide above the city&#x27;s river.

==Roads==

Andorra has a network of roads, with a total length of , of which are paved, leaving of unpaved road. The main road to the north (France) goes through the Envalira pass, which is high but nevertheless open all year round as it has a tunnel as well. The two main roads out of Andorra la Vella are the CG-1 to the Spanish border, and the CG-2 to the French border via the Envalira Tunnel near Pas de la Casa. In winter, the main roads in Andorra are usually quickly cleared of snow and remain accessible, but the main road out of Andorra on the French side (RN-20 on the French side and CG-2 on the Andorran side) is less frequently cleared and is sometimes closed by avalanches. Other main roads out of Andorra la Vella are the CG-3 and CG-4 to Arcalis and Pal, respectively. 

Bus services cover all metropolitan areas and many rural communities, with services on most major routes running half-hourly or more frequently during peak travel times. There are frequent long-distance bus services from Andorra to Barcelona and Barcelona Airport, and also to Toulouse and Toulouse Airport, in each case taking approximately 3 hours. Bus routes also serve Girona Airport and Portugal via Lleida. Bus services are mostly run by private companies, but some local ones are operated by the government. The private bus companies are Autocars Nadal, Camino Bus, Cooperativa Interurbana Andorrana, Eurolines, Hispano Andorrana, and Novatel.

==Airways==

There are no airports for fixed-wing aircraft within Andorra&#x27;s borders but there are, however, heliports in La Massana (Camí Heliport), Arinsal and Escaldes–Engordany with commercial helicopter services. 

Nearby airports located in Spain and France provide access to international flights for the Principality. There is an airport located in the neighbouring Catalan comarca of Alt Urgell, 12 km south of the Andorran-Spanish border, named Andorra–La Seu d&#x27;Urgell Airport. Starting July 2015 it has operated commercial flights to Madrid and Palma de Mallorca, and as of September 2022 flight are operated to Madrid by Iberia Regional. 

The nearest other airports are at Perpignan, France (156 km from Andorra) and Lleida, Spain (160 km from Andorra). The largest nearby airports are at Toulouse, France (165 km from Andorra) and Barcelona, Spain (215 km from Andorra). There are hourly bus services from both the Barcelona and Toulouse airports to Andorra.

<doc id="67594" wikidata="Q4819938" url="?curid=67594" title="Surrealist techniques">
<text>Surrealism in art, poetry, and literature uses numerous techniques and games to provide inspiration. Many of these are said to free imagination by producing a creative process free of conscious control. The importance of the unconscious as a source of inspiration is central to the nature of surrealism.

The Surrealist movement has been a fractious one since its inception. The value and role of the various techniques has been one of many subjects of disagreement. Some Surrealists consider automatism and games to be sources of inspiration only, while others consider them starting points for finished works. Others consider the items created through automatism to be finished works themselves, needing no further refinement.

==Aerography==
Aerography is a technique in which a 3-dimensional object is used as a stencil with spraypainting. Both conceptually and technically the airbrush painting method presented a new point of departure from a traditional way of painting. Man Ray recalled, &quot;(…) It was thrilling to paint a picture, hardly touching the surface - a purely cerebral act, as it were.&quot;

==Automatism==
Automatism was used in different ways for each art: 
* Automatic drawing
* Automatic painting
* Automatic writing
* Automatic poetry is poetry written using the automatic method. It has probably been the chief surrealist method from the founding of surrealism to the present day. One of the oddest uses of automatic writing by a great writer was that of W. B. Yeats; his wife, a spiritualist, practised it, and Yeats put large chunks of it into his prose work, &quot;A Vision&quot; and much of his later poetry, but Yeats was not a surrealist. In French surrealism, André Breton and Philippe Soupault were often considered as the pioneers of this technique with their collection Les Champs magnétiques (1919), who claimed to be the first collection only written through the automatic method : but recent studies have proven the manuscripts showed many variants and corrections throughout the poems.

The Czech writer Bohumil Hrabal used the method of automatic text in his famous book &quot;I Served the King of England&quot;. One chapter in the book is written as a single sentence, and at the end of the book Hrabal endorses the use of automatic writing.

==Bulletism==

Bulletism is shooting ink at a blank piece of paper. The artist can then develop images based on what is seen.

==Calligram==

A calligram is a text or poem of a type in which the words or letters make up a shape, particularly a shape connected to the subject of the text or poem. The concept was developed by Guillaume Apollinaire in his 1918 collection &quot;Calligrammes&quot;.

==Collage==


Collage is the assemblage of different forms creating a new whole. For example, an artistic collage work may include newspaper clippings, ribbons, bits of colored or hand-made papers, photographs, etc., glued to a solid support or canvas. Tearing papers can suggest an act of artistic experience, connoting an emotional or creative crisis.

==Coulage==
A coulage is a kind of automatic or involuntary sculpture made by pouring a molten material (such as metal, wax, chocolate or white chocolate) into cold water. As the material cools it takes on what appears to be a random (or aleatoric) form, though the physical properties of the materials involved may lead to a conglomeration of discs or spheres. The artist may use a variety of techniques to affect the outcome.

This technique is also used in the divination process known as ceromancy.

==Cubomania==
Cubomania is a method of making collages in which a picture or image is cut into squares and the squares are then reassembled without regard for the image. The technique was first used by the Romanian surrealist Gherasim Luca.

==Cut-up technique==

Cut-up technique is a literary form or method in which a text is cut up at random and rearranged to create a new text.

==Decalcomania==

Decalcomania is a process of spreading thick paint upon a canvas then—while it is still wet—covering it with further material such as paper or aluminium foil. This covering is then removed (again before the paint dries), and the resultant paint pattern becomes the basis of the finished painting. The technique was much employed by artists such as Max Ernst.

==Dream résumé==
The dream résumé takes the form of an employment résumé but chronicles its subject&#x27;s achievements, employment, or the like, in dreams, rather than in waking life. Sometimes dream résumés contain the achievements of both, however.

==Echo poem==
An echo poem is a poem written using a technique invented by Aurélien Dauguet in 1972. The poem is composed by one or more persons, working together in a process as follows.

The first &quot;stanza&quot; of the poem is written on the left-hand column of a piece of paper divided into two columns. Then the &quot;opposite&quot;, or &#x27;echo&#x27;, of the first stanza, in whatever sense is appropriate to the poem, is composed in the right-hand column of the page. The writing is done automatically and often the &quot;opposite&quot; stanza is composed of a phonetic correspondence to the first stanza.

For a longer work, the third stanza can then begin in the left-hand column as an &quot;opposite&quot; or a phonetic correspondence to what preceded it in the right-hand column. Then the fourth stanza might be an &quot;opposite&quot; or sound correspondence to what preceded it in the left-hand column, and so forth. When the poem is completed, the echo of the last phrase, line, or sentence, generally serves as the title.

This is unrelated to the non-Surrealist echo verse form which appears as a dialogue between the questions of a character and the answers of the nymph Echo.

==Éclaboussure==
Éclaboussure is a process in Surrealist painting where oil paints or watercolours are laid down and water or turpentine is splattered, then soaked up to reveal random splatters or dots where the media was removed. This technique gives the appearance of space and atmosphere. It was used in paintings by Remedios Varo.

==Entopic graphomania==
Entopic graphomania is a surrealist and automatic method of drawing in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and lines are then made between the dots; these can be either &quot;curved lines... or straight lines&quot;. Ithell Colquhoun described its results as &quot;the most austere kind of geometric abstraction.&quot; The technique aims to stimulate creative process and subconscious associations. It is to be distinguished from &quot;entoptic&quot; methods of drawing or art-making, inspired by entoptic phenomena.

The method was invented by Dolfi Trost, who as the subtitle of his 1945 book (&quot;Vision dans le cristal. Oniromancie obsessionelle. Et neuf graphomanies entopiques&quot;) suggests, included nine examples therein. Trost believed in transformation of human consciousness through a dialectical process that can lead to a modification of human existence at both the personal and social level. This method of &quot;indecipherable writing&quot; was supposedly an example of &quot;surautomatism&quot;, the controversial theory put forward by Trost and Gherashim Luca in which surrealist methods would be practiced that &quot;went beyond&quot; automatism. In &quot;Dialectique de Dialectique&quot; they had proposed the further radicalization of surrealist automatism by abandoning images produced by artistic techniques in favour of those &quot;resulting from rigorously applied scientific procedures,&quot; allegedly cutting the notion of &quot;artist&quot; out of the process of creating images and replacing it with chance and scientific rigour. However, the question has arisen whether an algorithm should be used to determine in what order to connect the dots to maintain the &quot;automatic&quot; nature of the method.

The method has been compared to the &quot;voronoi mathematical progression&quot;.

==Étrécissements==
Collage is perceived as an additive method of visual poetry whereas Étrécissements are a reductive method. This was first employed by Marcel Mariën in the 1950s. The results are achieved by the cutting away of parts of images to encourage a new image, by means of a pair of scissors or any other manipulative sharpened instrument.

==Exquisite corpse==

Exquisite corpse or Cadavre exquis is a method by which a collection of words or images are collectively assembled. It is based on an old parlour game known by the same name (and also as Consequences) in which players wrote in turn on a sheet of paper, folded it to conceal part of the writing, and then passed it to the next player for a further contribution.

==Frottage==

Frottage is a method of creation in which one takes a pencil or other drawing tool and makes a &quot;rubbing&quot; over a textured surface. The drawing can either be left as it is or used as the basis for further refinement. The technique was developed in 1925 by Max Ernst, who was inspired by an ancient wooden floor where the grain of the planks had been accentuated by many years of scrubbing. The patterns of the graining suggested strange images to him. He captured these by laying sheets of paper on the floor and then rubbing over them with a soft pencil.

==Fumage==
Fumage is a technique in which impressions are made by the smoke of a candle or kerosene lamp on a piece of paper or canvas. This technique was introduced by Wolfgang Paalen.

==Games==
In Surrealism, games are important not only as a form of recreation but as a method of investigation. The intention is to cut away the constraints of rationalism and allow concepts to develop more freely and in a more random manner. The aim is to break traditional thought patterns and create a more original outcome.

Old games such as Exquisite corpse, and newer ones, notably Time Travelers&#x27; Potlatch and Parallel Collage, have played a critical role.

Exquisite corpse is a method by which a collection of words or images are collectively assembled, the result being known as the exquisite corpse or &quot;cadavre exquis&quot; in French. Later the game was adapted to drawing and collage.

Time Travelers&#x27; Potlatch is a game in which two or more players say what gift they would give to another person - this is usually an historical person who played a role in, or had an influence on, the formation of Surrealism.

==Grattage==
Grattage is a surrealist technique in painting in which (usually wet) paint is scraped off the canvas. It was employed by Max Ernst and Joan Miró.

==Heatage==
Heatage is an automatic technique developed and used by David Hare in which an exposed but unfixed photographic negative is heated from below, causing the emulsion (and the resulting image, when developed) to distort in a random fashion.

==Indecipherable writing==
In addition to its obvious meaning of writing that is illegibile or for whatever other reason cannot be made out by the reader, indecipherable writing refers to a set of automatic techniques, most developed by Romanian surrealists and falling under the heading of surautomatism. Examples include entoptic graphomania, fumage and the movement of liquid down a vertical surface.

==Involuntary sculpture==
Surrealism describes as &quot;involuntary sculpture&quot; those made by absent-mindedly manipulating something, such as rolling and unrolling a movie ticket, bending a paper clip, and so forth.

==Latent news==
Latent news is a game in which an article from a newspaper is cut into individual words (or perhaps phrases) and then rapidly reassembled; see also Cut-up technique.

==Movement of liquid down a vertical surface==

Pictures can be produced by dripping or allowing a flow of some form of liquid down a vertical surface. The technique was invented by surrealists from Romania and said by them to be surautomatic and a form of indecipherable writing.

==Paranoiac-critical method==

Paranoiac-critical method is a technique invented by Salvador Dalí which consists of the artist invoking a paranoid state (fear that the self is being manipulated, targeted or controlled by others). The result is a deconstruction of the psychological concept of identity, such that subjectivity becomes the primary aspect of the artwork.

==Parsemage==
Parsemage is a surrealist and automatic method in the visual arts invented by Ithell Colquhoun in which dust from charcoal or colored chalk is scattered on the surface of water and then skimmed off by passing a stiff paper or cardboard just under the water&#x27;s surface.

==Photomontage==

Photomontage is making of composite picture by cutting and joining a number of photographs.

==Sifflage==
Sifflage is the technique used by Jimmy Ernst in which liquid paint is blown to inspire or reveal an image. This is sometimes called &quot;soufflage&quot;, but Ernst&#x27;s name was &quot;sifflage&quot;.
The result can be seen in his &quot;Echo Plasm&quot;.

==Surautomatism==

Surautomatism is any theory or act of taking automatism to its most absurd limits.

==Triptography==
Triptography is an automatic photographic technique whereby a roll of film is used three times (either by the same photographer or, in the spirit of Exquisite Corpse, three different photographers), causing it to be triple-exposed in such a way that the chances of any single photograph having a clear and definite subject is nearly impossible. Indeed, finding any edges on the negative itself during the developing process is a nearly impossible task. Typically the developing of such a roll of film is an exercise in automatic technique in and of itself, cutting the film by counting sprocket holes alone, with no regard for the images present on the negative. The results have a quality reminiscent of the transitory period in sleep when one dream suddenly becomes another.

<doc id="67596" wikidata="Q7834929" url="?curid=67596" title="Transport in Anguilla">
<text>One of the British overseas territories, the Caribbean island of [[Anguilla]] measures only long by wide, so transport is simpler than in many countries. There is no public transport, such as bus or rail systems, since there isn&#x27;t enough need. However, Anguilla&#x27;s roads are better maintained than on many Caribbean islands. 

Cars are the main means of transport, with driving on the left-hand side of the road, as in the United Kingdom. Although speed limits rarely exceed per hour and traffic moves slowly, with the island&#x27;s small size it doesn&#x27;t take long to get anywhere. Taxi service is unmetered, with set rates published in tourist guides. In addition to regular transport, taxis often offer island tours lasting several hours. Fares must be paid in cash. 

Ferries offer transport from Anguilla to other islands. The ferry from Blowing Point to Marigot, St. Martin, known to the locals as the Haddad Express, runs all day on the half-hour, into the night time. With no reservations required, taking the ferry is simple and inexpensive. Ferries can also be chartered to other destinations. One such Charter Service is from Blowing Point, Anguilla to Princess Juliana Airport to make travel easier. 

Other means of transport include bicycles, mopeds, motorcycles and walking. Because of the territory&#x27;s small land mass and flatter terrain, these methods make more sense on Anguilla than on many other Caribbean islands.

Cars, bikes, mopeds and motorcycles are all available for rental at reasonable prices. Both well-known car rental agencies and local companies operate rental businesses. Groups may also charter a private bus for excursions.

A railway was built to support phosphate mining on Sombrero Island.

<doc id="67610" wikidata="Q2546229" url="?curid=67610" title="Shade tree">
<text>A shade tree is a large tree whose primary role is to provide shade in the surrounding environment due to its spreading canopy and crown, where it may give shelter from sunlight in the heat of the summer for people who seek recreational needs in urban parks and house yards, and thus, also protecting them from the sun&#x27;s harmful UV rays.
Some of the most popular shade trees in temperate countries are oaks, plane trees, willows, birches, beeches, maples, ashes, lindens, and elms. In subtropical countries like Australia and India, figs are popular choices as shade trees. In tropical countries, trees such as some &quot;Erythrina&quot; and African tulip tree species are often planted as shade trees.

==Specialitys==
These trees are commonly grown, and/or used, as shade trees due to their protuberant size:


* American elm
* American sycamore
* Austrian oak
* Brush box
* Banyan tree
* Black walnut
* Blue Jacaranda
* Camphor laurel
* Cape Chestnut
* Carob tree
* Chinese elm
* Coastal Coral Tree
* European beech
* Honey locust
* Golden Ash
* Golden rain tree
* Holm oak
* Hopea odorata
* Hill&#x27;s weeping fig
* Indian horse-chestnut
* Japanese elm
* London plane
* Moreton bay fig
* Norway maple
* Oriental plane
* Palestine oak
* Pepper tree
* Port Jackson Fig
* Red maple
* Royal poinciana
* Rough-barked apple

==Planting==
There are a few factors to consider when choosing a shade tree: deciduousness, coverage, longevity, and the ability of the roots to damage foundations. Shade trees can enhance the privacy of a garden, patio, or back yard, by obstructing the view of outsiders. A disadvantage is that in cool climates, an abundance of shade trees may lead to a dank environment in any nearby buildings or gardens. Shade trees must not be planted near chimneys as flying fire sparks can ignite tree branches which could cause rapidly expanding fires.

Planting shade trees around a home can also reduce the energy that homeowners use in the summer months. Planting shade trees in locations near a home air conditioner can keep the air conditioner cooler which helps it run more efficiently, so less energy is used.

<doc id="67611" wikidata="Q1306" url="?curid=67611" title="Tennessine">
<text>Tennessine is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Ts and atomic number 117. It has the second-highest atomic number and joint-highest atomic mass of all known elements and is the penultimate element of the 7th period of the periodic table. It is named after the U.S. state of Tennessee, where key research institutions involved in its discovery are located (however, the IUPAC says that the element is named after the &quot;region of Tennessee&quot;).

The discovery of tennessine was officially announced in Dubna, Russia, by a Russian–American collaboration in April 2010, which makes it the most recently discovered element. One of its daughter isotopes was created directly in 2011, partially confirming the results of the experiment. The experiment itself was repeated successfully by the same collaboration in 2012 and by a joint German–American team in May 2014. In December 2015, the Joint Working Party of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), which evaluates claims of discovery of new elements, recognized the element and assigned the priority to the Russian–American team. In June 2016, the IUPAC published a declaration stating that the discoverers had suggested the name &quot;tennessine&quot;, a name which was officially adopted in November 2016.

Tennessine may be located in the &quot;island of stability&quot;, a concept that explains why some superheavy elements are more stable despite an overall trend of decreasing stability for elements beyond bismuth on the periodic table. The synthesized tennessine atoms have lasted tens and hundreds of milliseconds. In the periodic table, tennessine is expected to be a member of group 17, the halogens. Some of its properties may differ significantly from those of the lighter halogens due to relativistic effects. As a result, tennessine is expected to be a volatile metal that neither forms anions nor achieves high oxidation states. A few key properties, such as its melting and boiling points and its first ionization energy, are nevertheless expected to follow the periodic trends of the halogens.

==Introduction==
==History==
===Pre-discovery===
In December 2004, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) team in Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, proposed a joint experiment with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, United States, to synthesize element 117 — so called for the 117 protons in its nucleus. Their proposal involved fusing a berkelium (element 97) target and a calcium (element 20) beam, conducted via bombardment of the berkelium target with calcium nuclei: this would complete a set of experiments done at the JINR on the fusion of actinide targets with a calcium-48 beam, which had thus far produced the new elements 113–116 and 118. ORNL—then the world&#x27;s only producer of berkelium—could not then provide the element, as they had temporarily ceased production, and re-initiating it would be too costly. Plans to synthesize element 117 were suspended in favor of the confirmation of element 118, which had been produced earlier in 2002 by bombarding a californium target with calcium. The required berkelium-249 is a by-product in californium-252 production, and obtaining the required amount of berkelium was an even more difficult task than obtaining that of californium, as well as costly: It would cost around 3.5 million dollars, and the parties agreed to wait for a commercial order of californium production, from which berkelium could be extracted.

The JINR team sought to use berkelium because calcium-48, the isotope of calcium used in the beam, has 20 protons and 28 neutrons, making a neutron–proton ratio of 1.4; and it is the lightest stable or near-stable nucleus with such a large neutron excess. Thanks to the neutron excess, the resulting nuclei were expected to be heavier and closer to the sought-after island of stability. Of the aimed for 117 protons, calcium has 20, and thus they needed to use berkelium, which has 97 protons in its nucleus.

In February 2005, the leader of the JINR team — Yuri Oganessian — presented a colloquium at ORNL. Also in attendance were representatives of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who had previously worked with JINR on the discovery of elements 113–116 and 118, and Joseph Hamilton of Vanderbilt University, a collaborator of Oganessian.

Hamilton checked if the ORNL high-flux reactor produced californium for a commercial order: The required berkelium could be obtained as a by-product. He learned that it did not and there was no expectation for such an order in the immediate future. Hamilton kept monitoring the situation, making the checks once in a while. (Later, Oganessian referred to Hamilton as &quot;the father of 117&quot; for doing this work.)

===Discovery===
ORNL resumed californium production in spring 2008. Hamilton noted the restart during the summer and made a deal on subsequent extraction of berkelium (the price was about $600,000). During a September 2008 symposium at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, celebrating his 50th year on the Physics faculty, Hamilton introduced Oganessian to James Roberto (then the deputy director for science and technology at ORNL). They established a collaboration among JINR, ORNL, and Vanderbilt. Clarice Phelps was part of ORNL&#x27;s team that collaborated with JINR; this is particularly notable as because of it the IUPAC recognizes her as the first African-American woman to be involved with the discovery of a chemical element. The eventual collaborating institutions also included The University of Tennessee (Knoxville), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, The Research Institute for Advanced Reactors (Russia), and The University of Nevada (Las Vegas). 

In November 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy, which had oversight over the reactor in Oak Ridge, allowed the scientific use of the extracted berkelium.

The production lasted 250 days and ended in late December 2008, resulting in 22 milligrams of berkelium, enough to perform the experiment. In January 2009, the berkelium was removed from ORNL&#x27;s High Flux Isotope Reactor; it was subsequently cooled for 90 days and then processed at ORNL&#x27;s Radiochemical Engineering and Development Center to separate and purify the berkelium material, which took another 90 days. Its half-life is only 330 days: this means, after that time, half the berkelium produced would have decayed. Because of this, the berkelium target had to be quickly transported to Russia; for the experiment to be viable, it had to be completed within six months of its departure from the United States. The target was packed into five lead containers to be flown from New York to Moscow.
Russian customs officials twice refused to let the target enter the country because of missing or incomplete paperwork. Over the span of a few days, the target traveled over the Atlantic Ocean five times. On its arrival in Russia in June 2009, the berkelium was immediately transferred to Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (RIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, Ulyanovsk Oblast, where it was deposited as a 300-nanometer-thin layer on a titanium film. In July 2009, it was transported to Dubna, where it was installed in the particle accelerator at the JINR. The calcium-48 beam was generated by chemically extracting the small quantities of calcium-48 present in naturally occurring calcium, enriching it 500 times. This work was done in the closed town of Lesnoy, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia.

The experiment began in late July 2009. In January 2010, scientists at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions announced internally that they had detected the decay of a new element with atomic number 117 via two decay chains: one of an odd–odd isotope undergoing 6 alpha decays before spontaneous fission, and one of an odd–even isotope undergoing 3 alpha decays before fission. The obtained data from the experiment was sent to the LLNL for further analysis. On 9 April 2010, an official report was released in the journal &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; identifying the isotopes as 294117 and 293117, which were shown to have half-lives on the order of tens or hundreds of milliseconds. The work was signed by all parties involved in the experiment to some extent: JINR, ORNL, LLNL, RIAR, Vanderbilt, the University of Tennessee (Knoxville, Tennessee, U.S.), and the University of Nevada (Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S.), which provided data analysis support. The isotopes were formed as follows:

: + → 297117* → 294117 + 3 (1 event)

: + → 297117* → 293117 + 4 (5 events)

=== Confirmation ===

All daughter isotopes (decay products) of element 117 were previously unknown; therefore, their properties could not be used to confirm the claim of discovery. In 2011, when one of the decay products (115) was synthesized directly, its properties matched those measured in the claimed indirect synthesis from the decay of element 117. The discoverers did not submit a claim for their findings in 2007–2011 when the Joint Working Party was reviewing claims of discoveries of new elements.

The Dubna team repeated the experiment in 2012, creating seven atoms of element 117 and confirming their earlier synthesis of element 118 (produced after some time when a significant quantity of the berkelium-249 target had beta decayed to californium-249). The results of the experiment matched the previous outcome; the scientists then filed an application to register the element. In May 2014, a joint German–American collaboration of scientists from the ORNL and the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany, claimed to have confirmed discovery of the element. The team repeated the Dubna experiment using the Darmstadt accelerator, creating two atoms of element 117.

In December 2015, the JWP officially recognized the discovery of 293117 on account of the confirmation of the properties of its daughter 115, and thus the listed discoverers — JINR, LLNL, and ORNL — were given the right to suggest an official name for the element. (Vanderbilt was left off the initial list of discoverers in an error that was later corrected.)

In May 2016, Lund University (Lund, Scania, Sweden) and GSI cast some doubt on the syntheses of elements 115 and 117. The decay chains assigned to 115, the isotope instrumental in the confirmation of the syntheses of elements 115 and 117, were found based on a new statistical method to be too different to belong to the same nuclide with a reasonably high probability. The reported 293117 decay chains approved as such by the JWP were found to require splitting into individual data sets assigned to different isotopes of element 117. It was also found that the claimed link between the decay chains reported as from 117 and 115 probably did not exist. (On the other hand, the chains from the non-approved isotope 117 were found to be .) The multiplicity of states found when nuclides that are not even–even undergo alpha decay is not unexpected and contributes to the lack of clarity in the cross-reactions. This study criticized the JWP report for overlooking subtleties associated with this issue, and considered it &quot;problematic&quot; that the only argument for the acceptance of the discoveries of elements 115 and 117 was a link they considered to be doubtful.

On 8 June 2017, two members of the Dubna team published a journal article answering these criticisms, analysing their data on the nuclides 117 and 115 with widely accepted statistical methods, noted that the 2016 studies indicating non-congruence produced problematic results when applied to radioactive decay: they excluded from the 90% confidence interval both average and extreme decay times, and the decay chains that would be excluded from the 90% confidence interval they chose were more probable to be observed than those that would be included. The 2017 reanalysis concluded that the observed decay chains of 117 and 115 were consistent with the assumption that only one nuclide was present at each step of the chain, although it would be desirable to be able to directly measure the mass number of the originating nucleus of each chain as well as the excitation function of the reaction.

=== Naming ===

Using Mendeleev&#x27;s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, element 117 should be known as &quot;eka-astatine&quot;. Using the 1979 recommendations by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the element was temporarily called &quot;ununseptium&quot; (symbol &quot;Uus&quot;), formed from Latin roots &quot;one&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, and &quot;seven&quot;, a reference to the element&#x27;s atomic number 117. Many scientists in the field called it &quot;element 117&quot;, with the symbol &quot;E117&quot;, &quot;(117)&quot;, or &quot;117&quot;. According to guidelines of IUPAC valid at the moment of the discovery approval, the permanent names of new elements should have ended in &quot;-ium&quot;; this included element 117, even if the element was a halogen, which traditionally have names ending in &quot;-ine&quot;; however, the new recommendations published in 2016 recommended using the &quot;-ine&quot; ending for all new group 17 elements.

After the original synthesis in 2010, Dawn Shaughnessy of LLNL and Oganessian declared that naming was a sensitive question, and it was avoided as far as possible. However, Hamilton, who teaches at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, declared that year, &quot;I was crucial in getting the group together and in getting the 249Bk target essential for the discovery. As a result of that, I&#x27;m going to get to name the element. I can&#x27;t tell you the name, but it will bring distinction to the region.&quot; In a 2015 interview, Oganessian, after telling the story of the experiment, said, &quot;and the Americans named this a tour de force, they had demonstrated they could do [this] with no margin for error. Well, soon they will name the 117th element.&quot;

In March 2016, the discovery team agreed on a conference call involving representatives from the parties involved on the name &quot;tennessine&quot; for element 117. In June 2016, IUPAC published a declaration stating the discoverers had submitted their suggestions for naming the new elements 115, 117, and 118 to the IUPAC; the suggestion for the element 117 was &quot;tennessine&quot;, with a symbol of &quot;Ts&quot;, after &quot;the region of Tennessee&quot;. The suggested names were recommended for acceptance by the IUPAC Inorganic Chemistry Division; formal acceptance was set to occur after a five-month term following publishing of the declaration expires. In November 2016, the names, including tennessine, were formally accepted. Concerns that the proposed symbol &quot;Ts&quot; may clash with a notation for the tosyl group used in organic chemistry were rejected, following existing symbols bearing such dual meanings: Ac (actinium and acetyl) and Pr (praseodymium and propyl). The naming ceremony for moscovium, tennessine, and oganesson was held on 2 March 2017 at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow; a separate ceremony for tennessine alone had been held at ORNL in January 2017.

== Predicted properties ==
Other than nuclear properties, no properties of tennessine or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that it decays very quickly. Properties of tennessine remain unknown and only predictions are available.

=== Nuclear stability and isotopes ===

The stability of nuclei quickly decreases with the increase in atomic number after curium, element 96, whose half-life is four orders of magnitude longer than that of any subsequent element. All isotopes with an atomic number above 101 undergo radioactive decay with half-lives of less than 30 hours. No elements with atomic numbers above 82 (after lead) have stable isotopes. This is because of the ever-increasing Coulomb repulsion of protons, so that the strong nuclear force cannot hold the nucleus together against spontaneous fission for long. Calculations suggest that in the absence of other stabilizing factors, elements with more than 104 protons should not exist. However, researchers in the 1960s suggested that the closed nuclear shells around 114 protons and 184 neutrons should counteract this instability, creating an &quot;island of stability&quot; where nuclides could have half-lives reaching thousands or millions of years. While scientists have still not reached the island, the mere existence of the superheavy elements (including tennessine) confirms that this stabilizing effect is real, and in general the known superheavy nuclides become exponentially longer-lived as they approach the predicted location of the island. Tennessine is the second-heaviest element created so far, and all its known isotopes have half-lives of less than one second. Nevertheless, this is longer than the values predicted prior to their discovery: the predicted lifetimes for 293Ts and 294Ts used in the discovery paper were 10 ms and 45 ms respectively, while the observed lifetimes were 21 ms and 112 ms respectively. The Dubna team believes that the synthesis of the element is direct experimental proof of the existence of the island of stability.

It has been calculated that the isotope 295Ts would have a half-life of about 18 milliseconds, and it may be possible to produce this isotope via the same berkelium–calcium reaction used in the discoveries of the known isotopes, 293Ts and 294Ts. The chance of this reaction producing 295Ts is estimated to be, at most, one-seventh the chance of producing 294Ts. This isotope could also be produced in a pxn channel of the 249Cf+48Ca reaction that successfully produced oganesson, evaporating a proton alongside some neutrons; the heavier tennessine isotopes 296Ts and 297Ts could similarly be produced in the 251Cf+48Ca reaction. Calculations using a quantum tunneling model predict the existence of several isotopes of tennessine up to 303Ts. The most stable of these is expected to be 296Ts with an alpha-decay half-life of 40 milliseconds. A liquid drop model study on the element&#x27;s isotopes shows similar results; it suggests a general trend of increasing stability for isotopes heavier than 301Ts, with partial half-lives exceeding the age of the universe for the heaviest isotopes like 335Ts when beta decay is not considered. Lighter isotopes of tennessine may be produced in the 243Am+50Ti reaction, which was considered as a contingency plan by the Dubna team in 2008 if 249Bk proved unavailable; the isotopes 289Ts through 292Ts could also be produced as daughters of element 119 isotopes that can be produced in the 243Am+54Cr and 249Bk+50Ti reactions.
===Atomic and physical===
Tennessine is expected to be a member of group 17 in the periodic table, below the five halogens; fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine, each of which has seven valence electrons with a configuration of . For tennessine, being in the seventh period (row) of the periodic table, continuing the trend would predict a valence electron configuration of , and it would therefore be expected to behave similarly to the halogens in many respects that relate to this electronic state. However, going down group 17, the metallicity of the elements increases; for example, iodine already exhibits a metallic luster in the solid state, and astatine is expected to be a metal. As such, an extrapolation based on periodic trends would predict tennessine to be a rather volatile metal.

Calculations have confirmed the accuracy of this simple extrapolation, although experimental verification of this is currently impossible as the half-lives of the known tennessine isotopes are too short. Significant differences between tennessine and the previous halogens are likely to arise, largely due to spin–orbit interaction—the mutual interaction between the motion and spin of electrons. The spin–orbit interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster—at velocities comparable to the speed of light—than those in lighter atoms. In tennessine atoms, this lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels, stabilizing the corresponding electrons, although two of the 7p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four. The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the inert pair effect; the effect that separates the 7p subshell into the more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts is called subshell splitting. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) quantum number &quot;l&quot; from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. For many theoretical purposes, the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as .

Differences for other electron levels also exist. For example, the 6d electron levels (also split in two, with four being 6d3/2 and six being 6d5/2) are both raised, so they are close in energy to the 7s ones, although no 6d electron chemistry has ever been predicted for tennessine. The difference between the 7p1/2 and 7p3/2 levels is abnormally high; 9.8 eV. Astatine&#x27;s 6p subshell split is only 3.8 eV, and its 6p1/2 chemistry has already been called &quot;limited&quot;. These effects cause tennessine&#x27;s chemistry to differ from those of its upper neighbors (see below).

Tennessine&#x27;s first ionization energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 7.7 eV, lower than those of the halogens, again following the trend. Like its neighbors in the periodic table, tennessine is expected to have the lowest electron affinity—energy released when an electron is added to the atom—in its group; 2.6 or 1.8 eV. The electron of the hypothetical hydrogen-like tennessine atom—oxidized so it has only one electron, Ts116+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 1.90 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature attributable to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like astatine is 1.27 and the figure for hydrogen-like iodine is 1.08. Simple extrapolations of relativity laws indicate a contraction of atomic radius. Advanced calculations show that the radius of an tennessine atom that has formed one covalent bond would be 165 pm, while that of astatine would be 147 pm. With the seven outermost electrons removed, tennessine is finally smaller; 57 pm for tennessine and 61 pm for astatine.

The melting and boiling points of tennessine are not known; earlier papers predicted about 350–500 °C and 550 °C, respectively, or 350–550 °C and 610 °C, respectively. These values exceed those of astatine and the lighter halogens, following periodic trends. A later paper predicts the boiling point of tennessine to be 345 °C (that of astatine is estimated as 309 °C, 337 °C, or 370 °C, although experimental values of 230 °C and 411 °C have been reported). The density of tennessine is expected to be between 7.1 and 7.3 g/cm3.

=== Chemical ===
The known isotopes of tennessine, 293Ts and 294Ts, are too short-lived to allow for chemical experimentation at present. Nevertheless, many chemical properties of tennessine have been calculated. Unlike the lighter group 17 elements, tennessine may not exhibit the chemical behavior common to the halogens. For example, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine routinely accept an electron to achieve the more stable electronic configuration of a noble gas, obtaining eight electrons (octet) in their valence shells instead of seven. This ability weakens as atomic weight increases going down the group; tennessine would be the least willing group 17 element to accept an electron. Of the oxidation states it is predicted to form, −1 is expected to be the least common. The standard reduction potential of the Ts/Ts− couple is predicted to be −0.25 V; this value is negative, unlike for all the lighter halogens.

There is another opportunity for tennessine to complete its octet—by forming a covalent bond. Like the halogens, when two tennessine atoms meet they are expected to form a Ts–Ts bond to give a diatomic molecule. Such molecules are commonly bound via single sigma bonds between the atoms; these are different from pi bonds, which are divided into two parts, each shifted in a direction perpendicular to the line between the atoms, and opposite one another rather than being located directly between the atoms they bind. Sigma bonding has been calculated to show a great antibonding character in the At2 molecule and is not as favorable energetically. Tennessine is predicted to continue the trend; a strong pi character should be seen in the bonding of Ts2. The molecule tennessine chloride (TsCl) is predicted to go further, being bonded with a single pi bond.

Aside from the unstable −1 state, three more oxidation states are predicted; +5, +3, and +1. The +1 state should be especially stable because of the destabilization of the three outermost 7p3/2 electrons, forming a stable, half-filled subshell configuration; astatine shows similar effects. The +3 state should be important, again due to the destabilized 7p3/2 electrons. The +5 state is predicted to be uncommon because the 7p1/2 electrons are oppositely stabilized. The +7 state has not been shown—even computationally—to be achievable. Because the 7s electrons are greatly stabilized, it has been hypothesized that tennessine effectively has only five valence electrons.

The simplest possible tennessine compound would be the monohydride, TsH. The bonding is expected to be provided by a 7p3/2 electron of tennessine and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The non-bonding nature of the 7p1/2 spinor is because tennessine is expected not to form purely sigma or pi bonds. Therefore, the destabilized (thus expanded) 7p3/2 spinor is responsible for bonding. This effect lengthens the TsH molecule by 17 picometers compared with the overall length of 195 pm. Since the tennessine p electron bonds are two-thirds sigma, the bond is only two-thirds as strong as it would be if tennessine featured no spin–orbit interactions. The molecule thus follows the trend for halogen hydrides, showing an increase in bond length and a decrease in dissociation energy compared to AtH. The molecules TlTs and NhTs may be viewed analogously, taking into account an opposite effect shown by the fact that the element&#x27;s p1/2 electrons are stabilized. These two characteristics result in a relatively small dipole moment (product of difference between electric charges of atoms and displacement of the atoms) for TlTs; only 1.67 D, the positive value implying that the negative charge is on the tennessine atom. For NhTs, the strength of the effects are predicted to cause a transfer of the electron from the tennessine atom to the nihonium atom, with the dipole moment value being −1.80 D. The spin–orbit interaction increases the dissociation energy of the TsF molecule because it lowers the electronegativity of tennessine, causing the bond with the extremely electronegative fluorine atom to have a more ionic character. Tennessine monofluoride should feature the strongest bonding of all group 17 monofluorides.

VSEPR theory predicts a bent-T-shaped molecular geometry for the group 17 trifluorides. All known halogen trifluorides have this molecular geometry and have a structure of AX3E2—a central atom, denoted A, surrounded by three ligands, X, and two unshared electron pairs, E. If relativistic effects are ignored, TsF3 should follow its lighter congeners in having a bent-T-shaped molecular geometry. More sophisticated predictions show that this molecular geometry would not be energetically favored for TsF3, predicting instead a trigonal planar molecular geometry (AX3E0). This shows that VSEPR theory may not be consistent for the superheavy elements. The TsF3 molecule is predicted to be significantly stabilized by spin–orbit interactions; a possible rationale may be the large difference in electronegativity between tennessine and fluorine, giving the bond a partially ionic character.

<text>Antigua and Barbuda&#x27;s transport systems include both public and privately run services. Roads in the country are paved and follow a winding and gently sloping course connecting parishes to villages and communities. Driving is on the left-hand side. The speed limit is set at 40 mph, Traffic signs posted throughout main roads in Antigua and Barbuda allow for ease of commute, and with GPS coordinates posted throughout the country, the process of navigation has become even easier. 

Public transportation vehicles contain the letters &quot;BUS&quot; for buses or &quot;TX&quot; for taxis on their yellow licence plates. The government regulates taxi service, setting fixed fares rather than using a metered system. Taxi cabs are supposed to keep a copy of the rates inside the vehicle. On Antigua, taxis are easily found, particularly at the airport and at major hotels. Many taxi drivers also will act as tour guides.

Buses operate from 5:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. daily on Antigua, running between the capital city, St. John&#x27;s, and various villages. However, buses do not stop at the airport or the northern tourist area. Although departure times are often left up to the driver, buses generally follow a set schedule. Most buses have their routes posted in the front windows, and they&#x27;re usually privately owned mini-vans seating about 15 people. St. John&#x27;s has two bus stations, the East Bus Station near the Botanical Gardens on Independence Ave and another one on Market St. near the Central Market. Several buses are also available on Barbuda.

== Legislation ==

=== Vehicles and Road Traffic (Enforcement and Administration) Act ===
When a police officer has cause to believe that an offense has been or is being committed, it is legal for him to issue a notice to the driver accusing him of committing the offense, informing him that a complaint will be made against him regarding it, and requiring him to either pay the fixed penalty within the time period specified in the notice or appear in court on the day and at the time specified in the notice to answer the charges.

Several ports and harbours provide docking for cruise ships, sailboats, yachts, and other boats. All boats are required to enter in Antigua before continuing to Barbuda, and they must obtain a permit from the Port Authority to do so. Fees apply both for entering and docking in the country. The main port is at St. John&#x27;s, receiving cruise ships and the Barbuda Express. The Barbuda Express travels between St. John&#x27;s and Barbuda five days a week. Cruise ships also dock at Heritage Quay. English Harbour, the site of Nelson&#x27;s Dockyard, began as an important port on Antigua centuries ago. Other ports and harbours include Jolly Harbour, Deepwater Harbour, High Point Crabbs Peninsula, and Codrington (Barbuda).

==Airports==

The country&#x27;s major airport is V. C. Bird International Airport, which serves both international and local carriers. Located near St. John&#x27;s on Antigua&#x27;s northern coast, all commercial flights to the country first enter at this airport. After arriving at the airport, travellers can take chartered flights or boats to Barbuda or other Caribbean destinations.

<doc id="67619" wikidata="Q131113" url="?curid=67619" title="Elm">
<text>Elms are deciduous and semi-deciduous trees comprising the genus Ulmus in the family Ulmaceae. They are distributed over most of the Northern Hemisphere, inhabiting the temperate and tropical-montane regions of North America and Eurasia, presently ranging southward in the Middle East to Lebanon and Israel, and across the Equator in the Far East into Indonesia.

Elms are components of many kinds of natural forests. Moreover, during the 19th and early 20th centuries, many species and cultivars were also planted as ornamental street, garden, and park trees in Europe, North America, and parts of the Southern Hemisphere, notably Australasia. Some individual elms reached great size and age. However, in recent decades, most mature elms of European or North American origin have died from Dutch elm disease, caused by a microfungus dispersed by bark beetles. In response, disease-resistant cultivars have been developed, capable of restoring the elm to forestry and landscaping.

==Description==
The genus is hermaphroditic, having apetalous perfect flowers which are wind-pollinated. Elm leaves are alternate, with simple, single- or, most commonly, doubly serrate margins, usually asymmetric at the base and acuminate at the . The fruit is a round wind-dispersed samara flushed with chlorophyll, facilitating photosynthesis before the leaves emerge. The samarae are very light, those of British elms numbering around 50,000 to the pound (454 g). (Very rarely anomalous samarae occur with more than two wings.) All species are tolerant of a wide range of soils and pH levels but, with few exceptions, demand good drainage. The elm tree can grow to great height, the American elm in excess of , often with a forked trunk creating a vase profile.
== Taxonomy ==
There are about 30 to 40 species of &quot;Ulmus&quot; (elm); the ambiguity in number results from difficulty in delineating species, owing to the ease of hybridization between them and the development of local seed-sterile vegetatively propagated microspecies in some areas, mainly in the Ulmus field elm (&quot;Ulmus minor&quot;) group. Oliver Rackham describes &quot;Ulmus&quot; as the most critical genus in the entire British flora, adding that &#x27;species and varieties are a distinction in the human mind rather than a measured degree of genetic variation&#x27;. Eight species are endemic to North America and three to Europe, but the greatest diversity is in Asia with approximately two dozen species. The oldest fossils of &quot;Ulmus&quot; are leaves dating Paleocene, found across the Northern Hemisphere.

The classification adopted in the List of elm species is largely based on that established by Brummitt. A large number of synonyms have accumulated over the last three centuries; their currently accepted names can be found in the list of Elm synonyms and accepted names.

Botanists who study elms and argue over elm identification and classification are called &quot;pteleologists&quot;, from the Greek πτελέα (elm).

As part of the suborder urticalean rosids, they are distantly related to cannabis, mulberries, figs, hops, and nettles.

== Ecology ==

=== Propagation ===

Elm propagation methods vary according to elm type and location, and the plantsman&#x27;s needs. Native species may be propagated by seed. In their natural setting, native species, such as wych elm and European white elm in central and northern Europe and field elm in southern Europe, set viable seed in &quot;favourable&quot; seasons. Optimal conditions occur after a late warm spring. After pollination, seeds of spring-flowering elms ripen and fall at the start of summer (June); they remain viable for only a few days. They are planted in sandy potting soil at a depth of 1 cm, and germinate in three weeks. Slow-germinating American elm will remain dormant until the second season. Seeds from autumn-flowering elms ripen in the fall and germinate in the spring. Since elms may hybridize within and between species, seed propagation entails a hybridisation risk. In unfavourable seasons, elm seeds are usually sterile. Elms outside their natural range, such as English elm &quot;U. minor&quot; &#x27;Atinia&#x27;, and elms unable to pollinate because pollen sources are genetically identical, are sterile and are propagated by vegetative reproduction. Vegetative reproduction is also used to produce genetically identical elms (clones). Methods include the winter transplanting of root suckers; taking hardwood cuttings from vigorous one-year-old shoots in late winter, taking root cuttings in early spring; taking softwood cuttings in early summer; grafting; ground and air layering; and micropropagation. A bottom heat of 18 °C and humid conditions are maintained for hard- and softwood cuttings. The transplanting of root suckers remains the easiest and most common propagation method for European field elm and its hybrids. For specimen urban elms, grafting to wych-elm rootstock may be used to eliminate suckering or to ensure stronger root growth. The mutant-elm cultivars are usually grafted, the &quot;weeping&quot; elms &#x27;Camperdown&#x27; and &#x27;Horizontalis&#x27; at , the dwarf cultivars &#x27;Nana&#x27; and &#x27;Jacqueline Hillier&#x27; at ground level. Since the Siberian elm is drought tolerant, in dry countries, new varieties of elm are often root-grafted onto this species. 
=== Associated organisms ===
=== Pests and diseases ===
==== Dutch elm disease ====
Dutch elm disease (DED) devastated elms throughout Europe and much of North America in the second half of the 20th century. It derives its name &quot;Dutch&quot; from the first description of the disease and its cause in the 1920s by Dutch botanists Bea Schwarz and Christina Johanna Buisman. Owing to its geographical isolation and effective quarantine enforcement, Australia has so far remained unaffected by DED, as have the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia in western Canada.

DED is caused by a microfungus transmitted by two species of &quot;Scolytus&quot; elm-bark beetles, which act as vectors. The disease affects all species of elms native to North America and Europe, but many Asiatic species have evolved antifungal genes and are resistant. Fungal spores, introduced into wounds in the tree caused by the beetles, invade the xylem or vascular system. The tree responds by producing tyloses, effectively blocking the flow from roots to leaves. Woodland trees in North America are not quite as susceptible to the disease because they usually lack the root grafting of the urban elms and are somewhat more isolated from each other. In France, inoculation with the fungus of over 300 clones of the European species failed to find a single variety that possessed of any significant resistance.

The first, less aggressive strain of the disease fungus, &quot;Ophiostoma ulmi&quot;, arrived in Europe from Asia in 1910, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1928. It was steadily weakened by viruses in Europe and had all but disappeared by the 1940s. However, the disease had a much greater and longer-lasting impact in North America, owing to the greater susceptibility of the American elm, &quot;Ulmus americana&quot;, which masked the emergence of the second, far more virulent strain of the disease &quot;Ophiostoma novo-ulmi&quot;. It appeared in the United States sometime in the 1940s, and was originally believed to be a mutation of &quot;O. ulmi&quot;. Limited gene flow from &quot;O. ulmi&quot; to &quot;O. novo-ulmi&quot; was probably responsible for the creation of the North American subspecies &quot;O. novo-ulmi&quot; subsp. &quot;americana&quot;. It was first recognized in Britain in the early 1970s, believed to have been introduced via a cargo of Canadian rock elm destined for the boatbuilding industry, and rapidly eradicated most of the mature elms from western Europe. A second subspecies, &quot;O. novo-ulmi&quot; subsp. &quot;novo-ulmi&quot;, caused similar devastation in Eastern Europe and Central This subspecies, which was introduced to North America, and like &quot;O. ulmi&quot;, is thought to have originated in Asia. The two subspecies have now hybridized in Europe where their ranges have overlapped. The hypothesis that &quot;O. novo-ulmi&quot; arose from a hybrid of the original &quot;O. ulmi&quot; and another strain endemic to the Himalayas, &quot;Ophiostoma himal-ulmi&quot;, is now discredited.

No sign indicates the current pandemic is waning, and no evidence has been found of a susceptibility of the fungus to a disease of its own caused by d-factors: naturally occurring virus-like agents that severely debilitated the original &quot;O. ulmi&quot; and reduced its sporulation.

==== Elm phloem necrosis ====
Elm phloem necrosis (elm yellows) is a disease of elm trees that is spread by leafhoppers or by root grafts. This very aggressive disease, with no known cure, occurs in the Eastern United States, southern Ontario in Canada, and Europe. It is caused by phytoplasmas that infect the phloem (inner bark) of the tree. Infection and death of the phloem effectively girdles the tree and stops the flow of water and nutrients. The disease affects both wild-growing and cultivated trees.
Occasionally, cutting the infected tree before the disease completely establishes itself and cleanup and prompt disposal of infected matter has resulted in the plant&#x27;s survival via stump sprouts.

==== Insects ====

Most serious of the elm pests is the elm leaf beetle &quot;Xanthogaleruca luteola&quot;, which can decimate foliage, although rarely with fatal results. The beetle was accidentally introduced to North America from Europe. Another unwelcome immigrant to North America is the Japanese beetle &quot;Popillia japonica&quot;. In both instances, the beetles cause far more damage in North America owing to the absence of the predators in their native lands. In Australia, introduced elm trees are sometimes used as food plants by the larvae of hepialid moths of the genus &quot;Aenetus&quot;. These burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down. Circa 2000, the Asian Zig-zag sawfly &quot;Aproceros leucopoda&quot; appeared in Europe and North America, although in England, its impact has been minimal and it is no longer monitored.

==== Birds ====
Sapsucker woodpeckers have a great love of young elm trees. 
==Cultivation==


One of the earliest of ornamental elms was the ball-headed graft narvan elm, &quot;Ulmus minor&quot; &#x27;Umbraculifera&#x27;, cultivated from time immemorial in Persia as a shade tree and widely planted in cities through much of south-west and central Asia. From the 18th century to the early 20th century, elms, whether species, hybrids, or cultivars, were among the most widely planted ornamental trees in both Europe and North America. They were particularly popular as a street tree in avenue plantings in towns and cities, creating high-tunnelled effects. Their quick growth and variety of foliage and forms, their tolerance of air-pollution, and the comparatively rapid decomposition of their leaf litter in the fall were further advantages.

In North America, the species most commonly planted was the American elm (&quot;U. americana&quot;), which had unique properties that made it ideal for such use - rapid growth, adaptation to a broad range of climates and soils, strong wood, resistance to wind damage, and vase-like growth habit requiring minimal pruning. In Europe, the wych elm (&quot;U. glabra&quot;) and the field elm (&quot;U. minor&quot;) were the most widely planted in the countryside, the former in northern areas including Scandinavia and northern Britain, the latter further south. The hybrid between these two, Dutch elm (&quot;U. × hollandica&quot;), occurs naturally and was also commonly planted. In much of England, the English elm later came to dominate the horticultural landscape. Most commonly planted in hedgerows, it sometimes occurred in densities over 1000/km2. In south-eastern Australia and New Zealand, large numbers of English and Dutch elms, as well as other species and cultivars, were planted as ornamentals following their introduction in the 19th century, while in northern Japan Japanese elm (&quot;U. davidiana&quot; var. &quot;japonica&quot;) was widely planted as a street tree. From about 1850 to 1920, the most prized small ornamental elm in parks and gardens was the &#x27;Camperdown&#x27; elm (&quot;U. glabra&quot; &#x27;Camperdownii&#x27;), a contorted, weeping cultivar of the wych elm grafted on to a nonweeping elm trunk to give a wide, spreading, and weeping fountain shape in large garden spaces.

In northern Europe, elms were among the few trees tolerant of saline deposits from sea spray, which can cause &quot;salt-burning&quot; and die-back. This tolerance made elms reliable both as shelterbelt trees exposed to sea wind, in particular along the coastlines of southern and western Britain and in the Low Countries, and as trees for coastal towns and cities.

This &quot;belle époque&quot; lasted until the First World War, when the elm began its slide into horticultural decline. The impact of the hostilities on Germany, the origin of at least 40 cultivars, coincided with an outbreak of the early strain of DED, &quot;Ophiostoma ulmi&quot;. The devastation caused by the Second World War, and the demise in 1944 of the huge Späth nursery in Berlin, only accelerated the process. The outbreak of the new, three times more virulent, strain of DED &quot;Ophiostoma novo-ulmi&quot; in the late 1960s, brought the tree to its nadir.

Since around 1990, the elm has enjoyed a renaissance through the successful development in North America and Europe of cultivars highly resistant to DED. Consequently, the total number of named cultivars, ancient and modern, now exceeds 300, although many of the older clones, possibly over 120, have been lost to cultivation. Some of the latter, however, were by today&#x27;s standards inadequately described or illustrated before the pandemic, and a number may survive, or have regenerated, unrecognised. Enthusiasm for the newer clones often remains low owing to the poor performance of earlier, supposedly disease-resistant Dutch trees released in the 1960s and 1970s. In the Netherlands, sales of elm cultivars slumped from over 56,000 in 1989 to just 6,800 in 2004, whilst in the UK, only four of the new American and European releases were commercially available in 2008.

Efforts to develop DED-resistant cultivars began in the Netherlands in 1928 and continued, uninterrupted by World War II, until 1992. Similar programmes were initiated in North America (1937), Italy (1978) and Spain (1986). Research has followed two paths:

=== Species and species cultivars ===
In North America, careful selection has produced a number of trees resistant not only to DED, but also to the droughts and cold winters that occur on the continent. Research in the United States has concentrated on the American elm (&quot;U. americana&quot;), resulting in the release of DED-resistant clones, notably the cultivars &#x27;Valley Forge&#x27; and &#x27;Jefferson&#x27;. Much work has also been done into the selection of disease-resistant Asiatic species and cultivars.

In 1993, Mariam B. Sticklen and Mark G. Bolyard reported the results of experiments funded by the US National Park Service and conducted at Michigan State University in East Lansing that were designed to apply genetic engineering techniques to the development of DED-resistant strains of American elm trees. In 2007, A. E. Newhouse and F. Schrodt of the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse reported that young transgenic American elm trees had shown reduced DED symptoms and normal mycorrhizal colonization.

In Europe, the European white elm (&quot;U. laevis&quot;) has received much attention. While this elm has little innate resistance to DED, it is not favoured by the vector bark beetles. Thus it becomes colonized and infected only when no other elms are available, a rare situation in western Europe. Research in Spain has suggested that it may be the presence of a triterpene, alnulin, which makes the tree bark unattractive to the beetle species that spread the disease. This possibility, though, has not been conclusively proven. More recently, field elms &quot;Ulmus minor&quot; highly resistant to DED have been discovered in Spain, and form the basis of a major breeding programme.

=== Hybrid cultivars ===
Owing to their innate resistance to DED, Asiatic species have been crossed with European species, or with other Asiatic elms, to produce trees that are both highly resistant to disease and tolerant of native climates. After a number of false dawns in the 1970s, this approach has produced a range of reliable hybrid cultivars now commercially available in North America and Europe. Disease resistance is invariably carried by the female parent.

Some of these cultivars, notably those with the Siberian elm (&quot;Ulmus pumila&quot;) in their ancestry, lack the forms for which the iconic American elm and English elm were prized. Moreover, several exported to northwestern Europe have proven unsuited to the maritime climate conditions there, notably because of their intolerance of anoxic conditions resulting from ponding on poorly drained soils in winter. Dutch hybridizations invariably included the Himalayan elm (&quot;Ulmus wallichiana&quot;) as a source of antifungal genes and have proven more tolerant of wet ground; they should also ultimately reach a greater size. However, the susceptibility of the cultivar &#x27;Lobel&#x27;, used as a control in Italian trials, to elm yellows has now (2014) raised a question mark over all the Dutch clones.

Several highly resistant &quot;Ulmus&quot; cultivars have been released since 2000 by the Institute of Plant Protection in Florence, most commonly featuring crosses of the Dutch cultivar &#x27;Plantijn&#x27; with the Siberian elm to produce resistant trees better adapted to the Mediterranean climate.

====Cautions regarding novel cultivars====
Elms take many decades to grow to maturity, and as the introduction of these disease-resistant cultivars is relatively recent, their long-term performance and ultimate size and form cannot be predicted with certainty. The National Elm Trial in North America, begun in 2005, is a nationwide trial to assess strengths and weaknesses of the 19 leading cultivars raised in the US over a 10-year period; European cultivars have been excluded. Meanwhile, in Europe, American and European cultivars are being assessed in field trials started in 2000 by the UK charity Butterfly Conservation.

===Landscaped parks===
====Central Park====

The oldest American elm trees in New York City&#x27;s Central Park were planted in the 1860s by Frederick Law Olmsted, making them among the oldest stands of American elms in the world. Along the Mall and Literary Walk four lines of American elms stretch over the walkway forming a cathedral-like covering. A part of New York City&#x27;s urban ecology, the elms improve air and water quality, reduce erosion and flooding, and decrease air temperatures during warm days.

While the stand is still vulnerable to DED, in the 1980s the Central Park Conservancy undertook aggressive countermeasures such as heavy pruning and removal of extensively diseased trees. These efforts have largely been successful in saving the majority of the trees, although several are still lost each year. Younger American elms that have been planted in Central Park since the outbreak are of the DED-resistant &#x27;Princeton&#x27; and &#x27;Valley Forge&#x27; cultivars.

====National Mall====
Several rows of American elm trees that the National Park Service (NPS) first planted during the 1930s line much of the of the National Mall in Washington, DC. DED first appeared on the trees during the 1950s and reached a peak in the 1970s. The NPS used a number of methods to control the epidemic, including sanitation, pruning, injecting trees with fungicide, and replanting with DED-resistant cultivars. The NPS combated the disease&#x27;s local insect vector, the smaller European elm bark beetle (&quot;Scolytus multistriatus&quot;), by trapping and by spraying with insecticides. As a result, the population of American elms planted on the Mall and its surrounding areas has remained intact for more than 80 years.

Elm wood is valued for its interlocking grain, and consequent resistance to splitting, with significant uses in wagon-wheel hubs, chair seats, and coffins. The bodies of Japanese &quot;Taiko&quot; drums are often cut from the wood of old elm trees, as the wood&#x27;s resistance to splitting is highly desired for nailing the skins to them, and a set of three or more is often cut from the same tree. The elm&#x27;s wood bends well and distorts easily. The often long, straight trunks were favoured as a source of timber for keels in ship construction. Elm is also prized by bowyers; of the ancient bows found in Europe, a large portion are elm. During the Middle Ages, elm was also used to make longbows if yew was unavailable.

The first written references to elm occur in the Linear B lists of military equipment at Knossos in the Mycenaean period. Several of the chariots are of elm (&quot;πτε-ρε-ϝα&quot;, &quot;pte-re-wa&quot;), and the lists twice mention wheels of elmwood. Hesiod says that ploughs in Ancient Greece were also made partly of elm.

The density of elm wood varies between species, but averages around 560 kg/m3.

Elm wood is also resistant to decay when permanently wet, and hollowed trunks were widely used as water pipes during the medieval period in Europe. Elm was also used as piers in the construction of the original London Bridge, but this resistance to decay in water does not extend to ground contact.

===Viticulture===
The Romans, and more recently the Italians, planted elms in vineyards as supports for vines. Lopped at 3 m, the elms&#x27; quick growth, twiggy lateral branches, light shade, and root suckering made them ideal trees for this purpose. The lopped branches were used for fodder and firewood. Ovid in his &quot;Amores&quot; characterizes the elm as &quot;loving the vine&quot;: &quot;ulmus amat vitem, vitis non deserit ulmum&quot; (the elm loves the vine, the vine does not desert the elm), and the ancients spoke of the &quot;marriage&quot; between elm and vine.

===Medicinal products===
The mucilaginous inner bark of the slippery elm (&quot;Ulmus rubra&quot;) has long been used as a demulcent, and is still produced commercially for this purpose in the US with approval for sale as a nutritional supplement by the Food and Drug Administration.

===Fodder===
Elms also have a long history of cultivation for fodder, with the leafy branches cut to feed livestock. The practice continues today in the Himalaya, where it contributes to serious deforestation.

===Biomass===
As fossil fuel resources diminish, increasing attention is being paid to trees as sources of energy. In Italy, the Istituto per la Protezione delle Piante is (2012) in the process of releasing to commerce very fast-growing elm cultivars, able to increase in height by more than per year.

===Food===
Elm bark, cut into strips and boiled, sustained much of the rural population of Norway during the great famine of 1812. The seeds are particularly nutritious, containing 45% crude protein, and less than 7% fibre by dry mass.
===Alternative medicine===
Elm has been listed as one of the 38 substances that are used to prepare Bach flower remedies, a kind of alternative medicine.

===Bonsai===

Chinese elm (&quot;Ulmus parvifolia&quot;) is a popular choice for bonsai owing to its tolerance of severe pruning.

==Genetic resource conservation==
In 1997, a European Union elm project was initiated, its aim to coordinate the conservation of all the elm genetic resources of the member states and, among other things, to assess their resistance to Dutch elm disease. Accordingly, over 300 clones were selected and propagated for testing.

==Culture==

=== Notable elm trees ===

Many elm trees of various kinds have attained great size or otherwise become particularly noteworthy.

=== In art ===
Many artists have admired elms for the ease and grace of their branching and foliage, and have painted them with sensitivity. Elms are a recurring element in the landscapes and studies of, for example, John Constable, Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller, Frederick Childe Hassam, Karel Klinkenberg, and George Inness.

=== In mythology and literature ===
In Greek mythology, the nymph Ptelea (Πτελέα, Elm) was one of the eight hamadryads, nymphs of the forest and daughters of Oxylos and Hamadryas. In his &quot;Hymn to Artemis&quot;, poet Callimachus (third century BC) tells how, at the age of three, the infant goddess Artemis practised her newly acquired silver bow and arrows, made for her by Hephaestus and the Cyclopes, by shooting first at an elm, then at an oak, before turning her aim on a wild animal:

:πρῶτον ἐπὶ πτελέην, τὸ δὲ δεύτερον ἧκας ἐπὶ δρῦν, τὸ τρίτον αὖτ᾽ ἐπὶ θῆρα.

The first reference in literature to elms occurs in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. When Eetion, father of Andromache, is killed by Achilles during the Trojan War, the mountain nymphs plant elms on his tomb (&quot;περί δὲ πτελέας ἐφύτευσαν νύμφαι ὀρεστιάδες, κoῦραι Διὸς αἰγιόχoιo&quot;).
Also in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, when the River Scamander, indignant at the sight of so many corpses in his water, overflows and threatens to drown Achilles, the latter grasps a branch of a great elm in an attempt to save himself (&quot;ὁ δὲ πτελέην ἕλε χερσὶν εὐφυέα μεγάλην&quot;.

The nymphs also planted elms on the tomb in the Thracian Chersonese of &quot;great-hearted Protesilaus&quot; (&quot;μεγάθυμου Πρωτεσιλάου&quot;), the first Greek to fall in the Trojan War. These elms grew to be the tallest in the known world, but when their topmost branches saw far off the ruins of Troy, they immediately withered, so great still was the bitterness of the hero buried below, who had been loved by Laodamia and slain by Hector. The story is the subject of a poem by Antiphilus of Byzantium (first century AD) in the Palatine Anthology:

:Θεσσαλὲ Πρωτεσίλαε, σὲ μὲν πολὺς ᾄσεται αἰών,
:Tρoίᾳ ὀφειλoμένoυ πτώματος ἀρξάμενoν•
:σᾶμα δὲ τοι πτελέῃσι συνηρεφὲς ἀμφικoμεῦση
:Nύμφαι, ἀπεχθoμένης Ἰλίoυ ἀντιπέρας.
:Δένδρα δὲ δυσμήνιτα, καὶ ἤν ποτε τεῖχoς ἴδωσι
:Tρώϊον, αὐαλέην φυλλοχoεῦντι κόμην.
:ὅσσoς ἐν ἡρώεσσι τότ᾽ ἦν χόλoς, oὗ μέρoς ἀκμὴν
:ἐχθρὸν ἐν ἀψύχoις σώζεται ἀκρέμoσιν.

:[:Thessalian Protesilaos, a long age shall sing your praises,
:Of the destined dead at Troy the first;
:Your tomb with thick-foliaged elms they covered,
:The nymphs, across the water from hated Ilion.
:Trees full of anger; and whenever that wall they see,
:Of Troy, the leaves in their upper crown wither and fall.
:So great in the heroes was the bitterness then, some of which still
:Remembers, hostile, in the soulless upper branches.]

Protesilaus had been king of Pteleos () in Thessaly, which took its name from the abundant elms () in the region.

Elms occur often in pastoral poetry, where they symbolise the idyllic life, their shade being mentioned as a place of special coolness and peace. In the first Idyll of Theocritus (third century BC), for example, the goatherd invites the shepherd to sit &quot;here beneath the elm&quot; (&quot;δεῦρ&#x27; ὑπὸ τὰν πτελέαν&quot;) and sing. Beside elms, Theocritus places &quot;the sacred water&quot; (&quot;&quot;) of the Springs of the Nymphs and the shrines to the nymphs.

Aside from references literal and metaphorical to the elm and vine theme, the tree occurs in Latin literature in the Elm of Dreams in the Aeneid. When the Sibyl of Cumae leads Aeneas down to the Underworld, one of the sights is the Stygian Elm:

:In medio ramos annosaque bracchia pandit
:ulmus opaca, ingens, quam sedem somnia vulgo
:uana tenere ferunt, foliisque sub omnibus haerent.

:[:Spreads in the midst her boughs and agéd arms
:an elm, huge, shadowy, where vain dreams, &#x27;tis said,
:are wont to roost them, under every leaf close-clinging.]

Virgil refers to a Roman superstition (&quot;vulgo&quot;) that elms were trees of ill-omen because their fruit seemed to be of no value. It has been noted that two elm-motifs have arisen from classical literature: (1) the &#x27;Paradisal Elm&#x27; motif, arising from pastoral idylls and the elm-and-vine theme, and (2) the &#x27;Elm and Death&#x27; motif, perhaps arising from Homer&#x27;s commemorative elms and Virgil&#x27;s Stygian Elm. Many references to elm in European literature from the Renaissance onwards fit into one or other of these categories.

There are two examples of &quot;pteleogenesis&quot; (:birth from elms) in world myths. In Germanic and Scandinavian mythology the first woman, Embla, was fashioned from an elm,
while in Japanese mythology Kamuy Fuchi, the chief goddess of the Ainu people, &quot;was born from an elm impregnated by the Possessor of the Heavens&quot;.

The elm occurs frequently in English literature, one of the best known instances being in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, where Titania, Queen of the Fairies, addresses her beloved Nick Bottom using an elm-simile. Here, as often in the elm-and-vine motif, the elm is a masculine symbol:

:Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
:... the female Ivy so
:Enrings the barky fingers of the Elm.
:O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!

Another of the most famous kisses in English literature, that of Paul and Helen at the start of Forster&#x27;s &quot;Howards End&quot;, is stolen beneath a great wych elm.
The elm tree is also referenced in children&#x27;s literature. &quot;An Elm Tree and Three Sisters&quot; by Norma Sommerdorf is a children&#x27;s book about three young sisters who plant a small elm tree in their backyard.

=== In politics ===
The cutting of the elm was a diplomatic altercation between the kings of France and England in 1188, during which an elm tree near Gisors in Normandy was felled.

In politics, the elm is associated with revolutions. In England after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the final victory of parliamentarians over monarchists, and the arrival from Holland, with William III and Mary II, of the Dutch elm hybrid, planting of this cultivar became a fashion among enthusiasts of the new political order.
In the American Revolution, the Liberty Tree was an American white elm in Boston, Massachusetts, in front of which, from 1765, the first resistance meetings were held against British attempts to tax the American colonists without democratic representation. When the British, knowing that the tree was a symbol of rebellion, felled it in 1775, the Americans took to widespread Liberty Elm planting, and sewed elm symbols on to their revolutionary flags. Elm planting by American Presidents later became something of a tradition.

In the French Revolution, too, &quot;Les arbres de la liberté&quot; (Liberty Trees), often elms, were planted as symbols of revolutionary hopes, the first in Vienne, Isère, in 1790, by a priest inspired by the Boston elm. &quot;L&#x27;Orme de La Madeleine&quot; (:the Elm of La Madeleine), Faycelles, Département de Lot, planted around 1790 and surviving to this day, was a case in point. By contrast, a famous Parisian elm associated with the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Orme de Saint-Gervais&quot; in the Place St-Gervais, was &quot;felled&quot; by the revolutionaries; church authorities planted a new elm in its place in 1846, and an early 20th-century elm stands on the site today. Premier Lionel Jospin, obliged by tradition to plant a tree in the garden of the Hôtel Matignon, the official residence and workplace of Prime Ministers of France, insisted on planting an elm, so-called &#x27;tree of the Left&#x27;, choosing the new disease-resistant hybrid &#x27;Clone 762&#x27; (&quot;Ulmus&quot; &#x27;Wanoux&#x27; =). In the French Republican Calendar, in use from 1792 to 1806, the 12th day of the month Ventôse (= 2 March) was officially named &quot;jour de l&#x27;Orme&quot;, Day of the Elm.

Liberty Elms were also planted in other countries in Europe to celebrate their revolutions, an example being &quot;L&#x27;Olmo di Montepaone, L&#x27;Albero della Libertà&quot; (:the Elm of Montepaone, Liberty Tree) in Montepaone, Calabria, planted in 1799 to commemorate the founding of the democratic Parthenopean Republic, and surviving until it was brought down by a recent storm (it has since been cloned and &#x27;replanted&#x27;). After the Greek Revolution of 1821–32, a thousand young elms were brought to Athens from Missolonghi, &quot;Sacred City of the Struggle&quot; against the Turks and scene of Lord Byron&#x27;s death, and planted in 1839–40 in the National Garden. In an ironic development, feral elms have spread and invaded the grounds of the abandoned Greek royal summer palace at Tatoi in Attica.

In a chance event linking elms and revolution, on the morning of his execution (30 January 1649), walking to the scaffold at the Palace of Whitehall, King Charles I turned to his guards and pointed out, with evident emotion, an elm near the entrance to Spring Gardens that had been planted by his brother in happier days. The tree was said to be still standing in the 1860s.

=== In local history and place names ===
The name of what is now the London neighbourhood of Seven Sisters is derived from seven elms which stood there at the time when it was a rural area, planted a circle with a walnut tree at their centre, and traceable on maps back to 1619.

<text>This is a demography of Argentina including population density, ethnicity, economic status, age and other aspects of the population.

As of the , Argentina had a population of 46,044,703 - a 15.3% increase from the 40,117,096 counted in the .

Argentina ranks third in South America in total population and 33rd globally. The population density is 16.5 people per square kilometer - well below the world average of 62 people. Argentina&#x27;s population growth rate in 2020 was estimated to be 0.35% annually, with a birth rate of 11.8 per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 8.3 per 1,000 inhabitants.

The proportion of people under 15, at 22%, is somewhat below the world average (25%), and the cohort of people 65 and older is relatively high, at 12%. The percentage of senior citizens in Argentina has long been second only to Uruguay in Latin America and well above the world average, which is currently 9.8%.

The median age is approximately 32 years, and life expectancy at birth is of 78 years. According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines speak English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension), 9.3% speak Portuguese and 5.9% speak Italian.

==Population size and structure==

===Cities===

Argentina is highly urbanized, with the ten largest metropolitan areas accounting for half of the population, and fewer than one in ten living in rural areas. About 3 million people live in Buenos Aires proper, and including suburban Greater Buenos Aires the metropolitan area totals around 14 million - making it one of the 15 largest urban areas in the world. The metropolitan areas of Córdoba and Rosario have around 1.3 million inhabitants each, and six other cities (Mendoza, Tucumán, La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe) have at least half a million people each.

The population is unequally distributed amongst the provinces, with 61% living in the Pampa region (21% of the total area), including 17.5 million people in Buenos Aires Province, 4 million in Córdoba Province, and over 3 million each in Santa Fe Province and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Eight other provinces each have over one million people: Mendoza, Tucumán, Salta, Entre Ríos, Misiones, Corrientes, Chaco, and Santiago del Estero. Tucumán is the most densely populated (with 75 inhabitants/km2, the only Argentine province more densely populated than the world average), while the southern province of Santa Cruz has just 1.4 inhabitant/km2.

In the mid-19th century, a large wave of immigration started to arrive to Argentina due to new constitutional policies that encouraged immigration, and issues in the countries the immigrants came from such as wars, poverty, hunger, famines, pursuit of a better life, among other reasons. The main immigration sources were from Europe, the countries from the Near and Middle East, Russia and Japan. In fact, the immigration torrent was so strong that Argentina eventually received the second-largest number of immigrants in the world, second only to the US and ahead of such immigrant receptor countries such as Canada, Brazil, Australia, etc.

Most of these European immigrants settled in the cities which offered jobs, education and other opportunities enabling them to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system and since the 1930s many rural workers have moved to the big cities. 

Urban areas reflect the influence of European immigration, and most of the larger ones feature boulevards and diagonal avenues inspired by the redevelopment of Paris. Argentine cities were originally built in a colonial Spanish grid style, centered on a plaza overlooked by a cathedral and important government buildings. Many still retain this general layout, known as a &quot;damero&quot;, meaning checkerboard, since it is based on a pattern of square blocks. The city of La Plata, designed at the end of the 19th century by Pedro Benoit, combines the checkerboard layout with added diagonal avenues at fixed intervals, and was the first in South America with electric street lighting.

===Provinces and districts===

===Structure of the population===
According to the total population was in - double the number in 1966 (for a 1.27% average annual growth rate in that period). The population below the age of 15 in 2022 was 22%, 66% was between 15 and 64, while 12% was 65 or older.




==Vital statistics==
The table below gives an overview of the number of birth and deaths in Argentina during the past century. Several sources were combined to compile the table.

The number of births in 2021 (529,794) was 32% below the record set in 2014, while the number of deaths (436,799) was the highest ever recorded - though as the population of Argentina showed a five-fold increase during the past century, the birth rate in 2021 (11.6) was a record low while the death rate (9.5) rose to its highest since 1947 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Birth rates were relatively stable from 1934 through 1980, and after declining stabilized from 1995 to 2015 - before again declining sharply since then.




===UN estimates===
The Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates of vital statistics of Argentina.

Argentina&#x27;s population continues to grow but at a slower rate because of its steadily declining birth rate. Argentina&#x27;s fertility decline began earlier than in the rest of Latin America, occurring most rapidly between the early 20th century and the 1930s and then becoming more gradual.

Life expectancy has been improving, most notably among the young and the poor.

Demographic statistics according to the World Population Review.

*One birth every 1 minute
*One death every 1.4 minutes
*One net migrant every 111 minutes
*Net gain of one person every 3 minutes

==Ethnic groups==

In colonial times, the ethnic composition of Argentina was the result of the interaction of the pre-Columbian indigenous population with a colonizing population of Spanish origin and with sub-Saharan African slaves. Before the middle 19th century, the ethnic make up of Argentina was very similar to that of other countries of Latin America. Between 1857 and 1950 Argentina was the country with the second biggest immigration wave in the world, at 6.6 million, second only to the United States in the numbers of immigrants received (27 million) and ahead of other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia. However, mass European immigration did not have the same impact in the whole country. According to the 1914 national census, 30% of Argentina&#x27;s population was foreign-born, including 50% of the people in the city of Buenos Aires, but foreigners were only 2% in the provinces of Catamarca and La Rioja (North West region). Strikingly, at those times, the national population doubled every two decades. This belief is endured in the popular saying &quot;los argentinos descienden de los barcos&quot; (Argentines descend from the ships). Therefore, most Argentines are descended from the 19th- and 20th-century immigrants of the great European immigration wave to Argentina (1850–1955), with a great majority of these immigrants coming from diverse European countries, particularly Italy and Spain.

===Indigenous peoples===

According to the data of INDEC&#x27;s Complementary Survey of Indigenous Peoples (ECPI) 2004–2005, 600,000 officially recognized indigenous people (about 1.4% of the total population) reside in Argentina. The most numerous of these communities are the Mapuches, who live mostly in the south, the Kollas and Wichís, from the northwest, and the Guaranis and Qom, who live mostly in the northeast.
In the census of 2010, 955,032 people self recognized as indigenous or descendants of indigenous peoples, thus representing 2.4% of the national population. This is without prejudice that more than half of the population has at least one indigenous ancestor, although in most cases family memory lost that origin.

===Black Argentines===

Since 2013, November 8 has been celebrated as the National Day of Afro-Argentines and African Culture. The date was chosen to commemorate the recorded date for the death of María Remedios del Valle, a &quot;rabona&quot; and guerrilla fighter, who served with the Army of the North in the war of Independence.

The black population in Argentina declined since the middle 19th century from 15% of the total population in 1857 (Blacks and Mulatto people), to less than 0.5% at present (mainly mulattoes and immigrants from Cape Verde).

Afro-Argentines were up to a third of the population during colonial times; most were slaves brought from Africa to work for the criollos. The 1813 Assembly abolished slavery and led to the Freedom of Wombs Law of 1813, which automatically freed slaves&#x27; children at birth. Many Afro-Argentines contributed to the independence of Argentina such as María Remedios del Valle who is known as &quot;La Madre de la Patria&quot; (mother of the fatherland in English) and Sgt. Juan Bautista Cabral. Also there is a debate, among the historians, as to whether or not Bernardino Rivadavia, the first president of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (Present Argentina) had African ancestors.

===Immigration to Argentina===
====European settlement====
As with other areas of new settlement such as Canada, Australia, the United States, Brazil, and New Zealand, Argentina is considered a country of immigrants. When it is considered that Argentina was second only to the United States (27 million of immigrants) in the number of immigrants received, even ahead of such other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia; and that the country was scarcely populated following its independence, the impact of the immigration to Argentina becomes evident.

In the last national census, based on self-identification, 952,032 Argentines (2.4% of the population) declared to be Amerindians. Most of the 6.2 million European immigrants arriving between 1850 and 1950, regardless of origin, settled in several regions of the country. Due to this large-scale European immigration, Argentina&#x27;s population more than doubled.
The majority of these European immigrants came from Spain and Italy.
Thousands of immigrants also came from France, Germany, England, Portugal, Brazil, Switzerland, Wales, Scotland, Poland, Albania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Russia, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Bulgaria, Armenia, Greece, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia.

Italian population in Argentina arrived mainly from the northern Italian regions varying between Piedmont, Veneto and Lombardy, later from Campania and Calabria;
Spanish immigrants were mainly Galicians and Basques.
Thousands of immigrants also came from France (notably Béarn and the Northern Basque Country), Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Greece, Portugal, Finland, Russia and the United Kingdom. The Welsh settlement in Patagonia, known as &quot;Y Wladfa&quot;, began in 1865; mainly along the coast of Chubut Province. In addition to the main colony in Chubut, a smaller colony was set up in Santa Fe and another group settled at Coronel Suárez, southern Buenos Aires Province. Of the 50,000 Patagonians of Welsh descent, about 5,000 are Welsh speakers. The community is centered on the cities of Gaiman, Trelew and Trevelin.

====Recent immigrants====

According to the INDEC 1,531,940 of the Argentine resident population in 2001 were born outside Argentina, representing 4.22% of the total Argentine resident population. In 2010, 1,805,957 of the Argentine resident population were born outside Argentina, representing 4.50% of the total Argentine resident population. As of July 2023, more than 18,500 Russians have come to Argentina after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Illegal immigration has been a recent factor in Argentine demographics. Most illegal immigrants come from Bolivia and Paraguay, countries which border Argentina to the north. Smaller numbers arrive from Peru and Ecuador.
The Argentine government estimates that 750,000 inhabitants lack official documents and has launched a program called &quot;Patria Grande&quot; (&quot;Greater Homeland&quot;) to encourage illegal immigrants to regularize their status; so far over 670,000 applications have been processed under the program.


== Languages ==
The official language of Argentina is Spanish, and it is spoken by practically the entire population in several different accents. The most common variation of Spanish in Argentina is the Rioplatense Spanish (), and it is so named because it evolved in the central areas around the Río de la Plata basin. Its distinctive feature is widespread voseo, the use of the pronoun &quot;vos&quot; instead of &quot;tú&quot; for the second person singular. Additionally, the Argentinian accent sounds identical to Portuguese in the words that begin with &#x27;ll&#x27; or &#x27;yo&#x27;, and all the words in Portuguese that begin with &#x27;ch&#x27;. For example, the following sentence English: What is your name? Portuguese: como se chama? Spanish: Como se llama? - &#x27;chama&#x27; &amp; &#x27;llama&#x27; are pronounced as though they were spelled &quot;Shama&quot;in both Argentinian Spanish and Portuguese. Moreover, the sound shift of all of the words in Spanish that begin with &quot;ll&quot; or &#x27;y&#x27; but sound like &#x27;sh&#x27; i.e., &#x27;llorar&#x27; &#x27;llama, &#x27;llegar&#x27; &amp; &#x27;yo&#x27;. In Portuguese the words that begin with &#x27;ch&#x27; always sound like &#x27;sh&#x27;. There are many more words like these shown above. The mutual intelligibility between Spanish and Portuguese is already high, but the &#x27;sh&#x27; sound increases the intelligibility between both languages even more.

===Non-indigenous minority languages===
Many Argentines also speak other European languages (Italian, German, Portuguese, French, Welsh, Swedish and Croatian, as examples) due to the vast number of immigrants from Europe that came to Argentina.

English language is a required subject in many schools, and there are also many private English-teaching academies and institutions. Young people have become accustomed to English through movies and the Internet, and knowledge of the language is also required in most jobs, so most middle-class children and teenagers now speak, read and/or understand it with various degrees of proficiency. According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines claim to speak some English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension).

There are sources of around one million Levantine Arabic speakers in Argentina, as a result of immigration from the Middle East, mostly from Syria and Lebanon.

Standard German is spoken by around 500,000 Argentines of German ancestry, though the number may be as high as 3,800,000 according to some sources. German is the third or fourth most spoken language in Argentina.

There is a prosperous community of Argentine Welsh-speakers of approximately 25,000 in the province of Chubut, in the Patagonia region, who descend from 19th century immigrants.

==Religion==

The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but until 1994 the President and Vice President had to be Catholic. The society, culture, and politics of Argentina are deeply imbued with Roman Catholicism.

Estimates for the number of Roman Catholics vary from 70% of the population, to as much as 90%. The CIA Factbook lists 92% of the country is Catholic, but only 20% are practicing regularly or weekly at a church service. The Jewish population is about 300,000 (around 0.75% of the population), the community numbered about 400,000 after World War II, but the appeal of Israel and economic and cultural pressures at home led many to leave; recent instability in Israel has resulted in a modest reversal of the trend since 2003. Muslim Argentines number about 500,000–600,000, or approximately 1.5% of the population; 93% of them are Sunni. Buenos Aires is home to one of the largest mosques in Latin America. A study from 2010 found that approximately 11% of Argentines are non-religious, including those who believe in God, though not religion, agnostics (4%) and atheists (5%). Overall, 24% attended religious services regularly. Protestants were the only group in which a majority regularly attended services.

<doc id="67621" wikidata="Q1154647" url="?curid=67621" title="Politics of Argentina">
<text>The politics of Argentina take place in the framework of what the Constitution defines as a federal presidential representative democratic republic, where the President of Argentina is both Head of State and Head of Government. Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the Argentine National Congress. The Judiciary is independent, as are the Executive and the Legislature. Elections take place regularly on a multi-party system.

In the 20th century, Argentina experienced significant political turmoil and democratic reversals. Between 1930 and 1976, the armed forces overthrew six governments in Argentina; and the country alternated periods of democracy (1912–1930, 1946–1955, and 1973–1976) with periods of restricted democracy and military rule.

Following a transition that began in 1983, full-scale democracy in Argentina was reestablished. Argentina&#x27;s democracy endured through the 2001–02 crisis and to the present day; it is regarded as more robust than both its pre-1983 predecessors and other democracies in Latin America.

==National government==
The government structure of Argentina is a democracy; it contains the three branches of government.

===Executive branch===
The current Chief of State and Head of Government is President Javier Milei.

===Legislative branch===

Legislative Branch is a bicameral Congress, which consists of the Senate (72 seats), presided by the vice-president, and the Chamber of Deputies (257 seats), currently presided by Martín Menem of the La Rioja Province. The General Auditing Office of the Nation and the Ombudsman are also part of this branch. Deputies serve for 4 years, while Senators serve for 6 years.

===Judiciary branch===
The Judiciary Branch is composed of federal judges and others with different jurisdictions, and a Supreme Court with five judges, appointed by the President with approval of the Senate, who may be deposed by Congress.

== Provincial and municipal governments ==

Argentina is divided into 23 Provinces, the equivalent of States, and one autonomous district, CABA, inside the Buenos Aires province. Because of Argentina&#x27;s federal structure, every province has its own constitution, and authorities.

Each province, except for Buenos Aires Province, is divided into departments (&quot;departamentos&quot;), or districts, which are in turn divided into municipalities. The Buenos Aires Province is different, its territory is divided into 134 districts called &quot;partidos,&quot; not municipalities.

== History ==
Argentina&#x27;s first government, autonomous from the Spanish Crown, can be traced back to May 1810 and the May Revolution, where an assembly of Argentines, called Primera Junta, took power. Because at the time it was difficult to find the right form of government, and even more difficult to consolidate a Republic, Argentina experimented with different forms of assembly, like juntas and triumvirates. The 9th of July 1816, half of Argentina&#x27;s provinces signed a declaration of independence. The beginnings of Argentine state building were rough and many provinces refused to answer to a central government and sign the first constitution of 1826. In 1853, after several years of centralist power, a new constitution was passed, this one consolidated, almost fully, the Argentine Nation. Buenos Aires, still refused to be considered part of the country. After the Battle of Pavón in 1861, Buenos Aires set terms for its inclusion in the Constitution and the Republic of Argentina was born, with Bartolome Mitre as the President.

Argentina is an example where institutional instability was established after an initial period of historical contingencies. Some random insignificant historical event favors one set of institutions at the beginning. Organizations became dependent on the framework of current institutions and made further investments to profit, making it undesirably costly to switch to other types of institutions. This means that the other potentially better alternative will be unable to catch up later. Consequently, increasing returns gradually locks the economy (or political institutions) to an outcome that is not necessarily superior. People altered their expectations and stopped investing in the system as the country experienced decades of regime changes after the 1930s, seeing both rules and rule-making processes being repeatedly overturned.

Weakly enforced institutions are by design in some cases for domestic support. For example, anti-abortion was a punitive law in Argentina because many people recognize it as morally legitimate. The government put no resources into enforcing the rules, which allows the middle class to abort pregnancies in private clinics. On the other hand, strong enforcement might undermine the stability of regimes. Between 1930 and 1943, Argentine conservatives maintained power via fraud-ridden elections. After 1943, electoral rules were followed, leading to powerful actors repeatedly modifying the electoral institutions for their benefit.

=== Liberal state ===
From 1852 until 1930 Argentina experienced liberal government with first oligarchic and then democratic tendencies. From 1852 to 1916 the government, run by the landowning elite, controlled the outcome of elections by committing fraud. This was contested by the rising middle-class and working-class sectors. This fueled the creation of more unions and political parties, including the Radical Civic Union (UCR), which represented the emergent middle-class. In 1912, Law 8871, or the Sáenz Peña Law established universal, secret and obligatory male suffrage, which marked the middle classes entering the government, and displacing the landowning elite.

=== Welfare state ===
Since the 1930s coups d&#x27;état have disrupted this democracy. After World War II and Juan Perón&#x27;s presidency, recurring economic and institutional crises fostered the rise of military regimes. In 1930, the elected president Hipolito Yrigoyen was ousted by a right-wing led coup. In 1931 the new government held controlled elections and blocked the participation of Yrigoyen&#x27;s party. This alleged elections gave way to the &quot;Concordancia,&quot; a three-party regime. They controlled the Argentine government, through fraud and rigged elections, until 1943. Several factors, including the deaths of the most prominent leaders and World War II, led to another coup that ended the Concordancia regime. This coup was led by the army, which supported the Axis powers, and modeled the new government after Italy&#x27;s fascist regime. Among the military leaders was Juan Perón, who was in charge of the Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare. He veered off the path set by the conservative army and set forth to improve the living and working conditions of workers, including giving Labor Unions support and governmental positions. He was jailed briefly, but after mass protests, he became president in the elections of 1946. His regime is known as a populist one, aided by the figure of his second wife, Eva Perón, or &quot;Evita&quot;. Their regime produced economic growth and improvements on living and working conditions. It also passed female suffrage (1947), and nationalized the central bank, electricity and gas, urban transport, railroads, and the telephone. After the death of his wife, Perón started losing support. He was ousted in 1955 by another coup. Peronism lives on in Argentina. The next stage of the Social State was one characterized by both economic and political instability. Peron regained power in 1973, but died a year later. His third wife, Isabel, became president. She could not run the country and the military took power once again in 1976.

=== Neoliberal state ===
Jorge Rafael Videla&#x27;s dictatorship began in 1976 but fell into decline in 1982 after a defeat in the Falklands War (, 1982), and ended in 1983 with the democratic election of President Raúl Alfonsín of the Radical Civic Union party (UCR). Alfonsín faced significant challenges, including a military uprising, and resigned in 1989, six months before the end of his term, but the country was not in clear danger of becoming subject to a dictatorship again. Carlos Menem of the Justicialist Party (Peronist) served as president for ten years (1989-1999) and made a pact with Alfonsín in order to achieve a 1994 constitutional reform that would allow him to be re-elected. Following a neoliberal program, he ruled until 1999, and then Fernando de la Rúa of the Alianza, led by the UCR, won election. This was the first time that a Peronist president properly finished his term and passed on his charge to another democratically elected president.

De la Rúa mismanaged the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression and resigned on December 21, 2001, amid violent riots. Several short-lived interim presidents came and went until Congress chose Eduardo Duhalde of the Justicialist Party (Peronist) to rule until some sort of social and economic peace could be restored. Duhalde took care of the most critical matters and called for democratic elections, which Néstor Kirchner of the Justicialist Party won (in the first use of the ballotage system). Kirchner took office on 25 May 2003. He did not run for re-election and, in December 2007, his wife Cristina Fernández de Kirchner won the 2007 elections.

=== Anarchist State ===
After gaining independence from Spain, Argentina faced tough questions about the direction to take their new nation state. Conservatives favored a pro agriculture society while liberals wanted to industrialize. Both parties only appealed to the small percentage of Argentine&#x27;s with voting power. The vast majority of Argentine&#x27;s could not vote in the 19th century because they did not own land, were not born in Argentina or were women. Thus the anarchist movement became popular amongst the non-elites and proposed reforms to the existing political structure.

==== Women in the Anarchist movement ====
Women were among the largest group in the anarchist movement. Neither liberals or conservatives found much of a purpose for women in their society in roles other then homemakers. Soon women rejected this idea and proposed reforms that combined working class and feminist struggles into a movement. These women were critical of government because of Argentina&#x27;s 1870 civil code.

==== Immigrants in the Anarchist movement ====
In the early stages of their nation Argentina offered wealthy Europeans land in their country to more emulate Europe. Their particular targets were Germans who were protestant. However the most common groups of people the came to Argentina seeking land were poorer catholic Europeans from Italy and Spain. These immigrants could not vote and were discriminated against because Argentina did not have a seperation of church and state yet. The quickly became anarchists and spoke out against the church.

== Elections and voting ==
=== Elections ===
Elections in Argentina have been regular since the reinstitution of democracy in 1983. Because it is a &quot;federal&quot; republic Argentina has national, provincial, municipal and Ciudad de Buenos Aires elections. For legislative positions elections are every two years, and for the executive power and governors every 4.

Apart from General elections, and ballotage, Argentines also vote in P.A.S.O. elections (Primary, open, simultaneous, and obligatory elections). This is an instance before every type of election, to decide which candidates will participate in the general elections. Political parties need to get at least 1,5% of valid votes to compete in general elections.

There are 16,508 elected public service positions. In the National level: President and Vice President, 72 senators and 257 deputies. In the Provincial level: 48 positions for Governor and Deputy Governor, 232 senators, 944 deputies and 72 other elective positions in the provinces of Tierra del Fuego, Córdoba, Mendoza, and La Pampa. Out of the 23 provinces and CABA, 15 have unicameral legislatures, they do not have senatorial elections, and 9 have bicameral legislatures. In the Municipal level: 1.122 mayors and 8.488 city councils. Other authorities add up to 5.271 positions, such as the ones in municipal commissions in 10 provinces, and members of school commissions and accounts tribunals in 5 provinces.

In 2017 Argentina passed a bill that imposed gender parity in national elections in order to reach equal participation in Congress. The bill stipulates that all the lists of candidates for Congress must alternate between male and female candidates, and that half of the list of candidates for national positions have to be made up of women.

=== Voting ===
In Argentina voting is obligatory for any Argentine, either native or naturalized, that is 18 years old. In November 2012, the government passed a new law that allowed Argentines between the ages of 16–18 to vote optionally.

In the 2015 national elections, voter turnout was particularly high: Chamber of Deputies 74.18%, Senate 79.83%, Presidential (1st Round) 78.66%, Presidential (2nd Round) 80.90%.

==Political parties==
===Political parties===

Argentina&#x27;s two largest political parties are the Justicialist Party (&quot;Partido Justicialista&quot;, PJ), which evolved out of Juan Perón&#x27;s efforts in the 1940s to expand the role of labor in the political process (see Peronism), and the Radical Civic Union (&quot;Unión Cívica Radical&quot;, UCR), founded in 1891. Traditionally, the UCR had more urban middle-class support and the PJ more labor support, but both parties are broadly based. Most of the numerous political parties that emerged in the past two decades have their origins or even the bulk of their identity tied to them.

Smaller parties occupy various positions on the political spectrum and a number of them operate only in certain districts. In the years after Perón&#x27;s first years in office, several provincial parties emerged, often as a vehicle for the continued activities of Peronists, whose party was then banned, or as coalitions of politicians from all sectors wishing to take forward provincial interests. Provincial parties grew in popularity and number after the return of democracy in 1983, and took several of the provincial governor positions. Both these parties and the provincial branches of the UCR and PJ have frequently been dominated by modern &quot;caudillos&quot; and family dynasties, such as the Sapags of Neuquén and the Rodríguez Saá&#x27;s of San Luis. This has in turn been a factor in the ongoing factionalism within the two principal parties at national and local levels.

Historically, the organized labor (largely tied to the Justicialist Party) and the armed forces have also played significant roles in national life. Labor&#x27;s political power was significantly weakened by free market reforms during the 1990s, as well as the cooptation of its leaders by the Menem administration. They now seem to be returning to their former position, since the current government focuses on a productive model with local industry as one of the top priorities.

The armed forces are firmly under civilian control. Repudiated by the public after a period of military rule marked by human rights violations, economic decline, and military defeat, the Argentine military today is a downsized, volunteer force focused largely on international peacekeeping. While Menem and de la Rúa simply reduced their funding, Kirchner has effected an &quot;ideological cleansing&quot;, removing a large portion of the top ranks and replacing them with younger leaders with an explicit commitment to preserve human rights and submit to the decisions of the civilian government.

A grouping of left-leaning parties and dissident Peronists –the Front for a Country in Solidarity (&quot;Frente por un País Solidario&quot;, FREPASO)– emerged in the 1990s as a serious third party, coming second in the 1995 Presidential elections. In August 1997 the UCR and FREPASO joined in a coalition called Alliance for Work, Justice and Education (informally Alianza, &quot;Alliance&quot;). The Alliance succeeded in taking Fernando de la Rúa (UCR) to the presidency in 1999, with Carlos &quot;Chacho&quot; Álvarez (FrePaSo) as vice president. Shortly after, in October 2000 Álvarez resigned after a scandal related to presidential bribes in the Senate (the President&#x27;s party refused to support or investigate the accusations), so the Alliance (and even the FrePaSo) effectively broke down. Moreover, in the midst of serious economic crisis and riots, President Fernando de la Rúa resigned on December 21, 2001, leaving the UCR reputation severely damaged. The centennial party lost many of its supporters and a bunch of smaller parties emerged from its ashes.

Two of them scored well in the 2003 presidential election: Support for an Egalitarian Republic (ARI), formed on the initiative of Deputy Elisa Carrió, presented itself as a non-compromising front against corruption and for progressive ideas. ARI somewhat took the center left positions of the defunct Alliance in the ideological spectrum. In those elections, Carrió came a close fourth in. Her influence diminished afterward, as the Néstor Kirchner administration -running on center left policies- succeeded, and she took a more conservative stance, eventually dividing her party and founding a new alliance, the Civic Coalition. In June 2007, Fabiana Ríos, a National Deputy enrolled in ARI, was elected Governor of the Province of Tierra del Fuego, becoming the first governor belonging to this party.

The other splinter UCR party, called Recrear, was led by former De la Rúa Minister of Economy Ricardo López Murphy. Recrear captured the urban moderate right-wing spectrum of voters. López Murphy came third in the 2003 presidential elections, with a platform that emphasized transparency, polarizing with former President Carlos Menem. After meagre results for his 2005 senatorial candidacy, and ahead of the 2007 elections, he joined a group of Province-based parties and Macri&#x27;s Commitment to Change in a new centre-right coalition dubbed Republican Proposal (&quot;Propuesta Republicana&quot;, PRO). On that ticket, Macri was elected Chief of government of Buenos Aires Autonomous City.

Since the 2008 agricultural sector strikes, political support for President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and her husband, ex-president Néstor Kirchner, diminished considerably. The tax on agricultural exports divided the National Congress as much as the public opinion. On 27 July 2008, the tax reform was put down by a votation at the Senate, which came to be decided by the vote of Vice President Julio Cobos, effectively breaking the governmental coalition Plural Consensus. Since then, a fraction of dissident peronists allied with conservative PRO, Julio Cobos -through Federal Consensus (ConFe)- started negotiations with his former party, UCR. The Radical Civic Union, in turn, formalized an alliance with the Socialist Party and Elisa Carrió&#x27;s Civic Coalition, styled the Civic and Social Agreement (&quot;Acuerdo Cívico y Social&quot;, ACyS).

For the 2009 legislative elections, former President Kirchner ran himself as a candidate to National Deputy on top of the Front for Victory (&quot;Frente para la Victoria&quot;, FPV) party in the Province of Buenos Aires. After the defeat of FPV in the 2015 presidential elections, Cristina Kirchen decided to form another party called Citizen&#x27;s Unity. She ran as senator of Santa Cruz with this party and won.

Summary of the 2023 Argentine general election
==Policy==
Policy in Argentina after the several military dictatorships has been varied and has aimed at stabilizing the country. As stated above, Argentina&#x27;s politics do not lead to a particular side, but instead take the country in many directions. Since the last military junta gave up its power in 1983, each administration that has been in power has had different priorities. President Alfonsín took office in 1983 and his main task was to ensure a peaceful transition. In the end he was overcome by an economic crisis that led to a bout of hyperinflation.

After Alfonsin, came President Menem who had to control inflation and stabilize the economy. He did so by adopting a series of radical measures including fixed parity between the Argentine peso and the U.S. dollar. He then engaged in a program to move Argentina&#x27;s economy towards a liberal model. This plan included the privatization of the previously state-owned telecommunications company, oil conglomerate (YPF), airline (Aerolíneas Argentinas), railroads and utilities. As a result, large foreign direct investment flowed into Argentina for a short time, improving in some isolated cases the infrastructure and quality of service of those companies. His policies culminated in the highest unemployment rates of Argentine history and the doubling of external debt.

In the social arena, Menem pardoned military officers serving sentences for human rights abuses of the Dirty War. To balance the unpopular decision, he also pardoned some of the insurgents convicted of guerrilla attacks in the 1970s. The public scandal after the assassination of the soldier Omar Carrasco forced Menem to end compulsory military conscription.

Fernando de la Rúa&#x27;s term was notoriously ineffective on many accounts. Elected with a popular mandate to reinvigorate the economy and crack down on the corruption of the Menem administration, de la Rúa was unable or unwilling to perform these tasks. He continued on the same economic course of Menem, which ultimately led to the 2001 economic crash and de la Rúa&#x27;s resignation. The FrePaSo ministers of the administration, elected on a wave of hope for social changes, also disappointed with a perceived lack of investment in social schemes.

Eduardo Duhalde&#x27;s interim term was strongly limited by a highly mobilized society. It was marked by the need to pacify the country and soften the impact of the crisis after the forced devaluation of the local currency, the peso, which had lost three quarters of its value in a matter of months. Duhalde employed a mixture of traditional Peronist politics (in the form of a monetary subsidy for heads of families) and neo-Keynesian economic principles to stabilize the economy and bring peace to the streets.

Néstor Kirchner, who belonged to the moderate center-left wing of Peronism (rooted in the leftist Peronist factions of the 1970s), continued Duhalde&#x27;s measures (even keeping his Minister of Economy, Roberto Lavagna) and added some heterodox economics. Heavy taxes on exports have served to keep local prices of valuable commodities in check, while collecting huge revenues (especially from oil products and agricultural exports like soybeans). The restrictive monetary policy of the 1990s has become aggressively expansive; the Central Bank has injected large amounts of cash into the economy and bought dollars from the free currency market in order to accumulate reserves. The fiscal policy is also expansive; the government has raised private and public salaries by decree on several occasions, and has encouraged negotiations between the private sector and the labor movements. Inflation has again become a concern. The government has struck price-freezing agreements with certain sectors of the economy (producers of milk, some foods, natural gas, etc.) and put heavy pressure on others. Failure to comply on the part of Argentine beef producers has been met with a punitive suspension of exports, starting March 2006, intended to increase domestic supply (this was then softened to a quota system).

Cristina Fernández de Kirchner came after her husband with even more liberal policies. She strictly imposed import regulations to encourage local production and exports. She started talks with financial officials to pay off Argentina&#x27;s debt and promised foreign investment. In 2012, the move to nationalize YPF, an oil firm, scared off the foreign investors. She launched a conditional cash transfer program as well, called Asignación Universal por Hijo (AUH), which provided financial incentives to low-income or poor citizens for them to send their children to school and get vaccinated. During her presidency, same-sex marriage was legalized, and a new law was passed that allowed name and sex change in official documents for transgender people, even if they had not undergone sex reassignment surgery.

Mauricio Macri was elected in 2015 and he came in as a more conservative politician. Besides this, he did not implement any conservative policy. He only cut subsidies to the energy, but did not cut taxes, did not cut federal spending, did not reduce the national deficit and did not try to free the market. Because of his inability to take in serious reforms, he ordered a 50 billion dollar bailout to the IMF in order to restore the economy, which is currently in an economic crisis.

On 10 December 2019, the Centre-Left Alberto Fernández of the Justicialist Party was inaugurated President, after defeating the incumbent Mauricio Macri in the 2019 Argentine general election.

On 14 November 2021, the center-left coalition of Argentina&#x27;s ruling Peronist party, Frente de Todos (Front for Everyone), lost its majority in Congress, for the first time in almost 40 years, in midterm legislative elections. The election victory of the center-right coalition, Juntos por el Cambio (Together for Change), meant a tough final two years in office for President Alberto Fernandez. Losing control of the Senate made it difficult for him to make key appointments, including to the judiciary. It also forced him to negotiate with the opposition every initiative he sends to the legislature.

In April 2023, President Alberto Fernandez announced that he will not seek re-election in the next presidential election. The 19 November 2023 election run-off vote ended in a win for far-right outsider Javier Milei with close to 56% of the vote against 44% of the ruling coalition candidate Sergio Massa. On 10 December 2023, Javier Milei was sworn in as new president of Argentina. At the time of Milei&#x27;s inauguration, Argentina&#x27;s economy was suffering 143 percent annual inflation, the currency had plunged and four out of 10 Argentines were in poverty.

===Abortion===
In March 2018, a draft for an abortion law was debated in Parliament. The law allowed legal abortion until the 14th week of pregnancy if pregnant women were in danger of physical, psychological or social danger as well as pregnancy caused by rape or invalid fetuses. On 14 June, Parliament accepted the law with a slim majority of 129–123. The debates surrounding the bill caused demonstrations of supporters and opponents. The question of abortion is still contentious in society due to the strong influence of the Catholic Church.

==Political pressure groups==
Some of the most important political-pressure groups in Argentina include: the Argentine Association of Pharmaceutical Labs (CILFA); the Argentine Industrial Union (manufacturers&#x27; association); Argentine Rural Society and CARBAP (landowners&#x27; associations); the General Confederation of Labor or CGT (Peronist-leaning umbrella labor organization); the Roman Catholic Church; students.
