<text>Conifers are a group of cone-bearing seed plants, a subset of gymnosperms. Scientifically, they make up the division Pinophyta (), also known as Coniferophyta () or Coniferae. The division contains a single extant class, Pinopsida. All extant conifers are perennial woody plants with secondary growth. The great majority are trees, though a few are shrubs. Examples include cedars, Douglas-firs, cypresses, firs, junipers, kauri, larches, pines, hemlocks, redwoods, spruces, and yews. As of 2002, Pinophyta contained seven families, 60 to 65 genera, and more than 600 living species.

Although the total number of species is relatively small, conifers are ecologically important. They are the dominant plants over large areas of land, most notably the taiga of the Northern Hemisphere, but also in similar cool climates in mountains further south. Boreal conifers have many wintertime adaptations. The narrow conical shape of northern conifers, and their downward-drooping limbs, help them shed snow. Many of them seasonally alter their biochemistry to make them more resistant to freezing. While tropical rainforests have more biodiversity and turnover, the immense conifer forests of the world represent the largest terrestrial carbon sink. Conifers are of great economic value for softwood lumber and paper production.

== Evolution ==

&quot;Conifer&quot; is a Latin word, a compound of &quot;conus&quot; (cone) and &quot;ferre&quot; (to bear), meaning &quot;the one that bears (a) cone(s)&quot;.

The division name Pinophyta conforms to the rules of the &quot;International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants&quot; (ICN), which state (Article 16.1) that the names of higher taxa in plants (above the rank of family) are either formed from the name of an included family (usually the most common and/or representative), in this case Pinaceae (the pine family), or are descriptive. A descriptive name in widespread use for the conifers (at whatever rank is chosen) is Coniferae (Art 16 Ex 2).

According to the ICN, it is possible to use a name formed by replacing the termination &quot;-aceae&quot; in the name of an included family, in this case preferably Pinaceae, by the appropriate termination, in the case of this division &quot;-ophyta&quot;. Alternatively, &quot;descriptive botanical names&quot; may also be used at any rank above family. Both are allowed.

This means that if conifers are considered a division, they may be called Pinophyta or Coniferae. As a class, they may be called Pinopsida or Coniferae. As an order they may be called Pinales, Coniferae, or Coniferales. 

Conifers are the largest and economically most important component group of gymnosperms, but nevertheless they comprise only one of the four groups. The division Pinophyta consists of just one class, Pinopsida, which includes both living and fossil taxa. Subdivision of the living conifers into two or more orders has been proposed from time to time. The most commonly seen in the past was a split into two orders, Taxales (Taxaceae only) and Pinales (the rest), but recent research into DNA sequences suggests that this interpretation leaves the Pinales without Taxales as paraphyletic, and the latter order is no longer considered distinct. A more accurate subdivision would be to split the class into three orders, Pinales containing only Pinaceae, Araucariales containing Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae, and Cupressales containing the remaining families (including Taxaceae), but there has not been any significant support for such a split, with the majority of opinion preferring retention of all the families within a single order Pinales, despite their antiquity and diverse morphology.

There were seven families of conifers , with 65–70 genera and over 600 living species (). The seven most distinct families are linked in the box above right and phylogenetic diagram left. In other interpretations, the Cephalotaxaceae may be better included within the Taxaceae, and some authors additionally recognize Phyllocladaceae as distinct from Podocarpaceae (in which it is included here). The family Taxodiaceae is here included in the family Cupressaceae, but was widely recognized in the past and can still be found in many field guides. A new classification and linear sequence based on molecular data can be found in an article by Christenhusz et al.

The conifers are an ancient group, with a fossil record extending back about 300 million years to the Paleozoic in the late Carboniferous period; even many of the modern genera are recognizable from fossils 60–120 million years old. Other classes and orders, now long extinct, also occur as fossils, particularly from the late Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. Fossil conifers included many diverse forms, the most dramatically distinct from modern conifers being some herbaceous conifers with no woody stems. Major fossil orders of conifers or conifer-like plants include the Cordaitales, Vojnovskyales, Voltziales and perhaps also the Czekanowskiales (possibly more closely related to the Ginkgophyta). The cladogram summarizes conifer phylogeny:

Multiple studies indicate that the Gnetophyta belong within the conifers despite their distinct appearances, either placing them as a sister group to Pinales (the &#x27;gnepine&#x27; hypothesis) or as being more derived than Pinales but sister to the rest of the group. Most recent studies favor the &#x27;gnepine&#x27; hypothesis.

=== Fossil history ===

The earliest conifers appear in the fossil record during the Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian), over 300 million years ago. Conifers are thought to be most closely related to the Cordaitales&quot;,&quot; a group of extinct Carboniferous-Permian trees and clambering plants whose reproductive structures had some similarities to those of conifers. The most primitive conifers belong to the paraphyletic assemblage of &quot;walchian conifers&quot;, which were small trees, and probably originated in dry upland habitats. The range of conifers expanded during the Early Permian (Cisuralian) to lowlands due to increasing aridity. Walchian conifers were gradually replaced by more advanced voltzialean or &quot;transition&quot; conifers. Conifers were largely unaffected by the Permian–Triassic extinction event, and were dominant land plants of the Mesozoic era. Modern groups of conifers emerged from the Voltziales during the Late Permian through Jurassic. Conifers underwent a major decline in the Late Cretaceous corresponding to the explosive adaptive radiation of flowering plants.

==Description==

All living conifers are woody plants, and most are trees, the majority having a monopodial growth form (a single, straight trunk with side branches) with strong apical dominance. Many conifers have distinctly scented resin, secreted to protect the tree against insect infestation and fungal infection of wounds. Fossilized resin hardens into amber, which has been commercially exploited historically (for example, in New Zealand&#x27;s 19th-century kauri gum industry).

The size of mature conifers varies from less than one metre to over 100 metres in height. The world&#x27;s tallest, thickest, largest, and oldest living trees are all conifers. The tallest is a coast redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;), with a height of 115.55 metres (although one mountain ash, &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot;, allegedly grew to a height of 140 metres, the tallest living angiosperms are significantly smaller at around 100 metres.) The thickest (that is, the tree with the greatest trunk diameter) is a Montezuma cypress (&quot;Taxodium mucronatum&quot;), 11.42 metres in diameter. The largest tree by three-dimensional volume is a giant sequoia (&quot;Sequoiadendron giganteum&quot;), with a volume 1486.9 cubic metres. The smallest is the pygmy pine (&quot;Lepidothamnus laxifolius&quot;) of New Zealand, which is seldom taller than 30 cm when mature. The oldest non-clonal living tree is a Great Basin bristlecone pine (&quot;Pinus longaeva&quot;), 4,700 years old.

===Foliage===

Since most conifers are evergreens, the leaves of many conifers are long, thin and have a needle-like appearance, but others, including most of the Cupressaceae and some of the Podocarpaceae, have flat, triangular scale-like leaves. Some, notably &quot;Agathis&quot; in Araucariaceae and &quot;Nageia&quot; in Podocarpaceae, have broad, flat strap-shaped leaves. Others such as &quot;Araucaria columnaris&quot; have leaves that are awl-shaped. In the majority of conifers, the leaves are arranged spirally, the exceptions being most of Cupressaceae and one genus in Podocarpaceae, where they are arranged in decussate opposite pairs or whorls of 3 (−4).

In many species with spirally arranged leaves, such as &quot;Abies grandis&quot; (pictured), the leaf bases are twisted to present the leaves in a very flat plane for maximum light capture. Leaf size varies from 2 mm in many scale-leaved species, up to 400 mm long in the needles of some pines (e.g. Apache pine, &quot;Pinus engelmannii&quot;). The stomata are in lines or patches on the leaves and can be closed when it is very dry or cold. The leaves are often dark green in colour, which may help absorb a maximum of energy from weak sunshine at high latitudes or under forest canopy shade.

Conifers from hotter areas with high sunlight levels (e.g. Turkish pine &quot;Pinus brutia&quot;) often have yellower-green leaves, while others (e.g. blue spruce, &quot;Picea pungens&quot;) may develop blue or silvery leaves to reflect ultraviolet light. In the great majority of genera the leaves are evergreen, usually remaining on the plant for several (2–40) years before falling, but five genera (&quot;Larix&quot;, &quot;Pseudolarix&quot;, &quot;Glyptostrobus&quot;, &quot;Metasequoia&quot; and &quot;Taxodium&quot;) are deciduous, shedding their leaves in autumn. The seedlings of many conifers, including most of the Cupressaceae, and &quot;Pinus&quot; in Pinaceae, have a distinct juvenile foliage period where the leaves are different, often markedly so, from the typical adult leaves.

===Tree ring structure===
Tree rings are records of the of environmental conditions, their anatomical characteristics record growth rate changes produced by these changing conditions. The microscopic structure of conifer wood consists of two types of cells: parenchyma, which have an oval or polyhedral shape with approximately identical dimensions in three directions, and strongly elongated tracheids. Tracheids make up more than 90% of timber volume. The tracheids of earlywood formed at the beginning of a growing season have large radial sizes and smaller, thinner cell walls. Then, the first tracheids of the transition zone are formed, where the radial size of cells and the thickness of their cell walls changes considerably. Finally, latewood tracheids are formed, with small radial sizes and greater cell wall thickness. This is the basic pattern of the internal cell structure of conifer tree rings.

===Reproduction===
Most conifers are monoecious, but some are subdioecious or dioecious; all are wind-pollinated. Conifer seeds develop inside a protective cone called a strobilus. The cones take from four months to three years to reach maturity, and vary in size from long.

In Pinaceae, Araucariaceae, Sciadopityaceae and most Cupressaceae, the cones are woody, and when mature the scales usually spread open allowing the seeds to fall out and be dispersed by the wind. In some (e.g. firs and cedars), the cones disintegrate to release the seeds, and in others (e.g. the pines that produce pine nuts) the nut-like seeds are dispersed by birds (mainly nutcrackers, and jays), which break up the specially adapted softer cones. Ripe cones may remain on the plant for a varied amount of time before falling to the ground; in some fire-adapted pines, the seeds may be stored in closed cones for up to 60–80 years, being released only when a fire kills the parent tree.

In the families Podocarpaceae, Cephalotaxaceae, Taxaceae, and one Cupressaceae genus (&quot;Juniperus&quot;), the scales are soft, fleshy, sweet, and brightly colored, and are eaten by fruit-eating birds, which then pass the seeds in their droppings. These fleshy scales are (except in &quot;Juniperus&quot;) known as arils. In some of these conifers (e.g. most Podocarpaceae), the cone consists of several fused scales, while in others (e.g. Taxaceae), the cone is reduced to just one seed scale or (e.g. Cephalotaxaceae) the several scales of a cone develop into individual arils, giving the appearance of a cluster of berries.

The male cones have structures called microsporangia that produce yellowish pollen through meiosis. Pollen is released and carried by the wind to female cones. Pollen grains from living pinophyte species produce pollen tubes, much like those of angiosperms. The gymnosperm male gametophytes (pollen grains) are carried by wind to a female cone and are drawn into a tiny opening on the ovule called the . It is within the ovule that pollen-germination occurs. From here, a pollen tube seeks out the female gametophyte, which contains archegonia each with an egg, and if successful, fertilization occurs. The resulting zygote develops into an embryo, which along with the female gametophyte (nutritional material for the growing embryo) and its surrounding integument, becomes a seed. Eventually, the seed may fall to the ground and, if conditions permit, grow into a new plant.

In forestry, the terminology of flowering plants has commonly though inaccurately been applied to cone-bearing trees as well. The male cone and unfertilized female cone are called &quot;male flower&quot; and &quot;female flower&quot;, respectively. After fertilization, the female cone is termed &quot;fruit&quot;, which undergoes &quot;ripening&quot; (maturation).

It was found recently that the pollen of conifers transfers the mitochondrial organelles to the embryo, a sort of meiotic drive that perhaps explains why &quot;Pinus&quot; and other conifers are so productive, and perhaps also has bearing on observed sex-ratio bias.

===Life cycle===
Conifers are heterosporous, generating two different types of spores: male microspores and female megaspores. These spores develop on separate male and female sporophylls on separate male and female cones. In the male cones, microspores are produced from microsporocytes by meiosis. The microspores develop into pollen grains, which contain the male gametophytes. Large amounts of pollen are released and carried by the wind. Some pollen grains will land on a female cone for pollination. The generative cell in the pollen grain divides into two haploid sperm cells by mitosis leading to the development of the pollen tube. At fertilization, one of the sperm cells unites its haploid nucleus with the haploid nucleus of an egg cell. The female cone develops two ovules, each of which contains haploid megaspores. A megasporocyte is divided by meiosis in each ovule. Each winged pollen grain is a four celled male gametophyte. Three of the four cells break down leaving only a single surviving cell which will develop into a female multicellular gametophyte. The female gametophytes grow to produce two or more archegonia, each of which contains an egg. Upon fertilization, the diploid egg will give rise to the embryo, and a seed is produced. The female cone then opens, releasing the seeds which grow to a young seedling.
# To fertilize the ovum, the male cone releases pollen that is carried in the wind to the female cone. This is pollination. (Male and female cones usually occur on the same plant.)
# The pollen fertilizes the female gamete (located in the female cone). Fertilization in some species does not occur until 15 months after pollination.
# A fertilized female gamete (called a zygote) develops into an embryo.
# A seed develops which contains the embryo. The seed also contains the integument cells surrounding the embryo. This is an evolutionary characteristic of the Spermatophyta.
# Mature seed drops out of cone onto the ground.
# Seed germinates and seedling grows into a mature plant.
# When the plant is mature, it produces cones and the cycle continues.

===Female reproductive cycles===
Conifer reproduction is synchronous with seasonal changes in temperate zones. Reproductive development slows to a halt during each winter season and then resumes each spring. The male strobilus development is completed in a single year. Conifers are classified by three reproductive cycles that refer to the completion of female strobilus development from initiation to seed maturation. All three types of reproductive cycle have a long gap between pollination and fertilization.

One year reproductive cycle: The genera include &quot;Abies&quot;, &quot;Picea&quot;, &quot;Cedrus&quot;, &quot;Pseudotsuga,&quot; &quot;Tsuga&quot;, &quot;Keteleeria&quot; &quot;(Pinaceae)&quot; and &quot;Cupressus, Thuja, Cryptomeria, Cunninghamia&quot; and &quot;Sequoia (Cupressaceae)&quot;. Female strobili are initiated in late summer or fall of a year, then they overwinter. Female strobili emerge followed by pollination in the following spring. Fertilization takes place in summer of the following year, only 3–4 months after pollination. Cones mature and seeds are then shed by the end of that same year. Pollination and fertilization occur in a single growing season.

Two-year reproductive cycle: The genera includes &quot;Widdringtonia&quot;, &quot;Sequoiadendron&quot; (&quot;Cupressaceae&quot;) and most species of &quot;Pinus&quot;. Female strobilus initials are formed in late summer or fall then overwinter. Female strobili emerge and receive pollen in the first year spring and become conelets. The conelet goes through another winter rest and, in the spring of the second year archegonia form in the conelet. Fertilization of the archegonia occurs by early summer of the second year, so the pollination-fertilization interval exceeds a year. After fertilization, the conelet is considered an immature cone. Maturation occurs by autumn of the second year, at which time seeds are shed. In summary, the one-year and the two-year cycles differ mainly in the duration of the pollination-fertilization interval.

Three-year reproductive cycle: Three of the conifer species are pine species (&quot;Pinus pinea&quot;, &quot;Pinus leiophylla&quot;, &quot;Pinus torreyana&quot;) which have pollination and fertilization events separated by a two-year interval. Female strobili initiated during late summer or autumn of a year, then overwinter until the following spring. Female strobili emerge then pollination occurs in spring of the second year then the pollinated strobili become conelets in the same year (i.e. the second year). The female gametophytes in the conelet develop so slowly that the megaspore does not go through free-nuclear divisions until autumn of the third year. The conelet then overwinters again in the free-nuclear female gametophyte stage. Fertilization takes place by early summer of the fourth year and seeds mature in the cones by autumn of the fourth year.

===Tree development===
The growth and form of a forest tree are the result of activity in the primary and secondary meristems, influenced by the distribution of photosynthate from its needles and the hormonal gradients controlled by the apical meristems. External factors also influence growth and form.

Fraser recorded the development of a single white spruce tree from 1926 to 1961. Apical growth of the stem was slow from 1926 through 1936 when the tree was competing with herbs and shrubs and probably shaded by larger trees. Lateral branches began to show reduced growth and some were no longer in evidence on the 36-year-old tree. Apical growth totaling about 340 m, 370 m, 420 m, 450 m, 500 m, 600 m, and 600 m was made by the tree in the years 1955 through 1961, respectively. The total number of needles of all ages present on the 36-year-old tree in 1961 was 5.25 million weighing 14.25 kg. In 1961, needles as old as 13 years remained on the tree. The ash weight of needles increased progressively with age from about 4% in first-year needles in 1961 to about 8% in needles 10 years old. In discussing the data obtained from the one 11 m tall white spruce, Fraser et al. (1964) speculated that if the photosynthate used in making apical growth in 1961 was manufactured the previous year, then the 4 million needles that were produced up to 1960 manufactured food for about 600,000 mm of apical growth or 730 g dry weight, over 12 million mm3 of wood for the 1961 annual ring, plus 1 million new needles, in addition to new tissue in branches, bark, and roots in 1960. Added to this would be the photosynthate to produce energy to sustain respiration over this period, an amount estimated to be about 10% of the total annual photosynthate production of a young healthy tree. On this basis, one needle produced food for about 0.19 mg dry weight of apical growth, 3 mm3 wood, one-quarter of a new needle, plus an unknown amount of branch wood, bark and roots.

The order of priority of photosynthate distribution is probably: first to apical growth and new needle formation, then to buds for the next year&#x27;s growth, with the cambium in the older parts of the branches receiving sustenance last. In the white spruce studied by Fraser et al. (1964), the needles constituted 17.5% of the over-day weight. Undoubtedly, the proportions change with time.

===Seed-dispersal mechanism===
Wind and animal dispersals are two major mechanisms involved in the dispersal of conifer seeds. Wind-born seed dispersal involves two processes, namely; local neighborhood dispersal and long-distance dispersal. Long-distance dispersal distances range from from the source.
Birds of the crow family, Corvidae, are the primary distributor of the conifer seeds. These birds are known to cache 32,000 pine seeds and transport the seeds as far as from the source. The birds store the seeds in the soil at depths of under conditions which favor germination.

==Distribution and habitat==
Conifers are the dominant plants over large areas of land, most notably the taiga of the Northern Hemisphere, but also in similar cool climates in mountains further south.

==Ecology==

=== As an invasive species ===

A number of conifers originally introduced for forestry have become invasive species in parts of New Zealand, including radiata pine (&quot;Pinus radiata&quot;), lodgepole pine (&quot;P. contorta&quot;), Douglas fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga mensiezii&quot;) and European larch (&quot;Larix decidua&quot;).

In parts of South Africa, maritime pine (&quot;Pinus pinaster&quot;), patula pine (&quot;P. patula&quot;) and radiata pine have been declared invasive species. These wilding conifers are a serious environmental issue causing problems for pastoral farming and for conservation.

Radiata pine was introduced to Australia in the 1870s. It is &quot;the dominant tree species in the Australian plantation estate&quot; – so much so that many Australians are concerned by the resulting loss of native wildlife habitat. The species is widely regarded as an environmental weed across southeastern and southwestern Australia and the removal of individual plants beyond plantations is encouraged.

=== Predators ===
At least 20 species of roundheaded borers of the family Cerambycidae feed on the wood of spruce, fir, and hemlock (Rose and Lindquist 1985). Borers rarely bore tunnels in living trees, although when populations are high, adult beetles feed on tender twig bark, and may damage young living trees. One of the most common and widely distributed borer species in North America is the whitespotted sawyer (&quot;Monochamus scutellatus&quot;). Adults are found in summer on newly fallen or recently felled trees chewing tiny slits in the bark in which they lay eggs. The eggs hatch in about two weeks and the tiny larvae tunnel to the wood and score its surface with their feeding channels. With the onset of cooler weather, they bore into the wood, making oval entrance holes and tunnelling deeply. Feeding continues the following summer when larvae occasionally return to the surface of the wood and extend the feeding channels generally in a U-shaped configuration. During this time, small piles of frass extruded by the larvae accumulate under logs. Early in the spring of the second year following egg-laying, the larvae, about 30 mm long, pupate in the tunnel enlargement just below the wood surface. The resulting adults chew their way out in early summer, leaving round exit holes, so completing the usual 2-year life cycle.

==Cultivation==
Conifers – notably &quot;Abies&quot; (fir), &quot;Cedrus&quot;, &quot;Chamaecyparis lawsoniana&quot; (Lawson&#x27;s cypress), &quot;Cupressus&quot; (cypress), juniper, &quot;Picea&quot; (spruce), &quot;Pinus&quot; (pine), &quot;Taxus&quot; (yew), &quot;Thuja&quot; (cedar) – have been the subject of selection for ornamental purposes. Plants with unusual growth habits, sizes, and colours are propagated and planted in parks and gardens throughout the world.

==Conditions for growth==
Conifers can absorb nitrogen in either the ammonium (NH4+) or nitrate (NO3−) form, but the forms are not physiologically equivalent. Form of nitrogen affected both the total amount and relative composition of the soluble nitrogen in white spruce tissues (Durzan and Steward). Ammonium nitrogen was shown to foster arginine and amides and lead to a large increase of free guanidine compounds, whereas in leaves nourished by nitrate as the sole source of nitrogen guanidine compounds were less prominent. Durzan and Steward noted that their results, drawn from determinations made in late summer, did not rule out the occurrence of different interim responses at other times of the year. Ammonium nitrogen produced significantly heavier (dry weight) seedlings with a higher nitrogen content after 5 weeks than did the same amount of nitrate nitrogen. Swan found the same effect in 105-day-old white spruce.

The general short-term effect of nitrogen fertilization on coniferous seedlings is to stimulate shoot growth more so than root growth (Armson and Carman 1961). Over a longer period, root growth is also stimulated. Many nursery managers were long reluctant to apply nitrogenous fertilizers late in the growing season, for fear of increased danger of frost damage to succulent tissues. A presentation at the North American Forest Tree Nursery Soils Workshop at Syracuse in 1980 provided strong contrary evidence: Bob Eastman, President of the Western Maine Forest Nursery Co. stated that for 15 years he has been successful in avoiding winter &quot;burn&quot; to Norway spruce and white spruce in his nursery operation by fertilizing with 50–80 lb/ac (56–90 kg/ha) nitrogen in September, whereas previously winter burn had been experienced annually, often severely. Eastman also stated that the overwintering storage capacity of stock thus treated was much improved (Eastman 1980).

The concentrations of nutrients in plant tissues depend on many factors, including growing conditions. Interpretation of concentrations determined by analysis is easy only when a nutrient occurs in excessively low or occasionally excessively high concentration. Values are influenced by environmental factors and interactions among the 16 nutrient elements known to be essential to plants, 13 of which are obtained from the soil, including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur, all used in relatively large amounts. Nutrient concentrations in conifers also vary with season, age, and kind of tissue sampled, and analytical technique. The ranges of concentrations occurring in well-grown plants provide a useful guide by which to assess the adequacy of particular nutrients, and the ratios among the major nutrients are helpful guides to nutritional imbalances.

==Economic importance==
The softwood derived from conifers is of great economic value, providing about 45% of the world&#x27;s annual lumber production. Other uses of the timber include the production of paper and plastic from chemically treated wood pulp. Some conifers also provide foods such as pine nuts and juniper berries, the latter used to flavor gin.

<text>Ginkgoopsida is a proposed class of gymnosperms defined by Sergei V. Meyen in 1984 to encompass Ginkgoales (which contains the living &quot;Ginkgo&quot;) alongside a number of extinct seed plant groups, which he considered to be closely related based on similarities of morphology of pollen, seeds, cuticles, short shoots and leaves. The validity of this group as a whole has been considered questionable by other authors, who consider that it is unlikely to be monophyletic. Other authors have used the class as a monotypic grouping, including only Ginkgoales. Some authors have used the clade Ginkgophyta to encompass both Ginkgoales and Czekanowskiales/Leptostrobales, which are suggested to be closely related groups.

<text>The Bank Dick, released as The Bank Detective in the United Kingdom, is a 1940 American comedy film starring W. C. Fields. Set in Lompoc, California, Fields plays Egbert Sousé, a drunk who accidentally thwarts a bank robbery and ends up a bank security guard as a result.

The film was written by Fields, using the alias Mahatma Kane Jeeves (derived from the Broadway drawing-room comedy cliché &quot;My hat, my cane, Jeeves!&quot;), and directed by Edward F. Cline. The film also stars Una Merkel, Richard Purcell, Shemp Howard, Franklin Pangborn, Grady Sutton, Jessie Ralph and Cora Witherspoon.

In 1992, &quot;The Bank Dick&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
In a somewhat frowsy home in Lompoc, hard-drinking, henpecked family man, Egbert Sousé has strained relations with his slattern wife and waspish mother-in-law over his drinking, smoking and habit of taking money from the piggy bank of his youngest daughter, Elsie Mae and replacing it with IOUs. Sousé prefers to spend his days reading detective stories and patronizing his favorite saloon, the Black Pussy Cat Café, run by Joe Guelpe. Sousé is on his way out when Elsie Mae bounces a ketchup bottle off of his head; Sousé attempts to hit her with a potted palm tree but is interrupted when his eldest daughter Myrtle introduces him to Og Oggilby, her fiancé, who is employed as a bank teller.

At the Black Pussy Cat Café, film producer Mackley Q Greene is vexed when A. Pismo Clam, the director of a film that is shooting in town, goes on a bender. When Sousé brags about having directed silent comedians, Greene offers him the directing job. Later, Sousé is mistakenly credited for catching Loudmouth McNasty one of two robbers who held up the bank where Og works. Mr. Skinner, the president of the bank, rewards Sousé by giving him a job as the bank&#x27;s &quot;special officer,&quot; a bank detective (&quot;dick&quot;).

Back at the Black Pussy Cat Café, a swindler named J. Frothingham Waterbury cons Sousé into investing in a questionable mining operation. Sousé convinces Og to &quot;borrow&quot; (steal) $500 from the bank to buy the stock; expecting to receive his annual bonus in four days, Og intends to return the borrowed money, but bank examiner J. Pinkerton Snoopington arrives unexpectedly to immediately audit the books. In an attempt to prevent the audit, Sousé invites Snoopington to the Black Pussy Cat, where he has Joe slip him a mickey. 
Sousé helps the very ill and inebriated Snoopington back to his hotel and telephones Dr. Stall, a quack, who examines Snoopington and advises three days of bed rest. Although feeling deathly ill, Snoopington is determined to do his duty and he returns to the bank the following day to proceed with the audit. Og faints when he sees the examiner and Sousé again tries to delay the audit by breaking Snoopington&#x27;s eyeglasses.

Waterbury the swindler reads in the newspaper that the mine has struck it rich. He returns to the bank and offers to buy back the &quot;worthless&quot; stock from Og. But Sousé also reads the same news story and slugs Waterbury, knocking him through a window. Og, now rich and no longer worried about the audit, agrees to split the money with Sousé; however, the escaped bank robber, Repulsive Rogan returns to rob the bank a second time, taking Sousé hostage and escaping with the bank&#x27;s money and Og&#x27;s mining-company stock. Rogan forces Sousé to drive the getaway car and they are followed in another car by the police, the bank president, Og and Greene. A frantic chase ensues as the getaway car, with Sousé at the wheel, narrowly avoids several accidents and continually falls apart. Rogan attempts to jump from the disintegrating car but is knocked unconscious by a low-hanging tree. Sousé once again receives the credit for catching the crook and receives a $5,000 reward for the capture of Rogan, $10,000 from producer Mackley Q. Greene for his screen story and a contract to direct a film based on it.

Now wealthy, Sousé lives in a mansion with his family all of whom now dress with refinement, are well-spoken and treat him with respect now that he is a changed man; but each morning just before nine o&#x27;clock, Sousé still leaves the house to follow Joe Guelpe and spend the day at the &quot;office&quot; - the Black Pussy Cat Café.

==Cast==
==Production==
Alternative titles for the film were &quot;The Bank Detective&quot; and &quot;The Great Man&quot;. With the success of his two previous films, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Cheat an Honest Man&quot; and &quot;My Little Chickadee&quot;, Fields was able to demand complete creative control. He wrote the script under the pseudonym of Mahatma Kane Jeeves. Principal photography began at Universal Studios in early September 1940. Parts of the film were shot on location in Lompoc, California.

==Reception==
&quot;The Bank Dick&quot; received many favorable reviews. Bosley Crowther of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;for anyone who simply likes to laugh at the reckless inanities of an inspired buffoon, we recommend &quot;The Bank Dick.&quot; It&#x27;s great fun.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s a crazy-quilt pattern aiming for laughs, and achieves the purpose adequately. Several times, Fields reaches into satirical pantomime reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s best effort in that line during Mutual and Essanay days.&quot; &quot;James Agee&quot; lauded the film: &quot;The talkies brought one great comedian, the late, majestically lethargic W. C. Fields, who could not possibly have worked as well in silence; he was the toughest and most warmly human of all screen comedians, and It&#x27;s a Gift and &quot;The Bank Dick&quot;, fiendishly funny and incisive white-collar comedies, rank high among the best comedies (and best movies) ever made.&quot; 

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called the film &quot;[a] good program comedy. W.C. Fields is at his best and for that reason the picture should go over very well with his fans.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that &quot;there is often an incident or gesture reminiscent of the Mack Sennett comedies. At times, the movie even smacks of those old days so exactly that you almost believe it must be a revival of some classic. There&#x27;s nothing antiquated about it, however, no stale, museum starchiness, and the scandalous Mr. Fields has to be forgiven his outrageous behavior, since he is so simply and honestly funny.&quot; Film critic Leslie Halliwell deemed the film &quot;[i]mperfect, but probably the best Fields vehicle there is&quot; and W.C. Fields biographer Robert Lewis Taylor called it &quot;[o]ne of the great classics of American comedy.&quot;

However, Otis Ferguson, a reviewer for the &quot;New Republic&quot;, wrote: &quot;When [Fields] is funny he is terrific...but the story is makeshift, the other characters are stock types, the only pace discernible is the distance between drinks or the rhythm of the fleeting seconds it takes Fields to size up trouble and duck the hell out.&quot;

The film has a rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews. In a list submitted to &quot;Cinema&quot; magazine in 1963, noted director Stanley Kubrick named it his eighth-favorite film.

One scene from the film, where Fields asks a bartender: &quot;Was I in here last night and did I spend a twenty-dollar bill?&quot; and expressing relief that he did, because: &quot;Oh, what a load that is off my mind. I thought I LOST it.&quot;, has become classic. The line is often quoted in context of the film.

The film was released on DVD by The Criterion Collection but has since been out of print.

<text>William James &quot;Count&quot; Basie (; August 21, 1904 – April 26, 1984) was an American jazz pianist, organist, bandleader, and composer. In 1935, he formed the Count Basie Orchestra, and in 1936 took them to Chicago for a long engagement and their first recording. He led the group for almost 50 years, creating innovations like the use of two &quot;split&quot; tenor saxophones, emphasizing the rhythm section, riffing with a big band, using arrangers to broaden their sound, his minimalist piano style, and others.

Many musicians came to prominence under his direction, including the tenor saxophonists Lester Young and Herschel Evans, the guitarist Freddie Green, trumpeters Buck Clayton and Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison, plunger trombonist Al Grey, and singers Jimmy Rushing, Helen Humes, Dennis Rowland, Thelma Carpenter, and Joe Williams.

As a composer, Basie is known for writing such jazz standards as &quot;Blue and Sentimental&quot;, &quot;Jumpin&#x27; at the Woodside&quot; and &quot;One O&#x27;Clock Jump&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
William Basie was born to Lillian (Childs) and Harvey Lee Basie in Red Bank, New Jersey. His father worked as a coachman and caretaker for a wealthy judge. After automobiles replaced horses, his father became a groundskeeper and handyman for several wealthy families in the area. Both of his parents had some type of musical background. His father played the mellophone, and his mother played the piano; in fact, she gave Basie his first piano lessons. She took in laundry and baked cakes for sale for a living. She paid 25 cents a lesson for Count Basie&#x27;s piano instruction.

The best student in school, Basie dreamed of a traveling life, inspired by touring carnivals which came to town. He finished junior high school but spent much of his time at the Palace Theater in Red Bank, where doing occasional chores gained him free admission to performances. He quickly learned to improvise music appropriate to the acts and the silent movies.

Though a natural at the piano, Basie preferred drums. Discouraged by the obvious talents of Sonny Greer, who also lived in Red Bank and became Duke Ellington&#x27;s drummer in 1919, Basie switched to piano exclusively at age 15. Greer and Basie played together in venues until Greer set out on his professional career. By then, Basie was playing with pick-up groups for dances, resorts, and amateur shows, including Harry Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Kings of Syncopation&quot;. When not playing a gig, he hung out at the local pool hall with other musicians, where he picked up on upcoming play dates and gossip. He got some jobs in Asbury Park at the Jersey Shore, and played at the Hong Kong Inn until a better player took his place.

===Early career===
Around 1920, Basie went to Harlem, a hotbed of jazz, where he lived down the block from the Alhambra Theater. Early after his arrival, he bumped into Sonny Greer, who was by then the drummer for the Washingtonians, Duke Ellington&#x27;s early band. Soon, Basie met many of the Harlem musicians who were &quot;making the scene,&quot; including Willie &quot;the Lion&quot; Smith and James P. Johnson.

Basie toured in several acts between 1925 and 1927, including &quot;Katie Krippen and Her Kiddies&quot; (featuring singer Katie Crippen) as part of the &quot;Hippity Hop&quot; show; on the Keith, the Columbia Burlesque, and the Theater Owners Booking Association (T.O.B.A.) vaudeville circuits; and as a soloist and accompanist to blues singer Gonzelle White as well as Crippen. His touring took him to Kansas City, St. Louis, New Orleans, and Chicago. Throughout his tours, Basie met many jazz musicians, including Louis Armstrong. Before he was 20 years old, he toured extensively on the Keith and TOBA vaudeville circuits as a solo pianist, accompanist, and music director for blues singers, dancers, and comedians. This provided an early training that was to prove significant in his later career.

Back in Harlem in 1925, Basie gained his first steady job at Leroy&#x27;s, a place known for its piano players and its &quot;cutting contests&quot;. The place catered to &quot;uptown celebrities&quot;, and typically the band winged every number without sheet music using &quot;head arrangements&quot;. He met Fats Waller, who was playing organ at the Lincoln Theater accompanying silent movies, and Waller taught him how to play that instrument. (Basie later played organ at the Eblon Theater in Kansas City). As he did with Duke Ellington, Willie &quot;the Lion&quot; Smith helped Basie out during the lean times by arranging gigs at &quot;house-rent parties&quot;, introducing him to other leading musicians, and teaching him some piano technique.

In 1928, Basie was in Tulsa and heard Walter Page and his Famous Blue Devils, one of the first big bands, which featured Jimmy Rushing on vocals. A few months later, he was invited to join the band, which played mostly in Texas and Oklahoma. It was at this time that he began to be known as &quot;Count&quot; Basie (see Jazz royalty).

===Kansas City years===
The following year, in 1929, Basie became the pianist with the Bennie Moten band based in Kansas City, inspired by Moten&#x27;s ambition to raise his band to match the level of those led by Duke Ellington or Fletcher Henderson. Where the Blue Devils were &quot;snappier&quot; and more &quot;bluesy&quot;, the Moten band was more refined and respected, playing in the &quot;Kansas City stomp&quot; style. In addition to playing piano, Basie was co-arranger with Eddie Durham, who notated the music.
Their &quot;Moten Swing&quot;, which Basie claimed credit for, was an invaluable contribution to the development of swing music, and at one performance at the Pearl Theatre in Philadelphia in December 1932, the theatre opened its door to allow anybody in who wanted to hear the band perform. During a stay in Chicago, Basie recorded with the band. He occasionally played four-hand piano and dual pianos with Moten, who also conducted. The band improved with several personnel changes, including the addition of tenor saxophonist Ben Webster.

When the band voted Moten out, Basie took over for several months, calling the group Count Basie and his Cherry Blossoms. When his own band folded, he rejoined Moten with a newly re-organized band. A year later, Basie joined Bennie Moten&#x27;s band, and played with them until Moten died in 1935 from a failed tonsillectomy. The band tried to stay together but failed. Basie then formed his own nine-piece band, Barons of Rhythm, with many former Moten members including Walter Page (bass), Freddie Green (guitar), Jo Jones (drums), Lester Young (tenor saxophone) and Jimmy Rushing (vocals).

The Barons of Rhythm were regulars at the Reno Club and often performed for a live radio broadcast. During a broadcast the announcer wanted to give Basie&#x27;s name some style, so he called him &quot;Count&quot;. It positioned him with Earl Hines, as well as Duke Ellington.

Basie&#x27;s new band played at the Reno Club and sometimes were broadcast on local radio. Late one night with time to fill, the band started improvising. Basie liked the results and named the piece &quot;One O&#x27;Clock Jump&quot;. According to Basie, &quot;we hit it with the rhythm section and went into the riffs, and the riffs just stuck. We set the thing up front in D-flat, and then we just went on playing in F.&quot; It became his signature tune.

===John Hammond and first recordings===
At the end of 1936, Basie and his band, now billed as Count Basie and His Barons of Rhythm, moved from Kansas City to Chicago, where they honed their repertoire at a long engagement at the Grand Terrace Cafe. Right from the start, Basie&#x27;s band was known for its rhythm section. Another Basie innovation was the use of two tenor saxophone players; at the time, most bands had just one. When Young complained of Herschel Evans&#x27; vibrato, Basie placed them on either side of the alto players, and soon had the tenor players engaged in &quot;duels&quot;. Many other bands later adapted the split tenor arrangement.

In that city in October 1936, the band had a recording session which the producer John Hammond later described as &quot;the only perfect, completely perfect recording session I&#x27;ve ever had anything to do with&quot;. Hammond first heard Basie&#x27;s band on the radio and went to Kansas City to check them out. He invited them to record, in performances which were Lester Young&#x27;s earliest recordings. Those four sides were released on Vocalion Records under the band name of Jones-Smith Incorporated; the sides were &quot;Shoe Shine Boy&quot;, &quot;Evening&quot;, &quot;Boogie Woogie&quot;, and &quot;Oh Lady Be Good&quot;. After Vocalion became a subsidiary of Columbia Records in 1938, &quot;Boogie Woogie&quot; was released in 1941 as part of a four-record compilation album entitled &quot;Boogie Woogie&quot; (Columbia album C44). When he made the Vocalion recordings, Basie had already signed with Decca Records, but did not have his first recording session with them until January 1937.

By then, Basie&#x27;s sound was characterized by a &quot;jumping&quot; beat and the contrapuntal accents of his own piano. His personnel around 1937 included: Lester Young and Herschel Evans (tenor sax), Freddie Green (guitar), Jo Jones (drums), Walter Page (bass), Earle Warren (alto sax), Buck Clayton and Harry Edison (trumpet), Benny Morton and Dickie Wells (trombone). Lester Young, known as &quot;Prez&quot; by the band, came up with nicknames for all the other band members. He called Basie &quot;Holy Man&quot;, &quot;Holy Main&quot;, and just plain &quot;Holy&quot;.

Basie favored blues, and he would showcase some of the most notable blues singers of the era after he went to New York: Billie Holiday, Jimmy Rushing, Big Joe Turner, Helen Humes, and Joe Williams. He also hired arrangers who knew how to maximize the band&#x27;s abilities, such as Eddie Durham and Jimmy Mundy.

===New York City and the swing years===
When Basie took his orchestra to New York in 1937, they made the Woodside Hotel in Harlem their base (they often rehearsed in its basement). Soon, they were booked at the Roseland Ballroom for the Christmas show. Basie recalled a review, which said something like, &quot;We caught the great Count Basie band which is supposed to be so hot he was going to come in here and set the Roseland on fire. Well, the Roseland is still standing&quot;. Compared to the reigning band of Fletcher Henderson, Basie&#x27;s band lacked polish and presentation.

The producer John Hammond continued to advise and encourage the band, and they soon came up with some adjustments, including softer playing, more solos, and more standards. They paced themselves to save their hottest numbers for later in the show, to give the audience a chance to warm up. His first official recordings for Decca followed, under contract to agent MCA, including &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; and &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot;.

Hammond introduced Basie to Billie Holiday, whom he invited to sing with the band. (Holiday did not record with Basie, as she had her own record contract and preferred working with small combos). The band&#x27;s first appearance at the Apollo Theater followed, with the vocalists Holiday and Jimmy Rushing getting the most attention. Durham returned to help with arranging and composing, but for the most part, the orchestra worked out its numbers in rehearsal, with Basie guiding the proceedings. There were often no musical notations made. Once the musicians found what they liked, they usually were able to repeat it using their &quot;head arrangements&quot; and collective memory.

Next, Basie played at the Savoy, which was noted more for lindy-hopping, while the Roseland was a place for fox-trots and congas. In early 1938, the Savoy was the meeting ground for a &quot;battle of the bands&quot; with Chick Webb&#x27;s group. Basie had Holiday, and Webb countered with the singer Ella Fitzgerald. As &quot;Metronome&quot; magazine proclaimed, &quot;Basie&#x27;s Brilliant Band Conquers Chick&#x27;s&quot;; the article described the evening:

Throughout the fight, which never let down in its intensity during the whole fray, Chick took the aggressive, with the Count playing along easily and, on the whole, more musically scientifically. Undismayed by Chick&#x27;s forceful drum beating, which sent the audience into shouts of encouragement and appreciation and casual beads of perspiration to drop from Chick&#x27;s brow onto the brass cymbals, the Count maintained an attitude of poise and self-assurance. He constantly parried Chick&#x27;s thundering haymakers with tantalizing runs and arpeggios which teased more and more force from his adversary.

The publicity over the big band battle, before and after, gave the Basie band a boost and wider recognition. Soon after, Benny Goodman recorded their signature &quot;One O&#x27;Clock Jump&quot; with his band.

A few months later, Holiday left for Artie Shaw&#x27;s band. Hammond introduced Helen Humes, whom Basie hired; she stayed with Basie for four years. When Eddie Durham left for Glenn Miller&#x27;s orchestra, he was replaced by Dicky Wells. Basie&#x27;s 14-man band began playing at the Famous Door, a mid-town nightspot with a CBS network feed and air conditioning, which Hammond was said to have bought the club in return for their booking Basie steadily throughout the summer of 1938. Their fame took a huge leap. Adding to their play book, Basie received arrangements from Jimmy Mundy (who had also worked with Benny Goodman and Earl Hines), particularly for &quot;Cherokee&quot;, &quot;Easy Does It&quot;, and &quot;Super Chief&quot;. In 1939, Basie and his band made a major cross-country tour, including their first West Coast dates. A few months later, Basie quit MCA and signed with the William Morris Agency, who got them better fees.

On February 19, 1940, Count Basie and his Orchestra opened a four-week engagement at Southland in Boston, and they broadcast over the radio on February 20.
On the West Coast, in 1942 the band did a spot in &quot;Reveille With Beverly&quot;, a musical film starring Ann Miller, and a &quot;Command Performance&quot; for Armed Forces Radio, with Hollywood stars Clark Gable, Bette Davis, Carmen Miranda, Jerry Colonna, and the singer Dinah Shore. Other minor movie spots followed, including &quot;Choo Choo Swing&quot;, &quot;Crazy House&quot;, &quot;Top Man&quot;, &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot;, and &quot;Hit Parade of 1943&quot;. They also continued to record for OKeh Records and Columbia Records. The war years caused a lot of members turn over, and the band worked many play dates with lower pay. Dance hall bookings were down sharply as swing began to fade, the effects of the musicians&#x27; strikes of 1942–44 and 1948 began to be felt, and the public&#x27;s taste grew for singers.

Basie occasionally lost some key soloists. However, throughout the 1940s, he maintained a big band that possessed an infectious rhythmic beat, an enthusiastic team spirit, and a long list of inspired and talented jazz soloists.

=== Los Angeles and the Cavalcade of Jazz concerts ===
Count Basie was the featured artist at the first Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field on September 23, 1945, which was produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. Al Jarvis was the Emcee and other artists to appear on stage were Joe Liggins and his Honeydrippers, The Peters Sisters, Slim and Bam, Valaida Snow, and Big Joe Turner. They played to a crowd of 15,000. Count Basie and his Orchestra played at the tenth Cavalcade of Jazz concert also at Wrigley Field on June 20, 1954. He played along with The Flairs, Christine Kittrell, Lamp Lighters, Louis Jordan and His Tympany Five, Ruth Brown, and Perez Prado and his Orchestra.

===Post-war and later years===

The big band era appeared to have ended after the war, and Basie disbanded the group. For a while, he performed in combos, sometimes stretched to an orchestra. In 1950, he headlined the Universal-International short film &quot;&quot;Sugar Chile&quot; Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet.&quot; He reformed his group as a 16-piece orchestra in 1952. This group was eventually called the New Testament band. Basie credited Billy Eckstine, a top male vocalist of the time, for prompting his return to Big Band. He said that Norman Granz got them into the Birdland club and promoted the new band through recordings on the Mercury, Clef, and Verve labels. By 1956, Basie&#x27;s recordings were also showcased by Ben Selvin within the RCA Thesaurus transcription library. The jukebox era had begun, and Basie shared the exposure along with early rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll and rhythm and blues artists. Basie&#x27;s new band was more of an ensemble group, with fewer solo turns, and relying less on &quot;head&quot; and more on written arrangements.

Basie added touches of bebop &quot;so long as it made sense&quot;, and he required that &quot;it all had to have feeling&quot;. Basie&#x27;s band was sharing Birdland with such bebop musicians as Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Miles Davis. Behind the occasional bebop solos, he always kept his strict rhythmic pulse, &quot;so it doesn&#x27;t matter what they do up front; the audience gets the beat&quot;. Basie also added flute to some numbers, a novelty at the time that became widely copied. Soon, his band was touring and recording again. The new band included: Paul Campbell, Tommy Turrentine, Johnny Letman, Idrees Sulieman, and Joe Newman (trumpet); Jimmy Wilkins, Benny Powell, Matthew Gee (trombone); Paul Quinichette and Floyd &quot;Candy&quot; Johnson (tenor sax); Frank Wess (tenor sax and flute); Marshal Royal and Ernie Wilkins (alto sax); and Charlie Fowlkes (baritone sax). &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine reported: &quot;(Basie) has managed to assemble an ensemble that can thrill both the listener who remembers 1938 and the youngster who has never before heard a big band like this.&quot; In 1957, Basie sued the jazz venue Ball and Chain in Miami over outstanding fees, causing the closure of the venue.

In 1958, the band made its first European tour. Jazz was especially appreciated in France, The Netherlands, and Germany in the 1950s; these countries were the stomping grounds for many expatriate American jazz stars who were either resurrecting their careers or sitting out the years of racial divide in the United States. Neal Hefti began to provide arrangements, including &quot;Li&#x27;l Darlin&#x27;&quot;. By the mid-1950s, Basie&#x27;s band had become one of the preeminent backing big bands for some of the most prominent jazz vocalists of the time. They also toured with the &quot;Birdland Stars of 1955&quot;, whose lineup included Sarah Vaughan, Erroll Garner, Lester Young, George Shearing, and Stan Getz.

In 1957, Basie the live album &quot;Count Basie at Newport&quot;. &quot;April in Paris&quot; (arrangement by Wild Bill Davis) was a best-selling instrumental and the title song for the hit album. The Basie band made two tours in the British Isles and on the second, they put on a command performance for Queen Elizabeth II, along with Judy Garland, Vera Lynn, and Mario Lanza. He was a guest on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot;, a venue also opened to several other black entertainers. In 1959, Basie&#x27;s band recorded a &quot;greatest hits&quot; double album &quot;The Count Basie Story&quot; (Frank Foster, arranger), and &quot;Basie/Eckstine Incorporated&quot;, an album featuring Billy Eckstine, Quincy Jones (as arranger) and the Count Basie Orchestra. It was released by Roulette Records, then later reissued by Capitol Records.

Later that year, Basie appeared on a television special with Fred Astaire, featuring a dance solo to &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot;, followed in January 1961 by Basie performing at one of the five John F. Kennedy Inaugural Balls. That summer, Basie and Duke Ellington combined forces for the recording &quot;First Time! The Count Meets the Duke&quot;, each providing four numbers from their play books.
During the balance of the 1960s, the band kept active with tours, recordings, television appearances, festivals, Las Vegas shows, and travel abroad, including cruises. Some time around 1964, Basie adopted his trademark yachting cap.

Through steady changes in personnel, Basie led the band into the 1980s. Basie made a few more movie appearances, such as in the Jerry Lewis film &quot;Cinderfella&quot; (1960) and the Mel Brooks movie &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974), playing a revised arrangement of &quot;April in Paris&quot;. In 1982 Basie and his orchestra were the featured entertainment for the 50th Anniversary celebrations of the Pittsburgh Steelers at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center.

Basie was a Prince Hall Freemason as a member of Wisdom Lodge No. 102 in Chicago as well as a Shriner.

==Marriage, family and death==

Basie was a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity. On July 21, 1930, Basie married Vivian Lee Winn, in Kansas City, Missouri. They were divorced sometime before 1935. Some time in or before 1935, the now single Basie returned to New York City, renting a house at 111 West 138th Street, Manhattan, as evidenced by the 1940 census. He married Catherine Morgan on July 13, 1940, in the King County courthouse in Seattle, Washington. In 1942, they moved to Queens. Their only child, Diane, was born February 6, 1944. She was born with cerebral palsy and the doctors claimed she would never walk. The couple kept her and cared deeply for her, and especially through her mother&#x27;s tutelage, Diane learned not only to walk but to swim. The Basies bought a home in the new whites-only neighborhood of Addisleigh Park in 1946 on Adelaide Road and 175th Street, St. Albans, Queens.
On April 11, 1983, Catherine Basie died of heart disease at the couple&#x27;s home in Freeport, Grand Bahama Island. She was 67 years old. Daughter Diane Basie died October 15, 2022, of a heart attack.

Count Basie died of pancreatic cancer in Hollywood, Florida, on April 26, 1984, at the age of 79.

==Singers==
Basie hitched his star to some of the most famous vocalists of the 1950s and 1960s, which helped keep the Big Band sound alive and added greatly to his recording catalog. Jimmy Rushing sang with Basie in the late 1930s. Joe Williams toured with the band and was featured on the 1957 album &quot;One O&#x27;Clock Jump&quot;, and 1956&#x27;s &quot;Count Basie Swings, Joe Williams Sings&quot;, with &quot;Every Day (I Have the Blues)&quot; becoming a huge hit. With Billy Eckstine on the album &quot;Basie/Eckstine Incorporated&quot;, in 1959. Ella Fitzgerald made some memorable recordings with Basie, including the 1963 album &quot;Ella and Basie!&quot;. With the New Testament Basie band in full swing, and arrangements written by a youthful Quincy Jones, this album proved a swinging respite from her &quot;Songbook&quot; recordings and constant touring she did during this period. She even toured with the Basie Orchestra in the mid-1970s, and Fitzgerald and Basie also met on the 1979 albums &quot;A Classy Pair&quot;, &quot;Digital III at Montreux&quot;, and &quot;A Perfect Match&quot;, the last two also recorded live at Montreux. In addition to Quincy Jones, Basie was using arrangers such as Benny Carter &quot;(Kansas City Suite)&quot;, Neal Hefti &quot;(The Atomic Mr Basie)&quot;, and Sammy Nestico &quot;(Basie-Straight Ahead)&quot;.

Frank Sinatra recorded for the first time with Basie on 1962&#x27;s &quot;Sinatra-Basie&quot; and for a second studio album on 1964&#x27;s &quot;It Might as Well Be Swing&quot;, which was arranged by Quincy Jones. Jones also arranged and conducted 1966&#x27;s live &quot;Sinatra at the Sands&quot; which featured Sinatra with Count Basie and his orchestra stayed at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas at Sinatra&#x27;s request. In May 1970, Sinatra performed in London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall with the Basie orchestra, in a charity benefit for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Sinatra later said of this concert &quot;I have a funny feeling that those two nights could have been my finest hour, really. It went so well; it was so thrilling and exciting&quot;.

Basie also recorded with Tony Bennett in the late 1950s. Their albums together included &quot;In Person&quot; and &quot;Strike Up the Band.&quot; Basie also toured with Bennett, including a date at Carnegie Hall. He also recorded with Sammy Davis Jr., Bing Crosby, and Sarah Vaughan. One of Basie&#x27;s biggest regrets was never recording with Louis Armstrong, though they shared the same bill several times. In 1968, Basie and his Band recorded an album with Jackie Wilson titled &quot;Manufacturers of Soul&quot;.

==Legacy and honors==
Count Basie introduced several generations of listeners to the Big Band sound and left an influential catalog. Basie is remembered by many who worked for him as being considerate of musicians and their opinions, modest, relaxed, fun-loving, dryly witty, and always enthusiastic about his music. In his autobiography, he wrote, &quot;I think the band can really &quot;swing&quot; when it swings &quot;easy&quot;, when it can just play along like you are cutting butter.&quot;

<doc id="68092" wikidata="Q644987" url="?curid=68092" title="Chinatown (1974 film)">
<text>Chinatown is a 1974 American neo-noir mystery film directed by Roman Polanski from a screenplay by Robert Towne. It stars Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway in the principal roles, with supporting performances by John Huston, John Hillerman, Perry Lopez, Burt Young, and Diane Ladd. The film&#x27;s story is inspired by the California water wars: a series of disputes over southern California water at the beginning of the 20th century that resulted in Los Angeles securing water rights in the Owens Valley. The Robert Evans production, released by Paramount Pictures, was Polanski&#x27;s last film in the United States and features many elements of film noir, particularly a multi-layered story that is part mystery and part psychological drama.

&quot;Chinatown&quot; was released in the United States on June 20, 1974, to acclaim from critics, with praise for the narrative and screenwriting, Nicholson and Dunaway&#x27;s performances, cinematography, and Polanski&#x27;s direction. At the 47th Academy Awards, it was nominated for 11 Oscars, with Towne winning Best Original Screenplay. The Golden Globe Awards honored it for Best Drama, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay. The American Film Institute placed it second among the top ten mystery films in 2008. In 1991, the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. It is also often cited as one of the greatest films of all time.

A sequel, &quot;The Two Jakes&quot;, was released in 1990, again starring Nicholson, who also directed, with Robert Towne returning to write the screenplay. The film failed to match the acclaim of its predecessor.

==Plot==

In 1930s Los Angeles, a woman calling herself Evelyn Mulwray hires private investigator J. J. &quot;Jake&quot; Gittes to trail her husband Hollis, the chief engineer at the Department of Water and Power. Gittes photographs Hollis in the company of a young woman and the pictures make their way into the &quot;Post-Record&quot;, exposing their apparent affair. Gittes is then confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray, who threatens to sue him. He concludes that the imposter was using him to discredit Hollis.

Gittes crosses paths with his former colleague, LAPD Lieutenant Lou Escobar, when Hollis&#x27;s corpse is found in a reservoir. He discovers that huge quantities of water are being released from the reservoir each night, despite the fact that LA is in the midst of a drought. Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill warns him off, and Gittes has his nose slashed by one of Mulvihill&#x27;s henchmen.

Now working for Evelyn, Gittes investigates Hollis&#x27;s death. He learns that Hollis was once the business partner of Evelyn&#x27;s wealthy father, Noah Cross. Cross offers to double Gittes&#x27;s fee if he finds Hollis&#x27;s supposed mistress, who has disappeared. Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions, the woman who posed as Evelyn. She refuses to say who hired her, but urges Gittes to check the &quot;Post-Record&quot; obituary section.

Public records reveal that much of the Northwest Valley has recently changed ownership. Gittes recognizes one of the buyers&#x27; names from the obituary section; the obituary indicates that he had been dead for a week when the deal was closed. Gittes and Evelyn bluff their way into the retirement home where the buyer had lived and discover that many of the other residents are &quot;buyers&quot; too, although they have no knowledge of this fact. A suspicious staff member calls Mulvihill, but Gittes and Evelyn escape him and his thugs and hide at her mansion, where they sleep together. Evelyn leaves after an urgent phone call, and Gittes follows her to a house where he sees her comforting the missing girl. He accuses her of holding the girl hostage, but Evelyn claims she is her sister, Katherine.

An anonymous call draws Gittes to Ida&#x27;s apartment, where he finds her body and is confronted by Escobar. Escobar reveals that Hollis had saltwater in his lungs, indicating that he did not die in the reservoir. He suspects Evelyn murdered him and tells Gittes to produce her quickly. At the Mulwray mansion, Gittes finds the servants packing up the house, and retrieves a pair of eyeglasses from the saltwater garden pond.

Gittes confronts Evelyn about Katherine, whom she now claims is her daughter. Frustrated, he repeatedly slaps Evelyn until she breaks down and reveals that Katherine is both her sister and daughter; the girl&#x27;s father is Cross, who raped Evelyn when she was 15. She tells Gittes that the eyeglasses he found did not belong to Hollis.

Gittes arranges for the women to flee to Mexico and instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler&#x27;s home in Chinatown. He summons Cross to the Mulwray residence, having deduced that Cross dropped his glasses when he drowned Hollis in the pond. Cross reveals that he is behind both the water shortage and the land grab in the Northwest Valley. Once the land is his, he will obtain a contract from the city to build a reservoir there. He discredited and killed Hollis when the latter came close to uncovering the plan.

Cross has Mulvihill take the glasses from Gittes at gunpoint. Gittes is then forced to drive them to the rendezvous in Chinatown, where the police are waiting. Escobar takes Gittes into custody as Cross approaches Katherine, identifying himself as her grandfather. Desperate to escape him, Evelyn shoots Cross in the arm and drives away with Katherine, but the police open fire, killing Evelyn. Cross pulls a screaming Katherine away, while Escobar orders the traumatized Gittes released. As he is led away by his associates, one of them tells him: &quot;Forget it, Jake. It&#x27;s Chinatown.&quot;

==Production==
===Background===
In 1971, producer Robert Evans offered Towne $175,000 to write a screenplay for &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1974), but Towne felt he could not better the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. Instead, Towne asked Evans for $25,000 to write his own story, &quot;Chinatown&quot;, to which Evans agreed. Towne had originally hoped to also direct &quot;Chinatown&quot;, but realized that by taking Evans&#x27; money, he would lose control of the project&#x27;s future and his role as a director.

&quot;Chinatown&quot; is set in 1937 and portrays the manipulation of a critical municipal resource—water—by a cadre of shadowy oligarchs. It was the first part of Towne&#x27;s planned trilogy about the character J. J. Gittes, the foibles of the Los Angeles power structure, and the subjugation of public good by private greed. The second part, &quot;The Two Jakes&quot;, has Gittes caught up in another grab for a natural resource—oil—in the 1940s. It was directed by Jack Nicholson and released in 1990, but the second film&#x27;s commercial and critical failure scuttled plans to make &quot;Gittes vs. Gittes&quot;, about the third finite resource—land—in Los Angeles, circa 1968.

===Origins===
The character of Hollis Mulwray was inspired by and loosely based on Irish immigrant William Mulholland (1855–1935) according to Mulholland&#x27;s granddaughter. Mulholland was the superintendent and chief engineer of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who oversaw the construction of the 230-mile (370-km) aqueduct that carries water from the Owens Valley to Los Angeles. Mulholland was considered by many to be the man who made Los Angeles possible by building the Los Angeles Aqueduct in the early 1900s. The 233 mile long feat of engineering brought the water necessary for urban expansion from the Owens Valley to a Los Angeles whose growth was constrained by the limits of the Los Angeles River. Mulholland credits Fred Eaton, then mayor of Los Angeles, with the idea to secure water for the city from the Owens Valley.

Although the character of Hollis Mulwray was relatively minor in the film and he was killed in the early part of the movie, the events of Mulholland&#x27;s life were portrayed through both the character of Mulwray and other figures in the movie. This portrayal, along with other changes to actual events that inspired &quot;Chinatown&quot;, such as the time frame which was some thirty years earlier than that of the movie, were some of the liberties with facts of Mulholland&#x27;s life that the movie takes.

Author Vincent Brook considers real-life Mulholland to be split, in the film, into &quot;noble Water and Power chief Hollis Mulwray&quot; and &quot;mobster muscle Claude Mulvihill&quot;, just as Land syndicate and Combination members, who &quot;exploited their insider knowledge&quot; on account of &quot;personal greed&quot;, are &quot;condensed into the singular, and singularly monstrous, Noah Cross&quot;.

In the film, Mulwray opposes the dam wanted by Noah Cross and the city of Los Angeles, for reasons of engineering and safety, arguing he would not repeat his previous mistake, when his dam broke resulting in hundreds of deaths. This alludes to the St. Francis Dam disaster of March 12, 1928. Unlike the character of Mulwray, who was concerned about the dam in &quot;Chinatown&quot;, Mulholland&#x27;s role in the disaster diverged from the events in the film. Mulholland had inspected the St. Francis Dam after the dam keeper Tony Harnischfeger requested that Mulholland personally inspect the dam after Harnischfeger became concerned about the safety of the dam upon discovering cracks and brown water leaking from the base of the dam, which indicated to him the erosion of the dam&#x27;s foundation. Mulholland inspected the dam at around 10:30 in the morning, declaring that all was well with the structure. Just before midnight that same evening, a massive failure of the dam occurred. The dam&#x27;s failure inundated the Santa Clara River Valley, including the town of Santa Paula, with flood water, causing the deaths of at least 431 people. The event effectively ended Mulholland&#x27;s career.

The plot of Chinatown is also drawn not just from the diversion of water from the Owens Valley via the aqueduct but also from another actual event. In the movie, water is being purposely released in order to drive the land owners out and create support for a dam through an artificial drought. The event that the movie refers to occurred in late 1903 and 1904 when underground water levels plummeted and water usage rose precipitously. Rather than a deliberate release, Mulholland was able to figure out that because of faulty valves and gates in the water system, large quantities of water were being released in the overflow sewer system and then into the ocean. Mulholland was able to stop the leaks.

===Script===
According to Robert Towne, both Carey McWilliams&#x27;s &quot;Southern California Country: An Island on the Land&quot; (1946) and a &quot;West&quot; magazine article called &quot;Raymond Chandler&#x27;s L.A.&quot; inspired his original screenplay. In a letter to McWilliams, Towne wrote that &quot;Southern California Country&quot; &quot;really changed my life. It taught me to look at the place where I was born, and convinced me to write about it&quot;.

Towne wrote the screenplay with Jack Nicholson in mind. He took the title (and the exchange &quot;What did you do in Chinatown?&quot; / &quot;As little as possible&quot;) from a Hungarian vice cop, who had worked in Los Angeles&#x27;s Chinatown, dealing with its confusion of dialects and gangs. The vice cop thought that &quot;police were better off in Chinatown doing nothing, because you could never tell what went on there&quot; and whether what a cop did helped or furthered the exploitation of victims.

Polanski first learned of the script through Nicholson, as they had been searching for a suitable joint project, and the producer Robert Evans was excited at the thought that Polanski&#x27;s direction would create a darker, more cynical, and European vision of the United States. Polanski was initially reluctant to return to Los Angeles (it was only a few years since the murder of his pregnant wife Sharon Tate), but was persuaded on the strength of the script.

Towne wanted Cross to die and Evelyn Mulwray to survive, but the screenwriter and director argued over it, with Polanski insisting on a tragic end: &quot;I knew that if &quot;Chinatown&quot; was to be special, not just another thriller where the good guys triumph in the final reel, Evelyn had to die&quot;. They parted ways over this dispute and Polanski wrote the final scene a few days before it was shot.

The original script was more than 180 pages and included a narration by Gittes; Polanski cut and reordered the story so the audience and Gittes unraveled the mysteries at the same time.

===Characters and casting===
* J. J. Gittes was named after Nicholson&#x27;s friend, producer Harry Gittes.
* Evelyn Mulwray is, according to Towne, intended to initially seem the classic &quot;black widow&quot; character typical of lead female characters in film noir, but is eventually revealed to be a tragic victim. Jane Fonda was strongly considered for the role, but Polanski insisted on Dunaway.
* Noah Cross: Towne said that Huston was, after Nicholson, the second-best-cast actor in the film and that he made the Cross character menacing, through his courtly performance.
* Polanski appears in a cameo as the gangster who cuts Gittes&#x27; nose. The effect was accomplished with a special knife which could have actually cut Nicholson&#x27;s nose if Polanski had not held it correctly.
* In 1974, after making Chinatown and while filming &quot;The Fortune&quot;, Nicholson was informed by &quot;Time&quot; magazine researchers that his &quot;sister&quot; was actually his mother, similarly to the revelation made in the film regarding Evelyn and Katherine.

===Filming===
Principal photography took place from October 1973 to January 1974. William A. Fraker accepted the cinematographer position from Polanski when Paramount agreed. He had worked with the studio previously on Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;. Robert Evans, never consulted about the decision, insisted that the offer be rescinded since he felt pairing Polanski and Fraker again would create a team with too much control over the project and complicate the production.

Between Fraker and the eventual choice John A. Alonzo, the two compromised on Stanley Cortez, but Polanski grew frustrated with Cortez&#x27;s slow process, old fashioned compositional sensibility, and unfamiliarity with the Panavision equipment. Alonzo had worked on documentaries and shot film for &quot;National Geographic&quot; and for Jacques Cousteau. Alonzo was chosen for his fleetness and skill with natural light a few weeks into production. Alonzo understood that Polanski wanted realism in his lighting; &quot;He wants the soft red tile to look soft red.&quot; Ultimately, only a handful of scenes in the finished film, including the orange grove confrontation, were shot by Cortez. Because Polanski&#x27;s English was poor, Alonzo and Polanski would communicate in Italian, which Alonzo would then translate for the crew. Polanski was rigorous in his framing and use of Alonzo&#x27;s vision, making the actors strictly adhere to blocking to accommodate the camera and lighting.

In keeping with a technique Polanski attributes to Raymond Chandler, all of the events of the film are seen subjectively through the main character&#x27;s eyes; for example, when Gittes is knocked unconscious, the film fades to black and fades in when he awakens. Gittes appears in every scene of the film. This subjectivity is the same construction used in Francis Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Conversation&quot; in which the main character, Harry Caul (Gene Hackman), appears in every scene in the film. &quot;The Conversation&quot; began shooting eleven months prior to &quot;Chinatown&quot;.

===Soundtrack===

Jerry Goldsmith composed and recorded the film&#x27;s score in ten days, after producer Robert Evans rejected Phillip Lambro&#x27;s original effort at the last minute. It received an Academy Award nomination and remains widely praised, ranking ninth on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the top 25 American film scores. Goldsmith&#x27;s score, with &quot;haunting&quot; trumpet solos by Hollywood studio musician and MGM&#x27;s first trumpet Uan Rasey, was released through ABC Records and features 12 tracks at a running time just over 30 minutes. It was later reissued on CD by the Varèse Sarabande label. Rasey related that Goldsmith &quot;told [him] to play it sexy — but like it&#x27;s not good sex!&quot;

==Historical background==
In his 2004 film essay and documentary &quot;Los Angeles Plays Itself&quot;, film scholar Thom Andersen lays out the complex relationship between &quot;Chinatown&quot;″s script and its historical background:&quot;Chinatown&quot; isn&#x27;t a docudrama, it&#x27;s a fiction. The water project it depicts isn&#x27;t the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, engineered by William Mulholland before the First World War. &quot;Chinatown&quot; is set in 1937, not 1905. The Mulholland-like figure—&quot;Hollis Mulwray&quot;—isn&#x27;t the chief architect of the project, but rather its strongest opponent, who must be discredited and murdered. Mulwray is against the &quot;Alto Vallejo Dam&quot; because it&#x27;s unsafe, not because it&#x27;s stealing water from somebody else... But there are echoes of Mulholland&#x27;s aqueduct project in &quot;Chinatown&quot;... Mulholland&#x27;s project enriched its promoters through insider land deals in the San Fernando Valley, just like the dam project in &quot;Chinatown&quot;. The disgruntled San Fernando Valley farmers of &quot;Chinatown&quot;, forced to sell off their land at bargain prices because of an artificial drought, seem like stand-ins for the Owens Valley settlers whose homesteads turned to dust when Los Angeles took the water that irrigated them. The &quot;Van Der Lip Dam&quot; disaster, which Hollis Mulwray cites to explain his opposition to the proposed dam, is an obvious reference to the collapse of the Saint Francis Dam in 1928. Mulholland built this dam after completing the aqueduct and its failure was the greatest man-made disaster in the history of California. These echoes have led many viewers to regard &quot;Chinatown&quot;, not only as docudrama, but as truth—the real secret history of how Los Angeles got its water. And it has become a ruling metaphor of the non-fictional critiques of Los Angeles development.

==Analysis and interpretation==
In a 1975 issue of &quot;Film Quarterly&quot;, Wayne D. McGinnis compared &quot;Chinatown&quot; to &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; by Sophocles. He suggested that a &quot;wasteland motif predominates in both works&quot;, in which a character (Noah Cross in &quot;Chinatown&quot; and Oedipus in &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;) uses &quot;a plague on a city&quot; to get into public power and then harbor corruption. McGinnis wrote that both works allude to &quot;a sterility of moral values in its own era&quot;: of Athens in &quot;a time of intellectual upheaval [...] after the heroic battle of Marathon&quot; in &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and of America in the Watergate era in &quot;Chinatown&quot;. He also argued that in the film, director Roman Polanski splits Sophocles&#x27; Oedipus into two morally polar figures, with the film&#x27;s protagonist Detective Jake Gittes paralleling the &quot;good&quot; Oedipus: the one uncovering the source of corruption. McGinnis asserted that after &quot;confronting the web of evil perpetrated by Cross [...] Gittes is the Oedipus whose success, to the use the words of Cleanth Brooks and Robert B. Heilman, &#x27;has tended to blind [him] to possibilities which pure reason fails to see&#x27;&quot;. McGinnis concluded that &quot;There is finally pity for the doomed, ignorant Gittes, just as there is pity for the blind Oedipus in Sophocles&quot;, however, &quot;Gittes&#x27; real sight, like Oedipus, comes too late&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===

The film earned $29 million or the equivalent of approximately $185.5 million in 2025 dollars at the North American box office.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Chinatown&quot; holds an approval rating of 98% based on 147 reviews, with an average rating of 9.40/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;As bruised and cynical as the decade that produced it, this noir classic benefits from Robert Towne&#x27;s brilliant screenplay, director Roman Polanski&#x27;s steady hand, and wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway&quot;. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 92 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Roger Ebert added it to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list, saying that Nicholson&#x27;s performance was &quot;key in keeping &quot;Chinatown&quot; from becoming just a genre crime picture&quot;, along with Towne&#x27;s screenplay, concluding that the film &quot;seems to settle easily beside the original noirs&quot;.

Although the film was widely acclaimed by prominent critics upon its release, Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was not impressed with the screenplay as compared to the film&#x27;s predecessors, saying, &quot;Mr. Polanski and Mr. Towne have attempted nothing so witty and entertaining, being content instead to make a competently stylish, more or less thirties-ish movie that continually made me wish I were back seeing &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; or &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;&quot;, but noted Nicholson&#x27;s performance, calling it the film&#x27;s &quot;major contribution to the genre&quot;.

==Subsequent works==
A sequel film, &quot;The Two Jakes&quot;, was released in 1990, again starring Nicholson, who also directed, with Robert Towne returning to write the screenplay. It was not met with the same financial or critical success as the first film.

A prequel television series by David Fincher and Towne for Netflix about Gittes starting his agency was reported to be in the works in November 2019.

A film about the making of &quot;Chinatown&quot;, based on the non-fiction book &quot;The Big Goodbye: Chinatown and the Last Years of Hollywood&quot;, was reported in August 2020 to be in the works, with Ben Affleck as director and writer.

==Legacy==
Towne&#x27;s screenplay has become legendary among critics and filmmakers, often cited as one of the best examples of the craft, though Polanski decided on the fatal final scene. While it has been reported that Towne envisioned a happy ending, he has denied these claims and said simply that he initially found Polanski&#x27;s ending to be excessively melodramatic. He explained in a 1997 interview: &quot;The way I had seen it was that Evelyn would kill her father but end up in jail for it, unable to give the real reason why it happened. And the detective [Jack Nicholson] couldn&#x27;t talk about it either, so it was bleak in its own way&quot;. Towne retrospectively concluded that &quot;Roman was right&quot;, later arguing that Polanski&#x27;s stark and simple ending, due to the complexity of the events preceding it, was more fitting than his own, which he described as equally bleak but &quot;too complicated and too literary&quot;.

&quot;Chinatown&quot; brought more public awareness to the land dealings and disputes over water rights, which arose while drawing Los Angeles&#x27; water supply from the Owens Valley in the 1910s.

<text>Descriptive notation is a chess notation system based on abbreviated natural language. Its distinctive features are that it refers to files by the piece that occupies the back rank square in the starting position and that it describes each square two ways depending on whether it is from White or Black&#x27;s point of view. It was common in English, Spanish and French chess literature until about 1980. In most other languages, the more concise algebraic notation was in use. Since 1981, FIDE no longer recognizes descriptive notation for the purposes of dispute resolution, and algebraic notation is now the accepted international standard.

==Description==
===Nomenclature===
With the exception of the knight, each piece is abbreviated as the first letter of its name: K for king, Q for queen, R for rook, B for bishop, and P for pawn. As &quot;knight&quot; begins with the same letter as &quot;king&quot;, it is abbreviated as either N or Kt, the first being the modern convention. In 1944, &quot;Chess Review&quot; received many letters debating the change from Kt to N.

Each square has two names, depending on the viewpoint of White or Black. Each is given a name corresponding to the piece that occupies the first at the start of the game. Thus, in English descriptive notation the queen&#x27;s file is named &quot;Q&quot; and the king&#x27;s file is named &quot;K&quot;. Since there are two each of the remaining pieces on the first rank, it is necessary to distinguish between them. The pieces on the queen&#x27;s side of the board (to White&#x27;s left; to Black&#x27;s right) are named with respect to the queen, i.e. &quot;queen&#x27;s rook&quot;, &quot;queen&#x27;s knight&quot; and &quot;queen&#x27;s bishop&quot;; and have the shortened names &quot;QR&quot;, &quot;QN&quot; and &quot;QB&quot;, respectively. Similarly, the pieces on the king&#x27;s side (White&#x27;s right; Black&#x27;s left) are named with respect to the king, i.e. &quot;king&#x27;s rook&quot;, &quot;king&#x27;s knight&quot; and &quot;king&#x27;s bishop&quot;; and have the shortened names &quot;KR&quot;, &quot;KN&quot; and &quot;KB&quot;. The rank is given a number, ranging from 1 to 8, with rank 1 being closest to the player. In 19th century chess literature the first rank is usually called simply the &quot;[piece]&#x27;s square&quot;, so &quot;K1&quot; (&quot;King One&quot;) is called &quot;King&#x27;s square&quot; (K. Sq.). Some players omitted both the &quot;1&quot; and the &quot;sq&quot;, so &quot;Rook to King 1&quot; was written R–K.

This method of naming the squares means that each square has one name from White&#x27;s point of view and another from Black&#x27;s. For a full diagram of the board using this naming method, see the image above.

When recording a move by White, the naming from White&#x27;s point of view is used; when recording a move by Black, the naming from Black&#x27;s point of view is used.

Spanish descriptive notation uses a similar system, with a few differences:
* The initials to identify the pieces are taken from the equivalent Spanish words: R = &quot;rey&quot; (king), D = &quot;dama&quot; (queen, ), T = &quot;torre&quot; (rook), C = &quot;caballo&quot; (knight), A = &quot;alfil&quot; (bishop, ) and P = &quot;peón&quot; (pawn). The files are named after the initials of the pieces on the first rank, with those on the queen&#x27;s side being suffixed by the letter &quot;D&quot;, and those on the king&#x27;s side suffixed by the letter &quot;R&quot;. From White&#x27;s left to right along the first rank this yields: TD, CD, AD, D, R, AR, CR, TR.
* The dash, which in English descriptive notation symbolizes the word &quot;to&quot;, is omitted.
* The numerical rank is identified &quot;before&quot; the file, e.g. &quot;4R&quot; is equivalent to &quot;K4&quot; (e4 in algebraic notation).

In Spanish descriptive notation the Sicilian Defence (1. P–K4 P–QB4 in English) would be written 1. P4R P4AD (). This is also the method used in French descriptive notation.

===Notation for moves===
Each move is notated by a sequence of characters that is structured based on the move&#x27;s type. Special indicators are added to the end of the sequence if relevant.

* &quot;Non-capturing move&quot;: A move without capture is notated by the piece&#x27;s name, a hyphen and the destination square, e.g. N–QB3 (knight to queen&#x27;s bishop 3) and P–QN4 (pawn to queen&#x27;s knight 4). 
* &#x27;: A capture is notated by the piece&#x27;s name, a cross (×), and the name of the piece captured, e.g. Q×N (queen captures knight).
* &quot;Castling&quot;: The notation O-O is used for castling and O-O-O for castling . The word &quot;Castles&quot; is sometimes used instead, particularly in older literature, in which case it may be necessary to disambiguate between kingside and queenside castling; this may be done by specifying the rook or side, i.e. &quot;Castles KR,&quot; &quot;Castles Q,&quot;or &quot;Castles queenside&quot;.
* &quot;Promotion&quot;: Parentheses are used to indicate promotion, with the promotion piece enclosed in parentheses, e.g. P–R8(Q). Sometimes a slash or an equal sign is used, e.g. P–N8/R, P×R=N.
* &quot;Special terms and symbols&quot;: Special indicators that are appended to the move include &quot;e.p.&quot; (&quot;en passant&quot;), &quot;ch&quot; or &quot;+&quot; (check), &quot;?&quot; (a question mark for a bad move), &quot;!&quot; (an exclamation mark for a good move), &quot;mate&quot; or &quot;++&quot; (checkmate), &quot;resigns&quot; and &quot;draw&quot;. 

Typically, the full designation for a piece or a file is shortened to just the last part (indicating type of piece) whenever this does not produce ambiguity. For example, the move KP–K4 would always be written P–K4 since only one pawn can move to K4 without capturing; the move Q–QB4 would be written Q–B4 whenever Q–KB4 is not a legal move. A pawn capturing a pawn may be shown as P×P if it is the only one possible, or as BP×P if only one of the player&#x27;s bishop&#x27;s pawns can capture a pawn, or as QBP×P, P×RP(R6) or P×QBP or other such variations.

Disambiguation of pieces using notations like QBP and KR becomes awkward once the pieces have left their starting positions (or for pawns, left their starting files), and is impossible for pieces created by promotion (such as a second queen). So as an alternative, moves may also be disambiguated by giving the starting square or the square of a capture, delimited by parentheses or a slash, e.g. B×N/QB6 or R(QR3)–Q3. Sometimes only the rank or file is indicated, e.g. R(6)×N.

When listing the moves of a game, first the move number is written, then the move by White followed by the move by Black. If there is no appropriate move by White to use (e.g. if the moves are interrupted by commentary) then an ellipsis (&quot;…&quot;) is used in its place.

==History==
In the earliest chess literature, natural language was used to describe moves. This is the ultimate source of all forms of descriptive notation. Over time, abbreviations became common, and a system of notation gradually evolved. For example, the common opening move 1.e4 was originally recorded as &quot;Pawn to King&#x27;s Fourth&quot; or similar; by the time of Howard Staunton&#x27;s &quot;The Chess-Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1847), this had been abbreviated to &quot;P. to K&#x27;s 4th.&quot;which was later further reduced to &quot;P–K4&quot;.

==Comparison to algebraic notation==
While descriptive notation is largely regarded as obsolete, it does have a few minor advantages over algebraic notation. By identifying each square with reference to the player on move, descriptive notation better reflects the symmetry of the game&#x27;s starting position (e.g. &quot;both players opened with P–QB4 and planned to play B–KN2 as soon as possible&quot;). Generic descriptions which refer to all four sectors of the board are also possible, e.g. &quot;all four bishops were developed on N2.&quot; Maxims such as &quot;a pawn on the seventh is worth two on the fifth&quot; make sense from both players&#x27; perspectives. Because the type of each captured piece is specified, it is easier to visualize the material balance at any point in the game when skimming over a . 

On the other hand, algebraic notation has several advantages. The notation for any given move is almost always more concise in algebraic notation than in descriptive notation; this can reduce the length of chess books and magazines by several pages. While confusion can arise in descriptive notation because each square has two names, no such problem exists in algebraic notation. Algebraic notation specifies a capturing piece&#x27;s destination square; meanwhile, because unambiguous captures lack coordinate information in descriptive notation, visualization is more taxing, since it requires remembering exactly which pieces are attacking which.

<text>The order Pinales in the division Pinophyta, class Pinopsida, comprises all the extant conifers. The distinguishing characteristic is the reproductive structure known as a cone produced by all Pinales. All of the extant conifers, such as Araucaria, cedar, celery-pine, cypress, fir, juniper, kauri, larch, pine, redwood, spruce, and yew, are included here. Some fossil conifers, however, belong to other distinct orders within the division Pinophyta.

Multiple molecular studies indicate this order being paraphyletic with respect to Gnetales, with studies recovering Gnetales as either a sister group to Pinaceae or being more derived than Pinaceae but sister to the rest of the group.

== Taxonomy ==

=== History ===

Brown (1825) first discerned that there were two groups of seed plants, distinguished by the form of seed development, based on whether the ovules were exposed, receiving pollen directly, or enclosed, which do not. Shortly afterwards, Brongniart (1828) coined the term &quot;Phanérogames gymnosperms&quot; to describe the former group. The distinction was then formalized by Lindley (1830), dividing what he referred to as the subclass Dicotyledons into two tribes, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms. In the gymnosperms (or Gymnospermae) Lindley included two orders, the Cycadeae and the Coniferae. In his final work (1853) he described Gymnogens as a class with four orders;
* Cycadeaceae (cycads)
* Pinaceae (conifers)
* Taxaceae (taxads)
* Gnetaceae

In contrast, Bentham and Hooker (1880) included only three orders in the class Gymnospermeae, by including taxads within Coniferae;
* Gnetaceae
* Coniferae
* Cycadaceae

In the Engler system (1903) Gymnospermae is listed as a subdivision (&quot;Unterabteilung&quot;) and adopted more of a splitter approach, including extinct taxa, with the following six classes;
* Cycadales
* Bennettitales
* Cordaitales
* Ginkgoales
* Coniferae
* Gnetales

During this period, Gorozhankin published his treatise on Gymnosperms (1895), for which he bears the botanical authority for Pinales, . In his classification, Gymnospermae (alternatively named Archespermae) was a class of the division Archegoniatae, divided into subclasses;
* Cycadoideae
* Peucideae (Coniferae)

A system of two groups was maintained by the most commonly used classification in the twentieth century, the revision of the Engler system by Pilger (1926), who grouped 12 families of the Gymnospermae subdivision into 2 classes;
* Coniferales (Coniferae)
* Gnetales

The treatment of Gymnosperms as two groups, though with varying composition and names, was followed for most of the twentieth century, including the systems of Chamberlain (1935), Benson (1957) and Cronquist (1960).

In the latter, Cronquist divided Gymnospermae into two divisions; 
* division Coniferophyta 
** class Coniferae
** class Chlamydospermae (Gnetales)
* division Cycadophyta
** class Cycadae

Benson,(1957) who introduced the term Pinales, divided gymnosperms into four classes;

* Conopsida (conifers, including Pinales)
* Ephedropsida
* Gnetopsida
* Cycadopsida

In a later revision, in collaboration with two other taxonomists (1966), Cronquist merged all the gymnosperms into a single division, Pinophyta, with three subdivisions reflecting the main lineages;
* Cycadicae
* Pinicae
* Gneticae

In the era of molecular phylogenetics, De-Zhi and colleagues (2004) once again proposed a division of 12 gymnosperm families into two classes;
* Cycadopsida
** order Cycadales
* Coniferopsida
** subclass Multinervidae (6 orders)
** subclass Taxidae
*** order Taxales
*** order Pinales

With the development of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group came a major realignment of the linear classification of the land plants, by Chase and Reveal (2009). In this system, the land plants form a class, Equisetopsida &quot;s.l.&quot; (&quot;sensu lato&quot;) or &quot;sensu&quot; Chase &amp; Reveal, also known as embryophytes or Embryophyceae &quot;nom. illeg.&quot;. Class Equisetopsida &quot;s.l.&quot; is divided into 14 subclades as subclasses, including Magnoliidae (angiosperms). The gymnosperms are represented by four of these subclasses, placing them in a sister group relationship to angiosperms. Subclasses (number of orders);
* subclass Cycadidae (1)
* subclass Ginkgooidae (1)
* subclass Gnetidae (3)
* subclass Pinidae (conifers) (1)

=== Controversies ===

Gymnosperm (Acrogymnospermae) taxonomy has been considered controversial, and lacks consensus. As taxonomic classification transformed from being based solely on plant morphology to molecular phylogenetics, the number of taxonomic publications increased considerably after 2008, however, these approaches have not been uniform. A taxonomic classification has been complicated by the relationship of extant to extinct taxa, and within extinct taxa, and particularly the placement of Gnetophyta. The latter have been variously classified as basal to all gymnosperms, sister group to conifers (‘gnetifer’ hypothesis) or sister to Pinaceae (‘gnepine’ hypothesis) in which they are classified within the conifers. The extant conifers most likely form a monophyletic group. In 2018, the Gymnosperm Phylogeny Group was established, analogous to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group and Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group, with the intention of reaching a consensus.

=== Phylogeny ===

Gymnosperms form a group of four subclasses among the spermatophytes (seed bearing plants). In turn, the seed plants together with the monilophyte fern subclasses make up the tracheophytes (vascular plants), part of the class Equisetopsida (embryophytes or land plants), as opposed to the green algae. Among the seed plants, the gymnosperms are a sister group to the subclass Magnoliidae (angiosperms or flowering plants).

There are about 1000 extant gymnosperm species, distributed over about 12 families and 83 genera. Many of these genera are monotypic (41%), and another 27% are oligotypic (2–5 species). The four subclasses have also been treated as divisions of the Spermatophytes. Alternative names and the approximate number of genera and species in each are;
* Cycadidae (Cycadophyta, cycads 10, 300)
* Ginkgoidae (Ginkgophyta, ginkgo 1, 1)
* Gnetidae (Gnetophyta 3, 100)
* Pinidae (Pinophyta, conifers 70, 600)

The term Pinophyta has also been used to include all conifers, extinct and extant, with Pinales representing all the extant conifers.
Christenhusz and colleagues extended the system of Chase and Reveal to provide a revised classification of gymnosperms in 2011, based on the above four subclades. In this scheme, the Pinidae comprise three orders, including Pinales, and 6 families;
* Pinales (Pinaceae) 
* Araucariales (Araucariaceae, Podocarpaceae)
* Cupressales (Sciadopityaceae, Cupressaceae, Taxaceae)

However, the exact phylogeny remained a topic that was &#x27;hotly debated&quot;, in particular whether the main lineages were best represented by the four subclasses of Christenhusz and colleagues or the more traditional five clades (cycads, ginkgos, cupressophytes, Pinaceae and gnetophytes). In 2014 the first complete molecular phylogeny was published, based on 90 species representing all extant genera. This established cycads as the basal group, followed by Ginkgoaceae, as sister to the remaining gymnosperms, and supporting the ‘gnepine’ hypothesis. This analysis favours the five clade hypothesis, the remaining clade following divergence of the Pinidae, are referred to as the conifer II clade, or cupressophytes, in distinction from the conifer I clade (Gnetidae, Pinidae). This clade, in turn, has two lineages. The first consisting of Sciadopityaceae and the Araucariales, the second being the Cupressales. In the Christenhusz scheme, the Sciadopityaceae were considered to be within Cupressales. The term Cupressaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; refers to the inclusion of Taxodiaceae. These relationships are shown in this cladogram, although no formal taxonomic revision was undertaken. 

A more comprehensive analysis was undertaken by Ran and colleagues in 2018, as part of a detailed phylogeny of all seed plants. This forms the basis of the Tracheophyte Phylogeny Poster and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website.

=== Subdivision ===

Historically conifers, in the order Pinales have been considered to consist of six to seven extant families, based on the classification of class Coniferae by Pilger (1926), considered the standard through most of the twentieth century. These families were treated as a single order, in distinction to some earlier systems. His families were; 
* Araucariaceae
* Cupressaceae (cypresses, juniper, redwood)
* Pinaceae (firs, pines, cedars, larch, spruce)
* Podocarpaceae
* Taxaceae (yews) 
* Cephalotaxaceae
* Taxodiaceae

Subsequent revisions merged the Taxodiaceae and Cupressaceae, and placed &quot;Sciadopitys&quot;, formerly in Cupressaceae, into a separate family (Sciadopityaceae). Cephalotaxaceae had previously been recognized as a separate family, but was subsequently included in Taxaceae. Similarly Phyllocladaceae were included in Podocarpaceae. Yews (Taxaceae) have sometimes been treated as a separate order (Taxales).

Christenhusz and colleagues (2011) included only one family in Pinales, Pinaceae, a practice subsequently followed by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website and the Gymnosperm Database. In this restricted model Pinales (Pinaceae) comprisea 11 genera and about 225 species, all of the other conifers originally included in this order, being included in other orders such as Cupressales.

<doc id="68099" wikidata="Q2061752" url="?curid=68099" title="Kiss Me Deadly">
<text>Kiss Me Deadly is a 1955 American film noir produced and directed by Robert Aldrich, starring Ralph Meeker, Albert Dekker, Paul Stewart, Juano Hernandez, and Wesley Addy. It also features Maxine Cooper and Cloris Leachman appearing in their feature film debuts. The film follows a private investigator in Los Angeles who becomes embroiled in a complex mystery after picking up a female hitchhiker. The screenplay was written by Aldrich and A.I. Bezzerides, based on the 1952 crime novel &quot;Kiss Me, Deadly&quot; by Mickey Spillane.

&quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; grossed $726,000 in the United States and $226,000 overseas. The film received the condemnation of the Kefauver Commission, which accused it of being &quot;designed to ruin young viewers&quot;, a verdict that director Aldrich protested. Despite initial critical disapproval, it is considered one of the most important and influential film noirs of all time.

The film has been noted as a stylistic precursor to the French New Wave, and has been cited as a major influence on a number of filmmakers, including François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Alex Cox, and Quentin Tarantino. In 1999, &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Mike Hammer is a tough private investigator who, with the assistance of his associate and lover Velda, typically works on &quot;penny-ante divorce cases.&quot; One evening, Hammer is forced to suddenly stop his sports car by Christina, an escapee from a nearby psychiatric hospital, who is running barefoot along the road, wearing nothing but a trench coat. Hammer gives her a ride. Christina asks him, whatever happens, to &quot;remember me,&quot; alluding to a poem by Christina Rossetti. Thugs waylay them, and Hammer hears Christina screaming as she is tortured to death. The thugs then push Hammer&#x27;s car off a cliff with Christina&#x27;s body and an unconscious Hammer inside.

Hammer comes to in a hospital with Velda hovering over him. He decides to investigate Christina&#x27;s death, believing that it &quot;must be connected with something big.&quot; He retrieves a book of poetry from the dead woman&#x27;s apartment and reads aloud several lines from Rosetti&#x27;s poem, &quot;Remember&quot;, as he tries to figure out what that something might be.

Hammer goes to the apartment of Lily Carver, who says she was Christina&#x27;s roommate. Lily tells Hammer she is in hiding and asks him to protect her. She is after a mysterious box that, she believes, has contents worth a fortune. Hammer later arrives at the lavish mansion of gangster Carl Evello, who also seeks the box. Hammer fends off Charlie Max and Sugar Smallhouse, two of Evello&#x27;s henchmen, and then confronts Evello, who is initially impressed by Hammer&#x27;s brazenness and offers to work out a deal, but swiftly retracts the offer.

Hammer&#x27;s friend, Nick the auto mechanic, who helped defuse bombs planted in Hammer&#x27;s car, is then murdered. Carl&#x27;s thugs kidnap Hammer and take him to an isolated beach house, where another of their associates, Dr. G. E. Soberin (revealed to be responsible for the murders of Christina and Nick), injects him with sodium pentothal before interrogating him.

Carl Evello comes in to question him, but gets nothing. Mike manages to work one hand free from the ropes. He calls out and Carl returns. He lures Carl over and knocks him out. Mike pretends to be Evello and summons Sugar in to kill Mike. Sugar enters the darkened room and stabs his boss, thinking it is Mike. Mike kills Sugar and escapes. He locates the suspiciously hot box, which burns his arm, in a locker at the Hollywood Athletic Club. But when he goes to his friend Lieutenant Murphy for help, Murphy warns him off, hinting it has to do with a top-secret government experiment akin to the Manhattan Project.

Hammer goes back to the beach house. Before he arrives, Lily, now revealed to be an imposter named Gabrielle, is there with Soberin. They have the box, and have Velda locked in a bedroom. Gabrielle shoots Soberin to get the box for herself. With his dying words, Soberin urges the insatiably curious Gabrielle not to open it.

When Hammer comes into the room, Gabrielle says &quot;Kiss me, Mike&quot; and shoots him. She then opens the box, which emits a blinding light and piercing sound. Gabrielle screams and bursts into flames. Hammer, wounded, struggles to his feet, and looks for Velda. Together, the pair flee the burning house, helping each other along the beach to the ocean as the house explodes behind them and becomes consumed in flames.

==Production==
===Development===
In October 1954 Robert Aldrich announced he would produce and direct two Mickey Spillane stories the following year, for Parklane Productions, an independent company owned by Victor Saville. The stories would be &quot;Kiss Me, Deadly&quot; and &quot;My Gun Is Quick&quot;. Saville turned over control to Aldrich because he was busy on &quot;The Silver Chalice&quot;.

The screenplay was loosely adapted by A.I. Bezzerides with contributions from Aldrich, though it &quot;made no effort to follow the book’s convoluted plot, [though] both are structured around [a] search for a mysterious box.&quot;

===Differences from the novel===
&quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; departs from other Mike Hammer films in that Hammer never carries a gun. This is explained when Lt. Murphy tells Hammer his PI license and gun permit have been revoked. Although he is held at gunpoint, pistol whipped, and even shot, he complies with the gun ban, relying only on his fists to hammer people into submission or worse. The screenplay also departs from Spillane&#x27;s novel, replacing the mafia conspiracy at the center of the novel with an apparent case of espionage and a mysterious suitcase serving as the film&#x27;s MacGuffin. The film further departs from the book by portraying Hammer not so much as a sleuth of the hardboiled school than as a sleazy, narcissistic bully, perhaps the darkest private detective in film noir.

Much to the derision of the local police, Hammer makes his living mostly by blackmailing adulterers, he or his secretary sometimes seducing and entrapping the targets themselves, a practice perhaps made even worse because Hammer seems to exploit the genuine affection that Velda feels for him to get her participation. He readily resorts to violence, whether he&#x27;s defending himself against the thugs Evello sends to kill him, breaking a potential informant&#x27;s treasured record to get him to talk,or roughing up a coroner who has the temerity to demand payment in return for a key that Christina had apparently swallowed before her death. Bezzerides wrote of the script: &quot;I wrote it fast because I had contempt for it... I tell you Spillane didn&#x27;t like what I did with his book. I ran into him at a restaurant and, boy, he didn&#x27;t like me&quot;.

===Los Angeles locations===
&quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; is a time capsule of Los Angeles, much of it filmed in the downtown neighborhood of Bunker Hill. Many of the locations disappeared in the urban development of the late 1960s, although a few remain.
* The Hill Crest Hotel, NE corner of Third and Olive Streets (Italian opera singer&#x27;s home)
* The Donigan &#x27;Castle&#x27;, a Victorian mansion at 325 S. Bunker Hill Avenue (where Cloris Leachman&#x27;s character lived, used for interior and exterior shots)
* Apartment Building, 10401 Wilshire Boulevard, NW corner of Wilshire and Beverly Glen (Hammer&#x27;s apartment building; still standing)
* Carl Evello&#x27;s Mansion, 603 Doheny Road, Beverly Hills, California
* Clay Street, an alley on Bunker Hill beneath the Angels Flight funicular (still operating), where Hammer parks his Corvette and then takes the back steps up to the Hill Crest Hotel, although when he approaches the hotel&#x27;s large porch, he is on the Third Street steps opposite Angels Flight
* Club Pigalle, 4800 block of Figueroa Avenue (the black jazz nightclub that Hammer frequents)
* Hollywood Athletic Club, 6525 W. Sunset Blvd. (where Hammer finds the radioactive box; still standing)

===Critical response and analysis===
Critics have generally viewed the film as a metaphor for the paranoia and fear of nuclear war that prevailed during the Cold War era. &quot;The great whatsit,&quot; as Velda refers to the object of Hammer&#x27;s quest, turns out to be a mysterious valise, hot to the touch because of the dangerous, glowing substance it contains, a metaphor for the atomic bomb. The film has been described as &quot;the definitive, apocalyptic, nihilistic, science-fiction film noir of all time – at the close of the classic noir period.&quot; A leftist at the time of the Hollywood blacklist, Bezzerides denied any conscious intention for this metaphor in his script, saying that &quot;I was having fun with it. I wanted to make every scene, every character, interesting.&quot;

Film critic Nick Schager wrote, &quot;Never was Mike Hammer&#x27;s name more fitting than in &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;, Robert Aldrich&#x27;s blisteringly nihilistic noir in which star Ralph Meeker embodies Mickey Spillane&#x27;s legendary P.I. with brute force savagery... The gumshoe&#x27;s subsequent investigation into the woman&#x27;s death doubles as a lacerating indictment of modern society&#x27;s dissolution into physical/moral/spiritual degeneracy – a reversion that ultimately leads to nuclear apocalypse and man&#x27;s return to the primordial sea – with the director&#x27;s knuckle-sandwich cynicism pummeling the genre&#x27;s romantic fatalism into a bloody pulp. &#x27;Remember me?&#x27; Aldrich&#x27;s sadistic, fatalistic masterpiece is impossible to forget&quot;. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 97% of its critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 8.1/10, based on 37 reviews. The consensus states, &quot;An intriguing, wonderfully subversive blend of art and commerce, &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; is an influential noir classic.&quot;

François Truffaut wrote, &quot;To appreciate &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;, you have to love movies passionately and to have a vivid memory of those evenings when you saw &quot;Scarface&quot;, &quot;Under Capricorn&quot;, &quot;Le sang d&#x27;un poète (Blood of a Poet)&quot;, &quot;Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne&quot;, and &quot;The Lady From Shanghai&quot;. We have loved films that had only one idea, or twenty, or even fifty. In Alrdich&#x27;s films, it is not unusual to encounter a new idea with each shot. In this movie the inventiveness is such that we don&#x27;t know what to look at--the images are almost too full, too fertile. Watching a film like this is such an intense experience that we want it to go last for hours. It is easy to picture its author as a man overflowing with vitality, as much at ease behind a camera as Henry Miller facing a blank page. This is the film of a young director who is not yet worried about restraint.&quot;

===Accolades===
===Home media===
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released the film on VHS as part of their &quot;Vintage Classics&quot; collection in 1999, and on DVD in 2001, with the alternative ending as a Special Feature. A digitally restored version of the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection in June 2011, and also includes the alternative ending.

===Revised ending===
The original ending of the American release of the film shows Hammer and Velda escaping from the burning house, staggering into the ocean as the words &quot;The End&quot; come over them on the screen. Sometime after its first release, the ending was altered on the film&#x27;s negative, removing 82 seconds of footage showing the escape, and instead superimposing &quot;The End&quot; over the burning house. This implied that Hammer and Velda perished in the blaze, which some have interpreted as an apocalyptic ending. In 1997, the original ending was restored after the missing footage was discovered in the vaults of the Directors Guild by Glenn Erickson.

==Influence==
Contemporary film scholars have named &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; as one of the most influential exemples of American film noir, praising its bleak and nihilistic tone, its version of pulp fiction archetypes, and its twist ending. Its apocalyptic elements earned it an entry in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;. &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; has been cited as a stylistic precursor of the French New Wave. François Truffaut has acknowledged its influence on his &quot;elliptic&quot; filmmaking style, as has Jean-Luc Godard. In the 1960s, both filmmakers touted the film as the single American film &quot;most responsible for the French New Wave.&quot; Homage is paid to the glowing suitcase MacGuffin in Alex Cox&#x27;s &quot;Repo Man&quot; (1984), Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994) and John Frankenheimer&#x27;s &quot;Ronin&quot; (1998). The &quot;shiny blue suitcase&quot; is mentioned with other famous MacGuffins in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;. When the Ark of the Covenant in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) is opened, the shot of Rene Belloq&#x27;s face melting is directly inspired by that of Gabrielle opening the suitcase.

In &quot;Southland Tales&quot; (2006), Richard Kelly pays homage to the film, showing the main characters watching the beginning on their television; later the opening of the case is shown on screens on board the mega-Zeppelin. Two notable rock acts have borrowed the film&#x27;s title for a song title. The first was the UK punk act Generation X, featuring singer Billy Idol, from their self titled debut LP (1978); this song would be also be featured on the soundtrack to &quot;SLC Punk!&quot; (1998). The second was a 1988 hit single from former Runaways lead guitarist and glam metal solo performer Lita Ford. In 1999, &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

<text>All That Heaven Allows is a 1955 American melodrama film directed by Douglas Sirk, produced by Ross Hunter, and adapted by Peg Fenwick from a novel by Edna L. Lee and Harry Lee. It stars Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson in a tale about the social complications that arise following the development of a romance between a well-to-do widow and a younger poorer man. In 1995, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

==Plot==

Cary Scott is an affluent widow in the town of Stoningham, in suburban New England, whose social life revolves around the weekend visits of her college-age son and daughter, her best friend&#x27;s country-club activities, and a few men vying for her affection. Feeling stuck in a rut, she becomes interested in Ron Kirby, her arborist. He is an intelligent, down-to-earth, and respectful, yet passionate, younger man, and she discovers he is content with his simple life outside the materialistic society in which they live. Ron introduces Cary to his friends, who seem to have no need for wealth or status, and their exuberance provides a welcome contrast to her staid existence.

Ron and Cary fall in love, and Ron proposes. Cary accepts, but she has concerns about the viability of their relationship, due to their different ages, classes, and lifestyles. These concerns are magnified when she tells her children and friends about the engagement and is met with a solid wall of disapproval, and, eventually, she breaks up with Ron. Particularly influential in her change of mind are her children&#x27;s protestations against Cary&#x27;s plan to sell the family home and move to Ron&#x27;s tree nursery, as they will not want to visit her there.

After spending most of the Christmas season alone, Cary misses her life with Ron, but she thinks she has missed her opportunity for happiness because she mistakenly believes Ron is seeing another woman. On Christmas, her daughter announces she will be getting married soon and her son says that, since he is likely going to study abroad and then work overseas, they should start thinking about selling their house, which is too big for just Cary. She is overwhelmed by how pointless her sacrifice was, and her spirits are not lifted when her children give her a television set to fill her empty life.

Cary goes to see a doctor about recurrent headaches she has started having, and he suggests they are being caused by her body punishing her for ending her relationship with Ron. Leaving the appointment, she runs into one of Ron&#x27;s friends, and in the course of their conversation she learns that Ron is still single. She goes to his property, but then changes her mind and leaves. Ron sees her from a precipice and excitedly, though unsuccessfully, tries to get her attention. The ground collapses out from under him, and he falls off the cliff.

That night, Ron&#x27;s friend tells Cary about the accident, and she hurries over to his house. She decides she no longer wants to allow other people to dictate how she lives her life and settles in to nurse Ron back to health. When Ron regains consciousness, Cary tells him that she has come home.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Screenplay===
Screenwriter Peg Fenwick wrote the screenplay for &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; based on the 394-page novel of the same name by Edna L. and Harry Lee. Notations made on various pages of a copy of the original screenplay owned by the New York Public Library indicate that the script was written in August 1954.

Some scenes in the script differ from those in the finished film. For instance, in the screenplay Rock Hudson&#x27;s character, Ron Kirby, lies on the grass eating his lunch, but in the final cut of the film, he has lunch with Jane Wyman&#x27;s character, Cary Scott.

Sirk considered having Hudson&#x27;s character die at the end of the film, but Ross Hunter, the film&#x27;s producer, would not allow it, because he wanted a more positive ending.

===Development===
After the success of &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; in 1954, Universal-International Pictures wanted Sirk to make another film starring Wyman and Hudson. He found the screenplay for &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; &quot;rather impossible&quot;, but was able to restructure it and use the big budget to film and edit the work exactly the way he wanted.

Wyman was 38 when she played the film&#x27;s &quot;older woman&quot;, who scandalizes society and her grown-up children by becoming engaged to a younger man. Hudson, &quot;the younger man&quot;, was 29 at the time.

===Filming===
Some exteriors for the film were shot on &quot;Colonial Street&quot;, a studio backlot built by Paramount Pictures on the property of Universal Studios four years earlier and used in the film &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot;. The set was re-designed to mimic an upper-middle class New England town. The film contains only one visible crane shot, when the camera scans over the fictional town of Stoningham during the opening credits. Tracking and dollying shots were used frequently for interior shots. The set was later featured on the television series &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;.

===Music===
The music that recurs throughout the film is Consolation No. 3 in D-flat major by Franz Liszt, along with frequent snatches of the finale to Brahms&#x27;s First Symphony, the latter re-scored and sometimes elaborated. Also heard intermittently is &quot;Warum?&quot; (German for &quot;Why?&quot;) by Robert Schumann, from the Fantasiestücke, Op. 12.

== Release ==
The film was released in Great Britain on August 25, 1955, several months ahead of its US premiere. In the United States, it opened in Los Angeles on Christmas Day 1955, and in New York City on February 28, 1956. The US release followed an extensive advertising campaign focusing on popular women&#x27;s magazines such as &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Family Circle&quot;, &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot;, and &quot;Redbook,&quot; which referred to the film as a &quot;woman&#x27;s picture&quot;.

&quot;Motion Picture Daily&quot; reported that the film earned $16,000 on its opening day and did “above average” business in areas like Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans, and Jacksonville.

==Reception==
The film press compared the movie favorably to &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; (1954), which also starred Wyman and Hudson and was directed by Sirk. A review in &quot;Motion Picture Daily&quot; was generally positive and praised Sirk for his use of color and mise en scène, saying: &quot;In a print by Technicolor, the exterior shots and the interior settings are so beautifully photographed that they point up the action of the story with telling effect.&quot;

Although Sirk&#x27;s reputation waned in the 1960s—as he was dismissed as a director of dated and insubstantial Hollywood melodramas—it was revived in the 1970s due to the praise of New German Cinema directors like Rainer Werner Fassbinder and the publication of Jon Halliday&#x27;s &quot;Sirk on Sirk&quot; (1971), in which the filmmaker describes his aesthetic and (often-subversive) social perspective. His reputation, and that of &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot;, has grown since then, with critic Richard Brody describing him as a master of both melodrama and comedy, and the film as remarkable for its use of Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Walden&quot; as a homegrown American philosophy depicted as a &quot;vital and ongoing experience.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; has an approval rating of 91% based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The consensus summarizes: &quot;Big heart, big drama, and even bigger colors, &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; is tip top Douglas Sirk.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
In 1995, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress, and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==References in other films==
&quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; inspired Fassbinder&#x27;s &quot;Ali: Fear Eats the Soul&quot; (1974), in which a mature woman falls in love with an Arab man. It was spoofed by John Waters with his film &quot;Polyester&quot; (1981). Todd Haynes&#x27; &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; (2002) is an homage to Sirk&#x27;s work, in particular &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; and &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; (1959). François Ozon&#x27;s &quot;8 Women&quot; (&quot;8 Femmes&quot;, 2002) features winter scenes and deer reminiscent of this film.

<text>Logging is the process of cutting, processing, and moving trees to a location for transport. It may include skidding, on-site processing, and loading of trees or logs onto trucks or skeleton cars. In forestry, the term logging is sometimes used narrowly to describe the logistics of moving wood from the stump to somewhere outside the forest, usually a sawmill or a lumber yard. In common usage, however, the term may cover a range of forestry or silviculture activities.

Logging is the beginning of a supply chain that provides raw material for many products societies worldwide use for housing, construction, energy, and consumer paper products. Logging systems are also used to manage forests, reduce the risk of wildfires, and restore ecosystem functions, though their efficiency for these purposes has been challenged.

Logging frequently has negative impacts. The harvesting procedure itself may be illegal, including the use of corrupt means to gain access to forests; extraction without permission or from a protected area; the cutting of protected species; or the extraction of timber in excess of agreed limits. It may involve the so-called &quot;timber mafia&quot;. Excess logging can lead to irreparable harm to ecosystems, such as deforestation and biodiversity loss. Infrastructure for logging can also lead to other environmental degradation. These negative environmental impacts can lead to environmental conflict. Additionally, there is significant occupational injury risk involved in logging.

Logging can take many formats. Clearcutting (or &quot;block cutting&quot;) is not necessarily considered a type of logging but a harvesting or silviculture method. Cutting trees with the highest value and leaving those with lower value, often diseased or malformed trees, is referred to as high grading. It is sometimes called selective logging, and confused with selection cutting, the practice of managing stands by harvesting a proportion of trees. Logging usually refers to above-ground forestry logging. Submerged forests exist on land that has been flooded by damming to create reservoirs. Harvesting trees from forests submerged by flooding or dam creation is called underwater logging, a form of timber recovery.

==Clearcutting==
Clearcutting, or clearfelling, is a method of harvesting that removes essentially all the standing trees in a selected area. Depending on management objectives, a clearcut may or may not have reserve trees left to attain goals other than regeneration, including wildlife habitat management, mitigation of potential erosion or water quality concerns. Silviculture objectives for clearcutting, (for example, healthy regeneration of new trees on the site) and a focus on forestry distinguish it from deforestation. Other methods include shelterwood cutting, group selective, single selective, seed-tree cutting, patch cut, and retention cutting.

==Logging methods==

The above operations can be carried out by different methods, of which the following three are considered industrial methods:

=== / stem-only harvesting ===
Trees are felled and then delimbed and topped at the stump. The log is then transported to the landing, where it is bucked and loaded on a truck. This leaves the slash (and the nutrients it contains) in the cut area, where it must be further treated if wild land fires are of concern.

=== Whole-tree logging===

Trees and plants are felled and transported to the roadside with top and limbs intact. There have been advancements to the process which now allows a logger or harvester to cut the tree down, top, and delimb a tree in the same process. This ability is due to the advancement in the style felling head that can be used. The trees are then delimbed, topped, and bucked at the landing. This method requires that slash be treated at the landing. In areas with access to cogeneration facilities, the slash can be chipped and used for the production of electricity or heat. Full-tree harvesting also refers to utilization of the entire tree including branches and tops. This technique removes both nutrients and soil cover from the site and so can be harmful to the long-term health of the area if no further action is taken, however, depending on the species, many of the limbs are often broken off in handling so the result may not be as different from tree-length logging as it might seem.

===Cut-to-length logging===
Cut-to-length logging is the process of felling, delimbing, bucking, and sorting (pulpwood, sawlog, etc.) at the stump area, leaving limbs and tops in the forest. Mechanical harvesters fell the tree, delimb, and buck it, and place the resulting logs in bunks to be brought to the landing by a skidder or forwarder. This method is routinely available for trees up to in diameter.

==Transporting logs==

Logging methods have changed over time, driven by advancements in transporting timber from remote areas to markets. These shifts fall into three main eras: the manual logging era before the 1880s, the railroad logging era from the 1880s to World War II, and the modern mechanized era that began after the war.

=== Pre-1880s: Pre-Industrial Era ===

In the early days, felled logs were transported using simple methods such as rivers to float tree trunks downstream to sawmills or paper mills. This practice, known as log driving or timber rafting, was the cheapest and most common. Some logs, due to high resin content, would sink and were known as deadheads. Logs were also moved with high-wheel loaders, a set of wheels over ten feet tall, initially pulled by oxen.

=== 1880s to World War II: Railroad Logging Era ===

As the logging industry expanded, the 1880s saw the introduction of mechanized equipment like railroads and steam-powered machinery, marking the beginning of the railroad logging era. Logs were moved more efficiently by railroads built into remote forest areas, often supported by additional methods like high-wheel loaders, tractors and log flumes. The largest high-wheel loader, the &quot;Bunyan Buggie,&quot; was built in 1960 for service in California, featuring wheels high.

=== Post-World War II: Modern Mechanized Logging ===

After World War II, mechanized logging equipment, including chainsaws, diesel trucks, and Caterpillar tractors, transformed the logging industry, making railroad-based logging obsolete. With the advent of these tools, transporting logs became more efficient as new roads were constructed to access remote forests. However, in protected areas like United States National Forests and designated wilderness zones, road building has been restricted to minimize environmental impacts such as erosion in riparian zones.

Today, heavy machinery such as yarders and skyline systems are used to gather logs from steep terrain, while helicopters are used for heli-logging to minimize environmental impact. Less common forms of logging, like horse logging and the use of oxen, still exist but are mostly superseded.

==Safety considerations==
Logging is a dangerous occupation. In the United States, it has consistently been one of the most hazardous industries and was recognized by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues.

In 2008, the logging industry employed 86,000 workers and accounted for 93 deaths. This resulted in a fatality rate of 108.1 deaths per 100,000 workers that year. This rate is over 30 times higher than the overall fatality rate. Forestry/logging-related injuries (fatal and non-fatal) are often difficult to track through formal reporting mechanisms. Thus, some programs have begun to monitor injuries through publicly available reports such as news media. The logging industry experiences the highest fatality rate of 23.2 per 100,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers and a non-fatal incident rate of 8.5 per 100 FTE workers. The most common type of injuries or illnesses at work include musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), which include an extensive list of &quot;inflammatory and degenerative conditions affecting the muscles, tendons, ligaments, joints, peripheral nerves, and supporting blood vessels.&quot; Loggers work with heavy, moving weights, and use tools such as chainsaws and heavy equipment on uneven and sometimes steep or unstable terrain. Loggers also deal with severe environmental conditions, such as inclement weather and severe heat or cold. An injured logger is often far from professional emergency treatment.

Traditionally, the cry of &quot;Timber!&quot; developed as a warning alerting fellow workers in an area that a tree is being felled, so they should be alert to avoid being struck. The term &quot;widowmaker&quot; for timber, typically a limb or branch that is no longer attached to a tree, but is still in the canopy either wedged in a crotch, tangled in other limbs, or miraculously balanced on another limb demonstrates another emphasis on situational awareness as a safety principle.

In British Columbia, Canada, the BC Forest Safety Council was created in September 2004 as a not-for-profit society dedicated to promoting safety in the forest sector. It works with employers, workers, contractors, and government agencies to implement fundamental changes necessary to make it safer to earn a living in forestry.

The risks experienced in logging operations can be somewhat reduced, where conditions permit, by the use of mechanical tree harvesters, skidders, and forwarders.

<doc id="68115" wikidata="Q16520" url="?curid=68115" title="Busan">
<text>Busan (, ), officially Busan Metropolitan City, is South Korea&#x27;s second most populous city after Seoul, with a population of over 3.3 million as of 2024. Formerly romanized as Pusan, it is the economic, cultural and educational center of southeastern South Korea, with its port being South Korea&#x27;s busiest and the sixth-busiest in the world. The surrounding &quot;Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region&quot; (including Ulsan, South Gyeongsang, Daegu, and part of North Gyeongsang and South Jeolla) is South Korea&#x27;s largest industrial area. The large volumes of port traffic and urban population in excess of 1 million make Busan a Large-Port metropolis using the Southampton System of Port-City classification. As of 2019, Busan Port is the primary port in Korea and the world&#x27;s sixth-largest container port.

Busan is divided into 15 major administrative districts and a single county, together housing a population of approximately 3.6 million. The full metropolitan area, the Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region, has a population of approximately 8 million. The most densely built-up areas of the city are situated in a number of narrow valleys between the Nakdong and the Suyeong Rivers, with mountains separating most of the districts. The Nakdong River is Korea&#x27;s longest river and Busan&#x27;s Haeundae Beach is also the country&#x27;s largest.

Busan is a center for international conventions, hosting an APEC summit in 2005. It is also a center for sports tournaments in Korea, having hosted the 2002 Asian Games and FIFA World Cup. It is home to the world&#x27;s largest department store, the Shinsegae Centum City. Busan was added to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a &quot;City of Film&quot; in December 2014.

==Names==
The name &quot;Busan&quot; is the Revised Romanization of the city&#x27;s Korean name since the late 15th century. It officially replaced the earlier McCune–Reischauer romanization &quot;Pusan&quot; in 2000. During the Japanese colonial period, the Japanese reading of the city&#x27;s name was &quot;Fuzan&quot;.

The name (now written using the Korean alphabet) is Sino-Korean for &quot;Cauldron Mountain&quot;, believed to be a former name of MtHwangnyeong () west of the city center. The area&#x27;s ancient state MtGeochil (, &quot;Rough-Mountain Land&quot;) is similarly thought to refer to the same mountain, which towers over the town&#x27;s harbor on the Suyeong (the later Silla district of Geochilsan-gun was renamed Dongnae in 757).

==History==
The area that Busan now occupies was inhabited during the Neolithic period. Artifacts dating to this period discovered near the coast include stone tools, pottery, sea shells, and animal bones. Fishing was a primary food source for people of this period. Bronze Age artifacts have been uncovered further inland. By this period, agriculture was practiced.

Around the first century, a chiefdom called Koch&#x27;ilsan-guk () existed around what is now Dongnae District. At some point, it was absorbed by Silla and made an administrative division called Koch&#x27;ilsan-gun (). In 757, it was renamed Dongnae-gun (). In 835, the Buddhist temple Beomeosa was founded in the area.

In the Goryeo period (918–1392), the local became a prominent presence in Korean politics. By this point, Dongnae&#x27;s hot springs became famous, and have been attested to in writings of this period. By the end of the period, raids from &quot;wokou&quot; (Japanese pirates) intensified. One such invasion occurred in 1396. To defend against this, the fortress Dongnaeeupseong was established in the area.

In 1423, the port of Busan () and a &quot;waegwan&quot; (Japanese concession community) were established. During the reign of King Sejong the Great (r. 1418–1450), the population in Dongnae-hyeon was reportedly 2,416 people in 290 households. In Dongpyeong-hyeon, it was 627 people in 108 households. The &quot;waegwan&quot; was closed in 1510, but reopened in 1512.

During the 1592–1598 Japanese invasions of Korea, various fortresses in the area defended Busan against the invasion. Fortresses included Busanjinseong, , and Dongnaeeupseong. Civilians formed righteous armies (volunteer militias) and joined in the fight. After the siege and capture of Busanjin in 1592, most of Busanjin&#x27;s Korean prisoners and civilians were massacred. After the war, diplomatic relations with the new shogunate in Japan were established in 1607, and Busan was permitted to be reconstructed.

In 1605, the shrine Songgongsa was built to honor those who died defending Korea during the invasions. The shrine was dubbed Chungnyeolsa in 1624. In 1607, a &quot;waegwan&quot; was reestablished in Dumopo (); in 1678 it was moved to Choryang (; now around Yongdusan). In 1763, Busan became the first place in Korea to have sweet potatoes, which arrived from Tsushima Island in Japan. In 1759, the population was reportedly 25,753 people in 6,657 households.

In 1876, Busan became the first international port in Korea under the terms of the Treaty of Ganghwa. In 1877, a concession was established in Busan, and consulates of Japan, Qing, and the United Kingdom were established. In 1883, the port was opened, and a Busan Customs Office () was established. In 1895, Dongnae-bu was made part of South Gyeongsang Province. It was demoted to a &quot;gun&quot; in 1903, and made a &quot;bu&quot; again in 1906. After the beginning of the 1910–1945 Japanese colonial period, in 1914 it was made a &quot;gun&quot; again. In 1908, Busan was connected to the Gyeongbu Line via Busan station. In 1909, a ferry service was opened between Busan and Shimonoseki in Japan. In 1914, Dongnae-bu was reorganized into Busan-bu. In 1915, a tram was opened between Busanjin and the . The following year, the city tram opened.&quot;&quot;

During the Japanese rule, Busan developed into a hub trading port with Japan. Busan was the only city in Korea to adopt the steam tramway before electrification was introduced in 1924.

During the Korean War, Busan was one of only two cities in South Korea not captured by the North Korean army within the first three months of the war, the other being Daegu. As a result, the cities became refugee camp sites for Koreans during the war. According to &quot;The Korea Times&quot;, around 500,000 refugees were located in Busan in early 1951.

As Busan was one of the few areas in Korea that remained under the control of South Korea throughout the Korean War, for some time it served as a &quot;de facto&quot; capital of South Korea. UN troops established a defensive perimeter around the city known as the Pusan Perimeter in the summer and fall of 1950. Since then, the city has been a self-governing metropolis and has built a strong urban character.

In 1963, Busan separated from South Gyeongsang Province to become the first of South Korea. In 1983, the provincial capital of Gyeongsangnam-do was moved from Busan to Changwon.

==Geography==
Busan is located on the southeastern tip of the Korean Peninsula. It is located on the coast, which determined the development of the whole city itself. The distance from Busan to Seoul is about . Busan borders low mountains to the north and west, and the Korea Strait to the south and east. The Nakdong River Delta is located on the west side of the city, and Geumjeongsan, the highest mountain in the city, is on the north. The Nakdong River, South Korea&#x27;s longest river, flows through the west and empties into the Korea Strait. The southeastern region, called Yeongnam in Korea, encompasses both Gyeongsang Provinces and 3 metropolitan cities of Busan, Daegu and Ulsan. Ulsan lies northeast of Busan. The combined population exceeds 13 million.

The closest overseas area to Busan is Tsushima, Japan, with a distance of about . The closest Japanese mainland area to Busan is Fukuoka, and their is about 180km (112 miles). Busan and Fukuoka are also sister cities.

===Climate===

Located on the southeasternmost tip of the Korean Peninsula, Busan has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate, bordering on a subtropical monsoon climate influenced by East Asian monsoon (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;, bordering on &quot;Cwa&quot;). Extremely high or low temperatures are rare. The highest temperature ever recorded is on 14 August 2016 while the lowest temperature ever recorded is on 13 January 1915. May to July, late Springs and early Summers, are usually cooler than inland regions because of the ocean effect. Late Summer, and early Fall, August, and September, are generally hot and humid and the city may experience typhoons at that time and be generally rainy.

=== Traditional cuisine ===
Busan was once a center of military affairs in the southern region of the peninsula and therefore was an important site for diplomatic relationships with Japan; high-ranking officers and officials from the court frequently visited the city. Special foods were prepared for the officers such as &quot;Dongnae pajeon&quot; (), a variant of &quot;pajeon&quot; (Korean savory pancakes), made with whole scallions, sliced chili peppers, and various kinds of seafood in a thick batter of wheat flour, glutinous rice flour, eggs, salt and water.

During the Korean War, Busan was the biggest refugee destination on the peninsula; people from all regions of Korea went there. Some of these refugees stayed and adapted the recipes of their local specialties. One of these foods is &quot;milmyeon&quot; () (lit. &#x27;wheat noodle&#x27;) a version of &quot;naengmyeon&quot;, cold buckwheat noodle soup, but using wheat flour instead. (Naengmyeon is originally a specialty food of Hamhung and Pyongyang, now part of North Korea.) &quot;Dwaeji gukbap&quot; () (lit. &#x27;pork/pig soup rice&#x27;) is also a result of Korean War. It is a hearty pork soup and is becoming more popular nationwide. Pork trotters served with vegetables such as cucumbers, onions, and mustard sauce is popular and is called Nangchae-Jokbal.

=== Media ===
=== In popular culture ===

Although Seoul remains the de facto film and television capital of South Korea, Busan shares more in common with Cannes, France than just its reputation as seaside resort town.

The Busan International Film Festival is often referred to as the &quot;Cannes of Asia&quot;, attracting thousands of entertainment personalities from both Eastern and Western cinema every year, honoring and recognizing international luminaries such as Mike Leigh, Shōhei Imamura, Wong Kar-wai, and Kim Ki-duk.

It is frequently used as a film location, best known in the west for Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Black Panther&quot; and Apple&#x27;s &quot;Pachinko&quot;, but also for the Korean market productions of &quot;Train to Busan&quot;, &quot;Old Boy&quot;, and &quot;Decision to Leave&quot;, as well as the popular K-Drama &quot;Reply 1997&quot;, highlighting the distinct 
Gyeongsang dialect, which is comparable to a Scottish English in relation to standard British English.

Works set in Busan tend to be crime noirs. Additionally, Busan often appears as an escape location or disaster area. Stories where characters escape to Busan to flee accidents or disasters in Seoul and then escape overseas are quite common clichés in Korean disaster films. Train to Busan carries out an escape to Busan, as the title suggests.

Until the late 1990s, most dramas, movies, commercials, and music videos were filmed in the Seoul area, making filming outside Seoul quite rare. In the early 2000s, it was relatively easy to obtain permits for road closures and explosion scenes in Busan that would have been impossible in Seoul. Thanks to active support from the city, word of mouth started in the film industry, leading to a preference for filming in the Busan area. In particular, the film &quot;Haeundae&quot; was a box office success, achieving 10 million viewers.

== Demographics ==
Between 1945 and 1951, the city’s population grew from 280,000 to 840,000. It decreased from 3,513,777 in 2015 to 3,266,598 in 2024. This decline, which accelerated in the 1990s, is attributed to South Korea&#x27;s economic shift towards high-tech industries, concentrated around Seoul, and away from Busan&#x27;s traditional manufacturing base. 

=== Religion ===

In 2024, 29% followed Buddhism and 21% followed Christianity (14% Protestantism and 7% Catholicism), and 2% other religions. 48% of the population is irreligious.

==Sports==
The city planned to bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics, but withdrew after the 2018 Winter Olympics were awarded to Pyeongchang, also located in South Korea. The 2020 Summer Olympics were eventually awarded to Tokyo. It considered bidding to host the 2032 Summer Olympics.

<text>America America (British title The Anatolian Smile) is a 1963 American drama film directed, produced and written by Elia Kazan. It was inspired by the struggle of his uncle, Avraam Elia Kazantzoglou, to work his way to America, a land of dreams and opportunity. Kazan adapted the screenplay from his own 1962 book.

==Plot==
In the late 1890s, a young Cappadocian Greek, Stavros Topouzoglou, lives in an impoverished village below Mount Argaeus in Ottoman Turkey. The subjugated life of the Cappadocian Greeks and Armenians of Kayseri is depicted, including the Derinkuyu Underground City traditional cliff cave dwellings, where Stavros&#x27; grandmother lives.

Stavros and his Armenian friend Vartan plan to go to the faraway land of opportunity – America – together. Stavros witnesses a Hamidian massacre against the Armenians, which leaves Vartan dead, and Stavros is nearly imprisoned trying to recover Vartan&#x27;s mutilated corpse.

Knowing that the Greeks won&#x27;t remain safe from the violent pogroms forever, the family plans to send Stavros to Constantinople, the Ottoman capital, to eventually settle the family there. He is entrusted by his father, Issac, with the family&#x27;s entire fortune in money, jewels, rugs, whatever is greatest in value and transportable, including the family donkey.

Once successful, he is to send first for his sisters, then his brothers, and establish them safely and prosperously there as well. To do this he will invest in the carpet business of his father&#x27;s cousin Odysseus by buying his way in with his family&#x27;s meager accumulated wealth. Though this is his father&#x27;s dream, it is not Stavros&#x27; as he is still determined to go to America.

Stavros&#x27; odyssey begins with a long voyage on donkey and on foot through the impoverished towns and villages of the Anatolian countryside. Along the way, the naïve young dreamer is robbed of everything, kills the thief in retribution, and arrives at his cousin&#x27;s home penniless. The older man, who had deceived Stavros&#x27; father, is deeply disappointed, as he was counting on Issac&#x27;s wealth to rescue his failing carpet business. In an attempt to exploit a valuable opportunity Stavros still represents to him, Odysseus proposes that his handsome young cousin marry the plain and needy Thomna, daughter of a wealthy Greek carpet merchant, Aleko Sinnikoglou. Stavros realizes this would mean the end of his dream and adamantly refuses, abruptly leaving the angry cousin.

Now homeless on the streets, Stavros survives by eating discarded food and working at backbreaking and hazardous jobs. He is befriended by a streetwise older man, Garabet, who helps him toward his dream. After nine months of scrimping and self-denial, Stavros has saved nine Turkish pounds towards the 110 pound third class passage to New York, but he has every penny thieved by a prostitute in his first sexual encounter.

Clinging to Garabet, he ends up at a gathering of local anarchists planning a terrorist bombing. However, before they can disburse, they are slaughtered by police gunfire. Left for dead, Stavros ends up in a hospital, only to be thrown atop a wagon filled with dead bodies headed for disposal in the sea. He accidentally slides off and all but crawls back to his cousin&#x27;s.

Odysseus takes pity on the young man and allows him to recover at his home. Broken for the moment, Stavros agrees to marry his intended bride. Before the ceremony she questions his sullen silence, and he admits that he still plans to emigrate to America by using her dowry money to buy a ticket as soon as he can slip away after they are wed.

At this point Stavros becomes reacquainted with Hohannes, a young Armenian whom he had aided with food and clothing before his original voyage to Constantinople. Hohannes informs him that he is being sponsored to America by an employer seeking indentured labor, two years&#x27; worth in return for passage. By good fortune, Stavros begins an affair with Sophia, the sexually neglected, middle-aged wife of wealthy Armenian-American rug merchant Artoon Kebabian, a client of his prospective father-in-law. Using money from Sophia, Stavros buys a ticket to New York and leaves Thomna heartbroken, without a word. He ends up on the same ship as the Kebabians, he in steerage, they in first class.

On the other side of the Atlantic the ship lies just offshore of New York City waiting to clear quarantine. Sophia sends her servant to fetch Stavros, and the two have a tryst while Artoon sleeps. He awakes, discovers the affair, and taunts Stavros, who responds by physically attacking Kebabian. Stavros is arrested and sentenced by the ship&#x27;s captain to be returned to Turkey.

Hohannes, who is scarcely able to pass inspection by the visiting immigration doctor by hiding his advanced tuberculosis, realizes Stavros will die if he is sent back, and he will die anyway. Returning his friend&#x27;s generosity, he jumps off the ship to his death. Now short a man, the prospective American employer simply allows Stavros to assume Hohannes&#x27; identity and slip past immigration officials on Ellis Island, gifted a straw boater by Sophia and a new &#x27;American&#x27; name by the chief inspector, &quot;Joe Arness&quot;.

In return, even though he had paid his own passage, “Joe” will have to work off Hohannes&#x27; debt by shining shoes, earning only his tips.

A closing voiceover reveals that Joe was able to succeed in New York, and one by one brought every family member over – but his father, who, last in the line, died before his chance came.

==Production==
Inspired by the life of his uncle, Avraam Elia Kazantzoglou, Kazan used little-known cast members, with the entire story line revolving around the central performance of Greek actor Stathis Giallelis, twenty-one years old at the time of production, who is in virtually every scene of the nearly three-hour movie. Production began in 1962.
The production, hampered by loss of its original financial backers, on-location hostility from Turkish authorities and onlookers, as well as other problems, continued into 1963. Powerful elements within Turkey came to be convinced that the country&#x27;s national institutions and historical perspective upon turn of the 20th century events would be unfavorably portrayed by the Greek director and, when Kazan decided to transfer the troubled production to Greece, customs officials confiscated the cans of what they considered to be finished film, but owing to a prescient switch of labels between exposed and unexposed product, the valuable cargo survived.
The picture was filmed on location at the Alfa Studios in Athens, Greece, as well in rural Greece, Istanbul, New York City, and at the Warner Bros. Studios in Hollywood, in 1.66:1 aspect ratio on 35-millimeter stock. Kazan makes a voice-only introduction during the opening scenes, a short voice-only epilogue in the closing scene, followed by a recitation of the lead actors and technical personnel of the film. Tom Holland narrates the picture.

==Release==
The film had its New York premiere on December 15, 1963.

==Reception==
Between summer 1964 and spring 1965, it was seen in virtually every major Western European city. &quot;America America&quot; is one of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s favorite films.

==Preservation==
In 2001, &quot;America, America&quot; was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and recommended for preservation.

==Awards and nominations==
==VHS and DVD==
Its VHS release came on November 28, 1994, and a French (region 2) DVD boxed set (with Kazan&#x27;s &quot;Baby Doll&quot; and &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot;) was released on December 3, 2002. The film was released by Warner Bros. on DVD in the US on February 8, 2011.

<doc id="68121" wikidata="Q1148924" url="?curid=68121" title="Kolmogorov space">
<text>In topology and related branches of mathematics, a topological space &quot;X&quot; is a T0 space or Kolmogorov space (named after Andrey Kolmogorov) if for every pair of distinct points of &quot;X&quot;, at least one of them has a neighborhood not containing the other. In a T0 space, all points are topologically distinguishable.

This condition, called the T0 condition, is the weakest of the separation axioms. Nearly all topological spaces normally studied in mathematics are T0 spaces. In particular, all T1 spaces, i.e., all spaces in which for every pair of distinct points, each has a neighborhood not containing the other, are T0 spaces. This includes all T2 (or Hausdorff) spaces, i.e., all topological spaces in which distinct points have disjoint neighbourhoods. In another direction, every sober space (which may not be T1) is T0; this includes the underlying topological space of any scheme. Given any topological space one can construct a T0 space by identifying topologically indistinguishable points.

T0 spaces that are not T1 spaces are exactly those spaces for which the specialization preorder is a nontrivial partial order. Such spaces naturally occur in computer science, specifically in denotational semantics.

== Definition ==

A T0 space is a topological space in which every pair of distinct points is topologically distinguishable. That is, for any two different points &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; there is an open set that contains one of these points and not the other. More precisely the topological space &quot;X&quot; is Kolmogorov or formula_1 if and only if:

:If formula_2 and formula_3, there exists an open set &quot;O&quot; such that either formula_4 or formula_5.

Note that topologically distinguishable points are automatically distinct. On the other hand, if the singleton sets {&quot;x&quot;} and {&quot;y&quot;} are separated then the points &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; must be topologically distinguishable. That is,
:&quot;separated&quot; ⇒ &quot;topologically distinguishable&quot; ⇒ &quot;distinct&quot;
The property of being topologically distinguishable is, in general, stronger than being distinct but weaker than being separated. In a T0 space, the second arrow above also reverses; points are distinct if and only if they are distinguishable. This is how the T0 axiom fits in with the rest of the separation axioms.

==Examples and counter examples==

Nearly all topological spaces normally studied in mathematics are T0. In particular, all Hausdorff (T2) spaces, T1 spaces and sober spaces are T0.

===Spaces that are not T0===

*A set with more than one element, with the trivial topology. No points are distinguishable.
*The set R2 where the open sets are the Cartesian product of an open set in R and R itself, i.e., the product topology of R with the usual topology and R with the trivial topology; points (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) and (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;c&quot;) are not distinguishable.
*The space of all measurable functions &quot;f&quot; from the real line R to the complex plane C such that the Lebesgue integral formula_6. Two functions which are equal almost everywhere are indistinguishable. See also below.

===Spaces that are T0 but not T1===

*The Zariski topology on Spec(&quot;R&quot;), the prime spectrum of a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, is always T0 but generally not T1. The non-closed points correspond to prime ideals which are not maximal. They are important to the understanding of schemes.
*The particular point topology on any set with at least two elements is T0 but not T1 since the particular point is not closed (its closure is the whole space). An important special case is the Sierpiński space which is the particular point topology on the set {0,1}.
*The excluded point topology on any set with at least two elements is T0 but not T1. The only closed point is the excluded point.
*The Alexandrov topology on a partially ordered set is T0 but will not be T1 unless the order is discrete (agrees with equality). Every finite T0 space is of this type. This also includes the particular point and excluded point topologies as special cases.
*The right order topology on a totally ordered set is a related example.
*The overlapping interval topology is similar to the particular point topology since every non-empty open set includes 0.
*Quite generally, a topological space &quot;X&quot; will be T0 if and only if the specialization preorder on &quot;X&quot; is a partial order. However, &quot;X&quot; will be T1 if and only if the order is discrete (i.e. agrees with equality). So a space will be T0 but not T1 if and only if the specialization preorder on &quot;X&quot; is a non-discrete partial order.

==Operating with T0 spaces ==

Commonly studied topological spaces are all T0.
Indeed, when mathematicians in many fields, notably analysis, naturally run across non-T0 spaces, they usually replace them with T0 spaces, in a manner to be described below. To motivate the ideas involved, consider a well-known example. The space L2(R) is meant to be the space of all measurable functions &quot;f&quot; from the real line R to the complex plane C such that the Lebesgue integral of |&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)|2 over the entire real line is finite.
This space should become a normed vector space by defining the norm ||&quot;f&quot;|| to be the square root of that integral. The problem is that this is not really a norm, only a seminorm, because there are functions other than the zero function whose (semi)norms are zero.
The standard solution is to define L2(R) to be a set of equivalence classes of functions instead of a set of functions directly.
This constructs a quotient space of the original seminormed vector space, and this quotient is a normed vector space. It inherits several convenient properties from the seminormed space; see below.

In general, when dealing with a fixed topology T on a set &quot;X&quot;, it is helpful if that topology is T0. On the other hand, when &quot;X&quot; is fixed but T is allowed to vary within certain boundaries, to force T to be T0 may be inconvenient, since non-T0 topologies are often important special cases. Thus, it can be important to understand both T0 and non-T0 versions of the various conditions that can be placed on a topological space.

== The Kolmogorov quotient ==

Topological indistinguishability of points is an equivalence relation. No matter what topological space &quot;X&quot; might be to begin with, the quotient space under this equivalence relation is always T0. This quotient space is called the Kolmogorov quotient of &quot;X&quot;, which we will denote KQ(&quot;X&quot;). Of course, if &quot;X&quot; was T0 to begin with, then KQ(&quot;X&quot;) and &quot;X&quot; are naturally homeomorphic.
Categorically, Kolmogorov spaces are a reflective subcategory of topological spaces, and the Kolmogorov quotient is the reflector.

Topological spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are Kolmogorov equivalent when their Kolmogorov quotients are homeomorphic. Many properties of topological spaces are preserved by this equivalence; that is, if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are Kolmogorov equivalent, then &quot;X&quot; has such a property if and only if &quot;Y&quot; does.
On the other hand, most of the &quot;other&quot; properties of topological spaces &quot;imply&quot; T0-ness; that is, if &quot;X&quot; has such a property, then &quot;X&quot; must be T0.
Only a few properties, such as being an indiscrete space, are exceptions to this rule of thumb.
Even better, many structures defined on topological spaces can be transferred between &quot;X&quot; and KQ(&quot;X&quot;).
The result is that, if you have a non-T0 topological space with a certain structure or property, then you can usually form a T0 space with the same structures and properties by taking the Kolmogorov quotient.

The example of L2(R) displays these features.
From the point of view of topology, the seminormed vector space that we started with has a lot of extra structure; for example, it is a vector space, and it has a seminorm, and these define a pseudometric and a uniform structure that are compatible with the topology.
Also, there are several properties of these structures; for example, the seminorm satisfies the parallelogram identity and the uniform structure is complete. The space is not T0 since any two functions in L2(R) that are equal almost everywhere are indistinguishable with this topology.
When we form the Kolmogorov quotient, the actual L2(R), these structures and properties are preserved.
Thus, L2(R) is also a complete seminormed vector space satisfying the parallelogram identity.
But we actually get a bit more, since the space is now T0.
A seminorm is a norm if and only if the underlying topology is T0, so L2(R) is actually a complete normed vector space satisfying the parallelogram identity—otherwise known as a Hilbert space.
And it is a Hilbert space that mathematicians (and physicists, in quantum mechanics) generally want to study. Note that the notation L2(R) usually denotes the Kolmogorov quotient, the set of equivalence classes of square integrable functions that differ on sets of measure zero, rather than simply the vector space of square integrable functions that the notation suggests.

== Removing T0 ==

Although norms were historically defined first, people came up with the definition of seminorm as well, which is a sort of non-T0 version of a norm. In general, it is possible to define non-T0 versions of both properties and structures of topological spaces. First, consider a property of topological spaces, such as being Hausdorff. One can then define another property of topological spaces by defining the space &quot;X&quot; to satisfy the property if and only if the Kolmogorov quotient KQ(&quot;X&quot;) is Hausdorff. This is a sensible, albeit less famous, property; in this case, such a space &quot;X&quot; is called &quot;preregular&quot;. (There even turns out to be a more direct definition of preregularity). Now consider a structure that can be placed on topological spaces, such as a metric. We can define a new structure on topological spaces by letting an example of the structure on &quot;X&quot; be simply a metric on KQ(&quot;X&quot;). This is a sensible structure on &quot;X&quot;; it is a pseudometric. (Again, there is a more direct definition of pseudometric.)

In this way, there is a natural way to remove T0-ness from the requirements for a property or structure. It is generally easier to study spaces that are T0, but it may also be easier to allow structures that aren&#x27;t T0 to get a fuller picture. The T0 requirement can be added or removed arbitrarily using the concept of Kolmogorov quotient.

<text>American Graffiti is a 1973 American coming-of-age comedy-drama film directed by George Lucas, produced by Francis Ford Coppola, written by Willard Huyck, Gloria Katz and Lucas, and starring Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Paul Le Mat, Charles Martin Smith, Candy Clark, Mackenzie Phillips, Cindy Williams and Wolfman Jack. Harrison Ford and Bo Hopkins also appear. Set in Modesto, California, in 1962, the film is a study of the cruising and early rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll cultures popular among Lucas&#x27; age group at that time. Through a series of vignettes, it tells the story of a group of teenagers and their adventures throughout a single night.

While Lucas was working on his first film, &quot;THX 1138&quot;, Coppola asked him to write a coming-of-age film. The genesis of &quot;American Graffiti&quot; took place in Modesto in the early 1960s, during Lucas&#x27;s teenage years. He was unsuccessful in pitching the concept to financiers and distributors but found favor at Universal Pictures after every other major film studio turned him down. Filming began in San Rafael, California, but the production crew was denied permission to shoot beyond a second day. As a result, production was moved to Petaluma, California. The film is the first movie to be produced by his Lucasfilm production banner.

&quot;American Graffiti&quot; premiered on August 2, 1973, at the Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland, and was released on August 11, 1973, in the United States. The film received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Produced on a $777,000 budget (equivalent to about $ in dollars), it has become one of the most profitable films ever. Since its initial release, &quot;American Graffiti&quot; has earned an estimated return well over $200 million in box-office gross and home video sales, not including merchandising. In 1995, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==Plot==

On their last evening of summer vacation in 1962, high school graduates Curt Henderson and Steve Bolander meet their friends, confident drag-racing king John Milner and unpopular but well-meaning Terry &quot;The Toad&quot; Fields, at Mel&#x27;s Drive-In in Modesto, California. Set to travel &quot;Back East&quot; with Steve in the morning to start college, Curt has second thoughts about leaving. Laurie, Steve&#x27;s girlfriend and Curt&#x27;s sister, is hurt when Steve suggests they see other people while he is away to &quot;strengthen&quot; their relationship.

En route to the high school sock hop, Curt sees a beautiful blonde woman driving a white Ford Thunderbird who mouths &quot;I love you&quot;, leading him to desperately search for her throughout the night. Leaving the dance, he is coerced into joining a group of greasers called &quot;The Pharaohs&quot; in stealing coins from arcade machines and hooking a chain to a police car, ripping out its back axle. During a tense ride, the Pharaoh leader tells Curt that the blonde is a prostitute, which he does not believe.

Allowed to take care of Steve&#x27;s car while he is at college, Terry cruises around the strip and picks up the rebellious Debbie. Telling her he is known as &quot;Terry The Tiger&quot;, he spends the night trying to impress her, lying about the car and purchasing alcohol with no ID. The car is stolen while they share a romantic interlude, and later, after the alcohol has made Terry violently sick, he attempts to steal it back. The thieves beat him up until John intervenes, and Terry eventually admits the truth to Debbie and reveals he rides a Vespa scooter; she suggests it is &quot;almost a motorcycle&quot; and says she had fun, agreeing to meet up with him again.

Seeking cruising company, John inadvertently picks up Carol, a precocious 12-year-old who manipulates him into driving her around all night. He lies to suspicious friends that she is a cousin he is stuck babysitting, and they have a series of petty arguments until another car&#x27;s occupants harass her as she attempts to walk home alone, and John decides to protect her. Meanwhile, skilled racer Bob Falfa wants to compete for John&#x27;s drag-racing crown. During his night of challenging anyone he comes across, Bob picks up an emotional Laurie after a long-brewing argument with Steve.

Leaving the Pharaohs, Curt drives to the radio station to ask the omnipresent disc jockey &quot;Wolfman Jack&quot; to read a message on the air for the blonde. A station employee tells him the Wolfman does not work there and the shows are pre-taped, claiming the Wolfman &quot;is everywhere&quot;. He says the Wolfman would advise Curt to &quot;get your ass in gear&quot; and see the world, but promises to have the Wolfman air the request. As Curt leaves, he realizes the employee is the Wolfman, who reads the message to the blonde asking her to call Curt at the Mel&#x27;s Drive-In payphone.

After taking Carol home, John is successfully goaded by Bob into drag racing along Paradise Road outside the city with a crowd of spectators. Terry starts the race and John takes the lead, but Bob&#x27;s tire blows out, causing his car to swerve into a ditch and roll over before bursting into flames. Steve rushes to the wreck as Laurie and Bob crawl out before the car explodes. While John helps his rival to safety, Laurie begs Steve not to leave her, and he assures her that he will stay with her in Modesto.

An exhausted Curt is awakened by the payphone and finally speaks to the mysterious blonde, who hints at the possibility of meeting that night, but Curt replies that he is leaving town. In the morning at the airfield, he says goodbye to his parents and friends; after takeoff, he sees the white Thunderbird driving along the road below, and gazes thoughtfully into the sky.

A postscript reveals the friends&#x27; fates: In 1964, John was killed by a drunk driver; in 1965, Terry was reported missing in action near An Lộc, South Vietnam; Steve is an insurance agent in Modesto; and Curt is a writer living in Canada.

===Inspiration===
During the production of &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971), producer Francis Ford Coppola challenged co-writer/director George Lucas to write a script that would appeal to mainstream audiences. Lucas embraced the idea, using his early 1960s teenage experiences cruising in Modesto, California. &quot;Cruising was gone, and I felt compelled to document the whole experience and what my generation used as a way of meeting girls,&quot; Lucas explained. As he developed the story in his mind, Lucas included his fascination with Wolfman Jack. Lucas had considered doing a documentary about the Wolfman when he attended the USC School of Cinematic Arts, but he ultimately dropped the idea.

Adding in semiautobiographical connotations, Lucas set the story in his hometown of 1962 Modesto. The characters Curt Henderson, John Milner, and Terry &quot;The Toad&quot; Fields also represent different stages from his younger life. Curt is modeled after Lucas&#x27;s personality during USC, while John is based on Lucas&#x27;s teenaged street-racing and junior-college years, and hot rod enthusiasts he had known from the Kustom Kulture in Modesto. Terry represents Lucas&#x27;s nerd years as a freshman in high school, specifically his &quot;bad luck&quot; with dating. The filmmaker was also inspired by Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;I Vitelloni&quot; (1953).

After the financial failure of &quot;THX 1138&quot;, Lucas wanted the film to act as a release for a world-weary audience:

===United Artists===
After Warner Bros. abandoned Lucas&#x27;s early version of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (during the post-production of &quot;THX 1138&quot;), the filmmaker decided to continue developing &quot;Another Quiet Night in Modesto&quot;, eventually changing its title to &quot;American Graffiti&quot;. To co-write a 15-page film treatment, Lucas hired Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, who also added semiautobiographical material to the story. Lucas and his colleague Gary Kurtz began pitching the &quot;American Graffiti&quot; treatment to various Hollywood studios and production companies in an attempt to secure the financing needed to expand it into a screenplay, but they were unsuccessful. The potential financiers were concerned that music licensing costs would cause the film to go way over budget. Along with &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969), &quot;American Graffiti&quot; was one of the first films to eschew a traditional film score and successfully rely instead on synchronizing a series of popular hit songs with individual scenes.

&quot;THX 1138&quot; was released in March 1971, and Lucas was offered opportunities to direct &quot;Lady Ice&quot;, &quot;Tommy&quot;, or &quot;Hair&quot;. He turned down those offers, determined to pursue his own projects despite his urgent desire to find another film to direct. During this time, Lucas conceived the idea for a space opera (as yet untitled) which later became the basis for his &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. At the 1971 Cannes Film Festival, &quot;THX&quot; was chosen for the Directors&#x27; Fortnight competition. There, Lucas met David Picker, then president of United Artists, who was intrigued by &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and Lucas&#x27;s space opera. Picker decided to give Lucas $10,000 (equivalent to about $ in dollars) to develop &quot;Graffiti&quot; as a screenplay.

Lucas planned to spend another five weeks in Europe and hoped that Huyck and Katz would agree to finish the screenplay by the time he returned, but they were about to start on their own film, &quot;Messiah of Evil&quot;, so Lucas hired Richard Walter, a colleague from the USC School of Cinematic Arts for the job. Walter was flattered, but initially tried to sell Lucas on a different screenplay called &quot;Barry and the Persuasions&quot;, a story of East Coast teenagers in the late 1950s. Lucas held firm—his was a story about West Coast teenagers in the early 1960s. Walter was paid the $10,000, and he began to expand the Lucas/Huyck/Katz treatment into a screenplay.

Lucas was dismayed when he returned to America in June 1971 and read Walter&#x27;s script, which was written in the style and tone of an exploitation film, similar to 1967&#x27;s &quot;Hot Rods to Hell&quot;. &quot;It was overtly sexual and very fantasy-like, with playing chicken and things that kids didn&#x27;t really do,&quot; Lucas explained. &quot;I wanted something that was more like the way I grew up.&quot; Walter&#x27;s script also had Steve and Laurie going to Nevada to get married without their parents&#x27; permission. Walter rewrote the screenplay, but Lucas nevertheless fired him due to their creative differences.

After paying Walter, Lucas had exhausted his development fund from United Artists. He began writing a script, completing his first draft in just three weeks. Drawing upon his large collection of vintage records, Lucas wrote each scene with a particular song in mind as its musical backdrop. The cost of licensing the 75 songs Lucas wanted was one factor in United Artists&#x27; ultimate decision to reject the script; the studio also felt it was too experimental—&quot;a musical montage with no characters&quot;. United Artists also passed on &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which Lucas shelved for the time being.

===Universal Pictures===
Lucas spent the rest of 1971 and early 1972 trying to raise financing for the &quot;American Graffiti&quot; script. During this time, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and Columbia Pictures all turned down the opportunity to co-finance and distribute the film. Lucas, Huyck and Katz rewrote the second draft together, which, in addition to Modesto, was also set in Mill Valley and Los Angeles. Lucas also intended to end &quot;American Graffiti&quot; showing a title card detailing the fate of the characters, including the death of Milner and the disappearance of Toad in Vietnam. Huyck and Katz found the ending depressing and were incredulous that Lucas planned to include only the male characters. Lucas argued that mentioning the girls meant adding another title card, which he felt would prolong the ending. Because of this, Pauline Kael later accused Lucas of chauvinism.

Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz took the script to American International Pictures, who expressed interest, but ultimately believed &quot;American Graffiti&quot; was not violent or sexual enough for the studio&#x27;s standards. Lucas and Kurtz eventually found favor at Universal Pictures, who allowed Lucas total artistic control and the right of final cut privilege on the condition that he make &quot;American Graffiti&quot; on a strict low budget. This forced Lucas to drop the opening scene in which the Blonde Angel, Curt&#x27;s image of the perfect woman, drives through an empty drive-in cinema in her Ford Thunderbird, her transparency revealing she does not exist.

Universal initially projected a $600,000 budget but added an additional $175,000 once producer Francis Ford Coppola signed on. This would allow the studio to advertise &quot;American Graffiti&quot; as &quot;from the man who gave you &quot;The Godfather&quot;&quot;. The proposition also gave Universal first-look deals on Lucas&#x27;s next two planned projects, &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Radioland Murders&quot;. As he continued to work on the script, Lucas encountered difficulties on the Steve and Laurie storyline. Lucas, Katz, and Huyck worked on the third draft together, specifically on the scenes featuring Steve and Laurie.

Production proceeded with virtually no input or interference from Universal since &quot;American Graffiti&quot; was a low-budget film, and executive Ned Tanen had only modest expectations of its commercial success. However, Universal did object to the film&#x27;s title, not knowing what &quot;American Graffiti&quot; meant; Lucas was dismayed when some executives assumed he was making an Italian movie about feet. The studio, therefore, submitted a long list of over 60 alternative titles, with their favorite being &quot;Another Slow Night in Modesto&quot; and Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Rock Around the Block&quot;. They pushed hard to get Lucas to adopt any of the titles, but he was displeased with all the alternatives and persuaded Tanen to keep &quot;American Graffiti&quot;.

==Production==
===Casting===
The film&#x27;s lengthy casting process was overseen by Fred Roos, who worked with producer Francis Ford Coppola on &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Because &quot;American Graffiti&quot;&#x27;s main cast was for younger actors, the casting call and notices went through numerous high-school drama groups and community theaters in the San Francisco Bay Area. Among the actors was Mark Hamill, the future Luke Skywalker in Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy.

Over 100 unknown actors auditioned for Curt Henderson before Richard Dreyfuss was cast; George Lucas was impressed with Dreyfuss&#x27;s thoughtful analysis of the role, and as a result, offered the actor his choice of Curt or Terry &quot;The Toad&quot; Fields. Roos, a former casting director on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, suggested Ron Howard for Steve Bolander; Howard accepted the role to break out of the mold of his career as a child actor. Howard would later appear in the very similar role of Richie Cunningham on the &quot;Happy Days&quot; sitcom. Bob Balaban turned down Terry out of fear of becoming typecast, a decision he later regretted. Charles Martin Smith, who, in his first year as a professional actor, had already appeared in two feature films, including 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Culpepper Cattle Co.&quot; and four TV episodes, was eventually cast in the role.

Although Cindy Williams was cast as Laurie Henderson and enjoyed working with both Lucas and Howard, the actress hoped she would get the part of Debbie Dunham, which ended up going to Candy Clark. Mackenzie Phillips, who portrays Carol, was only 12, and under California law, producer Gary Kurtz had to become her legal guardian for the duration of filming. For Bob Falfa, Roos cast Harrison Ford, who was then concentrating on a carpentry career. Ford agreed to take the role on the condition that he would not have to cut his hair lest he be offered other movie or TV roles set in the &quot;present day&quot; of the 1970s. The character has a flattop in the script, but a compromise was eventually reached whereby Ford wore a Stetson to cover his hair. Producer Coppola encouraged Lucas to cast Wolfman Jack as himself in a cameo appearance. &quot;George Lucas and I went through thousands of Wolfman Jack phone calls that were taped with the public,&quot; Jack reflected. &quot;The telephone calls [heard on the broadcasts] in the motion picture and on the soundtrack were actual calls with real people.&quot;

===Filming===
Although &quot;American Graffiti&quot; is set in 1962 Modesto, Lucas believed the city had changed too much in ten years and initially chose San Rafael as the primary shooting location. Filming began on June 26, 1972. However, Lucas soon became frustrated at the length of time it was taking to fix camera mounts to the cars. A key member of the production had also been arrested for growing marijuana, and in addition to already running behind the shooting schedule, the San Rafael City Council immediately became concerned about the disruption that filming caused for local businesses, so withdrew permission to shoot beyond a second day.

Petaluma, a similarly small town about north of San Rafael, was more cooperative, and &quot;American Graffiti&quot; moved there without the loss of a single day of shooting. Lucas convinced the San Rafael City Council to allow two further nights of filming for general cruising shots, which he used to evoke as much of the intended location as possible in the finished film. Shooting in Petaluma began June 28 and proceeded at a quick pace. Lucas mimicked the filmmaking style of B-movie producer Sam Katzman (&quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot;, and the aforementioned &quot;Hot Rods to Hell&quot;) in attempting to save money and authenticated low-budget filming methods.

In addition to Petaluma, other locations included Mel&#x27;s Drive-In in San Francisco, Sonoma, Richmond, Novato, and the Buchanan Field Airport in Concord. The freshman hop dance was filmed in the Gus Gymnasium, previously known as the Boys Gym, at Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley.

More problems ensued during filming; Paul Le Mat was sent to the hospital after an allergic reaction to walnuts. Le Mat, Harrison Ford, and Bo Hopkins were claimed to be drunk most nights and every weekend, and had conducted climbing competitions to the top of the local Holiday Inn sign. One actor set fire to Lucas&#x27;s motel room. Another night, Le Mat threw Richard Dreyfuss into a swimming pool, gashing Dreyfuss&#x27;s forehead on the day before he was due to have his close-ups filmed. Dreyfuss also complained over the wardrobe that Lucas had chosen for the character. Ford was kicked out of his motel room at the Holiday Inn. In addition, two camera operators were nearly killed when filming the climactic race scene on Frates Road outside Petaluma. Principal photography ended August 4, 1972.

The final scenes in the film, shot at Buchanan Field, feature a Douglas DC-7C airliner of Magic Carpet Airlines, which had previously been leased from owner Club America Incorporated by the rock band Grand Funk Railroad from March 1971 to June 1971.

===Cinematography===
Lucas considered covering duties as the sole cinematographer, but dropped the idea. Instead, he elected to shoot &quot;American Graffiti&quot; using two cinematographers (as he had done in &quot;THX 1138&quot;) and no formal director of photography. Two cameras were used simultaneously in scenes involving conversations between actors in different cars, which resulted in significant production time savings. After CinemaScope proved to be too expensive, Lucas decided &quot;American Graffiti&quot; should have a documentary-like feel, so he shot the film using Techniscope cameras. He believed that Techniscope, an inexpensive way of shooting on 35 mm film and using only half of the film&#x27;s frame, would give a perfect widescreen format resembling 16 mm. Adding to the documentary feel was Lucas&#x27;s openness for the cast to improvise scenes. He also used goofs for the final cut, notably Charles Martin Smith&#x27;s arriving on his scooter to meet Steve outside Mel&#x27;s Drive-In. Jan D&#x27;Alquen and Ron Eveslage were hired as the cinematographers, but filming with Techniscope cameras brought lighting problems. As a result, Lucas commissioned help from friend Haskell Wexler, who was credited as the &quot;visual consultant&quot;.

Lucas had wanted his then wife, Marcia, to edit &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, but Universal executive Ned Tanen insisted on hiring Verna Fields, who had just finished editing Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot;. Fields worked on the first rough cut of the film before she left to resume work on &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot;. After Fields&#x27;s departure, Lucas struggled with editing the film&#x27;s story structure. He had originally written the script so that the four (Curt, Steve, John, and Toad) storylines were always presented in the same sequence (an &quot;ABCD&quot; plot structure). The first cut of &quot;American Graffiti&quot; was three and a half hours long, and to whittle the film down to a more manageable two hours, many scenes had to be cut, shortened, or combined. As a result, the film&#x27;s structure became increasingly loose and no longer adhered to Lucas&#x27;s original &quot;ABCD&quot; presentation. Lucas completed his final cut of &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, which ran 112 minutes, in December 1972. Walter Murch assisted Lucas in post-production for audio mixing and sound design purposes. Murch suggested making Wolfman Jack&#x27;s radio show the &quot;backbone&quot; of the film. &quot;The Wolfman was an ethereal presence in the lives of young people,&quot; said producer Gary Kurtz, &quot;and it was that quality we wanted and obtained in the picture.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

The choice of music was crucial to the mood of each scene; it is diegetic music that the characters themselves can hear and therefore becomes an integral part of the action. George Lucas had to be realistic about the complexities of copyright clearances, though, and suggested a number of alternative tracks. Universal wanted Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz to hire an orchestra for sound-alikes. The studio eventually proposed a flat deal that offered every music publisher the same amount of money. This was acceptable to most of the companies representing Lucas&#x27;s first choices, but not to RCA—with the consequence that Elvis Presley is conspicuously absent from the soundtrack. Clearing the music licensing rights had cost approximately $90,000, and as a result, no money was left for a traditional film score. &quot;I used the absence of music, and sound effects, to create the drama,&quot; Lucas later explained.

When it came to the ending credits, only the song&#x27;s title, artist, and the record label was listed. However, the names of the composers and lyricists, as well as the publishing company and the copyright year, were completely left out. This resulted in several of the songwriters filing lawsuits against MCA for leaving their names out of the credits. A settlement was reached in which MCA paid the damages to the songwriters, as well as to the publishing companies.

A soundtrack album for the film, &quot;41 Original Hits from the Soundtrack of American Graffiti&quot;, was issued by MCA Records. The album contains all the songs used in the film (with the exception of &quot;Gee&quot; by the Crows, which was subsequently included on a second soundtrack album), presented in the order in which they appeared in the film.

==Release==
Despite unanimous praise at a January 1973 test screening attended by Universal executive Ned Tanen, the studio told Lucas they wanted to re-edit his original cut of &quot;American Graffiti&quot;. Producer Coppola sided with Lucas against Tanen and Universal, offering to &quot;buy the film&quot; from the studio and reimburse it for the $775,000 (equivalent to $ in ) that it had cost to make it. 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures made similar offers to the studio. Universal refused these offers and told Lucas they planned to have William Hornbeck re-edit the film.

When Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Picture in March 1973, Universal relented and agreed to cut only three scenes (amounting to a few minutes) from Lucas&#x27;s cut. These include an encounter between Toad and a fast-talking car salesman, an argument between Steve and his former teacher Mr. Kroot at the sock hop, and an effort by Bob Falfa to serenade Laurie with &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;. The studio initially thought that the film was only fit for release as a television movie.

Various studio employees who had seen the film began talking it up, and its reputation grew through word of mouth. The studio dropped the TV movie idea and began arranging for a limited release in selected theaters in Los Angeles and New York. Universal presidents Sidney Sheinberg and Lew Wasserman heard about the praise the film had been garnering in LA and New York, and the marketing department amped up its promotion strategy for it, investing an additional $500,000 (equivalent to $ in ) in marketing and promotion. The film was released in the United States on August 11, 1973 to sleeper hit reception. The film had cost only $1.27 million (equivalent to $ in ) to produce and market, but yielded worldwide box office gross revenues of more than $55 million (equivalent to $ in ). It had only modest success outside the United States and Canada, but became a cult film in France.

Universal reissued &quot;Graffiti&quot; on May 26, 1978, with Dolby sound and earned an additional $63 million (equivalent to $ in ), which brought the total revenue for the two releases to $118 million (equivalent to $ in ). The reissue included stereophonic sound and a couple of minutes the studio had removed from Lucas&#x27;s original cut. All home video releases also included these scenes. Also, the date of John Milner&#x27;s death was changed from June 1964 to December 1964 to fit the narrative structure of the upcoming sequel, &quot;More American Graffiti&quot;. At the end of its theatrical run, &quot;American Graffiti&quot; had one of the greatest profit-to-cost ratios of a motion picture ever.

Producer Francis Ford Coppola regretted having not financed the film himself. Lucas recalled, &quot;He would have made $30 million (equivalent to $ in ) on the deal. He never got over it and he still kicks himself.&quot; It was the 13th-highest-grossing film of all time in 1977 and, adjusted for inflation, is currently the 43rd highest. By the 1990s, &quot;American Graffiti&quot; had earned more than $200 million (equivalent to $ in ) in box-office gross and home video sales. In December 1997, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that the film had earned an additional $55.13 million in rental revenue (equivalent to $ in ).

Universal Studios first released the film on DVD in September 1998, and once more as a double feature with &quot;More American Graffiti&quot; (1979) in January 2004. The 1978 version of the film was used, with an additional digital change to the sky in the opening title sequence. Additionally, the 1998 DVD and VHS releases were both THX certified as well. Universal released the film on Blu-ray with a new digitally remastered picture supervised by George Lucas on May 31, 2011. In celebration of its 50th anniversary, a 4K restoration of the film updated with a brand new 5.1 sound mix was re-released domestically on August 27 and 30 before a Ultra HD Blu-ray release on November 7, 2023.

==Reception==
&quot;American Graffiti&quot; received widespread critical acclaim. Roger Ebert gave the film a full four stars and praised it for being &quot;not only a great movie, but a brilliant work of historical fiction; no sociological treatise could duplicate the movie&#x27;s success in remembering exactly how it was to be alive at that cultural instant&quot;. Gene Siskel awarded three-and-a-half stars out of four, writing that although the film suffered from an &quot;overkill&quot; of nostalgia, particularly with regards to a soundtrack so overstuffed that it amounted to &quot;one of those golden-oldie TV blurbs,&quot; it was still &quot;well-made, does achieve moments of genuine emotion, and does provide a sock (hop) full of memories.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;American Graffiti&quot; is such a funny, accurate movie, so controlled and efficient in its narrative, that it stands to be overpraised to the point where seeing it will be an anticlimax.&quot; A.D. Murphy from &quot;Variety&quot; felt &quot;American Graffiti&quot; was a vivid &quot;recall of teenage attitudes and morals, told with outstanding empathy and compassion through an exceptionally talented cast of unknown actors&quot;. Charles Champlin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;masterfully executed and profoundly affecting movie.&quot; Jay Cocks of &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;American Graffiti&quot; &quot;reveals a new and welcome depth of feeling. Few films have shown quite so well the eagerness, the sadness, the ambitions and small defeats of a generation of young Americans.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was less enthused, writing that the film &quot;fails to be anything more than a warm, nice, draggy comedy, because there&#x27;s nothing to back up the style. The images aren&#x27;t as visually striking as they would be if only there were a mind behind them; the movie has no resonance except from the jukebox sound and the eerie, nocturnal jukebox look.&quot; She also noted with disdain that the epilogue did not bother to mention the fates of any of the women characters. Dave Kehr, writing in the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, called the film a brilliant work of popular art that redefined nostalgia as a marketable commodity, while establishing a new narrative style.

Based on reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, of the critics enjoyed the film with an average score of . The consensus reads: &quot;One of the most influential of all teen films, &quot;American Graffiti&quot; is a funny, nostalgic, and bittersweet look at a group of recent high school grads&#x27; last days of innocence.&quot; Metacritic calculated a score of 97 out of 100, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Themes===
&quot;American Graffiti&quot; depicts multiple characters going through a coming of age, such as the decisions to attend college or reside in a small town. The 1962 setting represents nearing an end of an era in American society and pop culture. The early 1960s musical backdrop also links between the early years of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll in the mid- to late 1950s (i.e., Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, Elvis Presley, and Buddy Holly), and mid-1960s, beginning with the January 1964 arrival of The Beatles and the following British Invasion, which Don McLean&#x27;s &quot;American Pie&quot; and the early 1970s revival of 1950s acts and oldies paralleled during the conception and filming.

The setting is two months before the Cuban Missile Crisis, and before the outbreak of the Vietnam War and the John F. Kennedy assassination and before the peak years of the counterculture movement. &quot;American Graffiti&quot; evokes mankind&#x27;s relationship with machines, notably the elaborate number of hot rods—having been called a &quot;classic-car flick&quot;, representative of the motor car&#x27;s importance to American culture at the time it was made. Another theme is teenagers&#x27; obsession with radio, especially with the inclusion of Wolfman Jack and his mysterious and mythological faceless (to most) voice.

===Accolades===

==Legacy==

Internet reviewer MaryAnn Johanson acknowledged that &quot;American Graffiti&quot; rekindled public and entertainment interest in the 1950s and early 1960s, and influenced other films such as &quot;The Lords of Flatbush&quot; (1974) and &quot;Cooley High&quot; (1975) and the TV series &quot;Happy Days&quot;. Alongside other films from the New Hollywood era, &quot;American Graffiti&quot; is often cited for helping give birth to the summer blockbuster. The film&#x27;s box-office success made George Lucas an instant millionaire. He gave an amount of the film&#x27;s profits to Haskell Wexler for his visual consulting help during filming, and to Wolfman Jack for &quot;inspiration&quot;. Lucas&#x27;s net worth was now $4 million, and he set aside a $300,000 independent fund for his long-cherished space opera project, which would eventually become the basis for &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977).

The financial success of &quot;Graffiti&quot; also gave Lucas opportunities to establish more elaborate development for Lucasfilm, Skywalker Sound, and Industrial Light &amp; Magic. Based on the success of the 1978 reissue, Universal began production for the sequel &quot;More American Graffiti&quot; (1979). Lucas and writers Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz later collaborated on &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; (1986) and &quot;Radioland Murders&quot; (1994). They were both released by Universal Pictures, for which Lucas acted as executive producer. &quot;Radioland Murders&quot; features characters intended to be Curt and Laurie Henderson&#x27;s parents, Roger and Penny Henderson. In 1995, &quot;American Graffiti&quot; was deemed culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 1997 the city of Modesto, California (where the film largely takes place), honored Lucas with a statue dedication of &quot;American Graffiti&quot; at George Lucas Plaza. Furthermore, the city has an annual classic car festival in honor of its graffiti culture heritage.

Director David Fincher credited &quot;American Graffiti&quot; as a visual influence for &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999). Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) features references to the film. The yellow airspeeder that Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi use to pursue bounty hunter Zam Wesell is based on John Milner&#x27;s yellow deuce coupe, while Dex&#x27;s Diner is reminiscent of Mel&#x27;s Drive-In. Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman conducted the &quot;rear axle&quot; experiment on the January 11, 2004, episode of &quot;MythBusters&quot;.

Given the popularity of the film&#x27;s cars with customizers and hot rodders in the years since its release, their fate immediately after the film is surprising. All were offered for sale in San Francisco newspaper ads; only the &#x27;58 Impala (driven by Ron Howard) attracted a buyer, selling for only a few hundred dollars. The yellow deuce coupe and the Pharaohs&#x27; red Mercury went unsold, despite the coupe being priced as low as $1500. The registration plate on Milner&#x27;s yellow deuce coupe is THX 138 on a yellow, California license plate, slightly altered, reflecting Lucas&#x27;s earlier science-fiction film (&quot;THX 1138&quot;).

<text>The Blood of Jesus (also known as The Glory Road) is a 1941 American independent fantasy drama race film written, directed by and starring Spencer Williams. The plot concerns a Baptist woman who, after being accidentally shot by her atheist husband, is sent to a crossroads, where Satan tries to lead her astray.

The film was very successful and, in 1991, was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In a small rural village with an African American population, a church group is holding a riverside baptismal service, and one of the faithful being immersed is the recently married Martha (Cathryn Caviness). However, Martha&#x27;s husband Ras (Spencer Williams) is absent from the service – he claims he was hunting, but he actually poached a neighbor&#x27;s boar. At home, Ras accidentally shoots Martha when his rifle drops on the floor and discharges. The church congregation gathers at Martha&#x27;s bedside to pray for her recovery, and during this period an angel (Rogenia Goldthwaite) arrives to take Martha&#x27;s spirit from her body. She is brought to the Crossroads between Heaven and Hell, and initially she is tempted by the slick Judas Green (Frank H. McClennan), who is an agent for Satan (James B. Jones). Judas takes Martha to a nightclub, where the floor show includes an acrobat and a jazz singer. Judas arranges to have Martha employed by the roadhouse owner Rufus Brown, but the angel returns and advises Martha to flee. As she is escaping, a nightclub patron mistakenly believes Martha is a pickpocket who robbed him. A chase ensues and Martha races back to the Crossroads between Hell and Zion, where Satan (along with a jazz band on a flatbed truck) is waiting for her arrival. The voice of Jesus Christ challenges the mob who go away. The sign at the Crossroad is transformed into the vision of Jesus Christ being crucified, and Christ&#x27;s blood drips down on Martha&#x27;s face. She awakens to discover she is home and her health is restored. Martha is reunited with her husband, who has now embraced religion. The angel who took Martha on her journey returns to bless the marriage.

==Production==
&quot;The Blood of Jesus&quot; was the second film directed by Spencer Williams, who was one of the few African American directors active in the 1940s. &quot;The Blood of Jesus&quot; was produced in Texas on a budget of US$5,000. To present the afterlife, Williams used scenes from a 1911 Italian film called &quot;L&#x27;Inferno&quot; that depicted souls entering Heaven and in addition to Williams, the cast was made up of amateur actors and members of Reverend R. L. Robinson&#x27;s Heavenly Choir, who sang the film&#x27;s gospel music score.

==Release, reception and legacy==
&quot;The Blood of Jesus&quot; was screened in cinemas and in black churches. The film&#x27;s commercial success enabled Williams to direct and write additional feature films for Sack Amusement Enterprises, including two films with religious themes: &quot;Brother Martin: Servant of Jesus&quot; (1942) and &quot;Go Down Death&quot; (1944).

For years, &quot;The Blood of Jesus&quot; was considered a lost film until prints were discovered in the mid-1980s in a warehouse in Tyler, Texas.

Critical appraisal of &quot;The Blood of Jesus&quot; has been positive, with Dave Kehr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling the film “magnificent” and J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; stating it is “a masterpiece of folk cinema that has scarcely lost its power to astonish.” &quot;Time&quot; magazine counted it among its “25 Most Important Films on Race.” Historian Thomas Cripps, in his book &quot;Black Film as Genre&quot;, praised &quot;The Blood of Jesus&quot; for providing “a brief anatomy of Southern Baptist folk theology by presenting Christian myth in literal terms. From its opening voiceover, the film became an advocate for the most enduring traditions of Afro-American family life on Southern ground.”

Filmmaker Julie Dash cited the baptismal sequence in &quot;The Blood of Jesus&quot; as the inspiration for a similar scene from her 1991 feature film &quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot;. In 1991, &quot;The Blood of Jesus&quot; became the first race film to be added to the U.S. National Film Registry.

It was also featured on Thom Andersen&#x27;s 2015 film essay &quot;&quot;.

<text>Badlands is a 1973 American neo-noir period crime drama film written, produced and directed by Terrence Malick, in his directorial debut. The film stars Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek, and follows Holly Sargis (Spacek), a 15-year old who goes on a killing spree with her partner, Kit Carruthers (Sheen). The film also stars Warren Oates and Ramon Bieri. While the story is fictional, it is loosely based on the real-life murder spree of Charles Starkweather and his girlfriend, Caril Ann Fugate, in 1958.

&quot;Badlands&quot; was released in 1973 to positive reviews from critics, who particularly praised its cinematography, soundtrack—which includes pieces by Carl Orff—and the lead performances. At the 28th British Academy Film Awards, Spacek was nominated for the Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles award, and at the San Sebastián International Film Festival, Sheen won the Best Actor award.

In 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1959, Holly Sargis narrates the film as a 15-year-old living in Fort Dupree, a dead-end South Dakota town. She has a strained relationship with her father, a sign painter, since her mother&#x27;s death from pneumonia years earlier. Holly meets Kit Carruthers, a 25-year-old garbage collector, troubled greaser and Korean War veteran. He resembles James Dean, an actor whom Holly admires. After Kit charms Holly, he takes her virginity. As they become closer, his violent and antisocial tendencies are gradually revealed.

Holly&#x27;s father disapproves of Kit and kills her dog as punishment for seeing him. Kit breaks into Holly&#x27;s house and insists she run away with him. When her father threatens to call the police, Kit fatally shoots him. After Kit and Holly fake suicide by burning the house, they head for the badlands of Montana. They build a tree house in a remote area and fish and steal chickens for food. They flee when found by three men (who Kit later tells Holly were bounty hunters) whom Kit shoots dead. They seek refuge with Kit&#x27;s former co-worker, Cato, but when he attempts to summon help, Kit shoots him, too. A young couple arrive and are forced into the storm cellar. Kit shoots into the closed cellar door and leaves without knowing if they are dead.

Law enforcement pursue Kit and Holly across the Northern Plains. They stop at a rich man&#x27;s mansion and take supplies, clothing, and his Cadillac, sparing the man and his deaf housemaid. As they drive across Montana to Saskatchewan, the police find and chase them.

Holly, who has grown tired of Kit and life on the run, refuses to go with him and turns herself in. Kit leads the police on a car chase, but is soon caught. He charms the arresting officers and National Guard troops, tossing them his personal belongings as souvenirs of his crime spree. Holly reveals at the end that she received probation and married her defense attorney&#x27;s son. Kit was executed for his crimes.

==Cast==

Director Terrence Malick makes a cameo as the man at the rich man&#x27;s door, while Sheen&#x27;s sonsCharlie Sheen and Emilio Estevezappear briefly as two boys sitting under a lamppost outside Holly&#x27;s house.

==Production==

=== Writing and casting ===

Malick, a protégé of Arthur Penn (whom he thanked in the film&#x27;s end credits), began work on &quot;Badlands&quot; after his second year attending the American Film Institute. In 1970, Malick, at age 27, began working on the screenplay during a road trip. &quot;I wrote and, at the same time, developed a kind of sales kit with slides and video tape of actors, all with a view to presenting investors with something that would look ready to shoot,&quot; Malick said. &quot;To my surprise, they didn&#x27;t pay too much attention to it; they invested on faith. I raised about half the money and executive producer Edward Pressman the other half.&quot; Malick paid $25,000 of his own funds. The remainder of his share was raised from professionals such as doctors and dentists. &quot;Badlands&quot; was the first feature film that Malick had written for himself to direct.

Sissy Spacek, in only her second film, was the first actor cast. Malick found her small-town Texas roots and accent were perfect for the part of the naive impressionable high school girl. The director included her in his creative process, asking questions about her life &quot;as if he were mining for gold.&quot; When he found out she had been a majorette, he worked a twirling routine into the script. Several up-and-coming actors were auditioned for the part of Kit Carruthers. When Martin Sheen was suggested by the casting director, Malick was hesitant, thinking he was too old for the role. Spacek wrote in her autobiography that &quot;the chemistry was immediate. He &quot;was&quot; Kit. And with him, I was Holly.&quot; Sheen based his characterization of Kit on the actor James Dean.

=== Filming and set design ===
Principal photography took place in Colorado starting in July 1972, with a non-union crew and a low budget of $300,000 (excluding some deferments to film labs and actors). The film had a somewhat troubled production history: several members of the crew clashed with Malick, and another was severely injured when an explosion occurred while filming the fire scene. Malick&#x27;s first cinematographer, Brian Probyn, quit mid-shoot after balking at the director&#x27;s unorthodox methods. He was replaced by Tak Fujimoto then by Stevan Larner who finished the film. &quot;Amazingly, despite the input of these different hands, the film looks remarkably seamless,&quot; said producer Edward R. Pressman.

The Frank G. Bloom House in Trinidad was used for the rich man&#x27;s house. Malick himself had an uncredited cameo after the actor hired to play &#x27;Caller at Rich Man&#x27;s House&#x27; failed to show up. The script&#x27;s beginning was mostly filmed in the southeastern Colorado towns of La Junta and Las Animas, including the scene in which Holly runs out of the latter town&#x27;s Columbian Elementary School. The closing credits thank the people of Otero County, Colorado, &quot;for their help and cooperation.&quot;

Jack Fisk served as art director for the film in his first of several collaborations with the director. During production, Sissy Spacek and Fisk fell in love and were married on April 12, 1974. The film was originally set to be edited by Robert Estrin. When Malick saw Estrin&#x27;s cut of the film, he disliked it and removed him from the production. Malick and Billy Weber recut the movie. Estrin remains credited as the sole editor, however, with Weber credited as associate editor. Both Weber and art designer Jack Fisk worked on all of Malick&#x27;s subsequent features through 2016 (&quot;The Tree of Life&quot;, &quot;To the Wonder&quot;, &quot;Knight of Cups&quot;).

Though Malick paid close attention to period detail, he did not want it to overwhelm the picture. &quot;I tried to keep the 1950s to a bare minimum,&quot; he said. &quot;Nostalgia is a powerful feeling; it can drown out anything. I wanted the picture to set up like a fairy tale, outside time.&quot; At a news conference coinciding with the film&#x27;s festival debut, Malick called Kit &quot;so desensitized that [he] can regard the gun with which he shoots people as a kind of magic wand that eliminates small nuisances.&quot; Malick also pointed out that &quot;Kit and Holly even think of themselves as &quot;living&quot; in a fairy tale&quot;, and he felt this was appropriate since &quot;children&#x27;s books like &quot;Treasure Island&quot; were often filled with violence.&quot; He also hoped a fairy tale tone would &quot;take a little of the sharpness out of the violence but still keep its dreamy quality.&quot;

=== Soundtrack ===
The film makes repeated use of the short composition Gassenhauer from Carl Orff&#x27;s and Gunild Keetman&#x27;s &quot;Schulwerk&quot;, and also uses other tunes by Erik Satie, Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, Mickey &amp; Sylvia and James Taylor.

==Release==
Warner Bros. purchased and distributed the film for just under $1 million. Warner Bros. initially previewed the film on a double bill with the Mel Brooks comedy &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, resulting in very negative audience response. The production team was forced to book the film into several other theaters, in locations such as Little Rock, Arkansas, to demonstrate that the film could make money. The film has a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an average score of 8.9/10 based on the reviews of 59 critics, with the general consensus being &quot;Terrence Malick&#x27;s debut is a masterful slice of American cinema, rife with the visual poetry and measured performances that would characterize his work.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted score of 93 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Variety stated that the film was an &quot;impressive&quot; debut. Roger Ebert added it to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list in 2011.

&quot;Badlands&quot; was the closing feature film at the 1973 New York Film Festival, reportedly &quot;overshadowing even Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Mean Streets&quot;.&quot; Vincent Canby, who saw the film at the festival debut, called it a &quot;cool, sometimes brilliant, always ferociously American film&quot;; according to Canby, &quot;Sheen and Miss Spacek are splendid as the self-absorbed, cruel, possibly psychotic children of our time, as are the members of the supporting cast, including Warren Oates as Holly&#x27;s father. One may legitimately debate the validity of Malick&#x27;s vision, but not, I think, his immense talent. Badlands is a most important and exciting film.&quot;

In April 1974, Jay Cocks wrote that the film &quot;might better be regarded less as a companion piece to &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; than as an elaboration and reply. It is not loose and high-spirited. All its comedy has a frosty irony, and its violence, instead of being brutally balletic, is executed with a dry, remorseless drive.&quot; According to executive producer Edward Pressman, apart from Canby&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; review, most initial reviews of the film were negative, but its reputation with critics improved over time. David Thomson conversely reported that the work was &quot;by common consent [...] one of the most remarkable first feature films made in America.&quot; Writing years later for &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot;, Dave Kehr wrote: &quot;Malick&#x27;s 1973 first feature is a film so rich in ideas it hardly knows where to turn. Transcendent themes of love and death are fused with a pop-culture sensibility and played out against a midwestern background, which is breathtaking both in its sweep and in its banality.&quot;

Spacek later said that &quot;Badlands&quot; changed the whole way she thought about filmmaking. &quot;After working with Terry Malick, I was like, &#x27;The artist rules. Nothing else matters.&#x27; My career would have been very different if I hadn&#x27;t had that experience&quot;. In 2003, Bill Paxton said: &quot;It had a lyricism that films have only once in a while, moments of a transcendental nature... There&#x27;s this wonderful sequence where the couple have been cut adrift from civilisation. They know the noose is tightening and they&#x27;ve gone off the road, across the Badlands. You hear Sissy narrating various stories, and she&#x27;s talking about visiting faraway places. There&#x27;s this strange piece of classical music [an ethereal orchestration of Erik Satie&#x27;s &quot;Trois Morceaux en forme de Poire],&quot; and a very long-lens shot. You see something in the distance – I think it&#x27;s a train moving – and it looks like a shot of an Arabian caravan moving across the desert. These are moments that have nothing to do with the story, and yet everything to do with it. They&#x27;re not plot-orientated, but they have to do with the longing or the dreams of these characters. And they&#x27;re the kind of moments you never forget, a certain kind of lyricism that just strikes some deep part of you and that you hold on to.&quot;

Martin Sheen commented in 1999 that &quot;Badlands&quot; &quot;still is&quot; the best script he had ever read. He wrote that &quot;It was mesmerising. It disarmed you. It was a period piece, and yet of all time. It was extremely American, it caught the spirit of the people, of the culture, in a way that was immediately identifiable.&quot;

<text>Ramón Gerard Antonio Estévez (born August 3, 1940), known professionally as Martin Sheen, is an American actor. In a career spanning six decades he has received numerous accolades including three Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and four Screen Actors Guild Awards.

Sheen rose to prominence in his breakthrough roles in Terrence Malick&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Badlands&quot; (1973) and Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s Vietnam War drama &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979). Sheen is also known for such notable films as &quot;The Subject Was Roses&quot; (1968), &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1970), &quot;The California Kid&quot; (1974), &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), &quot;Wall Street&quot; (1987), &quot;Gettysburg&quot; (1993), &quot;The American President&quot; (1995), &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (2002), &quot;The Departed&quot;, &quot;Bobby&quot; (both 2006), and &quot;Judas and the Black Messiah&quot; (2021). He also portrayed Uncle Ben in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (2012).

He is also known for portraying Robert F. Kennedy in &quot;The Missiles of October&quot; (1974), Eddie Slovik in &quot;The Execution of Private Slovik&quot; (1974), John Dean in &quot;Blind Ambition&quot; (1979), and John F. Kennedy in &quot;Kennedy&quot; (1983). He received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his role in &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; (1994). He played President Jed Bartlet in &quot;The West Wing&quot;, for which he received six nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series tying the record for most nominations without a win in the category. He played Robert Hanson in the Netflix series &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot; (2015–2022).

Born and raised in the United States by a Galician father and an Irish mother, he adopted the stage name Martin Sheen to help him gain acting parts. He is the father of four children, all of whom are actors. Sheen has directed one film, &quot;Cadence&quot; (1990), in which he appears alongside his sons Charlie and Ramón. He has narrated, produced, and directed documentary projects and has been active in liberal politics.

==Early life and education ==
Sheen was born in Dayton, Ohio, on August 3, 1940, to Mary-Ann (née Phelan) and Francisco Estévez Martínez. During birth, Sheen&#x27;s left arm was crushed by forceps, giving him limited lateral movement of that arm (Erb&#x27;s palsy) and resulting in the arm being shorter than his right. Both of Sheen&#x27;s parents were immigrants; his mother was Irish, from Borrisokane, County Tipperary, and his father, who was Spanish, was born in Salceda de Caselas, Galicia. After moving to Dayton in the 1930s, his father was a factory worker/machinery inspector at the National Cash Register Company. Sheen&#x27;s maternal uncle, Michael Phelan, fought in the Irish Civil War as a volunteer in the Anti-Treaty Irish Republican Army, and was imprisoned in Kilmainham Gaol, Dublin. Sheen grew up on Brown Street in the South Park neighborhood, the seventh of ten children (nine boys and a girl). Due to his father&#x27;s work, the family lived on the island of Bermuda on St. John&#x27;s Road, Pembroke Parish, where five of his brothers were born. Martin was the first child to be born in Dayton, Ohio, after the family returned from Bermuda. Sheen contracted polio as a child and had to remain bedridden for a year. His doctor&#x27;s treatment using Sister Kenny&#x27;s method helped him regain use of his legs.

When he was eleven years old, Sheen&#x27;s mother died, and the children faced the possibility of living in an orphanage or foster homes. The family was able to remain together with the assistance of the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Dayton. Raised as a Catholic, he graduated from Chaminade High School (now Chaminade Julienne Catholic High School). At fourteen years old he organized a strike of golf caddies while working at a private golf club in Dayton, Ohio. He complained about the golfers, saying: &quot;They often used obscene language in front of us... we were little boys and they were abusive... anti-Semitic... And they, for the most part, were upstanding members of the community.&quot;

Sheen was drawn to acting at a young age, but his father disapproved of his interest in the field. Despite his father&#x27;s opposition, Sheen borrowed money from a Catholic priest and moved to New York City in his early twenties, hoping to make it as an actor. He spent two years in the Living Theatre company. It was in New York that he met Catholic activist Dorothy Day. Working with her Catholic Worker Movement, he began his commitment to social justice, and would one day go on to play Peter Maurin, cofounder of the Catholic Worker Movement, in &quot;Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story&quot;. Sheen deliberately failed the entrance examination for the University of Dayton so that he could pursue his acting career.

He adopted his stage name, Martin Sheen, from a combination of the CBS casting director, Robert Dale Martin, who gave him his first big break, and Catholic archbishop and broadcaster, Fulton J. Sheen. In a 2003 &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; interview, Sheen explained, Whenever I would call for an appointment, whether it was a job or an apartment, and I would give my name, there was always that hesitation and when I&#x27;d get there, it was always gone. So I thought, I got enough problems trying to get an acting job, so I invented Martin Sheen. It&#x27;s still Estevez officially. I never changed it officially. I never will. It&#x27;s on my driver&#x27;s license and passport and everything. I started using Sheen, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and before I knew it, I started making a living with it and then it was too late. In fact, one of my great regrets is that I didn&#x27;t keep my name as it was given to me. I knew it bothered my dad.

==Career==

=== 1963–1979: Rise to prominence ===

Sheen was greatly influenced by the actor James Dean. Speaking of the impact Dean had on him, Sheen stated, &quot;All of his movies had a profound effect on my life, in my work and all of my generation. He transcended cinema acting. It was no longer acting, it was human behavior.&quot; Sheen developed a theatre company with other actors in hopes that a production would earn him recognition. In 1963, he made an appearance in &quot;Nightmare&quot;, an episode of the television science fiction series &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. In 1964, he co-starred in the Broadway play &quot;The Subject Was Roses&quot;; he later reprised his role in the 1968 film of the same name, and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sheen also starred in the television production &quot;Ten Blocks on the Camino Real&quot; (1966), an adaptation of Tennessee Williams&#x27; play &quot;Camino Real&quot; directed by Jack Landau and presented by NET, a PBS predecessor. In 1968, he played the titular role in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, directed by Joseph Papp at The Public Theater, with dialogue mostly in English and some in Spanish as Hamlet&#x27;s alter ego.

During the 1960s and early 1970s Sheen appeared as a guest star in many popular television series, including &quot;Insight&quot; (1960s–1980s), &quot;My Three Sons&quot; (1964), &quot;Flipper&quot; (1967), &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; (1968), &quot;&quot; (1969), &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; (1970), &quot;Dan August&quot; (1971), &quot;The Rookies&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot;, and &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot; (all 1973). He also had a recurring role as Danny Morgan in &quot;Mod Squad&quot; (1970–1971). By the early 1970s Sheen was increasingly focusing on television films and motion pictures. He portrayed Dobbs in the 1970 film adaptation of &quot;Catch-22&quot;. He then co-starred in the controversial Emmy Award-winning 1972 television film &quot;That Certain Summer&quot;, said to be the first television movie in America to portray homosexuality in a sympathetic light.

His next important feature film role was in 1973 when he starred with Sissy Spacek in the crime drama &quot;Badlands&quot;, playing an antisocial multiple murderer. Sheen has stated that his role in &quot;Badlands&quot; was one of his two favorites, the other being his role as a U.S. Army special operations officer in &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. Also in 1973, Sheen appeared opposite David Janssen in &quot;Such Dust As Dreams Are Made On&quot;, the first pilot for the television series &quot;Harry O&quot;. In 1974, Sheen portrayed a hot rod driver in the television film &quot;The California Kid&quot; and that same year received an Emmy Award nomination for Best Actor in a television drama for his portrayal of Pvt. Eddie Slovik in the television film &quot;The Execution of Private Slovik&quot;. Based on an incident that occurred during World War II, the film told the story of the only U.S. soldier to be executed for desertion since the American Civil War.

Sheen&#x27;s performance led to Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s casting him in a lead role as U.S. Army Captain Benjamin L. Willard in 1979&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, gaining him wide recognition. Filming in the Philippine jungle in the typhoon season of 1976, Sheen later said that he was not in good physical condition and was drinking heavily. For the film&#x27;s opening sequence in a Saigon hotel room, Sheen&#x27;s portrayal of Willard as heavily intoxicated was aided by Sheen&#x27;s celebrating his 36th birthday on-set that day, and being actually drunk. Twelve months into filming, Sheen suffered a minor heart attack and had to crawl out to a road for help. While he was recovering, his younger brother Joe Estevez stood in for him in a number of long shots and in some of the voice-overs. Sheen was able to resume filming a few weeks later.
In 1976, he participated in &quot;The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane&quot; as Frank Hallet, the antagonist with bad intentions towards teenager protagonist Rynn Jacobs (Jodie Foster). Frank was the son of landlady Cora Hallet (Alexis Smith). In 1979, Sheen acted in &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; with Kirk Douglas, another actor with family connections to Bermuda (Diana Dill, Douglas&#x27;s first wife and the mother of their sons Michael Douglas and Joel Douglas was a Bermudian).

=== 1980–1998: Established actor ===

In the early 1980s he had roles in the science fiction war film &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; (1980), the biographical epic &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), the sports drama &quot;That Championship Season&quot; (1982), and the drama film &quot;Wall Street&quot; (1987) starring Michael Douglas, and his son Charlie Sheen. He played Captain Hollister in &quot;Firestarter&quot; (1984) opposite Drew Barrymore and David Keith.

Sheen portrayed U.S. President John F. Kennedy in the miniseries &quot;Kennedy&quot; (1983) for which he received nominations for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film. He also portrayed Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy in the television special &quot;The Missiles of October&quot; (1974), White House Chief of Staff A.J. McInnerney in &quot;The American President&quot; (1995), White House Counsel John Dean in the television mini-series &quot;Blind Ambition&quot; (1979) for which he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama. In 1991 he narrated the Oliver Stone biographical film &quot;JFK&quot; (1991).

Other roles include the sinister would-be president Greg Stillson in &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, the President in the Lori Loughlin-Chris Noth television mini-series, &quot;Medusa&#x27;s Child&quot;, the president in the short film &quot;Family Attraction&quot;. In 1993, Sheen&#x27;s sympathetic portrayal of General Robert E. Lee in the Ronald Maxwell film &quot;Gettysburg&quot; (1993) met with acclaim.
Sheen has performed voice-over work as the narrator for the &quot;Eyewitness&quot; series in the US for the first and second seasons and as the &quot;real&quot; Seymour Skinner in the controversial &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot;.

=== 1999–2006: &quot;The West Wing&quot; ===
Sheen played fictional Democratic president Josiah &quot;Jed&quot; Bartlet in the NBC television drama, &quot;The West Wing&quot;. For his performance he earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama in 2000 and was nominated six times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.

During this time he played Roger Strong in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s crime film &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (2002), Captain Oliver Queenan in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s crime film &quot;The Departed&quot; (2006), and Jack Stevens in the biographical film &quot;Bobby&quot; (2006). He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his role in &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; in 2005. He also appeared in the sitcom &quot;Spin City&quot; in 2002 and in &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot; (2007).

=== 2007–present ===
Sheen played the role of the Illusive Man in the video game &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot;, and the sequel, &quot;Mass Effect 3&quot;. In addition, he voiced the role of Emilio in the English language version of the 2011 animated film &quot;Arrugas &quot;(Wrinkles).

In 2009, Sheen travelled to Mexico City to star in &quot;Chamaco&quot; with Kirk Harris, Alex Perea, Gustavo Sánchez Parra and Michael Madsen. Sheen appeared in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Departed&quot; as Captain Oliver Queenan, a commanding officer who is watching an undercover cop (Leonardo DiCaprio). Sheen and his son Ramon Estevez combined both their real and stage names to create the Warner Bros.-affiliated company, Estevez Sheen Productions. In November 2010, Sheen was cast as Uncle Ben in Sony&#x27;s 2012 reboot of the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film series, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, directed by Marc Webb.

In 2010 the company released &quot;The Way&quot;, written and directed by Sheen&#x27;s son Emilio Estevez, who also stars in the film. (Martin&#x27;s daughter Renée also has a part in the film.) Martin plays an American doctor, whose son, played by Estevez, dies while hiking the Camino de Santiago. Driven by sadness, Martin&#x27;s character leaves his Californian life and embarks on the pilgrimage from the French Pyrenees to Spain&#x27;s Santiago de Compostela, taking his son&#x27;s ashes with him. &quot;The Way&quot; premiered at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival.

In 2010, Sheen filmed &quot;Stella Days&quot; in County Tipperary, Ireland, near the birthplace of his mother. Thaddeus O&#x27;Sullivan directed and Irish actor Stephen Rea starred, along with IFTA award-winning actress Amy Huberman. Sheen plays parish priest Daniel Barry, whose love of movies leads him to help set up a cinema in Borrisokane.

In 2016, Sheen starred in the film &quot;The Vessel&quot;, performing his role in both the English- and Spanish-language versions.

Sheen played a starring role in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot; (2015–2022). In December 2019 Sheen signed on to play legendary FBI director J. Edgar Hoover alongside Lakeith Stanfield, Jesse Plemons, and Daniel Kaluuya in &quot;Judas and the Black Messiah&quot;. Produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, the film was released in 2021. It was directed by Shaka King and chronicles the death of Black Panther Party leader Fred Hampton in Chicago on December 4, 1969.

==Activism==
Sheen has been active in countless nonviolent acts of civil disobedience and arrested 66 times as he stood up for peace and against nuclear power, nuclear weapons testing, dangerous arms build-up, abuse of farmworkers,
Canadian seal-clubbing and other causes. Although he did not attend college, Sheen credited the Marianists at University of Dayton as a major influence on his public activism, as well as Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Sheen is known for his outspoken support of liberal political causes, such as opposition to United States military actions and a hazardous-waste incinerator in East Liverpool, Ohio. Sheen has dismissed calls for him to run for office, saying: &quot;There&#x27;s no way that I could be the President. You can&#x27;t have a pacifist in the White House... I&#x27;m an actor. This is what I do for a living.&quot; Sheen is an honorary trustee of the Dayton International Peace Museum.

He supported the 1965 farm worker movement with Cesar Chavez in Delano, California. Sheen endorsed marches and walkouts called by the activist group By Any Means Necessary (BAMN) to force the State of California to introduce a holiday in memory of Cesar Chavez. On the day of the protests (March 30), thousands of students, primarily Latino ones from California and elsewhere, walked out of school in support of the demand. Sheen has said he also participated in the large-scale immigration marches in Los Angeles in 2006 and 2007.

According to W. James Antle III, writing in &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, Sheen is a follower of the consistent life ethic, which opposes abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment and war. Sheen articulated his view in an interview with &quot;The Progressive&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m inclined to be against abortion of any life. But I am equally against the death penalty or war.&quot; He also stated at the same occasion: &quot;I personally am opposed to abortion, but I will not judge anybody else&#x27;s right in that regard because I am not a woman and I could never face the actual reality of it.&quot; He also supports the Democrats for Life of America&#x27;s Pregnant Women Support Act.

Sheen starred in Jakov Sedlar&#x27;s religious drama &quot;Gospa&quot; in 1995. He also narrated several movies for the Croatian director during the 1990s.

Sheen and Paul Watson (from the non-profit environmental organization Sea Shepherd Conservation Society) were confronted on May 16, 1995, by a number of Canadian sealers in a hotel on Magdalen Islands over Sea Shepherd&#x27;s history of attacks on sealing and whaling ships. Sheen negotiated with the sealers while Watson was escorted to the airport by police. Sheen became involved with gun control in 2000 after the National Shooting Sports Foundation hired his politically conservative brother, actor Joe Estevez who sounds like Sheen, to do a voice-over for a pro-gunmaker commercial earlier in the year.

In 1997, Sheen volunteered his time to narrate the documentary film &quot;An Act of Conscience&quot;, which follows war tax resisters Randy Kehler and Betsy Corner, who, as a protest against war and military spending, openly refused to pay their federal income taxes, prompting the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to seize their house.
In early 2003, Sheen signed the &quot;Not in My Name&quot; declaration opposing the invasion of Iraq (along with prominent figures such as Noam Chomsky and Susan Sarandon); the declaration appeared in the magazine &quot;The Nation.&quot; Sheen visited Camp Casey on August 28, 2005, to pray with anti-Iraq War activist Cindy Sheehan, who had demanded a second meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush. Addressing Sheehan&#x27;s supporters, Sheen said: &quot;At least you&#x27;ve got the acting president of the United States&quot;, referring to his role as president Josiah Bartlet on &quot;The West Wing.&quot;

During the 1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries, he supported Senator Ted Kennedy and gave multiple speeches supporting him in Florida. Sheen campaigned with Rob Reiner for Democratic presidential candidates Howard Dean and John Kerry in 2004. Members of the Democratic Party in Ohio reportedly contacted Sheen in 2006 to persuade him to run for the United States Senate. Sheen declined the offer, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m just not qualified. You&#x27;re mistaking celebrity for credibility.&quot; In the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election, Sheen initially endorsed New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson and helped raise funds for his campaign. After Richardson dropped out of the campaign, Sheen supported Barack Obama.

In 2006, when Sheen was living in Ireland as a result of his enrollment in NUI Galway, he criticized Irish mushroom farmers for exploiting foreign workers by paying them as little as €2.50 an hour—way below the country&#x27;s minimum wage of €7.65.

From 2008 to 2013, Sheen&#x27;s activism included attendance at meetings of the environmentalist group Earth First! and speaking appearances at youth empowerment events called We Day on behalf of Free the Children, an international charity and educational partner. Sheen has been named an ambassador of Free The Children and has supported such initiatives as the We are Silent campaign, a 24-hour pledge of silence. Speaking about his work with Free The Children, Sheen has said, &quot;I&#x27;m hooked! I told them whenever I could offer some insight or energy or whatever I had, I&#x27;d be delighted if they would call on me, and they have.&quot; Sheen championed Help Darfur Now, a student-run organization to help aid victims of the genocide in Darfur, the western region in Sudan. He also appeared in the 2009 anti-fur documentary &quot;Skin Trade&quot;.

Also in 2009, while walking the Camino de Santiago while filming the 2010 movie &quot;The Way&quot;, Sheen met Gary and Elizabeth Jewson, a married couple from Australia who had lost their 18-year-old daughter Melanie in a car accident in 2004. Inspired by the touching story of Melanie&#x27;s ambitions prior to her untimely death, Sheen became a patron of the foundation when it launched in 2012, and it has since raised more than A$250,000 for helping serve Vanuatu&#x27;s under-resourced health and education systems.

Sheen appeared in television and radio ads urging Washington state residents to vote &quot;no&quot; on Initiative 1000, a proposed assisted suicide law before voters in the 2008 election.

Sheen first spoke to 18,000 young student activists at Free The Children&#x27;s 2010 We Day. &quot;While acting is what I do for a living, activism is what I do to stay alive,&quot; he said.

On December 5, 2011, at Sing Sing Correctional Facility, Sheen met with Jon-Adrian Velazquez, now a legal reform activist who was wrongfully convicted for a 1998 murder of a retired police officer in Harlem. Velazquez was serving 25 years to a life prison sentence. Later that day, Sheen held a press conference at a Manhattan courthouse for Velazquez, advocating for his release. Sheen stated that the case &quot;cries out for justice&quot;. After meeting Velazquez, Sheen said that it &quot;confirmed my belief that Jon-Adrian Velazquez is an innocent man&quot;.

In March 2012, Sheen and George Clooney performed in Dustin Lance Black&#x27;s play &quot;8&quot;—a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California&#x27;s Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage—as attorney Theodore Olson. The production was held at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre and broadcast on YouTube to raise money for the American Foundation for Equal Rights.

Sheen reunited with the cast of &quot;The West Wing&quot; in September 2012 to produce a video explaining Michigan&#x27;s ballot and its partisan and nonpartisan sections. The video doubled as a campaign ad for Bridget McCormack, who was running as a nonpartisan candidate for Michigan&#x27;s Supreme Court. McCormack&#x27;s sister, actress Mary McCormack, co-starred with Sheen on &quot;The West Wing&quot; in its final three seasons.

When the film &quot;&quot; premiered in 2014, Sheen advocated for Amnesty International&#x27;s campaign &quot;Justice for Bhopal&quot;.

Sheen narrated the trailer for a proposed documentary film about the prosecution of former Alabama governor Don Siegelman in 2015.

Sheen donated $1000 to Irish political party Sinn Féin.

== Political views ==
In a speech at Oxford University in 2009, Sheen stated that he had been arrested 66 times for protesting and acts of civil disobedience. He was described by human rights activist Craig Kielburger as having &quot;a rap sheet almost as long as his list of film credits.&quot;

On April 1, 2007, Sheen was arrested, with 38 other activists, for trespassing at the Nevada Test Site at a Nevada Desert Experience event protesting against the site.

He has a long association with Sea Shepherd and that conservation organization has named a ship, the to recognize his commitment and support.

In a 2011 interview with RTÉ, Sheen stated that his wife was conceived through rape, and if her mother had aborted her, or dumped her in the Ohio River as she had considered, his wife would not exist. He also noted that three of his grandchildren were conceived out of wedlock, saying his sons &quot;were not happy at the time but they came to love these children. We have three grown grandchildren, two of them are married, they&#x27;re some of the greatest source [sic] of joy in our lives.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Family===
Sheen married Janet Templeton on December 23, 1961, and they have three sons and a daughter, all of whom are actors: Emilio, Ramón, Carlos, and Renée. Carlos, however, decided to change his name when he began acting, calling himself Charlie Sheen after making the decision to anglicize his first name and take his surname from his father&#x27;s stage name, although he was already known only as Charlie throughout his elementary school years.

Charlie and his father parodied their roles in the 1993 movie &quot;Hot Shots! Part Deux&quot;; when their river patrol boats pass, each shouts, &quot;I loved you in &quot;Wall Street&quot;!&quot; a film they starred in as father and son in 1987.

He has played the father of sons Emilio and Charlie in various projects: he played Emilio&#x27;s father in &quot;The War at Home&quot;, &quot;In the Custody of Strangers&quot; and &quot;The Way&quot;, and Charlie&#x27;s father in &quot;Wall Street&quot;, &quot;No Code of Conduct&quot;, two episodes of &quot;Spin City,&quot; and &quot;Anger Management.&quot; He also appeared as a guest star in one episode of &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; playing the father of Charlie&#x27;s neighbor Rose (Melanie Lynskey), and another as a guest star Denise Richards&#x27;s father; at the time that episode aired, Richards was married to Charlie. Martin also played a &quot;future&quot; version of Charlie in a Visa commercial. Martin has played other characters with his children. He starred in the film &quot;Bobby&quot;, which was directed by Emilio, who also starred in the movie alongside his father. Renée had a supporting role in &quot;The West Wing&quot;, as a White House staff secretary. Emilio also appeared, uncredited, in an episode of &quot;The West Wing&quot; portraying his father&#x27;s character, President Bartlet, in-home movie footage.

Sheen became a grandfather at age 43 when Emilio had a son with his girlfriend, Carey Salley. Sheen has a total of ten grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

In 2012, Sheen was a guest on the U.S. version of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, tracing his Irish and Galician ancestry.

He underwent a quadruple heart bypass operation in December 2015.

===Academic pursuits===
After the end of filming of &quot;The West Wing,&quot; Sheen planned to further his education: &quot;My plan is to read English literature, philosophy and theology in Galway, Ireland, where my late mother came from and where I&#x27;m also a citizen.&quot; Speaking after an honorary arts doctorate was conferred on him by the National University of Ireland, Sheen joked that he would be the &quot;oldest undergraduate&quot; at the National University of Ireland (NUI), Galway, when he started his full-time studies there in the autumn of 2006. Although expressing concern that he might be a &quot;distraction&quot; to other students at NUI Galway, he attended lectures like everyone else. Speaking the week after filming his last episode of &quot;The West Wing,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#x27;m very serious about it.&quot; He once said, &quot;I never went to college when I was young and am looking forward to giving it a try... at age 65!&quot; On September 1, 2006, Sheen was among the first to register as a student at NUI Galway, where he took classes in English literature, philosophy, and oceanography.

Sheen maintains links with Galway and &quot;heartily&quot; supported Michael D. Higgins (himself an alumnus of NUI Galway) in the 2011 Irish presidential election, having become a &quot;dear friend&quot; of Higgins while studying there.

== Religious beliefs ==
Sheen is Catholic, having had his faith restored during conversations in Paris in 1981 with Terrence Malick, director of Sheen&#x27;s breakthrough film, &quot;Badlands&quot; (1973). Sheen stated in a 1983 interview with &quot;The Varsity&quot; that he is a Catholic on a &quot;spiritual level&quot; and that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t care less about religion.&quot; Sheen also stated that he believed in reincarnation. In an interview in 2023, Sheen said how important is the practice of his Catholic faith in his life: &quot; .. I loved the sacraments — confession and the Eucharist and the Mass were of utmost importance to me. I reunited with that, and I found myself&quot;. He is a supporter of the Catholic Worker movement.

==Filmography==
Sheen has worked with a wide variety of film directors, including Richard Attenborough, Francis Ford Coppola, Terrence Malick, David Cronenberg, Mike Nichols, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Oliver Stone. In 2012, he portrayed Uncle Ben in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; directed by Marc Webb.

==Awards and honors==
In film, Sheen has won the Best Actor award at the San Sebastián International Film Festival for his performance as Kit Carruthers in &quot;Badlands&quot;. Sheen&#x27;s portrayal of Capt. Willard in &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; earned a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor. In television, Sheen has won a Golden Globe and two Screen Actors Guild awards for playing the role of President Josiah Bartlet in &quot;The West Wing&quot;, and an Emmy for guest starring in the sitcom &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;. Sheen received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1989.

In the spring of 1989, Sheen was named honorary mayor of Malibu, California. He promptly marked his appointment with a decree proclaiming the area &quot;a nuclear-free zone, a sanctuary for aliens and the homeless, and a protected environment for all life, wild and tame&quot;. Some local citizens were angered by the decree, and the Malibu Chamber of Commerce met in June of that year to consider revoking his title, but voted unanimously to retain him.
While Sheen claims he deliberately failed the entrance exam for the University of Dayton so that he could pursue his acting career, he still has an affinity for UD, and is seen drinking from a &quot;Dayton Flyers&quot; coffee mug during several episodes of &quot;The West Wing.&quot; Sheen also developed an ongoing relationship with Wright State University, where he performed &quot;Love Letters&quot; as a benefit for scholarships in the Department of Theatre, Dance and Motion Pictures, and hosted a trip of donors to the set of &quot;The West Wing&quot; with the department&#x27;s chair, W. Stuart McDowell, in September 2001. The Sheen/Estevez &amp; Augsburger Scholarship Fund has since attracted over $100,000 in scholarships in the arts for students in need at WSU since its inception in 2000. Sheen also has a great affinity for the University of Notre Dame and in 2008 was awarded the Laetare Medal, the highest honor bestowed on American Catholics, in May 2008 at the school&#x27;s commencement.

Sheen received six Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his performance on &quot;The West Wing,&quot; for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in TV-Drama, as well as two SAG Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series, and was part of the cast that received two SAG Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.

In his acting career, Sheen has been nominated for ten Emmy Awards, winning one. He has also earned eight nominations for Golden Globe Awards. Sheen has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 1500 Vine Street.

In 2001 Sheen won a TV Guide Award for &#x27;Actor of the Year in a Drama Series&#x27; for &quot;The West Wing&quot;. In the animated Nickelodeon movie, TV show and TV spin-off of &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron&quot;, there is a character named Sheen Estevez, which is Sheen&#x27;s original last name – Estévez – and working last name, Sheen.

Sheen was the 2003 recipient of the Marquette University Degree of Doctor of Letters, honoris causa for his work on social and Catholic issues. In 2011, he was awarded an honorary life membership in the Law Society of University College Dublin. On May 3, 2015, Sheen received an honorary Doctor of Human Letters degree from the University of Dayton for his lifelong commitment to peace, social justice and human rights exemplifying the Catholic, Marianist university&#x27;s missions.
On May 6, 2023, Loyola Marymount University conferred an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters, honoris causa, upon Sheen for symbolizing in an &quot;outstanding&quot; manner a record of &quot;service that contributes to the public good,&quot; for his &quot;significant contributions to igniting a brighter world,&quot; and for serving as an &quot;exemplar&quot; of &quot;Catholic, Jesuit, and Marymount traditions.&quot;

<text>Joshua Scott &quot;JC&quot; Chasez (; born August 8, 1976) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and dancer. He started his career as a singer, actor, and dancer on &quot;The All New Mickey Mouse Club&quot; before rising to prominence as a member of the boy band NSYNC in the late 90s and early 2000s. The band has sold over 70 million records, becoming one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. Chasez released his debut single &quot;Blowin&#x27; Me Up (With Her Love)&quot; in 2002, following NSYNC&#x27;s decision to go on a hiatus earlier that year. &quot;Schizophrenic&quot;, his debut solo album, was released in 2004. Chasez has written and produced for a wide variety of music acts such as Liam Payne, Diplo, Backstreet Boys, McFly, Sugababes, Victoria Duffield, and Matthew Morrison. He also served as a judge on the first seven seasons of &quot;America&#x27;s Best Dance Crew.&quot;

==Early life==
Joshua Scott Chasez was born on August 8, 1976, in Washington, D.C.. When he was five years old, his biological mother entrusted guardianship of her son to her own former foster parents Roy and Karen Chasez, who worked as a technology company consultant and an editor, respectively. He was adopted by the couple who lived in Bowie, Maryland, and was raised Mennonite along with his younger siblings, Tyler and Heather. Chasez attended the former Robert Goddard Middle School and then Bowie High School.

==Career==
As a child, Chasez was extremely shy, but became interested in dance and got involved in competitive dance troupes. At 13, he entered a talent contest on a dare from a friend and won first place, singing &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot; by Richard Marx. In 1989, his mother saw auditions for Disney Channel&#x27;s revival of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; advertised in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and encouraged him to try out. He was cast as a Mouseketeer in the fourth season, and subsequently moved to Orlando, Florida to film the show. He went by his initials because there was already another cast member named Josh (Ackerman). Chasez was on the show from 1991 to 1995, seasons 4 through 7. During his time on the show, he befriended future bandmate Justin Timberlake and performed alongside Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Keri Russell, Ryan Gosling, Rhona Bennett, and Tony Lucca. In 1995, it was announced that the show would not return for a new season. 

After &quot;The All New Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, Chasez attempted to pursue a solo music career in Los Angeles, but decided to return home to Maryland after he was left feeling cheated. On his drive back, he stopped at Justin Timberlake&#x27;s house in Memphis, Tennessee, where they wrote demos together. Chasez and Timberlake eventually relocated to Nashville while continuing writing songs and demo tracks with Robin Wiley, who was a songwriter and vocal coach on &quot;The All New Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. 

Timberlake then got a phone call from Chris Kirkpatrick to join what would become the boy band NSYNC and he decided to join the group, recommending Chasez as well. Chasez was back home in Maryland saving up to return to Nashville. The three of them then decided to go look in Orlando, Florida for a baritone, where they encountered Joey Fatone, who knew Kirkpatrick from their time working together at Universal Studios Florida, and knew Timberlake and Chasez as well from mutual friends when they were on The All New Mickey Mouse Club. After several auditions, the group recruited Jason Galasso as their bass singer. NSYNC created their name after Timberlake&#x27;s mother commented on how &quot;in sync&quot; the group&#x27;s singing voices were. The group&#x27;s name is also a play on the last letter of each of the initial members&#x27; names: JustiN, ChriS, JoeY, JasoN, and JC. Galasso was soon replaced by Lance Bass after he decided to leave the group.

===1995–2002: NSYNC===

Chasez and Timberlake served as the two lead singers of the boy band NSYNC. The group was formed in 1995 by Chris Kirkpatrick, and they began recording and performing the following year in Europe. In 1998, the band released its debut album &quot;*NSYNC&quot; which sold 11 million copies, earning them popularity in the United States with four number one singles including Tearin&#x27; Up My Heart and (God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You. After the band had a series of legal struggles with manager Lou Pearlman, they signed with Jive Records. They released their third studio album &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; in 2000, which became the fastest-selling album of all time, selling 2.4 million copies in the first week. They held this record until 2015 when Adele surpassed the single-week sales record with her third album &quot;25&quot;. Singles from the &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; album include &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot;, &quot;This I Promise You&quot;, and the number one hit &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be Me&quot;. The band produced their fourth studio album, &quot;Celebrity&quot; in 2001, which sold 1.8 million copies in the first week. NSYNC performed at the Academy Awards in 2000, the 2002 Winter Olympics, and the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show. The group sold more than 70 million records globally, making them the fifth-best selling boy band in history.

After their Celebrity Tour in 2002, NSYNC went on an indefinite hiatus but never formally disbanded. 

=== 2002–2007: Solo years ===

While still a member of NSYNC, Chasez appeared on the remix and album versions of the 1999 single &quot;Bring It All to Me&quot; by the girl group Blaque, though his vocals were credited to NSYNC as a whole. During the band&#x27;s time Chasez became involved with songwriting and production for his group and other artists, including Wild Orchid.

During NSYNC&#x27;s hiatus, Chasez continued to work as a songwriter and producer. Producer Dallas Austin asked Chasez to record the song &quot;Blowin&#x27; Me Up (With Her Love)&quot; for the &quot;Drumline&quot; soundtrack, which was later released as a single. Chasez subsequently began work on a solo album with Jive Records, with tracks written and produced by Austin, Basement Jaxx, Robb Boldt and Riprock &#x27;n&#x27; Alex G as well as Chasez. After numerous delays, his debut album &quot;Schizophrenic&quot; was released in February 2004. Promotion for the album was affected by former bandmate Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson&#x27;s Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, after which Chasez was dropped from performing at half-time at the 2004 Pro Bowl. With the NFL unhappy with the lyrics of the single &quot;Some Girls (Dance with Women)&quot; expressing too much sexuality, Chasez agreed to alter his performance but was met with too much resistance from the organizers, who ultimately replaced Chasez&#x27;s act with Hawaiian hula dancers.

At the same time, Chasez sang vocals on the Basement Jaxx track, &quot;Plug It In&quot;, which reached number one in the UK Dance Charts. Following the release of &quot;Schizophrenic&quot;, Chasez began work on his second album, &quot;The Story of Kate&quot;. The album featured production from Chasez&#x27;s former NSYNC bandmate Timberlake, Timbaland, Dallas Austin, Jimmy Harry, and Emanuel Kiriakou. Timberlake, who produced a few songs for the album, said, &quot;In my opinion, (JC) had the best voice out of all of us...Out of all the boy bands, call &#x27;em what you will, he was the one that could out-sing all of us. And I&#x27;ve known him since I was twelve, so it was fun to sit behind the board and push him.&quot;

Though slated for release in 2006, &quot;The Story of Kate&quot; was delayed to the following year. The two lead singles, &quot;Until Yesterday&quot; and &quot;You Ruined Me&quot; were released online. Chasez performed material from the new album during guests spots on TV shows &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;, &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, and &quot;Pussycat Dolls Present: Girlicious&quot;. After the album&#x27;s release was further stalled, it was effectively cancelled when Chasez and Jive parted ways through mutual decision in September 2007.

=== 2008–2024: &quot;America&#x27;s Best Dance Crew&quot;, songwriting and occasional NSYNC reunions ===

Though the &quot;Story of Kate&quot; was never released, Chasez continues to work as a songwriter and producer, with songs written for David Archuleta, Matthew Morrison and Backstreet Boys. He has written for Taemin, Liz, and NU&#x27;EST. In 2008 he became a judge on Randy Jackson&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Best Dance Crew&quot; on MTV, serving on the panel for the first seven seasons of the show&#x27;s original run.

In November 2010, the song &quot;IF U C Kate&quot; written by Dallas Austin, Taio Cruz, Alan Nglish, and Chasez was featured on the British band McFly&#x27;s album, &quot;Above the Noise&quot;. Chasez wrote and produced two songs on AJ McLean&#x27;s debut album &quot;Have It All&quot;, released in the US in February 2011.

In February 2012 Chasez and producer Jimmy Harry held auditions for an all-girl group which was formed in November the same year under the name Girl Radical. Girl Radical was an eleven-member pop musical act inspired by large Asian pop supergroups.

NSYNC performed for the first time together again at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards to mark Timberlake winning the Video Vanguard Award.

In 2014, Chasez was selected to join the North American tour of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s rock opera &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; as Pontius Pilate. Other cast members included &quot;Superstar&quot; winner Ben Forster and other well-known artists, including Incubus&#x27; Brandon Boyd, Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s Michelle Williams, and Public Image Ltd&#x27;s John Lydon. However, on May 30, 2014, the entire North American tour was abruptly canceled, with poor projected ticket sales cited as the reason.

Along with Miguel and Aloe Blacc, Chasez was featured on a new version of &quot;My Girl&quot; with Smokey Robinson on the album &quot;Smokey &amp; Friends&quot;. In 2015, Chasez appeared, along with 3OH!3, on the title track of the Blues Traveler album &quot;Blow Up the Moon&quot;, and on the song&#x27;s accompanying music video. In 2016, Chasez starred in the film &quot;Opening Night&quot;, in which he played a dramatized version of himself.

In April 2019, Chasez and bandmates Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, and Chris Kirkpatrick performed with Ariana Grande as part of headlining set at Coachella.

In January 2023, Chasez appeared as a guest on former bandmate Lance Bass&#x27; &quot;Frosted Tips&quot; podcast, and revealed he is currently working on a musical.

On September 12, 2023, following weeks of teasers and speculation regarding a potential reunion, Chasez and the other four members of NSYNC appeared together at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards to present the award for Best Pop to Taylor Swift. On September 14, it was confirmed the group recorded a new song titled &quot;Better Place&quot; for the DreamWorks Animation film &quot;Trolls Band Together&quot;. The song, which was released on September 29, 2023, was the group&#x27;s first new song in 22 years.

<text>This list of life sciences comprises the branches of science that involve the scientific study of life – such as microorganisms, plants, and animals including human beings. This science is one of the two major branches of natural science, the other being physical science, which is concerned with non-living matter. Biology is the overall natural science that studies life, with the other life sciences as its sub-disciplines.

Some life sciences focus on a specific type of organism. For example, zoology is the study of animals, while botany is the study of plants. Other life sciences focus on aspects common to all or many life forms, such as anatomy and genetics. Some focus on the micro-scale (e.g. molecular biology, biochemistry) other on larger scales (e.g. cytology, immunology, ethology, pharmacy, ecology). Another major branch of life sciences involves understanding the mindneuroscience. Life sciences discoveries are helpful in improving the quality and standard of life and have applications in health, agriculture, medicine, and the pharmaceutical and food science industries. For example, it has provided information on certain diseases which has overall aided in the understanding of human health.

==Basic life science branches==

* Biology – scientific study of life
* Anatomy – study of form and function, in plants, animals, and other organisms
** Histology – the study of tissues
** Neuroscience – the study of the nervous system
* Astrobiology – the study of the formation and presence of life in the universe
* Biotechnology – study of combination of both the living organism and technology
* Biochemistry – the study of the chemical reactions required for life to exist and function, usually focused on the cellular level
** Quantum biology – the study of quantum phenomena in organisms
* Bioinformatics – developing of methods or software tools for storing, retrieving, organizing and analyzing biological data to generate useful biological knowledge
* Biophysics – study of biological processes by applying the theories and methods that have been traditionally used in the physical sciences
** Biomechanics – the study of the mechanics of living beings
* Botany – study of plants
** Agrostology – the study of grasses and grass-like species
** Phycology – the study of algae
* Cell biology (cytology) – study of the cell as a complete unit, and the molecular and chemical interactions that occur within a living cell
* Developmental biology – the study of the processes through which an organism forms, from zygote to full structure
* Ecology – study of the interactions of living organisms with one another and with the non-living elements of their environment
* Enzymology – study of enzymes

** Aerobiology – study of the movement and transportation of microorganisms in the air
** Bacteriology – study of bacteria
** Virology – study of viruses and virus-like agents
* Molecular biology – the study of biology and biological functions at the molecular level, some cross over with biochemistry, genetics, and microbiology
** Structural biology – a branch of molecular biology, biochemistry, and biophysics concerned with the molecular structure of biological macro-molecules
* Mycology – the study of fungi
* Paleontology – the study of prehistoric organisms
* Parasitology – the study of parasites, their hosts, and the relationship between them
* Pathology – study of the causes and effects of disease or injury
* Human biology – the biological study of human beings
** Pharmacology – study of drug action
** Biological (or physical) anthropology – the study of humans, non-human primates, and hominids
** Biolinguistics – the study of the biology and evolution of language
* Physiology – the study of the functioning of living organisms and the organs and parts of living organisms
* Population biology – the study of groups of conspecific organisms
** Population dynamics – the study of short-term and long-term changes in the size and age composition of populations, and the biological and environmental processes influencing those changes. Population dynamics deals with the way populations are affected by birth and death rates, and by immigration and emigration, and studies topics such as ageing populations or population decline.
* Synthetic biology – the design and construction of new biological entities such as enzymes, genetic circuits and cells, or the redesign of existing biological systems
* Systems biology – the study of the integration and dependencies of various components within a biological system, with particular focus upon the role of metabolic pathways and cell-signaling strategies in physiology
* Theoretical biology – use of abstractions and mathematical models to study biological phenomena
* Toxicology – the study of poisons
* Zoology – the study of (generally non-human) animals
** Ethology – the study of animal behavior

==Applied life science branches and derived concepts==

* Agriculture – science and practice of cultivating plants and livestock
** Agronomy – science of cultivating plants for resources
* Biocomputers – systems of biologically derived molecules, such as DNA and proteins, are used to perform computational calculations involving storing, retrieving, and processing data. The development of biological computing has been made possible by the expanding new science of nanobiotechnology.
* Biocontrol – bioeffector-method of controlling pests (including insects, mites, weeds and plant diseases) using other living organisms.
* Bioengineering – the study of biology through the means of engineering with an emphasis on applied knowledge and especially related to biotechnology
* Bioelectronics – the electrical state of biological matter significantly affects its structure and function, compare for instance the membrane potential, the signal transduction by neurons, the isoelectric point (IEP) and so on. Micro- and nano-electronic components and devices have increasingly been combined with biological systems like medical implants, biosensors, lab-on-a-chip devices etc. causing the emergence of this new scientific field.
* Biomaterials – any matter, surface, or construct that interacts with biological systems. As a science, biomaterials is about fifty years old. The study of biomaterials is called biomaterials science. It has experienced steady and strong growth over its history, with many companies investing large amounts of money into the development of new products. Biomaterials science encompasses elements of medicine, biology, chemistry, tissue engineering and materials science.
* Biomedical science – healthcare science, also known as biomedical science, is a set of applied sciences applying portions of natural science or formal science, or both, to develop knowledge, interventions, or technology of use in healthcare or public health. Such disciplines as medical microbiology, clinical virology, clinical epidemiology, genetic epidemiology and pathophysiology are medical sciences.
* Biomonitoring – measurement of the body burden of toxic chemical compounds, elements, or their metabolites, in biological substances. Often, these measurements are done in blood and urine.
* Biopolymer – polymers produced by living organisms; in other words, they are polymeric biomolecules. Since they are polymers, biopolymers contain monomeric units that are covalently bonded to form larger structures. There are three main classes of biopolymers, classified according to the monomeric units used and the structure of the biopolymer formed: polynucleotides (RNA and DNA), which are long polymers composed of 13 or more nucleotide monomers; polypeptides, which are short polymers of amino acids; and polysaccharides, which are often linear bonded polymeric carbohydrate structures.
* Biotechnology – manipulation of living matter, including genetic modification and synthetic biology
* Conservation biology – Conservation biology is the management of nature and of Earth&#x27;s biodiversity with the aim of protecting species, their habitats, and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions. It is an interdisciplinary subject drawing on natural and social sciences, and the practice of natural resource management.
* Environmental health – multidisciplinary field concerned with environmental epidemiology, toxicology, and exposure science.
* Fermentation technology – study of use of microorganisms for industrial manufacturing of various products like vitamins, amino acids, antibiotics, beer, wine, etc.
* Food science – applied science devoted to the study of food. Activities of food scientists include the development of new food products, design of processes to produce and conserve these foods, choice of packaging materials, shelf-life studies, study of the effects of food on the human body, sensory evaluation of products using panels or potential consumers, as well as microbiological, physical (texture and rheology) and chemical testing.
* Genomics – applies recombinant DNA, DNA sequencing methods, and bioinformatics to sequence, assemble, and analyze the function and structure of genomes (the &quot;complete&quot; set of DNA within a single cell of an organism). The field includes efforts to determine the entire DNA sequence of organisms and fine-scale genetic mapping. The field also includes studies of intragenomic phenomena such as heterosis, epistasis, pleiotropy and other interactions between loci and alleles within the genome. In contrast, the investigation of the roles and functions of single genes is a primary focus of molecular biology or genetics and is a common topic of modern medical and biological research. Research of single genes does not fall into the definition of genomics unless the aim of this genetic, pathway, and functional information analysis is to elucidate its effect on, place in, and response to the entire genome&#x27;s networks.
* Health sciences – are those sciences which focus on health, or health care, as core parts of their subject matter. These two subject matters relate to multiple academic disciplines, both STEM disciplines, as well as emerging patient safety disciplines (such as social care research), and are both relevant to current health science knowledge.
** Medical devices – A medical device is an instrument, apparatus, implant, in vitro reagent, or similar or related article that is used to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease or other conditions, and does not achieve its purposes through chemical action within or on the body (which would make it a drug). Whereas &quot;medicinal products&quot; (also called &quot;pharmaceuticals&quot;) achieve their principal action by pharmacological, metabolic or immunological means, &quot;medical devices&quot; act by other means like physical, mechanical, or thermal means.
** Medical imaging – Medical imaging is the technique and process used to create images of the human body (or parts and function thereof) for clinical or physiological research purposes
** Immunotherapy – is the &quot;treatment of disease by inducing, enhancing, or suppressing an immune response&quot;. Immunotherapies designed to elicit or amplify an immune response are classified as activation immunotherapies, while immunotherapies that reduce or suppress are classified as suppression immunotherapies.
* Kinesiology – Kinesiology, also known as human kinetics, is the scientific study of human movement. Kinesiology addresses physiological, mechanical, and psychological mechanisms. Applications of kinesiology to human health include: biomechanics and orthopedics; strength and conditioning; sport psychology; methods of rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy; and sport and exercise. Individuals who have earned degrees in kinesiology can work in research, the fitness industry, clinical settings, and in industrial environments. Studies of human and animal motion include measures from motion tracking systems, electrophysiology of muscle and brain activity, various methods for monitoring physiological function, and other behavioral and cognitive research techniques.
* Optogenetics – Optogenetics is a neuromodulation technique employed in neuroscience that uses a combination of techniques from optics and genetics to control and monitor the activities of individual neurons in living tissue—even within freely-moving animals—and to precisely measure the effects of those manipulations in real-time. The key reagents used in optogenetics are light-sensitive proteins. Spatially-precise neuronal control is achieved using optogenetic actuators like channelrhodopsin, halorhodopsin, and archaerhodopsin, while temporally-precise recordings can be made with the help of optogenetic sensors like Clomeleon, Mermaid, and SuperClomeleon.
* Pharmacogenomics – Pharmacogenomics (a portmanteau of pharmacology and genomics) is the technology that analyses how genetic makeup affects an individual&#x27;s response to drugs. It deals with the influence of genetic variation on drug response in patients by correlating gene expression or single-nucleotide polymorphisms with a drug&#x27;s efficacy or toxicity.
* Pharmacology – Pharmacology is the branch of medicine and biology concerned with the study of drug action, where a drug can be broadly defined as any human-made, natural, or endogenous (within the body) molecule which exerts a biochemical and/or physiological effect on the cell, tissue, organ, or organism. More specifically, it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function. If substances have medicinal properties, they are considered pharmaceuticals.
* Proteomics – Proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins, particularly their structures and functions. Proteins are vital parts of living organisms, as they are the main components of the physiological metabolic pathways of cells. The proteome is the entire set of proteins, produced or modified by an organism or system. This varies with time and distinct requirements, or stresses, that a cell or organism undergoes.

<text>Puducherry (; ), also known as Pondicherry (; ), is a union territory of India, consisting of four small geographically unconnected districts. It was formed out of four territories of former French India, namely Pondichéry (now Puducherry), Karikal (Karaikal), Mahé and Yanaon (now Yanam), excluding Chandannagar (Chandernagore), and it is named after the largest district, Puducherry, which was also the capital of French India. Historically known as Pondicherry (), the territory changed its official name to Puducherry on 1 October 2006.

The Union Territory of Puducherry lies in the southern part of the Indian Peninsula. The areas of Puducherry district and Karaikal district are bound by the state of Tamil Nadu, while Yanam district and Mahé district are enclosed by the states of Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, respectively. Puducherry is the 29th most populous of the 36 states and union territories of India, and the third most densely populated union territory. It has a gross domestic product (GDP) of and ranks 25th in India.

==Name==
The name &quot;Puducherry&quot; is a compound of the Tamil words () and () meaning &#x27;new slum&#x27;; its old name &quot;Pondicherry&quot; is a gallicised version of () meaning &#x27;slum of Pandis&#x27;.

Puducherry has five official names, owing to its linguistic diversity, past-French heritage and the legacy of British India.

== History ==

The earliest recorded history of the municipality of Puducherry can be traced to the second century CE. The &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; mentions a marketplace named &quot;Poduke or Poduka&quot; (ch 60). G. W. B. Huntingford suggested this might be a site about 2 miles from the modern Puducherry, which was possibly the location of Arikamedu (now part of Ariyankuppam). Huntingford noted that Roman pottery was found at Arikamedu in 1937. In addition, archaeological excavations between 1944 and 1949 showed that it was &quot;a trading station to which goods of Roman manufacture were imported during the first half of the 1st century&quot; Subsequent investigation by Vimala Begley from 1989 to 1992 modified this assessment, and now place the period of occupation from the third or second century BCE to the eighth century CE.

In 1674, the municipality of Pondicherry (Pondichéry) became a colony in the French colonial empire. Together with Chandernagor (already French since 1673), Mahé (since 1721), Yanam (Yanaon) (since 1723), Karaikal (Karikal) (since 1739) and Masulipatam (1760), it formed the colony of French India, under a single French governor in Pondicherry, although French rule over one or more of these enclaves was repeatedly interrupted by British occupations. The territories of French India were completely transferred to the Republic of India &quot;de facto&quot; on 1 November 1954, and &quot;de jure&quot; on 16 August 1962, when French India ceased to exist, becoming the present Indian union territory of Pondicherry, combining four coastal enclaves. The fifth, Chandannagar, merged with the state of West Bengal in 1954. Immediately after the &quot;de facto&quot; transfer, the area was renamed the &#x27;State of Pondicherry&#x27; by the &quot;French Establishments (Change of Name) Order, 1954&quot; issued by the Ministry of External Affairs of India. The State of Pondicherry continued to be under the direct control of the Government of India under the aegis of the Ministry of External affairs until 31 August 1964. Meanwhile, with effect from 1 July 1963, the State of Pondicherry officially became the Union Territory of Pondicherry and after 31 August 1964 it came under the control of the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Until 2016, the &quot;de jure transfer day&quot; (i.e. 16 August) was a public holiday with no official celebrations taking place. In 2016, Lt. Governor of Puducherry, Kiran Bedi, made it a holiday as &quot;De Jure Transfer Day.&quot;

Since 2010, &quot;de facto transfer day&quot; (i.e. 1 November) has been celebrated as Liberation day throughout Puducherry. In 2014, Liberation day was declared as a public Holiday. This initiative was taken shortly after the NDA government came to power in 2014 and newly appointed Lt. Governor A. K. Singh issued a notification regarding that decision of the central government.

==Geography==
The Union Territory of Puducherry consists of four small unconnected districts: Puducherry district (), Karaikal district () and Yanam district () on the Bay of Bengal and Mahé district () on the Laccadive Sea, covering a total area of . Puducherry and Karaikal have the largest areas and population, and are both enclaves of Tamil Nadu. Yanam and Mahé are enclaves of Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, respectively. Its population, as per the 2011 Census, is 1,394,467. Puducherry is the smallest union territory in terms of sea coastline with 30.6 km length.

Some of Puducherry&#x27;s regions are themselves amalgamations of non-contiguous enclaves, often called &quot;pockets&quot; in India. The Puducherry region is made of 11 such pockets, some of which are very small and entirely surrounded by the territory of Tamil Nadu. Mahé region is made up of three pockets. This unusual geography is a legacy of the colonial period with Puducherry retaining the borders of former French India.

All four regions of Puducherry are located in the coastal region. Five rivers in Puducherry district, seven in Karaikal district, two in Mahé district and one in Yanam district drain into the sea, but none originates within the territory.

==Districts==

* Pondicherry district is an enclave of Tamil Nadu, also serves as the capital of Union Territory of Puducherry.
* Karaikal district is an enclave of Tamil Nadu.
* Mahé district is an enclave of Kerala.
* Yanam district is an enclave of Andhra Pradesh.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 census, Hinduism is the major religion, adhered to by 87.3% of the population. Other religions practiced in the territory include Christianity (6.3%) and Islam (6.1%).

According to the 2011 census, Tamil is the major language spoken by 88.22% of the population. Other languages spoken in the territory include Telugu (5.96%) and Malayalam (3.84%).

== Government and administration ==


Puducherry is a union territory of India rather than a state, which implies that governance and administration fall directly under federal authority. It is one of three union territories (with the National Capital Territory of Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir) entitled by a special constitutional amendment to an elected legislative assembly and cabinet of ministers, thereby conveying partial statehood. There has been some interest by the territory&#x27;s government in receiving full statehood, but budgetary issues remain a consideration. Also, Mahe and Yanam may oppose such a change of status.

The central government is represented by the Lieutenant Governor, who resides at the Raj Nivas (Le Palais du Gouverneur) at the Park, the former palace of the French governor. The central government is more directly involved in the territory&#x27;s financial well-being unlike states, which have a central grant that they administer. Consequently, Puducherry has at various times, enjoyed lower taxes, especially in the indirect category.

=== Special administration status ===

According to the Treaty of Cession of 1956, the four territories of former French India territorial administration are permitted to make laws with respect to specific matters. In many cases, such legislation may require ratification from the federal government or the assent of the President of India.

Article II of the Treaty states:
 (The Establishments will keep the benefit of the special administrative status which was in force prior to 1 November 1954. Any constitutional changes in this status which may be made subsequently shall be made after ascertaining the wishes of the people).

=== Languages ===

The most widely spoken first language is Tamil, which is native to % of the population. There are also speakers of Telugu (%), Malayalam (%) and Urdu (%). The official languages of Puducherry are French, Tamil, Telugu (in Yanam), Malayalam (in Mahe) and English. An official mention in Rajya Sabha Parliamentary debates during 2006 confirms that Puducherry has all these five languages as official.
==== Continuation of French ====
Even after the de facto transfer of the French Indian settlements in November 1954, French continued to remain as the official language according to Article XXVIII of the (Treaty of Cession) of 1956.

Article XXVIII of the Treaty states:
 (The French language shall remain the official language of the Establishments so long as the elected representatives of the people shall not decide otherwise).

The 1963 Pondicherry representative assembly resolution also voted for continuance of French as official language and addition of other languages spoken in Puducherry such as Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam along with English and Hindi.

==== Inclusion of other languages ====
Considering the 1956 Treaty of cession and 1963 Assembly resolution, the 1963 Union Territories Act reconfirmed the 1963 resolution that French shall continue to be used as an official language unless the legislative assembly decides otherwise. The 1963 act allowed provision for inclusion of more official languages. Two years later, new official languages were recognised by The Pondicherry Official Language Act, 1965 which makes no mention of French (but also not officially denying it) implying the implicit continuation of its official language status. The same act stated that the Tamil language shall be the language to be used for all or any of the official purposes of the Union territory and the same official recognition is given for English. The same act also recognized officially Malayalam and Telugu in the Mahé and Yanam districts respectively.

The widespread anti-Hindi agitations in the mid-1960s in South India would have prompted for inclusion of all the languages suggested in the 1963 assembly resolution except Hindi in the list of official languages of Puducherry. While the Union Territory official gazette&#x27;s name is in French (), it is published exclusively in English.

=== Judiciary ===
The jurisdiction of the Madras High Court has been extended to Pondicherry with effect from 6 November 1962. The Chief Justice of the Madras High Court is the head of the judiciary of Puducherry. The present chief justice is S. V. Gangapurwala.

===Fisheries===
The potential for fisheries is substantial in the Union Territory. The four regions of the Union Territory have a coastline of 45 km with of inshore waters, of inland water and 800 ha of brackish water. 27 marine fishing villages and 23 inland fishing villages host a fishermen population of about 65,000 of which 13,000 are actively engaged in fishing. Tanks and ponds are also tapped for commercial fish rearing.

<doc id="68145" wikidata="Q465087" url="?curid=68145" title="The Jazz Singer">
<text>The Jazz Singer is a 1927 American part-talkie musical drama film directed by Alan Crosland and produced by Warner Bros. Pictures. It is the first feature-length motion picture with both synchronized recorded music and lip-synchronous singing and speech (in several isolated sequences). Its release heralded the commercial ascendance of sound films and effectively marked the end of the silent film era with the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system, featuring six songs performed by Al Jolson. Based on the 1925 play of the same title by Samson Raphaelson, the plot was adapted from his short story &quot;The Day of Atonement&quot;.

The film depicts the fictional story of Jakie Rabinowitz, a young man who defies the traditions of his devout Jewish family. After singing popular tunes in a beer garden, he is punished by his father, a hazzan (cantor), prompting Jakie to run away from home. Some years later, now calling himself Jack Robin, he has become a talented jazz singer, performing in blackface. He attempts to build a career as an entertainer, but his professional ambitions ultimately come into conflict with the demands of his home and heritage.

Darryl F. Zanuck won an Academy Honorary Award for producing the film; Alfred A. Cohn was nominated for Best Writing (Adaptation) at the 1st Academy Awards. In 1996, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 1998, the film was chosen in voting conducted by the American Film Institute as one of the best American films of all time, ranking at number ninety. The film&#x27;s copyright expired on January 1, 2023, when all works published in the U.S. in 1927 entered the public domain.
==Plot==
Cantor Rabinowitz wants his 13-year-old son, Jacob &quot;Jakie&quot; Rabinowitz, to carry on the generations-old family tradition and become a cantor at the synagogue in the Jewish ghetto of Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. Jakie has instead taken a liking to singing jazz at the local beer garden. Moisha Yudelson spots the boy and tells Jakie&#x27;s father, who drags him home. Jakie clings to his mother, Sara, as his father declares, &quot;I&#x27;ll teach him better than to debase the voice God gave him!&quot; Jakie threatens: &quot;If you whip me again, I&#x27;ll run away—and &quot;never come back!&quot;&quot; After the whipping, Jakie kisses his mother goodbye and, true to his word, runs away. At the Yom Kippur service, Rabinowitz mournfully tells a fellow celebrant, &quot;My son was to stand at my side and sing tonight—but now I have no son.&quot; As the sacred Kol Nidre is sung, Jakie sneaks back home to retrieve a picture of his loving mother.

About ten years later, Jakie has anglicized his name to Jack Robin. Jack is called up from his table at a cabaret to perform on stage (&quot;Dirty Hands, Dirty Face&quot;).

Jack wows the crowd with his energized rendition of &quot;Toot, Toot, Tootsie.&quot; Afterward, he is introduced to the beautiful Mary Dale, a musical theater dancer. &quot;There are lots of jazz singers, but &quot;you&quot; have a tear in your voice,&quot; she says, offering to help with his budding career. With her help, Jack eventually gets his big break: a leading part in the new musical &quot;April Follies&quot;.

Back at the family home Jack left long ago, the elder Rabinowitz instructs a young student in the traditional cantorial art. Jack appears and tries to explain his point of view, and his love of modern music, but the appalled cantor banishes him: &quot;I never want to see you again—you &quot;jazz singer!&quot;&quot; As he leaves, Jack makes a prediction: &quot;I came home with a heart full of love, but you don&#x27;t want to understand. Some day you&#x27;ll understand, the same as Mama does.&quot;

Two weeks after Jack&#x27;s expulsion from the family home and 24 hours before the opening night of &quot;April Follies&quot; on Broadway, Jack&#x27;s father falls gravely ill. Jack is asked to choose between the show and duty to his family and faith: in order to sing the Kol Nidre for Yom Kippur in his father&#x27;s place, he will have to miss the big premiere.

That evening, the eve of Yom Kippur, Yudelson tells the Jewish elders, &quot;For the first time, we have no Cantor on the Day of Atonement.&quot; Lying in his bed, weak and gaunt, Cantor Rabinowitz tells Sara that he cannot perform on the most sacred of holy days: &quot;My son came to me in my dreams—he sang Kol Nidre so beautifully. If he would only sing like that tonight—surely he would be forgiven.&quot;

As Jack prepares for a dress rehearsal by applying blackface makeup, he and Mary discuss his career aspirations and the family pressures they agree he must resist. Sara and Yudelson come to Jack&#x27;s dressing room to plead for him to come to his father and sing in his stead. Jack is torn. He delivers his blackface performance (&quot;Mother of Mine, I Still Have You&quot;), and Sara sees her son on stage for the first time. She has a tearful revelation: &quot;Here he belongs. If God wanted him in His house, He would have kept him there. He&#x27;s not &quot;my&quot; boy anymore—he belongs to the whole world now.&quot;

Afterward, Jack returns to the Rabinowitz home. He kneels at his father&#x27;s bedside and the two converse fondly: &quot;My son—I love you.&quot; Sara suggests that it may help heal his father if Jack takes his place at the Yom Kippur service. Mary arrives with the producer, who warns Jack that he&#x27;ll never work on Broadway again if he fails to appear on opening night. Jack can not decide. Mary challenges him: &quot;Were you lying when you said your career came before &quot;everything?&quot;&quot; Jack is unsure if he even can replace his father: &quot;I haven&#x27;t sung Kol Nidre since I was a little boy.&quot; His mother tells him, &quot;Do what is in your heart, Jakie—if you sing and God is not in your voice—your father will know.&quot; The producer cajoles Jack: &quot;You&#x27;re a &quot;jazz singer&quot; at heart!&quot;

At the theater, the opening night audience is told that there will be no performance. Jack sings the Kol Nidre in his father&#x27;s place. His father listens from his deathbed to the nearby ceremony and speaks his last, forgiving words: &quot;Mama, we have our son again.&quot; The spirit of Jack&#x27;s father is shown at his side in the synagogue. Mary has come to listen. She sees how Jack has reconciled the division in his soul: &quot;a jazz singer—singing to his God.&quot;

&quot;The season passes—and time heals—the show goes on.&quot; Jack, as &quot;The Jazz Singer,&quot; is now appearing at the Winter Garden theater, apparently as the featured performer opening for a show called &quot;Back Room&quot;. In the front row of the packed theater, his mother sits alongside Yudelson. Jack, in blackface, performs the song &quot;My Mammy&quot; for her and the world.

==Production==
===Concept and development===
On April 25, 1917, Samson Raphaelson, a native of New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side and a University of Illinois undergraduate, attended a performance of the musical &quot;Robinson Crusoe, Jr.&quot; in Champaign, Illinois. The star of the show was a thirty-year-old singer, Al Jolson, a Lithuanian-born Jew who performed in blackface. In a 1927 interview, Raphaelson described the experience: &quot;I shall never forget the first five minutes of Jolson—his velocity, the amazing fluidity with which he shifted from a tremendous absorption in his audience to a tremendous absorption in his song.&quot; He explained that he had seen emotional intensity like Jolson&#x27;s only among synagogue cantors.

A few years later, pursuing a professional literary career, Raphaelson wrote &quot;The Day of Atonement&quot;, a short story about a young Jew named Jakie Rabinowitz, based on Jolson&#x27;s real life. The story was published in January 1922 in &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Raphaelson later adapted the story into a stage play, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;. A straight drama, all the singing in Raphaelson&#x27;s version takes place offstage. With George Jessel in the lead role, the show premiered at the Warner Theatre in Times Square in September 1925 and became a hit. Warner Bros. acquired the movie rights to the play on June 4, 1926, and signed Jessel to a contract. &quot;The Moving Picture World&quot; published a story in February 1927 announcing that production on the film would begin with Jessel on May 1.

But the plans to make the film with Jessel would fall through, for multiple reasons. Jessel&#x27;s contract with Warner Bros. had not anticipated that the movie they had particularly signed him for would be made with sound (he&#x27;d made a modestly budgeted, silent comedy in the interim). When Warner had hits with two Vitaphone, though dialogue-less, features in late 1926, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; production had been reconceived. Jessel asked for a bonus or a new contract, but was rebuffed. According to Jessel&#x27;s description in his autobiography, Harry Warner &quot;was having a tough time with the financing of the company... He talked about taking care of me if the picture was a success. I did not feel that was enough.&quot; In fact, around the beginning of 1927, Harry Warner—the eldest of the brothers who ran the eponymous studio—had sold $4 million of his personal stock to keep the studio solvent. Then came another major issue. According to Jessel, a first read of screenwriter Alfred A. Cohn&#x27;s adaptation &quot;threw me into a fit. Instead of the boy&#x27;s leaving the theatre and following the traditions of his father by singing in the synagogue, as in the play, the picture scenario had him return to the Winter Garden as a blackface comedian, with his mother wildly applauding in the box. I raised hell. Money or no money, I would not do this.&quot;

According to performer Eddie Cantor, as negotiations between Warner Bros. and Jessel floundered, Jack L. Warner and the studio&#x27;s production chief, Darryl Zanuck, called to see if he was interested in the part. Cantor, a friend of Jessel&#x27;s, responded that he was sure any differences with the actor could be worked out and offered his assistance. Cantor was not invited to participate in the Jessel talks; instead, the role was then offered to Jolson, who had inspired it in the first place. Describing Jolson as the production&#x27;s best choice for its star, film historian Donald Crafton wrote, &quot;The entertainer, who sang jazzed-up minstrel numbers in blackface, was at the height of his phenomenal popularity. Anticipating the later stardom of crooners and rock stars, Jolson electrified audiences with the vitality and sex appeal of his songs and gestures, which owed much to black american sources.&quot; As described by film historian Robert L. Carringer, &quot;Jessel was a vaudeville comedian and master of ceremonies with one successful play and one modestly successful film to his credit. Jolson was a superstar.&quot; Jolson took the part, signing a $75,000 contract on May 26, 1927, for eight weeks of services beginning in July. There have been several claims but no proof that Jolson invested some of his own money in the film. Jessel and Jolson, also friends, did not speak for some time after—on the one hand, Jessel had been confiding his problems with the Warners to Jolson; on the other, Jolson had signed with them without telling Jessel of his plans. In his autobiography, Jessel wrote that, in the end, Jolson &quot;must not be blamed, as the Warners had definitely decided that I was out.&quot;

===Introduction of sound===
While many earlier sound films had dialogue, all were short subjects. D. W. Griffith&#x27;s feature &quot;Dream Street&quot; (1921) was shown in New York with a single singing sequence and crowd noises, using the sound-on-disc system Photokinema. The film was preceded by a program of sound shorts, including a sequence with Griffith speaking directly to the audience, but the feature itself had no talking scenes. On April 15, 1923, Lee De Forest introduced the sound-on-film system Phonofilm, which had synchronized sound and dialogue, but the sound quality was poor, and the films produced in this process were short films only.

The first Warner Bros. Vitaphone features, &quot;Don Juan&quot; (premiered August 1926) and &quot;The Better &#x27;Ole&quot; (premiered October 1926), like three more that followed in early 1927 (&quot;When a Man Loves&quot;, &quot;Old San Francisco&quot;, and &quot;The First Auto&quot;), had only a synchronized instrumental score and sound effects. &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; contains those, as well as numerous synchronized singing sequences and some synchronized speech: Two popular tunes are performed by the young Jakie Rabinowitz, the future Jazz Singer; his father, a cantor, performs the devotional Kol Nidre; the famous cantor Yossele Rosenblatt, appearing as himself, sings an excerpt of another religious melody, Kaddish, and the song &quot;Yahrzeit Licht&quot;. As the adult Jack Robin, Jolson performs six songs: five popular &quot;jazz&quot; tunes and the Kol Nidre. The sound for the film was recorded by British-born George Groves, who had also worked on &quot;Don Juan&quot;. To direct, the studio chose Alan Crosland, who already had two Vitaphone films to his credit: &quot;Don Juan&quot; and &quot;Old San Francisco&quot;, which opened while &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was in production.

Jolson&#x27;s first vocal performance, about fifteen minutes into the picture, is of &quot;Dirty Hands, Dirty Face&quot;, with music by James V. Monaco and lyrics by Edgar Leslie and Grant Clarke. The first synchronized speech, uttered by Jack to a cabaret crowd and to the piano player in the band that accompanies him, occurs directly after that performance, beginning at the 17:25 mark of the film. Jack&#x27;s first spoken words—&quot;Wait a minute, wait a minute, you ain&#x27;t heard nothin&#x27; yet&quot;—were well-established stage patter of Jolson&#x27;s. He had even spoken very similar lines in an earlier short, &quot;A Plantation Act&quot; (1926). The line had become virtually an in-joke. In November 1918, during a gala concert celebrating the end of World War I, Jolson ran onstage amid the applause for the preceding performer, the great operatic tenor Enrico Caruso, and exclaimed, &quot;Folks, you ain&#x27;t heard nothin&#x27; yet.&quot; The following year, he recorded the song &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Heard Nothin&#x27; Yet&quot;. In a later scene, Jack talks with his mother, played by Eugenie Besserer, in the family parlor; his father enters and pronounces one very conclusive word, &quot;Stop!&quot;, the final line of dialogue in the film.

In total, the movie contains barely two minutes&#x27; worth of synchronized talking, much or all of it improvised. The rest of the dialogue is presented through the caption cards, or intertitles, standard in silent movies of the era; as was common, those titles were composed not by the film&#x27;s scenarist, Alfred Cohn, but by another writer – in this case, Jack Jarmuth.

While Jolson was touring with a stage show during June 1927, production on &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; began with the shooting of exterior scenes by the second unit. In late June, Alan Crosland headed to New York City to shoot the Lower East Side and Winter Garden exteriors on location. Jolson joined the production in mid-July (his contract specified July 11). Filming with Jolson began with his silent scenes; the more complex Vitaphone sequences were primarily done in late August. Both Jolson and Zanuck would later take credit for thinking up the ad-libbed dialogue sequence between Jack and his mother; another story had it that Sam Warner was impressed by Jolson&#x27;s brief ad-libbing in the cabaret scene and had Cohn come up with some lines on the spot. On September 23, &quot;Motion Picture News&quot; reported that production on the film had been completed.

The production cost for &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was $422,000 (approximately US$ in dollars), a large sum, especially for Warner Bros., which rarely spent more than $250,000. It was by no means a record for the studio, however; two features starring John Barrymore had been costlier: &quot;The Sea Beast&quot; (1926), a loose and entirely silent adaptation of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, at $503,000 and &quot;Don Juan&quot; at $546,000. Nonetheless, the outlay constituted a major gamble in light of the studio&#x27;s financial straits: while &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was in production, Harry Warner stopped taking a salary, pawned jewelry belonging to his wife, and moved his family into a smaller apartment.

==Premiere and reception==

The premiere occurred on October 6, 1927, at Warner Bros.&#x27; flagship theater in New York City. In keeping with the film&#x27;s theme of a conflict within a Jewish family, the film premiered after sunset on the eve of the Yom Kippur holiday. The buildup to the premiere was tense. Besides Warner Bros.&#x27; precarious financial position, the physical presentation of the film itself was remarkably complex:Each of Jolson&#x27;s musical numbers was mounted on a separate reel with a separate accompanying sound disc. Even though the film was only eighty-nine minutes long...there were fifteen reels and fifteen discs to manage, and the projectionist had to be able to thread the film and cue up the Vitaphone records very quickly. The least stumble, hesitation, or human error would result in public and financial humiliation for the company. None of the four Warner brothers were able to attend: Sam Warner—among them, the strongest advocate for Vitaphone—had died the previous day of pneumonia, and the surviving brothers had returned to California for his funeral.

According to Doris Warner, who was in attendance, about halfway through the film she began to feel that something exceptional was taking place. Suddenly, Jolson&#x27;s face appeared in big close-up, and said &quot;Wait a minute, wait a minute, you ain&#x27;t heard nothing yet!&quot; Jolson&#x27;s &quot;Wait a minute&quot; line prompted a loud, positive response from the audience, who were dumbfounded by seeing and hearing someone speak on a film for the first time, so much so that the double-entendre was missed at first. Applause followed each of his songs. Excitement built, and when Jolson and Eugenie Besserer began their dialogue scene, &quot;the audience became hysterical.&quot; After the show, the audience turned into a &quot;milling, battling, mob&quot;, in one journalist&#x27;s description, chanting &quot;Jolson, Jolson, Jolson!&quot; Among those who reviewed the film, the critic who foresaw most clearly what it presaged for the future of cinema was &quot;Life&quot; magazine&#x27;s Robert E. Sherwood. He described the spoken dialogue scene between Jolson and Besserer as &quot;fraught with tremendous significance... I for one suddenly realized that the end of the silent drama is in sight&quot;.

Critical reaction was generally, though far from universally, positive. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Mordaunt Hall, reviewing the film&#x27;s premiere, declared that

not since the first presentation of Vitaphone features, more than a year ago (i.e. &quot;Don Juan&quot;), has anything like the ovation been heard in a motion-picture theatre... The Vitaphoned songs and some dialogue have been introduced most adroitly. This in itself is an ambitious move, for in the expression of song the Vitaphone vitalizes the production enormously. The dialogue is not so effective, for it does not always catch the nuances of speech or inflections of the voice so that one is not aware of the mechanical features.

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;[u]ndoubtedly the best thing Vitaphone has ever put on the screen...[with] abundant power and appeal.&quot; Richard Watts Jr. of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; called it a &quot;pleasantly sentimental orgy dealing with a struggle between religion and art... [T]his is not essentially a motion picture, but rather a chance to capture for comparative immortality the sight and sound of a great performer.&quot; The &quot;Exhibitors Herald&quot;″s take was virtually identical: &quot;scarcely a motion picture. It should be more properly labeled an enlarged Vitaphone record of Al Jolson in half a dozen songs.&quot; The film received favorable reviews in both the Jewish press and in African American newspapers such as the &quot;Baltimore Afro-American&quot;, the &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot;, and the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;. The headline of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; review told a somewhat different story: &quot;&#x27;Jazz Singer&#x27; Scores a Hit—Vitaphone and Al Jolson Responsible, Picture Itself Second Rate.&quot; &quot;Photoplay&quot; dismissed Jolson as &quot;no movie actor. Without his Broadway reputation he wouldn&#x27;t rate as a minor player.&quot;

==Commercial impact and industrial influence==

The film developed into a major hit, demonstrating the profit potential of feature-length &quot;talkies&quot;, but Donald Crafton has shown that the reputation the film later acquired for being one of Hollywood&#x27;s most enormous successes to date was inflated. The movie did well, but not astonishingly so, in the major cities where it was first released, garnering much of its impressive profits with long, steady runs in population centers large and small all around the country. As conversion of movie theaters to sound was still in its early stages, the film actually arrived at many of those secondary venues in a silent version. On the other hand, Crafton&#x27;s statement that &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; &quot;was in a distinct second or third tier of attractions compared to the most popular films of the day and even other Vitaphone talkies&quot; is also incorrect. In fact, the film was easily the biggest earner in Warner Bros. history, and would remain so until it was surpassed a year later by &quot;The Singing Fool&quot;, another Jolson feature. In the larger scope of Hollywood, among films originally released in 1927, available evidence suggests that &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was among the three biggest box office hits, trailing only &quot;Wings&quot; and, perhaps, &quot;The King of Kings&quot;.

According to Warner Bros records the film earned revenues of $1,974,000 in the United States and Canada, and $651,000 elsewhere, for a worldwide theatrical gross rental of approximately $2.6 million (the studio&#x27;s share of the box office gross) and a profit of $1,196,750.

One of the keys to the film&#x27;s success was an innovative marketing scheme conceived by Sam Morris, Warner Bros.&#x27; sales manager. In Crafton&#x27;s description:

[A] special clause in Warners&#x27; Vitaphone exhibition contract virtually guaranteed long runs. Theaters had to book &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; for full rather than split weeks. Instead of the traditional flat rental fee, Warners took a percentage of the gate. A sliding scale meant that the exhibitor&#x27;s take increased the longer the film was held over. The signing of this contract by the greater New York Fox Theatres circuit was regarded as a headline-making precedent.

Similar arrangements, based on a percentage of the gross rather than flat rental fees, would soon become standard for the U.S. film industry&#x27;s high-end or &quot;A&quot; product.

Though in retrospect it is understood that the success of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; signaled the end of the silent motion-picture era, this was not immediately apparent. Mordaunt Hall, for example, praised Warner Bros. for &quot;astutely realiz[ing] that a film conception of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was one of the few subjects that would lend itself to the use of the Vitaphone.&quot; In historian Richard Koszarski&#x27;s words, &quot;Silent films did not disappear overnight, nor did talking films immediately flood the theaters... Nevertheless, 1927 remains the year that Warner Bros. moved to close the book on the history of silent pictures, even if their original goal had been somewhat more modest.&quot;

The film had other effects that were more immediate. George Jessel, who was in his third season touring with the stage production of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, later described what happened to his show—perhaps anticipating how sound would soon cement Hollywood&#x27;s dominance of the American entertainment industry: &quot;A week or two after the Washington engagement the sound-and-picture version of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; with Al Jolson was sweeping the country, and I was swept out of business. I couldn&#x27;t compete with a picture theatre across the street showing the first great sound picture in the world...for fifty cents, while the price at my theatre was $3.00.&quot;

As the truly pivotal event, Crafton points to the national release of the film&#x27;s sound version in early 1928—he dates it to January, Block and Wilson to February 4. In March, Warners announced that &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was playing at a record 235 theaters (though many could still show it only silently). In May, a consortium including the leading Hollywood studios signed up with Western Electric&#x27;s licensing division, ERPI, for sound conversion. In July, Warner Bros. released the first all-talking feature, &quot;Lights of New York&quot;, a musical crime melodrama.

On September 27, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; became the first feature-length talking picture to be shown in Europe when it premiered at London&#x27;s Piccadilly Theatre. The movie &quot;created a sensation&quot;, according to British film historian Rachael Low. &quot;&quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was a turning point [for the introduction of sound]. &quot;The Bioscope&quot; greeted it with, &#x27;We are inclined to wonder why we ever called them Living Pictures.&#x27;&quot; The Paris sound premiere followed in January 1929.

Before the 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held in May 1929, honoring films released between August 1927 and July 1928, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was ruled ineligible for the two top prizes—the Outstanding Picture, Production and the Unique and Artistic Production—on the basis that it would have been unfair competition for the silent pictures under consideration. By mid-1929, Hollywood was producing almost exclusively sound films; by the end of the following year, the same was true in much of Western Europe. Jolson went on to make a series of movies for Warners, including &quot;The Singing Fool&quot;, a part-talkie, and the all-talking features &quot;Say It with Songs&quot; (1929), &quot;Mammy&quot; (1930), and &quot;Big Boy&quot; (1930).

==Critical analysis==
Jack Robin&#x27;s use of blackface in his Broadway stage act—a common practice at the time, which is now widely condemned as racist—is the primary focus of many &quot;Jazz Singer&quot; studies. Its crucial and unusual role is described by scholar Corin Willis:

In contrast to the racial jokes and innuendo brought out in its subsequent persistence in early sound film, blackface imagery in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; is at the core of the film&#x27;s central theme, an expressive and artistic exploration of the notion of duplicity and ethnic hybridity within American identity. Of the more than seventy examples of blackface in early sound film 1927–53 that I have viewed (including the nine blackface appearances Jolson subsequently made), &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; is unique in that it is the only film where blackface is central to the narrative development and thematic expression.

The function and meaning of blackface in the film is intimately involved with Jack&#x27;s own Jewish heritage and his desire to make his mark in mass American culture—much as the ethnically Jewish Jolson and the Warner brothers were doing themselves. Jack Robin &quot;compounds both tradition and stardom. The Warner Brothers thesis is that, really to succeed, a man must first acknowledge his ethnic self,&quot; argues W. T. Lhamon. &quot;[T]he whole film builds toward the blacking-up scene at the dress rehearsal. Jack Robin needs the blackface mask as the agency of his compounded identity. Blackface will hold all the identities together without freezing them in a singular relationship or replacing their parts.&quot;

Seymour Stark&#x27;s view is less sanguine. In describing Jolson&#x27;s extensive experience performing in blackface in stage musicals, he asserts, &quot;The immigrant Jew as Broadway star...works within a blackface minstrel tradition that obscures his Jewish pedigree, but proclaims his white identity. Jolson&#x27;s slight Yiddish accent was hidden by a Southern veneer.&quot; Arguing that &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; actually avoids honestly dealing with the tension between American assimilation and Jewish identity, he claims that its &quot;covert message...is that the symbol of blackface provides the Jewish immigrant with the same rights and privileges accorded to earlier generations of European immigrants initiated into the rituals of the minstrel show.&quot;

Lisa Silberman Brenner contradicts this view. She returns to the intentions expressed by Samson Raphaelson, on whose play the film&#x27;s script was closely based: &quot;For Raphaelson, jazz is prayer, American style, and the blackface minstrel the new Jewish cantor. Based on the author&#x27;s own words, the play is about blackface as a means for Jews to express a new kind of Jewishness, that of the modern American Jew.&quot; She observes that during the same period, the Jewish press was noting with pride that Jewish performers were adopting aspects of African American music.

According to Scott Eyman, the film &quot;marks one of the few times Hollywood Jews allowed themselves to contemplate their own central cultural myth, and the conundrums that go with it. &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; implicitly celebrates the ambition and drive needed to escape the &quot;shtetls&quot; of Europe and the ghettos of New York City, and the attendant hunger for recognition. Jack, Sam, and Harry [Warner] let Jack Robin have it all: the satisfaction of taking his father&#x27;s place &quot;and&quot; of conquering the Winter Garden. They were, perhaps unwittingly, dramatizing some of their own ambivalence about the debt first-generation Americans owed their parents.&quot;

==Legacy==
Three subsequent screen versions of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; have been produced: a 1952 remake, starring Danny Thomas and Peggy Lee; a 1959 television remake, starring Jerry Lewis; and a 1980 remake starring Neil Diamond, Lucie Arnaz, and Laurence Olivier. &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was adapted as a one-hour radio play on two broadcasts of Lux Radio Theatre, both starring Al Jolson, reprising his screen role. The first aired August 10, 1936; the second, also starring Gail Patrick, on June 2, 1947.

Disney made reference to the film, and its follow-up &quot;The Singing Fool&quot;, in the title of the 1929 Mickey Mouse short, &quot;The Jazz Fool&quot;.
&quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was parodied in the 1936 Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;I Love to Singa&quot;, directed by Tex Avery. Its hero is &quot;Owl Jolson&quot;, a young owl who croons popular ditties, such as the title song, against the wishes of his father, a classical music teacher. Among the many references to &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; in popular culture, perhaps the most significant is that of the MGM musical &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952). The story, set in 1927, revolves around efforts to change a silent film production, &quot;The Dueling Cavalier&quot;, into a talking picture in response to &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;″s success. At one point Donald O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s character suggests a new name for the now-musical, &quot;I&#x27;ve got it! &#x27;The Dueling Mammy&#x27;.&quot; The plot of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot; (1991) parallels the tale of Jakie Rabinowitz/Jack Robin. Krusty the Clown&#x27;s rabbi father disapproves of his son&#x27;s choice to be a comedian, telling him, &quot;You have brought shame on our family! Oh, if you were a musician or a jazz singer, this I could forgive.&quot;

According to film historian Krin Gabbard, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; &quot;provides the basic narrative for the lives of jazz and popular musicians in the movies. If this argument means that sometime after 1959 the narrative must belong to pop rockers, it only proves the power of the original 1927 film to determine how Hollywood tells the stories of popular musicians.&quot; More broadly, he also suggests that this &quot;seemingly unique film&quot; has &quot;become a paradigm for American success stories.&quot; More specifically, he examines a cycle of biopics of white jazz musicians stretching from &quot;Birth of the Blues&quot; (1941) to &quot;The Five Pennies&quot; (1959) that trace their roots to &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;.

In 1996, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot; motion pictures. In 1998, the film was chosen in voting conducted by the American Film Institute as one of the best American films of all time, ranking at number ninety. In 2007, a three-disc deluxe DVD edition of the film was released. The supplemental material includes Jolson&#x27;s Vitaphone short, &quot;A Plantation Act&quot; (1926).

The phrase said by Al Jolson, &quot;Wait a minute, wait a minute. You ain&#x27;t heard nothin&#x27; yet!&quot; was voted as the 71st best quote by the American Film Institute.

<text>Dos Hermanas (, &quot;two sisters&quot;) is a Spanish town south of Seville in Andalusia, with a population of 131,317 as of 2015.

== History ==

The town’s name, which means &quot;two sisters&quot;, dates from its founding in 1248 by King Ferdinand III of Castile and honours Elvira and Estefanía Nazareno, the two sisters of Gonzalo Nazareno, one of the king&#x27;s principal military commanders. For this reason natives of Dos Hermanas are called &quot;nazarenos/as&quot;.

In Tirso de Molina&#x27;s play &quot;The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest&quot; (&quot;El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra&quot;) (1612-1620), Dos Hermanas is mentioned as the place where Don Juan Tenorio manages to interpose himself in the marriage of two plebeians, Arminta and Batricio, whom he cleverly deceives. &quot;The Trickster of Seville and Stone Guest&quot; is the play from which the myth of &quot;Don Juan&quot; derives the name.

== Economy ==

The main economic activities of the city today are the production and distribution of olive oil and &quot;Spanish olives&quot;, together with a significant number of service industries.

== Transmitter ==

At Dos Hermanas, south of Los Palacios ( geographical coordinates: ), there is a powerful broadcasting mediumwave facility with a 232 metre tall guyed mast, used for the transmission of the first program of RNE with 300 kW on 684 kHz. The transmitter, which is most often designated as &quot;RNE-1 Sevilla&quot; can be received easily at night throughout Europe and northern Africa.

== Notable people ==

The members of Spanish lounge music duo Los del Río (known for their song &quot;Macarena&quot;) are natives of Dos Hermanas and still reside in the city.

Spanish popstar Melody comes from Dos Hermanas. In 2014 a controversy was sparked when an interviewer for Cuatro TV asked her how come she spoke so well &#x27;in spite of coming from Dos Hermanas&#x27;. This sparked a large debate on classism and Madrid-centric snobbery.

== Sports ==

Its football club, Dos Hermanas CF, was founded in 1971. It plays in the Primera Andaluza, the highest league in the region. It has had four spells playing in national leagues, including the third tier, the Segunda B, between 1999 and 2002. It returned to regional football in 2010.

Between 1989 and 2008 Dos Hermanas hosted a strong .

<text>A workstation is a special computer designed for technical or scientific applications. Intended primarily to be used by a single user, they are commonly connected to a local area network and run multi-user operating systems. The term &quot;workstation&quot; has been used loosely to refer to everything from a mainframe computer terminal to a PC connected to a network, but the most common form refers to the class of hardware offered by several current and defunct companies such as Sun Microsystems, Silicon Graphics, Apollo Computer, DEC, HP, NeXT, and IBM which powered the 3D computer graphics revolution of the late 1990s.

Workstations formerly offered higher performance than mainstream personal computers, especially in CPU, graphics, memory, and multitasking. Workstations are optimized for the visualization and manipulation of different types of complex data such as 3D mechanical design, engineering simulations like computational fluid dynamics, animation, video editing, image editing, medical imaging, image rendering, computational science, generating mathematical plots, and software development. Typically, the form factor is that of a desktop computer, which consists of a high-resolution display, a keyboard, and a mouse at a minimum, but also offers multiple displays, graphics tablets, and 3D mice for manipulating objects and navigating scenes. Workstations were the first segment of the computer market to present advanced accessories, and collaboration tools like videoconferencing.

The increasing capabilities of mainstream PCs since the late 1990s have reduced distinction between the PCs and workstations. Typical 1980s workstations have expensive proprietary hardware and operating systems to categorically distinguish from standardized PCs. From the 1990s and 2000s, IBM&#x27;s RS/6000 and IntelliStation have RISC-based POWER CPUs running AIX, versus its corporate IBM PC Series and consumer Aptiva PCs that have Intel x86 CPUs and usually running Microsoft Windows. However, by the early 2000s, this difference largely disappeared, since workstations use highly commoditized hardware dominated by large PC vendors, such as Dell, HP Inc., and Fujitsu, selling x86-64 systems running Windows or Linux.

==History==


===Origins and development===
Workstations are older than the first personal computer (PC). The first computer that might qualify as a workstation is the IBM 1620, a small scientific computer designed to be used interactively by a single person sitting at the console. It was introduced in 1959. One peculiar feature of the machine is that it lacks any arithmetic circuitry. To perform addition, it requires a memory-resident table of decimal addition rules. This reduced the cost of logic circuitry, enabling IBM to make it inexpensive. The machine is codenamed CADET and was initially rented for $1000 per month.

In 1965, the IBM 1130 scientific computer became the successor to 1620. Both of these systems run Fortran and other languages. They are built into roughly desk-sized cabinets, with console typewriters. They have optional add-on disk drives, printers, and both paper-tape and punched-card I/O.

Early workstations were generally dedicated minicomputers, a multiuser system reserved for one user. For example, the PDP-8 from Digital Equipment Corporation, is regarded as the first commercial minicomputer.

Workstations have historically been more advanced than contemporary PCs, with more powerful CPU architectures, earlier networking, more advanced graphics, more memory, and multitasking with sophisticated operating systems like Unix. Because of their minicomputer heritage, from the start workstations have run professional and expensive software such as CAD and graphics design, as opposed to PCs&#x27; games and text editors. The Lisp machines developed at MIT in the early 1970s pioneered some workstation principles, as high-performance, networked, single-user systems intended for heavily interactive use. Lisp Machines were commercialized beginning 1980 by companies like Symbolics, Lisp Machines, Texas Instruments (the TI Explorer), and Xerox (the Interlisp-D workstations). The first computer designed for a single user, with high-resolution graphics (and so a workstation in the modern sense), is the Alto developed at Xerox PARC in 1973. Other early workstations include the Terak 8510/a (1977), Three Rivers PERQ (1979), and the later Xerox Star (1981).

===1980s rise in popularity===

In the early 1980s, with the advent of 32-bit microprocessors such as the Motorola 68000, several new competitors appeared, including Apollo Computer and Sun Microsystems, with workstations based on 68000 and Unix. Meanwhile, DARPA&#x27;s VLSI Project created several spinoff graphics products, such as the Silicon Graphics 3130. Target markets were differentiated, with Sun and Apollo considered to be network workstations and SGI as graphics workstations. RISC CPUs increased in the mid-1980s, typical of workstation vendors. Competition between RISC vendors lowered CPU prices to as little as $10 per MIPS, much less expensive than the Intel 80386; after large price cuts in 1987 and 1988, a personal workstation suitable for 2D CAD costing to was available from multiple vendors. Mid-range models capable of 3D graphics cost from to , while high-end models overlapping with minicomputers cost from to or more.

By then a &quot;personal workstation&quot; might be a high-end PC like Macintosh II or IBM PS/2 Model 80, low-end workstation, or a hybrid device like the NeXT Computer, all with similar, overlapping specifications. One differentiator between PC and workstation was that the latter was much more likely to have a graphics accelerator with support for a graphics standard like PHIGS or X Window, while the former usually depended on software rendering or proprietary accelerators. The computer animation industry&#x27;s needs typically caused improvements in graphical technology, with CAD using the same improvements later. &quot;BYTE&quot; predicted in 1989 &quot;Soon, the only way we&#x27;ll be able to tell the difference between traditional workstations and PCs will be by the operating system they run&quot;, with the former running Unix and the latter running OS/2, classic Mac OS, and/or Unix. Many workstations by then had some method to run increasingly popular and powerful PC software such as Lotus 1-2-3 or Microsoft Word. The magazine demonstrated that year that an individual could build a workstation with commodity components with specifications comparable to commercially available low-end workstations.

Workstations often featured SCSI or Fibre Channel disk storage systems, high-end 3D accelerators, single or multiple 64-bit processors, large amounts of RAM, and well-designed cooling. Additionally, the companies that make the products tend to have comprehensive repair/replacement plans. As the distinction between workstation and PC fades, however, workstation manufacturers have increasingly employed &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; PC components and graphics solutions rather than proprietary hardware or software. Some &quot;low-cost&quot; workstations are still expensive by PC standards but offer binary compatibility with higher-end workstations and servers made by the same vendor. This allows software development to take place on low-cost (relative to the server) desktop machines.

===Thin clients===
Workstations diversified to the lowest possible price point as opposed to performance, called the thin client or network computer. Dependent upon a network and server, this reduces the machine to having no hard drive, and only the CPU, keyboard, mouse, and screen. Some diskless nodes still run a traditional operating system and perform computations locally, with storage on a remote server. These are intended to reduce the initial system purchase cost, and the total cost of ownership, by reducing the amount of administration required per user.

This approach was first attempted as a replacement for PCs in office productivity applications, with the 3Station by 3Com. In the 1990s, X terminals filled a similar role for technical computing. Sun&#x27;s thin clients include the Sun Ray product line. However, traditional workstations and PCs continued to drop in price and complexity as remote management tools for IT staff became available, undercutting this market.

===3M computer===



A high-end workstation of the early 1980s with the three Ms, or a &quot;3M computer&quot; (coined by Raj Reddy and his colleagues at CMU), has one megabyte of RAM, a megapixel display (roughly 1000×1000 pixels), and one &quot;MegaFLOPS&quot; compute performance (at least one million floating-point operations per second). RFC 782 defines the workstation environment more generally as &quot;hardware and software dedicated to serve a single user&quot;, and that it provisions additional shared resources. This is at least one order of magnitude beyond the capacity of the personal computer of the time. The original 1981 IBM Personal Computer has 16 KB memory, a text-only display, and floating-point performance around ( with the optional 8087 math coprocessor. Other features beyond the typical personal computer include networking, graphics acceleration, and high-speed internal and peripheral data buses.

Another goal was to bring the price below one &quot;&quot;, that is, less than , which was achieved in the late 1980s. Throughout the early to mid-1990s, many workstations cost from to or more.

===Decline===
The more widespread adoption of these technologies into mainstream PCs was a direct factor in the decline of the workstation as a separate market segment:

* Reliable components
* High-performance 3D graphics hardware for computer-aided design  (CAD) and computer-generated imagery (CGI) animation is increasingly popular in the PC market around the mid-to-late 1990s mostly driven by computer gaming, yielding the first official GPU in Nvidia&#x27;s NV10 and the breakthrough GeForce 256.
* High-performance CPUs: the first RISC of the early 1980s offer roughly one order of magnitude in performance improvement over CISC processors of comparable cost. Intel&#x27;s x86 CISC family always had the edge in market share and the economies of scale that this implied. By the mid-1990s, some CISC processors like the Motorola 68040 and Intel&#x27;s 80486 and Pentium have performance parity with RISC in some areas, such as integer performance (at the cost of greater chip complexity) and hardware floating-point calculations, relegating RISC to even more high-end markets.
* Hardware support for floating-point operations: optional on the original IBM PC; remained on a separate chip for Intel systems until the 80486DX processor. Even then, x86 floating-point performance lags other processors due to limitations in its architecture. Today even low-price PCs now have performance in the gigaFLOPS range.
* High-performance/high-capacity data storage: early workstations tend to use proprietary disk interfaces until the SCSI standard of the mid-1980s. Although SCSI interfaces soon became available for IBM PCs, they were comparatively expensive and tend to be limited by the speed of the PC&#x27;s ISA peripheral bus. SCSI is an advanced controller interface good for multitasking and daisy chaining. This makes it suited for use in servers, and its benefits to desktop PCs which mostly run single-user operating systems are less clear, but it is standard on the 1980s-1990s Macintosh. Serial ATA is more modern, with throughput comparable to SCSI but at a lower cost.
* High-speed networking (10 Mbit/s or better): 10 Mbit/s network interfaces were commonly available for PCs by the early 1990s, although by that time workstations were pursuing even higher networking speeds, moving to 100 Mbit/s, 1 Gbit/s, and 10 Gbit/s. However, economies of scale and the demand for high-speed networking in even non-technical areas have dramatically decreased the time it takes for newer networking technologies to reach commodity price points.
* Large displays (17- to 21-inch) with high resolutions and high refresh rates for graphics and CAD work, which were rare among PCs in the late 1980s and early 1990s but became common among PCs by the late 1990s.
* Large memory configurations: PCs (such as IBM clones) are originally limited to 640  KB of RAM until the 1982 introduction of the 80286 processor; early workstations have megabytes of memory. IBM clones require special programming techniques to address more than 640 KB until the 80386, as opposed to other 32-bit processors such as SPARC which provide straightforward access to nearly their entire 4  GB memory address range. 64-bit workstations and servers supporting an address range far beyond 4  GB have been available since the early 1990s, a technology just beginning to appear in the PC desktop and server market in the mid-2000s.
* Operating system: early workstations ran the Unix operating system (OS), a Unix-like variant, or an unrelated equivalent OS such as VMS. The PC CPUs of the time have limitations in memory capacity and memory access protection, making them unsuitable to run OSes of this sophistication, but this, too, began to change in the late 1980s as PCs with the 32-bit 80386 with integrated paged MMUs became widely affordable and enabling OS/2, Windows NT 3.1, and Unix-like systems based on BSD and Linux on commodity PC hardware.
* Tight integration between the OS and the hardware: Workstation vendors both design the hardware and maintain the Unix operating system variant that runs on it. This allows for much more rigorous testing than is possible with an operating system such as Windows. Windows requires that third-party hardware vendors write compliant hardware drivers that are stable and reliable. Also, minor variations in hardware quality such as timing or build quality can affect the reliability of the overall machine. Workstation vendors are able to ensure both the quality of the hardware, and the stability of the operating system drivers by validating these things in-house, and this leads to a generally much more reliable and stable machine.

===Market position===

Since the late 1990s, the workstation and consumer markets have further merged. Many low-end workstation components are now the same as the consumer market, and the price differential narrowed. For example, most Macintosh Quadra computers were originally intended for scientific or design work, all with the Motorola 68040 CPU, backward compatible with 68000 Macintoshes. The consumer Macintosh IIcx and Macintosh IIci models can be upgraded to the Quadra 700. &quot;In an era when many professionals preferred Silicon Graphics workstations, the Quadra 700 was an intriguing option at a fraction of the cost&quot; as resource-intensive software such as Infini-D brought &quot;studio-quality 3D rendering and animations to the home desktop&quot;. The Quadra 700 can run A/UX 3.0, making it a Unix workstation. Another example is the Nvidia GeForce 256 consumer graphics card, which spawned the Quadro workstation card, which has the same GPU but different driver support and certifications for CAD applications and a much higher price.

Workstations have typically driven advancements in CPU technology. All computers benefit from multi-processor and multicore designs (essentially, multiple processors on a die). The multicore design was pioneered by IBM&#x27;s POWER4; it and Intel Xeon have multiple CPUs, more on-die cache, and ECC memory.

Some workstations are designed or certified for use with only one specific application such as AutoCAD, Avid Xpress Studio HD, or 3D Studio Max. The certification process increases workstation prices.

==Modern market==

===GPU workstations===
Modern workstations are typically desktop computers with AMD or NVIDIA GPUs to do high-performance computing on software programs such as video editing, 3D modeling, computer-aided design, and rendering.

===Decline of RISC workstations===
By January 2009, all RISC-based workstation product lines had been discontinued:
* Hewlett-Packard withdrew its last HP 9000 PA-RISC-based desktop products from the market in January 2008.
* IBM retired the IntelliStation POWER on January 2, 2009.
* SGI ended general availability of its MIPS-based SGI Fuel and SGI Tezro workstations in December 2006.
* Sun Microsystems announced end-of-life for its last Sun Ultra SPARC workstations in October 2008.

In early 2018, RISC workstations were reintroduced in a series of IBM POWER9-based systems by Raptor Computing Systems. In October of 2024 System 76 introduces The Thelio Astra an Arm workstation aim for autonomous car industry.

===x86-64===
Most of the current workstation market uses x86-64 microprocessors. Operating systems include Windows, FreeBSD, Linux distributions, macOS, and Solaris. Some vendors also market commodity mono-socket systems as workstations.

These are three types of workstations:
# Workstation blade systems (IBM HC10 or Hewlett-Packard xw460c. Sun Visualization System is akin to these solutions)
# Ultra high-end workstation (SGI Virtu VS3xx)
# Deskside systems containing server-class CPUs and chipsets on large server-class motherboards with high-end RAM (HP Z-series workstations and Fujitsu CELSIUS workstations)

===Definition===
A high-end desktop market segment includes workstations, with PC operating systems and components. Component product lines may be segmented, with premium components that are functionally similar to the consumer models but with higher robustness or performance.

A workstation-class PC may have some of the following features:
* Larger number of memory sockets which use DIMM slots or registered (buffered) modules
* Multiple displays
* Reliable high-performance graphics card
* Multiple processor sockets, powerful CPUs
* Run reliable operating system with advanced features
* Support for ECC memory
* M.2 or PCI-E NVMe SSD

<text>Thomas Edward Tolan (September 29, 1908 – January 30, 1967), nicknamed the &quot;Midnight Express&quot;, was an American track and field athlete who competed in sprints. He set world records in the 100-yard dash and 100 meters event and Olympic records in the 100 meters and 200 meters events. He was the first non-Euro-American to receive the title of the &quot;world&#x27;s fastest human&quot; after winning gold medals in the 100 and 200 meters events at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In March 1935, Tolan won the 75, 100 and 220-yard events at the World Professional Sprint Championships in Melbourne to become the first man to win both the amateur and professional world sprint championships. In his full career as a sprinter, Tolan won 300 races and lost only 7.

==Early years==
Tolan was born in Denver, Colorado, one of four children. Tolan&#x27;s father was Thomas Tolan. The family moved to Salt Lake City, Utah when Tolan was young, and moved again to Detroit, Michigan in 1924, when Tolan was 15 years old. Tolan later recalled, &quot;My father read about better opportunities for Negroes here, so he packed up Mom and the four kids and we came here.&quot;

==Cass Tech High School==
Tolan attended Cass Technical High School in Detroit where he was an outstanding football player and sprinter. While at Cass Tech, Tolan set state records in the 100 and 220-yard dashes. While still in high school, Tolan ran the 100-yard dash in 9.8 seconds and the 220-yard dash in 21.5 seconds. Aged 16, Tolan was a member of a two-man team from Cass Tech that won the 1925 National Interscholastic indoor meet in Chicago. He won his first sprint double at the state meet as a sophomore, and in 1927 he won the 100 and 220-yard dashes at the National Interscholastic Championship at Soldier Field in Chicago. Despite his accomplishments as a sprinter, Tolan&#x27;s first love was football, and he often said &quot;the six touchdowns he scored in one game as a 131-pound quarterback at Detroit&#x27;s Cass Tech High School was his greatest thrill, rather than his double win in the Olympics.&quot;

==University of Michigan==

===Football===
Tolan was recruited by several major universities as a football player, but he chose the University of Michigan. There are differing accounts as to why Tolan never played on the varsity football team at Michigan. According to a published account in The Detroit News in 2002, Tolan joined the freshman football team as a freshman in 1927. At that time, no African-American had played on Michigan&#x27;s varsity football team since George Jewett in the 1890s. Tolan was initially allowed to play, but on the third day of practice, the freshman football coach told him, &quot;Some of the coaches are disagreeing on your chances. Some of them think that you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to play football. I&#x27;d be tickled to have you but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to be outvoted.&quot; &quot;The Detroit News&quot; noted, that the freshman coach was outvoted: &quot;They took away Eddie Tolan&#x27;s football uniform and handed him a track suit in exchange.&quot;

Other accounts indicate, it was an injury that prevented Tolan from playing football at Michigan. An Associated Press story on Tolan in 1958 stated: &quot;He would have been a football great as a quarterback, had a knee injury in his junior year in high school not forced him to channel all his energies to track.&quot; In his obituary, the Associated Press reported that the coaches at Michigan &quot;talked the pint-sized speedster into going out for track.&quot; Tolan was also quoted as saying, &quot;The track team did a lot more traveling then, so I saw the opportunity to travel on a Pullman and see the country.&quot;

===Big Ten and world sprint champion===

At Michigan, Tolan ran track under the mentorship of two of the great sprinters of their generations. Michigan&#x27;s head coach, Steve Farrell, was considered &quot;the greatest professional footracer this country has ever known&quot; in the 1880s and 1890s. And Michigan&#x27;s assistant coach Charles B. Hoyt, who took over from Farrell in 1930, was rated &quot;America&#x27;s best sprinter&quot; in 1913, but lost his opportunity to compete in the 1916 Olympics due to World War I. Coaches at Michigan weren&#x27;t supportive in the face of racism Tolan faced while traveling, and even told him he&#x27;d be the last black athlete on the team if he complained.

As a sophomore in May 1929, Tolan broke the Big Ten Conference record and tied the world&#x27;s record for the 100 yard dash with a time of 9.6. Press coverage starting with this world record run, and throughout his career, focused on three features – Tolan&#x27;s race, his eyeglasses, and his short stocky build. Tolan was one of the first African-Americans to have success in sprinting, and he raced with eyeglasses taped to his head. Various accounts put his height anywhere from 5 feet, 4 inches, to 5 feet, 7 inches. One writer noted that Tolan &quot;looks like a church deacon.&quot; Another writer described Tolan&#x27;s appearance this way:

Tolan, known as the &#x27;Midnight Express,&#x27; was tall and weighed . He smiled often, raced while chewing gum, and could be easily identified by a bandage around his left knee to protect an old football injury. In addition he wore horn-rimmed glasses held in place with adhesive tape.

Tolan&#x27;s gum-chewing became part of his routine. He chewed gum before a race to relieve stress. After accidentally running with the gum in his mouth, Tolan found that he was chewing in sync with his stride. Tolan later began chewing gum as part of his routine, chewing the gum faster when he needed to accelerate his leg movements.

At the Big Ten championships in May 1930, Tolan broke the world&#x27;s record in the 100-yard dash with a time of 9.5. Tolan&#x27;s performance was accepted by the International Amateur Athletic Federation as the new official world&#x27;s record.

Seven weeks after breaking the world&#x27;s record in the 100-yard dash, Tolan also broke the world&#x27;s record in the 100 meters race. Competing in Vancouver, British Columbia, Tolan shaved two-tenths of a second off the record with a time of 10-1/5 seconds. Track officials in Vancouver announced after the race, that Tolan&#x27;s record-setting performance was &quot;all the more remarkable in the fact that he ran uphill, the finish mark being thirty inches higher than the starting point.&quot;

Tolan&#x27;s world-record performances in 1930 brought him international fame, as he became known as the &quot;Midnight Express.&quot; In May 1931, Tolan again broke the world&#x27;s record in the 100 meters event with a time of 10.3 seconds in Vancouver. Southern California sprinter Frank Wykoff jumped to a slight lead, but Tolan came from behind to pass Wykoff at the 100-yard mark.

Tolan graduated from the University of Michigan in 1931.

==Double gold medals at the 1932 Summer Olympics==

===Lead-up to the Olympics===

After graduating from Michigan, Tolan enrolled at West Virginia State College, where he did &quot;graduate work preparatory to teaching and coaching at a Negro institution.&quot; Early in 1932, Tolan was not running at his prior level. Despite the slow start, Dean Cromwell, Chairman of the All American Board of Track and Field, predicted great things for Tolan in his column on 1932&#x27;s &quot;Olympic Prospects.&quot; Cromwell wrote of Tolan:

Just as spring warms into summer Tolan slides from the class of mediocre sprinters to that of the champions. He is a slow starter, but when the weather gets warm so does Eddie, and off he goes.

While press reports regularly referred to Tolan as &quot;stocky,&quot; Cromwell took issue with that characterization:

Eddie is now 24 years of age, five feet six inches tall and weights about 130 pounds. Although he has always been termed &#x27;stocky&#x27; by the press, a comparison of his weight and height will show that he cannot properly be so styled. He is well muscled, though, and in action gives the impression of great running power, with his arms and legs working smoothly and strongly in a machine piston-like manner.

The Olympic trials were held at Stanford University, and Ralph Metcalfe won both the 100 and 200 meters finals, with Tolan finishing second to Metcalfe in each case. The results meant that the top two American sprinters in the 1932 Olympics would for the first time be African-Americans. As a result, much of the press attention focused on race. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; sports columnist Braven Dyer wrote: &quot;Metcalfe and Tolan make the ace of spades look positively pale by comparison … But how these boys can run … And they figure to do even better here than they did at Palo Alto because it&#x27;s warmer now and they enjoy the heat.&quot;

===100 meters race===
The 100 meters contest at the 1932 Olympics was one of the closest races in Olympic history. Tolan broke the Olympic record in the first heat of the second round with a time of 10.4 seconds, but Metcalfe remained the favorite. In the finals, Japanese sprinter Takayoshi Yoshioka jumped out to a four-yard lead after 40 meters. Tolan passed Yoshioka at the 60 meter mark and had a two-yard lead over Metcalfe at the 100-yard mark. But Metcalfe passed Tolan at the tape and appeared to the crowd to be the winner. Sports writer Maxwell Stiles described the last strides as follows:

His powerful legs churning wildly, Metcalfe swept down upon little Tolan like an avenging angel full of fury. Tolan, his left knee in an elastic bandage and his glasses taped to his head near his ears, dug in for one last desperate stride in his effort to hold the lead. Just at the tape, Metcalfe rushed past Tolan and was well ahead a yard beyond the finish. Almost everyone thought Metcalfe had won.

It was hours later, after review of films taken with a &quot;Kirby two-eyed camera,&quot; that officials were able to declare Tolan the winner with a time of 10.3 seconds. The films showed that Tolan and Metcalfe hit the finish line in a dead heat, but Tolan was declared the winner, because he had his entire torso past the line on the ground before Metcalfe.

===200 meters race===

The 200 meters race was held on the fourth day of competition, and this time the race was not close, as Tolan beat Metcalfe easily with an Olympic record time of 21.2 seconds – four-tenths of a second better than the prior record of 21.6 seconds. Tolan stumbled slightly with three yards to go, but righted himself and finished with a four-foot lead. With double wins in the 100 and 200 meters contests, Tolan was dubbed the &quot;world&#x27;s fastest human.&quot; Tolan was the first African-American to have that distinction, and press coverage of his Olympic wins focused on his race. The Associated Press called him the &quot;spectacled little American Negro&quot; and &quot;the dusky little thunderbolt.&quot; Braven Dyer referred to him as &quot;the stubby colored boy,&quot; and noted that &quot;the chunky Detroit Negro&quot; had defeated Arthur Jonath of Germany, &quot;the white-skinned Teuton.&quot; Another writer described how the &quot;little black man with horn-rimmed glasses&quot; crossed the finish line, being chased by &quot;a white man of America, George Simpson,&quot; and &quot;a brother black, Ralph Metcalfe.&quot;

Commentators also noted, that the only other two sprinters to win double gold in the 100 and 200 meters races were also University of Michigan athletes, Ralph Craig and Archie Hahn.

===Reaction to Tolan&#x27;s Accomplishments===
After the sprint competition concluded, a reporter interviewed Tolan and Metcalfe in their shared room at the Olympic Village. When Metcalfe teased Tolan for being lucky, Tolan replied, &quot;Yeah, I had it all right – but it&#x27;s &#x27;bout time, Ralph; first little ol&#x27; luck I had in eight years!&quot; Still in bed at noon wearing pajamas and with a stocking cap on his head, Tolan said he was &quot;in the best condition of my life when the 200 meters final started,&quot; and he vowed to give his gold medals to his mother.

Back in Detroit, Mayor Frank Murphy appointed a reception committee to meet Tolan at the train station, and Michigan Governor Wilber M. Brucker declared September 6, 1932 as &quot;Eddie Tolan Day&quot; throughout the state. The governor issued a proclamation stating that Tolan had &quot;brought honor to our commonwealth&quot; and encouraging communities throughout the state to arrange ceremonies &quot;as an expression of Michigan&#x27;s pride in his achievement.&quot;

Tolan&#x27;s mother noted, that she was proud of her son&#x27;s accomplishments. She noted that, though she had worked hard as the sole provider for the family, it was worth it. She added, &quot;If my menfolk could only find jobs I could ease up a bit and a mighty big worry would be off Eddie&#x27;s mind.&quot;

In April 1936, Tolan, along with many other sports champions and stand outs, were honored at a banquet in Detroit, MI. This Banquet was the first celebration of Champions Day.

==Vaudeville and hard times==

Less than six months after winning Olympic gold medals and the title of the &quot;world&#x27;s fastest human,&quot; Tolan garnered national press when he fell on hard times. Syndicated columnist William H. Beatty wrote that &quot;the heady wine of victory has turned overnight to vinegar&quot; for Tolan. Tolan noted that, when he was met at the train station by a welcoming committee, his half-brother was collecting waste paper in the grass of the park in front of the train station. Tolan noted that his half-brother was &quot;luckier than I am,&quot; because he had a job. His parents had both been unemployed for many months, and it was not until January 1933 that Tolan was able to get a low-paying job as a filing clerk in a county office. Tolan&#x27;s lifetime dream of becoming a physician was waning, as he had been &quot;unable to make enough to support himself and his parents.&quot;

Desperate to earn a living, Tolan &quot;walked the streets of many cities, seeking work,&quot; and even briefly appeared in vaudeville in 1932 with Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson. They made a good team; Tolan had set world records for running forwards, and Robinson had set world&#x27;s records for running backwards: 50 yards backward sprint (6 seconds), 75 yards backwards sprint (8.2 seconds), and 100 yards backwards sprint (13.2 seconds).

Because of his brief appearance in vaudeville, the Michigan Amateur Athletic Association stripped Tolan of his amateur status in June 1933. And in April 1934, Tolan&#x27;s bad luck continued as an automobile he was driving struck and seriously injured an 80-year-old pedestrian.

==Professional sprinting career==
In November 1934, Tolan took a leave of absence from his job as assistant county registrar of deeds to compete in the Australian sprint program, a series of five professional races, including the Stawell Gift handicap. Tolan returned in April 1935 after having set new Australian records of 21.5 seconds in the 220-yard dash on a full curve track and 7.5 seconds for the 75-yard dash. He won the 75, 100, and 220-yard events at the World Professional Sprint Championships in March 1935 in Melbourne, and became the first man to win both the amateur and professional world sprint championships.

In his full career as a sprinter, Tolan won 300 races and lost only 7. Throughout his career as a sprinter, Tolan worked by a simple creed: &quot;Start fast, run easily, stay in your lane and finish strong.&quot;

==Civil service and teaching career==
After returning from Australia, Tolan returned to his job in Detroit as a clerk to the Register of Deeds. Tolan worked at a variety of jobs in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1956, Tolan became a school teacher in physical and health education. He taught at the Irving Elementary School on Detroit&#x27;s West Side for several years.

==Death and family==
Tolan never married. In 1965, Tolan&#x27;s kidneys failed, and he was required to undergo weekly dialysis treatments for the rest of his life. In 1967, Tolan died from heart failure at age 58 at Detroit&#x27;s Mt. Carmel Hospital, while undergoing one of his weekly treatments. At the time of his death, Jesse Owens paid him tribute in &quot;Jet&quot; magazine:

When I was in high school, Eddie and Ralph (Metcalfe) were my idols. Eddie and I later became close friends. I used to live in Detroit and every time I&#x27;d go back Eddie was one of the first ones I&#x27;d look up.

Tolan was survived by his sisters, June Brown and Martha Lombard, and a brother, Hart H. Tolan. Though the two never met, Tolan was also a cousin of former Major League Baseball player Bobby Tolan. Eddie Tolan is interred at United Memorial Gardens in Plymouth, Michigan.

==Honors and awards==
In 1958, Tolan was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. He was one of the first 18 persons inducted. He was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1980. Only 17 individuals were inducted into the Hall before Tolan.

Tolan was one of many athletes honored in 1936 for Champions Day in Detroit, Michigan.

Tolan was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

Eddie Tolan was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1982.

<doc id="68187" wikidata="Q7156" url="?curid=68187" title="FC Barcelona">
<text>Futbol Club Barcelona (), commonly known as FC Barcelona and colloquially as Barça (), is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football.

Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto &quot;Més que un club&quot; (&quot;More than a club&quot;). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable football club in the world, worth $5.6 billion, and the world&#x27;s fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €800.1 million. The official Barcelona anthem is the &quot;Cant del Barça&quot;, written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs. Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed &quot;Blaugrana&quot;.

Barcelona are one of the world&#x27;s most decorated clubs. Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 78 trophies: 27 La Liga, 31 , 15 Supercopa de España, 3 Copa Eva Duarte, and 2 Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, the club has won 22 European and worldwide titles: five UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cups, five UEFA Super Cups, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups. Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2015, and occupies the ninth position on the UEFA club rankings . The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as &quot;El Clásico&quot;.

Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social media followings in the world among sports teams. Barcelona players have won a joint record twelve Ballon d&#x27;Or awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record six FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners including Romário, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi. In 2010, three players who came through the club&#x27;s youth academy—Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi—were chosen as the three best players in the world in the Ballon d&#x27;Or ranking, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football academy. Additionally, players representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe awards.

Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first European football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup. In 2011, the club became European champions again, winning five trophies. This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time. By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in 2015 under Luis Enrique, Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.

== History ==

=== 1899–1922: Beginnings ===

On 22 October 1899, Swiss Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in &quot;Los Deportes&quot; declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the &quot;Gimnasio Solé&quot; on 29 November. Eleven players attended – Walter Wild (the first president of the club), Luis de Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and formed Foot-Ball Club Barcelona.

FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the . In 1901, the club participated in the first football competition played on the Iberian Peninsula, the Copa Macaya, narrowly losing to Hispania AC, but in the following year, Barça won the tournament, the club&#x27;s first-ever piece of silverware, and then participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to Bizcaya (a combination of players from Athletic Club and Bilbao FC) in the final. In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president, attempting to prevent Barcelona from shutting down. The club was struggling financially and socially, as well as in performance. They had not won a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, &quot;Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on.&quot; He was club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, spending a total of 25 years in the role. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquired its own stadium and thus generated a stable income.

On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Indústria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, the club conducted a logo contest the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears – with some minor changes – as of the present day.

The stadium is regarded as the main element that helped the club grow in the 1910s and become a dominant team, winning three successive Campionats de Catalunya between 1909 and 1911, three Copa del del Rey in four years between 1910 and 1913, and four successive Pyrenees Cup between the inaugural year in 1910 and 1913. The Pyrenees Cup was one of the earliest international club cups in Europe. It consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, Midi and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia, all former members of the Marca Hispanica region. The contest was the most prestigious in that era. Notable figures of Barça&#x27;s first great team include Carles Comamala, Alfredo Massana, Amechazurra, Paco Bru, and Jack Greenwell. The latter became the club&#x27;s first full-time coach in 1917.

During the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club&#x27;s collective identity. On 4 February 1917, the club held its first tribute match to honour Ramón Torralba, who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa where Barcelona won the match 6–2.

Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club members, and by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year. Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 30,000, and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000.

In 1912, Gamper recruited Paulino Alcántara, the club&#x27;s seventh all-time top-scorer. In 1917, Gamper also recruited Jack Greenwell as Barcelona&#x27;s first full-time manager. After this hiring, the club&#x27;s fortunes began to improve on the field and soon enjoyed its first &quot;golden age&quot;. Along with Alcántara, the Barça team under Greenwell also included Sagibarba, Ricardo Zamora, Josep Samitier, Félix Sesúmaga, and Franz Platko. This team won 9 out of 10 Campionats de Catalunya between 1919 and 1928 and two Copa del Rey titles in 1920 and 1922. In total, during the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campionats de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups.

=== 1923–1931: Primo de Rivera, and first golden age ===
On 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera&#x27;s dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club. This coincided with the club&#x27;s transition to professional football. The first time the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed to operate a professional football club was in 1926.
On 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his aeroplane. In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled &quot;Oda a Platko&quot;, which was written by a member of the Generation of &#x27;27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko. On 23 June 1929, Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League. A year after winning the championship, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.

=== 1931–1939: Republic, and Civil War: Assassination of President Sunyol ===
Although they continued to have players of the standing of Josep Escolà, the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters. Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936, and 1938, they did not win at a national level in this time, with the exception of their 1937 disputed title in the Mediterranean League.

A month after the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao. On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party. He was dubbed the martyr of &quot;barcelonisme&quot;, and his assassination was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity. In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.

On 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the Italian Air Force, causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the club&#x27;s offices. A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation, and as a symbol of the &quot;undisciplined&quot; Catalanism, the club, now down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The Catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to &quot;Club de Fútbol Barcelona&quot; and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest.

=== 1940–1957: Post-war, and start of Franco&#x27;s regime ===

In 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del Generalísimo (now the Copa del Rey). The first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3–0. Real Madrid comfortably won the second leg, beating Barcelona 11–1. According to football writer Sid Lowe, &quot;There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona&#x27;s history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.&quot; It has been alleged by local journalist Paco Aguilar that Barcelona&#x27;s players were threatened by police in the changing room, though nothing was ever proven.

Despite the difficult political situation, &quot;CF Barcelona&quot; enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as coach and players like César, Ramallets and Velasco, they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949. In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina. In June 1950, Barcelona signed László Kubala, who was to be an important figure at the club.

On a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the Francoist authorities. A tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, and it received the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia. Many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.

Coach Ferdinand Daučík and László Kubala led the team to five different trophies in 1952. These were La Liga, the Copa del Generalísimo, the Copa Latina, the Copa Eva Duarte, and the Copa Martini &amp; Rossi. In 1953, the club won La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo again.

=== 1957–1978: Club de Fútbol Barcelona ===
With Helenio Herrera as coach, a young Luis Suárez, the European Footballer of the Year in 1960, and two Hungarians recommended by Kubala, Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor, the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960. In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a European Cup play-off. However, they lost 2–3 to Benfica in the final.

The 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players. The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fusté and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona beat Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu in front of dictator Francisco Franco, with coach Salvador Artigas, a former republican pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Franco&#x27;s dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to &quot;Futbol Club Barcelona&quot; and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters.

Johan Cruyff joined in the 1973–74 season. He was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax. Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son &quot;Jordi&quot;, after the local Catalan Saint George. Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973–74 season for the first time since 1960, defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu en route. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d&#x27;Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.

=== 1978–2000: Núñez and stabilization ===
In 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona. Since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain&#x27;s transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco&#x27;s dictatorship. The new president&#x27;s main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency lasted 22 years. It deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.

The club won its first European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup on 16 May 1979, beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 4–3 in Basel. More than 30,000 travelling &quot;blaugrana&quot; fans watched the final. The same year, Núñez began to invest in the club&#x27;s youth programme by converting La Masia into a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth programme of Barcelona.

In June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of £5 million from Boca Juniors. In the following season, under coach César Luis Menotti, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona soon left to join Napoli. At the start of the 1984–85 season, Terry Venables was hired as manager. He won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season, he took the team to their second European Cup final. The team lost on penalties to Steaua București in Seville.

Around this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president Núñez&#x27;s dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois&#x27; ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez&#x27;s presidency. Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.

After the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona signed the English top scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was fired at the beginning of the 1987–88 season and replaced with Luis Aragonés. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1–0 victory in the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.
In 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club, this time as manager. He assembled what would later be dubbed the &quot;Dream Team&quot;. He used Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, José Mari Bakero, Jon Andoni Goikoetxea, Miguel Angel Nadal, and Txiki Begiristain, and signed international players such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Romário, and Hristo Stoichkov.

Ten years after the inception of the youth programme, La Masia, its players began to graduate and play for their first team. Pep Guardiola, the future coach of Barcelona, was one of the first graduates and would go on to receive international recognition.
Under Cruyff&#x27;s guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley, with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de España trophies. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club&#x27;s most successful manager at that point. He also became the club&#x27;s longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years. Cruyff did not win any trophies in his final two seasons, and fell out with president Josep Lluís Núñez, resulting in his departure.

Reacting to Cruyff&#x27;s departure, an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall. The objective of the group, called &quot;L&#x27;Elefant Blau&quot;, was to oppose the presidency of Núñez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club&#x27;s traditional values. Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.

Cruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996–97. He recruited Ronaldo for a world record transfer fee from his previous club, PSV, and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and the Supercopa de España, with Ronaldo registering 47 goals in 49 games. Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available.

Ronaldo soon left for Inter Milan in another world record transfer. However, new heroes emerged, such as Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its &quot;centenari&quot;, winning the Primera División title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000.

=== 2000–2008: Exit Núñez, enter Laporta ===

The departures of Núñez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo&#x27;s decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet&#x27;s head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a first-round Champions League exit, and was dismissed late in the season. Long-serving Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season against Valencia via an exceptional performance from Rivaldo, who completed arguably the greatest hat-trick in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification.

Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club&#x27;s history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal&#x27;s resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić&#x27;s short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club&#x27;s overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.

After the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch and AC Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto&#x27;o, Rafael Márquez and Edgar Davids, combined with home grown Spanish players, such as Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and Víctor Valdés, led to the club&#x27;s return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in 2004–05, and Ronaldinho and Eto&#x27;o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.

In the 2005–06 season, Barcelona repeated their league and Supercopa successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid. It was Rijkaard&#x27;s second victory at the Bernabéu, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho&#x27;s performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona&#x27;s third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation. In the Champions League, Barcelona beat English club Arsenal in the final. Trailing 1–0 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2–1, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Eto&#x27;o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti, for the club&#x27;s first European Cup victory in 14 years.

Despite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006–07 season without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto&#x27;o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto&#x27;o publicly criticised coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form. In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 5–2, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona&#x27;s goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4–0. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional. In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on away goals.

Barcelona finished the 2007–08 season third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League and Copa del Rey, both times losing to the eventual champions, Manchester United and Valencia, respectively. The day after a 4–1 defeat to Real Madrid, Joan Laporta announced that Barcelona B coach Pep Guardiola would take over Frank Rijkaard&#x27;s duties on 30 June 2008.

=== 2008–2012: Guardiola era ===
Barcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard&#x27;s duties at the conclusion of the season. Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi.

Barça beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey final, winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time. A historic 2–6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became 2008–09 La Liga champions. Barça finished the season by beating Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with goals from Eto&#x27;o and Messi, to win their third Champions League title, and complete the first ever treble won by a Spanish team. The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbao and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk, becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup. Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Supercopa de España for a ninth time.

After Laporta&#x27;s departure from the club in June 2010, Sandro Rosell was soon elected as the new president. The elections were held on 13 June, where he received 61.35% (57,088 votes, a record) of total votes. Rosell signed David Villa from Valencia for €40 million and Javier Mascherano from Liverpool for €19 million. At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Barcelona players that had graduated from the club&#x27;s La Masia youth system would play a major role in Spain becoming world champions. On 11 July, seven players who came through the academy participated in the final, six of whom were Barcelona players who started the match, with Iniesta scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands.

In November 2010, Barcelona defeated their main rival Real Madrid 5–0 in &quot;El Clásico&quot;. At the ceremony for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or in December, Barcelona&#x27;s La Masia became the first youth academy ever to have all three finalists for the Ballon d&#x27;Or, with Messi, Iniesta and Xavi being named the three best players in the world for 2010. In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona retained the La Liga trophy, their third title in succession, finishing with 96 points. In April 2011, the club reached the Copa del Rey final, losing 1–0 to Real Madrid at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia. In May, Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League Final 3–1 held at Wembley Stadium, a repeat of the 2009 final, winning their fourth European Cup. In August 2011, La Masia graduate Cesc Fàbregas was bought from Arsenal and he would help Barcelona defend the Spanish Supercup against Real Madrid. The Supercup victory brought the total number of official trophies to 73, matching the number of titles won by Real Madrid.

Later the same month, Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup defeating Porto 2–0 with goals from Messi and Fàbregas. This extended the club&#x27;s overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing Real Madrid&#x27;s total amount of official trophies. The Super Cup victory also saw Guardiola win his 12th trophy out of a possible 15 in his three years at the helm of the club, becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona.
In December, Barcelona won the Club World Cup for a record second time since its establishment, after defeating 2011 Copa Libertadores holders Santos 4–0 in the final thanks to two goals from Messi and goals from Xavi and Fàbregas. As a result, the overall trophy haul during the reign of Guardiola was further extended and saw Barcelona win their 13th trophy out of a possible 16. Considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time, with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson stating, ”They mesmerise you with their passing”, their five trophies in 2011 saw them receive the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year.

In the 2011–12 season, Barcelona lost the semi-finals of the Champions League against Chelsea. Guardiola, who had been on a rolling contract and had faced criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections, announced that he would step down as manager on 30 June and be succeeded by assistant Tito Vilanova. Guardiola finished his tenure with Barça winning the Copa del Rey final 3–0, bringing the tally to 14 trophies that Barça had won under his coaching.

It was announced in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager. Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2–1 to them at the beginning of March. They reached the semi-final stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it was announced that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.

=== 2014–2020: Bartomeu era ===

On 22 July 2013, Gerardo &quot;Tata&quot; Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013–14 season. Barcelona won the 2013 Supercopa de España 1–1 on away goals. On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of a complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar. Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term.

Barcelona won the treble in the 2014–15 season, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League titles, and became the first European team to have won the treble twice. On 17 May, the club clinched their 23rd La Liga title after defeating Atlético Madrid. This was Barcelona&#x27;s seventh La Liga title in the last ten years. On 30 May, the club defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final at Camp Nou. On 6 June, Barcelona won the 2015 Champions League Final with a 3–1 win against Juventus, which completed the treble, the club&#x27;s second in six years. Barcelona&#x27;s attacking trio of Messi, Suárez and Neymar, dubbed &quot;MSN&quot;, scored 122 goals in all competitions, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history.

On 11 August, Barcelona started the 2015–16 season winning a joint record fifth European Super Cup by beating Sevilla 5–4 in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup. They ended the year with a 3–0 win over Argentine club River Plate in the 2015 Club World Cup final on 20 December to win the trophy for a record third time, with Suárez, Messi and Iniesta the top three players of the tournament. The Club World Cup was Barcelona&#x27;s 20th international title, a record only matched by Egyptian club Al Ahly. By scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions, Barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year, breaking Real Madrid&#x27;s record of 178 goals scored in 2014. On 10 February 2016, qualifying for the sixth Copa del Rey final in the last eight seasons, Luis Enrique&#x27;s Barcelona broke the club&#x27;s record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by Guardiola&#x27;s team in the 2010–11 season, with a 1–1 draw with Valencia in the second leg of the 2015–16 Copa del Rey. With a 5–1 win at Rayo Vallecano on 3 March, Barcelona&#x27;s 35th match unbeaten, the club broke Real Madrid&#x27;s Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions from the 1988–1989 season. After Barça reached 39 matches unbeaten, their run ended on 2 April 2016 with a 2–1 defeat to Real Madrid at Camp Nou. On 14 May 2016, Barcelona won their sixth La Liga title in eight seasons. The front three of Messi, Suárez and Neymar finished the season with 131 goals, breaking the record they had set the previous year for most goals by an attacking trio in a single season.

On 8 March 2017, Barcelona made the largest comeback in Champions League history in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League Round of 16 second Leg, defeating Paris Saint-Germain 6–1 (aggregate score 6–5), despite losing the first leg in France by a score of 4–0. On 29 May 2017, former player Ernesto Valverde was named as Luis Enrique&#x27;s successor. On 20 September 2017, Barcelona issued a statement exercising their stance on the 2017 Catalan referendum saying, &quot;FC Barcelona, in holding the utmost respect for its diverse body of members, will continue to support the will of the majority of Catalan people, and will do so in a civil, peaceful, and exemplary way&quot;. The match against UD Las Palmas on the referendum day was requested to be postponed by the Barcelona board due to heavy violence in Catalonia, but it (the request) was declined by La Liga, therefore being held behind closed doors. Two directors, Jordi Monés and Carles Vilarrubí, handed in their resignations in protest at the game&#x27;s being played. Winning La Liga for the 2017–18 season, on 9 May 2018, Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5–1 to set the longest unbeaten streak (43 games) in La Liga history. On 27 April 2019, Barcelona won their 26th La Liga title. However, the La Liga title was overshadowed by an improbable Champions League exit to Liverpool in the semi-finals, with Barça losing the second leg 0–4 after being up 3–0 after a home victory.

On 13 January 2020, following the loss to Atlético Madrid in the Spanish Supercup, former Real Betis coach Quique Setién replaced Ernesto Valverde as the new head coach of Barcelona. Ultimately Barcelona finished the season trophyless for first time in 12 years. On 17 August, the club confirmed that Setién had been removed from his position as manager with director of football Eric Abidal also dismissed from his position. Two days later, Ronald Koeman was appointed as the new head coach of Barcelona. Rising dissatisfaction among supporters due to worsening finances and decline on the pitch in the previous season led to Josep Maria Bartomeu announcing his resignation as president on 27 October 2020, to avoid facing a vote of no confidence from the club members.

=== 2021–present: Return of Laporta and post-Messi era ===

On 7 March 2021, Joan Laporta was elected president of Barcelona with 54.28% of the vote. Barcelona won their 31st Copa del Rey, their only trophy under Ronald Koeman, after defeating Athletic Bilbao 4–0 in the final. In August 2021 Barcelona found themselves unable to comply with La Liga&#x27;s Financial Fair Play requirements, and revealed a club debt of €1.35bn and a wage bill accounting for 103% of total income. Negotiations with Lionel Messi, now in the final year of his contract, had been ongoing for some time. However, on 5 August 2021, Barcelona announced that they would be unable to re-sign Messi to an extension due to La Liga regulations. This was despite the fact that the club and Messi had reached an agreement over the details of a new contract. Messi departed the club after 21 years as a Barça player, and the club&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer, and signed on a free transfer with French club Paris Saint-Germain. The financial implications also restricted Barcelona in the transfer market and as a result most of the incoming players were either free transfers or loans and they had to reduce players&#x27; wages to register the incoming players.

Poor performances in La Liga and the Champions League led to the sacking of Ronald Koeman on 28 October, with a club legend Xavi replacing him. Xavi could not reverse the fortunes in the Champions League, and Barcelona dropped down to the Europa League for the first time since 2003–04, subsequently exiting in the quarter-finals. In the domestic league, Xavi improved Barça&#x27;s form and guided them from ninth to second, guaranteeing a Champions League spot next season. However, this also meant Barcelona finished trophyless after earlier Supercopa and Copa del Rey exits.

On 15 January 2023, Xavi guided Barcelona to their first trophy since the 2021 Copa del Rey, as the Catalans defeated Real Madrid 3–1 in the Supercopa de España final.

== Support ==

The nickname &quot;culer&quot; for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan &quot;cul&quot; (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indústria, sat with their &quot;culs&quot; over the stand. In Spain, about 25% of the population is said to be Barça sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population. Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club. The club&#x27;s membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in September 2009, the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta&#x27;s media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media. , the club has 150,317 memberships, called &quot;socis&quot;.

In addition to membership, there are 1,264 officially registered fan clubs, called &quot;penyes&quot;, around the world. The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona. Among the best supported teams globally, Barcelona has the second highest social media following in the world among sports teams, with over 103 million Facebook fans , only behind Real Madrid with 111 million. The club has had many prominent people among its supporters, including Pope John Paul II, who was an honorary member, and former prime minister of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.

== Club rivalries ==
=== &quot;El Clásico&quot; ===
There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as &quot;The Classic&quot; (&quot;El Clásico&quot;). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War. Over the years, the head-to-head record between the two clubs is 102 victories for Madrid, 100 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.
As early as the 1930s, Barcelona &quot;had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid&quot;. In 1936, when Francisco Franco started the &quot;Coup d&#x27;état&quot; against the democratic Second Spanish Republic, the president of Barcelona, Josep Sunyol, member of the Republican Left of Catalonia and Deputy to The Cortes, was arrested and executed without trial by Franco&#x27;s troops (Sunyol was exercising his political activities, visiting Republican troops north of Madrid). During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to the fascist-like regime. In this period, Barcelona gained their motto &quot;Més que un club&quot; (&quot;English: More than a club&quot;) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.

There&#x27;s an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco&#x27;s rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree than Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its &quot;royal&quot; name after the fall of the Republic). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed &quot;CF Barcelona&quot; succeed as &quot;Spanish team&quot; rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco&#x27;s rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid&#x27;s 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu&#x27;s &quot;revolution&quot; that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco&#x27;s forces, saw Real Madrid on top not only of Spanish but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe&#x27;s best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s. These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco&#x27;s attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime&#x27;s international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that &quot;[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had.&quot; Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, 6 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 1 Copa Eva Duarte, 6 European Cups, 2 Latin Cups, and 1 Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won 8 league titles, 9 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 3 Copa Eva Duarte titles, 3 Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and 2 Latin Cups.

The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millionarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players&#x27; strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios&#x27; return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano&#x27;s rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to &quot;Los Blancos&quot;, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.

Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup. The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the &quot;Match of The Century&quot; by Spanish media, and Madrid&#x27;s win was watched by more than 500 million people. An intense fixture which is marked by its indiscipline in addition to memorable goal celebrations from both teams – often involving mocking the opposition – such notable celebrations occurred in 2009 when Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of incensed Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and in 2017 when Lionel Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.

=== &quot;El derbi Barceloní&quot; ===
Barça&#x27;s local rival has always been Espanyol. &quot;Blanc-i-blaus&quot;, being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça&#x27;s primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners. The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid. Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.

Traditionally, Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona&#x27;s citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Barça&#x27;s revolutionary spirit. Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia&#x27;s new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.

In 1918, Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy, which at that time had become a pertinent issue. Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the &quot;derbi&quot; has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.

Though it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the primera división league table, Espanyol has only managed to end above Barça on three occasions from 87 seasons (1928–2022) and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 in 1951, while Barcelona&#x27;s biggest win was 5–0 on seven occasions (in 1933, 1947, 1964, 1975, 1992, 2016 and 2017). Espanyol achieved a 2–1 win against Barça during the 2008–09 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning season.

=== Rivalry with AC Milan ===

One of Barcelona&#x27;s rivals in European football is Italian club AC Milan. The team against which Barcelona has played the most matches (19), it is also the third most played match in European club competitions, behind Real Madrid–Juventus (21) and Real Madrid–Bayern Munich (26). Two of the most successful clubs in Europe, Milan has won seven European Cups to Barça&#x27;s five, while both clubs have won a record five European Super Cups. Barcelona and Milan have won other continental titles, which make them the second and third most decorated teams in world football, with 19 and 14 titles respectively, both behind Real Madrid&#x27;s 23.

Barcelona leads the head-to-head record with eight wins and five defeats. The first encounter between the two clubs was in the 1959–60 European Cup. They faced off in the round of 16 and Barça won the tie on a 7–1 aggregate score (0–2 in Milan and 5–1 in Barcelona). While Milan had never knocked Barcelona out of the European Cup, they beat Johan Cruyff&#x27;s Dream Team 4–0 in the 1994 Champions League final, despite being the underdogs. In 2013, however, Barcelona made a &quot;historic&quot; comeback from a 0–2 first leg defeat in the round of 16 of the 2012–13 Champions League, winning 4–0 at Camp Nou.

== Ownership and finances ==
Along with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and Osasuna, Barcelona is organised as a registered association. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership. The members of Barcelona, called &quot;socis&quot;, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club. , the club has 150,317 &quot;socis&quot;.

In 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; evaluated Barcelona&#x27;s worth to be around €752 million (US$1 billion), ranking them fourth after Manchester United, Real Madrid and Arsenal, based on figures from the 2008–09 season. According to Deloitte, Barcelona had a recorded revenue of €366 million in the same period, ranking second to Real Madrid, who generated €401 million in revenue. In 2013, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Barcelona the third most valuable sports team in the world, behind Real Madrid and Manchester United, with a value of $2.6 billion. In 2014, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked them the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $3.2 billion, and Deloitte ranked them the world&#x27;s fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €484.6 million. In 2017, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked them the fourth most valuable sports team in the world with a team value of $3.64 billion. In 2018, Barcelona became the first sports team to surpass $1bn in annual revenues. In November 2018 Barcelona became the first sports team with average first-team pay in excess of £10m ($13.8m) per year. However, years of profligate spending under the leadership of Josep Maria Bartomeu (president between 2014 and 2020) and other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, saw the club&#x27;s gross debt rise to about $1.4 billion in 2021, much of it short-term.

On November 9, 2024, Barcelona announced its new sponsorship deal with Nike. It is said that it is the highest deal in football history.

== In popular culture ==

Since its origins, Barcelona has had a close relationship with the world of culture, especially, with Catalan culture. The club&#x27;s statutes from 1932 already said that Barça &quot;is an association of a cultural and sporting nature&quot;. The club and its players have been a source of inspiration for writers, musicians, visual artists, journalists, cartoonists, theater, and film people.

In literature, some great Catalan writers they were inspired by the club. In 1957, on the occasion of the inauguration of the Camp Nou, Josep Maria de Sagarra dedicated a poem titled &quot;Blau i grana&quot;. Poet Manuel Vázquez Montalbán wrote regularly about his vision of the team. Some expressions emerged that caught on in the popular imagination, such as identifying Barça with &quot;The unarmed army of Catalonia.&quot; He also wrote that &quot;Barça is the only legal institution that unites the man on the street with the Catalonia that could have been and was not.&quot;

The great anniversaries have been favorable occasions for the club to involve great Catalan figures from the cultural world in its activities. Names such as Josep Segrelles, Joan Miró and Antoni Tàpies have signed commemorative posters, just as Jaume Picas and the writer Josep Maria Espinàs, on the occasion of the club&#x27;s 75th anniversary, wrote the lyrics for &quot;Cant del Barça&quot;, the current anthem, with music by Manuel Valls.
The Blaugrana world has also been a source of inspiration in the plastic arts, with names such as Jordi Alumà, Josep Maria Subirachs, Antoni Tàpies or Josep Viladomat, who made the &#x27;Avi del Barça&#x27; sculpture in the La Masia. Salvador Dalí paid tribute to the club&#x27;s 75th anniversary with an etching.

In performing arts, music has also been present, from the tango that Gardel dedicated to Samitier to the songs of Joan Manuel Serrat, La Trinca and many others. Theater has also been a good way to express the feelings of Barça fans, from the El Paralelo cuplés from before the Civil War or skits like &#x27;El Partido del Domingo&#x27;, by Castaños, to more recent texts, like &quot;El culékulé&quot;, by Xavier Bosch.

In times of political difficulty or lack of freedoms, Barça has been a refuge and means of expression for cultural and artistic activities. In 2013, the club highlighted the &#x27;Barça Cultura&#x27; plan, an initiative that promotes the area of institutional relations and protocol with the aim of offering Barcelona as a platform to promote culture in Catalonia. In 2022, Barcelona and Òmnium sign an agreement to promote the Catalan language, culture and the country.

There are many documentaries and films that have been created throughout history to capture the successes and journey of the club over the years. More recently, in December 2022, Amazon Prime Video released a five-episode docuseries called &quot;FC Barcelona: A New Era&quot;. It documented the club by spending time with the coaching staff and players behind the scenes both on and off the field throughout their 2021–22 season. In September 2023, Amazon Prime Video launched the second season with a five-episode docuseries. It focuses on their 2022–23 behind the scenes season.

== Records ==
In March 2021, Lionel Messi overtook Xavi&#x27;s record of 767 games played for the club, and presently has made 778 official appearances in all competitions, while also holding the record for the most appearances in La Liga matches for Barcelona, with 520.
Barcelona&#x27;s all-time highest goalscorer in official competitions is Lionel Messi with 672 goals, surpassing César Rodríguez&#x27;s 232 goals in March 2012, a record which stood for 60 years. In December 2020, Messi also overtook Pelé&#x27;s 643 goals for Santos to become the highest official scorer for a single club. Messi is the record goalscorer for Barcelona in European and international club competitions, and the record league scorer with 474 goals in La Liga. Four other players have managed to score over 100 league goals for Barcelona: César Rodríguez (190), Luis Suárez (147), László Kubala (131) and Samuel Eto&#x27;o (108). Josep Samitier is the club&#x27;s highest goalscorer in the , with 64 goals.

László Kubala holds the La Liga record for most goals scored in one match, with seven goals against Sporting Gijón in 1952. Lionel Messi co-holds the Champions League record with five goals against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. Eulogio Martínez became Barça&#x27;s top goalscorer in a cup game, when he scored seven goals against Atlético Madrid in 1957.

Barcelona goalkeepers have won a record number of Zamora trophies (20), with Antoni Ramallets and Víctor Valdés winning a record five each. Valdés had a ratio of 0.832 goals-conceded-per-game, a La Liga record, and he also holds the record for longest period without conceding a goal (896 minutes) in all competitions for Barcelona. Claudio Bravo has the record of best unbeaten start in a season in La Liga history, at 754 minutes.
Barcelona&#x27;s longest serving manager is Jack Greenwell, with nine years in two spells (1917–1924) and (1931–1933), and Pep Guardiola is the club&#x27;s most successful manager (14 trophies in 4 years). The most successful Barcelona player is Lionel Messi with 35 trophies, surpassing Andrés Iniesta, with 32 trophies.

Barcelona&#x27;s Camp Nou is the largest stadium in Europe. The club&#x27;s highest home attendance was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986. The modernisation of Camp Nou during the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands means the record will not be broken for the foreseeable future as the current capacity of the stadium is 99,354.

&quot;El Barça de les Cinc Copes&quot; is the first team in Spanish football to have won five trophies in a single season (1951–1952). Barcelona is the only club to have played in every season of European competitions since they started in 1955 counting non-UEFA competition Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. On 18 December 2009, alongside being the only Spanish club to achieve a continental treble, Barcelona became the first ever European football team to win six trophies in a calendar year (Sextuple). In January 2018, Barcelona signed Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool for €120 million, the highest transfer fee in club&#x27;s history. In August 2017, Barcelona player Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record transfer fee of €222 million.

In 2016, Barcelona&#x27;s La Masia was ranked second by the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) as the most top-level players producing academy in the world.

== Kits and crest ==

The club&#x27;s original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm. The club shared Barcelona&#x27;s coat of arms, as a demonstration of its identification with the city and a desire to be recognised as one. In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamala&#x27;s suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.

The blue and garnet colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900. Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and garnet design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor&#x27;s School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre&#x27;s First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel.
;Notes
=== Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors ===
Since 1998, the club has had a kit deal with Nike. In 2016, the deal was renewed until 2028 for a record €155 million per year. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime if Barcelona fail to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga. In 2023, Barcelona became the revenue leader from the sale of kits and merchandising in Europe with a turnover of €179 million.
Although Spanish clubs first began displaying sponsor names on their shirts in 1981, Barcelona held off having a name across the front of the shirt until 2006, when the club signed an agreement to have UNICEF&#x27;s name on their front. Unlike traditional deals, this was not to have paying money to the club, but instead to have the club raise money for UNICEF. In 2011, the club signed its first commercial shirt sponsorship deal, when it reached an agreement with Qatar Foundation.

== Anthems ==

Throughout its history, the club has had various official songs. The anthem in use today is &quot;Cant del Barça&quot; (The Song of Barça), composed in 1974 on the occasion of the club&#x27;s 75th anniversary. Authors Josep Maria Espinàs and Jaume Picas composed the lyrics in Catalan, while the music was composed by Manuel Valls.

The song was first performed on 27 November 1974 at Camp Nou before the match between FC Barcelona and the East Germany national team by a 3,500-man choir led by Oriol Martorell. On November 28, 1988, in celebration of the club&#x27;s centenary, the song was performed by Catalan singer-songwriter Joan Manuel Serrat at the end of the festival at Camp Nou. Since the 2008–09 season, el Cant del Barça has been featured on the official Barcelona jerseys.

On the occasion of the club&#x27;s 124th anniversary and with the start of preparations for the 125th anniversary, the club presented a new anthem version recording faithful to the essence of the original score and lyrics composed in 1974, with a better quality and enhanced orchestration and vocals. Composed by the Vallès Symphony Orchestra, the Orfeó Català choral society and the Cor Jove youth choir, it is the current official version.

El Cant del Barça is turned on before Barcelona games take place at Camp Nou, especially during matches against Real Madrid and just before the start of the meeting. The song is also often played for supporters and fans to cheer, chant and celebrate the victory.

== Stadium ==


Barcelona initially played on different fields, one of the first to represent a fixed venue was the Camp de la Indústria. The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership.

In 1922, the number of supporters had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Barça was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.

After the construction was complete there was no further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of László Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games. The club began to make plans for a new stadium. The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Barça fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas, 336% over budget.

In 1980, when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernabéu. In preparation for the 1992 Summer Olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline. It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.

In December 2021, a record 88% of the club members voted in favor of the &quot;Espai Barça&quot; project to revamp the club&#x27;s sporting facilities, being the first online referendum in FC Barcelona history. Originally projected to have been completed in 2021, renovation work on Camp Nou began on 1 June 2023 and it is now aimed to finish by the end of 2026, with an estimated €1.5 billion net funding. During the renovation period, Barcelona will move for the entire 2023–24 season to Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys in Montjuïc, expecting to return in November 2024, with the stadium still under construction.

There are also other facilities, which include:
* Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper (FC Barcelona&#x27;s training ground)
* Masia-Centre de Formació Oriol Tort (Residence of young players)
* Estadi Johan Cruyff (Home of the reserve team, women&#x27;s team, and Juvenil A)
* Palau Blaugrana (FC Barcelona indoor sports arena)
* Palau Blaugrana 2 (Secondary indoor arena of FC Barcelona)

==Honours==

<text>The Riverworld series consists of five science fiction novels (1971–1983) by American author Philip José Farmer (1918–2009). The Riverworld is an artificial, or heavily terraformed, planet where all humans (and pre-humans) who ever lived throughout history have been restored to life. The novels (and a few shorter works) explore interactions of resurrected individuals from many different cultures and time periods. The underlying theme is quasi-religious. The motivations and ethics of the unknown intelligences that created the Riverworld and its inhabitants are explored.

==Works==
===Original, unpublished manuscript===
&quot;Riverworld&quot; began when Farmer wrote a 150,000-word novel, calling it &quot;Owe for the Flesh&quot;, over six weeks in the fall of 1952 and submitted it at the last minute to the Shasta Science-Fiction Novel Prize Contest. He won the contest, with assurances of publication, but circumstances conspired to ensure that that would not happen for many years. The complete manuscript, now believed lost, consisted of four &quot;books&quot;:

*&quot;Owe for the Flesh&quot;
**&quot;The Great Cry&quot;
**&quot;A State of Honesty&quot;
**&quot;The River of Eternity&quot;
**&quot;The Paddle Wheeled Comet&quot;

In about 1981, and in the wake of the success of the Riverworld novels, Farmer issued a general request to anyone who might have the original manuscript. An 80,000-word document entitled &quot;River of Eternity&quot; was then discovered in a garage and returned to Farmer. This turned out to be, not the original, but a version produced in the mid-1950s by Farmer (who had entirely forgotten about it) from the third &quot;book&quot; at the request of the publisher Melvin Korshak. This document was published unaltered in 1983 by Phantasia Press as &quot;River of Eternity&quot; and is generally considered to be of mostly academic interest.

===Magazine publications===
With no prospect of imminent publication, Farmer moved on to other projects. But in 1963 and &#x27;64, he rewrote the material into a second version and in late 1964 into a third, which he now called &quot;Owe for a River&quot;. This version was submitted to Ballantine Books, but it was rejected as being too much of an adventure story without sufficient deeper philosophical implications. Undaunted, he sent the manuscript to Frederik Pohl who at that time edited a number of prominent science fiction magazines. Pohl suggested that Farmer break the novel into several novelettes for serial publication in his periodicals. Farmer agreed, and thus the fourth version of what started out as &quot;Owe for the Flesh&quot; 13 years before finally saw publication as five novelettes:

*&quot;The Day of the Great Shout&quot; (&quot;Worlds of Tomorrow&quot;, January 1965)
*&quot;Riverworld&quot; (&quot;Worlds of Tomorrow&quot;, January 1966)
*&quot;The Suicide Express&quot; (&quot;Worlds of Tomorrow&quot;, March 1966)
*&quot;The Felled Star&quot; (&quot;Worlds of If&quot;, July 1967, August 1967)
*&quot;The Fabulous Riverboat&quot; (&quot;Worlds of If&quot;, June 1971, August 1971)

Of these five novelettes, four — all but &quot;Riverworld&quot; — were expanded and combined into the first two Riverworld novels as published by Putnam Publishing Group in 1971. Thus the fifth, and final, version of the Riverworld sequence comprises the four &quot;mainstream&quot; (Farmer&#x27;s term) novels (1971-80) listed below, plus the extra &quot;sidestream&quot; book, &quot;Gods of Riverworld&quot; (1983).

As to the novelette that remained a &quot;standalone&quot; — &quot;Riverworld&quot; — it underwent a slight expansion and was included in Farmer&#x27;s collection &quot;Down in the Black Gang&quot; in 1971. After one more (final) expansion and polishing, it was included in the collection &quot;Riverworld and Other Stories&quot; in 1979.

===Published novels (and short stories)===
The five novels in the Riverworld series are as follows:
* &quot;To Your Scattered Bodies Go&quot; (1971) – Hugo Award winner, Locus Award nominee
* &quot;The Fabulous Riverboat&quot; (1971)
* &quot;The Dark Design&quot; (1977)
* &quot;The Magic Labyrinth&quot; (1980)
* &quot;Gods of Riverworld&quot; (1983; later published as &quot;The Gods of Riverworld&quot;)

In the early 1990s, it was decided to turn Riverworld into a shared universe anthology series, with numerous authors being invited to participate. Two volumes were released:
* &quot;Tales of Riverworld&quot; (1992) (includes one story written by Farmer: &quot;Crossing the Dark River&quot;. A second story, &quot;A Hole In Hell&quot;, was written by Farmer under the pseudonym Dane Helstrom)
* &quot;Quest to Riverworld&quot; (1993) (includes two stories written by Farmer: &quot;Up the Bright River&quot; and &quot;Coda&quot;)

On the Riverworld, every human who ever lived and diedfrom the earliest Neanderthals up to 1983is resurrected on the banks of a seemingly endless river on an unknown planet. Along the river&#x27;s almost 18 million twisting and turning miles, some 36.6 billion humans are miraculously provided with food, but with no clue to the possible meaning or purpose of this strange afterlife.

Some people set sail upon the great river to quest for the meaning of their resurrection, and to find and confront their mysterious &quot;benefactors&quot;. Among the denizens of the Riverworld, we meet Sir Richard Francis Burton, Mark Twain, Odysseus, Cyrano de Bergerac, Hermann Göring, Tom Mix, and many others, including a modest alter ego of the author himself. Some characters collaborate and some embark upon solo journeys of their own in this landscape.

===Overview===
Starting in the &quot;late twenty second century&quot;, the Riverworld has been engineered by an alien race to consist solely of a single long river-valley which snakes across its entire surface. The river&#x27;s source is a small North Polar sea, from which it follows a course tightly zig-zagging across one hemisphere before flowing into another, along an equally labyrinthine path, to the same sea. The river has an average depth of , and its width ranges from to . It is shallow near the shore but plunges to enormous depths towards the channel. The banks are generally smooth and gentle, expanding into wide plains on either side, then assuming jagged hills before an impenetrable mountain range. The valley averages in width, but includes narrows and occasional widenings into lakes with islands. From source to mouth, the original supposition of the river&#x27;s length is 20,000,000 miles, as said by Alice Hargreaves and attributed to Peter Frigate, shortly after the defeat of Hermann Goering. (Books I, II, and III later state the river is long). There are no seasons, and daily variations are metronomic. The only animal life consists of fish and soil worms. The vegetation is lush and of great variety, including trees, flowering vines, several kinds of fast-growing bamboo, and a resilient mat of grass which covers the plains. The Riverworld has no visible moon, but a great number of stellar objects in the sky, including gas sheets and stars close enough to show a visible disk.

The story of Riverworld begins when 36,006,009,637 humans, varying from the first &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; until the early 21st century, are simultaneously resurrected along the river. Of these, 20% are from the 20th century, due to the high population thereof. Originally the cutoff year was given as 2008 in &quot;To Your Scattered Bodies Go&quot;, but this later was modified to 1983 in &quot;The Dark Design&quot;. Purportedly, the cut-off indicated the point at which most of the human race had been purposefully annihilated by first contact with aliens visiting Earth. The protagonists later find this a creative fiction, produced by the masterminds of the resurrection. Undercover agents of these masters placed on the Riverworld would identify themselves as having died after 1983 so as to be recognized by fellow agents.

In each area are initially three groups of people: a large group from one time period and place, a smaller group from another time and place, and a very small group of people from random times and places (most of the 20th- and 21st-century humans are part of this last group).

===Resurrectees===
Most of the resurrected awaken in a body equivalent to that of their 25-year-old selves, in perfect health and free of any previous genetic or acquired defects. All heart disease, tooth decay, and blindness are gone, all amputated limbs are restored, and all scars, tattoos and other body modifications are removed; whereas certain neurological impulses (for instance, curiosity or chemical addiction) remain intact. These bodies do not age, and can regenerate nearly any non-fatal injury, including dismemberments and blindings. The new bodies are completely free of infection and seem resistant to it (albeit in the absence of hostile bacteria or viruses on the Riverworld). Initially hairless, the bodies grow cephalic hair and pubic hair at a normal rate. Men do not have foreskins or grow facial hair; whereas women have intact hymens. It is impossible to conceive children on the Riverworld; all food provided by grails (see below) contain contraceptive substances, and there is no wathan generator on the Riverworld so any babies born there would lack sapience (see below).

Anyone who died at an age younger than 25 assumes a body equivalent to that lesser age, which then ages at a normal rate before stopping at 25. Should an individual die, they are resurrected elsewhere along the banks of the river at random. Some people even use this process to travel, though there is a limit to the number of resurrections available to each person; one of the main protagonists is warned by the creators of the Riverworld that after 777 deliberate suicides he is in danger of failing to resurrect after his next death. No one who was less than five years old at death is resurrected on the Riverworld, nor are people deemed to be incurably insane (it is eventually revealed that these people were resurrected on another planet, Gardenworld). No hominids born before the approximate year 97,000 BCE were saved for the Riverworld project and thus were never resurrected anywhere.

One of the themes of the series is the way historical characters change as a result of this cosmopolitan setting. For example, one of the characters depicted in the first book of the Riverworld series, &quot;To Your Scattered Bodies Go&quot;, is a tormented, drug-addicted Hermann Göring who ends up as a missionary of the Church of the Second Chance, a peaceful religion. Apparently left to their own devices, the people re-create their Earthly societies.

====Language====

Because all human languages are initially in use on the Riverworld, the Ethicals are not able to explain clearly to the resurrected Humans what&#x27;s happening. In order to explain without misunderstanding, they must first spread a common language. They choose Esperanto to be the common language and create a religion called the Church of the Second Chance to spread it via travelling priests.

====Grails====
The resurrected awaken with nearly-indestructible containers tied to their wrists, commonly called &quot;grails&quot;, which produce food, drink, pieces of cloth, and luxury items, such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana (and lighters for same), hair care utensils, makeup, and a hallucinogenic chewing gum known as &quot;dreamgum&quot;. To operate, grails must be placed onto large, mushroom-shaped &quot;grailstones&quot;, found at intervals along the riverbanks, which produce an electrical discharge three times per day (corresponding to the times of breakfast, lunch and dinner). As agriculture is absent, and indeed impossible on the Riverworld, the grails are vital to an individual&#x27;s survival, and cannot be opened except by their individual owners. Nevertheless, &quot;grail slavery&quot; is not uncommon, in which a person is held captive and the contents of his or her grail, retrieved by the owner, are taken by force by the captor. The slaver will usually provide the slave with enough food to keep him or her alive, as once a person dies their grail becomes useless.

Of special value are &quot;free grails&quot;, originally found atop each of the grailstones as a demonstration of their relationship. Free grails can be opened by any individual, and as such, are valued for an extra ration of goods at each interval. Throughout the series, several main characters lose their original grails and thus must seek free grails to survive.

====Natural resources and travel====
Though the grails provide for all needs and the climate is hospitable, further attempts to affect the environment are frustrated by the near-complete lack of metals and ores on the planet. The only building materials available are bamboo, wood, and human or fish bones and hides. Pockets of flint (eventually depleted) provide material for tools. With technology limited to the Paleolithic level, the surrounding mountains prove impassable.

Travel along the river is hindered by division of the Riverworld into thousands of empires, monarchies, republics, and other social systems which evolve, each only a few kilometers long and housing 90 people per square kilometer. Because the distribution of populations along the river seems random, the character of these nations can vary wildly within a very short span; one may enter dangerously unknown and potentially hostile territory in less than a day&#x27;s journey.

===Purpose===
The reason for the existence of Riverworld is initially a complete mystery. In Farmer&#x27;s books a number of historical figures—including Sir Richard Burton, Alice Hargreaves, Samuel Clemens, Baron de Marbot, King John of England, Cyrano de Bergerac, Tom Mix, Mozart, Jack London, Lothar von Richthofen, and Hermann Göring—interact with fictional characters to discover the Riverworld&#x27;s purpose. Another character, Peter Jairus Frigate, bears a striking resemblance to Farmer himself, and shares his initials. There are two versions of the character: one who appears early in the sequence, the third overall character to be introduced, and another, the &quot;real&quot; version, who concludes that the first was his brother who died as a baby, resurrected and used as a spy by the creators of the Riverworld.

The story gradually reveals that the Riverworld was created as a moral test for humanity. In the Riverworld universe sapience is the result of an artificially created soul, known as a &quot;wathan&quot;, created by a generator developed and distributed among various worlds by an unknown ancient alien race. Wathan generators create wathans which attach themselves to sufficiently advanced chordates. Wathans are indestructible but become detached from the body upon physical death and wander the universe without purpose.

The first race to create wathans were adept tool users, but lacked individual sapience. Self-awareness increased their capabilities by an order of magnitude, and as the creators of wathan technology, they were able to &quot;catch&quot; wathans released by their own deaths, resurrecting themselves until individual resurrections became impossible. As this happened only to the wisest and most ethically advanced wathans, the people supposed a process of &quot;passing on&quot;, comparable to the Indian religious concept of Moksha. With this in mind, they traveled the universe, placing wathan generators on worlds that could host wathans, thereby creating other sentient species. Once they created a species they determined they could trust, they tasked them with creating more sapient species after the whole of their own species had &quot;passed on&quot;. This cycle occurred several times until the creation of humanity.

Humanity&#x27;s creators are a race of aliens known, among their human allies, as &quot;the Ethicals&quot;, who brought wathan technology to Earth, installing both a generator to produce wathans and a collector to catch and store wathans—and the human personas and memories accumulated by them—for later retrieval. The only Ethical seen in the stories is Monat Graatut, who poses as an ally and friend of Richard Francis Burton. The reason given for the collector was that humans were both extraordinarily civilized (capable of &quot;passing on&quot; within a single lifetime, as did Gautama Buddha), and extraordinarily barbaric (capable of genocide, slavery etc.), and therefore might or might not be trusted with wathan technology; an ambiguity meant for resolution by the Riverworld. Children who died before age five are resurrected on a &quot;Gardenworld&quot;: a physical paradise where the children were raised as Ethicals, who later created the Riverworld in hope of stimulating moral contemplation. The repetitive physical environment was to encourage a concern with inward rather than outward circumstances, while the poverty of natural resources was to prevent the development of a higher technology, and the food provided by the grails, the presence of abundant water and potential shelter, and the resurrections were to obviate economy. Alcohol, marijuana, and the LSD-like dreamgum were provided for recreational purposes and to assist contemplation.

===Academic study===

Three books of the Riverworld series are analyzed in Mary Turzillo&#x27;s book &quot;Reader&#x27;s Guide to Philip José Farmer&quot;.

Antoine Ruiz of the Université d&#x27;Avignon (France) wrote a master&#x27;s degree memoir entitled &quot;Redemption in Philip José Farmer&#x27;s Riverworld&quot; in 1995.

==Elaborations and adaptations==
===Role playing game (1989)===
A licensed guidebook outlining the setting for use in the GURPS role-playing game, &quot;GURPS Riverworld&quot; was released in 1989 by Steve Jackson Games. Copies of this guidebook were provided to the authors of the stories published in &quot;Tales of Riverworld&quot; and &quot;Quest To Riverworld&quot;, as this book summarizes the chronology, characters, geography and technical details of the Riverworld universe.

===&quot;Shared Universe&quot; stories (1992 and later)===
Since the publication of the original books, several authors have been licensed to use the &quot;Riverworld&quot; setting for their own stories - see &quot;Works&quot; towards the top of this page.

===Video game (1998)===
A PC computer game version of &quot;Riverworld&quot; was released in October 1998 by Cryo Interactive.

===Television series (2003)===
A television series loosely based on the &quot;Riverworld&quot; saga went into production for the Sci-Fi channel in 2001 but only the feature-length pilot episode &quot;Riverworld&quot; was completed. It was first aired in 2003. It used elements from &quot;To Your Scattered Bodies Go&quot; and &quot;The Fabulous Riverboat&quot;, though it replaced the books&#x27; hero, Sir Richard Francis Burton, with an American astronaut and King John of England with Nero as the villain. At one point, the pilot was available online through the Joost software worldwide except in the United States and Canada. It can be found on the Alliance Atlantis Sci-Fi channel.

===Television movie (2010)===
In 2010, a three-hour TV film, &quot;Riverworld&quot;, was produced and released by Syfy (formerly The Sci-fi Channel) in the US and by Studio Universal elsewhere, written by Robert Hewitt Wolfe. The protagonist is Matt Ellman, an American war reporter, played by Tahmoh Penikett. The main villain is Richard Francis Burton, who ironically was one of the prime heroes in the novels.

===Fan fiction===
Some stories written by fans and taking place in the &quot;Riverworld&quot; universe have been published through the official Philip José Farmer website.

<doc id="68194" wikidata="Q53747" url="?curid=68194" title="Göran Persson">
<text>Hans Göran Persson (; born 20 January 1949) is a Swedish politician who served as Prime Minister of Sweden from 1996 to 2006 and leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party from 1996 to 2007.

Persson was first elected to the Swedish Parliament in 1979, representing Södermanland County but left in 1985 to serve as Municipal Commissioner of Katrineholm, which he did from 1985 to 1989. In 1991, he was re-elected to the Parliament and represented the same constituency. He served as Minister for Schools from 1989 to 1991 in Ingvar Carlsson&#x27;s first and second cabinets. From 1994 to 1996, Persson served as Minister for Finance in Carlsson&#x27;s third cabinet.

After Ingvar Carlsson announced his retirement from the position of prime minister, Persson was chosen to become the new prime minister. Persson began as prime minister where he left office as minister for finance – by continuing to spearhead government efforts to alleviate Sweden&#x27;s chronic budget deficit. In 1994, the annual shortfall was about 13 per cent of the country&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP). But after implementing welfare cuts and tax increases, it fell to a projected 2.6 per cent of GDP in 1997, which placed Sweden in a position to qualify for the European Economic and Monetary Union. However, the cost was high: unemployment rose, hovering persistently around 13 per cent, then suddenly fell to about 6.5 per cent the same year. In the 1998 general election, the Social Democrats gained even fewer votes than in the 1991 general election, when they got voted out of office. Persson could remain as prime minister with the support of the Green Party and the Left Party. In the 2002 general election the Social Democrats increased their number of seats in the parliament. After the defeat at the general elections of 17 September 2006, Persson immediately filed a request for resignation, and declared his intentions to resign as party leader after the party congress in March 2007.

Since leaving office, Persson has been a consultant for the Stockholm-based PR firm JKL. He published a book in October 2007, &quot;Min väg, mina val&quot; (My path, my choices). In 2008 he was appointed Chairman of the Board of Sveaskog by the Swedish Government. He has been a member of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation since 2007, and a member of the board of World Resources Institute since 2010.

== Personal life ==
Persson was born in Vingåker in Södermanland, Sweden, in a working-class home. He has in recent years revealed that he wanted to become a priest as a young man; however, he applied to the college in Örebro where he took courses in social science (main sociology). He completed 80 college credits (120 ECTS credits) in the subject before he left the college in 1971 without graduating. As the college later received credentials as a full university, the renamed Örebro University gave him an honorary Ph.D. in medicine in February 2005, an award that provoked some controversy.

He first married Gunnel (née Claesson) in 1978, with whom he has two daughters. They divorced in 1994. On 10 March 1994, he married Annika Barthine, whom he divorced in December 2003. On 6 December 2003, Persson married Anitra Steen, who became his third wife. In 2004, Persson and Steen purchased the 190-hectare agricultural property, Övre Torp, by Lake Båven in Södermanland. During 2006 the couple started the construction of a large house on the property.

Besides his native Swedish, Persson also speaks English.

He has maintained his Christian faith and is a member of Swedish Association of Christian Social Democrats.

=== Health problems ===
On 8 July 2002, Persson fell while riding his bicycle at Harpsund and broke his left clavicle. Following this accident he was unable to lift his left arm for some time and almost fainted during a speech in Almedalen on 10 July 2002 and after a meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair on 15 July 2002. Present with him during the accident was Pär Nuder, Minister of Finance, and Sten Olsson, State Secretary. Pär Nuder wrote in his book &quot;Stolt men inte nöjd&quot; (&quot;proud but not satisfied&quot;), released in 2008, that Persson had fallen while riding his bicycle because he was drunk after consuming large amounts of alcoholic beverages. Persson said in response to these claims: &quot;I can&#x27;t exactly recapitulate the event but I can say as much that I&#x27;m surprised that Pär Nuder remembers anything&quot;.

In September 2003 Persson was diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis and surgery was recommended. He chose to go through Sweden&#x27;s public health-care system instead of seeking private treatment; he was put on a waiting list, and finally received a hip replacement operation in June 2004. During that 9-month period, he walked with a limp and reportedly was on strong painkillers; he had to cancel several official trips due to the pain he was in.
== Political career ==

Persson was in office for more than ten years, making him the second-longest continuously-governing prime minister of Sweden second to Tage Erlander. He is known for his oratorical prowess, often dispensing with prepared speeches or preparing them without the aid of his staff. During his time, he has faced several shocking incidents, such as the Gothenburg riots in June 2001, the murder of Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh in September 2003, Asian tsunami disaster in December 2004 during the Boxing Day, and the conflict over the publication of satirical Muhammed cartoons in Danish newspapers, leading to threats of violence against Scandinavians and burning of embassies in the Middle East and the resignation of Swedish Foreign Minister Laila Freivalds.

In the early seventies he worked for the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League (&quot;SSU&quot;), and was a member of the national board from 1972 to 1975. Later, he served as a city council politician at the small municipality of Katrineholm. In 1979 he was elected Member of Parliament, but went back to local politics to serve as Municipal Commissioner (&quot;kommunalråd&quot;) of Katrineholm from 1985 to 1989.

=== National politics ===
In 1989, he was made Minister of Schools in the Ministry of Education during the first Ingvar Carlsson cabinet, until the election in 1991 when the Social Democrats were voted out of office. Persson was one of the brains behind the &quot;Persson-plan&quot; which was presented in 1994 targeting the prevailing economic situation. Sweden at the time still suffered from the recession which began during the early nineties, high unemployment rates and a huge budget deficit. Prime minister Carl Bildt relied at the time on a fragile coalition between the Moderate Party and three other liberal or conservative parties with a strained degree of cooperation. The outcome of the 1994 election proved a success for the Social Democrats when they gained more than 45 per cent of the votes.

Upon returning to government in 1994, Persson was made Minister for Finance, a post he held until 1996. As Minister of Finance much of his job was focused on attaining a sound financial balance in the economy. Persson often emphasizes that he &quot;cleaned up&quot; after the Bildt government.

During his time at the Finance Ministry he followed 10 &quot;Commandments&quot; as his guiding lights in his job. Among of these &quot;Commandments&quot; was one in particular which became famous in Sweden, &quot;one who is in debt is not free&quot; ( in Swedish : &quot;Den som är satt i skuld är icke fri&quot; )

=== Party leader and Prime Minister ===

In 1996, Persson was chosen over Mona Sahlin, the Deputy Prime Minister, to lead the country after Carlsson retired. Persson began where he left off as finance minister – by continuing to spearhead government efforts to alleviate Sweden&#x27;s chronic budget deficit. In 1994, the annual shortfall was about 13 per cent of GDP. But, after implementing welfare cuts and tax increases, it fell to a projected 2.6 per cent of GDP in 1997, which put Sweden in a position to qualify for the European economic and monetary union. However, the cost was high: unemployment rose, hovering persistently around 13 per cent, then suddenly fell to about 6.5 per cent the same year.

===From 1998 to 2002===
In the 1998 election the Social Democrats gained even fewer votes than in the 1991 election, when they got voted out of office. Thanks to support that came primarily from the Green and Left parties, he managed to retain office but had to rely on support from at least two parties in the parliament. Later the same year, the government announced proposals for far-reaching cutbacks in Sweden&#x27;s military spending.

The year 1999 was seen by the Social Democrats as the vindication for the tough fiscal policies pursued since they came to office in 1994: GDP growth was estimated at 3.6 per cent, well above the European average, inflation remained subdued, and the budget was in surplus for the first time in the 1990s. The party proposed income tax cuts for 2000.

In 2000, a strong economy, falling unemployment, and the impact of the Internet appeared to breathe new life into the &quot;Swedish model&quot; of a welfare society, one that had seemed dead and buried during the deep recession of the early 1990s: growth reached 4 per cent, and unemployment fell to the lowest level in years. The Social Democrats, however, failed to capitalize on the economic boom. Around this time, the Persson government began reversing cuts by boosting child support. Opinion polls showed the party struggling to return to its post-election 36 per cent approval level. Instead, the smaller Left Party, a Social Democrat ally, picked up support with its program of increased public spending and opposition to Swedish membership in the European single currency.

Economically, the bursting of the dot-com boom by 2001 had marked implications for Sweden. Ericsson, the world&#x27;s largest producer of mobile telecommunications equipment, shed thousands of jobs, as did the country&#x27;s once fast-expanding Internet consulting firms and dot-com start-ups.

Gross domestic product growth of 3.6 per cent in 2000 was expected to have fallen to around 1.5 per cent in 2001, and only a minor recovery was forecast for 2002. The government was hoping that tax cuts, subsidies on child-care expenses, and wage increases would boost consumer confidence with real disposable income to increase by 5.4 per cent. Exports were also expected to pick up in 2002, helped by the weakness of the Swedish krona, which hit record lows against both the dollar and the Euro in 2001.

In 2001, Persson became the first Western leader to visit North Korea when heading European Union delegation talks with then-leader Kim Jong-Il.

=== 2002 election ===
In the 2002 election the Social Democrats increased their number of seats in the parliament primarily at the expense of the Left Party. Persson continued to lead a minority government instead of forming a coalition, despite earlier demands from his supporting parties to participate in the government.

=== 2006 election ===
After the defeat at the general elections of 17 September 2006, Persson immediately filed a request for resignation, and declared his intentions to resign as party leader after a special party congress in March 2007.
On 13 April 2007, Persson also announced his resignation from the Riksdag (where he had served 1979–1985 and from 1991) to be succeeded by Caroline Helmersson Olsson from his native Vingåker.

== After leaving office ==
In October 2007, Persson released his memoirs, &quot;Min väg, mina val&quot; (My path, my choices). 
In March 2007 a documentary series consisting of four one-hour episodes aired on SVT, chronicling Persson&#x27;s time in office. The documentary became controversial due to Persson&#x27;s negative comments about both his party members and staff and against his political opponents.

Persson left his seat in the Riksdag in April 2007. In May 2007 he announced that he would be working as a consultant for the Stockholm-based PR firm JKL in the future. In April 2008 he was installed as chairman of the board of Sveaskog, a forestry business group owned by the Swedish government. He held the post until 2015. In 2019 he became chairman of Swedbank, one of Sweden&#x27;s largest banks.

In late 2008, he became a member of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation, a not-for-profit organization established to monitor tolerance in Europe and prepare recommendations on fighting xenophobia and intolerance on the continent.

In March 2010, Persson was elected to the Board of Directors of World Resources Institute.
== Foreign policy ==

Regarding Sweden&#x27;s membership in the European Union, Persson has been an advocate of an expanded Swedish role in the organization. During Sweden&#x27;s presidency of the EU in the first half of 2001, Persson with assistance from foreign minister Anna Lindh presided over the organization and contributed towards the enlargement which took place in 2004. He advocated for a Swedish entry into the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), however in a 2003 referendum a majority of Swedes voted against joining the EMU.

=== ITF: Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research ===
In 1998, Prime Minister Persson initiated international talks on the establishment of an inter-governmental organisation for Holocaust education, which resulted in the founding of the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research (ITF). The ITF now has 27 Member States.
He had already raised the issue of Holocaust education within the Swedish Parliament, initiating a national information campaign with the aim for &#x27;facts about the Holocaust to form the platform for a discussion on democracy, tolerance and the fact that every human was of equal value.&#x27; The Campaign was entitled Living History, or Levande Historia.

<text>The Việt Minh (, ) is the common and abbreviated name of the League for Independence of Vietnam ( or , ; ), which was a communist-led national independence coalition formed at Pác Bó by Hồ Chí Minh on 19 May 1941. Also known as the Việt Minh Front (), it was created by the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP) as a national united front to achieve the independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The was previously formed by Hồ Học Lãm in Nanjing, China, at some point between August 1935 and early 1936, when Vietnamese nationalist parties formed an anti-imperialist united front. This organization soon lapsed into inactivity, only to be taken over by Hồ Chí Minh and the ICP in 1941. They presented the organization as inclusive of political groups, with a founding charter more nationalist than communist. It exhorted &quot;soldiers, workers, peasants, intellectuals, civil servants, merchants, young men and women&quot; to overthrow &quot;French jackals&quot; and &quot;Japanese fascists&quot;, while the group&#x27;s first chairman was a non-communist. In all, the Việt Minh established itself as the only organized anti-French and anti-Japanese resistance group. The Việt Minh initially formed to seek independence for Vietnam from the French Empire. The United States supported France. When the Japanese occupation began, the Việt Minh opposed Japan with support from the United States and the Republic of China. After World War II, the Việt Minh established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and opposed the re-occupation of Vietnam by France, resulting in the Indochina War, and later opposed South Vietnam and the United States in the Vietnam War. It was also opposed by anti-communist Vietnamese nationalists, such as the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng, the reason for the establishment of the State of Vietnam in 1949.

The political leader of Việt Minh was Hồ Chí Minh. The military leadership was under the command of Võ Nguyên Giáp. Other founders were Lê Duẩn and Phạm Văn Đồng.

The &quot;Việt Nam Độc lập Đồng minh&quot; is not to be confused with the &quot;Việt Nam Cách mệnh Đồng minh Hội&quot; (League for the Vietnamese Revolution, abbreviated as &quot;Việt Cách&quot;) which was founded by Nguyễn Hải Thần. Việt Cách later joined the Vietnamese National Coalition in 1946.

Today, the Vietnam Fatherland Front – a socio-political coalition led by the Communist Party of Vietnam forming the Vietnamese government – is recognized as the modern incarnation of the Việt Minh front in current Vietnamese politics.

== Foundation ==
The League for Independence of Vietnam (Viet Minh) was founded on 19 May 1941 in Pác Bó, Cao Bằng province (in northern Vietnam). Ho Chi Minh was the founder and his Communist Party of Indochina was the main leadership organization within Viet Minh.

== Leadership ==
Ho Chi Minh was the highest leader. Nguyễn Lương Bằng was appointed as the Direct of the General Department (from 1941 to 1951). Hoàng Văn Thụ was appointed as the Secretary of the General Department (from 1941 to 1943 when he was captured by colonial French), and then took over the position (from 1943 to 1951).

Nguyen Luong Bang, Hoang Van Thu and Hoang Quoc Viet were members of the Communist Party.

== Organization ==
At the national level, Viet Minh is governed by the General Department (&quot;Tổng bộ&quot;). Further down there were executive committees in provinces and cities; and executive commissions in communes.

However, due to political turmoil and civil unrest at the time, plus conflicts with Japanese and French forces, the Viet Minh&#x27;s General Department was not completely elected. Hence the details about members of the General Department were very scarce and not fully understood.

Viet Minh established strongholds in northern and central Vietnam. But in southern Vietnam, Viet Minh faced many challengers such as Cao Đài, Hòa Hảo (religious sects) and Bình Xuyên (armed group).

== World War II ==
During World War II, Japan occupied French Indochina. As well as fighting the French in the battles of Khai Phat and Na Ngan, the Việt Minh started a campaign against the Japanese. For instance, a raid at Tam Dao internment camp in Tonkin on 19 July 1945 saw 500 Viet Minh kill fifty Japanese soldiers and officials, freeing French civilian captives and escorting them to the Chinese border. The Viet Minh also fought the Japanese 21st Division in Thái Nguyên, and regularly raided rice storehouses to alleviate the ongoing famine.
As of the end of 1944, the Việt Minh claimed a membership of 500,000, of which 200,000 were in Tonkin, 150,000 in Annam, and 150,000 in Cochinchina. After the Japanese coup d&#x27;état in French Indochina, the Viet Minh and ICP prolifically expanded their activities. They formed national salvation associations (cuu quoc hoi) that, in Quảng Ngãi province alone, enlisted 100,000 peasants by mid-1945. This was backed by the Vanguard Youth (Thanh Nien Tien Phong) in Cochinchina, which expanded to 200,000 by early summer. In the northern provinces of Việt Bắc, their armed forces seized control, after which they distributed lands to the poor, abolished the corvée, established quốc ngữ classes, local village militias, and declared universal suffrage and democratic freedoms.

Due to their opposition to the Japanese, the Việt Minh received funding from the United States, the Soviet Union and the Republic of China. After the August Revolution&#x27;s takeover of nationalist organizations and Emperor Bảo Đại&#x27;s abdication to the Việt Minh, Hồ Chí Minh declared Vietnam&#x27;s independence by proclaiming the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on 2 September 1945.

== First Indochina War ==

Within days, the Chinese Kuomintang (Nationalist) Army arrived in Vietnam to supervise the repatriation of the Imperial Japanese Army. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam therefore existed only in theory and effectively controlled no territory. A few months later, the Chinese, Vietnamese and French came to a three-way understanding. The French gave up certain rights in China, the Việt Minh agreed to the return of the French in exchange for promises of independence within the French Union, and the Chinese agreed to leave. Negotiations between the French and Việt Minh broke down quickly. What followed was nearly ten years of war against France. This was known as the First Indochina War or, to the Vietnamese; &quot;the French War&quot;.

The Việt Minh, who were short on modern military knowledge, created a military school in Quảng Ngãi province in June 1946. More than 400 Vietnamese were trained by Japanese defectors in this school. These soldiers were considered to be students of the Japanese. Later, some of them fought as generals against the United States in the Vietnam War or, to the Vietnamese; &quot;the American War&quot;. Young insurgents of the Việt Minh also received training in the use of modern firearms by some foreign volunteers, such as Stefan Kubiak.

French General Jean Étienne Valluy quickly pushed the Việt Minh out of Hanoi. His French infantry with armored units went through Hanoi, fighting small battles against isolated Việt Minh groups. The French encircled the Việt Minh base, Việt Bắc, in 1947, but failed to defeat the Việt Minh forces, and had to retreat soon after. The campaign is now widely considered a Việt Minh victory over the well-equipped French force.

The Việt Minh continued fighting against the French until 1949, when the border of China and Vietnam was linked together as a result of the campaign called &quot;Chiến dịch Biên giới&quot; (&quot;Borderland Campaign&quot;). The newly communist People&#x27;s Republic of China gave the Việt Minh both sheltered bases and heavy weapons with which to fight the French. With the additional weapons, the Việt Minh were able to take control over many rural areas of the country. Soon after that, they began to advance towards the French-occupied areas.

==Victory and dissolution==
On 7 March 1951, Viet Minh and National United League of Vietnam (&quot;Hội Liên Việt&quot;) merged to form the Vietnamese United Front (Mặt trận Liên Việt). Nonetheless, people continued to call the new front as Viet Minh.

Later the United Front changed into the current Vietnam Fatherland Front (&quot;Mặt trận Tổ quốc Việt Nam&quot;) on 10 September 1955.

Following their defeat at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ, the French began negotiations to leave Vietnam. As a result of peace accords worked out at the Geneva Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, Vietnam was divided into North Vietnam and South Vietnam at the 17th Parallel as a temporary measure until unifying elections could take place in 1956. Transfer of civil administration of North Vietnam to the Viet Minh was given on 11 October 1954. Ho Chi Minh was appointed Prime Minister of North Vietnam, which would be run as a socialist state. Ngo Dinh Diem, who was previously appointed Prime Minister of South Vietnam by Emperor Bao Dại, eventually assumed control of South Vietnam.

The Geneva Accords promised elections in 1956 to determine a national government for a united Vietnam. Neither the United States government nor Ngô Đình Diệm&#x27;s State of Vietnam signed anything at the 1954 Geneva Conference. With respect to the question of reunification, the non-communist Vietnamese delegation objected strenuously to any division of Vietnam, but lost out when the French accepted the proposal of Việt Minh delegate Phạm Văn Đồng, who proposed that Vietnam eventually be united by elections under the supervision of &quot;local commissions&quot;. The United States countered with what became known as the &quot;American Plan&quot;, with the support of South Vietnam and the United Kingdom. It provided for unification elections under the supervision of the United Nations, but was rejected by the Soviet delegation. From his home in France, Vietnamese Emperor Bảo Đại appointed Ngô Đình Diệm as Prime Minister of South Vietnam. With United States support in rigging the referendum of 1955 using secret Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) funding, Diệm removed the Emperor and declared himself the president of the Republic of Vietnam.

The United States believed Ho Chi Minh would win the nationwide election proposed at the Geneva Accords. In a secret memorandum, Director of CIA Allen Dulles acknowledged that &quot;The evidence [shows] that a majority of the people of Vietnam supported the Viet Minh rebels.&quot; Diem refused to hold the elections by citing that the South had not signed and were not bound to the Geneva Accords and that it was impossible to hold free elections in the communist North. Vietnam wide elections never happened and Việt Minh cadres in South Vietnam launched an insurgency against the government. North Vietnam also occupied portions of Laos to assist in supplying the insurgents known as the National Liberation Front (&quot;Viet Cong&quot;) in South Vietnam. The war gradually escalated into the Second Indochina War, more commonly known as the &quot;Vietnam War&quot; in the West and the &quot;American War&quot; in Vietnam.

== Influences on neighbouring countries ==
=== Khmer Việt Minh ===

The Khmer Việt Minh were the 3,000 to 5,000 Cambodian communist cadres, left-wing members of the Khmer Issarak movement regrouped in the United Issarak Front after 1950, most of whom lived in exile in North Vietnam after the 1954 Geneva Conference. Khmer Issarak and United Issarak Front were under leadership of Son Ngoc Minh, Tou Samouth, Sieu Heng, etc. It was a derogatory term used by Norodom Sihanouk, dismissing the Cambodian leftists who had been organizing pro-independence agitations in alliance with the Vietnamese. Sihanouk&#x27;s public criticism and mockery of the Khmer Issarak had the damaging effect of increasing the power of the hardline, anti-Vietnamese, but also anti-monarchist, members of the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK), led by Pol Pot.

The Khmer Issarak and United Issarak Front were instrumental in the foundation of the Cambodian Salvation Front (FUNSK) in 1978. The FUNSK invaded Cambodia along with the Vietnamese Army and overthrew the Democratic Kampuchea Pol Pot state. Many of the Khmer Việt Minh had married Vietnamese women during their long exile in Vietnam.

=== Laotian Việt Minh ===

Lao Issara (&quot;Free Laos&quot;) was a political and military organization of Laotian communists, led by Phetsarath, Souphanouvong, Kaysone Phomvihane, Phoumi Vongvichit. Lao Issara received training and support from Việt Minh. Under French intervention, Lao Issara was split into non-communists and communists. Laotian non-communists under leadership of Pretsarath later established the Kingdom of Laos which was part of the French Union.

However Laotian communists rejected the French offer and fought side by side with Vietnamese communists during the First Indochina War. In 1950, Lao Issara was renamed to Pathet Lao (&quot;Laos Nation&quot;) under leadership of Souphanouvong, Kaysone Phomvihane, Phoumi Vongvichit, etc.

== Notes ==
:A.While the Viet Minh was absorbed into &quot;Lien Viet&quot; at the end of World War II, which itself was absorbed in the &quot;Lao Dong (Communist Party of Vietnam)&quot;, many sources refer to the military movement of the Vietnamese Communist Party as the &quot;Viet Minh&quot; till the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam after the defeat of the French.
