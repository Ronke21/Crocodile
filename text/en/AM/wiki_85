<text>A sundial is a horological device that tells the time of day (referred to as civil time in modern usage) when direct sunlight shines by the apparent position of the Sun in the sky. In the narrowest sense of the word, it consists of a flat plate (the &quot;dial&quot;) and a gnomon, which casts a shadow onto the dial. As the Sun appears to move through the sky, the shadow aligns with different hour-lines, which are marked on the dial to indicate the time of day. The &quot;style&quot; is the time-telling edge of the gnomon, though a single point or &quot;nodus&quot; may be used. The gnomon casts a broad shadow; the shadow of the style shows the time. The gnomon may be a rod, wire, or elaborately decorated metal casting. The style must be parallel to the axis of the Earth&#x27;s rotation for the sundial to be accurate throughout the year. The style&#x27;s angle from horizontal is equal to the sundial&#x27;s geographical latitude.

The term &quot;sundial&quot; can refer to any device that uses the Sun&#x27;s altitude or azimuth (or both) to show the time. Sundials are valued as decorative objects, metaphors, and objects of intrigue and mathematical study.

The passing of time can be observed by placing a stick in the sand or a nail in a board and placing markers at the edge of a shadow or outlining a shadow at intervals. It is common for inexpensive, mass-produced decorative sundials to have incorrectly aligned gnomons, shadow lengths, and hour-lines, which cannot be adjusted to tell correct time.

== Introduction ==

There are several different types of sundials. Some sundials use a shadow or the edge of a shadow while others use a line or spot of light to indicate the time.

The shadow-casting object, known as a &quot;gnomon&quot;, may be a long thin rod or other object with a sharp tip or a straight edge. Sundials employ many types of gnomon. The gnomon may be fixed or moved according to the season. It may be oriented vertically, horizontally, aligned with the Earth&#x27;s axis, or oriented in an altogether different direction determined by mathematics.

Given that sundials use light to indicate time, a line of light may be formed by allowing the Sun&#x27;s rays through a thin slit or focusing them through a cylindrical lens. A spot of light may be formed by allowing the Sun&#x27;s rays to pass through a small hole, window, oculus, or by reflecting them from a small circular mirror. A spot of light can be as small as a pinhole in a solargraph or as large as the oculus in the Pantheon.

Sundials also may use many types of surfaces to receive the light or shadow. Planes are the most common surface, but partial spheres, cylinders, cones and other shapes have been used for greater accuracy or beauty.

Sundials differ in their portability and their need for orientation. The installation of many dials requires knowing the local latitude, the precise vertical direction (e.g., by a level or plumb-bob), and the direction to true north. Portable dials are self-aligning: for example, it may have two dials that operate on different principles, such as a horizontal and analemmatic dial, mounted together on one plate. In these designs, their times agree only when the plate is aligned properly.

Sundials may indicate the local solar time only. To obtain the national clock time, three corrections are required:
# The orbit of the Earth is not perfectly circular and its rotational axis is not perpendicular to its orbit. The sundial&#x27;s indicated solar time thus varies from clock time by small amounts that change throughout the year. This correction—which may be as great as 16 minutes, 33 seconds—is described by the equation of time. A sophisticated sundial, with a curved style or hour lines, may incorporate this correction. The more usual simpler sundials sometimes have a small plaque that gives the offsets at various times of the year.
# The solar time must be corrected for the longitude of the sundial relative to the longitude of the official time zone. For example, an uncorrected sundial located &quot;west&quot; of Greenwich, England but within the same time-zone, shows an &quot;earlier&quot; time than the official time. It may show &quot;11:45&quot; at official noon, and will show &quot;noon&quot; after the official noon. This correction can easily be made by rotating the hour-lines by a constant angle equal to the difference in longitudes, which makes this a commonly possible design option.
# To adjust for daylight saving time, if applicable, the solar time must additionally be shifted for the official difference (usually one hour). This is also a correction that can be done on the dial, i.e. by numbering the hour-lines with two sets of numbers, or even by swapping the numbering in some designs. More often this is simply ignored, or mentioned on the plaque with the other corrections, if there is one.

==Apparent motion of the Sun==

The principles of sundials are understood most easily from the Sun&#x27;s apparent motion. The Earth rotates on its axis, and revolves in an elliptical orbit around the Sun. An excellent approximation assumes that the Sun revolves around a stationary Earth on the celestial sphere, which rotates every 24 hours about its celestial axis. The celestial axis is the line connecting the celestial poles. Since the celestial axis is aligned with the axis about which the Earth rotates, the angle of the axis with the local horizontal is the local geographical latitude.

Unlike the fixed stars, the Sun changes its position on the celestial sphere, being (in the northern hemisphere) at a positive declination in spring and summer, and at a negative declination in autumn and winter, and having exactly zero declination (i.e., being on the celestial equator) at the equinoxes. The Sun&#x27;s celestial longitude also varies, changing by one complete revolution per year. The path of the Sun on the celestial sphere is called the ecliptic. The ecliptic passes through the twelve constellations of the zodiac in the course of a year.

This model of the Sun&#x27;s motion helps to understand sundials. If the shadow-casting gnomon is aligned with the celestial poles, its shadow will revolve at a constant rate, and this rotation will not change with the seasons. This is the most common design. In such cases, the same hour lines may be used throughout the year. The hour-lines will be spaced uniformly if the surface receiving the shadow is either perpendicular (as in the equatorial sundial) or circular about the gnomon (as in the armillary sphere).

In other cases, the hour-lines are not spaced evenly, even though the shadow rotates uniformly. If the gnomon is &quot;not&quot; aligned with the celestial poles, even its shadow will not rotate uniformly, and the hour lines must be corrected accordingly. The rays of light that graze the tip of a gnomon, or which pass through a small hole, or reflect from a small mirror, trace out a cone aligned with the celestial poles. The corresponding light-spot or shadow-tip, if it falls onto a flat surface, will trace out a conic section, such as a hyperbola, ellipse or (at the North or South Poles) a circle.

This conic section is the intersection of the cone of light rays with the flat surface. This cone and its conic section change with the seasons, as the Sun&#x27;s declination changes; hence, sundials that follow the motion of such light-spots or shadow-tips often have different hour-lines for different times of the year. This is seen in shepherd&#x27;s dials, sundial rings, and vertical gnomons such as obelisks. Alternatively, sundials may change the angle or position (or both) of the gnomon relative to the hour lines, as in the analemmatic dial or the Lambert dial.

==History==

The earliest sundials known from the archaeological record are shadow clocks (1500 BC or BCE) from ancient Egyptian astronomy and Babylonian astronomy. Presumably, humans were telling time from shadow-lengths at an even earlier date, but this is hard to verify. In roughly 700 BC, the Old Testament describes a sundial—the “dial of Ahaz” in and . By 240 BC, Eratosthenes had estimated the circumference of the world using an obelisk and a water well and a few centuries later, Ptolemy had charted the latitude of cities using the angle of the sun. The people of Kush created sun dials through geometry. The Roman writer Vitruvius lists dials and shadow clocks known at that time in his &quot;De architectura&quot;. The Tower of the Winds in Athens included both a sundial and a water clock for telling time. A canonical sundial is one that indicates the canonical hours of liturgical acts, and these were used from the 7th to the 14th centuries by religious orders. The Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published a treatise on the sundial in 1570, in which he included instructions for the manufacture and laying out of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. Giuseppe Biancani&#x27;s &quot;Constructio instrumenti ad horologia solaria&quot; (c. 1620) discusses how to make a perfect sundial. They have been in common use since the 16th century.
==Functioning==

In general, sundials indicate the time by casting a shadow or throwing light onto a surface known as a &quot;dial face&quot; or &quot;dial plate&quot;. Although usually a flat plane, the dial face may also be the inner or outer surface of a sphere, cylinder, cone, helix, and various other shapes.

The time is indicated where a shadow or light falls on the dial face, which is usually inscribed with hour lines. Although usually straight, these hour lines may also be curved, depending on the design of the sundial (see below). In some designs, it is possible to determine the date of the year, or it may be required to know the date to find the correct time. In such cases, there may be multiple sets of hour lines for different months, or there may be mechanisms for setting/calculating the month. In addition to the hour lines, the dial face may offer other data—such as the horizon, the equator and the tropics—which are referred to collectively as the dial furniture.

The entire object that casts a shadow or light onto the dial face is known as the sundial&#x27;s &quot;gnomon&quot;. However, it is usually only an edge of the gnomon (or another linear feature) that casts the shadow used to determine the time; this linear feature is known as the sundial&#x27;s &quot;style&quot;. The style is usually aligned parallel to the axis of the celestial sphere, and therefore is aligned with the local geographical meridian. In some sundial designs, only a point-like feature, such as the tip of the style, is used to determine the time and date; this point-like feature is known as the sundial&#x27;s &quot;nodus&quot;.
Some sundials use both a style and a nodus to determine the time and date.

The gnomon is usually fixed relative to the dial face, but not always; in some designs such as the analemmatic sundial, the style is moved according to the month. If the style is fixed, the line on the dial plate perpendicularly beneath the style is called the &quot;substyle&quot;, meaning &quot;below the style&quot;. The angle the style makes with the plane of the dial plate is called the substyle height, an unusual use of the word &quot;height&quot; to mean an &quot;angle&quot;. On many wall dials, the substyle is not the same as the noon line (see below). The angle on the dial plate between the noon line and the substyle is called the &quot;substyle distance&quot;, an unusual use of the word &quot;distance&quot; to mean an &quot;angle&quot;.

By tradition, many sundials have a motto. The motto is usually in the form of an epigram: sometimes sombre reflections on the passing of time and the brevity of life, but equally often humorous witticisms of the dial maker. One such quip is, &quot;I am a sundial, and I make a botch, Of what is done much better by a watch.&quot;

A dial is said to be &quot;equiangular&quot; if its hour-lines are straight and spaced equally. Most equiangular sundials have a fixed gnomon style aligned with the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis, as well as a shadow-receiving surface that is symmetrical about that axis; examples include the equatorial dial, the equatorial bow, the armillary sphere, the cylindrical dial and the conical dial. However, other designs are equiangular, such as the Lambert dial, a version of the analemmatic sundial with a moveable style.

==In the Southern Hemisphere==
A sundial at a particular latitude in one hemisphere must be reversed for use at the opposite latitude in the other hemisphere. A vertical direct south sundial in the Northern Hemisphere becomes a vertical direct north sundial in the Southern Hemisphere. To position a horizontal sundial correctly, one has to find true north or south. The same process can be used to do both. The gnomon, set to the correct latitude, has to point to the true south in the Southern Hemisphere as in the Northern Hemisphere it has to point to the true north. The hour numbers also run in opposite directions, so on a horizontal dial they run anticlockwise (US: counterclockwise) rather than clockwise.

Sundials which are designed to be used with their plates horizontal in one hemisphere can be used with their plates vertical at the complementary latitude in the other hemisphere. For example, the illustrated sundial in Perth, Australia, which is at latitude 32° South, would function properly if it were mounted on a south-facing vertical wall at latitude 58° (i.e. 90° − 32°) North, which is slightly further north than Perth, Scotland. The surface of the wall in Scotland would be parallel with the horizontal ground in Australia (ignoring the difference of longitude), so the sundial would work identically on both surfaces. Correspondingly, the hour marks, which run counterclockwise on a horizontal sundial in the southern hemisphere, also do so on a vertical sundial in the northern hemisphere. (See the first two illustrations at the top of this article.) On horizontal northern-hemisphere sundials, and on vertical southern-hemisphere ones, the hour marks run clockwise.

==Adjustments to calculate clock time from a sundial reading==
The most common reason for a sundial to differ greatly from clock time is that the sundial has not been oriented correctly or its hour lines have not been drawn correctly. For example, most commercial sundials are designed as &quot;horizontal sundials&quot; as described above. To be accurate, such a sundial must have been designed for the local geographical latitude and its style must be parallel to the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis; the style must be aligned with true north and its &quot;height&quot; (its angle with the horizontal) must equal the local latitude. To adjust the style height, the sundial can often be tilted slightly &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; while maintaining the style&#x27;s north-south alignment.

===Summer (daylight saving) time correction===
Some areas of the world practice daylight saving time, which changes the official time, usually by one hour. This shift must be added to the sundial&#x27;s time to make it agree with the official time.

===Time-zone (longitude) correction===
A standard time zone covers roughly 15° of longitude, so any point within that zone which is not on the reference longitude (generally a multiple of 15°) will experience a difference from standard time that is equal to 4 minutes of time per degree. For illustration, sunsets and sunrises are at a much later &quot;official&quot; time at the western edge of a time-zone, compared to sunrise and sunset times at the eastern edge. If a sundial is located at, say, a longitude 5° west of the reference longitude, then its time will read 20 minutes slow, since the Sun appears to revolve around the Earth at 15° per hour. This is a constant correction throughout the year. For equiangular dials such as equatorial, spherical or Lambert dials, this correction can be made by rotating the dial surface by an angle equaling the difference in longitude, without changing the gnomon position or orientation. However, this method does not work for other dials, such as a horizontal dial; the correction must be applied by the viewer.

However, for political and practical reasons, time-zone boundaries have been skewed. At their most extreme, time zones can cause official noon, including daylight savings, to occur up to three hours early (in which case the Sun is actually on the meridian at official clock time of 3 ). This occurs in the far west of Alaska, China, and Spain. For more details and examples, see time zones.

=== Equation of time correction ===


Although the Sun appears to rotate uniformly about the Earth, in reality this motion is not perfectly uniform. This is due to the eccentricity of the Earth&#x27;s orbit (the fact that the Earth&#x27;s orbit about the Sun is not perfectly circular, but slightly elliptical) and the tilt (obliquity) of the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis relative to the plane of its orbit. Therefore, sundial time varies from standard clock time. On four days of the year, the correction is effectively zero. However, on others, it can be as much as a quarter-hour early or late. The amount of correction is described by the equation of time. This correction is equal worldwide: it does not depend on the local latitude or longitude of the observer&#x27;s position. It does, however, change over long periods of time, (centuries or more,)
because of slow variations in the Earth&#x27;s orbital and rotational motions. Therefore, tables and graphs of the equation of time that were made centuries ago are now significantly incorrect. The reading of an old sundial should be corrected by applying the present-day equation of time, not one from the period when the dial was made.

In some sundials, the equation of time correction is provided as an informational plaque affixed to the sundial, for the observer to calculate. In more sophisticated sundials the equation can be incorporated automatically. For example, some equatorial bow sundials are supplied with a small wheel that sets the time of year; this wheel in turn rotates the equatorial bow, offsetting its time measurement. In other cases, the hour lines may be curved, or the equatorial bow may be shaped like a vase, which exploits the changing altitude of the sun over the year to effect the proper offset in time.

A &quot;heliochronometer&quot; is a precision sundial first devised in about 1763 by Philipp Hahn and improved by Abbé Guyoux in about 1827.
It corrects apparent solar time to mean solar time or another standard time. Heliochronometers usually indicate the minutes to within 1 minute of Universal Time.

The Sunquest sundial, designed by Richard L. Schmoyer in the 1950s, uses an analemmic-inspired gnomon to cast a shaft of light onto an equatorial time-scale crescent. Sunquest is adjustable for latitude and longitude, automatically correcting for the equation of time, rendering it &quot;as accurate as most pocket watches&quot;.
Similarly, in place of the shadow of a gnomon the sundial at Miguel Hernández University uses the solar projection of a graph of the equation of time intersecting a time scale to display clock time directly. 

An analemma may be added to many types of sundials to correct apparent solar time to mean solar time or another standard time. These usually have hour lines shaped like &quot;figure eights&quot; (analemmas) according to the equation of time. This compensates for the slight eccentricity in the Earth&#x27;s orbit and the tilt of the Earth&#x27;s axis that causes up to a 15 minute variation from mean solar time. This is a type of dial furniture seen on more complicated horizontal and vertical dials.

Prior to the invention of accurate clocks, in the mid 17th century, sundials were the only timepieces in common use, and were considered to tell the &quot;right&quot; time. The equation of time was not used. After the invention of good clocks, sundials were still considered to be correct, and clocks usually incorrect. The equation of time was used in the opposite direction from today, to apply a correction to the time shown by a clock to make it agree with sundial time. Some elaborate &quot;equation clocks&quot;, such as one made by Joseph Williamson in 1720, incorporated mechanisms to do this correction automatically. (Williamson&#x27;s clock may have been the first-ever device to use a differential gear.) Only after about 1800 was uncorrected clock time considered to be &quot;right&quot;, and sundial time usually &quot;wrong&quot;, so the equation of time became used as it is today.

==With fixed axial gnomon==
The most commonly observed sundials are those in which the shadow-casting style is fixed in position and aligned with the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis, being oriented with true north and south, and making an angle with the horizontal equal to the geographical latitude. This axis is aligned with the celestial poles, which is closely, but not perfectly, aligned with the pole star Polaris. For illustration, the celestial axis points vertically at the true North Pole, whereas it points horizontally on the equator. The world&#x27;s largest axial gnomon sundial is the mast of the Sundial Bridge at Turtle Bay in Redding, California . A formerly world&#x27;s largest gnomon is at Jaipur, raised 26°55′ above horizontal, reflecting the local latitude.

On any given day, the Sun appears to rotate uniformly about this axis, at about 15° per hour, making a full circuit (360°) in 24 hours. A linear gnomon aligned with this axis will cast a sheet of shadow (a half-plane) that, falling opposite to the Sun, likewise rotates about the celestial axis at 15° per hour. The shadow is seen by falling on a receiving surface that is usually flat, but which may be spherical, cylindrical, conical or of other shapes. If the shadow falls on a surface that is symmetrical about the celestial axis (as in an armillary sphere, or an equatorial dial), the surface-shadow likewise moves uniformly; the hour-lines on the sundial are equally spaced. However, if the receiving surface is not symmetrical (as in most horizontal sundials), the surface shadow generally moves non-uniformly and the hour-lines are not equally spaced; one exception is the Lambert dial described below.

Some types of sundials are designed with a fixed gnomon that is not aligned with the celestial poles like a vertical obelisk. Such sundials are covered below under the section, &quot;Nodus-based sundials&quot;.

===Empirical hour-line marking===

The formulas shown in the paragraphs below allow the positions of the hour-lines to be calculated for various types of sundial. In some cases, the calculations are simple; in others they are extremely complicated. There is an alternative, simple method of finding the positions of the hour-lines which can be used for many types of sundial, and saves a lot of work in cases where the calculations are complex. This is an empirical procedure in which the position of the shadow of the gnomon of a real sundial is marked at hourly intervals. The equation of time must be taken into account to ensure that the positions of the hour-lines are independent of the time of year when they are marked. An easy way to do this is to set a clock or watch so it shows &quot;sundial time&quot;
which is standard time, plus the equation of time on the day in question.
The hour-lines on the sundial are marked to show the positions of the shadow of the style when this clock shows whole numbers of hours, and are labelled with these numbers of hours. For example, when the clock reads 5:00, the shadow of the style is marked, and labelled &quot;5&quot; (or &quot;V&quot; in Roman numerals). If the hour-lines are not all marked in a single day, the clock must be adjusted every day or two to take account of the variation of the equation of time.

===Equatorial sundials===


The distinguishing characteristic of the &quot;equatorial dial&quot; (also called the &quot;equinoctial dial&quot;) is the planar surface that receives the shadow, which is exactly perpendicular to the gnomon&#x27;s style. This plane is called equatorial, because it is parallel to the equator of the Earth and of the celestial sphere. If the gnomon is fixed and aligned with the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis, the sun&#x27;s apparent rotation about the Earth casts a uniformly rotating sheet of shadow from the gnomon; this produces a uniformly rotating line of shadow on the equatorial plane. Since the Earth rotates 360° in 24 hours, the hour-lines on an equatorial dial are all spaced 15° apart (360/24).

:formula_1

The uniformity of their spacing makes this type of sundial easy to construct. If the dial plate material is opaque, both sides of the equatorial dial must be marked, since the shadow will be cast from below in winter and from above in summer. With translucent dial plates (e.g. glass) the hour angles need only be marked on the sun-facing side, although the hour numberings (if used) need be made on both sides of the dial, owing to the differing hour schema on the sun-facing and sun-backing sides.

Another major advantage of this dial is that equation of time (EoT) and daylight saving time (DST) corrections can be made by simply rotating the dial plate by the appropriate angle each day. This is because the hour angles are equally spaced around the dial. For this reason, an equatorial dial is often a useful choice when the dial is for public display and it is desirable to have it show the true local time to reasonable accuracy. The EoT correction is made via the relation

: formula_2

Near the equinoxes in spring and autumn, the sun moves on a circle that is nearly the same as the equatorial plane; hence, no clear shadow is produced on the equatorial dial at those times of year, a drawback of the design.

A &quot;nodus&quot; is sometimes added to equatorial sundials, which allows the sundial to tell the time of year. On any given day, the shadow of the nodus moves on a circle on the equatorial plane, and the radius of the circle measures the declination of the sun. The ends of the gnomon bar may be used as the nodus, or some feature along its length. An ancient variant of the equatorial sundial has only a nodus (no style) and the concentric circular hour-lines are arranged to resemble a spider-web.

===Horizontal sundials===
In the &quot;horizontal sundial&quot; (also called a &quot;garden sundial&quot;), the plane that receives the shadow is aligned horizontally, rather than being perpendicular to the style as in the equatorial dial. Hence, the line of shadow does not rotate uniformly on the dial face; rather, the hour lines are spaced according to the rule.

:formula_3

Or in other terms:

:formula_4

where L is the sundial&#x27;s geographical latitude (and the angle the gnomon makes with the dial plate), formula_5 is the angle between a given hour-line and the noon hour-line (which always points towards true north) on the plane, and is the number of hours before or after noon. For example, the angle formula_5 of the 3  hour-line would equal the arctangent of since tan 45° = 1. When formula_7 (at the North Pole), the horizontal sundial becomes an equatorial sundial; the style points straight up (vertically), and the horizontal plane is aligned with the equatorial plane; the hour-line formula becomes formula_8 as for an equatorial dial. A horizontal sundial at the Earth&#x27;s equator, where formula_9 would require a (raised) horizontal style and would be an example of a polar sundial (see below).
The chief advantages of the horizontal sundial are that it is easy to read, and the sunlight lights the face throughout the year. All the hour-lines intersect at the point where the gnomon&#x27;s style crosses the horizontal plane. Since the style is aligned with the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis, the style points true north and its angle with the horizontal equals the sundial&#x27;s geographical latitude  . A sundial designed for one latitude can be adjusted for use at another latitude by tilting its base upwards or downwards by an angle equal to the difference in latitude. For example, a sundial designed for a latitude of 40° can be used at a latitude of 45°, if the sundial plane is tilted upwards by 5°, thus aligning the style with the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis. 

Many ornamental sundials are designed to be used at 45 degrees north. Some mass-produced garden sundials fail to correctly calculate the &quot;hourlines&quot; and so can never be corrected. A local standard time zone is nominally 15 degrees wide, but may be modified to follow geographic or political boundaries. A sundial can be rotated around its style (which must remain pointed at the celestial pole) to adjust to the local time zone. In most cases, a rotation in the range of 7.5° east to 23° west suffices. This will introduce error in sundials that do not have equal hour angles. To correct for daylight saving time, a face needs two sets of numerals or a correction table. An informal standard is to have numerals in hot colors for summer, and in cool colors for winter. Since the hour angles are not evenly spaced, the equation of time corrections cannot be made via rotating the dial plate about the gnomon axis. These types of dials usually have an equation of time correction tabulation engraved on their pedestals or close by. Horizontal dials are commonly seen in gardens, churchyards and in public areas.

===Vertical sundials===
In the common &quot;vertical dial&quot;, the shadow-receiving plane is aligned vertically; as usual, the gnomon&#x27;s style is aligned with the Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation. As in the horizontal dial, the line of shadow does not move uniformly on the face; the sundial is not &quot;equiangular&quot;. If the face of the vertical dial points directly south, the angle of the hour-lines is instead described by the formula:

:formula_10

where is the sundial&#x27;s geographical latitude, formula_11 is the angle between a given hour-line and the noon hour-line (which always points due north) on the plane, and is the number of hours before or after noon. For example, the angle formula_11 of the 3  hour-line would equal the arctangent of since The shadow moves &quot;counter-clockwise&quot; on a south-facing vertical dial, whereas it runs clockwise on horizontal and equatorial north-facing dials.

Dials with faces perpendicular to the ground and which face directly south, north, east, or west are called &quot;vertical direct dials&quot;. It is widely believed, and stated in respectable publications, that a vertical dial cannot receive more than twelve hours of sunlight a day, no matter how many hours of daylight there are. However, there is an exception. Vertical sundials in the tropics which face the nearer pole (e.g. north facing in the zone between the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer) can actually receive sunlight for more than 12 hours from sunrise to sunset for a short period around the time of the summer solstice. For example, at latitude 20° North, on June 21, the sun shines on a north-facing vertical wall for 13 hours, 21 minutes. Vertical sundials which do &quot;not&quot; face directly south (in the northern hemisphere) may receive significantly less than twelve hours of sunlight per day, depending on the direction they do face, and on the time of year. For example, a vertical dial that faces due East can tell time only in the morning hours; in the afternoon, the sun does not shine on its face. Vertical dials that face due East or West are &quot;polar dials&quot;, which will be described below. Vertical dials that face north are uncommon, because they tell time only during the spring and summer, and do not show the midday hours except in tropical latitudes (and even there, only around midsummer). For non-direct vertical dials – those that face in non-cardinal directions – the mathematics of arranging the style and the hour-lines becomes more complicated; it may be easier to mark the hour lines by observation, but the placement of the style, at least, must be calculated first; such dials are said to be &quot;declining dials&quot;.

Vertical dials are commonly mounted on the walls of buildings, such as town-halls, cupolas and church-towers, where they are easy to see from far away. In some cases, vertical dials are placed on all four sides of a rectangular tower, providing the time throughout the day. The face may be painted on the wall, or displayed in inlaid stone; the gnomon is often a single metal bar, or a tripod of metal bars for rigidity. If the wall of the building faces &quot;toward&quot; the south, but does not face due south, the gnomon will not lie along the noon line, and the hour lines must be corrected. Since the gnomon&#x27;s style must be parallel to the Earth&#x27;s axis, it always &quot;points&quot; true north and its angle with the horizontal will equal the sundial&#x27;s geographical latitude; on a direct south dial, its angle with the vertical face of the dial will equal the colatitude, or 90° minus the latitude.

===Polar dials===
In &quot;polar dials&quot;, the shadow-receiving plane is aligned &quot;parallel&quot; to the gnomon-style.
Thus, the shadow slides sideways over the surface, moving perpendicularly to itself as the Sun rotates about the style. As with the gnomon, the hour-lines are all aligned with the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis. When the Sun&#x27;s rays are nearly parallel to the plane, the shadow moves very quickly and the hour lines are spaced far apart. The direct East- and West-facing dials are examples of a polar dial. However, the face of a polar dial need not be vertical; it need only be parallel to the gnomon. Thus, a plane inclined at the angle of latitude (relative to horizontal) under the similarly inclined gnomon will be a polar dial. The perpendicular spacing of the hour-lines in the plane is described by the formula

:formula_13

where is the height of the style above the plane, and is the time (in hours) before or after the center-time for the polar dial. The center time is the time when the style&#x27;s shadow falls directly down on the plane; for an East-facing dial, the center time will be 6 , for a West-facing dial, this will be 6 , and for the inclined dial described above, it will be noon. When approaches ±6 hours away from the center time, the spacing diverges to +∞; this occurs when the Sun&#x27;s rays become parallel to the plane.

===Vertical declining dials===


A &quot;declining dial&quot; is any non-horizontal, planar dial that does not face in a cardinal direction, such as (true) north, south, east or west. As usual, the gnomon&#x27;s style is aligned with the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis, but the hour-lines are not symmetrical about the noon hour-line. For a vertical dial, the angle formula_14 between the noon hour-line and another hour-line is given by the formula below. Note that formula_14 is defined positive in the clockwise sense w.r.t. the upper vertical hour angle; and that its conversion to the equivalent solar hour requires careful consideration of which quadrant of the sundial that it belongs in.

:formula_16

where formula_17 is the sundial&#x27;s geographical latitude; is the time before or after noon; formula_18 is the angle of declination from true south, defined as positive when east of south; and formula_19 is a switch integer for the dial orientation. A partly south-facing dial has an formula_19 value of those partly north-facing, a value of When such a dial faces south (formula_21), this formula reduces to the formula given above for vertical south-facing dials, i.e.

:formula_22

When a sundial is not aligned with a cardinal direction, the substyle of its gnomon is not aligned with the noon hour-line. The angle formula_23 between the substyle and the noon hour-line is given by the formula

:formula_24

If a vertical sundial faces trUe south Or north (formula_25 or formula_26 respectively), the angle formula_27 and the substyle is aligned with the noon hour-line.

The height of the gnomon, that is the angle the style makes to the plate, formula_28 is given by :
:formula_29

===Reclining dials===

The sundials described above have gnomons that are aligned with the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis and cast their shadow onto a plane. If the plane is neither vertical nor horizontal nor equatorial, the sundial is said to be &quot;reclining&quot; or &quot;inclining&quot;. Such a sundial might be located on a south-facing roof, for example. The hour-lines for such a sundial can be calculated by slightly correcting the horizontal formula above

:formula_30

where formula_31 is the desired angle of reclining relative to the local vertical, is the sundial&#x27;s geographical latitude, formula_32 is the angle between a given hour-line and the noon hour-line (which always points due north) on the plane, and is the number of hours before or after noon. For example, the angle formula_32 of the 3pm hour-line would equal the arctangent of since When (in other words, a south-facing vertical dial), we obtain the vertical dial formula above.

Some authors use a more specific nomenclature to describe the orientation of the shadow-receiving plane. If the plane&#x27;s face points downwards towards the ground, it is said to be &quot;proclining&quot; or &quot;inclining&quot;, whereas a dial is said to be &quot;reclining&quot; when the dial face is pointing away from the ground. Many authors also often refer to reclined, proclined and inclined sundials in general as inclined sundials. It is also common in the latter case to measure the angle of inclination relative to the horizontal plane on the sun side of the dial.
In such texts, since formula_34 the hour angle formula will often be seen written as :

:formula_35

The angle between the gnomon style and the dial plate, B, in this type of sundial is :

:formula_36

or :

:formula_37

===Declining-reclining dials/ Declining-inclining dials===

Some sundials both decline and recline, in that their shadow-receiving plane is not oriented with a cardinal direction (such as true north or true south) and is neither horizontal nor vertical nor equatorial. For example, such a sundial might be found on a roof that was not oriented in a cardinal direction.

The formulae describing the spacing of the hour-lines on such dials are rather more complicated than those for simpler dials.

There are various solution approaches, including some using the methods of rotation matrices, and some making a 3D model of the reclined-declined plane and its vertical declined counterpart plane, extracting the geometrical relationships between the hour angle components on both these planes and then reducing the trigonometric algebra.

One system of formulas for Reclining-Declining sundials: (as stated by Fennewick)
The angle formula_38 between the noon hour-line and another hour-line is given by the formula below. Note that formula_38 advances counterclockwise with respect to the zero hour angle for those dials that are partly south-facing and clockwise for those that are north-facing.

:formula_40

within the parameter ranges : formula_41 and formula_42

Or, if preferring to use inclination angle, formula_43 rather than the reclination, formula_44 where formula_45 :

:formula_46

within the parameter ranges : formula_47 and formula_48

Here formula_17 is the sundial&#x27;s geographical latitude; formula_19 is the orientation switch integer; is the time in hours before or after noon; and formula_31 and formula_18 are the angles of reclination and declination, respectively.
Note that formula_31 is measured with reference to the vertical. It is positive when the dial leans back towards the horizon behind the dial and negative when the dial leans forward to the horizon on the Sun&#x27;s side. Declination angle formula_18 is defined as positive when moving east of true south.
Dials facing fully or partly south have formula_55 while those partly or fully north-facing have an formula_56
Since the above expression gives the hour angle as an arctangent function, due consideration must be given to which quadrant of the sundial each hour belongs to before assigning the correct hour angle.

Unlike the simpler vertical declining sundial, this type of dial does not always show hour angles on its sunside face for all declinations between east and west. When a northern hemisphere partly south-facing dial reclines back (i.e. away from the Sun) from the vertical, the gnomon will become co-planar with the dial plate at declinations less than due east or due west. Likewise for southern hemisphere dials that are partly north-facing.
Were these dials reclining forward, the range of declination would actually exceed due east and due west.
In a similar way, northern hemisphere dials that are partly north-facing and southern hemisphere dials that are south-facing, and which lean forward toward their upward pointing gnomons, will have a similar restriction on the range of declination that is possible for a given reclination value.
The critical declination formula_57 is a geometrical constraint which depends on the value of both the dial&#x27;s reclination and its latitude :

:formula_58

As with the vertical declined dial, the gnomon&#x27;s substyle is not aligned with the noon hour-line. The general formula for the angle formula_59 between the substyle and the noon-line is given by :

:formula_60

The angle formula_28 between the style and the plate is given by :

:formula_62

Note that for formula_63 i.e. when the gnomon is coplanar with the dial plate, we have :

:formula_64

i.e. when formula_65 the critical declination value.

====Empirical method====
Because of the complexity of the above calculations, using them for the practical purpose of designing a dial of this type is difficult and prone to error. It has been suggested that it is better to locate the hour lines empirically, marking the positions of the shadow of a style on a real sundial at hourly intervals as shown by a clock and adding/deducting that day&#x27;s equation of time adjustment. See Empirical hour-line marking, above.

===Spherical sundials===
The surface receiving the shadow need not be a plane, but can have any shape, provided that the sundial maker is willing to mark the hour-lines. If the style is aligned with the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis, a spherical shape is convenient since the hour-lines are equally spaced, as they are on the equatorial dial shown here; the sundial is &quot;equiangular&quot;. This is the principle behind the armillary sphere and the equatorial bow sundial. However, some equiangular sundials – such as the Lambert dial described below – are based on other principles.

In the &quot;equatorial bow sundial&quot;, the gnomon is a bar, slot or stretched wire parallel to the celestial axis. The face is a semicircle, corresponding to the equator of the sphere, with markings on the inner surface. This pattern, built a couple of meters wide out of temperature-invariant steel invar, was used to keep the trains running on time in France before World War I.

Among the most precise sundials ever made are two equatorial bows constructed of marble found in Yantra mandir. This collection of sundials and other astronomical instruments was built by Maharaja Jai Singh II at his then-new capital of Jaipur, India between 1727 and 1733. The larger equatorial bow is called the &quot;Samrat Yantra&quot; (The Supreme Instrument); standing at 27 meters, its shadow moves visibly at 1 mm per second, or roughly a hand&#x27;s breadth (6 cm) every minute.

===Cylindrical, conical, and other non-planar sundials===

Other non-planar surfaces may be used to receive the shadow of the gnomon.
As an elegant alternative, the style (which could be created by a hole or slit in the circumference) may be located on the circumference of a cylinder or sphere, rather than at its central axis of symmetry.

In that case, the hour lines are again spaced equally, but at &quot;twice&quot; the usual angle, due to the geometrical inscribed angle theorem. This is the basis of some modern sundials, but it was also used in ancient times;

In another variation of the polar-axis-aligned cylindrical, a cylindrical dial could be rendered as a helical ribbon-like surface, with a thin gnomon located either along its center or at its periphery.

==Movable-gnomon sundials==
Sundials can be designed with a gnomon that is placed in a different position each day throughout the year. In other words, the position of the gnomon relative to the centre of the hour lines varies. The gnomon need not be aligned with the celestial poles and may even be perfectly vertical (the analemmatic dial). These dials, when combined with fixed-gnomon sundials, allow the user to determine true north with no other aid; the two sundials are correctly aligned if and only if they both show the same time. 

===Universal equinoctial ring dial===

A &quot;universal equinoctial ring dial&quot; (sometimes called a &quot;ring dial&quot; for brevity, although the term is ambiguous), is a portable version of an armillary sundial, or was inspired by the mariner&#x27;s astrolabe. It was likely invented by William Oughtred around 1600 and became common throughout Europe.
In its simplest form, the style is a thin slit that allows the Sun&#x27;s rays to fall on the hour-lines of an equatorial ring. As usual, the style is aligned with the Earth&#x27;s axis; to do this, the user may orient the dial towards true north and suspend the ring dial vertically from the appropriate point on the meridian ring. Such dials may be made self-aligning with the addition of a more complicated central bar, instead of a simple slit-style. These bars are sometimes an addition to a set of Gemma&#x27;s rings. This bar could pivot about its end points and held a perforated slider that was positioned to the month and day according to a scale scribed on the bar. The time was determined by rotating the bar towards the Sun so that the light shining through the hole fell on the equatorial ring. This forced the user to rotate the instrument, which had the effect of aligning the instrument&#x27;s vertical ring with the meridian.

When not in use, the equatorial and meridian rings can be folded together into a small disk.
In 1610, Edward Wright created the sea ring, which mounted a universal ring dial over a magnetic compass. This permitted mariners to determine the time and magnetic variation in a single step.

===Analemmatic sundials===

Analemmatic sundials are a type of horizontal sundial that has a vertical gnomon and hour markers positioned in an elliptical pattern. There are no hour lines on the dial and the time of day is read on the ellipse. The gnomon is not fixed and must change position daily to accurately indicate time of day.
Analemmatic sundials are sometimes designed with a human as the gnomon. Human gnomon analemmatic sundials are not practical at lower latitudes where a human shadow is quite short during the summer months. A 66 inch tall person casts a 4 inch shadow at 27° latitude on the summer solstice.

===Foster-Lambert dials===
The Foster-Lambert dial is another movable-gnomon sundial. In contrast to the elliptical analemmatic dial, the Lambert dial is circular with evenly spaced hour lines, making it an &quot;equiangular sundial&quot;, similar to the equatorial, spherical, cylindrical and conical dials described above. The gnomon of a Foster-Lambert dial is neither vertical nor aligned with the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis; rather, it is tilted northwards by an angle α = 45° - (Φ/2), where Φ is the geographical latitude. Thus, a Foster-Lambert dial located at latitude 40° would have a gnomon tilted away from vertical by 25° in a northerly direction. To read the correct time, the gnomon must also be moved northwards by a distance

:formula_66

where &quot;R&quot; is the radius of the Foster-Lambert dial and δ again indicates the Sun&#x27;s declination for that time of year.

==Altitude-based sundials==

Altitude dials measure the height of the Sun in the sky, rather than directly measuring its hour-angle about the Earth&#x27;s axis. They are not oriented towards true north, but rather towards the Sun and generally held vertically. The Sun&#x27;s elevation is indicated by the position of a nodus, either the shadow-tip of a gnomon, or a spot of light.

In altitude dials, the time is read from where the nodus falls on a set of hour-curves that vary with the time of year. Many such altitude-dials&#x27; construction is calculation-intensive, as also the case with many azimuth dials. But the capuchin dials (described below) are constructed and used graphically.

Altitude dials&#x27; disadvantages:

Since the Sun&#x27;s altitude is the same at times equally spaced about noon (e.g., 9am and 3pm), the user had to know whether it was morning or afternoon. At, say, 3:00 pm, that is not a problem. But when the dial indicates a time 15 minutes from noon, the user likely will not have a way of distinguishing 11:45 from 12:15.

Additionally, altitude dials are less accurate near noon, because the sun&#x27;s altitude is not changing rapidly then.
Many of these dials are portable and simple to use. As is often the case with other sundials, many altitude dials are designed for only one latitude. But the capuchin dial (described below) has a version that&#x27;s adjustable for latitude.

 describe the Universal Capuchin sundial.

===Human shadows===
The length of a human shadow (or of any vertical object) can be used to measure the sun&#x27;s elevation and, thence, the time. The Venerable Bede gave a table for estimating the time from the length of one&#x27;s shadow in feet, on the assumption that a monk&#x27;s height is six times the length of his foot. Such shadow lengths will vary with the geographical latitude and with the time of year. For example, the shadow length at noon is short in summer months, and long in winter months.
Chaucer evokes this method a few times in his &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, as in his &quot;Parson&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

An equivalent type of sundial using a vertical rod of fixed length is known as a &quot;backstaff dial&quot;.

===Shepherd&#x27;s dial – timesticks===

A shepherd&#x27;s dial – also known as a &quot;shepherd&#x27;s column dial&quot;, &quot;pillar dial&quot;, &quot;cylinder dial&quot; or &quot;chilindre&quot; – is a portable cylindrical sundial with a knife-like gnomon that juts out perpendicularly. It is normally dangled from a rope or string so the cylinder is vertical. The gnomon can be twisted to be above a month or day indication on the face of the cylinder. This corrects the sundial for the equation of time. The entire sundial is then twisted on its string so that the gnomon aims toward the Sun, while the cylinder remains vertical. The tip of the shadow indicates the time on the cylinder. The hour curves inscribed on the cylinder permit one to read the time. Shepherd&#x27;s dials are sometimes hollow, so that the gnomon can fold within when not in use.

The shepherd&#x27;s dial is evoked in &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;,
among other works of literature.

The cylindrical shepherd&#x27;s dial can be unrolled into a flat plate. In one simple version, the front and back of the plate each have three columns, corresponding to pairs of months with roughly the same solar declination (June:July, May:August, April:September, March:October, February:November, and January:December). The top of each column has a hole for inserting the shadow-casting gnomon, a peg. Often only two times are marked on the column below, one for noon and the other for mid-morning / mid-afternoon.

Timesticks, &quot;clock spear&quot;, or &quot;shepherds&#x27; time stick&quot;, are based on the same principles as dials. The time stick is carved with eight vertical time scales for a different period of the year, each bearing a time scale calculated according to the relative amount of daylight during the different months of the year. Any reading depends not only on the time of day but also on the latitude and time of year.
A peg gnomon is inserted at the top in the appropriate hole or face for the season of the year, and turned to the Sun so that the shadow falls directly down the scale. Its end displays the time.

===Ring dials===
In a ring dial (also known as an &quot;Aquitaine&quot; or a &quot;perforated ring dial&quot;), the ring is hung vertically and oriented sideways towards the sun. A beam of light passes through a small hole in the ring and falls on hour-curves that are inscribed on the inside of the ring. To adjust for the equation of time, the hole is usually on a loose ring within the ring so that the hole can be adjusted to reflect the current month.

===Card dials (Capuchin dials)===
Card dials are another form of altitude dial. A card is aligned edge-on with the sun and tilted so that a ray of light passes through an aperture onto a specified spot, thus determining the sun&#x27;s altitude. A weighted string hangs vertically downwards from a hole in the card, and carries a bead or knot. The position of the bead on the hour-lines of the card gives the time. In more sophisticated versions such as the Capuchin dial, there is only one set of hour-lines, i.e., the hour lines do not vary with the seasons. Instead, the position of the hole from which the weighted string hangs is varied according to the season.

The Capuchin sundials are constructed and used graphically, as opposed the direct hour-angle measurements of horizontal or equatorial dials; or the calculated hour angle lines of some altitude and azimuth dials.

In addition to the ordinary Capuchin dial, there is a universal Capuchin dial, adjustable for latitude.

===Navicula===
A navicula de Venetiis or &quot;little ship of Venice&quot; was an altitude dial used to tell time and which was shaped like a little ship. The cursor (with a plumb line attached) was slid up / down the mast to the correct latitude. The user then sighted the Sun through the pair of sighting holes at either end of the &quot;ship&#x27;s deck&quot;. The plumb line then marked what hour of the day it was.

==Nodus-based sundials==
Another type of sundial follows the motion of a single point of light or shadow, which may be called the &quot;nodus&quot;. For example, the sundial may follow the sharp tip of a gnomon&#x27;s shadow, e.g., the shadow-tip of a vertical obelisk (e.g., the &quot;Solarium Augusti&quot;) or the tip of the horizontal marker in a shepherd&#x27;s dial. Alternatively, sunlight may be allowed to pass through a small hole or reflected from a small (e.g., coin-sized) circular mirror, forming a small spot of light whose position may be followed. In such cases, the rays of light trace out a cone over the course of a day; when the rays fall on a surface, the path followed is the intersection of the cone with that surface. Most commonly, the receiving surface is a geometrical plane, so that the path of the shadow-tip or light-spot (called &quot;declination line&quot;) traces out a conic section such as a hyperbola or an ellipse. The collection of hyperbolae was called a &quot;pelekonon&quot; (axe) by the Greeks, because it resembles a double-bladed ax, narrow in the center (near the noonline) and flaring out at the ends (early morning and late evening hours).

There is a simple verification of hyperbolic declination lines on a sundial: the distance from the origin to the equinox line should be equal to harmonic mean of distances from the origin to summer and winter solstice lines.

Nodus-based sundials may use a small hole or mirror to isolate a single ray of light; the former are sometimes called &quot;aperture dials&quot;. The oldest example is perhaps the antiborean sundial (&quot;antiboreum&quot;), a spherical nodus-based sundial that faces true north; a ray of sunlight enters from the south through a small hole located at the sphere&#x27;s pole and falls on the hour and date lines inscribed within the sphere, which resemble lines of longitude and latitude, respectively, on a globe.

===Reflection sundials===
Isaac Newton developed a convenient and inexpensive sundial, in which a small mirror is placed on the sill of a south-facing window. The mirror acts like a nodus, casting a single spot of light on the ceiling. Depending on the geographical latitude and time of year, the light-spot follows a conic section, such as the hyperbolae of the pelikonon. If the mirror is parallel to the Earth&#x27;s equator, and the ceiling is horizontal, then the resulting angles are those of a conventional horizontal sundial. Using the ceiling as a sundial surface exploits unused space, and the dial may be large enough to be very accurate.

==Multiple dials==
Sundials are sometimes combined into multiple dials. If two or more dials that operate on different principles — such as an analemmatic dial and a horizontal or vertical dial — are combined, the resulting multiple dial becomes self-aligning, most of the time. Both dials need to output both time and declination. In other words, the direction of true north need not be determined; the dials are oriented correctly when they read the same time and declination. However, the most common forms combine dials are based on the same principle and the analemmatic does not normally output the declination of the sun, thus are not self-aligning.

===Diptych (tablet) sundial===
The diptych consisted of two small flat faces, joined by a hinge. Diptychs usually folded into little flat boxes suitable for a pocket. The gnomon was a string between the two faces. When the string was tight, the two faces formed both a vertical and horizontal sundial. These were made of white ivory, inlaid with black lacquer markings. The gnomons were black braided silk, linen or hemp string. With a knot or bead on the string as a nodus, and the correct markings, a diptych (really any sundial large enough) can keep a calendar well-enough to plant crops. A common error describes the diptych dial as self-aligning. This is not correct for diptych dials consisting of a horizontal and vertical dial using a string gnomon between faces, no matter the orientation of the dial faces. Since the string gnomon is continuous, the shadows must meet at the hinge; hence, &quot;any&quot; orientation of the dial will show the same time on both dials.

===Multiface dials===

A common type of multiple dial has sundials on every face of a Platonic solid (regular polyhedron), usually a cube.

Extremely ornate sundials can be composed in this way, by applying a sundial to every surface of a solid object.

In some cases, the sundials are formed as hollows in a solid object, e.g., a cylindrical hollow aligned with the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis (in which the edges play the role of styles) or a spherical hollow in the ancient tradition of the &quot;hemisphaerium&quot; or the &quot;antiboreum&quot;. (See the History section above.) In some cases, these multiface dials are small enough to sit on a desk, whereas in others, they are large stone monuments.

A Polyhedral&#x27;s dial faces can be designed to give the time for different time-zones simultaneously. Examples include the Scottish sundial of the 17th and 18th centuries, which was often an extremely complex shape of polyhedral, and even convex faces.

===Prismatic dials===
Prismatic dials are a special case of polar dials, in which the sharp edges of a prism of a concave polygon serve as the styles and the sides of the prism receive the shadow. Examples include a three-dimensional cross or star of David on gravestones.

==Unusual sundials==

===Benoy dial===

The Benoy dial was invented by Walter Gordon Benoy of Collingham, Nottinghamshire, England. Whereas a gnomon casts a sheet of shadow, his invention creates an equivalent sheet of light by allowing the Sun&#x27;s rays through a thin slit, reflecting them from a long, slim mirror (usually half-cylindrical), or focusing them through a cylindrical lens. Examples of Benoy dials can be found in the United Kingdom at:
*Carnfunnock Country Park, Antrim Northern Ireland
*Upton Hall, British Horological Institute, Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire
*Within the collections of St Edmundsbury Heritage Service, Bury St Edmunds
*Longleat, Wiltshire
* Jodrell Bank Science Centre
* Birmingham Botanical Gardens
* Science Museum, London (inventory number 1975-318)

===Bifilar sundial===
Invented by the German mathematician Hugo Michnik in 1922, the bifilar sundial has two non-intersecting threads parallel to the dial. Usually the second thread is orthogonal to the first.
The intersection of the two threads&#x27; shadows gives the local solar time.

===Digital sundial===

A digital sundial indicates the current time with numerals formed by the sunlight striking it. Sundials of this type are installed in the Deutsches Museum in Munich and in the Sundial Park in Genk (Belgium), and a small version is available commercially. There is a patent for this type of sundial.

===Globe dial===
The globe dial is a sphere aligned with the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis, and equipped with a spherical vane. Similar to sundials with a fixed axial style, a globe dial determines the time from the Sun&#x27;s azimuthal angle in its apparent rotation about the earth. This angle can be determined by rotating the vane to give the smallest shadow.

===Noon marks===

The simplest sundials do not give the hours, but rather note the exact moment of 12:00 noon. In centuries past, such dials were used to set mechanical clocks, which were sometimes so inaccurate as to lose or gain significant time in a single day. The simplest noon-marks have a shadow that passes a mark. Then, an almanac can translate from local solar time and date to civil time. The civil time is used to set the clock. Some noon-marks include a figure-eight that embodies the equation of time, so that no almanac is needed.

In some U.S. colonial-era houses, a noon-mark might be carved into a floor or windowsill. Such marks indicate local noon, and provide a simple and accurate time reference for households to set their clocks. Some Asian countries had post offices set their clocks from a precision noon-mark. These in turn provided the times for the rest of the society. The typical noon-mark sundial was a lens set above an analemmatic plate. The plate has an engraved figure-eight shape, which corresponds to the equation of time (described above) versus the solar declination. When the edge of the Sun&#x27;s image touches the part of the shape for the current month, this indicates that it is 12:00 noon.

===Sundial cannon===

A sundial cannon, sometimes called a &#x27;meridian cannon&#x27;, is a specialized sundial that is designed to create an &#x27;audible noonmark&#x27;, by automatically igniting a quantity of gunpowder at noon. These were novelties rather than precision sundials, sometimes installed in parks in Europe mainly in the late 18th or early 19th centuries. They typically consist of a horizontal sundial, which has in addition to a gnomon a suitably mounted lens, set to focus the rays of the sun at exactly noon on the firing pan of a miniature cannon loaded with gunpowder (but no ball). To function properly the position and angle of the lens must be adjusted seasonally.

==Meridian lines==

A horizontal line aligned on a meridian with a gnomon facing the noon-sun is termed a meridian line and does not indicate the time, but instead the day of the year. Historically they were used to accurately determine the length of the solar year. Examples are the Bianchini meridian line in Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri in Rome, and the Cassini line in San Petronio Basilica at Bologna.

==Sundial mottoes==

The association of sundials with time has inspired their designers over the centuries to display mottoes as part of the design. Often these cast the device in the role of &quot;memento mori&quot;, inviting the observer to reflect on the transience of the world and the inevitability of death. &quot;Do not kill time, for it will surely kill thee.&quot; Other mottoes are more whimsical: &quot;I count only the sunny hours,&quot; and &quot;I am a sundial and I make a botch / of what is done far better by a watch.&quot; Collections of sundial mottoes have often been published through the centuries.

==Use as a compass==

If a horizontal-plate sundial is made for the latitude in which it is being used, and if it is mounted with its plate horizontal and its gnomon pointing to the celestial pole that is above the horizon, then it shows the correct time in apparent solar time. Conversely, if the directions of the cardinal points are initially unknown, but the sundial is aligned so it shows the correct apparent solar time as calculated from the reading of a clock, its gnomon shows the direction of True north or south, allowing the sundial to be used as a compass. The sundial can be placed on a horizontal surface, and rotated about a vertical axis until it shows the correct time. The gnomon will then be pointing to the north, in the northern hemisphere, or to the south in the southern hemisphere. This method is much more accurate than using a watch as a compass and can be used in places where the magnetic declination is large, making a magnetic compass unreliable. An alternative method uses two sundials of different designs. (See #Multiple dials, above.) The dials are attached to and aligned with each other, and are oriented so they show the same time. This allows the directions of the cardinal points and the apparent solar time to be determined simultaneously, without requiring a clock.

<text>Marin Mersenne, OM (also known as Marinus Mersennus or &quot;le Père&quot; Mersenne; ; 8 September 1588 – 1 September 1648) was a French polymath whose works touched a wide variety of fields. He is perhaps best known today among mathematicians for Mersenne prime numbers, those written in the form for some integer . He also developed Mersenne&#x27;s laws, which describe the harmonics of a vibrating string (such as may be found on guitars and pianos), and his seminal work on music theory, &quot;Harmonie universelle&quot;, for which he is referred to as the &quot;father of acoustics&quot;. Mersenne, an ordained Catholic priest, had many contacts in the scientific world and has been called &quot;the center of the world of science and mathematics during the first half of the 1600s&quot; and, because of his ability to make connections between people and ideas, &quot;the post-box of Europe&quot;. He was also a member of the ascetical Minim religious order and wrote and lectured on theology and philosophy.

==Life==
Mersenne was born of Jeanne Moulière, wife of Julien Mersenne, peasants who lived near Oizé, County of Maine (present-day Sarthe, France). He was educated at Le Mans and at the Jesuit College of La Flèche. On 17 July 1611, he joined the Minim Friars and, after studying theology and Hebrew in Paris, was ordained a priest in 1613.

Between 1614 and 1618, he taught theology and philosophy at Nevers, but he returned to Paris and settled at the convent of L&#x27;Annonciade in 1620. There he studied mathematics and music and met with other kindred spirits such as René Descartes, Étienne Pascal, Pierre Petit, Gilles de Roberval, Thomas Hobbes, and Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc. He corresponded with Giovanni Doni, Jacques Alexandre Le Tenneur, Constantijn Huygens, Galileo Galilei, and other scholars in Italy, England and the Dutch Republic. He was a staunch defender of Galileo, assisting him in translations of some of his mechanical works.

For four years, Mersenne devoted himself entirely to philosophic and theological writing, and published &quot;Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim&quot; (&quot;Celebrated Questions on the Book of Genesis&quot;) (1623); &quot;L&#x27;Impieté des déistes&quot; (&quot;The Impiety of the Deists&quot;) (1624); &quot;La Vérité des sciences&quot; (&quot;Truth of the Sciences Against the Sceptics&quot;, 1624). It is sometimes incorrectly stated that he was a Jesuit. He was educated by Jesuits, but he never joined the Society of Jesus. He taught theology and philosophy at Nevers and Paris.

In 1635 he set up the informal &quot;Académie Parisienne&quot; (Academia Parisiensis), which had nearly 140 correspondents, including astronomers and philosophers as well as mathematicians, and was the precursor of the Académie des sciences established by Jean-Baptiste Colbert in 1666. He was not afraid to cause disputes among his learned friends in order to compare their views, notable among which were disputes between Descartes, Pierre de Fermat, and Jean de Beaugrand. Peter L. Bernstein, in his book &quot;Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk&quot;, wrote, &quot;The Académie des Sciences in Paris and the Royal Society in London, which were founded about twenty years after Mersenne&#x27;s death, were direct descendants of Mersenne&#x27;s activities.&quot;

In 1635 Mersenne met with Tommaso Campanella but concluded that he could &quot;teach nothing in the sciences ... but still he has a good memory and a fertile imagination.&quot; Mersenne asked if Descartes wanted Campanella to come to Holland to meet him, but Descartes declined. He visited Italy fifteen times, in 1640, 1641 and 1645. In 1643–1644 Mersenne also corresponded with the German Socinian Marcin Ruar concerning the Copernican ideas of Pierre Gassendi, finding Ruar already a supporter of Gassendi&#x27;s position. Among his correspondents were Descartes, Galileo, Roberval, Pascal, Beeckman and other scientists.

He died on 1 September 1648 of complications arising from a lung abscess.

=== Work ===

&quot;Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim&quot; was written as a commentary on the Book of Genesis and comprises uneven sections headed by verses from the first three chapters of that book. At first sight the book appears to be a collection of treatises on various miscellaneous topics. However Robert Lenoble has shown that the principle of unity in the work is a polemic against magical and divinatory arts, cabalism, and animistic and pantheistic philosophies.

Mersenne was concerned with the teachings of some Italian naturalists that all things happened naturally and determined astrologically; for example, the nomological determinism of Lucilio Vanini (&quot;God acts on sublunary beings (humans) using the sky as a tool&quot;), and Gerolamo Cardano&#x27;s idea that martyrs and heretic were compelled to self-harm by the stars; Historian of science William Ashworth explains &quot;Miracles, for example, were endangered by the naturalists, because in a world filled with sympathies and occult forces—with what Lenoble calls a &quot;spontanéité indéfinie&quot;—anything could happen naturally&quot;. 

Mersenne mentions Martin Del Rio&#x27;s &quot;Investigations into Magic&quot; and criticises Marsilio Ficino for claiming power for images and characters. He condemns astral magic and astrology and the &quot;anima mundi&quot;, a concept popular amongst Renaissance neo-platonists. Whilst allowing for a mystical interpretation of the Cabala, he wholeheartedly condemned its magical application, particularly angelology. He also criticises Pico della Mirandola, Cornelius Agrippa, Francesco Giorgio and Robert Fludd, his main target.

&quot;Harmonie universelle&quot; is perhaps Mersenne&#x27;s most influential work. It is one of the earliest comprehensive works on music theory, touching on a wide range of musical concepts, and especially the mathematical relationships involved in music. The work contains the earliest formulation of what has become known as Mersenne&#x27;s laws, which describe the frequency of oscillation of a stretched string. This frequency is:
# Inversely proportional to the length of the string (this was known to the ancients; it is usually credited to Pythagoras)
# Proportional to the square root of the stretching force, and
# Inversely proportional to the square root of the mass per unit length.

The formula for the lowest frequency is

:formula_1

where &quot;f&quot; is the frequency [Hz], &quot;L&quot; is the length [m], &quot;F&quot; is the force [N] and μ is the mass per unit length [kg/m].

In this book, Mersenne also introduced several innovative concepts that can be considered the basis of modern reflecting telescopes:
* Much earlier than Laurent Cassegrain, he found the fundamental arrangement of the two-mirror telescope combination, a concave primary mirror associated with a convex secondary mirror, and discovered the telephoto effect that is critical in reflecting telescopes, although he was far from having understood all the implications of that discovery. 
* Mersenne invented the afocal telescope and the beam compressor that is useful in many multiple-mirror telescope designs.
* He recognized also that he could correct the spherical aberration of the telescope by using aspherical mirrors and that in the particular case of the afocal arrangement he could do this correction by using two parabolic mirrors, though a hyperboloid is required.

Because of criticism that he encountered, especially from Descartes, Mersenne made no attempt to build a telescope of his own.

Mersenne is also remembered today thanks to his association with the Mersenne primes. The Mersenne Twister, named for Mersenne primes, is frequently used in computer engineering and in related fields such as cryptography.

However, Mersenne was not primarily a mathematician; he wrote about music theory and other subjects. He edited works of Euclid, Apollonius, Archimedes, and other Greek mathematicians. But perhaps his most important contribution to the advance of learning was his extensive correspondence (in Latin) with mathematicians and other scientists in many countries. At a time when the scientific journal had not yet come into being, Mersenne was the centre of a network for exchange of information.

It has been argued that Mersenne used his lack of mathematical specialty, his ties to the print world, his legal acumen, and his friendship with the French mathematician and philosopher René Descartes (1596–1650) to manifest his international network of mathematicians.

Mersenne&#x27;s philosophical works are characterized by wide scholarship and the narrowest theological orthodoxy. His greatest service to philosophy was his enthusiastic defence of Descartes, whose agent he was in Paris and whom he visited in exile in the Netherlands. He submitted to various eminent Parisian thinkers a manuscript copy of the &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;, and defended its orthodoxy against numerous clerical critics.

In later life, he gave up speculative thought and turned to scientific research, especially in mathematics, physics and astronomy. In this connection, his best known work is &quot;Harmonie universelle&quot; of 1636, dealing with the theory of music and musical instruments. It is regarded as a source of information on 17th-century music, especially French music and musicians, to rival even the works of Pietro Cerone.

One of his many contributions to musical tuning theory was the suggestion of
: formula_2
as the ratio for an equally-tempered semitone (formula_3). It was more accurate (0.44 cents sharp) than Vincenzo Galilei&#x27;s 18/17 (1.05 cents flat), and could be constructed using straightedge and compass. Mersenne&#x27;s description in the 1636 &quot;Harmonie universelle&quot; of the first absolute determination of the frequency of an audible tone (at 84 Hz) implies that he had already demonstrated that the absolute-frequency ratio of two vibrating strings, radiating a musical tone and its octave, is 1 : 2. The perceived harmony (consonance) of two such notes would be explained if the ratio of the air oscillation frequencies is also 1 : 2, which in turn is consistent with the source-air-motion-frequency-equivalence hypothesis.

He also performed extensive experiments to determine the acceleration of falling objects by comparing them with the swing of pendulums, reported in his &quot;Cogitata Physico-Mathematica&quot; in 1644. He was the first to measure the length of the seconds pendulum, that is a pendulum whose swing takes one second, and the first to observe that a pendulum&#x27;s swings are not isochronous as Galileo thought, but that large swings take longer than small swings.

===Battles with occult and mystical thinkers===
Two German pamphlets that circulated around Europe in 1614–15, &quot;Fama fraternitatis&quot; and &quot;Confessio Fraternitatis&quot;, claimed to be manifestos of a highly select, secret society of alchemists and sages called the Brotherhood of Rosicrucians. The books were allegories, but were obviously written by a small group who were reasonably knowledgeable about the sciences of the day, and their main theme was to promote educational reform (they were anti-Aristotelian). These pamphlets also promoted an occult view of science containing elements of Paracelsian philosophy, neo-Platonism, Christian Cabala and Hermeticism. In effect, they sought to establish a new form of scientific religion with some pre-Christian elements.

Mersenne led the fight against acceptance of these ideas, particularly those of Rosicrucian promoter Robert Fludd, who had a lifelong battle of words with Johannes Kepler. Fludd responded with &quot;Sophia cum moria certamen&quot; (1626), wherein he discusses his involvement with the Rosicrucians. The anonymous &quot;Summum bonum&quot; (1629), another critique of Mersenne, is a Rosicrucian-themed text. The cabalist Jacques Gaffarel joined Fludd&#x27;s side, while Pierre Gassendi defended Mersenne.

The Rosicrucian ideas were defended by many prominent men of learning, and some members of the European scholarly community boosted their own prestige by claiming to be among the selected members of the Brotherhood. However, it is now generally agreed among historians that there is no evidence that an order of Rosicrucians existed at the time, with later Rosicrucian Orders drawing on the name, with no relation to the writers of the Rosicrucian Manifestoes.

During the mid-1630s Mersenne gave up the search for physical causes in the Aristotelian sense (rejecting the idea of &quot;essences&quot;, which were still favoured by the scholastic philosophers) and taught that true physics could be only a descriptive science of motions (&quot;Mécanisme&quot;), which was the direction set by Galileo Galilei. Mersenne had been a regular correspondent with Galileo and had extended the work on vibrating strings originally developed by his father, Vincenzo Galilei.

===Music===
An air attributed to Mersenne was used by Ottorino Respighi in his second suite of &quot;Ancient Airs and Dances&quot;

<doc id="72949" wikidata="Q174789" url="?curid=72949" title="Millimetre">
<text>The millimetre (international spelling; SI unit symbol mm) or millimeter (American spelling) is a unit of length in the International System of Units (SI), equal to one thousandth of a metre, which is the SI base unit of length. Therefore, there are one thousand millimetres in a metre. There are ten millimetres in a centimetre.

One millimetre is equal to micrometres or nanometres.
Since an inch is officially defined as exactly 25.4 millimetres, a millimetre is equal to exactly (≈ 0.03937) of an inch.

==Definition==
Since 1983, the metre has been defined as &quot;the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of of a second&quot;. A millimetre, of a metre, is therefore the distance travelled by light in of a second.

==Informal terminology==
A common shortening of millimetre in spoken English is &quot;mil&quot;. This can cause confusion in the United States, where &quot;mil&quot; traditionally means a thousandth of an inch.

==Unicode symbols==
For the purposes of compatibility with Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) characters, Unicode has symbols for:
* millimetre - 
* square millimetre - 
* cubic millimetre 

In Japanese typography, these square symbols are used for laying out unit symbols without distorting the grid layout of text characters.

==Measurement==
On a metric ruler, the smallest measurements are normally millimetres. High-quality engineering rulers may be graduated in increments of 0.5 mm. Digital callipers are commonly capable of reading increments as small as 0.01 mm.

Microwaves with a frequency of 300 GHz have a wavelength of 1 mm. Using frequencies between 30 GHz and 300 GHz for data transmission, in contrast to the 300 MHz to 3 GHz normally used in mobile devices, has the potential to allow data transfer rates of 10 gigabits per second.

The smallest dimension the human eye can resolve is around 0.02 to 0.04 mm, approximately the width of a thin human hair. A sheet of paper is typically between 0.07 mm and 0.18 mm thick, with ordinary printer paper or copy paper approximately 0.1 mm thick.

<doc id="72950" wikidata="Q252575" url="?curid=72950" title="York Minster">
<text>York Minster, formally the Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York, is an Anglican cathedral in the city of York, North Yorkshire, England. The minster is the seat of the archbishop of York, the second-highest office of the Church of England, and is the mother church for the diocese of York and the province of York. The Church is often described as part of the Anglo-Catholic tradition. It is administered by its dean and chapter. The minster is a Grade I listed building and a scheduled monument.

The first record of a church on the site dates to 627; the title &quot;minster&quot; also dates to the Anglo-Saxon period, originally denoting a missionary teaching church and now an honorific. The minster undercroft contains re-used fabric of , but the bulk of the building was constructed between 1220 and 1472. It consists of Early English Gothic north and south transepts, a Decorated Gothic nave and chapter house, and a Perpendicular Gothic eastern arm and central tower.

The minster retains most of its medieval stained glass, a significant survival among European churches. The east window, which depicts the Last Judgment, is the largest expanse of medieval stained glass in the world. The north transept contains the Five Sisters window, which consists of five lancets, each over high, filled with grisaille glass.

==History==
A bishop of York was summoned to the Council of Arles in 314, indicating the presence of a Christian community in York at this time; however, archaeological evidence of Christianity in Roman York is limited. The first recorded church was a wooden structure built hurriedly in 627 to provide a place to baptise Edwin, King of Northumbria. The location of this church, and its pre-1080 successors, is unknown. It was probably in or beside the old Roman &quot;principia&quot;, (the military headquarters), which may have been used by the king when in residence in York. Archaeological evidence indicates the &quot;principia&quot; was located partly beneath the post-1080 Minister site, but excavations undertaken in 1967–73 found no remains of the pre-1080 churches. It can therefore be inferred that Edwin&#x27;s church, and its immediate successors, was near the current Minster (possibly to the north, underneath the modern Dean&#x27;s Park) but not directly on the same site. 

Moves towards a more substantial building began shortly after Edwin&#x27;s baptism. According to Bede, Edwin set about building a larger church made of stone, intended to enclose the wooden chapel in which he had been baptised. This stone structure was completed in 637 by Oswald and was dedicated to Saint Peter. The church soon fell into disrepair and was dilapidated by 670 when Saint Wilfrid ascended to the See of York. He repaired and renewed the structure, installing leaded roofs, glass windows, and rich furnishings. The attached school and library were established and by the 8th century were some of the most substantial in Northern Europe.

In 741, the cathedral may have been damaged or destroyed in a fire. Any damage to the cathedral was not long-lasting. Alcuin (who makes no mention of the fire or rebuilding) wrote in detail of the building&#x27;s wealth and grandeur. In his time, there was a grand altar erected over the place of Edwin&#x27;s baptism, covered with precious metals and jewels. A spectacular chandelier hung above the altar, and the cathedral possessed a rich and valuable silver cross and golden cruet. The cathedral, together with the rest of the city, then passed through the hands of numerous invaders, and its history is obscure until the 10th century. There were a series of Benedictine archbishops, including Saint Oswald of Worcester, Wulfstan and Ealdred, who travelled to Westminster to crown William the Conqueror in 1066. Ealdred died in 1069 and was buried in the cathedral.

In January 1069 a rebellion in support of Edgar Ætheling triggered a brutal crackdown by William. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; reports that William&#x27;s forces &quot;ravaged the town, and made St Peter’s Minster a disgrace&quot;. Later in the year, Danish invaders supporting the Ætheling sailed up the Humber and Ouse; they attacked the city, in the course of which a fire broke out, burning the cathedral. Anything at this point remaining of the cathedral may then have been further damaged by William&#x27;s Harrying of the North. The first Norman archbishop, Thomas of Bayeux, arriving in 1070, apparently organised repairs, but in 1075, another Danish force sailed up the river, &quot;travelled to York and broke into St Peter’s Minster, and there took much property, and so went away.&quot; Building of a new cathedral, the Norman Minster, began in 1080, and was completed before Thomas&#x27;s death in 1100. The new cathedral was likely immediately to the south of the old Saxon cathedral, which was probably demolished once the new structure was completed. Built in the Norman style, the new cathedral was 364.173 ft (111 m) long and rendered in white and red lines. The new structure was damaged by fire in 1137 but was soon repaired. The choir and crypt were remodelled in 1154, and a new chapel was built, all in the Norman style.

The Gothic style in cathedrals had arrived in the mid 12th century. Walter de Gray was made archbishop in 1215 and ordered the construction of a Gothic structure to rival Canterbury; building began in 1220. The north and south transepts were the first new structures; completed in the 1250s, both were built in the Early English Gothic style but had markedly different wall elevations. A substantial central tower was also completed, with a wooden spire. Building continued into the 15th century.

The Chapter House was begun in the 1260s and was completed before 1296. The wide nave was constructed from the 1280s on the Norman foundations. The outer roof was completed in the 1330s, but the vaulting was not finished until 1360. Construction then moved on to the eastern arm and chapels; the Norman choir was demolished in the 1390s with the exception of its undercroft of , which was reconstructed to provide a platform for the new high altar. Work here finished around 1405. In 1407 the central tower collapsed; the piers were then reinforced, and a new tower was built from 1420. The western towers were added between 1433 and 1472. The cathedral was declared complete and consecrated in 1472.
The English Reformation led to the looting of much of the cathedral&#x27;s treasures and the loss of much of the church lands. Under Elizabeth I there was a concerted effort to remove all traces of Roman Catholicism from the cathedral; there was much destruction of tombs, windows and altars. In the English Civil War the city was besieged and fell to the forces of Cromwell in 1644, but Thomas Fairfax prevented any further damage to the cathedral.

Following the easing of religious tensions some work was done to restore the cathedral. From 1730 to 1736 the whole floor of the minster was relaid in patterned marble and from 1802 there was a major restoration. However, on 2 February 1829, an arson attack by Jonathan Martin inflicted heavy damage on the east arm. An accidental fire in 1840 left the nave, south west tower and south aisle roofless and blackened shells. The cathedral slumped deeply into debt and in the 1850s services were suspended. From 1858 Augustus Duncombe worked successfully to revive the cathedral. In 1866, there were six residentiary canonries: of which one was the Chancellor&#x27;s, one the Sub-Dean&#x27;s, and another annexed to the Archdeaconry of York.

During the 20th century there was more concerted preservation work, especially following a 1967 survey that revealed the building, in particular the central tower, was close to collapse. £2,000,000 was raised and spent by 1972 to reinforce and strengthen the building foundations and roof. During the excavations that were carried out, remains of the north corner of the Roman &quot;Principia&quot; (headquarters of the Roman fort of Eboracum) were found under the south transept. This area, as well as remains of the Norman cathedral, re-opened to the public in spring 2013 as part of the new exhibition exploring the history of the building of York Minster.

===1984 fire===

On 9 July 1984, York Minster suffered a serious fire in its south transept during the early morning hours. Firefighters made a decision to deliberately collapse the roof of the south transept by pouring tens of thousands of gallons of water onto it, in order to save the rest of the building from destruction. A total of 114 firefighters from across North Yorkshire responded to the fire and contained it, while York Minster&#x27;s staff and clergy rushed to preserve historical objects in the building. The glass of the south transept rose window was shattered by the heat but the lead held it together, allowing it to be taken down for restoration. A subsequent investigation found an 80% chance that the fire was caused by a lightning strike to a metal electrical box on top of the roof, a 10% chance that the fire was caused by arson, and a 10% chance that the fire was caused by an electrical fault. Some traditionalist Anglicans suggested the fire was a sign of divine displeasure at the recent consecration as Bishop of Durham of David Jenkins, whose views they considered heterodox.

A repair and restoration project was completed in 1988 at a cost of £2.25 million, and included new roof bosses to designs which had won a competition put on by BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Blue Peter&quot; programme for children. The roof trusses were rebuilt in oak, but some were coated with fire-retardant plaster.

===2002 West Door renewal===
In 2002, the carvings round the great west door. which had become severely weathered, were replaced with new sculptures carved by Minster masons to designs by the sculptor Rory Young, telling the Genesis story.

===2007–2018 renovation===
In 2007 renovation began on the east front, including the Great East Window, at an estimated cost of £23 million. The 311 glass panels from the Great East Window were removed in 2008 for conservation. The project was completed in 2018.

===Schools===
There have been choir schools associated with the Minster since the 7th century. A &#x27;song school&#x27; was founded in 627 by Paulinus of York, the first Archbishop of York. Buildings used by the former Minster school have been awarded listed status, among them the school house built 1830–33, two houses dating back to 1837, and a Georgian building of 1755.

==Architecture of the present building==

York Minster is the second-largest Gothic cathedral of Northern Europe and clearly charts the development of English Gothic architecture from Early English through to the Perpendicular Period. The present building was begun in about 1230 and completed in 1472. York Minster is the largest cathedral completed during the Gothic period of architecture, Cologne Cathedral only being completed in 1880, after being left uncompleted for 350 years. It has a cruciform plan with an octagonal chapter house attached to the north transept, a central tower and two towers at the west front. The stone used for the building is magnesian limestone, a creamy-white coloured rock that was quarried in nearby Tadcaster. The Minster is long and the central tower has a height of . The choir has an interior height of .

The north and south transepts were the first parts of the new church to be built. They have simple lancet windows, including the &quot;Five Sisters&quot; in the north transept. These are five lancets, each tall and five feet wide and glazed with grey (grisaille) glass, rather than narrative scenes or symbolic motifs that are usually seen in medieval stained-glass windows. In the south transept is a rose window whose glass dates from about 1500 and commemorates the union of the royal houses of York and Lancaster. The roofs of the transepts are of wood; that of the south transept was burnt in the fire of 1984 and was replaced in the restoration work which was completed in 1988. New designs were used for the bosses, five of which were designed by winners of a competition organised by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Blue Peter&quot; television programme.

Work began on the chapter house and its vestibule that links it to the north transept after the transepts were completed. The style of the chapter house is of the early Decorated Period where geometric patterns were used in the tracery of the windows, which were wider than those of early styles. However, the work was completed before the appearance of the ogee curve, an S-shaped double curve that was extensively used at the end of this period. The windows cover almost all of the upper wall space, filling the chapter house with light. The chapter house is octagonal, as is the case in many cathedrals, but is notable in that it has no central column supporting the roof. The wooden roof, which was of an innovative design, is light enough to be able to be supported by the buttressed walls. The chapter house has many sculptured heads above the canopies, representing some of the finest Gothic sculpture in the country. There are human heads, no two alike, and some pulling faces; angels; animals and grotesques. Unique to the transepts and chapter house is the use of Purbeck marble to adorn the piers, adding to the richness of decoration. The chapter house exhibits the influence of Saint-Urbain, Troyes in the tracery in the vestibule, while the stalls are enlarged versions of the archivolt niches in the portal of Notre-Dame de Paris.

The nave was built between 1291 and and is also in the decorated Gothic style. It is the widest Gothic nave in England and has a wooden roof (painted so as to appear like stone) and the aisles have vaulted stone roofs. At its west end is the Great West Window, known as the &#x27;Heart of Yorkshire&#x27;, second-largest among the church&#x27;s 128 windows. This window was designed and built along with the rest of the west front by the master mason Ivo de Raghton in 1338–39. The tracery is in the Flamboyant or Curvilinear Decorated style of English Gothic architecture. Because of deterioration of stone mullions, the tracery was replaced in the late 1980s with an exact copy.

The east end of the Minster was built between 1361 and 1405 in the Perpendicular Gothic style. Despite the change in style, noticeable in details such as the tracery and capitals, the eastern arm preserves the pattern of the nave. The east end contains a four-bay choir; a second set of transepts, projecting only above half-height; and the Lady Chapel. The transepts are in line with the high altar and serve to throw light onto it. Behind the high altar is the Great East Window, the largest expanse of medieval stained glass in the country, which underwent a decade-long restoration and conservation project, completed in 2018.

The sparsely decorated &quot;Central Tower&quot; was built between 1407 and 1472 and is also in the Perpendicular style. Below this, separating the choir from the crossing and nave is the striking 15th-century choir screen. It contains sculptures of the kings of England from William the Conqueror to Henry VI with stone and gilded canopies set against a red background. Above the screen is the organ, which dates from 1832. The West Towers, in contrast with the Central Tower, are heavily decorated and are topped with battlements and eight pinnacles each, again in the Perpendicular style.

In 2003, English Heritage made publicly available a monograph on the architectural history of York Minster. The book charts the construction and development of the minster based on the architectural recording of the building from the 1970s.

===Stained glass===
Some of the stained glass in York Minster dates back to the 12th century and much of the glass (white or coloured) came from Germany. The glass was painted, fired, then joined with lead strips (came) into the windows. The Dean and Chapter of York commissioned John Thornton in 1405 to design the tall and wide Great East Window; he was paid £66 for the work. Composed of over 300 panels, this is the largest expanse of medieval stained glass in the country, according to the Minster. The window represents scenes from the Book of Revelation, and the glazier Thornton may have been influenced by earlier illuminated manuscripts on the subject such as the Latin Douce Apocalypse (Oxford, Bodleian Library, Douce MS 180) and the Old French Queen Mary Apocalypse (London, British Library Royal MS BXV). The work was conceived by Archbishop John of Thoresby in the mid fourteenth century, but the window itself was only completed thanks to the funding of Bishop Walter Skirlaw and Archbishop Richard Scrope.
Another important window is the tall Five Sisters window. Because of the extended time periods during which the glass was installed, different types of glazing and painting techniques are visible in the different windows. Approximately two million individual pieces of glass make up the cathedral&#x27;s stained-glass windows. The windows were removed in 1916 because of the fear of bombing during the First World War and the &quot;Five Sisters&quot; window was restored in 1925 with £3,500 raised by Almyra Gray and Helen Little. The glass was removed again during the Second World War.

In 2008 a conservation project of the Great East Window commenced, involving the removal, repainting and re-leading of each individual panel. While the window was in storage in the minster&#x27;s stonemasons&#x27; yard, a fire broke out in some adjoining offices, due to an electrical fault, on 30 December 2009. The window&#x27;s 311 panes, stored in a neighbouring room, were undamaged and were successfully moved to safety. In September 2015, the first phase of the renovation project of the East Front of the Minster was completed. The final phase of the £11 million restoration of the 311 panels was completed in September 2017 and they were re-installed between November 2017 and January 2018. In total, the work on the Great East Window had taken 92,400 hours of labour, including the time required to add protective UV coating on the glass. The work was largely undertaken or overseen by Peter Gibson, who worked on all the Minster&#x27;s windows during his career.

===Towers and bells===

The two west towers of the minster hold bells, clock chimes and a concert carillon. The north-west tower contains Great Peter (216 cwt or 10.8 tons) and the six clock bells (the largest weighing just over 60 cwt or 3 tons). The south-west tower holds 14 bells (tenor 59 cwt or 3 tons) hung and rung for change ringing and 22 carillon bells (tenor 23 cwt or 1.2 tons) which are played from a baton keyboard in the ringing chamber (all together 36 bells.)

The clock bells ring every quarter of an hour during the daytime and Great Peter strikes the hour.

The change ringing bells fell silent in October 2016, following the controversial termination of the ringers&#x27; volunteer agreements by the dean and chapter. The pause in ringing included the Christmas period of 2016, reported as the first time in over 600 years that the Minster&#x27;s bells were not heard on Christmas Day. After a year with no change ringing, a new band was appointed and ringing resumed.

York Minster became the first cathedral in England to have a carillon of bells with the arrival of a further twenty-four small bells on 4 April 2008. These are added to the existing &quot;Nelson Chime&quot; which is chimed to announce Evensong around 5:00 pm each day, giving a carillon of 35 bells in total (three chromatic octaves). The new bells were cast at the Loughborough Bell Foundry of John Taylor &amp; Co, where all of the existing minster bells were cast. The new carillon is a gift to the minster. It will be the first new carillon in the British Isles for 40 years and first hand played carillon in an English cathedral. Before Evensong each evening, hymn tunes are played on a baton keyboard connected with the bells, but occasionally anything from Beethoven to the Beatles may be heard.

===Shrines===
When Thomas Becket was murdered and subsequently enshrined at Canterbury, York found itself with a rival major draw for pilgrims. More specifically, pilgrims spent money and would leave gifts for the support of the cathedral. Hence Walter de Gray, supported by the King, petitioned the Pope. On 18 March 1226, Pope Honorius issued a letter to the effect that the name of William (Fitzherbert), formerly Archbishop of York, was &quot;inscribed in the catalogue of the Saints of the Church Militant.&quot; Thus there was now St William of York (whose name is perhaps more often associated with the adjacent St William&#x27;s College). York had its saint but it took until 1279, when William de Wickwane (William de Wykewayne) was elected archbishop, for the remains of the canonised William to be transferred to a shrine prepared for them behind the high altar. This was placed on a platform raised upon the arches of the crypt removed to this position for that purpose. On 29 December King Edward I himself, together with the bishops who were present, carried on their shoulder the chest or feretory containing the relics to their new resting-place and Anthony Beck, consecrated the same day as Bishop of Durham, paid all the expenses.

The tomb of Walter de Gray was erected in the south transept. His remains were interred on &quot;the vigil of Pentecost, 1255&quot; under his effigy &quot;in full canonicals&quot; carved in Purbeck marble under a canopy resting on ten light pillars. It was subsequently somewhat hidden behind a screen of ironwork erected by Archbishop William Markham in the early 19th century.

On 9 November 2022 King Charles III unveiled a statue of his mother Queen Elizabeth II in a niche on the west facade of York Minster.

==Consulting architects==
The Minster&#x27;s consulting architects (since 1965 called &quot;Surveyors of the Fabric&quot; – see Cant and Aylmer, &quot;York Minster&quot;, p. 554) have included the following:
* G. E. Street (1868–1881)
* G. F. Bodley (1882–1907)
* Walter Tapper (1908–1935)
* Sir Charles Reed Peers (1935–1946)
* Sir Albert Edward Richardson (1946–1964)
* Bernard Feilden (1964–1977)
* Charles Brown (1977–1995)
* James Simpson 
* Andrew Arrol ( –2020)
* Oliver Caroe (2020– )

== Vaults ==
==Organ==
The fire of 1829 destroyed the organ and the basis of the present organ dates from 1832, when &quot;Elliot and Hill&quot; constructed a new instrument. This organ was reconstructed in 1859 by William Hill and Sons. The case remained intact, but the organ was mechanically new, retaining the largest pipes of the former instrument.

In 1903, J. W. Walker and Sons built a new instrument in the same case. They retained several registers from the previous instrument.

Some work was undertaken in 1918 by Harrison &amp; Harrison when the Tuba Mirabilis was added and the Great chorus revised. The same firm rebuilt this Walker-Harrison instrument in 1931 when a new console and electro-pneumatic action were added together with four new stops. The smaller solo tubas were enclosed in the solo box. In 1960, J. W. Walker &amp; Sons restored the actions, lowered wind pressures and introduced mutations and higher chorus work in the spirit of the neo-classical movement. They cleaned the organ in 1982.

The fire of 1984 affected the organ but not irreparably; the damage hastened the time for a major restoration, which was begun in 1991 and finished two years later by Principal Pipe Organs of York, under the direction of their founder, Geoffrey Coffin, who had at one time been assistant organist at the Minster.

In 2018, a £2 million project to refurbish the current organ was announced. The project took two years for its completion in March 2021 and saw nearly all of its 5,403 pipes removed and taken to organ specialists Harrison &amp; Harrison in Durham.

===Organists===

The organists of York Minster have had several official titles, the job description roughly equates to that of Organist and Master of the Choristers. The current Organist and Director of Music of the Minster is Robert Sharpe. There is also an assistant director of Music, Ben Morris.

Among the notable organists of York Minster are four members of the Camidge family, who served as the cathedral&#x27;s organists for over 100 years, and a number of composers including John Naylor, T. Tertius Noble, Edward Bairstow, Francis Jackson, and Philip Moore.

==Astronomical clock==
The astronomical clock was installed in the north transept of York Minster in 1955. The clock is a memorial to the airmen operating from bases in Yorkshire, County Durham and Northumberland who were killed in action during the Second World War. The clock is not currently working.

==Illuminations==

In November 2002, York Minster was illuminated in colour, devised by York-born Mark Brayshaw, for the first time in its history. The occasion was televised live on the BBC1 &quot;Look North&quot; programme. Similar illuminations have been projected over the Christmas period in subsequent years.

York Minster was also artistically illuminated on 5 November 2005, celebrating the 400th anniversary of the foiling of York-born Guy Fawkes&#x27; gunpowder plot. This was done by Patrice Warrener using his unique &quot;chromolithe&quot; technique with which he &#x27;paints&#x27; with light, picking out sculpted architectural details.

In October 2010, York Minster&#x27;s south transept was selected for &quot;Rose&quot;, a &quot;son et lumiere&quot; created by international artists Ross Ashton and Karen Monid which lit up the entire exterior of the south transept of the minster and illuminated the Rose Window. There were also satellite illuminate events in Dean&#x27;s Park.

==York Mystery Plays==
In 2000, the Dean and Chapter allowed the York Mystery Plays to be performed for the first time inside the Minster, directed by Gregory Doran. The Plays returned to the Minster for a second time in 2016, directed by Phillip Breen with Philip McGinley performing the role of Jesus.

== Notes ==
 The saying of the Daily Offices (Matins and Evensong) and Holy Communion (or Mass) also being celebrated daily, plus the use of vestments and incense, mean it is fair to ascribe the label &quot;Anglo-Catholic&quot; to the style of worship at York Minster. However, the theological and sacramental positions, and how far they may be called &quot;catholic&quot;, is debated.

<text>The Abbey Church of St Mary the Virgin, Tewkesbury, commonly known as Tewkesbury Abbey, is located in the town of Tewkesbury in the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire, England. A former Benedictine monastery, it is now a parish church. Considered one of the finest examples of Norman architecture in Britain, it has &quot;probably the largest and finest Romanesque&quot; crossing tower in England.

Tewkesbury had been a centre for worship since the 7th century. A priory was established there in the 10th century. The present building was started in the early 12th century. It was unsuccessfully used as a sanctuary in the Wars of the Roses. After the dissolution of the monasteries, Tewkesbury Abbey became the parish church for the town. George Gilbert Scott led the restoration of the building in the late 19th century. The church and churchyard within the abbey precincts include tombs and memorials to many of the aristocracy of the area.

Services have been high church but now include Parish Eucharist, choral Mass, and Evensong. These services are accompanied by one of the church&#x27;s three organs and choirs. There is a ring of twelve bells, hung for change ringing.

==History==

The &quot;Chronicle of Tewkesbury&quot; records that the first Christian worship was brought to the area by Theoc, a missionary from Northumbria, who built his cell in the mid-7th century near a gravel spit where the Severn and Avon rivers join. The cell was succeeded by a monastery in 715, but nothing remaining of it has been identified.

In the 10th century the religious foundation at Tewkesbury became a priory subordinate to the Benedictine Cranborne Abbey in Dorset. In 1087, William the Conqueror gave the manor of Tewkesbury to his cousin, Robert Fitzhamon, who, with Giraldus, Abbot of Cranborne, founded the present abbey in 1092. Building of the present abbey church did not start until 1102, employing Caen stone imported from Normandy and floated up the Severn.

Robert Fitzhamon was wounded at Falaise in Normandy in 1105 and died two years later, but his son-in-law, Robert FitzRoy, the natural son of Henry I who was made Earl of Gloucester, continued to fund the building work. The abbey&#x27;s greatest single later patron was Lady Eleanor le Despenser, last of the De Clare heirs of FitzRoy. In the High Middle Ages, Tewkesbury became one of the richest abbeys of England.

After the Battle of Tewkesbury in the Wars of the Roses on 4 May 1471, some of the defeated Lancastrians sought sanctuary in the abbey. The victorious Yorkists, led by King Edward IV, forced their way into the abbey; the resulting bloodshed caused the building to be closed for a month until it could be purified and re-consecrated.

At the dissolution of the monasteries, the last abbot, John Wakeman, surrendered the abbey to the commissioners of King Henry VIII on 9 January 1539. As a former monk of an endowed community, he received an annuity. This was the relatively large sum of 400 marks, but would have ceased when he was ordained as the first Bishop of Gloucester in September 1541. Meanwhile, the people of Tewkesbury saved the abbey from destruction. Insisting that it was their parish church which they had the right to keep, they bought it from the Crown for the value of its bells and lead roof which would have been salvaged and melted down, leaving the structure a roofless ruin. The price came to £453.

The bells merited their own free-standing belltower, an unusual feature in English sites. After the dissolution, the bell-tower was used as the gaol for the borough until it was demolished in the late 18th century.

The central stone tower was originally topped with a wooden spire, which collapsed in 1559 and was never rebuilt. Restoration undertaken in the late 19th century under Sir George Gilbert Scott was reopened on 23 September 1879. Work continued under the direction of his son John Oldrid Scott until 1910 and included the rood screen of 1892.

Flood waters from the nearby River Severn reached inside the abbey during severe floods in 1760, and again on 23 July 2007.

===Construction time-line===
* 23 October 1121 – the choir consecrated
* 1150 – tower and nave completed
* 1178 – large fire necessitated some rebuilding
* ~1235 – Chapel of St Nicholas built
* ~1300 – Chapel of St. James built
* 1321–1335 – choir rebuilt with radiating chantry chapels
* 1349–59 – tower and nave vaults rebuilt; the lierne vaults of the nave replacing wooden roofing
* 1400–1410 – cloisters rebuilt
* 1438 – Chapel of Isabel (Countess of Warwick) built
* 1471 – Battle of Tewkesbury; bloodshed within church so great that it is closed for purification

==The building==
The church itself is one of the finest Norman buildings in England. Its massive crossing tower is noted in Pevsner&#x27;s Buildings of England to be &quot;probably the largest and finest Romanesque example in England&quot;. Fourteen of England&#x27;s cathedrals are of smaller dimensions, while only Westminster Abbey contains more medieval church monuments.

==Notable monuments==
Notable church monuments surviving in Tewkesbury Abbey include:
* 1107 – when the abbey&#x27;s founder Robert Fitzhamon died in 1107, he was buried in the chapter house while his son-in-law Robert FitzRoy, Earl of Gloucester (an illegitimate son of King Henry I), continued building the abbey
* 1375 – Edward Despenser, Lord of the Manor of Tewkesbury, is remembered today chiefly for the effigy on his monument, which shows him in full colour kneeling on top of the canopy of his chantry, facing toward the high altar
* 1395 – Robert Fitzhamon&#x27;s remains were moved into a new chapel built as his tomb
* 1471 – a brass plate on the floor in the centre of the sanctuary marks the grave of Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, the son of King Henry VI and end of the Lancastrian line, who was killed in the Battle of Tewkesbury – the only Prince of Wales ever to die in battle. He was aged only 17 at his death.
* 1478 – the bones of George, Duke of Clarence (brother of Edward IV and Richard III), and his wife Isabel (daughter of &quot;Warwick, the Kingmaker&quot;) are housed behind a glass window in a wall of their inaccessible burial vault behind the high altar
* 1539 – the cadaver monument which Abbot Wakeman had erected for himself is only a cenotaph because he was not buried there
* Also buried in the abbey are several members of the Despenser, de Clare and Beauchamp families, all of whom were generous benefactors of the abbey. Such members include Henry de Beauchamp, 1st Duke of Warwick, and his wife, Cecily Neville, Duchess of Warwick, sister of &quot;Warwick, the Kingmaker&quot;.

==The three organs==
===Milton Organ===

The abbey&#x27;s 17th-century organ – known as the Milton Organ – was originally made for Magdalen College, Oxford, by Robert Dallam. After the English Civil War it was removed to the chapel of Hampton Court Palace, where the poet Milton may have played it. It came to Tewkesbury in 1737. Since then, it has undergone several major rebuilds. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

===Grove Organ===
In the north transept is the stupendous Grove Organ, built by the short-lived partnership of Michell &amp; Thynne in 1885: .

===Chamber organ===
The third organ in the abbey is the Elliott chamber organ of 1812, mounted on a movable platform: .

==The bells==

The bells at the abbey were overhauled in 1962 and the ring is now made up of twelve bells, cast by John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough. A semitone bell (Flat 6th) and extra treble were also cast by Taylor of Loughborough in 1991 and 2020 respectively, making a total of 14 available for change ringing.

The Old Clock Bells are the old 6th (Abraham Rudhall II, 1725), the old 7th (Abraham Rudhall I, 1696), the old 8th (Abraham Rudhall I, 1696) and the old 11th (Abraham Rudhall I, 1717).

The abbey bells are rung from 09:30am to 10:30am every Sunday. They are also rung on certain Sundays before Evensong. Practice takes place each Thursday from 7:30pm to 9:00pm.

==Churchyard==
The churchyard contains war graves of two World War II Royal Air Force personnel.

==Abbey precincts==
The market town of Tewkesbury developed to the north of the abbey precincts, of which vestiges remain in the layout of the streets and a few buildings: the Abbot&#x27;s gatehouse, the Almonry barn, the Abbey Mill, Abbey House, the present vicarage and some half-timbered dwellings in Church Street. The abbey now sits partly isolated in lawns, like a cathedral in its cathedral close, for the area surrounding the abbey is protected from development by the Abbey Lawn Trust, a registered charity originally funded by a United States benefactor in 1962.

==Abbots==
* Gerald of Avranches (1102–1109). Previously served as Abbot of Cranborne, when Tewkesbury was a dependent cell. Gerald was made Abbot when the abbey was transferred to Tewkesbury by William Rufus and Robert Fitz Haimon. He also previously served as chaplain to Hugh, Earl of Chester

==Choirs==
The abbey possesses, in effect, two choirs. The Abbey Choir sings at Sunday services, with children (boys and girls) and adults in the morning, and adults in the evening. Tewkesbury Abbey Schola Cantorum is a professional choir of men, boys and girls based at Dean Close Preparatory School and sings at weekday Evensongs as well as occasional masses and concerts.

The abbey previously had its own school to educate and provide choristers to sing the service of Evensong. The Abbey School was founded in 1973 by Miles Amherst and closed in 2006. The choir was then re-housed at Dean Close School, Cheltenham, and renamed the Tewkesbury Abbey Schola Cantorum.

==Worship==

For the most part, worship at the abbey has been emphatically High Anglican. However, in more recent times there has been an acknowledgement of the value of less solemn worship, and this is reflected in the two congregational services offered on Sunday mornings. The first of these (at 9.15am) is a Parish Eucharist, with modern language and an informal atmosphere; a parish breakfast is typically served after this service. The main Sung Eucharist at 11am is solemn and formal, including a choral Mass; traditional language is used throughout, and most parts of the service are indeed sung, including the Collect and Gospel reading. Choral Evensong is sung on Sunday evenings, and also on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday during the week. A said Eucharist also takes place every day of the week, at varying times, and alternating between traditional and modern language. Each summer since 1969 (with the exception of 2007 when the town was hit by floods) the abbey has played host to Musica Deo Sacra, a festival combining music and liturgy. Photography in the abbey is restricted.

<text>A cubic centimetre (or cubic centimeter in US English) (SI unit symbol: cm3; non-SI abbreviations: cc and ccm) is a commonly used unit of volume that corresponds to the volume of a cube that measures 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm. One cubic centimetre corresponds to a volume of one millilitre. The mass of one cubic centimetre of water at 3.98 °C (the temperature at which it attains its maximum density) is almost equal to one gram. 

In internal combustion engines, &quot;cc&quot; refers to the total volume of its engine displacement in cubic centimetres. The displacement can be calculated using the formula
:formula_1
where is engine displacement, is the bore of the cylinders, is length of the stroke and is the number of cylinders.

<text>A diptych (, ) is any object with two flat plates which form a pair, often attached by a hinge. For example, the standard notebook and school exercise book of the ancient world was a diptych consisting of a pair of such plates that contained a recessed space filled with wax. Writing was accomplished by scratching the wax surface with a stylus. When the notes were no longer needed, the wax could be slightly heated and then smoothed to allow reuse. Ordinary versions had wooden frames, but more luxurious diptychs were crafted with more expensive materials.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;diptych&quot; is borrowed from the Latin , which itself is derived from the Late Greek () . is the neuter plural of () .

==Art==

As an art term a diptych is an artwork consisting of two pieces or panels that together create a single art piece. These can be fastened together or presented adjoining each other. In medieval times, panels were often hinged so that they could be closed and the artworks protected.

In Late Antiquity, ivory notebook diptychs with covers carved in low relief on the outer faces were a significant art-form: the &quot;consular diptych&quot; was made to celebrate an individual&#x27;s becoming Roman consul, when they seem to have been made in sets and distributed by the new consul to friends and followers. Others may have been made to celebrate a wedding, or, perhaps like the Poet and Muse diptych at Monza, simply commissioned for private use. Some of the most important surviving works of the Late Roman Empire are diptychs, of which some dozens survive, preserved in some instances by being reversed and re-used as book covers. The largest surviving Byzantine ivory panel (428 mm × 143 mm), is a leaf from a diptych in the Justinian court manner of –550, which features an archangel.

From the Middle Ages many panel paintings took the diptych form, as small portable works for personal use; Eastern Orthodox ones may be called &quot;travelling icons&quot;. Although the triptych form was more common, there were also ivory diptychs with religious scenes carved in relief, a form found first in Byzantine art before becoming very popular in the Gothic period in the West, where they were mainly produced in Paris. These suited the mobile lives of medieval elites. The ivories tended to have scenes in several registers (vertical layers) crowded with small figures. The paintings generally had single subjects on a panel, the two matching, though by the 15th century one panel (usually the left one) might contain a portrait head of the owner or commissioner, with the Virgin or another religious subject on the other side. The outsides, which often received considerable wear from travelling, might have simpler decorative designs, including the coat of arms of the owner.

Large altarpieces tended to be made in triptych form, with two outer panels that could be closed across the main central representation. They are one type of the multi-panel forms of painting known as &quot;polyptychs&quot;.

The diptych was a common format in Early Netherlandish painting and depicted subjects ranging from secular portraiture to religious personages and stories. Often a portrait and a Madonna and Child had a leaf each. It was especially popular in the 15th and 16th centuries. Painters such as Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Hans Memling and Hugo van der Goes used the form. Some modern artists have used the term in the title of works consisting of two paintings never actually connected, but intended to be hung close together as a pair, such as Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Marilyn Diptych&quot; (1962) which is a modern pop culture icon.

&quot;Diptych&quot; is also often used in reference to films or pieces of literature that form a complementary pair. When taken together, they are viewed as illuminating each other and comprising a distinct work of art from the individual parts. An example is the pair of Alan Ayckbourn plays, House and Garden.

The street artist Banksy has regularly used the diptych format for a variety of his studio produced artworks including Girl with Balloon. The diptych version of the work is made from spray paint on canvas with each panel measuring 30 x 30 cm and was released in an edition of 25 in 2005.

==Ecclesiastical==
It is in this form that the mention of &quot;diptychs&quot; in early Christian literature is found. The term refers to official lists of the living and departed that are commemorated by the local church. The living would be inscribed on one wing of the diptych, and the departed on the other. The inscribing of a bishop&#x27;s name in the diptychs means that the local church considers itself to be in communion with him, the removal of a bishop&#x27;s name would indicate breaking communion with him. The names in the diptychs would be read publicly by the deacon during the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist), and by the priest during the Liturgy of Preparation. Diptychs were also used to inscribe the names of the saints. Although the wax tablets themselves are no longer used, the term is still used in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches to describe the contents of the diptychs, with all the same connotations.
==Diptych sundial==

A face was on the inside of each leaf. One leaf formed a vertical sundial, the other a horizontal sundial. The shadow caster, or &quot;gnomon&quot;, was a string between them, and calibrated as to how far they should open, as the angle is critical. Such a sundial can be adjusted to any latitude by tilting it so its gnomon is parallel to the Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation. A common error states that if both dials show the same time, the instrument is oriented correctly and faces north (in the northern hemisphere). A Diptych made as stated as a combined vertical and horizontal sundial with a string gnomon will show the same time on both dials regardless of orientation. This property of self alignment is only true for diptychs historically in the case for a combination of an analemmatic and a vertical sundial. A double dial on a flat plate consisting of a horizontal and an analemmatic dial will also be aligned properly if both dials show the same time.

Some diptychs had rough calendars, in the form of pelekinons calibrated to a nodus in the form of a bead or knot on the string. These are accurate to about a week, which was good enough to time planting of crops.

<text>Lake Victoria is one of the African Great Lakes. With a surface area of approximately , Lake Victoria is Africa&#x27;s largest lake by area, the world&#x27;s largest tropical lake, and the world&#x27;s second-largest fresh water lake by surface area after Lake Superior in North America. In terms of volume, Lake Victoria is the world&#x27;s ninth-largest continental lake, containing about of water. Lake Victoria occupies a shallow depression in Africa. The lake has an average depth of and a maximum depth of . Its catchment area covers . The lake has a shoreline of when digitized at the 1:25,000 level, with islands constituting 3.7% of this length. 

The lake&#x27;s area is divided among three countries: Tanzania occupies 49% (), Uganda 45% (), and Kenya 6% ().

The lake is home to many species of fish which live nowhere else, especially cichlids. Invasive fish, such as the Nile perch, have driven many endemic species to extinction.

==Names==
Though having multiple local language names (; ; ; ), the lake was renamed after Queen Victoria by the explorer John Hanning Speke, the first Briton to document it in 1858, while on an expedition with Richard Francis Burton.

==Geology==
Photojournalist John Reader, writing in his Alan Paton Literary Award-winning &quot;Africa: A Biography of a Continent&quot;, describes Lake Victoria as being relatively geologically young at about 400,000-years old—having been formed as westward-flowing rivers were backed up &quot;when a fractured block of the Earth&#x27;s crust tilted along the line of the Great Rift Valley, raising its western edge&quot;. A primary study, attempting &quot;fluvial differentiation of the basin of Lake Victoria&quot;, draws several relevant tentative conclusions. First, during the Miocene era, what is now the catchment area of the lake was on the western side of an uplifted area that functioned as a continental divide, with streams on the western side flowing into the Congo River basin and streams on the eastern side flowing to the Indian Ocean. Second, as the East African Rift System formed, the eastern wall of the Albertine Rift (or Western Rift) rose, gradually reversing the drainage towards what is now Lake Victoria. Third, the opening of the main East African Rift and the Albertine Rift downwarped the area between them as the rift walls rose, creating the current Lake Victoria basin. 

During its geological history, Lake Victoria went through changes ranging from its present shallow depression, through to what may have been a series of much smaller lakes. Geological cores taken from its bottom show Lake Victoria has dried up completely at least three times since it formed. These drying cycles are probably related to past ice ages, which were times when precipitation declined globally. According to another primary source, Lake Victoria last dried out about 17,300 years ago, and it refilled 14,700 years ago—as the African humid period began.

==Hydrology and limnology==
Lake Victoria receives 80 percent of its water from direct rainfall. Average evaporation on the lake is between per year, almost double the precipitation of riparian areas. Lake Victoria receives its water additionally from rivers, and thousands of small streams. The Kagera River is the largest river flowing into this lake, with its mouth on the lake&#x27;s western shore. Lake Victoria is drained solely by the Nile River near Jinja, Uganda on the lake&#x27;s northern shore.
In the Kenya sector, the main influent rivers are the Sio, Nzoia, Yala, Nyando, Sondu Miriu, Mogusi, and Migori. The only outflow from Lake Victoria is the Nile River, which exits the lake near Jinja, Uganda. In terms of contributed water, this makes Lake Victoria the principal source of the longest branch of the Nile. However, the most distal source of the Nile Basin, and therefore the ultimate source of the Nile, is more often considered to be one of the tributary rivers of the Kagera River (the exact tributary remains undetermined), and which originates in either Rwanda or Burundi. The uppermost section of the Nile is generally known as the Victoria Nile until it reaches Lake Albert. Although it is a part of the same river system known as the White Nile and is occasionally referred to as such, strictly speaking this name does not apply until after the river crosses the Uganda border into South Sudan to the north.

The lake exhibits eutrophic conditions. In 1990–1991, oxygen concentrations in the mixed layer were higher than in 1960–1961, with nearly continuous oxygen supersaturation in surface waters. Oxygen concentrations in hypolimnetic waters (i.e., the layer of water that lies below the thermocline, is noncirculating, and remains perpetually cold) were lower in 1990–1991 for a longer period than in 1960–1961, with values of less than 1 mg per litre (&lt; 0.4 gr/cu ft) occurring in water as shallow as compared with a shallowest occurrence of greater than in 1961. The changes in oxygenation are considered consistent with measurements of higher algal biomass and productivity. These changes have arisen for multiple reasons: successive burning within its basin, soot and ash from which has been deposited over the lake&#x27;s wide area; from increased nutrient inflows via rivers, and from increased pollution associated with settlement along its shores.

Between 2010 and 2022 the surface area of Lake Victoria increased by 15% flooding lakeside communities.

== Bathymetry ==
The lake is a shallow lake considering its large geographic area with a maximum depth of approximately and an average depth of . A 2016 project digitized ten-thousand points and created the first true bathymetric map of the lake. The deepest part of the lake is offset to the east of the lake near Kenya and the lake is generally shallower in the west along the Ugandan shoreline and the south along the Tanzanian shoreline.

==Native wildlife==
===Mammals===
Many mammal species live in the region of Lake Victoria, and some of these are closely associated with the lake itself and the nearby wetlands. Among these are the hippopotamus, African clawless otter, spotted-necked otter, marsh mongoose, sitatunga, bohor reedbuck, defassa waterbuck, cane rats, and giant otter shrew.

===Reptiles===
Lake Victoria and its wetlands has a large population of Nile crocodiles, as well as African helmeted turtles, variable mud turtles, and Williams&#x27; mud turtle. The Williams&#x27; mud turtle is restricted to Lake Victoria and other lakes, rivers, and swamps in the upper Nile basin.

===Cichlid fish===
Lake Victoria formerly was very rich in fish, including many endemics, but a high percentage of these became extinct since the 1940s. The main group in Lake Victoria is the haplochromine cichlids (&quot;Haplochromis&quot; &quot;sensu lato&quot;) with more than 500 species, almost all endemic, and including an estimated 300 that still are undescribed. This is far more species of fish than any other lake in the world, except Lake Malawi. These are the result of a rapid adaptive radiation in the last circa 15,000 years. Their extraordinary diversity and speed of evolution have been the subjects for many scientists studying the forces that drive the richness of life everywhere. The Victoria haplochromines are part of an older group of more than 700 closely related species, also including those of several smaller lakes in the region, notably Kyoga, Edward–George, Albert, and Kivu.

Most of these lakes are relatively shallow (like Victoria) and part of the present-day upper Nile basin. The exception is Lake Kivu, which is part of the present-day Congo River basin, but is believed to have been connected to Lakes Edward and Victoria by rivers until the uplifting of parts of the East African Rift. This deep lake may have functioned as an &quot;evolutionary reservoir&quot; for this haplochromine group in periods where other shallower lakes in the region dried out, as happened to Lake Victoria about 15,000 years ago. In recent history only Lake Kyoga was easily accessible to Victoria cichlids, as further downstream movement by the Victoria Nile (to Lake Albert) is prevented by a series of waterfalls, notably Murchison. In contrast, the Owen Falls (now flooded by a dam) between Victoria and Kyoga were essentially a series of rapids that did not effectively block fish movements between the two lakes.

The Victoria haplochromines are distinctly sexually dimorphic (males relatively brightly colored; females dull), and their ecology is extremely diverse, falling into at least 16 groups, including detritivores, zooplanktivores, insectivores, prawn-eaters, molluscivores and piscivores. As a result of predation by the introduced Nile perch, eutrophication and other changes to the ecosystem, it is estimated that at least 200 species (about 40 percent) of Lake Victoria haplochromines have become extinct, including more than 100 undescribed species. Initially it was feared that this number was even higher, by some estimates 65 percent of the total species, but several species that were feared extinct have been rediscovered after the Nile perch started to decline in the 1990s. Several of the remaining species are seriously threatened and additional extinctions are possible. Some species have survived in nearby small satellite lakes, have survived in refugias among rocks or papyrus sedges (protecting them from the Nile perch), or have adapted to the human-induced changes in the lake itself. Such adaptions include a larger gill area (adaption for oxygen-poor water), changes in the feeding apparatus, changes to the eyes (giving them better sight in turbid water) and smaller head/larger caudal peduncle (allowing faster swimming). The piscivorous (affected by both predation and competition from Nile perch), molluscivorous and insectivorous haplochromines were particularly hard hit with many extinctions. Others have become extinct in their pure form, but survive as hybrids between close relatives (especially among the detritivores). The zooplanktivores have been least affected and in the late 1990s had reached densities similar to, or above, the densities before the drastic declines, although consisting of fewer species and often switching their diet towards macroinvertebrates. Some of the threatened Lake Victoria cichlid species have captive &quot;insurance&quot; populations in zoos, public aquaria and among private aquarists, and a few species are extinct in the wild (only survive in captivity).

Before the mass extinction that has occurred among the lake&#x27;s cichlids in the last 50 years, about 90 percent of the native fish species in the lake were haplochromines. Disregarding the haplochromines, the only native Victoria cichlids are two critically endangered tilapia, the Singida tilapia or &quot;ngege&quot; (&quot;Oreochromis esculentus&quot;) and Victoria tilapia (&quot;O. variabilis&quot;).

In 1927–1928 Michael Graham conducted the first ever systematic Fisheries Survey of Lake Victoria. In his official report of the expedition, Graham wrote that &quot;The ngege or satu &quot;Tilapia esculenta&quot;, is the most important food fish of the lake, whether for native or non-native consumption. No other fish equals it in the quality of the flesh. It is convenient size for trade, travels well and is found in much greater numbers than other important fish, such as semutundu (Luganda), &quot;Bagrus sp.&quot;&quot;. Furthermore, Graham noted that the introduction of the European flax gill net of 5 inch mesh had undoubtedly caused a diminution in the number of ngege in those parts of the Kavirondo Gulf, the northern shore of the lake, the Sesse Islands and Smith&#x27;s Sound which are conveniently situated close to markets. Survey catches in 1927–28 included several Haplochromis species that are now thought to be extinct, including: &quot;Haplochromis flavipinnis&quot;, &quot;Haplochromis gowersii&quot;, &quot;Haplochromis longirostris&quot;, &quot;Haplochromis macrognathus&quot;, &quot;Haplochromis michaeli&quot;, &quot;Haplochromis nigrescens&quot;, &quot;Haplochromis prognathus&quot;.
As well as being due to the introduction of Nile perch, the extinction of cichlids in the genus &quot;Haplochromis&quot; has also been blamed on the lake&#x27;s eutrophication. The fertility of tropical waters depends on the rate at which nutrients can be brought into solution. The influent rivers of Lake Victoria provide few nutrients to the lake in relation to its size. Because of this, most of Lake Victoria&#x27;s nutrients are thought to be locked up in lake-bottom deposits. By itself, this vegetative matter decays slowly. Animal flesh decays considerably faster, however, so the fertility of the lake is dependent on the rate at which these nutrients can be taken up by fish and other organisms. There is little doubt that &quot;Haplochromis&quot; played an important role in returning detritus and plankton back into solution. With some 80 percent of &quot;Haplochromis&quot; species feeding off detritus, and equally capable of feeding off one another, they represented a tight, internal recycling system, moving nutrients and biomass both vertically and horizontally through the water column, and even out of the lake via predation by humans and terrestrial animals. The removal of &quot;Haplochromis&quot;, however, may have contributed to the increasing frequency of algal blooms, which may in turn be responsible for mass fish kills.

===Other fish===
The non-cichlid native fish include African tetras (&quot;Brycinus&quot;), cyprinids (&quot;Enteromius&quot;, &quot;Garra&quot;, &quot;Labeo&quot;, &quot;Labeobarbus&quot;, &quot;Rastrineobola&quot; and &quot;Xenobarbus&quot;), airbreathing catfish (&quot;Clariallabes&quot;, &quot;Clarias&quot; and &quot;Xenoclarias&quot;), bagrid catfish (&quot;Bagrus&quot;), loach catfish (&quot;Amphilius&quot; and &quot;Zaireichthys&quot;), silver butter catfish (&quot;Schilbe intermedius&quot;), &quot;Synodontis&quot; squeaker catfish, &quot;Nothobranchius&quot; killifish, poeciliids (&quot;Aplocheilichthys&quot; and &quot;Micropanchax&quot;), the spiny eel &quot;Mastacembelus frenatus&quot;, elephantfish (&quot;Gnathonemus&quot;, &quot;Hippopotamyrus&quot;, &quot;Marcusenius&quot;, &quot;Mormyrus&quot;, &quot;Petrocephalus&quot;, and &quot;Pollimyrus&quot;), the climbing gourami &quot;Ctenopoma muriei&quot; and marbled lungfish (&quot;Protopterus aethiopicus&quot;).

At a genus level, most of these are widespread in Africa, but the very rare &quot;Xenobarbus&quot; and &quot;Xenoclarias&quot; are endemic to the lake, and the common &quot;Rastrineobola&quot; is near-endemic.

===Crustaceans===
Four species of freshwater crabs are known from Lake Victoria: &quot;Potamonautes niloticus&quot; is widespread in the lake and &quot;P. emini&quot; has been recorded from the vicinity of Bukoba in Tanzania, but both are also found elsewhere in Africa. The last were first scientifically described in 2017 and very little is known about them: &quot;P. entebbe&quot; is only known from near Entebbe (the only known specimen was collected in 1955 and it is unknown if it was in or near the lake) and &quot;P. busungwe&quot; only at Busungwe Island in the northwestern part of the lake. The latter likely is the smallest African freshwater crab with a carapace width up to about , although &quot;P. kantsyore&quot; of Kagera River, and &quot;Platythelphusa maculata&quot; and &quot;P. polita&quot; of Lake Tanganyika are almost as small.

The only shrimp/prawn is &quot;Caridina nilotica&quot;, which is common and widespread in Lake Victoria.

===Molluscs===
Lake Victoria is home to 28 species of freshwater snails (e.g., &quot;Bellamya&quot;, &quot;Biomphalaria&quot;, &quot;Bulinus&quot;, &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Gabbiella&quot;, and &quot;Melanoides&quot;), including 12 endemic species/subspecies. There are 17 species of bivalves (&quot;Corbicula&quot;, &quot;Coelatura&quot;, &quot;Sphaerium&quot;, and &quot;Byssanodonta&quot;), including 6 endemic species and subspecies. It is likely that undescribed species of snails remain. Conversely, genetic studies indicate that some morphologically distinctive populations, traditionally regarded as separate species, may only be variants of single species. Two of the snail genera, &quot;Biomphalaria&quot; and &quot;Bulinus&quot;, are intermediate hosts of the parasite that causes bilharzia (schistosomiasis). Human infections by this parasite are common at Lake Victoria. This may increase as a result of the spread of the invasive water hyacinth (an optimum snail habitat), and the loss of many snail-eating cichlids in the lake.

===Spiders===
&quot;Evarcha culicivora&quot; is a species of jumping spider (family Salticidae) found only around Lake Victoria in Kenya and Uganda. It feeds primarily on female mosquitos.

==Fisheries==
Lake Victoria supports Africa&#x27;s largest inland fishery (as of 1997). Initially the fishery involved native species, especially tilapia and haplochromine cichlids, but also catfish (&quot;Bagrus&quot;, &quot;Clarias&quot;, &quot;Synodontis&quot; and silver butter catfish), elephantfish, ningu (&quot;Labeo victorianus&quot;) and marbled lungfish (&quot;Protopterus aethiopicus&quot;). Some of these, including tilapia and ningu (&quot;Labeo victorianus&quot;), had already declined in the first half of the 20th century due to overfishing. To boost fishing, several species of non-native tilapia and Nile perch were introduced to the lake in the 1950s. Nevertheless, the natives continued to dominate fisheries until the 1970s where their decline meant that there was a strong shift towards the non-native Nile tilapia (now 7 percent of catches), non-native Nile perch (60 percent) and the native Lake Victoria sardine (30 percent). Because of its small size, the abundant open-water Lake Victoria sardine only supported minor fisheries until the decline of other natives. At the peak in the early 1990s, of Nile perch were landed annually in Lake Victoria, but this has declined significantly in later years.

==Environmental issues==
A number of environmental issues are associated with Lake Victoria and the complete disappearance of many endemic cichlid species has been called the &quot;most dramatic example of human-caused extinctions within an ecosystem&quot;.

===Invasive fish===
Starting in the 1950s, many species have been introduced to Lake Victoria where they have become invasive and a prime reason for the extinction of many endemic haplochromine cichlids. Among the introductions are several tilapias: redbreast (&quot;Coptodon rendalli&quot;), redbelly (&quot;C. zillii&quot;), Nile (&quot;Oreochromis niloticus&quot;) and blue-spotted tilapias (&quot;O. leucostictus&quot;). Although these have contributed to the extinction of native fish by causing significant changes to the ecosystem, outcompeted natives and (in the case of the Nile tilapia) possibly hybridized with the highly threatened native tilapias, the most infamous introduction was the large and highly predatory Nile perch (&quot;Lates niloticus&quot;).
As early as the 1920s, it was proposed to introduce a large pelagic predator such as the Nile perch to improve the fisheries in the lake. At the same time it was warned that this could present a serious danger to the native fish species and required extensive research into possible ecological effects before done. These warnings primarily concerned the native tilapia &quot;O. esculentus&quot;, as the smaller haplochromine cichlids (despite playing an important role in local fisheries) were regarded as &quot;trash fish&quot; by the colonial government. In the following decades, the pressure to introduce the Nile perch continued, as did warnings about the possible effects of doing it. The first introduction of Nile perch to the region, done by the Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (then part of the colonial government) and local African fish guards, happened upstream of Murchison Falls directly after the completion of the Owen Falls Dam in 1954. This allowed it to spread to Lake Kyoga where additional Nile perch were released in 1955, but not Victoria itself. Scientists argued that further introduction should wait until research showed the effect of the introduction in Kyoga, but by the late 1950s, Nile perch began being caught in Lake Victoria. As the species was already present, there were few objections when more Nile perch were transferred to Victoria to further bolster the stock in 1962–63. 

The origin of the first Victoria introductions in the 1950s is not entirely clear and indisputable evidence is lacking. Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (UGFD) officials denied that they were involved, but circumstantial evidence suggests otherwise and local Africans employed by UGFD have said that they introduced the species in 1954–55 under the directive of senior officials. UGFD officials argued that Nile perch must have spread to Lake Victoria by themselves by passing through the Owen Falls Dam when shut down for maintenance, but this is considered highly unlikely by many scientists. The Nile perch had spread throughout the lake by 1970. Initially the population of the Nile perch was relatively low, but a drastic increase happened, peaking in the 1980s, followed by a decline starting in the 1990s.

Due to the presence of the Nile perch, the natural balance of the lake&#x27;s ecosystem has been disrupted. The food chain is being altered and in some cases, broken by the indiscriminate eating habits of the Nile perch.
The subsequent decrease in the number of algae-eating fish allows the algae to grow at an alarming rate, thereby choking the lake. The increasing amounts of algae, in turn, increase the amount of detritus (dead plant material) that falls to the deeper portions of the lake before decomposing. As a by-product of this the oxygen levels in the deeper layer of water are being depleted. Without oxygen, any aerobic life (such as fish) cannot exist in the deeper parts of the lake, forcing all life to exist within a narrow range of depth. In this way, the Nile perch has degraded the diverse and thriving ecosystem that was once Lake Victoria. The abundance of aquatic life is not the only dependent of the lake: more than thirty million people in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda rely on the lake for its natural resources.

Hundreds of endemic species that evolved under the special conditions offered by the protection of Lake Victoria have been lost due to extinction, and several more are still threatened. Their loss is devastating for the lake, the fields of ecology, genetics and evolution biology, and more evidently, for the local fisheries. Local fisheries once depended on catching the lungfish, tilapia, carp and catfish that comprise the local diet.
Today, the composition and yields of such fish catches are virtually negligible. Extensive fish kills, Nile perch, loss of habitat and overfishing have caused many fisheries to collapse and many protein sources to be unavailable at the market for local consumption. Few fisheries, though, have been able to make the switch to catching the Nile perch, since that requires a significant amount of capital resources.

===Water hyacinth invasion===
The water hyacinth has become a major invasive plant species in Lake Victoria.

The release of large amounts of untreated wastewater (sewage) and agricultural and industrial runoff directly into Lake Victoria over the past 30 years has greatly increased the nutrient levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in the lake &quot;triggering massive growth of exotic water hyacinth, which colonised the lake in the late 1990s&quot;. This invasive weed creates anoxic (total depletion of oxygen levels) conditions in the lake, inhibiting decomposing plant material, raising toxicity and disease levels to both fish and people. At the same time, the plant&#x27;s mat or &quot;web&quot; creates a barrier for boats and ferries to maneuver, impedes access to the shoreline, interferes with hydroelectric power generation, and blocks the intake of water for industries. On the other hand, water hyacinth mats can potentially have a positive effect on fish life in that they create a barrier to overfishing and allow for fish growth, there has even been the reappearance of some fish species thought to have been extinct in recent years. The overall effects of the water hyacinth, however, are still unknown.

Growth of the water hyacinth in Lake Victoria has been tracked since 1993, reaching its maxima biomass in 1997 and then declining again by the end of 2001. Greater growth was observed in the northern part of the lake, in relatively protected areas, which may be linked to current and weather patterns and could also be due to the climate and water conditions, which are more suitable to the plants growth (as there are large urban areas to the north end of the lake, in Uganda). The invasive weed was first attempted to be controlled by hand, removed manually from the lake; however, re-growth occurred quickly. Public awareness exercises were also conducted. More recently, measures have been used such as the introduction of natural insect predators, including two different water hyacinth weevils and large harvesting and chopping boats, which seem to be much more effective in eliminating the water hyacinth. A green power plant that uses harvested water hyacinth (but also can use other degradable waste) was constructed in Kisumu County in 2013. In addition to the biogas it produces, its by-product can be used as fertilizer.

Other factors which may have contributed to the decline of the water hyacinth in Lake Victoria include varying weather patterns, such as El Niño during the last few months of 1997 and first six months of 1998 bringing with it higher levels of water in the lake and thus dislodging the plants. Heavy winds and rains along with their subsequent waves may have also damaged the plants during this same time frame. The plants may not have been destroyed, instead merely moved to another location. Additionally, the water quality, nutrient supply, temperature, and other environmental factors could have played a role. Overall, the timing of the decline could be linked to all of these factors and perhaps together, in combination, they were more effective than any one deterrent would have been by itself. The water hyacinth is in remission and this trend could be permanent if control efforts are continued.

=== Pollution ===

Pollution of Lake Victoria is mainly due to discharge of raw sewage into the lake, dumping of domestic and industrial waste, and fertiliser and chemicals from farms.

The Lake Victoria basin, while generally rural, has many major centres of population. Its shores are dotted with key cities and towns, including Kisumu, Kisii, and Homa Bay in Kenya; Kampala, Jinja and Entebbe in Uganda; and Bukoba, Mwanza, and Musoma in Tanzania. These cities and towns are also home to many factories that discharge some chemicals directly into the lake or its influent rivers. The set up of small beaches and local authorities around the lake lack proper sewage treatment facilities allowing pollutants to find their way into the water. Large parts of these urban areas also discharge untreated (raw) sewage into the river, increasing its eutrophication that in turn is helping to increase the invasive water hyacinth. Increased logging and act of deforestation has led to environmental degradation around the region reducing the absorption of polluting chemicals and deteriorating the water quality.

=== Environmental data ===
As of 2016, an environmental data repository exists for Lake Victoria. The repository contains shoreline, bathymetry, pollution, temperature, wind vector, and other important data for both the lake and the wider Basin.

== History and exploration ==

The first recorded information about Lake Victoria comes from Arab traders plying the inland routes in search of gold, ivory, other precious commodities, and slaves.

The lake existed and was known to many Africans in the catchment area who left no written records long before it was sighted by a European in 1858 when the British explorer John Hanning Speke reached its southern shore while on his journey with Richard Francis Burton to explore central Africa and locate the Great Lakes. Believing he had found the source of the Nile on seeing this &quot;vast expanse of open water&quot; for the first time, Speke named the lake after Queen Victoria. Burton, who had been recovering from illness at the time and resting further south in Kazeh (near present-day Tabora), was outraged that Speke claimed to have proved his discovery to have been the true source of the Nile River, which Burton regarded as still unsettled. A very public quarrel ensued, which not only sparked a great deal of intense debate within the scientific community of the day, but also much interest by other explorers keen to either confirm or refute Speke&#x27;s discovery.

In the late 1860s, the famous Scottish explorer and missionary David Livingstone failed in his attempt to verify Speke&#x27;s discovery, instead pushing too far west and entering the River Congo system instead. Ultimately, the Welsh-American explorer Henry Morton Stanley, on an expedition funded by the &quot;New York Herald&quot; newspaper, confirmed the truth of Speke&#x27;s discovery, circumnavigating the lake and reporting the great outflow at Ripon Falls on the lake&#x27;s northern shore.

== Water use ==
Many towns and cities are reliant on Lake Victoria for their water supplies, for farming and other uses.

=== Lamadi water scheme ===
The Lamadi water scheme is a water and sanitation project that serves Mwanza and the satellite towns of Lamadi, Misungwi, Magu, Bukoba, and Musoma on the bank of Lake Victoria.  European Investment Bank started the project in 2013 with the aim of protecting the environmental health of the lake, through improved water and sanitation to the towns whose pollution is part of the degradation of the lake. The project aims to provide safe drinking water for an estimated one million people and improved sanitation for 100 000 people. Sediment and suspended solids are filtered out using sand, which acts like a sieve. The water is then ready to be chlorinated or treated in another way. The sand filtration helps reduce water-borne diseases and is based on the use of the local environment.

===Nalubaale Dam===
The only outflow for Lake Victoria is at Jinja, Uganda, where it forms the Victoria Nile. The water for at least 12,000 years has drained across a natural rock weir. In 1952, engineers acting for the government of Colonial Uganda blasted out the weir and reservoir to replace it with an artificial barrage to control the level of the lake and reduce the gradual erosion of the rock weir. A standard for mimicking the old rate of outflow called the &quot;agreed curve&quot; was established, setting the maximum flow rate at 300 to 1,700 cubic metres per second (392–2,224 cu yd/sec) depending on the lake&#x27;s water level.

In 2002, Uganda completed a second hydroelectric complex in the area, the Kiira Hydroelectric Power Station, with World Bank assistance. By 2006, the water levels in Lake Victoria had reached an 80-year low, and Daniel Kull, an independent hydrologist living in Nairobi, Kenya, calculated that Uganda was releasing about twice as much water as is allowed under the agreement, and was primarily responsible for recent drops in the lake&#x27;s level.

==Transport==

Since the 1900s, Lake Victoria ferries have been an important means of transport between Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya. The main ports on the lake are Kisumu, Mwanza, Bukoba, Entebbe, Port Bell, and Jinja. Until 1963, the fastest and newest ferry, MV &quot;Victoria&quot;, was designated a Royal Mail Ship. In 1966, train ferry services between Kenya and Tanzania were established with the introduction of and . The ferry MV &quot;Bukoba&quot; sank in the lake on 21 May 1996 with a loss of between 800 and 1,000 lives, making it one of Africa&#x27;s worst maritime disasters. Another tragedy occurred recently on 20 September 2018 that involved the passagers ferry MV Nyerere from Tanzania that caused the deaths of over 200 people.

On 6 November 2022, Lake Victoria was the site of a commercial passenger aircraft crash. Precision Air Flight 494 an ATR 42–500 carrying 39 passengers and four crew, crashed while approaching Bukoba Airport, resulting in 19 fatalities.

<text>The Abbey Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, commonly known as Bath Abbey, is a parish church of the Church of England and former Benedictine monastery in Bath, Somerset, England. Founded in the 7th century, it was reorganised in the 10th century and rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries; major restoration work was carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s. It is one of the largest examples of Perpendicular Gothic architecture in the West Country. The medieval abbey church served as a sometime cathedral of a bishop. After long contention between churchmen in Bath and Wells the seat of the Diocese of Bath and Wells was later consolidated at Wells Cathedral. The Benedictine community was dissolved in 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

The church architecture is cruciform in plan and can seat up to 1,200 patrons. An active place of worship, it also hosts civic ceremonies, concerts and lectures. There is a heritage museum in the cellars.

The abbey is a Grade I listed building, particularly noted for its fan vaulting. It contains war memorials for the local population and monuments to several notable people, in the form of wall and floor plaques and commemorative stained glass. The church has two organs and a peal of ten bells. The west front includes sculptures of angels climbing to heaven on two stone ladders, representing Jacob&#x27;s Ladder.

==History==
===Early history===

In 675 AD, Osric, King of the Hwicce, granted the Abbess Berta or Bertana 100 hides near Bath for the establishment of a convent. This religious house became a monastery under the patronage of the Bishop of Worcester.
King Offa of Mercia successfully wrested &quot;that most famous monastery at Bath&quot; from the bishop in 781. William of Malmesbury tells that Offa rebuilt the monastic church, which may have occupied the site of an earlier pagan temple, to such a standard that King Eadwig was moved to describe it as being &quot;marvellously built&quot;. In 944 Folcwin reformed the Abbey of Saint Bertin in France along Benedictine lines and monks who opposed the reform fled to England. King Edmund I gave them the church at Bath, which was then in royal hands. Little is known about the architecture of this first building on the site. Monasticism in England had declined by that time, but Eadwig&#x27;s brother Edgar (who was crowned &quot;King of the English&quot; at the abbey in 973) began its revival on his accession to the throne in 959. He encouraged monks to adopt the Rule of Saint Benedict, which was introduced at Bath under Abbot Ælfheah (St. Alphege), who also repaired the church. Sometime in the 10th century, as a result of the monastic reforms of Oswald and Dunstan, the monastic community of the site was re-established as a Benedictine monastery, which it remained until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century.

===Norman Conquest to the Dissolution===

Bath was ravaged in the power struggle between the sons of William the Conqueror following his death in 1087. The victor, William II Rufus, granted the city to a royal physician, John of Tours, who became Bishop of Wells and Abbot of Bath. Shortly after his consecration John bought Bath Abbey&#x27;s grounds from the king, as well as the city of Bath itself. Whether John paid Rufus for the city or whether he was given it as a gift by the king is unclear. The abbey had recently lost its abbot, Ælfsige, and according to Domesday Book was the owner of large estates in and near the city; it was likely the abbey&#x27;s wealth that attracted John to take over the monastery. By acquiring Bath, John also acquired the mint that was in the city.

In 1090 he transferred the seat, or administration, of the bishopric to Bath Abbey, probably in an attempt to increase the revenues of his see. Bath was a rich abbey, and Wells had always been a poor diocese. By taking over the abbey, John increased his episcopal revenues. William of Malmesbury portrays the moving of the episcopal seat as motivated by a desire for the lands of the abbey, but it was part of a pattern at the time of moving cathedral seats from small villages to larger towns. When John moved his episcopal seat, he also took over the abbey of Bath as his cathedral chapter, turning his diocese into a bishopric served by monks instead of the canons at Wells who had previously served the diocese. John rebuilt the monastic church at Bath, which had been damaged during one of Robert de Mowbray&#x27;s rebellions. Permission was given to move the see of Somerset from Wells—a comparatively small settlement—to the then walled city of Bath.

When this was effected in 1090, John became the first Bishop of Bath, and St Peter&#x27;s was raised to cathedral status. As the roles of bishop and abbot had been combined, the monastery became a priory, run by its prior. With the elevation of the abbey to cathedral status, it was felt that a larger, more up-to-date building was required. John of Tours planned a new cathedral on a grand scale, dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul, but only the ambulatory was complete when he died in December 1122. He was buried in the cathedral. The most renowned scholar monk based in the abbey was Adelard of Bath; after his various travels he was back in the monastery by 1106.

The half-finished cathedral was devastated by fire in 1137, but work continued under Godfrey, the new bishop, until about 1156; the completed building was approximately long. It was consecrated while Robert of Bath was bishop. The specific date is not known; however, it was between 1148 and 1161.

In 1197, Reginald Fitz Jocelin&#x27;s successor, Savaric FitzGeldewin, with the approval of Pope Celestine III, officially moved his seat to Glastonbury Abbey, but the monks there would not accept their new Bishop of Glastonbury and the title of Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury was used until the Glastonbury claim was abandoned in 1219. Savaric&#x27;s successor, Jocelin of Wells, again moved the bishop&#x27;s seat to Bath Abbey, with the title Bishop of Bath. Following his death the monks of Bath unsuccessfully attempted to regain authority over Wells. There were 40 monks on the roll in 1206.

Joint cathedral status was awarded by Pope Innocent IV to Bath and Wells in 1245. Roger of Salisbury was appointed the first Bishop of Bath and Wells, having been Bishop of Bath for a year previously. Later bishops preferred Wells, the canons of which had successfully petitioned various popes down the years for Wells to regain cathedral status. The great Romanesque cathedral church, begun in the early twelfth century, was allowed to fall into chronic disrepair during the fifteenth century. In 1485 the priory had 22 monks. When Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells (1495–1503), visited Bath in 1499 he was shocked to find this famous church &quot;ruined to its foundations&quot;. He also described lax discipline, idleness and a group of monks &quot;all too eager to succumb to the temptations of the flesh&quot;.

King took a year to consider what action to take, before writing to the Prior of Bath in October 1500 to explain that a large amount of the priory income would be dedicated to rebuilding the cathedral. There are several stories that, on a visit to Bath, King had a dream in which he &quot;saw the Heavenly Host on high with angels ascending and descending by ladder&quot; which is now represented on the west front of the cathedral. However, this interpretation, which first appeared in the writings of John Harington, around 100 years after it was supposed to have happened, has been challenged.

Robert and William Vertue, the king&#x27;s masons were commissioned, promising to build the finest vault in England, promising &quot;there shall be none so goodely neither in England nor France&quot;. Their design incorporated the surviving Norman crossing wall and arches. They appointed Thomas Lynne to supervise work on site and work probably began the following spring. Oliver King planned a smaller church, covering the area of the Norman nave only. He did not live to see the result, but the restoration of the cathedral was completed just a few years before the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539.

===Reformation and subsequent decline===
Prior Holloway surrendered Bath Priory to the crown in January 1539. It was sold to Humphry Colles of Taunton. The abbey was stripped of its co-cathedral status in the aftermath of the Dissolution when the cathedral was consolidated in Wells. The church was stripped of iron, glass and £4,800 worth of lead and left to decay. Colles sold it to Matthew Colthurst of Wardour Castle in 1543. His son Edmund Colthurst gave the roofless remains of the building to the corporation of Bath in 1572. The corporation had difficulty finding private funds for its restoration.

In 1574, Queen Elizabeth I promoted the restoration of the church, to serve as the grand parish church of Bath. She ordered that a national fund should be set up to finance the work, and in 1583 decreed that it should become the parish church of Bath. James Montague, the Bishop of Bath and Wells from 1608 to 1616, paid £1,000 for a new nave roof of timber lath construction; according to the inscription on his tomb, this was prompted after seeking shelter in the roofless nave during a thunderstorm. He is buried in an alabaster tomb in the north aisle. The restoration work on the Abbey financed by Montague was completed by 1611.

===Modern renaissance===

During the 1820s and 1830s buildings, including houses, shops and taverns which were very close to or actually touching the walls of the abbey were demolished and the interior remodelled by George Phillips Manners who was the Bath City Architect. Manners erected flying buttresses to the exterior of the nave and added pinnacles to the turrets.

Major restoration work was carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s, funded by the rector, Charles Kemble. The work included the installation of fan vaulting in the nave, which was not merely a fanciful aesthetic addition but a completion of the original design. Oliver King had arranged for the vaulting of the choir, to a design by William and Robert Vertue. There are clues in the stonework that King intended the vaulting to continue into the nave, but that this plan was abandoned, probably for reasons of cost. In addition a stone screen between the choir and nave was removed. Scott&#x27;s work was completed by his pupil Thomas Graham Jackson in the 1890s including work on the west front. Gilbert-Scott also designed the finely-carved pews in the nave, and are among the finest examples of Church seating from the period, and have been described as &quot;one of the most magnificent and extensive suites of Victorian church seating in the country&quot;.

Work carried out in the 20th and 21st centuries included full cleaning of the stonework and the reconstruction of the pipe organ by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn. The west
front of the building, having decayed badly in the 500 years since it was built, has been subject to almost wholesale restoration. The stonework of the west front had been subject to natural erosion therefore a process of lime-based conservation was carried out during the 1990s by Nimbus Conservation under the guidance of Professor Robert Baker who had previously worked on the west front of Wells Cathedral. Some of the damage to sculptures had been made worse by the use of Portland cement by previous work carried out in the Victorian era. A statue of St Phillip was beyond repair and was removed and replaced with a modern statue by Laurence Tindall.

==Architecture==
The Abbey is built of Bath stone, which gives the exterior its yellow colour, and is not a typical example of the Perpendicular form of Gothic architecture; the low aisles and nave arcades and the very tall clerestory present the opposite balance to that which was usual in perpendicular churches. As this building was to serve as a monastic church, it was built to a cruciform plan, which had become relatively rare in parish churches of the time. The interior contains fine fan vaulting by Robert and William Vertue, who designed similar vaulting for the Henry VII chapel, at Westminster Abbey. The building has 52 windows, occupying about 80% of the wall space, giving the interior an impression of lightness, and reflecting the different attitudes towards churchmanship shown by the clergy of the time and those of the 12th century.

The walls and roofs are supported by buttresses and surmounted by battlements, pinnacles and pierced parapets, many of which were added by George Manners during his 1830s restorations.

The nave, which has five bays, is long and wide to the pillars and rises to , with the whole church being long and wide.

The west front, which was originally constructed in 1520, has a large arched window and detailed carvings. Above the window are carvings of angels and to either side long stone ladders with angels climbing up them. Apart from the story mentioned above connecting it with Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells (1495–1503), this is a direct reference to the dream of the patriarch Jacob mentioned in the Bible (Genesis 28:12) and commonly called Jacob&#x27;s Ladder.

Below the window a battlemented parapet supports a statue and beneath this, on either side of the door, are statues of St Peter and St Paul. Restoration work in the late 20th century involved cleaning with electronically controlled intermittent water sprays and ammonium carbonate poultices. One of the figures which had lost its head and shoulders was replaced. The sculptures on the West front have been interpreted as representing &quot;spiritual ascent through the virtue of humility and descent through the vice of pride&quot; and Christ as the Man of Sorrow and the Antichrist. During the 1990s a major restoration and cleaning work were carried out on the exterior stonework, returning it to the yellow colour hidden under centuries of dirt.
===Windows===

The building has 52 windows, occupying about 80 per cent of the wall space. The east end has a square-framed window of seven lights. It includes a depiction of the nativity made by Clayton and Bell in 1872, and was presented to the church by the Bath Literary Club.

The window of the Four Evangelists over the northwest door is a memorial to Charles Empson, who died in 1861.

In 2010 a stained glass window was uncovered in the abbey vaults. The design around the window is by William Burges.

===Tower===
The two-stage central tower is not square but oblong in plan. It has two bell openings on each side and four polygonal turret pinnacles. The tower is high, and is accessed by a staircase of 212 steps.

====Bells====
In 1700 the old ring of six bells was replaced by a new ring of eight. All but the tenor still survive. In 1770 two lighter bells were added to create the first ring of ten bells in the diocese. The tenor was recast in 1870. The abbey&#x27;s tower is now home to a ring of ten bells, which are hung unconventionally such that the order of the bells from highest to lowest runs anti-clockwise around the ringing chamber, rather than in the usual clockwise fashion. The tenor weighs 33 cwt (3,721 lb or 1,688 kg). Bath is a noted centre of change ringing in the West Country.

===Interior===
The interior fan vaulting ceiling, originally installed by Robert and William Vertue, was restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott between 1864 and 1874. The fan vaulting provides structural stability by distributing the weight of the roof down ribs that transfer the force into the supporting columns via the flying buttresses.

Gilbert Scott&#x27;s work in the 1870s included the installation of large gas chandeliers made by the Coventry metalworker Francis Skidmore. They were converted to electricity in 1979. Other new features included a new pulpit and seating. A marble altarpiece from General George Wade in the sanctuary was removed and replaced with a decorative reredos. Pews installed in the nave during Scott&#x27;s renovations were replaced with stackable chairs in 2018, a move which was opposed by the Victorian Society leading to a Consistory court case which was decided in favour of the Abbey.

In the 1920s Thomas Graham Jackson redesigned the Norman Chapel into a War Memorial Chapel, now Gethsemane Chapel, and added a cloister. New quire screens were installed in 2004, partly to improve the acoustics, topped with 12 carved angels playing musical instruments.

A tiled floor dating from the late 13th to early 14th centuries was discovered in August 2018. Work to rebury coffins which had previously been under the abbey and stabilise the floor included the digging of a trench in which the tiles were uncovered.

====Monuments====

Within the abbey are 617 wall memorials and 847 floor stones. They include those dedicated to Beau Nash, Admiral Arthur Phillip (first Governor of the colony of New South Wales, which became part of Australia after federation in 1901), James Montague (Bishop of Bath and Wells), Lady Waller (wife of William Waller, a Roundhead military leader in the English Civil War), Elizabeth Grieve (wife of James Grieve, physician to Elizabeth, Empress of Russia), Sir William Baker, John Sibthorp, Richard Hussey Bickerton, William Hoare, Richard Bickerton and US Senator William Bingham. Many of the monuments in the churchyard were carved between 1770 and 1860 by Reeves of Bath. War memorials include those commemorating the First Anglo-Afghan War (1841–42), the First World War (1914–18), and the Second World War (1939–45). The most recent memorial was installed in 1958 to commemorate Isaac Pitman, the developer of Pitman shorthand, who died in 1897.

====Main organ====
The first mention of an organ in the abbey dates to 1634, but nothing is known of that instrument. The first properly recorded organ in Bath Abbey was built by Abraham Jordan in 1708. It was modified in 1718 and 1739 by Jordan&#x27;s son. The specification recorded in 1800 was one of twenty stops spread over three manuals. The compasses of the manuals were extended, one and a half octaves of pedals were added and the instrument renovated in 1802 by John Holland; further repairs were effected by Flight &amp; Robson in 1826. This instrument was removed first to the Bishop&#x27;s Palace at Wells in 1836, then to St Mary&#x27;s Church, Yatton, where it was subsequently rebuilt and extensively modified.

The abbey&#x27;s next organ was built in 1836 by John Smith of Bristol, to a specification of thirty stops over three manuals and pedals. This instrument was rebuilt on a new gallery in the North Transept by William Hill &amp; Son of London in 1868, to a specification of forty stops spread over four manuals and pedals, although the Solo department, which would have brought the total to well over forty, was not completed. It was mostly removed to the Church of St Peter &amp; St Paul, Cromer in 1896, the remainder being kept for incorporation in the new abbey organ.

A new organ was supplied to the abbey in 1895 by Norman and Beard of Norwich. It had 52 stops spread over four manuals and pedals, and stood divided on two steel beams in the North and South crossing arches, with the console standing on the floor next to the north-west pier of the crossing. New cases were to be provided to designs by Brian Oliver of Bath, but were never executed. Norman &amp; Beard re-erected it in a new case designed by Sir Thomas Jackson in the North Transept in 1914, with the addition of two stops to the Pedal.
It was again rebuilt by them in 1930, and then by Hill, Norman and Beard in 1948, which brought the number of stops to 58. In 1972 this was increased to a total of 65 speaking stops. The Positive division, with its separate case behind the console, was installed at the same time. Problems caused by the tonal scheme&#x27;s lack of coherence—the 1895 pipework contrasting sharply with that of 1972—and with reliability, caused by the wide variety of different types of key actions, all difficult to access, led to the decision to have the instrument rebuilt yet again.

The organ was totally reconstructed in 1997 by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn, retaining the existing instrument as far as was possible and restoring it largely to its 1895 condition, although the Positive division was kept. The instrument as it now stands has 63 speaking stops over four manuals and pedals, and is built largely on the Werkprinzip principle of organ layout: the case is only one department deep, except for parts of the Pedal sited at the back rather than the sides of the case. New 75 per cent tin front pipes were made and the case completed with back, side walls and roof. Pierced panelling executed by Derek Riley of Lyndale Woodcarving in Saxmundham, Suffolk, was provided to allow sound egress from the bottom of the case. The old console has been retained but thoroughly rebuilt with modern accessories and all-new manuals. Twenty-two of the organ&#x27;s 83 ranks contain some pipework from the 1868 instrument. Four ranks are made up entirely of 1868 pipework, and 21 contain 1895 pipework. Only two ranks are entirely of 1895. Forty-eight ranks contain some new pipework, 34 of which are entirely new. Old wind pressures have been used wherever possible. The old wind reservoirs have also been restored rather than replaced. The instrument has tracker key action on the manuals, with electrically assisted tracker action to the pedals. The stop action is electric throughout.

====Continuo organ====

A four-stop continuo organ was built for the abbey in 1999 by Northampton-based organ builder Kenneth Tickell. The instrument, contained in a case of dark oak, is portable, and can be tuned to three pitches: A=440 Hz (modern concert pitch), A=415 Hz and A=465 Hz. It is also possible to tune at A=430. A lever pedal can reduce the stops sounding to only the 8&#x27; stop and, when released, returns the organ to the registration in use before it was depressed.

==Choir==
The abbey has sections for boys, girls, lay clerks and children (the Melody Makers) and a chamber choir. As well as singing at the abbey, they also tour to cathedrals in the UK and Europe. The choir has broadcast Choral Evensong on BBC Radio 3, and has made several recordings. It performed at the Three Tenors concert for the opening of the Thermae Bath Spa. The abbey is also used as a venue for visiting choirs and, from its inception in 1947, the City of Bath Bach Choir.

The choirs of Bath Abbey sung the 2015 Christmas Service live on BBC One.

They are led by the directors of music and assisted by the organists. The current Director of Music is Huw Williams who took the role in 2017. He replaced Peter King who served from 1986 to 2016.

==Discovery Centre museum==
Bath Abbey&#x27;s Discovery Centre is located beneath the Abbey shop and features artefacts and exhibits about the Abbey&#x27;s development and history.

<doc id="72987" wikidata="Q29265" url="?curid=72987" title="Canterbury Cathedral">
<text>Canterbury Cathedral is the cathedral of the archbishop of Canterbury, the spiritual leader of the Church of England and symbolic leader of the worldwide Anglican Communion. Located in Canterbury, Kent, it is one of the oldest Christian structures in England and forms part of a World Heritage Site. Its formal title is the Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Christ, Canterbury.

Founded in 597, the cathedral was completely rebuilt between 1070 and 1077. The east end was greatly enlarged at the beginning of the 12th century, and largely rebuilt in the Gothic style following a fire in 1174, with significant eastward extensions to accommodate the flow of pilgrims visiting the shrine of Thomas Becket, the archbishop who was murdered in the cathedral in 1170. The Norman nave and transepts survived until the late 14th century, when they were demolished to make way for the present structures.

Before the English Reformation, the cathedral was part of a Benedictine monastic community known as Christ Church, Canterbury, as well as being the seat of the archbishop.

== History ==
=== Roman ===
Christianity in Britain is referred to by Tertullian as early as 208 AD and Origen mentions it in 238 AD. In 314 three Bishops from Britain attended the Council of Arles. Following the end of Roman life in Britain, during the first three decades of the fifth century, and the subsequent arrival of the heathen Anglo-Saxons, Christian life in the east of the island was disrupted. Textual sources however suggest that the Christian communities established in the Roman province survived in Western Britain during the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries. This Western British Christianity proceeded to develop on its own terms.

In 596, Pope Gregory I ordered Augustine, the abbot of St Andrew&#x27;s Benedictine Abbey in Rome, to lead the Gregorian Mission to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. According to the writings of the later monk Bede, these Augustinian missionaries gained permission from the Kentish king to restore several pre-existing churches. Augustine then founded Canterbury cathedral in 597 and dedicated it to Jesus Christ, the Holy Saviour. When other dioceses were founded in England, Augustine of Canterbury was made archbishop.

Augustine also founded the Abbey of St Peter and Paul outside the Canterbury city walls. This was later rededicated to St Augustine himself and was for many centuries the burial place of the successive archbishops. The abbey is part of the World Heritage Site of Canterbury, along with the cathedral and the ancient Church of St Martin.

=== Early Medieval ===
Bede recorded that Augustine reused a former Roman church. The oldest remains found during excavations beneath the present nave in 1993 were, however, parts of the foundations of an Anglo-Saxon building, which had been constructed across a Roman road. They indicate that the original church consisted of a nave, possibly with a narthex, and side-chapels to the north and south. A smaller subsidiary building was found to the south-west of these foundations. During the 9th or 10th century this church was replaced by a larger structure () with a squared west end. It appears to have had a square central tower. The 11th-century chronicler Eadmer, who had known the Saxon cathedral as a boy, wrote that, in its arrangement, it resembled St Peter&#x27;s in Rome, indicating that it was of basilican form, with an eastern apse.

During the reforms of Dunstan, archbishop from 960 until his death in 988, a Benedictine abbey named Christ Church Priory was added to the cathedral. But the formal establishment as a monastery seems to date only to and the community only became fully monastic from Lanfranc&#x27;s time onwards (with monastic constitutions addressed by him to Prior Henry). Dunstan was buried on the south side of the high altar.

Anglo-Saxon King Æthelred the Unready and Norman-born Emma of Normandy were married at Canterbury Cathedral in the Spring of 1002, and Emma was consecrated &quot;Queen Ælfgifu&quot;.

The cathedral was badly damaged during Danish raids on Canterbury in 1011. The archbishop, Ælfheah, was taken hostage by the raiders and eventually killed at Greenwich on 19 April 1012, the first of Canterbury&#x27;s five martyred archbishops. After this a western apse was added as an oratory of Saint Mary, probably during the archbishopric of Lyfing (1013–1020) or Aethelnoth (1020–1038).

The 1993 excavations revealed that the new western apse was polygonal, and flanked by hexagonal towers, forming a westwork. It housed the archbishop&#x27;s throne, with the altar of St Mary just to the east. At about the same time that the westwork was built, the arcade walls were strengthened and towers added to the eastern corners of the church.

===Norman ===
The cathedral was destroyed by fire in 1067, a year after the Norman Conquest. Rebuilding began in 1070 under the first Norman archbishop, Lanfranc (1070–1077). He cleared the ruins and reconstructed the cathedral to a design based closely on that of the Abbey of Saint-Étienne in Caen, where he had previously been abbot, using stone brought from France. The new church, its central axis about 5 m south of that of its predecessor, was a cruciform building, with an aisled nave of nine bays, a pair of towers at the west end, aisleless transepts with apsidal chapels, a low crossing tower, and a short quire ending in three apses. It was dedicated in 1077.
Under Lanfranc&#x27;s successor Anselm, who was twice exiled from England, the responsibility for the rebuilding or improvement of the cathedral&#x27;s fabric was largely left in the hands of the priors. Following the election of Prior Ernulf in 1096, Lanfranc&#x27;s inadequate east end was demolished, and replaced with an eastern arm 198 feet long, doubling the length of the cathedral. It was raised above a large and elaborately decorated crypt. Ernulf was succeeded in 1107 by Conrad, who completed the work by 1126. The new quire took the form of a complete church in itself, with its own transepts; the east end was semicircular in plan, with three chapels opening off an ambulatory. A free-standing campanile was built on a mound in the cathedral precinct in about 1160.

As with many Gothic church buildings, the interior of the quire was richly embellished. William of Malmesbury wrote: &quot;Nothing like it could be seen in England either for the light of its glass windows, the gleaming of its marble pavements, or the many-coloured paintings which led the eyes to the paneled ceiling above.&quot;

Though named after the 6th-century founding archbishop, the Chair of St Augustine, the ceremonial enthronement chair of the Archbishop of Canterbury, may date from the Norman period. Its first recorded use is in 1205.

=== Plantagenet period ===
==== Martyrdom of Thomas Becket ====
A pivotal moment in the history of the cathedral was the murder of the archbishop, Thomas Becket, in the north-west transept (also known as the Martyrdom) on Tuesday 29 December 1170, by knights of King Henry II. The king had frequent conflicts with the strong-willed Becket and is said to have exclaimed in frustration, &quot;Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?&quot; Four knights took it literally and murdered Becket in his own cathedral. After the Anglo-Saxon Ælfheah in 1012, Becket was the second Archbishop of Canterbury to be murdered.

The posthumous veneration of Becket transformed the cathedral into a place of pilgrimage, necessitating both expansion of the building and an increase in wealth, via revenues from pilgrims, in order to make expansion possible.

==== Rebuilding of the quire ====

In September 1174 the quire was severely damaged by fire, necessitating a major reconstruction, the progress of which was recorded in detail by a monk named Gervase. The crypt survived the fire intact, and it was found possible to retain the outer walls of the quire, which were increased in height by in the course of the rebuilding, but with the round-headed form of their windows left unchanged. Everything else was replaced in the new Gothic style, with pointed arches, rib vaulting, and flying buttresses. The limestone used was imported from Caen in Normandy, and Purbeck marble was used for the shafting. The quire was back in use by 1180 and in that year the remains of Dunstan and Ælfheah were moved there from the crypt.

The master-mason appointed to rebuild the quire was a Frenchman, William of Sens. Following his injury in a fall from the scaffolding in 1179 he was replaced by one of his former assistants, known as William the Englishman.

==== Trinity Chapel and Shrine of Thomas Becket ====
In 1180–1184, in place of the old, square-ended, eastern chapel, the present Trinity Chapel was constructed, a broad extension with an ambulatory, designed to house the shrine of St Thomas Becket. A further chapel, circular in plan, was added beyond that, which housed further relics of Becket, widely believed to have included the top of his skull, struck off in the course of his assassination. This latter chapel became known as the &quot;Corona&quot; or &quot;Becket&#x27;s Crown&quot;. These new parts east of the quire transepts were raised on a higher crypt than Ernulf&#x27;s quire, necessitating flights of steps between the two levels. Work on the chapel was completed in 1184, but Becket&#x27;s remains were not moved from his tomb in the crypt until 1220. Further significant interments in the Trinity Chapel included those of Edward Plantagenet (The &quot;Black Prince&quot;) and King Henry IV.

The shrine in the Trinity Chapel was placed directly above Becket&#x27;s original tomb in the crypt. A marble plinth, raised on columns, supported what an early visitor, Walter of Coventry, described as &quot;a coffin wonderfully wrought of gold and silver, and marvellously adorned with precious gems&quot;. Other accounts make clear that the gold was laid over a wooden chest, which in turn contained an iron-bound box holding Becket&#x27;s remains. Further votive treasures were added to the adornments of the chest over the years, while others were placed on pedestals or beams nearby, or attached to hanging drapery. For much of the time, the chest (or &quot;feretory&quot;) was kept concealed by a wooden cover, which would be theatrically raised by ropes once a crowd of pilgrims had gathered. The Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus, who visited in 1512–1514, recorded that, once the cover was raised, &quot;the Prior ... pointed out each jewel, telling its name in French, its value, and the name of its donor; for the principal of them were offerings sent by sovereign princes.&quot;

The income from pilgrims (such as those portrayed in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;) who visited Becket&#x27;s shrine, which was regarded as a place of healing, largely paid for the subsequent rebuilding of the cathedral and its associated buildings. This revenue included the profits from the sale of pilgrim badges depicting Becket, his martyrdom, or his shrine.

The shrine was removed in 1538. King Henry VIII allegedly summoned the dead saint to court to face charges of treason. Having failed to appear, he was found guilty in his absence and the treasures of his shrine were confiscated, carried away in two coffers and 26 carts.

==== Monastic buildings ====
A bird&#x27;s-eye view of the cathedral and its monastic buildings, made in about 1165 and known as the &quot;waterworks plan&quot; is preserved in the Eadwine Psalter in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge. A detailed description of the plan can be found in the classic paper by Willis. It shows that Canterbury employed the same general principles of arrangement common to all Benedictine monasteries, although, unusually, the cloister and monastic buildings were to the north, rather than the south of the church. There was a separate chapter-house which still exists, said to be &quot;the largest of its kind in all of England&quot;. Stained glass here depicts the history of Canterbury.
The buildings formed separate groups around the church. Adjoining it, on the north side, stood the cloister and the buildings devoted to the monastic life. To the east and west of these were those devoted to the exercise of hospitality. Also to the east was the infirmary, with its own chapel. To the north, a large open court divided the monastic buildings from menial ones, such as the stables, granaries, barn, bakehouse, brewhouse, and laundries, inhabited by the lay servants of the establishment. At the greatest possible distance from the church, beyond the precinct of the monastery, was the eleemosynary department. The almonry for the relief of the poor, with a great hall annexed, formed the paupers&#x27; hospitium.

The group of buildings devoted to monastic life included two cloisters. The great cloister was surrounded by the buildings essentially connected with the daily life of the monks: the church to the south, with the refectory placed as always on the side opposite, the dormitory, raised on a vaulted undercroft, and the chapter-house adjacent, and the lodgings of the cellarer, responsible for providing both monks and guests with food, to the west. A passage under the dormitory led eastwards to the smaller or infirmary cloister, appropriated to sick and infirm monks.

The hall and chapel of the infirmary extended east of this cloister, resembling in form and arrangement the nave and chancel of an aisled church. Beneath the dormitory, overlooking the green court or herbarium, lay the &quot;pisalis&quot; or &quot;calefactory&quot;, the common room of the monks. At its northeast corner access was given from the dormitory to the necessarium, a building in the form of a Norman hall, long by broad, containing 55 seats. It was constructed with careful regard to hygiene, with a stream of water running through it from end to end.

A second smaller dormitory for the conventual officers ran from east to west. Close to the refectory, but outside the cloisters, were the domestic offices connected with it: to the north, the kitchen, square, with a pyramidal roof, and the kitchen court; to the west, the butteries, pantries, etc. The infirmary had a small kitchen of its own. Opposite the refectory door in the cloister were two buildings where the monks washed before and after eating. One of these is the circular two-storey lavatorium tower. To the south of the infirmary cloister, close to the east end of the cathedral, is the treasury, with a distinctive octapartite vault.

The buildings devoted to hospitality were divided into three groups. The prior&#x27;s group were &quot;entered at the south-east angle of the green court, placed near the most sacred part of the cathedral, as befitting the distinguished ecclesiastics or nobility who were assigned to him.&quot; The cellarer&#x27;s buildings, where middle-class visitors were entertained, stood near the west end of the nave. The inferior pilgrims and paupers were relegated to the north hall or almonry, just within the gate.

Priors of Christ Church Priory included John of Sittingbourne (elected 1222, previously a monk of the priory) and William Chillenden, (elected 1264, previously monk and treasurer of the priory). The monastery was granted the right to elect their own prior if the seat was vacant by the pope, and – from Gregory IX onwards – the right to a free election (though with the archbishop overseeing their choice). Monks of the priory have included Æthelric I, Æthelric II, Walter d&#x27;Eynsham, Reginald fitz Jocelin (admitted as a confrater shortly before his death), Nigel de Longchamps and Ernulf. The monks often put forward candidates for Archbishop of Canterbury, either from among their number or outside, since the archbishop was nominally their abbot, but this could lead to clashes with the king or pope should they put forward a different man – examples are the elections of Baldwin of Forde and Thomas Cobham.

==== 14th and 15th centuries ====
Early in the 14th century, Prior Eastry erected a stone quire screen and rebuilt the chapter house, and his successor, Prior Oxenden inserted a large five-light window into St Anselm&#x27;s chapel.

The cathedral was seriously damaged by the 1382 Dover Straits earthquake, losing its bells and campanile.

From the late 14th century the nave and transepts were rebuilt, on the Norman foundations in the Perpendicular style under the direction of the noted master mason Henry Yevele. In contrast to the contemporary rebuilding of the nave at Winchester, where much of the existing fabric was retained and remodeled, the piers were entirely removed, and replaced with less bulky Gothic ones, and the old aisle walls were completely taken down except for a low &quot;plinth&quot; left on the south side. More Norman fabric was retained in the transepts, especially in the east walls, and the old apsidal chapels were not replaced until the mid-15th century. The arches of the new nave arcade were exceptionally high in proportion to the clerestory. The new transepts, aisles, and nave were roofed with lierne vaults, enriched with bosses. Most of the work was done during the priorate of Thomas Chillenden (1391–1411): Chillenden also built a new quire screen at the east end of the nave, into which Eastry&#x27;s existing screen was incorporated. The Norman stone floor of the nave, however, survived until its replacement in 1786.

From 1396 the cloisters were repaired and remodelled by Yevele&#x27;s pupil Stephen Lote who added the lierne vaulting. It was during this period that the wagon-vaulting of the chapter house was created.

A shortage of money and the priority given to the rebuilding of the cloisters and chapterhouse meant that the rebuilding of the west towers was neglected. The south-west tower was not replaced until 1458, and the Norman north-west tower survived until 1834 when it was replaced by a replica of its Perpendicular companion.

In about 1430 the south transept apse was removed to make way for a chapel, founded by Lady Margaret Holland and dedicated to St Michael and All Angels. The north transept apse was replaced by a Lady Chapel, built-in 1448–1455.

The crossing tower was begun in 1433, although preparations had already been made during Chillenden&#x27;s priorate when the piers had been reinforced. Further strengthening was found necessary around the beginning of the 16th century when buttressing arches were added under the southern and western tower arches. The tower is often known as the &quot;Angel Steeple&quot;, after a gilded angel that once stood on one of its pinnacles.

=== The Modern period ===
==== The Reformation, Dissolution and Puritanism ====

The cathedral ceased to be an abbey during the dissolution of the monasteries when all religious houses were suppressed. Canterbury Cathedral, and the great monastery of Christ Church were surrendered to the Crown on 30 March 1539, after the occupants had made &quot;an inventory of the good, chattels, plate, precious ornaments, lead, and money belonging to the monks&quot; and &quot;all that could be moved&quot; was &quot;handed over to the master of the jewel-house&quot; of the Tower of London, after which &quot;the Prior and monks were then ejected. 
The Cathedral reverted to its previous status of &#x27;a college of secular canons&#x27;. According to the cathedral&#x27;s own website, it had been a Benedictine monastery since the 900s. The New Foundation came into being on 8 April 1541. The shrine to St Thomas Becket was destroyed on the orders of Henry VIII and the relics lost.

In around 1576, the crypt of the cathedral was granted to the Huguenot congregation of Canterbury to be used as their Church of the Crypt.

In 1642–1643, during the English Civil War, Puritan iconoclasts led by Edwin Sandys (Parliamentarian) caused significant damage during their &quot;cleansing&quot; of the cathedral. Included in that campaign was the destruction of the statue of Christ in the Christ Church Gate and the demolition of the wooden gates by a group led by Richard Culmer. The statue would not be replaced until 1990 but the gates were restored in 1660 and a great deal of other repair work started at that time; that would continue until 1704.

==== Furnishings ====
In 1688, the joiner Roger Davis, citizen of London, removed the 13th-century misericords and replaced them with two rows of his own work on each side of the quire. Some of Davis&#x27;s misericords have a distinctly medieval flavour and he may have copied some of the original designs. When Sir George Gilbert Scott carried out renovations in the 19th century, he replaced the front row of Davis&#x27; misericords, with new ones of his own design, which seem to include many copies of those at Gloucester Cathedral, Worcester Cathedral and New College, Oxford.

==== Statues on the West Front ====

Most of the statues that currently adorn the west front of the cathedral were installed in the 1860s when the South Porch was being renovated. At that time, the niches were vacant and the Dean of the cathedral thought that the appearance of the cathedral would be improved if they were filled. The Victorian sculptor Theodore Pfyffers was commissioned to create the statues and most of them were installed by the end of the 1860s. There are currently 53 statues representing various figures who have been influential in the life of the cathedral and the English church such as clergy, members of the royal family, saints, and theologians. Archbishops of Canterbury from Augustine of Canterbury and Lanfranc, to Thomas Cranmer and William Laud are represented. Kings and Queens from Æthelberht and Bertha of Kent, to Victoria and Elizabeth II are included.

==== 18th century to the present ====
The original towers of Christ Church Gate were removed in 1803 and were replaced in 1937. The statue of Christ was replaced in 1990 with a bronze sculpture of Christ by Klaus Ringwald.

The original Norman northwest tower, which had a lead spire until 1705, was demolished in 1834 owing to structural concerns. It was replaced with a Perpendicular-style twin of the southwest tower (designed by Thomas Mapilton), now known as the Arundel Tower, providing a more symmetrical appearance for the cathedral. This was the last major structural alteration to the cathedral to be made.

In 1866, there were six residentiary canonries, of which one was annexed to the Archdeaconry of Canterbury and another to that of Maidstone. In September 1872, a large portion of the Trinity Chapel roof was completely destroyed by fire. There was no significant damage to the stonework or interior and the damage was quickly repaired.
During the bombing raids of the Second World War its library was destroyed, but the cathedral did not sustain extensive bomb damage; the local Fire Wardens doused any flames on the wooden roof.

In 1986, a new Martyrdom Altar was installed in the northwest transept, on the spot where Thomas Becket was slain, the first new altar in the cathedral for 448 years. Mounted on the wall above it, there is a metal sculpture by Truro sculptor Giles Blomfield depicting a cross flanked by two bloodstained swords which, together with the shadows they cast, represent the four knights who killed Becket. A stone plaque also commemorates Pope John Paul II&#x27;s visit to the United Kingdom in 1982. Antony Gormley&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Transport&quot; was unveiled in the crypt in 2011. It is made from iron nails from the roof of the south-east transept.

In 2015, Sarah Mullally and Rachel Treweek became the first women to be ordained as bishops in the cathedral, as Bishop of Crediton and Bishop of Gloucester respectively. In 2022, it was announced that David Monteith, who is gay and in a civil partnership, would serve as dean of the cathedral. His appointment was criticised by the Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches (GSFA) and the Global Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans (GAFCON); the Church of England defended the decision stating that Monteith lives chastely with his partner. In 2024, the cathedral began offering blessings for same-sex couples &quot;already in civil partnerships or civil marriages&quot; or in &quot;covenanted friendship&quot; during ordinary or regular church services in accordance with &quot;Prayers of Love and Faith.&quot;

The cathedral is Regimental Church of the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment and a graduation venue for the University of Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University.

== Conservation ==
Much of the stonework at Canterbury Cathedral is damaged and crumbling, the roofs are leaking and much of the stained glass is badly corroded. The last quinquennial structural review revealed that a combination of centuries of weathering, pollution and constant use had taken its toll on the ancient building and some serious problems were in need of urgent action.

The single biggest challenge is the roof. The cathedral is covered by a huge expanse of lead and whilst the majority of the wooden framework remains sound, much of the lead itself needs replacing. In addition, a large amount of concrete encasing the bottom of the roof beams needs to be removed and replaced with traditional wooden footers.

Conservation of the external masonry, particularly on the northern side of the building, is equally important. The cathedral is in part built of Caen stone. Detailed archaeological studies are undertaken to identify exactly which stones need to be replaced or repaired. In addition, specialist cleaning techniques are used to remove accumulated chemical deposits which are very damaging to the building. As regards the interior, priorities include decoration of the vaults of the Trinity Chapel, conservation work in several other chapels, and major improvements to the Treasury building, which contains, amongst other things, the choir practice rooms.

The earliest coloured glass windows in the cathedral date from the late 12th century, whilst others are as new as the four Ervin Bossányi windows in the south-east transept (1957). Many have already been conserved and protected by the team of stained glass conservators led by Leonie Seliger. However, much conservation work remains to be done, notably on the Oculus window in the south-east transept – a late 12th-century round window.

During the autumn of 2008, a major restoration of the lead roof over the transept was completed at a cost of approximately £500,000. In 2018, the lead roof of the nave was replaced. The extensive restoration of the cathedral that was underway in mid-2018 was part of a 2016–2021 schedule that also includes improved landscaping and accessibility, new visitor facilities and a general external restoration. The so-called Canterbury Journey project was expected to cost nearly £25 million; the funding included a £13.8 million Heritage Lottery grant, £10.9 million from the Canterbury Cathedral Trust and £250,000 from the Friends of the Cathedral.

==Historic designations==
The cathedral and its precincts comprise a large number of listed buildings. The majority are listed at Grade I, the highest grade, with a much smaller number listed at Grade II*.

===Grade I===
The cathedral itself is listed at Grade I. Other Grade I listed buildings include: the Chapter House, the main gate into the cathedral precincts,
the cloister, a passageway known as the Dark Entry, the Lavatory Tower, the Library, Meister Omers, at No.16 The Precincts, originally a guest house for visitors, the Norman Staircase, the

== Foundation ==

The Foundation is the authorised staffing establishment of the cathedral, few of whom are clergy. The head of the cathedral is the Dean, currently David Monteith, who is assisted by a chapter of 30 canons, four of whom are residentiary, the others being honorary appointments of senior clergy in the diocese. There are also a number of lay canons who all together form the greater chapter which has the legal responsibility both for the cathedral itself and also for the formal election of an archbishop when there is a vacancy-in-see. By English law and custom, they may only elect the person who has been nominated by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister. The Foundation also includes the choristers, lay clerks, organists, King&#x27;s Scholars, the Six Preachers and a range of other officers; some of these posts are moribund, such as that of the cathedral barber. The cathedral has a workforce of over 300 (many of whom work part-time), and approximately 800 volunteers.

=== Dean and Chapter ===
As of 1 August 2022:
*Dean – David Monteith (since 17 December 2022)
*Archdeacon of Canterbury and Canon Residentiary – William Adam (Archdeacon and Canon since 18 July 2022 collation)
*Canon Librarian – Tim Naish (since 22 April 2018)
*Canon Missioner – Emma Pennington (since 16 March 2019)
*Canon Treasurer (Diocesan Canon) – Andrew Dodd (since 27 September 2020 installation)

The Cathedral uses &quot;Vice Dean&quot; not of one particular appointee, but to refer to the Canon in Residence for each month.

Minor canons:
*Precentor – Wendy Dalrymple (since 2023)

=== Finance ===
Canterbury Cathedral receives no government or state funding and only occasional grants from English Heritage. It is not funded by the Church of England. The Church Commissioners pay the salary of the dean and two of the residentiary canons only. The cathedral is therefore largely self-funded.

It costs around £20,000 per day to maintain the cathedral. (2023) In order to meet these costs the cathedral has to rely on income from entry fees paid by visitors and a number of commercial operations such as property rental, the Cathedral Shop, as well as the Cathedral Lodge Hotel and Conference Centre.

==== Appeal ====
The &quot;Save Canterbury Cathedral&quot; appeal was launched in October 2006 to protect and enhance the cathedral&#x27;s future as a centre of worship, heritage and culture. The aim was to raise £50 million; by the end of 2010 the appeal had raised £11.5 million, and as at May 2014 over £20 million had been raised.

The core part of the fundraising programme is focused on the cathedral&#x27;s fabric. The major conservation-restoration projects already identified will cost £30 million. Fabric conservation is the most urgent element of the campaign. The appeal – the third of its kind following major fundraising drives at Canterbury in the 1950s and 1970s – was launched to fund these projects. Fundraising for the appeal will take place over a number of years both nationally and internationally, stressing the cathedral&#x27;s role as the mother church of the worldwide Anglican Communion and as a World Heritage Site. An integrated conservation programme that addresses the priority areas has been drawn up by the cathedral&#x27;s Surveyor to the Fabric, John Burton.

Major repair and conservation projects to be funded by the appeal include roofs of the nave, aisles, and North West and South East Transepts; stone carvings, pinnacles and stone facings of the central Bell Harry Tower; work on the North side of the Corona Chapel; conservation of the Christ Church Gate entry to the Precincts; conservation of stained glass and surrounding stonework throughout the cathedral; and preservation of the collection of historic books and manuscripts.

In addition, there are plans to refurbish the cathedral pipe organ and renovations to the Choir House have already been completed, providing better facilities for choristers. Improvements are planned to the fabric of the library buildings and to the cathedral&#x27;s audio-visual and lighting systems which will significantly benefit visitors including the disabled, visually impaired and hard of hearing. The appeal also aims to develop the outmoded workshop area and stained glass studio, in order to ensure the survival of Canterbury as a centre of excellence for vital craft skills and to promote a sustainable maintenance base for work on the cathedral which can be viewed by the public.

The fundraising group is the Canterbury Cathedral Trust, an independent, registered charity (1112590) seeking funds to provide conservation, craftsmanship, music and education. Since mid-2017, the Chief Executive has been Sarah Frankland. The Trust was able to obtain the £24.7m needed for The Canterbury Journey multi-year restoration programme which was planned for completion in 2021. In 2016–17 the Trust received £3.66m in donations and an additional £1.61m had been pledged for future projects. The next plan was to raise funds to restore and improve the Quire organ by 2020. In 2017, the cathedral was planning to have the new Welcome Centre open in 2019, with exhibition spaces and viewing gallery.

=== Police service ===
The cathedral has its own police service, known as the Canterbury Cathedral Close Constables. They are attested Constables, with powers of arrest, who police and protect the Cathedral and Close. They also work with Kent Police.

== Music ==
Polyphonic music written for the monks of Christ Church Priory, now Canterbury Cathedral, survives from the 13th century. The cathedral may have had an organ as early as the 12th century, though the names of organists are only recorded from the early 15th century.
One of the earliest named composers associated with Canterbury Cathedral was Leonel Power, who was appointed master of the new Lady Chapel choir formed in 1438.

The Reformation brought a period of decline in the cathedral&#x27;s music which was revived under Dean Thomas Neville in the early 17th century. Neville introduced instrumentalists into the cathedral&#x27;s music who played cornett and sackbut, probably members of the city&#x27;s band of waits. The cathedral acquired sets of recorders, lutes and viols for the use of the choir boys and lay-clerks.

=== Organ ===

The organ at Canterbury is of four manuals and is in both south and the north quire aisles, as well as a nave division. It was built in 1886 by Henry Willis and subsequently rebuilt by the same firm in the mid-20th century. It was rebuilt by N. P. Mander in 1978 and reduced to three manuals at about that time. David Flood, Organist and Master of the Choristers for over 40 years, oversaw the redesign, specification and total expansion and rebuilding project of the Cathedral Organ in 2018–2020 The organ has now been fully restored and greatly enlarged, including reinstating the fourth manual, by Harrison and Harrison with work finishing in February 2020.

=== Organists ===
Organists and assistant organists at Canterbury Cathedral have included composers William Shelbye, Clement Charlton Palmer, Gerald Hocken Knight and Philip Moore and musical directors Allan Wicks and Stephen Darlington. Following 42 years as both Assistant Organist and Organist and Master of the Choristers, David Flood retired on 29 December 2020. Following 10 years as assistant organist and latterly director of the Girls&#x27; Choir and a period as acting director of music, David Newsholme was appointed Director of Music in July 2021. The Assistant Organist is Jamie Rogers and he was appointed in December 2021.

=== Choirs ===
There has been a choral tradition at Canterbury Cathedral for 1400 years. The cathedral choir consists of up to 25 boy choristers and 12 lay clerks and choral scholars. The boys are aged eight to thirteen. They receive scholarships and attend St Edmund&#x27;s School, Canterbury. There are seven choral services a week with Choral Evensong at 5:30 pm Monday through Friday, with the boys alone on Thursday and men on Wednesday. On Saturday and Sunday, there is evensong at 3:15 pm or 5:30pm and Eucharist on Sunday at 11 am. There are numerous extra services, especially at Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost.

The Girls&#x27; Choir of Canterbury Cathedral was founded in 2014 and their first performance at Evensong, in January, was attended by more than 600 people and widely covered by the international press. They gave their first concert in December of that year. They now share their duties equally with the boys of the choir and sometimes work together. The girls are aged 12 to 18. They attend local schools in Canterbury and some further afield.

In February 2023 it was announced that the entire framework for the child choristers at Canterbury Cathedral would be changing and that they would no longer board or attend St Edmund&#x27;s School, causing local and international comment. The Equality and Inclusion Plan set up by the new Dean was at the heart of this.

== Bells ==
The cathedral has a total of 21 bells in three of its five towers:

The South West Tower (Oxford Tower) contains the cathedral&#x27;s main ring of bells, hung for change ringing in the English style. There are fourteen bells – a ring of twelve with two semitones, which allow for ringing on ten, eight or six bells while still remaining in tune. All of the bells were cast in 1981 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry from seven bells of the old peal of twelve with new metal added and rehung in a new frame. The length (draught) of the ropes was increased by lowering the floor of the ringing chamber to the level of the south aisle vault at the same time, also allowing for the new bells to be set lower in the belfry than the old, with the intention of reducing stress on the Medieval structure. The heaviest bell (tenor) of this ring weighs . The ringers practise on Thursday at 7:15 pm.

The North West Tower (Arundel Tower) contains the cathedral&#x27;s clock chime. The five-quarter chimes were taken from the old peal of twelve in the Oxford Tower (where the clock was originally), and hung from beams in the Arundel Tower. The chimes are struck on the eighth Gregorian tone, which is also used at Merton College, Oxford. The hour is struck on Great Dunstan, the largest bell in Kent at , which is also swung on Sunday mornings for Matins.

In 1316 Prior Henry of Eastry gave a large bell dedicated to Saint Thomas, which weighed . Later, in 1343, Prior Hathbrand gave bells dedicated to Jesus and St Dunstan. At this time the bells in campanile were rehung and their names recorded as &quot;Jesus&quot;, &quot;Dunstan&quot;, &quot;Mary&quot;, &quot;Crundale&quot;, &quot;Elphy&quot; (Ælfheah) and &quot;Thomas&quot;. In the 1382 Dover Straits earthquake the campanile fell, destroying the first three named bells. Following its reconstruction, the other three bells were rehung, together with two others, of whose casting no record remains.

The oldest bell in the cathedral is Bell Harry (approximately ), which hangs in a cage on the top of the central tower to which the bell lends its name. This bell was cast by Joseph Hatch in 1635, and is struck at 8 am and 9 pm every day to announce the opening and closing of the cathedral, and also occasionally for services as a Sanctus bell.

The cathedral also has custody of the bell of HMS &quot;Canterbury&quot;, a World War I-era light cruiser, hung near the Buffs Chapel in the southwest transept.

== Library ==
The cathedral library has a collection of about 30,000 books and pamphlets printed before the 20th century and about 20,000 later books and serials. Many of the earlier books were acquired as part of donated collections. It is rich in church history, older theology, British history (including local history), travel, science and medicine, and the anti-slavery movement. The library&#x27;s holdings are included in the online catalogue of the library of the University of Kent.

In July 2018, the cathedral purchased at auction a medieval Trussel Bible for £100,000. This Bible, subsequently renamed the &quot;Lyghfield Bible&quot;, after the monk William Lighfyld, had previously been at Canterbury, and had been removed following the dissolution of the monasteries.

<doc id="73008" wikidata="Q478358" url="?curid=73008" title="International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda">
<text>The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR; ; ) was an international court established in November 1994 by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 955 in order to adjudicate people charged for the Rwandan genocide and other serious violations of international law in Rwanda, or by Rwandan citizens in nearby states, between 1 January and 31 December 1994. The court eventually convicted 61 individuals and acquitted 14.

In 1995, it became located in Arusha, Tanzania, under Resolution 977. From 2006, Arusha also became the location of the African Court on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights. In 1998 the operation of the tribunal was expanded in Resolution 1165. Through several resolutions, the Security Council called on the tribunal to complete its investigations by end of 2004, complete all trial activities by end of 2008, and complete all work in 2012. The tribunal had jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity, and violations of Common Article Three and Additional Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions (which deals with internal conflicts).

The first trial, of Jean-Paul Akayesu, began in 1997. Jean Kambanda, interim Prime Minister, pleaded guilty. According to the ICTR&#x27;s Completion Strategy, in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1503, all first-instance cases were to have completed trial by the end of 2008 (this date was later extended to the end of 2009) and all work was to be completed by 2010. As of 2009, the tribunal had finished 50 trials and convicted 29 accused persons, and another 11 trials were in progress and 14 individuals were awaiting trial in detention; but the prosecutor intended to transfer 5 to national jurisdiction for trial. 13 others were still at large, some suspected to be dead. The United Nations Security Council called upon the tribunal to finish its work by 31 December 2014 to prepare for its closure and transfer of its responsibilities to the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT or Mechanism) which had begun functioning for the ICTR branch on 1 July 2012. The Tribunal was officially closed on 31 December 2016.

The tribunal&#x27;s failure to prosecute war crimes committed by the Rwandan Patriotic Front or try RPF leader Paul Kagame was widely criticized, to the point of being characterized as &quot;victor&#x27;s justice&quot;.

==The Rwandan genocide==
The Rwandan genocide refers to the mass slaughter of more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu by government-directed gangs of Hutu extremist soldiers and police in Rwanda. The duration of the 1994 genocide is usually described as 100 days, beginning on April 6 and ending in mid-July.

The tension between the majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi had developed over time but was particularly emphasized late in the nineteenth century and early in the twentieth century as a result of German and Belgian colonialism over Rwanda. The ethnic categorization of the two was an imposed and an arbitrary construct based more on physical characteristics than ethnic background. However, the social differences between the Hutu and the Tutsi have traditionally allowed the Tutsi, with a strong pastoralist tradition, to gain social, economic, and political ascendancy over the Hutu, who were primarily agriculturalists. The distinction under colonial powers allowed Tutsis to establish ruling power until a Hutu revolution in 1959 abolished the Tutsi monarchy by 1961.

The hostility between the two groups continued, as &quot;additional rounds of ethnic tension and violence flared periodically and led to mass killings of Tutsi in Rwanda, such as in 1963, 1967, and 1973&quot;. The establishment of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and its invasion from Uganda furthered ethnic hatred. A ceasefire in these hostilities led to negotiations between the government and the RPF in 1992.

On April 6, 1994, a plane carrying then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, and Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi was shot down, killing everyone on board. The Hutu held the RPF accountable and immediately began the genocide, targeted at both Tutsis and Hutu moderates.

Most of the killing during the Rwandan genocide was carried out by the radical Hutu groups known as the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi. Radio broadcasts also were an integral part of the genocide, which further fueled the genocide by encouraging Hutu civilians to kill their Tutsi neighbours, labeled as &quot;cockroaches&quot; in need of extermination. Despite its colossal scale, particularly within such a short period of time, the genocide was carried out almost entirely by hand, usually with the utilization of machetes and clubs. Various atrocities committed include the rape of thousands of Tutsi women, as well as the dismemberment and disfigurement of victims. Frequently the killers were people the victims knew personally—neighbors, workmates, former friends, sometimes even relatives through marriage. At least 500,000 Tutsis were killed, and approximately 2 million refugees (mostly Hutus) left for refugee camps of neighboring Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and former Zaire.

==Establishment of the ICTR==
The United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda is regarded as a major failure. The international response to the Rwandan genocide was poor. For weeks, the major power nations denied that a genocide was taking place in Rwanda. The United States refused to call the incident &quot;genocide&quot; because using the term would make an obligation for the United States to send troops, which it was reluctant to do after several of its soldiers were killed during a humanitarian mission in Somalia the previous year. Finally in July 1994, after the genocide was over, the UN Security Council called for an investigation of the events, and acted to establish an international criminal tribunal to prosecute those individuals most responsible for the genocide. Adopting Resolution 955, the Security Council created the ICTR on 8 November 1994 and the ICTR would also deal with other crimes against international humanitarian law committed on the territory of Rwanda and neighboring states between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1994.

== ICTR structure ==

The tribunal consisted of 16 judges in four &quot;chambers&quot; – three to hear trials, and one to hear appeals. In addition, there were 9 &quot;ad litem&quot; judges, making 25 in all. All 9 &quot;ad litem&quot; judges were assigned to Chambers II and III. There was an additional pool of 9 further &quot;ad literim&quot; judges who would be called on in the case of a judge being absent.

The column denoted by # indicates the order of precedence.

=== Trial Chamber I ===
=== Trial Chamber II ===
=== Trial Chamber III ===
=== Appeals Chamber ===
===Office of the Prosecutor===

The Office of the Prosecutor was divided into various units at the height of its activity, including the Investigations Division and the Prosecution Division:
* The Prosecution Division was responsible for prosecuting all cases before the Tribunal. Headed by a Chief of Prosecutions.
* The Investigations Division was responsible for collecting evidence implicating individuals in crimes committed in Rwanda in 1994. Headed by a Chief of Investigations.

====Prosecutors====

* Richard Goldstone, late 1994 to 30 September 1996 (by virtue of Resolution 936)
* Louise Arbour, 1 October 1996 to 15 September 1999 (Resolution 1047)
* Carla Del Ponte, 15 September 1999 to 14 September 2003 (Resolution 1259)
* Hassan Bubacar Jallow, 15 September 2003 to 31 December 2015 (Resolution 1505)

===The Registry===
The Registry was responsible for the overall administration and management of the ICTR. It also performed other legal functions assigned to it by the Tribunal&#x27;s Rules of Procedure and Evidence, and was the Tribunal&#x27;s channel of communication.

The Registry was headed by the Registrar, who was the Representative of the UN Secretary-General. Bongani Christopher Majola of South Africa was Registrar. after January 2013.

==The Case of Jean-Paul Akayesu==

After an intense and precisely targeted campaign of a number of international non-governmental organizations, which aimed at raising awareness of gendered violence at the ICTR, the trial of Jean-Paul Akayesu established the legal precedent that genocidal rape falls within the act of genocide. &quot;...the [Trial] Chamber finds that in most cases, the rapes of Tutsi women in Taba, were accompanied with the intent to kill those women. ... In this respect, it appears clearly to the chamber that the acts of rape and sexual violence, as other acts of serious bodily and mental harm committed against the Tutsi, reflected the determination to make Tutsi women suffer and to mutilate them even before killing them, the intent being to destroy the Tutsi group while inflicting acute suffering on its members in the process.&quot; Presiding judge Navanethem Pillay said in a statement after the verdict: &quot;From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as spoils of war. Now it will be considered a war crime. We want to send out a strong message that rape is no longer a trophy of war.&quot;

== Media Case==

The trial against &quot;hate media&quot; began on 23 October 2000. It was charged with the prosecution of the media which encouraged the genocide of 1994.

On 19 August 2003, at the tribunal in Arusha, life sentences were requested for Ferdinand Nahimana, and Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, persons in charge for the Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, as well as Hassan Ngeze, director and editor of the &quot;Kangura&quot; newspaper. They were charged with genocide, incitement to genocide, and crimes against humanity, before and during the period of the genocides of 1994. On 3 December 2003, the court found all three defendants guilty and sentenced Nahimana and Ngeze to life imprisonment and Barayagwiza to imprisonment for 35 years. On 28 November 2007, the Appeals Chamber partially allowed appeals against conviction from all three men, reducing their sentences to 30 years&#x27; imprisonment for Nahimana, 32 years&#x27; imprisonment for Barayagwiza and 35 years&#x27; imprisonment for Ngeze.

==Related legal activities==
French investigating magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguière was also pursuing a case against the current President, Paul Kagame, and other members of his administration, for the assassination of his predecessor. This case was under the regular jurisdiction of the French courts because French citizens were also killed in the plane crash. The majority of genocide cases were handled by the so-called gacaca courts, a modernized customary dispute resolution mechanism.

== Indictees ==
The ICTR indicted a total of 96 individuals. The proceedings against one individual are suspended before the IRMCT. The ICTR (or the IRMCT as its successor) convicted 61 individuals: 25 of whom are currently serving sentences, 22 of whom have completed their sentences, and 14 of whom died while serving their sentences. The Tribunal acquitted 14 individuals and transferred the cases against 10 individuals to national jurisdictions. Proceedings against nine individuals ended before a final judgment was rendered: two of whom had their charges dismissed by the Tribunal, two of whom had their charges withdrawn by the Prosecutor, and five of whom died.

<text>Saxo Grammaticus (), also known as Saxo cognomine Longus, was a Danish historian, theologian and author. He is thought to have been a clerk or secretary to Absalon, Archbishop of Lund, the main advisor to Valdemar I of Denmark. He is the author of the , the first full history of Denmark, from which the legend of Amleth would come to inspire the story of &quot;Hamlet&quot; by Shakespeare.

== Life ==
The &quot;Jutland Chronicle&quot; gives evidence that Saxo was born in Zealand. It is unlikely he was born before 1150 and it is supposed that his death could have occurred around 1220. His name Saxo was a common name in medieval Denmark. The name &quot;Grammaticus&quot; (&quot;the learned&quot;) was first given to him in the &quot;Jutland Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Sjælland Chronicle&quot; makes reference to Saxo &quot;cognomine Longus&quot; (&quot;with the byname &#x27;the tall).

He lived in a period of warfare and Danish expansion, led by Archbishop Absalon and the Valdemars. The Danes were also being threatened by the Wends who were making raids across the border and by sea. Valdemar I had also just won a civil war and later Valdemar II led an expedition across the Elbe to invade Holstein.

Sven Aggesen, a Danish nobleman and author of a slightly earlier history of Denmark than Saxo&#x27;s, describes his contemporary, Saxo, as his &quot;contubernalis&quot;, meaning &quot;tent-comrade&quot;. This gives evidence that Saxo and Sven might have soldiered in the &quot;Hird&quot; or royal guard, since Sven used the word &quot;contubernium&quot; in reference to them. There is also a Saxo to be found on a list of clergy at Lund, where there was a Sven recorded as Archdeacon. Likewise there is Dean Saxo who died in 1190; however, the date does not match what is known about Saxo.

Both arguments, for a secular or religious Saxo, would confirm that he was well educated; as clergy, he would have received training in Latin and sons of great men were often sent to Paris. Saxo comes from a warrior family and writes that he is himself committed to being a soldier. He tells us that he follows &quot;the ancient right of hereditary service&quot;, and that his father and grandfather &quot;were recognized frequenters of your renowned sire&#x27;s (Valdemar I) war camp&quot;.

Saxo&#x27;s education and ability support the idea that he was educated outside Denmark. Some suggest the title &quot;Grammaticus&quot; refers not to his education but rather his elaborate Latin style. We know from his writing that he was in the retinue and received the patronage of Absalon, Archbishop of Lund, who was the foremost adviser to King Valdemar I. In his will Absalon forgives his clerk Saxo a small debt of two and a half marks of silver and tells him to return two borrowed books to the monastery of Sorø. The legacy of Saxo Grammaticus is the sixteen-book heroic history of the Danes called .

== Gesta Danorum ==
In the preface to the work, Saxo writes that his patron Absalon ( – 21 March 1201), Archbishop of Lund, had encouraged him to write a heroic history of the Danes. The history is thought to have been started about 1185, after Sven Aggesen wrote his history. The goal of was, as Saxo writes, &quot;to glorify our fatherland&quot;, which he accomplishes on the model of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Saxo also may have owed much to Plato and Cicero, as well as to more contemporary writers like Geoffrey of Monmouth.

Saxo&#x27;s history of the Danes was compiled from sources that are of questionable historical value but were to him the only ones extant. He drew on oral tales of the Icelanders, ancient volumes, letters carved on rocks and stone, and the statements of his patron Absalon concerning the history of which the Archbishop had been a part. Saxo&#x27;s work was not strictly a history or a simple record of old tales, but rather, as Friis-Jensen puts it, &quot;a product of Saxo&#x27;s own mind and times&quot;. Westergaard writes that Saxo combines the history and mythology of the heroic age of Denmark, and reworks it into his own story that exemplifies the past of the Danes.

The history is composed of sixteen books, and extends from the time of the founders of the Danish people, Dan I of Denmark and Angul, into about the year 1187. The first four books are concerned with the history of the Danes before Christ, the next four books with their history after Christ, and books 9–12 with Christian Denmark, and books 13–16 promote Lund and exploits before and during Saxo&#x27;s own lifetime. It is assumed that the last eight books were written first, as Saxo drew heavily on the work of Absalon (who died in 1201, before the work was completed) for evidence of the age of Saint Canute and Valdemar I.

The first eight volumes share a likeness with the works of Saxo&#x27;s contemporary Snorri Sturluson. They deal with mythical elements such as giants and the Scandinavian pantheon of gods. Saxo tells of Dan the first king of Denmark, who had a brother named Angul who gave his name to the Angles. He also tells the stories of various other Danish heroes, many of whom interact with the Scandinavian gods. Saxo&#x27;s &quot;heathen&quot; gods, however, are not always good characters. They are sometimes treacherous, such as in the story of Harald, legendary king of the Danes, who was taught the ways of warfare by Odin and then was betrayed and killed by the god, who then brought him to Valhalla.

Saxo&#x27;s world is seen to have had very warlike values. He glorifies the heroes that made their names in battle far more than those who made peace. His view of the period of peace under King Frode is very low and is only satisfied when King Knut brings back the ancestral customs. Saxo&#x27;s chronology of kings extends up to Saint Canute and his son Valdemar I. Saxo finished the history with the Preface, which he wrote last, in under the patronage of Anders Sunesen, who replaced Absalon as Archbishop of Lund. Saxo included in the preface warm appreciation of both Archbishops and of the reigning King Valdemar II.

== Historical contribution ==
Of particular interest for Shakespeare scholars is the story of Amleth, the first instance of the playwright&#x27;s Hamlet. Saxo based the story on an oral tale of a son taking revenge for his murdered father. Christiern Pedersen, a Canon of Lund, collaborated with Jodocus Badius Ascensius, a fellow enthusiast, to print the work of Saxo Grammaticus early in the sixteenth century. This was the first major step toward securing the historical significance of . Starting from that point, the knowledge of it began to spread within the academic community. Oliver Elton, who was the first to translate the first nine books of into English, wrote that Saxo was the first writer produced by Denmark.

Saxo&#x27;s skill as a Latinist was praised by Erasmus, who wondered how &quot;a Dane of that age got so great power of eloquence&quot;. Later R. W. Chambers would call Saxo&#x27;s writings &quot;difficult and bombastic, but always amusing Latin&quot;. There have been many attempts to understand the type of Latin language used by Saxo, and to juxtapose it in history, to provide more information on where he was educated. Some have considered his Latin to have more in common with legal than with ecclesiastical training, and his poetry is thought to have traces of parallelism.

Although Saxo is commonly viewed by modern Danes as their &quot;first national historian&quot;, two other coherent accounts of Danish history by Danish authors predate . They are (English: &quot;Roskilde Chronicle&quot;), a small work written in Latin, completed in , spanning from the introduction of Christianity in Denmark to the author&#x27;s own time. The next to be published was &quot;Brevis historia regum Dacie&quot;, written by Sven Aggesen (b. – death unknown), thought to have been finished in 1186 or 1187 (the last event described happened in 1185), covering the years 300–1185.

Saxo&#x27;s works were received enthusiastically by Renaissance era scholars, who were curious about the pre-Christian history and legends. Saxo&#x27;s portrayals of history have been seen to differ greatly from those of his contemporaries, especially Norwegian and Icelandic, including portrayals of various historical characters as either heroes or villains. There are also differences between Saxo&#x27;s work and that of the fellow Danish historian Sven Aggesen from the same era.

These differences have to do with Saxo&#x27;s elaboration and euhemerism in his descriptions of mainly Scandinavian history and mythology, Saxo&#x27;s account on the tale of Thyri, for instance, is considered to be far more fantastic than the same tale presented by Sven. Saxo&#x27;s work has been criticized for this reason. Kurt Johannesson&#x27;s studies expanded greatly on the comprehension of , deviating from the approach that focuses mostly on mythology, and allowing the development of a wider understanding of Saxo&#x27;s works.

Recently some scholars, such as Sigurd Kværndrup, inspired by Johannesson&#x27;s study of the four cardinal virtues in , have studied other elaborations and schemes in the writings of Saxo. Some of them have concluded that Saxo, instead of simply distorting allegedly true Nordic and Baltic traditions and/or beliefs, was creating something new, attuned to the approaching 13th century Danish race to strengthen institutions and engage in the Northern Crusades.

Importantly, Saxo Grammaticus appears to have changed his agenda after the death of his patron Absalon in 1202. What eventually came to be the first nine books of , were actually written after the death of Absalon, and they focus largely on mythology, for which Saxo has been criticized. The contrast to the seven books written during the lifetime of Absalon is &quot;&#x27;enormous,&#x27; leading the main core of scholars to divide the two parts into mythical (books I–IX) and historical (books X–XVI), the last of the historical books being based on Absalon&#x27;s memories. &quot;Therefore, we prefer to support the composition order of as X–XVI, followed by I–IX, and ending with the preface&quot;, says historian André Muceniecks.

<doc id="73010" wikidata="Q10922" url="?curid=73010" title="Hardcore punk">
<text>Hardcore punk (commonly abbreviated to hardcore or hXc) is a punk rock subgenre and subculture that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time. It was also inspired by Washington, D.C., and New York punk rock and early proto-punk. Hardcore punk generally eschews commercialism, the established music industry and &quot;anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock&quot; and often addresses social and political topics with &quot;confrontational, politically charged lyrics&quot;.

Hardcore sprouted underground scenes across the United States in the early 1980s, particularly in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Boston, and New York, as well as in Canada and the United Kingdom. Hardcore has spawned the straight edge movement and its associated sub-movements, hardline and youth crew. Hardcore was heavily involved in the rise of the independent record labels in the 1980s and with the DIY ethics in underground music scenes. It has also influenced various music genres that have experienced widespread commercial success, including grunge and thrash metal.

Although the music genre started in English-speaking Western countries, notable hardcore scenes have existed in Italy, Japan and Brazil.

==Characteristics==
Hardcore historian Steven Blush credits Minor Threat&#x27;s Ian MacKaye with starting a &quot;die-hard mindset that begat almost everything we now call Hardcore&quot;, which was virulently anti-music industry and anti-. An article in &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; argues that late 1970s/early 1980s-era hardcore is the true spirit of punk, because &quot;all the poseurs and fashionistas fucked off to the next trend of skinny pink ties with New Romantic haircuts, singing wimpy lyrics&quot; and the punk scene now consisted of people like Minor Threat, Bad Brains, Black Flag, and Circle Jerks, dedicated to the DIY ethics.
Other writers have also attributed hardcore to a reaction against artsy and mellower sub-genres that punk grew into, such as post-punk and new wave. Hardcore punk additionally broke with original punk rock song patterns and visuals, favoring lower-key aesthetics. According to Eli Enis of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, hardcore shows are known to be violent. In 2002, during an interview with Nardwuar, Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra was asked what he believed to be the first hardcore record, he remarked: &quot;Sound Of Imker &quot;Train of Doomsday&quot; single in the late &#x27;60s in Holland. The only true &#x27;60s hardcore record I know.&quot;

===Musical elements===
One definition of the genre is &quot;a form of exceptionally harsh punk rock&quot;. Hardcore has been called a faster, meaner genre of punk rock, that was a stern refutation against it, being more primal and immediate, with speed and aggression as the starting point.

In the vein of earlier punk rock, most hardcore punk bands have followed the traditional singer/guitar/bass/drum format. The song-writing has more emphasis on rhythm rather than melody. Blush writes &quot;The Sex Pistols were still rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll...like the craziest version of Chuck Berry. Hardcore was a radical departure from that. It wasn&#x27;t verse-chorus rock. It dispelled any notion of what songwriting is supposed to be. It&#x27;s its own form.&quot; According to AllMusic, the overall blueprint for hardcore was playing louder, harder and faster. Hardcore was a reaction to the &quot;cosmopolitan art-school&quot; style of new wave music. Hardcore &quot;eschew[ed] nuance, technique, [and] the avant-garde&quot;, and instead emphasized &quot;speed and rhythmic intensity&quot; using unpredictable song forms and abrupt tempo changes.

The impact of powerful volume is important in hardcore. &quot;Noisey&quot; magazine describes one hardcore band as &quot;an all-encompassing, full-volume assault&quot; in which &quot;[e]very instrument sounds like it&#x27;s competing for the most power and highest volume&quot;. Scott Wilson states that the hardcore of the Bad Brains emphasized two elements: &quot;off-the-charts&quot; loudness which reached a level of threatening, powerful &quot;uncompromising noise&quot; and rhythm, in place of the typically focused-on elements in mainstream rock music, harmony and pitch (i.e., melody).

Hardcore vocalists often shout, scream or chant along with the music, using &quot;vocal intensity&quot; and an abrasive tone. The shouting of hardcore vocalists is often accompanied by audience members who are singing along, making the hardcore vocalist like the &quot;leader of a mob&quot; commonly known as &quot;gang vocals&quot;. Steven Blush describes one early Minor Threat show where the crowd was singing the lyrics so loud they could be heard over the PA system. Hardcore vocal lines are often based on minor scales and songs may include shouted background vocals from the other band members. Hardcore lyrics expressed the &quot;frustration and political disillusionment&quot; of youth who were against 1980s-era affluence, consumerism, greed, Reagan politics and authority. The polarizing sociopolitical messages in hardcore lyrics (and outrageous on-stage behaviour) meant that the genre garnered no mainstream popularity.

In hardcore, guitarists frequently play fast power chords with a heavily distorted and amplified tone, creating what has been called a &quot;buzzsaw&quot; sound. Guitar parts can sometimes be complex, technically versatile, and rhythmically challenging. Guitar melody lines usually use the same minor scales used by vocalists (although some solos use pentatonic scales). Hardcore guitarists sometimes play solos, octave leads and grooves, as well as tapping into the various feedback and harmonic noises available to them. There are generally fewer guitar solos in hardcore than in mainstream rock, because solos were viewed as representing the &quot;excess and superficiality&quot; of mainstream commercial rock.

Hardcore bassists use varied rhythms in their basslines, ranging from longer held notes (whole notes and half notes) to quarter notes, to rapid eighth note or sixteenth note runs. To play rapid bass lines that would be hard to play with the fingers, some bassists use a pick. Some bassists play fuzz bass by overdriving their bass tone.

Hardcore drumming, typically played fast and aggressively, has been called the &quot;engine&quot; and most essential element of the genre&#x27;s aggressive sound of &quot;unrelenting anger&quot;. Two other key elements for hardcore drummers are playing &quot;tight&quot; with the other musicians, especially the bassist (this does not mean metronomic time; indeed, coordinated tempo shifts are used in many important hardcore albums) and the drummer should have listened to a lot of hardcore, so that they can understand the &quot;raw emotions&quot; it expresses. Lucky Lehrer, the drummer and co-founder of the Circle Jerks in 1979, was an early developer of hardcore drumming; he has been called the &quot;Godfather of hardcore drumming&quot; and &quot;Flipside&quot; zine calls him the best punk drummer. According to Tobias Hurwitz, &quot;[h]ardcore drumming falls somewhere between the straight-ahead rock styles of old-school punk and the frantic, warp-speed bashing of thrash.&quot; Some hardcore punk drummers play fast D-beat one moment and then drop tempo into elaborate musical breakdowns in the next. Drummers typically play eighth notes on the cymbals, because at the tempos used in hardcore, it would be difficult to play a smaller subdivision of the beat.

===Dancing===

The early 1980s hardcore punk scene developed slam dancing (also called moshing), a style of dance in which participants push or slam into each other, and stage diving. Moshing works as a vehicle for expressing anger by &quot;represent[ing] a way of playing at violence or roughness that allowed participants to mark their difference from the banal niceties of middle-class culture&quot;. Moshing is in another way a &quot;parody of violence&quot;, that nevertheless leaves participants bruised and sometimes bleeding. The term &quot;mosh&quot; came into use in the early 1980s American hardcore scene in Washington, D.C. A performance by Fear on the 1981 Halloween episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; was cut short when moshers, including John Belushi and members of a few hardcore punk bands, invaded the stage, damaged studio equipment and used profanity.

===Fashion===
Many North American hardcore punk fans adopted a dressed-down style of T-shirts, jeans or work chinos, combat boots or sneakers, and crew cut-style haircuts. Women in the hardcore scene typically wore army pants, band T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts. The clothing style was a reflection of hardcore ideology, which included dissatisfaction with suburban America and the hypocrisy of American culture. It was essentially a deconstruction of American fashion staples—ripped jeans, holey T-shirts, torn stockings for women, and work boots.
The style of the 1980s hardcore scene contrasted with the more provocative fashion styles of late 1970s punk rockers. Siri C. Brockmeier writes that &quot;hardcore kids do not look like punks&quot;, since hardcore scene members wore basic clothing and short haircuts, in contrast to the &quot;embellished leather jackets and pants&quot; worn in the punk scene. Lauraine Leblanc, however, claims that the standard hardcore punk clothing and styles included torn jeans, leather jackets, spiked armbands, dog collars, mohawk hairstyles, DIY ornamentation of clothes with studs, painted band names, political statements, and patches. Tiffini A. Travis and Perry Hardy describe the look that was common in the San Francisco hardcore scene as consisting of biker-style leather jackets, chains, studded wristbands, multiple piercings, painted or tattooed statements (e.g., an anarchy symbol) and hairstyles ranging from military-style haircuts dyed black or blonde to mohawks and shaved heads.

Circle Jerks frontman Keith Morris wrote: &quot;[Punk] was basically based on English fashion. But we had nothing to do with that. Black Flag and the Circle Jerks were so far from that. We looked like the kid who worked at the gas station or sub. shop.&quot; Henry Rollins stated that for him, getting dressed up meant putting on a black shirt and some dark pants; taking an interest in fashion as being a distraction. Jimmy Gestapo from Murphy&#x27;s Law describes his own transition from dressing in a punk style (spiked hair and a bondage belt) to adopting a hardcore style (shaved head and boots) as being based on needing more functional clothing.

Skateboard culture, streetwear, and workwear are also major influences on clothing worn by participants in both past and present eras of hardcore.

===Politics===

Music writer Barney Hoskyns attributed hardcore being younger, faster and angrier than punk rock, to adolescents who were sick of their life in a &quot;bland Republican&quot; America. Hardcore punk lyrics often express antiestablishment, antimilitarist, antiauthoritarian, antiviolence, and pro-environmentalist sentiments, in addition to other typically left-wing, anarchist, or egalitarian political views. During the 1980s, the subculture often rejected what was perceived to be &quot;yuppie&quot; materialism and interventionist American foreign policy. Numerous hardcore punk bands have taken far-left political stances, such as anarchism or other varieties of socialism, and in the 1980s expressed opposition to political leaders such as then US president Ronald Reagan and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Reagan&#x27;s economic policies, sometimes dubbed Reaganomics, and social conservatism were common subjects for criticism by hardcore bands of the time. Jimmy Gestapo of Murphy&#x27;s Law, however, endorsed Reagan and even went as far to call then former president Jimmy Carter a &quot;pussy&quot; in a 1986 &quot;New York Magazine&quot; cover story. Shortly after Reagan&#x27;s death in 2004, the &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; radio show aired an episode composed of anti-Reagan songs by early hardcore punk bands.

Certain hardcore punk bands have conveyed messages sometimes deemed &quot;politically incorrect&quot; by placing offensive content in their lyrics and relying on stage antics to shock listeners and people in their audience. Boston band The F.U.&#x27;s generated controversy with their 1983 album, &quot;My America&quot;, whose lyrics contained what appeared to be conservative and patriotic views. Its messages were sometimes taken literally, when they were actually intended as a parody of conservative bands. Another act from Massachusetts, Vile, were known to insult women, minorities and gay people in their lyrics and would even go as far as putting their albums on the windshields of people&#x27;s cars. On the other hand, Tim Yohannan and the influential punk rock fanzine &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; were criticized by some punks for acting as the &quot;politically correct scene police&quot;, having what was perceived to be &quot;a very narrow definition of what fits into Punk&quot;, apparently being &quot;authoritarian and trying to dominate the scene&quot; with their views.

During the 2001–2009 United States presidency of George W. Bush, it was not uncommon for hardcore bands to express anti-Bush messages. During the 2004 United States presidential election, several hardcore punk artists and bands were involved with the anti-Bush political activist group PunkVoter. A minority of hardcore musicians have expressed right-wing views, such as the band Antiseen, whose guitarist Joe Young ran for public office as a North Carolina Libertarian. Former Misfits singer Michale Graves appeared on an episode of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, voicing support for George W. Bush, on behalf of the Conservative Punk website, and in 2023 testified on behalf of the far-right Proud Boys during their sedition trial for their role in attacking the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.

===Demographics===
While the early hardcore scene was mostly young white males, both onstage and in the audience, there are notable exceptions. Black musicians include Bad Brains, Fred &quot;Freak&quot; Smith of Beefeater, Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro, and Scream bassist Skeeter Thompson. Numerous Black and Latino members have been in the band Suicidal Tendencies, including Mike Muir, Rocky George, R.J. Herrera, Louiche Mayorga, Robert Trujillo, Thundercat, Dean Pleasants, Ra Díaz, Dave Lombardo, Eric Moore, Tim &quot;Rawbiz&quot; Williams, David Hidalgo Jr., and Ronald Bruner Jr. Other Latinos in early hardcore bands include Black Flag members Ron Reyes, Dez Cadena, Robo, and Anthony Martinez, Agnostic Front singer Roger Miret, his brother Madball singer Freddy Cricien, Adolescents guitarist Steve Soto, and Wasted Youth drummer Joey Castillo. Soto would later form the all-Latino punk band Manic Hispanic, which also featured Efrem Schulz from Death By Stereo. There are also notable women such as Crass singers Joy de Vivre and Eve Libertine, Black Flag bassist Kira Roessler, and Germs bassist Lorna Doom.

Several documentaries, including 2003&#x27;s &quot;Afro-Punk&quot; and 2016&#x27;s &quot;Los Punks&quot;, chronicle these subcultures within American punk and hardcore.

As of 2019, the genre is still overwhelmingly represented by white males. However, as sonic diversity has increased in the genre, so too has its fanbase. This has helped bring greater attention to inclusivity within the scene.
Bands like War On Women, Limp Wrist, Gouge Away, and G.L.O.S.S. have helped bring attention to subjects like women&#x27;s rights, transphobia, rape, mental health, queer rights, and misogyny.

===Record labels===
Record labels in hardcore are often DIY endeavors, run by musicians or participants within the community. Largely inspired by early labels like Dischord Records, Alternative Tentacles, Epitaph Records, SST Records, Revelation Records, and Touch &amp; Go Records, record labels are usually run on DIY ethic, collaboration, financial trust, and an emphasis on creative control. Labels within hardcore are seldom large, profit-making operations, but rather collaborative music partners with the intent to document and release music for the underground community.

Ian Mackaye, co-founder of Dischord Records claimed, &quot;We don&#x27;t use contracts, lawyers, any of those kinds of things. We are partners – they make the music, and we make the records. From the beginning of this label, people have said that the way we do things is unsustainable, unrealistic, idealistic, and we were just dreaming&quot;, he said. &quot;Well, the dream is now 35 years old, so they can go fuck themselves.&quot;

==Etymology==
Steven Blush states that the Vancouver-based band D.O.A.&#x27;s 1981 album, &quot;Hardcore &#x27;81&quot;, &quot;was where the genre got its name&quot;. This album also helped to make people aware of the term &quot;hardcore&quot;. Konstantin Butz states that while the origin of the expression &quot;hardcore&quot; &quot;cannot be ascribed to a specific place or time&quot;, the term is &quot;usually associated with the further evolution of California&#x27;s L.A. Punk Rock scene&quot;, which included young skateboarders. A September 1981 article by Tim Sommer shows the author applying the term to the &quot;15 or so&quot; punk bands gigging around the city at that time, which he considered a belated development relative to Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. Blush said that the term &quot;hardcore&quot; is also a reference to the sense of being &quot;fed up&quot; with the existing punk and new wave music. Blush also states that the term refers to &quot;an extreme: the absolute most Punk&quot;. Kelefa Sanneh states that the term &quot;hardcore&quot; referred to an attitude of &quot;turning inwards&quot; towards the scene and &quot;ignoring broader society&quot;, all with the goal of achieving a sense of &quot;shared purpose&quot; and being part of a community. Sanneh cites Agnostic Front&#x27;s band member selection approach as an example of hardcore&#x27;s emphasis on &quot;scene citizenship&quot;; prospective members of the band were chosen based on being part of the local hardcore scene and being regularly in the moshing pit at shows, rather than based on a musical audition.

==History==
===Late 1970s and early 1980s===
====United States====
=====Los Angeles=====
Michael Azerrad states that &quot;[by] 1979 the original punk scene [in Southern California] had almost completely died out&quot; and was replaced by punk music boiled down to its essence, but with faster tempos, which became known as &quot;hardcore&quot;. Steven Blush states that the first hardcore record to come out of the West Coast was &quot;Out of Vogue&quot; by the Santa Ana band Middle Class. The band pioneered a shouted, fast version of punk rock which would shape the hardcore sound that would soon emerge. In terms of impact upon the hardcore scene, Black Flag has been deemed the most influential group. Azerrad calls Black Flag the &quot;godfathers&quot; of hardcore punk and states that even &quot;...more than the flagship band of American hardcore&quot;, they were &quot;...required listening for anyone who was interested in underground music.&quot; Blush states that Black Flag were to hardcore what the Sex Pistols and Ramones were to punk. Formed in Hermosa Beach, California by guitarist and primary songwriter Greg Ginn, they played their first show in December 1977. Originally called Panic, they changed their name to Black Flag in 1978.

By 1979, Black Flag were joined by another South Bay hardcore band, the Minutemen, with whom they shared a practice space until both bands were evicted, as well as the Circle Jerks (which featured Black Flag&#x27;s original singer, Keith Morris). From Hollywood, two other bands playing hardcore punk, Fear and the Germs, were featured with Black Flag and the Circle Jerks in Penelope Spheeris&#x27; 1981 documentary &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot;. By the time the film was released, other hardcore bands from Los Angeles County were also making a name for themselves including Bad Religion, Descendents, Red Kross, Rhino 39, Suicidal Tendencies, Wasted Youth, Youth Brigade, and Youth Gone Mad. Neighboring Orange County had the Adolescents, Agent Orange, China White, Social Distortion, Shattered Faith, T.S.O.L., and Uniform Choice, while north of Los Angeles, around Oxnard, California, a hardcore scene known as &quot;nardcore&quot; developed with bands like Agression, Ill Repute, Dr. Know, and Rich Kids on LSD.

Whilst popular traditional punk bands such as the Clash, Ramones, and Sex Pistols were signed to major record labels, the hardcore punk bands were generally not. Black Flag, however, was briefly signed to MCA subsidiary Unicorn Records but were dropped because an executive considered their music to be &quot;anti-parent&quot;. Instead of trying to be courted by the major labels, hardcore bands started their own independent record labels and distributed their records themselves. Ginn started SST Records, which released Black Flag&#x27;s debut EP &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot; in 1979. SST went on to release a number of albums by other hardcore artists, and was described by Azerrad as &quot;easily the most influential and popular underground indie of the Eighties.&quot; SST was followed by a number of other successful artist-run labels—including BYO Records (started by Shawn and Mark Stern of Youth Brigade), Epitaph Records (started by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion), New Alliance Records (started by the Minutemen&#x27;s D. Boon and Mike Watt), as well as fan-run labels like Frontier Records and Slash Records.

Bands also funded and organized their own tours. Black Flag&#x27;s tours in 1980 and 1981 brought them in contact with developing hardcore scenes in many parts of North America, and blazed trails that were followed by other touring bands. Concerts in the early Los Angeles hardcore scene increasingly became sites of violent battles between police and concertgoers. Another source of violence in L.A. was tension created by what one writer calls the invasion of &quot;antagonistic suburban poseurs&quot; into hardcore venues. Violence at hardcore concerts was portrayed in episodes of the popular television shows &quot;CHiPs&quot; and &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;.

In the pre-Internet era, fanzines, commonly called zines, enabled hardcore scene members to learn about bands, clubs, and record labels. Zines typically included reviews of shows and records, interviews with bands, letters, ads for records and labels, and were DIY products, &quot;proudly amateur, usually handmade. A zine called &quot;We Got Power&quot; described the Los Angeles scene from 1981 to 1984, and it included show reviews and band interviews with groups including D.O.A., the Misfits, Black Flag, Suicidal Tendencies and the Circle Jerks.

=====San Francisco=====

Shortly after Black Flag debuted in Los Angeles, Dead Kennedys were formed in San Francisco. While the band&#x27;s early releases were played in a style closer to traditional punk rock, &quot;In God We Trust, Inc.&quot; (1981) marked a shift into hardcore. Similar to Black Flag and Youth Brigade, Dead Kennedys released their albums on their own label, which in DK&#x27;s case was Alternative Tentacles. The scene was helped in particular by the San Francisco club Mabuhay Gardens, whose promoter, Dirk Dirksen, became known as &quot;The Pope of Punk&quot;. Another important local institution was Tim Yohannan&#x27;s Maximumrocknroll, which started as a radio show in 1977, but branched out into a fanzine in 1982.

While not as large as the scene in Los Angeles, the hardcore scene of the early 1980s included a number of noteworthy bands originating from the San Francisco Bay Area, including Bl&#x27;ast, Crucifix, the Faction, Fang, Flipper, and Whipping Boy. Additionally, during this time, seminal Texas-based bands Dirty Rotten Imbeciles, the Dicks, MDC, Rhythm Pigs, and Verbal Abuse all relocated to San Francisco. Further out of the Bay Area, Sacramento&#x27;s Tales of Terror were cited by many, including Mark Arm, as a key inspiration for the grunge movement.

=====Washington, D.C.=====
The first hardcore punk band to form on the East Coast of the United States was Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Bad Brains. Initially formed in 1977 as a jazz fusion ensemble called Mind Power, and consisting of all African-American members, their early foray into hardcore featured some of the fastest tempos in rock music. The band released its debut single, &quot;Pay to Cum&quot;, in 1980, and were influential in establishing the D.C. hardcore scene. Hardcore historian Steven Blush calls the single the first East Coast hardcore record.

Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, influenced by Bad Brains, formed the band Teen Idles in 1979. The group broke up in 1980, and MacKaye and Nelson went on to form Minor Threat, a band which, apart from Bad Brains, has arguably had the biggest influence on the hardcore punk genre, and whose contributions to the music, ethics, aesthetic, and ethos are still widely acknowledged by hardcore bands of the 2020s. The band used faster rhythms and more aggressive, less melodic riffs than was common at the time. Minor Threat popularized the straight edge movement with its song &quot;Straight Edge&quot;, which spoke out against alcohol, drugs and promiscuity. MacKaye and Nelson ran their own record label, Dischord Records, which released records by D.C. hardcore bands, including the Faith, Iron Cross, Scream, State of Alert, Government Issue, Void, and D.C.&#x27;s Youth Brigade. The &quot;Flex Your Head&quot; compilation was a seminal document of the early 1980s D.C. hardcore scene. The record label was run out of the Dischord House, a Washington, D.C., punk house. Henry Rollins, who would come to prominence as the lead singer of the California-based Black Flag, as well as his own later Rollins Band, grew up in Washington, D.C., singing for the State of Alert, and was influenced by the music of Bad Brains and the bands of his childhood friend Ian MacKaye.

The tradition of holding all-ages shows at small DIY spaces, has roots in the early Washington, D.C., straight edge movement. It emerged from the idea that people of all ages should have access to music, regardless of if they&#x27;re old enough to drink alcohol.

=====Boston=====

Seminal Boston-area hardcore bands included the F.U.&#x27;s, the Freeze, Gang Green, Jerry&#x27;s Kids, Siege, DYS, Negative FX, and SS Decontrol. Members of the latter three bands were influenced by D.C.&#x27;s straight edge scene, and were part of &quot;the Boston Crew&quot;, a mostly straight edge group of friends known to physically fight people who used alcohol or drugs. Members of the Boston Crew would later go on to form the band Slapshot, and also included future Mighty Mighty Bosstones singer Dicky Barrett, who was then a member of the band Impact Unit, and drew the artwork for the DYS album &quot;Brotherhood&quot;.

In 1982, Modern Method Records released &quot;This Is Boston, Not L.A.&quot;, a compilation album of the Boston hardcore scene. In addition to Modern Method was Taang! Records, who released material by a number of the aforementioned Boston hardcore bands.

Further outside of Boston were Western Massachusetts bands Deep Wound (which featured future Dinosaur Jr. members J Mascis and Lou Barlow) and the Outpatients, both of whom would come to Boston to play shows. From nearby Manchester, New Hampshire, was G.G. Allin, a solo singer who, contrary to straight edge, used large amounts of drugs and alcohol, eventually dying of a heroin overdose. Allin&#x27;s stage show included defecating on stage and then throwing his feces at the audience.

=====New York=====

The New York City hardcore scene emerged in 1981 when Bad Brains moved to the city from Washington, D.C. Starting in 1981, there was an influx of new hardcore bands in the city including Agnostic Front, Beastie Boys, Cro-Mags, Cause for Alarm, the Mob, Murphy&#x27;s Law, Reagan Youth, and Warzone. A number of other bands associated with New York hardcore scene came from New Jersey, including the Misfits, Adrenalin OD and Hogan&#x27;s Heroes. Steven Blush calls the Misfits &quot;crucial to the rise of hardcore.&quot; New York hardcore had more emphasis on rhythm, in part due to the use of palm-muted guitar chords, an approach called the NY hardcore &quot;chug&quot;. The New York scene was known for its tough ethos, its &quot;thuggery&quot;, and club shows that were a chaotic &quot;proving ground&quot; or even a &quot;battleground&quot;.

In the early 1980s, the New York hardcore scene centered around squats and clubhouses. After these were closed down, the scene was emanating in a small after-hours bar, A7, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and later around the famous bar CBGB. For several years, CBGB held weekly hardcore matinées on Sundays, but they stopped in 1990 when violence led Kristal to ban hardcore shows at the club.

Early radio support in New York&#x27;s surrounding Tri-State area came from Pat Duncan, who had hosted live punk and hardcore bands weekly on WFMU since 1979. Bridgeport, Connecticut&#x27;s WPKN had a radio show featuring hardcore called Capital Radio, hosted by Brad Morrison, beginning in February 1979 and continuing weekly until late 1983. In New York City, Tim Sommer hosted &quot;Noise The Show&quot; on WNYU.

By 1984, the Ramones, one of the original New York punk bands, were experimenting with hardcore, with two songs, &quot;Wart Hog&quot; and &quot;Endless Vacation&quot; on their album &quot;Too Tough To Die&quot;.

=====Other American regions=====
Minneapolis hardcore consisted of bands such as Hüsker Dü and the Replacements, while Chicago had Articles of Faith, Big Black and Naked Raygun. The Detroit area was home to Crucifucks, Degenerates, the Meatmen, Negative Approach, Spite and Violent Apathy. From Ohio was Maumee&#x27;s Necros and Dayton&#x27;s Toxic Reasons. The zine &quot;Touch and Go&quot; covered this Midwest hardcore scene from 1979 to 1983.

JFA and Meat Puppets were both from Phoenix, Arizona; 7 Seconds were from Reno, Nevada; and Butthole Surfers, Big Boys, the Dicks, Dirty Rotten Imbeciles (D.R.I.), Really Red, Verbal Abuse and MDC were from Texas. Portland, Oregon, hardcore punk bands included Poison Idea and Final Warning, while north of there, Washington state included the Accüsed, Melvins, the Fartz, and 10 Minute Warning (the latter two included future Guns N&#x27; Roses member Duff McKagan). Other prominent hardcore bands from this time that came from areas without large scenes include Raleigh, North Carolina&#x27;s Corrosion of Conformity.

====Canada====

D.O.A. formed in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1978 and were one of the first bands to refer to its style as &quot;hardcore&quot;, with the release of their album &quot;Hardcore &#x27;81&quot;. Other early hardcore bands from British Columbia included Dayglo Abortions who formed in 1979, the Subhumans and the Skulls.

Nomeansno is a hardcore band originally from Victoria, British Columbia, and now located in Vancouver. SNFU formed in Edmonton in 1981 and also later relocated to Vancouver. Bunchofuckingoofs, from the Kensington Market neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, formed in November 1983 as a response to &quot;a local war with glue huffing Nazi skinheads&quot;. In Montreal, The Asexuals helped fertilize a scene that became a necessary tour stop for punk and hardcore bands headed to the Northeast.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, a fertile hardcore scene took root early on. Referred to under a number of names including &quot;U.K. Hardcore&quot;, &quot;UK 82&quot;, &quot;second wave punk&quot;, &quot;real punk&quot;, and &quot;No Future punk&quot;, it took the previous punk sound and added the incessant, heavy drumbeats and heavily distorted guitar sound of new wave of British heavy metal bands, especially Motörhead. Formed in 1977 in Stoke-on-Trent, Discharge played a large role in influencing other European hardcore bands. AllMusic calls the band&#x27;s sound a &quot;high-speed noise overload&quot; characterized by &quot;ferocious noise blasts.&quot; Their style of hardcore punk was coined as D-beat, a term referring to a distinctive drum beat that a number of 1980s imitators of Discharge are associated with.

Another UK band, the Varukers, were one of the original D-beat bands, Scottish band the Exploited were also influential, with the term &quot;UK 82&quot; (used to refer to UK hardcore in the early 1980s) being taken from one of their songs. They contrasted with early American hardcore bands by placing an emphasis on appearance. Frontman Walter &quot;Wattie&quot; Buchan had a giant red mohawk and the band continued to wear swastikas, an approach influenced by the wearing of this symbol by 1970s punks such as Sid Vicious. Because of this, the Exploited were labeled by others in the scene as &quot;cartoon punks&quot;. Other influential UK hardcore bands from this period included GBH, Anti-Establishment, Antisect, Broken Bones, Chaos UK, Conflict, Dogsflesh, English Dogs, and grindcore innovators Napalm Death.

====Other countries====
There was an Italian hardcore punk scene in the 1980s that included groups like Wretched, Raw Power, and Negazione. Sweden developed several influential hardcore bands, including Anti Cimex, Disfear, and Mob 47. Finland produced some influential hardcore bands, including Terveet Kädet, one of the first hardcore groups to emerge in the country. In Eastern Europe, notable hardcore bands included Hungary&#x27;s Galloping Coroners from 1975, Yugoslavia&#x27;s 1980s-era Niet from Ljubljana, and KBO!

A Japanese hardcore scene arose to protest the social and economic changes sweeping the country in the late 1970s and during the 1980s. The band SS is regarded as the first, forming in 1977. Bands such as the Stalin and GISM soon followed, both forming in 1980. Other notable Japanese hardcore bands include Balzac, Bomb Factory, Disclose (a D-beat band), Garlic Boys, Gauze, SOB, and the Star Club.

===Mid–to–late 1980s===

The mid-1980s were a time of transition for the hardcore scene, with a number of influential bands from earlier in the decade changing their sound or breaking up. For instance, Black Flag&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;My War&quot;, which coincided with the band members growing their hair long, were criticized for having &quot;gone heavy metal&quot;. The album&#x27;s second side was called a road map for sludge metal, as well as being influenced by doom metal bands. Black Flag&#x27;s eventual breakup in 1986 would coincide with the breakup of one of the other most influential hardcore bands, the Dead Kennedys.

By 1985, Boston bands SS Decontrol and DYS became metal bands, while the F.U.&#x27;s did the same, but changed their name to &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;. By the end of the year, both SSD and DYS had broken up. Other bands in the mid-&#x27;80s that went from being strictly hardcore to adding more metal riffs developed an even heavier sound, with Corrosion of Conformity, Cro-Mags and D.R.I., becoming known as crossover thrash bands. Bands like Cro-Mags looked to early Bad Brains songs such as &quot;Supertouch/Shitfit&quot; as inspiration for heavy breakdowns in hardcore punk music.

Bad Religion briefly broke up in 1984, after making the progressive rock album &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;. They returned to their roots on the 1985 &quot;Back to the Known&quot; EP, and then began their embrace of more melodic straightforward punk rock, starting with 1988&#x27;s &quot;Suffer&quot;. In 1986, Los Angeles&#x27;s Youth Brigade changed their name to The Brigade, and changed their sound to a style that &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; compared to mainstream bands like U2, R.E.M., and Big Country. They would break up the next year.

Bands such as Minutemen, Meat Puppets, Hüsker Dü and the Replacements, changed their style, becoming alternative rock. Around the same time, a social movement within the influential hardcore punk scene of Washington, D.C., occurred during the summer of 1985, dubbed Revolution Summer. The movement challenged the initial wave of hardcore music, the attitudes of fans and bands before them and also the image mainstream media portrayed of punks. The bands that spawned out of Revolution Summer often took a stand against violence, especially at shows in the form of slam dancing, as well as standing up against the sexism of the scene. Bands associated with the movement, such as Rites of Spring, Embrace, and Dag Nasty, are notable for having inspired the emotional hardcore and the original emo genre of the late 1980s and 1990s. The subsequent post-hardcore music genre, spearheaded by bands like Fugazi, is an evolution of hardcore which was created by participants of the Revolution Summer movement. T.S.O.L., who had already embraced goth rock, became a hard rock band with 1986&#x27;s &quot;Revenge&quot;, being compared to Poison and Faster Pussycat, and touring with Guns N&#x27; Roses. Red Kross&#x27;s second album, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Neurotica&quot;, was described as a blend of pop rock and art rock. The Beastie Boys gained fame by playing hip hop, and Bad Brains incorporated more reggae into their music, such as in their 1989 album &quot;Quickness&quot;.
Starting in 1986, the youth crew movement, became prominent in New York hardcore. Inspired by early hardcore bands such as 7 Seconds, Minor Threat and SSD, whose members were all straight edge and lyrical concerns included brotherhood and community values, youth crew was a reaction against the prevailing metal influence in hardcore at the time. The movement was based around Youth of Today, and fleshed out by bands signed to Youth of Today vocalist Ray Cappo&#x27;s record label Revelation Records, including Gorilla Biscuits, Bold and Side by Side. Following the release of their second album &quot;Break Down the Walls&quot; (1986), Youth of Today toured extensively across the United States and internationally, leading to youth crew ideals spreading and the formation of many subsequent bands. Youth crew took a particular hold in Southern California, where Chain of Strength became one of the style&#x27;s premier bands. As the style progressed, it too became influenced by the metal it originally opposed, seen in the musical style of Judge.

In the late 1980s, a more militant subculture of straight edge called hardline emerged through members of the anarcho punk scene and embraced veganism and radical environmentalism. Vegan Reich began as a crew of Animal Liberationists before becoming a band in order to promote their views in 1986; however, the group split from the wider U.S. anarchist movement in 1988 due to backlash from the community for their anti-carnist views. Vegan Reich vocalist Sean Muttaqi and Raid vocalist Steve Lovett created hardline philosophy and pioneered its musical movement alongside the English band Statement. Although hardline was overtly a political, anarchist school of thought rather than a hardcore subculture, hardline activists began to push their views specifically towards those in the mid to late 1980s straight edge scene due to the scene&#x27;s wider appeal. The movement quickly gained popularity in Memphis and Indianapolis, before then spreading to Salt Lake City and Syracuse.

===1990s===

The early 1990s saw the pioneering of metalcore. One of the earliest metalcore scenes was that of Cleveland, Ohio, fronted by Integrity and Ringworm. Integrity&#x27;s debut album &quot;Those Who Fear Tomorrow &quot; (1991) merged hardcore with apocalyptic lyrics and metal&#x27;s guitar solos and chugging riffs to create one of the primeval albums in the genre. &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine writer Elis Enis stated that the album &quot;influenced practically every breakdown that&#x27;s been recorded since&quot;. Philadelphia&#x27;s Starkweather and New Jersey&#x27;s Rorschach were also early bands in the genre. In 1993, Earth Crisis released &quot;Firestorm&quot;, one of the most influential songs in the genre. which ultimately popularised the militant vegan straight edge ethic and chug riffs. Soon after, the sound spread to Boston with Overcast and Converge and New York City with All Out War and Merauder.

During this era in mainstream music, punk rock became a success in 1994 with popular bands like Green Day, the Offspring, and Rancid. While typically playing pop punk, Green Day&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;Nimrod&quot; contained two songs (&quot;Platypus [I Hate You]&quot; and &quot;Take Back&quot;) that were described as hardcore; meanwhile, Rancid would record a hardcore album with 2000&#x27;s &quot;Rancid&quot;. The same year, punk became popular again in 1994, Sick of It All released the major label album &quot;Scratch the Surface&quot;. According to lead singer Lou Koller, people thought that they would go from a hardcore band to sounding like Green Day, so they intentionally made an album heavier than anything they&#x27;d done before. The album became a surprise success, with the single &quot;Step Down&quot; becoming a staple on MTV, thanks to a tongue-in-cheek music video featuring a roving reporter &quot;exposing&quot; the world of hardcore, and showing how to do various hardcore dance moves. The decade also saw a rise in pop-punk bands like New Found Glory and Saves the Day, which garnered attention from fans of hardcore due to band member connections to the contemporary hardcore scene.

As a reaction against the dominance of metal-influenced hardcore amongst straight edge bands, around 1996, a revival of the sound of the youth crew bands began. Bands including In My Eyes, Bane, Ten Yard Fight and Floorpunch, used the key aspects of late 1980s bands such as the gang vocals, high tempos and lyrical themes of straight edge, unity and vegetarianism. Additionally, at this time, Youth of Today&#x27;s Ray Cappo formed Better Than a Thousand with Ken Olden and Graham Land of early 1990s straight edge band Battery, creating a sound, too, harkening back to this era. Further bands meshed straight edge with additional causes, such as Christian hardcore bands Call to Preserve, the Red Baron, xLooking Forwardx, Jewish band Sons of Abraham,
queercore band Limp Wrist, right-wing anti-immigrant band One Life Crew, and anti-capitalism bands Manliftingbanner and Refused.

In the late 1990s, a number of movements that attempted to rebel against the hypermasculinity that hardcore had come to embrace. One of these was fashioncore, which originated from Orange County, California metalcore bands, particularly Eighteen Visions. The movement placed emphasis on the fashion style of the musicians and saw many in hardcore begin to wear skinny jeans, collared shirts and white belts and adopting dyed, straightened and swooping fringed hairstyles. Sass music began with this same intention, doing so by incorporating elements such as homoerotic lyrics, lisped vocals, dance parts and sometimes synths.

As the 1990s drew to a close, a wave of metalcore bands began incorporating elements of melodic death metal into their sound. This formed an early version of what would become the melodic metalcore genre, with Shadows Fall&#x27;s &quot;Somber Eyes to the Sky&quot; (1997), Undying&#x27;s &quot;This Day All Gods Die&quot; (1999), Darkest Hour&#x27;s &quot;The Prophecy Fulfilled&quot; (1999), Unearth&#x27;s &quot;Above the Fall of Man&quot; (1999), Prayer for Cleansing&#x27;s &quot;Rain in Endless Fall&quot; (1999) being some of the style&#x27;s earliest releases. CMJ writer Anthony Delia also credited Florida&#x27;s Poison the Well and their first two releases &quot;The Opposite of December... A Season of Separation&quot; (1999) and &quot;Tear from the Red&quot; (2002) as &quot;design[ing] the template for most of&quot; the melodic metalcore bands to come.

===2000s===

By 1999 and 2000, the youth crew revival was in decline, with Ten Yard Fight, In My Eyes and Floorpunch all disbanding. As a reaction against the homogeneity and simplicity that scene had developed, Ten Yard Fight guitarist Tim Cossar and the band&#x27;s roadie Wesley Eisold formed American Nightmare. Although still musically rooted in the youth crew revival, the band&#x27;s negative, poetic lyrics of self-loathing were inspired by groups like the Smiths. American Nightmare&#x27;s influence was apparent promptly in their home of Boston, then expanded nationally with the release of their 2001 debut album &quot;Background Music&quot;, being followed by a wave bands including Ceremony, Ruiner, Modern Life Is War, the Hope Conspiracy and Killing the Dream. A reaction against this movement also took place, which began with Mental, who were quickly followed by Have Heart. Have Heart&#x27;s success led to the rise in popularity of other positive hardcore groups like Champion, Verse and Sinking Ships, and the rise in prominence of Bridge 9 Records. In an &quot;AllMusic&quot; review, Greg Prato wrote about the label&#x27;s band Energy that &quot;While you wouldn&#x27;t go quite as far as calling Energy &quot;a hardcore boy band,&quot; the group&#x27;s leanings toward the mainstream are undeniable throughout &quot;Invasions of the Mind&quot;. Friends Stand United (FSU) formed in Boston in the 1980s in an attempt to expel neo-Nazis from the scene. By the early 2000s, there were FSU chapters in Philadelphia, Chicago, Arizona, Los Angeles, Seattle, upstate New York and New Jersey, and they were considered to have about 200 members. The Federal Bureau of Investigation eventually classified FSU as a street gang, which used violent methods and repeatedly assault people at hardcore shows and on Boston streets. In conjunction with the gang activities, James eventually did time in jail for extortion.

With the increased popularity of punk rock in the mid-1990s and the 2000s, additional hardcore bands signed with major record labels. In 2001, New York&#x27;s H2O released the album &quot;Go&quot; on MCA, but it failed at bringing the band big success, and fell flat with longtime fans. In 2002, AFI signed to DreamWorks Records but changed their sound considerably for its successful major label debut &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot;. Chicago&#x27;s Rise Against were signed by Geffen Records, and three of its releases on the label were certified platinum by the RIAA. Like AFI, Rise Against gradually removed elements of hardcore from their music, culminating with 2008&#x27;s &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;, which lacked the intensity found in their earlier albums. United Kingdom band Gallows were signed to Warner Bros. Records for £1 million. Their major label debut &quot;Grey Britain&quot; was more aggressive than their previous material, and the band was subsequently dropped from the label. The success of the band led to other British hardcore acts of the time gain notability like the Ghost of a Thousand and Heights. Los Angeles band the Bronx briefly appeared on Island Def Jam Music Group for the release of their 2006 self-titled album, which was named one of the top 40 albums of the year by &quot;Spin&quot; magazine. They appeared in the Darby Crash biopic &quot;What We Do Is Secret&quot;, playing members of Black Flag. In 2007, Toronto&#x27;s Fucked Up appeared on &quot;MTV Live Canada&quot;, where they were introduced as &quot;Effed Up&quot;. During the performance of its song &quot;Baiting the Public&quot;, the majority of the audience was moshing, which caused $2000 in damages to the set. Fucked Up went on to win the 2009 Polaris Music Prize for the album &quot;The Chemistry of Common Life&quot;.

Australian hardcore also took off during this time with bands like Miles Away, Break Even, 50 Lions (formed in 2005), and Iron Mind (formed in 2006). The genre was played on the national Triple J network on the &quot;short.fast.loud&quot; program. Australian labels that released hardcore music include Broken Hive Records, Resist Records and UNFD Records.

===2010s===

With many bands breaking up in the late 2000s, accompanied by a general sense of sonic homogeny in the hardcore genre, the 2010s became a decade of experimentation and fusion in hardcore music that was fueled by access to streaming. Drawing from and collaborating with elements of other eras and genres, hardcore grew as music styles intersected. For instance, bands like Trash Talk began collaborating with artists like Tyler, the Creator and his hip hop collective Odd Future. Meanwhile, bands like Fury, Fiddlehead, and Give garnered a great deal of attention on an underground level for their lyricism and diverse sounds. Other prominent bands, like Title Fight and Basement brought elements of shoegaze and &#x27;90s noise rock into the hardcore genre.

Trapped Under Ice were one of the most prominent bands in hardcore in the early 2010s. The band&#x27;s second album &quot;Big Kiss Goodnight&quot; (2011) changing the sonic landscape of hardcore at the time, with &quot;Stereogum&quot; writer Tom Breiham stating in a 2023 article that &quot;it&#x27;s been years since we&#x27;ve gotten a new Trapped Under Ice song, but that band&#x27;s influence looms large over the entire hardcore landscape today.&quot; However, in 2013, the band suddenly disbanded, disheartened by the amount of interest in them by the music industry. In the meantime, its members focused on their other projects Angel Dust, Diamond Youth, Down to Nothing and Turnstile. Angel Dust&#x27;s embrace of styles like indie pop, and Turnstile&#x27;s of 1960s surf music and 1990s alternative rock led to them, too, becoming formidable in the follow decade.

In the early to mid-2010s, a number of British hardcore punk bands began being represented as members of a new musical movement dubbed the New Wave of British Hardcore, a term coined by Adam Malik from the Essence Records. Bands who are part of the movement generally take influence from &#x27;80s Boston and New York hardcore bands. Bands associated with the movement include Arms Race, Violent Reaction, Big Cheese, Higher Power, Perspex Flesh, Mob Rules, the Flex and Blind Authority. Some bands such as Rapture, Violent Reaction and Payday are straight edge.

During this time, Muslim hardcore bands have emerged in the U.S., Canada, Pakistan, and Indonesia. The development of Muslim hardcore has been traced to the impact of a 2010 film &quot;Taqwacore&quot;, a documentary about the Muslim hardcore scene. Bands include the Kominas from Boston, the all-girl Secret Trial Five from Toronto, Al Thawra (The Power) from Chicago &quot;and even a few bands out in Pakistan and Indonesia.&quot; Partly due to developments in digital communications, there was a rise in interaction between hardcore scenes in different places and subgenres, particularly in Europe. In September 2017, &quot;Bandcamp Daily&quot; wrote that Fluff Fest, which has been held in the Czech Republic since 2000 and features an international lineup of independent bands ranging in style from crust punk to screamo, &quot;has established itself as the main DIY hardcore punk event in Europe&quot;.

During the decade, many hardcore bands also had considerable chart recognition. Turnstile signed to Roadrunner Records in 2017 and released their sophomore album &quot;Time &amp; Space&quot; in 2018, which reached number one on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. Gouge Away, formed in 2012 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, saw their record &quot;Burnt Sugar&quot; peak at 46 on Billboard Independent Albums. Code Orange, who formed in Pittsburgh in 2008, their 2014 sophomore album &quot;I Am King&quot; reached number 96 on the Billboard 200, and its follow up, 2017&#x27;s &quot;Forever&quot; peaked and number 62. Kentucky hardcore band Knocked Loose formed in 2013 and released their debut album &quot;Laugh Tracks&quot; in 2016, which peaked at number 163 on the Billboard 200. Its follow-up &quot;A Different Shade of Blue&quot; was released in 2019 and peaked at number 26. Many of these bands were a part of wave of bands gaining recognition for harkening back to the metallic hardcore sound of bands from the 1990s, which included Vein.fm, Code Orange, Knocked Loose, Varials, Jesus Piece, Counterparts and Kublai Khan.

Hardcore in the late 2010s saw a significant growth of the scene to involve bands taking influence from styles generally disassociated with it, such as industrial, heavy metal, post-punk and nu metal. Around this time, mainstream rappers began to associate themselves with the hardcore scene. Playboi Carti included a performance from a hardcore show as the front cover for his 2018 album &quot;Die Lit&quot;, Denzel Curry collaborated with Bad Brains and Fucked Up in 2019 and rap groups Suicideboys and City Morgue were joined on tour by hardcore bands Turnstile and Trash Talk. Rappers Wicca Phase Springs Eternal and Ghostemane even began playing music by performing in hardcore bands. In September 2019, rap group Injury Reserve released a collaborative track with Code Orange and JPEGMafia.

In 2019, the highly influential 2000s Boston hardcore band Have Heart reunited for performances in four different locations after a ten-year breakup. One of these performances was outside the Worcester Palladium in Massachusetts, which drew around 10,000 attendees, making it the largest standalone hardcore show in history.

===2020s===

The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic made the prospect of playing live music difficult. This brought about a heavy digital shift in independent music, where many bands began performing livestream shows for fans until physical shows could occur. With social distancing limiting the availability of physical interactions, the hardcore community relied on social media activity, podcasting, zines, and video content to stay connected virtually. During this period, a number of hardcore releases gained attention from the media and online that surpassed the genre&#x27;s usual scope, namely Code Orange&#x27;s &quot;Underneath&quot; (2020), Higher Power&#x27;s &quot;27 Miles Underwater&quot; (2021) and Turnstile&#x27;s &quot;Glow On&quot; (2021). &quot;Underneath&quot; topped the UK Rock &amp; Metal Albums, reached number two on the US Top Tastemaker Albums chart, and received universal critical acclaim. Higher Power were hailed by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; as &quot;the band redefining hardcore for a new generation&quot;, and voted the most likely UK band to break into the mainstream in a &quot;Revolver&quot; fan poll. However, &quot;Glow On&quot; triggered an international explosion in popularity of the genre, and allowed for the subsequent success of bands including Zulu, High Vis and Speed. &quot;Glow On&quot; also received universal critical acclaim, peaked at number two on the UK Rock &amp; Metal Albums, and number thirty on the mainline &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. A podcast published the &quot;New York Times&quot; credited a number of viral videos of live performances by hardcore bands as contributing to the popularity, including Sunami&#x27;s live debut in San Jose on October 26, 2019, Hate5six&#x27;s July 03, 2021 video of Mindforce performing at Underground Arts in Philadelphia and Turnstile&#x27;s performance in Oxnard on August 29, 2021.

The southern San Francisco Bay Area scene gained particular prevalence in the 2020s, based in Santa Cruz and San Jose. The first of these bands was Gulch, who formed in 2016, and were later followed by Scowl, Drain and Sunami. As lockdowns began to ease, many of the bands in this scene began to put on &quot;guerilla shows&quot;, such as one that took place on June 19, 2021, in San Jose featuring Sunami, Gulch, Drain, Scowl, Xibalba and Maya Over Eyes, which had an attendance of around 2,000. Gulch performed their final live performance at Sound and Fury Festival on July 31, 2022, at the peak of their popularity.

This period also saw a number of groups garner attention while experimenting with hardcore&#x27;s sound. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; named London&#x27;s Chubby and the Gang and Detroit&#x27;s the Armed as two of the most commercially successful groups of this wave, while &quot;Spin&quot; magazine cited Militarie Gun, High Vis and Scowl as bands &quot;help[ing] to breathe life back into both&quot; alternative rock and hardcore.

==Influence==

Hardcore punk has spawned a number of subgenres, fusion genres and derivative forms. Key derivatives like , emo, and skate punk have had a major impact on alternative music. Other subgenres include D-beat, melodic hardcore, crust punk, and thrashcore. Fusion genres include crossover thrash, grindcore, and metalcore, all of which fuse hardcore punk with extreme metal.

Metallica and Slayer, pioneers of the heavy metal subgenre thrash metal, were influenced by a number of hardcore bands. Metallica&#x27;s cover album &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; included covers of two Discharge and three Misfits songs, while Slayer&#x27;s cover album &quot;Undisputed Attitude&quot; consisted of covers of predominately hardcore punk bands.

The Washington state band Melvins, aside from their influence on grunge, helped create what would be known as sludge metal, which is also a combination between Black Sabbath-style music and hardcore punk. This genre developed during the early 1990s, in the Southern United States (particularly in the New Orleans metal scene). Some of the pioneering bands of sludge metal were Eyehategod, Crowbar, Down, Buzzov*en, Acid Bath and Corrosion of Conformity. Later, bands such as Isis and Neurosis, with similar influences, created a style that relies mostly on ambience and atmosphere that would eventually be named atmospheric sludge metal or post-metal.

===Fusion and subgenres===
====D-beat====

D-beat (also known as discore or kängpunk) is a hardcore punk subgenre, developed in the early 1980s by imitators of the band Discharge, after whom the genre is named, as well as a drum beat characteristic of this subgenre. The bands Discharge and the Varukers are pioneers of the D-beat genre. Robbie Mackey of &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; described D-beat as &quot;hardcore drumming set against breakneck riffage and unintelligible howls about anarchy, working-stiffs-as-rats, and banding together to, you know, fight.&quot;
====Emo and post-hardcore====
The 1980s saw the development of post-hardcore, which took the hardcore style in a more complex and dynamic direction, with a focus on singing rather than screaming. The post-hardcore style first took shape in Chicago, with bands such as Big Black, the Effigies and Naked Raygun. It later developed in Washington, D.C., within the community of bands on Ian MacKaye&#x27;s Dischord Records, with bands such as Fugazi, the Nation of Ulysses, and Jawbox. The style extended until the late 2000s. The mid-&#x27;80s Washington, D.C., Revolution Summer movement and post-hardcore scene would also see the birth of emo. Guy Picciotto formed Rites of Spring in 1984, breaking free of hardcore&#x27;s self-imposed boundaries in favor of melodic guitars, varied rhythms, and deeply personal, impassioned lyrics dealing with nostalgia, romantic bitterness, and poetic desperation. Other D.C. bands such as Gray Matter, Beefeater, Fire Party, Dag Nasty, also became connected to this movement. The style was dubbed &quot;emo&quot;, &quot;emo-core&quot;, or &quot;post-harDCore&quot; (in reference to one of the names given to the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene).

====Thrashcore and powerviolence====
Often confused with crossover thrash and sometimes thrash metal is thrashcore. Thrashcore (also known as fastcore) is a subgenre of hardcore punk that emerged in the early 1980s. It is essentially sped-up hardcore punk, with bands often using blast beats. Just as hardcore punk groups distinguished themselves from their punk rock predecessors by their greater intensity and aggression, thrashcore groups (often identified simply as &quot;thrash&quot;) sought to play at breakneck tempos that would radicalize the innovations of hardcore. Early American thrashcore groups included Cryptic Slaughter (Santa Monica), D.R.I. (Houston), Ludichrist, (Long Island), Septic Death (Boise) and Siege (Weymouth, Massachusetts). Thrashcore spun off into powerviolence, another raw and dissonant subgenre of hardcore punk. Other notable powerviolence bands include early Ceremony, Man is the Bastard and Spazz.

====Grindcore====
Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that began the early to mid-1980s. Grindcore music relies on heavy metal instrumentation and eventually changed into a genre similar to death metal. Grindcore vocals, according to AllMusic, range &quot;from high-pitched shrieks to low, throat-shredding growls and barks&quot;. Grindcore also features blast beats; according to Adam MacGregor of &quot;Dusted&quot;, &quot;the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the kick drum, snare and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.&quot; The band Napalm Death invented the grindcore genre; their debut album &quot;Scum&quot; was described by AllMusic as &quot;perhaps the most representative example of&quot; grindcore.

====Beatdown hardcore====

Beatdown hardcore (also known as heavy hardcore, brutal hardcore, toughguy, and moshcore) is a style of hardcore punk and heavy metal which has deep, hoarse vocals, down-tuned guitars, blast beats, and slow breakdowns. More heavy metal-influenced than traditional hardcore punk, Rotting Out, Strife, Shai Hulud, Madball and Hatebreed all are beatdown hardcore bands.

====Metalcore====
Metalcore is a fusion genre that merges hardcore punk with extreme metal. Metalcore has screaming, growling, heavy guitar riffs, breakdowns, and double bass drumming. Heavy metal–hardcore punk hybrids arose in the mid-1980s and would also radicalize the innovations of hardcore as the two genres and their ideologies intertwined noticeably. The term has been used to refer to bands that were not purely hardcore nor purely metal such as Earth Crisis, Integrity and Hogan&#x27;s Heroes. During the 2000s, there was a metalcore explosion and bands like Bullet for My Valentine, Killswitch Engage, Atreyu, Shadows Fall, and As I Lay Dying all had some popularity.

====Grunge====
In the mid-1980s, bands such as Melvins, Flipper and Green River developed a sludgy, &quot;aggressive sound that melded the slower tempos of heavy metal with the intensity of hardcore,&quot; creating an alternative rock subgenre known as grunge. Grunge evolved from the local Seattle punk rock scene, and it was inspired by bands such as the Fartz, 10 Minute Warning and the Accüsed. Grunge fuses elements of hardcore and heavy metal, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. Grunge&#x27;s key guitar influences included Black Flag and the Melvins. Black Flag&#x27;s 1984 record &quot;My War&quot;, on which the band combined heavy metal with their traditional sound, made a strong impact in Seattle.

====Nintendocore====
Nintendocore, another musical style, fuses hardcore with video game music, chiptune, and 8-bit music.

====Sludgecore====

Eyehategod formed in Harvey, Louisiana in 1988 and is credited with originating a new style—New Orleans hardcore-edged sludge. Another viewpoint is that New Orleans was the birthplace of the sludgecore movement, with Eyehategod being given the most credit for it. Sludgecore combines sludge metal with hardcore punk, and possesses a slow pace, a low guitar tuning, and a grinding dirge-like feel. Bands regarded as sludgecore include Acid Bath, Eyehategod, and Soilent Green, and all three formed in Louisiana. Crowbar formed in 1991 and mixed &quot;detuned, lethargic sludged-out metal with hardcore and southern elements&quot;. According to rock journalist Steve Huey writing in AllMusic, Eyehategod was a sludge metal band that became part of the &quot;Southern sludgecore scene&quot;. This scene also included Crowbar and Down, with all three bands being influenced by Black Flag, Black Sabbath, and the Melvins. Some of these bands incorporated Southern rock influences.

<text>Svante Pääbo (; born 20 April 1955) is a Swedish geneticist and Nobel Laureate who specialises in the field of evolutionary genetics. As one of the founders of paleogenetics, he has worked extensively on the Neanderthal genome. In 1997, he became founding director of the Department of Genetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. Since 1999, he has been an honorary professor at Leipzig University; he currently teaches molecular evolutionary biology at the university. He is also an adjunct professor at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Japan. 

In 2022, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for his discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution&quot;.

== Education and early life ==
Pääbo was born in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1955 and grew up there with his mother, Estonian chemist Karin Pääbo (; 1925–2013), who had escaped from the Soviet invasion in 1944 and arrived in Sweden as a refugee during World War II. He was born through an extramarital affair of his father, Swedish biochemist Sune Bergström (1916–2004), who, like his son, became a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (in 1982). Pääbo is his mother&#x27;s only child; he has via his father&#x27;s marriage a half-brother (also born in 1955). 

Pääbo grew up as a native Swedish speaker. In a 2012 interview with the Estonian newspaper &quot;Eesti Päevaleht&quot;, he said that he self-identifies as a Swede, but has a &quot;special relationship with Estonia&quot;. 

In 1975, Pääbo began studying at Uppsala University, serving one year in the Swedish Defense Forces attached to the School of Interpreters. Pääbo earned his Ph.D. from Uppsala University in 1986 for research investigating how the E19 protein of adenoviruses modulates the immune system.

== Research and career ==
Pääbo is known as one of the founders of paleogenetics, a discipline that uses genetics to study early humans and other ancient species. 

From 1986 to 1987, he did postdoctoral research at the Institute for Molecular Biology II, University of Zurich, Switzerland.

As an EMBO Postdoctoral Fellow, Pääbo moved to the United States in 1987, accepting a position as a postdoctoral researcher in biochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, where he joined Allan Wilson&#x27;s lab and worked on the genome of extinct mammals.

In 1990, he returned to Europe to become professor of general biology at the University of Munich, and, in 1997, he became founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.

In 1997, Pääbo and colleagues reported their successful sequencing of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), originating from a specimen found in Feldhofer grotto in the Neander valley.

In August 2002, Pääbo&#x27;s department published findings about the &quot;language gene&quot;, FOXP2, which is mutated in some individuals with language disabilities.

In 2006, Pääbo announced a plan to reconstruct the entire genome of Neanderthals. In 2007, he was named one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 most influential people of the year.

In February 2009, at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Chicago, it was announced that the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology had completed the first draft version of the Neanderthal genome. Over 3 billion base pairs were sequenced in collaboration with the 454 Life Sciences Corporation.

In March 2010, Pääbo and his coworkers published a report about the DNA analysis of a finger bone found in the Denisova Cave in Siberia; the results suggest that the bone belonged to an extinct member of the genus &quot;Homo&quot; that had not yet been recognised, the Denisova hominin. Pääbo first wanted to classify the Denisovans as a species of their own, separate from modern humans and Neanderthals but changed his mind after peer-review. In this context, Svante Pääbo was able to show that the TKTL1 gene discovered by Johannes F. Coy has a single amino acid substitution in Neanderthals compared to modern humans. This change probably influenced neuronal development and may have contributed to the difference in brain structure between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens.

In May 2010, Pääbo and his colleagues published a draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome in the journal &quot;Science&quot;. He and his team also concluded that there was probably interbreeding between Neanderthals and Eurasian (but not Sub-Saharan African) humans. There is general mainstream support in the scientific community for this theory of interbreeding between archaic and modern humans. This admixture of modern human and Neanderthal genes is estimated to have occurred roughly between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago, in the Middle East.

In 2014, he published the book &quot;Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes&quot; where he, in the mixed form of a memoir and popular science, tells the story of the research effort to map the Neanderthal genome combined with his thoughts on human evolution.

In 2020, Hugo Zeberg and Svante Pääbo determined that more severe impacts upon victims of the COVID-19 disease, including the vulnerability to it and the incidence of the necessity of hospitalisation, have been associated via DNA analysis to be expressed in genetic variants at chromosomal region 3, features that are associated with European Neanderthal heritage. That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease. The findings were described in a Nature article with Hugo Zeberg from Karolinska Institutet and Svante Pääbo from the Max Planck Institute.

, Pääbo has an h-index of 167 according to Google Scholar and of 133 according to Scopus.

=== Awards and honours ===

In 1992, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, which is the highest honour awarded in German research. Pääbo was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 2000, and in 2004 was elected an international member of the National Academy of Sciences. In 2005, he received the prestigious Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine. In 2008, Pääbo was added to the members of the Order Pour le Mérite for Sciences and Arts. In the same year, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In October 2009, the Foundation For the Future announced that Pääbo had been awarded the 2009 Kistler Prize for his work isolating and sequencing ancient DNA, beginning in 1984 with a 2,400-year-old mummy. In June 2010, the Federation of European Biochemical Societies (FEBS) awarded him the Theodor Bücher Medal for outstanding achievements in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. In 2013, he received Gruber Prize in Genetics for groundbreaking research in evolutionary genetics. In 2014, Pääbo was awarded the Swedish :sv:Learning Ladder Prize. In June 2015, he was awarded the degree of DSc (honoris causa) at NUI Galway. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 2016, and in 2017, was awarded the Dan David Prize. In 2018, he received the Princess of Asturias Awards in the category of Scientific Research and the Körber European Science Prize, in 2020 the Japan Prize, in 2021 the Massry Prize and in 2022 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for sequencing the first Neanderthal genome.

== Personal life ==
Pääbo wrote in his 2014 book &quot;Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes&quot; that he is bisexual. He assumed he was gay until he met Linda Vigilant, an American primatologist and geneticist whose &quot;boyish charms&quot; attracted him. They have co-authored many papers, are married and raising a son and a daughter together in Leipzig.

<doc id="73021" wikidata="Q23066" url="?curid=73021" title="Cumbria">
<text>Cumbria ( ) is a ceremonial county in North West England. It borders the Scottish council areas of Dumfries and Galloway and Scottish Borders to the north, Northumberland and County Durham to the east, North Yorkshire to the south-east, Lancashire to the south, and the Irish Sea to the west. Its largest settlement is the city of Carlisle.

Cumbria is predominantly rural, with an area of and a population of 500,012; this makes it the third-largest ceremonial county in England by area but the eighth-smallest by population. Carlisle is located in the north; the towns of Workington and Whitehaven lie on the west coast, Barrow-in-Furness on the south coast, and Penrith and Kendal in the east of the county. For local government purposes the county comprises two unitary authority areas, Westmorland and Furness and Cumberland. Cumbria was created in 1974 from the historic counties of Cumberland and Westmorland, the Furness area of Lancashire, and a small part of Yorkshire.

The interior of Cumbria contains several upland areas. Together they fringe the Vale of Eden, the wide valley of the River Eden, which runs south-east to north-west across the county and broadens into the Solway Plain near Carlisle. To the north-east are part of the Border Moors, and to the east part of the North Pennines; the latter have been designated a national landscape. South of the vale are the Orton Fells, Howgill Fells, and part of the Yorkshire Dales, which are all within the Yorkshire Dales national park. The south-west contains the Lake District, a large upland area which has been designated a national park and UNESCO World Heritage Site. It includes Scafell Pike, England&#x27;s highest mountain, and Windermere, its longest and largest lake. The county has long coast to the west which is bordered by a plain for most of its length. The north-west coast is part of the Solway Firth, a national landscape, and the south coast includes the Cartmel and Furness peninsulas. East of the peninsulas, the county contains part of Arnside and Silverdale, another national landscape

The county contains several Neolithic monuments, such as Mayburgh Henge. The region was on the border of Roman Britain, and Hadrian&#x27;s Wall runs through the north of the county. In the Early Middle Ages parts of the region successively belonged to Rheged, Northumbria, and Strathclyde, and there was also a Viking presence. It became the border between England and Scotland, and was unsettled until the Union of the Crowns in 1603. During the Industrial Revolution mining took place on the Cumberland coalfield and Barrow-in-Furness became a shipbuilding centre, but the county was not heavily industrialised and the Lake District became valued for its sublime and picturesque qualities, notably by the Lake Poets.

==Name==
The place names &quot;Cumbria&quot; and &quot;Cumberland&quot; both mean &quot;land of the Cumbrians&quot; and are names derived from the term that had been used by the inhabitants of the area to describe themselves. In the period , it is likely that any group of people living in Britain who identified as &#x27;Britons&#x27; called themselves by a name similar to &#x27;Cum-ri&#x27; which means &quot;fellow countrymen&quot; (and has also survived in the Welsh name for Wales which is &quot;Cymru&quot;). The first datable record of the place name as &quot;Cumberland&quot; is from an entry in the Anglo Saxon Chronicle for the year AD 945. This record refers to a kingdom known to the Anglo Saxons as &quot;Cumberland&quot; (often also known as Strathclyde) which in the 10th century may have stretched from Loch Lomond to Leeds. The first king to be unequivocally described as king of the Cumbrians is Owain ap Dyfnwal, who ruled from .

==History==

Cumbria was created in April 1974 through an amalgamation of the administrative counties of Cumberland and Westmorland, to which parts of Lancashire (the area known as Lancashire North of the Sands) and of the West Riding of Yorkshire were added.

During the Neolithic period the area contained an important centre of stone axe production (the so-called Langdale axe factory), products of which have been found across Great Britain. During this period, stone circles and henges were built across the county, and today, Cumbria has one of the largest number of preserved field monuments in England&#x27;.

While not part of the region conquered in the Romans&#x27; initial conquest of Britain in AD 43, most of modern-day Cumbria was later conquered in response to a revolt deposing the Roman-aligned ruler of the Brigantes in AD 69. The Romans built a number of fortifications in the area during their occupation, the most famous being UNESCO World Heritage Site Hadrian&#x27;s Wall which passes through northern Cumbria.

At the end of the period of British history known as Roman Britain () the inhabitants of Cumbria were Cumbric-speaking native Celtic Britons who were probably descendants of the Brigantes and Carvetii (sometimes considered to be a sub-tribe of the Brigantes) that the Roman Empire had conquered in about AD 85. Based on inscriptional evidence from the area, the Roman &#x27; of the Carvetii seems to have covered portions of Cumbria. The names &quot;Cumbria&quot;, &#x27; (the native Welsh name for Wales), &quot;Cambria&quot;, and &quot;Cumberland&quot; are derived from the name these people gave themselves, *&quot;kombroges&quot; in Common Brittonic, which originally meant &quot;compatriots&quot;.

Although Cumbria was previously believed to have formed the core of the Early Middle Ages Brittonic kingdom of Rheged, more recent discoveries near Galloway appear to contradict this. For the rest of the first millennium, Cumbria was contested by several entities who warred over the area, including the Brythonic Celtic Kingdom of Strathclyde and the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. Most of modern-day Cumbria was a principality in the Kingdom of Scotland at the time of the Norman conquest of England in 1066 and thus was excluded from the Domesday Book survey of 1086. In 1092 the region was invaded by William II and incorporated into England. In 1133 the diocese of Carlisle was founded, cementing Cumbria&#x27;s position within the English church. Cumbria left Scottish hands for the last time in 1157. Nevertheless, the region was dominated by the many Anglo-Scottish Wars of the latter Middle Ages and early modern period and the associated Border Reivers who exploited the dynamic political situation of the region. There were at least three sieges of Carlisle fought between England and Scotland, and two further sieges during the Jacobite risings.

After the Jacobite Risings of the 18th century, Cumbria became a more stable place and, as in the rest of Northern England, the Industrial Revolution caused a large growth in urban populations. In particular, the west coast towns of Workington, Millom and Barrow-in-Furness saw large iron and steel mills develop, with Barrow also developing a significant shipbuilding industry. Kendal, Keswick and Carlisle all became mill towns, with textiles, pencils and biscuits among the products manufactured in the region. The early 19th century saw the county gain fame when the Lake Poets and other artists of the Romantic movement, such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, lived among, and were inspired by, the lakes and mountains of the region. Later, the children&#x27;s writer Beatrix Potter also wrote in the region and became a major landowner, granting much of her property to the National Trust on her death. In turn, the large amount of land owned by the National Trust assisted in the formation in 1951 of the Lake District National Park, which remains the largest National Park in England and has come to dominate the identity and economy of the county.
The Windscale fire of 10 October 1957 was the worst nuclear accident in Great Britain&#x27;s history.

Cumbria was created in 1974 from the traditional counties of Cumberland and Westmorland, the Cumberland County Borough of Carlisle, along with the North Lonsdale or Furness part of Lancashire, usually referred to as &quot;Lancashire North of the Sands&quot;, (including the county borough of Barrow-in-Furness) and, from the West Riding of Yorkshire, the Sedbergh Rural District. Between 1974 and 2023 it was governed by Cumbria County Council but in 2023 the county council was abolished and replaced by two new unitary authorities Cumberland Council and Westmorland and Furness Council, hence Cumbria only now exists as a ceremonial county.

On 2 June 2010, taxi driver Derrick Bird killed 12 people and injured 11 others in a shooting spree that spanned over along the Cumbrian coastline.

Local newspapers &quot;The Westmorland Gazette&quot; and &quot;Cumberland and Westmorland Herald&quot; continue to use the name of their historic counties. Other publications, such as local government promotional material, describe the area as &quot;Cumbria&quot;, as does the Lake District National Park Authority.

==Geography==

Cumbria is the most northwesterly ceremonial county of England and is mostly mountainous, with large upland areas to the south-west and east. The south-west contains the Lake District, a national park and UNESCO world heritage site which includes Scafell Pike, England&#x27;s highest mountain at , and Windermere, its longest and largest lake. The Border Moors and North Pennines lie along the county&#x27;s eastern border. The south-east contains the Orton Fells, Howgill Fells and part of the Yorkshire Dales, which are all within the Yorkshire Dales national park.

The Vale of Eden, the valley of the River Eden, runs south-east to north-west between these upland areas, and broadens into the Solway Plain near Carlisle. The county has long coast to the west, which is bordered by a plain for most of its length. In the north-west it borders the Solway Firth, a national landscape, and to the south are the Cartmel and Furness peninsulas. East of the peninsulas, the county contains part of Arnside and Silverdale, also a national landscape. The Lancaster Canal runs from Preston into southern Cumbria and is partly in use. The Ulverston Canal which once reached to Morecambe Bay is maintained although it was closed in 1945.

===Boundaries and divisions===
The northernmost and southernmost points in Cumbria are just west of Deadwater, Northumberland and South Walney respectively. Kirkby Stephen (close to Tan Hill, North Yorkshire) and St Bees Head are the most easterly and westerly points of the county. The boundaries are along the Irish Sea to Morecambe Bay in the west, and along the Pennines to the east. Cumbria&#x27;s northern boundary stretches from the Solway Firth from the Solway Plain eastward along the border with Scotland.

Cumbria is bordered by Northumberland, County Durham, North Yorkshire, Lancashire in England, and Dumfries and Roxburgh, Ettrick and Lauderdale in Scotland.
==Economy==

Many large companies and organisations are based in Cumbria. The county council itself employs around 17,000 individuals, while the largest private employer in Cumbria, BAE Systems in Barrow employs around 12,000 with further job growth associated with new contracts expected, the Sellafield nuclear processing site, has a workforce of 10,000.

===Tourism===

The largest and most widespread industry is tourism, with the county attracting over 47 million visitors annually. The Lake District National Park alone receives some 15.8 million visitors every year. Despite this, fewer than 50,000 people reside permanently within the Lake District: mostly in Ambleside, Bowness-on-Windermere, Coniston, Keswick, Gosforth, Grasmere and Windermere. Over 36,000 Cumbrians are employed in the tourism industry which adds £1.1 billion a year to the county&#x27;s economy. The Lake District and county as a whole attract visitors from across the UK, Europe, North America and the Far East (particularly Japan). The tables below show the twenty most-visited attractions in Cumbria in 2009. (Not all visitor attractions provided data to Cumbria Tourism who collated the list. Notable examples are Furness Abbey, the Lakes Aquarium and South Lakes Safari Zoo, the last of which would almost certainly rank within the top five).

==Governance==
===Local===
Cumbria is governed by two unitary authorities, Cumberland Council and Westmorland and Furness Council. The Cumberland unitary authority area covers the north and west of Cumbria, and Westmorland and Furness the south and east; they are named after the historic counties of Cumberland and Westmorland, but have different boundaries. Cumberland has had a Labour majority administration since the 2022 Cumberland Council election, and Westmorland and Furness has had a Liberal Democrat majority administration since the 2022 Westmorland and Furness Council election. Cumberland Council and Westmorland and Furness Council collaborate through a Joint Executive Committee and the Enterprising Cumbria Economic Growth Body. In September 2024, the two councils submitted an expression of interest to form a combined authority. Plans for a mayoral combined authority were agreed by the UK government in February 2025, with the first mayor expected to be elected in May 2026.

Between 1974 and 2023 Cumbria was administered by Cumbria County Council and six district councils: Allerdale, Barrow-in-Furness, Carlisle, Copeland, Eden, and South Lakeland. These were abolished on 1 April 2023, when the two unitary authorities were established.

The Duchy of Lancaster, the private estate of the sovereign, exercises some rights of the Crown in the County Palatine of Lancaster, which includes the Furness area of Cumbria.

===National===
Until the 2024 general election, there were six parliamentary constituencies in Cumbria: Barrow and Furness, Carlisle, Copeland, Penrith and the Border, Westmorland and Lonsdale, and Workington. Five were won by the Conservative Party in the 2019 United Kingdom general election, with Westmorland and Lonsdale won by the Liberal Democrats. The 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies abolished Copeland, Workington, and Penrith and the Border, replacing them with the new constituencies of Penrith and Solway and Whitehaven and Workington. The three remaining constituencies underwent significant boundary changes, including some electoral wards being transferred from Westmorland and Lonsdale to Morecambe and Lunesdale, making the latter a cross-county constituency (it had previously been exclusively in Lancashire).


=== Politics ===
Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats are strongest in rural areas, and Labour is strongest in the industrial towns.

==Education==


Although Cumbria has a comprehensive system almost fully, there is one state grammar school in Penrith. There are 42 state secondary schools and 10 independent schools. The more rural secondary schools tend to have sixth forms (although in Barrow-in-Furness district, no schools have sixth forms due to the only sixth form college in Cumbria being located in the town) and this is the same for three schools in Allerdale and South Lakeland, and one in the other districts. Chetwynde is also the only school in Barrow to educate children from nursery all the way to year 11.

Colleges of further education in Cumbria include:
* Carlisle College
* Furness College which includes Barrow Sixth Form College
* Kendal College
* Lakes College

The University of Cumbria is one of the UK&#x27;s newest universities, having been established in 2007. It is at present the only university in Cumbria and has campuses across the county, together with Lancaster and London.

==Transport==
===Road===

The M6 is the only motorway that runs through Cumbria. Kendal and Penrith are amongst its primary destinations. Further north it becomes the A74(M) at the border with Scotland north of Carlisle. Major A roads within Cumbria include:
Several bus companies run services in Cumbria serving the main towns and villages in the county, with some services running to neighbouring areas such as Lancaster. Stagecoach Cumbria &amp; North Lancashire is the largest; it has depots in Barrow-in-Furness, Carlisle, Kendal and Workington. Stagecoach&#x27;s flagship X6 route connects Barrow-in-Furness and Kendal in south Cumbria.

===Air===
There are only two airports in the county: Carlisle Lake District and Barrow/Walney Island. Both airports formerly served scheduled passenger flights and both are proposing expansions and renovations to handle domestic and European flights in the near future. The nearest international airports to south Cumbria are Blackpool, Manchester, Liverpool John Lennon and Teesside. North Cumbria is closer to Newcastle, Glasgow Prestwick and Glasgow International.

===Ports===
Barrow-in-Furness is one of the country&#x27;s largest shipbuilding centres, but the Port of Barrow is only minor, operated by Associated British Ports alongside the Port of Silloth in Allerdale. There are no ferry links from any port or harbour along the Cumbria coast.

===Rail===
The busiest railway stations in Cumbria are Carlisle, Barrow-in-Furness, Penrith and Oxenholme Lake District. The West Coast Main Line runs through the Cumbria countryside, adjacent to the M6 motorway. The Cumbrian Coast Line connects Barrow-in-Furness to Carlisle and is a vital link in the west of the county. Other railways in Cumbria are the Windermere Branch Line, most of the Furness Line and much of the Settle-Carlisle Railway.

==Demography==

=== Population ===
Cumbria&#x27;s largest settlement and only city is Carlisle, in the north of the county. The largest town, Barrow-in-Furness, in the south, is slightly smaller. The county&#x27;s population is largely rural: it has the second-lowest population density among English counties, and only five towns with over 20,000 people. Cumbria is one of the country&#x27;s most ethnically homogeneous counties, with 95% categorised as White British (around 471,000 of the 500,000). The larger towns have ethnic makeups closer to the national average. The 2001 census indicated Christianity was the religion with the most adherents in the county.

Cumbria formerly had minor American football clubs, the Furness Phantoms (the club is now defunct, its last name was Morecambe Bay Storm) and the Carlisle Kestrels.

====Association====

Barrow and Carlisle United are the only professional football teams in Cumbria. Carlisle United attract support from across Cumbria and beyond, with many Cumbrian &quot;ex-pats&quot; travelling to see their games, both home and away.

Workington—who are always known locally as &quot;the reds&quot;—are a well-supported non-league team, having been relegated from the Football League in the 1970s. Workington made a rapid rise up the non league ladder and in 2007/08 competed with Barrow in the Conference North. Barrow were then promoted to the Conference Premier in 2007/08. In 2020, Barrow were promoted to the Football League as a result of winning the National League.

Cumbrian club cricket teams play in the North Lancashire and Cumbria League.

Cumbria is home to the Cartmel Valley Lions, an amateur baseball team based in Cartmel.

===Wrestling===

Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling is an ancient and well-practised tradition in the county with a strong resemblance to Scottish Backhold.

In the 21st century Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling along with other aspects of Lakeland culture are practised at the Grasmere Sports and Show, an annual meeting held every year since 1852 on the August Bank Holiday.

The origin of this form of wrestling is a matter of debate, with some describing it as having evolved from Norse wrestling brought over by Viking invaders, while other historians associate it with the Cornish and Gouren styles indicating that it may have developed out of a longer-standing Celtic tradition.

===Racing===
Cumbria Kart Racing Club is based at the Lakeland Circuit, Rowrah, between Cockermouth and Egremont Lakeland Circuit. The track is currently a venue for rounds of both major UK national karting championships About Cumbria Kart Racing Club. Formula One world champions Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button both raced karts at Rowrah many times in the formative stages of their motor sport careers, while other F1 drivers, past and present, to have competed there include Johnny Herbert, Anthony Davidson, Allan McNish, Ralph Firman, Paul di Resta and David Coulthard, who hailed from just over the nearby Anglo-Scottish border and regarded Rowrah as his home circuit, becoming Cumbria Kart Racing Club Champion in 1985 in succession to McNish (di Resta also taking the CKRC title subsequently).

Workington Comets were a Workington-based professional speedway team, which competed in the British Speedway Championship.

==Food==

Cumbria is the UK county with the highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants, with seven in this classification in the Great Britain and Ireland Michelin Guide of 2021. Traditional Cumbrian cuisine has been influenced by the spices and molasses that were imported into Whitehaven in the 18th century. The Cumberland sausage (which has a protected geographical status) is a well-recognised result of this. Other regional specialities include Herdwick mutton and the salt-marsh raised lamb of the Cartmel Peninsula.

== Dialect influences ==
===Celtic===
* Cumbria was mostly Celtic speaking until the Viking invasion, if not later (Cymry)
* English spoken in parts of Cumbria; relatively sparsely populated until 12th/13th centuries 
* The invading Angles and Saxons forced the indigenous Celtic peoples back to the western highlands of Cumbria, Wales and Cornwall, with little linguistic consequence, apart from a residual scattering of place-names.
* Northwest – possibility of direct influence from Irish Gaelic across Irish Sea via Whitehaven until 10th century
* Celtic influence/kingdoms may have confirmed perception of difference between the north–south
* Linguistic interaction between Celts and English underrated: effectively Celtic influence marked the beginnings of a linguistic divide between English and other West Germanic dialects.
* Lexis – Celtic influence left specifically on the sound pattern of sheep-scoring numerals of Cumbrian and West Yorkshire
* Loss of inflections may be explained by contact with Celtic tribes and inter-marriage.

===Anglo-Saxon/Viking===
* Earliest Anglo-Saxon settlements in the east of England. Took over 200 years to establish a frontier in the west where the displaced British had settled
* Morphology – Old Northumbrian (little evidence) signs of loss of inflexions long before southern dialects below the Humber, precede Viking settlements and dialect contact situation

===Scandinavian/Norse/Dane===
* Lack of extent of Old English written evidence
* Main attacks/raids on the North-East coast at Lindisfarne and Jarrow in 793/ 794
* Settlement patterns (Danes) contributed to emerging differences over time between Northumberland. Durham and Yorkshire dialects
* Norwegian settlers via Ireland to Isle of Man, Mersey estuary (901) and the Cumbrian/ Lancashire coasts (900–50) – dialectal differences (Danes/ Norwegians) often lumped together in standard histories – MUST have confirmed emerging dialectal differences east and west of the Pennines
* Danelaw – land of north and east of land ruled under Danish law and Danish customs (978–1016)
* Scandinavian influences vocabulary – common words gradually diffused/ entered word stock (borrowings) which survive in regional use – &quot;fell&quot; (&#x27;hillside&#x27;), &quot;lug&quot; (&#x27;ear&#x27;), &quot;loup&quot; (&#x27;jump&#x27;), &quot;aye&quot; (&#x27;yes&#x27;)
* Influence on grammatical structure – Middle English texts reveal that present participle form &quot;-and&quot;, and possible that use of &quot;at&quot; and &quot;as&quot; as relative pronouns from Cumbria to East Yorkshire
* Phonetically /g/, /k/ and cluster /sk/ have a northern/ Norse pronunciation /j/, /ʧ/ and /ʃ/ which are West Saxon – hard vs. soft consonants of north–south dialects – e.g. &quot;give/ rigg&quot; (&#x27;ridge&#x27;), &quot;skrike&quot; (&#x27;shriek&#x27;), &quot;kist&quot; (&#x27;chest&#x27;) and &quot;ik&quot; (&#x27;I&#x27;)
* &#x27;Interdialect forms&#x27; in Danelaw area (diffuse &gt; focussed situation) – no clear idea about what language they were speaking – mixture of Old English and Norse e.g. &quot;she&quot; (3rd person pronoun) is claimed by both languages
* Bilingualism was norm in areas under Danelaw (plausible)
* Norse runic inscriptions survive from 11th century in Cumbria – therefore may only been after Norman Conquest that &#x27;Norse as a living language died out&#x27;
* Norse surviving longest in closed communities

===Normans===
* Jewell (1994: 20) – Northumbria retained relative independence until 13th century – effective government of North by Normans &#x27;petered-out&#x27; at Lake District and North of Tees (not recorded in Domesday Book)
* Carlisle retaken by Scots in 1136

===Cumbric===

* Early 10th century – The grip from Northumbrian on the former territory of Rheged was that of Britons of Strathcylde reoccupied southwest Scotland and northwest England as far south as Derwent and Penrith. which was held until Carlisle retaken by Scots in 1136
* Cumbric perhaps survived until it faded in the early 12th century throughout Cumbria.
* Cumbric score – counting sheep – Welsh correspondence Welsh (&quot;un, dau, tri&quot;) – Cumberland (&quot;yan, tyan, tethera&quot;) – Westmorland (&quot;yan, than, teddera&quot;) – Lancashire (&quot;yan, taen, tedderte&quot;) – West Yorkshire (&quot;yain, tain, eddero&quot;) – survived 7–8 centuries after the language itself had died – Brittonic origin
* Not one single complete phrase in Cumbric survives, evidence to suggest strong literary tradition, probably oral, some of this early material is known in a Welsh version

==Media==
Two evening newspapers are published daily in Cumbria. The &quot;News and Star&quot; focuses largely on Carlisle and the surrounding areas of north and west Cumbria, and the &quot;North-West Evening Mail&quot; is based in Barrow-in-Furness and covers news from across Furness and the South Lakes. The &quot;Cumberland and Westmorland Herald&quot; and &quot;The Westmorland Gazette&quot; are weekly newspapers based in Penrith and Kendal respectively. The Egremont 2Day newspaper, formerly Egremont Today when affiliated with the Labour Party, was a prominent monthly publication – founded by Peter Watson (and edited by him until his death in 2014) in 1990 until July 2018. In February 2020 The Herdwick News, run by the last editor of The Egremont 2Day, was launched and is an independent online news publication covering the county of Cumbria and the North West.

Due to the size of Cumbria the county spans two television zones: BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Border in the north and centre, and BBC North West and ITV Granada in the south. Heart North West, Greatest Hits Radio Cumbria &amp; South West Scotland and Smooth Lake District are the most popular local radio stations throughout the county, with BBC Radio Cumbria being the only station that is aimed at Cumbria as a whole. BBC Radio Lancashire can also be received in southern parts of the county.

<text>Samuel Blommaert (&quot;Bloemaert&quot;, &quot;Blommaerts&quot;, &quot;Blommaart&quot;, &quot;Blomert&quot;, etc.) (11 or 21 August 1583, in Antwerp – 23 December 1651, in Amsterdam) was a Flemish/Dutch merchant and director of the Dutch West India Company from 1622 to 1629 and again from 1636 to 1642. In the latter period, he was a paid commissioner of Sweden in the Netherlands and he played a dubious but key role in Peter Minuit&#x27;s expedition that led to the Swedish colonizing of New Sweden. For years Blommaert was involved in the copper trade and industry. In 1645 he was appointed for a third time as a manager of the WIC, being one of the main investors from the beginning.

==Early life==
Blommaert was born in Antwerp, Duchy of Brabant, in current-day Belgium but grew up in London. He was the son of Margaretha Hoefnagel (-1585) and the wealthy goldsmith/merchant Lodewijk Blommaert (1537–1591), who in 1581 was schepen of Antwerp and in 1583 captain at Fort Lillo on the eastern border of the Scheldt; he knew the area very well as his ancestors came from Bergen-op-Zoom. His mother died when Samuel was young and his father moved the family to London when Antwerp was occupied in 1585 by the Duke of Parma. In 1587 he remarried Janneken van Hove but he died four years later. Samuel was apprenticed in Stade with his aunt Susanne, and in Vienna at his uncle Daniel. In 1601 he became &quot;poorter&quot; of Amsterdam. In 1602 he visited Benin. 

In 1603, Samuel enlisted with the Dutch East India Company and traveled to the Dutch East Indies on a ship under admiral Steven van der Hagen. In the years 1605–1607 he stayed on Borneo. He was sent by the board (Jacques l&#x27;Hermite) to Sukadana West Kalimantan to free merchant Hans Roeff, who had died or left when Blommaert arrived. He returned to Bantam with 633 diamonds he was able to save at the trading post. In 1609/1610 he again stayed on Sambas, Borneo and was able to get a monopoly on diamond trade for the VOC. In September 1610, after seven years, he left sooner than expected and arrived in June 1611 at Texel. Pieter Both had to investigate the case. On 5 June 1612, he married the 22-years-old Catharina Reynst, a daughter of Gerard Reynst, governor of the East Indies. Both were living at Sint Antoniesbreestraat with whom he would have twelve children between 1613 and 1633; two died in an early age.

==Early career==
For many years Blommaert was involved in a company which traded in copper from Angola and the African coast, together with Frans Jacobsz. Hinlopen, and Lucas van der Venne. In 1615 Jacob le Maire carried a letter from his father Isaac le Maire to be presented to Governor Reynst, with an offer to smuggle goods to his son-in-law in Amsterdam. Blommaert was investigated in Amsterdam by the board of the East-India Company on January 30, 1616 about a vessel, named &quot;Mauritius de Nassau&quot;, sailed from a Dutch port, under the command of Jan Remmertszoon from Purmerend. The ship was ostensibly destined for Angola, but from there she was ordered to direct her course for &quot;Terra Australis.&quot; The plan, therefore, was, from the west coast of Africa to sail southward to Tierra del Fuego, and then 

Around 1619 he settled on Keizersgracht and bought a lot (30x170 ft) where a new house was built, next to Laurens Reael. In 1620 Isaac Coymans, a broker, became his brother-in-law.

==New Netherlands==
By 1621, he invested in the Amsterdam chamber of the Dutch West India Company and was appointed director in October 1622. In 1623 he and Kiliaen van Rensselaer, Samuel Godijn en Albert Coenraetsz. Burgh were investigating the possibility of the slave trade in Angola. In 1624 his grandfather Jacob Hoefnagel became one of the three mayors in Göteborg and president of the court of justice for a while. Louis de Geer received the official monopoly on the copper and iron trade in Sweden and decided to settle there. In 1627 Blommaert had an argument with Pieter Trip about 34 Swedish guns. 

In 1628 he collaborated with Van Rensselaer, Godijn and Burgh. Godyn, Van Rensselaer and Samuel Blommaert sent two persons to New Netherland to inspect the country. Gilles Housset and Jacob Jansz Cuyper bargained with the natives for a tract of land reaching from Cape Henlopen to the mouth of the Delaware River. This was in 1629, three years before the charter of Maryland, and is the oldest deed for land in the state of Delaware. The purchase was ratified in 1630 by Peter Minuit and his council at Fort Amsterdam.

A company was formed to colonize the tract that included Blommaert, Godin, Van Rensselaer, Joannes de Laet (a geographer), and David Pietersen de Vries. A ship of eighteen guns was fitted out to bring over the colonists and subsequently defend the coast, with incidental whale-fishing to help defray expenses. A colony of more than thirty souls was planted on Lewes creek, a little north of Cape Henlopen, and its governorship was entrusted to Gilles Housset. This settlement antedated by several years any in Pennsylvania, and the colony at Lewes practically laid the foundation and defined the singularly limited area of the state of Delaware, the major part of which was included in the purchase. A palisaded fort was built, with the &quot;red lion, rampant,&quot; of Holland affixed to its gate, and the country was named &quot;Swaanendael&quot; or Zwaanendael Colony, while the water was called Godyn&#x27;s Bay. The estate was further extended, on May 5, 1630, by the purchase of a tract twelve miles square on the coast of Cape May opposite, and the transaction was duly attested at Fort Amsterdam.

The existence of the little colony was short, for the Indians came down upon it in revenge for an arbitrary act on the part of Housset, and it was destroyed, not a soul escaping to tell the tale. According to acknowledged precedent, occupancy of the wilderness served to perfect title; but before the Dutch could reoccupy the desolated site at Lewes, the English were practically in possession.

Because of the ongoing Polish–Swedish War (1626–1629), no grain could be exported through the city of Dantzig. In 1630 the price of grain remained extremely high due to increasing competition. Albert Burgh tried to ensure a monopoly for the City of Amsterdam in Moscovy. In 1631 Blommaert bought rye in Archangelsk. Isaac Coymans, his brother-in-law, moved all his furniture to Keizersgracht 139 as Coymans was in trouble for embezzlement. In 1631 De Geer had a disagreement with his partner Elias Trip. The quarrel was resolved in 1634?

==New Sweden==
In 1635, he started a brass factory in Nacka, outside Stockholm, to boost the export of copper which could be used for making guns and coins. Blommaert tried to attract workers and experts from Aachen and Stolberg. In 1636, Blommaert was reappointed as &quot;bewindhebber&quot; of the WIC after its first bankruptcy, but also became the consul for Sweden in Amsterdam. In 1636 the directors of the WIC could not gather because of an outbreak of plague. In 1637 Blommaert secretly invested money in the first Swedish expedition with &quot;Fogel Grip&quot; and &quot;Kalmar Nyckel&quot; to New Sweden. By doing so, he hoped to avoid paying the Dano-Norwegian Sound Tolls on all foreign merchantmen crossing the Sound. He engaged the former diamond cutter Peter Minuit to command the expedition, without the knowledge or permission of the WIC. Blommaert suggested to Oxenstierna to take part in the WIC, and organize from Gothenburg and trade on Spanish and Portuguese ports. Blommaert was interested in seizing Spanish ships, which sailed from the East or West-Indies to Cadiz or Seville, to make his expeditions and colonization more profitable. 

In November 1637 two ships belonging to the Swedish South Company with crew and settlers left Gothenburg. Because of a storm the ships could get around Scotland; after a month at sea one arrived at Texel the other at Medemblik. The damage was provisionally repaired; sails and victuals (butter, bread, and beer) needed to be bought. Having arrived on Swedes&#x27; Landing on 29 March Minuit acted as he had done before, he did not conquer the land by force but bought it legally from the Lenape or Minqua Indians. What happened next is not very clear. (It seems he was hardly involved in building Fort Christina). Minuit left the colony mid-June, 1638 and sailed to the Caribbean island of St. Christopher where he arrived in early July to barter salt, a ship&#x27;s cargo of wine and liquor for tobacco. (Meanwhile Cornelis Jol attempted to capture the Spanish treasure fleet near Cuba with four ships but didn&#x27;t succeed to the disappointment of Blommaert.) On 5 August 1638 Minuit drowned during a hurricane at St. Christopher (today&#x27;s St. Kitts). About 20 ships drifted out of the harbour. One ship sank near the Azores, the &quot;Kalmar&quot; arrived without a mast. A second voyage, which departed on February7, 1640, and arrived at Fort Christina on April17, brought additional settlers for New Sweden. As the two expeditions turned out to be unprofitable for Blommaert, he withdrew in 1641. 

In 1639 Blommaert and Isaac Coymans sold tobacco and sugar; they were accused of cheating as there were a couple of stones in one of the cases and problems with the tobacco. In 1640 Portuguese Restoration War improved the situation for the Dutch. Blommaert was involved in mining in Dutch Brazil. In 1641 the Zwaanendael Colony was sold to Sweden; all the participants agreed on an equal share. A ship with 211 slaves arrived in Brazil. In 1642 with collaborated with Jan Valkenburgh in Angola. In 1647 he and his wife were portrayed. He told professor Nicolaes Tulp, stories on bestiality he heard on Borneo. In 1651 Blommaert got ill and was buried in Westerkerk. In 1655 his daughter Constantia (1626-) married the admiral Isaac Sweers, Catharina married Abraham Elzevir and Anna moved to Malakka with her husband, director of the VOC.

==Legacy==
Blommaert&#x27;s thirty-eight letters to Axel Oxenstierna from 1635 to 1641 are of great importance to the history of New Sweden. They mention Willem Usselincx one of the founders of the WIC, who had moved to Gothenburg in 1624 and founded the Swedish South Company; :sv:Peter Spiring dealt with the Dutch merchants. These letters were published in &quot;Repertorium Veterrimarum Societatum Litterariarum&quot; 1870–1879 of the Utrecht Historical Society and in &quot;Bijdragen en Mededeelingen&quot; (1908).

<text>Marie Bashkirtseff, born Maria Konstantinovna Bashkirtseva (; – 31 October 1884), was an émigré artist who was born into a noble family on their estate near the city of Poltava. She lived and worked in Paris, and died at the age of 25.

==Life and painting career==

Bashkirtseff was born in Gavrontsi (Havrontsi) near Poltava, Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine), to a wealthy noble family. Her father was a local marshal of nobility, Konstantin Pavlovich Bashkirtsev. Her mother Maria Stepanovna Babanina (1833—1920) also belonged to Russian nobles. Her parents separated when she was 12. As a result, she grew up mostly abroad, traveling with her mother throughout most of Europe, with longer spells in Germany and on the Riviera, until the family settled in Paris. Educated privately and with early musical talent, she lost her chance at a career as a singer when illness destroyed her voice. She then determined to become an artist, and she studied painting in France at the Robert-Fleury studio and at the .

The Académie, as one of the few establishments that accepted female students, attracted young women from all over Europe and the United States. Fellow students at the Académie included Anna Bilińska and especially Louise Breslau, whom Bashkirtseff viewed as her only real rival. Bashkirtseff would go on to produce a remarkable, if fairly conventional, body of work in her short lifetime, exhibiting at the Paris Salon as early as 1880 and every year thereafter until her death (except 1883). In 1884, she exhibited a portrait of Paris slum children entitled &quot;The Meeting&quot; and a pastel portrait of her cousin, for which she received an honorable mention.

Bashkirtseff&#x27;s best-known works are &quot;The Meeting&quot; (now in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, Paris) and her 1881 &quot;In the Studio&quot;, a portrait of her fellow artists at work. Although a large number of Bashkirtseff&#x27;s works were destroyed by the Nazis during World War II, at least 60 survive. In 2000, a U.S. touring exhibition entitled &quot;Overcoming All the Obstacles: The Women of Academy Julian&quot; featured works by Bashkirtseff and her schoolmates.
As a painter, Bashkirtseff took her cue from her friend Jules Bastien-Lepage&#x27;s admiration for realism and naturalism. Where Bastien-Lepage had found his inspiration in nature, Bashkirtseff turned to the urban scene, writing, &quot;I say nothing of the fields because Bastien-Lepage reigns over them as a sovereign; but the streets, however, have not yet had their... Bastien.&quot; By unlucky chance, both artists succumbed prematurely to chronic illness in the same year, and the later pages of Bashkirtseff&#x27;s journal record her visits to the dying painter.

Dying of tuberculosis at the age of 25, Bashkirtseff lived just long enough to emerge as an intellectual in Paris in the 1880s. She wrote several articles for Hubertine Auclert&#x27;s feminist newspaper &quot;La Citoyenne&quot; in 1881 under the nom de plume &quot;Pauline Orrel.&quot; One of her most-quoted sayings is &quot;Let us love dogs, let us love only dogs! Men and cats are unworthy creatures.&quot;

Bashkirtseff died in Paris in 1884, and she is buried in Cimetière de Passy, Paris. Her great friend Prince Bojidar Karageorgevitch was present at her deathbed. Her monument is a full-sized artist&#x27;s studio that has been declared a historic monument by the government of France. Marie Bashkirtseff was included in the 2018 exhibit &quot;Women in Paris 1850-1900&quot;.

==The diary==
From approximately the age of 13, Bashkirtseff kept a journal, and it is probably for this that she is most famous today. It has been called &quot;a strikingly modern psychological self-portrait of a young, gifted mind&quot;, and her urgent prose, which occasionally breaks out into dialogue, remains extremely readable. She was multilingual and despite her self-involvement, was a keen observer with an acute ear for hypocrisy, so that her journal also offers a near-novelistic account of the late nineteenth century European bourgeoisie. A consistent theme throughout her journal is her deep desire to achieve fame, inflected by her increasing fear that her intermittent illnesses might turn out to be tuberculosis. In a prefatory section written toward the end of her life, in which she recounts her family history, she writes, &quot;If I do not die young I hope to live as great artist; but if I die young, I intend to have my journal, which cannot fail to be interesting, published.&quot; Similarly: &quot;When I am dead, my life, which appears to me a remarkable one, will be read. (The only thing wanting is that it should have been different).&quot; In effect, the first half of Bashkirtseff&#x27;s journal is a coming-of-age story while the second is an account of heroic suffering.

Bashkirtseff&#x27;s journal was first published in 1887, and was only the second diary by a woman published in France to that date. It was an immediate success, not least because its cosmopolitan confessional style was a marked departure from the contemplative, mystical diaries of the writer Eugénie de Guérin that had been published in 1862. An English translation appeared two years later under the title &quot;Marie Bashkirtseff: The Journal of a Young Artist 1860–1884&quot;. Translated by Mary J. Serrano, it was heavily abridged and bowdlerized, her relatives seeing to it that a good deal of material they considered unflattering to the family was removed.

British Prime Minister William Gladstone referred to her journal as &quot;a book without a parallel&quot;, and another early admirer was George Bernard Shaw. The late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing read the original French version over eight days in June 1890. It remained popular, eventually spinning off both plays and movies based on her life story, including &quot;The Affairs of Maupassant&quot;, directed by Henry Koster and released in the United States in 1938. Her diary was cited as an inspiration by the American writer Mary MacLane, whose own shockingly confessional diary was written a bare generation later, and it was mentioned as a model by later writers who became known for their diaries, including Pierre Louÿs, Katherine Mansfield, W.N.P. Barbellion, and Anais Nin.

Her letters, consisting of her correspondence with the writer Guy de Maupassant (which she had begun under an assumed name) were first published in 1891.

Until recently the accepted date of Bashkirtseff&#x27;s birth was 11 November [23 November New Style], 1860. After the discovery of the original manuscript of Bashkirtseff&#x27;s journal in the , however, it was found that her journal had been abridged and censored by her family in its first editions. Her date of birth (1858 not 1860) was falsified by her mother to make Bashkirtseff appear even more precocious. An unabridged edition of the complete journal, based on the original manuscript, has been published in French in 16 volumes, and excerpts from the years 1873–1876 have been translated into English under the title &quot;I Am the Most Interesting Book of All&quot; (see editions listed below).

<text>Natalia Brasova, Countess Brasova (; born Natalia Sergeyevna Sheremetyevskaya, ; 27 June 1880 – 23 January 1952) was a Russian noblewoman who married, as her third husband, Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia.

==Early life==
Natalia, or Natasha to her friends, was the youngest of three daughters of a Moscow lawyer, Sergei Alexandrovich Sheremetevsky. She was born at a rented summer &quot;dacha&quot; at Perovo, on the outskirts of Moscow. Sheremetevsky employed 11 other lawyers, and was a member of the minor Russian nobility, but had no title and was essentially a professional middle-class man. He was a sometime deputy in the Moscow City Duma, and a trustee of the Arbat City School. In the first year of her life, Natalia and her family lived in a rented apartment near the Moscow Kremlin on Ilinka. Their landlord, wealthy industrialist Aleksey Khludov, was also Natalia&#x27;s godfather. From 1881 to 1893, the family lived at 7 Serebriany Lane, a single-storied wooden house owned by Sheremetevsky. From 1893, the family lived in a succession of rented apartments until Natalia left home on her marriage. She was educated at a private school, and by a French governess employed by her father.

==First marriage==
In 1902, she married Sergei Mamontov (1 October 1877, Moscow – 30 December 1939, Tallinn), a nephew of Savva Mamontov. Sergei was a rehearsal accompanist for Savva Mamontov&#x27;s Opera Company, which was renamed Association of Russian Opera after Savva&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1899, and later at the Bolshoi Theatre. Through her first husband&#x27;s connections, Natalia became friendly with noted musicians such as Sergei Rachmaninoff and Feodor Chaliapin. The couple moved into 13 Mansurovsky Lane, a new apartment building near the fashionable Prechistenka street, and had a daughter, Natalia or &quot;Tata&quot; to the family, on 2 June 1903. Sergei had a stammer and was of a retiring disposition, but Natalia was keen to socialise. Finding him socially dull, she began to go out unaccompanied by her husband. Russian divorce law followed the teachings of the Eastern Orthodox Church, and in practice divorce was only possible in cases of adultery where the husband was the guilty party. In 1905, Sergei agreed to a divorce and to act in the proceedings as if he was the unfaithful partner. Now free from her first husband, Natalia married her lover, cavalry officer Vladimir Vladimirovich Wulfert ().

==Second marriage==

Natalia and Wulfert had known each other as children, but only fell in love after re-meeting in Moscow when Wulfert was on leave. He was an army officer serving in The Dowager Empress&#x27;s Life Guard Cuirassier Regiment, known as the Blue Cuirassiers from the colour of their uniforms, stationed at Gatchina near Saint Petersburg. Natalia and Wulfert set up home at 7 Baggout Street, Gatchina.

In early December 1907, Natalia was introduced to one of her husband&#x27;s fellow officers in the Blue Cuirassiers: Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia, the brother of Tsar Nicholas II. The following month, they met again at the Regimental Winter Ball. From then on, they began to see each other regularly, though Michael was always careful to include Wulfert in his letters and invitations, at least until October 1908, and use the formal form of &quot;you&quot; (&quot;vy&quot;) rather than the familiar one (&quot;ty&quot;). Rumours of their affair spread through the regiment, and Wulfert grew resentful. Michael began sending her secret letters to a separate postal address, now writing to her in familiar terms, and Wulfert grew physically violent, as Natalia refused to share his bed. In July 1909, privately in a letter, she accused her husband of rape. She packed luggage, and with their daughter, an elderly female cousin, and two maids, she left Wulfert for a break abroad in Switzerland. Both Michael and Wulfert turned up at the train station to see her off, and Wulfert created a scene by loudly accusing her of ruining him.

Through Baron Frederiks, the court minister, Michael tried to buy off Wulfert by offering him a post in Moscow as aide-de-camp to Prince Odoevsky-Maslov at the Kremlin. Wulfert threatened to commit suicide if Natalia did not return to him, and then challenged Michael to a duel. Nicholas II intervened, and transferred Michael from the Blue Cuirassiers to the Chernigov Hussars at Orel, from Saint Petersburg. In August 1909, Michael went to Denmark with his mother, and arranged for Natalia to meet him there. They were reunited in a hotel in Copenhagen, unbeknownst to his mother, and consummated their relationship for the first time.

==Royal mistress==

Wulfert accepted the Kremlin post, at an enlarged salary, and as Natalia&#x27;s residence permit was tied to her husband&#x27;s she also returned to Moscow to live temporarily at a hotel opposite the Kremlin. By November, she was living in an 8-room apartment at 36 Petersburg Road, paid for by Michael, where he visited her about 3 times a month from Orel. Wulfert was still demanding that Natalia return to him, as well as threatening to shoot her. Against the wishes of Michael and Natalia, Nicholas II insisted that she remain in Moscow, and refused to vary the conditions of her residence permit.

By December 1909, Natalia was pregnant. Fearful that her husband would try to claim the child and take it away from her, her desire for a divorce grew stronger. Eventually, after prolonged negotiations and a hefty pay-off (200000 rubles), Wulfert agreed to a divorce on the pretence that he had been unfaithful. Natalia&#x27;s divorce petition was submitted to the Moscow Ecclesiastical Consistory Court on 19 February 1910, but by July 1910 it had not been granted. When she gave birth to a son on 24 July 1910, the child was legally Wulfert&#x27;s. The boy was named George in honour of Michael&#x27;s late brother. It was said that Wulfert was bought off with a bribe of 200,000 roubles, and the date of their divorce was back-dated, so that George was recognised as Natalia&#x27;s illegitimate son, though inheriting her noble status, rather than the legitimate child of Wulfert&#x27;s.

In May 1911, Nicholas II granted Natalia the surname &quot;Brasova&quot; and the right to live at Michael&#x27;s estate at Brasovo, from his posting at Orel. Michael, Natalia and her two children moved there immediately. By the end of the year, Michael was posted to a command in Saint Petersburg, and they moved to the capital. He officially lived in regimental quarters while paying for a 28-room apartment at 16 Liteyny Prospekt for her. She felt trapped in the apartment, feared that her letters were opened, and was ostracised by society. After a few months, Michael moved her to a villa at 24 Nikolaevskaya, Gatchina, nearer to his base at the Gatchina Palace.

==Third marriage==

Just as they had done for the previous two years, in summer 1912, Michael and Natalia holidayed in Western Europe. After shaking off agents of Nicholas II&#x27;s secret police, the Okhrana, Michael and Natalia married in Vienna on 16 October 1912 in a Serbian Orthodox Church. They had successfully planned the wedding without either Nicholas II&#x27;s or the Okhrana&#x27;s knowledge. On their eventual arrival in Cannes, after a few days travelling through Venice and Milan, Natalia&#x27;s two children joined them from Russia. The Grand Duke wrote to his brother, the Tsar, to inform him of the marriage, but because Natalia was divorced and not of royal blood the Tsar refused to approve it. Michael was perceived by the court as being &quot;under the hypnotic influence of a malicious vamp&quot;. Nicholas II said Natalia was &quot;such a cunning, wicked beast that it&#x27;s disgusting even to talk about her&quot;. Michael was removed from the imperial succession, his property was put under sequestration and exiled from Russia in disgrace. Though members of society felt some sympathy for Michael, thinking his punishment severe, there was little sympathy for Natalia. Despite marrying a Grand Duke, she was not entitled to be known as &quot;Grand Duchess&quot;, and instead used the style &quot;Madame&quot; or &quot;Countess Brasova&quot;.

Until September 1913, they stayed in hotels throughout Europe, without any decrease in their standard of living. They met Michael&#x27;s sister Grand Duchess Xenia and cousin Grand Duke Andrew, and in July 1913, they saw Michael&#x27;s mother in London who told Natalia &quot;a few home truths&quot; according to Xenia&#x27;s diary. From September 1913, they leased an English country house, Knebworth, north of London. Natalia acted as hostess for any of their guests, which included her friend Chaliapin, the Ballets Russes, and the artist Serge Sudeikin. As a divorcée, however, Natalia was often excluded from invitations to social events elsewhere; the divorced were not received at court and could not enter the Royal Enclosure at Ascot.

==War==

Upon the outbreak of World War I, Michael requested Nicholas II&#x27;s permission to return home and to the army, with the understanding his wife and children could accompany him. Nicholas agreed and the family returned to the house on Nikolaevskaya street; Natalia was still not permitted to live in any of the imperial palaces. Michael was appointed to the rank of major-general, and given command of the &quot;Savage Division&quot; (Дикая Дивизия) formed from Chechens, Ingushes and Daghestani. The post was perceived as a relatively low position in the Army, and was believed to be Nicholas II&#x27;s punishment for Michael&#x27;s marriage.

As was expected of women in the imperial family, Natalia founded two hospitals for wounded soldiers and officers, one at Gatchina and one at Saint Petersburg, in properties owned by Michael. In January 1915, her sister Olga died in Moscow, and she went there for the funeral. In February 1915, her eldest sister Vera also died.

At her hotel in Moscow, Michael&#x27;s cousin Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia declared that he was in love with her. Natalia referred to Dmitri as &quot;Lily-of-the-Valley&quot;. Dmitri had a reputation as a rake, though Natalia was flattered, she turned him down and told her husband of the encounter. Michael was jealous about Natalia&#x27;s feelings for Dmitri: &quot;What you are writing to me about Lily-of-the-Valley, i.e., how tenderly, tenderly you love him and also that he comes to see you because he likes you and totally succumbed to your charm and besides, you say that conquering such a heart means much to you—I believe that if you just stop to consider the meaning of these several sentences you have written, you will realise what pain you have given me by writing them.&quot; Natalia told Michael, &quot;Believe me, my affection for him does not in the least interfere with my love for you.&quot;

In March 1915, Nicholas II agreed to legitimise George, and grant him the style of Count Brasov, although George still held no claim to the throne. While George was recognized as a count of the Empire, it appears that no such dignity was accorded Natalia. Natalia&#x27;s social circle expanded as more people began to accept her. As the war began to go badly for the Russians, Natalia was dismayed by the change in Michael&#x27;s appearance as he abandoned his smart uniforms and decorations and wore a plain uniform with his muddy boots. Michael was &quot;deeply upset&quot; by Natalia&#x27;s criticisms of his decision to be in the frontline of the war. He wrote to her, &quot;the present time is so hard for Russia that my conscience could not allow me &quot;not&quot; to join the frontline service – and I am convinced that having done that, I also brought you some good in terms of public opinion, which, unfortunately, we can&#x27;t totally ignore.&quot;

Natalia&#x27;s social circle widened to include deputies in the Duma, and she was perceived as a liberal who supported a constitutional monarchy rather than the Tsar&#x27;s autocracy. The Tsarina, Alexandra, even feared that Natalia was conspiring to make Michael Emperor. The Tsarina and Dowager Empress still would not accept Natalia. A portrait of her in a Kiev hospital she had funded with her own money was hidden by hospital staff for a visit by the Dowager Empress, and Alexandra had an exhibition of photographs of Michael and Natalia cleared by the imperial police. Natalia was depressed by the snubs, and by her separation from Michael, who was still at the front. In September 1916, they reunited at Mogilev, and spent time at Brasovo and Gatchina for the next six weeks, until Michael fell ill with stomach ulcers. They moved to the Crimea for Michael&#x27;s recuperation. Christmas 1916 was spent at Brasovo as a family, where Natalia&#x27;s daughter was &quot;thrilled to the core&quot; to hear that Dimitri had helped murder Rasputin, Tsarina Alexandra&#x27;s self-styled spiritual mentor.

==Revolution==
After the February Revolution in 1917, Nicholas abdicated in Michael&#x27;s favour, but Michael refused to accept the throne until ratified by the will of the people through the Constituent Assembly. By naming Michael as his successor, Nicholas effectively reversed the long-standing law that morganatically married dynasts forfeited rights of succession, but his actions were ultimately irrelevant. Power lay with the revolutionaries, not with the Tsar, whether it was Nicholas or Michael. Michael and his family were placed under house arrest in Gatchina.

In September 1917, the house arrest was lifted. At the end of the following month the Prime Minister, Alexander Kerensky, was deposed in the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks seized power. With a permit to travel issued by Peter Polotsov, a former army colleague of Michael&#x27;s who held a command in Saint Petersburg, the family planned to move to the greater safety of Finland. Valuables were packed and the children were moved to an estate south of Gatchina owned by Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov, the brother of one of Natalia&#x27;s closest friends (Nadine Vonlyarlarskaya) and the father of the famous writer, Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov. The Bolsheviks discovered their plan, however, and their escape was blocked. The children returned to Gatchina, and they were once again under house arrest. Natalia managed to gain access to her safety deposit box, by claiming that she needed to examine some papers at the bank, and thus retrieved as much of her jewellery as she could conceal without arousing suspicion. The house arrest was lifted in November, but on 7 March 1918 Michael and Nicholas Johnson—who had been his secretary since December 1912—were re-arrested on the orders of Moisei Uritsky, the Head of the Petrograd secret police. They were imprisoned at Bolshevik headquarters in the Smolny Institute.

Natalia visited Michael the next two days, 8 and 9 March 1918, with their friend Princess Putyatina. On 9 March, she barged her way into Lenin&#x27;s office, which was in the same building, to remonstrate with him. In the evening, the Council of the People&#x27;s Commissars decided to send Michael and Johnson into internal exile. On 11 March, they were sent a thousand miles eastwards to the remote city of Perm.

Concerned for her entire family&#x27;s safety, Natalia made plans for the children to be taken abroad. With the help of the Danish embassy, which was next-door to Princess Puyatina&#x27;s apartment, George was smuggled out of the country to Denmark by his governess, Miss Margaret Neame. The Danes extended diplomatic protection to the villa in Gatchina by pretending to rent it and flying the Danish flag over the house. Natalia wanted to join Michael in Perm, and after repeated pleading received a travel permit to join him. They spent about a week together, until an army of disgruntled Czechs advanced on Perm. The Bolsheviks had attempted to ship prisoners-of-war from Austria-Hungary out of Russia, ethnic Czech troops amongst them. The Czechs, however, were not going home to fight once more for the Austrian empire, but to fight for a separate independent homeland. The Germans demanded that the Bolsheviks disarm the Czechs, with the result that the Czech forces joined with the White Army, fighting against the Bolsheviks. With the approach of the Czechs, Michael and Natalia feared that she would become trapped in Perm, possibly in a dangerous situation, and so on 18 May she left for Moscow.

In Moscow, Natalia continued to badger Bolshevik Commissars, including Lenin, Trotsky and Sverdlov, for Michael&#x27;s release, but to no avail. In June 1918, her husband and Johnson were shot by their captors on the outskirts of Perm. To cover their tracks, the Perm authorities distributed a concocted story that Michael was abducted by unidentified men and had disappeared. Natalia went to Uritsky in a quest for an explanation, but Uritsky ordered her arrest and incarceration. The Soviet disinformation about Michael&#x27;s disappearance led to unfounded rumours that he had escaped and was leading a successful counter-revolution. Natalia heard the rumours in prison, and chose to believe them. Ten weeks after her imprisonment, in early September, Natalia pretended that she had developed tuberculosis, and was moved to a nursing home. Once there, she escaped and took refuge in the apartment above her brother-in-law&#x27;s with family friend Princess Vyazemskaya. Uritsky had been murdered in late August, and the Bolsheviks were terrorising Petrograd in what was later called the Red Terror. Natalia&#x27;s daughter, &quot;Tata&quot;, was arrested and imprisoned, but released after a few days when it became apparent she had no knowledge of her mother&#x27;s whereabouts. With no money or food, &quot;Tata&quot; made her way to her uncle&#x27;s apartment, and so was fortuitously re-united with her mother.

==Exile==
The Germans believed the widespread rumours that Michael was still alive, and plotted to rescue Natalia from Russia in an attempt to gain influence with Michael. Through the German-controlled Ukrainian consulate, Natalia and her daughter were provided with false passports. Natalia&#x27;s daughter used her own name, while Natalia&#x27;s passport was in the name of a nun called Frau Tania Klenow. They travelled separately to Kyiv, with Natalia disguised as a nun. They were still in Kyiv when the war ended with Germany&#x27;s defeat on 11 November 1918. German authority began to collapse. Natalia and her daughter, along with Princess Vyazemskaya and Natalia&#x27;s widowed brother-in-law Aleksei Matveev, who had both made it to Kyiv as well, fled to Odessa in the hope they could escape by sea. Two British naval vessels at the port, HMS &quot;Nereide&quot; and HMS &quot;Skirmisher&quot;, provided them with sanctuary. Aboard HMS &quot;Nereide&quot; they were evacuated to Constantinople.

By way of HMS &quot;Agamemnon&quot; to Malta, merchant ship to Marseille, and rail to Paris, Natalia arrived in England. Johnson&#x27;s widowed mother had leased a house, Snape in Wadhurst, Sussex, for Michael&#x27;s family, and all the furniture and furnishings stored at Paddockhurst were moved in. George arrived from Copenhagen with his nanny in spring 1919, and was sent to an English boarding school. Natalia&#x27;s daughter, Natalia Mamontova, was enrolled at a convent school in France. For funds, Natalia used money in Michael&#x27;s bank accounts in Paris and Copenhagen, and started selling her jewellery. She met Michael&#x27;s mother, the Dowager Empress Marie, who had also escaped Russia, in London, and their meeting this time was courteous. Conflicting rumours about Michael&#x27;s fate and whereabouts continued without any solid news. In 1920, &quot;Tata&quot; was sent to Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College and George was enrolled at Harrow School. Natalia moved out of Snape as the lease ended, and moved to Percy Lodge near Richmond, Surrey.

On 12 August 1921, 18-year-old Natalia Mamontova married future BBC broadcaster Val Gielgud, against her mother&#x27;s wishes and without her foreknowledge. Natalia Mamontova was on school break and returned home as if nothing had happened. When Natalia found out, she ordered her daughter out of her house. Natalia left Percy Lodge and moved into an apartment in Kensington. The Gielguds divorced in 1923, and Natalia Mamontova married composer and music critic Cecil Gray.

By 1924, there was still no sign of Michael, and Natalia had him declared legally dead on 5 July 1924. She inherited his estate in Britain, which was valued at a mere £95. The following month, Michael&#x27;s cousin, Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich, declared himself Emperor on the basis that he had inherited the throne at the moment of the previous Emperor&#x27;s death, despite the abolition of the Russian monarchy by the communists. In 1928, he gave Natalia the title of Princess, followed in 1935 by the style &quot;Her Serene Highness Princess Romanovskaya-Brasova&quot;. He made George a Prince. Cyril&#x27;s claim to the throne was met with opposition from within the Romanov family because at his birth his mother was a Lutheran and not a member of the Russian Orthodox Church. Furthermore, Cyril had married Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who was a divorcée and his first cousin, without the Emperor&#x27;s consent. The House law that determined the Russian line of succession excluded princes born to non-Orthodox mothers, and princes who married without the Tsar&#x27;s consent. The Russian Orthodox Church did not recognise Victoria&#x27;s divorce from her first husband as valid, and did not permit marriage between first cousins. Cyril&#x27;s title, and by extension Natalia&#x27;s and George&#x27;s, were only recognised by Cyril&#x27;s supporters.

==Decline==

To save money, in 1927 Natalia moved to Paris where living costs were lower than in London. George joined her in France, but he was killed after a car accident in 1931. She was at his bedside when he died, though he had not regained consciousness after the crash. She was emotionally devastated. Natalia&#x27;s granddaughter, Pauline Gray, was born in 1929, but the Grays&#x27; marriage also ended in divorce. Natalia Mamontova&#x27;s third and last marriage was to naval officer Michael Majolier, with whom she had a second daughter, Alexandra, born in 1934.

Natalia continued attempts to recover Michael&#x27;s assets. The Polish government had seized Michael&#x27;s Polish estate, and Natalia sued them for its return or compensation. By the Peace of Riga, the Poles were entitled to any imperial property in the former Russian Poland, but Natalia pointed out that Michael was already dead before the Peace, and so any of Michael&#x27;s property in Poland was legally hers, as a commoner. In 1937, the court ruled against her. In 1938, she did receive a pay-out from the German courts, when the Tsar&#x27;s estate in Germany was shared between all his heirs, but hyper-inflation had reduced its value. She continued to sell anything she could in a desperate attempt to raise cash.

During World War II, Natalia and her daughter were separated as Natalia lived in Paris, and her daughter was in Britain. They were unable to communicate with each other until after the war, by which time Natalia was penniless and lived as a refugee in an attic box-room. On 23 January 1952, she died of cancer at the Laënnec charity hospital in Paris in complete poverty, and was buried in Passy Cemetery (Section 9, near the intersection with the outer wall and Section 8) in Paris beside her son George, Count Brasov.

<text>Computer display standards are a combination of aspect ratio, display size, display resolution, color depth, and refresh rate. They are associated with specific expansion cards, video connectors, and monitors. 

==History==

Various computer display standards or display modes have been used in the history of the personal computer. They are often a combination of aspect ratio (specified as width-to-height ratio), display resolution (specified as the width and height in pixels), color depth (measured in bits per pixel), and refresh rate (expressed in hertz). Associated with the screen resolution and refresh rate is a display adapter. Earlier display adapters were simple frame-buffers, but later display standards also specified a more extensive set of display functions and software controlled interface.

Beyond display modes, the VESA industry organization has defined several standards related to power management and device identification, while ergonomics standards are set by the TCO.

==Standards==
A number of common resolutions have been used with computers descended from the original IBM PC. Some of these are now supported by other families of personal computers. These are de facto standards, usually originated by one manufacturer and reverse-engineered by others, though the VESA group has co-ordinated the efforts of several leading video display adapter manufacturers. Video &quot;standards&quot; associated with IBM-PC-descended personal computers are shown in the diagram and table below, alongside those of early Macintosh and other makes for comparison. (From the early 1990s onwards, most manufacturers moved over to PC display standards thanks to widely available and affordable hardware).

==Display resolution prefixes==
Although the common standard prefixes &quot;super&quot; and &quot;ultra&quot; do not indicate specific modifiers to base standard resolutions, several others do:
;Quarter (Q or q)
:A quarter of the base resolution. E.g. QVGA, a term for a 320×240 resolution, half the width and height of VGA, hence the quarter total resolution. The &quot;Q&quot; prefix usually indicates &quot;Quad&quot; (4 times as many, not 1/4 times as many) in higher resolutions, and sometimes &quot;q&quot; is used instead of &quot;Q&quot; to specify &quot;quarter&quot; (by analogy with SI prefixes m/M), but this usage is not consistent.
;Wide (W)
:The base resolution increased by increasing the width and keeping the height constant, for square or near-square pixels on a widescreen display, usually with an aspect ratio of either 16:9 (adding an extra 1/3rd width vs a standard 4:3 display) or 16:10 (adding an extra 1/5th). However, it is sometimes used to denote a resolution that would have roughly the same total pixel count as this, but in a different aspect and sharing neither the horizontal OR vertical resolution—typically for a 16:10 resolution which is narrower but taller than the 16:9 option, and therefore larger in both dimensions than the base standard (e.g., compare 1366×768 and 1280×800, both commonly labelled as &quot;WXGA&quot;, vs the base 1024×768 &quot;XGA&quot;).
;Quad(ruple) (Q)
:Four times as many pixels compared to the base resolution, i.e. twice the horizontal and vertical resolution respectively.
;Hex(adecatuple) (H)
:Sixteen times as many pixels compared to the base resolution, i.e. four times the horizontal and vertical resolutions respectively.
;Super (S), eXtended (X), Plus (+) and/or Ultra (U)
:Vaguer terms denoting successive incremental steps up the resolution ladder from some comparative, more established base, usually somewhat less severe a jump than quartering or Quadrupling—typically less than doubling, and sometimes not even as much of a change as making a &quot;wide&quot; version; for example SVGA (800×600 vs 640×480), SXGA (1280×1024 vs 1024×768), SXGA+ (1400×1050 vs 1280×1024) and UXGA (1600×1200 vs 1024×768 - or more fittingly, vs the 1280×1024 of SXGA, the conceptual &quot;next step down&quot; at the time of UXGA&#x27;s inception, or the 1400×1050 of SXGA+). Given the use of &quot;X&quot; in &quot;XGA&quot;, it is not often used as an additional modifier (e.g. there is no such thing as XVGA except as an alternative designation for SXGA) unless its meaning would be unambiguous.

These prefixes are also often combined, as in WQXGA or WHUXGA, with levels of stacking not hindered by the same consideration towards readability as the decline of the added &quot;X&quot; - especially as there is not even a defined hierarchy or value for S/X/U/+ modifiers.

<text>Video Graphics Array (VGA) is a video display controller and accompanying de facto graphics standard, first introduced with the IBM PS/2 line of computers in 1987, which became ubiquitous in the IBM PC compatible industry within three years. The term can now refer to the computer display standard, the 15-pin D-subminiature VGA connector, or the resolution characteristic of the VGA hardware.

VGA was the last IBM graphics standard to which the majority of IBM PC compatible computer manufacturers conformed, making it the lowest common denominator that virtually all post-1990 PC graphics hardware can be expected to implement.

VGA was adapted into many extended forms by third parties, collectively known as Super VGA, then gave way to custom graphics processing units which, in addition to their proprietary interfaces and capabilities, continue to implement common VGA graphics modes and interfaces to the present day.

The VGA analog interface standard has been extended to support resolutions of up to for general usage, with specialized applications improving it further still.

== Hardware design ==
The color palette random access memory (RAM) and its corresponding digital-to-analog converter (DAC) were integrated into one chip (the RAMDAC) and the cathode-ray tube controller (CRTC) was integrated into a main VGA chip, which eliminated several other chips in previous graphics adapters, so VGA only additionally required external video RAM and timing crystals.

This small part count allowed IBM to include VGA directly on the PS/2 motherboard, in contrast to prior IBM PC modelsPC, PC/XT, and PC ATwhich required a separate display adapter installed in a slot in order to connect a monitor. The term &quot;array&quot; rather than &quot;adapter&quot; in the name denoted that it was not a complete independent expansion device, but a single component that could be integrated into a system.

Unlike the graphics adapters that preceded it (MDA, CGA, EGA and many third-party options) there was initially no discrete VGA card released by IBM. The first commercial implementation of VGA was a built-in component of the IBM PS/2, in which it was accompanied by 256 KB of video RAM, and a new DE-15 connector replacing the DE-9 used by previous graphics adapters. IBM later released the standalone &quot;IBM PS/2 Display Adapter&quot;, which utilized the VGA but could be added to machines that did not have it built in.

==Capabilities==

The VGA supports all graphics modes supported by the MDA, CGA and EGA cards, as well as multiple new modes.

===Standard graphics modes===
* in 4 or 16 colors (CGA/EGA compatibility)
* in 256 colors (Mode 13h)
* and in 16 colors or monochrome (CGA/EGA compatibility)
* in 16 colors or monochrome

The 16-color and 256-color modes had fully redefinable palettes, with each entry selected from an 18-bit (262,144-color) gamut.

The other modes defaulted to standard EGA or CGA compatible palettes and instructions, but still permitted remapping of the palette with VGA-specific commands.

==== graphics mode ====
The resolution (at 256 colors rather than 16) was originally used by IBM in PGC graphics (which VGA offers no backward compatibility for) but did not see wide adoption until VGA was introduced. As the VGA began to be cloned in great quantities by manufacturers who added ever-increasing capabilities, its , 16-color mode became the de facto lowest common denominator of graphics cards. By the mid 1990s, a ×16 graphics mode using the VGA memory and register specifications was expected by operating systems such as Windows 95 and OS/2 Warp 3.0, which provided no support for lower resolutions or bit depths, or support for other memory or register layouts without additional drivers. Well into the 2000s, even after the VESA standard for graphics cards became commonplace, the &quot;VGA&quot; graphics mode remained a compatibility option for PC operating systems.

====Other graphics modes====
Nonstandard display modes can be implemented, with horizontal resolutions of:

*512 to 800 pixels wide, in 16 colors
*256 to 400 pixels wide, in 256 colors
And heights of:
*200, or 350 to 410 lines (including 400-line) at 70 Hz refresh rate, or
*224 to 256, or 448 to 512 lines (including 240 or 480-line) at 60 Hz refresh rate
*512 to 600 lines at reduced vertical refresh rates (down to 50 Hz, and including e.g. 528, 544, 552, 560, 576-line), depending on individual monitor compatibility.
For example, high resolution modes with square pixels are available at or in 16 colors, or medium-low resolution at with 256 colors. Alternatively, extended resolution is available with &quot;fat&quot; pixels and 256 colors using, e.g. (50 Hz) or (60 Hz), and &quot;thin&quot; pixels, 16 colors and the 70 Hz refresh rate with e.g. mode.

&quot;Narrow&quot; modes such as tend to preserve the same pixel ratio as in e.g. mode unless the monitor is adjusted to stretch the image out to fill the screen, as they are derived simply by masking down the wider mode instead of altering pixel or line timings, but can be useful for reducing memory requirements and pixel addressing calculations for arcade game conversions or console emulators.

The PC version of Pinball Fantasies has the option to use non-standard modes &quot;high res&quot; modes, such as , allowing it to display a larger portion of the pinball table on screen.

===Standard text modes===

VGA also implements several text modes:

*, rendered with a pixel font, with an effective resolution of 
*, with a font, with an effective resolution of 
* or , with an font grid, with an effective resolution of or pixels.

As with the pixel-based graphics modes, additional text modes are possible by programming the VGA correctly, with an overall maximum of about cells and an active area spanning about cells.

One variant that is sometimes seen is or , using an or font and an effective pixel display, which trades use of the more flickery 60 Hz mode for an additional 5 or 10 lines of text and square character blocks (or, at , square half-blocks).

==Technical details==
Unlike the cards that preceded it, which used binary TTL signals to interface with a monitor (and also composite, in the case of the CGA), the VGA introduced a video interface using pure analog RGB signals, with a range of 0.7 volts peak-to-peak max. In conjunction with a 18-bit RAMDAC (6-bit per RGB channel), this produced a color gamut of 262,144 colors.

The original VGA specifications follow:

*Selectable 25.175 MHz or 28.322 MHz master pixel clock
*Maximum of 640 horizontal pixels in graphics mode, and 720 pixels in text mode
*Maximum of 480 lines
*Refresh rates at 60 or 70 Hz
*Vertical blank interrupt 
*Planar mode: up to 16 colors 
*Packed-pixel mode: 256 colors 
*Hardware smooth scrolling support
*No Blitter
**Supports fast data transfers via &quot;VGA latch&quot; registers
*Barrel shifter
*Split screen support

===Signal timings===
The intended standard value for the horizontal frequency of VGA&#x27;s mode is exactly double the value used in the NTSC-M video system, as this made it much easier to offer optional TV-out solutions or external VGA-to-TV converter boxes at the time of VGA&#x27;s development. It is also at least nominally twice that of CGA, which also supported composite monitors.

All &quot;derived&quot; VGA timings (i.e. those which use the master 25.175 and 28.322 MHz crystals and, to a lesser extent, the nominal 31.469 kHz line rate) can be varied by software that bypasses the VGA firmware interface and communicates directly with the VGA hardware, as many MS-DOS based games did. However, only the standard modes, or modes that at least use almost exactly the same H-sync and V-sync timings as one of the standard modes, can be expected to work with the original late-1980s and early-1990s VGA monitors. The use of other timings may in fact damage such monitors and thus was usually avoided by software publishers.

Third-party &quot;multisync&quot; CRT monitors were more flexible, and in combination with &quot;super EGA&quot;, VGA, and later SVGA graphics cards using extended modes, could display a much wider range of resolutions and refresh rates at arbitrary sync frequencies and pixel clock rates.

For the most common VGA mode (, 60 Hz, non-interlaced), the horizontal timings can be found in the HP Super VGA Display Installation Guide and in other places.

===Typical uses of selected modes===
 @ 70 Hz is traditionally the video mode used for booting VGA-compatible x86 personal computers that show a graphical boot screen, while text-mode boot uses @ 70 Hz.

This convention has been eroded in recent years, however, with POST and BIOS screens moving to higher resolutions, taking advantage of EDID data to match the resolution to a connected monitor.

 @ 60 Hz is the default Windows graphics mode (usually with 16 colors), up to Windows 2000. It remains an option in XP via the boot menu &quot;low resolution video&quot; option and per-application compatibility mode settings, despite newer versions of Windows now defaulting to and generally not allowing any resolution below to be set.

The need for such a low-quality, universally compatible fallback has diminished since the turn of the millennium, 

 at 70 Hz was the most common mode for early 1990s PC games, with pixel-doubling and line-doubling performed in hardware to present a at 70 Hz signal to the monitor.

The Windows 95/98/Me LOGO.SYS boot-up image was 320 × 400 resolution, displayed with pixel-doubling to present a at 70 Hz signal to the monitor. The 400-line signal was the same as the standard text mode, which meant that pressing to return to text mode didn&#x27;t change the frequency of the video signal, and thus the monitor did not have to resynchronize (which could otherwise have taken several seconds).

==Connector==


The standard VGA monitor interface is a 15-pin D-subminiature connector in the &quot;E&quot; shell, variously referred to as &quot;DE-15&quot;, &quot;HD-15&quot; and erroneously &quot;DB-15(HD)&quot;.

All VGA connectors carry analog RGBHV (red, green, blue, horizontal sync, vertical sync) video signals. Modern connectors also include VESA DDC pins, for identifying attached display devices.

Because VGA uses low-voltage analog signals, signal degradation becomes a factor with low-quality or overly long cables. Solutions include shielded cables, cables that include a separate internal coaxial cable for each color signal, and &quot;broken out&quot; cables utilizing a separate coaxial cable with a BNC connector for each color signal.

BNC breakout cables typically use five connectors, one each for Red, Green, Blue, Horizontal Sync, and Vertical Sync, and do not include the other signal lines of the VGA interface. With BNC, the coaxial wires are fully shielded end-to-end and through the interconnect so that virtually no crosstalk and very little external interference can occur. The use of BNC RGB video cables predates VGA in other markets and industries.

==Color palette==


The VGA color system uses register-based palettes to map colors in various bit depths to its 18-bit output gamut. It is backward compatible with the EGA and CGA adapters, but supports extra bit depth for the palette when in these modes.

For instance, when in EGA 16-color modes, VGA offers 16 palette registers, and in 256-color modes, it offers 256 registers. Each palette register contain a 3×6 bit RGB value, selecting a color from the 18-bit gamut of the DAC.

These color registers are initialized to default values IBM expected to be most useful for each mode. For instance, EGA 16-color modes initialize to the default CGA 16-color palette, and the 256-color mode initializes to a palette consisting of 16 CGA colors, 16 grey shades, and then 216 colors chosen by IBM to fit expected use cases.
After initialization they can be redefined at any time without altering the contents of video RAM, permitting palette cycling.

In the 256-color modes, the DAC is set to combine four 2-bit color values, one from each plane, into an 8-bit-value representing an index into the 256-color palette. The CPU interface combines the 4 planes in the same way, a feature called &quot;chain-4&quot;, so that each pixel appears to the CPU as a packed 8-bit value representing the palette index.
==Use==
The video memory of the VGA is mapped to the PC&#x27;s memory via a window in the range between segments 0xA0000 and 0xBFFFF in the PC&#x27;s real mode address space (A000:0000 and B000:FFFF in segment:offset notation). Typically, these starting segments are:

* 0xA0000 for EGA/VGA graphics modes (64 KB)
* 0xB0000 for monochrome text mode (32 KB)
* 0xB8000 for color text mode and CGA-compatible graphics modes (32 KB)

A typical VGA card is also provide this port-mapped I/O segment:

* 0x3B0 to 0x3DF

Due to the use of different address mappings for different modes, it is possible to have a monochrome adapter (i.e. MDA or Hercules) and a color adapter such as the VGA, EGA, or CGA installed in the same machine.

At the beginning of the 1980s, this was typically used to display Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheets in high-resolution text on a monochrome display and associated graphics on a low-resolution CGA display simultaneously. Many programmers also used such a setup with the monochrome card displaying debugging information while a program ran in graphics mode on the other card. Several debuggers, like Borland&#x27;s Turbo Debugger, D86 and Microsoft&#x27;s CodeView could work in a dual monitor setup. Either Turbo Debugger or CodeView could be used to debug Windows.

There were also device drivers such as codice_1, which implemented a serial interface simulation on the monochrome display and, for example, allowed the user to receive crash messages from debugging versions of Windows without using an actual serial terminal.

It is also possible to use the &quot;MODE MONO&quot; command at the command prompt to redirect the output to the monochrome display. When a monochrome adapter was not present, it was possible to use the 0xB000–0xB7FF address space as additional memory for other programs.

A VGA-capable PCI / PCIe graphics card can provide legacy VGA registers in its PCI configuration space, which may be remapped by BIOS or operating system.

=== Programming ===

&quot;Unchaining&quot; the 256 KB VGA memory into four separate &quot;planes&quot; makes VGA&#x27;s 256 KB of RAM available in 256-color modes. There is a trade-off for extra complexity and performance loss in some types of graphics operations, but this is mitigated by other operations becoming faster in certain situations:

*Single-color polygon filling could be accelerated due to the ability to set four pixels with a single write to the hardware.
*The video adapter could assist in copying video RAM regions, which was sometimes faster than doing this with the relatively slow CPU-to-VGA interface.
*The use of multiple video pages in hardware allowed double buffering, triple buffering or split screens, which, while available in VGA&#x27;s 16-color mode, was not possible using stock Mode 13h.
*Most particularly, several higher, arbitrary-resolution display modes were possible, all the way up to the programmable limit of with 16 colors (or with 256 colors), as well as other custom modes using unusual combinations of horizontal and vertical pixel counts in either color mode.

Software such as Fractint, Xlib and ColoRIX also supported tweaked 256-color modes on standard adaptors using freely-combinable widths of 256, 320, and 360 pixels and heights of 200, 240 and 256 (or 400, 480 and 512) lines, extending still further to 384 or 400 pixel columns and 576 or 600 (or 288, 300). However, was the best known and most frequently used, as it offered a standard 40-column resolution and 4:3 aspect ratio with square pixels. &quot; × 8&quot; resolution was commonly called Mode X, the name used by Michael Abrash when he presented the resolution in Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal.

The highest resolution modes were only used in special, opt-in cases rather than as standard, especially where high line counts were involved. Standard VGA monitors had a fixed line scan (H-scan) rate&quot;multisync&quot; monitors being, at the time, expensive raritiesand so the vertical/frame (V-scan) refresh rate had to be reduced in order to accommodate them, which increased visible flicker and thus eye strain. For example, the highest mode, being otherwise based on the matching SVGA resolution (with 628 total lines), reduced the refresh rate from 60 Hz to about 50 Hz (and , the theoretical maximum resolution achievable with 256 KB at 16 colors, would have reduced it to about 48 Hz, barely higher than the rate at which XGA monitors employed a double-frequency interlacing technique to mitigate full-frame flicker).

These modes were also outright incompatible with some monitors, producing display problems such as picture detail disappearing into overscan (especially in the horizontal dimension), vertical roll, poor horizontal sync or even a complete lack of picture depending on the exact mode attempted. Due to these potential issues, most VGA tweaks used in commercial products were limited to more standards-compliant, &quot;monitor-safe&quot; combinations, such as (square pixels, three video pages, 60 Hz), (double resolution, two video pages, 70 Hz), and (highest resolution compatible with both standard VGA monitors and cards, one video page, 60 Hz) in 256 colors, or double the horizontal resolution in 16-color mode.

==Successors==
===Super VGA (SVGA)===

Super VGA (SVGA) is a display standard developed in 1988, when NEC Home Electronics announced its creation of the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). The development of SVGA was led by NEC, along with other VESA members including ATI Technologies and Western Digital. SVGA enabled graphics display resolutions up to 800 × 600 pixels, 56% more than VGA&#x27;s maximum resolution of 640 × 480 pixels.

===Extended Graphics Array (XGA)===
Extended Graphics Array (XGA) is an IBM display standard introduced in 1990. Later it became the most common appellation of the 1024 × 768 pixels display resolution.

<text>The Sulu Archipelago (Tausug: , Jawi: , ) is a chain of islands in the Pacific Ocean, in the southwestern Philippines. The archipelago forms the northern limit of the Celebes Sea and southern limit of the Sulu Sea. The Sulu Archipelago islands are within the Mindanao island group, consisting of the Philippines provinces of Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi; hence the archipelago is sometimes referred to as Basulta, derived from the first syllables of the three provinces.

The archipelago is not, as is often supposed, the remains of a land bridge between Borneo and the Philippines. Rather, it is the exposed edge of small submarine ridges produced by tectonic tilting of the sea bottom. Basilan, Jolo, Tawi-Tawi and other islands in the group are extinct volcanic cones rising from the southernmost ridge. Tawi-Tawi, the southernmost island of the group, has a serpentine basement-complex core with a limestone covering. This island chain is an important migration route for birds.

The largest municipalities in the area are on the island of Jolo. The larger island of Palawan to its north, the coastal regions of the westward-extending Zamboanga Peninsula of Mindanao, and the north-eastern part of the island of Borneo were formerly parts of the thalassocratic Sultanate of Sulu.

The archipelago is the home of the indigenous Tausug people; various group of Samal (or Sama) people including the semi-nomadic Badjaw; the land-based Sama; the related Yakan people; and the Jama Mapun people. The Tausug language is spoken widely in the Sulu Archipelago as both first and second languages throughout these islands. The Yakan language is spoken mainly in Basilan Island. Numerous dialects of Sinama are spoken throughout the archipelago, from the Tawi-Tawi Island group, to the Mapun island group (Mapun), to the coast of Mindanao and beyond.

==Geography==
The archipelago is geographically subdivided into several groups, most significantly those around the main islands Basilan, Jolo and Tawi-Tawi. There are, however, other groups containing mostly small islands; not all of these are inhabited:

==History==
The Sulu Archipelago was once part of Majapahit Empire and mentioned in the Old Javanese eulogy of Nagarakretagama by the name &quot;Solot&quot;. After that, it became part of the Bruneian Empire before gaining its own independence on 1578. Many Tausugs and other native Muslims of Sulu Archipelago already interacted with Kapampangan and Tagalog Muslims called Luzones based in Brunei, and there were intermarriages between them.

The region then became part of the independent Sultanate of Sulu, founded in 1405. The arrival of Western powers later became a conflict when the Spanish start to impose the rule of Spanish East Indies over the Sulu Archipelago. Spanish military expeditions against the sultanate were launched over the centuries of the colonial Philippines period (1565–1946). The Moro Rebellion (1899–1913) independence movement continued the Islamic Moro conflict, against the United States occupation in areas of the Moro people in the archipelago and southwestern Philippines.

===1405–1844: Sulu Sultanate and Spanish East Indies===
The Sulu Archipelago was part of the Islamic Sultanate of Sulu, founded in 1405 by Shari’ful Hashem Syed Abu Bak’r. The sultanate also included portions of Borneo, Mindanao, Palawan, and other islands in the region.

From the first Spanish encounters with Jolo island, the Spanish–Moro conflict met firm and organised resistance from the Sultanate of Sulu. Miguel López de Legazpi had established a colony in Cebu in May 1565, however the initial focus of the Spanish conquest to establish the Spanish East Indies was northwards. In June 1578 Francisco de Sande, Governor-General of the Spanish East Indies, dispatched captain Esteban Rodríguez de Figueroa and the Jesuit priest Juan del Campo and the coadjutor Gaspar Gómez to Jolo, resulting in a negotiated compromise where the Sulu sultan paid a regular tribute in pearls. The following year, Figueroa was awarded the sole right to colonise Mindanao. In 1587, during a campaign against Borneo launched by Sande, Figueroa attacked and burned down Jolo. The Spaniards left Jolo after a few days.

The Joloanos resolved to resist Spanish intrusions. In response to attacks, Joloanos raided Spanish settlements and reducciones. In 1593, the first permanent Roman Catholic mission was established on the Zamboanga Peninsula, and three years later, the Spanish Army launched another attack on Jolo, which was repelled by the army of Rajah Bongsu. In November 1593, the Spanish Empire sent Juan Ronquillo to Tampakan to thwart the slave raiders. The following year, the Spanish Army troops relocated to Caldera Bay (Recodo), Mindanao. In 1598, another expedition was launched against Jolo, but was repelled by the Joloanos. In late 1600, Captain Juan Gallinato with a group of about 200 Spanish soldiers attacked Jolo but were unsuccessful. By 1601, after three months of heavy fighting, the Spanish troops retreated. In 1628, a larger raiding force of about 200 Spanish army officers and 1,600 soldiers was organised to attack Jolo to defeat the Moslem slave raiders and traders, but the Spanish again failed to take Jolo. Again on 17 March 1630, a large Spanish force of 2,500 soldiers attacked Jolo but to no avail. When its commander Lorenzo de Olazo was wounded, the Spaniards retreated.
On 4 January 1638, Governor Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera led a naval and military expedition of about 80 ships and 2,000 troops to attack Jolo, but Sultan Wasit put up stiff resistance. However, Sultan Wasit&#x27;s kuta army suffered a serious epidemic of tropical disease and he and his chieftains sought refuge in the Dungun area of Tawi-Tawi. The Spanish Army easily occupied Jolo, and a small garrison was left there to control the area. The garrison was withered away by frequent raids launched by Sultan Wasit, and by 1645, this garrison had been wasted away. This was the first time that Jolo had been occupied by the Spaniards for an appreciable length of time. From 1663 to 1718, an interregnum of peace occurred because the Spanish troops were ordered to abandon the Zamboanga Peninsula, and forts south of thatand regroup in Manila to prepare for the impending attack of Koxingawhich never happened.
Hostilities resumed in the 18th century, triggered by the 1718 decision by governor Gen Juan Antonio dela Torre Bustamante to reconstruct the fort Real Fuerza de San José in Bagumbayan, Zamboanga. The fort was completed in 1719, renamed Real Fuerza del Pilar de Zaragosa (Fort Pilar is its popular name today), and inaugurated on 16 April. Three years later in 1722, the Spaniards launched another expedition against Jolo led by Andrés García; this expedition failed. In 1731, General Ignacio Iriberri lead a force of 1000 to Jolo and captured it after a lengthy siege, but the Spaniards again left after a few days. In 1755, a force of 1,900 Spanish soldiers led by the captains Simeón Valdez and Pedro Gastambide was sent to Jolo in revenge for the raids by Sultan Muiz ud-Din, but the Spaniards were defeated. In 1775, after a Moro raid on Zamboanga, Captain Vargas led a punitive expedition against Jolo, but his force was repulsed.
In the second half of the 18th century, Great Britain became a new player in the archipelago After occupying Manila from 1762 to 1764, during the Seven Years&#x27; War between Spain, Great Britain and other European powers, the British Army withdrew to the south and established trading alliances between the Sulu Sultanate and the British East India Company. During that time, Sulu Sultanate surrendered Basilan to Spain in 1762. Spanish attacks on Jolo were now directed at weakening British trading interests in the south. In 1784, Aguilar conducted a series of unsuccessful assaults against Jolo and in 1796, Spanish admiral José Alava was sent from Madrid with a powerful naval fleet to stop the slave-raiding attacks from the Sulu Sea. The British presence was signalled when in 1798, the British Royal Navy, which had established a base in Sulu, bombarded Fort Pilar in Zamboanga. In 1803, Lord Richard Wellesley, the Governor-General of India, ordered Robert J. Farquhar to transfer trading and military operations to Balambangan island near Borneo; the resulting outpost lasted only until 1806. By 1895, the Great Britain had withdrawn its army and navy from the Sulu Sea.

In 1815, the galleon trade across the Pacific Ocean between the Philippines and Mexico ended, since Mexico had declared its independence in 1810, and an extended war of independence was in progress. Most of the other Spanish-ruled areas of the Americas had also rebelled against their colonial masters. In 1821, the Philippine Islands were administered directly from Madrid, rather than via the Viceroy of Mexico, since Mexico and its southern neighbours had won their independence from Spain. The Spanish Empire sought to end the &quot;Moro threat&quot;. In 1824, the Marina Sutil, a light and manoeuvrable naval force under Capitan Alonso Morgado was sent to confront the slave raiders in the Sulu Sea.

===1844–1898: Spanish occupation===
In 1844, Governor General Narciso Claveria led yet another expedition against Jolo and in 1848, Claveria with powerful gunboats Magallanes, El Cano, and Reina de Castilla brought from Europe supervised the attack on the Balangingi stronghold in Tungkil. The raid resulted in the capture of many Sama Balangingi and the exile of many to the tobacco fields of Cagayan Valley. The leader of the Sama, Paglima Taupan, was not captured. With the fall of the Balangingi, a powerful ally of the Sulu Sultanate was decimated, beginning the decline of the sultanate&#x27;s maritime sea power. In 1850, Governor General Juan Urbiztondo continued with Claveria&#x27;s campaign and annihilated the remaining Balangingi strongholds at Tungkil. A raid on Jolo that year was a failure. On 28 February 1851, Urbiztondo launched another campaign against Jolo, razed the whole town and confiscated 112 pieces of artillery. The Spanish troops later withdrew. Also, in 1851, a peace treaty was signed between the Sulu Sultanate and the Spanish, though the terms were understood differently by each party.

In 1876, the Spanish launched a campaign to occupy Jolo. Spurred by their need to curb slave raiding, and concerned about other European colonial efforts in the region, the Spanish made a final bid to consolidate their rule in their southern frontier. The British had established trading centres in Jolo by the 19th century and the French were offering to purchase Basilan Island from the Spanish government. On 21 February 1876, the Spaniards assembled the largest contingent against Jolo, consisting of 9,000 soldiers in 11 transports, 11 gunboats, and 11 steamboats. Headed by Admiral Jose Malcampo, they captured Jolo and established a Spanish settlement.
Captain Pascual Cervera was appointed to set up a garrison and serve as military governor; he served from March 1876 to December 1876 followed by Jose Paulin (December 1876 – April 1877), Carlos Martinez (Sept 1877 – Feb 1880), Rafael de Rivera (1880–81), Isidro G. Soto (1881–82), Eduardo Bremon, (1882), Julian Parrado (1882–84), Francisco Castilla (1884–86), Juan Arolas (1886–93), Caesar Mattos (1893), Venancio Hernandez (1893–96), and Luis Huerta (1896–99).

The Spaniards were never secured in Jolo, and by 1878 they had fortified the town with a perimeter wall and tower gates, built inner forts called Puerta Blockaus, Puerta España, and Puerta Alfonso XII, and two outer fortifications named Princesa de Asturias and Torre de la Reina when Sultanate of Sulu formally recognised Spanish sovereignty on Sulu and Tawi-tawi in middle of 19th century, but these areas remained partially ruled by the Spanish as their sovereignty was limited to military stations and garrisons and pockets of civilian settlements. Troops, including a cavalry unit with its own lieutenant commander, were garrisoned within the protective walls. In 1880 Colonel Rafael Gonzales de Rivera, who was appointed by the Governor General, dispatched the 6th Regiment to Siasi and Bongao Islands.

The Spaniards&#x27; stronghold was sporadically attacked. On 22 July 1883, it was reported that three unnamed men had succeeded in penetrating Jolo&#x27;s town plaza and killed three Spaniards. The word “Ajuramentado” was coined by the Spanish colonel Juan Arolas after witnessing several such raids while serving with the Jolo garrison.

===1898–1946: American occupation===


In 1898, the war between Spain and America broke out. Commodore George Dewey of the US Navy defeated the Spanish fleet in the Battle of Manila Bay, following which the American army occupied Manila. The United States took possession of the Philippines under international law after the 1898 Treaty of Paris ended the war.

The Philippine–American War followed in 1898 for three months, during which the American military fought and defeated the Philippine forces under Emilio Aguinaldo for control of the Philippines.

After the Philippine–American War, the Moro Rebellion (1899–1913) independence movement continued the Spanish–Moro conflict, now against the United States occupation of the Philippines. The Sulu Archipelago was considered part of Islamic Moroland by the movement.

====World War II====

In December 1941, Japan attacked the United States in the Philippines and at Pearl Harbor, and the United States declared war on Japan as part of World War II. Japan conquered the Philippines in 1942, in the Philippines campaign (1941–1942). In 1944 the Allies&#x27; Philippines Campaign (1944–45) against the Japanese occupation began with the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Allied forces eventually drove the Japanese from the islands.

===1946–present: Philippine Independence===
On 4 July 1946, the Philippines became an independent nation. The fortifications of Jolo remained in good state during the American occupation when its walls, gates, and the buildings within it were photographed. Early 20th century photographs of Jolo show a well-ordered town, neatly laid out in a grid of streets and blocks—characteristics of Spanish urbanism applied with a military rigidity. In the postwar years the walls degraded.

Jolo suffered major destruction due to bombardment and fire during the military operations against the Moro Islamic independence forces in Jolo in 1973. , short stretches of degraded perimeter wall still exist, but are covered by buildings or are partially demolished to less than in height.

====Autonomy====

The archipelago was part of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao from 2006 until its abolition in 2008.

Bangsamoro, officially known as the Autonomous Government of Bangsamoro (Filipino: Nagsasariling Pamahalan ng Bangsamoro), is a proposed autonomous political entity within the Philippines. The proposal is part of the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro, a preliminary peace agreement signed between the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Philippine government.

<text>A canonical LR parser (also called a LR(1) parser) is a type of bottom-up parsing algorithm used in computer science to analyze and process programming languages. It is based on the LR parsing technique, which stands for &quot;left-to-right, rightmost derivation in reverse.&quot;

Formally, a canonical LR parser is an LR(k) parser for &quot;k=1&quot;, i.e. with a single lookahead terminal. The special attribute of this parser is that any LR(k) grammar with &quot;k&gt;1&quot; can be transformed into an LR(1) grammar. However, back-substitutions are required to reduce k and as back-substitutions increase, the grammar can quickly become large, repetitive and hard to understand. LR(k) can handle all deterministic context-free languages. In the past this LR(k) parser has been avoided because of its huge memory requirements in favor of less powerful alternatives such as the LALR and the LL(1) parser. Recently, however, a &quot;minimal LR(1) parser&quot; whose space requirements are close to LALR parsers, is being offered by several parser generators.

Like most parsers, the LR(1) parser is automatically generated by compiler-compilers like GNU Bison, MSTA, Menhir, HYACC, and LRSTAR.

== History ==
In 1965 Donald Knuth invented the LR(k) parser (Left to right, Rightmost derivation parser) a type of shift-reduce parser, as a generalization of existing precedence parsers. This parser has the potential of recognizing all deterministic context-free languages and can produce both left and right derivations of statements encountered in the input file. Knuth proved that it reaches its maximum language recognition power for k=1 and provided a method for transforming LR(k), k &gt; 1 grammars into LR(1) grammars.

Canonical LR(1) parsers have the practical disadvantage of having enormous memory requirements for their internal parser-table representation. In 1969, Frank DeRemer suggested two simplified versions of the LR parser called LALR and SLR. These parsers require much less memory than Canonical LR(1) parsers, but have slightly less language-recognition power. LALR(1) parsers have been the most common implementations of the LR Parser.

However, a new type of LR(1) parser, some people call a &quot;Minimal LR(1) parser&quot; was introduced in 1977 by David Pager who showed that LR(1) parsers can be created whose memory requirements rival those of LALR(1) parsers. Recently, some parser generators are offering Minimal LR(1) parsers, which not only solve the memory requirement problem, but also the mysterious-conflict-problem inherent in LALR(1) parser generators. In addition, Minimal LR(1) parsers can use shift-reduce actions, which makes them faster than Canonical LR(1) parsers.

== Overview ==
The LR(1) parser is a deterministic automaton and as such its operation is based on static state transition tables. These codify the grammar of the language it recognizes and are typically called &quot;parsing tables&quot;.

The parsing tables of the LR(1) parser are parameterized with a lookahead terminal. Simple parsing tables, like those used by the LR(0) parser represent grammar rules of the form

: A1 → A B

which means that if we go have input &quot;A&quot; followed by &quot;B&quot; then we will reduce the pair to &quot;A1&quot; regardless of what follows. After parameterizing such a rule with a lookahead we have:

: A1 → A B, a

which means that the reduction will now be performed only if the lookahead terminal is &quot;a&quot;. This allows for richer languages where a simple rule can have different meanings depending on the lookahead context. For example, in a LR(1) grammar, all of the following rules perform a different reduction in spite of being based on the same state sequence.

: A1 → A B, a
: A2 → A B, b
: A3 → A B, c
: A4 → A B, d

The same would not be true if a lookahead terminal was not being taken into account. Parsing errors can be identified without the parser having to read the whole input by declaring some rules as errors. For example,

: E1 → B C, d

can be declared an error, causing the parser to stop. This means that the lookahead information can also be used to catch errors, as in the following example:

: A1 → A B, a
: A1 → A B, b
: A1 → A B, c
: E1 → A B, d

In this case A B will be reduced to A1 when the lookahead is a, b or c and an error will be reported when the lookahead is d.

The lookahead can also be helpful in deciding when to reduce a rule. The lookahead can help avoid reducing a specific rule if the lookahead is not valid, which would probably mean that the current state should be combined with the following instead of the previous state. That means in the following example

* Input sequence: A B C
* Rules:
:: A1 → A B
:: A2 → B C

the sequence can be reduced to

: A A2

instead of

: A1 C

if the lookahead after the parser went to state B wasn&#x27;t acceptable, i.e. no transition rule existed. Reductions can be produced directly from a terminal as in

: X → y

which allows for multiple sequences to appear.

LR(1) parsers have the requirement that each rule should be expressed in a complete LR(1) manner, i.e. a sequence of two states with a specific lookahead. That makes simple rules such as

: X → y

requiring a great many artificial rules that essentially enumerate the combinations of all the possible states and lookahead terminals that can follow. A similar problem appears for implementing non-lookahead rules such as

: A1 → A B

where all the possible lookaheads must be enumerated. That is the reason why LR(1) parsers cannot be practically implemented without significant memory optimizations.

== Constructing LR(1) parsing tables ==
LR(1) parsing tables are constructed in the same way as LR(0) parsing tables with the modification that each Item contains a lookahead terminal. This means, contrary to LR(0) parsers, a different action may be executed, if the item to process is followed by a different terminal.

=== Parser items ===
Starting from the production rules of a language, at first the item sets for this language have to be determined. In plain words, an item set is the list of production rules, which the currently processed symbol might be part of. An item set has a one-to-one correspondence to a parser state, while the items within the set, together with the next symbol, are used to decide which state transitions and parser action are to be applied. Each item contains a marker, to note at which point the currently processed symbol appears in the rule the item represents. For LR(1) parsers, each item is specific to a lookahead terminal, thus the lookahead terminal has also been noted inside each item.

For example, assume a language consisting of the terminal symbols &#x27;n&#x27;, &#x27;+&#x27;, &#x27;(&#x27;, &#x27;)&#x27;, the nonterminals &#x27;E&#x27;, &#x27;T&#x27;, the starting rule &#x27;S&#x27; and the following production rules:
: S → E
: E → T
: E → ( E )
: T → n
: T → + T
: T → T + n
Items sets will be generated by analog to the procedure for LR(0) parsers. The item set 0 which represents the initial state will be created from the starting rule:
: [S → • E, $]
The dot &#x27;•&#x27; denotes the marker of the current parsing position within this rule. The expected lookahead terminal to apply this rule is noted after the comma. The &#x27;$&#x27; sign is used to denote &#x27;end of input&#x27; is expected, as is the case for the starting rule.

This is not the complete item set 0, though. Each item set must be &#x27;closed&#x27;, which means all production rules for each nonterminal following a &#x27;•&#x27; have to be recursively included into the item set until all of those nonterminals are dealt with. The resulting item set is called the closure of the item set we began with.

For LR(1) for each production rule an item has to be included for each possible lookahead terminal following the rule. For more complex languages this usually results in very large item sets, which is the reason for the large memory requirements of LR(1) parsers.

In our example, the starting symbol requires the nonterminal &#x27;E&#x27; which in turn requires &#x27;T&#x27;, thus all production rules will appear in item set 0. At first, we ignore the problem of finding the lookaheads and just look at the case of an LR(0), whose items do not contain lookahead terminals. So the item set 0 (without lookaheads) will look like this:
: [S → • E]
: [E → • T]
: [E → • ( E )]
: [T → • n]
: [T → • + T]
: [T → • T + n]

=== FIRST and FOLLOW sets ===
To determine lookahead terminals, so-called FIRST and FOLLOW sets are used.
FIRST(A) is the set of terminals which can appear as the first element of any chain of rules matching nonterminal A. FOLLOW(I) of an Item I [A → α • B β, x] is the set of terminals that can appear immediately after nonterminal B, where α, β are arbitrary symbol strings, and x is an arbitrary lookahead terminal. FOLLOW(k,B) of an item set k and a nonterminal B is the union of the follow sets of all items in k where &#x27;•&#x27; is followed by B. The FIRST sets can be determined directly from the closures of all nonterminals in the language, while the FOLLOW sets are determined from the items under usage of the FIRST sets.

In our example, as one can verify from the full list of item sets below, the first sets are:
: FIRST(S) = { n, &#x27;+&#x27;, &#x27;(&#x27; }
: FIRST(E) = { n, &#x27;+&#x27;, &#x27;(&#x27; }
: FIRST(T) = { n, &#x27;+&#x27; }

=== Determining lookahead terminals ===
Within item set 0 the follow sets can be found to be:
: FOLLOW(0,S) = { $ }
: FOLLOW(0,E) = { $, &#x27;)&#x27;}
: FOLLOW(0,T) = { $, &#x27;+&#x27;, &#x27;)&#x27; }
From this the full item set 0 for an LR(1) parser can be created, by creating for each item in the LR(0) item set one copy for each terminal in the follow set of the LHS nonterminal. Each element of the follow set may be a valid lookahead terminal:
: [S → • E, $]
: [E → • T, $]
: [E → • T, )]
: [E → • ( E ), $]
: [E → • ( E ), )]
: [T → • n, $]
: [T → • n, +]
: [T → • n, )]
: [T → • + T, $]
: [T → • + T, +]
: [T → • + T, )]
: [T → • T + n, $]
: [T → • T + n, +]
: [T → • T + n, )]

=== Creating new item sets ===
The rest of the item sets can be created by the following algorithm
: 1. For each terminal and nonterminal symbol A appearing after a &#x27;•&#x27; in each already existing item set k, create a new item set m by adding to m all the rules of k where &#x27;•&#x27; is followed by A, but only if m will not be the same as an already existing item set after step 3.
: 2. shift all the &#x27;•&#x27;s for each rule in the new item set one symbol to the right
: 3. create the closure of the new item set
: 4. Repeat from step 1 for all newly created item sets, until no more new sets appear

In the example we get 5 more sets from item set 0, item set 1 for nonterminal E, item set 2 for nonterminal T, item set 3 for terminal n, item set 4 for terminal &#x27;+&#x27; and item set 5 for &#x27;(&#x27;.

Item set 1 (E):

: [S → E •, $]

Item set 2 (T):

: [E → T •, $]
: [T → T • + n, $]
: [T → T • + n, +]
: ·

Item set 3 (n):

: [T → n •, $]
: [T → n •, +]
: [T → n •, )]

Item set 4 (&#x27;+&#x27;):

: [T → + • T, $]
: [T → + • T, +]
: [T → • n, $]
: [T → • n, +]
: [T → • + T, $]
: [T → • + T, +]
: [T → • T + n, $]
: [T → • T + n, +]
: ·

Item set 5 (&#x27;(&#x27;):

: [E → ( • E ), $]
: [E → • T, )]
: [E → • ( E ), )]
: [T → • n, )]
: [T → • n, +]
: [T → • + T, )]
: [T → • + T, +]
: [T → • T + n, )]
: [T → • T + n, +]
: ·

From item sets 2, 4 and 5 several more item sets will be produced. The complete list is quite long and thus will not be stated here. Detailed LR(k) treatment of this grammar can e.g. be found in .

=== Goto ===
The lookahead of an LR(1) item is used directly only when considering reduce actions (i.e., when the • marker is at the right end).

The core of an LR(1) item [S → a A • B e, c] is the LR(0) item S → a A • B e. Different LR(1) items may share the same core.

For example, in item set 2

: [E → T •, $]
: [T → T • + n, $]
: [T → T • + n, +]

the parser is required to perform the reduction [E → T] if the next symbol is &#x27;$&#x27;, but to do a shift if the next symbol is &#x27;+&#x27;. Note that a LR(0) parser would not be able to make this decision, as it only considers the core of the items, and would thus report a shift/reduce conflict.

A state containing [A → α • X β, a] will move to a state containing [A → α X • β, a] with label X.

Every state has transitions according to Goto.

=== Shift actions ===
If [A → α • b β, a] is in state Ik and Ik moves to state Im with label b, then we add the action
: action[Ik, b] = &quot;shift m&quot;

=== Reduce actions ===
If [A→α •, a] is in state Ik, then we add the action
: action[Ik, a] = &quot;reduce A → α&quot;

<text>In the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game, illithids (commonly known as mind flayers) are monstrous humanoid &quot;aberrations&quot; with psionic powers. In a typical &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign setting, they live in the moist caverns and cities of the enormous Underdark.

Illithids believe themselves to be the dominant species of the multiverse and use other intelligent creatures as thralls, slaves, and chattel. Illithids are well known for making thralls out of other intelligent creatures, as well as feasting on their brains.

== Publication history ==
Mind flayers were created by Gary Gygax, who has said that one of his inspirations for them was the cover painting of the Titus Crow book &quot;The Burrowers Beneath&quot; by Brian Lumley. Tim Kirk&#x27;s cover art on the book, then in its first printing, depicted only the tentacles of the titular burrowers, the Chthonians.

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (1974–1976) ===
Mind flayers first appeared in the official newsletter of TSR, &quot;The Strategic Review&quot; #1, Spring 1975, in the section named &quot;Creature Features&quot;. Here, the mind flayer is described as &quot;a super-intelligent, man-shaped creature with four tentacles by its mouth which it uses to strike its prey.&quot; When it hits prey with a tentacle, the tentacle penetrates to the brain and draws it forth, allowing the monster to devour it. A mind flayer&#x27;s major weapon is given as the Mind Blast, a 5-foot radius wave of &quot;Psi force&quot; which affects each opponent differently based on how intelligent it is; possible effects include permanent insanity, rage, confusion, coma, and death. The first illustration depicting mind flayers was by artist Tracy Lesch, who envisioned them &quot;like a Ming the Merciless with the mental powers of a Professor X&quot;, which appeared in the &quot;Blackmoor&quot; (1975) supplement. Game statistics for mind flayers were also included in the &quot;Eldritch Wizardry&quot; supplement.

=== &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 1st edition (1977–1988) ===
The mind flayer appears in the first edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (1977). Roger E. Moore authored &quot;The Ecology of the Mind Flayer,&quot; which featured in &quot;Dragon&quot; #78 (October 1983).

=== &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 2nd edition (1989–1999) ===
The mind flayer appears first in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Volume One&quot; (1989), and is reprinted in the &quot;Monstrous Manual&quot; (1993).

&quot;The Complete Psionics Handbook&quot; (1991) presented ways on using mind flayers with psionic powers.

The &quot;alhoon&quot;, also known as the &quot;illithilich&quot; or &quot;mind flayer lich&quot;, was introduced in the &quot;Menzoberranzan&quot; boxed set, in the booklet &quot;Book One: The City&quot; (1992).

The book &quot;The Illithiad&quot; (April 1998), and the Monstrous Arcana module series that accompanies it, greatly develops the mind flayer further. &quot;The Illithiad&quot; introduced the illithid &quot;elder brain&quot; and the illithid-roper crossbreed, the &quot;urophion&quot;. The module &quot;Dawn of the Overmind&quot; featured an origin story for the illithids.

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3.0 edition (2000–2002) ===
The mind flayer appears in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for this edition (2000). &quot;Savage Species&quot; (2003) added the mind flayer &quot;racial class&quot;, allowing Mind Flayers to be played from level 1 onward until they reached parity with normal Mind Flayers, and added the &quot;Illithid Savant&quot; prestige class.

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3.5 edition (2003–2007) ===
The mind flayer appears in the revised &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for this edition (2003), in both playable and non-playable forms. One of the differences between the playable Mind Flayer in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; and the Mind Flayer racial class in &quot;Savage Species&quot; is that the racial class has only itself as a favored class, while the normal Mind Flayer has wizard as a favored class. The mind flayer received its own chapter in the book &quot;Lords of Madness: The Book of Aberrations&quot; (2005).

The &quot;Expanded Psionics Handbook&quot; (2004) re-introduced the psionic mind flayer, detailing the differences between psionic and normal mind flayers, although creating a Psionic Mind Flayer still requires the information from the &quot;Monster Manual&quot;.

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition (2008–2014) ===
The mind flayer appears in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for this edition (2008).

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition (2014–present) ===
The mind flayer appears in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for this edition (2014). Additional information about the mind flayers is found in &quot;Volo&#x27;s Guide to Monsters&quot; (2016). The information includes details about their origins, their reproduction, their dispositions and behaviors, and their elder brain. The book also details this edition&#x27;s Alhoon, Ulitharid, Mindwitness and Neothelid. The limited edition alternate cover of &quot;Volo&#x27;s Guide to Monsters&quot; features an Illithid illustration by Hydro74. On the fictional canon of mind flayers, 5th Edition designer Chris Perkins, in a 2019 interview, stated:If something has been consistently true about a monster throughout the game&#x27;s history, it&#x27;s a good bet that it holds true in Fifth Edition. Everything that we know is true about mind flayers in Fifth Edition can be found in the 5E &quot;Monster Manual&quot; and the &quot;Mind Flayers: Scourge of Worlds&quot; section of &quot;Volo&#x27;s Guide to Monsters&quot;. The latter resource, in particular, picks up elements of mind flayer lore from earlier sourcebooks, including &quot;The Illithiad&quot; [from 2E] and &quot;Lords of Madness&quot; [from 3.5E].&quot;ComicBook.com&quot; reported that the &quot;big bads&quot; of the module &quot;Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk&quot; (2023) are mind flayers, with the adventure including new variants of mind flayers. Christian Hoffer of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; commented that mind flayers &quot;have appeared in many 5E adventures over the last decade&quot;, however, this module is the first in the edition to have them as the &quot;central villain of the campaign instead of merely one of many side threats. What&#x27;s more, these mind flayers have a goal somewhat similar to one of the central threats faced by players in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 -&quot; ceremorphosis, the process of becoming a mind flayer&quot;.

== Fictional physical characteristics ==
Illithids have a humanoid body with an octopus-like head, which has been observed as a similarity to H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu. 

One of their most feared powers is the dreaded &quot;Mind Blast&quot;, where the illithid emits a cone-shaped psionic shock wave with its mind in order to incapacitate any creature for a short amount of time. 

=== Biology ===
Illithids are hermaphroditic creatures who each spawn a mass of larvae two or three times in their life. The larvae resemble miniature illithid heads or four-tentacled tadpoles. Larvae are left to develop in the pool of the Elder Brain. The ones that survive after 10 years are inserted into the brain of a sapient creature. Hosts are determined in a very specific manner. Hosts generally are humanoid creatures that are between 5 feet 4 inches and 6 feet 2 inches. The most desirable of races for hosts are humans, drow, elves, githzerai, githyanki, grimlocks, gnolls, goblinoids, and orcs. Upon being implanted (through any cranial orifice), the larva then grows and consumes the host&#x27;s brain, absorbing the host&#x27;s physical form entirely and becoming sapient itself, a physically mature (but mentally young) illithid. This process is called &quot;ceremorphosis&quot;.

== Variants ==
=== Alhoon ===
Alhoons (also called illithiliches) are illithids that choose to focus on developing arcane abilities in addition to their psionic ones, and have grown powerful enough in magic to become undead liches. Alhoons are generally pariahs in illithid society because they go against most illithids&#x27; eventual goal: to merge with the Elder Brain, both physically and psionically. Alhoons, on the other hand, are more concerned with their own personal survival. When discovered near illithid communities, alhoons are mercilessly hunted down.

The alhoon first appeared in second edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; for the Forgotten Realms setting in the &quot;Menzoberranzan&quot; boxed set, in the booklet &quot;Book One: The City&quot; (1992), and reprinted in &quot;Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume Three&quot; (1996). The creature was further detailed in the supplement &quot;The Illithiad&quot; (1998). The alhoon also appeared in third edition in &quot;Monsters of Faerûn&quot; (2001) and &quot;Lords of Madness&quot; (2005).

=== Ulitharid ===
=== Vampiric illithids ===
The origins of these unique undead mind flayers are unclear. All that is known of these creatures is that they cannot create spawn, need both fresh blood and fresh brains to survive, are more feral than typical illithids, and are barely intelligent. One possible origin is given in the Ravenloft adventure &quot;Thoughts of Darkness&quot;, where &quot;vampiric mind flayers are either the result of a Mind Flayer tadpole infecting a vampiric host or a host that becomes a vampire before the tadpole fully converts them&quot;. These creatures are hated and feared by typical illithids. Christian Hoffer, &quot;for ComicBook.com&quot;, wrote, &quot;Not only do the vampiric mind flayers possess the psionic powers of a mind flayer, they also have the undead strength and bloodlust of a vampire, making them twice as deadly&quot;. Hoffer also highlighted that they &quot;were created when Lyssa von Zarovich (a descendant of Strahd) attempted to create a creature powerful enough to overthrow her great uncle&quot;. Jacob Creswell, for &quot;CBR&quot;, highlighted that &quot;Vampiric Mind Flayers are a classic &quot;Dungeon &amp; Dragons&quot; monster that combines two terrifying concepts. [...] Originally known as vampiric illithids, vampiric mind flayers were a force to be reckoned with in &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Their superior strength stat meant that they&#x27;d be able to overpower most adventurers&quot;. Creswell included them on list of the seven best monsters introduced in the 5th Edition campaign guide &quot;Van Richten&#x27;s Guide to Ravenloft&quot;.

=== Related creatures ===
Brainstealer Dragon: A mix of illithid and dragon, these powerful wyrms occasionally rule over illithid communities that lack an elder brain.
Illithocyte: Illithid tadpoles that survived the fall of a mind flayer empire, they evolved into a new life form and now crawl about in groups seeking psychic radiation on which to feed.

Kezreth: A living troop transport and battle platform created from the severed head of a shamed illithid. They serve in this capacity in the hope of redeeming themselves and being allowed to return to the elder brain.

Mind Worm: Created by illithids to serve as assassins and bounty-hunters, these powerful psionic creatures resemble smaller purple worms. They can attack from far distances with their probe worms.

Nerve Swimmers: Derived from immature illithid tadpoles, these entities are living instruments of torture and interrogation.
Ustilagor: Mind flayers farm these larval intellect devourers for food and sentries.

Vampire Squid: Servitor creatures created by illithids to extend their reach below the surface of Underdark waters. They have a maw of sharp teeth which can be turned inside out and function as defensive spikes.

== Fictional history ==
The 3.5 Edition &quot;D&amp;D&quot; supplement &quot;Lords of Madness&quot; provides that the Illithid were a star-faring people who existed at the end of time. Facing annihilation, the Illithid traveled to the past, arriving roughly 2000 years before the present in any given &quot;D&amp;D&quot; campaign.

Gith was betrayed by one of her own generals, Zerthimon, who believed she had grown tyrannical and over-aggressive. Civil war erupted, and the race factionalised into the githyanki and the githzerai (and in the Spelljammer campaign setting the Pirates of Gith).

The background material of the &quot;Chainmail&quot; game places the gith forerunners in a subterranean empire called Zarum in Western Oerik, where they dominated many other races from their capital city of Anithor. 

=== Religion ===
Traditionally, illithids revere a perverse deity named Ilsensine. In 2nd edition, they have a second deity named Maanzecorian, who is later killed by Tenebrous (Orcus) in the Planescape adventure module &quot;Dead Gods&quot;. Although Ilsensine is the illithid patron deity, few mind flayers actively worship it, thinking themselves the most powerful creatures in the universe.

=== Activities ===
Currently, the illithids are in a period of intense study and experimentation, gathering knowledge of all sorts that will enable them to eventually reconquer the universe and hold it for good. They frequently meddle in the politics of other races through subtle psychic manipulation of key figures, not to cause chaos but so as to better understand the dynamics of civilization. They regularly probe the minds of surface dwellers so as to gather intelligence and learn about new advances in magic and technology. They also do a good deal of research themselves, mainly focused on developing new psychic powers.

Illithids regularly conduct raids on all sentient settlements to acquire new thralls.

== In various campaign settings ==
=== In &quot;Dragonlance&quot; ===
The yaggol are a variant presented in the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; campaign setting.

=== In &quot;Ravenloft&quot; ===
Illithids are the rulers of a domain in the &quot;Ravenloft&quot; campaign setting called Bluetspur, where their God-Brain is the darklord. In the 5th Edition campaign guide &quot;Van Richten&#x27;s Guide to Ravenloft&quot;, it is revealed that an elder brain became diseased by discovering a &quot;malignant truth&quot; and it began to prey &quot;upon its peers [...]. Horrified by an affliction that infected only them, the other elder brains united and psionically expelled the diseased brain from existence. Or so they thought. From a place without time or reality, the Dark Powers plucked the dying elder brain and planted it upon a tormented world&quot;. &quot;Polygon&quot; highlighted that Bluetspur is &quot;a world of cosmic horror populated by malevolent mind flayers that will make your heroes question their own memories&quot;.

=== In &quot;Spelljammer&quot; ===
According to Ken Rolston, the beholder and the mind flayer &quot;win starring roles as intergalactic menaces&quot; in Spelljammer, describing the mind flayers as &quot;evil, brain-sucking horrors who have polished up their social skills sufficiently to present a dubiously neutral facade to trading partners as they secretly scheme toward the day when all intelligent races will be their vassals and brain-food&quot;. &quot;D&amp;D&quot; chroniclers Michael Witwer &quot;et al.&quot; commented on their appearance in the setting, already featured on the cover of &quot;AD&amp;D Adventures in Space&quot;: &quot;the illithid, the race of the mind flayers, finally return home to space&quot;.

=== &quot;Pharagos: The Battleground&quot; ===
In a proposed campaign setting, Pharagos is a lightly populated Earth-like world with three continents and numerous chains of islands. The one remarkable feature of this world is the presence of an immense petrified corpse of a god previously worshiped by the Forerunner civilization before it was crushed by the illithid empire. A vast stony column of forgotten beliefs, it is buried deep in the ground. The current inhabitants of Pharagos have no knowledge of the planet&#x27;s past; the illithid empire&#x27;s rule over Pharagos and the origin of the gith races on this world are lost to history. They are unaware that the source of mystical power for their numerous cults comes from the presence of the dead god under their land.

== Critical reception ==
The mind flayer was ranked fourth among the ten best mid-level monsters by the authors of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons For Dummies&quot;. They referred to this unique creation of the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game as the &quot;quintessential evil genius&quot; and the &quot;perfect evil overlord&quot;. Games journalist David M. Ewalt found them &quot;one of D&amp;D&#x27;s most popular monsters&quot;. Academic Philip J. Clements considered mind flayers one of the &quot;game&#x27;s signature monsters&quot;, while &quot;Backstab&quot; reviewer Philippe Tessier called it a &quot;classic of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;&quot; and Witwer &quot;et al.&quot; &quot;iconic &quot;D&amp;D&quot; monsters&quot;.

&quot;The Stranger&quot; writer Cienna Madrid described the Mind Flayer as one of D&amp;D&#x27;s &quot;ghastly fiends&quot;. Reviewer Julien Blondel for &quot;Backstab&quot; described them as vile brain-eating creatures full of psionic energy. He found them delightful creatures for a sadistic Dungeon Master to use, and a useful bridge between classic game worlds and the planes, as illithids abound in both.

Rob Bricken of &quot;io9&quot; named the mind flayer as the 9th most memorable D&amp;D monster. &quot;SyFy Wire&quot; in 2018 called it one of &quot;The 9 Scariest, Most Unforgettable Monsters From Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, saying that &quot;Mind flayers are another classic monster like the beholder.&quot; &quot;Screen Rant&quot; compiled a list of the game&#x27;s &quot;10 Most Powerful (And 10 Weakest) Monsters, Ranked&quot; in 2018, calling the elder brain one of the strongest, saying that while the 5th &quot;edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons has toned down the elder brain a lot&quot;, it &quot;still represents a grave threat to most adventuring parties, thanks to its range of powerful enchantment spells and psionic attacks, but it isn&#x27;t quite the epic level threat that it once was.&quot; Reviewer Scott Baird also found that the illithids in general &quot;are considered to be one of the most disliked creatures in all of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.&quot;

== In other media ==
Mind flayers appear in other role-playing games, including &quot;Angband&quot;, &quot;Bloodborne&quot;, &quot;Demon&#x27;s Souls&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;NetHack&quot;, &quot;Lost Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot; and &quot;Lost Souls&quot;, and the one-player gamebook RPG series &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; includes a creature similar to the illithid, the Brain Slayer.

* Ulchalothe in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance II&quot; is the guardian of the Brazier of Eternal Flame. There are illithid settlements of varying size in the games &quot;Neverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark&quot;, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II&quot; and &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot;. The villain in the &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; premium module &#x27;Kingmaker&#x27; is also an Illithid. 
* Illithid characters and plot elements play a central role throughout the story of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot;.
* In episode 30 of the webcomic &quot;Order of the Stick&quot; (written by Rich Burlew), the party bard Elan encounters an illithid in its lair. The illithid opts not to consume Elan&#x27;s brain due to the bard&#x27;s stupidity, and so they start playing Scrabble instead. Episode 31 makes a reference to the illithid&#x27;s preferred diet. Episode 32 makes a fourth-wall reference to the fact that the illithid isn&#x27;t open-source material.
* In the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, players encounter an enemy called the Mindflayer, a cave-dwelling magic user that has the head of a squid, wears a flowing robe, and wields a staff. When the first game for the NES was brought to North America it was referred to as a Sorcerer. Although the Mindflayer&#x27;s name and appearance have been kept the same, the &quot;Beholder&quot; was changed to Evil Eye.
* The Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, following the eighth episode of the second season, used the name &quot;Mind Flayer&quot; to refer to one of the main antagonists of the series due to their similar natures.

=== Licensing ===
The illithid is considered &quot;Product Identity&quot; by Wizards of the Coast and as such is not released under its Open Game License.

<doc id="73066" wikidata="Q162586" url="?curid=73066" title="Dream Theater">
<text>Dream Theater is an American progressive metal band formed in 1985 in Boston, Massachusetts. The band comprises John Petrucci (guitar), John Myung (bass), Mike Portnoy (drums), James LaBrie (vocals) and Jordan Rudess (keyboards).

Dream Theater was formed under the name Majesty by Petrucci, Myung and Portnoy—all natives of Long Island, New York—while they attended Berklee College of Music. They dropped out to concentrate on the band. Petrucci and Myung have been the only two constant members. Portnoy remained until 2010, when he was replaced by Mike Mangini after deciding to leave to pursue other musical projects, before rejoining Dream Theater in October 2023. After a brief stint with Chris Collins, followed by Charlie Dominici (who was dismissed from Dream Theater shortly after the release of their 1989 debut album &quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot;), LaBrie was hired as the band&#x27;s singer in 1991. Dream Theater&#x27;s first keyboardist, Kevin Moore, left the band after three albums and was replaced by Derek Sherinian in 1995 after a period of touring. The band recorded one album (and an EP) with Sherinian, who was replaced by current keyboardist Jordan Rudess in 1999.

Dream Theater has released sixteen studio albums. The band&#x27;s highest-selling release is their second album &quot;Images and Words&quot; (1992), which reached No. 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The albums &quot;Awake&quot; (1994) and &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot; (2002) also entered the charts at No. 32 and No. 46 respectively, and each received critical acclaim. Their fifth album, &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&quot; (1999), was ranked number 95 on the October 2006 issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the greatest 100 guitar albums of all time. It was also ranked as the 15th Greatest Concept Album in March 2003 by &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine.

By 2018, Dream Theater had sold over 12 million records worldwide and they have received three Grammy Award nominations (including one win in 2022). Along with Queensrÿche and Fates Warning, the band has been referred to as one of the &quot;big three&quot; of the progressive metal genre, responsible for its development and popularization.
== History ==
=== Formation (1985–1987) ===
Dream Theater (then-Majesty) was formed in Massachusetts in 1985 when guitarist John Petrucci, bassist John Myung, and drummer Mike Portnoy decided to form a band while attending Berklee College of Music in Boston. Petrucci and Myung were childhood friends from Kings Park, New York, and met Portnoy of Long Beach, New York while at Berklee. The trio started by covering Rush and Iron Maiden songs in the rehearsal rooms at Berklee.

Myung, Petrucci, and Portnoy joined on the name Majesty for their newly formed group. According to &quot;The Score So Far...&quot; documentary, they were waiting in line for tickets to a Rush concert at the Berklee Performance Center while listening to the band on a boom box. Portnoy commented that the ending of the song &quot;Bastille Day&quot; (from the album &quot;Caress of Steel&quot;) sounded &quot;majestic&quot;. It was then decided that Majesty would be the band&#x27;s name.

The trio then set out to fill the remaining positions in the group. Petrucci asked his high school bandmate Kevin Moore to play the keyboard. After he accepted the position, another friend from home, Chris Collins, was recruited as lead vocalist after band members heard him sing a cover of &quot;Queen of the Reich&quot; by Queensrÿche. During this time, Portnoy, Petrucci, and Myung&#x27;s hectic schedules forced them to abandon their studies to concentrate on their music, as they did not feel they could learn more in college. Moore also left his college, SUNY Fredonia, to concentrate on the band.
The beginning months of 1986 were filled with various concert dates in and around the New York City area. During this time, the band recorded a collection of demos, titled &quot;The Majesty Demos&quot;. The initial run of 1,000 sold out within six months, and dubbed copies of the cassette became popular within the progressive metal scene. The &quot;Majesty Demos&quot; are still available in their original tape format today, despite being released officially on CD, through Portnoy&#x27;s YtseJam Records (and on InsideOut in 2022, after YtseJam Records was shut down).

In November 1986, Chris Collins left the band after a few months of writing and performing together. After a year of trying to find a replacement, Charlie Dominici, who was far older and more experienced than anyone else in the band, successfully auditioned for the group. With the stability that Dominici&#x27;s appointment brought to Majesty, they began to increase the number of shows played in the New York City area, gaining a considerable amount of exposure.

Shortly after hiring Dominici, a Las Vegas group also named Majesty threatened legal action for intellectual property infringement related to the use of their name, so the band was forced to come up with a new one. Various possibilities were proposed and tested, among them Glasser, Magus, and M1, which were all rejected, though the band did go as Glasser for about a week, with poor reactions from fans. Eventually, Portnoy&#x27;s father suggested the name Dream Theater, the name of a small theater in Monterey, California, and the name stuck.

=== &quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot; (1988–1990) ===
With their new name and band stability, Dream Theater concentrated on writing more material while playing more concerts in New York and in neighboring states. This eventually attracted the attention of Mechanic Records, a division of MCA. Dream Theater signed their first record contract with Mechanic on June 23, 1988, and set out to record their debut album. The band recorded the album at Kajem Victory Studios in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania. Recording the basic tracks took about ten days, and the entire album was completed in about three weeks.

&quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot; was released in 1989 to far less fanfare than the band had anticipated. Mechanic ended up breaking the majority of the financial promises they had made to Dream Theater before signing their contract, so the band was restricted to playing around New York City. The promotional tour for the album consisted of just five concerts, all of which were relatively local. The first show was at Sundance in Bay Shore, New York opening for the classic rock power trio Zebra.

After the fourth show, Charlie Dominici was let go because the band was starting to feel the limitations of his voice based upon the vocal style they wanted. The band was looking for a singer with a style more like Bruce Dickinson or Geoff Tate, and Dominici&#x27;s stage presence was not what they wanted for a frontman. Shortly after, however, the band Marillion asked Dream Theater to open for them at a gig at the Ritz in New York, so Dominici was allowed to perform one last time. It would be another two years before Dream Theater had a replacement vocalist.

=== Addition of James LaBrie and &quot;Images and Words&quot; (1991–1993) ===
Following Dominici&#x27;s departure, Dream Theater fought successfully to be released from their contract with Mechanic and set about auditioning singers and writing material for their next album. In their search for a new singer, they auditioned over 200 people, among them former Fates Warning frontman John Arch. Arch ultimately decided that his commitments were more important and he opted not to join the band. On June 9, 1990, at a gig at Sundance in Bay Shore, New York, Dream Theater introduced Steve Stone as their new singer after playing half the set as an instrumental band. Stone had successfully recorded demos with Dream Theater, but he was fired following a single, ill-fated live performance. According to Mike Portnoy, Stone moved around the stage in a rather odd manner, seemingly doing a bad impression of Bruce Dickinson. Additionally, he shouted &quot;Scream for me Long Beach!&quot; several times throughout the show (Dickinson can be heard saying this on Iron Maiden&#x27;s live album &quot;Live After Death&quot;), although they were performing in Bay Shore. The audience was immediately turned off by the new singer. It was five months before Dream Theater played another show, this time all-instrumental (under the name YtseJam). Until 1991, the band remained focused in an attempt to hire another singer and writing additional music. It was during this period that they wrote the majority of what would become &quot;Images and Words&quot; (1992).

In January 1991, the band received a demo tape from Kevin James LaBrie, of glam metal band Winter Rose. The band had received the tape just before they were about to commit to another singer. The band was so impressed by his demo that he was flown from Canada to New York for an audition. LaBrie jammed on three songs with the band and was immediately hired to fill the vocalist position. Once recruited, LaBrie decided to drop his first name to avoid confusion with the other Kevin in the band. For the next few months, the band returned to playing live shows (still mostly around NYC), while working on vocal parts for the music written before acquiring LaBrie. Derek Shulman and ATCO Records (now East West), a division of Elektra Records, signed Dream Theater to a seven-album contract based on a three-song demo (later made available as &quot;The Atco Demos&quot; through the Dream Theater fan club).

The first album to be recorded under their new record contract was &quot;Images and Words&quot; (1992). For promotion, the label released a CD single and video clip for the song &quot;Another Day&quot;, but neither made significant commercial impact. The song &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;, however, managed to garner a high level of radio airplay without any organized promotion from the band or their label. In response, ATCO produced a video clip for &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;, which saw heavy rotation on MTV. A third video clip was produced for &quot;Take the Time&quot;, but it was not nearly as successful as &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;.

The success of &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;, combined with relentless touring throughout the U.S. and Japan, caused &quot;Images and Words&quot; to achieve gold record certification in the States and platinum status in Japan. A tour of Europe followed in 1993, which included a show at London&#x27;s famed Marquee Club. This show was recorded and released as &quot;Live at the Marquee&quot;, Dream Theater&#x27;s first official live album. Additionally, a video compilation of their Japanese concerts (mixed in with documentary-style footage of the off-stage portion of the tour) was released as &quot;Images and Words: Live in Tokyo&quot;.

=== &quot;Awake&quot; and Kevin Moore&#x27;s departure (1994–1995) ===
Eager to work on fresh material, Dream Theater retreated to the studio in May 1994. &quot;Awake&quot;, Dream Theater&#x27;s third studio album, was released on October 4, 1994. Shortly before the album was mixed, Moore had announced to the rest of the band that he would be quitting Dream Theater to concentrate on his musical interests, since he was no longer interested in touring or the style of music which Dream Theater performed. As a result, the band had to scramble to find a replacement keyboardist before a tour could be considered.

Former Yngwie Malmsteen and Dio keyboardist Jens Johansson, who would go on to become a member of Stratovarius, was among the biggest names to audition, but the band members were eager to fill the position with keyboardist Jordan Rudess. Portnoy and Petrucci had come across Rudess in Keyboard Magazine, where he was recognized as &quot;best new talent&quot; in the readers&#x27; poll. The two invited him to play a trial gig with the band at the Concrete Foundations Forum in Burbank, California. Although the show was a success, and Rudess was asked to fill the keyboardist position permanently, he opted to tour with The Dixie Dregs instead, since it granted him more personal latitude. Dream Theater hired fellow Berklee alumnus Derek Sherinian, who had previously toured and recorded with Alice Cooper and Kiss, to fill in for the &quot;Waking Up the World Tour&quot;. By the conclusion of the tour, the band decided to take Sherinian on as Moore&#x27;s full-time replacement.

=== &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;, &quot;Falling into Infinity&quot; (1995–1998) ===
Once again finding themselves with a new member, the band did not immediately start working on new material. Fans around the world, united on the YtseJam Mailing List (the most popular form of communication between Dream Theater fans at that point), had begun to put pressure on the band to officially release the song &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;. This had been written in 1989 and was intended to be a part of &quot;Images and Words&quot;, but at almost 17 minutes, it was deemed too long for studio placement. It had nevertheless been performed live by the band, who continued to revise it in the years leading up to 1995.

The petition was successful, and the group entered BearTracks Studios in New York in May 1995 to rewrite and record the now 23-minute-long song with Sherinian contributing significantly to the final product. The band released &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; as an EP along with a collection of cover songs from a live show recorded at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in London earlier that year.

After a brief run of small concerts and a short break, the band released a special Christmas CD through their official fan club, consisting of rare live tracks recorded during the band&#x27;s early years. They continued releasing a new CD each Christmas until 2005.

Meanwhile, there were several changes at East West, and Dream Theater&#x27;s main contact within the label was fired. As a result, the new team at the company were unaccustomed to the relationship Dream Theater had with former East West personnel, and they pressured them to write an album that was more accessible. In mid-1997, they entered the studio to write their next album. In addition to pressuring the band to adopt a more mainstream sound, East West recruited writer/producer Desmond Child to work with Petrucci on polishing the lyrics to his song &quot;You or Me&quot;. The whole band substantially reworked the song, and it appeared on the album as &quot;You Not Me&quot; with a chorus that bore little resemblance to the original. Child also had a noticeable impact on the album, with a shift towards less complex and more radio-friendly compositions.

The band wrote almost two CDs worth of material, including a 20-minute-long follow-up to the &quot;Images and Words&quot; song &quot;Metropolis–Part I: The Miracle and the Sleeper&quot;. The label, however, did not allow the release of a double album because it felt that a 140-minute record would not be well received by the general public. James LaBrie also felt that the CD should be a single disc. The unused songs were later released in the YtseJam Records release &quot;The Falling into Infinity Demos&quot;.

The material that made it onto the album proper was released as &quot;Falling into Infinity&quot;, which received a mixed reception from fans who were more familiar with the band&#x27;s earlier sound. While the album was moderately progressive-sounding, tracks such as &quot;Hollow Years&quot; and &quot;You Not Me&quot; prompted some to believe it was the dawn of a new, mainstream-sounding Dream Theater. Overall, the album was both a critical and commercial disappointment. Although Portnoy did not speak out publicly at the time, he later revealed in the 2004 DVD commentary for &quot;5 Years in a Livetime&quot; that he had been so discouraged during this period that he had considered disbanding Dream Theater altogether.

During the European leg of the Touring Into Infinity world tour, two shows were recorded for a live album titled &quot;Once in a LIVEtime&quot;, in France and The Netherlands. The album was released at around the same time as the video &quot;5 Years in a Livetime&quot;, which covered the years from Kevin Moore&#x27;s departure to the &quot;Falling into Infinity&quot; promotional tour.

=== Derek Sherinian&#x27;s departure, addition of Jordan Rudess, and &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&quot; (1999–2000) ===
In 1997, Magna Carta Records&#x27; Mike Varney invited Portnoy to assemble a progressive &quot;supergroup&quot; to work on an album, which would become the first in a long string of side-projects for the members of Dream Theater. The lineup consisted of Portnoy on drums, Petrucci on guitar, Tony Levin on bass, and keyboardist Jordan Rudess, who had finished with the Dixie Dregs. The band assumed the name Liquid Tension Experiment, and would act as a medium through which Portnoy and Petrucci could once again court Rudess to join Dream Theater. In 1999, he accepted an offer to become the third full-time Dream Theater keyboardist, replacing Sherinian.

With yet another new member, Dream Theater entered BearTracks Studio once again to write and record their next album. As a result of an ultimatum from Portnoy, the label gave the band complete creative control. The band began by revisiting the follow-up to &quot;Metropolis–Part I&quot;, which had been partially written during the &quot;Falling into Infinity&quot; sessions but which had not been completed or used on that album. They decided to expand the 21-minute song into a complete concept album, with a story revolving around themes such as reincarnation, murder and betrayal. To avoid stirring up the fan base, a tight veil of secrecy enveloped the writing and recording process. The only things fans were privy to before its release were a track list that had been leaked against the band&#x27;s wishes, and a release date. In 1999, &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&quot; was released to high critical acclaim, being lauded as the band&#x27;s magnum opus, despite only reaching No. 73 on the US album chart.

The album was mixed by David Bottrill, but only a few of his mixes made it on the final album. The bulk was remixed by Kevin Shirley, who had produced &quot;Falling into Infinity&quot;. The rest of the mixes can be heard in the band&#x27;s official bootleg &quot;The Making of Scenes from a Memory&quot;.

The subsequent Metropolis 2000 world tour was by far their largest to date, and took over a year to complete. The concerts reflected the theatrical aspect of the album, with the first half of each show comprising the entire &quot;Scenes From a Memory&quot; album accompanied by a film showing dramatized portions of the story projected onto a video screen behind the stage. For the last date of the North American leg, at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City, actors were hired to play characters in the story, and a gospel choir was enlisted to perform in some sections of the performance. The show was filmed and eventually released in early 2001 as the band&#x27;s first DVD release, &quot;Metropolis 2000: Scenes from New York&quot;, which was certified Gold in the US on November 8, 2002.

Since several songs from the second half of the four-hour show had to be cut from the DVD to save space, the band also released the full show on the live CD &quot;Live Scenes from New York&quot;. The original cover depicted one of Dream Theater&#x27;s early logos (the &quot;Images and Words&quot;-era burning heart, modeled on the Sacred Heart of Christ) modified to show an apple (as in &quot;Big Apple&quot;) instead of the heart, and the New York skyline, including the twin towers of the World Trade Center, in the flame above it. In an unfortunate coincidence, the album was released on the same date as the September 11 attacks. The album was quickly recalled by the band and was re-released with revised artwork later, although the few copies which were sold with the original artwork have since become rare collector&#x27;s items.

=== &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot; (2001–2002) ===
Putting the whole ordeal behind them, Dream Theater once again entered BearTracks Studios to record their sixth studio album. Four years after they first petitioned East West to allow them to release a double album, they finally got their chance with &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot;. The first disc consisted of five tracks of 7–13 minutes in length, and the second disc was devoted entirely to the 42-minute title track, which remains to date the longest song Dream Theater has written. Many of the song&#x27;s melodies and musical themes originated in an instrumental piece, written by Rudess, which would eventually become the song&#x27;s &quot;Overture&quot;. Those themes were then expanded by the rest of the band to form individual chapters in a complete story.

&quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot; was very well received by critics and the press. It was the most publicized of Dream Theater&#x27;s albums since &quot;Awake&quot;, debuting on the Billboard charts at No. 46 and the Billboard Internet charts at No. 1. The subsequent world tour included a select few special &quot;album cover&quot; gigs (see Cover songs section, below), in which they played Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; and Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; in their entirety.

=== &quot;Train of Thought&quot; (2003–2004) ===
In 2003, Dream Theater entered the studio to write and record another album. Unlike &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot;, which had been written and recorded simultaneously in the studio, the band took a different approach by setting aside three weeks for writing prior to recording. In the middle of the recording sessions for the album, a special tour with two other progressive metal bands, Queensrÿche and Fates Warning, was undertaken in North America. Referred to in the band&#x27;s promotional material as the &quot;Escape from the Studio American tour&quot;, the tour featured Queensrÿche and Dream Theater as co-headlining acts with Fates Warning performing supporting act duties. As a finale for each concert there was an extended encore in which both Dream Theater and Queensrÿche performed together on stage simultaneously, often playing cover songs.

After the tour, Dream Theater returned to the studio to finish the recording of their seventh album, &quot;Train of Thought&quot;. In contrast to the extended songs of their previous album, the band aimed to write a more song-oriented album, inspired in part by covering the &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; and &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; albums on their previous concert tour. Although the album was a critical success, its more straightforward metal sound alienated many of the band&#x27;s existing fans, who had been attracted by the band&#x27;s roots in progressive rock. During this time they also re-released their first two live videos for the first time on DVD, titled &quot;Images and Words: Live in Tokyo/5 Years in a Livetime&quot; on June 29, 2004, through Rhino Records. This release was certified Platinum on March 22, 2006.

Another world tour followed, named the Train of Thought Tour. A modest North American tour was completed by the two bands, which Dream Theater supported Yes, a band that had been a major influence on their own musical style. After this Dream Theater continued to tour the world with their so-called &quot;An Evening With Dream Theater&quot; shows. The latter were captured in another live CD/DVD release, recorded at the famous Nippon Budokan Hall in Tokyo, Japan on their Train of Thought Tour. &quot;Live at Budokan&quot; was released on October 5, 2004, and was certified Platinum in the US on January 26, 2005.

=== &quot;Octavarium&quot; (2005–2006) ===

After their &quot;Train of Thought&quot; promotional tour, Dream Theater entered the Hit Factory studios in NYC to record their eighth album. They would become the final group to use the famous studio, which closed on April 1, 2005.

&quot;Octavarium&quot; was released on June 7, 2005, and took the band&#x27;s sound in yet another new direction. Its eight songs included a continuation of Portnoy&#x27;s &quot;Twelve-step&quot; saga (&quot;The Root of All Evil&quot;, steps 6–7 in the 12-step plan), as well as the title track, a musically versatile 24-minute epic rivaling &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;. &quot;Octavarium&quot; received mixed reviews from fans and has been the subject of spirited debate. &quot;Octavarium&quot; was the last album under their seven-album deal with Elektra Records, which had inherited the contract upon its absorption of EastWest Records.

Dream Theater started the Octavarium Tour extensively throughout 2005 and 2006 to celebrate their 20th Anniversary as a band, including a headlining spot on Gigantour alongside Megadeth and put together by frontman Dave Mustaine, also featuring Fear Factory, Nevermore and Symphony X. During a show on August 2, 2005, in Dallas, the band paid tribute to Pantera&#x27;s late guitarist Dimebag Darrell by performing the song &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot; as an encore. In addition, was the unexpected appearance of fellow musicians Russell Allen (Symphony X vocalist), Burton C. Bell (Fear Factory vocalist) and Dave Mustaine (Megadeth vocalist/guitarist), who joined the band on stage to perform parts of the song.

Dream Theater later departed from Gigantour 2005 a few dates before it ended and continued on with their own series of concerts, several of which were recorded and released for the band&#x27;s fanclubs. The 20th anniversary tour concluded with a show at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on April 1, 2006. Though the show had minimal promotion, it was sold out days after tickets were made available. This show, which was recorded for a CD/DVD called &quot;Score&quot; released on August 29, 2006, through Rhino Records, featured songs from the band&#x27;s entire history, as well a second half accompanied by a full symphony orchestra (the &quot;Octavarium Orchestra&quot;). This release was the band&#x27;s third Live DVD release to be certified Platinum in the US on October 11, 2006.

=== &quot;Systematic Chaos&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hit (...And 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs)&quot; (2006–2008) ===

For the first time in their career, the band decided to take the summer off after their show at Radio City Music Hall. In September 2006, Dream Theater entered Avatar Studios to record their follow-up to &quot;Octavarium&quot; with legendary studio engineer Paul Northfield. Dream Theater&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Systematic Chaos&quot;, was released on June 5, 2007. The record marked their first with new label Roadrunner Records, which in 2010 would become a wholly owned subsidiary of the band&#x27;s previous label Atlantic Records. Roadrunner implemented increased promotion for the album and &quot;Systematic Chaos&quot; duly reached number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It also oversaw the release of a video for &quot;Constant Motion&quot; on July 14, the band&#x27;s first music video since Hollow Years in 1997. The album was bookended by the two parts of &quot;In the Presence of Enemies&quot;, written and conceived as a single piece but split into two halves for the purposes of the album. The other six tracks included the most recent part of Portnoy&#x27;s continuing AA Saga with the song &quot;Repentance&quot;.

In the same year, the first version of Rich Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Lifting Shadows&quot;, an authorized history of the band&#x27;s first twenty years, was released.

The 2007–08 Chaos in Motion Tour started off in Italy. Dream Theater played in the Gods of Metal concert on June 3, 2007, as well as various other European festivals including the Netherlands&#x27; Fields of Rock Festival, UK&#x27;s Download Festival, the French festival Hellfest Summer Open Air alongside Megadeth, Korn, Mastodon and Slayer. The North American leg of the tour began on July 24 in San Diego, California and wrapped up on August 26 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They played with opening acts Redemption and Into Eternity. The Chaos In Motion Tour continued for the rest of the year and into 2008, playing shows in Asia, South America and, for the first time, Australia.

On April 1, 2008, a two-disc compilation album titled &quot;Greatest Hit (...and 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs)&quot; was released by the band. The title jokingly references the song &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;, the band&#x27;s only significant radio hit. It also includes three song re-mixes from their second album, &quot;Images and Words&quot;, five edited versions of previously released songs, and a track from a single B-side. Unlike most greatest hits compilations, Dream Theater was actively involved with the album, coming up with the track listing that they felt best represented their musical careers.

After the release of &quot;Greatest Hit&quot;, drummer Mike Portnoy organized a new tour called Progressive Nation 2008. Unlike previous Dream Theater tours, performances were held in cities that they had not visited before (such as Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) or cities they had not played in for several years. This tour also marked the first time, since the release of Images and Words, where the group performed in small venues and performance halls.

In September 2008, the band released a DVD set called &quot;Chaos in Motion 2007–2008&quot;, featuring songs recorded at several shows during the &quot;Chaos in Motion&quot; tour.

=== &quot;Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings&quot; (2008–2010) ===
On October 7, 2008, Dream Theater returned to Avatar Studios to begin work on their tenth album, resuming their relationship with Paul Northfield to engineer and mix the record. The album, titled &quot;Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings&quot;, was released on June 23, 2009. In addition to the standard CD, the album was made available on vinyl LP, as well as a 3-disc Special Edition CD that includes the full album, a CD of instrumental mixes of the album and a CD of six cover songs from artists such as Queen and Rainbow. On July 1, 2009, the album debuted at No. 6 on Billboard&#x27;s Top 200 album chart, with first week sales totalling 40,285, making their highest entry on the chart. The album featured &quot;The Shattered Fortress&quot;, the last in Mike Portnoy&#x27;s series of songs about his 12-step recovery from alcoholism, as well as the song &quot;The Best of Times&quot;, described by Portnoy as &quot;a real heavy personal subject about my dad who passed away during the making of the album ... He was battling cancer throughout its making.&quot;

The band also embarked on a second Progressive Nation tour, including the tour&#x27;s first performances in Europe. Opeth, Unexpect and Bigelf supported Dream Theater in Europe, while Zappa Plays Zappa, Pain of Salvation, and Beardfish were slated to perform on the North American leg. However, Pain of Salvation and Beardfish were unable to tour with Dream Theater and Zappa Plays Zappa because of financial troubles within their respective record labels. The two new bands that filled the vacated slots for the Progressive Nation 2009 tour in North America were Bigelf and Scale the Summit with Bigelf performing on both European and North American legs.

After the Progressive Nation Tour, Dream Theater re-entered the studio to write and record a brand new instrumental track for inclusion on the &quot;God of War III&quot; soundtrack EP &quot;God of War: Blood &amp; Metal&quot;. The track, titled &quot;Raw Dog&quot; (&quot;God (of) War&quot; reversed), marked the first time that the band has written and recorded an exclusive track for an outside project. &quot;Raw Dog&quot; includes the first ever commercially recorded harpejji track, performed by Jordan Rudess, as well as Dream Theater&#x27;s final recorded performance with Mike Portnoy on drums prior to his departure from the band in 2010. In December 2009, during their &quot;Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings&quot; tour whilst visiting Australia, Dream Theater appeared with one support act, Pain of Salvation. In March 2010, they toured South America with Bigelf. Afterwards, during the summer of 2010, Dream Theater supported Iron Maiden on the US and Canadian legs of their summer tour which were the last shows DT played during 2010.

=== Mike Portnoy&#x27;s departure and arrival of Mike Mangini (2010–2011) ===

On September 8, 2010, drummer Mike Portnoy announced that he would be leaving Dream Theater, citing better relationships in other projects, burnout, and his desire for a break as reasons. Elaborating on the situation for MusicRadar, John Petrucci revealed that originally, Portnoy did not want to leave the band; he only wanted to take a five-year break. He eventually dropped this number to around one year. Only after the rest of the band rejected his proposal did Portnoy decide to quit.

After Portnoy left Dream Theater, relationships between him and his former bandmates became strained. In February 2011, Portnoy complained that no one from the band was returning his calls and e-mails. However, later Portnoy commented that both Petrucci and Rudess were the only members that stayed in touch with him. Tensions became especially high when Portnoy called James LaBrie &quot;disrespectful&quot; for comments LaBrie made during an interview, stating that Dream Theater were &quot;not sad at all&quot; that Portnoy was no longer a band member. By July 2011, LaBrie had not remained in touch with Portnoy. Portnoy later stated that he would rejoin the band in a heartbeat, stating: &quot;They are the ones that have closed the door on it. I&#x27;ve only needed a break, and I&#x27;ve had that break. So I&#x27;m ready, willing and able. But I honestly don&#x27;t think they ever will; they&#x27;ve closed their door on it and I think they&#x27;re too headstrong in having to prove themselves without me. So I wouldn&#x27;t count on it. But my door is always open.&quot;

A little more than a month after Portnoy&#x27;s departure, Dream Theater began auditioning for a new drummer in New York City. The drummers who auditioned were Mike Mangini, Derek Roddy, Thomas Lang, Virgil Donati, Marco Minnemann, Aquiles Priester, and Peter Wildoer. Fates Warning drummer Bobby Jarzombek was also invited to audition, but had to turn down the offer due to scheduling conflicts. The candidates were notified whether they had been chosen on November 5; however, the results of the audition were not made public until April 2011 via a three-part YouTube documentary series called &quot;The Spirit Carries On&quot;. In the last episode of the series, it was revealed that Mangini was the drummer selected. Petrucci later explained that Portnoy approached them to rejoin after they had selected Mangini; Mangini however, by this time had left his job as a professor at Berklee and committed to Dream Theater full-time, so Portnoy&#x27;s offer was rebuffed.

=== &quot;A Dramatic Turn of Events&quot; (2011–2012) ===
Dream Theater entered Cove City Sound Studios to begin working on a new album on January 3, 2011. Writing was completed on March 2 and done without Mangini. On April 14, LaBrie began tracking vocals and by June 28, the album&#x27;s mixing and mastering by Andy Wallace were finished. Released worldwide on September 12 and in the United States on September 13, &quot;A Dramatic Turn of Events&quot; debuted at number one in some countries and attained the eighth position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the band&#x27;s second ever top ten debut position on that chart after &quot;Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings&quot;. Although the album received mixed reviews, it won numerous awards from music publications and its lead single, &quot;On the Backs of Angels&quot;, was nominated for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance at the 2012 Grammy Awards, representing the band&#x27;s first ever Grammy nomination.

Dream Theater kicked off their tour in support of &quot;A Dramatic Turn of Events&quot; on July 4, 2011, in Rome, Italy. The second leg of the tour took place in North America, where the band headlined with Trivium. After a short break to conclude 2011, the band returned to Europe with Periphery, to Asia with Andy McKee, to North America with Crimson Projekct and then to South America for the final leg of the tour. On August 19 and 20, two shows were recorded at Luna Park in Buenos Aires, Argentina for a live Blu-ray release by Over the Edge Productions. After a six-month delay, &quot;Live at Luna Park&quot; was released on November 5, 2013, by Eagle Rock Entertainment. The tour concluded on September 1, 2012, in Brasília, Brazil.

On December 25, 2013, at 06:00:00 EST, as a holiday gift to the fans, Dream Theater released a free electronic 2-CD set of live tracks that were not recorded for &quot;Live at Luna Park&quot; from their 2011–2012 tour in FLAC format via BitTorrent. The release date and time were an allusion to their 1994 song &quot;6:00&quot;, the intro of which contains a repeated sample of the line &quot;Six o&#x27;clock on a Christmas morning&quot; as spoken by Helena Carroll in &quot;The Dead&quot;.

=== &quot;Dream Theater&quot; (2013–2014) ===
Writing for Dream Theater&#x27;s twelfth studio album commenced on A Dramatic Tour of Events. During soundchecks, the band would jam and record their ideas, and John Petrucci would bring in material he wrote independently. Following the conclusion of the tour, the band took a break but continued writing. They reconvened in early 2013 to enter the studio.

In December 2012, Dream Theater re-signed with Roadrunner Records. The band&#x27;s self-titled twelfth album was released on September 23, 2013, as part of the new agreement with Roadrunner. The album sold more than 34,000 copies in its first week and landed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at No. 7, the band&#x27;s third consecutive top 10 album. In addition, the album cracked the top 10 in 24 countries including Japan, Germany, Argentina, The Netherlands, Finland, Italy, Switzerland, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Austria, Australia and United Kingdom. Dream Theater&#x27;s seventh live album, &quot;Live at Luna Park&quot;, was released on November 5, 2013.

On July 8, 2014, Dream Theater released &quot;The Studio Albums 1992–2011&quot;, a box set spanning all albums from &quot;Images and Words&quot; to &quot;A Dramatic Turn of Events&quot;.

On September 30, 2014, Dream Theater released their eighth live album and film, &quot;Breaking the Fourth Wall&quot;, which was recorded live from The Boston Opera House on March 25, 2014. During this concert, the band were joined by the Berklee World Strings and the Berklee Concert Choir, directed by Eren Başbuğ, for the second half of the set. The set list for the tour featured the entire second half of &quot;Awake&quot;, in celebration of the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, including the song &quot;Space-Dye Vest&quot;, which had never been performed live. The set list closed with a performance of four songs from &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&quot;, in celebration of the album&#x27;s 15th anniversary. The Along for the Ride Tour concluded on October 30, 2014.

=== &quot;The Astonishing&quot; and &quot;Images and Words&quot; anniversary tour (2015–2017) ===
On January 6, 2014, John Petrucci said that Dream Theater were already &quot;planting seeds for album No. 13&quot;. He commented: &quot;There are some song ideas and little things like that -- nothing really official, but the seeds just start to get planted. One of the great things about this career is that you have the opportunity every time to go in and start again with a blank slate and think, &#x27;What can we do differently? How can we make this better? Where can we go from here?&#x27; Every album has a story, and to constantly have a fresh opportunity to do it is really satisfying.&quot;

The band headed into the studio in February 2015 to record its thirteenth album. The album, titled &quot;The Astonishing&quot; was released on January 29, 2016. It is a concept album set in a dystopian future society devoid of real music, centering on a conflict between a group of rebels and an oppressive empire. Two singles, &quot;The Gift of Music&quot; and &quot;Moment of Betrayal&quot; were released on December 3, 2015, and January 22, 2016, respectively.

Throughout 2016, Dream Theater went on a tour titled The Astonishing Live to support the album. They played the album in its entirety, with an intermission between the two acts, only playing songs from earlier albums on occasions later in the tour. Their performance was accompanied by a visual representation of the story on background screens. The band also made it a point to play at indoor theater halls such as Radio City Music Hall. In 2017, Dream Theater went on another tour, titled Images, Words &amp; Beyond, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of &quot;Images and Words&quot;. Each night they performed the album in its entirety, as well as &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;, which was originally written during the &quot;Images and Words&quot; sessions, and other selections from their catalogue.

=== &quot;Distance Over Time&quot; and &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&quot; anniversary tour (2017–2019) ===

In a May 2017 interview with &quot;Rockbook&quot;, frontman James LaBrie talked about the style of the band&#x27;s fourteenth studio album: &quot;It&#x27;s really important for us that the new album will be our best effort. It should be who we are at that particular moment. [...] But if along the way we feel that there is another album we should recognize once again, then we&#x27;ll do it.&quot; In December 2017, Dream Theater announced that they had signed a worldwide longterm deal with Sony Music via Sony&#x27;s progressive music label imprint Inside Out, for the release of the album.

The album was written in June and July 2018, and features pieces written collectively and lyrics written by Petrucci, Labrie, Myung and, for the first time ever, Mangini. In anticipation of the album, the band launched a &quot;treasure hunt&quot; in the form of an alternate reality game, where participants would search for various clues across the internet. The game ultimately led to a site revealing the title of the album to be &quot;Distance Over Time&quot;. The site also revealed the cover art for the album, its scheduled release date in February 2019, as well as dates for a tour in North America celebrating the 20th anniversary of the band&#x27;s fifth album &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&quot;. On November 6, 2018, a press release from Inside Out officially announced &quot;Distance Over Time&quot;, with a release date of February 22, 2019. Upon release, the album received widespread critical acclaim.

=== &quot;A View from the Top of the World&quot; and &quot;Lost Not Forgotten Archives&quot; (2020–2023) ===
In April 2020, Metal Addicts reported that Dream Theater was expected to begin working on their fifteenth studio album in 2021. About the direction of the album, guitarist John Petrucci stated in an August 2020 interview with Ultimate Guitar: &quot;The eight-string project with Ernie Ball Music Man is something we are working on and hoping to have developed as this year goes on. I&#x27;m hoping that on the next Dream Theater record I&#x27;ll be able to explore that.&quot; This would later be confirmed in an interview with Ultimate Guitar in February 2021. Also in August 2020, Petrucci also told Spain&#x27;s &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; that the band would begin working on their new album in the fall. Recording sessions started at DTHQ (the band&#x27;s own studio) in October 2020. The band was confirmed on November 27, 2020, to be writing the songs, while LaBrie was writing his parts back home in Canada. When asked in an interview, Petrucci said that the writing sessions were &quot;off to a great start&quot;.

Petrucci released his first solo album in fifteen years, &quot;Terminal Velocity&quot;, on August 28, 2020. The album was recorded at DTHQ earlier the same year. Its recording sessions marked the first time in ten years that Petrucci worked with his former Dream Theater bandmate Mike Portnoy, who played drums on all tracks from the album. This collaboration led to speculation of a Dream Theater reunion with Portnoy, which was denied by Petrucci, who told &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;: &quot;I understand where people are coming from with that. One of the concerns I had, a little bit – not musically at all – but about Mike, is I didn&#x27;t want people to get the wrong idea.&quot;

On November 27, 2020, Dream Theater released their ninth live album, &quot;Distant Memories – Live in London&quot;, recorded at Hammersmith Apollo prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. On December 1, 2020, the band released the single &quot;The Holiday Spirit Carries On&quot;, a medley of holiday songs played in a progressive metal style, exclusively through Bandcamp. The title references the fan-favorite song &quot;The Spirit Carries On&quot; from &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot;. The proceeds from sales of the single benefited the band&#x27;s road crew. On January 30, 2021, Dream Theater held a special streaming event titled &quot;Images, Words &amp; Beyond Live in Japan&quot;, an online broadcast of a concert from the band&#x27;s 2017 tour, which was originally recorded for Japanese television.

On May 5, 2021, Dream Theater announced a series of albums titled the &quot;Lost Not Forgotten Archives&quot;, the first release of which is the second set of the &quot;Images, Words &amp; Beyond Live in Japan&quot; concert. The band added that the &quot;Lost Not Forgotten Archives&quot; will eventually include every YtseJam Records release on CD, vinyl and digital formats, along with previously unreleased archival material.
Dream Theater teased the new album on July 26, 2021, revealing that it would have seven songs, with more details to be released on July 28, 2021. On July 28, it was announced that the album was titled &quot;A View from the Top of the World&quot;, and it was released on October 22, 2021. The album was supported by five singles, &quot;The Alien&quot;, &quot;Invisible Monster&quot;, &quot;Awaken the Master&quot;, &quot;Transcending Time&quot; and &quot;Answering the Call&quot;, and music videos were released for each of them. The band promoted the album with a concert tour of Europe from April 20 to June 1, 2022. They had previously announced a tour of North America from late October to mid-December 2021 on the same day as the album, but announced on September 27 that it had been rescheduled to early 2022, due to safety concerns related to the COVID pandemic. The rescheduled tour began on February 2, 2022, in Mesa, Arizona.

On April 3, 2022, &quot;The Alien&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, giving Dream Theater their first Grammy.

On June 16, 2023, they started the Dreamsonic Tour, a travelling progressive metal festival which also featured Devin Townsend and Animals as Leaders. The tour ended on July 26.

=== Departure of Mike Mangini, return of Mike Portnoy and &quot;Parasomnia&quot; (2023–present) ===

In August 2023, John Petrucci mentioned that studio time for their sixteenth album was slated to begin in late 2023, though James LaBrie later stated it would be more likely the beginning of 2024. On October 25, 2023, Dream Theater announced the departure of Mike Mangini as they were reuniting with Mike Portnoy. The reunion resulted from years of gradual reconciliation between Portnoy and individual members of the band, as he disclosed in an interview with &quot;Metal Injection&quot;:

&quot;Starting with John Petrucci maybe five, six, seven years ago or so, we just reconnected—John decided he wanted to do a solo album and he asked me to play on it—So I played on John&#x27;s solo album. And then a few months later, we did a Liquid Tension Experiment album with John and Jordan. So that brought the three of us back together—And then I think the final piece was me reconnecting with James LaBrie, &#x27;cause James and I hadn&#x27;t spoken for over a decade. I went to see Dream Theater play [at the Beacon Theatre] in New York, I guess around 2022, and that was my first time seeing James in over a decade. And literally, I&#x27;m not exaggerating, within five seconds of seeing each other, it was hugs, kisses and it was like any of the drama and bullshit that happened during all of those years of the split, it just melted away immediately.&quot;

In a group interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, James LaBrie addressed his and Portnoy&#x27;s reconciliation at the 2022 show, stating: &quot;Mike and I are both very emotional and passionate people. And I think that led to the reason for us not coming together until we did. But as soon as I saw him, like he said, I came out of my dressing room, I saw him, and I was like, &#x27;Come here.&#x27; And I gave him a fucking hug. And that was it.&quot; Petrucci added in the interview that &quot;When Mike left the band, it was traumatic for all of us. We had to figure out how we were going to move our career forward. And those years that went by, they were also healing years because you don’t just have something like that happen, and all of a sudden, you&#x27;re all best buddies a week later. There&#x27;s some trauma there that had to heal. Thirteen years was enough time for that to happen and be like, &#x27;Hey, you know what, man? We love each other like we&#x27;re brothers.&#x27;&quot;

Mangini was amicable about his departure, stating &quot;As was said from day 1, my place was not to fill all the roles that Mike held in the band. I was to play the drums in order to help the band carry on. My main role of keeping our live show working tightly on a nightly basis was an intense and rewarding experience. Thankfully, I got to experience playing music with these iconic musicians, as well as some fun times laced with humor.&quot; With Portnoy&#x27;s return the band announced plans to record its first studio album with him in fifteen years.

On November 17, 2023, the band announced former lead vocalist Charlie Dominici&#x27;s death at the age of 72 that month from unspecified causes.

In February 2024, Mike Portnoy posted pictures from DTHQ on his Instagram account, confirming that the new Dream Theater album was &quot;officially underway&quot;.

On April 2, 2024, John Petrucci and Portnoy announced that all of the writing and the drum tracks were completed. John Petrucci later posted a video on YouTube on May 1, 2024, confirming that the guitar tracks were completed. On June 26, 2024, Jordan Rudess announced on his Instagram that all the keyboards had been recorded. On July 30, 2024, James LaBrie posted on his Instagram, a photo of himself in the studio with the caption &quot;Vocals&quot; with a green check mark, and the hashtag &quot;DT16&quot;, signifying the vocals had been completed for the new album.

On October 10, 2024, Dream Theater released &quot;Night Terror&quot; as the first single for their then-upcoming sixteenth studio album &quot;Parasomnia&quot;, which was released on February 7, 2025. The album was highly anticipated, with several publications (including &quot;Loudwire&quot;, &quot;Stereogum&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Guitar&quot;) naming it in their lists of the most anticipated albums of 2025.

== Live performances ==
Throughout their career, Dream Theater&#x27;s live shows have gradually become bigger, longer and more diverse. Prior to Portnoy&#x27;s departure, Dream Theater &quot;rotated&quot; its set lists to ensure that fans who attended multiple shows in the same area would not see too many (or any) songs repeated. Portnoy, who constructed the set lists, would take into account the set list from the last time the band was in a particular city for the benefit of fans who saw the band on successive tours. The practice was abandoned with Portnoy away from the band, and the setlist remained static even after his return on the 40th anniversary tour, but Portnoy noted that the practice of rotating setlists will return eventually.

The band&#x27;s full world tours, since &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot;, have predominantly been &quot;Evening with...&quot; tours, in which the band performs for at least three hours without an opening act. Until 2012, such tours did not contain an intermission, but every tour since the Along for the Ride Tour in 2013–2014 until the Distance Over Time Tour had. The show that was recorded for &quot;Live Scenes From New York&quot; was well over three hours in length, and resulted in Portnoy almost being hospitalized after acquiring severe food poisoning from the food he ate before the show.

There is also a significant amount of humor, casualness, and improvisation attached to Dream Theater&#x27;s concert. For example, the performance of &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; on &quot;Live Scenes from New York&quot; features changes to a series of instrumental breaks, with Myung playing a baseball organ melody, Petrucci playing the opening theme to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and Rudess playing the ragtime section of &quot;When the Water Breaks&quot; from &quot;Liquid Tension Experiment 2&quot; (the latter is also heard on the album &quot;Live at Budokan&quot;). Several songs included on &quot;Once in a LIVETime&quot; include snippets of others&#x27; pieces, such as Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s &quot;Free Bird&quot; and Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee.&quot; Other quotations include &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; during &quot;Endless Sacrifice&quot; on the Gigantour, a calliope-inspired break between verses of &quot;Under a Glass Moon&quot;, a quote of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me, Argentina&quot;&#x27;s main melody played by Petrucci while performing the intro solo of &quot;Through Her Eyes&quot; in Buenos Aires, the Turkish March at a concert in Istanbul, and the opening riff of Rush&#x27;s &quot;A Passage to Bangkok&quot; at a show in Bangkok, Thailand. On the &quot;20th Anniversary World Tour&quot;, Rudess has even thrown in a short &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot; theme in a break during &quot;Endless Sacrifice,&quot; and during a concert in Israel he started a spontaneous &quot;Hava Nagila&quot;, with the rest of the band later joining in. During the band&#x27;s 2017 tour, a snippet of Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; was played during Dream Theater&#x27;s own song &quot;As I Am&quot;.

Perhaps the best example of Dream Theater&#x27;s unpredictable concert structure came during Derek Sherinian&#x27;s time with the band. At selected shows the band members all swapped instruments and performed an encore as the fictitious band dubbed Nightmare Cinema. They usually performed a cover of Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Perfect Strangers,&quot; and, on one occasion, Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;Suicide Solution,&quot; At some shows, Sherinian, Petrucci and Portnoy would take the stage together under the name &quot;Nicky Lemons and the Migraine Brothers.&quot; Sherinian, wearing a feather boa and novelty sunglasses, would perform a pop-punk song titled &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like You&quot; with Petrucci and Portnoy backing. During the Chaos in Motion tour, in several concerts before &quot;Trial of Tears,&quot; Portnoy and Petrucci would change positions.
In the &quot;Score&quot; and &quot;Chaos in Motion&quot; DVDs, an animation has accompanied certain parts of the songs, showing the band playing along to the music as cartoon characters. On the Score DVD, during the song Octavarium, the band is seen performing in an octagonal shaped maze. As the animation continues Jordan Rudess spontaneously turns into Santa Claus and John Petrucci catches fire. In &quot;The Dark Eternal Night&quot; from the Chaos in Motion DVD, the band battles against a monster by shooting fireballs from guitars, throwing drum sticks, and screaming.

=== Shows and concerts ===
Dream Theater played and recorded a live performance at the Nippon Budokan Hall on April 26, 2004. It was later released as &quot;Live at Budokan&quot; on October 5, 2004.

Dream Theater&#x27;s largest audience as a headlining act was 20,000 in Santiago, Chile on December 6, 2005. The show was released on DVD through Portnoy&#x27;s YtseJam Records.

In 2007, after their show in Salt Lake City on July 30, Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr. signed a proclamation officially marking July 30, 2007 as &quot;Dream Theater Day&quot; in the state of Utah.

In 2008 Dream Theater started the Progressive Nation 2008 tour, along with Opeth, Between the Buried and Me, and 3. The tour is the brainchild of Mike Portnoy, who stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve been wanting to assemble a package tour like this for many years now. With all of the festivals and package tours that go through America, I&#x27;ve been talking with our manager and agent for over 10 years now about doing something that focuses on the more progressive, musician-oriented side of hard rock and metal. I decided it was time to stop talking the talk, lace up and finally walk the walk.&quot;

On February 13, 2009, Dream Theater announced the official line up for their Progressive Nation 2009 tour. The tour was originally set to feature bands including Swedish bands Beardfish and Pain of Salvation, as well as Zappa plays Zappa. On June 22, 2009, Mike Portnoy announced that Pain of Salvation and Beardfish would not be touring the North American leg of the Progressive Nation 2009 tour because of record label complications. In the same announcement, Portnoy stated that the bands Scale the Summit and Bigelf would replace Pain of Salvation and Beardfish on the tour. This lineup change has put Bigelf on both the North American and European legs of the Progressive Nation 2009 tour. The tour&#x27;s North American leg ran throughout July and August 2009. On March 26, 2009, it was announced that Dream Theater would take the Progressive Nation tour to Europe for the first time alongside Opeth, Bigelf and Unexpect. The tour ran throughout September and October 2009.

In June/July 2010 Dream Theater were the opening band for Iron Maiden during the first leg of their Final Frontier Tour which included Madison Square Garden as one of the many venues. On December 7, 2010, Dream Theater announced on their website that they would be headlining the High Voltage Festival alongside Judas Priest in 2011. In July 2011 they started A Dramatic Tour of Events to promote &quot;A Dramatic Turn of Events&quot;. In January 2014, they started the Along for the Ride Tour to promote their self-titled album. On December 13, 2016, Dream Theater confirmed 5 UK tour dates for their Images, Words &amp; Beyond 25th Anniversary Tour, starting in Birmingham on April 18, 2017.

On March 4, 2022, Mike Portnoy attended his first and only Dream Theater show as an audience member at the Beacon Theatre in New York City, taking photos with the band and receiving a shoutout from James LaBrie during the show. The attendance would eventually lead to Portnoy rejoining the band.

On April 22, 2023, Dream Theater announced the first edition of DREAMSONIC, taking place in North America throughout June and July and celebrating the summer&#x27;s ultimate progressive metal line-up. Started in Cedar Park, Texas, on June 16, 2023, they were joined by special guests Devin Townsend and Animals As Leaders. The tour would be Mike Mangini&#x27;s last with the band.

After rejoining Dream Theater, on April 8, 2024, the band announced their first tour with Portnoy in fourteen years, titled the &quot;40th Anniversary Tour 2024 – 2025&quot;, which began with a month-long European leg in October.

== Cover songs ==
Dream Theater have covered other artists&#x27; work throughout their career. They have performed cover songs live and in studio, with many of those live performances being recorded for official release. &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; features Elton John, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Kansas, Queen, Journey, Dixie Dregs and Genesis live covers. Through YtseJam Records, the band have also released full album live cover performances of Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, and Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Made in Japan&quot;. The special edition of &quot;Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings&quot; includes a bonus disc with Rainbow, Queen, Dixie Dregs, Zebra, King Crimson, and Iron Maiden covers. Other notable artists covered by Dream Theater include Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, Pantera, Rush, the Who, and Yes.

== Logo and imagery ==

Despite the band being forced to change their name, Dream Theater adopted a custom logo (known as the &quot;Majesty symbol&quot;) and wordmark, both of which have appeared on most of their promotional material. The Majesty symbol has been featured on the front cover of every Dream Theater studio album, while the wordmark appears on all except &quot;Falling into Infinity.&quot; The Majesty symbol is derived from Mary, Queen of Scots&#x27; mark, which was re-worked by Charlie Dominici for use on the album artwork for &quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot;.

In September 2010, a fan of Dream Theater discovered that all of the letters of &quot;DOMINICI&quot; fit together perfectly into the Majesty symbol. When Charlie discovered this, he laughed and mentioned that &quot;it only took them 25 years to figure out the &#x27;Dominici Code!&#x27;&quot; This has earlier also been discovered as shown on the comment section of DTFAQ and in the DTNorway Podcast Episode 2 from 2008, with Charlie Dominici.

== Musical style ==
AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Dream Theater&#x27;s music as a &quot;dense blend of progressive rock and post-Halen metal&quot;.
The band is well noted for being one of the early progenitors of the progressive metal genre, and they are considered a member of the so-called &quot;big three&quot; of the genre, along with Queensrÿche and Fates Warning. The original members, Mike Portnoy, John Petrucci and John Myung, have strong influences from progressive rock bands such as Rush, Yes, and Pink Floyd, heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, various speed metal bands, and even the glam metal of the day. John Petrucci described Dream Theater&#x27;s musical style as a blend of Rush, Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Yes, and Metallica, while Mike Portnoy described their style as a blend of progressive rock and heavy metal. They encompass the progressive aspect, influenced by Rush, Yes, Pink Floyd, and Genesis, alongside the metal aspect influenced by Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Metallica, and Black Sabbath. When combined, that&#x27;s precisely what characterizes Dream Theater. This synthesis created a unique metal that was not traditional of the day: it had distorted guitars and fast riffing, but the music focused more on technical proficiency and precise execution than on heavy metal riffs. The band&#x27;s music has focused on three main elements: metal, melody, and progressive roots.
In the liner notes for the 2008 &quot;Greatest Hit&quot; compilation, Mike Portnoy cited artists such as Peter Gabriel, U2, and Journey as inspirations for Dream Theater&#x27;s softer songs.
Dream Theater&#x27;s music has also been described as art rock.

Dream Theater&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Train of Thought&quot; showcased a heavier sound. This decision was inspired by the positive feedback received from their previous heavier songs on stage.
1999&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&quot; was praised for its display of old-fashioned progressive rock, and was influenced by classic conceptual rock records such as the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, the Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot;, and Genesis&#x27;s &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;.

Dream Theater&#x27;s music usually borrows elements from other musical styles including symphonic rock, symphonic metal, , soft rock, and classical music.

Notes
* Chris Collins was the shortest-serving band member, having only been an official member for a few months; first joining them at the same time as Kevin Moore in the summer of 1986, but parting ways after they did some initial touring following recording their 6-track demo.
* In the wake of Charlie Dominici&#x27;s departure from the band in October and November 1989 the band worked with several singers on a temporary basis before fully committing to James LaBrie; they first worked with John Arch, though he was not seriously considering joining the band, then John Hendricks, then Steve Stone (who had a one-off live appearance with the band), then finally Chris Cintron, who they were ready to commit to and officially welcome into the band before LaBrie&#x27;s audition arrived.
* During the 1997–1998 world tour, the band would switch their instruments around for brief &quot;Nightmare Cinema&quot; interludes in the concerts; John Myung played the keyboard, Derek Sherinian played the guitar, John Petrucci played the drums, and Mike Portnoy played the bass. They would often cover &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; by Deep Purple during these segments.
* In 2004, Charlie Dominici and Derek Sherinian joined the band as a one-off on stage during the encore of the March 6th show as guests, to celebrate the 15th anniversary of &quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot;. This was documented on &quot;When Dream And Day Reunite&quot;.
