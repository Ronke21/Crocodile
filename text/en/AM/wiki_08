<text>Rigoletto is an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi. The Italian libretto was written by Francesco Maria Piave based on the 1832 play &quot;Le roi s&#x27;amuse&quot; by Victor Hugo. Despite serious initial problems with the Austrian censors who had control over northern Italian theatres at the time, the opera had a triumphant premiere at La Fenice in Venice on 11 March 1851.

The work, Verdi&#x27;s sixteenth in the genre, is widely considered to be the first of the operatic masterpieces of Verdi&#x27;s middle-to-late career. Its tragic story revolves around the licentious Duke of Mantua, his hunch-backed court jester Rigoletto, and Rigoletto&#x27;s daughter Gilda. The opera&#x27;s original title, &quot;La maledizione&quot; (The Curse), refers to a curse placed on both the Duke and Rigoletto by the Count Monterone, whose daughter the Duke has seduced with Rigoletto&#x27;s encouragement. The curse comes to fruition when Gilda falls in love with the Duke and sacrifices her life to save him from the assassin hired by her father.

==Composition history==

La Fenice of Venice commissioned Verdi in 1850 to compose a new opera. He was prominent enough by this time to enjoy some freedom in choosing texts to set to music. He initially asked Francesco Maria Piave (with whom he had already created &quot;Ernani&quot;, &quot;I due Foscari&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Il corsaro&quot; and &quot;Stiffelio&quot;) to examine the play &quot;Kean&quot; by Alexandre Dumas, père, but soon came to believe that they needed to find a more energetic subject.

That came in the form of Victor Hugo&#x27;s controversial five-act play &quot;Le roi s&#x27;amuse&quot; (&quot;The king amuses himself&quot;). Verdi later explained that &quot;The subject is grand, immense, and there is a character that is one of the greatest creations that the theatre can boast of, in any country and in all history.&quot; However, Hugo&#x27;s depiction of a venal, cynical, womanizing king (Francis I of France) was considered unacceptably scandalous. The play had been banned in France following its premiere nearly twenty years earlier (not to be staged again until 1882); now it was to come before the Austrian Board of Censors (as Austria at that time directly controlled much of Northern Italy.)

From the beginning, both composer and librettist knew this step would not be easy. As Verdi wrote in a letter to Piave: &quot;Use four legs, run through the town and find me an influential person who can obtain the permission for making &quot;Le Roi s&#x27;amuse&quot;.&quot; Guglielmo Brenna, secretary of La Fenice, promised the duo that they would not have problems with the censors. He was wrong, and rumours began to spread in early summer that the production would be forbidden. In August, Verdi and Piave retired to Busseto, Verdi&#x27;s hometown, to prepare a defensive scheme as they continued work on the opera. Despite their best efforts, including frantic correspondence with La Fenice, the Austrian censor De Gorzkowski emphatically denied consent to the production of &quot;La Maledizione&quot; (its working title) in a December 1850 letter, calling the opera &quot;a repugnant [example of] immorality and obscene triviality.&quot;

Piave set to work revising the libretto, eventually pulling from it another opera, &quot;Il Duca di Vendome&quot;, in which the sovereign was a duke and both the hunchback and the curse disappeared. Verdi was completely against this proposed solution, preferring to negotiate directly with the censors over each and every point of the work. Brenna, La Fenice&#x27;s sympathetic secretary, mediated the dispute by showing the Austrians some letters and articles depicting the bad character, but great value, of the artist. By January 1851 the parties had settled on a compromise: the action of the opera would be moved, and some of the characters would be renamed. In the new version, the Duke would preside over Mantua and belong to the Gonzaga family. (The House of Gonzaga had long been extinct by the mid-19th century, and the Dukedom of Mantua no longer existed.) The scene in which he retired to Gilda&#x27;s bedroom would be deleted, and his visit to the &quot;Taverna&quot; (inn) would no longer be intentional, but the result of a trick. The hunchbacked jester (originally called Triboulet) was renamed Rigoletto (from the French word &quot;rigoler&quot;) from a parody of a comedy by Jules-Édouard Alboize de Pujol: &quot;Rigoletti, ou Le dernier des fous&quot; (Rigoletti, or The last of the fools) of 1835. By 14 January, the opera&#x27;s definitive title had become &quot;Rigoletto&quot;.

Verdi finally completed the composition on 5 February 1851, a little more than a month before the premiere. Piave had already arranged for the sets to be designed while Verdi was still working on the final stages of act 3. The singers were given some of their music to learn on 7 February. However, Verdi kept at least a third of the score at Busseto. He brought it with him when he arrived in Venice for the rehearsals on 19 February, and would continue refining the orchestration throughout the rehearsal period. For the première, La Fenice had cast Felice Varesi as Rigoletto, the tenor Raffaele Mirate as the Duke, and Teresa Brambilla as Gilda (although Verdi would have preferred Teresa De Giuli Borsi). Due to a high risk of unauthorised copying, Verdi demanded extreme secrecy from all his singers and musicians, particularly Mirate: the &quot;Duke&quot; had the use of his score for only a few evenings before the première, and was made to swear that he would not sing or even whistle the tune of &quot;La donna è mobile&quot; except during rehearsal.

== Performance history ==

=== 19th-century productions ===
&quot;Rigoletto&quot; premiered on 11 March 1851 in a sold-out La Fenice as the first part of a double bill with Giacomo Panizza&#x27;s ballet &quot;Faust&quot;. Gaetano Mares conducted, and the sets were designed and executed by Giuseppe Bertoja and Francesco Bagnara. The opening night was a complete triumph, especially the &quot;scena drammatica&quot; and the Duke&#x27;s cynical aria, &quot;La donna è mobile&quot;, which was sung in the streets the next morning (Verdi had maximised the aria&#x27;s impact by only revealing it to the cast and orchestra a few hours before the premiere, and forbidding them to sing, whistle or even think of the melody outside of the theatre). Many years later, Giulia Cora Varesi, the daughter of Felice Varesi (the original Rigoletto), described her father&#x27;s performance at the premiere. Varesi was very uncomfortable with the false hump he had to wear; he was so uncertain that, even though he was quite an experienced singer, he had a panic attack when it was his turn to enter the stage. Verdi immediately realised he was paralysed and roughly pushed him on the stage, so he appeared with a clumsy tumble. The audience, thinking it was an intentional gag, was very amused.

&quot;Rigoletto&quot; was a great box-office success for La Fenice and Verdi&#x27;s first major Italian triumph since the 1847 premiere of &quot;Macbeth&quot; in Florence. It initially had a run of 13 performances and was revived in Venice the following year, and again in 1854. Despite a rather disastrous production in Bergamo shortly after its initial run at La Fenice, the opera soon entered the repertory of Italian theatres. By 1852, it had premiered in all the major cities of Italy, although sometimes under different titles due to the vagaries of censorship (e.g. as &quot;Viscardello&quot;, &quot;Lionello&quot;, and &quot;Clara de Perth&quot;). From 1852, it also began to be performed in major cities worldwide, reaching as far afield as Alexandria and Constantinople in 1854 and both Montevideo and Havana in 1855. The UK premiere took place on 14 May 1853 at what is now the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London with Giovanni Matteo Mario as the Duke of Mantua and Giorgio Ronconi as Rigoletto, conducted by Michael Costa. In the US, the opera was first seen on 19 February 1855 at New York&#x27;s Academy of Music in a performance by the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company.

=== 20th century and beyond ===
Several modern productions have radically changed the original setting. These include Jonathan Miller&#x27;s 1982 production for the English National Opera, which is set amongst the Mafia in New York City&#x27;s Little Italy during the 1950s; Doris Dörrie&#x27;s 2005 production for the Bavarian State Opera, where the Court of Mantua became The Planet of the Apes; director Linda Brovsky&#x27;s production for Seattle Opera, placing the story in Mussolini&#x27;s fascist Italy, in 2004 (repeated in 2014); and Michael Mayer&#x27;s 2013 production for the Metropolitan Opera, which is set in a casino in 1960s Las Vegas. Different characters portray different archetypes from the Rat Pack era, with the Duke becoming a Frank Sinatra-type character and Rigoletto becoming Don Rickles. In March 2014, Lindy Hume, artistic director of Australia&#x27;s Opera Queensland staged the opera set in the party-going world of disgraced former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.

== Roles ==

== Synopsis ==
:Place: Mantua
:Time: the sixteenth century

=== Act 1 ===
&quot;Scene 1: Mantua. A magnificent hall in the ducal palace. Doors at the back open into other rooms, splendidly lit up. A crowd of lords and ladies in grand costumes are seen walking about in the rear rooms; page boys come and go. The festivities are at their height. Music is heard from offstage. The Duke and Borsa enter from a door in the back.&quot;

At a ball in his palace, the Duke sings of a life of pleasure with as many women as possible, and mentions that he particularly enjoys cuckolding his courtiers: &quot;Questa o quella&quot; (&quot;This woman or that&quot;). He mentions to Borsa that he has seen an unknown beauty in church and desires to possess her, but he also wishes to seduce the Countess of Ceprano. Rigoletto, the Duke&#x27;s hunchbacked court jester, mocks the husbands of the ladies to whom the Duke is paying attention, including the Count Ceprano. He humorously advises the Duke to get rid of Count Ceprano by prison, exile, or death. The Duke laughs indulgently, but Ceprano is not amused. Marullo, one of the guests at the ball, informs the courtiers that Rigoletto has a &quot;lover&quot;, which astonishes them. (Marullo is not aware that the &quot;lover&quot; is actually Rigoletto&#x27;s daughter.) The courtiers, at Ceprano&#x27;s suggestion, resolve to take vengeance on Rigoletto for making fun of them. The festivities are interrupted by the arrival of the elderly Count Monterone, whose daughter the Duke had seduced. Rigoletto provokes him further by making fun of his helplessness to avenge his daughter&#x27;s honor. Monterone confronts the Duke, and is immediately arrested by the Duke&#x27;s guards. Before being led off to prison, Monterone curses both the Duke for the attack on his daughter and Rigoletto for having mocked his righteous anger. The curse terrifies Rigoletto, who believes the popular superstition that an old man&#x27;s curse has real power.

&quot;Scene 2: The end of a dead-end street. On the left, a house of discreet appearance with one small courtyard surrounded by walls. In the yard there is one tall tree and a marble seat; in the wall, a door that leads to the street; above the wall, a terrace supported by arches. The second floor door opens on to the said terrace, which can also be reached by a staircase in front. To the right of the street is the very high wall of the garden and a side of the Ceprano palace. It is night.&quot;

Preoccupied with the old man&#x27;s curse, Rigoletto approaches the house where he is concealing his daughter from the world and is accosted by the assassin Sparafucile, who walks up to him and offers his services. Rigoletto declines for the moment, but leaves open the possibility of hiring Sparafucile later, should the need arise. Sparafucile wanders off, after repeating his own name a few times. Rigoletto contemplates the similarities between the two of them: &quot;Pari siamo!&quot; (&quot;We are alike!&quot;); Sparafucile kills men with his sword, and Rigoletto uses &quot;a tongue of malice&quot; to stab his victims. Rigoletto opens a door in the wall and embraces his daughter Gilda. They greet each other warmly: &quot;Figlia!&quot; &quot;Mio padre!&quot; (&quot;Daughter!&quot; &quot;My father!&quot;). Rigoletto has been concealing his daughter from the Duke and the rest of the city, and she does not know her father&#x27;s occupation. Since he has forbidden her to appear in public, she has been nowhere except to church and does not even know her own father&#x27;s name.

When Rigoletto has gone, the Duke appears and overhears Gilda confess to her nurse Giovanna that she feels guilty for not having told her father about a young man she had met at the church. She says that she fell in love with him, but that she would love him even more if he were a student and poor. As she declares her love, the Duke enters, overjoyed. Gilda, alarmed, calls for Giovanna, unaware that the Duke had given her money to go away. Pretending to be a student, the Duke convinces Gilda of his love: &quot;È il sol dell&#x27;anima&quot; (&quot;Love is the sunshine of the soul&quot;). When she asks for his name, he hesitantly calls himself Gualtier Maldè. Hearing sounds and fearing that her father has returned, Gilda sends the Duke away after they quickly trade vows of love: &quot;Addio, addio&quot; (&quot;Farewell, farewell&quot;). Alone, Gilda meditates on her love for the Duke, who she believes is a student: &quot;Gualtier Maldè!... Caro nome che il mio cor&quot; (&quot;Dearest name&quot;).

Later, Rigoletto returns: &quot;Riedo!... perché?&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ve returned!... why?&quot;), while the hostile courtiers outside the walled garden (believing Gilda to be the jester&#x27;s mistress, unaware she is his daughter) get ready to abduct the helpless girl. They tell Rigoletto that they are actually abducting the Countess Ceprano. He sees that they are masked and asks for a mask for himself; while they are tying the mask onto his face, they also blindfold him. Blindfolded and deceived, he holds the ladder steady while they climb up to Gilda&#x27;s room: Chorus: &quot;Zitti, zitti&quot; (&quot;Softly, softly&quot;). With her father&#x27;s unknowing assistance Gilda is carried away by the courtiers. Left alone, Rigoletto removes his mask and blindfold, and realizes that it was in fact Gilda who was carried away. He collapses in despair, remembering the old man&#x27;s curse.

=== Act 2 ===
&quot;A room in the ducal palace. There are doors on both sides as well as a larger one at the far end by the sides of which hang full length portraits of the Duke and his wife. There is one high-backed chair at a table covered with velvet and other furnishings.&quot;

The Duke is concerned that Gilda has disappeared: &quot;Ella mi fu rapita!&quot; (&quot;She was stolen from me!&quot;) and &quot;Parmi veder le lagrime&quot; (&quot;I seem to see tears&quot;). The courtiers then enter and inform him that they have captured Rigoletto&#x27;s mistress: Chorus: &quot;Scorrendo uniti&quot; (&quot;We went together at nightfall&quot;). By their description, he recognizes it to be Gilda and rushes off to the room where she is held: &quot;Possente amor mi chiama&quot; (&quot;Mighty love beckons me&quot;). Rigoletto enters singing and feigning nonchalance, but also looking anxiously for any trace of Gilda, who he fears may have fallen into the hands of the Duke. The courtiers pretend not to notice his anxiety, but quietly laugh at him with each other. A page arrives with a message from the Duke&#x27;s wife – the Duchess wishes to speak to her husband – but the courtiers reply suggestively that the Duke cannot be disturbed at the moment. Rigoletto realizes this must mean that Gilda is with the Duke. To the courtiers&#x27; surprise, he reveals that Gilda is his daughter. He first demands, then tearfully pleads with the courtiers to return her to him: &quot;Cortigiani, vil razza dannata&quot; (&quot;Accursed race of courtiers&quot;). Rigoletto attempts to run into the room in which Gilda is being held, but the courtiers block his way. After a time, Gilda enters, and Rigoletto orders the courtiers to leave him alone with her. The courtiers leave the room, believing Rigoletto has gone mad. Gilda describes to her father what has happened to her in the palace: &quot;Tutte le feste al tempio&quot; (&quot;On all the holy days&quot;) and he attempts to console her. Monterone is led across the room on the way to prison and pauses in front of the portrait of the Duke to regret that his curse on the libertine has had no effect. As the guards lead Monterone away, Rigoletto mutters that the old man is mistaken; he, Rigoletto, the dishonored buffoon, shall make thunder and lightning rain from heaven onto the offender&#x27;s head. He repeats this vow as Gilda pleads for mercy for her lover the Duke: Duet:&quot;Sì! Vendetta, tremenda vendetta!&quot; (&quot;Yes! Revenge, terrible revenge!&quot;).

=== Act 3 ===
&quot;The right bank of the river Mincio. On the left is a two-story house, half ruined. Through a large arch on the ground floor a rustic tavern can be seen as well as a rough stone staircase that leads to an attic room with a small bed which is in full view as there are no shutters. In the wall downstairs that faces the street is a door that opens to the inside. The wall is so full of holes and cracks that everything that happens inside is easily seen from the exterior. At the back of the stage are deserted areas by the river which flows behind a parapet that has half collapsed into ruins. Beyond the river is Mantua. It is night. Gilda and Rigoletto, both uneasy, are standing in the road; Sparafucile is seated at a table in the tavern.&quot;
A portion of Sparafucile&#x27;s house is seen, with two rooms open to the view of the audience. Rigoletto and Gilda arrive outside. The Duke&#x27;s voice can be heard from inside, singing &quot;La donna è mobile&quot; (&quot;Woman is fickle&quot;). Sparafucile&#x27;s sister, Maddalena, has lured him to the house. Rigoletto and Gilda listen from outside as the Duke flirts with Maddalena. Gilda laments that the Duke is unfaithful; Rigoletto assures her that he is arranging revenge: &quot;Bella figlia dell&#x27;amore&quot; (&quot;Beautiful daughter of love&quot;).

Rigoletto orders Gilda to put on a man&#x27;s clothes to prepare to leave for Verona and tells her that he plans to follow later. After she leaves, he completes his bargain with the assassin, who is ready to murder his guest for 20 scudi. Rigoletto then withdraws.

With falling darkness, a thunderstorm approaches and the Duke decides to spend the rest of the night in the house. Sparafucile directs him to the upstairs sleeping quarters, resolving to kill him in his sleep.

Gilda, who still loves the Duke despite knowing him to be unfaithful, returns dressed as a man and stands outside the house. Maddalena, who is smitten with the Duke, begs Sparafucile to spare his life: &quot;È amabile invero cotal giovinotto/ Ah, più non ragiono!&quot;. Sparafucile, a man of his word, is reluctant but promises her that if by midnight another victim can be found, he will kill the other instead of the Duke. Gilda, overhearing this exchange, resolves to sacrifice herself for the Duke, and enters the house: &quot;Trio: Se pria ch&#x27;abbia il mezzo la notte toccato&quot;. Sparafucile stabs her and she collapses, mortally wounded.

At midnight, when Rigoletto arrives with money, he receives a corpse wrapped in a sack, and rejoices in his triumph. Weighting it with stones, he is about to cast the sack into the river when he hears the voice of the Duke, sleepily singing a reprise of his &quot;La donna è mobile&quot; aria. Bewildered, Rigoletto opens the sack and, to his despair, discovers his dying daughter. For a moment, she revives and declares she is glad to die for her beloved: &quot;V&#x27;ho ingannato&quot; (&quot;Father, I deceived you&quot;). She dies in his arms. Rigoletto cries out in horror: &quot;La maledizione!&quot; (&quot;The curse!&quot;)

==Instrumentation==
The orchestra calls for 2 flutes (Flute 2 doubles piccolo), 2 oboes (Oboe 2 doubles English horn), 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns in E♭, D, C, A♭, G, and F, 2 trumpets in C, D, and E♭, 3 trombones, cimbasso, timpani, bass drum and cymbals, strings.
* Offstage: Banda, bass drum, 2 bells, thunder machine
* Onstage: Violins I and II, violas, and contrabasses

==Music==
The short orchestral preludio is based on the theme of the curse, intoned quietly on brass at first and building in intensity until it bursts into a passionate outcry by the full orchestra, subsiding once more and ending with repeated drum rolls alternating with brass, cumulatively increasing in volume to come to a somber conclusion. At curtain rise, great contrast is immediately felt as jolly dance music is played by an offstage band while the Duke and his courtiers have a lighthearted conversation. The Duke sings the cynical &quot;Questa o quella&quot; to a flippant tune and then further contrast is again achieved as he attempts to seduce the Countess Ceprano while the strings of a chamber orchestra onstage play an elegant minuet. The off stage dance music resumes as an ensemble builds between Rigoletto, the angry courtiers and the Duke, interrupted by the furious entry of Monterone. Slithery effects in the strings accompany Rigoletto as he brutally mocks the old man, who responds with his curse, leading to a final dramatic ensemble.

In its great variety of tone and texture, its use of instrumental resources (the orchestra in the pit, an offstage band, and a chamber ensemble of strings on the stage), its dramatic pacing and the way the music is continuous rather than consisting of one &quot;number&quot; after another, this concise opening scene is unprecedented in Italian opera.

The duet between Rigoletto and Sparafucile that opens the second scene of the first act is also unprecedented in its structure, being a free-ranging dialogue with melodies not in the voices but in the orchestra, on a solo cello, solo bass, and low woodwinds to create a distinctive sinister atmosphere.

The famous quartet in act three is actually a double duet with each of the characters given a musical identity—the ardent wooing of the Duke, with the main melody, as Maddalena laughingly puts him off, while outside Gilda has a sobbing figure in her vocal line and her father implacably urges revenge. 

Victor Hugo resented his play, which had been banned in France, being transformed into an Italian opera and considered it plagiarism (there were no copyright restrictions against this at the time). When Hugo attended a performance of the opera in Paris, however, he marveled at the way Verdi&#x27;s music in the quartet allowed the emotions of the four different characters to be heard together and yet distinguished clearly from each other at the same time and wished that he could achieve such an effect in a spoken drama.

The section following the quartet, marked &quot;Scena e Terzetto Tempesta&quot; (scene and storm trio) is also, as Julian Budden has written,&quot;without any antecedent&quot;. Very different from the storm music that can be heard in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot; or &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;, that of the storm in &quot;Rigoletto&quot; is not an interlude between acts or scenes, but is totally integrated into the unfolding of the plot, with its strings in the bass register, its interventions of oboe and piccolo, and especially the male chorus behind the scenes humming through closed mouths to create the sound of the wind, a completely original effect. Composer and professor of experimental music Dieter Schnebel (1930–2018) wrote of this scene

The central storm scene is, so to speak, a film with sound, whose moving images show an exterior and interior drama. The furtive encounters between people in the darkness, irregularly broken by lightning, are exposed by the empty fifths, the tremolos of strings, the brief breakthroughs of the wind instruments, the thunderclaps and the sinister sighs of the chorus, which express as well an external process that is internal: death arrives with thunderclaps. The music always passes in this scene from jerky recitatives to fluid arias...

Musicologist Julian Budden regards the opera as &quot;revolutionary&quot;, just as Beethoven&#x27; &quot;Eroica&quot; Symphony was: &quot;the barriers between formal melody and recitative are down as never before. In the whole opera, there is only one conventional double aria [...and there are...] no concerted act finales.&quot; Verdi used that same word—&quot;revolutionary&quot;—in a letter to Piave, and Budden also refers to a letter which Verdi wrote in 1852 in which the composer states that &quot;I conceived &quot;Rigoletto&quot; almost without arias, without finales but only an unending string of duets.&quot;

Budden&#x27;s conclusions about this opera and its place in Verdi&#x27;s output are summed up by noting that:

Just after 1850 at the age of 38 Verdi closed the door on a period of Italian opera with &quot;Rigoletto&quot;. The so-called &quot;ottocento&quot; in music is finished. Verdi will continue to draw on certain of its forms for the next few operas, but in a totally new spirit.

== Critical reception ==
Although immensely successful with audiences from the beginning, many critics in various countries condemned the work for its dark and bitterly tragic plot combined with a succession of mere popular tunes, as they thought of the music. After the first performance in Venice in 1851 the &quot;Gazzetta ufficiale di Venezia&quot; deplored the fact that in his opinion the libretto was inspired by &quot;the Satanic school&quot; and Verdi and Piave had sought beauty from the &quot;deformed and repulsive&quot;.

Typical of critical reaction in Britain, Austria and Germany was the review in the &quot;Frankfurter Nachrichten&quot; of July 24, 1859: &quot;It is well known that this shoddy work presents all the vices and virtues of Verdi&#x27;s music: light music, pleasant dance rhythms for frightful scenes; that death and corruption are represented as in all the works of this composer by galops and party favours.&quot;

In the second half of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, &quot;Rigoletto&quot; has received high praise even from avant-garde and experimental composers such as Luigi Dallapiccola, Luciano Berio and Ernst Krenek. Igor Stravinsky wrote &quot;I say that in the aria &#x27;La donna è mobile&#x27;, for example, which the elite thinks only brilliant and superficial, there is more substance and feeling than in the whole of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; cycle.&quot;

== Recordings and adaptations ==
There have been dozens of commercial recordings of &quot;Rigoletto&quot;. The earliest ones include the 1912 performance in French with François Ruhlmann conducting the orchestra and chorus of the Opéra Comique (Pathé) and the 1916 performance in Italian with Lorenzo Molajoli conducting the orchestra and chorus of La Scala (Columbia Records). The first LP edition of &quot;Rigoletto&quot; (also the first opera recording on LP) was released by RCA Victor in 1950 conducted by Renato Cellini and featured Leonard Warren in the title role. The opera has also been recorded in German with Wilhelm Schüchter conducting the orchestra and chorus of the Berlin State Opera in a 1953 recording for EMI Records and in English with Mark Elder conducting the orchestra and chorus of the English National Opera in a 1983 recording for EMI. In the 21st century there have been several live performances released on DVD including a 2001 performance from London&#x27;s Royal Opera House with Paolo Gavanelli as Rigoletto and Marcelo Álvarez as the Duke (BBC/Opus Arte) and a 2006 performance at the Opernhaus Zürich with Leo Nucci as Rigoletto and Piotr Beczała as The Duke (ArtHaus Musik). The Duke of Mantua&#x27;s arias, particularly &quot;La donna è mobile&quot; and &quot;Questa o quella&quot;, have long been showcases for the tenor voice and appear on numerous recital discs. Amongst Enrico Caruso&#x27;s earliest recordings are both these arias, recorded with piano accompaniment in 1902 and again in 1908 with orchestra. Luciano Pavarotti, who has recorded the arias for several recital discs, also sings the role of the Duke on three complete studio recordings of the opera: Decca (1971) conducted by Richard Bonynge; Decca (1989) conducted by Riccardo Chailly and Deutsche Grammophon (1993) conducted by James Levine.
&quot;Rigoletto&quot; has been a popular subject for movies since the silent film era. On 15 April 1923, Lee de Forest presented 18 short films in his sound-on-film process Phonofilm, including an excerpt of act 2 of &quot;Rigoletto&quot; with Eva Leoni and Company. One of the most famous films based on the opera is the 1987 film by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle starring Luciano Pavarotti as The Duke and Ingvar Wixell as Rigoletto. Some film versions are based on the opera&#x27;s plot, but do not use Verdi&#x27;s music. Curtiss Clayton&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;Rick&quot;, set in modern-day New York, has a plot based on &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, but apart from &quot;La donna è mobile&quot; heard in the background during a restaurant scene, does not include any other music from the opera. In the 21st century, the opera was filmed as &quot;Rigoletto Story&quot; directed by Vittorio Sgarbi with costumes by Vivienne Westwood. First screened at the Venice Biennale in 2004, it subsequently received two Grammy nominations. In September 2010, RAI Television filmed the opera on location in Mantua with the court scenes taking place in the Palazzo Te. The film faithfully followed Verdi&#x27;s original specification for the action to take place over two days, and each act was performed at the time of day indicated in the libretto. Broadcast live to 148 countries, the film starred Plácido Domingo in the title role, and Vittorio Grigolo as The Duke. The plot of the film &quot;Quartet&quot; revolves around the quartet &quot;Bella figlia dell&#x27;amore&quot;, with which the film concludes.

Adaptations of the opera&#x27;s music include Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto Paraphrase&quot;, a piano transcription of &quot;Bella figlia dell&#x27;amore&quot; (the famous quartet from act 3) and a Fantasia on &quot;Rigoletto&quot; (Op.82) by Sigismond Thalberg which was published in Paris in the 1860s.

<text>The Xukuru (Xucuru) are an indigenous people of Brazil, with a population of approximately 8,500, living in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. They have recently gained governmental recognition of their rights to their indigenous homeland in the Ororubá Mountains, though this has brought them into conflict with the local settler population of the region. In 1998, a Xukuru leader, Chicão (Francisco Lacerda, also Cacique Xikão), was assassinated, apparently because of his opposition to the encroachment of ranchers in Xukuru territory. However his children carried on his legacy.

An extensive ethnography has been written by Hohenthal (1954).

<text>Pete Sampras (born August 12, 1971) is an American former professional tennis player. One of the most successful tennis players of all time, he was ranked as the world No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 286 weeks (third-most of all time), and finished as the year-end No. 1 six consecutive times. Sampras won 64 ATP Tour-level singles titles, including 14 men&#x27;s singles majors, which was an all-time record at the time of his retirement: seven Wimbledon Championships, two Australian Opens and an Open Era joint-record five US Opens. He also won five Tour Finals, two Grand Slam Cups, eleven Masters events, and was part of the winning United States Davis Cup teams in 1992 and 1995.

A teen phenom, Sampras became the youngest male singles champion at the US Open in 1990 shortly after turning 19. He claimed his first Wimbledon title in 1993, and would win the title seven times in an eight-year span. Sampras remained the best player for the rest of the decade, finishing each year as No. 1 for a record six consecutive seasons. Following a decline in form at the turn of the century, Sampras claimed his 14th and last major at the 2002 US Open over long-time rival and compatriot Andre Agassi, and retired from the sport thereafter, aged 31.

Sampras was a major practitioner of the serve-and-volley style of tennis. His precise and powerful serve, regarded as one of the best in the sport&#x27;s history, earned him the nickname &quot;Pistol Pete&quot;. In 2007, he was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Pete Sampras was born on August 12, 1971, in Washington, D.C. He is the third child of Soterios &quot;Sammy&quot; and Georgia (née Vroustouris) Sampras. His father was born in the United States to a Greek father, Costas &quot;Gus&quot; Sampras, and a Polish-Jewish mother, Sarah Steinberg. His mother is also Greek; when she was 19, she immigrated to the United States from the village of Sellasia in Sparta. Sampras attended regular services of the Greek Orthodox Church on Sundays. His mother would pray for him every day,&quot; she said. &quot;Somebody is watching you up there, no matter what you are doing.&#x27; Things happen&quot; At the age of 3, he discovered a tennis racket in the basement of his home and spent hours hitting balls against the wall.

In 1978, the Sampras family moved to Palos Verdes, California, and the warmer climate there allowed the seven year-old Sampras to play tennis for most of the year. From early on, his great idol was Rod Laver, and at the age of 11, Sampras met and played tennis with the legend. The Sampras family joined the Jack Kramer Club, and it was here that Sampras&#x27;s talent became apparent. As a teenager, Sampras trained with tennis coach Robert Lansdorp. The forehand he learned from Lansdorp was the same forehand he used throughout his career. The key was an emphasis on driving through the ball and not hitting extreme topspin. He was spotted by Dr. Peter Fischer, a pediatrician and tennis enthusiast, who coached Sampras until 1989. Fischer was responsible for converting Sampras&#x27;s double-handed backhand to single-hand with the goal of being better prepared to win Wimbledon.

==Professional career==

===1988: Turning professional===
Sampras turned professional in 1988, at the age of 16, and finished the year ranked world No. 97 after starting the year at No. 893. His first professional match was a loss to Sammy Giammalva Jr. at the February Ebel U.S. Pro Indoor in Philadelphia. However, just one week later, at the Lipton International Players Championships in Miami, Sampras defeated two top-40 players, before losing to No. 18 Emilio Sánchez. He did not defeat another top-40 player for almost six months, at which point he defeated No. 39 Michiel Schapers at a US Open warm-up tournament in Rye Brook, New York. In his first Grand Slam singles match, Sampras lost to No. 69 Jaime Yzaga of Peru in the first round of the US Open. Sampras did not advance past the quarterfinals in his next three tournaments, although he did record wins over No. 79 Jim Courier in their first career match-up, along with defeating No. 8 Tim Mayotte.

===1989: First major match wins===
The following year, Sampras slightly improved his ranking to a year-ending No. 81. He lost in the first round of the 1989 Australian Open to Christian Saceanu and, at that year&#x27;s French Open, won a Grand Slam singles match for the first time in his career; in the second round he lost to eventual champion and fellow American teenager Michael Chang in their first career match-up. A few weeks later, Sampras lost in the first round of Wimbledon to Todd Woodbridge. At the US Open, Sampras defeated defending champion and fifth-seeded Mats Wilander in the second round before losing to No. 13 Jay Berger in the fourth round. To end the year, Sampras lost in the first round in four consecutive tournaments.

===1990: US Open champion===
He lost to Wilander in the quarterfinals of the tournament in Sydney. At the Australian Open, Sampras upset twelfth-ranked Mayotte in the first round before losing to thirteenth-ranked Yannick Noah in the fourth round in four sets. His first professional singles title came in February at the Ebel U.S. Pro Indoor in Philadelphia, where he defeated sixth-ranked Andre Agassi, eighth-ranked Mayotte, and eighteenth-ranked Andrés Gómez in the final. This title elevated his ranking into the top 20 for the first time. Sampras finished 1990 at No. 5, having started the year ranked No. 61 just prior to the start of the Australian Open.

Sampras did not play in the 1990 French Open and again lost in the first round of Wimbledon, this time to Christo van Rensburg. Sampras played seven consecutive weeks during the North American summer hard-court season. He defeated John McEnroe in the quarterfinals of the Canadian Open, but then lost to Chang in the semifinals. He also reached the semifinals of the tournament in Los Angeles, where he lost to No. 2 Stefan Edberg. He did not advance past the quarterfinals in his next three tournaments, losing to Chang, Richey Reneberg, and Goran Ivanišević.

In September, Sampras (youngest male player ever) captured his first Grand Slam title, at the US Open. Along the way, he defeated sixth-ranked Thomas Muster in the fourth round and third-ranked Ivan Lendl in a five-set quarterfinal, breaking Lendl&#x27;s streak of eight consecutive US Open finals. He then defeated 20th-ranked McEnroe in a four-set semifinal to set up a final with fourth-ranked Agassi. Sampras beat Agassi in straight sets to become the US Open&#x27;s youngest-ever male singles champion at the age of 19 years and 28 days. He played five more tournaments and won the Grand Slam Cup to complete his year.

===1991: Year-end title===

In 1991, Sampras captured the first of his five career titles at the year-end Tennis Masters Cup. Upon entering the US Open as the defending champion that year, he caused controversy when, after losing in the quarterfinals to Jim Courier, Sampras said that he was not disappointed and felt relieved that the pressure to defend his title was no longer on him. This led to widespread criticism, which included disparaging remarks from Courier and Jimmy Connors.

===1992: First Masters title===
In 1992, Sampras reached the quarterfinals of the French Open for the first of three consecutive years, made it to the Wimbledon semifinals, and was the runner-up at the US Open to Stefan Edberg. Sampras later stated that his loss in the US Open final that year was a &quot;wake-up call&quot; and that he needed to figure out how to become the world No. 1. He also played doubles with John McEnroe on the US team that won the Davis Cup on home soil, beating Switzerland 3-1.

1992 was also the year when Sampras made his only competitive appearance at the Olympics. The event was played on clay, his worst surface. Nonetheless, Sampras advanced to the third round before giving up a two-set lead and losing to Andrei Cherkasov of Russia.

===1993: Two major titles, world No. 1 ===
Sampras reached the semifinals of the Australian Open in early 1993, losing again to Stefan Edberg and matching the previous year&#x27;s quarterfinal performance at the French Open. In April 1993, Sampras attained the No. 1 ranking for the first time. His rise to the top of the rankings was controversial because he had not recently won any Grand Slam titles, but he justified his ranking three months later by claiming his first of seven Wimbledon titles, beating former world No. 1 and fellow American Jim Courier in the final. This was followed by his second US Open title. He finished the year as the clear No. 1 and set a new ATP Tour record that year by becoming the first player to serve more than 1,000 aces in a season.

===1994: Australian and Wimbledon titles===
Sampras won the first of two Australian Open titles in 1994, defeating American Todd Martin in the final. He then defended his Wimbledon later that year, beating Ivanisevic in the final. Criticisms were made about the length of the points, as only three rallies contained more than five shots.

===1995: Wimbledon and US titles, world No. 1===
In 1995, Sampras battled for the world No. 1 ranking with compatriot Andre Agassi, whom he faced in two grand slam finals. He won two grand slam titles on the year and was the key figure for champion United States in the Davis Cup, beating Russia in the final in Moscow 3-2. Sampras was included in all of the three wins. After the opening match (a 5-set thriller against Chesnokov) Sampras was so exhausted that he collapsed and needed help to get into the locker room.

Sampras experienced one of the most emotional matches of his career against Courier in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. Sampras&#x27; longtime coach and close friend, Tim Gullikson, had mysteriously collapsed during the tournament and was forced to return to the United States. Gullikson was later diagnosed with brain cancer, to which he succumbed the following year. Saddened by Gullikson&#x27;s illness, Sampras began visibly weeping during the match when a spectator shouted at Sampras, urging him to win it for Gullikson. Sampras nevertheless managed to defeat Courier, but lost the final to Andre Agassi in four sets. Paul Annacone took over as Sampras&#x27; full-time coach after Gullikson&#x27;s illness made it impossible for him to continue coaching.

Sampras defeated Agassi in the final at Indian Wells and then won his third straight Wimbledon title over Boris Becker. Sampras lost in the final of the Canadian Masters to Agassi and then beat Agassi in the final of the US Open.

===1996: Only Wimbledon loss over eight years===
In the year&#x27;s first major, the Australian Open, the top-seeded Sampras lost to the unseeded Mark Philippoussis 6–4, 7-6(11–9), 7-6(7–3) in the tournament&#x27;s third round. Sampras had what would end up being his best run ever at that year&#x27;s French Open, defeating two past former champions Sergi Bruguera and Jim Courier (in 5 sets on both occasions and overcoming a 2-0 deficit against the latter) before losing in a semifinal match to the eventual winner, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 7-6(7–4), 6–0, 6–2.

In the eight Wimbledons inclusive between 1993 and 2000, 1996 was the only year that Sampras would fail to win the tournament. Sampras lost in the quarterfinals that year to the 17th-seed and eventual champion Richard Krajicek, who defeated Sampras 7–5, 7–6(7–3), 6–4.

In the quarterfinals of the US Open, Sampras vomited on the court at 1–1 in the final set tiebreak (due to dehydration) while facing Àlex Corretja; nonetheless, Sampras would win that match. Sampras advanced to the finals, where he defeated No. 2 Michael Chang to defend his US Open title.

Sampras finished off the year by claiming the season-ending ATP Tour World Championship for the third time in his career.

===1997: Australian and Wimbledon titles===
Sampras won his second Australian Open title in January, defeating Carlos Moyá in the final. In July, he won Wimbledon for the fourth time, defeating Cédric Pioline in the final. Sampras also won singles titles in San Jose, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Munich, and Paris, and the ATP Tour World Championships in Hanover, Germany. He became the only player to win both the Grand Slam Cup and the ATP Tour World Championships in the same year.

He had a 10–1 win–loss record against top-10 opponents and was undefeated in eight singles finals. He held the No. 1 ranking for the entire year and joined Jimmy Connors (1974–1978) as the only male players to hold the year-end No. 1 ranking for five consecutive years. His prize money earnings of US$6,498,211 for the year was a career high.

===1998: Wimbledon title, six straight years No. 1 ===
In 1998, Sampras&#x27;s No. 1 ranking was challenged by Chilean player Marcelo Ríos. Sampras failed to defend his Australian Open title, losing in the quarterfinals to Karol Kučera, and won Wimbledon only after a hard-fought five-set victory over Goran Ivanišević.

Sampras lost in the final of the Cincinnati Masters to Patrick Rafter after a controversial line call. Sampras faced Rafter again in the semifinals of the US Open, losing in five sets after sustaining injury while leading the match two sets to one, and Rafter went on to win his second consecutive US Open title. Sampras lost another semifinal at the Tennis Masters Cup to eventual champion Àlex Corretja. Nevertheless, Sampras finished the year as the top-ranked player for the sixth year in a row.

===1999: Wimbledon title===
The year started with a withdrawal from the Australian Open due to fatigue, and Sampras failed to win a title during the early part of the season. However, he then went on a 24-match winning streak encompassing the Stella Artois Championships, Wimbledon (equaling Roy Emerson&#x27;s record of 12 Grand Slam singles titles), Los Angeles, and Cincinnati (a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s final with Patrick Rafter). Sampras&#x27; victory over Andre Agassi in the Wimbledon final is often cited as one of the greatest performances in a Wimbledon final. Despite this—on account of a herniated disc in his back forcing retirements at the RCA Championships and the US Open—he lost his no. 1 ranking to Agassi the following day, when the ATP Tour rankings were updated.

Sampras&#x27; ranking was hurt by a combination of withdrawing from the Australian and US Opens, tournaments in which he had strong performances during the previous year, and the resurgence of longtime rival Agassi, putting an end to Sampras&#x27; six consecutive years of finishing as world No. 1. Agassi took over the top ranking and held it for the rest of the season, but Sampras recovered and managed to beat Agassi in the year-end championships for the fifth and final time, enabling him to remain third in the rankings.

===2000: 13 majors and return to No. 1===
Sampras reached the semifinals of the Australian Open in early 2000, falling to the eventual champion Agassi in a five-set match. He won the Ericsson Open for the third time in March. After getting knocked out in the first round at the French Open, he won his seventh and final title at Wimbledon, battling through tendinitis in his right shin and a painful back injury in the process equalling the then all time gentleman&#x27;s singles title record of William Renshaw. In the final, Sampras was a set down and 4-1 down in the second set tie break against Patrick Rafter, but went on to win in four sets. This was his 13th Grand Slam singles title, breaking the all-time record of Roy Emerson that had stood for over 30 years.

In the 2000 US Open, Sampras overcame Richard Krajicek in four sets at the quarterfinals (including a comeback from 2-6 down in a tiebreaker), and upcoming star Lleyton Hewitt in the semi-finals, but lost the final to Marat Safin. Sampras&#x27; run to the final briefly returned him to the No. 1 ranking, but Gustavo Kuerten ended the year atop the rankings. This would be the last time Sampras was ranked No. 1, extending his ATP record career total to 286 weeks. (The record was surpassed by Roger Federer in 2012.)

===2001: Drop in ranking===
Sampras&#x27; 31-match Wimbledon win streak ended in a five set loss to Roger Federer, aged 19, in the fourth round; this was the only time the two tennis legends ever played an official professional match. At the US Open, Sampras reached the final but lost in straight sets to Lleyton Hewitt. Overall, this season was the first in 12 years that Sampras did not win a single title, and he finished the year ranked No. 10, also his lowest since 1989.

===2002: 14th major and retirement===
In 2002, Sampras suffered an early exit from Wimbledon, losing in the second round to No. 145 fast-court specialist George Bastl of Switzerland. After that loss, Sampras asked his former coach Paul Annacone to return and coach through the US Open. Sampras had a relatively poor summer leading up to the US Open, losing at Cincinnati to No. 70-ranked Wayne Arthurs in the second round, and then was eliminated at the opening round at Long Island by No. 85. Paul-Henri Mathieu.

At the US Open, Sampras was seeded 17th. Greg Rusedski, whom Sampras had defeated in a long five-set third round match at the US Open, said that Sampras was &quot;a step and a half slower&quot; and predicted that Sampras would lose his next match. Sampras, however, then defeated two young stars, Tommy Haas in the fourth round and Andy Roddick in the quarterfinals. He then defeated Sjeng Schalken in the semifinals to reach his third straight US Open final, and eighth US Open final overall, tying Ivan Lendl&#x27;s all-time record. This time, he faced Agassi, whom he had met in his very first Grand Slam final 12 years earlier. After a four-set battle between the two veterans, Sampras claimed a then-record 14th Grand Slam singles title and matched Jimmy Connors&#x27; Open Era record of five US Open singles championships.

Sampras did not compete in any tour events in the following 12 months, but he did not officially announce his retirement until August 2003, just prior to the US Open. He chose not to defend his title there, but his retirement announcement was timed so that he could say farewell at a special ceremony organized for him at the Open. He thus became the only man to win the final Grand Slam tournament at which he competed. At the time of his retirement, many regarded Sampras as the greatest player of all time.

===Career summary===
Sampras won 64 top-level singles titles (including 14 Grand Slam titles, 11 Super 9/ATP Masters Series/ATP World Tour Masters 1000 titles and five Tennis Masters Cup titles) and two doubles titles. He was ranked the world No. 1 for a total of 286 weeks (the third most in the Open Era after Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer) and was year-end No. 1 for an ATP record six consecutive years from 1993 through 1998. He is regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.

Sampras was known for his natural attacking serve-and-volley game, all-round game, and strong competitive instinct. Sampras&#x27;s best surface was undoubtedly the fast-playing grass courts, Sampras won seven Wimbledon Gentleman&#x27;s Singles titles (1993–95, 1997–2000), broken only by a loss in the 1996 quarterfinals to eventual winner Richard Krajicek. Sampras&#x27;s seven Wimbledon Gentleman&#x27;s Singles titles, tied with William Renshaw and Novak Djokovic, has only been surpassed by Federer who won a record eighth Gentleman&#x27;s Singles title in 2017. Sampras is lauded by many tennis analysts as one of the greatest male grass-court players of all time. Sampras also shares the record of five US Open titles in the Open Era with Jimmy Connors and Federer. He won back-to-back US Open titles in 1995 and 1996, despite vomiting on the court at 1–1 in the final set tiebreak due to dehydration in the 1996 quarterfinals against Àlex Corretja. Combined with his two Australian Open titles, this gave Sampras a total of fourteen majors won on grass and hard courts.

Sampras&#x27;s only real weakness was on clay courts, where the slow surface tempered his natural attacking serve-and-volley game. His best performance at the French Open came in 1996, when he lost a semifinal match to the eventual winner, Yevgeny Kafelnikov. Despite his limited success at Roland Garros, Sampras did win some significant matches on clay. He won a 1992 clay court tournament in Kitzbühel, defeating Alberto Mancini in the final. He won the prestigious Italian Open in 1994, defeating Boris Becker in the final, and two singles matches in the 1995 Davis Cup final against Russians Andrei Chesnokov and Yevgeny Kafelnikov in Moscow. Sampras also won a 1998 clay court tournament in Atlanta, defeating Jason Stoltenberg in the final.

==Post-retirement activity==

On April 6, 2006, three and a half years after his retirement, Sampras resurfaced and played his first exhibition match in River Oaks, Houston, Texas, against 23-year-old Robby Ginepri. Ginepri won the match in two sets. Sampras later announced that he would be playing in World Team Tennis events.

In 2007, Sampras was announcing that he would play in a few events on the Outback Champions Series, a group of tournaments for former ATP players who have met certain criteria during their careers. Sampras won his first two events on tour, defeating Todd Martin in both finals (one of which included Sampras&#x27;s first trip to his ancestral homeland, Greece). Many observers noted that despite Sampras’ lengthy layoff from competitive tournaments, he still possessed many of the previous skills he had displayed while on the ATP tour, with commentator John McEnroe going as far as to say that Sampras would be worthy of a top five seeding at Wimbledon were he to enter the tournament.

On November 20, 2007, Sampras lost the first of three exhibition matches in Asia against then world #1 Roger Federer in Seoul, Korea. Two days later in Kuala Lumpur, Sampras again lost to Federer in two tiebreaks. However, Sampras was able to win the last match of the series, winning in two sets on fast carpet.

On February 18, 2008, in an exhibition match during the SAP Open, Sampras defeated another active player, former No. 2 Tommy Haas. Sampras dispatched the German in 43 minutes.

On March 10, 2008, Sampras played another exhibition match against No. 1 Roger Federer at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Sampras once again lost the match in three tight sets.

In 2009, Sampras won two Outback Champions Series titles. He defeated McEnroe in the final of the Champions Cup Boston in February and Patrick Rafter in the final of The Del Mar Development Champions Cup in March.

Sampras was present at the 2009 Wimbledon final between Andy Roddick and Roger Federer to witness Federer eclipse his mark of 14 major titles and become the most successful man in Grand Slam history. His record of 14 majors had lasted for seven years.

The following year along with Federer, Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal, Sampras played an exhibition doubles match at Indian Wells to raise money for the people of Haiti who had been affected by the earthquake.

In November 2010, Sampras reported that many of his trophies and memorabilia had been stolen from a West Los Angeles public storage facility. The loss included the trophy from his first Australian Open victory, two Davis Cups, an Olympic ring and six trophies for finishing top in the year-end rankings. Most of the stolen items have since been recovered and returned.

On November 17, 2011, Sampras played and lost an exhibition match against Milos Raonic. His serve approached 200 km/h (124 mph) throughout the night.

==Rivalries==

===Sampras vs. Agassi===

The rivalry has been called the greatest of the generation of players competing in the 1990s, as they were the most successful players of that decade, and had a contrasting playing style, with Sampras and Agassi being considered respectively the greatest server and the greatest serve returner of their eras. Sampras won 20 of the 34 matches he played against Agassi.

The 1990 US Open was their first meeting in a Grand Slam tournament final. Agassi was favored because he was ranked No. 4, compared to the No. 12 ranking of Sampras and because Agassi had defeated Sampras in their only previously completed match. However, Agassi lost the final to Sampras in straight sets.

Their next meeting in a Grand Slam was at the 1992 French Open, where they met in the quarterfinals. Although Sampras was higher ranked, Agassi prevailed in straight sets. Their next Grand Slam meeting was at the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in 1993, where Agassi was the defending champion and Sampras was the newly minted No. 1. Sampras prevailed in five sets, and went on to win his first Wimbledon championship.

With both Sampras and Agassi participating, the U.S. won the Davis Cup in 1995. Notable Sampras-Agassi matches of 1995 included the finals of the Australian Open, the Newsweek Champions Cup, the Lipton International Players Championships, the Canadian Open, and the US Open, with Sampras winning the Newsweek Champions Cup and the US Open.

The next time Sampras and Agassi met in a Grand Slam final was at Wimbledon in 1999, where Sampras won in straight sets. For both, it was considered a career rejuvenation, as Sampras had suffered a string of disappointments in the last year while Agassi was regaining his status as a top-ranked player after winning the French Open. Sampras forfeited the No. 1 ranking to Agassi when injury forced Sampras to withdraw from that year&#x27;s US Open, which Agassi went on to win. They faced each other twice in the season-ending ATP Tour World Championships, with Sampras losing the round-robin match, but winning the final.

They played each other only once in 2000. The top-ranked Agassi defeated No. 3 Sampras in the semifinals of the Australian Open in five sets.

In arguably their most memorable match, Sampras defeated Agassi in the 2001 US Open quarterfinals 6–7, 7–6, 7–6, 7–6. There were no breaks of serve during the entire match. Reruns of the match are frequently featured on television, especially during US Open rain delays.

The final of the 2002 US Open was their first meeting in a US Open final since 1995. The match was also notable because they had defeated several up-and-coming players en route to the final. Sampras had defeated No. 3 Tommy Haas in the fourth round and future No. 1 Andy Roddick in the quarterfinals, while Agassi had defeated No. 1 and defending champion Lleyton Hewitt in the semifinals. Sampras defeated Agassi in four sets. This was the final ATP tour singles match of Sampras&#x27;s career.

In August 2010, Sampras played an exhibition game with Agassi at the indoor arena Coliseo Cubierto El Campin in Bogotá, Colombia.

===Sampras vs. Rafter===
Sampras won 12 of the 16 matches he played against Patrick Rafter, including eight of their first nine, and their final four meetings.

In 1997, Rafter won the US Open, a tournament that many expected Sampras to win, having won in 1995 and 1996. The win catapulted Rafter to the year-end no. 2 rankings behind Sampras. Seven-time Grand Slam champion John McEnroe believed Rafter to be a &quot;one-slam wonder&quot;, since it was only his second career ATP title. Up to that point, Sampras was 5–1 against Rafter, and defeated Rafter three times in fall 1997 to solidify his No. 1 ATP ranking. &quot;We&#x27;re not the best of mates,&quot; Rafter said of Sampras after 1997 Davis Cup semifinals, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t go out for a beer with him, put it that way. I don&#x27;t know what the story is. There&#x27;s a bit of feeling.&quot;

In 1998, Rafter came back from a set down to defeat Sampras in the Cincinnati Masters final, a title that Sampras needed to win in order get the maximum ranking points to stay No. 1 ahead of Marcelo Ríos. During that match, Rafter&#x27;s serve was called out, but the umpire overruled the call to give Rafter the ace and the Cincinnati title. Sampras was displeased, and stood at the baseline for several seconds, making the victorious Rafter wait at the net, and then refused to shake the umpire&#x27;s hand. Sampras, at the time winner of 11 Grand Slams, when asked about the difference between himself and Rafter, said &quot;Ten grand slams&quot;, that a controversial line-call cost him the match, and that a player had to come back and win another Grand Slam title in order to be considered great. Rafter went on to win the Canada Masters as well, earning the third seed at the 1998 US Open.

The two met in the semifinals of the 1998 US Open, where Sampras was slowed in the third set by a leg injury and called for a trainer, and Rafter broke Sampras twice in the deciding fifth set. Sampras&#x27;s loss denied him the chance to match two records—Jimmy Connors&#x27; mark of five U.S. Open titles and Roy Emerson&#x27;s record of 12 Grand Slam singles titles. Sampras cited a leg injury as the reason Rafter won, an attitude that upset the Australian: &quot;He really does say some funny things at the wrong time&quot;, said Rafter, &quot;We are out there busting our guts and he doesn&#x27;t show a lot of respect at the end of the day. He tries to play down the reason why he lost, giving no respect to the other player, and that is what really upsets me about him and the reason I try to piss him off as much as I can.&quot; Following Rafter&#x27;s successful defense of his 1997 U.S. Open title by defeating Mark Philippoussis in the 1998 final, when asked about Sampras&#x27; earlier comments about having to win another Grand Slam in order to be considered great, Rafter replied: &quot;Maybe you can ask him that question, if he thinks that now. For me, I won another Slam, and it hasn&#x27;t sunk in yet. It&#x27;s very, very exciting for me, especially to repeat it&quot;. For his part, Sampras said about Rafter, &quot;When I see him holding the US Open trophy, it pisses me off.&quot; Rafter responded by calling Sampras a &quot;cry baby&quot; and saying that it would be better for tennis if someone besides the American were No. 1. Some had suggested at the time that the Sampras-Rafter feud was inflamed by the media since Sampras&#x27; traditional rival Andre Agassi was still in the midst of a comeback from injury.

Sampras, whose struggles from 1998 continued over to early 1999, lost a third consecutive time against Rafter at the World Team Cup, in straight sets, just before the French Open. By the summer of 1999 having rebuilt his confidence, en route to compiling a 24-match winning streak of four titles including Wimbledon, Sampras prevailed against Rafter in the Cincinnati Masters final, a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s final, and the two were friendly in the trophy ceremony. Later that summer, Sampras withdrew from the U.S. Open due to an injured back, while Rafter retired in the first round as a result of a torn rotator cuff.

The next Sampras-Rafter match was the 2000 Wimbledon final, after Rafter overcame Agassi in the semifinals, a four-set final which included a 26-minute rain delay. Both players had flown in their parents for the Wimbledon final, the first time in years they would see their sons play. Sampras lost the first-set tiebreaker, and trailed in the second-set tiebreaker 1-4 before taking 5 consecutive points to win that set, then won the third and fourth sets for the Championship, with just 10 minutes of daylight left. That victory gave Sampras his 13th Grand Slam title, breaking the record of 12 by Roy Emerson for the most Grand Slam titles. After the match ended, Sampras called Rafter &quot;all class, on and off the court&quot;, while Rafter said he was lucky to overcome early season injuries to make the final.

Sampras and Rafter met in the fourth round of the 2001 US Open, with Sampras winning.

==Playing style==
Sampras was an all-court player who would often serve and volley. Possessing an all-around skill, in the early years of his career, when not serving, his strategy was to be offensive from the baseline, put opponents in a defensive position, and finish points at the net. In his later years, he became even more offensive and would either employ a chip-and-charge strategy or try to hit an offensive shot on the return and follow his return to the net.

He had an accurate and powerful first serve – widely considered among players, commentators and fans as one of the best of all time. He had great disguise on both his first and second serves, and his second serve was nearly as powerful as his first. He was known for producing aces on critical points, even with his second serves.

Sampras was able to hit winners from both his forehand and backhand from all over the court. He was able to catch attacks wide to his forehand using his speed and hitting a forehand shot on the run. When successfully executed, he won many points outright or put opponents immediately on the defensive, due to the considerable pace and flat nature of the shot. This style did not help him on clay courts, according to some critics.

===Equipment===
Sampras used one racket type, the Wilson Pro Staff Original, for his entire professional career—a racket first introduced in 1983. He played with Babolat natural gut, with all his rackets re-strung before each match (used or not) at 75 lbs tension (more or less, depending on conditions). His rackets had weight added to bring them close to 400 g, but the frame proper was a production model manufactured at a Wilson factory on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent. The handles were custom-built.

Post-retirement, Sampras has used a slightly modified Pro Staff Tour 90 and, from 2008, a new version of the original Pro Staff, produced with in-between head size of 88 square inches and heavier weight at 349 grams unstrung.

Since mid-2010, Sampras has been spotted at multiple exhibitions playing with a Babolat Pure Storm Tour, along with Babolat&#x27;s popular RPM Blast strings.

&quot;I need a little more pop...I need it if I&#x27;m going to play some tennis,&quot; he said after playing Gaël Monfils in an exhibition at the SAP Open.

During a good part of 2011, Sampras used a racquet that was painted all black, with Tourna Grip and Tourna Damper.

In the late 1980s, Sampras signed a three-year endorsement contract with Sergio Tacchini. It was extended to five years before Sampras signed with Nike in 1994. He wore Nike apparel and Nike Air Oscillate footwear on court.

==Personal life==
Sampras&#x27;s mother was born in Greece and his father was born in the United States to a Greek father and Polish mother. His older sister, Stella Sampras Webster, is the women&#x27;s tennis head coach at UCLA, and his younger sister, Marion, is a teacher in Los Angeles. His older brother, Gus, has been tournament director at the Scottsdale ATP event. In 2007 he became president of the firm managing Pete&#x27;s business activities.

On September 30, 2000, Sampras married American actress and former Miss Teen USA Bridgette Wilson. On November 21, 2002, their first son was born. On July 29, 2005, the couple had their second son. They reside in Lake Sherwood, California. Both Sampras and Wilson were committed to raising their children out of the public eye and both retired from their careers to focus on family life.

Sampras has β-thalassemia minor, a genetic trait that sometimes causes mild anemia.

Politically, Sampras is a Republican. He supported John McCain in 2008.

<text>Sir George Everest, (, ; 4 July 1790 – 1 December 1866) was a British surveyor and geographer who served as Surveyor General of India from 1830 to 1843.

After receiving a military education in Marlow, Everest joined the East India Company and arrived in India at the age of 16. He was eventually made an assistant to William Lambton on the Great Trigonometric Survey, and replaced Lambton as superintendent of the survey in 1823. Everest was largely responsible for surveying the meridian arc from the southernmost point of India north to Nepal, a distance of about , a task that took from 1806 to 1841 to complete. He was made Surveyor General of India in 1830, retiring in 1843 and returning to England.

In 1865, the Royal Geographical Society renamed Peak XV – at the time only recently identified as the world&#x27;s highest peak – to Mount Everest in his honour. Andrew Scott Waugh, his protégé and successor as surveyor general, had been responsible for putting his name forward in 1856. Everest&#x27;s name was used as a compromise due to the difficulty of choosing between multiple local names for the mountain. He initially objected to the honour, as he had had nothing to do with its discovery and believed his name was not easily written or pronounced in Hindi.

==Biography==

Everest was born on 4 July 1790, but his birthplace is uncertain. He was baptised at St Alfege Church, Greenwich, London, on 27 January 1791. He was born either at Greenwich or at Gwernvale Manor, his family&#x27;s estate near Crickhowell, Brecknockshire (now part of Powys), Wales. Everest was the eldest son and third of six children born to Lucetta Mary (née Smith) and William Tristram Everest. His father was a solicitor and justice of the peace, part of a &quot;Greenwich family of long standing&quot;, and was successful enough to acquire a large estate in south Wales. His grandfather John Everest, the son of a butcher, was the first in the family to enter the legal profession. The Everest family in Greenwich can be traced at least as far back as the late 1600s, when Tristram Everest – John&#x27;s great-grandfather – was a butcher in Church Street.

Everest was educated at the Royal Military College (Cadet Branch) in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, before joining the East India Company as a cadet in 1806. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Bengal Artillery, and sailed for India the same year.

Everest was a Freemason, initiated (date unknown) in Neptune Lodge, Penang, under the authority of the United Grand Lodge of England. Later, having returned to England, he joined Prince of Wales&#x27;s Lodge, London, on 20 February 1829.

===Early career in India===
Little is known about Everest&#x27;s earliest years in India, but when he first arrived in the country at 16 years old he showed a talent for mathematics and astronomy. He was seconded to Java in 1814, where Lieutenant-Governor Stamford Raffles appointed him to survey the island. He returned to Bengal in 1816, where he improved British knowledge of the Ganges and the Hooghly. He later surveyed a semaphore line from Calcutta to Benares, covering approximately . Everest&#x27;s work came to the attention of Colonel William Lambton, the leader of the Great Trigonometrical Survey (GTS), who appointed him as his chief assistant. He joined Lambton at Hyderabad in 1818, where he was in the process of surveying a meridian arc northward from Cape Commorin. He was responsible for much of the fieldwork, but then in 1820 contracted malaria, necessitating a period of recovery spent at the Cape of Good Hope.

Recovering from malaria, Everest returned to India in 1821. He succeeded Lambton as superintendent of the GTS upon Lambton&#x27;s death in 1823, and over the following years extended his predecessor&#x27;s efforts on the arc up to Sironj, in present-day Madhya Pradesh. Everest was prone to suffer from poor health, however, and the effects of a bout of fever and rheumatism left him half paralysed. He returned to England in 1825, where he spent the following five years recuperating. During this time, Everest was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in March 1827. Most of his free time was spent lobbying the East India Company for better equipment and studying the methods used by the Ordnance Survey; he frequently corresponded with Thomas Frederick Colby.

He became acquainted with Indian thought according to his niece Mary Boole:
It is very likely he introduced Indian thought to others as well:

===Surveyor General of India===
In June 1830, Everest returned to India to continue his work on the GTS, and was simultaneously appointed Surveyor General of India. The arc from Cape Commorin to the northern border of British India was finally completed in 1841, under the supervision of Andrew Scott Waugh. To his dismay, much of his time was spent on administrative concerns, as well as combating criticism from home. The East India Company had provisionally appointed Thomas Jervis as Everest&#x27;s successor, and Jervis subsequently delivered a series of lectures to the Royal Society on the perceived deficiencies of Everest&#x27;s methods.

In response, Everest penned a series of open letters to Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, the society&#x27;s president, in which he lambasted the society &quot;for meddling in matters of which they know little&quot;. Jervis withdrew from consideration, and Everest successfully secured the appointment of his protégé Waugh as his successor. He resigned in November 1842 and his commission was formally revoked in December 1843, at which point he returned to England.

===Later life===
In 1845, Everest was a passenger on the first voyage of the SS &quot;Great Britain&quot;, which was the first crossing of any ocean on the world by a screw propelled steamship.

In 1847, Everest published &quot;An Account of the Measurement of Two Sections of the Meridional Arc of India&quot;, for which he was awarded a medal by the Royal Astronomical Society. He was later elected to fellowship of the Royal Asiatic Society and the Royal Geographical Society. Everest was promoted to colonel in 1854, made a Commander of the Order of the Bath in February 1861, and created a Knight Bachelor in March 1861. He died at his home in Hyde Park Gardens on 1 December 1866, and was buried in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Hove, near Brighton.

==Naming of Mount Everest==
George Everest had no direct connection with the mountain which bears his name, which he never saw. He was, however, responsible for hiring Andrew Scott Waugh, who made the first formal observations of the mountain, and Radhanath Sikdar, who calculated its height. Before its significance was realised, Mount Everest was originally known as Peak &quot;B&quot; and later as Peak XV. In March 1856, Waugh wrote to the Royal Geographical Society to announce that the mountain was believed to be the highest in the world, and proposed that it be named &quot;after my illustrious predecessor&quot;, as it was &quot;without any local name that we can discover&quot; – the &quot;native appellation, if it has any, will not very likely be ascertained before we are allowed to penetrate into Nepal&quot;. There were in fact several native names among the Nepalese and Tibetans, but those areas were closed off to the British at the time and people living further to the south of the Himalayas did not have a specific name for the peak. In the decade after 1856, Waugh&#x27;s proposal was widely debated by the Royal Geographical Society and similar bodies. Other scholars of India put forward native names that they believed to be correct, such as Brian Houghton Hodgson&#x27;s &quot;Deva-dhunga&quot; and Hermann Schlagintweit&#x27;s &quot;Gaurisankar&quot;. Everest himself objected to his name being used, as &quot;the native of India&quot; could not pronounce it and it could not be easily written in Hindi. Nonetheless, in 1865 the society officially settled on &quot;Mount Everest&quot; as the name.

==Family==
Everest had several siblings, including two younger brothers. George&#x27;s first younger brother was Robert Everest, chaplain to the East India Company and author of &quot;A Journey Through the United States and Part of Canada&quot;. His second (his youngest brother) was the Thomas Roupell Everest, the father of Mary Everest and a lay homoeopath.

Everest&#x27;s third child, Ethel Everest, was an associate of Emma Cons and friend of Lilian Baylis. She provided financial support for the founding of Morley College in south London.

One of Everest&#x27;s sons, Lancelot Feilding Everest, was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, and was called to the Bar by Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He practised as a barrister in chambers in London and was also the principal author of &quot;The Law of Estoppel&quot;. Lancelot&#x27;s eldest son, Cyril Feilding Everest, enlisted in the Canadian Infantry on 17 November 1914 and was killed in action on 9 October 1916 at the Battle of the Somme.

Everest&#x27;s niece, Mary Everest, married mathematician George Boole in Gloucestershire on 11 September 1855. In spite of the absence of formal training, Mary was a fine mathematician in her own right, as was one of her daughters, Alicia Boole Stott. Alicia&#x27;s son, Leonard Boole Stott, studied medicine and became a pioneer in the treatment and control of tuberculosis, work for which he was later appointed an OBE Mary Boole&#x27;s daughter Margaret was the mother of Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor OM, a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, a renowned mathematician and physicist, and a major figure in fluid dynamics and wave theory.

==Sir George Everest house in Mussoorie, India==
Everest owned a house in Mussoorie, Uttarakhand, India, for about 11 years. He purchased it, sight unseen, from General Whish. Although now virtually derelict, it still has its roof, and there have been various plans to make it into a museum.

Built in 1832, the house is known today as Sir George Everest&#x27;s House and Laboratory, or Park House. The house is situated in Park Estate about west of Gandhi Chowk / Library Bazaar (the west end of Mall Road in Mussoorie). Its location has panoramic views of the Doon Valley on one side and the Aglar River valley and the Himalayan Range to the north.
The house is under the jurisdiction of the Tourism Department. There are underground water cisterns (or perhaps pits for storing ice, since water is scarce in the area) that are quite deep and lie uncovered in the front yard outside the house, filled with litter and posing danger of slipping.

The interior has been stripped but the fireplaces, roof, and the door and window frames still remain. The house is secured by steel grills and cannot be entered. Now that this property is better known and the access road has been improved, the walls are covered with graffiti and then periodically whitewashed clean.

Recent new fencing, tree planting and the construction of a ticket booth (as of late 2015) indicate that at some point it will cost to enter the property. The inside has signs of renovation several years ago, such as ceramic floor tiles in the kitchen and electrical switch boxes. Conservation architects at the Indian National Trust are vying for this project. As of 2023, the house and the surrounding areas have been completely remodeled. The house and laboratory are not yet open to public. One can enjoy a number of small cafes that have been set up around the house. No tickets have been bought as of now.

<text>Pétanque (, ; ; ) is a sport that falls into the category of boules sports (along with raffa, bocce, boule lyonnaise, lawn bowls, and crown green bowling). In these sports, players or teams play their boules/balls towards a target ball. 

In pétanque the objective is to score points by having boules closer to the target than the opponent after all boules have been thrown. This is achieved by throwing or rolling boules closer to the small target ball, officially called a &quot;jack&quot; (), or by hitting the opponents&#x27; boules away from the target, while standing inside a circle with both feet on the ground. The game is normally and best played on hard dirt or gravel. It can be played in public areas in parks or in dedicated facilities called &quot;boulodromes&quot;.

The current form of the game was codified in 1907 or 1910 in La Ciotat, in Provence, France. The French name &quot;pétanque&quot; (borrowed into English, with or without the acute accent) comes from &quot;petanca&quot; in the Provençal dialect of the Occitan language, deriving from the expression &quot;pè tancat&quot; , meaning &#x27;foot fixed&#x27; or &#x27;foot planted&#x27; (on the ground).

== History ==
=== Invention of the game ===

Boules games have a very long history, dating back through the Middle Ages to ancient Rome, and before that to ancient Greece.

In France in the second half of the 19th century, a form of boules known as &quot;jeu provençal&quot; (or &quot;boule lyonnaise&quot;) was extremely popular. In this form of the game, players rolled their boules or ran three steps before throwing a boule. Pétanque originally developed as an offshoot or variant of &quot;jeu provençal&quot; in 1910, in what is now called the &quot;Jules Lenoir Boulodrome&quot; in the town of La Ciotat near Marseilles. 

A former &quot;jeu provençal&quot; player named Jules Lenoir was afflicted by rheumatism so severe that he could no longer run before throwing a boule. In fact, he could barely stand. A good friend named Ernest Pitiot was a local café owner. In order to accommodate his friend Lenoir, Pitiot developed a variant form of the game in which the length of the pitch or field was reduced by roughly half, and a player, instead of running to throw a boule, stood, stationary, in a circle. They called the game &quot;pieds tanqués&quot;, &quot;feet planted&quot; (on the ground), a name that eventually evolved into the game&#x27;s current name, &quot;pétanque&quot;.

The first pétanque tournament was organized by Ernest Pitiot, along with his brother Joseph Pitiot, in 1910 in La Ciotat. The game spread quickly and soon became the most popular form of boules in France.

Before the mid-1800s, European boules games were played with solid wooden balls, usually made from boxwood root, a very hard wood. The late 1800s saw the introduction of cheap mass-manufactured nails, and wooden boules gradually began to be covered with nails, producing &quot;boules cloutées&quot; (&quot;nailed boules&quot;). After World War I, cannonball manufacturing technology was adapted to allow the manufacture of hollow, all-metal boules. 

The first all-metal boule, &quot;la Boule Intégrale&quot;, was introduced in the mid-1920s by Paul Courtieu. The &quot;Intégrale&quot; was cast in a single piece from a bronze-aluminum alloy. Shortly thereafter, Jean Blanc invented a process of manufacturing steel boules by stamping two steel blanks into hemispheres and then welding the two hemispheres together to create a boule. With this technological advance, hollow all-metal balls rapidly became the norm.

=== Global spread of the game ===

After the development of the all-metal boule, pétanque spread rapidly from Provence to the rest of France, then to the rest of Europe, and then to Francophone colonies and countries around the globe. Today, many countries have their own national governing bodies.

In France, the &quot;Fédération Française de Pétanque et Jeu Provençal&quot; (FFPJP) has over 300,000 licensed members.

There are strong national federations in Germany, Spain and England. Pétanque is actively played in many nations with histories of French colonial influence, especially in Southeast Asia, including Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Puducherry in India, as well as some parts of Africa. The sport is also popular in Madagascar and Thailand.

Pétanque was featured at the 2015 All-Africa Games hosted by the Republic of the Congo, a former French colony.

Pétanque is not widely played in the Americas. There is a Canadian pétanque federation based in Québec. In the United States, the Federation of Pétanque USA (FPUSA) reports that about 30,000 play nationwide. As of 1 December 2015, FPUSA counted 2141 members in the US, in 52 affiliated clubs.

On the international level, the governing body of pétanque is the &quot;Fédération Internationale de Pétanque et Jeu Provençal&quot; (FIPJP). It was founded in 1958 in Marseille and has almost 800,000 members as of 2022.

=== National and international competitions ===

There are a number of important world championship tournaments.

The FIPJP world championships take place every two years. Men&#x27;s championships are held in even-numbered years, while Women&#x27;s and Youth championships are held in odd-numbered years.

Perhaps the best-known international championship is the &quot;Mondial la Marseillaise à Pétanque&quot;, which takes place every year in Marseille, France, with more than 10,000 participants and more than 150,000 spectators.

The largest annual tournament in the United States is the Pétanque Amelia Island Open (formerly the Pétanque America Open), held in each year in November at Amelia Island, Florida.

Pétanque will be making its debut as an Olympic sport at the 2026 Summer Youth Olympics in Dakar, although the Confédération Mondiale des Sports de Boules—which was created in 1985 by several international boules organizations specifically for this purpose—has been lobbying the Olympic committee since 1985 to make it part of the Olympic Games. Pétanque has appeared in every edition of The World Games from 1985 onward. The 2022 World Games in the United States included women’s pétanque, the first time that only women&#x27;s events were held as part of the boules sports programme at The World Games.

==Playing the game==
Based on the rules of the &quot;Fédération Internationale de Pétanque &amp; Jeu Provençal&quot;.

===Equipment ===
Pétanque is played by two teams, each comprising one, two, or three players. Three boules are used per player in singles and doubles games, and two per player in triples games. A small wooden ball called a &quot;jack&quot; (&quot;cochonnet&quot;) serves as the target for the players&#x27; throws.

The area where a game of pétanque is played is called a &quot;terrain&quot;. A game can be played in an open area such as a public park, where the boundaries of the terrain are not marked, or more formally on a &quot;marked terrain&quot; where the terrain boundaries are marked (traditionally, by strings tightly strung between nails driven into the ground).
In pétanque, players throw while standing in a circle (&quot;cercle&quot;). Traditionally, this was simply scratched in the dirt. From around 2005, red plastic &quot;prefabricated&quot; circles were introduced and are now widely used in formal games. A circle drawn on the ground must be in diameter, while a plastic circle must have an inside diameter of .

===The &quot;ends&quot;===
A game consists of several &quot;ends&quot; (&quot;mènes&quot;). An end consists of the throwing out of the jack, followed by the two teams throwing their boules. After both teams have thrown all of their boules, the team with the boule closest to the jack wins the end. 

The winning team scores one point for each of its boules that is closer than the opposing team&#x27;s closest boule. Each end therefore gives the winning team a minimum of one point, and a potential maximum of six in a doubles/triples game. The first team to score 13 points wins the game.

===Order of play===
A coin toss is held between the teams at the start of the game. The winning team draws/places the circle, and one of its members stands inside and throws the jack to a distance of . One member then throws a boule, followed by a member of the opposing team. From this point on, the team whose boule is closest to the jack is said to &quot;hold the point,&quot; and the opposing team throws the next boule. A team&#x27;s turn ends upon either gaining the point or running out of boules; in the latter case, the opposing team throws all of its remaining boules.

If at any point the closest boules from each team are equidistant from the jack, then the team that threw the last boule throws again. If the boules are still equidistant after this throw, then the teams play alternately until the tie is broken. If the boules remain equidistant once the end is complete, then neither team scores any points.

The team that wins an end starts the next one. A player from the winning team draws/places a circle around the jack, stands inside, and throws the jack to start the end.

===Scoring=== 

An end is complete when both teams have played all of their boules, or when the jack is knocked out of play (goes &quot;dead&quot;).

If an end is complete with the jack still in play (&quot;live&quot;), then the team with the boule nearest to it scores one point for each of its boules that is closer than the opposing team&#x27;s nearest boule. However, neither team scores any points if their closest boules are the same distance from the jack.

If the jack is dead at the completion of an end, and if only one team still has boules to play, then that team scores one point for each unused boule. Otherwise, neither team scores.

===Miscellaneous rules===

*Boules can be thrown in any way that the player wishes, but the traditional way is to hold the boule with the palm of the hand downwards, and then to throw with an under-arm swing of the arm ending in an upward flick of the wrist. Throwing this way puts backspin on the boule and gives the player the maximum amount of control and flexibility when throwing.
*The boule can be rolled, thrown to a moderate height, or even thrown to a great height (a high lob or &quot;portée&quot;).
*At the beginning of an end, if the circle is drawn/placed such that the jack cannot be thrown to the maximum distance of , then the player throwing the jack may move the circle back to a point that allows this distance to be reached.
*If a boule or jack lands on/near a boundary line such that any portion of it is within the playing area when viewed from directly above, it is considered to be live. It must completely cross the line in order to be declared dead.

== Equipment specifications ==
=== Boules ===
Leisure boules are boules that do not meet the FIPJP standards for competition boules, but are less expensive than competition boules and completely adequate for &quot;backyard&quot; games. Unlike competition boules, leisure boules are a &quot;one size fits all&quot; affair—they come in one weight and size.

Competition boules must meet specifications set by the FIPJP. They must be hollow and made of metal (usually steel) with a diameter between and a weight between . When purchasing competition boules, a purchaser has a choice of a number of characteristics, including the size, weight, and hardness of the boules, as well as the striations (patterned grooves on the surface of the boules).

=== Jack ===
The jack, or target ball, is a small ball made of wood, traditionally boxwood or beechwood, in diameter. In the past, jacks were often left &quot;natural&quot;—unfinished or with a clear finish—but nowadays they are often painted in bright colours. In French, the jack is known by a variety of names, including &quot;but&quot; (goal or target), &quot;cochonnet&quot; (piglet), &quot;bouchon&quot; (&quot;little ball&quot; in provençal language, not related to the French word &quot;bouchon&quot; that designates a bung), &quot;le petit&quot; (the little one), and &quot;gari&quot; (&quot;rat&quot;, also in provençal language).

===Playing area===

Pétanque can be played on almost any flat, open space. The ground may be irregular and interrupted by trees or rocks, and the surface is likely to be uneven, with some areas hard and smooth and other areas rough and stony. When an area is constructed specifically for the purposes of playing pétanque, the playing surface is typically loose gravel, decomposed granite, brick grog or crushed sea shell. Sandy beaches are not suitable, although light plastic boules are sometimes used to adapt the game for the beach. There is no requirement for backboards or sideboards (as in bocce), but dedicated playing areas are often enclosed in boards or some other structural barrier.

In France, village squares and park pathways are often used as pétanque playing areas. In addition, many towns have recreational facilities (&quot;boulodromes&quot;) constructed specifically for playing pétanque.

An area where a single pétanque game is played is called a &quot;terrain&quot;. A &quot;playing area&quot; (&quot;aire de jeu&quot;) is an area containing one or more terrains. For tournaments, a large playing area is subdivided and marked off (typically using nails and string) into rectangular &quot;marked terrains&quot; (also known as &quot;lanes&quot; (&quot;cadres&quot;) or &quot;pistes&quot;) so that multiple games may be carried on simultaneously. For tournament play, a marked terrain is a rectangle at least wide and long.

== Strategy ==

=== Pointing and shooting ===
Generally speaking, a player throws a boule with one of two objectives:
* To make the boule come to rest in a particular spot, usually as close as possible to the jack. This is called &quot;pointing&quot;.
* To make the boule directly hit an opponent&#x27;s boule with the aim of knocking it away from the jack. This is called &quot;shooting&quot;.

The best throw is called a &quot;carreau&quot;. It is a shot that knocks away the opponent&#x27;s boule, leaving the thrown boule exactly in its place.

Players who are skilful enough to shoot effectively are called &#x27;shooters&#x27; (&quot;tireurs&quot;); players who usually point are called &#x27;pointers&#x27; (&quot;pointeurs&quot;) As a matter of strategy, pointers play first and shooters are held in reserve in case the opponents place well. Good pointing is what scores points, but national and international championships are usually dominated by skilful shooters, who target any opposing boule that comes close to scoring.

===Throwing a boule===
Some strategic considerations involved in the throw of a boule include:

* A traditional maxim is &quot;boule devant, boule d&#x27;argent&quot; (&quot;A ball in front is a money ball.&quot;). A boule located closer to the player than the jack (&quot;in front of the jack&quot;) is much more valuable than one behind the jack. A boule in front blocks the opposing team from easy access to the jack, and it may also (intentionally or accidentally) be hit and pushed closer to the jack.
* If a player points a boule &quot;very&quot; close to the jack, it forces the opposing shooter to shoot it immediately. This may prove to be a disadvantage to a pointer who wants to keep that boule, or it can be advantageous if the pointer is trying to force the opposing shooter to exhaust their supply of boules.
* It is generally a bad idea for a player to shoot with their team&#x27;s last boule. In most cases, the better strategy is to &quot;limit the damage&quot; by pointing the team&#x27;s last boule close enough to the jack to limit the opposing team&#x27;s gains to a single point.

===Throwing the jack===
Strategic considerations involved in the throw of the jack include:

* Throw the jack to a distance at which your own shooter is most comfortable, or the opposing shooter is least comfortable. 
* Aim for a location on the terrain that your own pointers prefer, or that might be difficult for the opposing team&#x27;s pointers.
* Disorient the opposing team by refusing to get in a rut. At each opportunity, throw the jack to a new position on the terrain, and alternate long and short distances.

== Glossary of special terms ==
In the following glossary, the French word or phrase is given in brackets unless it is the same:
*join battle (&quot;arriver a bataille&quot;). When both teams have 10 or 11 points and the game may go either way on each lead. 
*bombard. To shoot or strike an opponent&#x27;s boules one after another, after they had taken the lead.
*boule devant, boule d&#x27;argent. &quot;A ball in front is a money ball&quot;. This maxim reminds players that when pointing, the most valuable place for a boule is in front of the jack. In that location, it prevents opponents from throwing directly toward the jack, and hitting it will push it even closer to the jack.
* jack (&quot;but&quot;, also &quot;bouchon, cochonnet, petit, gari&quot; or &quot;kiki&quot;). The small wooden or plastic target ball.
* carambolage Shot that knocks away several boules. Literally &quot;pile-up&quot;.
* circle (&quot;cercle&quot; or &quot;rond&quot;). The marked area from within which the boules are thrown.
*demarquer (&quot;unscore&quot;). To drop a point when pointing or shooting.
*fuser. A boule that bounces off course.
*have the point. A team is said to &quot;have the point&quot; if one of its boules is closer to the jack than any of the opposing team&#x27;s boules. A team that has the point is basically in a winning position, so the team that does NOT have the point throws the next boule and attempts to gain the point.
*mene. &quot;End&quot; i.e. the period of play from the throw of a jack to the point when both teams have played all their boules.
*point To throw one&#x27;s boule with the intent of stopping near the jack (also known as placing).
*pousette. A shot that pushes one&#x27;s team&#x27;s boules nearer the jack; or to that pushes the jack.
*shoot To throw one&#x27;s boule at an opponent&#x27;s boule (or at the jack) in an attempt to knock it out of play. When the opposing team has a boule positioned very close to the jack, often the best strategy is to attempt to shoot it. A team in a desperate situation may attempt to save itself by shooting the jack out of bounds.
*lob (&quot;portée&quot;) A boule thrown in a high arc so that when it lands it only rolls a short distance.
*carreau (pronounced &quot;carrow&quot;). A shot that knocks an opposing boule away from the jack and replaces it (in very nearly the same spot) with the thrower&#x27;s own boule. Basically, the perfect shot.

*fanny (&quot;mettre fanny&quot;). To lose a game without scoring any points; a shutout game. It&#x27;s rare, but when a player or a team loses 13 to 0, he is said to &quot;fanny&quot; (&quot;&quot;il est fanny&quot;, he&#x27;s fanny, or &quot;il a fait fanny&quot;&quot;, he made fanny) and must kiss the bottom of a girl named Fanny. Virtually everywhere in Provence where pétanque is played, you will find a picture, woodcarving or pottery figure of a bare-bottomed young woman named Fanny. Often, the team that &quot;made fanny&quot; has to buy a round of drinks for the winning team (&quot;Fanny paie à boire !&quot;, &quot;the fanny pays for the drinks!&quot;).

<text>Boules (, ), or jeu de boules, is a collective name for a wide range of games similar to bowls and bocce in which the objective is to throw or roll heavy balls as closely as possible to a small target ball, called the &quot;jack&quot;. &#x27;Boules&#x27; itself is a French loanword that usually refers to the game especially played in France.

Boules-type games are traditional and popular in many European countries and are also popular in some former French colonies in Africa and Asia. Boules games are often played in open spaces (town squares and parks) in villages and towns. Dedicated playing areas for boules-type games are typically large, level, rectangular courts made of flattened earth, gravel, or crushed stone, enclosed in wooden rails or back boards. To win, a team must reach 15 points, with a few exceptions.

==Boules games in history==

As early as the 6th century BC the ancient Greeks are recorded to have played a game of tossing coins, then flat stones, and later stone balls, called &quot;spheristics&quot;, trying to have them go as far as possible. The ancient Romans modified the game by adding a target that had to be approached as closely as possible. This Roman variation was brought to Provence by Roman soldiers and sailors. A Roman sepulchre (now in the Campana Collection in the Louvre) shows children playing this game, stooping down to measure the points.

After the Romans, the stone balls were replaced by wooden balls. In the Middle Ages, Erasmus referred to the game as in Latin, but it became commonly known as boules (i.e. &#x27;balls&#x27;), and it was played throughout Europe. King Henry III of England banned the playing of the game by his archers – he wanted them to be practicing archery, not playing boules. In the 14th century, Charles IV and Charles V of France forbade the sport to commoners; only in the 17th century was the ban lifted.

By the 19th century, in England the game had become bowls or &quot;lawn bowling&quot;. In France it was known as and was played throughout the country. The French artist Meissonnier made two paintings showing people playing the game, and Honoré de Balzac described a match in .

In the South of France, the game evolved into (or ), in which players rolled their boules or ran three steps before throwing a boule. The game was extremely popular in France in the second half of the 19th century (the first official club was established in France in 1854). It was played informally in villages all over Provence, usually on squares of land in the shade of plane trees. Matches of around the start of the 20th century are memorably described in the memoirs of novelist Marcel Pagnol.

In 1910, an offshoot of called pétanque was developed in the town of La Ciotat, in Provence. It eventually became the dominant boules sport in France, and is widely played in other European countries.

==Types==
Boules games may be sub-divided into two categories based on typical throwing technique: 
* games where the balls are rolled (for example, bocce)
* games where the balls are thrown (for example, pétanque, bocce volo)
Boules games may also be subdivided into two other categories based on typical throwing technique: 
* games where there is a &quot;run up&quot; to the throw (for example, boule lyonnaise, bocce volo)
* games where there is no &quot;run up&quot; to the throw (for example, pétanque)
Alternatively, boules games may be subdivided into categories based on the structure and material of the ball: 
* games where the balls are solid and made out of wood, or a wood-like plastic, composite, or epoxy resin similar to billiard balls (for example, bocce)
* games where the balls are hollow and made out of metal, typically steel or bronze (for example, pétanque, bocce volo)
* games where the balls are stuffed and made out of leather or some similar soft material (boccia, &quot;soft pétanque&quot;)
Alternatively, boules games may be subdivided into categories based on the shape of the ball: 
* games where the balls are spherical (most boules games)
* games where the balls are not spherical, but have a shape bias designed to cause the ball to travel a curved path (bowls)
There may be other variations as well, for instance in the way the ball is launched, in the dimensions of the playing area, whether obstacles (such as trees) are considered in-bounds or out-of-bounds, and whether it is legal to play balls off of enclosing boards or obstacles. 
* Balls are typically thrown underhand (as in softball) rather than overhand (as in baseball). In games where the balls are rolled, the delivery is typically done with the palm of the hand up, whereas in games where the balls are thrown, the delivery is typically done palm down. A palm-down delivery can give a thrown ball backspin, which helps to keep it from rolling away from the spot to which it has been thrown.
* Bocce, a rolling game, is played on a smooth, prepared court with markers and sideboards; the sideboards are a recognized part of the game and shots may be bounced off of the sideboards. In contrast, pétanque, a throwing game, can be played on almost any relatively flat, unprepared outdoor surface. Sideboards are not a recognized part of the game — although an out-of-play line (or &quot;dead boule line&quot;) is.
Finally, some boules games (bocce, pétanque) began as variations of earlier games, deliberately created and designed to accommodate the needs of players with physical disabilities.

Such variations produce a wide variety of boules-type games played all over the world.

==Terminology==
* is a French word for &#x27;ball&#x27;.
* (plural: &quot;bocce&quot;) is an Italian word for &#x27;ball&#x27;
* (roughly, &#x27;flying&#x27; or &#x27;in flight&#x27;) is derived from the Italian verb meaning &#x27;to fly&#x27;
* The small wooden target ball is usually called the &quot;jack&quot; in English, (&#x27;target&#x27;) or (&#x27;piglet&#x27;) in French, or (&#x27;little ball&#x27; or &#x27;bullet&#x27;) in Italian.
In Italian bocce, balls may be thrown in three ways: , and .
* A shot or is the way of pointing a ball by rolling the ball as close as possible to the pallino.
* A or shot is the way of knocking an opponent&#x27;s ball away that is very close to the pallino by rolling very fast. The player is allowed to make a run of two to four steps before delivering the ball.
* A shot is the way of hitting an opponent&#x27;s ball that is very close to the pallino by throwing through the air and hitting directly the opponent&#x27;s boule (or the pallino), with the restriction that the ball may first strike the ground within 50 cm of the target.

==Balls==
There is a wide variation in the size and materials of the balls used in boules-type games.

Originally, in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, the balls were probably made of stone.

Gallic tribes, which were introduced to boules by the Romans, used wooden boules. In 19th-century France, boules were typically made of a very hard wood, boxwood root.

In the mid-19th century, techniques were developed for the mass production of iron nails. Following this technological improvement, boxwood balls studded with nails (boules cloutées) were introduced in an effort to improve the durability of the balls. This eventually led to the development of balls that were completely covered in nails, creating a ball that appeared almost to be made of metal.

By the 1920s, the growing popularity of boules in France created a demand that could not be satisfied using the available supplies of natural boxwood root, which were beginning to disappear. Paul Courtieu and Vincent Miles had the idea of manufacturing a ball made entirely of metal. Avoiding steel-based alloys (which were too hard and rust-prone) they developed an alloy based on aluminum and bronze, and (in 1923) patented a metal ball made of two welded-together hemispheres. A year later, in 1924, they filed a patent for a ball that was cast in a single piece -- &quot;La Boule intégrale&quot;. Louis Tarchier and Jean Blanc are generally credited with developing, around 1925, the process by which virtually all metal boules are manufactured today—steel blanks are pressed into hollow hemispheres which are then soldered together and machined to make a hollow steel boule.

Today, some boules sports (e.g. bocce) still use wooden (or epoxy composite) balls, while others (e.g. pétanque) use metal balls. The wooden balls used in bocce tend to be bigger than the smaller metal balls used in pétanque.

==Games==
The same game can be known by different names in different languages and locations or the same name can be used for different local variations of a game.

The category of boules games includes the following:
* Bocce is the ancestral sport of most boules games. It is a rolling game using wooden balls and a run-up throwing technique.
* Bocce volo (boule lyonnaise) is a throwing game using metal balls and a rather complicated run-up.
* Boccia is a form of bocce adapted for players who use wheelchairs and has been part of the Paralympic Games since the 1984 Summer Paralympics.
* Bolas criollas is a bocce-like game played in Venezuela
* Bowls or &quot;lawn bowls&quot; is a British game similar to bocce
* Jeu provençal or boule lyonnaise, similar to bocce volo 
* Pétanque originally evolved from jeu provençal as an adaptation for a player with a disability affecting the legs. However, it quickly became popular among able-bodied players. It is a throwing game using metal balls, but there is no run-up. Players&#x27; feet must remain firmly on the ground.
* Punto, raffa, volo (note that this is a single name consisting of three comma-separated words) is a type of bocce governed by the Italian Confederazione Boccistica Internazionale (CBI).

==International boules organizations ==
The Confédération Mondiale des Sports de Boules (CMSB) was created (on 21 December 1985 in Monaco) by three international boules organizations for the purpose of lobbying the Olympic committee to make boules sports part of the summer Olympics. To date, its efforts have been unsuccessful. However, boccia has been part of the Paralympic Games since the 1984 Summer Paralympics. The organizations that joined together to create the CMSB were the following:
* Confederazione Boccistica Internazionale (CBI) (raffa)
* Fédération Internationale de Boules (FIB) (boule Lyonnaise)
* Fédération Internationale de Pétanque et Jeu Provençal (FIPJP) (pétanque)

<text>City News Bureau of Chicago (CNB), or City Press (1890–2005), was a news bureau that served as one of the first cooperative news agencies in the United States. It was founded in 1890 by the newspapers of Chicago to provide a common source of local and breaking news and also used by them as a training ground for new reporters, described variously as &quot;journalism&#x27;s school of hard knocks&quot; or &quot;the reporter&#x27;s boot camp.&quot; Hundreds of reporters &quot;graduated&quot; from the City News Bureau into newspaper dailies—both local and national—or other avenues of writing.

==Operations==
The City News Bureau had reporters in all important news sites, courthouses, Chicago City Hall, the County Building, Criminal Courts, as well as having as many as ten police reporters on duty. It operated around the clock and all year round. The reporters, though young, worked in competition with some of the best reporters in the country, working on the same stories as all the others, questioning politicians and police, and fighting for scoops.

They covered every single death reported to the coroner&#x27;s office, every important meeting, every news conference, every court case that had once been a news story, even if the trial wasn&#x27;t newsworthy.

The training was rigorous. The reporters were all amateurs when they came to work, but the rewrite men were professionals, accustomed to teaching in a hard school. Turnover was rapid at CNB as reporters eagerly sought newspaper jobs as soon as they felt they had paid their dues in CNB trenches.

One graduate was Kurt Vonnegut. He described his work there in the late 1940s in terms that could have been used by almost any other City Press reporter of any era:
:&quot;I&#x27;m very proud I worked there. It was like being a soldier.&quot;

:&quot;Well, the Chicago City News Bureau was a tripwire for all the newspapers in town when I was there, and there were five papers, I think. We were out all the time around the clock and every time we came across a really juicy murder or scandal or whatever, they’d send the big time reporters and photographers, otherwise they’d run our stories. So that’s what I was doing, and I was going to university at the same time.&quot;

A legendary story held that a young reporter who called in a story of the slaying of an infant was sent back to get the answer to the question, &quot;What color were the dead baby&#x27;s eyes?&quot; Certainly, all the young reporters were sent back to get more information so that they would learn to get it in the first place. Another watchword: &quot;If your mother tells you she loves you, check it out with two independent sources&quot; or &quot;If your mother says she loves you, check it out.&quot;

The City News Bureau had special operations for covering elections in Chicago and Cook County, providing regular updates precinct by precinct years before such coverage was common. A similar service reported on the scores of most high-school games in Chicago, but otherwise there was no sports coverage.

The film &quot;Call Northside 777&quot;, in which James Stewart plays a reporter whose articles free an innocent man from prison, was based on a story that originated at the City News Bureau.

The City News Bureau broke the story of the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre in 1929, but, for once, didn&#x27;t quite believe its reporter, Walter Spirko, and sent the following bulletin:
:Six men are reported to have been seriously injured . . .

Spirko continued as a Chicago reporter for many years, breaking a story of thieving policemen known as the Summerdale police scandal.

The City News Bureau didn&#x27;t always confine its scoops to local stories. One momentous non-local event originated on a quiet Sunday in 1941, when a reporter at the Damen Avenue police station on the city&#x27;s near-northwest side was slowly twisting a dial on the desk sergeant&#x27;s short wave radio when he heard toe static-punctuated voice of an amateur radio operator telling another &quot;ham&quot; that &quot;bombs are falling all over Honolulu.&quot; The eavesdropping reporter could hear explosions in the background of the radio transmission. He phoned what he had heard to his city editor, who immediately sent bulletins to the CNB&#x27;s four major newspapers and the member of the Associated Press. It caught the AP by surprise and within seconds the report was on news wires worldwide. CNB was the first to break the news of Japan&#x27;s Attack on Pearl Harbor.

Playwright Charles MacArthur, co-author of the play &quot;The Front Page&quot;, was a City Press reporter; several of the characters in the play were based on City Press personalities, notably the skittish assistant managing editor Larry Mulay.

Other well-known alumni: syndicated columnist and &quot;Politico&quot; editor Roger Simon, reclusive media mogul Fred Eychaner, environmental journalist William Allen, investigative reporter Seymour Hersh, &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist David Brooks (author of &quot;Bobos in Paradise&quot;), pop artist Claes Oldenburg, public-television personality John Callaway, editor Russell Freeburg, consumer advocate David Horowitz, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Mike Royko, Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist Herbert Lawrence Block (commonly known as Herblock), and Jack Star, later to become senior editor of Look (American magazine) and perennial freelance writer for Chicago Magazine.

Clarence John Boettiger, son-in-law of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, became a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; police reporter after working for the City News Bureau to begin his career. Elizabeth Austin of the bureau later became a speechwriter for one Illinois governor and communications director for another. Tom Quinn, who worked for City News in 1964 while a student at Northwestern, later managed Jerry Brown&#x27;s first campaign for governor of California, became chairman of California&#x27;s Air Resources Board and the state&#x27;s Environmental Secretary, and served as chairman for two of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley&#x27;s campaigns. 

Other mainstays of City News Bureau&#x27;s staff included Arnold Dornfeld, Melvyn Douglas, Susan Kuczka, Paul Zimbrakos, Milton Golin, Bernard Judge. Isaac Gershman served as managing editor from 1931-1964.

The City News Bureau had three teletype wires, one for the Chicago dailies, one for radio and television stations, and one for press releases. In addition, it owned a pneumatic tube system that ran under Chicago streets connecting all the Chicago dailies, including those that no longer existed. The office kept a speaker system tuned live 24 hours to the coded Chicago police radio dispatcher frequency, announcing addresses to which City News Bureau reporters were sent.

As Chicago went down to only two daily newspapers, the City News Bureau slowly faded and was reduced to a minor operation. It was still widely used by both papers, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, until the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; decided to pull out of the joint ownership agreement it had inherited from the City News Bureau&#x27;s original owners, for which the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; was a successor paper. The PR Newswire, which was part of City News, was sold; the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; decided it cost too much to keep City News running, and it was closed after its last dispatch February 28, 1999. Electronic news media—both radio and television—both used City News throughout the 1990s, until the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;, owned by Conrad Black&#x27;s Hollinger International, decided to pull out. (After Black was indicted in 2005 on charges of looting Hollinger, some speculated his desire to squeeze cash out of the company&#x27;s properties helped hasten the demise of the original City News.)

The New City News Service, owned by the &quot;Tribune&quot;, opened soon thereafter, and soon changed its name to the City News Service. Though smaller, it was run by Paul Zimbrakos, a 40-plus year employee of the old CNB, and the bureau&#x27;s last editor. &quot;Sun-Times&quot; management had thought they would be able to create a new, cheaper wire service, staffed with few people. When that venture—called Alliance News—failed, for a while the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; used the part-time help of Medill News Service, staffed by unpaid journalism students from the Medill School of Journalism. The &quot;Sun-Times&quot;, however, was barred from receiving the New City News Service wire because of its being in competition with the &quot;Tribune&quot;.

Though the &quot;Tribune&quot; had been hailed by former City Newsers as a savior of CNB, on December 1, 2005, the &quot;Tribune&quot; informed the 19 employees of City News Service that their jobs were being eliminated as part of cost-cutting measures going on throughout the Tribune Company. (See Associated Press and other news stories of December 1 &amp; December 2, 2005.) &quot;Tribune&quot; editors and executives reasoned that CNS was providing the &quot;Tribune&#x27;s&quot; competitors&#x27; Web sites with news that the paper itself should have exclusively, the better to compete in an age of Internet news distribution.

The City News Service closed at the end of 2005, and was swallowed into a smaller &quot;Tribune&quot; Internet news operation.

City News lives on, in spirit, at least, at the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;. In February 2006, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; worked to fill the void felt at the city&#x27;s TV and radio stations by the demise of the old City News by starting its own 24-hour newswire, the STNG Wire. The key to the operation, staffed by veterans of both the original and the &quot;Tribune&quot;-run City News, is the Daybook, the invaluable daily listing of press conferences, court activity and other events throughout the Chicago metropolitan area, which is shared with subscribers and the Sun Times News Group family. The STNG wire also covers the blood and guts news—the fires, murders, shootings, stabbings, automobile accidents—that City News was known for, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Former City News Editor Paul Zimbrakos continues to teach young journalists through his City News Bureau course at Loyola University Chicago. Here is the course description from the Loyola School of Communication website:

&quot;In fall 2009 the School of Communication started offering students access to a Chicago news gathering institution the City News Bureau. For over 100 years Chicago hosted one of the best news bureaus in the country. Young reporters learned at The City New Bureau of Chicago how the city worked and how they could best cover the city. We are re-launching that bureau in the form of a course this fall. It will be taught by two remarkable journalism veterans. Paul Zimbrakos was the Managing Editor of the bureau for a number of years before it closed its doors and tutored many of the best journalists in the country. Jack Smith was the former CBS Bureau Chief in Chicago and Washington DC. Together they will make this class a rich learning lab and help students discover how best to cover a city and its inner-workings.&quot;

Zimbrakos passed away May 31, 2022, according to CBS News Chicago.

<doc id="65974" wikidata="Q616622" url="?curid=65974" title="First-person narrative">
<text>A first-person narrative (also known as a first-person perspective, voice, point of view, etc.) is a mode of storytelling in which a storyteller recounts events from that storyteller&#x27;s own personal point of view, using first-person grammar such as &quot;I&quot;, &quot;me&quot;, &quot;my&quot;, and &quot;myself&quot; (also, in plural form, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, etc.). It must be narrated by a first-person character, such as a protagonist (or other focal character), re-teller, witness, or peripheral character. Alternatively, in a visual storytelling medium (such as video, television, or film), the first-person perspective is a graphical perspective rendered through a character&#x27;s visual field, so the camera is &quot;seeing&quot; out of a character&#x27;s eyes. 

A classic example of a first-person protagonist narrator is Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1847), in which the title character is telling the story in which she herself is also the protagonist: &quot;I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me&quot;. &quot;Srikanta&quot; by Bengali writer Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay is another first-person perspective novel which is often called a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Srikanta, the title character and protagonist of the novel, tells his own story: &quot;What memories and thoughts crowd into my mind, as, at the threshold of the afternoon of my wandering life, I sit down to write the story of its morning hours!&quot;

This device allows the audience to see the narrator&#x27;s mind&#x27;s eye view of the fictional universe, but it is limited to the narrator&#x27;s experiences and awareness of the true state of affairs. In some stories, first-person narrators may relay dialogue with other characters or refer to information they heard from the other characters, in order to try to deliver a larger point of view. Other stories may switch the narrator to different characters to introduce a broader perspective. An unreliable narrator is one that has completely lost credibility due to ignorance, poor insight, personal biases, mistakes, dishonesty, etc., which challenges the reader&#x27;s initial assumptions.

==Point of view device==
An example of the telling of a story in the grammatical first person, i.e. from the perspective of &quot;I&quot;, is Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, which begins with &quot;Call me Ishmael.&quot;

First-person narration may sometimes include an embedded or implied audience of one or more people. The story may be told by a person directly undergoing the events in the story without being aware of conveying that experience to readers; alternatively, the narrator may be conscious of telling the story to a given audience, perhaps at a given place and time, for a given reason.

===Identity===
A story written in the first person is most often told by the main character, but may also be told from the perspective of a less important character as they witness events, or a person retelling a story they were told by someone else.

===Reliability===
First-person narration presents the narrative through the perspective of a particular character. The reader or audience sees the story through the narrator&#x27;s views and knowledge only. The narrator is an imperfect witness by definition, because they do not have a complete overview of events. Furthermore, they may be pursuing some hidden agenda (an &quot;unreliable narrator&quot;).

Character weaknesses and faults, such as tardiness, cowardice, or vice, may leave the narrator unintentionally absent or unreliable for certain key events. Specific events may further be colored or obscured by a narrator&#x27;s background since non-omniscient characters must by definition be laypersons and foreigners to some circles, and limitations such as poor eyesight and illiteracy may also leave important blanks. Another consideration is how much time has elapsed between when the character experienced the events of the story and when they decided to tell them. If only a few days have passed, the story could be related very differently than if the character was reflecting on events of the distant past. The character&#x27;s motivation is also relevant. Are they just trying to clear up events for their own peace of mind? Make a confession about a wrong they did? Or tell a good adventure tale to their beer-guzzling friends? The reason why a story is told will also affect how it is written. Why is this narrator telling the story in this way, why now, and are they to be trusted? Unstable or malevolent narrators can also lie to the reader. Unreliable narrators are not uncommon.

In the first-person-plural point of view, narrators tell the story using &quot;we&quot;. That is, no individual speaker is identified; the narrator is a member of a group that acts as a unit. The first-person-plural point of view occurs rarely but can be used effectively, sometimes as a means to increase the concentration on the character or characters the story is about. Examples include:
* William Faulkner&#x27;s short story &quot;A Rose for Emily&quot; (Faulkner was an avid experimenter in using unusual points of view; see also his &quot;Spotted Horses&quot;, told in third-person plural).
* Frank B. Gilbreth and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey&#x27;s memoir &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;.
* Theodore Sturgeon&#x27;s short story &quot;Crate&quot;.
* Frederik Pohl&#x27;s &quot;Man Plus&quot;.
* Jeffrey Eugenides&#x27;s &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;.
* Karen Joy Fowler&#x27;s &quot;The Jane Austen Book Club&quot;.
* Joshua Ferris&#x27;s &quot;Then We Came to the End&quot;.
* Heidi Vornbrock Roosa&#x27;s &quot;Our Mother Who Art&quot;.

Other examples include &quot;Twenty-Six Men and a Girl&quot; by Maxim Gorky, &quot;The Treatment of Bibi Haldar&quot; by Jhumpa Lahiri, &quot;During the Reign of the Queen of Persia&quot; by Joan Chase, &quot;Our Kind&quot; by Kate Walbert, &quot;I, Robot&quot; by Isaac Asimov, and &quot;We Didn&#x27;t&quot; by Stuart Dybek.

First-person narrators can also be multiple, as in Ryūnosuke Akutagawa&#x27;s &quot;In a Grove&quot; (the source for the movie &quot;Rashomon&quot;) and Faulkner&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;. Each of these sources provides different accounts of the same event, from the point of view of various first-person narrators.

There can also be multiple co-principal characters as narrator, such as in Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;. The first chapter introduces four characters, including the initial narrator, who is named at the beginning of the chapter. The narrative continues in subsequent chapters with a different character explicitly identified as the narrator for that chapter. Other characters later introduced in the book also have their &quot;own&quot; chapters where they narrate the story for that chapter. The story proceeds in a linear fashion, and no event occurs more than once, i.e. no two narrators speak &quot;live&quot; about the same event.

The first-person narrator may be the principal character (e.g., Gulliver in &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;), someone very close to them who is privy to their thoughts and actions (Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes stories) or one who closely observes the principal character (such as Nick Carraway in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;). These can be distinguished as &quot;first-person major&quot; or &quot;first-person minor&quot; points of view.

Narrators can report others&#x27; narratives at one or more removes. These are called &quot;frame narrators&quot;: examples are Mr. Lockwood, the narrator in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; by Emily Brontë; and the unnamed narrator in &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; by Joseph Conrad. Skilled writers choose to skew narratives, in keeping with the narrator&#x27;s character, to an arbitrary degree, from ever so slight to extreme. For example, the aforementioned Mr. Lockwood is quite naive, of which fact he appears unaware, simultaneously rather pompous, and recounting a combination of stories, experiences, and servants&#x27; gossip. As such, his character is an unintentionally very unreliable narrator and serves mainly to mystify, confuse, and ultimately leave the events of Wuthering Heights open to a great range of interpretations.

A rare form of the first person is the first-person omniscient, in which the narrator is a character in the story, but also knows the thoughts and feelings of all the other characters. It can seem like third-person omniscient at times. A reasonable explanation fitting the mechanics of the story&#x27;s world is generally provided or implied unless its glaring absence is a major plot point. Three notable examples are &quot;The Book Thief&quot; by Markus Zusak, where the narrator is Death, &quot;From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler&quot;, where the narrator is the titular character but is describing the story of the main characters, and &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; by Alice Sebold, where a young girl, having been killed, observes, from some post-mortem, extracorporeal viewpoint, her family&#x27;s struggle to cope with her disappearance. Typically, however, the narrator restricts the events relayed in the narrative to those that could reasonably be known.

==Autobiography==
In autobiographical fiction, the first-person narrator is the character of the author (with varying degrees of historical accuracy). The narrator is still distinct from the author and must behave like any other character and any other first-person narrator. Examples of this kind of narrator include Jim Carroll in &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot; and Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. in &quot;Timequake&quot; (in this case, the first-person narrator is also the author). In some cases, the narrator is writing a book—&quot;the book in your hands&quot;—and therefore he has most of the powers and knowledge of the author. Examples include &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; by Umberto Eco, and &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; by Mark Haddon. Another example is a fictional &quot;Autobiography of James T. Kirk&quot; which was &quot;Edited&quot; by David A. Goodman who was the actual writer of that book and playing the part of James Kirk (Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s Star Trek) as he wrote the novel.

==Detective fiction==
Since the narrator is within the story, he or she may not have knowledge of all the events. For this reason, the first-person narrative is often used for detective fiction, so that the reader and narrator uncover the case together. One traditional approach in this form of fiction is for the main detective principal assistant, the &quot;Watson&quot;, to be the narrator: this derives from the character of Dr. Watson in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes stories.

==Forms==
First-person narratives can appear in several forms; interior monologue, as in Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Notes from Underground&quot;; dramatic monologue, also in Albert Camus&#x27; &quot;The Fall&quot;; or explicitly, as Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.&quot;

Other forms include temporary first-person narration as a story within a story, wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily, and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the focal character.

==Styles==
With a first-person narrative it is important to consider how the story is being told, i.e., is the character writing it down, telling it out loud, thinking it to themselves? And if they are writing it down, is it something meant to be read by the public, a private diary, or a story meant for one other person? The way the first-person narrator is relating the story will affect the language used, the length of sentences, the tone of voice, and many other things. A story presented as a secret diary could be interpreted much differently than a public statement.

First-person narratives can tend towards a stream of consciousness and interior monologue, as in Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;. The whole of the narrative can itself be presented as a false document, such as a diary, in which the narrator makes explicit reference to the fact that he is writing or telling a story. This is the case in Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;. As a story unfolds, narrators may be aware that they are telling a story and of their reasons for telling it. The audience that they believe they are addressing can vary. In some cases, a frame story presents the narrator as a character in an outside story who begins to tell their own story, as in Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.

First-person narrators are often unreliable narrators since a narrator might be impaired (such as both Quentin and Benjy in Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;), lie (as in &quot;The Quiet American&quot; by Graham Greene, or &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot; series by Gene Wolfe), or manipulate their own memories intentionally or not (as in &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; by Kazuo Ishiguro, or in Ken Kesey&#x27;s &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;). Henry James discusses his concerns about &quot;the romantic privilege of the &#x27;first person in his preface to &quot;The Ambassadors&quot;, calling it &quot;the darkest abyss of romance.&quot;

One example of a multi-level narrative structure is Joseph Conrad&#x27;s novella &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, which has a double framework: an unidentified &quot;I&quot; (first person singular) narrator relates a boating trip during which another character, Marlow, uses the first person to tell a story that comprises the majority of the work. Within this nested story, it is mentioned that another character, Kurtz, told Marlow a lengthy story; however, its content is not revealed to readers. Thus, there is an &quot;I&quot; narrator introducing a storyteller as &quot;he&quot; (Marlow), who talks about himself as &quot;I&quot; and introduces another storyteller as &quot;he&quot; (Kurtz), who in turn presumably told his story from the perspective of &quot;I&quot;.

==Films==
First-person narration is more difficult to achieve in film; however, voice-over narration can create the same structure.

An example of first-person narration in a film would be the narration given by the character Greg Heffley in the film adaptation of the popular book series &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&quot;.

<text>Other Losses is a 1989 book by Canadian writer James Bacque, which makes the claim that U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower intentionally caused the deaths by starvation or exposure of around a million German prisoners of war held in Western internment camps after the Second World War. &quot;Other Losses&quot; charges that hundreds of thousands of German prisoners that had fled the Eastern front were designated as &quot;Disarmed Enemy Forces&quot; in order to avoid recognition under the Geneva Convention (1929), for the purpose of carrying out their deaths through disease or slow starvation. &quot;Other Losses&quot; cites documents in the U.S. National Archives and interviews with people who stated they witnessed the events. The book claims that a &quot;method of genocide&quot; was present in the banning of Red Cross inspectors, the returning of food aid, soldier ration policy, and policy regarding shelter building.

Stephen Ambrose, a historian enlisted by the Eisenhower Center for American Studies in 1990 in efforts to preserve Eisenhower&#x27;s legacy and counteract criticisms of his presidency, and seven other American historians examined the book soon after its publication and concluded that it was inaccurate and pseudohistory. Other historians, including the former senior historian of the United States Army Center of Military History, Colonel Ernest F. Fisher, who was involved in the 1945 investigations into the allegations of misconduct by U.S. troops in Germany and who wrote the book&#x27;s foreword, argue that the claims are accurate.

== Content ==
=== The &quot;other losses&quot; statistic ===
The title of &quot;Other Losses&quot; derives from a column of figures in weekly U.S. Army reports that Bacque states actually reflects a body count of German prisoners that died of slow starvation or diseases. The book states that Colonel Philip Lauben, chief of German Affairs Branch at SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force), confirmed that &quot;other losses&quot; meant deaths and escapes, with escapes being a minor part. This is supported by a US Army document lodged in the US National Archives which &quot;plainly states&quot; that the &quot;other losses&quot; category of prisoners was for deaths and escapes. Bacque dismisses claims from his opponents that &quot;other losses&quot; meant transfers or discharges, as these are accounted for in other columns in the same tables. Furthermore, there is no separate column in which deaths were recorded.

The book refers to the Army Chief Historians report that was published in 1947; in the 20 pages dealing with the capture, transfer and discharge of prisoners, the report makes no mention of releasing prisoners without formal discharge. Furthermore, Bacque cites Army orders from General Eisenhower himself (Disbandment Directive No. 1) stating that every prisoner leaving captivity had to have discharge papers.

=== Disarmed Enemy Forces designation ===
&quot;Other Losses&quot; states that Eisenhower sought to sidestep the requirements of the Geneva Convention through the designation of these prisoners as Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEF), specifically stating that &quot;in March, as Germany was being cracked ... a message was being signed and initialed by Eisenhower proposed a startling departure from the Geneva Convention (GC)—the creation of a new class of prisoners who would not be fed by the Army after the surrender of Germany.&quot;

The book states that, against the orders of his superiors, Eisenhower took 2 million additional prisoners after Germany&#x27;s surrender that fell under the DEF designation. According to the book, a million of those who died had fled the Eastern front and most likely ended up in Rheinwiesenlager prisoner transit camps run by the United States and French forces where many such prisoners died of disease or starvation under the cover of the DEF designation.

The book cites orders from Eisenhower which stipulated that the Germans would be solely responsible for feeding and maintaining the DEFs, however, he then prevented any aid from reaching them.

=== Body count of German prisoners ===
&quot;Other Losses&quot; contends that nearly one million German prisoners died while being held by the United States and French forces at the end of World War II. Specifically, it states: &quot;The victims undoubtedly number over 800,000, almost certainly over 900,000 and quite likely over a million. Their deaths were knowingly caused by army officers who had sufficient resources to keep the prisoners alive.&quot;

&quot;Other Losses&quot; contains an analysis of a medical record that it states supports the conclusion of a prisoner death rate of 30%. Bacque also referred to a 1950 report from the German Red Cross which stated that 1.5 million former German POWs were still officially listed as missing, fate unknown.

The book comments that approximately 15% of the deaths in the U.S. camps were from starvation or dehydration and that most deaths were caused by dysentery, pneumonia, or septicaemia, as a result of the unsanitary conditions and lack of medicine. Further, it states that officers from the U.S. Army Medical Corps reported death rates far higher than they had ever seen before.

The book states that Eisenhower&#x27;s staff were complicit in the scheme, and that in order to carry out such a scheme, Eisenhower kept these prisoners in camps far longer than was necessary It states that, by the end of 1945, only 40% of prisoners had been released. &quot;Other Losses&quot; further characterizes the 22-volume German &quot;Maschke&quot; Commission report investigating the deaths of German prisoners as written by &quot;client-academics&quot; as part of a &quot;cover-up&quot; of the supposed deaths.

=== Treatment of prisoners ===
&quot;Other Losses&quot; states that the U.S. dismantled the German welfare agencies, including the German Red Cross, then dismissed the Swiss Government from its role as Protecting Power. No agencies were allowed to visit the camps or provide any assistance to the prisoners, including delegates from ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross), which was a violation of the Geneva Convention. It further states that the only notable protest against this was from William Lyon Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of Canada.

Bacque comments that the press was also prevented from visiting the camps, and therefore was unable to report on the state of the camps and the condition of the prisoners.

The book states that many of the U.S. camps consisted of open fields surrounded by barbed wire, with no shelter or toilet facilities. In these camps prisoners were forced to sleep on the ground in the open, though it claims the U.S. Army had plenty of surplus shelter supplies which could have been issued. No supplies such as blankets were supplied to the prisoners, even though these were in good supply at various locations such as the depot at Naples. In a letter, General Everett Hughes stated that there were &quot;more stocks than we can ever use; stretch as far as eye can see.&quot;

The book quotes Dr. Konrad Adenauer (later Chancellor of Germany) stating that &quot;The German prisoners have been penned up for weeks without any protection from the weather, without drinking water, without medical care. They are being held in a manner contrary to all humanitarian principles and flagrantly contrary to the Hague and Geneva Conventions.&quot;

Both J. P. Pradervand (ICRC French Delegation) and Henry Dunning (American Red Cross) sent letters to the State Department condemning the poor treatment of the German prisoners. Colonel Philip Lauben stated that &quot;The Vosges was just one big death camp.&quot;

=== Prisoner totals ===
According to &quot;Other Losses&quot;, the U.S. Army employed a number of methods to reduce the number of prisoners officially on hand. One method was to accuse the Russians of taking far more prisoners than they reported. Another was the &quot;midnight shift&quot;, whereby the opening balance of a given week was less than the closing balance of the previous week.

The book describes that a &quot;Missing Million&quot; prisoners exist in the difference in totals between two U.S. army reports (the last of the daily reports and the first of the weekly reports) issued on June 2, 1945. As a consequence of this, according to Quartermaster&#x27;s reports the number of rations issued to the camps was reduced by 900,000.

&quot;Other Losses&quot; states that after visiting many of the camps in August 1945, Major General Robert M. Littlejohn (Quartermaster of the ETO) concluded that the U.S. Army was reporting 3.7 million prisoners while it actually possessed 5.2 million, thereby corroborating the conclusions made in a report three months earlier from Lieutenant General John C. H. Lee (in charge of logistics for the ETO), which he had sent to SHAEF headquarters. &quot;Other Losses&quot; states that Littlejohn subsequently wrote in a report to Washington that because requisitions for supplies were based on these faulty numbers, 1.5 million prisoners were getting no food.

&quot;Other Losses&quot; states that, three years later, in 1948 the ICRC formally requested documents confirming the total number of prisoners in the U.S. Zone and was eventually told that 3.5 million were there, which omitted approximately 1.7 million from the actual number of 5,224,000.

=== Food shortage ===

&quot;Other Losses&quot; explicates the 1944–1949 German food crisis to support claims for a high mortality rate.

&quot;Other Losses&quot; concludes that the 1945 food crisis in Europe was contrived by Allied forces by the use of restrictive food import policy, including restrictions on Red Cross food deliveries, and other means. It states that Eisenhower purposefully starved German prisoners given that &quot;[t]here was a lot more wheat available in the combined areas of western Germany, France, Britain, Canada and the USA than there had been in the same year in 1939.&quot; &quot;Other Losses&quot; states that, in May 1945, the ICRC had 100,000 tons of food in storage warehouses in Switzerland. According to the book, when they tried to send trainloads of this food into the U.S. Zone, the U.S. Army sent the trains back, saying their own warehouses were full. &quot;Other Losses&quot; states that this prompted Max Huber, head of the ICRC, to send a strong letter of protest to the State Department, in which he described the difficulties placed by SHAEF in the way of the ICRC efforts to provide aid. He said, &quot;Our responsibility for the proper use of relief supplies placed in our care is incompatible with a restriction to the fulfilment of orders which render us powerless to furnish relief which we ourselves judge necessary.&quot;

U.S. Army warehouses had 13.5 million Red Cross food parcels taken from the ICRC, which were never distributed. The book also states that German civilians were prevented from bringing food to the camps, and that Red Cross food parcels were confiscated by SHAEF, and the War Department banned them from being given to the men in the camps. The book states that Bacque found no evidence of a drastic food shortage in the U.S. Army —
* &quot;We had so much food we didn’t know what to do with it.&quot; — Colonel Henry Settle, 106th division.
* &quot;We are not in any desperate need of extra food.&quot; — Lt Colonel Bailey, SHAEF.
* &quot;There is in this Theater a substantial excess of subsistence ... over 3,000,000 rations a day less than those requisitioned were issued.&quot; — General Robert Littlejohn, Quartermaster of the ETO.

== Reception and criticism ==

=== The New Orleans panel ===
After the publication of Bacque&#x27;s book, a panel of eight historians gathered for a symposium in the Eisenhower Center for American Studies at the University of New Orleans from December 7–8, 1990 to review Bacque&#x27;s work. In the introduction to a book later published containing each panellists&#x27; papers, Steven E. Ambrose noted that Bacque is a Canadian novelist with no previous historical research or writing experience. His introduction concludes that &quot;&quot;Other Losses&quot; is seriously—nay, spectacularly—flawed in its most fundamental aspects.&quot; The panel comments that, among its many problems, &quot;Other Losses&quot;:
* misuses documents
* misreads documents
* ignores contrary evidence
* employs a statistical methodology that is hopelessly compromised
* made no attempt to see the evidence he has gathered in relation to the broader situation
* made no attempt to perform any comparative context
* puts words into the mouths of the subjects of his oral history
* ignores a readily available and absolutely critical source that decisively dealt with his central accusation

As a consequence of those and other shortcomings, the book &quot;makes charges that are demonstrably absurd.&quot; Panel member Stephen Ambrose later wrote in the &quot;New York Times&quot;:

Historians Gunter Bischof and Brian Loring Villa stated that a research report from the panel &quot;soundly refuted the charges of &quot;Other Losses&quot;, especially Bacque&#x27;s fanciful handling of statistics.&quot; The historians further stated:

The New Orleans panel&#x27;s book introduction concluded &quot;[t]hat Bacque is wrong on nearly every major and nearly all his minor charges seem to us to be overwhelmingly obvious. To sum up: Eisenhower was not a Hitler, he did not run death camps, German prisoners did not die by the hundreds of thousands, there was indeed a severe world food shortage in 1945, there was nothing sinister or secret about DEF designation or about the Other Losses column. Bacque&#x27;s &quot;Missing Million&quot; were old and young boys in the militia dismissed early from the American camps; they were escapees from camps and POWs/DEFs transferred from camp to camp in Germany and Europe for various reasons.&quot;

Villa states that &quot;James Bacque&#x27;s &quot;Other Losses&quot; illustrates what happens when the context surrounding historical persons and important events is lost. The effect to give known facts a twist that seems dramatically new in important ways, but this is means the appearance of originality is a little deceptive. For the most part, Bacque&#x27;s book is not very original at all. When it seems so, the price is purchased at the price of accuracy.&quot; He further stated that &quot;[t]hose parts of Other Losses that might rise above a failing grade in an undergraduate term paper are not new. It has long been known that German prisoners of war suffered terribly at the end of World War II, that they died by the thousands after hostilities ceased in the European theater, and that many were required to work as forced laborers for the victors.&quot; The main lines of the story have long been known, written up for example in the extensive German &quot;Maschke Commission&quot; between 1962 and 1975. Villa states that Bacque only adds two &quot;novel&quot; propositions: first, that the number that died was in the hundreds of thousands, and seconds, that these deaths were the result of deliberate extermination on the part of Eisenhower. &quot;The falsity of Bacque&#x27;s charges can be easily demonstrated once the context, particularly the decision-making environment, is examined.&quot;

Bischof concludes that just the application of common sense alone refutes many of the most &quot;fantastical charges&quot; of Bacque, such as asking the question &quot;How could a single man order one million men killed without being caught in the heinous act? How could the bodies disappear without one soldier&#x27;s coming forward in nearly fifty years to relieve his conscience? How could the Americans (almost one-third of whom are by ethnic background German) conspire for so long to cover up such a vast crime?&quot;

In a 1989 &quot;Time Magazine&quot; book review, Ambrose did, however, apart from his criticisms of the book, concede that &quot;We as Americans can&#x27;t duck the fact that terrible things happened. And they happened at the end of a war we fought for decency and freedom, and they are not excusable.&quot;

=== Documentary evidence of deaths ===
&quot;Other Losses&quot; asserts that roughly a million German prisoners—the &quot;Missing Million&quot;—disappeared between two reports issued on June 2, 1945, with one (the last of the daily reports) totaling prisoners in the European Theater of Operations (ETO) in U.S. custody at 2,870,400, while the other (the first of the weekly reports) gives the figure as 1,836,000 prisoners in the Communication Zone (COM Z). As a consequence of this, according to Quartermaster Reports the number of rations issued to the camps was reduced by 900,000. Historian Albert Cowdrey states that the reason for this is simply that COM Z is a subordinate of the ETO, and its figures omit prisoners held by other armies. In fact, Cowdrey states that the two documents further both cite exactly the same number of total prisoners in the ETO: 3,193,747. Cowdrey concludes &quot;[t]o judge by these documents, there was no Missing Million. There was not even a missing one.&quot;

The title of &quot;Other Losses&quot; derives from the heading of a column in weekly reports of the U.S. Army&#x27;s theater provost marshal, which &quot;Other Losses&quot; states is actually a &quot;body count&quot; of dead prisoners. Cowdrey states that, in many cases, as explained by the footnotes in the very documents themselves, the &quot;other losses&quot; were transfers between zones and camps, which were regularly done for a variety of reasons, none of them sinister and all properly noted in the accompanying documents. Cowdrey further states that, not only are these figures many times mentioned in the footnotes, but they are also reflected in the actual increase and decrease in numbers of each camp in the individual army reports. Cowdrey concludes &quot;it is unclear how Bacque could have failed either to see these documents or, if he saw them, to understand their significance to the book he was writing.&quot; In addition, while &quot;Other Losses&quot; asserts that these prisoners died of diseases or slow starvation, Cowdrey states that even a cursory glance at the figures shows that this would have been impossible, with figures varying between zero and over 189,000 from week to week.

The introduction to the book publishing many of the New Orleans panel papers also noted that Bacque ignored the greatest source of for the &quot;other losses&quot; column, an August 1945 Report of the Military Governor that states &quot;An additional group of 664,576 are lists as &quot; &#x27;other losses&#x27; &quot;, consisting largely of members of the Volkssturm [People&#x27;s Militia] released without a formal charge.&quot; It stated that Bacque ignored this document despite its presence in the National Archives, the Eisenhower Library and elsewhere. It further stated the dismissal of the Volkssturm (mostly old men and boys) &quot;accounts for most, quite probably all, of Bacque&#x27;s &#x27;Missing Million&#x27;&quot;. Bischof notes that, in his later American edition of &quot;Other Losses&quot;, Bacque discredits the document as a fake &quot;with a further fantastic twist in his convoluted cycle of conspiracy theories, he claims that Eisenhower and the army &#x27;camouflaged&#x27; dead POWs/DEFs by listing them as &#x27;discharged Volkssturm.&#x27;&quot; Even though Eisenhower himself did not write the document, Bacque concludes that it must have been &quot;doctored&quot;.

Of prisoners in French custody, the historian Rudiger Overmans wrote that, while the total number of prisoners dying in French custody might have exceeded the official statistic of 21,000, no evidence exists that it was hundreds of thousands of deaths higher than that figure, as Bacque claims. Overmans states that, in addition to the various problems with the Bacque&#x27;s &quot;death rate&quot; calculations regarding the Rheinwiesenlager transit camps, he ignores that these camps were managed almost entirely by Germans and falsely claimed that no record existed of the handover of the camps to the French in June and July 1945, when detailed records of the handover exist. Overmans also said that Bacque incorrectly claimed that the United States did nothing to help with the French Rheinwiesenlager camps, when the United States engaged in a large operation to raise the caloric intake of those prisoners. Bacque&#x27;s claims that the 167,000 in French camps that were &quot;dus pour des raisons divers&quot; (other losses) actually died in the winter of 1945–46 not only are not supported by the evidence, but they ignore French documents stating that that figure reflects the release of Volkssturm, women and the sick from those camps.

Overmans states that Bacque&#x27;s claim that the 800,000 to 1,000,000 missing prisoners were originally German soldiers that fled from the east into western hands contradicts Soviet POW evidence &quot;well established that we can exclude the idea of an extra million hiding somewhere in the figures.&quot; Overmans states that Bacque&#x27;s claim that one million fewer prisoners were taken by the Soviet Union than thought produces absurd results, such as that only 100,000 total prisoners could have died in Soviet hands when it is well documented that this amount was exceeded by the dead prisoners from Stalingrad alone. Bacque claimed that up to 500,000 of the missing prisoners were in Soviet camps. Postwar Soviet POW evidence was discredited when the KGB opened its archives in the 1990s and an additional 356,687 German soldiers and 93,900 civilians, previously recorded as missing, were found to be listed as dying in the Soviet camps. Overmans also states that, did they as Bacque claims, flee to the American Rheinwiesenlager camps, they could have easily had contact with their relatives and that it is &quot;quite inconceivable that these prisoners would not have been reported as missing by their relatives.&quot; Overmans states that the vast majority of this extra million would have been recorded in registrations that occurred in 1947–1948 and 1950, &quot;but the registrations showed nothing of the kind.&quot; Overmans further states that, as evidence that Germans believed that missing veterans were mostly in the west, Bacque relies on a statement by Konrad Adenauer that turns out in the minutes of the purported meeting to be a &quot;statement related to a TASS report concerning the POWs in the Soviet Union. So much for Bacque&#x27;s careful use of sources.&quot;

=== Plausibility of avoiding repercussion ===
Overmans states that, comporting with the most basic matters of common sense, &quot;if indeed 726,000 soldiers had died in the American camps (Bacque&#x27;s number excluding those who supposedly died in French custody or after discharge), what became of the bodies?&quot; Given that the Rheinwiesenlager stretched along 200 kilometers of the Rhine river, &quot;Bacque&#x27;s 726,000 dead would mean roughly 3,600 dead per kilometer or 5,800 per mile – better than one corpse per foot. Yet despite the widespread construction work carried out after the war, not a single one of these legions of dead was found.&quot; However, the sites where the camps were located are considered war graves where excavation is officially forbidden making such research problematical.

Villa states that, by Bacque&#x27;s reasoning, George C. Marshall, who gave SHAEF as much or more attention to detail than did Eisenhower, would be similarly guilty, perhaps more so under his reasoning, though &quot;Bacque&quot; who cares little for exploring the context, does not even raise the question.&quot; Villa states that &quot;It is a virtual impossibility that Eisenhower could have executed an extermination policy on his own&quot; and &quot;a near absolute impossibility that Marshall would not have noticed it, let alone that he would ever have tolerated it&quot; and &quot;what about the scores of officers and millions of soldiers who served under Eisenhower?&quot;

&quot;Other Losses&quot; argues that Eisenhower&#x27;s staff must have been implicated, charging &quot;[t]he squalor of the camps came from the moral squalor polluting the higher levels of the army.&quot; Villa states that &quot;[p]erhaps realizing that he already has a thesis involving a massive American conspiracy, Bacque is careful to exclude British officers from any participation or even knowledge of the crime. Although in his vast indictment, Bacque has included virtually Eisenhower&#x27;s entire staff, all the doctors and personnel running the camps, the press who failed to uncover the monstrous crime and a whole generation of knowing but silent Germans, he has included not a single Briton.&quot; Villa notes that Bacque ignores that SHAEF was a fully integrated Anglo-American command, and many of Eisenhower&#x27;s top officers were Britons who would have also had to cover up the conspiracy. Villa states that Bacque did not even need to read books to realize this, &quot;all he had to do was to look at the pictures: in slightly more than half the portraits contained therein, the staff officers wear British uniforms. Bacque, one understands, wants a villain in the piece. A complicated modern military bureaucracy such as SHAEF, is a tedious subject to study, unlikely to yield the insidious conspiracy apparently sought by this ex-publisher.&quot; Villa stated regarding the plausibility of the claims in &quot;Other Losses&quot; that &quot;The impossibility of Bacque&#x27;s selective crime thesis—[that the poor treatment was solely carried out by Americans]—becomes all the more evident when one examines the basic decisions affecting occupation policy.&quot;

Regarding the impossibility of a conspiracy on the scale purported by Bacque, Villa states that &quot;[i]n truth, had Eisenhower committed the crimes Bacque alleges, someone surely would have gossiped, ratted, leaked, or even just hinted. None did. Not even Field Marshal Montgomery. Certainly, if there had been a holocaust, it could never have been covered up.&quot; Regarding the overall bureaucracy within which Eisenhower had to operate, Villa stated that &quot;Although the average reader of &quot;Other Losses&quot; would never know it, there was a constellation of authorities to whom Eisenhower had to report his actions. Examining the situation as of May 8, 1945, when his murderous policy is said to have gone into full gear, no responsible historian could ignore the many limitations on Eisenhower&#x27;s authority that made it impossible for him to carry out an independent policy in Germany.&quot;

=== Methodology ===
Cowdrey stated that Bacque&#x27;s methodology for determining just the &quot;Other Losses&quot; figures was also &quot;slipshod&quot;, with Bacque filling gaps in the records where no &quot;other losses&quot; were recorded by &quot;comput[ing] the number of deaths by applying the death rate given in Army statistics for another period to the known number of prisoners at hand.&quot; Cowdrey states that the &quot;rate given in Army statistics&quot; turned out to be a &quot;rate invented by Bacque himself.&quot; Cowdrey states that, with regard to Bacque&#x27;s attempt to analyze a U.S. Army hospital record document, Bacque not only missed an obvious typo throwing his calculations off by 10, but he also badly erred in the math used to tabulate purported death rates of 30%, which he attempts to use to support his claim that the &quot;other losses&quot; column in the weekly army reports reflects a body count. Cowdrey concludes that &quot;the mathematical blunders of &quot;Other Losses&quot; are elementary. One turns from them feeling only embarrassment for the author who naively grounds his thesis upon them.&quot;

Historian Rolf Steininger stated that Bacque&#x27;s claim that the failure to publish the 1960s and 1970s German Maschke Commission finding death figures to be a &quot;cover up&quot; contradicts that the entire 22 volume series was actually published in 1972 without any restrictions, to which only an oblique reference is made in an &quot;Other Losses&quot; endnote. Steininger says that &quot;Bacque himself is one of the mythmakers&quot; and that, when Bacque attacks the Maschke Commission scholars as &quot;client-academics&quot;, &quot;he oversteps the bounds of mythmaking and enters the territory of libel.&quot; Historian Gunter Bischof states that it is simply &quot;outrageous to dismiss this vast and impressive body of scholarship as being designed to produce &#x27;soothing conclusions&#x27; for the German public, as Bacque puts it.&quot;

Bischof said that while &quot;most scholarly reviewers of Bacque&#x27;s book have pointed out that Bacque fails to establish the proper historical context&quot;, &quot;worse, the historical records that Bacque did use are amateurishly misrepresented and often misleading or wrong. Once Bacque&#x27;s endnotes are checked, frequent misreadings of documents are easily discernible.&quot; As an example, Bischof states that Bacque charged that General Mark Clark&#x27;s raising of caloric intake in the Ebensee camp was &quot;trying to exculpate himself before history&quot; of Eisenhower&#x27;s scheme to exterminate Germans. Bischof states that Bacque fails to tell his readers, first, that Ebensee was not even an Allied prisoner of war camp, but a camp for displaced persons that was actually housing Polish Jews liberated from a nearby concentration camp, second, that Clark raised the caloric intake levels in response to a report critical of the treatment of liberated Jews that had just been released and, third, that Eisenhower soon thereafter also raised the levels for his Jewish displaced persons in camps run by Eisenhower.

=== Oral sources ===
Regarding oral histories, Bischof concludes that &quot;Bacque abuses the process through his highly selective presentation of oral histories and memoir literature.&quot; &quot;Other Losses&quot; cited Colonel Phillip S. Lauben as the source for the claim that the &quot;other losses&quot; weekly report column covered up deaths. The New Orleans panel noted that Lauben himself twice has since repudiated this. When describing his interview with Bacque, Lauben stated &quot;I am 91 years old, legally blind, and my memory has lapsed to a point where it is quite unreliable ... Often during my talk with Mr Bacque I reminded him that my memory has deteriorated badly during the 40 odd years since 1945. Mr Bacque read to me the USFET POW figures for discharge and transfers to other national zones. It seemed to me that, after accounting for transfers and discharges, there was nothing left to make up the grand total except deaths and escapes. I.e.: the term OTHER LOSSES. I was mistaken ... many POWs were transferred from one U.S. Command to another U.S. Command. This left one with a loss and the other with a gain.&quot;

Bacque described his other witness, John Foster, as a camp guard &quot;in charge of the work detail of fifty men, Germans and Americans, who did nothing all day but drag bodies out of the camp.&quot; Bischof cites a researcher for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) who tracked down Foster who told the researcher that &quot;he never was a member of a burial detail, he never buried a body in his life. And he&#x27;s unaware of any such activity in any camps.&quot; When the CBC interviewer confronted Bacque with Foster&#x27;s denial, Bacque responded &quot;well, he&#x27;s wrong. He&#x27;s just wrong.&quot;

Bacque also interviewed Martin Brech, a U.S. soldier who was a guard at the Andernach camp. Brech discussed his experiences in detail, in which he witnessed the poor conditions in the camp, a large number of deaths, and the systematic starving of the prisoners. He said, &quot;The silence about this atrocity has pained me for forty-five years and I&#x27;m deeply grateful that James Bacque&#x27;s &#x27;Other Losses&#x27; has, at last, brought the truth to light.&quot;

Bacque states that he has received letters and phone calls from about 2,000 Germans who survived the camps, expressing gratitude that the truth about their experience has finally been published.

=== Context of food shortage ===
Historian James Tent concludes that &quot;James Bacque might be willing to relegate the world food shortage to the category of myth. Few others will do so. Perhaps he can try the interviewing techniques that he employed in &quot;Other Losses&quot;—namely putting words in the mouths of selective eyewitnesses.&quot; The introduction to the New Orleans panel&#x27;s book states that Bacque&#x27;s insistence not only defies common sense, but it would have shocked anyone in Europe in 1945. &quot;Other Losses&quot; states &quot;There was a lot more wheat available in the combined areas of western Germany, France, Britain, Canada and the USA than there had been in the same year in 1939.&quot; Tent states that Bacque selectively cited diary entries and other sources to come to the conclusion of a food abundance and the lack of transportation problems. Tent further stated that Bacque&#x27;s statements that the German population was 4% smaller in 1945 than in 1939 while mentioning only an &quot;influx of refugees from the East&quot;, completely ignored that that &quot;influx&quot; consisted of a staggering 10 to 13 million Germans displaced from the east and south into Germany that had to be fed and housed. The panel introduction also stated that Bacque ignored the overriding reality that German agriculture had suffered extreme productivity decreases in 1944 and 1945, a shortage of synthetic fertilizers had developed after nitrogen and phosphate stocks were channeled into ammunition production, Tent stated that Bacque completely ignored that, because coal reserves had disappeared from the industrial pipeline, fertilizer plants and other food production facilities were inoperable, meaning that German farmers could expect little if any fertilizer over the next one to two years and that fuel was next to non-existent to power run-down farm equipment. In addition, the panel introduction said that Bacque ignored that the destroyed German transportation infrastructure created additional logistical nightmares, with railroad lines, bridges and terminals left in ruins, the turnaround time for railroad wagons was five times higher than the prewar average, and, of the 15,600 German locomotives, 38.6% were no longer operating and 31% were damaged.

The introduction to the panel&#x27;s book also states that Bacque ignored that Eisenhower himself was the one warning his superiors about food shortages as early as February 1945—months before the war had even ended—then again in May when Eisenhower requested food imports from the United States. Tent stated that Bacque also misleadingly cited only part of a June 1945 war report that 630,000 tons of imported wheat would meet the minimum German civilians minimum food requirements, leaving the reader thinking that the food shortage could easily be solved by United States shipments, without informing the reader of an accompanying report that the Allies brought in 600,000 tons of grain, and that it was quickly used up.

While &quot;Other Losses&quot; claims that the United States dismissed the Swiss Government from its role as a protecting power, Villa states that Bacque ignores that it was the Soviets that had vetoed permitting the continued existence of the German government in May 1945, leaving the Swiss no longer wanting to remain the protecting power because they no longer had a German government to which to report, and that the United Nations—including Canada—had concluded the same. Villa adds that, contrary to Bacque&#x27;s implications, there is no evidence that Eisenhower would not have wanted the German government to continue operating under Doenitz&#x27; leadership in Flensburg. Even with regard to the supposed Canadian protest, Villa states &quot;this is another case of Bacque&#x27;s outrageous editing of a document&quot; with Bacque using ellipses to edit out of his quote of the document the key text stating &quot;in the present unique situation there can be no protecting power for a Government which cannot exist.&quot;

Bischof stated that, even in Bacque&#x27;s later released American edition, &quot;Bacque refuses to address the overwhelming evidence that there had been a great shortage of food in central Europe, beyond admitting that there was a food crisis in Germany in 1946&quot; and &quot;but again he turns the evidence on its head when he charges that &#x27;Allied food policy [no longer does he heap the blame on the Americas alone, as in his Canadian edition] deliberately hampered the Germans in attempting to feed themselves.&#x27;&quot; Bischof states &quot;the opposite is true&quot;, citing the large amounts of U.S. Army GARDA Aid, without which &quot;German and Austrian civilians would have had a much tougher time surviving the hunger months of 1945 and 1946.&quot;

=== Context of Eisenhower quotations ===
Bischof and Ambrose stated that &quot;Other Losses&quot; claims of Eisenhower that &quot;he felt ashamed that he bore a German name&quot;, citing Stephen Ambrose and Colonel Ernest Fisher, when what Ambrose actually said to Fischer was &quot;It is rumored that Ike once said, &#x27;I&#x27;m ashamed my name is Eisenhower,&#x27; but I&#x27;ve never seen it, never used it, and don&#x27;t believe it.&quot; They concluded that &quot;[s]uch twisting of historical evidence—both primary and secondary—is not unusual in &quot;Other Losses&quot;. In the end, Bacque usually resorts to conspiracy theories to salvage his outrageous charges.&quot; Regarding another example, Bischof and Ambrose stated that &quot;[o]ne of Bacque&#x27;s strongest quotations is a line from one of Eisenhower&#x27;s letters to his wife, Mamie: &#x27;God I hate the Germans.&#x27; Bacque seems not to understand that the words were appropriate to the subject, that Ike was by no means unique, and that John Eisenhower printed the letter in his book &quot;Letters to Mamie&quot;, where Bacque found it, without embarrassment.&quot; They also stated that, when in 1943, when discussing that he had never been trained for such logistics when he faced a similar problem in Tunisia, Eisenhower stated &quot;we should have killed more of them&quot;, which Bacque took seriously in &quot;Other Losses&quot; (it was also removed in 1969 from a report lest it offend Allies). POWs from Tunisia fared well after being shipped to the United States, where they were well fed in U.S. POW camps.

=== Context of Disarmed Enemy Forces designations ===
With regard to DEF designations, Historian Brian Loring Villa stated that Bacque ignores the 1943 debates of the European Advisory Commission (EAC) and the 1944 EAC&#x27;s instruments of surrender, not picking up until the March 1945. &quot;Other Losses&quot; states that &quot;in March, as Germany was being cracked ... a message was being signed and initialed by Eisenhower proposed a startling departure from the Geneva Convention (GC)—the creation of a new class of prisoners who would not be fed by the Army after the surrender of Germany. The message, dated March 10, reads: ... &quot; &quot;Other Losses&quot; then quotes the cable from the third paragraph, which, Villa states, permits the casual reader to believe that Eisenhower invented the term &quot;disarmed enemy forces&quot;, specifically omitting the other parts of the document referencing the EAC&#x27;s draft surrender terms suggesting a designation to avoid the Geneva Convention categories, or the later use of the term &quot;disarmed enemy forces.&quot; Villa states that, when the actual full correspondence is read, Eisenhower was merely proposing, in March 1945 with thousands of prisoners surrendering, to act on the surrender condition drafts worked out months earlier. Villa concludes that &quot;[a]ll Bacque had to do was look for the EAC draft surrender terms mentioned in the cable—these can readily be found in the standard collection of printed United States Diplomatic documents.&quot;

Villa further states that &quot;Other Losses&quot; wrongly cites a March CCS directive to Eisenhower, claiming that it directs Eisenhower to not take any prisoners after Victory in Europe (V-E) Day, when in fact, the directive states that those taken after V-E day should not be designated as &quot;Prisoners of War&quot; under the Geneva Convention. In fact, JCS 1067 required Eisenhower to continue to take prisoners after V-E Day. Moreover, if Bacque truly believes that Eisenhower was supposed to stop taking prisoners, Villa states that Bacque does not explain how Eisenhower could have gotten away with taking 2 million prisoners after this date without CCS action.

Villa also states that Bacque&#x27;s assertion that the British rejected designations to not comply with the GC requirements are entirely unfounded and ignore that the British themselves requested that they be permitted to use such designations, with that request being granted by the CCS, with German prisoners of war who surrendered to the British being referred to as &quot;Surrendered Enemy Personnel&quot;. Villa states that Bacque also entirely ignores that it was the Soviets that had first raised issues about GC requirements in wartime conferences because they were not GC signatories, and as such, did not want condition surrender terms reflecting GC requirements. Villa stated that Bacque goes further regarding the Soviets, implying that the scale of Soviet gulags were a myth invented to cover up the American crime he asserts. Villa also stated that Bacque claims that Eisenhower initially underestimated the expected POW figures as part of his attempt to starve them, while in actuality, Eisenhower was desperately requesting to have food imports approved. &quot;Other Losses&quot; fails to cite JCS 1067, the primary restriction on food importation, even once in its notes. Villa also states that Bacque misrepresented a June 5, 1945 memorandum in a way that makes the reader believe that Eisenhower could have requisitioned additional food if he had wanted to, while the memorandum itself makes clear that Eisenhower had requested and was denied additional imports. Villa concludes: &quot;Need it be added that anyone going back to the documents to find purported confessions of an extermination policy by one of Eisenhower&#x27;s principal staff officers will find nothing even suggestive of it? Bacque has simply distorted the context beyond all recognition.&quot;

== Historical evidence ==
Several historians rebutting Bacque have argued that the missing POWs simply went home, that Red Cross food aid was sent to displaced civilians and that German POWs were fed the same rations that the U.S. Army was providing to the civilian population. U.S. and German sources estimate the number of German POWs who died in captivity at between 56,000 and 78,000, or about one per cent of all German prisoners, which is roughly the same as the percentage of American POWs who died in German captivity.

The book &quot;Other Losses&quot; alleged 1.5 million prisoners were missing and estimated that up to 500,000 of these were in Soviet camps. When the KGB opened its archives in the 1990s, 356,687 German soldiers and 93,900 civilians previously recorded as missing were found to be listed in the Bulanov report as dying in the Soviet camps.

German POW expert Kurt W. Bohme noted that, of the 5 million prisoners in American hands, the European Theater of Operations provost marshal recorded a total of 15,285 prisoner deaths. In 1974, the German Red Cross reported that about 41,000 German MIAs were last reported in western Germany, which is also the location of the prisoner camps. It is reasonable to assume that some deaths in transit camps just before the end of the war went unreported in the chaos at the time. Historian Albert Cowdrey estimates that the total figure is unlikely to be above the aggregate of the recorded deaths and the MIAs, which together total 56,285. That maximum number would constitute approximately 1.1% of the 5 million total prisoners held by U.S. forces. That figure also is close to Bohme&#x27;s estimate of 1% for deaths of prisoners held by the Western powers.

Many of these occurred in the initial Rheinwiesenlager transit camps. The German Maschke Commission which studied prisoner deaths in the 1960s and 1970s concluded that 557,000 prisoners lived in the Rheinwiesenlager camps. The official death toll for those camps was 3,053. The number registered by local Parish authorities was 5,311. The Maschke Commission noted that the largest claim was that &quot;32,000 fatalities had been heard of&quot;, but the Maschke Commission considered this account to be impossible, as was anything in excess of double the parish authorities&#x27; figure.

While harsh treatment of prisoners occurred, no evidence exists that it was part of an organized systematic effort. Bohme concluded that Eisenhower and the U.S. Army had to improvise for months in taking care of the masses of prisoners to prevent a catastrophe: &quot;In spite of all the misery that occurred behind the barbed wire, the catastrophe was prevented; the anticipated mass deaths did not happen.&quot;

The total death rates for United States-held prisoners is also far lower than those held by most countries throughout the war. In 1941 alone, two million of the 3.3 million German-held Soviet POWs—about 60%—died or were executed by the special SS &quot;Action Groups&quot; (Einsatzgruppen). By 1944, only 1.05 million of 5 million Soviet prisoners in German hands had survived. Of some 2–3 million German POWs in Russian hands, more than 1 million died. Of the 132,000 British and American POWs taken by the Japanese army, 27.6% died in captivity—the Bataan death march being the most notorious incident, producing a POW death rate of between 40 and 60%.

The historian Niall Ferguson claims a significantly lower death rate of 0.15% for German POWs held by Americans, less than every other country except for fellow allied power Britain. Ferguson further claims that another advantage to surrendering to the British rather than the Americans was that the British were also less likely to hand German prisoners over to the Soviet Union. Large numbers of German prisoners were transferred between the Allies. The U.S. gave 765,000 to France, 76,000 to Benelux countries, and 200,000 to the Soviet Union. The U.S. also chose to refuse to accept the surrender of German troops attempting to surrender in Saxony and Bohemia. These soldiers were instead handed over to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, in turn, handed German prisoners over to other Eastern European nations, for example, 70,000 to Poland. According to Ferguson, the death rate of German soldiers held prisoner in the Soviet Union was 35.8%.

Ferguson tabulated the total death rate for POWs in World War II as follows:

=== Lack of records ===
There are no longer any surviving records showing which German POWs and Disarmed Enemy Forces were in U.S. custody prior to roughly September 1945. The early standard operating procedure for handling POWs and Disarmed Enemy Forces was to send a copy of the POW form to the Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects (CROWCASS). However, this practice was apparently stopped as impractical, and all copies of the POW forms, roughly eight million, were destroyed. By way of contrast, the Soviet archives contain dossiers for every German POW they held, averaging around 15 pages for each.

<doc id="65980" wikidata="Q133244" url="?curid=65980" title="Jaundice">
<text>Jaundice, also known as icterus, is a yellowish or greenish pigmentation of the skin and sclera due to high bilirubin levels. Jaundice in adults is typically a sign indicating the presence of underlying diseases involving abnormal heme metabolism, liver dysfunction, or biliary-tract obstruction. The prevalence of jaundice in adults is rare, while jaundice in babies is common, with an estimated 80% affected during their first week of life. The most commonly associated symptoms of jaundice are itchiness, pale feces, and dark urine.
Normal levels of bilirubin in blood are below 1.0 mg/dl (17 μmol/L), while levels over 2–3 mg/dl (34–51 μmol/L) typically result in jaundice. High blood bilirubin is divided into two types: unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin.
Causes of jaundice vary from relatively benign to potentially fatal. High unconjugated bilirubin may be due to excess red blood cell breakdown, large bruises, genetic conditions such as Gilbert&#x27;s syndrome, not eating for a prolonged period of time, newborn jaundice, or thyroid problems. High conjugated bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, or blockage of the bile duct, due to factors including gallstones, cancer, or pancreatitis. Other conditions can also cause yellowish skin, but are not jaundice, including carotenemia, which can develop from eating large amounts of foods containing carotene—or medications such as rifampin.
Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present, surgery is typically required; otherwise, management is medical. Medical management may involve treating infectious causes and stopping medication that could be contributing to the jaundice. Jaundice in newborns may be treated with phototherapy or exchanged transfusion depending on age and prematurity when the bilirubin is greater than 4–21 mg/dl (68–365 μmol/L). The itchiness may be helped by draining the gallbladder, ursodeoxycholic acid, or opioid antagonists such as naltrexone. The word &quot;jaundice&quot; is from the French &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;yellow disease&#x27;.

== Signs and symptoms ==

The most common signs of jaundice in adults are a yellowish discoloration of the white area of the eye (sclera) and skin with scleral icterus presence indicating a serum bilirubin of at least 3 mg/dl. Other common signs include dark urine (bilirubinuria) and pale (acholia) fatty stool (steatorrhea). Because bilirubin is a skin irritant, jaundice is commonly associated with severe itchiness.

Eye conjunctiva has a particularly high affinity for bilirubin deposition due to high elastin content. Slight increases in serum bilirubin can, therefore, be detected early on by observing the yellowing of sclerae. Traditionally referred to as scleral icterus, this term is actually a misnomer, because bilirubin deposition technically occurs in the conjunctival membranes overlying the avascular sclera. Thus, the proper term for the yellowing of &quot;white of the eyes&quot; is conjunctival icterus.

A rare sign of jaundice in childhood is the appearance of yellowish or greenish teeth. In developing children, hyperbilirubinemia can lead to yellow or green tooth discoloration as bilirubin deposits during tooth calcification. While this may occur in children with hyperbilirubinemia, tooth discoloration due to hyperbilirubinemia is not observed in individuals with adult-onset liver disease. Disorders associated with a rise in serum levels of conjugated bilirubin during early development can also cause dental hypoplasia.

== Causes ==

Jaundice is a sign indicating the presence of an underlying diseases involving abnormal bilirubin metabolism, liver dysfunction, or biliary-tract obstruction. In general, jaundice is present when blood levels of bilirubin exceed 3 mg/dl. Jaundice is classified into three categories, depending on which part of the physiological mechanism the pathology affects. The three categories are:

=== Prehepatic causes ===
Prehepatic jaundice is most commonly caused by a pathological increased rate of red blood cell (erythrocyte) hemolysis. The increased breakdown of erythrocytes → increased unconjugated serum bilirubin → increased deposition of unconjugated bilirubin into mucosal tissue. These diseases may cause jaundice due to increased erythrocyte hemolysis:
* Sickle-cell anemia
* Spherocytosis
* Thalassemia
* Pyruvate kinase deficiency
* Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
* Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
* Hemolytic–uremic syndrome
* Severe malaria (in endemic countries)

=== Hepatic causes ===

Hepatic jaundice is caused by abnormal liver metabolism of bilirubin. The major causes of hepatic jaundice are significant damage to hepatocytes due to infectious, drug/medication-induced, autoimmune etiology, or less commonly, due to inheritable genetic diseases. The following is a partial list of hepatic causes to jaundice:
* Acute hepatitis
* Chronic hepatitis
* Hepatotoxicity
* Cirrhosis
* Drug-induced hepatitis
* Alcoholic liver disease
* Gilbert&#x27;s syndrome (found in about 5% of the population, results in induced mild jaundice)
* Crigler–Najjar syndrome, type I
* Crigler–Najjar syndrome, type II
* Leptospirosis

===Posthepatic causes (Obstructive jaundice)===
Posthepatic jaundice (obstructive jaundice) is caused by a blockage of bile ducts that transport bile containing conjugated bilirubin out of the liver for excretion. This is a list of conditions that can cause posthepatic jaundice:
* Choledocholithiasis (common bile duct gallstones). It is the most common cause of obstructive jaundice.
* Pancreatic cancer of the pancreatic head
* Biliary tract strictures
* Biliary atresia
* Primary biliary cholangitis
* Cholestasis of pregnancy
* Acute Pancreatitis
* Chronic Pancreatitis
* Pancreatic pseudocysts
* Mirizzi&#x27;s syndrome
* Parasites (&quot;liver flukes&quot; of the Opisthorchiidae and Fasciolidae)

== Pathophysiology ==
Jaundice is typically caused by an underlying pathological process that occurs at some point along the normal physiological pathway of heme metabolism. A deeper understanding of the anatomical flow of normal heme metabolism is essential to appreciate the importance of prehepatic, hepatic, and posthepatic categories. Thus, an anatomical approach to heme metabolism precedes a discussion of the pathophysiology of jaundice.

=== Normal heme metabolism ===

==== Prehepatic metabolism ====
When red blood cells complete their lifespan of about 120 days, or if they are damaged, they rupture as they pass through the reticuloendothelial system, and cell contents including hemoglobin are released into circulation. Macrophages phagocytose free hemoglobin and split it into heme and globin. Two reactions then take place with the heme molecule. The first oxidation reaction is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme heme oxygenase and results in biliverdin (green color pigment), iron, and carbon monoxide. The next step is the reduction of biliverdin to a yellow color tetrapyrrole pigment called bilirubin by cytosolic enzyme biliverdin reductase. This bilirubin is &quot;unconjugated&quot;, &quot;free&quot;, or &quot;indirect&quot; bilirubin. Around 4 mg of bilirubin per kg of blood are produced each day. The majority of this bilirubin comes from the breakdown of heme from expired red blood cells in the process just described. Roughly 20% comes from other heme sources, however, including ineffective erythropoiesis, and the breakdown of other heme-containing proteins, such as muscle myoglobin and cytochromes. The unconjugated bilirubin then travels to the liver through the bloodstream. Because this bilirubin is not soluble, it is transported through the blood bound to serum albumin.

==== Hepatic metabolism ====
Once unconjugated bilirubin arrives in the liver, liver enzyme UDP-glucuronyl transferase conjugates bilirubin + glucuronic acid → bilirubin diglucuronide (conjugated bilirubin). Bilirubin that has been conjugated by the liver is water-soluble and excreted into the gallbladder.

==== Posthepatic metabolism ====
Bilirubin enters the intestinal tract via bile. In the intestinal tract, bilirubin is converted into urobilinogen by symbiotic intestinal bacteria. Most urobilinogen is converted into stercobilinogen and further oxidized into stercobilin. Stercobilin is excreted via feces, giving stool its characteristic brown coloration. A small portion of urobilinogen is reabsorbed back into the gastrointestinal cells. Most reabsorbed urobilinogen undergoes hepatobiliary recirculation. A smaller portion of reabsorbed urobilinogen is filtered into the kidneys. In the urine, urobilinogen is converted to urobilin, which gives urine its characteristic yellow color.

=== Abnormalities in heme metabolism and excretion ===
One way to understand jaundice pathophysiology is to organize it into disorders that cause increased bilirubin production (abnormal heme metabolism) or decreased bilirubin excretion (abnormal heme excretion).

==== Prehepatic pathophysiology ====
Prehepatic jaundice results from a pathological increase in bilirubin production: an increased rate of erythrocyte hemolysis causes increased bilirubin production, leading to increased deposition of bilirubin in mucosal tissues and the appearance of a yellow hue.

==== Hepatic pathophysiology ====
Hepatic jaundice (hepatocellular jaundice) is due to significant disruption of liver function, leading to hepatic cell death and necrosis and impaired bilirubin transport across hepatocytes. Bilirubin transport across hepatocytes may be impaired at any point between hepatocellular uptake of unconjugated bilirubin and hepatocellular transport of conjugated bilirubin into the gallbladder. In addition, subsequent cellular edema due to inflammation causes mechanical obstruction of the intrahepatic biliary tract. Most commonly, interferences in all three major steps of bilirubin metabolism—uptake, conjugation, and excretion—usually occur in hepatocellular jaundice. Thus, an abnormal rise in both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin (formerly called cholemia) will be present. Because excretion (the rate-limiting step) is usually impaired to the greatest extent, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia predominates.

The unconjugated bilirubin still enters the liver cells and becomes conjugated in the usual way. This conjugated bilirubin is then returned to the blood, probably by rupture of the congested bile canaliculi and direct emptying of the bile into the lymph exiting the liver. Thus, most of the bilirubin in the plasma becomes the conjugated type rather than the unconjugated type, and this conjugated bilirubin, which did not go to the intestine to become urobilinogen, gives the urine a dark color.
==== Posthepatic pathophysiology ====
Posthepatic jaundice, also called obstructive jaundice, is due to the blockage of bile excretion from the biliary tract, which leads to increased conjugated bilirubin and bile salts there. In complete obstruction of the bile duct, conjugated bilirubin cannot access the intestinal tract, disrupting further bilirubin conversion to urobilinogen and, therefore, no stercobilin or urobilin is produced. In obstructive jaundice, excess conjugated bilirubin is filtered into the urine without urobilinogen. Conjugated bilirubin in urine (bilirubinuria) gives urine an abnormally dark brown color. Thus, the presence of pale stool (stercobilin absent from feces) and dark urine (conjugated bilirubin present in urine) suggests an obstructive cause of jaundice. Because these associated signs are also positive in many hepatic jaundice conditions, they cannot be a reliable clinical feature to distinguish obstructive versus hepatocellular jaundice causes.

== Diagnosis ==
Most people presenting with jaundice have various predictable patterns of liver panel abnormalities, though significant variation does exist. The typical liver panel includes blood levels of enzymes found primarily from the liver, such as the aminotransferases (ALT, AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP); bilirubin (which causes the jaundice); and protein levels, specifically, total protein and albumin. Other primary lab tests for liver function include gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and prothrombin time (PT). No single test can differentiate between various classifications of jaundice. A combination of liver function tests and other physical examination findings is essential to arrive at a diagnosis.

=== Laboratory tests ===
Some bone and heart disorders can lead to an increase in ALP and the aminotransferases, so the first step in differentiating these from liver problems is to compare the levels of GGT, which are only elevated in liver-specific conditions. The second step is distinguishing from biliary (cholestatic) or liver causes of jaundice and altered laboratory results. ALP and GGT levels typically rise with one pattern while aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) rise in a separate pattern. If the ALP (10–45 IU/L) and GGT (18–85 IU/L) levels rise proportionately as high as the AST (12–38 IU/L) and ALT (10–45 IU/L) levels, this indicates a cholestatic problem. If the AST and ALT rise is significantly higher than the ALP and GGT rise, though, this indicates a liver problem. Finally, distinguishing between liver causes of jaundice, comparing levels of AST and ALT can prove useful. AST levels typically are higher than ALT. This remains the case in most liver disorders except for hepatitis (viral or hepatotoxic). Alcoholic liver damage may have fairly normal ALT levels, with AST 10 times higher than ALT. If ALT is higher than AST, however, this is indicative of hepatitis. Levels of ALT and AST are not well correlated to the extent of liver damage, although rapid drops in these levels from very high levels can indicate severe necrosis. Low levels of albumin tend to indicate a chronic condition, while the level is normal in hepatitis and cholestasis.

Laboratory results for liver panels are frequently compared by the magnitude of their differences, not the pure number, as well as by their ratios. The AST:ALT ratio can be a good indicator of whether the disorder is alcoholic liver damage (above 10), some other form of liver damage (above 1), or hepatitis (less than 1). Bilirubin levels greater than 10 times normal could indicate neoplastic or intrahepatic cholestasis. Levels lower than this tend to indicate hepatocellular causes. AST levels greater than 15 times normal tend to indicate acute hepatocellular damage. Less than this tend to indicate obstructive causes. ALP levels greater than 5 times normal tend to indicate obstruction, while levels greater than 10 times normal can indicate drug (toxin) induced cholestatic hepatitis or cytomegalovirus infection. Both of these conditions can also have ALT and AST greater than 20 times normal. GGT levels greater than 10 times normal typically indicate cholestasis. Levels 5–10 times tend to indicate viral hepatitis. Levels less than 5 times normal tend to indicate drug toxicity. Acute hepatitis typically has ALT and AST levels rising 20–30 times normal (above 1000) and may remain significantly elevated for several weeks. Acetaminophen toxicity can result in ALT and AST levels greater than 50 times than normal.

Laboratory findings depend on the cause of jaundice:
* Urine: conjugated bilirubin present, urobilinogen &gt; 2 units but variable (except in children)
* Plasma proteins show characteristic changes.
* Plasma albumin level is low, but plasma globulins are raised due to an increased formation of antibodies.

Unconjugated bilirubin is hydrophobic, so cannot be excreted in urine. Thus, the finding of increased urobilinogen in the urine without the presence of bilirubin in the urine (due to its unconjugated state) suggests hemolytic jaundice as the underlying disease process. Urobilinogen will be greater than 2 units, as hemolytic anemia causes increased heme metabolism; one exception being the case of infants, where the gut flora has not developed). Conversely, conjugated bilirubin is hydrophilic and thus can be detected as present in the urine—bilirubinuria—in contrast to unconjugated bilirubin, which is absent in the urine.

=== Imaging ===
Medical imaging such as ultrasound, CT scan, and HIDA scan are useful for detecting bile-duct blockage.

===Differential diagnosis===
* Yellow discoloration of the skin, especially on the palms and the soles, but not of the sclera or inside the mouth, is often due to carotenemia—a harmless condition.
* Yellow discoloration of the skin can also rarely occur with hypercupremia, whether from Wilson&#x27;s disease or from another metabolic derangement. Similarly, a golden-ish ring at the edges of the irises can occur (Kayser-Fleischer ring).

== Treatment ==
Treatment of jaundice varies depending on the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present, surgery is typically required; otherwise, management is pharmacological.

== Complications ==
Hyperbilirubinemia, more precisely hyperbilirubinemia due to the unconjugated fraction, may cause bilirubin to accumulate in the grey matter of the central nervous system, potentially causing irreversible neurological damage, leading to a condition known as kernicterus. Depending on the level of exposure, the effects range from unnoticeable to severe brain damage and even death. Newborns are especially vulnerable to hyperbilirubinemia-induced neurological damage, so must be carefully monitored for alterations in their serum bilirubin levels.

Individuals with parenchymal liver disease who have impaired hemostasis may develop bleeding problems.

==Epidemiology==
Jaundice in adults is rare. Under the five year DISCOVERY programme in the UK, annual incidence of jaundice was 0.74 per 1000 individuals over age 45, although this rate may be slightly inflated due to the main goal of the programme collecting and analyzing cancer data in the population. Jaundice is commonly associated with severity of disease with an incidence of up to 40% of patients requiring intensive care in ICU experiencing jaundice. The causes of jaundice in the intensive care setting is both due to jaundice as the primary reason for ICU stay or as a morbidity to an underlying disease (i.e. sepsis).

In the developed world, the most common causes of jaundice are blockage of the bile duct or medication-induced. In the developing world, the most common cause of jaundice is infectious such as viral hepatitis, leptospirosis, schistosomiasis, or malaria.

=== Risk factors ===
Risk factors associated with high serum bilirubin levels include male gender, white ethnicities, and active smoking. Mean serum total bilirubin levels in adults were found to be higher in men (0.72 ± 0.004 mg/dl) than women (0.52 ± 0.003 mg/dl). Higher bilirubin levels in adults are found also in non-Hispanic white population (0.63 ± 0.004 mg/dl) and Mexican American population (0.61 ± 0.005 mg/dl) while lower in non-Hispanic black population (0.55 ± 0.005 mg/dl). Bilirubin levels are higher in active smokers.

== Special populations ==

=== Neonatal jaundice ===

==== Symptoms ====
Jaundice in infants presents with yellowed skin and icteral sclerae. Neonatal jaundice spreads in a cephalocaudal pattern, affecting the face and neck before spreading down to the trunk and lower extremities in more severe cases. Other symptoms may include drowsiness, poor feeding, and in severe cases, unconjugated bilirubin can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause permanent neurological damage (kernicterus).

==== Causes ====
The most common cause of jaundice in infants is normal physiologic jaundice. Pathologic causes of neonatal jaundice include:
* Formula jaundice
* Hereditary spherocytosis
* Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
* Pyruvate kinase deficiency
* ABO/Rh blood type autoantibodies
* Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency
* Alagille syndrome (genetic defect resulting in hypoplastic intrahepatic bile ducts)
* Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis
* Pyknocytosis (due to vitamin deficiency)
* Cretinism (congenital hypothyroidism)
* Sepsis or other infectious causes

==== Pathophysiology ====
Transient neonatal jaundice is one of the most common conditions occurring in newborns (children under 28 days of age) with more than 80 per cent experienceing jaundice during their first week of life. Jaundice in infants, as in adults, is characterized by increased bilirubin levels (infants: total serum bilirubin greater than 5 mg/dL).

Normal physiological neonatal jaundice is due to immaturity of liver enzymes involved in bilirubin metabolism, immature gut microbiota, and increased breakdown of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Breast milk jaundice is caused by an increased concentration of β-glucuronidase in breast milk, which increases bilirubin deconjugation and reabsorption of bilirubin, leading to persistence of physiologic jaundice with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Onset of breast milk jaundice is within 2 weeks after birth and lasts for 4–13 weeks.

While most cases of newborn jaundice are not harmful, when bilirubin levels are very high, brain damage—kernicterus—may occur leading to significant disability. Kernicterus is associated with increased unconjugated bilirubin (bilirubin which is not carried by albumin). Newborns are especially vulnerable to this damage, due to increased permeability of the blood–brain barrier occurring with increased unconjugated bilirubin, simultaneous to the breakdown of fetal hemoglobin and the immaturity of gut flora. This condition has been rising in recent years, as babies spend less time in sunlight.

==== Treatment ====
Jaundice in newborns is usually transient and dissipates without medical intervention. In cases when serum bilirubin levels are greater than 4–21 mg/dl (68–360 μmol/L), infant may be treated with phototherapy or exchanged transfusion depending on the infant&#x27;s age and prematurity status. A bili light is often the tool used for early treatment, which consists of exposing the baby to intensive phototherapy, which may be intermittent or continuous. A 2014 systematic review found no evidence indicating whether outcomes were different for hospital-based versus home-based treatment. A 2021 Cochrane systematic review found that sunlight can be used to supplement phototherapy, as long as care is taken to prevent overheating and skin damage. There was not sufficient evidence to conclude that sunlight by itself is an effective treatment. Bilirubin count is also lowered through excretion—bowel movements and urination—so frequent and effective feedings are vital measures to decrease jaundice in infants.

==Etymology==
Jaundice comes from the French , meaning &#x27;yellow&#x27;; meaning &#x27;yellow disease&#x27;. The medical term is &quot;icterus,&quot; from the Greek word . The term &quot;icterus&quot; is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to jaundice specifically of sclera. It is also referenced in the scientific name of the yellow-breasted chat (&quot;Icteria virens&quot;), whose sight was believed to cure jaundice.

<text>Stephen Edward Ambrose (January 10, 1936 – October 13, 2002) was an American historian, academic, and author, most noted for his books on World War II and his biographies of U.S. presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon. He was a longtime professor of history at the University of New Orleans and the author of many bestselling volumes of American popular history.

In 2002, several instances of plagiarism were discovered in his books. In 2010, after his death, Ambrose was found to have fabricated interviews and events in his biographies of Eisenhower.

==Early life and education==
Ambrose was born January 10, 1936, in Lovington, Illinois, to Rosepha Trippe Ambrose and Stephen Hedges Ambrose. His father was a physician who served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Ambrose was raised in Whitewater, Wisconsin, where he graduated from Whitewater High School. His family also owned a farm in Lovington, Illinois, and vacation property in Marinette County, Wisconsin. He attended college at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he was a member of Chi Psi fraternity and played on the University of Wisconsin football team for three years.

Ambrose planned to major in pre-medicine, but changed his major to history after hearing the first lecture in a U.S. history class entitled &quot;Representative Americans&quot; in his sophomore year. The course was taught by William B. Hesseltine, whom Ambrose credits with fundamentally shaping his writing and igniting his interest in history. While at Wisconsin, Ambrose was a member of the Navy and Army ROTC. He graduated with a B.A. in 1957. Ambrose received a master&#x27;s degree in history from Louisiana State University in 1958, studying under T. Harry Williams. Ambrose then went on to earn a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1963, under William B. Hesseltine.

==Career==

===Academic positions===
Ambrose was a history professor from 1960 until his retirement in 1995. From 1971 onward, he was a member of the University of New Orleans faculty, where he was named the Boyd Professor of History in 1989, an honor given only to faculty who attain &quot;national or international distinction for outstanding teaching, research, or other creative achievement&quot;. During the 1969–1970 academic year, he was the Ernest J. King Professor of Maritime History at the Naval War College. While teaching at Kansas State University as the Dwight D. Eisenhower Professor of War and Peace during the 1970–1971 academic year, Ambrose participated in heckling of Richard Nixon during a speech the president gave on the KSU campus. Given pressure from the KSU administration and having job offers elsewhere, upon finishing out the year Ambrose offered to leave and the offer was accepted. His opposition to the Vietnam War stood in contrast to his research on &quot;presidents and the military at a time when such topics were increasingly regarded by his colleagues as old fashioned and conservative.&quot; Ambrose also taught at Louisiana State University (assistant professor of history; 1960–1964) and Johns Hopkins University (associate professor of history; 1964–1969). He held visiting posts at Rutgers University, the University of California, Berkeley, and a number of European schools, including University College Dublin, where he taught as the Mary Ball Washington Professor of American History.

He founded the Eisenhower Center at the University of New Orleans in 1989 with, &quot;The mission of the Eisenhower Center is the study of the causes, conduct, and consequences of American national security policy and the use of force as an instrument of policy in the twentieth century.&quot; He served as its director until 1994. The center&#x27;s first efforts, which Ambrose initiated, involved the collection of oral histories from World War II veterans about their experiences, particularly any participation in D-Day. By the time of publication of Ambrose&#x27;s &quot;D-Day, June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II,&quot; in 1994, the center had collected more than 1,200 oral histories. Ambrose donated $150,000 to the Center in 1998 to foster additional efforts to collect oral histories from World War II veterans.

===Writings===
Ambrose&#x27;s earliest works concerned the American Civil War. He wrote biographies of the generals Emory Upton and Henry Halleck, the first of which was based on his dissertation.

Early in his career, Ambrose was mentored by World War II historian Forrest Pogue. In 1964, Ambrose took a position at Johns Hopkins as the Associate Editor of the &quot;Eisenhower Papers&quot;, a project aimed at organizing, cataloging and publishing Eisenhower&#x27;s principal papers. From this work and discussions with Eisenhower emerged an article critical of Cornelius Ryan&#x27;s &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, which had depicted Eisenhower as politically naîve, when at the end of World War II he allowed Soviet forces to take Berlin, thus shaping the Cold War that followed. Ambrose expanded this into a book, &quot;Eisenhower and Berlin, 1945: The Decision to Halt at the Elbe&quot; (1967). Ambrose was aided in the book&#x27;s writing by comments and notes provided by Eisenhower, who read a draft of the book.

In 1964, Ambrose was commissioned to write the official biography of the former president and five-star general Dwight D. Eisenhower. This resulted in a book on Eisenhower&#x27;s war years, &quot;The Supreme Commander&quot; (1970), and a two-volume full biography (published in 1983 and 1984), which are considered &quot;the standard&quot; on the subject. Regarding the first volume, Gordon Harrison, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, proclaimed, &quot;It is Mr. Ambrose&#x27;s special triumph that he has been able to fight through the memoranda, the directives, plans, reports, and official self-serving pieties of the World War II establishment to uncover the idiosyncratic people at its center.&quot; Ambrose also wrote a three-volume biography of Richard Nixon. Although Ambrose was a strong critic of Nixon, the biography was considered fair and just regarding Nixon&#x27;s presidency.

A visit to a reunion of Easy Company veterans in 1988 prompted Ambrose to collect their stories, turning them into &quot;Band of Brothers, E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne: From Normandy to Hitler&#x27;s Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1992). &quot;D-Day&quot; (1994), built upon additional oral histories, presented the battle from the view points of individual soldiers and became his first best seller. A reviewer for the &quot;Journal of Military History&quot; commended &quot;D-Day&quot; as the &quot;most comprehensive discussion&quot; of the sea, air, and land operations that coalesced on that day. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, proclaimed that &quot;Reading this history, you can understand why for so many of its participants, despite all the death surrounding them, life revealed itself in that moment at that place.&quot; Ambrose&#x27;s &quot;Citizen Soldiers&quot;, which describes battles fought in northwest Europe from D-Day through the end of the war in Europe, utilized, again, extensive oral histories. &quot;Citizen Soldiers&quot; became a best seller, appearing on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best sellers lists for both hardcover and paperback editions in the same week. During the same week, in September 1998, &quot;D-Day&quot; and &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot;, Ambrose&#x27;s 1996 book on Meriwether Lewis and the Corps of Discovery, appeared on the best seller list, also. He also wrote &quot;The Victors&quot; (1998), a distillation of material from other books detailing Eisenhower&#x27;s wartime experiences and connections to the common soldier, and &quot;The Wild Blue&quot;, that looks at World War II aviation largely through the experiences of George McGovern, who commanded a B-24 crew that flew numerous missions over Germany. His other major works include &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; about the Lewis and Clark Expedition and &quot;Nothing Like It in the World&quot; about the construction of the Pacific Railroad. His final book, &quot;This Vast Land&quot;, a historical novel about the Lewis &amp; Clark expedition written for young readers, was published posthumously in 2003.

Ambrose&#x27;s most popular single work was &quot;Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West&quot; (1996), which stayed on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller list for a combined, hardcover and paperback, 126 weeks. Ambrose consolidated research on the Corps of Discovery&#x27;s expedition conducted in the previous thirty years and &quot;synthesized it skillfully to enrich our understanding and appreciation of this grand epic&quot;, according to Alvin M. Josephy, Jr., who reviewed the book for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Ken Burns, who produced and directed a PBS documentary on Lewis &amp; Clark declared that Ambrose &quot;takes one of the great, but also one of the most superficially considered, stories in American history and breathes fresh life into it.&quot;

In addition to 27 self-authored books, Ambrose co-authored, edited, and contributed to many more and was a frequent contributor to magazines such as &quot;American Heritage&quot;. He, also, reviewed the works of other historians in the &quot;Journal of Southern History&quot;, &quot;Military Affairs&quot;, &quot;American Historical Review&quot;, &quot;The Journal of American History&quot;, and &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;. He served as a contributing editor to &quot;&quot;, also.

===Television, film, and other activities===
Ambrose featured in the 1973-74 ITV television series, &quot;The World at War&quot;, which detailed the history of World War II.

He served as the historical consultant for the movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. Tom Hanks, who starred in the movie, said he &quot;pored over &quot;D-Day&quot;&quot; and &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; in researching his role. Hanks also credited Ambrose&#x27;s books with providing extensive detail, particularly regarding D-Day landings.

The HBO mini-series, &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; (2001), for which he was an executive producer, helped sustain the fresh interest in World War II that had been stimulated by the 50th anniversary of D-Day in 1994 and the 60th anniversary in 2004. Ambrose served as executive producer for &quot;Price for Peace&quot;, a documentary concerning the war in the Pacific theater during World War II, and for &quot;Moments of Truth&quot;, a TV documentary containing interviews with World War II veterans.

In addition, Ambrose served as a commentator for &quot;Lewis &amp; Clark: The Journey of the Corps of Discovery&quot;, a documentary by Ken Burns. He provided commentary in 20 made-for-TV documentaries, covering diverse topics, such as World War II, Lewis &amp; Clark, and America&#x27;s prominence in the 20th century. He also appeared as a guest on numerous TV programs or stations, including &quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot;, C-Span programming, CNN programming, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot;, CNBC&#x27;s &quot;Hardball&quot;, and various programming on The History Channel and the National Geographic Channel. Ambrose&#x27;s association with National Geographic stemmed, in part, from his designation as an Explorer-in-Residence by the Society.

In addition to his academic work and publishing, Ambrose operated a historical tour business, acting as a tour guide to European locales of World War II. Also, he served on the board of directors for American Rivers and was a member of the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Council.

===National World War II Museum===
Ambrose&#x27;s work for the Eisenhower Center, specifically his work with D-Day veterans, inspired him to co-found the National D-Day Museum in New Orleans with another historian and UNO professor Gordon H. &quot;Nick&quot; Mueller. Ambrose initiated fundraising by donating $500,000. &quot;He dreamt of a museum that reflected his deep regard for our nation&#x27;s citizen soldiers, the workers on the Home Front and the sacrifices and hardships they endured to achieve victory.&quot; He secured large contributions from the federal government, state of Louisiana, Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, and many smaller donations from former students, who answered a plea made by Ambrose in the &quot;New Orleans Times-Picayune&quot;. In 2003, Congress designated the museum as &quot;America&#x27;s National World War II Museum,&quot; acknowledging an expanded scope and mission for the museum. &quot;The Stephen E. Ambrose Memorial Fund continues to support the development of the museum&#x27;s Center for Study of the American Spirit, its educational programs and oral history and publication initiatives.&quot;

===Awards===
In 1997, Ambrose received the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates. In 1998, he received the National Humanities Medal. In 1998, he was awarded the Samuel Eliot Morison Prize for lifetime achievement given by the Society for Military History. In 1998, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2000, Ambrose received the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, the highest honorary award the Department of Defense offers to civilians. In 2001, he was awarded the Theodore Roosevelt Medal for Distinguished Service from the Theodore Roosevelt Association. Ambrose won an Emmy as one of the producers for the mini-series &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;. Ambrose also received the George Marshall Award, the Abraham Lincoln Literary Award, the Bob Hope Award from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, and the Will Rogers Memorial Award.

Upon Ambrose&#x27;s death, U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana offered a resolution in the Senate, which received unanimous consent, saluting the &quot;excellence of Stephen Ambrose at capturing the greatness of the American spirit in words.&quot;

==Personal life, final years, and death==

He married his first wife, Judith Dorlester, in 1957, and they had two children, Stephenie and Barry. Judith died in 1965, when Ambrose was 29. Ambrose married his second wife, Moira Buckley (1939–2009), in 1967 and adopted her three children, Andrew, Grace, and Hugh. Moira was an active assistant in his writing and academic projects. After retiring, he maintained homes in Helena, Montana, and Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. A longtime smoker, he was diagnosed with lung cancer in April 2002. His health deteriorated rapidly, and seven months after the diagnosis, he died at the age of 66. George McGovern, the primary focus of Ambrose&#x27;s &quot;Wild Blue&quot; said, &quot;He probably reached more readers than any other historian in our national history.&quot;

==Legacy==
Ambrose donated $500,000, half the amount needed, to the University of Wisconsin, to endow a chair in the name of William B. Hesseltine, Ambrose&#x27;s mentor. The chair&#x27;s position would focus on the teaching of American military history. When the chair became fully endowed, after Ambrose&#x27;s death, it was renamed the Ambrose-Hesseltine Chair.

The Ambrose Professor of History title was established at the University of New Orleans after his death. The position is reserved for a military historian.

Each year the Rutgers University Living History Society awards the Stephen E. Ambrose Oral History Award to &quot;an author or artist who has made significant use of oral history.&quot; Past winners include Tom Brokaw, Steven Spielberg, Studs Terkel, Michael Beschloss, and Ken Burns.

==Criticism==

===Plagiarism===
In 2002, Ambrose was accused of plagiarizing several passages in his book &quot;The Wild Blue&quot;. Fred Barnes reported in &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; that Ambrose had taken passages from &quot;Wings of Morning: The Story of the Last American Bomber Shot Down over Germany in World War II&quot;, by Thomas Childers, a history professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Ambrose had footnoted sources, but had not enclosed in quotation marks numerous passages from Childers&#x27;s book.

Ambrose asserted that only a few sentences in all his numerous books were the work of other authors. He offered this defense:
A &quot;Forbes&quot; investigation of his work found cases of plagiarism involving passages in at least six books, with a similar pattern going back to his doctoral dissertation. The History News Network lists seven of Ambrose&#x27;s more than 69 works—&quot;The Wild Blue&quot;, &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot;, &quot;Nothing Like It In the World&quot;, &quot;Nixon: Ruin and Recovery&quot;, &quot;Citizen Soldiers&quot;, &quot;The Supreme Commander&quot;, and &quot;Crazy Horse and Custer&quot;—contained content from twelve authors without appropriate attribution from Ambrose.

===Factual errors and disputed characterizations===

====Pacific Railroad====
A front-page article published in &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; on January 1, 2001, entitled &quot;Area Historians Rail Against Inaccuracies in Book&quot;, listed more than sixty instances identified as &quot;significant errors, misstatements, and made-up quotes&quot; in &quot;Nothing Like It in the World: The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad, 1863–1869,&quot; Ambrose&#x27;s non-academic popular history about the construction of the Pacific Railroad between Council Bluffs, Iowa/Omaha, Nebraska, and the San Francisco Bay at Alameda/Oakland via Sacramento, California, which was published in August 2000. The discrepancies were documented in a detailed &quot;fact-checking&quot; paper compiled in December 2000 by three Western US railroad historians who are also experienced researchers, consultants, and collectors specializing in the Pacific Railroad and related topics.

On January 11, 2001, &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Lloyd Grove reported in his column &quot;The Reliable Source&quot; that a co-worker had found a &quot;serious historical error&quot; in the same book that &quot;a chastened Ambrose&quot; promised to correct in future editions. A number of journal reviews also sharply criticized the research and fact checking in the book. Reviewer Walter Nugent observed that it contained &quot;annoying slips&quot; such as mislabeled maps, inaccurate dates, geographical errors, and misidentified word origins, while railroad historian Don L. Hofsommer agreed that the book &quot;confuses facts&quot; and that &quot;The research might best be characterized as &#x27;once over lightly&#x27;.&quot;

====The Eisenhower controversy====
In the introduction to Ambrose&#x27;s biography of Eisenhower, he claims that the former president approached him after having read his previous biography of the American general Henry Halleck,
but Tim Rives, Deputy Director of the Eisenhower Presidential Center, says it was Ambrose who contacted Eisenhower and suggested the project, as shown by a letter from Ambrose found in the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum. In his response, Eisenhower stated that &quot;the confidence I have derived from your work by reading your two books—especially the one on Halleck—give reasons why I should be ready to help out so far as I can.&quot; The Halleck biography &quot;still sits on a shelf&quot; at the Eisenhower National Historic Site in Gettysburg.

After Eisenhower&#x27;s death in 1969, Ambrose made repeated claims to have had a unique and extraordinarily close relationship with him over the final five years of the former President&#x27;s life. In an extensive 1998 interview, before a group of high school students, Ambrose stated that he spent &quot;a lot of time with Ike, really a lot, hundreds and hundreds of hours.&quot; Ambrose claimed he interviewed Eisenhower on a wide range of subjects, and that he had been with him &quot;on a daily basis for a couple years&quot; before his death &quot;doing interviews and talking about his life.&quot; The former president&#x27;s diary and telephone records show that the pair met only three times, for a total of less than five hours. Rives has stated that interview dates Ambrose cites in his 1970 book, &quot;The Supreme Commander&quot;, cannot be reconciled with Eisenhower&#x27;s personal schedule, but Rives discovered, upon further investigation, a &quot;hidden&quot; relationship between the two men. Eisenhower enlisted Ambrose in his efforts to preserve his legacy and counteract criticisms of his presidency, particularly those charging that Eisenhower&#x27;s actions at the end of World War II produced the Cold War. Ambrose wrote a review and book supporting the former general, with Eisenhower providing direction and comments during the process. Rives could not square the questionable interview dates cited by Ambrose in later works, but uncovered a relationship with Eisenhower that was &quot;too complicated&quot; to be described by Ambrose&#x27;s critics.

In his 2015 book &quot;The President and the Apprentice: Eisenhower and Nixon, 1952–1961&quot;, Irwin F. Gellman wrote that &quot;while some Eisenhower scholars questioned Ambrose&#x27;s research after [his] book&#x27;s publication, the enormity of his falsifications was not revealed until after his death. Ambrose lied about his relationship with Eisenhower&quot; and that &quot;Ambrose also manufactured events that never took place&quot;. Historian David Greenberg stated in 2015 that Ambrose&#x27;s &quot;wanton acts of plagiarism and the posthumous revelation that he fabricated interviews with Dwight Eisenhower have rendered his work unusable&quot;.

<text>The Alhucemas Islands (, ) is a group of islands and one of the Spanish &quot;plazas de soberanía&quot; just off the Moroccan coast in the Alboran Sea.

==Overview==
Peñón de Alhucemas, together with the islets of Isla de Mar and Isla de Tierra slightly to the west, form the Alhucemas Islands. They are located off the Moroccan town of Al Hoceima, or &quot;Alhucemas&quot; (former Villa Sanjurjo), east of Ceuta and west of Melilla. The aggregate land area of the group of three islands is 4.6 ha or .

*Peñón de Alhucemas (, &quot;Lavender Rock&quot;, ) is a tiny rock island, measuring east-west and up to north-south, with an area 1.5 ha or , and a height of . The rock is entirely occupied by a fort, several houses, and a church. It is one of several &quot;peñones&quot;, or rock-fortresses, off the coast of Northern Africa.
*Isla de Tierra () is a steep, high rocky platform, north of the Moroccan beach, long northeast–southwest, and up to wide, yielding an area of 1.7 ha or .
*Isla de Mar () is a flat, high islet, with its western end north of Isla de Tierra, long east–west, up to wide, yielding an area of 1.4 ha or .

Spanish rule dates back to 1559, when the Saadis ceded several territories to Spain in exchange for Spanish help against Ottoman armies. In 1673, Spain sent a garrison to the island of Peñón de Alhucemas, and has permanently occupied it since then. The islands are also located near the landing place the Spanish and French expeditionary forces used in 1925 during the Rif War. Morocco has contested Spanish sovereignty over the islets since Morocco received its independence in 1956.

In 2012 the Spanish military garrison in the fort on Peñón de Alhucemas comprised an infantry section of 25–30 men from the 32nd Mixed Artillery Regiment, plus personnel from the marine services with an inflatable boat for reaching supply vessels.

On 29 August 2012, 19 sub-Saharan immigrants traversed the short expanse of water between Morocco and the Isla de Tierra. These individuals camped on the island, hoping to somehow gain access to the Spanish mainland. They were shortly joined by an additional 68 immigrants on 2 September 2012. Refugees and illegal immigration from sub-Saharan nations have been a problem that Spain, and the European Union as a whole, has been trying to solve. Since the islets had an &quot;undefined internal status&quot;, the immigrants did not benefit from the Spanish immigration laws and, under a joint operation, Spanish troops tended to the women, children, and medical needs of the immigrants, then turned them back over to Morocco. Moroccan forces promptly deported the individuals across the Algerian border. The Spanish Army has since stationed a small camp on the Isla de Tierra to discourage new attempts to illegally cross into Spanish territory. The handling and deportation of these individuals have been criticized by the Ombudsman of the Spanish Parliament, the Defensor del Pueblo, and by various NGOs and organizations.

<text>The University of Fort Hare () is a public university in Alice, Eastern Cape, South Africa.

It was a key institution of higher education for Africans from 1916 to 1959 when it offered a Western-style academic education to students from across sub-Saharan Africa, creating an African elite. Fort Hare alumni were part of many subsequent independence movements and governments of newly independent African countries.

In 1959, the university was subsumed by the apartheid system, but it is now part of South Africa&#x27;s post-apartheid public higher education system. It is the alma mater of well-known people including Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, Robert Sobukwe, Oliver Tambo, and others.

==History==

Originally, Fort Hare was a British fort in the wars between British settlers and the Xhosa of the 19th century. Some of the ruins of the fort are still visible today, as well as graves of some of the British soldiers who died while on duty there.

During the 1830s, the Lovedale Missionary Institute was built near Fort Hare. James Stewart, one of its missionary principals, suggested in 1878 that an institution for higher education of black students needed to be created. However, he did not live to see his idea put into operation when, in 1916, Fort Hare was established with Alexander Kerr as its first principal. D. D. T. Jabavu was its first black staff member who lectured in Latin and African languages. In accord with its Christian principles, fees were low and heavily subsidised. Several scholarships were also available for indigent students.

Fort Hare had many associations over the years before it became a university in its own right. It was initially called the South African Native College or Fort Hare Native College and attached to the University of South Africa. It then became the University College of Fort Hare and associated with Rhodes University. With the introduction of apartheid, higher educational institutions in South Africa were strictly segregated along racial lines; blacks had previously gone to classes with Indians, coloureds and a few white students. From 1953 the school became part of the Bantu education system, and with the passage of the Promotion of Bantu Self Government Act in 1959, it was nationalized and segregated along racial and tribal lines, and teaching in African languages rather than English was encouraged. Fort Hare became a black university in its own right in 1970, strictly controlled by the state government.
It was a key institution in higher education for black Africans from 1916 to 1959. It offered a Western-style academic education to students from across sub-Saharan Africa, creating a black African elite. Fort Hare alumni were part of many subsequent independence movements and governments of newly independent African countries. Amongst those who studied at Fort Hare who later became leaders of their countries were Kenneth Kaunda, Seretse Khama, Yusuf Lule, Julius Nyerere, Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo.
Leading opponents of the apartheid regime who attended included Nelson Mandela, Govan Mbeki and Oliver Tambo of the African National Congress, Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Robert Sobukwe of the Pan Africanist Congress, and Desmond Tutu. Mandela, who studied Latin and physics there for almost two years in the 1940s, left the institution as a result of a conflict with a college leader. He later wrote in his autobiography: &quot;For young black South Africans like myself, it was Oxford and Cambridge, Harvard and Yale, all rolled into one.&quot;

After the end of apartheid, Oliver Tambo became chancellor of the university in 1991. In 2005, the University of Fort Hare was awarded the Order of the Baobab in Gold for &quot;Exceptional contribution to Black academic training and leadership development on the African continent.&quot;

==University==
The university&#x27;s main campus is located in Alice near the Tyhume River. It is in the Eastern Cape Province about 50 km west of King William&#x27;s Town, in a region that for a while was known as the &quot;independent&quot; state of Ciskei. In 2011, the Alice campus had some 6400 students. A second campus at the Eastern Cape provincial capital of Bhisho was built in 1990 and hosts a few hundred students, while the campus in East London, acquired through incorporation in 2004, has some 4300 students.

The university has five faculties (Education, Law, Management &amp; Commerce, Science &amp; Agriculture, Social Sciences &amp; Humanities) all of which offer qualifications up to the doctoral level.

=== Strategic plans===
Following a period of decline in the 1990s, Derrick Swarts was appointed vice-chancellor with the task of re-establishing the university on a sound footing. The programme launched by Swarts was the UFH Strategic Plan 2000. The plan was meant to address the university&#x27;s financial situation and academic quality standards simultaneously. The focus of the university was narrowed and consequently five faculties remained:
*Education
*Science and agriculture
*Social sciences and humanities
*Management and commerce
*Law
Further narrowing the focus, 14 institutes were founded to deal with specific issues, such as the UNESCO Oliver Tambo Chair of Human Rights. Through their location the institutes have access to poor rural areas, and consequently emphasis is placed on the role of research in improving quality of life and economic growth (and especially sustainable job creation). Among the outreach programmes, the Telkom Centre of Excellence maintains a &quot;living laboratory&quot; of four schools at Dwesa on the Wild Coast, which have introduced computer labs and internet access to areas that until 2005 did not even have electricity. The projects at Dwesa focus research on Information and Communication for Development (ICD).

Incorporation of Rhodes University&#x27;s former campus in East London in 2004 gave the university an urban base and a coastal base for the first time. Subsequent growth and development on this campus have been rapid. Initial developments of the new multi-campus university were guided by a three-year plan; currently the university is following the new &quot;Strategic Plan 2009-2016&quot;, set to take the institution to its centennial year.

<text>&#x27; (), &#x27; or  (Finnish for &#x27;male grandparent&#x27;, &#x27;grandfather&#x27;, &#x27;old man&#x27;), parallel to Uku in Estonian mythology, is the god of the sky, weather, harvest, and thunder across Finnic paganism.

, the Finnish word for thunder, is the diminutive form of the name .
 believes that , another Finnic sky god, is the origin of , but that as experienced very significant, although far from total, influence from the Indo-European sky god especially in the form of Thor. Some believe that &#x27;s original name was Baltic Perkūnas.

 is considered to be the most significant god of Finnish mythology, although it is disputed by scholars whether this is accountable to later Christian influence. In the folk poems and prayers, he is also given the epithet (&#x27;Supreme God&#x27;), probably in reference to his status as the most highly regarded god and on the other hand his traditional domain in the heavens. Other names for include (, &#x27;long&#x27;), (, &#x27;father&#x27;), (, archaic form of the above, modern meaning &#x27;great&#x27;, &#x27;big&#x27; or &#x27;large&#x27;). Although portrayed active in myth, when appealed to makes all his appearances in legend solely by natural phenomena. According to , the name Ukko was sometimes used as a common noun or generalised epithet for multiple deities instead of denoting a specific god.
==Origins==


It is likely that the figure of is mostly Indo-European, possibly Baltic, in origin. is held by researchers of religion to be parallel to Indo-European patriarchal sky deities, for example to Zeus and Jupiter of the Classical Greco-Roman pantheon, the Indian Hindu god Indra, the Balto-Slavic god Perun-Perkūnas and the Norse god Thor. , a Germanic loan and cognate of Thor, was possibly an alternate name for . is rarely encountered in Finnish mythology, and had been relegated to the mere role of deity of harvest and success.

It is possible that when took the position of the preceding sky god , &#x27;s destiny was to become a mortal smith-hero. Stories tell about vaulting the sky-dome. Whether was an earlier, assumably Uralic sky deity is regardless highly questionable. Some researchers hold and equivalent.

The Sami worshipped a similar deity, called Aijeke, probably as result of cultural cross-contamination or common origin. The god was equated with Horagalles.

==Finnish folklore==

 possessed a weapon, often a hammer called (Ukko&#x27;s hammer), sometimes also an axe () or a sword, by which he struck lightning (see thunderbolt). &#x27;s weapon was largely comparable to the Norse Mjölnir, and Iron Age emblematic pendants depicting hammers and axes similar or identical to Scandinavian specimens have been unearthed in Finland. Like Mjölnir, &#x27;s weapon has been linked by some to the boat-shaped battle axes of the Corded Ware culture.

Thunderbolts were sometimes called (bolt of Ukko) or (arrow of Ukko). It is possible that the Birch bark letter no. 292, written in a Baltic-Finnic language and unearthed in Novgorod, makes use of the metaphor, also referring to as &quot;doom-god&quot; according to one interpretation translated by Yuri Yeliseyev in modern English and interpreted in modern Finnish: &quot;God&#x27;s arrow, ten [is] your name. This arrow is God&#x27;s own. The Doom-God leads.&quot; The name was also used of Neolithic stone tools such as battle axes, which were employed as thunderstones to be buried at the corners of dwellings

Thunderstorms were sometimes interpreted as result of copulating with his wife . He also was believed to cause thunderstorms by driving his chariot through the skies.

Neolithic stone carvings have been found in Russian Karelia which have features of both snakes and lightning. It is, however, uncertain whether these are directly connected to the figure of . Evidence for worship of snakes is found among different cultures around the Baltic, including the Estonians and Finns.

There is evidence that the rowan tree was held sacred to . , a vaguely defined being has been hypothesised to be cognate to Germanic words for the rowan tree through .

The ladybird was also considered sacred to and called (Ukko&#x27;s cow). The Finnish name of the great mullein (&quot;Verbascum thapsus&quot;) is (Ukko&#x27;s fire flower), also linked to worship of .

==Festivals dedicated to Ukko==

Before the advent of Christianity, the Midsummer festival in Finland, today known as after John the Baptist (), was held in honor of and called (Festival of Ukko). This tradition carried to the 19th century.

Also dedicated to were the ( festival) also known as (Ukko&#x27;s ) or simply (s). s were commonly held in May coinciding with the spring sowing. During s it was customary to consume or otherwise offer a container or some other vessel () of an alcoholic beverage or food as sacrifice. It appears that often the festival was held in the community&#x27;s sacred grove or where an animal sacrifice was sometimes also performed as part of the same festival. This ceremony was believed to guarantee good weather for the coming year and thus a good harvest.

It appears that the tradition was rather lively. The last uncontested reports of s being held originate in the 19th century, although sporadic reports also surface in the 20th century. The festival is also mentioned by the Finnish reformer in his account of what from his point of view was Finnish idolatry.

<doc id="66002" wikidata="Q234762" url="?curid=66002" title="Cathy Freeman">
<text>Catherine Astrid Salome Freeman (born 16 February 1973) is an Aboriginal Australian former sprinter, who specialised in the 400 metres event. Her personal best of 48.63 seconds currently ranks her as the ninth-fastest woman of all time, set while finishing second to Marie-José Pérec&#x27;s number-four time at the 1996 Olympics. She became the Olympic champion for the women&#x27;s 400 metres at the 2000 Summer Olympics, at which she had lit the Olympic Flame.

Freeman was the first Indigenous Australian person to become a Commonwealth Games gold medalist at age 16 in 1990. The year 1994 was her breakthrough season. At the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Canada, Freeman won gold in both the 200 m and 400 m. She also won the silver medal at the 1996 Olympics and came first at the 1997 World Championships in the 400 m event. In 1998, Freeman took a break from running due to injury. She returned from injury in form with a first-place finish in the 400 m at the 1999 World Championships. She announced her retirement from athletics in 2003.

In 2007, she founded the Cathy Freeman Foundation, which changed names twice (to Community Spirit Foundation and later to Murrup). She is of the Kuku-yalanji and Birri-gubba peoples.

==Career==
===Prior to 1987===
Cathy Freeman was successful in school athletics events. After 1987, she was coached by her stepfather, Bruce Barber, to various regional and national titles.

===1987–1989===
In 1987, Freeman moved to Kooralbyn International School to be coached professionally by Romanian Mike Danila, who later became a key influence throughout her career; he provided a strict training regime for the young athlete.

In 1988, she was awarded a scholarship to an exclusive girls&#x27; school, Fairholme College in Toowoomba. In a competition in 1989, Freeman ran 11.67 s in the 100 metres and Danila began to think about entering her in the Commonwealth Games Trials in Sydney.

===1990–1995===
In 1990, Freeman was chosen as a member of Australia&#x27;s 4 × 100 m relay team for the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand. The team won the gold medal, making Freeman the first-ever Aboriginal Commonwealth Games gold medallist, as well as one of the youngest, at 16 years old. She moved to Melbourne in 1990 after the Auckland Commonwealth Games. Shortly after moving to Melbourne, her manager Nic Bideau introduced Freeman to athletics coach Peter Fortune, who would become Freeman&#x27;s coach for the rest of her career. She was then selected to represent Australia at the 1990 World Junior Championships in Athletics in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. There, she reached the semi-finals of the 100 m and placed fifth in the final of the 400 m.

Freeman competed in her second World Junior Championships in Seoul, South Korea. She competed only in the 200 m, winning the silver medal behind China&#x27;s Hu Ling. Also in 1992, she travelled to her first Olympic Games in Barcelona, reaching the second round of her new specialty event, the 400 metres, and finishing 7th as part of the Australian team in the women&#x27;s relay finals. At the 1993 World Championships in Athletics Freeman competed in the 200 m, reaching the semi-finals.

1994 was Freeman&#x27;s breakthrough season, when she entered into the world&#x27;s elite for the first time. Competing at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Canada, Freeman won gold in both the 200 m and 400 m. She also competed as a member of Australia&#x27;s 4 × 100 m squad, winning the silver medal and as a member of the 4 × 400 m team, who finished first but were later disqualified after Freeman obstructed the Nigerian runner. During the 1994 season, Freeman took 1.3 seconds from her 400 m personal best, achieving 50.04 seconds. She also set all-time personal bests in the 100 m (11.24) and 200 m (22.25).

Although a medal favourite at the 1995 World Championships in Athletics in Sweden, Freeman finished fourth. She also reached the semi-finals of the 200 m.

===1996–2003===
Freeman made more progress during the 1996 season, setting many personal bests and Australian records. By this stage, she was the biggest challenger to France&#x27;s Marie-José Pérec at the 1996 Olympics. She eventually took the silver medal behind Pérec, in an Australian record of 48.63 seconds. This was the fourth-fastest since the world record was set in Canberra, Australia, in 1985. Pérec&#x27;s winning time of 48.25 was an Olympic record.

In 1997, Freeman won the 400 m at the World Championships in Athens, with a time of 49.77 seconds. Her only loss in the 400 m that season was in Oslo where she injured her foot.This is a mirror site. Please replace with better source.

Freeman took a break for the 1998 season, due to injury. Upon her return to the track in 1999, Freeman did not lose a single 400 m race, including at the World Championships.

Freeman also lit the torch in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.
She continued to win into the 2000 season, despite Pérec&#x27;s return to the track. Freeman was the home favourite for the 400 m title at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, where she was expected to face-off with rival Pérec. This showdown never happened, as Pérec left the Games after what she described as harassment from strangers. Freeman won the Olympic title in a time of 49.11 seconds, becoming only the second Australian Aboriginal Olympic champion (the first was Freeman&#x27;s teammate Nova Peris-Kneebone who won for field hockey four years earlier in Atlanta). After the race, Freeman took a victory lap, carrying both the Aboriginal and Australian flags. This was despite unofficial flags being banned at the Olympic Games, and the Aboriginal flag, while recognised as official in Australia, not being a national flag or recognised by the International Olympic Committee. Freeman also reached the final of the 200 m, coming sixth. In honour of her gold medal win in Sydney, she represented Oceania in carrying the Olympic flag at the opening ceremonies of the next Olympics, in Salt Lake City, joining Archbishop Desmond Tutu (Africa), John Glenn (The Americas), Kazuyoshi Funaki (Asia), Lech Wałęsa (Europe), Jean-Michel Cousteau (Environment), Jean-Claude Killy (Sport), and Steven Spielberg (Culture).

Throughout her career, Freeman regularly competed in the Victorian Athletic League where she won two 400 m races at the Stawell Gift Carnival.
Freeman did not compete during the 2001 season. In 2002 she returned to the track to compete as a member of Australia&#x27;s victorious relay team at the 2002 Commonwealth Games.

Freeman announced her retirement in 2003.

==Post-athletic career==
Since retiring from athletics Freeman has become involved in a range of community and charitable activities. She was an Ambassador of the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation (AIEF) until 2012.

Freeman was appointed as an Ambassador for Cottage by the Sea (a children&#x27;s holiday camp in Queenscliffe, Victoria), alongside celebrity chef Curtis Stone and big-wave surfer Jeff Rowley. Freeman retired from her position as Patron after 10 years in 2014.

===Cathy Freeman Foundation===
In 2007 Freeman founded the Cathy Freeman Foundation. The Foundation works with four remote Indigenous communities to close the gap in education between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian children, by offering incentives for children to attend school. It partners with the AIEF and the Brotherhood of St Laurence.

==Personal life==
Freeman was born in 1973 at Slade Point, Mackay, Queensland, to Norman Freeman and Cecelia Barber. Norman was born in Woorabinda of the Birri Gubba people; Cecelia was born on Palm Island in Queensland, and is of Kuku Yalanji heritage. Moreover, Freeman also has Syrian ancestry. Freeman and her brothers Gavin, Garth, and Norman were raised in Mackay and in other parts of Queensland. She also had an older sister, Anne-Marie, who was born in 1966 and died in 1990. Anne-Marie had cerebral palsy and spent much of her life in the Birribi care facility in Rockhampton.
Freeman attended several schools, including schools in Mackay and Coppabella, but was mostly educated at Fairholme College in Toowoomba where she attended after winning a scholarship to board there.

Freeman&#x27;s parents divorced in 1978, after which her father returned to Woorabinda.

Freeman has described how she has been influenced by early experiences with racism and also by the Baháʼí Faith. She was raised a Catholic, and says of her faith, &quot;I&#x27;m not a devout Catholic but I like the prayers and I appreciate their values about the equality of all human kind.&quot;

Freeman had a long-term romantic relationship with Nick Bideau, her manager, that ended in acrimony and legal wranglings over Freeman&#x27;s endorsement earnings. Freeman married Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Bodecker, a Nike executive 20 years her senior, in 1999. After her success in Sydney she took an extended break from the track to nurse Bodecker through a bout of throat cancer from May to October 2002. She announced their separation in February 2003. Later that year, Freeman began dating Australian actor Joel Edgerton whom she had initially met at the 2002 &quot;TV Week&quot; Logies. Their relationship ended in early 2005.

In October 2006, Freeman announced her engagement to Melbourne stockbroker James Murch. They married at Spray Farm on the Bellarine Peninsula on 11 April 2009. Freeman gave birth to her first child in 2011. In August 2024 Freeman and Murch announced their separation.

Freeman is a supporter of National Rugby League team the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks and Australian Football League team the Carlton Blues. Freeman was also a part of the &quot;Group of 14&quot; who backed the return of the South Sydney Rabbitohs to the NRL following their exclusion in 2000 and 2001.

On 10 October 2023, Freeman was one of 25 Australians of the Year who signed an open letter supporting the Yes vote in the Indigenous Voice referendum, initiated by psychiatrist Patrick McGorry.

==Media==
She joined with actress Deborah Mailman on a road trip, a four-part television documentary series &quot;Going Bush&quot; (2006) where the pair set off on a journey from Broome to Arnhem Land spending time with Indigenous communities along the way.

In 2008, Freeman participated in &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; and discovered that her mother was of Chinese and English heritage as well as Aboriginal. As a result of a 1917 Queensland policy that Aboriginal people could serve in the military if they had a European parent, her paternal great-grandfather, Frank Fisher served in the 11th Light Horse Regiment during World War I.

On her right arm, the side closest to the spectators on an athletics track, she had the words &quot;Cos I&#x27;m free&quot; tattooed midway between her shoulder and elbow.

<doc id="66004" wikidata="Q208164" url="?curid=66004" title="Puppet state">
<text>A puppet state, puppet régime, puppet government or dummy government is a state that is &quot;de jure&quot; independent but &quot;de facto&quot; completely dependent upon an outside power and subject to its orders. Puppet states have nominal sovereignty, except that a foreign power effectively exercises control through economic or military support. By leaving a local government in existence the outside power evades all responsibility, while at the same time successfully paralysing the local government they tolerate.

Puppet states differ from allies, who choose their actions of their own initiative or in accordance with treaties they have voluntarily entered. Puppet states are forced into legally endorsing actions already taken by a foreign power.

==Characteristics==
Puppet states are &quot;endowed with the outward symbols of authority&quot;, such as a name, flag, anthem, constitution, law codes, motto, and government, but in reality, are appendages of another state which creates, sponsors or otherwise controls the puppet government. International law does not recognise occupied puppet states as legitimate.

Puppet states can cease to be puppets through:
* military defeat of the &quot;master&quot; state (as in Europe and Asia in 1945),
* absorption into the master state (as in the early Soviet Union), 
* achievement of independence

==Terminology==
The term is a metaphor which compares a state or government to a puppet controlled by a puppeteer with strings. The first recorded use of the term &quot;puppet government&quot; was in 1884, in reference to the Khedivate of Egypt.

In the Middle Ages, vassal states existed based on delegation of the rule of a country by a king to noble men of lower rank. Since the Peace of Westphalia of 1648, the concept of a nation came into existence where sovereignty was connected more to the people who inhabited the land than to the nobility who owned the land.

An earlier similar concept is suzerainty, the control of the external affairs of one state by another.

==Nineteenth-century examples==
===French revolutionary and Napoleonic clients===

The Batavian Republic was established in the Netherlands under French revolutionary protection.

In Italy, the French First Republic encouraged a proliferation of small republics in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, known as sister republics.

In Eastern Europe, Napoleon&#x27;s First French Empire established the Polish client state of the Duchy of Warsaw.

===British Empire===

In 1896, Britain established a state in Zanzibar.

==Early twentieth-century examples==
=== Established by the German Empire ===
* Kingdom of Poland (1917–1918) – The Central Powers&#x27; forces occupied Russian Congress Poland in 1915 and in 1916, Germany and Austria-Hungary created a Polish monarchy to exploit the occupied territories in an easier way and mobilise the Poles against the Russians (see Polish Legions). In 1918 the state became independent and formed the backbone of the new internationally recognised Second Polish Republic.
* Kingdom of Lithuania (1918) – After Russia&#x27;s defeat and the territorial cessions of the 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Germans established a Lithuanian kingdom. However, it became an independent republic with Germany&#x27;s defeat.
* Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1918) – In 1915, German forces occupied the Russian Courland Governorate and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk ended the war in the east, so the local ethnic Baltic Germans established a duchy under the German crown in that part of &quot;Ober Ost&quot;, with a common return of civil administration in favour of the military. This state was swiftly merged with the Baltic State Duchy and the German-occupied territories of the Russian Empire in Livonia and Estonia, into a multi-ethnic United Baltic Duchy.

=== By others ===
* Provisional National Government of the Southwestern Caucasus and Provisional Government of Western Thrace were provisional republics established by the Turkish minorities of Thrace and Caucasia after the Ottoman Empire lost its lands in these regions. Both were the products of the Ottoman Intelligence agency, Teşkilat-ı Mahsusa, in terms of organisational structure and organisers, and they had remarkably common features.
* Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Republic (1918) – The state, remotely controlled by the Russian Soviet Republic, was founded by Joseph Stalin&#x27;s close friend Fyodor Sergeyev. However, the DKRR was disliked by Vladimir Lenin. The capital of the republic was soon overthrown by the Germans again, and after the Soviet Red Army regained control of the territory, the country was dissolved at Lenin&#x27;s request.
* Republic of Central Lithuania (1920–1922) – Dependent and fully incorporated by the Second Polish Republic in 1922.

==World War II==
===Imperial Japan===

During Japan&#x27;s imperial period, and particularly during the Pacific War (parts of which are considered the Pacific theatre of World War II), the Imperial Japanese government established a number of dependent states.

====Nominally sovereign states====
* &quot;Azad Hind&quot; (1943–1945), officially known as Provisional Government of Free India – established by Indian nationalists in Singapore in October 1943 by Subhas Chandra Bose and was in charge of Indian expatriates and military personnel in Japanese Southeast Asia. It had nominal sovereignty over Axis controlled Indian territories and would enjoy the prospective control of Indian territory to be captured in a future invasion of British India. Of the territory of post-independence India, the government took charge of Kohima (after it fell to the Japanese-INA offensive), parts of Manipur that fell to both the Japanese 15th Army and the INA, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The government had diplomatic relationships with eleven countries including Germany, Italy, Japan, Philippines, and the Soviet Union. It was headed by Subhas Chandra Bose, who was the Head of the State and Prime Minister, who was also the Supreme Commander of the Indian National Army. The government had its own cabinet and banks. 
* State of Burma (1942–1945) – Head of State: Ba Maw
* Second Philippine Republic (1943–1945) – Headed by Jose P. Laurel as President
* Empire of Vietnam (1945) – Emperor Bảo Đại&#x27;s regime with Trần Trọng Kim as Prime Minister after proclaiming independence from France
* Kingdom of Kampuchea (1945) – King Norodom Sihanouk&#x27;s regime with Son Ngoc Thanh as Prime Minister after proclaiming independence from France
* Kingdom of Luang Prabang (1945) – King Sisavang Vong&#x27;s regime with Prince Phetsarath as Prime Minister after proclaiming independence from France

===== In China =====
* Manchukuo (1932–1945) – Set up in Manchuria under the leadership of the last Chinese Emperor, Puyi
* North Shanxi Autonomous Government (1937–1939) – Formed in northern Shanxi with its capital at Datong on October 15, 1937. The state was then merged into Mengjiang along with the South Chahar Autonomous Government and the Mongol United Autonomous Government.
* South Chahar Autonomous Government (1937–1939) – Formed in South Chahar with its capital at Kalgan (modern day Zhangjiakou) on September 4, 1937. The state was merged with the North Shanxi Autonomous Government as well as the Mongol United Autonomous Government to create Mengjiang.
* Mongol Military Government (1936–1937) and Mongol United Autonomous Government (1937–1939) – Established in Inner Mongolia as puppet states with local collaborators. This state formed the large basis of what was to become Mengjiang.
* Mengjiang (1936–1945) – Set up in Inner Mongolia on May 12, 1936, as the Mongol Military Government was renamed in October 1937 as the Mongol United Autonomous Government. On September 1, 1939, the predominantly Han Chinese governments of the South Chahar and North Shanxi Autonomous Governments were merged with the Mongol Autonomous Government, creating the new Mengjiang United Autonomous Government. All of these were headed by De Wang.
* East Hebei Autonomous Council (1935–1938) – A state in northeast China
* Great Way (Dadao) Government (1937–1938) – A short-lived regime based in Shanghai. This provisional government was established as a preliminary collaboration state as the Japanese took control of all of Shanghai and advanced towards Nanjing. This was then merged with the Reformed Government of China as well as the Provisional Government of China into the Reorganised Nationalist Government of the Republic of China under the leadership of Wang Jingwei.
* Reformed Government of the Republic of China (1938–1940) – First regime established in Nanjing after the Battle of Nanjing. Later fused into the Provisional Government of China
* Provisional Government of China (1937–1940) – Incorporated into the Nanjing Nationalist Government on March 30, 1940
* Reorganised Nationalist Government of the Republic of China (1940–1945) – Established in Nanjing under the leadership of Wang Jingwei

===Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy===
Several European governments under the domination of Germany and Italy during World War II have been described as &quot;puppet régimes&quot;. The formal means of control in occupied Europe varied greatly. These states fall into several categories.

====Existing states in alliance with Germany and Italy====
* Hungarian Government of National Unity (1944–1945) – The pro-Nazi regime of Prime Minister Ferenc Szálasi supported by the pro-German, antisemitic fascist Arrow Cross Party was a German puppet regime. Szálasi was installed by the Germans after Adolf Hitler launched Operation Panzerfaust and had the Hungarian Regent, Admiral Miklós Horthy, removed and placed under house arrest. Horthy was forced to abdicate in favor of Szálasi. Szálasi fought on even after Budapest fell and Hungary was completely overrun.

====Existing states under German or Italian rule====
* Albania under Nazi Germany (1943–1944) – The Kingdom of Albania was an Italian protectorate and puppet regime. Italy invaded Albania in 1939 and ended the rule of King Zog I. King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy added King of Albania to his titles and Zog was exiled. King Victor Emmanuel and Shefqet Bej Verlaci, Albanian Prime Minister and Head of State, controlled the Italian protectorate. Verlaci was replaced by Mustafa Merlika Kruja on December 3, 1941. The Germans occupied Albania when Italy exited the war in 1943 and Ibrahim Bej Biçaku, Mehdi Bej Frashëri, and Rexhep Bej Mitrovica became successive Prime Minister under the Nazis.
* Vichy France (1940–1942/4) – The Vichy French regime of Philippe Pétain had limited autonomy from 1940 to 1942, and depended heavily on Germany. The Vichy government controlled many of France&#x27;s colonies and the unoccupied part of France and enjoyed international recognition. In 1942, the Germans occupied the portion of France administered by the Vichy government in Case Anton and installed a new leadership under Pierre Laval, ending much of Vichy France&#x27;s international legitimacy.
* Monaco (1942–1944) – In 1943, the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco, setting up a fascist administration. Shortly thereafter, following Benito Mussolini&#x27;s deposal in Italy, the German Army occupied Monaco and began deporting the Jewish population. Among them was René Blum, founder of Monaco&#x27;s &quot;Ballet de l&#x27;Opera&quot;, who died in a Nazi extermination camp.

====New states formed to reflect national aspirations====
* Slovak Republic under the Slovak People&#x27;s Party (1939–1945) – The Slovak Republic was a German client state. The Slovak People&#x27;s Party was a clerofascist nationalist movement associated with the Roman Catholic Church. Monsignor Jozef Tiso became president in a nominally independent Slovakia.
* Independent State of Croatia (1941–1945) – The Independent State of Croatia (&quot;Nezavisna Država Hrvatska&quot; or NDH) was a German and Italian puppet regime. On paper, the NDH was a kingdom under King Tomislav II (Aimone, Duke of Spoleto) of the House of Savoy, but Tomislav II was only a figurehead in Croatia who never exercised any real power, with Ante Pavelić a somewhat independent leader (&quot;Poglavnik&quot;), though staying obedient to Rome and Berlin.

====States and governments under the control of Germany and Italy====
* Hellenic State (1941–1944) – The Hellenic State administration of Georgios Tsolakoglou, Konstantinos Logothetopoulos, and Ioannis Rallis was a &quot;collaborationist&quot; puppet government during the Axis occupation of Greece. Germany, Italy, and Bulgaria occupied different portions of Greece at different times during these regimes.
* Government of National Salvation (1941–1944) – The government of General Milan Nedić and sometimes known as Nedić&#x27;s Serbia was a German puppet regime operating in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia during the Axis occupation of Serbia.
* Lokot Republic (1941–1943) – The Lokot Republic under Konstantin Voskoboinik and Bronislav Kaminski was a semi-autonomous region in Nazi-occupied Russia under a collaborationist administration. The republic covered the area of several raions of Oryol and Kursk Oblasts. It was directly associated with the Russian Liberation People&#x27;s Army (&quot;Russkaya Osvoboditelnaya Narodnaya Armiya&quot; or RONA), known as the Kaminski Brigade.
* Norwegian National government (1942–1945) – The occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany started with all authority held by German Reich Commissioner (&quot;Reichskommissar&quot;) Josef Terboven, who exercised this through the &quot;Reichskommissariat Norwegen&quot;. The Norwegian pro-German fascist Vidkun Quisling attempted a coup d&#x27;état against the Norwegian government during the German invasion on 9 April 1940, but was not appointed by the Germans to head another native government until 1 February 1942.

====Italian Social Republic====
* Italian Social Republic (1943–1945, known also as the Republic of Salò) – General Pietro Badoglio and King Victor Emmanuel III withdrew Italy from the Axis powers and moved the government to Southern Italy, already controlled by the Allies. In response, the Germans occupied Northern Italy and founded the Italian Social Republic (&quot;Repubblica Sociale Italiana&quot; or RSI) with Benito Mussolini as its &quot;Head of State&quot; and &quot;Minister of Foreign Affairs&quot;. While the RSI government had some trappings of an independent state, it was completely dependent both economically and politically on Germany.

==British examples during and after World War II==

The Axis demand for oil and the concern of the Allies that Germany would look to the oil-rich Middle East for a solution, caused the invasion of Iraq by the United Kingdom and the invasion of Iran by the UK and the Soviet Union. Pro-Axis governments in both Iraq and Iran were removed and replaced with Allied-dominated governments.

* Kingdom of Iraq (1941–1947) – Iraq was important to the United Kingdom because of its position on the route to India. Iraq also could provide strategic oil reserves. But due to the UK&#x27;s weakness early in the war, Iraq backed away from the pre-war Anglo-Iraqi Alliance. On 1 April 1941, the Hashemite monarchy in Iraq was overthrown by a pro-German &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; under Rashid Ali. The Rashid Ali regime began negotiations with the Axis powers and military aid was quickly sent to Mosul via Vichy French-controlled Syria. The Germans provided a squadron of twin-engine fighters and a squadron of medium bombers. The Italians provided a squadron of biplane fighters. In mid-April 1941, a brigade of the 10th Indian Infantry Division landed at Basra (Operation Sabine). On 30 April, British forces at RAF Habbaniya were besieged by a numerically inferior Iraqi force. On 2 May, the British launched pre-emptive airstrikes against the Iraqis and the Anglo-Iraqi War began. By the end of May, the siege of RAF Habbaniya was lifted, Fallujah was taken, Baghdad was surrounded by British forces, and the pro-German government of Rashid Ali collapsed. Rashid Ali and his supporters fled the country. The Hashemite monarchy under King Faisal II was restored, and declared war on the Axis powers in January 1942. British and Commonwealth forces remained in Iraq until 26 October 1947.
* Imperial State of Iran (1941–1943) – German workers in Iran caused both the UK and the Soviet Union to question Iran&#x27;s neutrality. In addition, Iran&#x27;s geographical position was important to the Allies. As a result, the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran (Operation Countenance) was launched in August 1941. The following month, Reza Shah Pahlavi was forced to abdicate his throne and went into exile. He was replaced by his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was willing to declare war on the Axis powers. By January 1942, the UK and the Soviet Union agreed to end their occupation of Iran six months after the end of the war.

==Soviet examples after 1939==
===Puppet states later absorbed into the Soviet Union===

* Tuvan People&#x27;s Republic (1921–1944) – Achieved independence from China by means of local nationalist revolutions only to come under the domination of the Soviet Union in the 1920s. In 1944, Tannu Tuva was absorbed into the USSR.
* Finnish Democratic Republic (1939–1940) – The Finnish Democratic Republic was a short-lived republic in the parts of Finland that were occupied by the Soviet Union during the Winter War. It was also known as the &quot;Terijoki Government&quot;, as Terijoki was the first town captured by the Soviets. The Finnish Democratic Republic was intended to govern Finland after Soviet conquest.
* Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic (1940) – In June 1940, the Republic of Latvia was occupied by the Soviet Union and in July a government proclaimed Soviet power. In August 1940, Latvia was illegally annexed by the USSR.
* Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1940) – In June 1940, the Republic of Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union and in July a government proclaimed Soviet power. In August 1940, Lithuania was illegally annexed by the USSR.
* Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic (1940) – In June 1940, the Republic of Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union and in July a government proclaimed Soviet power. In August 1940, Estonia was illegally annexed by the USSR.

===Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe===
As Soviet forces prevailed over the German Army on the Eastern Front during World War II, the Soviet Union supported the creation of communist governments throughout Eastern Europe. Specifically, the People&#x27;s Republics in Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Albania were dominated by the Soviet Union. While all of these People&#x27;s Republics did not &quot;officially&quot; take power until after WWII ended, they all have roots in pro-communist wartime governments.
* Polish People&#x27;s Republic (1947–1989) – The wartime governments under the Polish Committee of National Liberation, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland, and the Provisional Government of National Unity
* Socialist Republic of Romania (1947–1968) – The wartime National Front (FND) government under Prime Minister Petru Groza. The FND was led by the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). Romania refused to participate in the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia and since then traded and had a warmer relationship with the Western world, resulting in the Soviet Union losing control of Romania as a puppet state. This has been called the de-satellization of Communist Romania.
* Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (1948–1990) – The wartime pro-communist government National Front
* People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria (1946–1990) – The wartime pro-communist Fatherland Front government headed by Kimon Georgiev
* Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic (1949–1989) – The wartime government of Prime Minister Béla Miklós

===Soviet puppet states in Central Asia===
* Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government (1940–1946) – A short-lived state in Iranian Azerbaijan after World War II.
* Republic of Mahabad (1946–1947) – Officially known as the Republic of Kurdistan and established in several provinces of northwestern Iran, or what is known as Iranian Kurdistan and was a short-lived republic that sought Kurdish autonomy within the limits of the Iranian state. Iran retook control in December and the leaders of the state were executed in March 1947 in Mahabad.
* Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (1978–1991)

===Other states under Soviet influence===
Yugoslavia was a communist state closely linked to the Soviet Union, but Yugoslavia retained autonomy within its own borders. After the Tito–Stalin split in 1948, the relationship between the two countries deteriorated significantly. Yugoslavia was expelled from the international organisations of the Eastern Bloc. After Stalin&#x27;s death and a period of de-Stalinization by Nikita Khrushchev, peace was restored, but the relationship between the two countries was never completely mended. Yugoslavia continued to pursue independent policies and became the founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement.

The Soviet Union continued to exert some influence over the People&#x27;s Republic of China before the Sino-Soviet split in 1961. Some other countries which once were Soviet puppet governments included Mongolia, North Korea, North Vietnam, the reunified Vietnam and Cuba, all of which had substantial dependence on the Soviet economy, military, science, and technology. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, most of its former satellites moved towards democratisation. Only China, Cuba, Laos, and Vietnam remain one-party communist states.

In 1992, all references to Marxism–Leninism in the constitution of North Korea were dropped by the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly and replaced with &quot;Juche&quot;. In 2009, the constitution was quietly amended to not only remove all Marxist–Leninist references from the first draft, but also drop all references to communism.

==Examples before and during decolonisation==

In some cases, the process of decolonisation has been managed by the decolonising power to create a neo-colony, that is a nominally independent state whose economy and politics permits continued foreign domination. Neo-colonies are not normally considered puppet states.

===Dutch East Indies===
The Netherlands formed several puppet states in the former Dutch East Indies as part of its effort to quell the Indonesian National Revolution.
* East Indonesia
* East Java
* East Sumatra
* Madura
* Pasundan
* South Sumatra
* Banjar
* Bangka Island
* Biliton
* Central Java
* East Kalimantan
* Great Dayak
* Southeast Borneo Federation
* West Kalimantan

===Congo crisis===

Following the Belgian Congo&#x27;s independence as Congo-Leopoldville in 1960, Belgian interests supported the short-lived breakaway State of Katanga (1960–1963).

=== East Timor ===
Indonesia established a Provisional Government of East Timor following its invasion of East Timor in December 1975.

===South Africa&#x27;s Bantustans===

During the 1970s and 1980s, four ethnic Bantustans - some of which were extremely fragmented - called &quot;homelands&quot; by the government of the time, were carved out of South Africa and given nominal sovereignty. Mostly Xhosa people resided in the Ciskei and Transkei, Tswana people in Bophuthatswana, and Venda people in the Venda.

The principal purpose of these states was to remove South African citizenship from the Xhosa, Tswana, and Venda peoples, and so provide grounds for denying them their democratic rights. All four Bantustans were reincorporated into a democratic South Africa on 27 April 1994, under a new constitution.

The South African authorities established ten Bantustans in South West Africa (present-day Namibia), then illegally occupied by South Africa, in the late 1960s and early 1970s in accordance with the Odendaal Commission. Three of them were granted self-rule. These Bantustans were replaced with separate ethnicity-based governments in 1980.

==Post-Cold War examples==
===Republic of Kuwait===
The Republic of Kuwait was a short-lived pro-Iraqi state in the Persian Gulf that only existed three weeks before it was annexed by Iraq in 1990.

===Republic of Serbian Krajina===
The Republic of Serbian Krajina was a self-proclaimed territory ethnically cleansed by Serbian forces during the Croatian War (1991–95). It was completely dependent on the Serbian regime of Slobodan Milošević, and was not recognised internationally.

==Recent and current examples==
===United States===
* (Interim Government and Coalition Provisional Authority) – Critics of the Iraqi Interim Government argued that it existed only at the pleasure of the United States and other coalition countries and considered it a U.S. puppet government. This criticism was also extended to politicians active within the Interim Government, with the media suggesting that Ayad Allawi, was Washington&#x27;s puppet. The CPA&#x27;s economy was dominated by American influence. The CPA began to dismantle Iraq&#x27;s centrally planned economy. Paul Bremer, chief executive of the CPA, planned to restructure Iraq&#x27;s state owned economy with free market thinking. Bremer dropped the corporate tax rate from around 45% to a flat tax rate of 15% and allowed foreign corporations to repatriate all profits earned in Iraq. Opposition from senior Iraqi officials, together with the poor security situation, meant that Bremer&#x27;s privatisation plan was not implemented during his tenure, though his orders remained in place. CPA Order 39 laid out the framework for full privatisation in Iraq and permitted 100% foreign ownership of Iraqi assets and strengthened the positions of foreign businesses and investors. Critics like Naomi Klein argued that CPA Order 39 was designed to create as favourable an environment for foreign investors as possible, which would allow U.S. corporations to dominate Iraq&#x27;s economy. Also controversial was CPA Order 17 which granted all foreign contractors operating in Iraq immunity from &quot;Iraqi legal process,&quot; effectively granting immunity from any kind of suit, civil or criminal, for actions the contractors engaged in within Iraq. CPA Order 49 also provided significant tax cuts for corporations operating within Iraq by reducing the rate from a maximum of 40% to a maximum of just 15% on income. Furthermore, corporations who collaborated with the CPA were exempted from having to pay any tax.

===Armenia===
* – A former self-declared independent state heavily populated by Armenians, it was internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan. Russian peacekeepers controlled the Lachin corridor that allowed traffic to reach Armenia, on which it was heavily dependent.

===China===
* – The &quot;de facto&quot; independent Wa State in Myanmar is considered a puppet state linked to China.

===Russia===

* is considered a puppet state that is dependent on Russia. The economy of Abkhazia is heavily integrated with Russia and uses the Russian ruble as its currency. About half of Abkhazia&#x27;s state budget is financed with aid money from Russia. Most Abkhazians have Russian passports. Russia maintains a 3,500-strong force in Abkhazia with its headquarters in Gudauta, a former Soviet military base on the Black Sea coast and the borders of Abkhazia are protected by Russian paratroopers. 
* has declared independence but its ability to maintain independence is solely based on Russian troops deployed on its territory. As South Ossetia is landlocked between Russia and Georgia, from which it seceded, it has relied on Russia for economic and logistical support, as all of its exports and imports and air and road traffic is only with Russia. Former President of South Ossetia Eduard Kokoity claimed he would like South Ossetia eventually to become a part of the Russian Federation through reunification with North Ossetia.
* The (DPR) and the (LPR) were self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine following the fallout from the Euromaidan protests and widely considered to be Russian puppet states. Russia annexed the DPR and LPR on September 30, 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
* , a conservative holdover of pro-Soviet forces from the Transnistria War, is considered a puppet state sponsored by Russia.
* forms a Union State with Russia. It has been described as a Russian puppet state or &quot;de facto&quot; Russian since 2022, following the crushing of the 2020–2021 Belarusian protests with Russian assistance and the staging of the Russian invasion of Ukraine from Belarus.

=== Israel ===

* – The Palestinian Authority, an autonomous administration which exercises partial civil control over the Palestinian enclaves in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, was created in 1994 as a result of the Oslo Accords. It is widely viewed by Palestinians as subservient to Israel, and the two have coordinated security.

==Disputed examples==
===In Yemen===
====Iran====
* – The Houthi government is considered by some to be a puppet state which is supported by Iran.

====Saudi Arabia====
* – The Alimi government is sometimes considered a puppet state which is supported by Saudi Arabia.

====United Arab Emirates====
* – The Southern Transitional Council is sometimes considered a puppet state which is supported by the United Arab Emirates.

===Turkey===
* – According to the European Court of Human Rights, the Republic of Cyprus remains the sole legitimate government in Cyprus, and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus should be considered as a puppet state under Turkish control. Its isolation, Turkish military presence, and heavy dependence on Turkish support mean that Turkey has a high level of control over the country&#x27;s decision-making processes. That has led to some experts stating that it runs as an effective puppet state of Turkey. Other experts, however, have pointed out the independent nature of elections and appointments in Northern Cyprus and disputes between the Turkish Cypriot and Turkish governments and concluded that &quot;puppet state&quot; is not an accurate description for Northern Cyprus.
* Syrian Interim Government – Originally founded in 2013, before the Turkish occupation of northern Syria, SIG became more dependent of Turkey in recent years and accused of being a puppet government with their Syrian National Army being described as &quot;Turkish-backed&quot;, as &quot;funded by Turkey&quot; or as &quot;mercenaries&quot;. The SNA was also reported to have being used to support the GNA in the Second Libyan Civil War and to support Azerbaijan in the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War by the Turkish government.

===United States===
* – Many, including the Taliban who now comprise the country&#x27;s current government, considered the former Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to have been a U.S. puppet state.

<text>In philosophy and mathematics, Newcomb&#x27;s paradox, also known as Newcomb&#x27;s problem, is a thought experiment involving a game between two players, one of whom is able to predict the future.

Newcomb&#x27;s paradox was created by William Newcomb of the University of California&#x27;s Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. However, it was first analyzed in a philosophy paper by Robert Nozick in 1969 and appeared in the March 1973 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;, in Martin Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Mathematical Games&quot;. Today it is a much debated problem in the philosophical branch of decision theory.

==The problem==
There is a reliable predictor, another player, and two boxes designated A and B. The player is given a choice between taking only box B or taking both boxes A and B. The player knows the following:
* Box A is transparent and always contains a visible $1,000.
* Box B is opaque, and its content has already been set by the predictor:
** If the predictor has predicted that the player will take both boxes A and B, then box B contains nothing.
** If the predictor has predicted that the player will take only box B, then box B contains $1,000,000.
The player does not know what the predictor predicted or what box B contains while making the choice.

==Game-theory strategies==
In his 1969 article, Nozick noted that &quot;To almost everyone, it is perfectly clear and obvious what should be done. The difficulty is that these people seem to divide almost evenly on the problem, with large numbers thinking that the opposing half is just being silly.&quot; The problem continues to divide philosophers today. In a 2020 survey, a modest plurality of professional philosophers chose to take both boxes (39.0% versus 31.2%).

Game theory offers two strategies for this game that rely on different principles: the expected utility principle and the strategic dominance principle. The problem is considered a paradox because two seemingly logical analyses yield conflicting answers regarding which choice maximizes the player&#x27;s payout.
* Considering the expected utility when the probability of the predictor being right is certain or near-certain, the player should choose box B. This choice statistically maximizes the player&#x27;s winnings, resulting in approximately $1,000,000 per game.
* Under the dominance principle, the player should choose the strategy that is &quot;always&quot; better; choosing both boxes A and B will &quot;always&quot; yield $1,000 more than only choosing B. However, the expected utility of &quot;always $1,000 more than B&quot; depends on the statistical payout of the game; when the predictor&#x27;s prediction is almost certain or certain, choosing both A and B sets player&#x27;s winnings at $1,000 per game.

David Wolpert and Gregory Benford point out that paradoxes arise when not all relevant details of a problem are specified, and there is more than one &quot;intuitively obvious&quot; way to fill in those missing details. They suggest that, in Newcomb&#x27;s paradox, the debate over which strategy is &#x27;obviously correct&#x27; stems from the fact that interpreting the problem details differently can lead to two distinct noncooperative games. Each strategy is optimal for one interpretation of the game but not the other. They then derive the optimal strategies for both of the games, which turn out to be independent of the predictor&#x27;s infallibility, questions of causality, determinism, and free will.

==Causality and free will==

Causality issues arise when the predictor is posited as infallible and incapable of error; Nozick avoids this issue by positing that the predictor&#x27;s predictions are &quot;&quot;almost&quot; certainly&quot; correct, thus sidestepping any issues of infallibility and causality. Nozick also stipulates that if the predictor predicts that the player will choose randomly, then box B will contain nothing. This assumes that inherently random or unpredictable events would not come into play anyway during the process of making the choice, such as free will or quantum mind processes. However, these issues can still be explored in the case of an infallible predictor. Under this condition, it seems that taking only B is the correct option. This analysis argues that we can ignore the possibilities that return $0 and $1,001,000, as they both require that the predictor has made an incorrect prediction, and the problem states that the predictor is never wrong. Thus, the choice becomes whether to take both boxes with $1,000 or to take only box B with $1,000,000 so taking only box B is always better.

William Lane Craig has suggested that, in a world with perfect predictors (or time machines, because a time machine could be used as a mechanism for making a prediction), retrocausality can occur. The chooser&#x27;s choice can be said to have &quot;caused&quot; the predictor&#x27;s prediction. Some have concluded that if time machines or perfect predictors can exist, then there can be no free will and choosers will do whatever they are fated to do. Taken together, the paradox is a restatement of the old contention that free will and determinism are incompatible, since determinism enables the existence of perfect predictors. Put another way, this paradox can be equivalent to the grandfather paradox; the paradox presupposes a perfect predictor, implying the &quot;chooser&quot; is not free to choose, yet simultaneously presumes a choice can be debated and decided. This suggests to some that the paradox is an artifact of these contradictory assumptions.

Gary Drescher argues in his book &quot;Good and Real&quot; that the correct decision is to take only box B, by appealing to a situation he argues is analogous a rational agent in a deterministic universe deciding whether or not to cross a potentially busy street.

Andrew Irvine argues that the problem is structurally isomorphic to Braess&#x27;s paradox, a non-intuitive but ultimately non-paradoxical result concerning equilibrium points in physical systems of various kinds.

Simon Burgess has argued that the problem can be divided into two stages: the stage before the predictor has gained all the information on which the prediction will be based and the stage after it. While the player is still in the first stage, they are presumably able to influence the predictor&#x27;s prediction, for example, by committing to taking only one box. So players who are still in the first stage should simply commit themselves to one-boxing. 

Burgess readily acknowledges that those who are in the second stage should take both boxes. As he emphasises, however, for all practical purposes that is beside the point; the decisions &quot;that determine what happens to the vast bulk of the money on offer all occur in the first [stage]&quot;. So players who find themselves in the second stage without having already committed to one-boxing will invariably end up without the riches and without anyone else to blame. In Burgess&#x27;s words: &quot;you&#x27;ve been a bad boy scout&quot;; &quot;the riches are reserved for those who are prepared&quot;.

Burgess has stressed that &quot;pace&quot; certain critics (e.g., Peter Slezak) he does not recommend that players try to trick the predictor. Nor does he assume that the predictor is unable to predict the player&#x27;s thought process in the second stage. Quite to the contrary, Burgess analyses Newcomb&#x27;s paradox as a common cause problem, and he pays special attention to the importance of adopting a set of unconditional probability values whether implicitly or explicitly that are entirely consistent at all times. To treat the paradox as a common cause problem is simply to assume that the player&#x27;s decision and the predictor&#x27;s prediction have a common cause. (That common cause may be, for example, the player&#x27;s brain state at some particular time before the second stage begins.) 

It is also notable that Burgess highlights a similarity between Newcomb&#x27;s paradox and the Kavka&#x27;s toxin puzzle. In both problems one can have a reason to intend to do something without having a reason to actually do it. Recognition of that similarity, however, is something that Burgess actually credits to Andy Egan.

==Consciousness and simulation==
Newcomb&#x27;s paradox can also be related to the question of machine consciousness, specifically if a perfect simulation of a person&#x27;s brain will generate the consciousness of that person. Suppose we take the predictor to be a machine that arrives at its prediction by simulating the brain of the chooser when confronted with the problem of which box to choose. If that simulation generates the consciousness of the chooser, then the chooser cannot tell whether they are standing in front of the boxes in the real world or in the virtual world generated by the simulation in the past. The &quot;virtual&quot; chooser would thus tell the predictor which choice the &quot;real&quot; chooser is going to make, and the chooser, not knowing whether they are the real chooser or the simulation, should take only the second box.

==Fatalism==
Newcomb&#x27;s paradox is related to logical fatalism in that they both suppose absolute certainty of the future. In logical fatalism, this assumption of certainty creates circular reasoning (&quot;a future event is certain to happen, therefore it is certain to happen&quot;), while Newcomb&#x27;s paradox considers whether the participants of its game are able to affect a predestined outcome.

==Extensions to Newcomb&#x27;s problem==
Many thought experiments similar to or based on Newcomb&#x27;s problem have been discussed in the literature. For example, a quantum-theoretical version of Newcomb&#x27;s problem in which box B is entangled with box A has been proposed.

===The meta-Newcomb problem===
Another related problem is the meta-Newcomb problem. The setup of this problem is similar to the original Newcomb problem. However, the twist here is that the predictor may elect to decide whether to fill box B after the player has made a choice, and the player does not know whether box B has already been filled. There is also another predictor: a &quot;meta-predictor&quot; who has reliably predicted both the players and the predictor in the past, and who predicts the following: &quot;Either you will choose both boxes, and the predictor will make its decision after you, or you will choose only box B, and the predictor will already have made its decision.&quot;

In this situation, a proponent of choosing both boxes is faced with the following dilemma: if the player chooses both boxes, the predictor will not yet have made its decision, and therefore a more rational choice would be for the player to choose box B only. But if the player so chooses, the predictor will already have made its decision, making it impossible for the player&#x27;s decision to affect the predictor&#x27;s decision.

<text>A field gun is a field artillery piece. Originally the term referred to smaller guns that could accompany a field army on the march, that when in combat could be moved about the battlefield in response to changing circumstances (field artillery), as opposed to guns installed in a fort (garrison artillery or coastal artillery), or to siege cannons and mortars which are too large to be moved quickly, and would be used only in a prolonged siege.

Perhaps the most famous use of the field gun in terms of advanced tactics was Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s use of very large wheels on the guns that allowed them to be moved quickly even during a battle. By moving the guns from point to point during a battle, enemy formations could be broken up to be handled by the infantry or cavalry wherever they were massing, dramatically increasing the overall effectiveness of the attack.

==World War I==

As the evolution of artillery continued, almost all guns of any size became capable of being moved at some speed. With few exceptions, even the largest siege weapons had become mobile by road or rail by the start of World War I, and evolution after that point tended to be towards smaller weapons with increased mobility. Even the German super-heavy guns in World War II were rail or caterpillar-track mobile.

In British use, &quot;field guns&quot; or &quot;light guns&quot; were anything up to in calibre, larger calibres were &quot;medium guns&quot;, and the largest calibres were &quot;heavy guns&quot;.

==World War II==
Since about the start of World War II, the term has been applied to long-range artillery pieces that fire at a relatively low angle, as opposed to howitzers which can fire at higher angles. Field guns also lack a specialized purpose, such as anti-tank or coastal artillery. By the later stages of World War II the majority of artillery in use was either in the form of howitzers of to , or in form of hybrid anti-tank/field guns that had high enough muzzle velocity to be used in both roles. The most common field guns of the era were the British , the American 155 mm Long Tom (a development of a French World War I weapon) and the Soviet BS-3 – an artillery piece adapted from a naval gun and designed to double up as an anti-tank weapon.

One of the most produced field guns during the war was the Soviet ZiS-3 with over 103,000 produced. The ZiS-3 could be used in direct fire against armored vehicles, direct fire in infantry support, and indirect fire against distant targets. 

==1960s and 1970s==
The U.S. Army tried the long-range gun again from the early 1960s to the late 1970s with the M107 175 mm gun. The M107 was used extensively in the Vietnam War and proved effective in artillery duels with the North Vietnamese forces. It was considered a high-maintenance item and was removed from service with U.S. forces after a rash of cracked barrels. Production of the M107 continued until 1980 and the gun is still in service with the Israeli military. Reserve stocks are held by other former users such as the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam.

==Modern times==
Since the 1980s and 1990s, the field gun has seen limited combat use. The class of small and highly mobile artillery has been filled with increasing capacity by the man-portable mortar in or / calibre and has replaced every artillery piece smaller than . Gun-howitzers fill the middle ground, with the world rapidly standardizing on either the 155 mm (6.1 in) NATO or Warsaw Pact (former USSR) standards. The need for a long-range weapon is filled by rockets, missiles, and aircraft. Modern gun-artillery such as the L118 105 mm light gun or the M119 105 mm howitzer are used to provide fire support for infantry and armour at ranges where mortars are impractical. Man-packed mortars lack the range or hitting power of gun-artillery. In between is the rifled towed mortar; this weapon (usually in calibre) is light enough to be towed by a truck or SUV, has a range of over and fires a projectile comparable in destructive power to a / artillery shell.

<text>The pascal (symbol: Pa) is the unit of pressure in the International System of Units (SI). It is also used to quantify internal pressure, stress, Young&#x27;s modulus, and ultimate tensile strength. The unit, named after Blaise Pascal, is an SI coherent derived unit defined as one newton per square metre (N/m2). It is also equivalent to 10 barye (10 Ba) in the CGS system. Common multiple units of the pascal are the hectopascal (1 hPa = 100 Pa), which is equal to one millibar, and the kilopascal (1 kPa = 1000 Pa), which is equal to one centibar.

The unit of measurement called &quot;standard atmosphere (atm)&quot; is defined as .
Meteorological observations typically report atmospheric pressure in hectopascals per the recommendation of the World Meteorological Organization, thus a standard atmosphere (atm) or typical sea-level air pressure is about 1013 hPa. Reports in the United States typically use inches of mercury or millibars (hectopascals). In Canada, these reports are given in kilopascals.

== Etymology ==
The unit is named after Blaise Pascal, noted for his contributions to hydrodynamics and hydrostatics, and experiments with a barometer. The name &quot;pascal&quot; was adopted for the SI unit newton per square metre (N/m2) by the 14th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1971.

== Definition ==
The pascal can be expressed using SI derived units, or alternatively solely SI base units, as:
: formula_1
where N is the newton, m is the metre, kg is the kilogram, s is the second, and J is the joule.

One pascal is the pressure exerted by a force of one newton perpendicularly upon an area of one square metre.

== Standard units ==
The unit of measurement called an atmosphere or a standard atmosphere (atm) is . This value is often used as a reference pressure and specified as such in some national and international standards, such as the International Organization for Standardization&#x27;s ISO 2787 (pneumatic tools and compressors), ISO 2533 (aerospace) and ISO 5024 (petroleum). In contrast, International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommends the use of 100 kPa as a standard pressure when reporting the properties of substances.

Unicode has dedicated code-points and in the CJK Compatibility block, but these exist only for backward-compatibility with some older ideographic character-sets and are therefore deprecated.

== Uses ==
The pascal (Pa) or kilopascal (kPa) as a unit of pressure measurement is widely used throughout the world and has largely replaced the pounds per square inch (psi) unit, except in some countries that still use the imperial measurement system or the US customary system, including the United States.

Geophysicists use the gigapascal (GPa) in measuring or calculating tectonic stresses and pressures within the Earth.

Medical elastography measures tissue stiffness non-invasively with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, and often displays the Young&#x27;s modulus or shear modulus of tissue in kilopascals.

In materials science and engineering, the pascal measures the stiffness, tensile strength and compressive strength of materials. In engineering the megapascal (MPa) is the preferred unit for these uses, because the pascal represents a very small quantity.

The pascal is also equivalent to the SI unit of energy density, the joule per cubic metre. This applies not only to the thermodynamics of pressurised gases, but also to the energy density of electric, magnetic, and gravitational fields.

The pascal is used to measure sound pressure. Loudness is the subjective experience of sound pressure and is measured as a sound pressure level (SPL) on a logarithmic scale of the sound pressure relative to some reference pressure. For sound in air, a pressure of 20 μPa is considered to be at the threshold of hearing for humans and is a common reference pressure, so that its SPL is zero.

The airtightness of buildings is measured at 50 Pa.

In medicine, blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg, very close to one Torr). The normal adult blood pressure is less than 120 mmHg systolic BP (SBP) and less than 80 mmHg diastolic BP (DBP). Convert mmHg to SI units as follows: . Hence the normal blood pressure in SI units is less than 16.0 kPa SBP and less than 10.7 kPa DBP. These values are similar to the pressure of water column of average human height; so pressure has to be measured on arm roughly at the level of the heart.

=== Hectopascal and millibar units ===

The units of atmospheric pressure commonly used in meteorology were formerly the bar (100,000 Pa), which is close to the average air pressure on Earth, and the millibar. Since the introduction of SI units, meteorologists generally measure atmospheric pressure in hectopascals (hPa), equal to 100 pascals or 1 millibar. Exceptions include Canada, which uses kilopascals (kPa). In many other fields of science, prefixes that are a power of 1000 are preferred, which theoretically excludes hectopascal from use.

Many countries still use millibars to measure atmospheric pressure. In practically all other fields, the kilopascal is used instead.

<text>Pauline Esther Phillips (born Friedman; July 4, 1918 – January 16, 2013), also known as Abigail Van Buren, was an American advice columnist and radio show host who began the well-known &quot;Dear Abby&quot; newspaper column in 1956. It became the most widely syndicated newspaper column in the world, syndicated in 1,400 newspapers with 110 million readers.

From 1963 to 1975, Phillips also hosted a daily &quot;Dear Abby&quot; program on CBS Radio. TV anchorwoman Diane Sawyer calls her the &quot;pioneering queen of salty advice&quot;. She was also the paternal stepgrandmother of U.S. Congressman Dean Phillips.

==Early life==
Pauline Friedman, nicknamed &quot;Popo&quot;, was born in Sioux City, Iowa, to Russian Jewish immigrants Rebecca (née Rushall) and Abraham B. Friedman, owner of a chain of movie theaters. She was the youngest of four sisters and grew up in Sioux City. Her identical twin Esther Pauline Friedman (married name Lederer) was columnist Ann Landers. Lederer had become Ann Landers in 1955, and Phillips soon followed suit by launching her own advice column.

Phillips graduated from Central High School in Sioux City and Morningside College, where she studied journalism and psychology. She and her twin sister wrote a joint gossip column for the college newspaper. They were married in a double wedding ceremony on July 2, 1939, two days before their 21st birthday. Pauline married Morton Phillips of Minneapolis, and had son Edward and daughter Jeanne.

==Career==
Phillips&#x27; writing career began in January 1956 when she was 37 and new to the San Francisco area. She phoned the editor of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and said that she could write a better advice column than the one that she had been reading in the newspaper. After hearing her modest credentials, editor Stanleigh Arnold gave her some letters in need of answers and told her to bring back her replies in a week; Phillips got her replies back to the &quot;Chronicle&quot; in an hour and a half. In an interview with Larry King, she said that she had no work experience, lacking even a social security number. The editor, however, asked if she was a professional writer. He said that her writing was &quot;fabulous&#x27;, and she was hired that day.

She went by the pen name Abigail Van Buren, combining the Old Testament prophetess from with President Martin Van Buren. Her twin sister was the author of the Ann Landers column, and the competition created acrimony between them for many years. In 1956, Phillips offered her column to the &quot;Sioux City Journal&quot; at a reduced price, provided that the paper refuse to print her sister&#x27;s column. The sisters ostensibly reconciled in 1964 but remained competitors. They became &quot;the most widely read and most quoted women in the world&quot; in 1958, according to &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

===Writing style===
Newspapers had included gossip and personal columnists for more than a century, but the two sisters added &quot;something special&quot;, according to &quot;Life&quot;, in that they were the first to publish letters and replies covering a wide range of personal problems, replying with &quot;vaudeville punch lines&quot; rooted in common sense. The editor of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described their skill as &quot;beyond mere shrewdness—a quality very close to genuine wisdom.&quot;

Phillips stated that she did not publish the most sensitive letters that she received, but instead replied to them individually. Sometimes she would write a brief note on the letter itself, letting one of her secretaries respond fully using her advice. If a person seemed suicidal from their letter, she would call them on the phone.

==Personal life and beliefs==
Phillips was considered &quot;the embodiment of female orthodoxy.&quot; This attitude carried over into her column in the late 1950s, and she considered women &quot;faintly ridiculous&quot; if they were unable to make their marriages work. Her &quot;code of conduct&quot; was &quot;husband and children first.&quot; In her later years, she did not avoid suggesting divorce when a relationship became &quot;intolerable&quot;, and considered how a bad marriage might affect children: &quot;When kids see parents fighting, or even sniping at each other, I think it is terribly damaging.&quot;

Phillips supported gay rights, and season 1, episode 8 of the podcast &quot;Making Gay History&quot; is about her.

Both Phillips and her sister enjoyed socializing with celebrities, and because of their notoriety, celebrities liked being seen with them. Among Phillips&#x27; friends soon after she began her column were politicians, including Senators Hubert Humphrey and Herbert Lehman; and entertainers, including Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin. They also admired Bishop Fulton Sheen, whom they met when learning about Catholicism while studying about other religions. The bishop admired them both in return due to their ability to remain &quot;unawed&quot; and unaffected by the fame of others. Phillips was Jewish, and she commented: &quot;He&#x27;s one of the greatest men I ever met, but he&#x27;ll be a Jew before I&#x27;m a Catholic.&quot;

Phillips was an honorary member of Women in Communications, the American College of Psychiatrists, and the National Council of Jewish Women. Her columns were collected in &quot;Dear Abby&quot;, &quot;Dear Teenager&quot;, &quot;Dear Abby on Marriage&quot;, &quot;Where Were You When President Kennedy was Shot?&quot;, &quot;The Dear Abby Wedding Planner&quot;, and &quot;The Best of Dear Abby&quot;. She said that writing is &quot;only work if you&#x27;d rather be doing something else.&quot; She co-wrote the column with her daughter Jeanne from 1987 until her retirement. In 2002, Phillips&#x27; Alzheimer&#x27;s disease made it impossible for her to continue writing, and Jeanne assumed all the writing responsibilities of &quot;Dear Abby&quot;.

==Death==
Phillips died on January 16, 2013, at age 94, after battling Alzheimer&#x27;s for 11 years. She was survived by her husband of 73 years, Morton Phillips, daughter Jeanne Phillips, four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. Her son, Edward, had died two years prior.

<doc id="66028" wikidata="Q1778799" url="?curid=66028" title="BBC Radiophonic Workshop">
<text>The BBC Radiophonic Workshop was one of the sound effects units of the BBC, created in 1958 to produce incidental sounds and new music for radio and, later, television. The unit is known for its experimental and pioneering work in electronic music and music technology, as well as its popular scores for programmes such as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; during the 1950s and 1960s.

The original Radiophonic Workshop was based in the BBC&#x27;s Maida Vale Studios in Delaware Road, Maida Vale, London. The Workshop was closed in March 1998, although much of its traditional work had already been outsourced by 1995. Its members included Daphne Oram, Delia Derbyshire, David Cain, John Baker, Paddy Kingsland, Glynis Jones, Maddalena Fagandini, Richard Yeoman-Clark and Elizabeth Parker, the last to leave.
==History==
The Workshop was set up to satisfy the growing demand in the late 1950s for &quot;radiophonic&quot; sounds from a group of producers and studio managers at the BBC, including Desmond Briscoe, Daphne Oram, Donald McWhinnie, and Frederick Bradnum. For some time there had been much interest in producing innovative music and sounds to go with the pioneering programming of the era, in particular the dramatic output of the BBC Third Programme. Often the sounds required for the atmosphere that programme makers wished to create were unavailable or non-existent through traditional sources and so some, such as the musically trained Oram, would look to new techniques to produce effects and music for their pieces. Much of this interest drew them to musique concrète and tape manipulation techniques, since using these methods could allow them to create soundscapes suitable for the growing range of unconventional programming. When the BBC noticed the rising popularity of this method they established a Radiophonic Effects Committee, setting up the Workshop in rooms 13 &amp; 14 of the BBC&#x27;s Maida Vale studios with a budget of £2,000. The Workshop contributed articles on their findings to magazines, leading to some of their techniques being borrowed by sixties producers and engineers such as Eddie Kramer.

===Early days===

In 1957, Daphne Oram set up the Radiophonic Workshop with Desmond Briscoe, who was appointed the Senior Studio Manager with Dick Mills employed as a technical assistant. Much of The Radiophonic Workshop&#x27;s early work was in effects for radio, in particular experimental drama and &quot;radiophonic poems&quot;. Their significant early output included creating effects for the popular science-fiction serial &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; and memorable comedy sounds for &quot;The Goon Show&quot;. In 1959, Daphne Oram left the workshop to set up her own studio, the &quot;Oramics Studios for Electronic Composition&quot;, where she eventually developed her &quot;Oramics&quot; technique of electronic sound creation. That year Maddalena Fagandini joined the workshop from the BBC&#x27;s Italian Service.

From the early sixties the Workshop began creating television theme tunes and jingles, particularly for low budget schools programmes. The shift from the experimental nature of the late 50s dramas to theme tunes was noticeable enough for one radio presenter to have to remind listeners that the purpose of the Workshop was not pop music. In fact, in 1962 one of Fagandini&#x27;s interval signals &quot;Time Beat&quot; was reworked with assistance from George Martin (in his pre-Beatles days) and commercially released as a single using the pseudonym Ray Cathode. During this early period the innovative electronic approaches to music in the Workshop began to attract some significant young talent including Delia Derbyshire, Brian Hodgson and John Baker, who was in fact a jazz pianist with an interest in reverse tape effects. Later, in 1967. they were joined by David Cain, a jazz bass player and mathematician.

In these early days, one criticism the Workshop attracted was its policy of not allowing musicians from outside the BBC to use its equipment, which was some of the most advanced in the country at that time not only because of its nature, but also because of the unique combinations and workflows which the Workshop afforded its composers. In later years this would become less important as more electronic equipment became readily available to a wider audience.

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===


In 1963 they were approached by composer Ron Grainer to record a theme tune for the upcoming BBC television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Presented with the task of &quot;realising&quot; Grainer&#x27;s score, complete with its descriptions of &quot;sweeps&quot;, &quot;swoops&quot;, &quot;wind clouds&quot; and &quot;wind bubbles&quot;, Delia Derbyshire created a piece of electronic music which has become one of television&#x27;s most recognisable themes. Over the next quarter-century the Workshop contributed greatly to the programme providing its vast range of unusual sound-effects, from the TARDIS dematerialisation to the Sonic screwdriver, as well as much of the programme&#x27;s distinctive electronic incidental music, including every score from 1980 to 1985.

In 2018 Matthew Herbert, creative director of The New Radiophonic Workshop, composed the sting used alongside the reveal of the new Doctor Who logo debuting later that year.

===Changes===
As the sixties drew to a close, many of the techniques used by the Workshop changed as more electronic music began to be produced by synthesisers. Many of the old members of the Workshop were reluctant to use the new instruments, often because of the limitations and unreliable nature of many of the early synthesisers but also, for some, because of a dislike of the sounds they created. This led to many leaving the workshop making way for a new generation of musicians in the early 1970s including Malcolm Clarke, Paddy Kingsland, Roger Limb and Peter Howell. From the early days of a studio full of tape reels and electronic oscillators, the Workshop now found itself in possession of various synthesisers including the EMS VCS 3 and the EMS Synthi 100 nicknamed the &quot;Delaware&quot; by the members of the Workshop.

In 1977, Workshop co-founder Desmond Briscoe retired from organisational duties with Brian Hodgson, returning after a five-year gap away from the Workshop, taking over.

By this point the output of the Workshop was vast with high demand for complete scores for programmes as well as the themes and sound effects for which it had made its name. By the end of the decade the workshop was contributing to over 300 programmes a year from all departments of the BBC and had long since expanded from its early two-room setup. Its contributions included material for programmes such as &quot;The Body in Question&quot;, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; as well as sound effects for popular science fiction programmes &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; and &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; (in both its radio and television forms) by Richard Yeoman-Clark and Paddy Kingsland respectively.

===Latter days===
By the early 1990s, BBC Director General John Birt decided that departments were to charge each other and bid against each other for services and to close those that couldn&#x27;t make enough revenue to cover their costs. In 1991 the Workshop was given five years in which to break even but the cost of keeping the department, which required two dedicated engineers, a software developer (Tony Morton) and a secretary (Maxine) as well as the composers, proved too much and so they failed. Dick Mills, who had worked on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; since the very beginning, left in 1993, along with Ray White, Senior Engineer, and his assistant, Ray Riley, with the Maida Vale technical team taking on their role, and engineer Fiona Sleigh smoothing the transition.

In 1995, despite being asked to continue, organiser Brian Hodgson left the Workshop, and his role was carried out remotely from Broadcasting House by people with other priorities and little enthusiasm. Malcolm Clarke and Roger Limb left. By the end, only one composer, Elizabeth Parker, remained. The Workshop officially closed in March 1998, but Elizabeth stayed on for a couple of months to complete her last job. John Hunt, (who took over much of the specialist editing side of the workshop previously done by Dick Mills) continued working in Studio E, now called &quot;Radiophonics&quot; until well into 2000, occasionally managing to fit in a bit of traditional Radiophonics work. Mark Ayres recalls the Workshop&#x27;s tape archive being collected on 1 April, exactly 40 years after the department had opened.

===Legacy===
Following the decision to close the Radiophonic Workshop, the studios were cleared and most remaining equipment was disposed of, with some of it being sold to the composers. The tape library was largely forgotten until the room was ordered to be &quot;cleared&quot;. Fortunately the Maida Vale studios technical team became aware of this and were able to hide the tapes away in various dark corners of the building before they could be thrown away. Eventually Mark Ayres and Brian Hodgson were commissioned to catalogue its extensive library of recordings with help from other composers.

In October 2003, &quot;Alchemists of Sound&quot;, an hour-long television documentary about the Radiophonic Workshop, was broadcast on BBC Four.

The Magnetic Fields titled the first track of their album &quot;Holiday&quot;, after the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.

In February 2025, Spitfire Audio released a sample library featuring sounds from the Radiophonic Workshop for public purchase. The library featured audio sourced from the original Workshop archives, as well as newly-recorded performances by the Workshop members. Archivist Mark Ayres noted the team&#x27;s age as a motivating factor for this collaboration, stating, &quot;We’re not going to be around for ever. It was really important to leave a creative tool, inspired by our work, for other people to use going forward.&quot;

===Live reunions since 2009===
In May 2009, Dick Mills reunited with former BBC Radiophonic Workshop composers Roger Limb, Paddy Kingsland and Peter Howell with archivist Mark Ayres for a live concert at The Roundhouse, Chalk Farm, London, performing as &quot;The Radiophonic Workshop&quot;. The composers, backed by a small brass section and a live drummer, performed a large number of their BBC-commissioned musical works including sections of incidental music from &quot;The Hitchhikers&#x27; Guide to the Galaxy&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (including a medley of Mark Ayres&#x27;s work) as well as some collaborative compositions written specifically for the Roundhouse concert.

The live performances were mixed in surround sound and interspersed with musical video montage tributes of deceased members of the Workshop including Daphne Oram, Delia Derbyshire and John Baker. The two and a half-hour event climaxed with live performances of the Derbyshire and Peter Howell arrangements of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, segueing into a new Radiophonic version of the theme tune. Celebrated attendees included actor/writer/composer Peter Serafinowicz and satirist/writer/broadcaster Victor Lewis-Smith. Multiple cameras recorded the event but it has yet to be broadcast or released in any form, although amateur footage of the event can be seen on YouTube.

In 2013 the original members of the Workshop regrouped again for a more concerted programme of live appearances. Performing as &#x27;The Radiophonic Workshop&#x27; (dropping the BBC prefix) they were joined by drummer Kieron Pepper (The Prodigy, Dead Kids, OutPatient) and Bob Earland from Clor. They also embarked on a new recording project set for release in Autumn of 2014. This involved collaborations with contemporary electronic musicians, video artists, DJs, remixers, poets, writers and singers. Live appearances in 2013 included Festival Number 6 at Portmeirion, Wales in September and The London Electronic Arts Festival in November. The shows featured archive TV and visuals from many of the TV and film soundtracks that the Radiophonic Workshop contributed to between 1958 and 1998 when the unit was deactivated. The Radiophonic Workshop appeared on BBC television&#x27;s The One Show on 20 November 2013 playing a unique version of the Doctor Who Theme that combined Delia Derbyshire&#x27;s original source tapes and Peter Howell&#x27;s 1980 realisation of the Ron Grainer composition. Radio 6 Music&#x27;s Marc Riley played host to a Radiophonic Workshop session where they delivered live versions of Roger Limb&#x27;s Incubus, Paddy Kingsland&#x27;s Vespucci, the Doctor Who Medley and a new composition – Electricity Language and Me (by American poet Peter Adam Salomon), featuring DJ Andrew Weatherall as the narrative voice for this classic piece of Radiophonic sound design. There were a number of radio, online and print interviews done at the time to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who.

The Workshop&#x27;s early archive recordings were also reissued on vinyl in November 2013 to accompany this renewed activity. In 2014, &quot;The Radiophonic Workshop&quot; appeared at festivals including End of the Road Festival, and the reissue programme of earlier work from their extensive catalogue continues along with a planned exploration of previously unheard or rare archive recordings.

=== 2012 online revival ===
In September 2012 Arts Council England and the BBC announced a joint venture whereby the concept of the Radiophonic Workshop would be revived as an online venture, with seven new, non-original composers and musicians. The new Workshop was based online at The Space, a joint venture between the BBC and Arts Council England. Composer Matthew Herbert was appointed the new Creative Director, and worked alongside Micachu, Yann Seznec, Max de Wardener, Patrick Bergel, James Mather, theatre director Lyndsey Turner and broadcast technologist Tony Churnside.

Composer Matthew Herbert&#x27;s first work for The New Radiophonic Workshop takes audio from 25 previous projects featured on the website – from theater performances to poetry readings, creating a &quot;curious murmur of activity&quot;. It can be heard by clicking on a button labeled &quot;listen to The Space&quot; at the top of any page on the website.

The New Radiophonic Workshop, not to be confused with the reactivated Radiophonic Workshop whose members are original BBC personnel, an entirely separate entity from the original unit, was assembled by Mathew Herbert as an online collective of composers for The Space arts project.

==Techniques==
The techniques initially used by the Radiophonic Workshop were closely related to those used in &quot;musique concrète&quot;; new sounds for programmes were created by using recordings of everyday sounds such as voices, bells or gravel as raw material for &quot;radiophonic&quot; manipulations. In these manipulations, audio tape could be played back at different speeds (altering a sound&#x27;s pitch), reversed, cut and joined, or processed using reverb or equalisation. The most famous of the Workshop&#x27;s creations using &#x27;radiophonic&#x27; techniques include the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme music, which Delia Derbyshire created using a plucked string, 12 oscillators and a lot of tape manipulation; and the sound of the TARDIS (the Doctor&#x27;s time machine) materialising and dematerialising, which was created by Brian Hodgson running his keys along the rusty bass strings of a broken piano, with the recording slowed down to make an even lower sound.

Much of the equipment used by the Workshop in the earlier years of its operation in the late 1950s was semi-professional and was passed down from other departments, though two giant professional tape-recorders made an early centrepiece. Reverberation was obtained using an echo chamber, a basement room with bare painted walls empty except for loudspeakers and microphones. Due to the considerable technical challenges faced by the Workshop and BBC traditions, staff initially worked in pairs with one person assigned to the technical aspects of the work and the other to the artistic direction.

== Influence on popular music ==
The Radiophonic Workshop published &quot;Radiophonics in the BBC&quot; in November 1963, listing all equipment used in their two workshops, diagrams of several systems, and a number of anecdotes. The Radiophonic Workshop also contributed articles to magazines of its experiments, complete with instructions and wiring diagrams.

British psychedelic rock group Pink Floyd made a memorable trip to the workshop in 1967. They had employed tape loops, sound effects, found sounds and the principles of musique concrete on their debut album &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; from that same year. Other fans of the Radiophonic Workshop included The Rolling Stones&#x27; Brian Jones – who visited in 1968 – and Roger Mayer, who supplied guitar pedals to Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix. Phil Manzanera has also cited the Workshop as an influence on the sound of his group Roxy Music.

In 1997 the electronic dance music magazine &quot;Mixmag&quot; described the Workshop as, &quot;the unsung heroes of British electronica&quot;. Their work has been sampled extensively by contemporary electronic artists.

He was cast as Professor Alan Cornwall in the revival of the American sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot; (2023–present).

Lyndhurst had major roles in other sitcoms, including as Raymond Fletcher in &quot;Going Straight&quot; (1978), as Adam Parkinson in &quot;Butterflies&quot; (1978–1983), as Ashley Phillips in &quot;The Two of Us&quot; (1986–1990), as Peter &quot;Piglet&quot; Chapman in &quot;The Piglet Files&quot; (1990–1992), as Gary Sparrow in &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot; (1993–1999, 2016), and as Jimmy Venables in &quot;After You&#x27;ve Gone&quot; (2007–2008).

Lyndhurst won two National Television Awards for his role in &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot;, as well as being nominated for a British Comedy Award and three British Academy Television Awards for his role in &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;.

== Early life ==
Nicholas Simon Lyndhurst was born in Gosport, Hampshire, England on 20 April 1961, as the only child to Anthony Arthur Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Lyndhurst (1924–2000) and Elizabeth M &quot;Liz&quot; (née Long; 1934–2009). He grew up in Emsworth. His parents met at the holiday camp on the farm owned by his paternal grandfather, Francis Lyndhurst (1878–1952), a theatrical scenery painter, film producer and film director, who set up an early film studio at Shoreham Fort, Shoreham-by-Sea. His grandfather died three years prior to his grandson&#x27;s birth. His parents separated when he was young, reuniting and separating permanently later on. His father, Joe, had had an affair and started a family with another woman, Yvonne Beryl Elsmore (1924–2008), by the time his son was eight, leaving his son and the mother of his child &quot;poverty-stricken&quot;.

Lyndhurst attended East Wittering Primary School. He then attended the Corona Theatre School in Hammersmith, London, where his friends included Lisa Vanderpump.

== Career ==
Lyndhurst made his debut as an actor with the uncredited role of Shot Cabin Boy in the historical drama film &quot;Bequest to the Nation&quot;, which was released on 25 April 1973. He appeared in various television advertisements and children&#x27;s films during the 1970s before gaining the starring role of Tom Canty/Prince Edward in a BBC Television version of &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;, directed by Barry Letts and broadcast in January 1976. He gained increased national recognition two years later in two BBC sitcom roles - Raymond Fletcher, the teenage son of Ronnie Barker&#x27;s Norman Stanley Fletcher in &quot;Going Straight&quot;, and Adam Parkinson, a son of Wendy Craig and Geoffrey Palmer in Carla Lane&#x27;s &quot;Butterflies&quot;.

Lyndhurst achieved his best-known role in another BBC sitcom, &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, created and written by John Sullivan, in which he played Rodney Trotter, the younger brother of the main character, Derek &quot;Del Boy&quot; Trotter, played by David Jason. &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; was first aired in 1981 and increased in popularity until it reached it peak in 1996 with its Christmas Day show in the UK. In a BBC poll in 2004 it was voted &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot; by television viewers. He appeared in the show from the start until its final airing at Christmas 2003.

Lyndhurst had a minor part in the 1986 film &quot;Sky Bandits&quot;. The film went straight to video and was never seen in British cinemas. During the mid-1980s and 90s, he also played Ashley Phillips in ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Two of Us&quot;, which co-starred Janet Dibley, and MI5 agent Peter &quot;Piglet&quot; Chapman in &quot;The Piglet Files&quot;, as well as in a number of stage performances.

Lyndhurst played the lead character of Gary Sparrow in the time-travelling sitcom &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot; between 1993 and 1999. At around the same time, he was the face and voice of the TV and radio advertisements for the telecommunications chain Peoples Phone. He said that he declined an opportunity to play the lead of Gary in the 1997 British film &quot;The Full Monty&quot;.

Lyndhurst was the public face of the stationery store WH Smith between 1997 and 1999, starring in their adverts as all four members of one family. He won a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award for his acting in the adverts. In 1999, he played the villainous Uriah Heep opposite Daniel Radcliffe and Dame Maggie Smith in &quot;David Copperfield&quot;.

Lyndhurst joined the cast as a regular in the BBC police procedural series &quot;New Tricks&quot; in 2013, alongside Dennis Waterman and Tamzin Outhwaite. Lyndhurst revived his &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot; character, Gary Sparrow, in a one-off special episode, which was aired on 2 September 2016.

Lyndhurst played the role of Star Keeper in Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Carousel&quot; at the English National Opera in 2019. He played the Governor/Innkeeper in &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; for English National Opera at the London Coliseum in 2019, opposite Kelsey Grammer as Cervantes/Quixote, Danielle de Niese as Aldonza/Dulcinea and Peter Polycarpou as Sancho.

Lyndhurst appeared as Johnny in an episode of the CBBC sitcom &quot;So Awkward&quot;, alongside his son, the late actor Archie Lyndhurst. The episode, &quot;Awardatarian&quot;, was broadcast on 19 September 2019, having originally been released on BBC iPlayer on 12 September 2019.

Lyndhurst was cast as Professor Alan Cornwall in the new &quot;Frasier&quot; series in January 2023.

== Personal life ==
Lyndhurst married Lucy Jane Smith (born 19 April 1973), a former ballet dancer, in a secret ceremony at St Mary&#x27;s Church in Chichester, West Sussex on 1 September 1999, having been engaged since 1990. The Reverend David Parker, rector of St Mary&#x27;s Church, said the 40-minute ceremony took the form of a &quot;traditional Church of England service&quot;.

Lyndhurst and Smith&#x27;s only child, a son, Archie Bjorn Lyndhurst, was born in Westminster, Greater London on 4 October 2000. Archie was an actor and designer, who was best known for his role of Oliver &#x27;Ollie&#x27; Coulton in the CBBC sitcom &quot;So Awkward&quot;. Their son died in his sleep from a brain hemorrhage caused by acute lymphoblastic leukemia at the family home in Fulham, Greater London on 22 September 2020, aged 19. In a statement, he said he and his wife were &quot;utterly grief stricken and respectfully request privacy.&quot;

Lyndhurst and his wife now reside in West Wittering, West Sussex.

Lyndhurst enjoys underwater diving, beekeeping and piloting his own aeroplanes.

<text>Breakbeat is a broad type of electronic music that uses drum breaks, often sampled from early recordings of funk, jazz, and R&amp;B. Breakbeats have been used in styles such as Florida breaks, hip hop, jungle, drum and bass, big beat, breakbeat hardcore, and UK garage styles (including 2-step, breakstep and dubstep).

==Etymology==
The origin of the word &quot;breakbeat&quot; is the fact that the drum loops that were sampled occurred during a &quot;break&quot; in the music - for example the &quot;Amen break&quot; (a drum solo from &quot;Amen, Brother&quot; by The Winstons) or the &quot;Think Break&quot; (from &quot;Think (About It)&quot; by Lyn Collins).

==History==
===1970s—1980s: Classic breaks and hip hop production===
Beginning in 1973 and continuing through the late 1970s and early 1980s, hip hop turntablists such as DJ Kool Herc began using several funk breaks in a row, using drum breaks from jazz-funk tracks such as James Brown&#x27;s &quot;Funky Drummer&quot; and The Winstons&#x27; &quot;Amen, Brother&quot;, to form the rhythmic base for hip hop songs. DJ Kool Herc&#x27;s breaks style involved playing the same record on two turntables and playing the break repeatedly, alternating between the two records. Grandmaster Flash perfected this idea with what he called the &quot;quick-mix theory&quot;: he would mark the points on the record where the break began and ended with a crayon, so that he could easily replay the break by spinning the record and not touching the tone arm. This style was copied and improved upon by early hip hop DJs Afrika Bambaataa and Grand Wizard Theodore. This style was extremely popular in clubs and dancehalls because the extended breaks compositions provided breakers with more opportunities to showcase their skills.

In the late 1970s, breakbeats had attained a large presence in hip hop. In the 1980s, the evolution of technology began to make sampling breaks easier and more affordable for DJs and producers, which helped nurture the commercialization of hip hop. Through early techniques such as pausing tapes and then recording the break, by the 1980s, technology allowed anybody with a tape recorder to find the breakbeat.

=== 1990s: Evolution as electronic dance genre ===
In the late-1980s, breakbeat became an essential feature of many genres of breaks music which became popular within the global dance music scene, including acid breaks, electro-funk, and Miami bass, and a decade later big beat and nu skool breaks.

In the early 1990s, acid house artists and producers started using breakbeat samples in their music to create breakbeat hardcore. The hardcore scene then diverged into subgenres like jungle and drum and bass, which generally was faster and focused more on complex sampled drum patterns. An example of this is Goldie&#x27;s album &quot;Timeless&quot;. Josh Lawford of Ravescene prophesied that breakbeat was &quot;the death-knell of rave&quot; because the ever-changing drumbeat patterns of breakbeat music didn&#x27;t allow for the same zoned out, trance-like state that the standard, steady 4/4 beats of house enabled.

Incorporating many components of those genres, the Florida breaks subgenre followed during the early-to-mid 1990s and had a unique sound that was soon internationally popular among producers, DJs, and club-goers.

In 1994, the influential techno act Autechre released the &quot;Anti EP&quot; in response to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, deliberately using advanced algorithmic programming to generate non-repetitive breakbeats for the full duration of the tracks, in order to subvert the legal definitions within that legislation which specified in the section creating police powers to remove ravers from raves that &quot;&#x27;music&#x27; includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats&quot;.

In the late 1990s, another style of breakbeat emerged, &quot;funky breaks&quot;, a style that was incorporating elements of trance, hip hop and jungle. It was pioneered by the Chemical Brothers and James Lavelle&#x27;s Mo&#x27;Wax Records imprint. The genre had commercial peak in 1997, when such music was topping in pop charts and often featured in commercials. The most notable artists of the sound were The Prodigy, Death in Vegas, The Crystal Method, Propellerheads.

==Characteristics==
The tempo of breaks tracks, ranging from 110 to 150 beats per minute, allows DJs to mix breaks with a wide range of different genres in their sets. This has led to breakbeats being used in many hip hop, jungle/drum &amp; bass and hardcore tracks. They can also be heard in other music, anywhere from popular music to background music in car and clothing commercials on radio or TV.

=== The &quot;Amen break&quot; ===

The Amen break, a drum break from The Winstons&#x27; song &quot;Amen, Brother&quot; is widely regarded as one of the most widely used and sampled breaks among music using breakbeats. This break was first used on &quot;King of the Beats&quot; by Mantronix, and has since been used in thousands of songs. Other popular breaks are from James Brown&#x27;s &quot;Funky Drummer&quot; (1970) and &quot;Give it Up or Turnit a Loose&quot;, The Incredible Bongo Band&#x27;s 1973 cover of The Shadows&#x27; &quot;Apache&quot;, and Lyn Collins&#x27; 1972 song &quot;Think (About It)&quot;. The Winstons have not received royalties for third-party use of samples of the break recorded on their original music release.

==Sampled breakbeats==
With the advent of digital sampling and music editing on the computer, breakbeats have become much easier to create and use. Now, instead of cutting and splicing tape sections or constantly backspinning two records at the same time, a computer program can be used to cut, paste, and loop breakbeats endlessly. Digital effects such as filters, reverb, reversing, time stretching and pitch shifting can be added to the beat, and even to individual sounds by themselves. Individual instruments from within a breakbeat can be sampled and combined with others, thereby creating wholly new breakbeat patterns.

===Legal issues===
With the rise in popularity of breakbeat music and the advent of digital audio samplers, companies started selling &quot;breakbeat packages&quot; for the express purpose of helping artists create breakbeats. A breakbeat kit CD would contain many breakbeat samples from different songs and artists, often without the artist&#x27;s permission or even knowledge.

==Subgenres==
===Acid breaks===
&quot;Acid breaks&quot; or &quot;chemical breaks&quot; is acid house, but with a breakbeat instead of a house beat. One of the earliest synthesizers to be employed in acid music was the Roland TB-303, which makes use of a resonant low-pass filter to emphasize the harmonics of the sound.

===Asian breakbeat===
The Asian breakbeat scene is a remix genre blending elements of Freestyle, electro, progressive trance melodies, Florida Breaks drums and Southern rap, Crunk. It was originated and made popular by predominantly Vietnamese American and Southeast Asian DJs throughout the U.S. South (Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina) during the 1990s and 2000s. Notable active DJs include New Orleans&#x27; Dj Babyboi, Tinman, and Loopy.

===Big beat===

Big beat is a term employed since the mid-1990s by the British music press to describe much of the music by artists such as The Prodigy, Cut La Roc, Fatboy Slim, The Chemical Brothers, The Crystal Method and Propellerheads typically driven by heavy breakbeats combined with four-on-the floor kick drums, synthesizer-generated loops and patterns in common with established forms of electronic dance music such as techno and acid house.

=== Electro breaks ===
Breakbeat combined with electro music, often using 80s synths, robotic sounds, vocals with vocoders or talkboxes, and infused with elements of funk. Electro breaks was pioneered by Afrika Bambaataa &amp; The Soulsonic Force, Kraftwerk, Man Parrish, Cybotron, and Newcleus. 

=== Andalusian Breakbeat ===
In Spain from the mid-1990s to early 2000s, breakbeat became a massive social movement, especially in the southern part of the country, Andalusia.

Largely responsible for the spread of the &quot;broken rhythm&quot; in Andalusia, was the public radio station of the autonomous community: Canal Sur Radio and Canal Fiesta known at that time as &quot;Fórmula 1&quot;, where the program &quot;Mundo Evassion&quot; was broadcast» or «Evassion Planet» which was presented by Dani Moreno. Artists to highlight: Digital Base, Dj Nitro, Jordi Slate, Man, Wally, Kultur, Jan B, Anuschka, Ale Baquero. 

The breakbeat of Andalusia has been forming its own style, based on a simple structure of &quot;Pre breaks&quot; + &quot;Pre drop&quot; + &quot;Drop&quot;. All this repeated a second time with some variations in the song. With this structure, the tracks are mixed when one has passed the drop, until the pre drop of the next one arrives. Respecting the melodies without breaks. 

Andalusian breakbeat has once again become a mass industry, with festivals almost exclusively dedicated to this genre, such as the Winter Festival, Summer festival, Floridance, Retro fest, or Olibass. 

=== Progressive breaks ===

Progressive breaks or prog breaks, also known as atmospheric breaks, is a subgenre of breaks that is essentially a fusion of breakbeat and progressive house. Much like progressive house, this subgenre is characterized by its &quot;trancey&quot; sound. Its defining traits include extended synthesizer pads and washes, melodic synth leads, heavy reverberation, and electronic breakbeats. However, unlike progressive house, very few progressive breaks tracks have vocals, with most tracks being entirely instrumental or using only electronically altered snippets of vocal samples for sonic effect. Typical progressive breaks tracks will often have a long build-up section that leads to a breakdown and a climax, often having numerous sonic elements being added or subtracted from the track at various intervals in order to increase its intensity. Progressive breaks artists include Hybrid, BT, Way Out West, Digital Witchcraft, Momu, Wrecked Angle, Fourthstate, Burufunk, Under This and Fretwell.

<text>The Intel 8008 (&quot;&quot;eight-thousand-eight&quot; or &quot;eighty-oh-eight&quot;&quot;) is an early 8-bit microprocessor capable of addressing 16 KB of memory, introduced in April 1972. The 8008 architecture was designed by Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC) and was implemented and manufactured by Intel. While the 8008 was originally designed for use in CTC&#x27;s Datapoint 2200 programmable terminal, an agreement between CTC and Intel permitted Intel to market the chip to other customers after Seiko expressed an interest in using it for a calculator.

==History==
In order to address several issues with the Datapoint 3300, including excessive heat radiation, Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC) designed the architecture of the 3300&#x27;s planned successor with a CPU as part of the internal circuitry re-implemented on a single chip. Looking for a company able to produce their chip design, CTC co-founder Austin O. &quot;Gus&quot; Roche turned to Intel, then primarily a vendor of memory chips. Roche met with Bob Noyce, who expressed concern with the concept; John Frassanito recalls that: Another major concern was that Intel&#x27;s existing customer base purchased their memory chips for use with their own processor designs; if Intel introduced their own processor, they might be seen as a competitor, and their customers might look elsewhere for memory. Nevertheless, Noyce agreed to a US$50,000 development contract in early 1970 (). Texas Instruments (TI) was also brought in as a second supplier.

In December 1969, Intel engineer Stan Mazor and a representative of CTC met to discuss options for the logic chipset to power a new CTC business terminal. Mazor, who had been working with Ted Hoff on the development of the Intel 4004, proposed that a one-chip programmable microprocessor might be less cumbersome and ultimately more cost effective than building a custom logic chipset. CTC agreed and development work began on the chip, which at the time was known as the 1201.

TI was able to make samples of the 1201 based on Intel drawings, but these proved to be buggy and were rejected. Intel&#x27;s own versions were delayed. CTC decided to re-implement the new version of the terminal using discrete TTL instead of waiting for a single-chip CPU. The new system was released as the Datapoint 2200 in the spring of 1970, with their first sale to General Mills on 25 May 1970. CTC paused development of the 1201 after the 2200 was released, as it was no longer needed. Later in early 1971, Seiko approached Intel, expressing an interest in using the 1201 in a scientific calculator, likely after seeing the success of the simpler 4004 used by Busicom in their business calculators. A small re-design followed, under the leadership of Federico Faggin, the designer of the 4004, now project leader of the 1201, expanding from a 16-pin to 18-pin design, and the new 1201 was delivered to CTC in late 1971.

By that point, CTC had once again moved on, this time to the Datapoint 2200 II, which was faster. The 1201 was no longer powerful enough for the new model. CTC voted to end their involvement with the 1201, leaving the design&#x27;s intellectual property to Intel instead of paying the $50,000 contract. Intel renamed it the 8008 and put it in their catalog in April 1972 priced at US$120 (). This renaming tried to ride off the success of the 4004 chip, by presenting the 8008 as simply a 4 to 8 port, but the 8008 is &quot;not&quot; based on the 4004. The 8008 went on to be a commercially successful design. This was followed by the Intel 8080, and then the hugely successful Intel x86 family. 

One of the first teams to build a complete system around the 8008 was Bill Pentz&#x27;s team at California State University, Sacramento. The &quot;Sac State 8008&quot; was possibly the first true microcomputer, with a disk operating system built with IBM Basic assembly language in PROM, all driving a color display, hard drive, keyboard, modem, audio/paper tape reader, and printer. The project started in the spring of 1972, and with key help from Tektronix, the system was fully functional a year later.

In the UK, a team at S. E. Laboratories Engineering (EMI) led by Tom Spink in 1972 built a microcomputer based on a pre-release sample of the 8008. Joe Hardman extended the chip with an external stack. This, among other things, gave it power-fail save and recovery. Joe also developed a direct screen printer. The operating system was written using a meta-assembler developed by L. Crawford and J. Parnell for a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11. The operating system was burnt into a PROM. It was interrupt-driven, queued, and based on a fixed page size for programs and data. An operational prototype was prepared for management, who decided not to continue with the project.

The 8008 was the CPU for the very first commercial non-calculator personal computers (excluding the Datapoint 2200 itself): the US SCELBI kit and the pre-built French Micral N and Canadian MCM/70. It was also the controlling microprocessor for the first several models in Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s 2640 family of computer terminals.

In 1973, Intel offered an instruction set simulator for the 8008 named INTERP/8. It was written in FORTRAN IV by Gary Kildall while he worked as a consultant for Intel.

==Design==

The 8008 was implemented in 10 μm silicon-gate enhancement-mode PMOS logic. Initial versions could work at clock frequencies up to 0.5 MHz. This was later increased in the 8008-1 to a specified maximum of 0.8 MHz. Instructions take between 3 and 11 T-states, where each T-state is 2 clock cycles.
Register–register loads and ALU operations take 5T (20 μs at 0.5 MHz), register–memory 8T (32 μs), while calls and jumps (when taken) take 11 T-states (44 μs).
The 8008 is a little slower in terms of instructions per second (36,000 to 80,000 at 0.8 MHz) than the 4-bit Intel 4004 and Intel 4040. but since the 8008 processes data 8 bits at a time and can access significantly more RAM, in most applications it has a significant speed advantage over these processors. The 8008 has 3,500 transistors.

The chip, limited by its 18-pin DIP, has a single 8-bit bus working triple duty to transfer 8 data bits, 14 address bits, and two status bits. The small package requires about 30 TTL support chips to interface to memory. For example, the 14-bit address, which can access &quot;16 K × 8 bits of memory&quot;, needs to be latched by some of this logic into an external memory address register (MAR). The 8008 can access 8 input ports and 24 output ports.

For controller and CRT terminal use, this is an acceptable design, but it is rather cumbersome to use for most other tasks, at least compared to the next generations of microprocessors. A few early computer designs were based on it, but most would use the later and greatly improved Intel 8080 instead.

=== Related processor designs ===
The subsequent 40-pin NMOS Intel 8080 expanded upon the 8008 registers and instruction set and implements a more efficient external bus interface (using the 22 additional pins). Despite a close architectural relationship, the 8080 was not made binary compatible with the 8008, so an 8008 program would not run on an 8080. However, as two different assembly syntaxes were used by Intel at the time, the 8080 could be used in an 8008 assembly-language backward-compatible fashion.

The Intel 8085 is an electrically modernized version of the 8080 that uses depletion-mode transistors and also added two new instructions.

The Intel 8086, the original x86 processor, is a non-strict extension of the 8080, so it loosely resembles the original Datapoint 2200 design as well. Almost every Datapoint 2200 and 8008 instruction has an equivalent not only in the instruction set of the 8080, 8085, and Z80, but also in the instruction set of modern x86 processors (although the instruction encodings are different).

===Features===
The 8008 architecture includes the following features:
* Seven 8-bit &quot;scratchpad&quot; registers: The main accumulator (A) and six other registers (B, C, D, E, H, and L).
* 14-bit program counter (PC).
* Seven-level push-down address call stack. Eight registers are actually used, with the top-most register being the PC.
* Four condition code status flags: carry (C), even parity (P), zero (Z), and sign (S).
* Indirect memory access using the H and L registers (HL) as a 14-bit data pointer (the upper two bits are ignored).

==Instruction set==
Instructions are all one to three bytes long, consisting of an initial opcode byte, followed by up to two bytes of operands which can be an immediate operand or a program address. Instructions operate on 8-bits only; there are no 16-bit operations. There is only one mechanism to address data memory: indirect addressing pointed to by a concatenation of the H and L registers, referenced as M. The 8008 does, however, support 14-bit program addresses. It has automatic CAL and RET instructions for multi-level subroutine calls and returns which can be conditionally executed, like jumps. Eight one-byte call instructions (RST) for subroutines exist at the fixed addresses 00h, 08h, 10h, ..., 38h. These are intended to be supplied by external hardware in order to invoke interrupt service routines, but can employed as fast calls. Direct copying may be made between any two registers or a register and memory. Eight math/logic functions are supported between the accumulator (A) and any register, memory, or an immediate value. Results are always deposited in A. Increments and decrements are supported for most registers but, curiously, not A. Register A does, however, support four different rotate instructions. All instructions are executed in 3 to 11 states. Each state requires two clocks.

===Code example 1===

The following 8008 assembly source code is for a subroutine named codice_1 that copies a block of data bytes of a given size from one location to another. Intel&#x27;s 8008 assembler supported only + and - operators. This example borrows the 8080&#x27;s assembler AND and SHR (shift right) operators to select the low and high bytes of a 14-bit address for placement into the 8 bit registers. A contemporaneous 8008 programmer was expected to calculate the numbers and type them in for the assembler.

In the code above, all values are given in octal. Locations , , and are 16-bit parameters for the subroutine named . In actuality, only 14 bits of the values are used, since the CPU has only a 14-bit addressable memory space. The values are stored in little-endian format, although this is an arbitrary choice, since the CPU is incapable of reading or writing more than a single byte into memory at a time. Since there is no instruction to load a register directly from a given memory address, the HL register pair must first be loaded with the address, and the target register can then be loaded from the M operand, which is an indirect load from the memory location in the HL register pair. The BC register pair is loaded with the parameter value and decremented at the end of the loop until it becomes zero. Note that most of the instructions used occupy a single 8-bit opcode.

===Code example 2===
The following 8008 assembly source code is for a simplified subroutine named MEMCPY2 that copies a block of data bytes from one location to another. By reducing the byte counter to 8 bits, there is enough room to load all the subroutine parameters into the 8008&#x27;s register file.

==Interrupts==
Interrupts on the 8008 are only partially implemented. After the INT line is asserted, the 8008 acknowledges the interrupt by outputting a state code of S0,S1,S2 = 011 at T1I time. At the subsequent instruction fetch cycle, an instruction is &quot;jammed&quot; (Intel&#x27;s word) by external hardware on the bus. Typically this is a one-byte RST instruction.

At this point, there is a problem. The 8008 has no provision to save its architectural state. The 8008 can only write to memory via an address in the HL register pair. When interrupted, there is no mechanism to save HL so there is no way to save the other registers and flags via HL. Because of this, some sort of external memory device such as a hardware stack or a pair of read/write registers must be attached to the 8008 via the I/0 ports to help save the state of the 8008.

==Designers==
*CTC (&quot;Instruction set and architecture&quot;): Victor Poor and Harry Pyle.
*Intel (&quot;Implementation in silicon&quot;):
** Ted Hoff and Stan Mazor proposed a single-chip implementation of the CTC architecture, using RAM-register memory rather than shift-register memory, and also added a few instructions and interrupt facility. The 8008 (originally called 1201) chip design started before the 4004 development. Hoff and Mazor, however, could not and did not develop a &quot;silicon design&quot; because they were neither chip designers nor process developers, and furthermore the necessary silicon-gate-based design methodology and circuits, under development by Federico Faggin for the 4004, were not yet available.
** Federico Faggin, having finished the design of the 4004, became leader of the project from January 1971 until its successful completion in April 1972, after it had been suspended – for lack of progress – for about seven months. 
** Hal Feeney, project engineer, did the detailed logic design, circuit design, and physical layout under Faggin&#x27;s supervision, employing the same design methodology that Faggin had originally developed for the Intel 4004 microprocessor, and utilizing the basic circuits he had developed for the 4004. A combined &quot;HF&quot; logo was etched onto the chip about halfway between the D5 and D6 bonding pads.

<text>The Communications Act of 1934 is a United States federal law signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on June 19, 1934, and codified as Chapter 5 of Title 47 of the United States Code, et seq. The act replaced the Federal Radio Commission with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). It also transferred regulation of interstate telephone services from the Interstate Commerce Commission to the FCC.

The first section of the act originally read as follows: &quot;For the purpose of regulating interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make available, so far as possible to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges, for the purpose of the national defense, for the purpose of promoting safety of life and property through the use of wire and radio communication, and for the purpose of securing a more effective execution of this policy by centralizing authority heretofore granted by law to several agencies and by granting additional authority with respect to interstate and foreign commerce in wire and radio communication, there is hereby created a commission to be known as the &quot;Federal Communications Commission,&quot; which shall be constituted as hereinafter provided, and which shall execute and enforce the provisions of this Act.&quot;; although it has since been amended.

On January 3, 1996, the 104th Congress of the United States amended or repealed sections of the Communications Act of 1934 with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. It was the first major overhaul of American telecommunications policy in nearly 62 years.

==History==
The Communications Act of 1934 largely combined and reorganized existing provisions of law, including provisions of the Federal Radio Act of 1927 relating to radio licensing, and of the Mann-Elkins Act of 1910 relating to telephone service.

In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Daniel C. Roper, Secretary of Commerce, to appoint an interdepartmental committee for studying electronic communications. The Committee reported that &quot;the communications service, as far as congressional action is involved, should be regulated by a single body&quot;. A recommendation was made for the establishment of a new agency that would regulate all interstate and foreign communication by wire and radio, telegraphy, telephone and broadcast.

On February 26, 1934, the President sent a special message to Congress urging the creation of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The following day Senator Clarence Dill and Representative Sam Rayburn introduced bills to carry out this recommendation. The Senate Bill (S.3285) passed the House on June 1, 1934, and the conference report was adopted by both houses eight days later. The Communications Act was signed by President Roosevelt in June 1934. Particular parts of it became effective July 1, 1934; the remaining parts on July 11, 1934.

The Communications Act of 1934 followed the precedents of trial cases set under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3), regulating commerce &quot;among the several states&quot;. Twenty years earlier, in 1914, the U.S. Supreme Court had set limits on price discrimination that were effectively interstate commerce in &quot;Houston, East &amp; West Texas Railway Co. v. United States&quot;. The railway was setting lower prices for intrastate carriers within Texas while charging more for carriers that were going through or out of the state. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the ICC, and maximum prices were set to limit the damage that other states could face due to price discrimination.

Communications technology was determined to be an interstate good. President Franklin Roosevelt, along with lobbyists and state regulators, wanted communications technology, both wired and wireless, to be monitored in a similar way and influenced Congress to pass the Communications Act of 1934. The goal was to have telephone and broadcasting regulated with the same jurisdiction in a way similar to that in which the ICC regulates the railways and interstate commerce. The act did not, however, allow for price regulation through the FCC due to strong lobbying efforts from the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC).

Currently there are some challenges and proposed changes to the act. The company CellAntenna unsuccessfully sued the FCC, claiming the Homeland Security Act of 2002 did override the Communications Act of 1934.

The 1934 Communications Act prohibits local and state law enforcement from using jamming devices to thwart criminal and terrorist acts. CellAntenna lost its case, but as a response have supported legislation (The Safe Prisons Communications Act) sponsored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Representative Kevin Brady, attempting to amend the Communications Act of 1934. The bill was left in committee in the House.

There has been public debate about the need for an Internet kill switch, defined in a proposed Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act. This act removes the powers established in the 19 Act and gives the President the authority to stop the Internet in case of a cyber attack.

The act forbids foreign individuals, governments, and corporations owning more than 20% of the capital stock of a broadcast, common carrier, or radio station. In 2013 the FCC relaxed these rules.

==Structure==
The Communications Act of 1934, , consists of seven major sections or &quot;subchapters&quot;, as expressed in the US Code, Title 47 (Communications), Chapter 5 — Wire or Radio Communication:

*Subchapter I: General Provisions (§§ 151 – 163)
*Subchapter II: Common carriers (§§ 201 – 276)
*Subchapter III: Special provisions related to radio (§§ 301 – 399b)
*Subchapter IV: Procedural and administrative provisions (§§ 401 – 416)
*Subchapter V: Penal provisions; Forfeitures (§§ 501 – 511)
*Subchapter V-A: Cable communications (added by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984) (§§ 521 – 573)
*Subchapter VI: Miscellaneous provisions (§§ 601 – 624)
*Subchapter VII: Broadband data (§§ 641 – 64)

==Legacy==
The act established a legal basis for regulating wired and wireless communications on a nationwide and worldwide basis. The Federal Communications Commission was founded because of the act; it replaced the Federal Radio Commission. Because of the act, the U.S. government could regulate new media technologies such as television and mobile phones.

Moreover, the act permitted the regulation of commercial communication corporations such as private radio and television companies. Opponents in Congress argued that the act harmed the telecommunications industry, such as by delaying the development of new technologies. In 1982, Congress produced a report recommending changes called &quot;Proposals for Revision of the Communications Act of 1934: Telecommunications Issues&quot;.

===Creation of the Federal Communications Commission===
The Commerce Clause in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the authority to regulate foreign and interstate commerce. By the early 20th century, radio transmission had become the most efficient way to facilitate communication about commerce and therefore, radio frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum could constitutionally be regulated. The Wireless Ship Act of 1910 called for Congress to modestly regulate the wireless industry and the Radio Act of 1912 was their first attempt to make more legislative oversight to the entire radio industry.

This act required anyone who wanted to transmit over the radio to have government issued permission in form of a license. Along with the help of important legislators, these were the early building blocks that eventually evolved into the FCC.

Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover played a large role regarding regulation because he issued the licenses which allocated the spectrum. Once radio broadcasting became popular, Hoover brought attention to the limited amount of frequency space the spectrum held. This problem made obtaining frequencies and airtime very difficult, as well as making &quot;noise&quot; on existing frequencies. Between 1923 and 1924, Hoover expanded the number of assigned frequencies to reduce the interference, but his quick fix failed, which, in turn, ended self-regulation of spectrum space. Congress then passed the Radio Act of 1927 to create the framework for regulating the rapidly-growing broadcast industry.

President Calvin Coolidge was an important aspect of radio regulation by signing the Radio Act of 1927, which invested regulatory power to the Federal Radio Commission (FRC). Senators Clarence Dill and Wallace H. White, Jr. also pushed toward passing the 1927 act. The FRC had a short, 6-year term in American history and transferred its responsibility, as the agency for managing the radio spectrum, to the FCC after the Communications Act of 1934. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the bill in 1934. This change in power was needed to develop a better way of determining who got to use what radio bands and for what purposes. There were many factors and individuals that played a role in the creation of the FCC, but in the end, Congress created the agency.

=== Wiretapping ===
In section 605 of the act, the FCC was empowered by Congress to enforce wiretapping compliance. Academic Colin Agur argues that the Communications Act of 1934 &quot;filled a legal void&quot; by creating a process through which telephone carrier companies could record and report illegal wiretapping requests and the FCC could punish law enforcement officials who abused wiretapping surveillance.

===Transition from the Federal Radio Commission===
The FCC took over regulation in 1934 and changed many of the structural characteristics of the original agency, although its goal of reducing interference remained the same. The original FRC had 5 members who were each responsible for representing one geographical area of the United States. Congress also planned for the 5-member agency to become a quasi-judicial body which would only have to meet when necessary. Their jobs were to alleviate &quot;noise&quot; from the airwaves and they were given the power to license and regulate radio stations. The Federal Radio Commission&#x27;s lack of regulatory action lead to the more permanent Federal Communications Commission. Much like the FRC, the FCC consists of commissioners who are appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. Each Commissioner can only serve for a five-year term, even the one chosen to be the chairperson. Originally there were 7 commissioners with 7 year terms, but this was changed to 5 commissions with 5 year terms in 1986. Though there are only five commissioners, there are several offices and departments, made up of hundreds and staff members that carry out different duties. For example, the Mass Media Bureau processes license applications and renewals. These divisions of administrative duties differentiate the FRC from the FCC.

==Changes and amendments==

===1960s quiz show amendments===
Amendments made to the Act in 1960, passed in the wake of the 1950s quiz show scandals, prohibited the presentation of scripted game shows under the guise of a legitimate contest.

===Public Broadcasting Act of 1967===
===Telecommunications Act of 1996===
The Telecommunication Act 1996 contained two major changes from the original Communications Act of 1934: the new act was less technologically biased and offered less regulation.
This act determined the basis of media regulation by its contents, not a technological standard. Title V in Telecommunication Act of 1996, &quot;Obscenity and Violence&quot;, is a good example of this; Title V set the standard for regulating media contents.
The Communications Act of 1934 is argued by some to have created monopolies, such as the case of AT&amp;T. The FCC recognized AT&amp;T as a &quot;natural monopoly&quot; during the 1930s in the Communications Act of 1934. Because of these effects, the FCC designed the Communications Act 1996 &quot;to provide for a pro-competitive, de-regulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced information technologies and services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition...&quot; The Telecommunication Act of 1996 also added and changed some rules to account for the emerging internet.

The FCC derives its jurisdiction to facilitate the deployment of broadband to Americans in Section 706 in the Telecommunications act of 1996. In this section the code states that the FCC is to &quot;encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans.&quot;
They currently want to advocate the following objectives:
*Broaden the deployment of broadband technologies
*Define broadband to include any platform capable of transmitting high-bandwidth intensive services
*Ensure harmonized regulatory treatment of competing broadband services
*Encourage and facilitate an environment that stimulates investment and innovation in broadband technologies and services

===1984 &amp; 1992 Amendments===
* The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 added Title VI—Cable Communications, which deregulated the cable industry.
* The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 amended Title VI and required cable systems to carry most local broadcast channels and prohibited cable operators from charging local broadcasters to carry their signal.

One major amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 was made on September 7, 1999. The FCC ruled &quot;that a broadcast station should not be allowed to refuse a request for political advertising time solely on the ground that the station does not sell or program such lengths of time&quot;. Politics have had many effects and changes to the act that are not in the &quot;best interest of the public&quot; thus taking away some of the power given to the FCC from the Act.

===Proposed amendments===
The Federal Communications Commission Consolidated Reporting Act of 2013 (H.R. 2844; 113th Congress) would amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to publish on its website and submit to Congress a biennial report on the state of the communications marketplace. That report would include an analysis of &quot;the state of competition in the markets for voice, video, and data services, as well as the availability of high-speed and high-quality telecommunications services&quot; in the United States. It would also &quot;require the FCC to determine whether laws and regulations pose a barrier to entry into communications markets and to include that information in the biennial report&quot; and cancel a number of preexisting requirements for various other reports from the FCC.

==Controversies==

===1934: Commercial radio debate===
Before the Communications Act of 1934 was enacted as law by the U.S. Congress, there was a debate over commercial versus non-commercial broadcasting: Senators Robert Wagner of New York and Henry Hatfield of West Virginia offered an amendment to the then proposed Communications Act. Educators wanted more of radio to be given to them; they had been termed a &quot;special interest&quot; by the Federal Radio Commission and their stations were forced to share frequencies.

The Wagner-Hatfield amendment would have given 25% of all radio broadcasting facilities to non-profit institutions and organizations. It would also have allowed these educational stations to sell advertising in order to become self-sufficient.

Senator Clarence Dill, a pro-industry spokesman, opposed this amendment. It would have meant eliminating numerous commercial stations, but that is not what Senator Dill publicly complained about. He expressed horror over the advertising. He said there was too much advertising already. Not all educators supported the advertising clause, so a compromise was struck.

The issue was to be given to the new FCC to study and to hold hearings on and to report back to Congress. Hatfield and Wagner stuck to their guns, however, and proposed their amendment anyway. The Hatfield-Wagner amendment died and the Communications Act was passed.

The Federal Communications Commission reported back, saying that commercial stations had ample time for educational and other public service programs. The Commission called for cooperation between commercial and educational interests and other non-profit groups. The educators lost, although commercial broadcasters were forced to air public affairs programs.

===1943: Chain (network) case===
The U.S. Supreme Court held in &quot;National Broadcasting Co. v. United States&quot;, 319 U.S. 190 on May 10, 1943, that the FCC had the right to issue regulations pertaining to associations between broadcasting networks and their affiliated stations. The opinion of the Supreme Court was not unanimous and it led to a conflict with an earlier decision in &quot;Federal Communications Commission v. Sanders Brothers Radio Station&quot;, 309 U.S. 470, on March 25, 1940.

In that case the FCC interpreted Supreme Court decisions concerning broadcasting to mean that potential economic injury to an existing licensee was not grounds for refusing to license a competitor. (This FCC interpretation remained in place from 1940 to 1958.)

The opinion of the Supreme Court was delivered by Felix Frankfurter. Justices Hugo Black and Wiley Blount Rutledge took no part in the discussion or decision. Justice Frank Murphy offered a dissenting opinion, stating that the Court was effectively giving the FCC a power to regulate networks which had not been given to the FCC by Congress. Murphy stated that

Because the majority of the Court did not agree with Murphy, it effectively gave the FCC power to regulate the networks. As a result of this 1943 decision, NBC was forced to sell one of its two networks—the Blue Network—and it was this action which then led to the creation of the American Broadcasting Company.

<text>ITT Inc., formerly ITT Corporation, is an American worldwide manufacturing company based in Stamford, Connecticut. The company produces specialty components for the aerospace, transportation, energy and industrial markets. ITT&#x27;s three businesses include Industrial Process, Motion Technologies, and Connect and Control Technologies. 
ITT has over 10,000 employees in more than 35 countries and serves customers in more than 100 countries. The company&#x27;s long-standing brands include Goulds Pumps, Cannon connectors, KONI shock absorbers and Enidine energy absorption components.

The company was founded in 1920 as International Telephone &amp; Telegraph. During the 1960s and 1970s, under the leadership of CEO Harold Geneen, the company rose to prominence as the archetypal conglomerate, deriving its growth from hundreds of acquisitions in diversified industries.

ITT divested its telecommunications assets in 1986. In 1995, the company sold off its hospitality portfolio, including Sheraton Hotels and Resorts. In 1996, the current company was founded as a spinoff of ITT as ITT Industries, Inc. It later changed its name to ITT Corporation in 2006.

In 2011, ITT spun off its defense businesses into a company named Exelis (now part of L3Harris Technologies), and its water technology business into a company named Xylem Inc. ITT Corporation changed its name to ITT Inc. in 2016.

==History==

===Beginnings and early acquisitions===
Brothers Hernan Behn and Colonel Sosthenes Behn formed International Telephone &amp; Telegraph (ITT) in 1920. The brothers had acquired the Puerto Rico Telephone Company in 1914, along with the Cuban-American Telephone and Telegraph Company and a half-interest in the Cuban Telephone Company. ITT&#x27;s first major expansion came in 1923, when it consolidated operators in the telecoms market in Spain into what eventually became Telefónica. From 1922 to 1925, ITT purchased a number of European telephone companies.

In 1925, ITT purchased several companies from Western Electric, as Bell had agreed to &quot;divest&quot; itself of its international operations. They included the Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company (BTM) of Antwerp, Belgium, which manufactured rotary system switching-equipment, and the British &quot;International Western Electric&quot;, which was renamed Standard Telephones and Cables (STC). Compagnie Générale d&#x27;Electricité later purchased BTM; Nortel later purchased STC.

In the 1930s, ITT purchased German electronic companies Standard Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft (SEG) and Mix &amp; Genest (both of which were internationally active companies) and Romanian telecommunications monopoly Societatea Anonima Română de Telefoane. Its only serious rival was the Theodore Gary &amp; Company conglomerate, which operated a subsidiary, Associated Telephone and Telegraph, with manufacturing plants in Europe.

In the United States, ITT acquired the various companies of the Mackay Companies in 1928 through a specially organized subsidiary corporation, Postal Telegraph &amp; Cable. These companies included the Commercial Cable Company, the Commercial Pacific Cable Company, Postal Telegraph, and the Federal Telegraph Company.


=== German subsidiaries in the Nazi period ===
On August 3, 1933, Adolf Hitler received Sosthenes Behn (then the CEO of &lt;includeonly&gt;ITT&lt;/includeonly&gt;) and his German representative, Henry Mann, in one of his first meetings with US businessmen.

In his book &quot;Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler&quot;, Antony C. Sutton claims that ITT subsidiaries made cash payments to SS-leader Heinrich Himmler. ITT, through its subsidiary C. Lorenz AG, owned 25% of Focke-Wulf, the German aircraft-manufacturer, builder of some of the most successful Luftwaffe fighter-aircraft. In the 1960s, ITT Corporation won $27 million in compensation for damage inflicted on its share of the Focke-Wulf plant by Allied bombing during World War II. In addition, Sutton&#x27;s book uncovers that ITT owned shares of &quot;Signalbau AG, Dr. Erich F. Huth&quot; (Signalbau Huth), which produced for the German Wehrmacht radar equipment and transceivers in Berlin, Hanover (later Telefunken factory), and other places. While ITT - Focke-Wulf planes were bombing Allied ships and ITT lines were passing information to German submarines, ITT direction-finders were saving other ships from torpedoes. The payments to Himmler were noted in a 1946 banking investigation report by the Office of Military Government, United States.

In 1943, ITT became the largest shareholder of Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau GmbH with 29%, and remained so for the duration of the war. This was due to Kaffee HAG&#x27;s share falling to 27% after the death in May of Kaffee HAG chief Dr. Ludwig Roselius. OMGUS documents reveal that the role of the HAG conglomerate could not be determined during WWII.

=== Post-war acquisitions ===
In 1951, ITT purchased Philo Farnsworth&#x27;s television company to break into that market. At the time Farnsworth was also developing the Fusor fusion reactor, which was funded by ITT until 1967. Also in 1951, ITT bought a majority interest in the Kellogg Switchboard &amp; Supply Company (founded in 1897 as a pioneer in &quot;divided-multiple&quot; telephone switchboards) and bought the remaining shares the next year. ITT changed the company&#x27;s name to ITT Kellogg. After merging Federal Telephone and Radio Corporation into ITT Kellogg and combining manufacturing operations the name again changed to ITT Telecommunications, eventually reverting to ITT Kellogg.

One prominent subsidiary of this was the American Cable and Radio Corporation, which operated the transatlantic cables of the Commercial Cable Company, among other ventures. It bought Philadelphia-based heating and air-conditioning manufacturer John J. Nesbitt Inc. 
In 1968, the company purchased Levittown homebuilder Levitt &amp; Sons for a reported $90 million.

In 1972 the KONI Group, manufacturer of shock absorbers was added to the list of ITT&#x27;s acquisitions.

=== International telecommunications ===
International telecommunications manufacturing subsidiaries included Standard Telephones and Cables in the United Kingdom and Australia, Indosat in Indonesia, Standard Elektrik Lorenz (today part of Nokia Germany) and &quot; Gesellschaft für Metallurgie und Elektronik mbH&quot; (acquired from Clevite in 1965; now TDK-Micronas) in Germany, BTM in Belgium, and CGCT and LMT in France. These companies manufactured equipment according to ITT designs including the (1960s) Pentaconta crossbar switch and (1970s) Metaconta D, L and 10c Stored Program Control exchanges, mostly for sale to their respective national telephone administrations. This equipment was also produced under license in Poznań (Poland), and in Yugoslavia and elsewhere. ITT was the largest owner of the LM Ericsson company in Sweden, but sold out in 1960.

Alec Reeves, an ITT employee in France in the 1930s, developed pulse-code modulation (PCM) innovations, upon which future digital voice-communication was based. Charles K. Kao, working at STC in the UK, pioneered the use of optical fiber from 1966, for which he was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.

=== Harold Geneen appointment ===
In 1959, Harold Geneen became CEO. Using leveraged buyouts, he turned the minor acquisitions of the 1950s into major growth during the 1960s. In 1965, ITT attempted to purchase the ABC television network for $700 million. The deal was halted by federal antitrust regulators who feared ITT was growing too large. In order to continue growing while not running afoul of antitrust legislation, it moved to acquire companies outside of the telecommunications industry. Under Geneen, ITT bought over 300 companies in the 1960s, including some hostile takeovers. The deals included well-known businesses like the Sheraton hotel chain, Wonder Bread maker Continental Baking, Rayonier, and Avis Rent-a-Car. ITT also absorbed smaller operations in auto parts, energy, books, semiconductors, and cosmetics. In 1966, ITT acquired Educational Services, Inc., an operator of for-profit schools, which became ITT/ESI. When ITT attempted to acquire The Hartford insurance company in 1970, the US Justice Department filed suit, and ITT agreed to divest assets equal to those of Hartford&#x27;s, including Avis.

ITT&#x27;s sales grew from about $700 million in 1960 to about $8 billion in 1970, and its profit from $29 million to $550 million. However, when increased interest rates started eating away at profits in the late 1960s, ITT&#x27;s growth slowed considerably.

In the late 1960s, the British electronics manufacturer Kolster-Brandes Limited, KB for short, had run into trouble with its color television manufacturing, and turned to ITT for help; ITT bought out the company, and for a while, UK products were badged &quot;ITT KB&quot; then eventually just ITT. By the late 1970s, ITT had a good presence on the UK domestic electrical market in television, audio and portable radio products.

=== Brazilian expropriation in 1962 ===
In February 1962, during the presidency of João Goulart, the State Governor of Rio Grande do Sul Leonel Brizola decided to expropriate a Brazilian subsidiary of ITT, the Companhia Telefônica Nacional. During the next years of Goulart&#x27;s presidency, the expropriation was one of the most debated Brazilian political issues. The action from the State Governor to expropriate the company was never supported by the Brazilian president at the time and had severe implications for Brazil–United States relations. Some historians even say that the expropriation was one of the reasons for the federal government of the United States supporting the 1964 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état.

===1972 Republican National Convention ===
ITT became enmeshed in scandal in connection with the 1972 Republican National Convention. In May 1971, ITT president Geneen pledged $400,000 to support a proposal to hold the convention in San Diego; only $100,000 of the contribution was publicly disclosed. The Republican National Committee selected San Diego as the site in July 1971.

However, on February 29, 1972, newspaper columnist Jack Anderson disclosed an interoffice memo from ITT lobbyist Dita Beard to ITT vice president Bill Merriam, dated June 25, 1971. The memo appeared to draw a connection between ITT&#x27;s contribution to the convention and the favorable settlement of a United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division lawsuit. The resulting scandal, including a Senate investigation and the threat of criminal charges, caused ITT to withdraw its support for the San Diego convention. That combined with a shortage of hotel space and problems with the proposed venue led the RNC to move the convention to Miami. Special prosecutor Leon Jaworski investigated the case but ultimately concluded there was no evidence of criminal conduct by ITT.

Nixon aides such as John Dean and Jeb Stuart Magruder have alleged that the Watergate break-in was motivated by the Committee for the Re-Election of the President&#x27;s suspicion that the Democratic National Committee was making similar deals to fund its 1972 convention. This theory is supported by conversations and exchanges between President Richard Nixon and his chief of staff H. R. Haldeman before and after the break-in, as well as by testimony by E. Howard Hunt. However, this theory has also been disputed by others involved in the break-in such as G. Gordon Liddy.

=== Involvement in 1973 Pinochet coup in Chile ===

In 1970, ITT owned 70% of CTC (the Chilean Telephone Company, now Movistar Chile) and funded &quot;El Mercurio&quot;, a Chilean right-wing newspaper. ITT also had some $200 million-worth of investments in Chile. Under Geneen&#x27;s leadership, ITT funneled $350,000 to Allende&#x27;s opponent, Jorge Alessandri. When Allende won the presidential election, ITT offered the CIA $1,000,000 to defeat Allende, though the offer was rejected. Declassified documents released by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency in 2000 reveal that the company financially helped opponents of Salvador Allende&#x27;s government prepare a military coup. On September 28, 1973, an ITT building in New York City was bombed by the Weather Underground for involvement in the coup d&#x27;état.

=== Post-Geneen: Hamilton and Araskog ===
In March 1977, Lyman C. Hamilton was appointed CEO, and Geneen became chairman of the board. In June 1979, while Hamilton was in Asia, Geneen became aware of Hamilton&#x27;s plans to divest ITT&#x27;s European consumer goods business, and lobbied his fellow board members to dismiss Hamilton. In July 1979, Rand Araskog became CEO. Shortly thereafter, Araskog insisted that the board remove Geneen as Chairman, though Geneen remained on the board for four more years.

Araskog over the next two decades dismantled much of ITT, selling most of its holdings.

Starting in 1977, ITT set out to develop an ambitious new Digital Telephone Exchange, System 1240 (later System 12), which reportedly cost US$1 billion. According to &quot;Fortune&quot; in 1985, Araskog directed the company&#x27;s efforts towards a relentless pursuit of developing and promoting System 12, while channeling profits from successful ventures into fulfilling System 12&#x27;s voracious demands. System 12 was intended to operate in all markets, and in all modes, from local switches to long distance. The design was done at the Advanced Technology Center (Stamford, Connecticut and then Shelton, Connecticut). Manufacturing was by ITT&#x27;s subsidiaries, such as BTM in Belgium, where the first production system was installed at Brecht, in August 1982. Initial sales, particularly in Europe and Mexico, were strong, but the new system took longer than expected to integrate, with further losses. Against the advice of headquarters, ITT Telecommunications (ITT Kellogg) in Raleigh, North Carolina undertook the conversion in the US market, and although sales were announced in 1984 and 1985, the attempt ultimately failed, in early 1986.

ITT divested its global telecommunications product ventures, such as ITT Kellogg, to Alcatel Alsthom, a subsidiary of Compagnie Générale d&#x27;Electricité (CGE), resulting in the establishment of Alcatel N.V. (Netherlands) in 1986. This transaction positioned Alcatel N.V. as the world&#x27;s second-largest telecommunications company at that time. Initially, ITT retained a 37% ownership stake, but in March 1992, it proceeded to sell off its remaining 30%, effectively ceasing its participation in the telephone industry. In 2006, Alcatel Alsthom S.A. acquired with Lucent to form Alcatel-Lucent.

ITT Educational Services, Inc. (ESI) was spun off through an IPO in 1994, with ITT as an 83% shareholder (in September 2016, ESI announced plans to close all of its 130 Technical Institutes in 38 states because their students were no longer eligible for federal aid). ITT merged its long-distance division with Metromedia Long Distance in March 1989, creating &quot;Metromedia-ITT&quot;. Metromedia-ITT would eventually be acquired by Long Distance Discount Services, Inc. (LDDS) in 1993. LDDS would later change its name to WorldCom in 1995.

=== 1995 breakup ===
In 1995, with Araskog still at the helm, ITT split into three separate public companies:
* ITT Corp. – In 1997, ITT Corp. completed a merger with Starwood, which wanted to acquire Sheraton Hotels and Resorts. Starwood sold ITT World Directories to VNU. ITT completely divested from ITT/ESI by 1999, but continued to license the ITT Technical Institute name to ESI until its demise in 2016. Also in 1999, ITT Corp. dropped the ITT name in favor of Starwood.
* ITT Hartford – Today, ITT Hartford is still a major insurance company, although it has dropped the ITT from its name altogether. The company is now known as The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
* ITT Industries – ITT operated under this name until 2006 and is a major manufacturing and defense contractor business.
** On July 1, 2006, ITT Industries changed its name to ITT Corporation as a result of its shareholders vote on May 9, 2006.

=== Criminal prosecution ===
In March 2007, ITT Corporation became the first major defense contractor to be convicted for criminal violations of the U.S. Arms Export Control Act. The fines resulted from ITT&#x27;s outsourcing program, in which they transferred night vision goggles and classified information about countermeasures against laser weapons, including light interference filters, to engineers in Singapore, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and the United Kingdom. They were fined US$100 million although they were also given the option of spending half of that sum on research and development of new night vision technology. The United States government will assume rights to the resulting intellectual property.

In its investigation and subsequent ruling, the United States Department of Justice found that the corporation went to significant lengths to circumvent rules regarding the exports, including setting up a front company. According to U.S. Attorney John L. Brownlee, the company fought the investigation in order &quot;to essentially run out the clock on the statute of limitations.&quot;

===Further corporate acquisitions===
An agreement was reached on June 26, 2007 for ITT to acquire the privately held &quot;International Motion Control&quot; (IMC) for $395 million. The deal was closed and finalized in September 2007. An announcement was made September 14, 2010 to close the Cleveland site.

An agreement was reached September 18, 2007 for ITT to buy EDO Corporation for $1.7 billion. After EDO shareholders&#x27; approval, the deal was closed and finalized on December 20, 2007.

On April 16, 2009, ITT announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Laing GmbH of Germany, a privately held leading producer of energy-efficient circulator pumps primarily used in residential and commercial plumbing and heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.

=== 2011 breakup ===
On January 12, 2011, ITT announced a transformation to separate the remaining company into three publicly traded independent companies. On July 14, 2011, ITT announced the names of the three companies: 

* The Industrial Process &amp; Flow Control division would retain the name ITT Corporation.
** ITT Corporation changed its name to ITT Inc. in 2016.
* The Water &amp; Waste Water division became Xylem Inc., symbol XYL (a reference to xylem tissue in plants).
* The Defense division became Exelis Inc., symbol XLS. Exelis was acquired by Harris Corporation in 2015.

Then-ITT stockholders subsequently owned shares in all three companies following the spinoff.

==Headquarters==
In 1929, ITT&#x27;s headquarters were at (75) 67 Broad Street, Manhattan, New York, New York. &quot;During World War II the building was a hub for communications with American submarines operating in the Atlantic Ocean.&quot;

From 1961 to 1989, ITT&#x27;s headquarters were at 320 Park Ave., New York.

1330 Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, which was ITT&#x27;s corporate headquarters prior to its merger with Starwood, was originally owned by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), which ITT attempted to acquire in 1963. After a financial downturn, ABC moved out of the building known as &quot;Brown Rock&quot; and sold it to a Japanese conglomerate which then in turn leased a good portion out to ITT Corporation.

In 2022, ITT&#x27;s global headquarters moved out of White Plains, NY and into Harbor Point in Stamford, CT.

==ITT Avionics==
ITT Avionics was a division of ITT Corporation in Nutley, New Jersey. A 300-foot research tower at ITT Avionics was built in 1947 for scientists for microwave communications systems. Research at the tower had stopped in the 1970s. On the morning of April 4, 1996 at 10:00 am, the tower was demolished with explosives to prepare the site for sale.

In October 1989, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) awarded a contract to ITT Avionics for production of an Airborne Self-Protection Jammer (ASPJ), and a similar contract was issued to Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Westinghouse and ITT had worked together with the U S Government to develop the ASPJ. The contract was later terminated by the government for convenience because the ASPJ failed independent operational test and evaluation (OPEVAL) procedures.

In 1991, the company won a $19.6 million contract from the United States Air Force to develop the &quot;intraflight data link&quot;, a communications system for &quot;tactical airborne forces&quot;. In 2004, they were awarded a $24.9 million contract from the Naval Air Systems Command Weapons Division for engineering software support services provided to the Tactical Aircraft Electronic Warfare Integrated Program Team at Point Mugu, California and China Lake, California.

==Consumer electronics==

Through their then subsidiary Schaub Elektrik Lorenz, ITT manufactured consumer products under the ITT Schaub-Lorenz brand, such as Touring radio receivers and Ideal Color television sets employing Heliochrom picture tubes.

Some television models feature the Ideal-Computer cartridge system, featuring a slot suitable for housing an ultrasonic remote control (acting as front panel buttons while docked), a teletext decoder, or Tele-Match video game dedicated consoles (unrelated to the &quot;ITT Telematch Processor&quot; console, a rebrand of the Fairchild Channel F); the Ideal-Computer system was licensed to other German producers of its time.

ITT Schaub-Lorenz was also behind the Digivision, the first television employing digital signal processing of the image.

For a comparable time span, ITT had also controlled and then fully absorbed English radio and television manufacturer Kolster-Brandes.

In 1986 throughout the following year, the ITT Telecommunications division (which included Schaub-Lorenz and Kolster-Brandes) was transferred to Alcatel through the French CGE, then in 1988 the consumer electronics division was further spun off and sold to Nokia, who sold some products under the ITT Nokia brand.
Nokia closed their German TV factories in 1996, although their use of the ITT brand may have been discontinued earlier.

Since 2006, the ITT brand and logo are licensed to the Karcher corporation, which is not part of the ITT group.

==Customers and programs==

===Federal Aviation Administration NextGen===
In 2007, ITT was awarded a $207 million initial contract by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to lead a team to develop and deploy the Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) system. ADS-B is a key component of the FAA&#x27;s NextGen air traffic control modernization program intended to increase safety and efficiency to meet the growing needs of air transportation. ITT is responsible for overall system integration and engineering and under contract options will operate and maintain the system after deployment through September 2025. The ITT team includes its partners AT&amp;T, Thales North America, WSI, SAIC, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Aerospace Engineering, Sunhillo, Comsearch, MCS of Tampa, Pragmatics, Washington Consulting Group, Aviation Communications and Surveillance Systems (ACSS), Sandia Aerospace and NCR Corporation.

===GeoEye-1===

On September 6, 2008, the ITT-built imaging payload was launched aboard the GeoEye-1 satellite to provide high-resolution earth imaging. The satellite has the ability to collect images at 0.41-meter panchromatic (black and white) and 1.65-meter multispectral (color) resolution. GeoEye-1 can precisely locate an object to within three meters of its true location on the Earth&#x27;s surface. The satellite will also be able to collect up to 700,000 square kilometers of panchromatic imagery per day.

<text>Science fiction comedy (sci-fi comedy) or comic science fiction is a subgenre of science fiction or science fantasy that exploits the science fiction genre&#x27;s conventions for comedic effect. Comic science fiction often mocks or satirizes standard science fiction conventions, concepts and tropes – such as alien invasion of Earth, interstellar travel, or futuristic technology. It can also satirize and criticize present-day society.

An early example was the &quot;Pete Manx&quot; series by Henry Kuttner and Arthur K. Barnes (sometimes writing together and sometimes separately, under the house pen-name of Kelvin Kent). Published in &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; in the late 1930s and early 1940s, the series featured a time-traveling carnival barker who uses his con-man abilities to get out of trouble. Two later series cemented Kuttner&#x27;s reputation as one of the most popular early writers of comic science fiction: the &quot;Gallegher&quot; series (about a drunken inventor and his narcissistic robot) and the &quot;Hogben&quot; series (about a family of mutant hillbillies). The former appeared in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; in 1943 and 1948 and was collected in hardcover as &quot;Robots Have No Tails&quot; (Gnome, 1952), and the latter appeared in &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; in the late 1940s. In the 1950s, comedy became more common in science fiction. Some of the authors contributing to the sub-genre included: Alfred Bester, Harry Harrison, C. M. Kornbluth, Frederik Pohl, and Robert Sheckley.

&quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; is a comic science-fiction series written by Douglas Adams. Originally a radio comedy broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978, it later morphed into other formats, including stage shows, novels, comic books, a 1981 TV series, a 1984 computer game, and 2005 feature film. A prominent series in British popular culture, &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; has become an international multi-media phenomenon; the novels are the most widely distributed, having been translated into more than 30 languages by 2005.

Terry Pratchett&#x27;s 1981 novel &quot;Strata&quot; also exemplifies the comic science fiction genre.

<doc id="66049" wikidata="Q179910" url="?curid=66049" title="Võ Nguyên Giáp">
<text>Võ Nguyên Giáp (, ; 25 August 1911 – 4 October 2013) was a Vietnamese general, communist revolutionary and politician. Highly regarded as a military strategist, Giáp led Vietnamese communist forces to victories in wars against Japan, France, South Vietnam, the United States, and China. Giáp was the military commander of the Việt Minh and the People&#x27;s Army from 1941 to 1972, minister of defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1946–1947 and from 1948 to 1980, and deputy prime minister from 1955 to 1991. He was a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam.

Born in Quảng Bình province to an affluent peasant family, Giáp participated in anti-colonial political activity in his youth, and in 1931 joined the Communist Party of Vietnam, led by Ho Chi Minh. Giáp rose to prominence during World War II as the military leader of the Việt Minh resistance against the Japanese occupation, and after the war led anti-colonial forces in the First Indochina War against the French. He won a decisive victory at the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu, which ended the war. In the Vietnam War, Giáp led the PAVN against South Vietnam and the United States. Giáp was commander of the army during the 1968 Tet Offensive and 1972 Easter Offensive, after which he was succeeded by Văn Tiến Dũng, but remained defense minister through the U.S. withdrawal and final victory against South Vietnam in 1975. Giáp oversaw his final campaigns in the successful Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978 and the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War. He resigned as defense minister in 1980 and left the Politburo in 1982. Giáp remained on the Central Committee and as deputy prime minister until 1991, and died in 2013 at age 102.

Giáp is regarded as a mastermind military leader. During the First Indochina War, he transformed a &quot;rag-tag&quot; band of rebels to a &quot;fine light-infantry army&quot; fielding cryptography, artillery and advanced logistics capable of challenging the larger, modernised French Far East Expeditionary Corps and Vietnamese National Army. Giáp, who in the 1930s had studied law and worked as a history teacher, never attended any courses at a military academy, nor had any direct military training prior to World War II. A highly-effective logistician, he was the principal architect of the Ho Chi Minh trail, the logistical network between North and South Vietnam which is recognised as one of the 20th century&#x27;s great feats of military engineering. 

Giáp is often credited with North Vietnam&#x27;s military victory over the United States and South Vietnam. Recent scholarship cites other leaders as more prominent, with former subordinates and later rivals Dũng and Hoàng Văn Thái later having a more direct military responsibility. Nevertheless, he was crucial to the transformation of the PAVN into &quot;one of the largest, most formidable&quot; mechanised and combined-arms fighting force capable of defeating the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in conventional warfare.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Võ Nguyên Giáp was born on 25 August 1911 (or 1912 according to some sources) in Quảng Bình Province, Annam, French Indochina. Giáp&#x27;s father and mother, Võ Quang Nghiêm and Nguyễn Thị Kiên, worked the land, rented some to neighbours, and lived a relatively comfortable life.

Giáp&#x27;s father was both a minor official and a committed Vietnamese nationalist, having participated in the Cần Vương movement in the 1880s. He was arrested for subversive activities by the French colonial authorities in 1919 and died in prison a few weeks later. Giáp had two sisters and one brother, and soon after his father&#x27;s incarceration, one of his sisters was also arrested. Although she was not held for long, the privations of prison life made her ill and she too died a few weeks after being released.

Giáp was taught at home by his father before going to the village school. His precocious intelligence meant that he was soon transferred to the district school and in 1924, at the age of thirteen, he left home to attend the Quốc Học (also known in English as the &quot;National Academy&quot;), a French-run &quot;lycée&quot; in Huế, where he studied arithmetic, history, geography, literature, and natural science. This school had been founded by a Catholic official named Ngo Dinh Kha, and his son, Ngô Đình Diệm also attended it. Diem later became President of South Vietnam (1955–63). Years earlier the same school had educated another boy, Nguyễn Sinh Cung, also the son of an official. In 1943 Cung adopted the name Ho Chi Minh.

At age 14, Giáp became a messenger for the Haiphong Power Company. He was expelled from the school after two years for taking part in protests, and went home to his village for a while. While there, he joined the &quot;Tân Việt Revolutionary Party&quot;, an underground group founded in 1924, which introduced him to communism. He returned to Hue and continued his political activities. He was arrested in 1930 for taking part in student protests and served 13 months of a two-year sentence at Lao Bảo Prison. By Giáp&#x27;s own account the reason for his release was lack of evidence against him. He joined the Communist Party of Vietnam in 1931 and took part in several demonstrations against French rule in Indochina as well as assisting in founding the Democratic Front in 1933.

Although he denied it, Giáp was said by the historian Cecil B. Currey to have also spent some time in the prestigious Hanoi Lycée Albert Sarraut, where the local elite was educated to serve the colonial regime. He was said to have been in the same class as Phạm Văn Đồng, a future Prime Minister, who also denied studying at Albert Sarraut, and Bảo Đại, the last Emperor of Annam. From 1933 to 1938, Giáp studied at the Indochinese University in Hanoi where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law with a major in political economy.

=== Political activism ===
While a student, Giáp had taken lodgings with Professor Dang Thai Minh, whose daughter, Nguyen Thi Minh Giang (also cited as ; 1915–1944), he had first met at school in Hue. She too had learned nationalism from her father and had joined the revolutionary activities with which Giáp was involved. In June 1938 (or, according to some sources, April 1939) they were married and in May 1939 they had a daughter, Hong Anh (Red Queen of Flowers). Giáp&#x27;s busy political activities took a toll on his postgraduate studies, and he failed to pass the examinations for the Certificate of Administrative Law. Unable therefore to practice as a lawyer, he took a job as a history teacher at the in Hanoi.

As well as teaching in school, Giáp was busy producing and writing articles for &quot;Tiếng Dân&quot; (Voice of the People) founded by Huỳnh Thúc Kháng and many other revolutionary newspapers, while actively participating in various revolutionary movements. All the while, Giáp was a dedicated reader of military history and philosophy, revering Sun Tzu. He also made a particular study of Napoleon&#x27;s generalship, and greatly admired T. E. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;, learning from it practical examples of how to apply minimum military force to maximum effect. He also read and was influenced by historical figures including Carl von Clausewitz, George Washington, and Vladimir Lenin. During the Popular Front years in France, he founded &quot;Hồn Trẻ tập mới&quot; (Soul of Youth), an underground socialist newspaper. He also founded the French-language paper &quot;Le Travail&quot; (on which Phạm Văn Đồng also worked).

After the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the French authorities outlawed the Indochinese Communist Party. Its leaders decided that Giáp should leave Vietnam and go into exile in China. On 3 May 1940 he said farewell to his wife, left Hanoi and crossed the border into China. Giáp&#x27;s wife went to her family home in Vinh, where she was arrested, sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment, and incarcerated in the Hoa Lo Central Prison in Hanoi. In China, Giáp joined up with Hồ Chí Minh, then an adviser to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. Giáp adopted the alias Duong Huai-nan, learned to speak and write Chinese, and studied the strategy and tactics of the Chinese Communist Party.

In September 1940, Vichy France agreed to the Japanese occupation of Vietnam, to &#x27;protect&#x27; Indochina. In May 1941 the Eighth Congress of the Indochinese Communist Party decided to form the Viet Minh; Giáp was made responsible for establishing an intelligence network and organising political bases in the far north of the country. To begin propaganda work among the population, a news-sheet called &quot;Việt Nam Độc Lập&quot; was produced. Giáp wrote many articles for it, and was repeatedly criticised by Ho Chi Minh for the excessive verbosity of his writing style.

=== Military career ===

In 1942, Giáp and about forty men moved back into Vietnam and established themselves in remote caves near the village of Vu Nhai. This and similar small groups in the mountains were the basis of the Viet Minh, the armed wing of the Vietnam Independence League. The local Nung hill people spoke little Vietnamese, so Giáp and his colleagues had to learn local dialects and draw pictures to communicate. When Vichy security patrols approached, they would conceal themselves in a cave under a waterfall, or, at times, in the lands of the Man Trang people.

For the next few years he and his comrades worked steadily to build up a small military force and to win local people over to the communist cause. By the end of 1943 several hundred men and women had joined the Viet Minh. It was in the summer of 1943 that Giáp was told that his wife had been beaten to death by guards in the central prison in Hanoi.
Her sister was guillotined and Giáp&#x27;s daughter died in prison of unknown causes.

In September 1944 the first Revolutionary Party Military Conference was held and it was agreed that the time was now right to take the military struggle forward into a new phase. The formation of the Vietnam Liberation army was proclaimed, with Giáp as its commander. Ho Chi Minh directed him to establish Armed Propaganda Brigades and the first one, consisting of thirty-one men and three women, was formed in December 1944. Named the Tran Hung Dao Platoon after the great Vietnamese hero, it was armed with two revolvers, seventeen rifles, one light machine gun, and fourteen breech-loading flintlocks dating from the Russo-Japanese War.

Ho Chi Minh decided that for propaganda purposes, the Armed Propaganda Unit had to win a military victory within a month of being established, so on 25 December 1944 Giáp led successful attacks against French outposts in the Battles of Khai Phat and Na Ngan. Two French lieutenants were killed and the Vietnamese soldiers in the outposts surrendered. The Viet Minh attackers suffered no casualties. A few weeks later, Giáp was wounded in the leg when his group attacked another outpost at Dong Mu.

Through the first half of 1945, Giáp&#x27;s military position strengthened as the political position of the French and Japanese weakened. On 9 March the Japanese removed the titular French regime and placed the emperor Bảo Đại at the head of a puppet state, the Empire of Vietnam.

By April the Viet Minh had nearly five thousand members, and was able to attack Japanese posts with confidence. Between May and August 1945, the United States, keen to support anti-Japanese forces in mainland Asia, actively supplied and trained Giáp and the Viet Minh. Major Archimedes Patti, in charge of the so-called &#x27;Deer Team&#x27; unit, taught the Viet Minh to use flamethrowers, grenade launchers and machine guns.

In a single month they succeeded in training around 200 hand-picked future leaders of the army they were to oppose a few decades later. Growing stronger, Giáp&#x27;s forces took more territory and captured more towns up until the announcement on 15 August by the Japanese Emperor of his country&#x27;s unconditional surrender to the allies.

On 28 August 1945, Giáp led his men into Hanoi, and on 2 September, Ho Chi Minh declared the independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He formed a new government, with Giáp as Minister of the Interior. Unbeknownst to the Việt Minh, President Harry S. Truman, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Premier Joseph Stalin had already decided the future of postwar Vietnam at a summit meeting at Potsdam. They agreed that the country would be occupied temporarily to get the Japanese out; the northern half would be under the control of the Nationalist Chinese and the southern half under the British.

On 9 September, the Nationalist Chinese forces crossed the border and quickly took control of the north, while on 12 September, the British Indian Army arrived in Saigon. By October French forces had begun to arrive in Vietnam, and the British handed control of the south back to them and in May 1946, an agreement between the French and the Chinese saw the Chinese withdraw from the north and the French move in there as well. Ho Chi Minh and Võ Nguyên Giáp pursued lengthy negotiations with the French, seeking to avoid an all-out war to cement their independence. Giáp led the Vietnamese delegation at the Dalat conference in April 1946, which yielded nothing, and, returning to Hanoi, he was made Minister of Defense. Ho Chi Minh departed for France on 31 May, to negotiate with the French at Fontainebleau, and he remained in France until November.

With Ho in France, Giáp was effectively in charge of the government in Hanoi. Up to then, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had allowed nationalist and other newspapers to publish, but when they began attacking and vilifying Giáp he cracked down on them and closed them all. He also deployed Viet Minh forces against non-communist nationalist troops in the suburbs of Hanoi, and had their leaders arrested, imprisoned, or killed. During this period he also began a relationship with a famous and beautiful dancer, Thuong Huyen, and was seen in public with her at nightclubs. This conduct caused serious concern in the upper ranks of the Party as it was contrary to the very strict and abstemious moral code by which all members were expected to abide. Wanting to protect him, Ho Chi Minh arranged for him to meet a graduate from a well-known family, (1928–2024).

They married in August 1946, and went on to have five children.

==== First Indochina War ====

The tense standoff between the Vietnamese government and the French occupiers escalated dramatically on 23 October when the French commander Argenlieu ordered the cruiser &quot;Suffren&quot; to bombard Haiphong in response to repeated skirmishes with Vietnamese forces as they tried to bring arms and contraband into the port. Around six thousand people were killed, and fourteen thousand wounded in the bombardment. Giáp, acting as de facto president in the absence of Ho Chi Minh, tried to maintain some kind of peace but by the time Ho returned in November, both sides were on a war footing. Local fighting broke out repeatedly and on 27 November, Ho&#x27;s government, concluding that it could not hold Hanoi against the French, retreated up into the northern hills where it had been based two years previously. On 19 December, the Vietnamese government officially declared war on France and fighting erupted all over the country. After this time, detailed information on Giáp&#x27;s personal life becomes much scarcer and in most sources the emphasis is on his military achievements and, later, on his political work.

The first few years of the war involved mostly a low-level, semi-conventional resistance fight against the French occupying forces. Võ Nguyên Giáp first saw real fighting at Nha Trang, when he traveled to south-central Vietnam in January–February 1946, to convey the determination of leaders in Hanoi to resist the French. However, after the Chinese communists reached the northern border of Vietnam in 1949 and the Vietnamese destruction of French posts there, the conflict turned into a conventional war between two armies equipped with modern weapons supplied by the United States and the Soviet Union.

French Union forces included colonial troops from many parts of the former French empire (Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, Laotian, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Vietnamese ethnic minorities), French professional troops and units of the French Foreign Legion. The use of metropolitan recruits (i.e. recruits from France itself) was forbidden by French governments to prevent the war from becoming even more unpopular at home. It was called the &quot;dirty war&quot; (&quot;la sale guerre&quot;) by supporters of the Left in France and intellectuals (including Jean-Paul Sartre) during the Henri Martin affair in 1950.

When it became clear that France was becoming involved in a long drawn-out and so far not very successful war, the French government tried to negotiate an agreement with the Viet Minh. They offered to help set up a national government and promised that they would eventually grant Vietnam its independence. Ho Chi Minh and the other leaders of the Viet Minh did not trust the word of the French and continued the war.

French public opinion continued to move against the war:
# Between 1946 and 1952 many French troops had been killed, wounded, or captured.
# France was attempting to build up her economy after the devastation of the Second World War. The cost of the war had so far been twice what they had received from the United States under the Marshall Plan.
# The war had lasted for seven years and there was still no sign of a clear French victory.
# A growing number of people in France had reached the conclusion that their country did not have any moral justification for being in Vietnam.
# Parts of the French left supported the goals of the Việt Minh to form a socialist state.

While growing stronger in Vietnam, the Việt Minh also expanded the war and lured the French to spread their force to remote areas such as Laos. In December 1953, French military commander General Henri Navarre set up a defensive complex at Ðiện Biên Phủ in the Mường Thanh Valley, disrupting Việt Minh supply lines passing through Laos. He surmised that in an attempt to reestablish the route, Giáp would be forced to organize a mass attack on Ðiện Biên Phủ, thus fighting a conventional battle, in which Navarre could expect to have the advantage.

Giáp took up the French challenge. While the French dug in at their outpost, the Việt Minh were also preparing the battlefield. While diversionary attacks were launched in other areas, Giáp ordered his men to covertly position their artillery by hand. Defying standard military practice, he had his twenty-four 105 mm howitzers placed on the forward slopes of the hills around Dien Bien Phu, in deep, mostly hand-dug emplacements protecting them from French aircraft and counter-battery fire.

With anti-aircraft guns supplied by the Soviet Union, Giáp was able to severely restrict the ability of the French to supply their garrison, forcing them to drop supplies inaccurately from high altitude. Giáp ordered his men to dig a trench system that encircled the French. From the outer trench, other trenches and tunnels were gradually dug inward towards the center. The Viet Minh were now able to move in close to the French troops defending Dien Bien Phu.

When Navarre realized that he was trapped, he appealed for help. The United States was approached and some advisers suggested the use of tactical nuclear weapons against the Viet Minh, but this was never seriously considered. Another suggestion was that conventional air raids would be enough to scatter Giáp&#x27;s troops. U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, however, refused to intervene unless the British and other Western allies agreed. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill declined, claiming that he wanted to wait for the outcome of the peace negotiations taking place in Geneva, before becoming involved in escalating the war.

On 13 March 1954, Giap launched his offensive. For 54 days, the Viet Minh seized position after position, pushing the French until they occupied only a small area of Dien Bien Phu. Colonel Piroth, the artillery commander, blamed himself for the destruction of French artillery superiority. He told his fellow officers that he had been &quot;completely dishonoured&quot; and committed suicide with a hand grenade. General De Castries, French Commander in Dien Bien Phu, was captured alive in his bunker. The French surrendered on 7 May. Their casualties totaled over 2,200 killed, 5,600 wounded, and 11,721 taken prisoner. The following day the French government announced that it intended to withdraw from Vietnam.

Giáp&#x27;s victory over the French was an important inspiration to anti-colonial campaigners around the world, particularly in French colonies, and most particularly in North Africa, not least because many of the troops fighting on the French side in Indochina were from North Africa.

==== Interwar years ====
After the Geneva Peace Accords, Giáp moved back into Hanoi as the Vietnamese government re-established itself. He expanded and modernised the army, re-equipping it with Soviet and Chinese weapons systems. On 7 May 1955, he inaugurated the Vietnamese Maritime Force and on 1 May 1959, the Vietnamese People&#x27;s Air Force. During the late 1950s Giáp served as Minister of Defence, Commander in Chief of the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam, Deputy Prime Minister, and deputy chairman of the Defence Council. In terms of his personal life, he was also able to move back in with his wife, from whom he had been separated for eight years during the war. She was working as a professor of history and social science at that time. Together they raised two boys and two girls. In the little spare time he had, he said in interviews that he occasionally enjoyed playing the piano, as well as reading Goethe, Shakespeare and Tolstoy.

During the late 1950s the top priority of the re-established Vietnamese government was the rapid establishment of a socialist economic order and Communist Party rule. This involved collectivisation of agriculture and central management of all economic production. The process did not go smoothly and it led to food shortages and revolts. At the 10th Plenum of the Communist Party, 27–29 October 1956, Giáp stood in front of the assembled delegates and said:

The departure of the French and the partition of Vietnam meant that the Hanoi government only controlled the north part of the country. In South Vietnam there were still several thousand guerillas, known as Viet Cong, fighting against the government in Saigon. The Party Plenum in 1957 ordered changes to the structure of their units and Giáp was put in charge of implementing them and building their strength to form a solid basis for an insurrection in the South. The 1959 Plenum decided that the time for escalating the armed struggle in the South was right and in July that year Giáp ordered the opening up of the Ho Chi Minh trail to improve supply lines to Viet Cong units.

==== Vietnam War ====

Giáp remained commander in chief of the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam throughout the war against South Vietnam and its allies, the United States, Australia, Thailand, South Korea, and the Philippines. He oversaw the expansion of the PAVN from a small self-defense force into a large conventional army, equipped by its communist allies with considerable amounts of relatively sophisticated weaponry, although that did not usually match the weaponry of the Americans.

Giáp opposed the implementation of the Tết Offensive of 1968, considering focus on guerrilla tactics in the south to be more effective. The best evidence suggests that when it became obvious that Lê Duẩn and Văn Tiến Dũng were going to conduct it anyway, he left Vietnam for medical treatment in Hungary and did not return until after the offensive had begun. Although their attempt to spark a general uprising against the southern government failed disastrously, it was a significant political victory through convincing American politicians and the public that their commitment to South Vietnam could not be open-ended. Giáp later argued that the Tết Offensive was not a &quot;purely military strategy&quot; but part of a &quot;general strategy, an integrated one, at once military, political and diplomatic.&quot;

Peace negotiations between representatives from the United States, South Vietnam, North Vietnam and the Viet Cong began in Paris in January 1969. President Richard Nixon, like President Lyndon B. Johnson before him, was convinced that a U.S. withdrawal was necessary, but four years passed before the last American troops departed.

In October 1972, the negotiators came close to agreeing to a formula to end the conflict. The proposal was that the remaining U.S. troops would withdraw from South Vietnam in exchange for a cease-fire and the return of American prisoners held by Hà Nội. It was also agreed that the governments in North and South Vietnam would remain in power, and reunification would be &quot;carried out step by step through peaceful means&quot;. Although the North&#x27;s &quot;Nguyễn Huệ Offensive&quot; during the spring of 1972 was beaten back with high casualties, the proposal did not require them to leave the South. PAVN would thus be able to maintain a foothold in South Vietnam from which to launch future offensives.

In an effort to put pressure on both North and South Vietnam during the negotiations, President Nixon ordered a series of air raids on Hanoi and Haiphong, codenamed Operation Linebacker II. The operation ended on 29 December 1972, after 12 days with 42 U.S. casualties and over 1,600 North Vietnamese killed. North Vietnam then agreed to sign the Paris Peace Accords that had been proposed in October, although with added conditions favorable to both the U.S. and to North Vietnam. South Vietnam objected, but had little choice but to accept it.

The last U.S. combat troops had left in August 1972. The remaining U.S. military personnel (except for the staff of the Defense Attache&#x27;s Office and the US Embassy&#x27;s Marine guards) completed their withdrawal in March 1973. Despite the agreement, there was no end in fighting. South Vietnamese attempts to regain communist-controlled territory inspired their opponents to change strategy. Communist leaders met in Hanoi in March for a series of meetings to plan for a massive offensive against the South. In June 1973, the U.S. Congress passed the Case–Church Amendment, which prohibited any further U.S. military involvement, and the PAVN supply routes could operate normally without any fear of U.S. bombing.

==== Fall of Saigon ====

The standard view of this period is that after Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s death in September 1969, Giáp lost a power struggle in 1972 shortly after the failed Easter Offensive where he was blamed by the Politburo for the offensive&#x27;s failure. Giáp was recalled to Hanoi where he was replaced as field commander of the PAVN and from then on watched subsequent events from the sidelines, with the glory of victory in 1975 going to the chief of the general staff, General Văn Tiến Dũng. Giáp&#x27;s contribution to the 1975 victory is largely ignored by official Vietnamese accounts.

=== Later life ===

Soon after the fall of Saigon, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was established. In the new government, Giáp was made Deputy Prime Minister in July 1976. In December 1978 he oversaw the successful Cambodian–Vietnamese War which drove the Khmer Rouge from power and ended the Cambodian genocide. In retaliation, Cambodia&#x27;s ally China responded by invading the Cao Bang province of Vietnam in January 1979 and once again Giáp was in overall responsibility for the response, which drove the Chinese out after a month. He finally retired from his post at the Defense Ministry in 1981 and retired from the Politburo in 1982. He remained on the Central Committee and Deputy Prime Minister until he retired in 1991.

Giáp wrote extensively on military theory and strategy. His works include &quot;Big Victory, Great Task&quot;; &quot;People&#x27;s Army, People&#x27;s War&quot;; &quot;Ðiện Biên Phủ&quot;; and &quot;We Will Win&quot;.

In 1995, former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara met Giáp to ask what happened on 4 August 1964 in the second Gulf of Tonkin Incident. &quot;Absolutely nothing&quot;, Giáp replied. Giáp said that the attack on 4 August 1964, had been imaginary.

The final evidence that there had not been any Vietnamese attack against U.S. ships on the night of 4 August 1964 was provided by the release of a slightly sanitized version.

In a 1998 interview, William Westmoreland criticized the battlefield prowess of Giáp, stating, &quot;By his own admission, by early 1969, I think, he had lost, what, a half million soldiers? He reported this. Now such a disregard for human life may make a formidable adversary, but it does not make a military genius. An American commander losing men like that would hardly have lasted more than a few weeks.&quot;
American historian Derek Frisby criticized Westmoreland&#x27;s view, which he said reflected a failure in understanding Giáp&#x27;s core philosophy of &quot;revolutionary war&quot;. According to Frisby, &quot;Giap understood that protracted warfare would cost many lives but that did not always translate into winning or losing the war. In the final analysis, Giap won the war despite losing many battles, and as long as the army survived to fight another day, the idea of Vietnam lived in the hearts of the people who would support it, and that is the essence of &#x27;revolutionary war&#x27;.&quot; Nixon&#x27;s Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said: &quot;We fought a military war; our opponents fought a political one. We sought physical attrition; our opponents aimed for our psychological exhaustion. In the process we lost sight of one of the cardinal maxims of guerrilla war: the guerrilla wins if he does not lose. The conventional army loses if it does not win. The North Vietnamese used their armed forces the way a bull-fighter uses his cape — to keep us lunging in areas of marginal political importance.&quot;

Compared to other North Vietnamese leaders who favored an all-out quick offensive in the South to bring victory in a short period like Lê Duẩn, Giáp was relatively cautious, and he believed in a more protracted military struggle, which would not be as costly in manpower. However, he was willing to spend the lives of his soldiers with what American commanders would regard as reckless abandon, if that was what it took to win the war. Giáp explained to American journalist Stanley Karnow in 1990:

&quot;We were not strong enough to drive out a half-million American troops, that wasn&#x27;t our aim. Our intention was to break the will of the American government to continue the war. Westmoreland was wrong to expect that his superior firepower would grind us down. If we had focused on the balance of forces, we would have been defeated in two hours. We were waging a people&#x27;s war . . . America&#x27;s sophisticated arms, electronic devices and all the rest were to no avail in the end. In war there are two factors━human beings and weapons. Ultimately, though, human beings are the decisive factor.&quot;

After the conclusion of the Vietnam War, Giáp extensively wrote about his military strategy. The subsequent passage from one of his books explains his method of defeating a powerful foreign enemy:&quot;The war of liberation is a protracted war and a hard war in which we must rely mainly on ourselves—for we are strong politically but weak materially, while the enemy is very weak politically but stronger materially.&quot;

&quot;Guerrilla warfare is a means of fighting a revolutionary war that relies on the heroic spirit to triumph over modern weapons. It is the means whereby the people of a weak, badly equipped country can stand up against an aggressive army possessing better equipment and techniques.&quot;

&quot;The correct tactics for a protracted revolutionary war are to wage guerrilla warfare, to advance from guerrilla warfare to regular warfare and then closely combine these two forms of war; to develop from guerrilla to mobile and then to siege warfare.&quot;

&quot;Accumulate a thousand small victories to turn into one great success.&quot;In 2009, Giáp became a prominent critic of bauxite mining in Vietnam following government plans to open large areas of the Central Highlands to the practice. Giáp supported a 1980s study in which experts advised against mining that damaged the environment and national security.

=== Death and legacy ===

On 4 October 2013, the Communist Party of Vietnam and government officials announced that Võ Nguyên Giáp had died, aged 102, at 18:09 local time, at Central Military Hospital 108 in Hanoi. He was given a state funeral on 12–13 October, and his body was laid in state at the national morgue in Hanoi until his burial in his home province of Quảng Bình. After his death, several cities in Vietnam renamed some of their most prominent streets after him.

<doc id="66051" wikidata="Q189955" url="?curid=66051" title="List of Norwegian monarchs">
<text>The list of Norwegian monarchs ( or &quot;kongerekka&quot;) begins in 872: the traditional dating of the Battle of Hafrsfjord, after which victorious King Harald Fairhair merged several petty kingdoms into that of his father. Named after the homonymous geographical region, Harald&#x27;s realm was later to be known as the Kingdom of Norway.

Traditionally established in 872 and existing continuously for over 1,100 years, the Kingdom of Norway is one of the oldest states of Europe: King Harald V, who has reigned since 1991, is the 64th monarch according to the official list. During interregna, Norway has been ruled by variously titled regents.

Several royal dynasties have possessed the Throne of the Kingdom of Norway: the more prominent include the Fairhair dynasty (872–970), the House of Sverre (1184–1319), the House of Oldenburg (1450–1481, 1483–1533, 1537–1818, and from 1905),including branches Holstein-Gottorp (1814–1818) and Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (from 1905), and the House of Bernadotte (1818-1905). During the civil war era (1130–1240), several pretenders fought each other, and as a consequence, some rulers from this era are not traditionally considered lawful kings and are usually omitted from lists of monarchs. Between 1319 and 1905, Norway was at times part of various unions with neighbouring countries, like The First Swedish–Norwegian union, The Kalmar Union, Denmark-Norway and Sweden–Norway.

Kings of Norway used many additional titles between 1450 and 1905, such as King of the Wends, King of the Goths, Duke of Schleswig, Duke of Holstein, Prince of Rügen, and Count of Oldenburg. They called themselves &quot;Konge til Norge&quot; (&quot;King of Norway&quot;), usually with the style &quot;His Royal Majesty&quot;. With the introduction of constitutional monarchy in 1814, the traditional style &quot;by the Grace of God&quot; was extended to &quot;by the Grace of God and the Constitution of the Kingdom&quot;, but was only briefly in use. The last king to use the &quot;by the grace of God&quot; style was Haakon VII, who died in 1957. The King&#x27;s title today is formally &quot;Norges Konge&quot; (&quot;Norway&#x27;s King&quot;), with the style &quot;His Majesty&quot;.

== Fairhair dynasty ==

Besides becoming sole king after his father Harold&#x27;s death, Eric Bloodaxe was king jointly with his father for three years before the latter&#x27;s death. After Harald&#x27;s death, Eric ruled as &quot;overking&quot; of his brothers, who also held status as kings and had control over certain regions. Harald Greycloak also ruled as &quot;overking&quot; of his brothers. All dates for the kings of the Fairhair dynasty are approximate and/or just scholarly estimates. Slight differences might therefore occur between different sources. The following table uses the dates given in &quot;Norsk biografisk leksikon&quot;/&quot;Store norske leksikon&quot;.
== House of Gorm/Earl of Lade ==

The Danish king Harald Bluetooth had himself hailed as king of Norway after the Battle of Fitjar ( 961). Besides gaining direct control of Viken in south-eastern Norway, he let Harald Greycloak rule the rest of Norway as king, nominally under himself. Harald Bluetooth later switched his support to Harald Greycloak&#x27;s rival, Haakon Sigurdsson, Earl of Lade, who eventually captured Harald Greycloak&#x27;s kingdom. Haakon thereafter ruled Norway (except Viken), at first nominally under Harald. All dates are estimates and subject to interpretation. Haakon is generally held as the ruler of Norway from 970 to 995.
== Fairhair dynasty (restored) ==
== House of Gorm/Earls of Lade (restored) ==

After the Battle of Svolder, the Danes recaptured Norway under Sweyn Forkbeard. As before, the Danes controlled the petty kingdoms of Viken as vassals, while the two Earls of Lade, Eric Haakonsson and Sweyn Haakonsson, ruled Western Norway and Trøndelag, nominally as earls under Sweyn. Eric is generally held as the de facto ruler of Norway from 1000 to 1015, together with his brother Sweyn, a lesser known figure, with whom he shared his power.
== St. Olav dynasty ==

== House of Gorm/Earl of Lade (restored, second time) ==

== St. Olav dynasty (restored) ==

== Hardrada dynasty ==

== Gille dynasty ==

== Hardrada dynasty (restored), cognatic branch ==

== Sverre dynasty ==

== House of Godwin (Gille dynasty, cognatic branch) ==

== Sverre dynasty (restored) ==

== House of Bjälbo ==

== House of Estridsen ==

== House of Griffin ==

== House of Palatinate-Neumarkt ==

== House of Bonde ==

== House of Oldenburg ==

== House of Holstein-Gottorp ==

== House of Bernadotte ==
== House of Glücksburg ==

Carl of Denmark was approved in a referendum as King of Norway on 13 November 1905 and then elected by the Storting on 18 November 1905. He took the regnal name Haakon VII. With him the House of Oldenburg, in the form of its junior branch, resumed occupancy of the throne of Norway.

<text>Harald Greycloak (Old Norse: &quot;Haraldr gráfeldr&quot;, lit. &quot;Harald Grey-hide&quot;; Norwegian: ; Danish: ; c. 935 – c. 970) was a king of Norway from the Fairhair dynasty.

Harald acquired his nickname &quot;Gray-hide&quot; after an encounter with the crew of an Icelandic merchant ship which carried a large load of &quot;vararfeldir&quot;, a type of faux fur made from sheep&#x27;s wool. The Icelanders were having trouble selling their faux furs so when the king asked them if they would make a present to him of one of the furs, which happened to be grey, the sailors did not hesitate and the king immediately used it as a cloak. This set an instant fashion trend and before long the Icelanders had sold their entire load of previously unsalable furs to the king&#x27;s men and the locals. Harald was ever after known as Harald &quot;Gray-hide&quot;.

Harald was the son of Eric Bloodaxe and a grandson of Harald Fairhair. His mother was Gunnhild, the sister of King Harald Bluetooth.

After his father&#x27;s death in 954, Harald and his brothers allied with their uncle, King Harald Bluetooth, against their half-uncle King Haakon the Good. They fought several battles against King Haakon including the Battle of Rastarkalv near the island of Frei in 955 and the Battle of Fitjar in 961.

After King Haakon&#x27;s death at Fitjar, Harald and his brothers became kings of Norway, but they had little authority outside Western Norway. Harald, by being the oldest, was the most powerful of the brothers. In 961, their uncle King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark traveled to Norway and declared Harald Greycloak to be his vassal king in Norway.

Harald moved to strengthen his rule by killing the local rulers including Sigurd Haakonsson, Tryggve Olafsson and Gudrød Bjørnsson. Harald Greycloak thus took power over the country up to and including Hålogaland. Harald established control over the trade route along the Norwegian coast. He also undertook a Viking expedition to Bjarmaland, today the area of Arkhangelsk in northern Russia. Harald soon became less dependent on support from Harald Bluetooth.

In 970, he was tricked into coming to Denmark and killed in Hals in the Limfjord in a plot planned by Sigurd Haakonsson&#x27;s son Haakon, who had become an ally of Harald Bluetooth. Haakon Sigurdsson had become the jarl of Lade after his own father was killed by Harald Greycloak&#x27;s men in the autumn of 962. The surviving brothers of Harald Greyhide fled the country after his death. With the death of Harald Greycloak, King Harald Bluetooth won back power over Norway and he supported Haakon Sigurdsson as his vassal king.

<doc id="66054" wikidata="Q203647" url="?curid=66054" title="Harald Hardrada">
<text>Harald Sigurdsson (; – 25 September 1066), also known as Harald III of Norway and given the epithet Hardrada in the sagas, was King of Norway from 1046 to 1066. He unsuccessfully claimed the Danish throne until 1064 and the English throne in 1066. Before becoming king, Harald spent 15 years in exile as a mercenary and military commander in Kievan Rus&#x27; and chief of the Varangian Guard in the Byzantine Empire. In his chronicle, Adam of Bremen called him the &quot;Thunderbolt of the North&quot;.

In 1030, the fifteen-year-old Harald fought in the Battle of Stiklestad with his half-brother Olaf Haraldsson. Olaf sought to reclaim the Norwegian throne, which he had lost to Danish king Cnut two years prior. Olaf and Harald were defeated by forces loyal to Cnut, and Harald was forced into exile to Kievan Rus&#x27;. Thereafter, he was in the army of Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise, becoming captain, until he moved on to Constantinople with his companions around 1034. In Constantinople, he rose quickly to become the commander of the Byzantine Varangian Guard, seeing action on the Mediterranean Sea, in Asia Minor, Sicily, possibly in the Holy Land, Bulgaria and in Constantinople itself, where he became involved in the imperial dynastic disputes. Harald amassed wealth whilst in the Byzantine Empire, which he shipped to Yaroslav in Kievan Rus&#x27; for safekeeping. In 1042, he left the Byzantine Empire, returning to Kievan Rus&#x27; to prepare to reclaim the Norwegian throne. In his absence the Norwegian throne had been restored from the Danes to Olaf&#x27;s illegitimate son Magnus the Good.

In 1046, Harald joined forces with Magnus&#x27;s rival in Denmark, the pretender Sweyn II of Denmark, raiding the Danish coast. Magnus, unwilling to fight his uncle, agreed to share the kingship with Harald, since Harald in turn would share his wealth with him. The co-rule ended abruptly the next year as Magnus died: Harald became the sole ruler of Norway. Domestically, Harald crushed opposition, and outlined the unification of Norway. Harald&#x27;s reign was one of relative peace and stability, and he instituted a coin economy and foreign trade. Seeking to restore Cnut&#x27;s &quot;North Sea Empire&quot;, Harald claimed the Danish throne, and spent nearly every year until 1064 raiding the Danish coast and fighting his former ally, Sweyn. Although the campaigns were successful, he was never able to conquer Denmark.

Not long after Harald had renounced his claim to Denmark, the former Earl of Northumbria, Tostig Godwinson, brother of English king Harold Godwinson, pledged his allegiance to Harald, inviting him to claim the English throne. Harald assented, invading northern England with 10,000 troops and 300 longships in September 1066, defeating the English regional forces of Northumbria and Mercia in the Battle of Fulford near York on 20 September. Harald was defeated and killed in a surprise attack by Harold Godwinson&#x27;s forces in the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September, which wiped out his army. Historians often consider Harald&#x27;s death the end of the Viking Age.

==Epithets==
Harald&#x27;s most famous epithet is Old Norse &quot;harðráði&quot;, which has been translated variously as &#x27;hard in counsel&#x27;, &#x27;tyrannical&#x27;, &#x27;tyrant&#x27;, &#x27;hard-ruler&#x27;, &#x27;ruthless&#x27;, &#x27;savage in counsel&#x27;, &#x27;tough&#x27;, and &#x27;severe&#x27;. While Judith Jesch has argued for &#x27;severe&#x27; as the best translation, Alison Finlay and Anthony Faulkes prefer &#x27;resolute&#x27;. &quot;Harðráði&quot; has traditionally been Anglicised as &#x27;Hardrada&#x27;, though Judith Jesch characterises this form as &#x27;a bastard Anglicisation of the original epithet in an oblique case&#x27;. This epithet predominates in the later Icelandic saga-tradition.

However, in a number of independent sources associated with the British Isles, mostly earlier than the Icelandic sagas, Harald is given epithets deriving from Old Norse &quot;hárfagri&quot; (literally &#x27;hair-beautiful&#x27;). These sources include:
* Manuscript D of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (&#x27;Harold Harfagera&#x27;, under the year 1066) and the related histories by Orderic Vitalis (&#x27;Harafagh&#x27;, re events in 1066), John of Worcester (&#x27;Harvagra&#x27;, s.aa. 1066 and 1098), and William of Malmesbury (&quot;Gesta regum Anglorum&quot;, &#x27;Harvagre&#x27;, regarding 1066).
* Marianus Scotus of Mainz (&#x27;Arbach&#x27;, d. 1082/1083).
* The &quot;Life&quot; of Gruffydd ap Cynan (&#x27;Haralld Harfagyr&#x27;, later twelfth century).
In Icelandic sagas the name &quot;Harald Fairhair&quot; is more famously associated with an earlier Norwegian king, and twentieth-century historians assumed that the name was attached to Harald Hardrada in error by Insular historians. However, recognising the independence of some of the Insular sources, historians have since favoured the idea that Harald Hardrada was widely known as Harald Fairhair, and indeed now doubt that the earlier Harald Fairhair existed in any form resembling the later saga-accounts.

Sverrir Jakobsson has suggested that &#x27;fairhair&#x27; &#x27;might be the name by which King Harald wished himself to be known. It must have been his opponents who gave him the epithet &quot;severe&quot; (ON. &quot;harðráði&quot;), by which he is generally known in thirteenth-century Old Norse kings&#x27; sagas&#x27;.

==Early life==

Harald was born in Ringerike, Norway, in 1015 (or possibly 1016) to Åsta Gudbrandsdatter and her second husband Sigurd Syr. Sigurd was a petty king of Ringerike, and among the strongest and wealthiest chieftains in the Uplands. Through his mother Åsta, Harald was the youngest of three half-brothers to King Olaf Haraldsson (later Saint Olaf). In his youth, Harald displayed traits of a typical rebel with big ambitions, and admired Olaf as his role model. He thus differed from his two older brothers, who were more similar to their father, down-to-earth and mostly concerned with maintaining the farm.

The Icelandic sagas, in particular Snorri Sturluson in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, claim that Sigurd, like Olaf&#x27;s father, was a great-grandson of King Harald Fairhair in the male line. Most modern scholars believe that the ancestors attributed to Harald Hardrada&#x27;s father, along with other parts of the Fairhair genealogy, are inventions reflecting the political and social expectations of the time of the authors (around two centuries after Harald Hardrada&#x27;s lifetime) rather than historical reality. Harald Hardrada&#x27;s alleged descent from Harald Fairhair is not mentioned and played no part during Harald Hardrada&#x27;s own time, which seems odd considering that it would have provided significant legitimacy in connection with his claim to the Norwegian throne.

Following a revolt in 1028, Harald&#x27;s brother Olaf was forced into exile until he returned to Norway in early 1030. On hearing news of Olaf&#x27;s planned return, Harald gathered 600 men from the Uplands to meet Olaf and his men upon their arrival in the east of Norway. After a friendly welcome, Olaf went on to gather an army and eventually fight in the Battle of Stiklestad on 29 July 1030, in which Harald took part on his brother&#x27;s side. The battle was part of an attempt to restore Olaf to the Norwegian throne, which had been captured by the Danish king Cnut the Great (Canute). The battle resulted in defeat for the brothers at the hands of those Norwegians who were loyal to Cnut, and Olaf was killed while Harald was badly wounded. Harald was nonetheless remarked to have shown considerable military talent during the battle.

==Exile in the East==

===To Kievan Rus&#x27;===
After the defeat at the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald managed to escape with the aid of Rögnvald Brusason (later Earl of Orkney) to a remote farm in Eastern Norway. He stayed there for some time to heal his wounds, and thereafter (possibly up to a month later) journeyed north over the mountains to Sweden. A year after the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald arrived in Kievan Rus&#x27; (referred to in the sagas as &quot;Garðaríki&quot; or &quot;Svíþjóð hin mikla&quot;). He likely spent at least part of his time in the town of Staraya Ladoga (&quot;Aldeigjuborg&quot;), arriving there in the first half of 1031. Harald and his men were welcomed by Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise, whose wife Ingegerd was a distant relative of Harald. Badly in need of military leaders, Yaroslav recognised a military potential in Harald and made him a captain of his forces. Harald&#x27;s brother Olaf Haraldsson had previously been in exile to Yaroslav following the revolt in 1028, and &quot;Morkinskinna&quot; says that Yaroslav embraced Harald first and foremost because he was the brother of Olaf. Harald took part in Yaroslav&#x27;s campaign against the Poles in 1031, and possibly also fought against other 1030s Kievan enemies and rivals such as the Chudes in Estonia, and the Byzantines, as well as the Pechenegs and other steppe nomad people.

===In Byzantine service===
After a few years in Kievan Rus&#x27;, Harald and his force of around 500 men moved on south to Constantinople (&quot;Miklagard&quot;), the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire (also known todaybut not to contemporariesas the Byzantine Empire), probably in 1033 or 1034, where they joined the Varangian Guard. Although the &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot; maintains that Harald at first sought to keep his royal identity a secret, most sources agree that Harald and his men&#x27;s reputation was well known in the east at the time. While the Varangian Guard was primarily meant to function as the emperor&#x27;s bodyguard, Harald was found fighting on &quot;nearly every frontier&quot; of the empire. He first saw action in campaigns against Arab pirates in the Mediterranean Sea, and then in inland towns in Asia Minor / Anatolia that had supported the pirates. By this time, he had, according to Snorri Sturluson (a 12th-century Icelandic historian, poet, and politician), become the &quot;leader over all the Varangians&quot;. By 1035, the Byzantines had pushed the Arabs out of Asia Minor to the east and southeast, and Harald took part in campaigns that went as far east as the Tigris River and Euphrates River in Mesopotamia, where according to his skald (poet) Þjóðólfr Arnórsson (recounted in the sagas) he participated in the capture of eighty Arab strongholds, a number which historians Sigfus Blöndal and Benedikt Benedikz see no particular reason to question. Although not holding independent command of an army as the sagas imply, it is not unlikely that King Harald and the Varangians at times could have been sent off to capture a castle or town. During the first four years of the reign of Byzantine Emperor Michael IV the Paphlagonian, Harald probably also fought in campaigns against the Pechenegs.

Thereafter, Harald is reported in the sagas to have gone to Jerusalem and fought in battles in the area. Although the sagas place this after his expedition to Sicily, historian Kelly DeVries has questioned that chronology. Whether his trip was of a military or peaceful nature would depend on whether it took place before or after the 1036 peace treaty between Michael IV and the Muslim Fatimid Caliph Ma&#x27;ad al-Mustansir Billah (in reality the Caliph&#x27;s mother, originally a Byzantine Christian, since the Caliph was a minor), although it is considered unlikely to have been made before. Modern historians have speculated that Harald may have been in a party sent to escort pilgrims to Jerusalem (possibly including members of the Imperial family) following the peace agreement, as it was also agreed that the Byzantines were allowed to repair the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Furthermore, this may in turn have presented Harald with opportunities to fight against bandits who preyed on Christian pilgrims.

In 1038, Harald joined the Byzantines in their expedition to Sicily, in George Maniakes&#x27;s (the sagas&#x27; &quot;Gyrge&quot;) attempt to reconquer the island from the Muslim Saracens, who had established the Emirate of Sicily on the island. During the campaign, Harald fought alongside Norman mercenaries such as William Iron Arm. According to Snorri Sturluson, Harald captured four towns on Sicily. In 1041, when the Byzantine expedition to Sicily was over, a Lombard-Norman revolt erupted in southern Italy, and Harald led the Varangian Guard in multiple battles. Harald fought with the Catepan of Italy, Michael Dokeianos with initial success, but the Normans, led by their former ally William Iron Arm, defeated the Byzantines in the Battle of Olivento in March, and in the Battle of Montemaggiore in May. After the defeat, Harald and the Varangian Guard were called back to Constantinople, following Maniakes&#x27;s imprisonment by the emperor and the onset of other more pressing issues. Harald and the Varangians were thereafter sent to fight in the southeastern European frontier in Bulgaria, where they arrived in late 1041. There, he fought in the army of Emperor Michael IV in the Battle of Ostrovo of the 1041 campaign against the Bulgarian uprising led by Peter Delyan, which later gained Harald the nickname the &quot;Bulgar-burner&quot; (&quot;Bolgara brennir&quot;) by his skald.

Harald was not affected by Maniakes&#x27;s conflict with Emperor Michael IV, and received honours and respect upon his return to Constantinople. In a Greek book written in the 1070s, the &quot;Strategikon of Kekaumenos&quot;, Araltes (i.e. Harald) is said to have won the favour of the emperor. The book says that the Byzantine emperor first appointed him &quot;manglabites&quot; (possibly identified with the title &quot;protospatharios&quot;), a soldier of the imperial guard, after the Sicilian campaign. Following the campaign against the Bulgarians, in which Harald again served with distinction, he received the rank while at Mosynopolis of &quot;spatharokandidatos&quot;, identified by DeVries as a promotion to the possibly third highest Byzantine rank, but by Mikhail Bibikov as a lesser rank than &quot;protospatharios&quot; that was ordinarily awarded to foreign allies to the emperor. The &quot;Strategikon&quot; indicates that the ranks awarded to Harald were rather low, since Harald reportedly was &quot;not angry for just having been appointed to &quot;manglabites&quot; or &quot;spatharokandidatos&quot;&quot;. According to his skald Þjóðólfr Arnórsson, Harald had participated in eighteen greater battles during his Byzantine service. Harald&#x27;s favour at the imperial court quickly declined after the death of Michael IV in December 1041, which was followed by conflicts between the new emperor Michael V and the powerful empress Zoe.

During the turmoil, Harald was arrested and imprisoned, but the sources disagree on the grounds. The sagas state that Harald was arrested for defrauding the emperor of his treasure, as well as for requesting marriage with an apparently fictional niece or granddaughter of Zoe, called Maria (his suit supposedly being turned down by the empress because she wanted to marry Harald herself). William of Malmesbury states that Harald was arrested for defiling a noble woman, while according to Saxo Grammaticus he was imprisoned for murder. DeVries suggests that the new emperor may have feared Harald because of his loyalty to the previous emperor. The sources also disagree on how Harald got out of prison, but he may have been helped by someone outside to escape in the midst of the revolt that had begun against the new emperor. While some of the Varangians helped guard the emperor, Harald became the leader of the Varangians who supported the revolt. The emperor was in the end dragged out of his sanctuary, blinded and exiled to a monastery, and the sagas claim that it was Harald himself who blinded Michael V (or at least claimed to have done so).

===Back to Kievan Rus&#x27;===

Harald became extremely rich during his time in the east, and secured the wealth collected in Constantinople by shipments to Kievan Rus&#x27; for safekeeping (with Yaroslav the Wise acting as safekeeper for his fortune). The sagas note that aside from the significant spoils of battle he had retained, he had participated three times in &quot;polutasvarf&quot; (loosely translated as &quot;palace-plunder&quot;), a term which implies either the pillaging of the palace exchequer on the death of the emperor, or perhaps the disbursement of funds to the Varangians by the new emperor in order to ensure their loyalty. It is likely that the money Harald made while serving in Constantinople allowed him to fund his claim for the crown of Norway. If he participated in &quot;polutasvarf&quot; three times, these occasions must have been the deaths of Romanos III, Michael IV, and Michael V, in which Harald would have opportunities, beyond his legitimate revenues, to carry off immense wealth.

After Zoe had been restored to the throne in June 1042 together with Constantine IX, Harald requested to be allowed to return to Norway. Although Zoe refused to allow this, Harald managed to escape into the Bosphorus with two ships and some loyal followers. Although the second ship was destroyed by the Byzantine cross-strait iron chains, Harald&#x27;s ship sailed safely into the Black Sea after successfully manoeuvring over the barrier. Despite this, Kekaumenos lauds the &quot;loyalty and love&quot; Harald had for the empire, which he reportedly maintained even after he returned to Norway and became king. Following his escape from Constantinople, Harald arrived back in Kievan Rus&#x27; later in 1042. During his second stay there, he married Elisabeth (referred to in Scandinavian sources as Ellisif), daughter of Yaroslav the Wise and granddaughter of the Swedish king Olof Skötkonung. Shortly after Harald&#x27;s arrival in Kiev, Yaroslav attacked Constantinople, and it is considered likely that Harald provided him with valuable information about the state of the empire.

It is possible that the marriage with Elisiv had been agreed to already during Harald&#x27;s first time in Rus&#x27;, or that they at least had been acquainted. During his service in the Byzantine Empire, Harald composed a love poem which included the verse &quot;Yet the goddess in Gardarike / will not accept my gold rings&quot; (whom Snorri Sturluson identifies with Elisiv), although &quot;Morkinskinna&quot; claims that Harald had to remind Yaroslav of the promised marriage when he returned to Kiev. According to the same source, Harald had spoken with Yaroslav during his first time in Rus&#x27;, requesting to marry Elisiv, only to be rejected because he was not yet wealthy enough. It is in any case significant that Harald was allowed to marry the daughter of Yaroslav, since his other children were married to figures such as Henry I of France, Andrew I of Hungary and the daughter of Constantine IX.

==King of Norway==

===Return to Scandinavia===
Seeking to regain for himself the kingdom lost by his half-brother Olaf Haraldsson, Harald began his journey westwards in early 1045, departing from Novgorod (&quot;Holmgard&quot;) to Staraya Ladoga (&quot;Aldeigjuborg&quot;) where he obtained a ship. His journey went through Lake Ladoga, down the Neva River, and then into the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea. He arrived in Sigtuna in Sweden, probably at the end of 1045 or in early 1046. When he arrived in Sweden, according to the skald Tjodolv Arnorsson, his ship was unbalanced by its heavy load of gold. In Harald&#x27;s absence, the throne of Norway had been restored to Magnus the Good, an illegitimate son of Olaf. Harald may actually have known this, and it could have been the reason why Harald wanted to return to Norway in the first place. Since Cnut the Great&#x27;s sons had chosen to abandon Norway and instead fight over England, and his sons and successors Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut had died young, Magnus&#x27;s position as king had been secured. No domestic threats or insurrections are recorded to have occurred during his eleven-year reign. After the death of Harthacnut, which had left the Danish throne vacant, Magnus had in addition been selected to be the king of Denmark, and managed to defeat the Danish royal pretender Sweyn Estridsson.
Having heard of Sweyn&#x27;s defeat by Magnus, Harald met up with his fellow exile in Sweden (who was also his nephew), as well as with the Swedish king Anund Jacob, and the three joined forces against Magnus. Their first military exploit consisted of raiding the Danish coast. The purpose of that was to impress the natives by demonstrating that Magnus offered them no protection, and thus leading them to submit to Harald and Sweyn. Learning about their actions, Magnus knew that their next target would be Norway. Harald may have planned to be taken as king of his father&#x27;s petty kingdom, and thereafter claim the rest of the country. In any case, the people were unwilling to turn against Magnus, and on hearing news of Harald&#x27;s schemes, Magnus (abroad at the time) went home to Norway with his entire army. Instead of going to war, Magnus&#x27;s advisors recommended the young king not fight his uncle, and a compromise was reached in 1046 in which Harald would rule Norway (not Denmark) jointly with Magnus (although Magnus would have precedence). Notably, Harald also had to agree to share half of his wealth with Magnus, who at the time was effectively bankrupt and badly in need of funds. During their short co-rule, Harald and Magnus had separate courts and kept to themselves, and their only recorded meetings nearly ended in physical clashes.

In 1047, Magnus and Harald went to Denmark with their leidang forces. Later that year in Jylland, less than a year into their co-rule, Magnus died without an heir. Before his death, he had decided that Sweyn was to inherit Denmark and Harald to inherit Norway. On hearing the news of Magnus&#x27;s death, Harald quickly gathered the local leaders in Norway and declared himself king of Norway as well as of Denmark. Although Magnus had appointed Sweyn his successor as king of Denmark, Harald immediately announced his plans to gather an army and oust his former ally from the country. In response, the army and the chieftains, headed by Einar Thambarskelfir, opposed any plans of invading Denmark. Although Harald himself objected to bringing the body of Magnus back to Norway, the Norwegian army prepared to transport his body to Nidaros (now Trondheim), where they buried him next to Saint Olaf in late 1047. Einar, an opponent of Harald, claimed that &quot;to follow Magnus dead was better than to follow any other king alive&quot;.

Under Harald&#x27;s rule, Norway introduced a royal monopoly on the minting of coins. The coins minted under Harald&#x27;s rule appear to have been accepted as a commonly used currency (as opposed to continued use of primarily foreign-minted coins). Minting of coins likely provided a substantial part of Harald&#x27;s annual revenues. Minting of coinage collapsed in Norway in the late 14th century.

===Invasions of Denmark===
Harald also wanted to re-establish Magnus&#x27;s rule over Denmark, and in the long term probably sought to restore Cnut the Great&#x27;s &quot;North Sea Empire&quot; in its entirety. While his first proposal to invade Denmark fell through, the next year Harald embarked on what would turn into constant warfare against Sweyn, from 1048 almost yearly until 1064. Similar to his campaigns (then together with Sweyn) against Magnus&#x27;s rule in Denmark, most of his campaigns against Sweyn consisted of swift and violent raids on the Danish coasts. In 1048, he plundered Jutland, and in 1049 he pillaged and burned Hedeby, at the time the most important Danish trade center, and one of the best protected and most populous towns in Scandinavia. Hedeby as a civil town never recovered from Harald&#x27;s destruction, and was left completely desolate when what remained was looted by Slavic tribes in 1066. One of two conventional battles was set to be fought between the two kings later the same year, but, according to Saxo Grammaticus, Sweyn&#x27;s smaller army was so frightened when approached by the Norwegians that they chose to jump in the water trying to escape; most drowned. Although Harald was victorious in most of the engagements, he was never successful in occupying Denmark.
The second, more significant battle, a naval encounter, was the Battle of Niså on 9 August 1062. As Harald had not been able to conquer Denmark despite his raids, he wanted to win a decisive victory over Sweyn. He eventually set out from Norway with a great army and a fleet of around 300 ships. Sweyn had also prepared for the battle, which had been preassigned a time and place. Sweyn did not appear at the agreed time, and Harald thus sent home his non-professional soldiers (&quot;bóndaherrinn&quot;), which had made up half of his forces. When the dismissed ships were out of reach, Sweyn&#x27;s fleet finally appeared, possibly also with 300 ships. The battle resulted in great bloodshed as Harald defeated the Danes (70 Danish ships were reportedly left &quot;empty&quot;), but many ships and men managed to escape, including Sweyn. During the battle, Harald actively shot with his bow, like most others in the early phase of the battle.

Fatigue and the huge cost of the indecisive battles eventually led Harald to seek peace with Sweyn, and in 1064 (or 1065 according to &quot;Morkinskinna&quot;) the two kings agreed on an unconditional peace agreement. By the agreement, they retained their respective kingdoms with the former boundaries, and there would be no payments of reparations. In the subsequent winter of 1065, Harald travelled through his realm and accused the farmers of withholding taxes from him. In response, he acted with brutality, and had people maimed and killed as a warning to those who disobeyed him. Harald maintained control of his nation through the use of his hird, a private standing army maintained by Norwegian lords. Harald&#x27;s contribution to the strengthening of Norway&#x27;s monarchy was the enforcement of a policy that only the king could retain a hird, thus centralising power away from local warlords.

===Domestic opposition===
According to historian Knut Helle, Harald completed the first phase of what he has termed the &quot;national territorial unification of Norway&quot;. Having forced his way to the kingship, Harald would have to convince the aristocracy that he was the right person to rule Norway alone. To establish domestic alliances, he married Tora Torbergsdatter of one of the most powerful Norwegian families. The primary opposition to Harald&#x27;s rule would be the descendants of Haakon Sigurdsson, from the powerful dynasty of Earls of Lade who had controlled Northern Norway and Trøndelag with much autonomy under the Norwegian king. Haakon had even ruled the whole of Norway (nominally under the Danish king) from 975 until 995, when he was killed during the takeover by Olaf Tryggvasson. Even after Haakon&#x27;s death, his offspring held a certain degree of sovereignty in the north, and by Harald&#x27;s early reign the family was headed by Einar Thambarskelfir, who was married to Haakon&#x27;s daughter. While the family had maintained good relations with Magnus, Harald&#x27;s absolutism and consolidation of the kingship soon led to conflict with Einar.

It was from his power-struggle with the Norwegian aristocracy that Harald got himself the reputation that gave him the nickname &quot;Hardrada&quot;, or &quot;the hard ruler&quot;. Although the relationship between Harald and Einar was poor from the start, confrontation did not occur before Harald went north to his court in Nidaros. One time in Nidaros, Einar arrived at Harald&#x27;s court, and in a display of power was accompanied by &quot;eight or nine longships and almost five hundred men&quot;, obviously seeking confrontation. Harald was not provoked by the incident. Although the sources differ on the circumstances, the next event nonetheless led to the murder of Einar by Harald&#x27;s men, which threatened to throw Norway into a state of civil war. Although the remaining descendants of Haakon Sigurdsson considered rebellion against the king, Harald eventually managed to negotiate peace with them, and secured the family&#x27;s submission for the remainder of his reign. By the death of Einar and his son around 1050, the Earls of Lade had outplayed their role as a base of opposition, and Trøndelag was definitely subordinated to Harald&#x27;s national kingdom.

Before the Battle of Niså, Harald had been joined by Haakon Ivarsson, who distinguished himself in the battle and gained Harald&#x27;s favour. Harald reportedly even considered giving Haakon the title of Earl, and Haakon was greatly upset when Harald later backed down from his promise. With a strong hold over the Uplands, Haakon was additionally given the earldom of Värmland by the Swedish king Stenkil. In early 1064, Haakon entered the Uplands and collected their taxes, the region thus effectively threatened to renounce their loyalty to Harald in response. The revolt of Haakon and the farmers in the Uplands may have been the main reason why Harald finally had been willing to enter a peace agreement with Sweyn Estridsson. After the agreement, Harald went to Oslo and sent tax collectors to the Uplands, only to find that the farmers would withhold their taxes until Haakon arrived. In response, Harald entered Sweden with an army and quickly defeated Haakon. Still facing opposition from the farmers, Harald embarked on a campaign to crush the areas that had withheld their taxes. Due to the remote location of the region in the interior of the country, the Uplands had never been an integrated part of the Norwegian king&#x27;s realm. Using harsh measures, Harald burned down farms and small villages, and had people maimed and killed. Starting in Romerike, his campaign continued into Hedmark, Hadeland and Ringerike. Since the regions contained several rich rural communities, Harald strengthened his economic position by confiscating farming estates. By the end of 1065 there was probably peace in Norway, as any opposition had either been killed, chased into exile or silenced.

===Policies===
Harald&#x27;s reign was marked by his background as a military commander, as he often solved disputes with a brute force. One of his skalds even boasted about how Harald broke settlements he had made, in his battles in the Mediterranean. While the sagas largely focus on Harald&#x27;s war with Sweyn and the invasion of England, little is said about his domestic policies. Modern historians have taken this as a sign that, despite his absolute monarchy, his reign was one of peace and progress for Norway. Harald is considered to have instituted good economic policies, as he developed a Norwegian currency and a viable coin economy, which in turn allowed Norway to participate in international trade. He initiated trade with Kievan Rus&#x27; and the Byzantine Empire through his connections, as well as with Scotland and Ireland. According to the later sagas, Harald founded Oslo, where he spent much time.

Harald also continued to advance Christianity in Norway, and archaeological excavations show that churches were built and improved during his reign. He also imported bishops, priests and monks from abroad, especially from Kievan Rus&#x27; and the Byzantine Empire. A slightly different form of Christianity was thus introduced in Norway from the rest of northern Europe, although the East–West Schism had not yet taken place. Since the clergy was not ordained in England or France, it nonetheless caused controversy when Harald was visited by papal legates. The protests by the legates led Harald to throw the Catholic clergy out of his court, and he reportedly stated to the legates that &quot;he did not know of any other archbishop or lord of Norway than the king himself&quot;. Norwegian historian Halvdan Koht has remarked that the &quot;words seemed as if spoken by a Byzantine despot&quot;. It is possible that Harald maintained contacts with Byzantine emperors after he became king, which could suggest a background for his church policies.

===Northern explorations===
Once he had returned to Norway, Harald seems to have displayed an interest in exploring his own realm, as for instance the &quot;Morkinskinna&quot; recounts Harald&#x27;s trip into the Uplands. Harald is also said to have explored the seas beyond his kingdom, as the contemporary Adam of Bremen reports of such naval expeditions conducted by Harald:

Kelly DeVries has suggested that Harald &quot;may even have known of and sought out the legendary land called Vinland, which Viking sailors had discovered only a short time before&quot;, which Adam mentions earlier in the same passage to have been widely reported in Denmark and Norway. H. H. Lamb has on the other hand proposed that the land he reached may have been either Spitsbergen or Novaya Zemlya.

==Invasion of England==

===Background and preparations===
Accepting he could not conquer Denmark, Harald switched attention to England; his claim was based on a 1038 agreement between Magnus and its previous ruler, Harthacnut, who died childless in 1042. The agreement stated that if either die, the other would inherit his lands; however, it was unlikely Magnus assumed he would gain the English throne without fighting. Harthacnut himself preferred his half-brother, Edward the Confessor, who became king with the backing of Earl Godwin, father of Harold Godwinson. Plans by Magnus to invade England in 1045 were suspended, while he dealt with an uprising by Sweyn of Denmark.

After Magnus died in 1047, Harald took over his claim; however, Edward kept potential enemies happy by hinting they might succeed him; in addition to Harald, these included Sweyn, and William, Duke of Normandy. In 1058, a fleet under Harald&#x27;s son Magnus supported a large scale Welsh raid into England, although details are limited. This may have shown Harald that he could not simultaneously fight Denmark and England; this became crucial when Edward died in January 1066, and Harold Godwinson was proclaimed king of England.

Harold&#x27;s brother Tostig Godwinson, formerly Earl of Northumbria, now appeared on the scene; hoping to regain his titles and lands, he reportedly approached both William and Sweyn Estridsson for their support. However, since Northern England was the most suitable landing place for a Norwegian invasion, he was more valuable to Harald. Details are limited, but it is suggested Tostig sent a fellow exile, Copsig, to meet with Harald in Norway and agree plans, while he remained in France. If correct, this would also have allowed Tostig to increase both their chances by simultaneously supporting an invasion by William, who also claimed the throne. 
In March or April 1066, Harald began assembling his fleet at Solund, in the Sognefjord, a process completed by the start of September 1066; it included his flagship, &quot;Ormen&quot;, or &quot;Serpent&quot;. Before leaving Norway, he had Magnus proclaimed king of Norway, and left Tora behind, taking with him Elisiv, his daughters, and Olaf. En route, he stopped at the Norwegian-held islands of Shetland and Orkney, where he collected additional troops, including Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson, the Jarls of Orkney. At Dunfermline, he met Tostig&#x27;s ally, Malcolm III of Scotland, who gave him around 2,000 Scottish soldiers.

Although possible he also met Tostig there, most sources suggest they linked up at Tynemouth, on 8 September, Harald bringing around 10–15,000 men, on 240–300 longships. Tostig had only 12 ships, his connections being far more significant. The chronicler, John of Worcester, suggests he left Flanders in May or June, raiding the heartland of Harold&#x27;s estates in southern England, from the Isle of Wight to Sandwich. Having made it seem an attack from Normandy was imminent, he then sailed north, while his brother and most of his troops remained in the south, waiting for William.

===Early raids, invasion, and Battle of Fulford===

After embarking from Tynemouth, Harald and Tostig probably landed at the River Tees. They then entered Cleveland, and started plundering the coast. They encountered the first resistance at Scarborough, where Harald&#x27;s demand for surrender was opposed. In the end, Harald resorted to burning down the town and this action led to other Northumbrian towns surrendering to him. After further raiding, Harald and Tostig sailed up the Humber, disembarking at Riccall on 20 September. News of the early raids had reached the earls Morcar of Northumbria and Edwin of Mercia, and they fought against Harald&#x27;s invading army south of York at the Battle of Fulford, also on 20 September. The battle was a decisive victory for Harald and Tostig, and led York to surrender to their forces on 24 September. This would be the last time a Scandinavian army defeated English forces. The same day as York surrendered to Harald and Tostig, Harold Godwinson arrived with his army in Tadcaster, just from the anchored Norwegian fleet at Riccall. From there, he probably scouted the Norwegian fleet, preparing a surprise attack. As Harald had left no forces in York, Harold Godwinson marched right through the town to Stamford Bridge.

===Battle of Stamford Bridge===
Early on 25 September, Harald and Tostig departed their landing place at Riccall with most of their forces, but left a third of their forces behind. They brought only light armour, as they expected to just meet the citizens of York, as they had agreed the day before, at Stamford Bridge to decide on who should manage the town under Harald. Once there Harald saw Godwinson&#x27;s forces approaching, heavily armed and armoured, and greatly outnumbering Harald&#x27;s. Although (according to non-saga sources) the English forces were held up at the bridge for some time by a single gigantic Norwegian, allowing Harald and Tostig to regroup into a shield-wall formation, Harald&#x27;s army was in the end heavily beaten. Harald was struck in the throat by an arrow and killed early in the battle, later termed the Battle of Stamford Bridge, in a state of &quot;berserkergang&quot;, having worn no body armour and fought aggressively with both hands around his sword.

When the battle was almost over, some reserve forces from Riccall led by Eystein Orre finally appeared, but they were exhausted as they had run all the way. Eystein picked up Harald&#x27;s fallen banner, the &quot;Landwaster&quot; (&quot;Landøyðan&quot;), and initiated a final counter-attack. Although they for a moment appeared to almost breach the English line, Eystein was suddenly killed, which left the rest of the men to flee from the battlefield. Among those left at Riccall after the battle, who were allowed to return home peacefully by the English forces, was Harald&#x27;s son Olaf. Although sources state that Harald&#x27;s remaining army only filled 20–25 ships on the return to Norway, it is likely that this number only accounts for the Norwegian forces. Most of the forces from Scotland and Orkney probably remained at Riccall throughout the battle (the earls Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson are certainly known to have been stationed there the entire time), and has not been counted in the traditional figure.

Harold Godwinson&#x27;s victory was short-lived, as only a few weeks later he was defeated by William the Conqueror and killed at the Battle of Hastings. The fact that Harold had to make a forced march to fight Hardrada at Stamford Bridge and then move at utmost speed south to meet the Norman invasion, all in less than three weeks, is widely seen as a primary factor in William&#x27;s victory at Hastings.

==Personal life==
Harald is described by Snorri Sturluson to have been physically &quot;larger than other men and stronger&quot;. It is said that he had light hair, a light beard, and a long &quot;upper beard&quot; (moustache), and that one of his eyebrows was somewhat higher situated than the other. He also reportedly had big hands and feet, and could measure five ells in height. It is not known whether Snorri&#x27;s description of Harald&#x27;s physical appearance actually represents historical facts. The tall stature of Harald is also substantiated by a story that relates that before the Battle of Stamford Bridge, Harold Godwinson offered Tostig back the earldom of Northumbria, and Harald &quot;six feet of the ground of England, or perhaps more seeing that he is taller than most men&quot; (according to Henry of Huntingdon) or &quot;six feet of English ground, or seven feet as he was taller than other men&quot; (according to Snorri Sturluson).

Harald himself composed skaldic poetry. According to Lee M. Hollander, composing poetry was normal for Norwegian kings, but Harald was the only one who &quot;showed a decided talent.&quot; His preoccupation with the poetic form may have motivated him to give privileged attention to Icelanders, and particularly Icelandic skalds. He is portrayed as a man very concerned with the way that his image will be presented and memory shaped. According to one poem, Harald had mastered a number of activities that were considered sports in the Viking Age, in addition to poetry, brewing, horse riding, swimming, skiing, shooting, rowing and playing the harp. The sagas state that Harald and his Varangians at least once took a break during the siege of a town to enjoy sports.

With regards to religion, Harald had, according to DeVries, a &quot;religious inclination towards Christianity&quot; and was &quot;publicly close to the Christian Church&quot;, although he was influenced by the Eastern Christian culture of Kievan Rus&#x27; (Garderike) and the Byzantine Empire, having spent most of his life there. He was clearly interested in advancing Christianity in Norway, which can be seen by the continued building and improvement of churches throughout his reign. Despite this, DeVries notes that Harald&#x27;s &quot;personal morality appears not to have matched the Christian ideal&quot;, citing his marriage arrangements.

==Issue==
Harald married Elisiv of Kiev (c. 1025 – after 1066) around 1044/45, and they had an unknown number, possibly several children. According to Snorri Sturluson, they had two daughters:
* Ingegerd (). Married first to the future Olaf I of Denmark, and after his death, to the future Philip of Sweden of the House of Stenkil
* Maria (died 25 September 1066). Promised away for marriage to Eystein Orre (brother of Tora Torbergsdatter), but reportedly died on Orkney the same day that Harald (and Eystein) died at Stamford Bridge.
According to the sagas, Harald married Tora Torbergsdatter (c. 1025 – after 1066) around 1048. Some modern historians have disputed this, since Harald in that case would be in a bigamous marriage, as he was still married to Elisiv. It is nonetheless possible that such a marriage could take place in Norway in the 11th century, and although Harald had two wives, only Elisiv is noted to have held the title of Queen. Harald and Tora had at least two children:
* Magnus II (). Reigned as king of Norway from 1066 to 1069.
* Olaf III (). Reigned as king of Norway from 1067 to 1093.

==Legacy==

===Burial===

A year after his death at Stamford Bridge, Harald&#x27;s body was moved to Norway and buried at the Mary Church in Nidaros (Trondheim). About a hundred years after his burial, his body was reinterred at the Helgeseter Priory, which was demolished in the 17th century. On 25 September 2006, the 940th anniversary of Harald&#x27;s death, the newspaper &quot;Aftenposten&quot; published an article on the poor state of Norway&#x27;s ancient royal burial sites, including that of Harald, which is reportedly located underneath a road built across the monastery site. In a follow-up article on 26 September, the Municipality of Trondheim revealed they would be examining the possibility of exhuming the king and reinterring him in Nidaros Cathedral, currently the burial place of nine Norwegian kings, among them Magnus the Good and Magnus Haraldsson, Harald&#x27;s predecessor and successor respectively. A month later it was reported that the proposal to exhume the king had been scrapped.

===Modern memorials===
Two monuments have been erected in honour of Harald in Oslo, the city which he is traditionally held to have founded. A bronze relief on granite by Lars Utne depicting Harald on horseback was raised on the eponymously named square &quot;Harald Hardrådes plass&quot; in 1905. In 1950, a large relief by Anne Grimdalen, also of Harald on horseback, was unveiled on the western façade of the Oslo City Hall.

==In popular culture==
* Harald appears in a number of historical fiction books. In H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s novella &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;, one key character &quot;lay in the Old Town of King Harold Haardrada, which kept alive the name of Oslo during all the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as &#x27;Christiana&#x27;.&quot; Justin Hill&#x27;s &quot;Viking Fire&quot; is the second in his &quot;Conquest Trilogy&quot;, and tells the life of Harald in his own voice. He serves as the protagonist in two children&#x27;s books by Henry Treece, &quot;The Last of the Vikings&quot;/&quot;The Last Viking&quot; (1964) and &quot;Swords from the North&quot;/&quot;The Northern Brothers&quot; (1967). He also appears as the protagonist in the trilogy &quot;The Last Viking&quot; (1980) by Poul and Karen Anderson, and in &quot;Byzantium&quot; (1989) by Michael Ennis, which chronicles Harald&#x27;s career in the Byzantine Empire. He is also the protagonist of the series, &quot;The Last Viking Series&quot; by J.C. Duncan.
* The alternative history book &quot;Crusader Gold&quot; (2007) by marine archeologist David Gibbins features Harald as a key figure, as it follows him in acquiring the lost Menorah among his treasures during his service in the Byzantine Varangian Guard. Harald also makes an appearance in &quot;Meadowland&quot; (2005) by Tom Holt.
* Harald&#x27;s unorthodox departure from Constantinople is featured in music by the Finnish folk metal band Turisas in the song &quot;The Great Escape&quot;; in addition, he is followed loosely throughout the story of the albums &quot;The Varangian Way&quot; (2007) and &quot;Stand Up and Fight&quot; (2011).
* Harald is a playable character in the mobile/PC game &quot;Rise of Kingdoms&quot;.
* Harald is a playable character as &quot;Harald Hardrada&quot; in the turn-based strategy game &quot;Civilization VI&quot;. He is a leader of the Norwegian civilization.
* Harald is depicted in Netflix drama series &quot;&quot;. His role is played by English actor Leo Suter.
* He is portrayed by Sveinn Ólafur Gunnarsson in the 2025 TV series &quot;King and Conqueror&quot;.

<text>The DuMont Television Network (also the DuMont Network, DuMont Television, DuMont/Du Mont, or (incorrectly) Dumont ) was one of America&#x27;s pioneer commercial television networks, rivaling NBC and CBS for the distinction of being first overall in the United States. It was owned by Allen B. DuMont Laboratories, a television equipment and television set manufacturer &amp; broadcasting company. DuMont was founded in 1940 and began operation on August 15, 1946.

The network was hindered by the cost of broadcasting, a freeze on new television stations in 1948 by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and even the company&#x27;s partner, Paramount Pictures. Despite innovations in broadcasting, and launching one of television&#x27;s biggest stars of the 1950s—Jackie Gleason—the network never reached solid finances. Forced to expand on UHF channels when UHF tuning was not yet standard on television sets, DuMont fought an uphill battle for program clearance outside its three owned-and-operated stations: WABD New York City, WTTG Washington, D.C., and WDTV Pittsburgh, ultimately ending network operations on August 6, 1956, leaving three main networks other than public broadcasting, until the founding of Fox in 1986.

DuMont&#x27;s obscurity, caused mainly by the destruction of its extensive program archive by the 1970s, has prompted TV historian David Weinstein to refer to it as the &quot;forgotten network&quot;. A few popular DuMont programs, such as &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot; and Emmy Award winner &quot;Life Is Worth Living&quot;, appear in television retrospectives or are mentioned briefly in books about U.S. television history. In addition, a collection of programs and promos is available on the Roku streaming channel under the DuMont name.

==History==
===Origins===

Allen B. DuMont Laboratories was founded in 1931 by Allen B. DuMont with $1,000 from a laboratory in his basement. He and his staff were responsible for early technical innovations like the first consumer electronic television receiver in 1938. Their most revolutionary contribution came when the team extended the life of a cathode-ray tube from 24 to 1,000 hours, making television sets practical for consumers. The company&#x27;s television receivers soon became the standard of the industry. In 1942, DuMont worked with the U.S. Army in developing radar during World War II. This brought in $5 million for the company.

Early sales of television receivers were hampered by the lack of regularly scheduled programming. A few months after selling his first set in 1938, DuMont opened his own New York-area television station (W2XVT) in Passaic, New Jersey. In 1940, the station moved to Manhattan as W2XWV on channel 4 and commenced broadcasting on April 13, 1940. Unlike CBS and NBC, which reduced their television broadcasting during World War II, DuMont continued experimental and commercial broadcasts throughout the war. In 1944, W2XWV received its commercial license, the third in New York, under the call letters WABD (derived from DuMont&#x27;s initials). In 1945, it moved to channel 5. On May 19, 1945, DuMont opened experimental W3XWT in Washington, D.C. which became commercial station WTTG.

Paramount Pictures became a minority shareholder in DuMont Laboratories when it advanced $400,000 in 1939 for a 40% share in the company. Paramount had television interests of its own, having launched stations in Los Angeles in 1939 and Chicago in 1940. DuMont&#x27;s association with Paramount would later come back to haunt DuMont.

Soon after his experimental Washington station signed on, DuMont began experimental coaxial cable hookups between his laboratories in Passaic and his two stations. It is said that one of those broadcasts on the hookup announced that the U.S. had dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945. This was later considered the official beginning of the DuMont Network by both Thomas T. Goldsmith, the network&#x27;s chief engineer and DuMont&#x27;s best friend, and DuMont himself. Regular network service began on August 15, 1946, on WABD and W3XWT. In November 1946, W3XWT was granted a commercial license, the capital&#x27;s first, as WTTG, named after Goldsmith. These two DuMont owned-and-operated stations were joined by WDTV (channel 3) in Pittsburgh on January 11, 1949.

Although NBC in New York had station-to-station television links as early as 1940 with WPTZ (KYW) in Philadelphia and WRGB in Schenectady, New York, DuMont received its station licenses before NBC resumed its previously sporadic network broadcasts after the war. ABC had just come into existence as a radio network in 1943 and did not enter network television until 1948 when its flagship station in New York City, WJZ-TV (WABC-TV), began broadcasting. CBS also waited until 1948 to begin network operations, because it was waiting for the Federal Communications Commission to approve its color television system (which it eventually did not, due to its mechanical nature and incompatibility with black and white receivers). Other companies, including Mutual, the Yankee Network, and Paramount, were interested in starting television networks, but were prevented from doing so by restrictive FCC regulations, although the Paramount Television Network had limited success in network operations in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

===Programming===

Despite no history of radio programming, no stable of radio stars to draw on, and perennial cash shortages, DuMont was an innovative and creative network. Without the radio revenues that supported mighty NBC and CBS, DuMont programmers relied on their wits and on connections with Broadway.

The network largely ignored the standard business model of 1950s TV, in which one advertiser sponsored an entire show, enabling it to have complete control over its content. Instead, DuMont sold commercials to several different advertisers, freeing producers of its shows from the veto power held by sole sponsors. This eventually became the standard model for U.S. television. Some commercial time was sold regionally on a co-op basis, while other spots were sold network-wide.

DuMont also holds another important place in American TV history. WDTV&#x27;s sign-on made it possible for stations in the Midwest to receive live network programming from stations on the East Coast, and vice versa. Before then, the networks relied on separate regional networks in the two time zones for live programming, and the West Coast received network programming from kinescopes (films shot directly from live television screens) originating from the East Coast. On January 11, 1949, the coaxial cable linking East and Midwest (known in television circles as &quot;the Golden Spike&quot;, in reference to the golden spike that united the First transcontinental railroad) was activated. The ceremony, hosted by DuMont and WDTV, was carried on all four networks. WGN-TV (channel 9) in Chicago and WABD in New York were able to share programs through a live coaxial cable feed when WDTV signed on in Pittsburgh, because the station completed the East Coast-to-Midwest chain, allowing stations in both regions to air the same program simultaneously, which is still the standard for US TV. It was another two years before the West Coast got live programming from the East (and the East able to get live programming from the West), but this was the beginning of the modern era of network television.

The first broadcasts came from DuMont&#x27;s 515 Madison Avenue headquarters. It soon found additional space, including a fully functioning theater, in the New York branch of Wanamaker&#x27;s department store at Ninth Street and Broadway. Later, a lease on the Adelphi Theatre on 54th Street and the Ambassador Theatre on West 49th Street gave the network a site for variety shows. In 1954, the lavish DuMont Tele-Centre opened in the former Jacob Ruppert&#x27;s Central Opera House at 205 East 67th Street, today the site of the Fox Television Center and home of WABD successor station WNYW.

DuMont was the first network to broadcast a film production for TV: &quot;Talk Fast, Mister&quot;, produced by RKO in 1944. DuMont also aired the first TV situation comedy, &quot;Mary Kay and Johnny&quot;, as well as the first network-televised soap opera, &quot;Faraway Hill&quot;. &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot;, a variety show hosted by Jackie Gleason, was the birthplace of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; skits (Gleason took his variety show to CBS in 1952, but filmed the &quot;Classic 39&quot; Honeymooners episodes at DuMont&#x27;s Adelphi Theater studio in 1955–56). Bishop Fulton J. Sheen&#x27;s devotional program &quot;Life Is Worth Living&quot; went up against Milton Berle in many cities, becoming the first show to compete successfully in the ratings against &quot;Mr. Television&quot;. In 1952, Sheen won an Emmy Award for &quot;Most Outstanding Personality&quot;. The network&#x27;s other notable programs include:
* &quot;Ted Mack&#x27;s The Original Amateur Hour&quot;, which began on radio in the 1930s under original host Edward Bowes
* &quot;The Morey Amsterdam Show&quot;, a comedy/variety show hosted by Morey Amsterdam, which started on CBS before moving to DuMont in 1949
* &quot;Captain Video and His Video Rangers&quot;, a hugely popular children&#x27;s science fiction series
* &quot;The Arthur Murray Party&quot;, a dance program
* &quot;Down You Go&quot;, a popular panel show
* &quot;Rocky King, Inside Detective&quot;, a private eye series starring Roscoe Karns
* &quot;The Plainclothesman&quot;, a camera&#x27;s-eye-view detective series
* Live coverage of boxing and professional wrestling, the latter featuring matches staged by National Wrestling Alliance member Fred Kohler Enterprises in Chicago under the name &quot;Wrestling from Marigold Arena&quot;
* &quot;The Johns Hopkins Science Review&quot;, a Peabody Award-winning education program
* &quot;Cash and Carry&quot;, the first network-televised game show
* &quot;The Ernie Kovacs Show&quot;, a comedy show hosted by Ernie Kovacs
* &quot;The Magic Cottage&quot;, a children&#x27;s show starring artist Patricia Meikle
* &quot;The Goldbergs,&quot; a warm look at an immigrant Jewish family in New York City, starring its creator and writer &quot;Gertrude Berg&quot;

The network was a pioneer in TV programming aimed at minority audiences and featuring minority performers, at a time when the other American networks aired few television series for non-whites. Among DuMont&#x27;s minority programs were &quot;The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong&quot;, starring film actress Anna May Wong, the first U.S. TV show to star an Asian American person; and &quot;The Hazel Scott Show&quot;, starring pianist and singer Hazel Scott, the first U.S. network TV series to be hosted by a black woman.

Although DuMont&#x27;s programming pre-dated videotape, many DuMont offerings were recorded on kinescopes. These kinescopes were said to be stored in a warehouse until the 1970s. Actress Edie Adams, the wife of comedian Ernie Kovacs (both regular performers on early television) testified in 1996 before a panel of the Library of Congress on the preservation of television and video. Adams claimed that so little value was given to these films that the stored kinescopes were loaded into three trucks and dumped into Upper New York Bay. Nevertheless, a number of DuMont programs survive at The Paley Center for Media in New York, the UCLA Film and Television Archive in Los Angeles, in the Peabody Awards Collection at the University of Georgia, and in the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago.

Although nearly the entire DuMont film archive was destroyed, several surviving DuMont shows have been released on DVD. Much of what survived was either never properly copyrighted (live telecasts, because they were not set on a fixed medium, were not eligible for copyright at the time, although films of those telecasts could if they contained a proper copyright notice) or lapsed into the public domain in the late 1970s when DuMont&#x27;s successor-company Metromedia declined to renew the copyrights. A large number of episodes of &quot;Life Is Worth Living&quot; have been saved, and they are now aired weekly on Catholic-oriented cable network, the Eternal Word Television Network, which also makes a collection of them available on DVD (in the biographical information about Fulton J. Sheen added to the end of many episodes, a still image of Bishop Sheen looking into a DuMont Television camera can be seen). Several companies that distribute DVDs over the Internet have released a small number of episodes of &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot; and &quot;The Morey Amsterdam Show&quot;. Two more DuMont programs, &quot;Captain Video and His Video Rangers&quot; and &quot;Rocky King, Inside Detective&quot;, have had a small number of surviving episodes released commercially by at least one major distributor of public domain programming. Because so few episodes remain of most DuMont series, they are seldom rerun, even though there is no licensing cost to do so. There also is a small collection of various DuMont programs available via the Roku streaming service.

====Awards====
DuMont programs were by necessity low-budget affairs, and the network received relatively few awards from the TV industry. Most awards during the 1950s went to NBC and CBS, who were able to out-spend other companies and draw on their extensive history of radio broadcasting in the relatively new television medium.

During the 1952–53 TV season, the aforementioned Bishop Sheen won an Emmy Award for &quot;Most Outstanding Personality&quot;. Sheen beat out three CBS nominees -- Arthur Godfrey, Edward R. Murrow, and Lucille Ball -- for the honors. Sheen also was nominated for Public Service Emmys in 1952, 1953, and 1954.

DuMont received an Emmy nomination for &quot;Down You Go&quot;, a popular game show during the 1952–53 television season (in the category &quot;Best Audience Participation, Quiz, or Panel Program&quot;). The network was nominated twice for its coverage of professional football during the 1953–54 and 1954–55 television seasons.

&quot;The Johns Hopkins Science Review&quot;, a DuMont public affairs program, was awarded a Peabody Award in 1952 in the Education category. Sheen&#x27;s Emmy and the &quot;Science Review&quot; Peabody were the only national awards the DuMont Network received. Though DuMont series and performers continued to win local TV awards, by the mid-1950s the DuMont network no longer had a national presence.

====Ratings====
The earliest measurements of TV audiences were performed by the C. E. Hooper company of New York. DuMont performed well in the Hooper ratings; in fact, DuMont&#x27;s talent program, &quot;The Original Amateur Hour&quot;, was the most popular series of the 1947–48 season. Two seasons later, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked DuMont&#x27;s popular variety series &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot; as the 10th most popular series.

In February 1950, Hooper&#x27;s competitor A. C. Nielsen bought out the Hooper ratings system. DuMont did not fare well with the change: none of its shows appeared on Nielsen&#x27;s annual top 20 lists of the most popular series. The aforementioned &quot;Life is Worth Living&quot; did receive Nielsen ratings of up to 11.1, meaning that it attracted more than 10 million viewers. Bishop Sheen&#x27;s one-man program – in which he discussed philosophy, psychology, and other fields of thought from a Christian perspective – was the most widely viewed religious series in the history of television. 169 local television stations aired &quot;Life&quot;, and for three years the program competed successfully against NBC&#x27;s popular &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot;. The ABC and CBS programs that aired in the same timeslot were canceled.

&quot;Life is Worth Living&quot; was not the only DuMont program to achieve double-digit ratings. In 1952, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that popular DuMont game show &quot;Down You Go&quot; had attracted an audience estimated at 16 million viewers. Similarly, DuMont&#x27;s summer 1954 replacement series, &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, achieved audiences estimated at 10 million. Still, these series were only moderately popular compared to NBC&#x27;s and CBS&#x27;s highest-rated programs.

Nielsen was not the only company to report TV ratings. Companies such as Trendex, Videodex, and Arbitron had also measured TV viewership. The chart in this section comes from Videodex&#x27;s August 1950 ratings breakdown, as reported in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine.

===Disputes with AT&amp;T and Paramount===
DuMont struggled to get its programs aired in many parts of the country, in part due to technical limitations of network lines maintained by telephone company AT&amp;T Corporation. During the 1940s and 1950s, television signals were sent between stations via coaxial cable and microwave links owned by AT&amp;T. The service provider did not have enough circuits to provide signal relay service from the four networks to all of their affiliates at the same time, so AT&amp;T allocated times when each network could offer live programs to its affiliates. In 1950, AT&amp;T allotted NBC and CBS each over 100 hours of live prime time network service, but gave ABC 53 hours, and DuMont 37. AT&amp;T also required each television network to lease both radio and television lines. DuMont was the only television network without a radio network, so it was the only network forced to pay for a service it did not use. DuMont protested AT&amp;T&#x27;s actions with the Federal Communications Commission, and eventually reached a compromise.

DuMont&#x27;s biggest corporate hurdle may have been with the company&#x27;s own partner, Paramount. Relations between the two companies were strained as early as 1939 when Paramount opened experimental television stations in Los Angeles and Chicago without DuMont&#x27;s involvement. Dr. DuMont claimed that the original 1937 acquisition proposal required Paramount to expand its television interests &quot;through DuMont&quot;. Paramount representative Paul Raibourn, who also was a member of DuMont&#x27;s board of directors, denied that any such restriction had ever been discussed, but Dr. DuMont was vindicated by a 1953 examination of the original draft document.

DuMont aspired to grow beyond its three stations, applying for new television station licenses in Cincinnati and Cleveland in 1947. This would have given the network five owned-and-operated stations (O&amp;Os), the maximum allowed by the FCC at the time. However, DuMont was hampered by Paramount&#x27;s two stations -- KTLA (channel 5) in Los Angeles and WBKB (channel 4, now WBBM-TV on channel 2) in Chicago – the descendants of the two experimental stations that rankled DuMont in 1940. Although these stations generally did not carry DuMont programming (KTLA did for just one year, 1947 to 1948), and, in fact, competed against DuMont&#x27;s affiliates in those cities the FCC ruled that Paramount essentially controlled DuMont, which effectively placed the network at the five-station cap. Paramount&#x27;s exertion of influence over the network&#x27;s management and the power of its voting stock led the FCC to its conclusion. Thus, DuMont was unable to open additional stations as long as Paramount owned stations or owned a portion of DuMont. Paramount refused to sell.

In 1949, Paramount Pictures launched the Paramount Television Network, a service that provided local television stations with filmed television programs. Paramount&#x27;s network &quot;undercut the company that it had invested in.&quot; Paramount did not share its stars, big budgets, or filmed programs with DuMont; the company had stopped financially supporting DuMont in 1941. Although Paramount executives indicated they would produce programs for DuMont, the studio never supplied the network with programs or technical assistance. The acrimonious relationship between Paramount and DuMont climaxed during the 1953 FCC hearings regarding the ABC–United Paramount Theaters merger when Paul Raibourn, an executive at Paramount, publicly derided the quality of DuMont television sets in court testimony.

===Early troubles===

DuMont began with one basic disadvantage: unlike NBC, CBS and ABC, it did not have a radio network from which to draw big-name talent, affiliate loyalty, or radio profits to underwrite television operations until the television medium itself became profitable. Most early television licenses were granted to established radio broadcasters, and many longtime relationships with radio networks carried over to the new medium. As CBS and NBC (and to a lesser extent, ABC) gained their footing, they began to offer programming that drew on their radio backgrounds, bringing over the most popular radio stars. Early television station owners, when deciding which network would receive their main affiliation, were more likely to choose CBS&#x27;s roster of Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, and Ed Sullivan, or NBC&#x27;s lineup of Milton Berle and Sid Caesar, over DuMont, which offered a then-unknown Jackie Gleason and Bishop Fulton J. Sheen. In smaller markets, with a limited number of stations, DuMont and ABC were often relegated to secondary status, so their programs got clearance only if the primary network was off the air or delayed via kinescope recording (&quot;tele-transcriptions,&quot; in DuMont parlance).

Adding to DuMont&#x27;s troubles was the FCC&#x27;s 1948 &quot;freeze&quot; on television license applications. This was done to sort out the thousands of applications that had come streaming in, but also to rethink the allocation and technical standards laid down prior to World War II. It became clear soon after the war that 12 channels (&quot;channel 1&quot; had been removed from television broadcasting in 1948 for allocation to land-mobile radio) were not nearly enough for national television service. What was to be a six-month freeze lasted until 1952, when the FCC opened the UHF spectrum. The FCC, however, did not require television manufacturers to include UHF capability. To see UHF stations, most consumers had to buy expensive converters. Even then, the picture quality was marginal at best, depending on geographic location. . Tied to this was a decision to restrict VHF allocations in medium- and smaller-sized markets. Meanwhile, television sets would not be &quot;required&quot; to have all-channel tuning until 1964, with the passage of the All-Channel Receiver Act.

Forced to rely on UHF to expand, DuMont saw one station after another go dark due to dismal ratings. It bought small, distressed UHF station KCTY (channel 25) in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1954, but ran it for just three months before shutting it down at a considerable loss after attempting to compete with three established VHF stations.

The FCC&#x27;s Hyman H. Goldin said in 1960, &quot;If there had been four VHF outlets in the top markets, there&#x27;s no question DuMont would have lived and would have eventually turned the corner in terms of profitability.&quot;

===Decline and the end of the network===
During the early years of television, there was some measure of cooperation among the four major U.S. networks. However, as television grew into a profitable business, an intense rivalry developed among the networks, just as it had in radio. NBC and CBS competed fiercely for viewers and advertising dollars, a contest neither underfunded DuMont nor ABC could hope to win. According to author Dennis Mazzocco, &quot;NBC tried to make an arrangement with ABC and CBS to destroy the DuMont network.&quot; The plan was for NBC and CBS to exclusively offer ABC their most popular series after they had aired on the bigger networks. ABC would become a network of re-runs, but DuMont would be shut out. ABC president Leonard Goldenson rejected NBC executive David Sarnoff&#x27;s proposal, but did not report it to the Justice Department.

DuMont survived the early 1950s only because of WDTV in Pittsburgh, the lone commercial VHF station in what then was the sixth-largest market in the country after New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Washington. WDTV&#x27;s only competition came from UHF stations WENS-TV (on the frequency now occupied by WINP-TV) and WKJF-TV (now WPGH-TV) and distant stations from Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Youngstown, Ohio, and Wheeling, West Virginia. There also were external factors such as the FCC&#x27;s freeze on licenses and intense competition for the remaining VHF licenses in Pittsburgh, including WENS-TV appealing the FCC&#x27;s granting of the channel 11 license that was eventually affirmed for WIIC-TV (now WPXI), the battle between the Hearst Corporation (then-owners of WCAE) and KQV over the channel 4 license that eventually would become WTAE-TV, and -- perhaps the most impactful one to DuMont&#x27;s future -- locally-based Westinghouse Electric Corporation (owners of radio pioneer KDKA) battling with local interest groups for the channel 13 license that was intended to be a non-commercial license. The FCC also denied CBS&#x27;s request to be granted the channel 9 allocation in nearby Steubenville, Ohio, and move it to Pittsburgh so Steubenville had a chance to have its own television station. As a result, no other commercial VHF station signed on in Pittsburgh until WIIC-TV in 1957, giving WDTV a de facto monopoly on television in the area. Since WDTV carried secondary affiliations with the other three networks, DuMont used this as a bargaining chip to get its programs cleared in other large markets.

Despite its severe financial straits, by 1953 DuMont appeared to be on its way to establishing itself as the third national network. despite a smaller footprint than ABC. While DuMont programs aired live on 16 stations, the network could count on only seven primary stations – its three owned-and-operated stations (&quot;O&amp;Os) plus WGN-TV in Chicago, KTTV (channel 11) in Los Angeles, KFEL-TV (channel 2, now KWGN-TV) in Denver, and WTVN-TV (channel 6, now WSYX) in Columbus, Ohio.

In contrast, by 1953 ABC had a full complement of five O&amp;Os, augmented by nine primary affiliates. ABC also had a radio network descended from NBC&#x27;s Blue Network from which to draw talent, affiliate loyalty, and generate income to subsidize television operations. However, ABC had only 14 primary stations, while CBS and NBC had over 40 each. By 1951, ABC was badly overextended and on the verge of bankruptcy. That year, the company announced a merger with United Paramount Theaters (UPT) (the former theater division of Paramount Pictures, which was spun off as a result of the &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot; antitrust decision), but it was not until 1953 that the FCC approved the merger.

By this time, DuMont had begun to differentiate itself from NBC and CBS. It allowed its advertisers to choose the locations where their advertising ran, potentially saving them millions of dollars. By contrast, ABC followed NBC&#x27;s and CBS&#x27;s practice of forcing advertisers to purchase a large &quot;must-buy&quot; list of stations, even though it was only a fourth the size of NBC and CBS.

ABC&#x27;s fortunes were dramatically altered in February 1953, when the FCC cleared the way for UPT to buy the network. The merger provided ABC with a badly needed cash infusion, giving it the resources to mount &quot;top shelf&quot; programming and to provide a national television service on a scale approaching that of CBS and NBC. Through UPT president Leonard Goldenson, ABC also gained ties with the Hollywood studios that more than matched those DuMont&#x27;s producers had with Broadway.

Realizing that ABC had more resources than they could even begin to match, DuMont officials were receptive to a merger offer from ABC. Goldenson quickly brokered a deal with Ted Bergmann, DuMont&#x27;s managing director, under which the merged network would have been called &quot;ABC-DuMont&quot; until at least 1958 and would have honored all of DuMont&#x27;s network commitments. In return, DuMont would get $5 million in cash, guaranteed advertising time for DuMont sets, and a secure future for its staff. 

A merged ABC-DuMont would have been an entity rivaling CBS and NBC, as it would have owned stations in five of the six largest U.S. television markets (excluding only Philadelphia) as well as ABC&#x27;s radio network. It also would have inherited DuMont&#x27;s de facto monopoly in Pittsburgh and would have been one of two networks, along with NBC, to have full ownership of a station in the nation&#x27;s capital. However, it would have had to sell a New York station – either DuMont&#x27;s WABD or ABC&#x27;s flagship WJZ-TV (channel 7, now WABC-TV), probably the former. It also would have had to sell two other stations – most likely ABC&#x27;s two smallest O&amp;Os, WXYZ-TV in Detroit and KGO-TV in San Francisco (both broadcasting on channel 7) – to get under the FCC&#x27;s limit of five stations per owner.

However, Paramount vetoed the plan almost out of hand due to antitrust concerns. A few months earlier, the FCC had ruled that Paramount controlled DuMont, and there still were some questions about whether UPT had really separated from Paramount.
With no other way to readily obtain cash, DuMont sold WDTV to Westinghouse for $9.75 million in late 1954, after Westinghouse decided to give public backing to the public interest groups for the channel 13 allocation in Pittsburgh, allowing the station to launch that spring as educational WQED. While this gave DuMont a short-term cash infusion, it eliminated the leverage the network had to get program clearances in other markets. Without its de facto monopoly in Pittsburgh, the company&#x27;s advertising revenue shrank to less than half that of 1953. By February 1955, DuMont realized it could not continue as a television network. The decision was made to shut down network operations and operate WABD and WTTG as independent stations.

On April 1, 1955, most of DuMont&#x27;s entertainment programs were dropped. Bishop Sheen aired his last program on DuMont on April 26 but later moved it to ABC. By May, just eight programs were left on the network, with only inexpensive shows and sporting events keeping the remains of the network going through the summer. The network also largely abandoned the use of the intercity network coaxial cable, on which it had spent $3 million in 1954 to transmit shows that mostly lacked station clearance. The company only retained network links for live sports programming and utilizing the company&#x27;s Electronicam process to produce studio-based programming. Electronicam is best remembered for being used by Jackie Gleason&#x27;s producers for the 39-half-hour episodes of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; that aired on CBS during the 1955–56 television season.

In August 1955, Paramount, with the help of other stockholders, seized full control of DuMont Laboratories. Shareholders approved a split of the manufacturing and broadcasting operations of the company in August 1955, and the sponsored shows on the network were discontinued. The last non-sports program on DuMont, the game show &quot;What&#x27;s the Story&quot;, aired on September 23, 1955. After that, DuMont&#x27;s network feed was used only for occasional sporting events. The last broadcast on what was left of the DuMont Television Network, a boxing match, aired on August 6, 1956. (The date has also been reported as September 1955, November 1957 or August 4, 1958, with the last broadcast of &quot;Monday Night Fights&quot;.) According to one source, the final program aired on only five stations nationwide. It appears that the boxing show was syndicated to a few other east coast stations until 1958, but likely not as a production of DuMont or its successor company. Likewise, the remains of DuMont were used to syndicate a high school football Thanksgiving game in 1957; that telecast, the only DuMont broadcast to have been sent in color, was a personal project of Allen DuMont himself, whose hometown team in Montclair, New Jersey, was contending in the game for a state championship.

DuMont spun off WABD and WTTG as the DuMont Broadcasting Corporation; in requesting the FCC&#x27;s approval of the reorganization, it told the commission that the network &quot;could not be operated profitably under the existing system of allocation and control of television broadcast stations and affiliations&quot;. The name was later changed to &quot;Metropolitan Broadcasting Company&quot; to distance the company from what was seen as a complete failure. In 1958, John Kluge bought Paramount&#x27;s shares for $4 million, and in 1961 renamed the company Metromedia. WABD became WNEW-TV and later WNYW. WTTG still broadcasts under its original call letters as a Fox affiliate.

For 50 years, DuMont was the only major broadcast television network to cease operations, until CBS Corporation and Time Warner merged two other struggling networks, UPN and The WB, in September 2006, to create The CW Television Network – whose schedule was originally composed largely of programs from both of its predecessor networks.

===Failed revival of the DuMont brand===
On February 22, 2018, Lightning One, Inc., owned by Smashing Pumpkins lead singer Billy Corgan, filed a U.S. trademark application for &quot;The Dumont Network.&quot; The application by Lightning One was very likely associated with its ownership of the &quot;National Wrestling Alliance&quot; trademark, the moniker of one of the oldest wrestling promotions in the United States. However, according to the registration filing, the trademark for &quot;The Dumont Network&quot; as owned by Lightning One was allowed to lapse on July 2, 2020, rendering the trademark dead.

==Fate of the DuMont stations==
All three DuMont-owned stations still are operating and are owned-and-operated stations of their respective networks, just as when they were part of DuMont. Of the three, only Washington&#x27;s WTTG still has its original call letters.

WTTG and New York&#x27;s WABD (later WNEW-TV, and now WNYW) survived as Metromedia-owned independents until 1986, when they were purchased by the News Corporation to form the nucleus of the new Fox television network. Clarke Ingram, who maintained a DuMont memorial site, has suggested that Fox can be considered a revival, or at least a linear descendant, of DuMont.

Westinghouse changed WDTV&#x27;s call letters to KDKA-TV after the pioneering radio station of the same name, and switched its primary affiliation to CBS immediately after the sale. Westinghouse&#x27;s acquisition of CBS in 1995 made KDKA-TV a CBS owned-and-operated station.

==DuMont programming library==
DuMont produced more than 20,000 television episodes from 1946 to 1956. Because they were created prior to the Ampex electronic videotape recorder in late 1956, they were broadcast live in black and white and recorded on film kinescope for West Coast rebroadcast and reruns. By the early 1970s, their vast library of 35mm and 16mm kinescopes wound up in the hands of &quot;a successor network&quot; (most likely Metromedia) that reportedly disposed of them in New York City&#x27;s East River to make warehouse space for videotapes.

Although some films submerged for decades have been successfully recovered (see &quot;The Carpet from Bagdad&quot; for example), there have been no salvage-diving efforts to locate or recover the DuMont archive. If it survived in that environment, the films have likely been damaged. Other kinescopes were put through a reclaiming process to recover the silver from the photo emulsion on black-and-white film.

It is estimated that only about 350 complete DuMont television shows survive, including seven early Jackie Gleason&#x27;s &quot;Honeymooners&quot; comedy sketches from 1951–1952. Most of the existing episodes are believed to have come from the personal archives of DuMont&#x27;s hosts, such as the late Gleason and Dennis James.

==Affiliates==
At its peak in 1954, DuMont was affiliated with around 200 television stations. In those days, television stations were free to &quot;cherry-pick&quot; which programs they would air, and many stations affiliated with multiple networks, depending mainly on the number of commercial television stations available in a market at a given time (markets where only one commercial station was available carried programming from all four major networks). Many of DuMont&#x27;s &quot;affiliates&quot; carried very little DuMont programming, choosing to air one or two more popular programs (such as &quot;Life Is Worth Living&quot;) and/or sports programming on the weekends. Few stations carried the full DuMont program lineup. For example, the promising WKLO-TV (UHF Ch. 21) in the growing Louisville, Kentucky/Indiana market had to split its time between DuMont and ABC-TV. The station lasted only seven months (September 1953 – April 1954) on the air.

In its later years, DuMont was carried mostly on poorly watched UHF channels or had only secondary affiliations on VHF stations. DuMont ended most operations on April 1, 1955, but honored network commitments until August 1956.

<text>FM broadcasting in the United States began in the 1930s at engineer and inventor Edwin Howard Armstrong&#x27;s experimental station, W2XMN. The use of FM radio has been associated with higher sound quality in music radio.

==History of FM radio in the U.S.==
In the United States, FM broadcasting stations currently are assigned to 101 channels, designated 87.9 to 107.9 MHz, within a 20.2 MHz-wide frequency band, spanning 87.8–108.0 MHz.

In the 1930s investigations were begun into establishing radio stations transmitting on &quot;Very High Frequency&quot; (VHF) assignments above 30 MHz. In October 1937, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced new frequency allocations, which included a band of experimental and educational &quot;Apex&quot; stations, that consisted of 75 channels spanning from 41.02 to 43.98 MHz. Like the existing AM band these stations employed amplitude modulation, however the 40 kHz spacing between adjacent frequencies was four times as much as the 10 kHz spacing on the standard AM broadcast band, which reduced adjacent-frequency interference, and provided more bandwidth for high-fidelity programming.

Also during the 1930s a competing transmission technology, &quot;wide-band frequency modulation&quot;, was developed in the United States by Edwin Howard Armstrong, which was promoted as being superior to AM transmissions, in particular due to its high-fidelity and near immunity to static interference. On June 17, 1936 Armstrong formally demonstrated his FM system to the FCC. That year he also set up the first FM radio station, W2XMN in Alpine, New Jersey, to function as a demonstration station. In 1937 the Yankee Network, looking to eventually establish commercial FM operations, was granted a construction permit for an experimental station, W1XOJ, in Paxton, Massachusetts. The first publicized W2XMN broadcast took place on July 18, 1939, which used a high-quality phone line link to rebroadcast a program from WQXR in New York City. On July 24, 1939, W1XOJ inaugurated a regular schedule of 16 hours a day (8 a.m. to midnight). On January 5, 1940, Armstrong, working with the Yankee Network, demonstrated FM broadcasting in a long-distance relay network, via five stations in five states.

In May 1940, largely as the result of Armstrong&#x27;s efforts, the FCC decided to eliminate the Apex band, and authorized an FM band effective January 1, 1941, operating on 40 channels spanning 42–50 MHz. On October 31, 1940, the first 15 commercial station Construction Permit authorizations were issued. On March 1, 1941 W47NV began broadcasting in Nashville, Tennessee, becoming the first fully licensed commercial FM station. There was significant interest in the new FM band by station owners, however, construction restrictions that went into place during World War II limited the growth of the new service.

Following the end of the war, the FCC moved to standardize its frequency allocations. One area of concern was the effects of tropospheric and Sporadic E propagation, which at times reflected station signals over great distances, causing mutual interference. A particularly controversial proposal, spearheaded by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), which was headed by David Sarnoff, was that the FM band needed to be shifted to higher frequencies in order to avoid this potential problem. Armstrong charged that this reassignment had the covert goal of disrupting FM radio development, however RCA&#x27;s proposal prevailed, and on June 27, 1945 the FCC announced the reassignment of the FM band to 80 channels from 88–106 MHz (which was soon expanded to 100 channels from 88–108 MHz), while allocating the former FM band frequencies to &quot;non-government fixed and mobile&quot; (42–44 MHz), and television channel 1 (44–50 MHz), controversially ignoring the effect of tropospheric and Sporadic E propagation on those services. 

A period of allowing existing FM stations to broadcast on both the original &quot;low&quot; and new &quot;high&quot; FM bands followed, though as late as 1947, in Detroit, there were only 3,000 FM receivers in use for the new band, and 21,000 for the old band. The dual band transition period ended at midnight on January 8, 1949, at which time all low band transmissions had to end, making obsolete 395,000 receivers already purchased by the public for the original band. Although converters were manufactured allowing low band FM sets to receive high band transmissions, they were complicated to install and often as (or more) expensive than buying a new high band set. The greater expense was the cost for the radio stations converting to the new FM radio band. The FM radio industry did not recover significantly from the setback until the upsurge in high fidelity equipment in the late 1950s.

In the early 1960s, FM began to benefit from increased investment, as broadcasters looked to it to expand their markets; television had been built out by this point, and the shift to music as the dominant format of AM in the wake of television and the rise of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll had led to an AM band so crowded that the FCC was limiting many stations to daytime-only operation, a restriction to which FM was not subject. The FCC gave FM two boosts in the early 1960s: first by setting a technical standard for stereo broadcasts, and second by adopting the FM Non-Duplication Rule in 1964, prohibiting broadcasters with an AM and FM license in cities of more than 100,000 from transmitting more than 50% of the same programming on both stations.

By the end of the 1970s, 50.1% of radio listeners were listening to FM stations, ending AM&#x27;s historical lead. By 1982, FM commanded 70% of the general audience, and 84% among the 12- to 24-year-old demographic. The shift in popularity of FM radio over AM in United States during the 1970s has been called by record producer Steve Greenberg &quot;a seismic technological shift that had torn apart the very idea of the mass audience upon which pop hits depended&quot;. (AM radio would adapt by shifting its focus to talk radio, which would be deregulated in the late 1980s after the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine.)

==FM radio channel assignments in the U.S.==
In the United States, FM broadcasting stations operate on a 20.2 MHz-wide frequency band, spanning from 87.8 MHz to 108 MHz. This is divided into 101 0.2 MHz-wide channels, which are designated as channels 200 through 300. In actual practice, few except the FCC use these channel numbers; the frequencies are used instead. (A limited number of low power TV stations have been authorized for a supplemental FM broadcast on 87.7 MHz.)

To receive a station, an FM receiver is tuned to the center frequency of the station&#x27;s channel. The lowest and almost-unused channel, channel 200, extends from 87.8 MHz to 88.0 MHz; thus its center frequency is 87.9 MHz. Channel 201 has a center frequency of 88.1 MHz, and so on, up to channel 300, which extends from 107.8 to 108.0 MHz and has a center frequency of 107.9 MHz.

Because each channel is 0.2 MHz wide, the center frequencies of adjacent channels differ by 0.2 MHz. Because the lowest channel is centered on 87.9 MHz, the tenths digit (in MHz) of the center frequency of any FM station in the United States is always an odd number. FM audio for analog television channel 6 is broadcast at a carrier frequency of 87.75 MHz, and many radios can tune this low; full-power stations ceased analog operations in 2009 under FCC orders, but a very small amount of low-power stations are still operated solely for their right to use this frequency for broadcasting an FM audio carrier signal along with an ATSC 3.0 digital signal broadcasting programming. For the same reason, assignment restrictions between TV stations on channel 6 and nearby FM stations are stringent: there is only one station in the United States (CSN International translator K200AA in Sun Valley, Nevada) licensed to operate on 87.9 MHz, because it was forced off of another channel. Therefore, in effect, the FM broadcast band comprises only FM channels 201 (88.1 MHz) through 300 (107.9 MHz).

Originally, FM stations in a market were generally spaced four channels (800 kHz) apart. This spacing was developed in response to problems perceived on the original FM band, mostly due to deficiencies in receiver technology of the time. With modern equipment, this is widely understood to be unnecessary, and in many countries shorter spacings are used. (See FM broadcast band.) Other spacing restrictions relate to mixing products with nearby television, air-traffic control, and two-way radio systems as well as other FM broadcast stations. The most significant such taboo restricts the allocation of stations 10.6 and 10.8 MHz apart, to protect against mixing products which will interfere with an FM receiver&#x27;s standard 10.7 MHz intermediate frequency stage.

Commercial broadcasting is licensed only on channels 221 through 300 (the upper 80 channels, frequencies between 92.1 and 107.9 MHz), with 200 through 220 (the lower 21 channels, frequencies between 87.9 and 91.9 MHz) reserved for non-commercial educational (NCE) broadcasting. In some &quot;Twin city&quot; markets close to the Canada–United States or Mexico–United States border, such as Detroit, Michigan, and Windsor, Ontario, or San Diego, California, and Tijuana, Baja California, commercial stations operating from those countries target U.S. audiences on &quot;reserved band&quot; channels, as neither Canada nor Mexico has such a reservation. Because of this necessary sharing, the FCC reserves a few other channels for such NCE stations.

FM stations in the U.S. are now assigned based on a table of separation distance values from currently licensed stations, based on station &quot;class&quot; (power output, antenna height, and geographical location). These regulations (see Docket 80-90) have resulted in approximately double the number of possible stations, and increases in allowable power levels, over the original bandplan scheme described above. All powers are specified as effective radiated power (ERP), which takes into account the magnifying effect (gain) of certain antenna types.

The U.S. is divided into Zone I (roughly the northeastern quarter of the U.S. mainland, excluding the far northern areas), Zone I-A (California south of 40 degrees latitude, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico), and Zone II (all other locations). The highest-power stations are class C in zone II, and class B in the others. There are no B stations in zone II, nor any C stations in the others. (See the list of broadcast station classes.) Canada is also divided in this manner, based on the most highly populated regions.

High power is useful in penetrating buildings, diffracting around hills, and refracting for some distance beyond the horizon. 100,000-watt FM stations can regularly be heard up to 100 miles (160 km) away, and farther (e.g., 150 miles, 240 km) if there are no competing signals.

A few old &quot;grandfathered&quot; stations do not conform to these power rules. WBCT (93.7) in Grand Rapids, Michigan, runs 320,000 watts ERP, and can increase to 500,000 watts ERP by the terms of its original license. This huge power level does not usually help to increase range as much as one might expect, because VHF frequencies travel in nearly straight lines over the horizon and off into space. Nevertheless, when there were fewer FM stations competing, this station could be heard near Bloomington, Illinois, almost distant.
