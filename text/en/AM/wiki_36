<text>Philip St. John Basil Rathbone MC (13 June 1892 – 21 July 1967) was an Anglo-South African actor. He rose to prominence in the United Kingdom as a Shakespearean stage actor and went on to appear in more than 70 films, primarily costume dramas, swashbucklers, and, occasionally, horror films.

Rathbone frequently portrayed suave villains or morally ambiguous characters, such as Mr. Murdstone in &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1935), Tybalt in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1936) and Sir Guy of Gisbourne in &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938). His most famous role was that of Sherlock Holmes in fourteen Hollywood films made between 1939 and 1946 and in a radio series.

Rathbone&#x27;s later career included roles on Broadway, as well as self-ironic film and television work. In 1948, he shared the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play with two others. He was also nominated for two Academy Awards and honoured with three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
Rathbone was born in Johannesburg, South African Republic, to British parents. His mother, Anna Barbara (&quot;née&quot; George), was a violinist, and his father, Edgar Philip Rathbone, was a mining engineer and scion of the Liverpool Rathbone family. He had two older half-brothers, Harold and Horace, as well as two younger siblings, Beatrice and John. Basil was the great-grandson of the noted Victorian philanthropist, William Rathbone V, and thus a descendant of William Rathbone II.

The Rathbones fled to Britain when Basil was three years old after his father was accused by the Boers of being a spy following the Jameson Raid. Rathbone attended Repton School in Derbyshire from 1906 to 1910, where he excelled at sports and was given the nickname &quot;Ratters&quot; by schoolmates. Thereafter, he was briefly employed as an insurance clerk by the Liverpool and Globe Insurance Companies, to appease his father&#x27;s wish for him to have a conventional career.

On 22 April 1911, Rathbone made his first appearance on stage at the Theatre Royal, Ipswich, Suffolk, as Hortensio in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, with his cousin Sir Frank Benson&#x27;s No. 2 Company, under the direction of Henry Herbert. In October 1912, he went to the United States with Benson&#x27;s company, playing roles such as Paris in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Fenton in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, and Silvius in &quot;As You Like It&quot;. Returning to Britain, he made his first appearance in London at the Savoy Theatre on 9 July 1914, as Finch in &quot;The Sin of David&quot;. That December, he appeared at the Shaftesbury Theatre as the Dauphin in &quot;Henry V&quot;. During 1915, he toured with Benson and appeared with him at London&#x27;s Court Theatre in December as Lysander in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

==Military service==
During the First World War (in 1915), Rathbone was called up via the Derby Scheme into the British Army as a private with the London Scottish Regiment, joining a regiment that also included his future professional acting contemporaries Claude Rains, Herbert Marshall and Ronald Colman at different points during the conflict. After basic training with the London Scots in early 1916, he received a commission as a lieutenant in the 2/10th Battalion of the King&#x27;s Liverpool Regiment (Liverpool Scottish), where he served as an intelligence officer, eventually attaining the rank of captain. Rathbone was a two-time British Army Fencing Champion; a skill that served him well in the movies, it allowed him to teach swordsmanship to actors Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power.

Rathbone was deeply affected by the news his younger brother John, a captain in the Dorsetshire Regiment, had been killed in action near Arras on 4 June 1918. In 2012, two letters Rathbone wrote to his family while serving on the Western Front were published. One reveals the anguish and anger he felt following the death of John:

I want to tell him to mind his place. I think of his ridiculous belief that everything would always be well, his ever-hopeful smile, and I want to cuff him for a little fool. He had no business to let it happen and it maddens me that I shall never be able to tell him so, or change it or bring him back. I can&#x27;t think of him without being consumed with anger at him for being dead and beyond anything I can do to him.
:— 26 July 1918

Following his brother&#x27;s death, Rathbone appears to have become unconcerned about the dangers of serving at the front. Author Richard Van Emden in &quot;Famous 1914–18&quot; speculates that his extreme bravery may have been a form of guilt or need for vengeance. He persuaded his superiors to allow him to scout enemy positions during daylight rather than at night, as was the usual practice to minimise the chance of detection. Rathbone wore a special camouflage suit that resembled a tree with a wreath of freshly plucked foliage on his head with burnt cork applied to his hands and face. As a result of these highly dangerous daylight reconnaissance missions in September 1918, he was awarded the Military Cross for &quot;conspicuous daring and resource on patrol&quot;.

==Career==
=== Theatre ===
During the Summer Festival of 1919, he appeared at Stratford-upon-Avon with the New Shakespeare Company playing Romeo, Cassius, Ferdinand in &quot;The Tempest&quot; and Florizel in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;; in October he was at London&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Theatre as the aide de camp in &quot;Napoleon&quot;, and in February 1920 he was at the Savoy Theatre in the title role in &quot;Peter Ibbetson&quot; with huge success.

During the 1920s, Rathbone appeared regularly in Shakespearean and other roles on the British stage. He began to travel and appeared at the Cort Theatre, New York, in October 1923 in a production of Molnár&#x27;s play &quot;The Swan&quot; opposite Eva Le Gallienne, which made him a star on Broadway. He toured in the United States in 1925, appearing in San Francisco in May and the Lyceum Theatre, New York, in October. He was in the US again in 1927 and 1930 and again in 1931, when he appeared on stage with Ethel Barrymore. He continued his stage career in Britain, returning late in 1934 to the US, where he appeared with Katharine Cornell in several plays.

Rathbone was once arrested in 1926 along with every other member of the cast of &quot;The Captive&quot;, a play in which his character&#x27;s wife left him for another woman. Though the charges were eventually dropped, Rathbone was very angry about the censorship because he believed that homosexuality needed to be brought into the open.
=== Film ===
He commenced his film career in Hollywood in 1921 in silent movies and appeared in 1923&#x27;s &#x27;, and in &quot;The Masked Bride&quot;, plus a few other silents. His sound debut was in the first screen adaptation of Frederick Lonsdale&#x27;s play opposite Norma Shearer, which was his last appearance as a romantic leading man. He portrayed detective Philo Vance in the 1930 film &#x27;, based on the best-selling novel. In the film, there is a coincidental reference to Sherlock Holmes. Like George Sanders and Vincent Price after him, Rathbone made a name for himself in the 1930s by playing suave villains in costume dramas and swashbucklers, including as the abusive stepfather Mr. Murdstone; as her distant husband, Karenin; as Pontius Pilate; ; , as the Marquis St. Evremonde; &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938) playing his best-remembered villain, Sir Guy of Gisbourne; &quot;The Adventures of Marco Polo&quot; (1938); and as Captain Esteban Pasquale. He also appeared in several early horror films: , as Richard III, and &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot; (1939), portraying the dedicated surgeon Baron Wolf von Frankenstein, son of the monster&#x27;s creator, and, in 1949, was also the narrator for the segment &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; in the Disney animated feature, &quot;The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad&quot;.

He was admired for his athletic swordsmanship. (He listed fencing among his favourite recreations.) His character lost to Errol Flynn twice: in a duel on the beach in &quot;Captain Blood&quot; and in an elaborate fight sequence in &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;. He was also involved in noteworthy sword fights in &quot;Tower of London&quot;, &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;, and &quot;The Court Jester.&quot;
Rathbone earned Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performances as Tybalt in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1936) and as King Louis XI in &quot;If I Were King&quot; (1938). In , he played one of his few heroic roles in the 1930s, as a Royal Flying Corps (RFC) squadron commander brought to the brink of a nervous breakdown by the strain and guilt of sending his battle-weary pilots off to near-certain death in the skies of 1915 France. Errol Flynn, Rathbone&#x27;s perennial foe, starred in the film as his successor when Rathbone&#x27;s character is promoted.

According to Hollywood legend, Rathbone was Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s first choice to play Rhett Butler in the film version of her novel &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Rathbone actively campaigned for the role.

Despite his film success, Rathbone always insisted that he wished to be remembered for his stage career. He said that his favourite role was Romeo.

===The Sherlock Holmes films===
Rathbone is most widely recognised for his many portrayals of Sherlock Holmes. In a radio interview, Rathbone recalled that Twentieth Century-Fox producer and director Gene Markey, lunching with producer-director-actor Gregory Ratoff and 20th Century-Fox mogul Daryl Zanuck at Lucey&#x27;s Restaurant in Hollywood, proposed a film version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;. When asked who could possibly play Holmes, Markey incredulously replied, &quot;Who?! Basil Rathbone!&quot; The film was so successful that Fox produced a sequel that appeared later in 1939. Interest in Holmes cooled at Fox, but Universal Pictures picked up the character, and produced 12 Holmes features from 1942 to 1946. All of the Fox and Universal features co-starred Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson.

The first two films, &#x27; and &#x27; (both produced by Fox in 1939), were set in the late Victorian times of the original stories. The later instalments, produced by Universal, beginning with &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror&quot; (1942), were set in contemporary times, with the first three having World War II-related plots.

Concurrent with the films, Rathbone and Bruce reprised their film roles in the radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which began in October 1939. Rathbone appeared in the radio series as long as the film series was active, but, after the films lapsed in 1946, Rathbone ceded his radio part to Tom Conway. Conway and Bruce carried on with the series for two seasons, until both dropped out in July 1947.

The many Holmes sequels typecast Rathbone, and he was unable to free himself from the shadow of the Great Detective, despite appearing in other film roles. Resenting the typecasting, Rathbone refused to renew his contract at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and returned to Broadway. In later years, Rathbone willingly made the Holmes association, as in a TV sketch with Milton Berle in the early 1950s, in which he donned the deerstalker cap and Inverness cape. In the 1960s, dressed as Holmes, he appeared in a series of TV commercials for Getz Exterminators (&quot;Getz gets &#x27;em, since 1888!&#x27;&quot;).

Rathbone also brought Holmes to the stage in a play written by his wife Ouida. Thomas Gomez, who had appeared as a Nazi ringleader in &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror&quot;, played the villainous Professor Moriarty. Nigel Bruce was slated to portray Dr Watson once more but became too ill and the part was played by character actor Jack Raine. Bruce&#x27;s absence depressed Rathbone, particularly after Bruce died on 8 October 1953, while the play was in rehearsals. The play ran for only three performances.

===Later career===
In the 1950s, Rathbone appeared in two spoofs of his earlier swashbuckling villains: &quot;Casanova&#x27;s Big Night&quot; (1954) opposite Bob Hope and &quot;The Court Jester&quot; (1956) with Danny Kaye. He appeared frequently on TV game shows and continued to appear in major films, including the Humphrey Bogart comedy and John Ford&#x27;s political drama .

Rathbone also appeared on Broadway numerous times in this period. In 1948, he shared the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performance as the unyielding Dr. Austin Sloper in the original production of &quot;The Heiress&quot; with Henry Fonda in &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; and Paul Kelly in &quot;Command Decision&quot;. He also received accolades for his performance in Archibald Macleish&#x27;s &quot;J.B.&quot;, a modernisation of the Biblical trials of Job.

Through the 1950s and 1960s, he continued to appear in several dignified anthology programmes on television. To support his second wife&#x27;s lavish tastes, he appeared as a panelist on the television game show &quot;The Name&#x27;s the Same&quot; (in 1954), and took roles in cheap film thrillers of far lesser quality, such as &quot;The Black Sleep&quot; (1956), &quot;Queen of Blood&quot; (1966), &quot;The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini&quot; (1966, wherein the character &#x27;Eric Von Zipper&#x27; played by Harvey Lembeck jokes, &quot;That guy looks like Sherlock Holmes&quot;), &quot;Hillbillys in a Haunted House&quot; (1967, also featuring Lon Chaney Jr and John Carradine), and his last film, a low-budget, horror film called &quot;Autopsy of a Ghost&quot; (1968).

He is also known for his spoken word recordings, including his interpretation of Clement C. Moore&#x27;s &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;. Rathbone&#x27;s readings of the stories and poems of Edgar Allan Poe are collected together with readings by Vincent Price in Caedmon Audio&#x27;s &quot;The Edgar Allan Poe Audio Collection&quot; on CD.

In four Caedmon albums, Rathbone revisited his characterization of Sherlock Holmes. The first, &quot;The Speckled Band&quot; (Caedmon Records TC 1172, recorded in 1963), is a straight narration of the tale. In the rest, he changes his voice for each character, including a rendition of Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson.

Rathbone also made many other recordings, including &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; (with Leopold Stokowski conducting), and Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

On television, he appeared in two musical versions of Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;: one in 1954, in which he played Marley&#x27;s Ghost opposite Fredric March&#x27;s Scrooge, and the original 1956 live action version of &quot;The Stingiest Man In Town&quot;, in which he starred as a singing Ebenezer Scrooge.

In the 1960s, he toured with a one-man show, &quot;In and Out of Character&quot; (the same title as his autobiography). He recited poetry and Shakespeare, accented by reminiscences from his life and career (including the humorous, &quot;I could have killed Errol Flynn any time I wanted to!&quot;). As an encore, he recited &quot;221B&quot;, a poem written by writer-critic Vincent Starrett, one of the preeminent members of the Baker Street Irregulars whom Rathbone held in high regard.

Price and Rathbone appeared together, along with Boris Karloff, in &quot;Tower of London&quot; (1939) and &quot;The Comedy of Terrors&quot; (1963). The latter was the only film to feature the &quot;Big Four&quot; of American International Pictures&#x27; horror films: Price, Rathbone, Karloff and Peter Lorre. Rathbone appeared with Price in the final segment of Roger Corman&#x27;s 1962 anthology film &quot;Tales of Terror&quot;, a loose dramatisation of Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar&quot;.

In 1965, Belmont Books issued the anthology &quot;Basil Rathbone Selects Strange Tales&quot;, a collection of horror stories by Poe, Hawthorne, Bulwer-Lytton, Charles Dickens, Allston Collins, Le Fanu, and Wilkie Collins. The volume features a cover portrait of Rathbone; however, the back cover&#x27;s legend &quot;Produced by Lyle Kenyon Engel&quot; indicates the anthology probably was not edited by Rathbone. Canadian editor and book packager Engel packaged shows and magazines for other horror stars, including Boris Karloff.

Basil Rathbone has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for films at 6549 Hollywood Boulevard; one for radio at 6300 Hollywood Boulevard; and one for television at 6915 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood.

==Personal life==
Rathbone married actress Ethel Marion Foreman (1887–1976) in 1914. They had one son, Rodion Rathbone (1915–1996), who had a brief Hollywood career under the name John Rodion. The couple divorced in 1926. In the same year, he married writer Ouida Bergère; their infant child died in 1928. In 1939, the couple adopted a daughter, Cynthia Rathbone (1939–1969). The American actor Jackson Rathbone is a distant relation.

Rathbone bore a strong resemblance to his cousin, the actor Frank Benson. He was a first cousin once-removed of the British campaigning independent MP Eleanor Rathbone.

During Rathbone&#x27;s Hollywood career, Ouida Rathbone, who was also her husband&#x27;s business manager, developed a reputation for hosting elaborate and expensive parties in their home, with many prominent and influential people on the guest lists. This trend inspired a joke in &quot;The Ghost Breakers&quot; (1940), a film in which Rathbone does not appear: during a tremendous thunderstorm in New York City, Bob Hope observed that &quot;Basil Rathbone must be throwing a party&quot;. Actress Mrs Patrick Campbell described Rathbone as &quot;two profiles pasted together&quot;. As cited in the same autobiography, Mrs Campbell later referred to him as &quot;a folded umbrella taking elocution lessons&quot;.

He was a devout Episcopalian and a member of the Episcopal Actors Guild.

==Death==
Rathbone died suddenly of a heart attack in New York City on 21 July 1967 at the age of 75. His body was interred in a crypt in the Shrine of Memories Mausoleum at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.

<text>Frank Washington Jarvis (August 31, 1878 in California, Pennsylvania – June 2, 1933 in Sewickley, Pennsylvania) was an American athlete, and the Olympic 100 m champion of 1900.

== Biography ==
Jarvis, an AAU champion in the 100 y, was among the pre-race favourites for the 100 m at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, but the hot favourite was American Arthur Duffey, who had just beaten Jarvis at the British AAA Championships in the 100 yards event at the 1900 AAA Championships prior to the Games.

In the heats, however, Jarvis and another American, Walter Tewksbury, posted times of 10.8, equaling the World Record. All three Americans qualified for the final, complemented by Stan Rowley of Australia. After a close first half of the final race, leading Duffey pulled a muscle, fell, and retired the race, leaving the three others to decide for the victory—Jarvis won.

At the same Olympics, Jarvis also competed in the triple jump and the standing triple jump (with no run-up), but did not achieve top classifications.

After his running career, Jarvis became a lawyer.

<text>In computing, a desktop environment (DE) is an implementation of the desktop metaphor made of a bundle of programs running on top of a computer operating system that share a common graphical user interface (GUI), sometimes described as a graphical shell. The desktop environment was seen mostly on personal computers until the rise of mobile computing. Desktop GUIs help the user to easily access and edit files, while they usually do not provide access to all of the features found in the underlying operating system. Instead, the traditional command-line interface (CLI) is still used when full control over the operating system is required.

A desktop environment typically consists of icons, windows, toolbars, folders, wallpapers and desktop widgets (see Elements of graphical user interfaces and WIMP). A GUI might also provide drag and drop functionality and other features that make the desktop metaphor more complete. A desktop environment aims to be an intuitive way for the user to interact with the computer using concepts which are similar to those used when interacting with the physical world, such as buttons and windows.

While the term &quot;desktop environment&quot; originally described a style of user interfaces following the desktop metaphor, it has also come to describe the programs that realize the metaphor itself. This usage has been popularized by projects such as the Common Desktop Environment, KDE, and
GNOME.

== Implementation ==
On a system that offers a desktop environment, a window manager in conjunction with applications written using a widget toolkit are generally responsible for most of what the user sees. The window manager supports the user interactions with the environment, while the toolkit provides developers a software library for applications with a unified look and behavior.

A windowing system of some sort generally interfaces directly with the underlying operating system and libraries. This provides support for graphical hardware, pointing devices, and keyboards. The window manager generally runs on top of this windowing system. While the windowing system may provide some window management functionality, this functionality is still considered to be part of the window manager, which simply happens to have been provided by the windowing system.

Applications that are created with a particular window manager in mind usually make use of a windowing toolkit, generally provided with the operating system or window manager. A windowing toolkit gives applications access to widgets that allow the user to interact graphically with the application in a consistent way.

== History and common use ==

The first desktop environment was created by Xerox and was sold with the Xerox Alto in the 1970s. The Alto was generally considered by Xerox to be a personal office computer; it failed in the marketplace because of poor marketing and a very high price tag. With the Lisa, Apple introduced a desktop environment on an affordable personal computer, which also failed in the market.

The desktop metaphor was popularized on commercial personal computers by the original Macintosh from Apple in 1984, and was popularized further by Windows from Microsoft since the 1990s. , the most popular desktop environments are descendants of these earlier environments, including the Windows shell used in Microsoft Windows, and the Aqua environment used in macOS. When compared with the X-based desktop environments available for Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and BSD, the proprietary desktop environments included with Windows and macOS have relatively fixed layouts and static features, with highly integrated &quot;seamless&quot; designs that aim to provide mostly consistent customer experiences across installations.

Microsoft Windows dominates in marketshare among personal computers with a desktop environment. Computers using Unix-like operating systems such as macOS, ChromeOS, Linux, BSD or Solaris are much less common; however, there is a growing market for low-cost Linux PCs using the X Window System or Wayland with a broad choice of desktop environments. Among the more popular of these are Google&#x27;s Chromebooks and Chromeboxes, Intel&#x27;s NUC, the Raspberry Pi, etc.

On tablets and smartphones, the situation is the opposite, with Unix-like operating systems dominating the market, including the iOS (BSD-derived), Android, Tizen, Sailfish and Ubuntu (all Linux-derived). Microsoft&#x27;s Windows phone, Windows RT and Windows 10 are used on a much smaller number of tablets and smartphones. However, the majority of Unix-like operating systems dominant on handheld devices do not use the X11 desktop environments used by other Unix-like operating systems, relying instead on interfaces based on other technologies.

== Desktop environments for the X Window System ==


On systems running the X Window System (typically Unix-family systems such as Linux, the BSDs, and formal UNIX distributions), desktop environments are much more dynamic and customizable to meet user needs. In this context, a desktop environment typically consists of several separate components, including a window manager (such as Mutter or KWin), a file manager (such as Files or Dolphin), a set of graphical themes, together with toolkits (such as GTK+ and Qt) and libraries for managing the desktop. All these individual modules can be exchanged and independently configured to suit users, but most desktop environments provide a default configuration that works with minimal user setup.

Some window managerssuch as IceWM, Fluxbox, Openbox, ROX Desktop and Window Makercontain relatively sparse desktop environment elements, such as an integrated spatial file manager, while others like evilwm and wmii do not provide such elements. Not all of the program code that is part of a desktop environment has effects which are directly visible to the user. Some of it may be low-level code. KDE, for example, provides so-called KIO slaves which give the user access to a wide range of virtual devices. These I/O slaves are not available outside the KDE environment.

In 1996 the KDE was announced, followed in 1997 by the announcement of GNOME. Xfce is a smaller project that was also founded in 1996, and focuses on speed and modularity, just like LXDE which was started in 2006. A comparison of X Window System desktop environments demonstrates the differences between environments. GNOME and KDE were usually seen as dominant solutions, and these are still often installed by default on Linux systems. Each of them offers:
* To programmers, a set of standard APIs, a programming environment, and human interface guidelines.
* To translators, a collaboration infrastructure. KDE and GNOME are available in many languages.
* To artists, a workspace to share their talents.
* To ergonomics specialists, the chance to help simplify the working environment.
* To developers of third-party applications, a reference environment for integration. OpenOffice.org is one such application.
* To users, a complete desktop environment and a suite of essential applications. These include a file manager, web browser, multimedia player, email client, address book, PDF reader, photo manager, and system preferences application.

In the early 2000s, KDE reached maturity. The Appeal and ToPaZ projects focused on bringing new advances to the next major releases of both KDE and GNOME respectively. Although striving for broadly similar goals, GNOME and KDE do differ in their approach to user ergonomics. KDE encourages applications to integrate and interoperate, is highly customizable, and contains many complex features, all whilst trying to establish sensible defaults. GNOME on the other hand is more prescriptive, and focuses on the finer details of essential tasks and overall simplification. Accordingly, each one attracts a different user and developer community. Technically, there are numerous technologies common to all Unix-like desktop environments, most obviously the X Window System. Accordingly, the freedesktop.org project was established as an informal collaboration zone with the goal being to reduce duplication of effort.

As GNOME and KDE focus on high-performance computers, users of less powerful or older computers often prefer alternative desktop environments specifically created for low-performance systems. Most commonly used lightweight desktop environments include LXDE and Xfce; they both use GTK+, which is the same underlying toolkit GNOME uses. The MATE desktop environment, a fork of GNOME 2, is comparable to Xfce in its use of RAM and processor cycles, but is often considered more as an alternative to other lightweight desktop environments.

For a while, GNOME and KDE enjoyed the status of the most popular Linux desktop environments; later, other desktop environments grew in popularity. In April 2011, GNOME introduced a new interface concept with its version 3, while a popular Linux distribution Ubuntu introduced its own new desktop environment, Unity. Some users preferred to keep the traditional interface concept of GNOME 2, resulting in the creation of MATE as a GNOME 2 fork.

== Examples of desktop environments ==
The most common desktop environment on personal computers is Windows Shell in Microsoft Windows. Microsoft has made significant efforts in making Windows shell visually pleasing. As a result, Microsoft has introduced theme support in Windows 98, the various Windows XP visual styles, the Aero brand in Windows Vista, the Microsoft design language (codenamed &quot;Metro&quot;) in Windows 8, and the Fluent Design System and Windows Spotlight in Windows 10. Windows shell can be extended via Shell extensions.

Many mainstream desktop environments for Unix-like operating systems, including KDE, GNOME, Xfce, and LXDE, use the X Window System or Wayland, any of which may be selected by users, and are not tied exclusively to the operating system in use. The desktop environment for macOS, which is also a Unix-like system, is Aqua, which uses the Quartz graphics layer, rather than using X or Wayland.

A number of other desktop environments also exist, including (but not limited to) CDE, EDE, GEM, IRIX Interactive Desktop, Sun&#x27;s Java Desktop System, Jesktop, Mezzo, Project Looking Glass, ROX Desktop, UDE, Xito, XFast. Moreover, there exists FVWM-Crystal, which consists of a powerful configuration for the FVWM window manager, a theme and further adds, altogether forming a &quot;construction kit&quot; for building up a desktop environment.

X window managers that are meant to be usable stand-alone — without another desktop environment — also include elements reminiscent of those found in typical desktop environments, most prominently Enlightenment. Other examples include OpenBox, Fluxbox, WindowLab, Fvwm, as well as Window Maker and AfterStep, which both feature the NeXTSTEP GUI look and feel. However newer versions of some operating systems make self configure.

The Amiga approach to desktop environment was noteworthy: the original Workbench desktop environment in AmigaOS evolved through time to originate an entire family of descendants and alternative desktop solutions. Some of those descendants are the Scalos, the Ambient desktop of MorphOS, and the Wanderer desktop of the AROS open source OS. WindowLab also contains features reminiscent of the Amiga UI. Third-party Directory Opus software, which was originally just a navigational file manager program, evolved to become a complete Amiga desktop replacement called Directory Opus Magellan.

OS/2 (and derivatives such as eComStation and ArcaOS) use the Workplace Shell. Earlier versions of OS/2 used the Presentation Manager.

The BumpTop project was an experimental desktop environment. Its main objective is to replace the 2D paradigm with a &quot;real-world&quot; 3D implementation, where documents can be freely manipulated across a virtual table.

<doc id="68335" wikidata="Q180710" url="?curid=68335" title="Anna Nicole Smith">
<text>Vickie Lynn Marshall (née Hogan; November 28, 1967 – February 8, 2007), known professionally as Anna Nicole Smith, was an American model, actress, and television personality. Smith started her career as a &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine centerfold in May 1992 and won the title of 1993 Playmate of the Year. She later modeled for fashion companies, including Guess, H&amp;M, Lane Bryant, Conair, and Heatherette.

Smith dropped out of high school in 1984, married in 1985, and divorced in 1993. In 1994, her highly publicized second marriage to 89-year-old billionaire J. Howard Marshall resulted in speculation that she married him for his money, which she denied. Following Marshall&#x27;s death in 1995, Smith began a lengthy legal battle over a share of his estate. Her cases reached the Supreme Court of the United States: &quot;Marshall v. Marshall&quot; on a question of federal jurisdiction and &quot;Stern v. Marshall&quot; on a question of bankruptcy court authority. Smith died in February 2007 in Hollywood, Florida, of a combined drug intoxication.

==Early life==
Smith was born Vickie Lynn Hogan on November 28, 1967, in Houston, Texas, the only daughter of Virgie Tabers Arthur (1951–2018) and Donald Eugene Hogan (1947–2009). Smith attended Mexia High School, in Mexia, Texas, transferring there from a Houston school. She attended at least one semester of ninth grade in Mexia but did not complete a whole term of tenth grade. She had five half-siblings on her father&#x27;s side. Smith was primarily raised by her mother and her family in Mexia.

==Career==
===Modeling===
Smith secured a contract to replace supermodel Claudia Schiffer in a Guess jeans advertisement campaign featuring a series of sultry black-and-white photographs. During the Guess campaign, she took on the stage name &quot;Anna Nicole&quot;. Guess photographers noticed Smith bore a striking resemblance to Jayne Mansfield and showcased her in several Mansfield-inspired photo sessions. In 1993, she modeled for the Swedish clothing company H&amp;M, which led to her picture being displayed on large billboards in Sweden and Norway. Smith was featured on the cover of &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, shot by Peter Lindbergh in October 1993, and in &quot;GQ&quot; magazine.
===Endorsements===
In October 2003, she became a spokeswoman for TrimSpa, which allegedly helped her lose a reported . TrimSpa diet product company and Smith were sued in a class-action lawsuit alleging their marketing of a weight loss pill was false or misleading. TrimSpa filed for bankruptcy after Smith&#x27;s death and was liquidated. 
In March 2005, at the first MTV Australia Video Music Awards in Sydney&#x27;s Luna Park, Smith spoofed Janet Jackson&#x27;s wardrobe malfunction by pulling down her dress to reveal both breasts, each covered with the MTV logo.

==Personal life==
While working at Jim&#x27;s Krispy Fried Chicken in Mexia, Smith met Billy Wayne Smith, a cook at the restaurant, and the couple married on April 4, 1985, when he was 16 and she was 17. She gave birth to their son, Daniel Wayne Smith, on January 22, 1986. Smith and her husband separated the following year, and divorced in 1993. 

While performing at a Houston strip club in October 1991, Smith met 86-year-old petroleum tycoon J. Howard Marshall. On June 27, 1994, Smith and Marshall were married in Houston, resulting in speculation that she married him for his money. Marshall died on August 4, 1995, in Houston, at the age of 90.

===Court cases and bankruptcy===

In October 1994, Smith initiated a $5 million lawsuit against the &quot;New York&quot; magazine, claiming that she did not authorize the use of her photo on the cover of its magazine titled &quot;White Trash Nation&quot; and that the article damaged her reputation. The lawsuit was settled.

Even though Smith was not in Marshall&#x27;s will, she claimed that in return for marriage, Marshall verbally promised her half of his estate, which primarily consisted of a 16% interest in Koch Industries, then worth $1.6 billion. Smith&#x27;s stepson E. Pierce Marshall disputed the claim. Smith temporarily joined forces with J. Howard&#x27;s other son, J. Howard Marshall III, who was disowned after attempting to take control of Koch Industries. Howard III also claimed that his father had verbally promised him a portion of the estate; like Smith, Howard III was also left out of his father&#x27;s will.

In 1996, Smith filed for bankruptcy in California as a result of an $850,000 default judgment against her for the sexual harassment of a nanny who cared for her son. Since any money potentially due to her from the Marshall estate was part of her potential assets, the bankruptcy court involved itself in the matter.

In September 2000, a Los Angeles bankruptcy judge awarded Smith $449,754,134.00, the amount that Marshall&#x27;s interest in Koch Industries appreciated during their marriage. However, in July 2001, Houston judge Mike Wood affirmed the jury&#x27;s findings in the probate case by ruling that Smith was entitled to nothing. The judge ordered Smith to pay over $1 million to cover the legal costs and expenses of E. Pierce Marshall. The conflict between the Texas probate court and California bankruptcy court judgments forced the matter into federal court.

In March 2002, a federal judge vacated the California bankruptcy court&#x27;s ruling and issued a new ruling that reduced the award to $88 million. On December 30, 2004, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed that decision on the grounds that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction to overrule the probate court&#x27;s decision. 

In September 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to hear the appeal of that decision. The George W. Bush administration directed Paul Clement, the United States Solicitor General, to intercede on Smith&#x27;s behalf in the interest of expanding federal court jurisdiction over state probate disputes. On May 1, 2006, the Supreme Court unanimously decided in favor of Smith. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the opinion. The decision did not give Smith a portion of her husband&#x27;s estate, but affirmed her right to pursue a share of it in federal court.

On June 20, 2006, E. Pierce Marshall died at age 67 from an infection. His widow and estate executrix Elaine Tettemer Marshall, pursued the case on behalf of his estate. After Smith&#x27;s death in 2007, the case continued on behalf of Smith&#x27;s infant daughter, Dannielynn Birkhead. In March 2010, an appeals court upheld the verdict barring Smith from the estate. Following the decision, lawyers for Smith&#x27;s estate appealed the decision to the entire Ninth Circuit. On May 6, 2010, the appeal was denied. 

In June 2011, in the case of &quot;Stern v. Marshall&quot;, the Supreme Court issued a ruling against Smith&#x27;s estate, stating that the California bankruptcy court decision that gave her estate $475 million was made without subject-matter jurisdiction. The court agreed with the ruling of the Ninth Circuit that a bankruptcy court could not make a decision on an issue outside bankruptcy law. In August 2014, David O. Carter, a federal U.S. District Court judge in Orange County, California, rejected efforts to obtain about $44 million from the J. Howard Marshall estate.

===Birth of daughter===
A psychiatrist said she met with Smith in April 2006 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles while she was pregnant with her daughter, and that she believed that Smith had borderline personality disorder, and was addicted to prescription medications. 

On June 1, 2006, Smith announced her pregnancy in a video clip on her official website. She gave birth to a daughter, Dannielynn, on September 7, 2006, in New Providence, The Bahamas. In an interview on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; after the death of Smith&#x27;s son, attorney Howard K. Stern said that he and Smith had been in a relationship for &quot;a very long time&quot; and said he was the father. Entertainment photographer Larry Birkhead claimed that he was the baby&#x27;s father and filed a lawsuit to establish paternity. The Bahamian birth certificate recorded the father as Stern.

A judge in the United States ordered that DNA paternity tests be performed to determine Dannielynn&#x27;s biological father. Following Smith&#x27;s death, Birkhead&#x27;s attorney asked for an emergency DNA sample to be taken from Smith&#x27;s body. The request was denied by a judge who ordered that her body be preserved until February 20.

On February 9, 2007, Zsa Zsa Gabor&#x27;s husband, Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt, stated that he had had a decade-long affair with Smith and could potentially be the father of her daughter. Smith&#x27;s former bodyguard and chef, Alexander Denk, also claimed that he had an affair with Smith and that he, too, was potentially the father.

After Smith&#x27;s death, the TMZ website reported that she had been given a prescription for methadone under a false name while she was in her eighth month of pregnancy. The Medical Board of California launched a review into the matter. The prescribing doctor, Sandeep Kapoor, said the treatment he had administered was &quot;sound and appropriate&quot;.

In April 2007, a Bahamian judge ruled that DNA tests had established Birkhead as the biological father. Birkhead subsequently applied for an amended birth certificate listing him as Dannielynn&#x27;s father, paving the way for him to obtain a passport for the baby to leave with him for the United States. Stern did not contest the DNA results or the ruling, and Birkhead returned to the United States with the baby. Smith&#x27;s mother, Virgie Arthur, appealed the ruling, but her appeal was denied and she was ordered to pay costs.

===Death of son===
On September 10, 2006, Smith&#x27;s 20-year-old son Daniel Wayne Smith died in his mother&#x27;s hospital room while visiting her and his half sister Dannielynn, who was born three days earlier on September 7. An autopsy found that Daniel had died from a combination of drugs, including methadone and antidepressants. A Bahamian jury determined that he had died from an accidental drug overdose and recommended no criminal charges.
A death certificate was issued on September 21, 2006. Daniel was buried at Lake View Cemetery in New Providence on October 19, 2006.

According to Stern, Smith was devastated by her son&#x27;s death. &quot;Anna and Daniel were inseparable. Daniel was without question the most important person in Anna&#x27;s life,&quot; Stern said during his testimony at the trial regarding the right to control disposition of Smith&#x27;s remains. &quot;At Daniel&#x27;s funeral, she had them open the coffin and tried to climb inside. She said that &#x27;if Daniel has to be buried, I want to be buried with him.&#x27; She was ready to go down with him.&quot; Stern said that, &quot;Anna saw herself as both mother and father to Daniel. From the time I met her, everything was for Daniel. I would say that physically, she died last week, but in a lot of ways, emotionally she died when Daniel died.&quot;

===Commitment ceremony with Stern===
On September 28, 2006, Smith and Stern exchanged vows and rings in an informal commitment ceremony in the Bahamas. Although they pledged their love and made a commitment to be there for each other before a Baptist minister, no marriage certificate was issued and the ceremony did not create a legal marriage. Regarding the questionable timing of the ceremony, Smith&#x27;s attorney in Nassau said, &quot;They needed a little adrenaline boost because things have been so hectic and devastating in their life recently.&quot; Ceremony photos were sold through Getty Images to &quot;People&quot; magazine for $1 million.

===Residency in the Bahamas===
Smith and Stern were reportedly staying in the Bahamas to avoid paternity testing of her daughter in the United States. In late 2006, Smith was granted permanent resident status in the Bahamas by Immigration Minister Shane Gibson. A local newspaper published photographs showing Smith lying clothed in bed in an embrace with Gibson. Gibson resigned after the wave of controversy over his relationship with Smith.

The basis of Smith&#x27;s permanent residency status was the claim that she owned a $900,000 mansion, which she said was given to her by a former boyfriend, real estate developer Gaither Ben Thompson of South Carolina. Thompson asserted that he loaned Smith the finances to purchase the property, which she failed to repay, and that he was attempting to regain control of it. Thompson sued to evict Smith from the property in the Bahamas Court and received a default judgment against her. It was claimed that methadone was found in Smith&#x27;s bedroom refrigerator while the mansion was being reclaimed. A photograph provided to TMZ of Smith&#x27;s refrigerator showed a large bottle labelled methadone, vials of injectable vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), and numerous bottles of diet product SlimFast.

==Death==
On February 8, 2007, Smith was found unresponsive in her room at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in Hollywood, Florida. Smith&#x27;s bodyguard and his wife, who was a registered emergency nurse, performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Smith was taken to Hollywood&#x27;s Memorial Regional Hospital, where she was pronounced dead, at the age of 39.

An investigation was led by Broward County Medical Examiner and forensic pathologist Joshua Perper in conjunction with Seminole police and several independent forensic pathologists and toxicologists. Perper announced that Smith died of &quot;combined drug intoxication&quot; with the sleeping medication chloral hydrate as the &quot;major component&quot;. No illegal drugs were found in her system. According to the official report her death was not due to homicide, suicide or natural causes.

Smith&#x27;s death was ultimately ruled an accidental drug overdose of the sedative chloral hydrate that became increasingly toxic when combined with other prescription drugs in her system, specifically four benzodiazepines. Furthermore, she had taken diphenhydramine and topiramate. Despite rumors of methadone use involved in the death of Smith&#x27;s son, Perper only found methadone in her bile, indicating it was probably ingested 2–3 days prior to her death, and therefore was not a contributing factor. The autopsy report indicates that abscesses on her buttocks, presumably from prior injections of vitamin B12 in the form of cyanocobalamin, as well as human growth hormone, and viral enteritis were contributory causes of death. Tests for influenza A and B were negative.

It was reported that eight of the eleven drugs in Smith&#x27;s system, including the chloral hydrate, were prescribed to Stern, not Smith. Additionally, two of the prescriptions were written for &quot;Alex Katz&quot; and one was written for Smith&#x27;s friend and psychiatrist Dr. Khristine Eroshevich. Perper acknowledged that all of the prescriptions were written by Dr. Eroshevich.
Smith&#x27;s funeral took place on March 2, 2007, in the Bahamas.

===Smith&#x27;s last will and testament===
Smith&#x27;s will was prepared by attorney Eric Lund in 2001, in Los Angeles, California. Smith named her son Daniel as the sole beneficiary of her estate, specifically excluded other children and named Stern executor of the estate. It indicated personal property valued at $10,000 and real estate valued at $1.8 million, with a $1.1 million mortgage, at the time of her death. A petition to probate Smith&#x27;s will was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, listing Birkhead as a party with interest to the estate.

===Defamation lawsuit by Smith&#x27;s mother===
In 2008, John O&#x27;Quinn, lawyer for Smith&#x27;s mother, Virgie Arthur, filed the underlying proceedings against &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, TMZ, CBS, journalist Art Harris, and several Texas bloggers, alleging that the defendants conspired to ruin her reputation through defamatory e-mails, blogs and website postings and harmed her efforts to seek custody and visitation of her granddaughter. The court jailed one blogger because she failed to turn over her computer as evidence. Arthur&#x27;s defamation lawsuit was dismissed after TMZ, CBS, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, Harris, and others won summary judgment.

<text>Reginald Edgar Walker (16 March 1889 in Durban – 5 November 1951) was a South African athlete and the 1908 Olympic champion in the 100 metres.

== Biography ==
Born in the Colony of Natal, Walker, the 1907 South African Champion, was not among the big favourites for the 100 metres at the 1908 Summer Olympics. He even had trouble getting to London, as he lacked the necessary finances until a Natal sportswriter collected funds to support Walker&#x27;s travel. In England, he was coached by Sam Mussabini, later also the coach of Harold Abrahams.

Several of the big names did not qualify for the final, but Walker did. His first round was a relatively easy victory run in 11.0 seconds. In the second round, Walker edged out William W. May of the United States while tying the Olympic record of 10.8 seconds. This qualified him for the final. There he competed against three North Americans, including James Rector of the United States, who had equalled the Olympic record in both of the qualifier rounds. Walker beat Rector in the final by about a foot and half, again equaling the Olympic record in 10.8 seconds.

Walker was still the youngest winner of the Olympic 100 metres (at 19 years and 128 days).

During World War I, Walker served with the 7th Infantry in German South West Africa, before joining the South African Overseas Expeditionary Force in 1917, serving in France, during which time he received a gunshot wound to the head. Walker was discharged from the Army in 1919 and later worked as a clerk with Ropes &amp; Mattings in Nairobi, Kenya Colony, before returning to South Africa.

<doc id="68338" wikidata="Q370071" url="?curid=68338" title="Peter Shor">
<text>Peter Williston Shor (born August 14, 1959) is an American theoretical computer scientist known for his work on quantum computation, in particular for devising Shor&#x27;s algorithm, a quantum algorithm for factoring exponentially faster than the best currently-known algorithm running on a classical computer. He has been a professor of applied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) since 2003. 

==Early life and education ==
Shor was born on August 14, 1959, in New York City, to Joan Bopp Shor and S. W. Williston Shor. He grew up in Washington, D.C. and Mill Valley, California. While attending Tamalpais High School, he placed third in the 1977 USA Mathematical Olympiad. After graduation that year, he won a silver medal at the International Math Olympiad in Yugoslavia (the U.S. team achieved the most points per country that year). 

Shor graduated from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1981 with a B.S. in mathematics. He was a Putnam Fellow in 1978. He then did doctoral study in applied mathematics at MIT, receiving a Ph.D. in 1985. His doctoral advisor was F. Thomson Leighton, and his thesis was on probabilistic analysis of bin-packing algorithms.

== Career ==
After being awarded his PhD by MIT, he spent one year as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and then accepted a position at Bell Labs in New Providence, New Jersey. It was there he developed Shor&#x27;s algorithm. This development was inspired by Simon&#x27;s problem. Shor first found an efficient quantum algorithm for the discrete log problem (which relates point-finding on a hypercube to a torus) and,&quot;Later that week, I was able to solve the factoring problem as well. There’s a strange relation between discrete log and factoring.&quot;Both of these problems are examples of the HSP. For his work discovering the efficient quantum algorithms for factoring and discrete logarithm he was awarded the Nevanlinna Prize at the 23rd International Congress of Mathematicians in 1998 and the Gödel Prize in 1999. In 1999, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. In 2017, he received the Dirac Medal of the ICTP and for 2019 the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Sciences.

Shor began his MIT position in 2003. Currently, he is the Henry Adams Morss and Henry Adams Morss, Jr. Professor of Applied Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics at MIT. He also is affiliated with CSAIL.

He received a Distinguished Alumni Award from Caltech in 2007.

On October 1, 2011, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was elected as an ACM Fellow in 2019 &quot;for contributions to quantum-computing, information theory, and randomized algorithms&quot;. He was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2002. In 2020, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for pioneering contributions to quantum computation.

In an interview published in &quot;Nature&quot; on October 30, 2020, Shor said that he considers post-quantum cryptography to be a solution to the quantum threat, although a lot of engineering effort is required to switch from vulnerable algorithms.

Along with three others, Shor was awarded the 2023 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for &quot;foundational work in the field of quantum information.&quot;

<doc id="68339" wikidata="Q123390" url="?curid=68339" title="IBM Lotus SmartSuite">
<text>SmartSuite is a discontinued office suite from Lotus Software. The company made versions of its office suite for IBM OS/2 and Microsoft Windows.

==Status==

SmartSuite is no longer supported or maintained.

SmartSuite used to be in maintenance mode, and supported with fixes and fixpacks on Windows 2000 and Windows XP. SmartSuite is not officially supported by IBM on versions of Windows after XP, but it does work very well on both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and Windows 11.

eComStation 1.0 included the OS/2 version of Smartsuite. It was an optional extra in later versions of eComStation. ArcaOS does not include Smartsuite, but is able to run it.

In 2007, IBM introduced a new office suite called IBM Lotus Symphony, unrelated to the Lotus Symphony integrated application suite that Lotus previously released.

In July 2012 the price for a user licence of Lotus SmartSuite 9.8 was US-$342.00 when purchased directly through the IBM website.

In May 2013, IBM announced the withdrawal of SmartSuite. Marketing of the product ended in June 2013, followed by all support ceasing in September 2014. IBM has also announced that there will be no replacement for SmartSuite.

==Components==
The following applications are included in SmartSuite for Microsoft Windows:
* Lotus Word Pro — word processor; previously called Ami Pro; .lwp files
* Lotus 1-2-3 — spreadsheet; .123, .wk1, .wk3, .wk4 files
* Lotus Freelance Graphics — presentation software; .prz files
* Lotus Approach — relational database; .apr (data entry and reports), .dbf (database) files
* Lotus Organizer — personal information manager; .org, .or2, .or3 files
* Lotus SmartCenter — a toolbar that let users quickly access programs, calendar, Internet bookmarks, and other resources
* Lotus FastSite — web design software; .htm files
* Lotus ScreenCam — screen recording software for demos and tutorials; .scm, .exe, .wav files
*Lotus vCard &amp; vCalendar Viewer — instant vCard and vCalendar viewer

==Version history==

===Microsoft Windows===
* (1994) - SmartSuite 2.1 (Ami Pro 3.0, 1-2-3 4.0, Freelance Graphics 2.0, Approach 2.0 and Organizer 1.1)
* (1995) - SmartSuite 3.1 (Windows 3.11) — (Lotus 1-2-3 ver. 5, Approach 3.0, Ami Pro 3.1, Freelance Graphics 2.1, Organizer 2.1, ScreenCam 1.1).
* (1995) - SmartSuite 4.0 (Windows 3.11) - 
* (1996) - SmartSuite 97 — Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 (1-2-3 97, Word Pro 97, Approach 97, Freelance Graphics 97, Organizer 97, ScreenCam 4.0 and SmartCenter)
* (1997) - SmartSuite 4.5 (Windows 3.11) - (Word Pro 97 Edition for Windows 3.1.) 
* (1999) - SmartSuite Millennium Edition (9.5) — (Organizer 5.0, Fastsite release 2, WordPro Millennium Edition, 1-2-3 Millennium Edition, Freelance Graphics Millennium Edition, Approach Millennium Edition, SmartCenter and ScreenCam).
* (2002) October 2002: Latest version: SmartSuite Millennium Edition 9.8. 
** Fixpack 2 was the last version provided to the general public. All subsequent releases were only available to IBM Passport Advantage subscribers. Fixpack 3 was released in October 2005 and Fixpack 4 in October 2006. A subsequent Fixpack 5 was released in October 2007 followed by Fixpack 6 in December 2008, although these Fixpacks only contained changes to the Lotus Approach database software.

==Compatibility==

Most SmartSuite programs are capable of reading and writing the corresponding Microsoft Office files. The Microsoft programs, however, are no longer capable of reading formats of the Lotus programs (the latest version that could was 2003). Furthermore, several of the SmartSuite components provide functionality not found in the Microsoft Office suite, for example Lotus FastSite and Lotus SmartCenter.

==IBM vs Microsoft==
In his finding of facts in &quot;United States v. Microsoft&quot;, Judge Jackson determined that because of IBM&#x27;s marketing of Lotus SmartSuite, and other alternatives to Microsoft products (like World Book electronic encyclopedia instead of Microsoft&#x27;s Encarta), Microsoft &quot;punished the IBM PC Company with higher prices, a late license for Windows 95, and the withholding of technical and marketing support.&quot;

Microsoft did not grant IBM OEM rights for Windows 95 until 15 minutes prior to the release of Windows 95, August 24, 1995. Because of this uncertainty, IBM machines were sold without Windows 95, while Compaq, HP, and other indulgent companies sold machines with Windows 95 from day one.

<text>Bilirubin (BR) (from the Latin for &quot;red &quot;) is a red-orange compound that occurs in the normcomponent of the straw-yellow color in urine. Another breakdown product, stercobilin, causes the brown color of feces.

Although bilirubin is usually found in animals rather than plants, at least one plant species, &quot;Strelitzia nicolai&quot;, is known to contain the pigment.

== Structure ==
Bilirubin consists of an open-chain tetrapyrrole. It is formed by oxidative cleavage of a porphyrin in heme, which affords biliverdin. Biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin. After conjugation with glucuronic acid, bilirubin is water-soluble and can be excreted.

Bilirubin is structurally similar to the pigment phycobilin used by certain algae to capture light energy, and to the pigment phytochrome used by plants to sense light. All of these contain an open chain of four pyrrolic rings.

Like these other pigments, some of the double-bonds in bilirubin isomerize when exposed to light. This isomerization is relevant to the phototherapy of jaundiced newborns: the E,Z-isomers of bilirubin formed upon light exposure are more soluble than the unilluminated Z,Z-isomer, as the possibility of intramolecular hydrogen bonding is removed. Increased solubility allows the excretion of unconjugated bilirubin in bile.

Some textbooks and research articles show the incorrect geometric isomer of bilirubin. The naturally occurring isomer is the Z,Z-isomer.

== Function ==
Bilirubin is created by the activity of biliverdin reductase on biliverdin, a green tetrapyrrolic bile pigment that is also a product of heme catabolism. Bilirubin, when oxidized, reverts to become biliverdin once again. This cycle, in addition to the demonstration of the potent antioxidant activity of bilirubin, has led to the hypothesis that bilirubin&#x27;s main physiologic role is as a cellular antioxidant. Consistent with this, animal studies suggest that eliminating bilirubin results in endogenous oxidative stress. Bilirubin&#x27;s antioxidant activity may be particularly important in the brain, where it prevents excitotoxicity and neuronal death by scavenging superoxide during N-methyl-D-aspartic acid neurotransmission.

== Metabolism ==
Bilirubin in plasma is mostly produced by the destruction of erythrocytes. Heme is metabolized into biliverdin (via heme oxygenase) and then into bilirubin (via biliverdin reductase) inside the macrophages.

Bilirubin is then released into the plasma and transported to the liver bound by albumin, since it is insoluble in water in this state. In this state, bilirubin is called unconjugated (despite being bound by albumin). 

In the liver, unconjugated bilirubin is up-taken by the hepatocytes and subsequently conjugated with glucuronic acid (via the enzyme uridine diphosphate–glucuronyl transferase). In this state, bilirubin is soluble in water and it is called conjugated bilirubin. 

Conjugated bilirubin is excreted into the bile ducts and enters the duodenum. During its transport to the colon, it is converted into urobilinogen by the bacterial enzyme bilirubin reductase. Most of the urobilinogen is further reduced into stercobilinogen and is excreted through feces (air oxidizes stercobilinogen to stercobilin, which gives feces their characteristic brown color). 

A lesser amount of urobilinogen is re-absorbed into portal circulation and transferred to the liver. For the most part, this urobilinogen is recycled to conjugated bilirubin and this process closes the enterohepatic circle. There is also an amount of urobilinogen which is not recycled, but rather enters the systemic circulation and subsequently the kidneys, where it is excreted. Air oxidizes urobilinogen into urobilin, which gives urine its characteristic color.

In parallel, a small amount of conjugated billirubin can also enter the systemic circulation and get excreted through urine. This is exaggerated in various pathological situations.

== Toxicity ==
=== Hyperbilirubinemia ===
Hyperbilirubinemia is a higher-than-normal level of bilirubin in the blood. Hyperbilirubinemia may refer to increased levels of conjugated, unconjugated or both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin. The causes of hyperbilirubinemia can also be classified into prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic. 

Prehepatic causes are associated mostly with an increase of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. They include:
* Hemolysis or increased breakdown of red blood cells (for example hematoma resorption)

Intrahepatic causes can be associated with elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin or both. They include:
* Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, where the newborn&#x27;s liver is not able to properly process the bilirubin causing jaundice
* Hepatocellular disease
** Viral infections (hepatitis A, B, and C)
** Chronic alcohol use
** Autoimmune disorders
* Genetic syndromes:
** Gilbert&#x27;s syndrome – a genetic disorder of bilirubin metabolism that can result in mild jaundice, found in about 5% of the population
** Rotor syndrome: non-itching jaundice, with rise of bilirubin in the patient&#x27;s serum, mainly of the conjugated type
** Dubin–Johnson syndrome
** Crigler–Najjar syndrome
* Pharmaceutical drugs (especially antipsychotic, some sex hormones, and a wide range of other drugs)
** Sulfonamides are contraindicated in infants less than 2 months old (exception when used with pyrimethamine in treating toxoplasmosis) as they increase unconjugated bilirubin leading to kernicterus.
** Drugs such as protease inhibitors like Indinavir can also cause disorders of bilirubin metabolism by competitively inhibiting the UGT1A1 enzyme.

Post-hepatic causes are associated with elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin. These include:
* Unusually large bile duct obstruction, e.g. gallstone in common bile duct (which is the most common post-hepatic cause)
* Biliary stricture (benign or malignant)
* Cholangitis
* Severe liver failure with cirrhosis (e.g. primary biliary cirrhosis)
* Pancreatitis

Cirrhosis may cause normal, moderately high or high levels of bilirubin, depending on exact features of the cirrhosis.

To further elucidate the causes of jaundice or increased bilirubin, it is usually simpler to look at other liver function tests (especially the enzymes alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase), blood film examination (hemolysis, etc.) or evidence of infective hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis A, B, C, delta, E, etc.).

==== Jaundice ====
Hemoglobin acts to transport oxygen which the body receives to all body tissue via blood vessels. Over time, when red blood cells need to be replenished, the hemoglobin is broken down in the spleen; it breaks down into two parts: heme group consisting of iron and bile, and protein fraction. While protein and iron are utilized to renew red blood cells, pigments that make up the red color in blood are deposited into the bile to form bilirubin. Jaundice leads to raised bilirubin levels&gt; that in turn negatively remove elastin-rich tissues. Jaundice may be noticeable in the sclera of the eyes at levels of about 2 to 3 mg/dl (34 to 51 μmol/L), and in the skin at higher levels.

Jaundice is classified, depending upon whether the bilirubin is free or conjugated to glucuronic acid, into conjugated jaundice or unconjugated jaundice.

==== Kernicterus ====

Unbound bilirubin (Bf) levels can be used to predict the risk of neurodevelopmental handicaps within infants. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in a newborn can lead to accumulation of bilirubin in certain brain regions (particularly the basal nuclei) with consequent irreversible damage to these areas manifesting as various neurological deficits, seizures, abnormal reflexes and eye movements. This type of neurological injury is known as kernicterus. The spectrum of clinical effect is called bilirubin encephalopathy. The neurotoxicity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia manifests because the blood–brain barrier has yet to develop fully, and bilirubin can freely pass into the brain interstitium, whereas more developed individuals with increased bilirubin in the blood are protected. Aside from specific chronic medical conditions that may lead to hyperbilirubinemia, neonates in general are at increased risk since they lack the intestinal bacteria that facilitate the breakdown and excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the feces (this is largely why the feces of a neonate are paler than those of an adult). Instead the conjugated bilirubin is converted back into the unconjugated form by the enzyme β-glucuronidase (in the gut, this enzyme is located in the brush border of the lining intestinal cells) and a large proportion is reabsorbed through the enterohepatic circulation. In addition, recent studies point towards high total bilirubin levels as a cause for gallstones regardless of gender or age.

== Health benefits ==
In the absence of liver disease, high levels of total bilirubin confers various health benefits. Studies have also revealed that levels of serum bilirubin (SBR) are inversely related to risk of certain heart diseases. While the poor solubility and potential toxicity of bilirubin limit its potential medicinal applications, current research is being done on whether bilirubin encapsulated silk fibrin nanoparticles can alleviate symptoms of disorders such as acute pancreatitis. In addition to this, there have been recent discoveries linking bilirubin and its ε-polylysine-bilirubin conjugate (PLL-BR), to more efficient insulin medication. It seems that bilirubin exhibits protective properties during the islet transplantation process when drugs are delivered throughout the bloodstream.

== Blood tests ==
Bilirubin is degraded by light. Blood collection tubes containing blood or (especially) serum to be used in bilirubin assays should be protected from illumination. For adults, blood is typically collected by needle from a vein in the arm. In newborns, blood is often collected from a heel stick, a technique that uses a small, sharp blade to cut the skin on the infant&#x27;s heel and collect a few drops of blood into a small tube. Non-invasive technology is available in some health care facilities that will measure bilirubin by using a bilirubinometer which shines light onto the skin and calculates the amount of bilirubin by analysing how the light is absorbed or reflected. This device is also known as a transcutaneous bilirubin meter.

Bilirubin (in blood) is found in two forms:
Note: Conjugated bilirubin is often incorrectly called &quot;direct bilirubin&quot; and unconjugated bilirubin is incorrectly called &quot;indirect bilirubin&quot;. Direct and indirect refer solely to how compounds are measured or detected in solution. Direct bilirubin is any form of bilirubin which is water-soluble and is available in solution to react with assay reagents; direct bilirubin is often made up largely of conjugated bilirubin, but some unconjugated bilirubin (up to 25%) can still be part of the &quot;direct&quot; bilirubin fraction. Likewise, not all conjugated bilirubin is readily available in solution for reaction or detection (for example, if it is hydrogen bonding with itself) and therefore would not be included in the direct bilirubin fraction.

Total bilirubin (TBIL) measures both BU and BC. Total bilirubin assays work by using surfactants and accelerators (like caffeine) to bring all of the different bilirubin forms into solution where they can react with assay reagents. Total and direct bilirubin levels can be measured from the blood, but indirect bilirubin is calculated from the total and direct bilirubin.

Indirect bilirubin is fat-soluble and direct bilirubin is water-soluble.

=== Total bilirubin ===
Total bilirubin = direct bilirubin + indirect bilirubin

Elevation of both alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin is more indicative of serious liver injury than is elevation in ALT alone, as postulated in Hy&#x27;s law that elucidates the relation between the lab test results and drug-induced liver injury

=== Indirect (unconjugated) ===

The measurement of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) is underestimated by measurement of indirect bilirubin, as unconjugated bilirubin (without/yet glucuronidation) reacts with diazosulfanilic acid to create azobilirubin which is measured as direct bilirubin.

===Direct===

Direct bilirubin = Conjugated bilirubin + delta bilirubin

==== Conjugated ====
In the liver, bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid by the enzyme glucuronyltransferase, first to bilirubin glucuronide and then to bilirubin diglucuronide, making it soluble in water: the conjugated version is the main form of bilirubin present in the &quot;direct&quot; bilirubin fraction. Much of it goes into the bile and thus out into the small intestine. Though most bile acid is reabsorbed in the terminal ileum to participate in enterohepatic circulation, conjugated bilirubin is not absorbed and instead passes into the colon.

There, colonic bacteria deconjugate and metabolize the bilirubin into colorless urobilinogen, which can be oxidized to form urobilin and stercobilin. Urobilin is excreted by the kidneys to give urine its yellow color and stercobilin is excreted in the feces giving stool its characteristic brown color. A trace (~1%) of the urobilinogen is reabsorbed into the enterohepatic circulation to be re-excreted in the bile.

Conjugated bilirubin&#x27;s half-life is shorter than delta bilirubin.

====Delta bilirubin====

Although the terms direct and indirect bilirubin are sometimes used interchangeably with conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, the direct fraction actually includes both conjugated bilirubin and delta bilirubin.

Delta bilirubin is albumin-bound conjugated bilirubin. In the other words, delta bilirubin is the kind of bilirubin covalently bound to albumin, which appears in the serum when hepatic excretion of conjugated bilirubin is impaired in patients with hepatobiliary disease. Furthermore, direct bilirubin tends to overestimate conjugated bilirubin levels due to unconjugated bilirubin that has reacted with diazosulfanilic acid, leading to increased azobilirubin levels (and increased direct bilirubin).

δ bilirubin = total bilirubin – (unconjugated bilirubin + conjugated bilirubin)

=====Half-life=====

The half-life of delta bilirubin is equivalent to that of albumin since the former is bound to the latter, yields 2–3 weeks.

A free-of-bound bilirubin has a half-life of 2 to 4 hours.

=== Measurement methods ===
Originally, the Van den Bergh reaction was used for a qualitative estimate of bilirubin.

This test is performed routinely in most medical laboratories and can be measured by a variety of methods.

Total bilirubin is now often measured by the 2,5-dichlorophenyldiazonium (DPD) method, and direct bilirubin is often measured by the method of Jendrassik and Grof.

==Blood levels==
The bilirubin level found in the body reflects the balance between production and excretion. Blood test results are advised to always be interpreted using the reference range provided by the laboratory that performed the test. The SI units are μmol/L. Typical ranges for adults are:
* 0–0.3 mg/dl – Direct (conjugated) bilirubin level
* 0.1–1.2 mg/dl – Total serum bilirubin level


== Urine tests ==
Urine bilirubin may also be clinically significant. Bilirubin is not normally detectable in the urine of healthy people. If the blood level of conjugated bilirubin becomes elevated, e.g. due to liver disease, excess conjugated bilirubin is excreted in the urine, indicating a pathological process. Unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble and so is not excreted in the urine. Testing urine for both bilirubin and urobilinogen can help differentiate obstructive liver disease from other causes of jaundice.

As with billirubin, under normal circumstances, only a very small amount of urobilinogen is excreted in the urine. If the liver&#x27;s function is impaired or when biliary drainage is blocked, some of the conjugated bilirubin leaks out of the hepatocytes and appears in the urine, turning it dark amber. However, in disorders involving hemolytic anemia, an increased number of red blood cells are broken down, causing an increase in the amount of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. Because the unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, one will not see an increase in bilirubin in the urine. Because there is no problem with the liver or bile systems, this excess unconjugated bilirubin will go through all of the normal processing mechanisms that occur (e.g., conjugation, excretion in bile, metabolism to urobilinogen, reabsorption) and will show up as an increase of urobilinogen in the urine. This difference between increased urine bilirubin and increased urine urobilinogen helps to distinguish between various disorders in those systems.

==History==
In ancient history, Hippocrates discussed bile pigments in two of the four humours in the context of a relationship between yellow and black biles. Hippocrates visited Democritus in Abdera who was regarded as the expert in melancholy &quot;black bile&quot;.

Relevant documentation emerged in 1827 when M. Louis Jacques Thénard examined the biliary tract of an elephant that had died at a Paris zoo. He observed dilated bile ducts were full of yellow magma, which he isolated and found to be insoluble in water. Treating the yellow pigment with hydrochloric acid produced a strong green color. Thenard suspected the green pigment was caused by impurities derived from mucus of bile.

Leopold Gmelin experimented with nitric acid in 1826 to establish the redox behavior in change from bilirubin to biliverdin, although the nomenclature did not exist at the time. The term biliverdin was coined by Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1840, although he preferred &quot;bilifulvin&quot; (yellow/red) over &quot;bilirubin&quot; (red). The term &quot;bilirubin&quot; was thought to have become mainstream based on the works of Staedeler in 1864 who crystallized bilirubin from cattle gallstones.

Rudolf Virchow in 1847 recognized hematoidin to be identical to bilirubin. It is not always distinguished from hematoidin, which one modern dictionary defines as synonymous with it but another defines as &quot;apparently chemically identical with bilirubin but with a different site of origin, formed locally in the tissues from hemoglobin, particularly under conditions of reduced oxygen tension.&quot; The synonymous identity of bilirubin and hematoidin was confirmed in 1923 by Fischer and Steinmetz using analytical crystallography.

In the 1930s, significant advances in bilirubin isolation and synthesis were described by Hans Fischer, Plieninger, and others, and pioneering work pertaining to endogenous formation of bilirubin from heme was likewise conducted in the same decade. The suffix IXα is partially based on a system developed Fischer, which means the bilin&#x27;s parent compound was protoporphyrin IX cleaved at the alpha-methine bridge (see protoporphyrin IX nomenclature).

Origins pertaining to the physiological activity of bilirubin were described by Ernst Stadelmann in 1891, who may have observed the biotransformation of infused hemoglobin into bilirubin possibly inspired by Ivan Tarkhanov&#x27;s 1874 works. Georg Barkan suggested the source of endogenous bilirubin to be from hemoglobin in 1932. Plieninger and Fischer demonstrated an enzymatic oxidative loss of the alpha-methine bridge of heme resulting in a bis-lactam structure in 1942. It is widely accepted that Irving London was the first to demonstrate endogenous formation of bilirubin from hemoglobin in 1950, and Sjostrand demonstrated hemoglobin catabolism produces carbon monoxide between 1949 and 1952. 14C labeled protoporphyrin biotransformation to bilirubin evidence emerged in 1966 by Cecil Watson. Rudi Schmid and Tenhunen discovered heme oxygenase, the enzyme responsible, in 1968. Earlier in 1963, Nakajima described a soluble &quot;heme alpha-methnyl oxygeanse&quot; which what later determined to be a non-enzymatic pathway, such as formation of a 1,2-Dioxetane intermediate at the methine bridge resulting in carbon monoxide release and biliverdin formation.

<doc id="68345" wikidata="Q857566" url="?curid=68345" title="X window manager">
<text>An X window manager is a window manager that runs on top of the X Window System, a windowing system mainly used on Unix-like systems.

Unlike MacOS Classic, macOS, and Microsoft Windows platforms (excepting Microsoft Windows explorer.exe shell replacements), which have historically provided a vendor-controlled, fixed set of ways to control how windows and panes display on a screen, and how the user may interact with them, window management for the X Window System was deliberately kept separate from the software providing the graphical display. The user can choose between various third-party window managers, which differ from one another in several ways, including:

* customizability of appearance and functionality:
** textual menus used to start programs and/or change options
** docks and other graphical ways to start programs
** multiple desktops and virtual desktops (desktops larger than the physical monitor size), and pagers to switch between them
* consumption of memory and other system resources
* degree of integration with a desktop environment, which provides a more complete interface to the operating system, and provides a range of integrated utilities and applications.

==How X window managers work==
When a window manager is running, some kinds of interaction between the X server and its clients are redirected through the window manager. In particular, whenever an attempt to show a new window is made, this request is redirected to the window manager, which decides the initial position of the window. Additionally, most modern window managers are reparenting, which usually leads to a banner being placed at the top of the window and a decorative frame being drawn around the window. These two elements are controlled by the window manager rather than the program. Therefore, when the user clicks or drags these elements, it is the window manager that takes the appropriate actions (such as moving or resizing the window).

Window managers are also responsible for icons. Indeed, icons do not exist at the X Window System core protocol level. When the user requests a window to be iconified, the window manager unmaps it (makes it non-visible) and takes the appropriate actions to show an icon in its place. Most modern window managers do not literally show icons to represent iconified windows anymore. Often, an auxiliary toolbar program will allow access to iconified windows.

While the main aim of a window manager is to manage the windows, many window managers have additional features such as handling mouse clicks in the root window, presenting panes and other visual elements, handling some keystrokes (e.g., Alt-F4 may close a window), deciding which application to run at start-up, etc.

Standardized protocols exist to allow normal clients to communicate with the window manager. The original one is Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM) but this has been superseded by the Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH). These protocols allow clients to request titles for windows and icons, check if a window is iconified which might be docked or minimized, and possibly customize windows decorations, what virtual desktop the window occupies. Additional information from the window manager is available through the core protocol including the visibility of windows such as if a window is hidden on a different Virtual desktop, and figuring out the adjustments for the window manager frames.

==Types of window managers==

===Stacking window managers===
A stacking window manager renders the windows one-by-one onto the screen at specific co-ordinates. If one window&#x27;s area overlaps another, then the window &quot;on top&quot; overwrites part of the other&#x27;s visible appearance. This results in the appearance familiar to many users in which windows act a little bit like pieces of paper on a desktop, which can be moved around and allowed to overlap.

In contrast to &quot;compositing&quot; window managers (see below), the lack of separate off-screen buffers can mean increased efficiency, but effects such as translucency are not possible.

Stacking window managers include Amiwm, Blackbox, CTWM, Enlightenment, Fluxbox, FLWM, FVWM, IceWM, MWM, Openbox, TWM and Window Maker.

===Tiling window managers===
A tiling window manager is a window manager with an organization of the screen into mutually non-overlapping frames (hence the name tiling), as opposed to the traditional approach of coordinate-based stacking of objects (windows) that tries to emulate the desk paradigm.

Tiling window managers include awesome, dwm, ion, larswm, ratpoison, Stumpwm, wmii, i3, xmonad, and XWEM.

===Compositing window managers===
A compositing window manager may appear to the user similar to a stacking window manager. However, the individual windows are first rendered in individual buffers, and then their images are composited onto the screen buffer; this two-step process means that visual effects (such as shadows, translucency) can be applied. It also means that compositing window managers are inherently more resource-hungry than an equivalently-powerful stacking window manager. For this reason, some window managers for X do not support compositing by default, such as Openbox.Compositing in Lubuntu

Historically, the Amiga in 1985, OSX in 2001, Java Looking Glass in 2003, and the Windows Longhorn demo in 2003 (delayed until Vista in 2007) preceded compositing efforts under X11. Compositing window managers for X include:
* GNOME&#x27;s Mutter née Metacity (first dev-branch compositor in 2.7 or 2.8 Wayback Machine of 2004 Linux Today - Release Digest: GNOME, August 30, 2004—original stable-branch compositor since 2.14 in 2005 Re: About Compositing or 2006 Metacity branched for 2.14—current compositor architecture since 2.22 Enable Metacity Compositing in GNOME 2.22 | Tombuntu in 2008—Metacity+Clutter begat Mutter in 2011),
* Xfce&#x27;s Xfwm (since 4.2 of 2004 or 2005 Xfce 4.2.0 released!),
* Unity&#x27;s Compiz (since 2005—was forked as Beryl in 2006 but the projects re-merged in 2007), and
* KDE&#x27;s KWin (since 4.0 of 2008).
Compositing support can be added to non-compositing window managers, through the use of compositors such as &quot;compton&quot;.

===Virtual window managers===
A virtual window manager is a window manager that uses virtual screens, whose resolution can be higher than the resolution of one&#x27;s monitor/display adapter thus resembling a two dimensional virtual desktop with its viewport. This environment is very useful when one wishes to have a large number of windows open at the same time. A number of virtual window managers have been made, including FVWM, Tvtwm, HaZe and others.

===Extensible window managers===

Some window managers are extensible, or programmable, by user scripts.

In these window managers, users can define new actions or override the default, or reactions to various events, like window size and position changes, window creation and deletion, key and mouse input, timer, etc. They often provide on-the-fly code execution, too.

Some examples of such window managers and the used languages are:
* Awesome - Lua
* KWin - ECMAScript
* Qtile - Python
* Sawfish - &quot;rep&quot;, a Lisp dialect
* Xmonad - haskell
* StumpWM - Common Lisp
* GWM - &quot;WOOL&quot;, a Lisp dialect
* Bspwm - C

<doc id="68348" wikidata="Q1649862" url="?curid=68348" title="The Big Sleep">
<text>The Big Sleep (1939) is a hardboiled crime novel by American-British writer Raymond Chandler, the first to feature the detective Philip Marlowe. It has been adapted for film twice, in 1946 and again in 1978. The story is set in Los Angeles.

The story is noted for its complexity, with characters double-crossing one another and secrets being exposed throughout the narrative. The title is a euphemism for death; the final pages of the book refer to a rumination about &quot;sleeping the big sleep&quot;.

In 1999, the book was voted 96th of &quot;Le Monde&quot;″s &quot;100 Books of the Century&quot;. In 2005, it was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;List of the 100 Best Novels&quot;.

==Plot==
Philip Marlowe, a private investigator in Los Angeles, is called to the home of the wealthy and elderly General Sternwood. He wants Marlowe to deal with an attempt by a bookseller named Arthur Geiger to blackmail his wild young daughter, Carmen. She had previously been blackmailed by a man named Joe Brody. Sternwood mentions that his other, older daughter Vivian is in a loveless marriage with a man named Rusty Regan, who has disappeared. On Marlowe&#x27;s way out, Vivian wonders if he was hired to find Regan, but Marlowe will not say.

Marlowe investigates Geiger&#x27;s bookstore and meets Agnes, the clerk. He determines that the store is an illegal pornography-lending library. He follows Geiger home, stakes out his house and sees Carmen enter. Later, Marlowe hears a scream, followed by gunshots and two cars speeding away. He rushes in to find Geiger dead and Carmen drugged and naked, in front of an empty camera. Marlowe takes her home but when he returns, Geiger&#x27;s body is gone; he quickly leaves. The next day, the police call Marlowe and let him know the Sternwoods&#x27; car was found driven off a pier, with their chauffeur, Owen Taylor, dead inside. It appears that Owen was hit on the head before the car entered the water. The police also ask if Marlowe is looking for Regan.

Marlowe stakes out Geiger&#x27;s bookstore and sees its inventory being moved to Brody&#x27;s home. Vivian comes to his office and says Carmen is being blackmailed with the nude photos from the previous night. She also mentions gambling at the casino of Eddie Mars and volunteers that Eddie&#x27;s wife, Mona, ran off with Rusty. Marlowe revisits Geiger&#x27;s house and finds Carmen trying to get inside. They look for the photos, but she plays dumb about the night before. Eddie suddenly enters; he says he is Geiger&#x27;s landlord and is looking for him. Eddie demands to know why Marlowe is there; Marlowe takes no notice and states that he is no threat to him.

Marlowe goes to Brody&#x27;s home and finds him with Agnes, the bookstore clerk. Marlowe tells Brody that he knows they are taking over the bookstore and blackmailing Carmen with the nude photos. Carmen appears with a gun and demands the photos, but Marlowe takes the weapon and makes her leave. He interrogates Brody further and pieces together the story: Geiger was blackmailing Carmen; Owen Taylor did not like this and killed Geiger, taking the film of Carmen. Brody was staking out Geiger&#x27;s house during the murder and pursued Owen, knocked him out, stole the film and possibly pushed the car off the pier. Suddenly, the doorbell rings and Brody is shot dead; Marlowe gives chase and catches Geiger&#x27;s male lover, Carol Lundgren, who shot Brody thinking he had killed Geiger. He had also hidden Geiger&#x27;s body, so he could remove his own belongings before the police got wind of the murder.

The case is seemingly over, but Marlowe is nagged by Rusty’s disappearance. The police accept that he simply ran off with Mona, since she is also missing, and since Eddie would not risk committing a murder in which he would be the obvious suspect. Eddie calls Marlowe to his casino and seems to be nonchalant about everything. Vivian is also there, and Marlowe senses something between her and Eddie. Marlowe drives her home and she tries to seduce him, but he rejects her advances. When he gets home, he finds Carmen has snuck into his bed, and he rejects her as well.

A man named Harry Jones, Agnes&#x27; new partner, approaches Marlowe and offers to tell him Mona&#x27;s location. Marlowe plans to meet him later, but Eddie’s henchman, Lash Canino, is suspicious of Jones and Agnes&#x27; intentions and kills Jones first. Marlowe manages to meet Agnes anyway and receives the information. He goes to the location in Realito, a repair shop with a home at the back, but Canino – with the help of Art Huck, the garage man – jumps him and knocks him out. When Marlowe awakens, he is tied up and Mona is there with him. She says she has not seen Rusty in months; she only hid out to help Eddie and insists he did not kill Rusty. She frees Marlowe, and he shoots and kills Canino.

The next day, Marlowe visits Sternwood, who remains curious about Rusty&#x27;s whereabouts and offers Marlowe an additional $1,000 if he is able to locate him. On the way out, Marlowe returns Carmen&#x27;s gun to her, and she asks him to teach her how to shoot. They go to an abandoned field, where she tries to kill him, but he has loaded the gun with blanks and merely laughs at her; the shock causes Carmen to have an epileptic seizure. Marlowe brings her back and tells Vivian he has guessed the truth: Carmen came on to Rusty and he spurned her, so she killed him. Eddie, who had been backing Geiger, helped Vivian conceal the killing by helping to dispose of Rusty&#x27;s body, inventing a story about his wife running off with Rusty, and then blackmailing her himself. Vivian says she did it to keep it all from her father, so he would not despise his own daughters, and promises to have Carmen institutionalized.

With the case now over, Marlowe goes to a local bar and orders several double Scotches. While drinking, he begins to think about Mona &quot;Silver-Wig&quot; Mars, but never sees her again.

==Background==
&quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, like most of Chandler&#x27;s novels, was written by what he called &quot;cannibalizing&quot; his short stories. Chandler would take stories he had already published in the pulp magazine &quot;Black Mask&quot; and rework them into a coherent novel. For &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, the two main stories that form the core of the novel are &quot;Killer in the Rain&quot; (published in 1935) and &quot;The Curtain&quot; (published in 1936). Although the stories were independent and shared no characters, they had some similarities that made it logical to combine them. In both stories there is a powerful father who is distressed by his wayward daughter. Chandler merged the two fathers into a new character and did the same for the two daughters, resulting in General Sternwood and his wild daughter Carmen. Chandler also borrowed small parts of two other stories, &quot;Finger Man&quot; and &quot;Mandarin&#x27;s Jade&quot;.

This process — especially in a time when cutting and pasting was done by cutting and pasting paper — sometimes produced a plot with a few loose ends. An unanswered question in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; is who killed the chauffeur. When Howard Hawks filmed the novel, his writing team was perplexed by that question, in response to which Chandler replied that he had no idea. This exemplifies a difference between Chandler&#x27;s style of crime fiction and that of previous authors. To Chandler, plot was less important than atmosphere and characterisation. An ending that answered every question while neatly tying every plot thread mattered less to Chandler than interesting characters with believable behaviour.

When Chandler merged his stories into a novel, he spent more effort on expanding descriptions of people, places, and Marlowe&#x27;s thinking than getting every detail of the plot perfectly consistent. In &quot;The Curtain&quot;, the description of Mrs. O&#x27;Mara&#x27;s room is just enough to establish the setting: This room had a white carpet from wall to wall. Ivory drapes of immense height lay tumbled casually on the white carpet inside the many windows, which stared towards the dark foot-hills. The air beyond the glass was dark too. It had not started to rain, yet there was a feeling of pressure in the atmosphere.In &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, Chandler expanded this description of the room and used new detail (e.g. the contrast of white and &quot;bled out&quot;, the coming rain) to foreshadow the fact that Mrs. Regan (Mrs. O&#x27;Mara in the original story) is covering up the murder of her husband by her sister and that the coming rainstorm will bring more deaths: The room was too big, the ceiling was too high, the doors were too tall, and the white carpet that went from wall to wall looked like a fresh fall of snow at Lake Arrowhead. There were full-length mirrors and crystal doodads all over the place. The ivory furniture had chromium on it, and the enormous ivory drapes lay tumbled on the white carpet a yard from the windows. The white made the ivory look dirty and the ivory made the white look bled out. The windows stared towards the darkening foothills. It was going to rain soon. There was pressure in the air already.Of the historical plausibility of Geiger&#x27;s character, Jay A. Gertzman wrote:Erotica dealers with experience had to be tough, although not necessarily predatory, and the business was not for the timid or scrupulous. But the criminality of erotica dealers did not extend beyond bookselling into organized racketeering; Al Capone and Meyer Lansky were not role models. A figure like A. G. Geiger, the dirty-books racketeer in Raymond Chandler&#x27;s &quot;Big Sleep&quot; (1939) who supplements his business activities as owner of a pornographic lending library in Hollywood by arranging sex orgies and blackmailing rich customers, is a fascinating but lurid exaggeration. However susceptible film personalities were to blackmail, it was not the métier of book dealers.

&quot;The Big Sleep&quot; takes place in the 1930s, and thus its story was also largely influenced by the very real massive social upheaval during the interwar period. During the harsh 1930s, the American people lost much faith in the government due to their repeated intervention failures, experienced the rise of gang violence from Prohibition, and endured the severe decline of public welfare from disasters such as the Great Depression and Dust Bowl. Chandler himself was fired from his job at an oil company in 1932, which would lead him to begin writing in the grittier and more cynical hard-boiled genre that mirrored the hardships of its time. In American essayist Herbert Ruhm&#x27;s introduction to the &quot;Black Mask,&quot; a hard-boiled magazine that Chandler initially wrote for, Ruhm found that: &quot;...the streets of the cities best reflected the moral disorder of the era. Events were depicted in language of these streets; mean, slangy, prejudiced, sometimes witty and always tough.&quot;

Through this time of suffering, people began flocking towards big cities such as Los Angeles—also the setting of &quot;The Big Sleep—&quot;for work, which consequently made cities hotspots for the new meshing of demographic and socioeconomic changes. As a result, roots of modernity and mass culture began to form in America, slowly eroding old social norms such as the traditional views of masculinity and family. This plays heavily into Chandler&#x27;s depiction of Marlowe as a chivalrous lone wolf of the old guard, futilely trying to change the world around him.

<doc id="68349" wikidata="Q3144934" url="?curid=68349" title="Hereditary haemochromatosis">
<text>Hereditary haemochromatosis type 1 (HFE-related haemochromatosis) is a genetic disorder characterized by excessive intestinal absorption of dietary iron, resulting in a pathological increase in total body iron stores. Humans, like most animals, have no mechanism to regulate excess iron, simply losing a limited amount through various means like sweating or menstruating.

Excess iron accumulates in tissues and organs, disrupting their normal function. The most susceptible organs include the liver, heart, pancreas, skin, joints, gonads, thyroid and pituitary gland; patients can present with cirrhosis, polyarthropathy, hypogonadism, heart failure, or diabetes.

There are five types of hereditary hemochromatosis: type 1, 2 (2A, 2B), 3, 4 and 5, all caused by mutated genes. Hereditary hemochromatosis type 1 is the most frequent, and uniquely related to the HFE gene. It is most common among those of Northern European ancestry, in particular those of Celtic descent.

The disease follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene involved in each cell to develop the condition. In most cases, when a person has this autosomal recessive condition, their parents act as carriers. Carriers possess one copy of the mutated gene but do not manifest any signs or symptoms associated with the disease, and are referred to as carriers. The unaffected carrier parents play an integral role in transmitting one copy of the mutated gene to their child, who ultimately develops the disease. However, carriers may experience iron overload themselves at a later stage if certain factors come into play. Still, in most cases, they remain asymptomatic throughout their lives unless other genetic or environmental factors contribute to excessive iron accumulation within their bodies.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Haemochromatosis is in its manifestations, &quot;i.e.&quot;, often presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of other diagnoses that affect specific organ systems. Many of the signs and symptoms below are uncommon, and most patients with the hereditary form of haemochromatosis do not show any overt signs of disease nor do they have premature morbidity, if they are diagnosed early, but, more often than not, the condition is diagnosed only at autopsy.

Presently, the classic triad of cirrhosis, bronze skin, and diabetes is less common because of earlier diagnosis.

The more common clinical manifestations include:
* Fatigue
* Malaise
* Joint pain (mainly knee and hand)
* Abdominal pain
* Bronze or gray skin color (for this the illness was named &quot;bronze diabetes&quot; when it was first described by Armand Trousseau in 1865)
* Liver fibrosis or cirrhosis (with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma): Liver disease is always preceded by evidence of liver dysfunction, including elevated serum enzymes specific to the liver, clubbing of the fingers, leuconychia, asterixis, hepatomegaly, palmar erythema, and spider naevi. Cirrhosis can also present with jaundice (yellowing of the skin) and ascites.
* Diabetes mellitus type 2: HH patients have insulin resistance for liver disease, and poor insulin secretion due to pancreatic damage from iron deposition.
* Erectile dysfunction and hypogonadism, resulting in decreased libido, amenorrhea
* Congestive heart failure, abnormal heart rhythms, or pericarditis
* Arthritis of the hands (especially the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints), but also the knee and shoulder joints
* Weight loss

Less common findings including:
* Memory loss
* Hair loss
* Splenomegaly
* adrenal insufficiency
* Deafness
* Dyskinesias, including Parkinsonian symptoms
* Dysfunction of certain endocrine organs:
** Parathyroid gland (leading to hypocalcaemia)
** Pituitary gland: secondary hypothyroidism, secondary hypogonadism
** Adrenal gland
* An increased susceptibility to certain infectious diseases caused by siderophilic microorganisms:
** &quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot; infections from eating seafood or wound infection
** &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;
** &quot;Yersinia enterocolica&quot;
** &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; (serotype Typhymurium)
** &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;
** &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;
** &quot;Rhizopus arrhizus&quot;
** &quot;Mucor&quot; species
** &quot;Aspergillus fumigatus&quot;
** Cytomegalovirus
** Hepatitis B virus
** Hepatitis C virus

In the hereditary hemochromatosis (HH or HHC), males are usually diagnosed after their forties and fifties, and women some decades later, during menopause. The severity of clinical disease varies considerably. Some evidence suggests that hereditary haemochromatosis patients affected with other liver ailments such as hepatitis or alcoholic liver disease have worse liver disease than those with either condition alone. Also, juvenile form of primary haemochromatosis (Hemochromatosis type 2) present in childhood with the same consequences of iron overload.

===End-organ damage===

Iron is stored in the liver, pancreas and heart.
Long-term effects of haemochromatosis on these organs can be serious, even fatal when untreated.

Since the liver is a primary storage area for iron and naturally accumulates excess iron over time, it is likely to be damaged by iron overload.
Toxins may accumulate in the blood and eventually affect mental functioning due to increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy.
Together, they can increase the risk of liver cancer to one in three persons.

If excess iron in the heart interferes with its ability to circulate enough blood, a number of problems can occur, including (potentially fatal) congestive heart failure. The condition may be reversible when haemochromatosis is treated and excess iron stores are reduced. Arrhythmia or abnormal heart rhythm can cause heart palpitations, chest pain, and light-headedness, and is occasionally life-threatening. This condition can often be reversed with treatment.

The pancreas, which also stores iron, is very important in the body&#x27;s mechanisms for sugar metabolism. Diabetes affects the way the body uses blood sugar (glucose), and diabetes is, in turn, the leading cause of new blindness in adults and may be involved in kidney failure.

Haemochromatosis may lead to cirrhosis and its complications, including bleeding from dilated veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices) and stomach (gastric varices) and severe fluid retention in the abdomen (ascites).
Severity of periodontal disease is associated with high transferrin saturation in haemochromatosis patients.

== Genetics ==
The regulation of dietary iron absorption is complex and understanding is incomplete. One of the better-characterized genes responsible for hereditary haemochromatosis is &quot;HFE&quot; on chromosome 6, which codes for a transmembrane protein involved in the induction of hepcidin expression upon high iron load. The &quot;HFE&quot; gene has three often observed genetic variants:
* rs1799945, c.187C&gt;G, p.His63Asp (H63D);
* rs1800562, c.845G&gt;A, p. Cys282Tyr (C282Y);
* rs1800730, c.193A&gt;T, p.Ser65Cys (S65C).

The worldwide prevalence rates for H63D, C282Y and S65C (minor allele frequencies) are 10%, 3% and 1% respectively.

The C282Y allele is a transition point mutation from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 845 in &quot;HFE&quot;, resulting in a missense mutation that replaces the cysteine residue at position 282 with a tyrosine amino acid. Heterozygotes for either allele can manifest clinical iron overload, if they have two of any alleles. This makes them compound heterozygous for haemochromatosis and puts them greatly at risk of storing excess iron in the body. Homozygosity for the C282Y genetic variant is the most common genotype responsible for clinical iron accumulation, though heterozygosity for C282Y/H63D variants, so-called compound heterozygotes, results in clinically evident iron overload. Considerable debate exists regarding the penetrance—the probability of clinical expression of the trait given the genotype— for clinical disease in homozygotes. Most males homozygous for &quot;HFE&quot; C282Y show at least one manifestation of iron-storage disease by middle age. Individuals with the relevant genetic variants may never develop iron overload. Phenotypic expression is present in 70% of C282Y homozygotes with less than 10% going on to experience severe iron overload and organ damage.

The H63D variant is just a gene polymorphism, and if there are no other changes, it may not have clinical significance. In a 2014 study, H63D homozygosity was associated with an elevated mean ferritin level, but only 6.7% had documented iron overload at follow-up. As about the people with one copy of the H63D alteration (heterozygous carriers), this genotype is very unlikely to cause a clinical presentation, there is no predictable risk of iron overload. Besides that, two 2020 studies revealed that the frequency of homozygous or heterozygous H63D variant is significantly higher in elite endurance athletes comparing to ethnically matched controls, and is associated with high V̇O2max in male athletes.

Each patient with the susceptible genotype accumulates iron at different rates depending on iron intake, the exact nature of the genetic variant, and the presence of other insults to the liver, such as alcohol and viral disease. As such, the degree to which the liver and other organs are affected is highly variable and is dependent on these factors and co-morbidities, as well as age at which they are studied for manifestations of disease. Penetrance differs between populations.

Disease-causing genetic variants of the &quot;HFE&quot; gene account for 90% of the cases of non-transfusion iron overload.

This gene is closely linked to the HLA-A3 locus.

== Pathophysiology ==
Since the regulation of iron metabolism is still poorly understood, a clear model of how haemochromatosis operates is still not available. A working model describes the defect in the &quot;HFE&quot; gene, where a mutation puts the intestinal absorption of iron into overdrive. Normally, &quot;HFE&quot; facilitates the binding of transferrin, which is iron&#x27;s carrier protein in the blood. Transferrin levels are typically elevated at times of iron depletion (low ferritin stimulates the release of transferrin from the liver). When transferrin is high, HFE works to increase the intestinal release of iron into the blood. When HFE is mutated, the intestines perpetually interpret a strong transferrin signal as if the body were deficient in iron. This leads to maximal iron absorption from ingested foods and iron overload in the tissues. However, &quot;HFE&quot; is only part of the story, since many patients with mutated &quot;HFE&quot; do not manifest clinical iron overload, and some patients with iron overload have a normal &quot;HFE&quot; genotype. A possible explanation is the fact that &quot;HFE&quot; normally plays a role in the production of hepcidin in the liver, a function that is impaired in &quot;HFE&quot; mutations.

People with abnormal iron regulatory genes do not reduce their absorption of iron in response to increased iron levels in the body. Thus, the iron stores of the body increase. As they increase, the iron which is initially stored as ferritin is deposited in organs as haemosiderin and this is toxic to tissue, probably at least partially by inducing oxidative stress. Iron is a pro-oxidant. Thus, haemochromatosis shares common symptomology (e.g., cirrhosis and dyskinetic symptoms) with other &quot;pro-oxidant&quot; diseases such as Wilson&#x27;s disease, chronic manganese poisoning, and hyperuricaemic syndrome in Dalmatian dogs. The latter also experience &quot;bronzing&quot;.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of haemochromatosis is often made following the incidental finding on routine blood screening of elevated serum liver enzymes or elevation of the transferrin saturation or elevated serum ferritin. Arthropathy with stiff joints, diabetes, or fatigue, may be the presenting complaint.

===Blood tests===
Serum ferritin and fasting transferrin saturation are commonly used as screening for haemochromatosis. Transferrin binds iron and is responsible for iron transport in the blood. Measuring ferritin provides a crude measure of iron stores in the body. Fasting transferrin saturation values in excess of 45%, and the serum ferritin more than 250 ug/L in males and 200 ug/L in females are recognized as a threshold for further evaluation of haemochromatosis. Other source says that the normal values for males are 12-300 ng/mL and for female, 12-150 ng/mL. Fasting transferrin saturation is a better test to detect HH. Transferrin saturation greater than 62% is suggestive of homozygosity for mutations in the HFE gene.

Ferritin, a protein synthesized by the liver, is the primary form of iron storage within cells and tissues. Measuring ferritin provides a crude estimate of whole-body iron stores, though is raised in many conditions, particularly inflammatory conditions. Examples of causes for raised serum ferritin include but are not limited to: infection, chronic alcohol consumption (mainly &gt;20g/day), liver disease, cancer, porphyria, Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, hyperthyroidism, obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, several blood transfusions, too many iron supplements, aceruloplasminemia, atransferrinemia, hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome and others. Proinflammatory states account for up to 90% of raised ferritin. Serum ferritin in excess of 1000 ng/mL of blood is almost always attributable to haemochromatosis.

Other blood tests routinely performed include blood count, renal function, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and glucose (and/or an oral glucose tolerance test).

===Liver biopsy===
Liver biopsies involve taking a sample of tissue from the liver, using a thin needle. The amount of iron in the sample is then quantified and compared to normal, and evidence of liver damage, especially cirrhosis, is measured microscopically. Formerly, this was the only way to confirm a diagnosis of haemochromatosis, but measures of transferrin and ferritin along with a history are considered adequate in determining the presence of the malady. Risks of biopsy include bruising, bleeding, and infection. Now, when a history and measures of transferrin or ferritin point to haemochromatosis, whether a liver biopsy is still necessary to quantify the amount of accumulated iron is debatable.

===MRI===
MRI-based testing is a noninvasive and accurate alternative to measure liver iron concentrations.

===Other imaging===
Clinically, the disease may be silent, but characteristic radiological features may point to the diagnosis. The increased iron stores in the organs involved, especially in the liver and pancreas, result in characteristic findings on unenhanced CT and a decreased signal intensity in MRI scans. Haemochromatosis arthropathy includes degenerative osteoarthritis and chondrocalcinosis. The distribution of the arthropathy is distinctive, but not unique, frequently affecting the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints of the hand. The arthropathy can, therefore, be an early clue as to the diagnosis of haemochromatosis.

===Functional testing===
Based on the history, a physician might consider specific tests to monitor organ dysfunction, such as an echocardiogram for heart failure, or blood glucose monitoring for patients with haemochromatosis diabetes.

=== Stages ===
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases suggests the following three stages for the condition (identified by the European Association for the Study of Liver Diseases):

# Genetic susceptibility but no iron overload. Individuals who have the genetic disorder only.
# Iron overload but no organ or tissue damage.
# Organ or tissue damage as a result of iron deposition.

Individuals at each stage do not necessarily progress on to the next stage, and end stage disease is more common in males.

===Differential diagnosis===
Other causes of excess iron accumulation exist, which have to be considered before haemochromatosis type 1 is diagnosed.
* Haemochromatosis type 2.
* Haemochromatosis type 3.
* Haemochromatosis type 4.
* Haemochromatosis type 5.
* African iron overload, formerly known as Bantu siderosis, was first observed among people of African descent in Southern Africa. Originally, this was blamed on ungalvanised barrels used to store home-made beer, which led to increased oxidation and increased iron levels in the beer. Further investigation has shown that only some people drinking this sort of beer get iron overload syndrome, and that a similar syndrome occurred in people of African descent who have had no contact with this kind of beer (&quot;e.g.,&quot; African Americans). This led investigators to the discovery of a gene polymorphism in the gene for ferroportin, which predisposes some people of African descent to iron overload.
* Secondary haemochromatosis: its main cause is the Transfusional haemosiderosis. It is the accumulation of iron, mainly in the liver, in patients who receive frequent blood transfusions (such as those with thalassaemia). Other causes are: chronic hemolytic anemia, chronic liver disease (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, fatty liver disease), dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia, overdose of oral iron pills or iron injections, long-time kidney dialysis, and dyserythropoeisis, also known as myelodysplastic syndrome. It is a disorder in the production of red blood cells that leads to increased iron recycling from the bone marrow and accumulation in the liver.
* Aceruloplasminemia.
* Atransferrinemia.
* Neonatal hemochromatosis
* GRACILE syndrome
* Porphyria cutanea tarda

== Screening ==
Standard diagnostic measures for haemochromatosis, transferrin saturation and ferritin tests, are not a part of routine medical testing. Screening for haemochromatosis is recommended if the patient has a parent, child, or sibling with the disease.

Routine screening of the general population for hereditary haemochromatosis is generally not done. Mass genetic screening has been evaluated by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, among other groups, which recommended against genetic screening of the general population for hereditary haemochromatosis because the likelihood of discovering an undiagnosed patient with clinically relevant iron overload is less than one in 1,000. Although strong evidence shows that treatment of iron overload can save lives in patients with transfusional iron overload, no clinical study has shown that for asymptomatic carriers of hereditary haemochromatosis treatment with venesection (phlebotomy) provides any clinical benefit. Recently, patients are suggested to be screened for iron overload using serum ferritin as a marker. If serum ferritin exceeds 1000 ng/mL, iron overload is very likely the cause.

== Treatment ==

===Phlebotomy===
Early diagnosis is vital, as the late effects of iron accumulation can be wholly prevented by periodic phlebotomies (by venesection) comparable in volume to blood donations.

Phlebotomy (or bloodletting) is usually done at a weekly or each two weeks interval until ferritin levels are 50 μg/L or less. To prevent iron reaccumulation, subsequent phlebotomies are normally carried out about once every three to four months for males, and twice a year for females to keep the serum ferritin between 50 and 100 ug/L

===Iron chelation therapy===
Where venesection is not possible, long-term administration of an iron chelator as Deferoxamine (or Desferrioxamine), Deferasirox and Deferiprone is useful. Deferoxamine is an iron-chelating compound, and excretion induced by deferoxamine is enhanced by administration of vitamin C. It cannot be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding due to risk of defects in the child.

===Organ damage===
* Treatment of organ damage (heart failure with diuretics and ACE inhibitor therapy). Hepatic transplantation in patients with liver failure.

===Diet===
Diet can be a powerful but understudied and utilized tool in prevention of iron overload. It can strongly affect the incidence of disease and treatment. Especially in the Western world where many foods are fortified and animal protein (heme iron) is relatively convenient and inexpensive, it is very common for people to eat more than the Recommended Dietary Allowance of iron even in a single meal. For example, one serving of several popular cereals, such as Cheerios or Grape Nuts, has about two times the RDA of iron for a man or non menstruating woman. Menstruating women have roughly twice the iron requirements of a man or non menstruating woman. For this reason, it can very helpful for those recently diagnosed to track their iron and vitamin C consumption for a time and comparing it to the RDA. 
* Limiting intake of alcoholic beverages, high iron fortified foods such as certain cereals and supplements, vitamin C (increases iron absorption in the gut), heme iron animal products (high in iron), and potential causes of food poisoning (shellfish, raw seafood)
* Increasing intake of substances that inhibit iron absorption, such as high-tannin tea, calcium, black or green teas, and foods containing oxalic and phytic acids (such as collard greens, which must be consumed at the same time as the iron-containing foods to be effective)

===Chelating polymers===
A novel experimental approach to the hereditary haemochromatosis treatment is the maintenance therapy with polymeric chelators. These polymers or particles have a negligible or null systemic biological availability and they are designed to form stable complexes with Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the GIT and thus limiting the uptake of these ions and their long-term accumulation. Although this method has only a limited efficacy, unlike small-molecular chelators, such an approach has virtually no side effects in sub-chronic studies. Interestingly, the simultaneous chelation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ increases the treatment efficacy.

== Prognosis ==
Persons with symptomatic haemochromatosis have somewhat reduced life expectancy compared to the general population, mainly due to excess mortality from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Patients who were treated with phlebotomy lived longer than those who were not. Patients without liver disease or diabetes had similar survival rate to the general population.

== Epidemiology ==
Haemochromatosis is one of the most common heritable genetic conditions in people of Northern Europe, with a prevalence of 1:200. The disease has a variable penetration, and about one in 10 people of this demographic carry a mutation in one of the genes regulating iron metabolism. In the U.S., the frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations is 5.4% and 13.5%, respectively. Whereas, the worldwide frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations is about 1.9% and 8.1%, respectively, so mutation in H63D allele are more than C282Y allele. The prevalence of mutations in iron-metabolism genes varies in different populations. A study of 3,011 unrelated white Australians found that 14% were heterozygous carriers of an HFE mutation, 0.5% were homozygous for an &quot;HFE&quot; mutation, and only 0.25% of the study population had clinically relevant iron overload. Most patients who are homozygous for &quot;HFE&quot; mutations do not manifest clinically relevant haemochromatosis (see Genetics above). Other populations have a lower prevalence of both the genetic mutation and the clinical disease. It is the most frequent genetic disease in the U.S. with a prevalence of 1:300 in the non-Hispanic white population, It is 2-3 times more common in males.

Genetics studies suggest the original haemochromatosis mutation arose in a single person, possibly of Celtic ethnicity, who lived 60–70 generations ago. At that time, when dietary iron may have been scarcer than today, the presence of the mutant allele may have provided an evolutionary advantage by maintaining higher iron levels in the blood.

The distribution of the C282Y variant was noted in various countries. Non-HFE associated hemochromatosis, as Haemochromatosis type 2, Haemochromatosis type 3, Haemochromatosis type 4 and Haemochromatosis type 5, were discovered in Mediterranean countries. On the other side, Northern European ancestry is closely linked to hereditary hemochromatosis disease (HFE). In one study, over 93% of Irish patients with HFE C282Y mutation were homozygotic. The G320V mutation in the HJV gene, which produces hemojuvelin protein, is widely distributed in central Europe and Greece.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;haemochromatosis&quot; is used by different sources in many different ways.

It is often used to imply an association with the &quot;HFE&quot; gene. For many years, &quot;HFE&quot; was the only known gene associated with haemochromatosis, and the term &quot;hereditary haemochromatosis&quot; was used to describe haemochromatosis type 1. However, many different genetic associations with this condition are now known. The older the text, or the more general the audience, the more likely that &quot;HFE&quot; is implied. &quot;Haemochromatosis&quot; has also been used in contexts where a genetic cause for iron accumulation had not been known. In some cases, however, a condition that was thought to be due to diet or environment was later linked to a genetic polymorphism, as in African iron overload.

== History ==
In 1847, Virchow described a golden brown granular pigment that was soluble in sulfuric acid and produced red ash on ignition. The disease was first described in 1865 by Armand Trousseau in a report on diabetes in patients presenting with a bronze pigmentation of their skin. Two years later, Perls developed the first practical method for the analysis of iron in tissue. Despite Trousseau not associating diabetes with iron accumulation, the recognition that infiltration of the pancreas with iron might disrupt endocrine function resulting in diabetes was made by Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in 1890. In 1935, English gerontologist Joseph Sheldon described the cases of haemochromatosis. He established this as the name of the disorder and his detailed monograph. Despite lacking the modern molecular techniques accessible today, he came to accurate conclusions that describe haemochromatosis disease as an inborn error of metabolism where this inherited disorder can increase the absorption of iron and thus cause tissue damage due to iron deposition. Moreover, he rejected theories that alcohol, drug, and other factors contribute to the disorder.

The clinical case series from 1935 to 1955 indicated that haemochromatosis was more common than had been acknowledged. During the 1960s, MacDonald, a pathologist at Boston City Hospital, diverted attention away from the true cause of haemochromatosis. He believed that haemochromatosis was a nutritional condition because he observed many drunken patients of Irish ancestry. During this period of time, other investigators reported additional evidence suggesting that a genetic factor could play a central role in the absorption of iron in people with haemochromatosis. However, alcohol consumption is known to increase the risk of liver injury in haemochromatosis. This finding is consistent with the concept that excess iron metabolism is a primary cause of haemochromatosis disease.

Finally, in 1976, Marcel Simon and his collaborators confirmed that haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that has a link to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region of the genome. It took 20 years for researchers at Mercator Genetics to effectively identify and clone the haemochromatosis genes using a positional cloning approach.

In 1996, Feder et al. identified HFE, which is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene. They found that 83% of patients have homozygosity for a missense mutation (C282Y) in the HFE gene. Finally, several groups reported their findings in a series of patients with haemmochromatosis where they discovered the existence of the C282Y mutation in about 85-90% of the cases. The discovery has led to improved clinical medicine and liver disease evaluation.

<text>A pattern is a regularity in the world, in human-made design, or in abstract ideas. As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner. A geometric pattern is a kind of pattern formed of geometric shapes and typically repeated like a wallpaper design.

Any of the senses may directly observe patterns. Conversely, abstract patterns in science, mathematics, or language may be observable only by analysis. Direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns, which are widespread in nature and in art. Visual patterns in nature are often chaotic, rarely exactly repeating, and often involve fractals. Natural patterns include spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tilings, cracks, and those created by symmetries of rotation and reflection. Patterns have an underlying mathematical structure; indeed, mathematics can be seen as the search for regularities, and the output of any function is a mathematical pattern. Similarly in the sciences, theories explain and predict regularities in the world.

In many areas of the decorative arts, from ceramics and textiles to wallpaper, &quot;pattern&quot; is used for an ornamental design that is manufactured, perhaps for many different shapes of object. In art and architecture, decorations or visual motifs may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer.

== Nature ==

Nature provides examples of many kinds of pattern, including symmetries, trees and other structures with a fractal dimension, spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tilings, cracks and stripes.

=== Symmetry ===

Symmetry is widespread in living things. Animals that move usually have bilateral or mirror symmetry as this favours movement. Plants often have radial or rotational symmetry, as do many flowers, as well as animals which are largely static as adults, such as sea anemones. Fivefold symmetry is found in the echinoderms, including starfish, sea urchins, and sea lilies.

Among non-living things, snowflakes have striking sixfold symmetry: each flake is unique, its structure recording the varying conditions during its crystallisation similarly on each of its six arms. Crystals have a highly specific set of possible crystal symmetries; they can be cubic or octahedral, but cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals).

=== Spirals ===

Spiral patterns are found in the body plans of animals including molluscs such as the nautilus, and in the phyllotaxis of many plants, both of leaves spiralling around stems, and in the multiple spirals found in flowerheads such as the sunflower and fruit structures like the pineapple.
=== Chaos, turbulence, meanders and complexity ===
Chaos theory predicts that while the laws of physics are deterministic, there are events and patterns in nature that never exactly repeat because extremely small differences in starting conditions can lead to widely differing outcomes. The patterns in nature tend to be static due to dissipation on the emergence process, but when there is interplay between injection of energy and dissipation there can arise a complex dynamic. Many natural patterns are shaped by this complexity, including vortex streets, other effects of turbulent flow such as meanders in rivers. or nonlinear interaction of the system 
=== Waves, dunes ===
Waves are disturbances that carry energy as they move. Mechanical waves propagate through a medium – air or water, making it oscillate as they pass by. Wind waves are surface waves that create the chaotic patterns of the sea. As they pass over sand, such waves create patterns of ripples; similarly, as the wind passes over sand, it creates patterns of dunes.
=== Bubbles, foam ===

Foams obey Plateau&#x27;s laws, which require films to be smooth and continuous, and to have a constant average curvature. Foam and bubble patterns occur widely in nature, for example in radiolarians, sponge spicules, and the skeletons of silicoflagellates and sea urchins.
=== Cracks ===
Cracks form in materials to relieve stress: with 120 degree joints in elastic materials, but at 90 degrees in inelastic materials. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. Cracking patterns are widespread in nature, for example in rocks, mud, tree bark and the glazes of old paintings and ceramics.
=== Spots, stripes===

Alan Turing, and later the mathematical biologist James D. Murray and other scientists, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns, for example in the skin of mammals or the plumage of birds: a reaction–diffusion system involving two counter-acting chemical mechanisms, one that activates and one that inhibits a development, such as of dark pigment in the skin. These spatiotemporal patterns slowly drift, the animals&#x27; appearance changing imperceptibly as Turing predicted.

== Art and architecture ==
=== Tilings ===

In visual art, pattern consists in regularity which in some way &quot;organizes surfaces or structures in a consistent, regular manner.&quot; At its simplest, a pattern in art may be a geometric or other repeating shape in a painting, drawing, tapestry, ceramic tiling or carpet, but a pattern need not necessarily repeat exactly as long as it provides some form or organizing &quot;skeleton&quot; in the artwork. In mathematics, a tessellation is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes (which mathematicians call tiles), with no overlaps and no gaps.

===In architecture===

In architecture, motifs are repeated in various ways to form patterns. Most simply, structures such as windows can be repeated horizontally and vertically (see leading picture). Architects can use and repeat decorative and structural elements such as columns, pediments, and lintels. Repetitions need not be identical; for example, temples in South India have a roughly pyramidal form, where elements of the pattern repeat in a fractal-like way at different sizes.

== Science and mathematics ==
Mathematics is sometimes called the &quot;Science of Pattern&quot;, in the sense of rules that can be applied wherever needed. For example, any sequence of numbers that may be modeled by a mathematical function can be considered a pattern. Mathematics can be taught as a collection of patterns.

Gravity is a source of ubiquitous scientific patterns or patterns of observation. The sun rising and falling pattern each day results from the rotation of the earth while in orbit around the sun. Likewise, the moon&#x27;s path through the sky is due to its orbit of the earth. These examples, while perhaps trivial, are examples of the &quot;unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics&quot; which obtain due to the differential equations whose application within physics function to describe the most general empirical patterns of the universe.

=== Real patterns ===
Daniel Dennett&#x27;s notion of real patterns, discussed in his 1991 paper of the same name, provides an ontological framework aiming to discern the reality of patterns beyond mere human interpretation, by examining their predictive utility and the efficiency they provide in compressing information. For example, centre of gravity is a real pattern because it allows us to predict the movements of a bodies such as the earth around the sun, and it compresses all the information about all the particles in the sun and the earth that allows us to make those predictions.

=== Fractals ===

Some mathematical rule-patterns can be visualised, and among these are those that explain patterns in nature including the mathematics of symmetry, waves, meanders, and fractals. Fractals are mathematical patterns that are scale invariant. This means that the shape of the pattern does not depend on how closely you look at it. Self-similarity is found in fractals. Examples of natural fractals are coast lines and tree shapes, which repeat their shape regardless of what magnification you view at. While self-similar patterns can appear indefinitely complex, the rules needed to describe or produce their formation can be simple (e.g. Lindenmayer systems describing tree shapes).

In pattern theory, devised by Ulf Grenander, mathematicians attempt to describe the world in terms of patterns. The goal is to lay out the world in a more computationally friendly manner.

In the broadest sense, any regularity that can be explained by a scientific theory is a pattern. As in mathematics, science can be taught as a set of patterns.

A recent study from Aesthetics and Psychological Effects of Fractal Based Design suggested that fractal patterns possess self-similar components that repeat at varying size scales. The perceptual experience of human-made environments can be impacted with inclusion of these natural patterns. Previous work has demonstrated consistent trends in preference for and complexity estimates of fractal patterns. However, limited information has been gathered on the impact of other visual judgments. Here we examine the aesthetic and perceptual experience of fractal ‘global-forest’ designs already installed in humanmade spaces and demonstrate how fractal pattern components are associated with positive psychological experiences that can be utilized to promote occupant wellbeing. These designs are composite fractal patterns consisting of individual fractal ‘tree-seeds’ which combine to create a ‘global fractal forest.’ The local ‘tree-seed’ patterns, global configuration of tree-seed locations, and overall resulting ‘global-forest’ patterns have fractal qualities. These designs span multiple mediums yet are all intended to lower occupant stress without detracting from the function and overall design of the space. In this series of studies, we first establish divergent relationships between various visual attributes, with pattern complexity, preference, and engagement ratings increasing with fractal complexity compared to ratings of refreshment and relaxation which stay the same or decrease with complexity. Subsequently, we determine that the local constituent fractal (‘tree-seed’) patterns contribute to the perception of the overall fractal design, and address how to balance aesthetic and psychological effects (such as individual experiences of perceived engagement and relaxation) in fractal design installations. This set of studies demonstrates that fractal preference is driven by a balance between increased arousal (desire for engagement and complexity) and decreased tension (desire for relaxation or refreshment). Installations of these composite mid-high complexity ‘global-forest’ patterns consisting of ‘tree-seed’ components balance these contrasting needs, and can serve as a practical implementation of biophilic patterns in human-made environments to promote occupant wellbeing.

<doc id="68353" wikidata="Q855248" url="?curid=68353" title="Solar furnace">
<text>A solar furnace is a structure that uses concentrated solar power to produce high temperatures, usually for industry. Parabolic mirrors or heliostats concentrate light (Insolation) onto a focal point. The temperature at the focal point may reach , and this heat can be used to generate electricity, melt steel, make hydrogen fuel or nanomaterials.

The largest solar furnace is at Odeillo in the Pyrénées-Orientales in France, opened in 1970. It employs an array of plane mirrors to gather sunlight, reflecting it onto a larger curved mirror.

== History ==

The ancient Greek / Latin term &quot;heliocaminus&quot; literally means &quot;solar furnace&quot; and refers to a glass-enclosed sunroom intentionally designed to become hotter than the outside air temperature.

Legendary accounts of the Siege of Syracuse (213–212 BC) tell of Archimedes&#x27; heat ray, a set of burnished brass mirrors or burning glasses supposedly used to ignite attacking ships, though modern historians doubt its veracity.

The first modern solar furnace is believed to have been built in France in 1949 by Professor Félix Trombe. The device, the Mont-Louis Solar Furnace is still in place at Mont-Louis. The Pyrenees were chosen as the site because the area experiences clear skies up to 300 days a year.

The Odeillo Solar Furnace is a larger and more powerful solar furnace. It was built between 1962 and 1968, and started operating in 1969. It&#x27;s currently the most powerful, based on an achievable temperature of 3500 °C.

The Solar Furnace of Uzbekistan was built in Uzbekistan and opened in 1981 as a part of a Soviet Union &quot;Sun&quot; Complex Research Facility, being the world largest concentrator.

== Uses ==

The rays are focused onto an area the size of a cooking pot and can reach , depending on the process installed; for example:

* about for metallic receivers producing hot air for the next-generation solar towers as it will be tested at the Themis plant with the Pegase project
* about to produce hydrogen by cracking methane molecules
* up to to test materials for extreme environment such as nuclear reactors or space vehicle atmospheric reentry
* up to to produce nanomaterials by solar induced sublimation and controlled cooling, such as carbon nanotubes or zinc nanoparticles

It has been suggested that solar furnaces could be used in space to provide energy for manufacturing purposes.

Their reliance on sunny weather is a limiting factor as a source of renewable energy on Earth but could be tied to thermal energy storage systems for energy production through these periods and into the night.

== Smaller-scale devices ==
The solar furnace principle is being used to make inexpensive solar cookers and solar-powered barbecues, and for solar water pasteurization. A prototype Scheffler reflector is being constructed in India for use in a solar crematorium. This 50 m2 reflector will generate temperatures of and save 200–300 kg of firewood used per cremation.

<doc id="68360" wikidata="Q451400" url="?curid=68360" title="René Lalique">
<text>René Jules Lalique (; 6 April 1860 – 1 May 1945) was a French jeweller, medallist, and glass designer known for his creations of glass art, perfume bottles, vases, jewellery, chandeliers, clocks, and automobile hood ornaments.

==Life==
Lalique&#x27;s early life was spent learning the methods of design and art he would use in his later life. At the age of two, his family moved to the suburbs of Paris, but traveled to Aÿ for summer holidays. These trips influenced Lalique later on in his naturalistic glasswork. With the death of his father, Lalique began working as an apprentice to goldsmith Louis Aucoc in Paris. Lalique died on 1 May or 5 May 1945, in Paris. René Lalique was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, France. His daughter Suzanne Lalique was the painter and set designer for the Comédie-Française. His granddaughter, Marie Claude-Lalique (b. 1936), was also a glass maker who died on 14 April 2003 in Fort Myers, Florida.

==Education==
In 1872, when he was twelve, René entered the Collège Turgot, where he started drawing and sketching. He attended evening classes at the Ecole des arts décoratifs. He worked there from 1874 to 1876 and subsequently spent two years at the Crystal Palace School of Art Sydenham, London. During that time, he also practised as an apprentice goldsmith to leading Parisian Art Nouveau jeweller and goldsmith Louis Aucoc. At the Sydenham Art College, his skills for graphic design were improved, and his naturalistic approach to art was further developed.

In 1876, at 16, René Lalique was apprenticed to the jeweler Louis Aucoc. Aucoc was among the leading jewelers working in Paris at the time, and this provided the young René Lalique with an excellent opportunity to learn jewelry production and design. During this time, Lalique also studied at the Ecole des Arts Decoratifs in Paris. By 1881, Lalique worked as a freelance designer for several French jewelry firms, including Cartier and Boucheron. In 1886, he started working in his workshop in Paris, in the former workshop of Jules Destape.
In 1890, René Lalique opened a jewelry store in the Opéra district of Paris. While working in this new shop, some of René Lalique&#x27;s most famous jewelry designs were created, as well as his experimentation and use of glass.
The main motif of Lalique&#x27;s jewelry design was the natural world. His designs often featured motifs such as dragonflies, orchids, and peacocks, crafted using a combination of enamel, gemstones, and semi-precious materials. Lalique surrounded himself at work with flowers to serve as subtle inspiration for his art. These motifs symbolized the organic flow of life, metamorphosis, and beauty in motion. He was influenced not only by the nature of the French countryside but also by the motifs of Japanese nature art. And he incorporated many materials into his jewelry that were not widely used in high-end jewelry in his time, including glass, horn, pearl, semi-precious stones, enamel, and ivory. He used typical period gemstones only for artistic appearance and not for their value. Therefore, his Lalique jewelry creations were not just holders of precious stones, they were works of art in their own right, creating worldwide interest and great demand.

==Art Nouveau jewellery designer==
When he returned from England, he worked as a freelance artist, designing pieces of jewellery for French jewelers Cartier, Boucheron, and others. In 1885, he opened his own business, designed and made his own jewellery and other glass pieces. After 1895, Lalique also created pieces for Samuel Bing&#x27;s Paris shop, the Maison de l&#x27;Art Nouveau, which gave Art Nouveau its name.
One of Lalique&#x27;s major patrons was Calouste Sarkis Gulbenkian, who commissioned more than 140 of his works over nearly 30 years.

==Glass maker==
Lalique was best known for his creations in glass art. In the 1920s, he became noted for his work in the Art Deco style. He was responsible for the walls of lighted glass and elegant coloured glass columns which filled the dining room and &quot;grand salon&quot; of the and the interior fittings, cross, screens, reredos and font of St. Matthew&#x27;s Church at Millbrook in Jersey (Lalique&#x27;s &quot;Glass Church&quot;). 
As part of the Art Nouveau style, many of his jewellery pieces and vases showcase plants, flowers and flowing lines.

In 1907, Lalique began collaborating with François Coty to design luxury perfume bottles. He eventually created hundreds of different models, many of which became iconic, for companies such as Guerlain, Houbigant, Worth, Rogeret et Gallet, D&#x27;Orsay, Forvil, and Worth. 

Lalique was also a pioneer in the use of &#x27;pâte-de-verre,&#x27; an ancient glassworking technique, which he used to mold ground glass into intricate, lifelike forms in both jewelry and decorative objects.

Both unique and commercial works of René Lalique are in the collections of a large number of public museums around the world including the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian in Lisbon, the Lalique Museum of Hakone in Japan, the and the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in France, the in Germany, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Metropolitan Museum and the Corning Museum in New York State, and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

<doc id="68363" wikidata="Q321638" url="?curid=68363" title="Chick Hearn">
<text>Francis Dayle &quot;Chick&quot; Hearn (November 27, 1916 – August 5, 2002) was an American sportscaster who was the play-by-play announcer for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association for 41 years, as well as the team&#x27;s assistant general manager for seven years beginning in 1972. Hearn was the first broadcaster named to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. Hearn is remembered for his rapid fire, staccato broadcasting style, associated with colorful phrases such as &quot;slam dunk&quot;, &quot;air ball&quot;, and &quot;no harm, no foul&quot; that have become common basketball vernacular. Hearn broadcast 3,338 consecutive Lakers games starting on November 21, 1965. 
Most of Hearn&#x27;s games in the television era were simulcast on both radio and television, even after most teams chose to use different announcers for the different media.

==Life and career==

===Early life and nickname===
Hearn was born in Buda, Illinois and raised in Aurora, Illinois, in west suburban Chicago, and attended high school at Marmion Academy and college at Bradley University. He earned the nickname &quot;Chick&quot; while an Amateur Athletic Union basketball player at Bradley, when teammates played a prank on him: giving him a shoebox to see his surprised reaction when he opened it and found not sneakers inside, but instead a dead chicken.

He and his wife Marge were married August 13, 1938. They had two children, a son, Gary, and a daughter, Samantha aka Janice, both of whom predeceased Hearn. His granddaughter is Shannon. Marge Hearn died January 30, 2016, at the age of 98.

===Broadcasting streak===
Hearn&#x27;s broadcasting streak began on November 21, 1965. Hearn missed the Lakers&#x27; game the previous night after having been stranded in Fayetteville, Arkansas, by inclement weather after having announced a game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. Even that was only Hearn&#x27;s second missed assignment for the Lakers since he had become the team&#x27;s broadcaster in March 1961. He would not miss another until December 16, 2001. Over the course of the streak, Hearn was paired with several different color commentators, including ”Hot” Rod Hundley, Pat Riley, Keith Erickson, Dick Schad, Lynn Shackelford and Stu Lantz.

Hearn&#x27;s streak of 3,338 consecutive Lakers games came to an end on December 16, 2001, in order to undergo scheduled cardiac bypass surgery. Hearn recovered from his surgery, but in February 2002, he suffered a broken hip after falling at a gas station, which further delayed his expected return to the Lakers broadcast booth. Hearn recovered from both issues and resumed broadcasting on April 9, 2002, receiving a standing ovation from the Staples Center crowd upon his return. His final broadcast was for the Lakers&#x27; radio feed of Game 4 of the 2002 NBA Finals where the Lakers defeated the New Jersey Nets to win their third consecutive NBA championship. His final Lakers-affiliated appearance was as the emcee of the team&#x27;s 2002 championship parade in June.

===Assistant general manager===
Hearn became assistant general manager of the Lakers in 1972, hired by Jack Kent Cooke, the team&#x27;s owner at the time. Hearn advised management on personnel and trades, and helped negotiate player contracts as part of the role which he held for seven years. Hearn advised team owner Cooke to draft future hall of fame player Magic Johnson in 1979.

===Non-Lakers work===
Hearn was the long-time host of &quot;Bowling for Dollars&quot; on KTLA (1972–1976); KHJ-TV (now KCAL-TV) (1978). He called the closed-circuit television broadcast of the first Ali-Frazier fight in 1971. He also did boxing commentary for Forum boxing fights in Inglewood in the 1980s, usually appearing alongside former featherweight contender Ruben Castillo. Hearn also contributed to KCAL-TV&#x27;s coverage of the U.S. Open golf tournament from 1957 to 1964. At the time, Hearn handled the sports desk of the local news program on Los Angeles&#x27; NBC affiliate, KRCA (now KNBC). Hearn announced USC football and basketball games from 1956 to 1961, and also served as the play-by-play broadcaster for USC football games on tape-delayed, syndicated telecasts during the 1973 season. Hearn called UNLV Runnin&#x27; Rebels basketball games on KHJ/KCAL with Ross Porter from 1986 to 1990. During the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, Hearn called the play-by-play for USA Men&#x27;s Basketball games on the pay per view Olympics Triplecast &quot;Red&quot; channel.

====Television and movie work====
*&quot;The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh&quot;: Played a basketball announcer in a basketball version of The Bad News Bears though the players in the story were adults. The movie provided an acting turn for Julius Erving.
* &quot;Fletch&quot;: Plays himself interviewing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and while describing Fletch (Chevy Chase) in a dream points out &quot;(Fletch) is actually 6&#x27;5&quot; but with the afro 6&#x27;9&quot;, pretty good dribbler...this gritty kid from the streets of Harlem really creates excitement. $4 million a year, that&#x27;s true, but he earns every nickel of it. Look how he shakes off four, five players with ease!&quot;
*&quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;: Voiced an announcer in the episode Basket Brawl (season 2 episode 14). The episode involved Jon, Nermal, and Odie trying to get picnic food past Garfield. Hearn voiced a mouse announcer named &quot;Chick Mouse&quot; while the game&#x27;s audience was mice.
*&quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;
**&quot;Splashdown&quot;: The episode involved Hearn as a news commentator as an American manned spacecraft was scheduled to splashdown near the island.
**&quot;It&#x27;s a Bird, It&#x27;s a Plane&quot;: Hearn&#x27;s voice is heard on the radio in this episode.
*&quot;The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;: He was the play-by-play for the game between the Globetrotters and the robot team they were playing.
*&quot;The Love Bug&quot;: Played a reporter during and following a race.
*&quot;Matlock&quot;: Played a professional wrestling announcer in the second-season episode &quot;The Annihilator&quot;.
*&quot;Rugrats&quot;: Hearn voiced himself in the episode &quot;Touchdown Tommy&quot; while the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Oilers contest the Ultra Bowl.
*&quot;The Simpsons&quot;: Voiced himself in the episode &quot;Homer Defined&quot; while calling a Lakers game. In the game, Magic Johnson pulls a &quot;Homer&quot; when he slips on the basketball court yet the ball ends up going into the basket.
*&quot;My Three Sons&quot;: Appeared as the announcer of a model airplane flight competition in the 1962 episode &quot;Air Derby&quot;.
*&quot;The Fugitive&quot;: Season one, episode 30 Appeared as TV Newscaster
*&quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;: Uncredited role as a radio announcer for the Rams-Steelers game.
*&quot;Sport Goofy in Soccermania&quot;: Voiced the announcer of the soccer game.

====Music====
Hearn can be heard on the Pink Floyd album &quot;The Wall&quot; (at the 4:07 mark of the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me Now&quot; as &quot;Pink&quot; flips through television channels just before destroying his television set leading into the song &quot;Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 3&quot;). This clip of Hearn appears to have been taken from an actual game between the Lakers and Bulls which was probably recorded during the 1978–79 season. 
Before the playoffs in the 1986 season, Hearn released a 12-inch rap single &quot;Rap-Around&quot;. The song features Hearn in the studio re-creating many of his most famous &#x27;Chickisms&#x27; and was distributed by Macola Records (who distributed an early Dr. Dre/Ice Cube group &quot;World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru&quot;). The song was played on Los Angeles TV and radio stations, including the Lakers&#x27; televised games .

===Death===
During the summer of 2002, Hearn suffered a fall at his home in Encino, California, and struck his head causing serious injury. Three days later, on August 5, 2002, he died of his injury. He was 85. He was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California, next to his son Gary and his daughter Shannon. Chick and Marge would have celebrated their 64th wedding anniversary on August 13, 2002.

==Honors==

On May 9, 1991, Hearn became the third broadcaster to win the Gowdy Award from the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts. He later became the first broadcaster inducted into the Hall in 2003. In 1995, he was voted to be the 20th member of the American Sportscaster Hall of Fame by his fellow sportscasters. He was inducted by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame in 1997.

In honor of his contributions to the Los Angeles Lakers, both the Lakers and the city of Los Angeles renamed a portion of West 11th Street between Figueroa Street and Georgia Street (now L.A. Live Way) to Chick Hearn Court. This street currently runs alongside Crypto.com Arena&#x27;s main entrance. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority further honored the broadcaster by changing the name of the nearby A and E line station to &quot;Pico/Chick Hearn&quot;. His name was later hung from the rafters of the Staples Center, alongside the retired numbers of past Lakers players, though with a microphone in place of a number.

Hearn also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in radio. Hearn&#x27;s star is located at 6755 Hollywood Blvd.

On April 27, 2010, Hearn was honored with a bronze statue at Star Plaza outside Staples Center. A chair next to Hearn&#x27;s statue behind the desk with the Lakers&#x27; logo is a part of the statue so his fans can sit down to have their pictures taken.

==On-air style and demeanor==
Hearn was notable for his focus on calling play-by-play. He did not chitchat while the game was in motion. He was able to report clearly and rapidly, which he considered a gift. This style was especially well-suited for his notable simulcasts of Lakers games on television and radio, which were a tradition during his 40-plus year tenure. He was especially appreciated on radio because listening to the broadcast was almost like watching the game. Shortly after Hearn&#x27;s departure, the simulcasts were ended, with some listeners complaining that his successor, Paul Sunderland, was difficult to follow for radio listeners. Sometimes this style made it difficult for his partners to get a word in edgewise; his seven-year color commentator, Keith Erickson, fondly reminisced at a ceremony commemorating Hearn: &quot;Not being able to talk for eight years [as his partner], I thought this was a great opportunity to share a bit&quot;. He was formal, always referring to the Lakers&#x27; former owner as &quot;Mr. Cooke&quot; and the owner for much of his tenure, Jerry Buss by his full title – Dr. Jerry Buss or Dr. Buss.

==Chickisms==
The particular phrases that Hearn used during his broadcasts were labeled &quot;Chickisms&quot;. Many are staples of basketball. When a book of his memoirs was published in 2004, it included an audio CD with the calls as well as a &quot;Chick Hearn Rap-Around&quot; rap song created with the samples.

*My grandmother could guard him, and she can&#x27;t go to her left!: Said of a slow, out of shape, or hurt player.
*Nervous time: When the final moments of a game are pressure-packed.
*94-by-50 hunk of wood: The basketball court, based on the floor&#x27;s dimensions. (Attacking 47 feet: The front court.) 
*No harm, no foul (no blood, no ambulance, no stitches): A no-call by an official when varying degrees of contact have occurred. (More adjectives means the non-call was more questionable.)
*Not Phi Beta Kappa: Not a smart play.
*...Since Hector was a pup A very long time (e.g., the Lakers haven&#x27;t had the lead since Hector was a pup.)
* He&#x27;s in the Popcorn Machine (with butter and salt all over him): Meaning that a defender got faked into the air (and out of play) by an offensive player&#x27;s pump fake. (&quot;Popcorn Machine&quot; is a reference to an actual popcorn machine in the old Los Angeles Sports Arena, which was near the basket, but far from the court. Thus, if the player went far out of play, he was in the &quot;popcorn machine.&quot;) When Hearn guest starred as a mouse in the Garfield and Friends episode Basket Brawl, Odie literally runs into a popcorn machine.
*(He&#x27;s) on him like a postage stamp: Very tight defense.
*Picks up the garbage and takes it to the dump: Picks up a loose ball and scores.
*Pulling a Larson: A particularly inelegant play.
*Rock the baby: An amazing slam dunk, in a regular season game in 1983, that Julius Erving scored over Michael Cooper.
*Somebody left the window open: Somebody misses an outside shot, badly.
*Seventeen five-oh-five, standing at the Forum: When a play drew universal acclaim (17,505 was the seating capacity for the Inglewood Forum)
*Slam dunk!: Hearn&#x27;s most famous phrase; a powerful shot where a player forces the ball through the rim with one or both hands.
*(He was) standing there, combing his hair: When a player uninvolved with the action comes up with the ball and gets an easy shot.
*(He) takes him to the third floor and leaves him at the mezzanine: A move where an offensive player pump-fakes a defender and draws a foul from the leaping player.
*Tattoo dribble: A player dribbling the ball while not moving, as though tattooing the floor with the ball, as he waits for the play to develop.
*This game&#x27;s in the refrigerator: the door is closed, the lights are out, the eggs are cooling, the butter&#x27;s getting hard and the Jell-O&#x27;s jigglin&#x27;!: The game&#x27;s outcome is set; only the final score is in question. Chick&#x27;s variation on &quot;the game&#x27;s on ice.&quot; (Reportedly, he set a record for the earliest he&#x27;s ever said this during the February 4, 1987 game against the Sacramento Kings, who were down 40–4 after the first quarter.)
*Throws up a 5 footer, misses by 3: When a player throws up a close shot and misses by a lot.
*Throws up a brick: When a player tosses up a particularly errant shot, particularly one that bounces off the front of the rim.
*Throws up a prayer (...it&#x27;s (or isn&#x27;t) answered!!!): A wild shot that will need a miracle to score (and does or doesn&#x27;t).
*Ticky-tack: A foul called when very little contact has been made.
* (On his) wallet: A player fell on his rear end. When Lynn Shackleford, color man 1970–77, who liked to sass his rather straitlaced senior partner, remarked once that a player had landed on his backside, Hearn admonished him in all seriousness, &quot;That&#x27;s his &quot;wallet&quot;.&quot;
*Words-eye view: What listeners received while listening to Hearn call the game on the radio.
*(He&#x27;s) working on his Wrigleys. A player is chewing gum.
*(Passes over to) Wouldn&#x27;t You?: A player passes the ball over to a player who&#x27;s very hot at the time.
*(He&#x27;s) yo-yo-ing up and down: A player dribbles in one place as if he were playing with a yo-yo on a string.
*(He&#x27;s dribbling) left to right (or right to left) across your dial: To let people who were listening to radio know which direction the ball was going up the court.
*(He&#x27;s) alone, he sets, he fires, he gets!: Player not defended who stops, sets and shoots.
*Fall Back Baby, she&#x27;s in there!: Said of a made shot by Lakers player Dick Barnett whose nickname was &#x27;Fall Back Baby&#x27;.

<text>Christian Pineau (; 14 October 1904 – 5 April 1995) was a noted French Resistance fighter, who later served an important term as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1956 through 1958.

==Life and career==
Pineau was born in 1904 in Chaumont-en-Bassigny, Haute-Marne, France. His father was a colonel in the French Army died when he was a young child. His mother married again to the French playwright Jean Giraudoux. Later, Christian Pineau would say that it was Giraudoux who gave him his love of writing. He was educated at the École alsacienne in Paris and graduated with degrees in law and in political science. In 1931 he joined the staff of the Bank of France, and later worked for the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas. In 1937 he founded the journal &quot; Banque et Bourse&quot;.

A World War II French Resistance leader who established a network called Phalanx, Pineau helped found the underground newspaper &quot;Libération&quot;. He was a close ally of Charles de Gaulle and went on dangerous secret missions passing communications between occupied France and the Free France headquarters in London. He was arrested by the &quot;Gestapo&quot; in September 1942 but escaped. He was arrested again in 1943 and evaded a death sentence through forged identity papers which hid his true identity. He was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp, and remained there until it was liberated by American soldiers in 1945.

Pineau represented the Sarthe department as a Socialist in the French National Assembly from 1946 to 1958. After the war, he served as a minister in French governments, 1945–1958. He was minister of supply in Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s government (1945) and minister of public works (1947–1950) in various governments.
Pineau was finance minister for a short time in 1948. He was designated as prime minister of France by President René Coty after the February 1955 resignation of Pierre Mendès-France, but the National Assembly refused to ratify his cabinet by 312 votes against 268; his prime ministership lasted for two days between 17 and 19 February 1955.

As foreign minister (February 1956 – May 1958), Pineau was responsible for handling the Suez crisis and for signing the Treaty of Rome on behalf of France. With Guy Mollet, he visited Moscow. In October 1956, he signed the Protocol of Sèvres with Great Britain and Israel on behalf of France.

Pineau was a lifelong advocate of European integration.

Pineau is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery, Paris.

==Bibliography==
Pineau wrote several political books and memoirs:
*&quot;La simple vérité, regard sur la période 1940–1945&quot; (&quot;the simple truth, a view of the period 1940–45&quot;), Editions Julliard

<text>Computer chess includes both hardware (dedicated computers) and software capable of playing chess. Computer chess provides opportunities for players to practice even in the absence of human opponents, and also provides opportunities for analysis, entertainment and training. Computer chess applications that play at the level of a chess grandmaster or higher are available on hardware from supercomputers to smart phones. Standalone chess-playing machines are also available. Stockfish, Leela Chess Zero, GNU Chess, Fruit, and other free open source applications are available for various platforms.

Computer chess applications, whether implemented in hardware or software, use different strategies than humans to choose their moves: they use heuristic methods to build, search and evaluate trees representing sequences of moves from the current position and attempt to execute the best such sequence during play. Such trees are typically quite large, thousands to millions of nodes. The computational speed of modern computers, capable of processing tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of nodes or more per second, along with extension and reduction heuristics that narrow the tree to mostly relevant nodes, make such an approach effective.

The first chess machines capable of playing chess or reduced chess-like games were software programs running on digital computers early in the vacuum-tube computer age (1950s). The early programs played so poorly that even a beginner could defeat them. Within 40 years, in 1997, chess engines running on super-computers or specialized hardware were capable of defeating even the best human players. By 2006, programs running on desktop PCs had attained the same capability. In 2006, Monty Newborn, Professor of Computer Science at McGill University, declared: &quot;the science has been done&quot;. Nevertheless, solving chess is not currently possible for modern computers due to the game&#x27;s extremely large number of possible variations.

Computer chess was once considered the &quot;Drosophila of AI&quot;, the edge of knowledge engineering. The field is now considered a scientifically completed paradigm, and playing chess is a mundane computing activity.

== Availability and playing strength ==
In the past, stand-alone chess machines (usually microprocessors running software chess programs; occasionally specialized hardware) were sold. Today, chess engines may be installed as software on ordinary devices like smartphones and PCs, either alone or alongside GUI programs such as Chessbase and the mobile apps for Chess.com and Lichess (both primarily websites). Examples of free and open source engines include Stockfish and Leela Chess Zero (Lc0). Chess.com maintains its own proprietary engine named Torch. Some chess engines, including Stockfish, have web versions made in languages like WebAssembly and JavaScript. Most chess programs and sites offer the ability to analyze positions and games using chess engines, and some offer the ability to play against engines (which can be set to play at custom levels of strength) as though they were normal opponents.

Hardware requirements for chess engines are minimal, but performance will vary with processor speed, and memory, needed to hold large transposition tables. 
Most modern chess engines, such as Stockfish, rely on efficiently updatable neural networks, tailored to be run exclusively on CPUs, but Lc0 uses networks reliant on GPU performance. Top engines such as Stockfish can be expected to beat the world&#x27;s best players reliably, even when running on consumer-grade hardware.

== Types and features of chess software ==
Perhaps the most common type of chess software are programs that simply play chess. A human player makes a move on the board, the AI calculates and plays a subsequent move, and the human and AI alternate turns until the game ends. The chess engine, which calculates the moves, and the graphical user interface (GUI) are sometimes separate programs. Different engines can be connected to the GUI, permitting play against different styles of opponent. Engines often have a simple text command-line interface, while GUIs may offer a variety of piece sets, board styles, or even 3D or animated pieces. Because recent engines are so capable, engines or GUIs may offer some way of handicapping the engine&#x27;s ability, to improve the odds for a win by the human player. Universal Chess Interface (UCI) engines such as Fritz or Rybka may have a built-in mechanism for reducing the Elo rating of the engine (via UCI&#x27;s uci_limitstrength and uci_elo parameters). Some versions of Fritz have a Handicap and Fun mode for limiting the current engine or changing the percentage of mistakes it makes or changing its style. Fritz also has a Friend Mode where during the game it tries to match the level of the player.

Chess databases allow users to search through a large library of historical games, analyze them, check statistics, and formulate an opening repertoire. Chessbase (for PC) is a common program for these purposes amongst professional players, but there are alternatives such as Shane&#x27;s Chess Information Database (Scid) for Windows, Mac or Linux, Chess Assistant for PC, Gerhard Kalab&#x27;s Chess PGN Master for Android or Giordano Vicoli&#x27;s Chess-Studio for iOS.

Programs such as Playchess allow players to play against one another over the internet.

Chess training programs teach chess. Chessmaster had playthrough tutorials by IM Josh Waitzkin and GM Larry Christiansen. Stefan Meyer-Kahlen offers Shredder Chess Tutor based on the Step coursebooks of Rob Brunia and Cor Van Wijgerden. Former World Champion Magnus Carlsen&#x27;s Play Magnus company released a Magnus Trainer app for Android and iOS. Chessbase has Fritz and Chesster for children. Convekta provides a large number of training apps such as CT-ART and its Chess King line based on tutorials by GM Alexander Kalinin and Maxim Blokh.

There is also software for handling chess problems.

== Computers versus humans ==
After discovering refutation screening—the application of alpha–beta pruning to optimizing move evaluation—in 1957, a team at Carnegie Mellon University predicted that a computer would defeat the world human champion by 1967. It did not anticipate the difficulty of determining the right order to evaluate moves. Researchers worked to improve programs&#x27; ability to identify killer heuristics, unusually high-scoring moves to reexamine when evaluating other branches, but into the 1970s most top chess players believed that computers would not soon be able to play at a Master level. In 1968, International Master David Levy made a famous bet that no chess computer would be able to beat him within ten years, and in 1976 Senior Master and professor of psychology Eliot Hearst of Indiana University wrote that &quot;the only way a current computer program could ever win a single game against a master player would be for the master, perhaps in a drunken stupor while playing 50 games simultaneously, to commit some once-in-a-year blunder&quot;.

In the late 1970s chess programs began defeating highly skilled human players. The year of Hearst&#x27;s statement, Northwestern University&#x27;s Chess 4.5 at the Paul Masson American Chess Championship&#x27;s Class B level became the first to win a human tournament. Levy won his bet in 1978 by beating Chess 4.7, but it achieved the first computer victory against a Master-class player at the tournament level by winning one of the six games. In 1980, Belle began often defeating Masters. By 1982 two programs played at Master level and three were slightly weaker.

The sudden improvement without a theoretical breakthrough was unexpected, as many did not expect that Belle&#x27;s ability to examine 100,000 positions a second—about eight plies—would be sufficient. The Spracklens, creators of the successful microcomputer program &quot;Sargon&quot;, estimated that 90% of the improvement came from faster evaluation speed and only 10% from improved evaluations. &quot;New Scientist&quot; stated in 1982 that computers &quot;play &quot;terrible&quot; chess ... clumsy, inefficient, diffuse, and just plain ugly&quot;, but humans lost to them by making &quot;horrible blunders, astonishing lapses, incomprehensible oversights, gross miscalculations, and the like&quot; much more often than they realized; &quot;in short, computers win primarily through their ability to find and exploit miscalculations in human initiatives&quot;.

By 1982, microcomputer chess programs could evaluate up to 1,500 moves a second and were as strong as mainframe chess programs of five years earlier, able to defeat a majority of amateur players. While only able to look ahead one or two plies more than at their debut in the mid-1970s, doing so improved their play more than experts expected; seemingly minor improvements &quot;appear to have allowed the crossing of a psychological threshold, after which a rich harvest of human error becomes accessible&quot;, &quot;New Scientist&quot; wrote. While reviewing &quot;SPOC&quot; in 1984, &quot;BYTE&quot; wrote that &quot;Computers—mainframes, minis, and micros—tend to play ugly, inelegant chess&quot;, but noted Robert Byrne&#x27;s statement that &quot;tactically they are freer from error than the average human player&quot;. The magazine described &quot;SPOC&quot; as a &quot;state-of-the-art chess program&quot; for the IBM PC with a &quot;surprisingly high&quot; level of play, and estimated its USCF rating as 1700 (Class B).

At the 1982 North American Computer Chess Championship, Monroe Newborn predicted that a chess program could become world champion within five years; tournament director and International Master Michael Valvo predicted ten years; the Spracklens predicted 15; Ken Thompson predicted more than 20; and others predicted that it would never happen. The most widely held opinion, however, stated that it would occur around the year 2000. In 1989, Levy was defeated by Deep Thought in an exhibition match. Deep Thought, however, was still considerably below World Championship level, as the reigning world champion, Garry Kasparov, demonstrated in two strong wins in 1989. It was not until a 1996 match with IBM&#x27;s Deep Blue that Kasparov lost his first game to a computer at tournament time controls in Deep Blue versus Kasparov, 1996, game 1. This game was, in fact, the first time a reigning world champion had lost to a computer using regular time controls. However, Kasparov regrouped to win three and draw two of the remaining five games of the match, for a convincing victory.

In May 1997, an updated version of Deep Blue defeated Kasparov 3½–2½ in a return match. A documentary mainly about the confrontation was made in 2003, titled &quot;Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine&quot;.

With increasing processing power and improved evaluation functions, chess programs running on commercially available workstations began to rival top-flight players. In 1998, Rebel 10 defeated Viswanathan Anand, who at the time was ranked second in the world, by a score of 5–3. However, most of those games were not played at normal time controls. Out of the eight games, four were blitz games (five minutes plus five seconds Fischer delay for each move); these Rebel won 3–1. Two were semi-blitz games (fifteen minutes for each side) that Rebel won as well (1½–½). Finally, two games were played as regular tournament games (forty moves in two hours, one hour sudden death); here it was Anand who won ½–1½. In fast games, computers played better than humans, but at classical time controls – at which a player&#x27;s rating is determined – the advantage was not so clear.

In the early 2000s, commercially available programs such as Junior and Fritz were able to draw matches against former world champion Garry Kasparov and classical world champion Vladimir Kramnik.

In October 2002, Vladimir Kramnik and Deep Fritz competed in the eight-game Brains in Bahrain match, which ended in a draw. Kramnik won games 2 and 3 by &quot;conventional&quot; anti-computer tactics – play conservatively for a long-term advantage the computer is not able to see in its game tree search. Fritz, however, won game 5 after a severe blunder by Kramnik. Game 6 was described by the tournament commentators as &quot;spectacular&quot;. Kramnik, in a better position in the early middlegame, tried a piece sacrifice to achieve a strong tactical attack, a strategy known to be highly risky against computers who are at their strongest defending against such attacks. True to form, Fritz found a watertight defense and Kramnik&#x27;s attack petered out leaving him in a bad position. Kramnik resigned the game, believing the position lost. However, post-game human and computer analysis has shown that the Fritz program was unlikely to have been able to force a win and Kramnik effectively sacrificed a drawn position. The final two games were draws. Given the circumstances, most commentators still rate Kramnik the stronger player in the match.

In January 2003, Kasparov played Junior, another chess computer program, in New York City. The match ended 3–3.

In November 2003, Kasparov played X3D Fritz. The match ended 2–2.

In 2005, Hydra, a dedicated chess computer with custom hardware and sixty-four processors and also winner of the 14th IPCCC in 2005, defeated seventh-ranked Michael Adams 5½–½ in a six-game match (though Adams&#x27; preparation was far less thorough than Kramnik&#x27;s for the 2002 series).

In November–December 2006, World Champion Vladimir Kramnik played Deep Fritz. This time the computer won; the match ended 2–4. Kramnik was able to view the computer&#x27;s opening book. In the first five games Kramnik steered the game into a typical &quot;anti-computer&quot; positional contest. He lost one game (overlooking a mate in one), and drew the next four. In the final game, in an attempt to draw the match, Kramnik played the more aggressive Sicilian Defence and was crushed.

There was speculation that interest in human–computer chess competition would plummet as a result of the 2006 Kramnik-Deep Fritz match. According to Newborn, for example, &quot;the science is done&quot;.

Human–computer chess matches showed the best computer systems overtaking human chess champions in the late 1990s. For the 40 years prior to that, the trend had been that the best machines gained about 40 points per year in the Elo rating while the best humans only gained roughly 2 points per year. The highest rating obtained by a computer in human competition was Deep Thought&#x27;s USCF rating of 2551 in 1988 and FIDE no longer accepts human–computer results in their rating lists. Specialized machine-only Elo pools have been created for rating machines, but such numbers, while similar in appearance, are not directly compared. In 2016, the Swedish Chess Computer Association rated computer program Komodo at 3361.

Chess engines continue to improve. In 2009, chess engines running on slower hardware reached the grandmaster level. A mobile phone won a category 6 tournament with a performance rating 2898: chess engine Hiarcs 13 running inside Pocket Fritz 4 on the mobile phone HTC Touch HD won the Copa Mercosur tournament in Buenos Aires, Argentina with 9 wins and 1 draw on August 4–14, 2009. Pocket Fritz 4 searches fewer than 20,000 positions per second. This is in contrast to supercomputers such as Deep Blue that searched 200 million positions per second.

Advanced Chess is a form of chess developed in 1998 by Kasparov where a human plays against another human, and both have access to computers to enhance their strength. The resulting &quot;advanced&quot; player was argued by Kasparov to be stronger than a human or computer alone. This has been proven in numerous occasions, such as at Freestyle Chess events.

Players today are inclined to treat chess engines as analysis tools rather than opponents. Chess grandmaster Andrew Soltis stated in 2016 &quot;The computers are just much too good&quot; and that world champion Magnus Carlsen won&#x27;t play computer chess because &quot;he just loses all the time and there&#x27;s nothing more depressing than losing without even being in the game.&quot;

== Computer methods ==
Since the era of mechanical machines that played rook and king endings and electrical machines that played other games like hex in the early years of the 20th century, scientists and theoreticians have sought to develop a procedural representation of how humans learn, remember, think and apply knowledge, and the game of chess, because of its daunting complexity, became the &quot;Drosophila of artificial intelligence (AI)&quot;. The procedural resolution of complexity became synonymous with thinking, and early computers, even before the chess automaton era, were popularly referred to as &quot;electronic brains&quot;. Several different schema were devised starting in the latter half of the 20th century to represent knowledge and thinking, as applied to playing the game of chess (and other games like checkers):

* Search based (brute force vs selective search)
** Search in search based schema (minimax/alpha-beta, Monte Carlo tree search)
** Evaluations in search based schema (machine learning, neural networks, texel tuning, genetic algorithms, gradient descent, reinforcement learning)
* Knowledge based (PARADISE, endgame tablebases)

Using &quot;ends-and-means&quot; heuristics a human chess player can intuitively determine optimal outcomes and how to achieve them regardless of the number of moves necessary, but a computer must be systematic in its analysis. Most players agree that looking at least five moves ahead (ten plies) when necessary is required to play well. Normal tournament rules give each player an average of three minutes per move. On average there are more than 30 legal moves per chess position, so a computer must examine a quadrillion possibilities to look ahead ten plies (five full moves); one that could examine a million positions a second would require more than 30 years.

The earliest attempts at procedural representations of playing chess predated the digital electronic age, but it was the stored program digital computer that gave scope to calculating such complexity. Claude Shannon, in 1949, laid out the principles of algorithmic solution of chess. In that paper, the game is represented by a &quot;tree&quot;, or digital data structure of choices (branches) corresponding to moves. The nodes of the tree were positions on the board resulting from the choices of move. The impossibility of representing an entire game of chess by constructing a tree from first move to last was immediately apparent: there are an average of 36 moves per position in chess and an average game lasts about 35 moves to resignation (60-80 moves if played to checkmate, stalemate, or other draw). There are 400 positions possible after the first move by each player, about 200,000 after two moves each, and nearly 120 million after just 3 moves each.

So a limited lookahead (search) to some depth, followed by using domain-specific knowledge to evaluate the resulting terminal positions was proposed. A kind of middle-ground position, given good moves by both sides, would result, and its evaluation would inform the player about the goodness or badness of the moves chosen. Searching and comparing operations on the tree were well suited to computer calculation; the representation of subtle chess knowledge in the evaluation function was not. The early chess programs suffered in both areas: searching the vast tree required computational resources far beyond those available, and what chess knowledge was useful and how it was to be encoded would take decades to discover.

The developers of a chess-playing computer system must decide on a number of fundamental implementation issues. These include:
* Graphical user interface (GUI) – how moves are entered and communicated to the user, how the game is recorded, how the time controls are set, and other interface considerations
* Board representation – how a single position is represented in data structures;
* Search techniques – how to identify the possible moves and select the most promising ones for further examination;
* Leaf evaluation – how to evaluate the value of a board position, if no further search will be done from that position.

Adriaan de Groot interviewed a number of chess players of varying strengths, and concluded that both masters and beginners look at around forty to fifty positions before deciding which move to play. What makes the former much better players is that they use pattern recognition skills built from experience. This enables them to examine some lines in much greater depth than others by simply not considering moves they can assume to be poor. More evidence for this being the case is the way that good human players find it much easier to recall positions from genuine chess games, breaking them down into a small number of recognizable sub-positions, rather than completely random arrangements of the same pieces. In contrast, poor players have the same level of recall for both.

The equivalent of this in computer chess are evaluation functions for leaf evaluation, which correspond to the human players&#x27; pattern recognition skills, and the use of machine learning techniques in training them, such as Texel tuning, stochastic gradient descent, and reinforcement learning, which corresponds to building experience in human players. This allows modern programs to examine some lines in much greater depth than others by using forwards pruning and other selective heuristics to simply not consider moves the program assume to be poor through their evaluation function, in the same way that human players do. The only fundamental difference between a computer program and a human in this sense is that a computer program can search much deeper than a human player could, allowing it to search more nodes and bypass the horizon effect to a much greater extent than is possible with human players.

=== Graphical user interface ===
Computer chess programs usually support a number of common &quot;de facto&quot; standards. Nearly all of today&#x27;s programs can read and write game moves as Portable Game Notation (PGN), and can read and write individual positions as Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN). Older chess programs often only understood long algebraic notation, but today users expect chess programs to understand standard algebraic chess notation.

Starting in the late 1990s, programmers began to develop separately &quot;engines&quot; (with a command-line interface which calculates which moves are strongest in a position) or a &quot;graphical user interface&quot; (GUI) which provides the player with a chessboard they can see, and pieces that can be moved. Engines communicate their moves to the GUI using a protocol such as the Chess Engine Communication Protocol (CECP) or Universal Chess Interface (UCI). By dividing chess programs into these two pieces, developers can write only the user interface, or only the engine, without needing to write both parts of the program. (See also chess engine.)

Developers have to decide whether to connect the engine to an opening book and/or endgame tablebases or leave this to the GUI.

=== Board representations ===

The data structure used to represent each chess position is key to the performance of move generation and position evaluation. Methods include pieces stored in an array (&quot;mailbox&quot; and &quot;0x88&quot;), piece positions stored in a list (&quot;piece list&quot;), collections of bit-sets for piece locations (&quot;bitboards&quot;), and huffman coded positions for compact long-term storage.

=== Search techniques ===
Computer chess programs consider chess moves as a game tree. In theory, they examine all moves, then all counter-moves to those moves, then all moves countering them, and so on, where each individual move by one player is called a &quot;ply&quot;. This evaluation continues until a certain maximum search depth or the program determines that a final &quot;leaf&quot; position has been reached (e.g. checkmate).

==== Minimax search====
One particular type of search algorithm used in computer chess are minimax search algorithms, where at each ply the &quot;best&quot; move by the player is selected; one player is trying to maximize the score, the other to minimize it. By this alternating process, one particular terminal node whose evaluation represents the searched value of the position will be arrived at. Its value is backed up to the root, and that evaluation becomes the valuation of the position on the board. This search process is called minimax.

A naive implementation of the minimax algorithm can only search to a small depth in a practical amount of time, so various methods have been devised to greatly speed the search for good moves. Alpha–beta pruning, a system of defining upper and lower bounds on possible search results and searching until the bounds coincided, is typically used to reduce the search space of the program.

In addition, various selective search heuristics, such as quiescence search, forward pruning, search extensions and search reductions, are also used as well. These heuristics are triggered based on certain conditions in an attempt to weed out obviously bad moves (history moves) or to investigate interesting nodes (e.g. check extensions, passed pawns on seventh rank, etc.). These selective search heuristics have to be used very carefully however. If the program overextends, it wastes too much time looking at uninteresting positions. If too much is pruned or reduced, there is a risk of cutting out interesting nodes.

==== Monte Carlo tree search ====
Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm which expands the search tree based on random sampling of the search space. A version of Monte Carlo tree search commonly used in computer chess is PUCT, Predictor and Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees.

DeepMind&#x27;s AlphaZero and Leela Chess Zero uses MCTS instead of minimax. Such engines use batching on graphics processing units in order to calculate their evaluation functions and policy (move selection), and therefore require a parallel search algorithm as calculations on the GPU are inherently parallel. The minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms used in computer chess are inherently serial algorithms, so would not work well with batching on the GPU. On the other hand, MCTS is a good alternative, because the random sampling used in Monte Carlo tree search lends itself well to parallel computing, and is why nearly all engines which support calculations on the GPU use MCTS instead of alpha-beta.

==== Other optimizations ====
Many other optimizations can be used to make chess-playing programs stronger. For example, transposition tables are used to record positions that have been previously evaluated, to save recalculation of them. Refutation tables record key moves that &quot;refute&quot; what appears to be a good move; these are typically tried first in variant positions (since a move that refutes one position is likely to refute another). The drawback is that transposition tables at deep ply depths can get quite large – tens to hundreds of millions of entries. IBM&#x27;s Deep Blue transposition table in 1996, for example was 500 million entries. Transposition tables that are too small can result in spending more time searching for non-existent entries due to threshing than the time saved by entries found. Many chess engines use pondering, searching to deeper levels on the opponent&#x27;s time, similar to human beings, to increase their playing strength.

Of course, faster hardware and additional memory can improve chess program playing strength. Hyperthreaded architectures can improve performance modestly if the program is running on a single core or a small number of cores. Most modern programs are designed to take advantage of multiple cores to do parallel search. Other programs are designed to run on a general purpose computer and allocate move generation, parallel search, or evaluation to dedicated processors or specialized co-processors.

==== History ====
The first paper on chess search was by Claude Shannon in 1950. He predicted the two main possible search strategies which would be used, which he labeled &quot;Type A&quot; and &quot;Type B&quot;, before anyone had programmed a computer to play chess.

Type A programs would use a &quot;brute force&quot; approach, examining every possible position for a fixed number of moves using a pure naive minimax algorithm. Shannon believed this would be impractical for two reasons.

First, with approximately thirty moves possible in a typical real-life position, he expected that searching the approximately 109 positions involved in looking three moves ahead for both sides (six plies) would take about sixteen minutes, even in the &quot;very optimistic&quot; case that the chess computer evaluated a million positions every second. (It took about forty years to achieve this speed.) A later search algorithm called alpha–beta pruning, a system of defining upper and lower bounds on possible search results and searching until the bounds coincided, reduced the branching factor of the game tree logarithmically, but it still was not feasible for chess programs at the time to exploit the exponential explosion of the tree.

Second, it ignored the problem of quiescence, trying to only evaluate a position that is at the end of an exchange of pieces or other important sequence of moves (&#x27;lines&#x27;). He expected that adapting minimax to cope with this would greatly increase the number of positions needing to be looked at and slow the program down still further. He expected that adapting type A to cope with this would greatly increase the number of positions needing to be looked at and slow the program down still further.

This led naturally to what is referred to as &quot;selective search&quot; or &quot;type B search&quot;, using chess knowledge (heuristics) to select a few presumably good moves from each position to search, and prune away the others without searching. Instead of wasting processing power examining bad or trivial moves, Shannon suggested that type B programs would use two improvements:
# Employ a quiescence search.
# Employ forward pruning; i.e. only look at a few good moves for each position.

This would enable them to look further ahead (&#x27;deeper&#x27;) at the most significant lines in a reasonable time. However, early attempts at selective search often resulted in the best move or moves being pruned away. As a result, little or no progress was made for the next 25 years dominated by this first iteration of the selective search paradigm. The best program produced in this early period was Mac Hack VI in 1967; it played at the about the same level as the average amateur (C class on the United States Chess Federation rating scale).

Meanwhile, hardware continued to improve, and in 1974, brute force searching was implemented for the first time in the Northwestern University Chess 4.0 program. In this approach, all alternative moves at a node are searched, and none are pruned away. They discovered that the time required to simply search all the moves was much less than the time required to apply knowledge-intensive heuristics to select just a few of them, and the benefit of not prematurely or inadvertently pruning away good moves resulted in substantially stronger performance.

In the 1980s and 1990s, progress was finally made in the selective search paradigm, with the development of quiescence search, null move pruning, and other modern selective search heuristics. These heuristics had far fewer mistakes than earlier heuristics did, and was found to be worth the extra time it saved because it could search deeper and widely adopted by many engines. While many modern programs do use alpha-beta search as a substrate for their search algorithm, these additional selective search heuristics used in modern programs means that the program no longer does a &quot;brute force&quot; search. Instead they heavily rely on these selective search heuristics to extend lines the program considers good and prune and reduce lines the program considers bad, to the point where most of the nodes on the search tree are pruned away, enabling modern programs to search very deep.

In 2006, Rémi Coulom created Monte Carlo tree search, another kind of type B selective search. In 2007, an adaption of Monte Carlo tree search called Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees or UCT for short was created by Levente Kocsis and Csaba Szepesvári. In 2011, Chris Rosin developed a variation of UCT called Predictor + Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees, or PUCT for short. PUCT was then used in AlphaZero in 2017, and later in Leela Chess Zero in 2018.

=== Knowledge versus search (processor speed) ===
In the 1970s, most chess programs ran on super computers like Control Data Cyber 176s or Cray-1s, indicative that during that developmental period for computer chess, processing power was the limiting factor in performance. Most chess programs struggled to search to a depth greater than 3 ply. It was not until the hardware chess machines of the 1980s, that a relationship between processor speed and knowledge encoded in the evaluation function became apparent.

It has been estimated that doubling the computer speed gains approximately fifty to seventy Elo points in playing strength .

=== Leaf evaluation ===

For most chess positions, computers cannot look ahead to all possible final positions. Instead, they must look ahead a few plies and compare the possible positions, known as leaves. The algorithm that evaluates leaves is termed the &quot;evaluation function&quot;, and these algorithms are often vastly different between different chess programs. Evaluation functions typically evaluate positions in hundredths of a pawn (called a centipawn), where by convention, a positive evaluation favors White, and a negative evaluation favors Black. However, some evaluation function output win/draw/loss percentages instead of centipawns.

Historically, handcrafted evaluation functions consider material value along with other factors affecting the strength of each side. When counting up the material for each side, typical values for pieces are 1 point for a pawn, 3 points for a knight or bishop, 5 points for a rook, and 9 points for a queen. (See Chess piece relative value.) The king is sometimes given an arbitrarily high value such as 200 points (Shannon&#x27;s paper) to ensure that a checkmate outweighs all other factors . In addition to points for pieces, most handcrafted evaluation functions take many factors into account, such as pawn structure, the fact that a pair of bishops are usually worth more, centralized pieces are worth more, and so on. The protection of kings is usually considered, as well as the phase of the game (opening, middle or endgame). Machine learning techniques such as Texel turning, stochastic gradient descent, or reinforcement learning are usually used to optimise handcrafted evaluation functions.

Most modern evaluation functions make use of neural networks. The most common evaluation function in use today is the efficiently updatable neural network, which is a shallow neural network whose inputs are piece-square tables. Piece-square tables are a set of 64 values corresponding to the squares of the chessboard, and there typically exists a piece-square table for every piece and colour, resulting in 12 piece-square tables and thus 768 inputs into the neural network. In addition, some engines use deep neural networks in their evaluation function. Neural networks are usually trained using some reinforcement learning algorithm, in conjunction with supervised learning or unsupervised learning.

The output of the evaluation function is a single scalar, quantized in centipawns or other units, which is, in the case of handcrafted evaluation functions, a weighted summation of the various factors described, or in the case of neural network based evaluation functions, the output of the head of the neural network. The evaluation putatively represents or approximates the value of the subtree below the evaluated node as if it had been searched to termination, i.e. the end of the game. During the search, an evaluation is compared against evaluations of other leaves, eliminating nodes that represent bad or poor moves for either side, to yield a node which by convergence, represents the value of the position with best play by both sides.

== Endgame tablebases ==
Endgame play had long been one of the great weaknesses of chess programs because of the depth of search needed. Some otherwise master-level programs were unable to win in positions where even intermediate human players could force a win.

To solve this problem, computers have been used to analyze some chess endgame positions completely, starting with king and pawn against king. Such endgame tablebases are generated in advance using a form of retrograde analysis, starting with positions where the final result is known (e.g., where one side has been mated) and seeing which other positions are one move away from them, then which are one move from those, etc. Ken Thompson was a pioneer in this area.

The results of the computer analysis sometimes surprised people. In 1977 Thompson&#x27;s Belle chess machine used the endgame tablebase for a king and rook against king and queen and was able to draw that theoretically lost ending against several masters (see Philidor position#Queen versus rook). This was despite not following the usual strategy to delay defeat by keeping the defending king and rook close together for as long as possible. Asked to explain the reasons behind some of the program&#x27;s moves, Thompson was unable to do so beyond saying the program&#x27;s database simply returned the best moves.

Most grandmasters declined to play against the computer in the queen versus rook endgame, but Walter Browne accepted the challenge. A queen versus rook position was set up in which the queen can win in thirty moves, with perfect play. Browne was allowed 2½ hours to play fifty moves, otherwise a draw would be claimed under the fifty-move rule. After forty-five moves, Browne agreed to a draw, being unable to force checkmate or win the rook within the next five moves. In the final position, Browne was still seventeen moves away from checkmate, but not quite that far away from winning the rook. Browne studied the endgame, and played the computer again a week later in a different position in which the queen can win in thirty moves. This time, he captured the rook on the fiftieth move, giving him a winning position.

Other positions, long believed to be won, turned out to take more moves against perfect play to actually win than were allowed by chess&#x27;s fifty-move rule. As a consequence, for some years the official FIDE rules of chess were changed to extend the number of moves allowed in these endings. After a while, the rule reverted to fifty moves in all positions more such positions were discovered, complicating the rule still further, and it made no difference in human play, as they could not play the positions perfectly.

Over the years, other endgame database formats have been released including the Edward Tablebase, the De Koning Database and the Nalimov Tablebase which is used by many chess programs such as Rybka, Shredder and Fritz. Tablebases for all positions with six pieces are available. Some seven-piece endgames have been analyzed by Marc Bourzutschky and Yakov Konoval. Programmers using the Lomonosov supercomputers in Moscow have completed a chess tablebase for all endgames with seven pieces or fewer (trivial endgame positions are excluded, such as six white pieces versus a lone black king). In all of these endgame databases it is assumed that castling is no longer possible.

Many tablebases do not consider the fifty-move rule, under which a game where fifty moves pass without a capture or pawn move can be claimed to be a draw by either player. This results in the tablebase returning results such as &quot;Forced mate in sixty-six moves&quot; in some positions which would actually be drawn because of the fifty-move rule. One reason for this is that if the rules of chess were to be changed once more, giving more time to win such positions, it will not be necessary to regenerate all the tablebases. It is also very easy for the program using the tablebases to notice and take account of this &#x27;feature&#x27; and in any case if using an endgame tablebase will choose the move that leads to the quickest win (even if it would fall foul of the fifty-move rule with perfect play). If playing an opponent not using a tablebase, such a choice will give good chances of winning within fifty moves.

The Nalimov tablebases, which use state-of-the-art compression techniques, require 7.05 GB of hard disk space for all five-piece endings. To cover all the six-piece endings requires approximately 1.2 TB. It is estimated that a seven-piece tablebase requires between 50 and 200 TB of storage space.

Endgame databases featured prominently in 1999, when Kasparov played an exhibition match on the Internet against the rest of the world. A seven piece Queen and pawn endgame was reached with the World Team fighting to salvage a draw. Eugene Nalimov helped by generating the six piece ending tablebase where both sides had two Queens which was used heavily to aid analysis by both sides.

The most popular endgame tablebase is syzygy which is used by most top computer programs like Stockfish, Leela Chess Zero, and Komodo. It is also significantly smaller in size than other formats, with 7-piece tablebases taking only 18.4 TB.

For a current state-of-the art chess engine like Stockfish, a table base only provides a very minor increase in playing strength (approximately 3 Elo points for syzygy 6men as of Stockfish 15).

== Opening book ==
Chess engines, like human beings, may save processing time as well as select variations known to be strong via referencing an opening book stored in a database. Opening books cover the opening moves of a game to variable depth, depending on opening and variation, but usually to the first 10-12 moves (20-24 ply). In the early eras of computer chess, trusting variations studied in-depth by human grandmasters for decades was superior to the weak performance of mid-20th-century engines. And even in the contemporary era, allowing computer engines to extensively analyze various openings at their leisure beforehand, and then simply consult the results when in a game, speeds up their play.

In the 1990s, some theorists believed that chess engines of the day had much of their strength in memorized opening books and knowledge dedicated to known positions, and thus believed a valid anti-computer tactic would be to intentionally play some out-of-book moves in order to force the chess program to think for itself. This seems to have been a dubious assumption even then; Garry Kasparov tried it via using the non-standard Mieses Opening at the 1997 Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov Game 1 match, but lost. This tactic became even weaker as time passed; the opening books stored in computer databases can be far more extensive than even the best prepared humans, meaning computers will be well-prepared for even rare variations and know the correct play. More generally, the play of engines even in fully unknown situations (as comes up in variants such as Chess960) is still exceptionally strong, so the lack of an opening book isn&#x27;t even a major disadvantage for tactically sharp chess engines, who can discover strong moves in unfamiliar board variations accurately.

In contemporary engine tournaments, engines are often told to play situations from a variety of openings, including unbalanced ones, to reduce the draw rate and to add more variety to the games.

== Computer chess rating lists ==

CEGT, CSS, SSDF, WBEC, REBEL, FGRL, and IPON maintain rating lists allowing fans to compare the strength of engines. Various versions of Stockfish, Komodo, Leela Chess Zero, and Fat Fritz dominate the rating lists in the early 2020s.

CCRL (Computer Chess Rating Lists) is an organisation that tests computer chess engines&#x27; strength by playing the programs against each other. CCRL was founded in 2006 to promote computer-computer competition and tabulate results on a rating list.

The organisation runs three different lists: 40/40 (40 minutes for every 40 moves played), 40/4 (4 minutes for every 40 moves played), and 40/4 FRC (same time control but Chess960). Pondering (or permanent brain) is switched off and timing is adjusted to the AMD64 X2 4600+ (2.4 GHz) CPU by using Crafty 19.17 BH as a benchmark. Generic, neutral opening books are used (as opposed to the engine&#x27;s own book) up to a limit of 12 moves into the game alongside 4 or 5 man tablebases.

== History ==
=== Pre-computer age ===

The idea of creating a chess-playing machine dates back to the eighteenth century. Around 1769, the chess playing automaton called The Turk, created by Hungarian inventor Farkas Kempelen, became famous before being exposed as a hoax. Before the development of digital computing, serious trials based on automata such as El Ajedrecista of 1912, built by Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo, which played a king and rook versus king ending, were too complex and limited to be useful for playing full games of chess. The field of mechanical chess research languished until the advent of the digital computer in the 1950s.

=== Early software age: selective search and Botvinnik ===
Since then, chess enthusiasts and computer engineers have built, with increasing degrees of seriousness and success, chess-playing machines and computer programs. One of the few chess grandmasters to devote himself seriously to computer chess was former World Chess Champion Mikhail Botvinnik, who wrote several works on the subject. Botvinnik&#x27;s interest in Computer Chess started in the 50s, favouring chess algorithms based on Shannon&#x27;s selective type B strategy, as discussed along with Max Euwe 1958 in Dutch Television. Working with relatively primitive hardware available in the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, Botvinnik had no choice but to investigate software move selection techniques; at the time only the most powerful computers could achieve much beyond a three-ply full-width search, and Botvinnik had no such machines. In 1965 Botvinnik was a consultant to the ITEP team in a US-Soviet computer chess match which won a correspondence chess match against the Kotok-McCarthy-Program led by John McCarthy in 1967.(see Kotok-McCarthy). Later he advised the team that created the chess program Kaissa at Moscow&#x27;s Institute of Control Sciences. Botvinnik had his own ideas to model a Chess Master&#x27;s Mind. After publishing and discussing his early ideas on attack maps and trajectories at Moscow Central Chess Clubin 1966, he found Vladimir Butenko as supporter and collaborator. Butenko first implemented the 15x15 vector attacks board representation on a M-20 computer, determining trajectories. After Botvinnik introduced the concept of Zones in 1970, Butenko refused further cooperation and began to write his own program, dubbed Eureka. In the 70s and 80s, leading a team around Boris Stilman, Alexander Yudin, Alexander Reznitskiy, Michael Tsfasman and Mikhail Chudakov, Botvinnik worked on his own project &#x27;Pioneer&#x27; - which was an Artificial Intelligence based chess project. In the 90s, Botvinnik already in his 80s, he worked on the new project &#x27;CC Sapiens&#x27;.

=== Later software age: full-width search ===
One developmental milestone occurred when the team from Northwestern University, which was responsible for the Chess series of programs and won the first three ACM Computer Chess Championships (1970–72), abandoned type B searching in 1973. The resulting program, Chess 4.0, won that year&#x27;s championship and its successors went on to come in second in both the 1974 ACM Championship and that year&#x27;s inaugural World Computer Chess Championship, before winning the ACM Championship again in 1975, 1976 and 1977. The type A implementation turned out to be just as fast: in the time it used to take to decide which moves were worthy of being searched, it was possible just to search all of them. In fact, Chess 4.0 set the paradigm that was and still is followed essentially by all modern Chess programs today, and that had been successfully started by the Russian ITEP in 1965.

=== Rise of chess machines ===
In 1978, an early rendition of Ken Thompson&#x27;s hardware chess machine Belle, entered and won the North American Computer Chess Championship over the dominant Northwestern University Chess 4.7.

=== Microcomputer revolution ===
Technological advances by orders of magnitude in processing power have made the brute force approach far more incisive than was the case in the early years. The result is that a very solid, tactical AI player aided by some limited positional knowledge built in by the evaluation function and pruning/extension rules began to match the best players in the world. It turned out to produce excellent results, at least in the field of chess, to let computers do what they do best (calculate) rather than coax them into imitating human thought processes and knowledge. In 1997 Deep Blue, a brute-force machine capable of examining 500 million nodes per second, defeated World Champion Garry Kasparov, marking the first time a computer has defeated a reigning world chess champion in standard time control.

=== Super-human chess ===
In 2016, NPR asked experts to characterize the playing style of computer chess engines. Murray Campbell of IBM stated that &quot;Computers don&#x27;t have any sense of aesthetics... They play what they think is the objectively best move in any position, even if it looks absurd, and they can play any move no matter how ugly it is.&quot; Grandmasters Andrew Soltis and Susan Polgar stated that computers are more likely to retreat than humans are.

=== Neural network revolution ===
While neural networks have been used in the evaluation functions of chess engines since the late 1980s, with programs such as NeuroChess, Morph, Blondie25, Giraffe, AlphaZero, and MuZero, neural networks did not become widely adopted by chess engines until the arrival of efficiently updatable neural networks in the summer of 2020. Efficiently updatable neural networks were originally developed in computer shogi in 2018 by Yu Nasu, and had to be first ported to a derivative of Stockfish called Stockfish NNUE on 31 May 2020, and integrated into the official Stockfish engine on 6 August 2020, before other chess programmers began to adopt neural networks into their engines.

Some people, such as the Royal Society&#x27;s Venki Ramakrishnan, believe that AlphaZero lead to the widespread adoption of neural networks in chess engines. However, AlphaZero influenced very few engines to begin using neural networks, and those tended to be new experimental engines such as Leela Chess Zero, which began specifically to replicate the AlphaZero paper. The deep neural networks used in AlphaZero&#x27;s evaluation function required expensive graphics processing units, which were not compatible with existing chess engines. The vast majority of chess engines only use central processing units, and computing and processing information on the GPUs require special libraries in the backend such as Nvidia&#x27;s CUDA, which none of the engines had access to. Thus the vast majority of chess engines such as Komodo and Stockfish continued to use handcrafted evaluation functions until efficiently updatable neural networks were ported to computer chess from computer shogi in 2020, which did not require either the use of GPUs or libraries like CUDA at all. Even then, the neural networks used in computer chess are fairly shallow, and the deep reinforcement learning methods pioneered by AlphaZero are still extremely rare in computer chess.

* Belle 1976
* Bebe, a strong bit-slice processor 1980
* HiTech 1985
* ChipTest 1985
* Deep Thought 1987
* Deep Thought 2 (Deep Blue prototype)~1994
* Deep Blue 1996, 1997
* Hydra, predecessor was called Brutus 2002
* AlphaZero 2017 (used Google&#x27;s Tensor Processing Units for neural networks, but the hardware is not specific to Chess or games)
** MuZero 2019 (similar hardware to its predecessor AlphaZero, non-specific to Chess or e.g. Go), learns the rules of Chess

=== Commercial dedicated computers ===


In the late 1970s to early 1990s, there was a competitive market for dedicated chess computers. This market changed in the mid-1990s when computers with dedicated processors could no longer compete with the fast processors in personal computers.
* Boris in 1977 and Boris Diplomat in 1979, chess computers including pieces and board, sold by Applied Concepts Inc.
* Chess Challenger, a line of chess computers sold by Fidelity Electronics from 1977 to 1992. These models won the first four World Microcomputer Chess Championships.
* ChessMachine, an ARM-based dedicated computer, which could run two engines:
** &quot;The King&quot;, which later became the Chessmaster engine, was also used in the TASC R30 dedicated computer.
** Gideon, a version of Rebel, in 1992 became the first microcomputer to win the World Computer Chess Championship.
* Excalibur Electronics sells a line of beginner strength units.
* Mephisto, a line of chess computers sold by Hegener &amp; Glaser. The units won six consecutive World Microcomputer Chess Championships.
* Novag sold a line of tactically strong computers, including the Constellation, Sapphire, and Star Diamond brands.
* Phoenix Chess Systems makes limited edition units based around StrongARM and XScale processors running modern engines and emulating classic engines.
* Saitek sells mid-range units of intermediate strength. They bought out Hegener &amp; Glaser and its Mephisto brand in 1994.

Recently, some hobbyists have been using the Multi Emulator Super System to run the chess programs created for Fidelity or Hegener &amp; Glaser&#x27;s Mephisto computers on modern 64-bit operating systems such as Windows 10. The author of Rebel, Ed Schröder has also adapted three of the Hegener &amp; Glaser Mephisto&#x27;s he wrote to work as UCI engines.

=== DOS programs ===
These programs can be run on MS-DOS, and can be run on 64-bit Windows 10 via emulators such as DOSBox or Qemu:
* Chessmaster 2000
* Colossus Chess
* Fritz 1–3
* Kasparov&#x27;s Gambit
* Rebel
* Sargon
* Socrates II

== Notable theorists ==
Well-known computer chess theorists include:

* Georgy Adelson-Velsky, a Soviet and Israeli mathematician and computer scientist
* Hans Berliner, American computer scientist and world correspondence chess champion, design supervisor of HiTech (1988)
* Mikhail Botvinnik, Soviet electrical engineer and world chess champion, wrote &quot;Pioneer&quot;
* Alexander Brudno, Russian computer scientist, first elaborated the alphabeta pruning algorithm
* Feng-hsiung Hsu, the lead developer of Deep Blue (1986–97) 
* Professor Robert Hyatt developed Cray Blitz and Crafty 
* Danny Kopec, American Professor or Computer Science and International Chess Master, developed Kopec-Bratko test
* Alexander Kronrod, Soviet computer scientist and mathematician
* Professor Monroe Newborn, chairman of the computer chess committee for the Association for Computing Machinery
* Claude E. Shannon, American computer scientist and mathematician
* Alan Turing, English computer scientist and mathematician

== Solving chess ==

The prospects of completely solving chess are generally considered to be rather remote. It is widely conjectured that no computationally inexpensive method to solve chess exists even in the weak sense of determining with certainty the value of the initial position, and hence the idea of solving chess in the stronger sense of obtaining a practically usable description of a strategy for perfect play for either side seems unrealistic today. However, it has not been proven that no computationally cheap way of determining the best move in a chess position exists, nor even that a traditional alpha–beta searcher running on present-day computing hardware could not solve the initial position in an acceptable amount of time. The difficulty in proving the latter lies in the fact that, while the number of board positions that could happen in the course of a chess game is huge (on the order of at least 1043 to 1047), it is hard to rule out with mathematical certainty the possibility that the initial position allows either side to force a mate or a threefold repetition after relatively few moves, in which case the search tree might encompass only a very small subset of the set of possible positions. It has been mathematically proven that &quot;generalized chess&quot; (chess played with an arbitrarily large number of pieces on an arbitrarily large chessboard) is EXPTIME-complete, meaning that determining the winning side in an arbitrary position of generalized chess provably takes exponential time in the worst case; however, this theoretical result gives no lower bound on the amount of work required to solve ordinary 8x8 chess.

Martin Gardner&#x27;s Minichess, played on a 5×5 board with approximately 1018 possible board positions, has been solved; its game-theoretic value is 1/2 (i.e. a draw can be forced by either side), and the forcing strategy to achieve that result has been described.

Progress has also been made from the other side: as of 2012, all 7 and fewer pieces (2 kings and up to 5 other pieces) endgames have been solved.

== Chess engines ==

A &quot;chess engine&quot; is software that calculates and orders which moves are the strongest to play in a given position. Engine authors focus on improving the play of their engines, often just importing the engine into a graphical user interface (GUI) developed by someone else. Engines communicate with the GUI by standardized protocols such as the nowadays ubiquitous Universal Chess Interface developed by Stefan Meyer-Kahlen and Franz Huber. There are others, like the Chess Engine Communication Protocol developed by Tim Mann for GNU Chess and Winboard. Chessbase has its own proprietary protocol, and at one time Millennium 2000 had another protocol used for ChessGenius. Engines designed for one operating system and protocol may be ported to other OS&#x27;s or protocols. Chess engines are regularly matched against each other at dedicated chess engine tournaments.

== Chess web apps ==
In 1997, the Internet Chess Club released its first Java client for playing chess online against other people inside one&#x27;s webbrowser. This was probably one of the first chess web apps. Free Internet Chess Server followed soon after with a similar client. In 2004, International Correspondence Chess Federation opened up a web server to replace their email-based system. Chess.com started offering Live Chess in 2007. Chessbase/Playchess has long had a downloadable client, and added a web-based client in 2013.

Another popular web app is tactics training. The now defunct Chess Tactics Server opened its site in 2006, followed by Chesstempo the next year, and Chess.com added its Tactics Trainer in 2008. Chessbase added a tactics trainer web app in 2015.

Chessbase took their chess game database online in 1998. Another early chess game databases was Chess Lab, which started in 1999. New In Chess had initially tried to compete with Chessbase by releasing a NICBase program for Windows 3.x, but eventually, decided to give up on software, and instead focus on their online database starting in 2002.

One could play against the engine Shredder online from 2006. In 2015, Chessbase added a play Fritz web app, as well as My Games for storing one&#x27;s games.

Starting in 2007, Chess.com offered the content of the training program, Chess Mentor, to their customers online. Top GMs such as Sam Shankland and Walter Browne have contributed lessons.

== Impact of AI on chess ==
=== Revolutionizing chess strategy ===
The introduction of artificial intelligence transformed the game of chess, particularly at the elite levels. AI greatly influenced defensive strategies. It has the capacity to compute every potential move without concern, unlike human players who are bound to emotional and psychological impacts from factors such as stress or tiredness. As a result, many positions once considered not defensible are now recognized as defensible. 

After studying millions of games, chess engines made new analysis and improved the existing theories of opening. These improvements led to the creation of new ideas and changed the way players think throughout all parts of the game.In classical chess, elite players commonly initiate games by making 10 to 15 opening moves that align with established analyses or leading engine recommendations.

=== Cheating and fair play ===

Unlike traditional over-the-board tournaments where handheld metal detectors are employed in order to counter players attempts at using electronic assistance, fair-play monitoring in online chess is much more challenging.

During the 2020 European Online Chess Championship, which saw a record participation of nearly 4000 players over 80 participants were disqualified for cheating—most from beginner and youth categories. The event underscored the growing need for advanced detection methods in online competitions.

In response to these issues, chess platforms such as Chess.com developed AI-based statistical models which track improbable moves by a player and compare them to moves that could be made by an engine. Expert examination is conducted for all suspected cases, and the findings are published on a regular basis. FIDE introduced AI behavior-tracking technology to strengthen anti-cheating measures in online events.

==== Challenges in cheat detection ====
AI-based detection systems use a combination of machine learning to track suspicious player actions in different games. This is done by measuring discrepancies between the real moves and the predicted moves derived from the available statistics. Players of unusually high skill level or unusual strategies that can imitate moves characteristic of automated chess systems. Each case is examined by a human expert to ensure that the decision is correct before any actions are made to guarantee fairness and accuracy.

=== Aligning AI with humans ===
The Maia Chess project was began in 2020 by the University of Toronto, Cornell University, and Microsoft Research. Maia Chess is a neural network constructed to impersonate a human’s manner of playing chess based on skill. Each Maia models was tested on 9 sets of 500,000 positions each, covering rating levels from 1100 to 1900. They perform best when predicting moves made by players at their targeted rating level, with lower Maias accurately predicting moves from lower-rated players (around 1100) and higher Maias doing the same for higher-rated players (around 1900). The primary goal of Maia is to develop an AI chess engine that imitates human decision-making rather than focusing on optimal moves. Through personalization across different skill levels, Maia is able to simulate game styles typical for each level more accurately.

=== Chess and LLMs ===
While considered something done more for entertainment than for serious play, people have discovered that large language models (LLMs) of the type created in 2018 and beyond such as GPT-3 can be prompted into producing chess moves given proper language prompts. While inefficient compared to native chess engines, the fact that LLMs can track the board state at all beyond the opening rather than simply recite chess-like phrases in a dreamlike state was considered greatly surprising. LLM play has a number of quirks compared to engine play; for example, engines don&#x27;t generally &quot;care&quot; how a board state was arrived at. However, LLMs seem to produce different quality moves for a chess position reached via strong play compared to the same board state produced via a set of strange preceding moves (which will generally produce weaker and more random moves).

<doc id="68368" wikidata="Q179122" url="?curid=68368" title="Alice B. Toklas">
<text>Alice Babette Toklas (April 30, 1877 – March 7, 1967) was an American-born member of the Parisian avant-garde of the early 20th century, and the life partner of American writer Gertrude Stein.

==Early life==
Alice B. Toklas was born in San Francisco into a middle-class Polish Jewish family. Her paternal grandfather was a rabbi, whose son Feivel (usually known as Ferdinand) Toklas moved to San Francisco in 1863. In 1876, Ferdinand Toklas married Emma (Emelia) Levinsky and they had two children: Alice and her brother Clarence Ferdinand (1887–1924).

In 1890, the Toklas family moved to Seattle, where her father was one half of Toklas, Singerman and Company, the city&#x27;s leading dry goods store.

Toklas was educated in local schools, which included the Mount Rainier Seminary, and attended the University of Washington where she studied piano.

When her mother became ill, the family moved back to San Francisco. Her mother died in 1897, aged 41.

==Relationship with Gertrude Stein==
Five months after the devastating 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Toklas left the city and moved to Paris. On September 8, 1907, the day after she arrived in Paris, she met Gertrude Stein. This marked the beginning of a relationship which lasted for nearly four decades, ending in 1946 with Stein&#x27;s death.

Together they hosted a salon in the home they shared at 27 rue de Fleurus that attracted expatriate American writers, such as Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Paul Bowles, Thornton Wilder, and Sherwood Anderson as well as avant-garde painters, including Picasso, Matisse, and Braque.

Acting as Stein&#x27;s confidante, lover, cook, secretary, muse, editor, critic, and general organizer, Toklas remained a background figure, chiefly living in the shadow of Stein, until the publication by Stein of Toklas&#x27; &quot;memoirs&quot; in 1933 under the teasing title &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot;. It became Stein&#x27;s best-selling book.

Toklas and Stein drove ambulances in WWI after learning from Parisian taxi drivers.

When war broke out in 1939, Stein and Toklas were at their country home, Bilignin, near the Swiss border. Stein and Toklas likely avoided being sent to concentration camps by their obscurity, American citizenship and the goodness of their neighbors that protected them.

W. G. Rogers wrote in his memoir of the couple, published in 1946, that Toklas &quot;was a little stooped, somewhat retiring and self-effacing. She doesn&#x27;t sit in a chair, she hides in it; she doesn&#x27;t look at you, but up at you; she is always standing just half a step outside the circle. She gives the appearance, in short, not of a drudge, but of a poor relation, someone invited to the wedding but not to the wedding feast.&quot; James Merrill wrote that before meeting Toklas &quot;one knew about the tiny stature, the sandals, the mustache, the eyes,&quot; but he had not anticipated &quot;the enchantment of her speaking voice—like a viola at dusk.&quot;

Toklas and Stein remained a couple until Stein&#x27;s death in 1946.

==Later life, after Stein&#x27;s death==
Although Gertrude Stein willed much of her estate to Toklas, including their shared art collection (some of it Picassos) housed in their apartment at 5 rue Christine, the couple&#x27;s relationship had no legal recognition. As many of the paintings appreciated greatly in value, Stein&#x27;s relatives took action to claim them, eventually removing them from Toklas&#x27;s residence and placing them in a bank vault while she was away on vacation. Toklas then relied on contributions from friends as well as her writing to make a living.

In 1954, Toklas published &quot;The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook&quot;, a book that mixes reminiscences and recipes. The most famous recipe, contributed by her friend Brion Gysin, is for &quot;Haschich Fudge&quot;, a mixture of fruit, nuts, spices, and &quot;canibus sativa&quot; or marijuana. The &quot;Haschich Fudge&quot; recipe appeared in the British edition of the book, but it was left out of the first United States edition published by Harpers. It was included in the second American edition and became popular within the 1960s counterculture movement. She and the recipe were referenced in the 1968 film, &quot;I Love You, Alice B. Toklas&quot;, starring Peter Sellers, as well as the 1969 &quot;Bewitched&quot; episode, &quot;Tabitha&#x27;s Weekend&quot;. When Tabitha asked if Endora could have a cookie, Endora asked Phyllis Stephens (Tabitha&#x27;s other grandmother), &quot;They wouldn&#x27;t by chance be from an Alice B. Toklas recipe?&quot; The cookbook has been translated into numerous languages.

A second cookbook followed in 1958, &quot;Aromas and Flavors of Past and Present&quot;. However, Toklas did not approve of it, as it was heavily annotated by Poppy Cannon, an editor at &quot;House Beautiful&quot; magazine. Toklas also wrote articles for several magazines and newspapers, including &quot;The New Republic&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In 1963, Toklas published her autobiography &quot;What Is Remembered&quot;, which ends abruptly with the death of Stein.

Toklas&#x27;s later years were very difficult because of poor health and financial problems. She converted to the Catholic Church in 1957. She died in poverty at the age of 89, and is buried next to Stein in Père Lachaise Cemetery, Paris, France; her name is engraved on the back of Stein&#x27;s headstone.

== Legacy ==

&quot;I Love You, Alice B. Toklas&quot; is a 1968 film starring Peter Sellers that references Toklas&#x27;s cannabis brownies, which play a significant role in the plot. Marianne&#x27;s Ice Cream in Santa Cruz, California, created an ice cream flavor called &quot;Alice B. Toklas&#x27; Fudge Brownie&quot; in honor of the brownies in Sellers&#x27; film.

The Alice B. Toklas LGBTQ Democratic Club is a political organization founded in San Francisco in 1971.

Samuel Steward, who met Toklas and Stein in the 1930s, edited &quot;Dear Sammy: Letters from Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas&quot; (1977), and also wrote two mystery novels featuring Stein and Toklas as characters: &quot;Murder Is Murder Is Murder&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Caravaggio Shawl&quot; (1989).

In the 1980s, Jacquie Phelan, a mountain bike racer and founder of the first all-women&#x27;s mountain biking club, raced under the pseudonym &quot;Alice B. Toe Clips&quot; in reference to Toklas.

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted in 1998 to rename a block of Myrtle Street between Polk Street and Van Ness Avenue in San Francisco as Alice B. Toklas Place, since Toklas was born one block away on O&#x27;Farrell Street.

Toklas has been portrayed on-screen by Wilfrid Brambell in the 1978 Swedish film &quot;The Adventures of Picasso&quot;, by Linda Hunt in the 1987 film &quot;Waiting for the Moon&quot;; by Alice Dvoráková in the 1993 television series &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;; and by Thérèse Bourou-Rubinsztein in the 2011 film &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot;.

In 2020, artist Maira Kalman, along with her son Alex Kalman, created and published a short film adaptation of &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot; called &quot;My Name is Alice B. Toklas.&quot;

<doc id="68370" wikidata="Q293114" url="?curid=68370" title="Sophie Dahl">
<text>Sophie Dahl (née Holloway; born 15 September 1977) is an English author and former fashion model. Her first novel, &quot;The Man with the Dancing Eyes&quot;, was published in 2003 followed by &quot;Playing With the Grown-ups&quot; in 2007. In 2009, she wrote &quot;Miss Dahl&#x27;s Voluptuous Delights&quot;, a cookery book which formed the basis for a six-part BBC Two series named &quot;The Delicious Miss Dahl&quot;. In 2011, she published her second cookery book &quot;From Season to Season&quot;. Her first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Madame Badobedah&quot;, was released in 2019. She is the daughter of Tessa Dahl and Julian Holloway and the granddaughter of author Roald Dahl, actress Patricia Neal, and actor Stanley Holloway.

== Early life and education ==
Dahl was born in London in 1977 to the actor Julian Holloway and the writer Tessa Dahl, who were unmarried. Dahl&#x27;s parents separated shortly after her birth. Through her mother, Dahl has three half-siblings. As a child, Sophie frequently spent time at both her maternal and paternal grandparents&#x27; houses in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, and East Preston, West Sussex, respectively. Dahl has noted that her childhood was &quot;an odd one, but with such magic&quot;. Dahl attended 10 schools and lived in 17 homes in various locations including London, New York, and India.

==Writing career==
In 2003, Dahl published her first book, an illustrated novella and Times bestseller, &quot;The Man with the Dancing Eyes&quot; (Bloomsbury Publishing). From 2005, she was a contributing editor and regular columnist at &quot;Men&#x27;s Vogue&quot;, until its closure in 2008. Her next books were &quot;Playing with the Grown-Ups&quot; (2007) and two cook books, &quot;Miss Dahl&#x27;s Voluptuous Delights&quot; (2009) and &quot;From Season To Season&quot; (2011). She was a contributor to an anthology, &quot;Truth or Dare&quot;, edited by Justine Picardie, which included works by Zoë Heller and William Fiennes. She also provided introductions to the Puffin Classic new edition of &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; by Frances Hodgson Burnett, and the Virago Press re-issue of Stella Gibbons&#x27; 1938 novel &quot;Nightingale Wood&quot; – both released in April 2009 – and Nancy Mitford&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Alfred&quot;, reissued by Penguin in March 2010.

In March and April 2010, a six-part cookery series, &quot;The Delicious Miss Dahl&quot;, which Dahl wrote and presented, was broadcast on BBC 2. She wrote and presented a social history documentary about the Victorian cook Isabella Beeton, which was transmitted on BBC 2 on 29 September 2011.

Dahl was a contributing editor at British magazine &quot;Vogue&quot; for a decade, writing about subjects from cultural identity and the journey of refugees to Britain to the Proustian response to scent, winning a Jasmine Award for her column. She is a contributing editor at Condé Nast Traveller, and has written essays for amongst others, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the American edition of &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot; and &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;.

It was announced in the &quot;Bookseller&quot; in 2019 that Dahl had been signed to a four-book deal with Walker Books. The first of these, &quot;Madame Badobedah&quot;, a children&#x27;s picture book illustrated by Lauren O&#x27;Hara, was published in October 2019 and received a number of nominations and awards including a nomination for a Kate Greenaway Medal. It received a Parents&#x27; Choice Gold Award, and was selected as a 2019 Best Children’s Book by both the Guardian and The Sunday Times. Dahl&#x27;s second book with Walker, &quot;The Worst Sleepover in the World&quot;, illustrated by Luciano Lozano, was published in October 2021.

Her seventh book, and third children&#x27;s book, &quot;Madame Badobedah and The Old Bones&quot;, was published by Walker Books in October 2023.

In 2020, Dahl became a monthly columnist and contributing editor at &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot; magazine.

==Modelling career==
Dahl started modelling at the age of 18 after a chance meeting with Isabella Blow, who was then an editor at &quot;British Vogue&quot;. The following year she made her debut on the catwalk at Lainey Keogh&#x27;s London fashion week show, modelling Autumn/Winter knitwear. She went on to appear in advertising campaigns for Versace, Alexander McQueen, Boucheron, Pringle, Godiva, Banana Republic, Gap and Boodles amongst others. She appeared on the covers of both British and Italian &quot;Vogue&quot;, along with the covers of Elle, &quot;Harpers Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Numero&quot;, and &quot;Tatler&quot;.

During her career as a model, Dahl worked with photographers including Richard Avedon, Peter Lindbergh, Tim Walker, Steven Klein and Steven Meisel. In 2000, Dahl became the face of Yves Saint-Laurent&#x27;s Opium. The ad campaign was art-directed by Tom Ford and shot by Steven Meisel.

== Personal life ==
Dahl&#x27;s paternal grandparents were the actor Stanley Holloway and his wife, Violet ( Lane), a former chorus dancer. Dahl&#x27;s paternal lineage has been associated with the stage since at least 1850; Charles Bernard (1830–1894), a great-uncle to Stanley Holloway, was a Shakespearean actor and theatre manager in London and the English provinces. Bernard&#x27;s son, Oliver Percy Bernard (1881–1939), was an architect and scenic designer, responsible for the sets for Sir Thomas Beecham&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; Cycle at Covent Garden. Through Bernard, Dahl is related to his sons, the poet and translator Oliver Bernard, the photographer Bruce Bernard, and the writer Jeffrey Bernard. Dahl&#x27;s maternal grandparents were the author Roald Dahl and the American actress Patricia Neal.

On 9 January 2010, Dahl married the singer Jamie Cullum. They had their first child, a daughter, in 2011. The couple had a second daughter in 2013. The family lives in Buckinghamshire.

<text>True Lies is a 1994 American action comedy film written and directed by James Cameron, based on the 1991 French comedy film &quot;La Totale!&quot; The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Harry Tasker, a U.S. government agent, who struggles to balance his double life as a spy with his familial duties. Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, Bill Paxton, Art Malik, and Tia Carrere star in supporting roles. &quot;True Lies&quot; was the first Lightstorm Entertainment project to be distributed under Cameron&#x27;s multimillion-dollar production deal with 20th Century Fox, as well as the first major production for the visual effects company Digital Domain, which was co-founded by Cameron. It was also the first film to cost $100 million.

&quot;True Lies&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics, and ultimately grossed $378 million worldwide at the box office, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 1994. For her performance, Curtis won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Saturn Award for Best Actress, while Cameron won the Saturn Award for Best Director. It was also nominated at the Academy Awards and BAFTAs in the Best Visual Effects category, and also for seven Saturn Awards.

==Plot==
To his wife Helen and his daughter Dana, Harry Tasker is a computer hardware salesman often away on business trips, but he is actually a secret agent for Omega Sector, a top-secret U.S. counterterrorism agency. Harry, along with his teammates Albert &quot;Gib&quot; Gibson and Faisil, infiltrates a party in Switzerland hosted by billionaire Jamal Khaled. At the party, Harry meets Juno Skinner, who turns out to not only be Khaled&#x27;s art dealer, but someone paid by &quot;Crimson Jihad&quot;, a terrorist faction led by Salim Abu Aziz. Undercover as a potential buyer, Harry visits her, leading the terrorists to attempt to kill him. Harry fights them off but loses Aziz in a pursuit. As a result, Harry misses the birthday party that Helen and Dana planned for him.

The next day, Harry goes to Helen&#x27;s office to reconcile with her, but instead overhears her secretly arranging to meet someone called Simon. Suspecting Helen is having an affair, Harry uses Omega Sector resources to learn that Simon is a used car salesman, who pretends to be a covert agent to seduce women. In disguise, Harry and other Omega agents arrest Helen and Simon. After terrifying Simon into keeping away from Helen, Harry and Gib interrogate her using a voice masking device in a secret facility. They learn she is suffering a midlife crisis and is desperately seeking adventure. Harry arranges for Helen to participate in a staged spy mission, where she is to seduce a mysterious figure (who is actually Harry) and plant a bug in his hotel room.

However, Aziz&#x27;s men burst in, kidnap the couple and take them to an island in the Florida Keys. On the island, Harry learns Crimson Jihad paid Juno to help the group smuggle four MIRV nuclear warheads by hiding them in antique statues. Aziz demands that the U.S. remove their forces from the Persian Gulf or he will weekly detonate a warhead in a major U.S. city. He will also detonate one warhead on the uninhabited island to demonstrate Crimson Jihad&#x27;s resolve. Before being tortured with Helen, Harry is administered a truth serum and confesses his double life to her. They escape and learn that one warhead is set to explode in 90 minutes while the others are loaded onto vehicles to be taken into the U.S. via the Overseas Highway, thus bypassing U.S. Customs. In the ensuing melee, Harry and Helen kill many of the terrorists, while Aziz gets away with one of the warheads on a helicopter.

Helen is caught by Juno and taken in a limousine following the convoy. Gib and other Omega agents pick up Harry. They use two Marine Harrier jump jets to intercept the convoy by destroying part of the Seven Mile Bridge. Harry rescues Helen from the limo before it falls off the highway, killing Juno. The warhead left on the island detonates without killing anyone.

Harry discovers that Aziz and his men are holding Dana hostage in a Miami skyscraper and are threatening to detonate their last warhead. Harry commandeers one of the jets to rescue her. Faisil gets into the building by posing as a news cameraman. Dana steals the missile control key and flees to the roof, while Faisil kills several of Aziz&#x27;s men. Aziz pursues Dana onto a tower crane, and then Harry arrives. Harry rescues Dana, and after a struggle with Aziz, he has him ensnared on the end of one of the plane&#x27;s missiles, which Harry fires at a terrorist helicopter, killing Aziz and the remnants of Crimson Jihad. Harry, Helen and Dana are safely reunited.

A year later, Harry and Helen are working together as Omega agents. While on a mission at a formal party, they encounter Simon, working as a waiter and pretending to be a spy. Simon runs away in fear after they reveal themselves and threaten to kill him. Harry and Helen dance the tango, while Gib pleads for them to take their work seriously.

==Production==
Arnold Schwarzenegger stated that while filming a scene with a horse, a camera boom hit the horse and &quot;it went crazy, spinning and rearing&quot; near a drop of . Schwarzenegger quickly slid off the horse and a stuntman caught him; he concluded, &quot;[this is] why I will always love stunt people&quot;. Art Malik said he was drawn to the script&#x27;s &quot;pantomime quality” and the chance to work with director James Cameron. Costing $100–120 million to produce, &quot;True Lies&quot; was the first film with a production budget of over $100 million. It was filmed over a seven-month schedule.

Eliza Dushku alleged that while filming &quot;True Lies&quot; at the age of twelve, she was sexually molested by the film&#x27;s stunt coordinator, Joel Kramer. According to Dushku, soon after that, an adult friend of hers confronted Kramer on set, and that same day, Dushku was injured during a stunt and several of her ribs were broken, while Kramer was responsible for her safety. Kramer has denied the accusation of sexual misconduct. Dushku&#x27;s co-stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, and director James Cameron all voiced support and admiration for Dushku&#x27;s bravery.

Of the many locations that were used in the film, the Rosecliff Mansion was used for the ballroom tango scenes in the beginning of the film and the exterior of the Swiss chalet that Harry Tasker infiltrates is Ochre Court. The ballroom dancing scene that closes the film, as well as the scenes in the lobby of the fictional Hotel Marquis in Washington, take place in the Crystal Ballroom of the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. The outdoor structures used by Aziz&#x27;s smuggling ring as a base of operations were a series of custom made Alaska Structures fabric buildings, leased to the production crew during filming.

It was during the production of &quot;True Lies&quot; in 1993 when Cameron would also first meet his future &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Avatar&quot; film series co-producer Jon Landau, who Cameron stated in July 2024 was &quot;the studio &#x27;suit&#x27; assigned to oversee &quot;True Lies&quot;.&quot; In the time following the production of &quot;True Lies&quot;, Landau would leave Fox to join Cameron&#x27;s production company Lightstorm.

Opening in 2,368 theaters in the United States and Canada, it ranked number one at the US box office in its opening weekend, grossing $25,869,770 and beating &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;.

===Critical reception===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 70% based on 57 reviews, and an average score of 6.60/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;If it doesn&#x27;t reach the heights of director James Cameron&#x27;s and star Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s previous collaborations, &quot;True Lies&quot; still packs enough action and humor into its sometimes absurd plot to entertain&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on reviews from 17 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s stuff like that we go to Arnold Schwarzenegger movies for, and &quot;True Lies&quot; has a lot of it: laugh-out-loud moments when the violence is so cartoonish we don&#x27;t take it seriously, and yet are amazed at its inventiveness and audacity.&quot; He wrote that he found the plot &quot;perfunctory&quot;, but praised the film&#x27;s stunts and special effects.

The film received criticism for its portrayal of Middle Easterners and its treatment of female characters. John Simon of the &quot;National Review&quot; criticized the plot line of the hero character (Schwarzenegger) using his agency&#x27;s resources to stalk and frighten his wife as cruel and misogynistic. In a negative review, Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote:

Some Arabs and Muslims perceived the film as conveying strong anti-Arab or anti-Muslim prejudice, with some Arab-American advocacy groups calling for its banning in Arab countries.

In a 2022 retrospective review, Polish writer Jacek Szafranowicz called the film &quot;a masterpiece of cinematic fun&quot;, noting that the collaboration between the director and its main star &quot;deserves a golden medal&quot;. Commenting on the state of blockbuster films, Scott Tobias of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;True Lies&quot; is the strange case of a film that&#x27;s alternately retrograde, forward-looking, and thoroughly of its time. For better or worse, it&#x27;s a marker of how the Hollywood action blockbuster had advanced in 1994, as well as a commentary (intended or not) on the troubled state of American masculinity, marital relationships, and lingering racial attitudes.&quot;

====Awards and nominations====
===Censorship===
On October 1, 1994, &quot;True Lies&quot; was banned from Indonesian movie theaters due to the film spawning controversy that focused on Muslim leaders insulting Islam and portraying themselves as religious extremists. According to the Council of Muslim Scholars, it led people to hate Arab terrorists defending the interests of some Islamic nations, but justified American terrorism. Earlier that year, officials had already banned &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; from the country because it contained too much violence and nudity.

==Home media==
&quot;True Lies&quot; was released on VHS on January 10, 1995 and on LaserDisc a month later on February 8. It was the second LaserDisc release to feature a Dolby Digital AC-3 track, after &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;. On August 20, 1996, the film was released on a THX certified Widescreen Series VHS release, along with &quot;Speed&quot;, &quot;The Abyss&quot; and &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;. It was then released on DVD on May 25, 1999. A high-definition version was released on D-Theater in 2003. In 2018, James Cameron stated that a new transfer for Blu-ray had been completed, but he hasn&#x27;t found time to review it.

Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film for purchase digitally on December 12, 2023, followed by a release on Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray on March 12, 2024. This release, along with the 4K releases of Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;The Abyss&quot;, have received criticism for the quality of their A.I. upscaling.

==Cancelled sequel==
In April 1997, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold met with Cameron and discussed the possibility of an eventual &quot;True Lies&quot; sequel, which would also bring back Curtis in her role. At the time, Cameron was busy working on &quot;Titanic&quot;. Following the release of &quot;Titanic&quot; in late 1997, Cameron was planning to begin work on a &quot;True Lies&quot; sequel early the following year. Schwarzenegger and Arnold were expected to reprise their roles. Cameron conducted a search for a writer to work on &quot;True Lies 2&quot;. In August 1999, Cameron and 20th Century Fox were negotiating to have Jeff Eastin write the script under Cameron&#x27;s supervision. At the time, the film was being planned for a mid-2001 release, with Cameron expected to direct it. By the end of 1999, there was the possibility that filming would begin in the third quarter of 2000. However, development of the script was ongoing as of June 2000. Cameron planned to produce &quot;True Lies 2&quot; with Fox, but was undecided at that time on whether he would also direct it, as he wanted to wait until the script was complete. Eastin worked with Cameron on the project for approximately a year and a half, and Schwarzenegger and Arnold liked Eastin&#x27;s script.

By March 2001, the script had been completed, and Curtis was confirmed to reprise her role alongside Schwarzenegger and Arnold. Following the September 11 attacks, Schwarzenegger said in January 2002, &quot;We&#x27;ll shoot it next year. We have a good script. There does need to be some changes because it deals with some terrorist act of some sort. But it&#x27;s pretty much done.&quot; Later in 2002, Cameron said the film would not be made following the September 11 attacks: &quot;Terrorism is no longer something to take as lightly as we did in the first one. I just can&#x27;t see it happening given the current world climate.&quot;

In June 2003, Schwarzenegger said that after the attacks, &quot;Cameron was worried because there&#x27;s an airplane scene – a terrific airplane scene – that didn&#x27;t have anything to do with the terrorism that we had in 9/11, but it was a great fight scene inside the plane while the plane goes down and this kind of thing. It was a very important moment in the movie, and he felt like he can&#x27;t do that and therefore has to rewrite it ... These things take a long time.&quot; The following month, Curtis said the film would never be made due to the September 11 attacks: &quot;Terrorists aren&#x27;t funny anymore. They never were, but, it was distant enough from our psyche that we could make it funny. It&#x27;ll never be funny again. I just think that that is over, that kind of humor is over.&quot; Eastin cited Schwarzenegger&#x27;s 2003 election as California governor as another reason that &quot;True Lies 2&quot; did not get made. However, Arnold remained optimistic that the film would be made.

In 2005, Arnold said he had met with Cameron, Curtis, Paxton, and Dushku to discuss &quot;True Lies 2&quot;. Arnold said the project would include the return of Schwarzenegger and that filming would begin once his role as California governor was concluded. Cameron said in 2009 that there were no plans to make the film, and Curtis, in 2019, reiterated her previous comments: &quot;I don&#x27;t think we could ever do another &quot;True Lies&quot; after 9/11.&quot; Art Malik concurred, saying during the time of &quot;True Lies&quot;&#x27; filming, &quot;there was an element of fanaticism brewing and anti-West feeling going on. But I don&#x27;t think any of us took any of it as seriously as we had to after 9/11. I think one of the reasons for that is probably the reason &quot;True Lies 2&quot; was never made.”

In the 2005 film &quot;The Kid &amp; I&quot;, Tom Arnold plays a fictional character based on himself. In that film, the character had starred in &quot;True Lies&quot; and is pursued by a fan and teams up with Henry Winkler and Linda Hamilton to make a sequel; Schwarzenegger and Curtis cameo as themselves.

<doc id="68375" wikidata="Q162389" url="?curid=68375" title="Tony Curtis">
<text>Tony Curtis (born Bernard Schwartz; June 3, 1925September 29, 2010) was an American actor with a career that spanned six decades, achieving the height of his popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. He acted in more than 100 films, in roles covering a wide range of genres. In his later years, Curtis made numerous television appearances.

He achieved his first major recognition as a dramatic actor in &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; (1957) with co-star Burt Lancaster. The following year he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; (1958) alongside Sidney Poitier (who was also nominated in the same category). This was followed by the comedies &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; and &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; in 1959. In 1960, Curtis played a supporting role in the epic historical drama &quot;Spartacus&quot;.

His stardom and film career declined considerably after 1960. His most significant dramatic part came in 1968 when he starred in the true-life drama &quot;The Boston Strangler&quot;. Curtis also took on the role of the Ukrainian Cossack Andrei in the historical action romance epic &quot;Taras Bulba&quot; in 1962 and starred in the ITC TV series &quot;The Persuaders!&quot;, with Curtis playing American millionaire Danny Wilde. The series ran for twenty-four episodes.

Curtis married six times and fathered six children. He is the father of actresses Kelly Curtis and Jamie Lee Curtis with his first wife, actress Janet Leigh, and actresses Allegra Curtis and Alexandra Curtis with his second wife Christine Kaufmann. He had two sons with his third wife Leslie Allen, one of whom predeceased him. From 1998 until his death, he was married to horse trainer Jill Vandenberg.

==Early life==
Tony Curtis was born Bernard Schwartz on June 3, 1925, at the Fifth Avenue Hospital corner of East 105th Street in East Harlem, Manhattan, the first of three boys born to Helen (née Klein) and Emanuel Schwartz.

His parents were Jewish emigrants from Hungary: his father was born in Ópályi, near Mátészalka, and his mother was a native of Michalovce, Slovakia; she later said she arrived in the U.S. from Vaľkovo, Slovakia. He spoke only Hungarian until the age of six, delaying his schooling. His father was a tailor and the family lived in the back of the shop. His mother was later diagnosed with schizophrenia. His youngest brother Robert was institutionalized with the same mental illness.

When Curtis was eight, he and his brother Julius were placed in an orphanage for a month because their parents could not afford to feed them. Four years later, Julius was struck and killed by a truck. Curtis joined a neighborhood gang whose main crimes were truancy and minor pilfering. When Curtis was 11, a friendly neighbor saved him from what he felt would have led to a life of delinquency by sending him to a Boy Scout camp, where he was able to work off his energy and settle down. He attended Seward Park High School. At 16, he had his first small acting part in a school stage play.

===Military service===
Curtis enlisted in the United States Navy after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Inspired by Cary Grant&#x27;s role in &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; and Tyrone Power&#x27;s in &quot;Crash Dive&quot; (1943), he joined the Pacific submarine force. Curtis served aboard a submarine tender, the USS &quot;Proteus&quot;&quot;,&quot; until the end of the Second World War. On September 2, 1945, Curtis witnessed the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay from his ship&#x27;s signal bridge about a mile away.

Following his discharge from the Navy, Curtis attended City College of New York on the G.I. Bill. He then studied acting at The New School in Greenwich Village under the influential German stage director Erwin Piscator. His contemporaries included Elaine Stritch, Harry Belafonte, Walter Matthau, Beatrice Arthur, and Rod Steiger. While still at college, Curtis was discovered by Joyce Selznick, the notable talent agent, casting director, and niece of film producer David O. Selznick.

==Career==
In 1948, Curtis arrived in Hollywood at age 23. In his autobiography, Curtis described how by chance he met Jack Warner on the plane to California.

===Universal as Anthony Curtis===
Under contract at Universal Pictures, he changed his name from Bernard Schwartz to Anthony Curtis and met unknown actors Rock Hudson, James Best, Julie Adams and Piper Laurie. The first name was from the novel &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; and &quot;Curtis&quot; was from Kurtz, a surname in his mother&#x27;s family. Although Universal Pictures taught him fencing and riding, Curtis admitted he was initially only interested in girls and money—adding that he was pessimistic regarding his chances of becoming a major star. Curtis&#x27;s biggest fear was having to return home to the Bronx as a failure:

I was a million-to-one shot, the &quot;least&quot; likely to succeed. I wasn&#x27;t low man on the totem pole, I was &quot;under&quot; the totem pole, in a sewer, tied to a sack. 

Curtis&#x27;s uncredited screen debut came in the crime drama &quot;Criss Cross&quot; (1949) playing a rumba dancer, dancing with Yvonne de Carlo. The male star was Burt Lancaster who would make a number of films with Curtis.

In his second film, &quot;City Across the River&quot; (also in 1949), he was credited as &quot;Anthony Curtis&quot; He had four lines in &quot;The Lady Gambles&quot; (1949) and a bigger part in &quot;Johnny Stool Pigeon&quot; (1949). He was also in &quot;Francis&quot; (1950), &quot;Woman in Hiding&quot; (1950), and &quot;I Was a Shoplifter&quot; (1950).

He was additionally in three Westerns, &quot;Sierra&quot; (1950), &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; (1950), and &quot;Kansas Raiders&quot; (1951), in which he was billed as &quot;Tony Curtis&quot;.

===Stardom===
Curtis was receiving numerous fan letters, so Universal gave him the starring role in &quot;The Prince Who Was a Thief&quot; (1951), a swashbuckler set in the Middle East with Piper Laurie. It was a hit at the box office and Curtis was now established.

He followed it up with &quot;Flesh and Fury&quot; (1952), a boxing movie; &quot;No Room for the Groom&quot; (1952), a comedy with Laurie directed by Douglas Sirk; and &quot;Son of Ali Baba&quot; (1952), another film set in the Middle East with Laurie.

Curtis then starred with then-wife Janet Leigh in &quot;Houdini&quot; (1953), in which Curtis played the title role. His next movies were more &quot;B&quot; fare: &quot;All American&quot; (1953), as a football player; &quot;Forbidden&quot; (1953), as a criminal; &quot;Beachhead&quot; (1954), a war film; &quot;Johnny Dark&quot; (1954), as a racing car driver; and &quot;The Black Shield of Falworth&quot; (1954), a medieval swashbuckler with Leigh. They were moderately successful financially, and Curtis was growing in popularity.

Curtis then starred in the musical &quot;So This Is Paris&quot; in (1955), before appearing in &quot;Six Bridges to Cross&quot; (1955), as a bank robber; &quot;The Purple Mask&quot; (1955), as a swashbuckler; and the boxing film &quot;The Square Jungle&quot; (1955).

Curtis graduated to larger projects when he was cast as a co-star of Burt Lancaster and Gina Lollobrigida in Hecht-Lancaster Productions&#x27; &quot;Trapeze&quot; (1956). It was one of the biggest hits of the year. Curtis and Leigh formed their own independent film production company, Curtleigh Productions, in early 1955.

Curtis made a Western, &quot;The Rawhide Years&quot; (1957), was a gambler in &quot;Mister Cory&quot; (1957) and a cop in &quot;The Midnight Story&quot; (1957). Lancaster asked for him again, to play scheming press agent Sidney Falco in &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; (1957), starring and co-produced by Lancaster. The film was a box office disappointment, but Curtis, for the first time in his career, received sensational reviews.

Curtis starred alongside Kirk Douglas and Janet Leigh in &quot;The Vikings&quot; (1958, produced by Douglas&#x27; Bryna Productions), which was a major box office hit. Curtis then co-starred with Frank Sinatra and Natalie Wood in the war movie &quot;Kings Go Forth&quot; (1958), before starring in &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; the following year as a bigoted white escaped convict chained to a black man (played by Sidney Poitier). At the 31st Academy Awards, Curtis was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance—losing to David Niven in &quot;Separate Tables&quot;.

Curtis and Janet Leigh then starred in Blake Edwards&#x27; &quot;The Perfect Furlough&quot; (1958). He subsequently co-starred with Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe in &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; as well as Cary Grant in &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; (1959).

Curtis and Leigh made one more film together &quot;Who Was That Lady?&quot; (1960), a comedy with Dean Martin. He and Debbie Reynolds then starred in &quot;The Rat Race&quot; (1960). He then started in a supporting role in &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960), before making two biopics: &quot;The Great Impostor&quot; (1961), directed by Robert Mulligan, playing Ferdinand Waldo Demara; and &quot;The Outsider&quot; (1961), in which he played war hero Ira Hayes. He returned to epics with &quot;Taras Bulba&quot; (1962), co starring Yul Brynner and Christine Kaufmann, who became Curtis&#x27;s second wife.

===Comedic roles===
On October 6, 1961, Curtis formed a new film production company, Curtis Enterprises, Incorporated. The company would make &quot;40 Pounds of Trouble&quot;, which co-starred Curtis, Suzanne Pleshette and Phil Silvers; it was the first motion picture ever filmed at Disneyland. On August 3, 1962, Curtis formed another new film production company, Reynard Productions, Incorporated.

Curtis was one of many stars who had small roles in &quot;The List of Adrian Messenger&quot; (1963). He supported Gregory Peck in &quot;Captain Newman, M.D.&quot; (1963) and had an uncredited dual role in &quot;Paris When It Sizzles&quot; (1964). He and Kaufmann made their third movie together, the comedy &quot;Wild and Wonderful&quot; (1964). His focus remained on comedies: &quot;Goodbye Charlie&quot; (1964), with Debbie Reynolds; &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot; (1964), with Natalie Wood; &quot;The Great Race&quot; (1965), with Wood and Lemmon for Blake Edwards — the most expensive comedy film up till that time, but popular; &quot;Boeing Boeing&quot; (1965) a sex farce with Jerry Lewis; &quot;Not with My Wife, You Don&#x27;t!&quot; (1966) with George C. Scott; &quot;Drop Dead Darling&quot; (1966), a British comedy with Rosanna Schiaffino; &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Waves&quot; (1967), a satire of beach life from director Alexander Mackendrick, with Claudia Cardinale; and &quot;On My Way to the Crusades, I Met a Girl Who...&quot; (1967), an Italian comedy with Monica Vitti. In the early 1960s, he was a voice-over guest star on &quot;The Flintstones&quot; as &quot;Stoney Curtis&quot;.

===&quot;The Boston Strangler&quot;===
Because of the poor performance of a series of comedies, Curtis fired his agent and took a pay cut to $100,000 to play the title role in &quot;The Boston Strangler&quot; (1968), his first dramatic film in several years. Response from the critics and public was excellent. He returned to comedy for &quot;Monte Carlo or Bust!&quot; (1969), an all-star car race film in the vein of &quot;The Great Race&quot;.

He made some comic adventure tales: &quot;You Can&#x27;t Win &#x27;Em All&quot; (1970) with Charles Bronson and &quot;Suppose They Gave a War and Nobody Came&quot; (1970).

Curtis was signed by British producer Lew Grade for the tv series, &quot;The Persuaders!&quot;, which he co-starred with Roger Moore. (1971).

He was one of the villains in &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1975) and had the title role in the gangster film &quot;Lepke&quot; (1975). Curtis had the lead in a TV series that did not last, &quot;McCoy&quot; (1975–76). He was one of many names in &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot; (1976) and had the title role in an Italian comedy &quot;Casanova &amp; Co.&quot; (1977). Later, Curtis co-starred as a casino owner in the Robert Urich 1978–1981 ABC series &quot;Vega$&quot; and appeared in the 1978 movie &quot;The Users&quot;.

===Later career===

Curtis supported Mae West in &quot;Sextette&quot; (1978) and starred in &quot;The Manitou&quot; (1978), a horror film, and &quot;The Bad News Bears Go to Japan&quot; (1978), a comedy. He had good roles in &quot;It Rained All Night the Day I Left&quot; (1980), &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Scarlett O&#x27;Hara War&quot; (1980) and was one of many stars in &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d&quot; (1980). On ABC, he co-starred from 1978 to 1981 in prime time, as Las Vegas Desert Inn casino owner Philip (Slick) Roth, in 17 episodes of the Aaron Spelling produced series hit series, &quot;Vega$&quot;. After &quot;Vega$&quot;, on television, Curtis continued to make occasional guest appearances (sometimes playing fictional versions of himself) into the mid-2000s. His final TV series was as host of the documentary-retrospective series &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot;
(adapting Kenneth Anger&#x27;s book series) in 1992–1993; each episode would include Curtis recalling some anecdotes from his own career.
In 2002, Curtis was in the national tour of &quot;Some Like it Hot&quot;, a modified revival of the 1972 musical &quot;Sugar&quot;, itself based on the film in which he starred. Curtis played the supporting role of Osgood Fielding.

===Painter===
Throughout his life, Curtis enjoyed painting and, beginning in the early 1980s, painted as a second career. In the last years of his life, he concentrated on painting rather than movies. A surrealist, Curtis claimed Van Gogh, Matisse, Picasso, and Magritte as influences. &quot;I still make movies but I&#x27;m not that interested in them any more. But I paint all the time.&quot; In 2007, his painting &quot;The Red Table&quot; was on display in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. His paintings can also be seen at the Tony Vanderploeg Gallery in Carmel, California.

Curtis spoke of his disappointment at never being awarded an Oscar. In March 2006, Curtis received the Sony Ericsson Empire Lifetime Achievement Award. He also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame inducted in 1960, and received the &quot;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot; from France in 1995.

==Personal life==

Curtis was married six times. His first wife was actress Janet Leigh, whom he married in 1951. The studio he was under contract with, Universal-International, generally stayed out of their stars&#x27; love lives. When he chose to get married, however, studio executives spent three days trying to talk him out of it, telling him he would be &quot;poisoning himself at the box office.&quot; They threatened &quot;banishment&quot; back to the Bronx and the end of his budding career. In response, Curtis and Leigh defied the studio heads and eloped and were married by a local judge in Greenwich, Connecticut. Comedian and close friend Jerry Lewis was present as a witness.

The couple had two children, actresses Kelly and Jamie Lee. 

The couple divorced in 1962. &quot;For a while, we were Hollywood&#x27;s golden couple,&quot; he said. &quot;I was very dedicated and devoted to Janet, and on top of my trade, but in her eyes that goldenness started to wear off. I realized that whatever I was, I wasn&#x27;t enough for Janet. That hurt me a lot and broke my heart.&quot;

The following year Curtis married Christine Kaufmann, the 18-year-old German co-star of his latest film, &quot;Taras Bulba.&quot; He stated that his marriage with Leigh had effectively ended &quot;a year earlier&quot;. Curtis and Kaufmann had two daughters, Alexandra (born July 19, 1964) and Allegra (born July 11, 1966). The couple divorced in 1968. After their divorce, Kaufmann resumed her career, which she had paused during their marriage.

On April 20, 1968, Curtis married Leslie Allen, with whom he had two sons -- Nicholas Bernard Curtis (December 31, 1970 – July 2, 1994) and Benjamin Curtis (born May 2, 1973). The couple divorced in 1982.

Curtis married Andrea Savio in 1984; they divorced in 1992.

The following year, on February 28, 1993, he married Lisa Deutsch. They divorced only a year later in 1994.

His sixth and last wife, Jill Vandenberg, was 45 years his junior. They met in a restaurant in 1993 and married on November 6, 1998. &quot;The age gap doesn&#x27;t bother us. We laugh a lot. My body is functioning and everything is good. She&#x27;s the sexiest woman I&#x27;ve ever known. We don&#x27;t think about time. I don&#x27;t use Viagra either. There are 50 ways to please your lover.&quot;

On April 26, 1970, Curtis was arrested for marijuana possession at Heathrow Airport in London.

According to the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, Curtis, who had a problem with alcoholism and drug abuse, went through the treatment center of the Betty Ford Clinic in the mid-1980s, which was successful for him.

In 1994, his son Nicholas died of a heroin overdose at the age of 23. After his son&#x27;s death, Curtis remarked that it was &quot;a terrible thing when a father loses his son.&quot;

===Philanthropy===
Beginning in 1990, Curtis and his daughter Jamie Lee Curtis took a renewed interest in their family&#x27;s Hungarian Jewish heritage, and helped finance the rebuilding of the Great Synagogue in Budapest, Hungary. The largest synagogue in Europe today, it was originally built in 1859 and suffered damage during World War II. In 1998, he also founded the Emanuel Foundation for Hungarian Culture, and served as honorary chairman. The organization works for the restoration and preservation of synagogues and the 1300 Jewish cemeteries in Hungary and is dedicated to the 600,000 Jewish victims of the Holocaust in Hungary and lands occupied by the Royal Hungarian Army. Curtis also helped promote Hungary&#x27;s national image in commercials.

===Books and appearances===

In 1965, Tony Curtis was animated in an episode of &quot;The Flintstones&quot;; he also voiced his character Stoney Curtis.
In 1994, a mural featuring his likeness, painted by the artist George Sportelli, was unveiled on the Sunset Boulevard overpass of the Hollywood Freeway Highway 101 in Los Angeles. The mural was relocated to Hollywood Boulevard and Bronson Avenue in September 2011. His face is featured among the celebrities on the cover of the &quot;Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album by The Beatles.

Also in 1994, the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation awarded its Lone Sailor Award for his naval service and his subsequent acting career.

In 2004, he was inducted into the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Hall of Fame. A street is named after him in the Sun City Anthem development of his adopted hometown, Henderson, Nevada.

In 2005, Curtis was criticized after he stated that he would refuse to watch &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;. He additionally stated that John Wayne would not have approved of a film about gay cowboys.

In 2008, he was featured in the documentary &quot;The Jill &amp; Tony Curtis Story&quot; about his efforts with his wife to rescue horses from slaughterhouses.
In October 2008, Curtis&#x27;s autobiography &quot;American Prince: A Memoir&quot;, was published. In it, he describes his encounters with other Hollywood legends of the time including Frank Sinatra and James Dean, as well as his hard-knock childhood and path to success. It was followed by the publication of his next book, &quot;The Making of Some Like it Hot: My Memories of Marilyn Monroe and the Classic American Movie&quot; (2009). Curtis shared his memories of the making of the movie, in particular about Marilyn Monroe, whose antics and attitude on the set made everyone miserable.

On May 22, 2009, Curtis apologized to the BBC radio audience after he used three profanities in a six-minute interview with BBC presenter William Crawley. The presenter also apologized to the audience for Curtis&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood realism.&quot; Curtis explained that he thought the interview was being taped, when it was in fact live.

==Health and death==
In 1974, Curtis developed a heavy cocaine addiction while filming &quot;Lepke&quot;, at a time when his stardom had declined considerably and he was being offered few film roles. In 1984, Curtis was rushed to the hospital suffering from advanced cirrhosis as a result of his alcoholism and cocaine addiction. He then entered the Betty Ford Clinic and vowed to overcome his various illnesses. He underwent heart bypass surgery in 1994, after suffering a heart attack.

On July 8, 2010, Curtis, who suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), was hospitalized in Las Vegas after suffering an asthma attack during a book-signing engagement in Henderson, Nevada, where he lived.

Curtis died at his Henderson home on September 29, 2010, of cardiac arrest. A few days beforehand, he had met photographer Andy Gotts for a photo-shoot at his home, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m not in a good way at the moment but can I ask you one thing? Can you make me look like an icon just one more time?&quot; He left behind five children and seven grandchildren. His widow Jill told the press that Curtis had suffered from various lung problems for years as a result of cigarette smoking, although he had quit smoking about 30 years earlier. During the 1960s Curtis served as the president of the American &#x27;I Quit Smoking&#x27; Club. In a release to the Associated Press, his daughter, actress Jamie Lee Curtis, said:

My father leaves behind a legacy of great performances in movies and in his paintings and assemblages. He leaves behind children and their families who loved him and respected him and a wife and in-laws who were devoted to him. He also leaves behind fans all over the world. He will be greatly missed.

His remains were interred at Palm Memorial Park Cemetery in Henderson, Nevada, on October 4, 2010. The service was attended by daughters Kelly Curtis and Jamie Lee Curtis; as well as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rich Little and Vera Goulet. Investor Kirk Kerkorian, actor Kirk Douglas, and singer Phyllis McGuire were among the honorary pallbearers. He was buried with a number of his favorite items, including a Stetson hat, an Armani scarf, driving gloves, a copy of his favorite novel, and his iPhone.

Five months before his death he rewrote his will, naming all his children and intentionally disinheriting them with no explanation, then leaving his entire estate to his wife.
==In popular culture==
In the 2022 Netflix film &quot;Blonde&quot;, Curtis was portrayed by Michael Masini.

<text>Jamie Lee Curtis (born November 22, 1958) is an American actress, producer, and children&#x27;s author. Known for her performances in the horror and slasher genres, she is regarded as a scream queen, in addition to roles in comedies. Curtis has received multiple accolades, including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards, as well as a nomination for a Grammy Award.

The youngest daughter of actors Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, she made her television debut in a 1977 episode of the NBC drama series &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;. Curtis made her film debut and rose to prominence with her portrayal of Laurie Strode in John Carpenter&#x27;s slasher film &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978). A critical and commercial success, the film established Curtis as a scream queen and led to starring roles in the horror films &quot;The Fog&quot;, &quot;Prom Night&quot;, &quot;Terror Train&quot; (all 1980), and &quot;Roadgames&quot; (1981). She would reprise the role in six of the &quot;Halloween&quot; sequels, concluding with &quot;Halloween Ends&quot; in 2022.

Curtis&#x27;s film work spans many genres outside of horror, including the comedies &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983), for which she won the BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress, and &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; (1988), for which she received a nomination for the BAFTA for Best Actress. Her role as a workout instructor in the film &quot;Perfect&quot; (1985) earned her a reputation as a sex symbol. She also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Helen Tasker in James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;True Lies&quot; (1994). Her performance in &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot; (2022) earned her multiple accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Curtis garnered another BAFTA nomination for her supporting role in &quot;The Last Showgirl&quot; (2024). Her other film credits include &quot;My Girl &quot; (1991), &quot;My Girl 2 &quot; (1994), &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; (2003), and &quot;Knives Out&quot; (2019). As of 2023, her films have grossed over $2.5 billion at the box office.

Curtis received another Golden Globe for her portrayal of Hannah Miller on ABC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Anything but Love&quot; (1989–1992), and earned a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress for the television film &quot;Nicholas&#x27; Gift&quot; (1998). She also starred in the Fox series &quot;Scream Queens&quot; (2015–2016), for which she received her seventh Golden Globe nomination. Curtis has written numerous children&#x27;s books, including &quot;Today I Feel Silly, and Other Moods That Make My Day&quot; (1998), which made &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-seller list.

Her mother was of Danish, German, and Scotch-Irish descent. Her father was Jewish, a son of emigrants from Mátészalka, Hungary. She has an older sister, actress Kelly Curtis (born 1956), and four half-siblings from her father&#x27;s later marriages: Alexandra, actress Allegra Curtis (born 1966), Benjamin, and Nicholas (who died of a drug overdose in 1994).

Curtis&#x27;s parents divorced in 1962. She has stated that, after the divorce, her father was &quot;not around&quot; and that he was &quot;not interested in being a father&quot;. After her father&#x27;s death, she learned that she and her siblings had all been cut out of his will. Her mother married stockbroker Robert Brandt, who helped raise her. Curtis attended the elite Harvard-Westlake School and Beverly Hills High School in Los Angeles, and graduated in 1976 from Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, Connecticut. Returning to California in 1976, she studied law at her mother&#x27;s alma mater—University of the Pacific in Stockton, California—but dropped out after one semester to pursue an acting career.

==Career==
===1977–1979: Television debut and &quot;Halloween&quot;===

Curtis made her television debut in a 1977 episode of the drama series &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;. She went on to guest star on several series, including &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, and &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;. She appeared as Nurse Lt. Barbara Duran in the short-lived comedy series &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; (1977–1978), based on the 1959 film that starred her father, Tony Curtis. Curtis was also a game show panelist on several episodes of &quot;Match Game&quot;.

Her film debut occurred in John Carpenter&#x27;s 1978 horror film &quot;Halloween&quot;, in which she played the role of Laurie Strode. The film was a major success and was considered the highest-grossing independent film of its time, earning accolades as a classic horror film. The producer, Debra Hill, specifically cast Curtis because her mother, Janet Leigh, had been known as a horror icon due to her Oscar-nominated performance in &quot;Psycho&quot;. She would also return to the &quot;Halloween&quot; franchise seven times, playing Strode in the sequels &quot;Halloween II&quot; (1981), &quot;Halloween H20: 20 Years Later&quot; (1998), &quot;&quot; (2002), &quot;Halloween&quot; (2018), &quot;Halloween Kills&quot; (2021), and &quot;Halloween Ends&quot; (2022), and having an uncredited voice role in &quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot; (1982).

After the major critical and commercial success of &quot;Halloween&quot;, Curtis was cast in several horror films, garnering her a reputation as a scream queen.

===1980–1982: Scream queen===
Her next film following &quot;Halloween&quot; was &quot;The Fog&quot;, which was also directed by Carpenter and produced by Hill. The film opened in February 1980 to mixed reviews but strong box office, starting Curtis as a horror film starlet. In the years since its release, the film has achieved critical reappraisal and developed a cult following. Her next film, &quot;Prom Night&quot;, was a low-budget Canadian slasher film released in July 1980. The film, for which she earned a Genie Award nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actress, was similar in style to &quot;Halloween&quot;, yet received negative reviews which marked it as a disposable entry in the then-popular slasher genre. That year, Curtis also starred in &quot;Terror Train&quot;, which opened in October and met with negative reviews akin to &quot;Prom Night&quot;. Both films performed moderately well at the box office. Curtis&#x27;s roles in the latter two films served a similar function to that of Strode—the main character whose friends are murdered and is practically the only protagonist to survive. Film critic Roger Ebert, who gave negative reviews to all three of Curtis&#x27;s 1980 films, said that Curtis &quot;is to the current horror film glut what Christopher Lee was to the last one—or Boris Karloff was in the 1930s.&quot;

In 1981, she appeared alongside Stacey Keach in the Australian thriller film &quot;Roadgames&quot;, directed by Carpenter&#x27;s friend Richard Franklin; her importation, which was requested by the film&#x27;s American distributor AVCO Embassy Pictures, was contested by the Sydney branch of Actors Equity. Although the film was a box office bomb in Australia and Franklin later regretted not increasing the size of Curtis&#x27;s role, it has achieved a cult following and was championed by Quentin Tarantino. That same year, Curtis reprised her role of Laurie Strode in &quot;Halloween II.&quot; She starred in the television films &quot;Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story&quot;, playing the eponymous doomed Playmate, and &quot;She&#x27;s in the Army Now&quot;.

===1983–1989: &quot;Trading Places&quot; and established actress===

Her role as a kindhearted prostitute in 1983&#x27;s &quot;Trading Places&quot; helped Curtis shed her horror queen image; the film was a great critical and commercial success and garnered Curtis a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She had previously worked with director John Landis on the documentary &quot;Coming Soon&quot;. The studio originally objected to Curtis&#x27;s casting, as she was primarily associated with horror films: &quot;The casting people all thought [Landis] was crazy, and he single-handedly changed the course of my life by giving me that part&quot;, Curtis later stated. The following year, Curtis appeared in the romantic drama film &quot;Love Letters&quot; and the comedy-drama &quot;Grandview, U.S.A.&quot;.

In 1985, Curtis was cast opposite John Travolta as a workout instructor in the film &quot;Perfect&quot;. While her role earned her a reputation as a sex symbol, the film was a critical and commercial flop. It has since earned a cult following, and in a 1994 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Quentin Tarantino called the movie &quot;greatly underappreciated.&quot; That same year, Curtis starred as Annie Oakley in an episode of &quot;Shelley Duvall&#x27;s Tall Tales &amp; Legends&quot;. In 1986, she starred alongside Bette Davis in the HBO film &quot;As Summers Die&quot;. She then starred in the 1988 comedy film &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot;, which achieved cult status while showcasing her as a comedic actress. For her performance, she was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. That same year, Curtis starred in the film &quot;Dominick and Eugene&quot; alongside Tom Hulce and Ray Liotta.

Her first starring role on television came opposite Richard Lewis in the situation comedy series &quot;Anything but Love&quot;, which ran for four seasons from 1989 through 1992. For her performance as Hannah Miller, she received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy and the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Actress in a New TV Series.

===1990–1999: Continued success and &quot;True Lies&quot;===
Curtis received positive reviews for her performance in the action thriller &quot;Blue Steel&quot; (1990), which was directed by Kathryn Bigelow. The following year, she appeared in &quot;My Girl&quot;, opposite her &quot;Trading Places&quot; co-star Dan Aykroyd. The film was a great commercial success and was followed by a sequel, &quot;My Girl 2&quot;, in 1994. In 1992, Curtis starred alongside Mel Gibson in the romantic fantasy film &quot;Forever Young&quot;. The following year, she appeared in the psychological thriller &quot;Mother&#x27;s Boys&quot;.

Curtis received a Golden Globe Award for her work in the 1994 action-comedy film &quot;True Lies&quot;, directed by James Cameron. The film was a critical and commercial success, becoming the 3rd highest-grossing film of 1994. Her performance also earned Curtis her first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. She earned another Golden Globe Award nomination for her work in TNT&#x27;s adaptation of the Wendy Wasserstein play &quot;The Heidi Chronicles&quot; (1995). In 1996, Curtis starred in the family comedy film &quot;House Arrest&quot; and appeared in an episode of the sitcom &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;.

Curtis appeared in &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot; in 1997, alongside her three &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; costars: John Cleese, Kevin Kline, and Michael Palin. While the film was a modest commercial success, grossing $40 million worldwide against a $25 million budget, 53% of critics gave it positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. That same year, Curtis was inducted into the &quot;Fangoria&quot; Hall of Fame.

In 1998, she starred in the CBS television film &quot;Nicholas&#x27; Gift&quot;, for which she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination, and reprised her role of Laurie Strode for the third time in &quot;Halloween H20: 20 Years Later&quot;. That same year, Curtis received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1999, she starred in the science fiction horror film &quot;Virus&quot;, which was a critical and commercial flop. Curtis has since stated that she regrets starring in the film.

===2000–2006: &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; and retirement===
In 2000, Curtis was honored with the Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year award and appeared in the crime comedy film &quot;Drowning Mona&quot;, starring Danny DeVito and Bette Midler. The following year, she starred as Geoffrey Rush&#x27;s wife in the spy-triller film &quot;The Tailor of Panama&quot; and appeared in Billy Bob Thornton&#x27;s &quot;Daddy and Them&quot;. Also in 2001, she voiced Queen Camilla in the animated Christmas film &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys&quot;. She appeared in &quot;&quot; in 2002.

In 2003, Curtis was cast opposite Lindsay Lohan in the Disney comedy film &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;. The film was shot at Palisades High School in Pacific Palisades, California, near where Curtis and Guest lived with their children. Curtis received praise for her performance; A. O. Scott from &quot;The New York Times&quot; contended that she &quot;does some of her best work ever&quot;, while &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called her performance &quot;glorious&quot;. Her performance earned her another nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. She also received a Grammy Award nomination that same year for Best Spoken Word Album for Children for the audiobook &quot;The Jamie Lee Curtis Audio Collection&quot;.

In 2004, she starred in the Christmas comedy film &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot;, which was critically derided but a box office success. The following year, she appeared as herself along with her &quot;True Lies&quot; co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger in the comedy film &quot;The Kid &amp; I&quot; and hosted the CBS program &quot;A Home for the Holidays&quot;. In October 2006, Curtis told &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; that she had closed the book on her acting career to focus on her family.

===2007–2017: Return to acting and &quot;Scream Queens&quot;===

Curtis returned to acting after being cast in June 2007 in Disney&#x27;s live-action-animated film &quot;Beverly Hills Chihuahua&quot;, starring opposite Piper Perabo as one of three live-action characters in the film. She also starred in the 2010 comedy film &quot;You Again&quot;, opposite Kristen Bell and Sigourney Weaver. Curtis had voice roles in the animated films &quot;The Little Engine That Could&quot; (2011) and the English language version of &quot;From Up on Poppy Hill&quot; (2013).

In 2012, she appeared in five episodes of the military drama series &quot;NCIS&quot;, playing the role of Dr. Samantha Ryan, a potential romantic interest of Special Agent Gibbs (Mark Harmon). During an interview, she stated that if they could develop a storyline, she would be interested to return to the series, but this never occurred. The series reunited Curtis with Harmon, after he played her character&#x27;s fiancé and later husband in the 2003 remake of &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;. This was followed by supporting roles in the neo-noir mystery film &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; (2014) and the biographical drama film &quot;Spare Parts&quot; (2015). In 2016, &quot;IndieWire&quot; named her one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination (Curtis received her first Academy Award nomination in 2023).

From 2012 to 2018, Curtis had a recurring role as Joan Day, the mother of Zooey Deschanel&#x27;s character, in the sitcom &quot;New Girl&quot;. From 2015 to 2016, Curtis had a lead role as Cathy Munsch on the Fox satirical horror comedy series &quot;Scream Queens&quot;, which aired for two seasons. Curtis filmed an intricate homage to her mother&#x27;s classic shower scene in &quot;Psycho&quot; in a season one episode. For her performance in the first season, Curtis was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy and the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Actress in a New TV Series. In 2017, Curtis was mentioned by Eminem in Big Sean&#x27;s song &quot;No Favors&quot;.

===2018–present: Film resurgence and awards success===

Curtis returned to leading roles with her reprisal of Laurie Strode in the horror sequel film &quot;Halloween&quot; (2018). The film debuted to $76.2 million, marking the second-best opening weekend of October and the highest opening weekend of the &quot;Halloween&quot; franchise; and became the biggest domestic grosser in the franchise with its opening weekend alone. Its opening performance was the best-ever for a film starring a lead actress over 55 years old. Also in 2018, she had a role in the drama film &quot;An Acceptable Loss&quot;. Her performance earned some positive critical notice; &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Richard Roeper stated that Curtis &quot;creates a monster so terrifying she&#x27;d have Michael Myers turning tail and running away.&quot;

In 2019, Curtis appeared as Linda Drysdale-Thrombrey, the eldest daughter of novelist Harlan Thrombey (played by Christopher Plummer) in Rian Johnson&#x27;s mystery film &quot;Knives Out&quot;, which earned positive reviews and over $300 million at the global box office. The film was chosen by the American Film Institute, the National Board of Review, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the top ten films of 2019 in each respective list.

In September 2021, she was honored with the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival for her lifetime achievements. Curtis again reprised her role as Laurie Strode in the horror sequels &quot;Halloween Kills&quot;, which was released in October 2021, and in &quot;Halloween Ends&quot;, which was released in October 2022. Her performance in each film earned her People&#x27;s Choice Award nominations for Drama Movie Star. &quot;Halloween Ends&quot; marked Curtis&#x27; final time portraying Laurie Strode. She also was honored with a handprint ceremony at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theater on October 12, 2022. Curtis&#x27;s close friends Melanie Griffith and Arnold Schwarzenegger both honored her with speeches at the ceremony.

She appeared as persnickety Internal Revenue Service (IRS) inspector Deirdre Beaubeirdre in the comedy-drama action film &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot; (2022), which earned her nominations for an Academy Award, BAFTA, Critics&#x27; Choice, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actress, in addition to a nomination for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Performance. It was Curtis&#x27;s first Oscar nomination. She ultimately won the Academy Award and SAG Award, marking her first time winning both, as well as being part of the cast&#x27;s Best Ensemble win at the SAG Awards.

In 2023, Curtis guest starred in the second season of the Hulu comedy-drama series &quot;The Bear&quot; as alcoholic family matriarch Donna Berzatto, having hoped to become involved with the series after watching the first season. She received widespread critical acclaim and won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series at the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards. She starred as Madame Leota in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Haunted Mansion,&quot; which was released on July 28, 2023, to mixed reviews from critics.

It was released on August 9, 2024, to negative reviews from critics and bombed at the box office. She also appeared in Gia Coppola&#x27;s film &quot;The Last Showgirl&quot;, which premiered at TIFF on September 6, 2024, and garnered her a fourth SAG Awards nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role and a fourth BAFTA Awards nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.

==Political views==

During California&#x27;s 2008 general election, Curtis appeared in television advertisements for the Children&#x27;s Hospital Bond Act.

In March 2012, Curtis was featured with Martin Sheen and Brad Pitt in a performance of Dustin Lance Black&#x27;s play &quot;8&quot;—a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California&#x27;s Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage—as Sandy Stier. The production was held at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre and broadcast on YouTube to raise money for the American Foundation for Equal Rights. In June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting; in the video, Curtis and others told the stories of the people killed there.

Curtis endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, and was a vocal critic of President Donald Trump during his term in office. Curtis showed support for Marianne Williamson in the primaries and endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election as well as Adam Schiff for the 2024 Senate race in California. In October 2023, she expressed support for Israel during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war but in the following month called for a ceasefire while showing support for the youth victims trapped among the conflict.

==Philanthropy==
Beginning in 1990, Curtis and her father, Tony, took a renewed interest in their family&#x27;s Hungarian Jewish heritage, and helped finance the rebuilding of the &quot;Great Synagogue&quot; in Budapest, Hungary. The largest synagogue in Europe, it was originally built in 1859 and suffered damage during World War II.

Curtis also helped to refurbish the synagogue in Mátészalka where her grandparents worshipped. She attended the opening of the Tony Curtis Memorial Museum and Cafe, which is also located in Mátészalka.

Curtis was guest of honor at the 11th annual gala and fundraiser in 2003 for Women in Recovery, a Venice, California-based non-profit organization offering a live-in, twelve-step program of rehabilitation for women in need. Past honorees of this organization include Sir Anthony Hopkins and Dame Angela Lansbury. Curtis is also involved in the work of the Children Affected by AIDS Foundation, serving as the annual host for the organization&#x27;s &quot;Dream Halloween&quot; event in Los Angeles, launched every year in October.

Curtis plays a leadership role for Children&#x27;s Hospital Los Angeles and supported the 2011 opening of a new inpatient facility for the organization. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she started the &quot;My Hand in Yours&quot; organization with the message &quot;you are not alone&quot; to raise money for the hospital and for people to be able to offer gifts and objects of comfort to people in times of crisis, with all proceeds from every item in the store being sent to help in the care and treatment of critically ill and injured children.

In October 2023, &quot;The Advocate&quot; honored Curtis with the Advocate of the Year award as a part of the Out100 celebration. Curtis, who is mother to a transgender daughter, then gave a speech condemning anti-LGBTQ+ lawmakers and their supporters, stating: &quot;Freedom is the goal.&quot; In January 2025, she donated $1 million to the Los Angeles wildfires relief efforts.

==Personal life==
Curtis married British-American filmmaker and actor Christopher Guest on December 18, 1984. She saw a picture of him from his film &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; (1984) in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and told her friend Debra Hill, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m going to marry that guy.&quot; She married him five months later. They have two adopted daughters: Annie, born in 1986, and Ruby, born in 1996. Curtis is actor Jake Gyllenhaal&#x27;s godmother. Prior to her marriage to Guest, Curtis dated British rock singer Adam Ant.

On April 8, 1996, her husband Guest inherited the title Baron Haden-Guest when his father died. As the wife of a hereditary peer, Curtis is a baroness styled as The Lady Haden-Guest. Curtis does not use this title, saying, &quot;it has nothing to do with me&quot;.

She is close friends with actress Sigourney Weaver. In a 2015 interview, she said she has never watched Weaver&#x27;s film &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) in its entirety because she was too scared by it.

Curtis is a recovering alcoholic, and was once addicted to painkillers that she began using after a cosmetic surgical procedure. She became sober from opiates in 1999 after reading and relating to Tom Chiarella&#x27;s account of addiction, and has called her own recovery the greatest achievement of her life. She is a fan of the video game &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; and the manga &quot;One Piece&quot;, and has worn disguises that allowed her to attend Comic-Con, EVO, and BlizzCon incognito.

In 2021, Curtis received the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement during the 78th Venice International Film Festival and said, &quot;I feel so alive, like I&#x27;m this 14-year-old person just beginning their life. That&#x27;s how I wake up every day with that sort of joy and purpose. I&#x27;m just beginning my work.&quot;

<text>The Parry Peninsula on the north coast of Canada&#x27;s Northwest Territories is bounded on the west by Franklin Bay, on the north by Amundsen Gulf, and on the east by Darnley Bay. The nearest settlement is Paulatuk. It is also home to the Cape Parry Migratory Bird Sanctuary on the northern extremity of the Parry Peninsula.

==History==
It is named for the Arctic explorer William Edward Parry, as well as the similarly named Cape Parry at its northern tip. A Distant Early Warning Line site is also located on the northern tip of the peninsula, that switched operations in 1989 to the North Warning System.

<text>Paul Rose (16 October 1943 – 14 March 2013) was a Canadian Quebec nationalist, a lecturer at Université du Québec à Montréal, and a convicted murderer and terrorist known for his role in the October Crisis. He was convicted of the kidnapping and murder by strangulation of Quebec Deputy Premier Pierre Laporte in 1970. A Quebec government commission later determined in 1980 that Rose was not present when Laporte was killed, despite a recorded confession. He was the leader of the Chenier cell of the &quot;Front de libération du Québec&quot; (FLQ), an armed group which was fighting what they considered the oppression of French Quebecers.

On 10 October 1970, the cell kidnapped Quebec Deputy Premier Pierre Laporte. Laporte&#x27;s strangled body was found in the trunk of a car on 17 October. Rose was among those convicted of the kidnapping and murder.

==Biography==
Rose was born in the Saint-Henri district of Montreal. At the age of eight, his family moved to Ville-Emard and later on his family moved to Ville Jacques-Cartier, now part of Longueuil, where he spent most of his teenage years.

A member of the &quot;Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale&quot; political party, Rose&#x27;s involvement with radical groups began in 1968 after meeting Jacques Lanctôt, a member of the FLQ, during a rally against Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau at the &quot;Saint-Jean-Baptiste&quot; parade.

==Role in October Crisis==
During what became known as the October Crisis, on 5 October 1970, members of the FLQ&#x27;s Liberation Cell kidnapped the British Trade Commissioner James Cross from his Montreal home as part of a violent attempt to overthrow the elected government and to establish a socialist Quebec state independent of Canada.
On 10 October, Paul Rose as leader of the FLQ&#x27;s Chénier Cell joined with members Jacques Rose (brother), Bernard Lortie, and Francis Simard to kidnap Quebec Vice Premier and cabinet minister, Pierre Laporte. Believing many others would follow in an uprising, their goal was to have Quebec live up to the fate wished for it by the Lower Canada rebellions of 1837–8, namely to become an independent country. However, the kidnapping did not work out as planned and they killed Laporte. Some say that FLQ killed him without hesitation in order to show to the population they were serious. In 1971, Rose was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of Laporte and sentenced to life imprisonment.

In 1980, the Duchaine Report found that Rose was not present when Laporte was killed. He was released on parole in 1982.

Later evidence would prove the contrary. &quot;A coroner&#x27;s inquest soon after the murder determined that Laporte had been strangled by a gold religious medal he wore around his neck. In a conversation wiretapped by police, Rose even admitted to his lawyer that he “finished” Laporte with the gold chain.&quot; However, the police officer who recorded the conversation told &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that Rose may have made the statement to cover up for another cell member. Another version, less &quot;drastic&quot;, says rather that this secretly recorded conversation was between Paul Rose&#x27;s brother, Jacques, and his lawyer, Robert Lemieux. Jacques Rose then told that Pierre Laporte was accidentally strangled during a struggle after he tried to escape while two of the kidnappers were about to release him. As this conversation was recorded without the consent of Rose and Lemieux, it could not be used as evidence.

Rose also remained unrepentant. In an interview he gave to &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, he said:

:I regret nothing: 1970, the abductions, the prison, the suffering, nothing. I did what I had to do. Placed before the same circumstances today, I would do exactly the same thing. I will never deny what I did and what happened. It was not a youthful indiscretion.

==Later life and death==
During the 1990s, he contributed to the monthly &quot;L&#x27;aut&#x27;journal.&quot; He was nominated as the New Democratic Party of Quebec&#x27;s candidate in a 1992 provincial by-election. His nomination was controversial, and resulted in the federal New Democratic Party denouncing its former provincial wing (ties between the two parties had been severed in 1989) and seeking legal options in an attempt to force the provincial party to change its name.

The NDPQ changed its name to the Parti de la démocratie socialiste in 1994, and Rose was elected its leader in 1996. He led the party until 2002 when it joined the Union des forces progressistes. Rose worked for the Confédération des syndicats nationaux labour union. Rose remained a strong supporter of the Quebec sovereignty movement, which he likened to &quot;a liberation nationalism. It&#x27;s a people being denied its existence that is trying to find its place in the sun, in the same way as Palestine and Ireland.&quot;

He died of a stroke on 14 March 2013, at the Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur de Montréal at the age of 69.

Even in death, Rose was the source of controversy. Amir Khadir, one of two deputies of the sovereigntist party &quot;Quebec solidaire&quot;, which had absorbed the UFP in 2006, proposed tabling a motion in the Quebec provincial legislature to honour his death. Khadir later withdrew the proposal, blaming anglophone media for nationalist hate-mongering, and claiming Rose had recanted and been rehabilitated.

His son Félix Rose released the documentary film &quot;The Rose Family (Les Rose)&quot;, about his own efforts to come to terms with being the son of a convicted murderer, in 2020.

<text>A chess puzzle is a puzzle in which knowledge of the pieces and rules of chess is used to logically solve a chess-related problem. The history of chess puzzles reaches back to the Middle Ages and has since evolved.

Usually the goal is to find the single best, ideally aesthetic move or a series of single best moves in a chess position, that was created by a composer or is from a real game. But puzzles can also set different objectives. Examples include deducing the last move played, the location of a missing piece, or whether a player has lost the right to castle. Sometimes the objective is antithetical to normal chess, such as helping (or even compelling) the opponent to checkmate one&#x27;s own king.

==Chess problems==

While a &quot;chess puzzle&quot; is any puzzle involving aspects of chess, a &quot;chess problem&quot; (or &quot;chess composition&quot;) is a crafted position with a specified task to be fulfilled, such as White mates in &quot;n&quot; moves. Chess problems are divided into orthodox and heterodox types, both covering a variety of genres.

&quot;Orthodox problems&quot; employ the standard rules of chess and involve positions that can legally arise from actual gameplay. The most common form of orthodox problem is the directmate, which stipulates checkmate in &quot;n&quot; moves, usually two or three. The positions are often dissimilar to positions from actual play, sometimes to the extent of being outlandish in comparison. The move is usually counter-intuitive. Despite their unusual stipulations, helpmates and selfmates are usually considered orthodox problems, as they use standard chess rules. Likewise, retrograde analysis problems are usually considered orthodox.

&quot;Heterodox problems&quot;, also called fairy chess problems, involve altered rules, such as different boards and pieces not used in standard chess.

==Tactical puzzles==

Chess puzzles can also be regular positions from actual games, usually meant as tactical training positions. They can range from a simple &quot;Mate in one&quot; combination to a complex attack on the enemy king. Solving tactical chess puzzles is a very common chess teaching technique. They are helpful in pattern recognition.

===Example 1===

The solution is 1...Qf2, attacking the f1-rook; 2.Rxf2 would incur a back-rank checkmate after 2...Rd1+. If 2.Rg1, 2...Bc5 sets up a targetting g1, where White can stop checkmate only by moving the c1-bishop to . Since the only two squares available to the bishop are controlled by the black queen, loss of the bishop is unavoidable. White&#x27;s best try is 2.Be3, giving up the bishop immediately and leaving Black an easily .

===Example 2===

The solution is 1.Ne6+!, unblocking White&#x27;s h4-bishop and g1-rook. Black&#x27;s f-pawn must guard the g6-bishop, preventing ...fxe6 in almost all variations; thus, if the black king moves after 1.Ne6+, then 2.Qxf6 leaves Black down a piece and in a . 1...Kh7 and 2...Rhg8 defending the bishop allows for 3...fxe6, but White&#x27;s attack is insurmountable, with prospects of opening the h-file with Bg5 and of Bxe6. White can force mate in less than 13 moves against any alternative to 1...Qxe6, which sacrifices material to blunt White&#x27;s attack.

== Mathematical chess problems ==

Some chess problems, like the eight queens puzzle or the knight&#x27;s tour problem, have connections to mathematics, especially to graph theory and combinatorics. Many famous mathematicians have studied such problems, including Euler, Legendre, and Gauss. Besides finding a solution to a particular puzzle, mathematicians are usually interested in counting the total number of possible solutions, finding solutions with certain properties, and generalization of the problems to &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; or rectangular boards.

<text>Francis Simard, (June 2, 1946 – January 10, 2015) was a Quebec nationalist and convicted murderer. Simard was a member of the Chénier Cell of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ), a group dedicated to the creation of an independent Marxist state out of the Canadian province of Quebec. Members of the group were responsible for the events known as the October Crisis.

As a member of the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale political party, he met Paul Rose and the two became involved in revolutionary activities in 1969 when Simard campaigned for the development of the French language in McGill University, one of Montreal&#x27;s English-language universities. During what became known as the October Crisis, on October 5, 1970, members of the FLQ&#x27;s Liberation Cell kidnapped the British Trade Commissioner James Cross from his Montreal home as part of a violent attempt to overthrow the elected government and to establish a Marxist Quebec state independent of Canada. On October 10, Francis Simard, along with Chenier Cell leader, Paul Rose and his brother, Jacques Rose and Bernard Lortie, kidnapped and then murdered Quebec vice premier and cabinet minister Pierre Laporte. Believing many others would follow in an uprising, their goal was to create an independent state based on the ideals of Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba. In 1982, Simard described the murder of Laporte as &quot;a sincere gesture to show that what we were saying was not just words.&quot;

On May 20, 1971, Simard was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Pierre Laporte. He was given parole in 1982. Simard wrote a book published in 1982 about the October Crisis titled &quot;Pour en finir avec octobre&quot;. In 1994, Quebec film director Pierre Falardeau made a movie from it titled &quot;Octobre&quot;. Simard died of a ruptured aneurysm in Montreal on January 10, 2015.

<doc id="68388" wikidata="Q850159" url="?curid=68388" title="The General (1926 film)">
<text>The General is a 1926 American silent comedy film released by United Artists. It was inspired by the Great Locomotive Chase, a true story of an event that occurred during the American Civil War. The story was adapted from the 1889 memoir &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot; by William Pittenger. The film stars Buster Keaton, who also co-directed it along with Clyde Bruckman.

At the time of its initial release, &quot;The General,&quot; an action comedy film made toward the end of the silent era, was not well received by critics and audiences, resulting in mediocre box office returns (about half a million dollars domestically, and approximately one million worldwide). Because of its huge budget ($750,000 supplied by Metro chief Joseph Schenck) and failure to turn a significant profit, Keaton lost his independence as a film maker and was forced into a restrictive deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

In 1954, the film entered the public domain in the United States because its claimant did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. In 1989, the film was selected by the Library of Congress to be included in the first class of films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==

After arriving in Marietta, Georgia, Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad train engineer Johnnie Gray visits Annabelle Lee, one of the two loves of his life, the other being his locomotive, &quot;The General.&quot; News arrives that the American Civil War has broken out, and Annabelle&#x27;s brother and father rush to enlist in the Confederate Army. To please Annabelle, Johnnie hurries to be first in line to enlist, but is rejected because he is more valuable as an engineer, although he is not told that reason. On leaving, he runs into Annabelle&#x27;s father and brother, who beckon to him to join them in line, but he walks away, leading them to believe that he does not want to enlist. Annabelle decides that she will not speak to Johnnie again until he is in uniform.

A year passes, and Annabelle receives word that her father has been wounded. She travels north on the W&amp;ARR to see him, with &quot;The General&quot; pulling the train. When it makes a stop, the passengers and crew detrain for a quick meal. As previously planned, Union Army spies led by Captain Anderson use the opportunity to steal the train. Anderson&#x27;s objective is to burn all the railroad bridges he passes, thus preventing reinforcement and resupply of the Confederate army. Annabelle, having returned to the train to fetch her belongings, is taken captive by the spies.

Johnnie gives chase, first on foot, then by handcar and boneshaker bicycle, before reaching the station at Kingston. He alerts the army detachment there, which boards another train to give chase, with Johnnie manning the locomotive the &quot;Texas.&quot; However, the flatcars are not hooked up to the engine and the troops are left behind. By the time Johnnie realizes he is alone, it is too late to turn back.

The Union agents try various methods to shake their pursuer, including disconnecting their trailing car and dropping railroad ties on the tracks. As the chase continues northward, the Confederate Army of Tennessee is ordered to retreat and the Northern army advances in its wake. Now behind Union lines, the hijackers see that Johnnie is by himself. Johnnie stops the &quot;Texas&quot; and runs into the forest to hide.

At nightfall, Johnnie climbs through the window of a house to steal food, but hides underneath a table when Union officers enter. He overhears their plan for a surprise attack and learns that the Rock River Bridge is essential for their supply trains. There, Johnny meets Annabelle, and they decide to steal back the train.

As day breaks, Johnnie and Annabelle find themselves near a railway station where Union soldiers and equipment are being organized for the attack. Seeing &quot;The General,&quot; Johnnie devises a plan to warn the South. After sneaking Annabelle onto a boxcar, Johnnie steals his engine back. Two Union trains, including the &quot;Texas,&quot; set out after the pair, while the Union attack is launched. Fending off his pursuers, Johnnie starts a fire behind &quot;The General&quot; in the center of the Rock River Bridge to cut off the Union&#x27;s supply line.

Reaching friendly lines, Johnnie warns the Confederate commander of the impending attack and their forces rush to meet the enemy. Meanwhile, Annabelle is reunited with her convalescing father. The pursuing &quot;Texas&quot; drives onto the burning bridge, which collapses. When Union soldiers try to ford the river, Confederate fire drives them back.

Afterward, Johnnie returns to his locomotive to find the Union officer whom he had knocked out in escaping earlier has now regained consciousness. He takes the officer prisoner and is spotted by the Confederate general. As a reward for his bravery, he is commissioned a lieutenant and given the captured officer&#x27;s sword.

Returning to &quot;The General&quot; with Annabelle, he tries to kiss her, but has to repeatedly return the salutes of troops walking past. Johnnie finally uses his left hand to embrace Annabelle while using his right to salute passing soldiers.

==Production==
In early 1926, Keaton&#x27;s collaborator Clyde Bruckman told him about William Pittenger&#x27;s 1889 memoir &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot; about the 1862 Great Locomotive Chase. Keaton was a huge fan of trains and had read the book. Although it was written from the Union Army perspective, Keaton did not believe that the audience would accept Confederates as villains and changed the story&#x27;s point of view. Keaton looked into shooting the film in the area where the original events took place, and attempted to authorize a lease agreement for the real-life &quot;General&quot;. At that time, the locomotive was on display at Chattanooga Union Station. The Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway, who had entitlement on the engine, denied Keaton&#x27;s request when they realized the film was going to be a comedy.

In April 1926, Keaton&#x27;s location manager, Burt Jackson, found an area in Oregon with old-fashioned railroads which he ascertained to be more authentic in terms of period setting for the film. He also discovered that the Oregon, Pacific and Eastern Railway owned two vintage locomotives operating in lumber service that looked the part and purchased them for the production. He later bought a third locomotive in Oregon to portray the &quot;Texas&quot; for the purpose of using it in the iconic bridge collapse stunt. Producer Joseph Schenck was excited about the film and gave Keaton a budget of $400,000. Keaton spent weeks working on the script and preparing for elaborate pyrotechnical shots. He also grew his hair long for the film. He hired Sennett Bathing Beauties actress Marion Mack for the female lead role.

The cast and crew arrived in Cottage Grove, Oregon, on May 27, 1926, with 18 freight cars full of Civil War-era cannons, rebuilt passenger cars, stagecoaches, houses, wagons and laborers. The crew stayed at the Bartell Hotel in nearby Eugene and brought three 35 mm cameras with them from Los Angeles. On May 31, set construction began with the materials, and regular train service in Cottage Grove ceased until the end of production. One third of the film&#x27;s budget was spent in Cottage Grove, and 1,500 locals were hired.
Filming began on June 8. At first, Keaton completely ignored Mack on set. She said that &quot;Buster just stuck to the job and to his little clique, and that was all&quot; and that the crew &quot;stopped the train when they saw a place to play baseball.&quot; Keaton eventually came to like Mack during production, often playing practical jokes on her. The atmosphere on set was lighthearted, and every Sunday the cast and crew played baseball with local residents, who often said that Keaton could have been a professional player.

According to a United Artists press release at the time, the film had 3,000 people on its payroll and cost $400 an hour to make. Entertainment trade papers reported rumors that the film&#x27;s budget had grown to between $500,000 and $1 million, and that Keaton was out of control, building real bridges and having dams constructed to change the depths of rivers. Producer Schenck was angry at Keaton over the growing costs. There were also numerous on-set accidents that contributed to the growing budget. This included Keaton being knocked unconscious, an assistant director being shot in the face with a blank cartridge, a train wheel running over a brakeman&#x27;s foot, resulting in a $2,900 lawsuit, and the train&#x27;s wood-burning engine causing numerous fires. The fires often spread to forests and farmers&#x27; haystacks, which cost the production $25 per burnt stack.
On July 23, Keaton shot the climactic train wreck scene in the conifer forest near Cottage Grove. The town declared a local holiday so that everyone could watch the spectacle. Between three and four thousand local residents showed up, including 500 extras from the Oregon National Guard. (Elsewhere in the film, the Oregon National Guard members appear dressed as both Union and Confederate soldiers who cross the landscape in the background of the train tracks). Keaton used six cameras for the train wreck scene, which began four hours late and required several lengthy trial runs. The train wreck of the &quot;Texas&quot; shot cost $42,000, the most expensive single shot in silent-film history. The production company left the wreckage in the riverbed. The locomotive became a minor tourist attraction for nearly twenty years, until it was salvaged in 1944–45 for scrap during World War II.

Another fire broke out during the filming of a large fight scene, which not only cost the production $50,000, but also forced Keaton and the crew to return to Los Angeles on August 6 due to excessive smoke. Heavy rains finally cleared the smoke in late August and production resumed. Shooting concluded on September 18. Keaton had shot 200,000 feet of film and began a lengthy editing process for a late December release date.

Keaton performed many dangerous physical stunts on and around the moving train, including jumping from the engine to a tender to a boxcar, and running along the roofs of the railcars. One of the most dangerous stunts involved him pulling a railroad tie out from being lodged into the track, with the train steadily approaching, then sitting on the cow-catcher of the slow-moving train while carrying the tie, then tossing it at another tie to dislodge it from the tracks, had he either failed to pull out the first tie on time, or mistimed the throw to the second tie, the locomotive could have derailed and Keaton could have been injured or killed.

Another dangerous stunt involved him sitting on one of the coupling rods connecting the drivers of the locomotive, had the locomotive suffered a wheelspin, Keaton might have been thrown from the rod and injured or killed. Shot in one take, the scene shows the train starting gently and gradually picking up speed as it enters a shed, while Keaton&#x27;s character Johnnie Gray, distracted and heartbroken, is oblivious. In the cast credits, Keaton&#x27;s name/character is listed last.

==Release and initial reception==
&quot;The General&quot; premiered on December 31, 1926, in two small theaters in Tokyo, Japan. It was scheduled to have its US premiere at the prestigious Capitol Theatre in New York City on January 22, 1927, but was delayed for several weeks due to the enormous hit, &quot;Flesh and the Devil,&quot; then playing at the Capitol. It finally premiered on February 5, with the engine bell from the real &quot;General&quot; train on display in the lobby to promote it. It played at the Capitol for one week, making $50,992, considered average box-office. With a final budget of $750,000, it made $474,264 in the US.

On its initial release, the film largely failed to please the critics. &quot;Variety&quot; reported of a theater in which it played, &quot;After four weeks of record business with &quot;Flesh and the Devil,&quot; [the theater] looks as though it were virtually going to starve to death this week.&quot; It went on to say &quot;The General&quot; was &quot;far from funny&quot; and that it was &quot;a flop.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer, Mordaunt Hall, stated: &quot;The production itself is singularly well mounted, but the fun is not exactly plentiful,&quot; and &quot;This is by no means so good as Mr. Keaton&#x27;s previous efforts.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the picture was &quot;neither straight comedy nor is it altogether thrilling drama&quot;...&quot;drags terribly with a long and tiresome chase of one engine by another.&quot; A review in &quot;Motion Picture Classic&quot; called it &quot;a mild Civil War comedy, not up to Keaton&#x27;s best standards.&quot; A review in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; called it &quot;long and tedious — the least-funny thing Buster Keaton has ever done.&quot; Writer Robert E. Sherwood wrote, &quot;Someone should have told Buster Keaton that it is difficult to derive laughter from the sight of men being killed in battle.&quot; There was a favourable review in the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle.&quot;

==Legacy==

In 1963, Keaton said, &quot;I was more proud of that picture than any I ever made. Because I took an actual happening out of the...history books, and I told the story in detail too.&quot; Following changes in taste and critical reevaluation of Keaton&#x27;s work, later audiences and critics have come to agree with him, and &quot;The General&quot; is now considered a major classic of the silent era. David Robinson wrote, &quot;Every shot has the authenticity and the unassumingly correct composition of a Mathew Brady Civil War photograph.&quot; Raymond Durgnat wrote, &quot;Perhaps &quot;The General&quot; is the most beautiful [film], with its spare, grey photography, its eye for the racy, lunging lines of the great locomotives, with their prow-like cowcatchers, with its beautifully sustained movement.&quot; In 2015, leftist magazine &quot;Jacobin&quot; called the film a &quot;comic masterpiece&quot; but denounced it for &quot;promoting&quot; the Lost Cause of the Confederacy.

In 1954 the film entered the public domain in the United States because its claimant did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.

In 1989, &quot;The General&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; It was the Registry&#x27;s initial year, some of the other films chosen were &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives,&quot; &quot;Casablanca,&quot; &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; &quot;Gone with the Wind,&quot; &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain,&quot; &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,&quot; &quot;Star Wars,&quot; &quot;Sunset Boulevard,&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot;

In the decennial &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll of the greatest films ever made, international critics ranked &quot;The General&quot; #8 in 1972 and #10 in 1982. It ranked #34 in critic&#x27;s poll in 2012 and 75th in the directors poll. In 2002, critic Roger Ebert ranked it sixth in the 2002 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; Greatest Films poll and included it on his The Great Movies list. Dave Whitaker of DavesMovieDatabase, a film aggregator site that combines other lists with box-office, ratings and awards, lists &quot;The General&quot; as the 99th-greatest movie of all time, the 21st-greatest comedy, and the 3rd-greatest silent.

A mural was painted on a building in Cottage Grove, Oregon commemorating the film. David Thomson has speculated it is &quot;the only memorial in the United States to Buster Keaton.&quot;

U.S. film distributor Kino International released the film on Blu-ray Disc in November 2009, the first American release of a silent feature film for the high-definition video medium. The Blu-ray edition replicates the extra features of Kino&#x27;s 2008 &quot;The Ultimate 2-Disc Edition&quot; on DVD, including the choice of three orchestral scores.

The film was recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #18 2007: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – #18.

==Versions==
In 1953, a new version of the film was created by film distributor and collector Raymond Rohauer, re-edited with an introduction and music. That version is still under copyright, because Rohauer filed a copyright registration in 1953 and renewed it in 1983.

In 1987, Carl Davis composed a score for the film, which was later used with a 4K restoration of the film in 2019.

In 2016 or 2017, an original score was commissioned to celebrate the 90th anniversaries of both &quot;The General&quot; and the Hollywood Theatre in Portland, Oregon. The film subsequently toured Oregon.

In 2017, the Dallas Chamber Symphony commissioned an original film score for &quot;The General&quot; from composer Douglas Pipes. The score premiered during a concert screening on October 17, 2017 at Moody Performance Hall with Richard McKay conducting.

<doc id="68392" wikidata="Q1132332" url="?curid=68392" title="Harry Flashman">
<text>Sir Harry Paget Flashman is a fictional character created by Thomas Hughes (1822–1896) in the semi-autobiographical &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; (1857) and later developed by George MacDonald Fraser (1925–2008). Harry Flashman appears in a series of 12 of Fraser&#x27;s books, collectively known as &quot;The Flashman Papers&quot;, with covers illustrated by Arthur Barbosa and Gino D’Achille. Flashman was played by Malcolm McDowell in the Richard Lester 1975 film &quot;Royal Flash&quot;.

In &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; (1857), Flashman is portrayed as a notorious Rugby School bully who persecutes Tom Brown and is finally expelled for drunkenness, at which point he simply disappears. Fraser decided to write the story of Flashman&#x27;s later life, in which the school bully would be identified as an &quot;illustrious Victorian soldier&quot;, experiencing many of the 19th-century wars and adventures of the British Empire and rising to high rank in the British Army, to be acclaimed as a great warrior, while still remaining &quot;a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward—and, oh yes, a toady.&quot; In the papers – which are purported to have been written by Flashman and discovered only after his death – he describes his own dishonourable conduct with complete candour. Fraser&#x27;s Flashman is an antihero who often runs away from danger. Nevertheless, through a combination of luck and cunning, he usually ends each volume acclaimed as a hero.

==Flashman&#x27;s origins==
Fraser gave Flashman a lifespan from 1822 to 1915 and a birth-date of 5 May. He also provided Flashman&#x27;s first and middle names, as Hughes&#x27;s novel had given Flashman only one, using the names to make an ironic allusion to Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey. Paget was one of the heroes of Waterloo, who cuckolded the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s brother Henry Wellesley and later—in one of the period&#x27;s more celebrated scandals—married Lady Anglesey, after Wellesley had divorced her for adultery.

In &quot;Flashman&quot;, Flashman says that his great-grandfather, Jack Flashman, made the family fortune in America, trading in rum, slaves and &quot;piracy too, I shouldn&#x27;t wonder&quot;. Despite their wealth, the Flashmans &quot;were never the thing&quot;; Flashman quotes the diarist Henry Greville&#x27;s comment that &quot;the coarse streak showed through, generation after generation, like dung beneath a rosebush&quot;. Harry Flashman&#x27;s equally fictional father, Henry Buckley Flashman, appears in &quot;Black Ajax&quot; (1997). Buckley, a bold young officer in the British cavalry, is said to have been wounded in action at Talavera in 1809, and then to have gained access to &quot;society&quot; by sponsoring bare-knuckle boxer Tom Molineaux (the first black man to contend for a championship). The character subsequently marries Flashman&#x27;s mother Lady Alicia Paget, a fictional relation of the real Marquess of Anglesey. Buckley, it is related, also served as a Member of Parliament (MP) but was &quot;sent to the knacker&#x27;s yard at Reform&quot;. Beside politics, the older Flashman character has interests including drinking, fox hunting (riding to hounds), and women.

==Character==
Flashman is a large man, tall and close to 13 stone (about 180 pounds or 82 kg). In &quot;Flashman and the Tiger&quot;, he mentions that one of his grandchildren has black hair and eyes, resembling him in his younger years. His dark colouring frequently enabled him to pass (in disguise) for a Pashtun. He claims only three natural talents: horsemanship, facility with foreign languages, and fornication. He becomes an expert cricket-bowler, but only through hard effort (he needed sporting credit at Rugby School, and feared to play rugby football). He can also display a winning personality when he wants to, and is very skilled at flattering those more important than himself without appearing servile.

As he admits in the Papers, Flashman is a coward, who will flee from danger if there is any way to do so, and has on some occasions collapsed in funk. He has one great advantage in concealing this weakness: when he is frightened, his face turns red, rather than white, so that observers think he is excited, enraged, or exuberant—as a hero ought to be.

After his expulsion from Rugby School for drunkenness, the young Flashman looks for an easy life. He has his wealthy father buy him an officer&#x27;s commission in the fashionable 11th Regiment of Light Dragoons. The 11th, commanded by Lord Cardigan, later involved in the Charge of the Light Brigade, has just returned from India and are not likely to be posted abroad soon. Flashman throws himself into the social life that the 11th offered and becomes a leading light of Canterbury society. In 1840 the regiment is converted to Hussars with an elegant blue and crimson uniform, which assists Flashman in attracting female attention for the remainder of his military career.

A duel with another officer over a French courtesan leads to his being temporarily stationed in Paisley, Scotland. There he meets and deflowers Elspeth Morrison, daughter of a wealthy textile manufacturer, whom he has to marry in a &quot;shotgun wedding&quot; under threat of a horsewhipping by her uncle. But marriage to the daughter of a mere businessman forces his transferral from the snobbish 11th Hussars. He is sent to India to make a career in the army of the East India Company. Unfortunately, his language talent and his habit of flattery bring him to the attention of the Governor-General. The Governor does him the (very much unwanted) favour of assigning him as aide to General Elphinstone in Afghanistan. 

Flashman survives the ensuing retreat from Kabul (the worst British military debacle of Victoria&#x27;s reign) by a mixture of sheer luck and unstinting cowardice. He becomes an unwitting hero: the defender of Piper&#x27;s Fort, where he is the only surviving white man, and is found by the relieving troops clutching the flag and surrounded by enemy dead. Of course, Flashman had arrived at the fort by accident, collapsed in terror rather than fighting, been forced to stand and show fight by his subordinate, and is &#x27;rumbled&#x27; for a complete coward. He had been trying to surrender the colours, not defend them. Happily for him, all inconvenient witnesses had been killed.

This incident sets the tone for Flashman&#x27;s life. Over the following 60 years or so, he is involved in many of the major military conflicts of the 19th century—always in spite of his best efforts to evade his duty. He is often selected for especially dangerous jobs because of his heroic reputation. He meets many famous people, and survives some of the worst military disasters of the period (the First Anglo-Afghan War, the Charge of the Light Brigade, the Siege of Cawnpore, the Battle of the Little Bighorn, and the Battle of Isandlwana), always coming out with more heroic laurels. The date of his last adventure seems to have been around 1900, being involved in the Boxer Rebellion alongside US Marines. He dies in 1915.

Despite his admitted cowardice, Flashman is a dab hand at fighting when he has to. Though he dodges danger as much as he can, and runs away when no one is watching, after the Piper&#x27;s Fort incident, he usually controls his fear and often performs bravely. Almost every book contains one or more incidents where Flashman has to fight or perform some other daring action, and he holds up long enough to complete it. For instance, he is ordered to accompany the Light Brigade on its famous charge and rides all the way to the Russian guns. However, most of these acts of &#x27;bravery&#x27; are performed only when he has absolutely no choice and to do anything else would result in his being exposed as a coward and losing his respected status in society, or being shot for desertion. When he can act like a coward with impunity, he invariably does.

Flashman surrenders to fear in front of witnesses only a few times, and is never caught out again. During the siege of Piper&#x27;s Fort, in the first novel, Flashman cowers weeping in his bed at the start of the final assault; the only witness to this dies before relief comes. He breaks down while accompanying Rajah Brooke during a battle with pirates, but the noise drowns out his blubbering, and he recovers enough to command a storming party of sailors (placing himself right in the middle of the party, to avoid stray bullets). After the Charge of the Light Brigade, he flees in panic from the fighting in the battery—but mistakenly charges into an entire Russian regiment, adding to his heroic image.

In spite of his numerous character flaws, Flashman is represented as being a perceptive observer of his times (&quot;I saw further than most in some ways&quot;). In its obituary of George MacDonald Fraser, &quot;The Economist&quot; commented that realistic sharp-sightedness (&quot;if not much else&quot;) was an attribute Flashman shared with his creator.

==Relationships==
Flashman, an insatiable lecher, has sex with many different women over the course of his fictional adventures. His size, good looks, winning manner, and especially his splendid cavalry-style whiskers win over women from low to high, and his dalliances include famous ladies along with numerous prostitutes. In &quot;Flashman and the Great Game&quot;, about halfway through his life, he counted up his sexual conquests while languishing in a dungeon at Gwalior, &quot;not counting return engagements&quot;, reaching a total of 478 up to that date (similar—albeit not equal—to the tally made by Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; in the famous aria of Giovanni&#x27;s henchman, Leporello). Passages in &quot;Royal Flash&quot;, &quot;Flashman and the Mountain of Light&quot;, &quot;Flashman and the Dragon&quot;, &quot;Flashman and the Redskins&quot;, and &quot;Flashman and the Angel of the Lord&quot; suggest that Flashman was well endowed.

He was a vigorous and exciting (if sometimes selfish and rapacious) lover, and some of his partners became quite fond of him—though by his own admission, others tried to kill him afterwards. The most memorable of these was Cleonie, a prostitute Flashman sold into slavery in &quot;Flashman and the Redskins&quot;. He was not above forcing himself on a partner by blackmail (e.g., Phoebe Carpenter in &quot;Flashman and the Dragon&quot;), and at least twice raped women (Narreeman, an Afghan dancing girl in &quot;Flashman&quot;, and an unnamed harem girl in &quot;Flashman&#x27;s Lady&quot;).

Flashman&#x27;s stories are dominated by his numerous amorous encounters. Several of them are with prominent historical personages. These women are sometimes window dressing, sometimes pivotal characters in the unpredictable twists and turns of the books. Historical women Flashman bedded included:

* Lola Montez (Marie Dolores Eliza Rosanna Gilbert James) (&quot;Royal Flash&quot;).
* Jind Kaur, Dowager Maharani of Punjab (&quot;Flashman and the Mountain of Light&quot;).
* Lillie Langtry, actress and mistress of Edward VII (&quot;Flashman and the Tiger&quot;)
* Daisy Brooke, socialite and mistress of Edward VII (&quot;Flashman and the Tiger&quot;)
* Mangla, maid and confidant to Jind Kaur (&quot;Flashman and the Mountain of Light&quot;).
* Masteeat, Queen of the Wollo Gallas (&quot;Flashman on the March&quot;).
* Queen Ranavalona I of Madagascar (&quot;Flashman&#x27;s Lady&quot;).

* Yehonala, Imperial Chinese concubine, later the Empress Dowager Cixi (&quot;Flashman and the Dragon&quot;).
* Lakshmibai, (Possibly) Rani of Jhansi and leader of the Indian Mutiny (&quot;Flashman in the Great Game&quot;).

He also lusted after (but never bedded):

* Fanny Duberly, a famous army wife (&quot;Flash for Freedom!&quot;).
* Angela Burdett-Coutts, who became the richest woman in England in her twenties. She nearly dislocated his thumb repelling a &quot;friendly grope&quot; at a house-party (&quot;Flashman&#x27;s Lady&quot;).
* Florence Nightingale, a famous nurse and social reformer. (&quot;Flashman in the Great Game&quot;).
* Agnes Salm-Salm, the American wife of German Prince Felix Salm-Salm, an associate in his doomed attempts to save Maximilian I of Mexico (&quot;Flashman on the March&quot;).

His fictional amours included:

* Judy Parsons, his father&#x27;s mistress (&quot;Flashman&quot;). After a single bedding to satisfy joint lust, she and Flashman achieve a state of mutual dislike. 
* Josette, mistress of Captain Bernier of the 11th Light Dragoons (&quot;Flashman&quot;).
* Elspeth Rennie Morrison, his wife.
* Fetnab, a dancing girl Flashy bought in Calcutta (&quot;Flashman&quot;) to teach him Hindustani, Hindi culture and purportedly ninety-seven ways of love making. Sold to a major in the artillery when Flashman is posted to Afghanistan. 
* Mrs Betty Parker, wife of an officer of Bengal Light Cavalry (&quot;Flashman&quot;; unconsummated). Cited by Flashman as an example of the &quot;inadequacies of education given to young Englishwomen&quot; in the Victorian era, 
* Baroness Pechmann, a Bavarian noblewoman (&quot;Royal Flash&quot;).
* Irma, Grand Duchess of Strackenz (&quot;Royal Flash&quot;). For involved political reasons Flashman marries her, in the guise of a Danish prince. After an unpromising start the cold and highly-strung Duchess becomes physically infatuated with him. Decades later she pays an official visit to Queen Victoria. Flashman, by now an aging courtier, observes his erstwhile royal spouse from a safe distance. 
* An-yat-heh, an undercover agent of Harry Smith Parkes (&quot;Flashman and the Dragon&quot;).
* Aphrodite, one of Miss Susie&#x27;s &quot;gels&quot; (&quot;Flashman and the Redskins&quot;).

* Caprice, a French intelligence agent (&quot;Flashman and the Tiger&quot;)
* Lady Geraldine (&quot;Flashman and the Dragon&quot;, mentioned)
* Gertrude, niece of Admiral Tegetthoff (&quot;Flashman on the March&quot;).
* Princess &quot;Kralta&quot;, European princess and agent of Otto von Bismarck (&quot;Flashman and the Tiger&quot;)
* Cleonie Grouard (aka Mrs Arthur B. Candy), one of &quot;Miss Susie&#x27;s gels&quot; (&quot;Flashman and the Redskins&quot;). With her he had a son, Frank Grouard.

* Lady Plunkett, wife of a colonial judge (not quite consummated: &quot;Flashman and the Angel of the Lord&quot;).
* Hannah Poppelwell, agent of a Southern slaveholders&#x27; conspiracy (&quot;Flashman and the Angel of the Lord&quot;).
* Sara (Aunt Sara), sister-in-law of Count Pencherjevsky (&quot;Flashman at the Charge&quot;). Shares violent love-making with Flashman in a Russian steam-bath. Believed to be victim of a subsequent serf rising.

* Susie Willinck (aka &quot;Miss Susie&quot;), New Orleans madam and Flashman&#x27;s third wife (&quot;Flash for Freedom!&quot; and &quot;Flashman and the Redskins&quot;).
* Madame Sabba, his &quot;guide&quot; at the Temple of Heaven, actually the lure in a robbery scheme (&quot;Flashman&#x27;s Lady&quot;, unconsummated).
* Mam&#x27;selle Bomfomtalbellilaba, a guest at one of Ranavalona I of Madagascar&#x27;s parties (&quot;Flashman&#x27;s Lady&quot;, unconsummated).
* Hermia, an African-American slave (&quot;Flash for Freedom!&quot;).
* Phoebe Carpenter, the wife of a British clergyman in China (&quot;Flashman and the Dragon&quot;, unconsummated)

As well as bedding more or less any lass available, he married whenever it was politic to do so. During a posting to Scotland, he was forced to marry Elspeth to avoid &quot;pistols for two with her fire-breathing uncle&quot;. He is still married to her decades later when writing the memoirs, though that does not stop him pursuing others. Nor does it prevent marrying them when his safety seems to require it; he marries Duchess Irma in &quot;Royal Flash&quot; and in &quot;Flashman and the Redskins&quot; he marries Susie Willnick as they escape New Orleans, and Sonsee-Array a few months later.

He was also once reminded of a woman that Elspeth claimed he flirted with named Kitty Stevens, though Flashman was unable to remember her.

He had a special penchant for royal ladies, and noted that his favourite amours (apart from his wife) were Lakshmibai, Ci Xi and Lola Montez: &quot;a Queen, an Empress, and the foremost courtesan of her time: I dare say I&#x27;m just a snob.&quot; He also noted that, while civilized women were more than ordinarily partial to him, his most ardent admirers were among the savage of the species: &quot;Elspeth, of course, is Scottish.&quot; And for all his raking, it was always Elspeth to whom he returned and who remained ultimately top of the list.

His lechery was so strong that it broke out even in the midst of rather hectic circumstances. While accompanying Thomas Henry Kavanagh on his daring escape from Lucknow, he paused for a quick rattle with a local prostitute, and during the battle of Patusan, he found himself galloping one of Sharif Sahib&#x27;s concubines without even realizing it but nonetheless continued to the climax of the battle and the tryst.

Flashman&#x27;s relations with the highest-ranking woman of his era, Queen Victoria, are warm but platonic. He first meets her in 1842 when he receives a medal for his gallantry in Afghanistan and reflects on what a honeymoon she and Prince Albert must have enjoyed. Subsequently, he and his wife received invitations to Balmoral Castle, to the delight of the snobbish Elspeth. For his services during the Indian Mutiny, Victoria not only approved awarding Flashy the Victoria Cross, but loaded the KCB on top of it.

In 1975, Malcolm McDowell played Harry Flashman in &quot;Royal Flash&quot;, directed by Richard Lester.

==References in other works==
* In the Jackson Speed Memoirs, Robert Peecher borrows heavily from George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s Flashman in creating the Jackson Speed character. Like Flashman, Speed is a womanizer and a coward who is undeservedly marked as a hero by those around him. Peecher also adopts the literary device used by Fraser of the &quot;discovered&quot; memoirs. Unlike the English Flashman, Speed is an American making appearances in the Mexican–American War, the U.S. Civil War, and other American conflicts of the 19th century.
* Writer Keith Laidler gave the Flashman story a new twist in &quot;The Carton Chronicles&quot; by revealing that Flashman is the natural son of Sydney Carton, hero of the Charles Dickens classic &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. Laidler has Sydney Carton changing his mind at the foot of the guillotine, escaping death and making wayward and amorous progress through the terrors of the French Revolution, during which time he spies for both the British and French, causes Danton&#x27;s death, shoots Robespierre, and reminisces on a liaison among the hayricks at the &quot;Leicestershire pile&quot; of a married noblewoman, who subsequently gave birth to a boy—Flashman—on 5 May 1822.
* Sandy Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; character Commissar Ciaphas Cain is partially inspired by Flashman.
* In comics, writer John Ostrander took Flashman as his model for his portrayal of the cowardly villain Captain Boomerang in the Suicide Squad series. In the letters page to the last issue in the series (#66), Ostrander acknowledges this influence directly. Flashman&#x27;s success with the ladies is noticeably lacking in the Captain Boomerang character.
* In Kim Newman&#x27;s alternative history novel &quot;The Bloody Red Baron&quot; (part of the &quot;Anno Dracula&quot; series), Flashman is cited as an example of a dishonourable officer in a character&#x27;s internal monologue. In the later novella &quot;Aquarius&quot; (set in 1968, one year before the first volume of the Flashman Papers was published), it is mentioned that the fictional St Bartolph&#x27;s College at the University of London had previously been home to the Harry Paget Flashman Refectory, until its recent renaming to Che Guevara Hall in an attempt to pacify campus activists.
* Flashman&#x27;s portrait (unnamed, but with unmistakable background and characteristics) hangs in the home of the protagonist of &quot;The Peshawar Lancers&quot;, an alternative history novel by S. M. Stirling: the family claims to have had an ancestor who held Piper&#x27;s Fort, as Flashman did; the protagonist claims his sole talents are for horsemanship and languages and has an Afghan in his service named &quot;Ibrahim Khan&quot; (cf. Ilderim Khan, Flashman&#x27;s Afghan blood brother and servant); late in the book, he plays with Elias the Jew on a &quot;black jade chess set&quot; matching the description of the one Flashman stole from the Summer Palace in &quot;Flashman and the Dragon&quot;; the book&#x27;s chief antagonist is named Ignatieff, a reference to Flashman&#x27;s Russian nemesis Nikolai Ignatieff. Another allusion to Flashman by Stirling occurs in his short story &quot;The Charge of Lee&#x27;s Brigade&quot;, which appeared in the alternative history anthology &quot;Alternate Generals&quot; (1998, ed. by Harry Turtledove). Here, Sir Robert E. Lee is a British general in the Crimean War who orders an officer, obviously Flashman (cherrypicker trousers, rides like a Comanche in battle), to take part in a better-planned Charge of the Light Brigade. Flashman dies in the attack, demonstrating some courage despite what Lee perceives only as nervousness. So, in this version Flashman again ends up a hero. But—as he himself would have been quick to point out—he is a &quot;dead&quot; hero.
* Terry Pratchett was a fan of the Flashman series and the Discworld character Rincewind is an inveterate coward with a talent for languages who is always running away from danger, but nevertheless through circumstance emerges with the appearance of an unlikely hero, for which reason he is then selected for further dangerous enterprises. In this he strongly resembles Flashman, although he is totally dissimilar in most other aspects. The word &quot;Rince&quot; means an object that moves quickly so &quot;Rincewind&quot; may be a play on the name the Apache gave to Flashman which was shortened to &quot;Windbreaker&quot; from the full &quot;White-Rider-Goes-So-Fast-He-Destroys-the-Wind-with-His-Speed&quot;. The Discworld novel &quot;Pyramids&quot; has a character named Fliemoe, the bully at the Ankh-Morpork Assassins&#x27; Guild school, who is a parody of the original version of Flashman from &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; (including &quot;toasting&quot; new boys). In the &quot;Assassins&#x27; Guild Yearbook and Diary&quot;, Fliemoe is described as having grown up to be &quot;an unbelievable liar and an unsuccessful bully&quot;. His name is a play on that of Flashman&#x27;s crony Speedicut—both &quot;Speedicut&quot; and &quot;Flymo&quot; are brand names of lawn mowers.
* An editorial piece in the 14 May 2011 edition of &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper on the subject of British Prime Minister David Cameron being labelled a &quot;Flashman&quot; was given a Harry Flashman by-line and was written in the style of Flashman&#x27;s narrative.
* Flashman&#x27;s son, Harry II, is used as a character in some of the short stories created for the &quot;Tales of the Shadowmen&quot; series. He first appeared in the eighth volume. His son has several of the characteristics of his father, but appears to be less a coward.
* Flashman appears as a minor character in the novel &quot;Dickens of the Mounted&quot; by Eric Nicol. This novel is a fictionalized account of Francis Dickens and, like the Flashman books, is written in the form of a discovered memoir. 
* Flashman is a character in &quot;Snooks North and South&quot; and &quot;Snooks The Presidents&#x27; Man&quot; by Peter Brian. The protagonist of these books is Snooks, who is another character from &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;. In Brian&#x27;s books, Snooks participates in the American Civil War under disreputable circumstances and conceals his identity by using Harry Flashman&#x27;s name. So the events that would be attributed to Flashman actually occurred to Snooks.
* There is a card for Flashman in &quot;Pax Pamir&quot;, a board game about the Great Game. In the first Flashman novel, he is in Afghanistan for the First Anglo-Afghan War and participates in the British retreat from Kabul.
* Comic artist Mike Dorey created the character ‘Cadman the Fighting Coward’ for The Victor (comics) who was based on Flashman. Gerald Cadman, originally of Prince Rupert’s Horse “The Fighting 43rd”, was a cowardly and dishonest officer during the first world war. Like Flashman his cowardice did not stop him from winning many medals, including the Victoria Cross, the DSO, MC and various foreign decorations, none of which he deserved.

<text>The United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) was a written report created by a board of experts assembled to produce an impartial assessment of the effects of the Anglo-American strategic bombing of Nazi Germany during the European theatre of World War II. After publishing the report in 1945, the Survey members then turned their attention to the war efforts against Imperial Japan during the Pacific War, including a separate section on the recent use of the atomic bomb in attacks on two Japanese cities.

In total, the reports contained 208 volumes for Europe and another 108 for the Pacific, comprising thousands of pages. The reports&#x27; conclusions were generally favorable about the contributions of Allied strategic bombing towards victory.

The survey said of Allied airpower that it &quot;was decisive in the war in Western Europe. Hindsight inevitably suggests that it might have been employed differently or better in some respects. Nevertheless, it was decisive. In the air, its victory was complete. At sea, its contribution, combined with naval power, brought an end to the enemy&#x27;s greatest naval threat-the U-boat; on land, it helped turn the tide overwhelmingly in favor of Allied ground forces&quot;

A majority of the Survey&#x27;s members were civilians in positions of influence on the various committees of the survey. Only one position of some influence was given to a prominent military officer, USAAF General Orvil A. Anderson (who had been in the Air War Plans Division) and that only in an advisory capacity. Anderson was the only one on the survey board who knew about procedures of strategic bombing as Jimmy Doolittle&#x27;s former deputy commander of operations. While the Board was not associated with any branch of the military, it was established by General Hap Arnold (chief of the USAF) along with Carl Spaatz (commander of Strategic Air Forces in Europe). Failing to obtain the prominent public figure he had hoped for, Arnold settled for Franklin D&#x27;Olier.

==Background==
The strategic bombing effort against Germany had begun at the start of the war with British attacks on German naval facilities. After heavy losses in daylight raids, RAF Bomber Command moved to night attacks for protection from German fighter defences. The Butt report identified that attacks on specific targets were inaccurate due to navigational and target identification issues. Bomber Command reorganised its efforts and targeted German industrial locations in general rather than aiming for any specific factory or industry under the Area Bombing directive. At the same time it invested in navigational aids and target marking. The total bomber force increased until the RAF was able to send 500 to 800 bombers against a single target city while still able to carry out minor raids and diversions against other areas. While in 1941 the RAF dropped about 46,000 tons of bombs, in 1944 it dropped 676,000 tons.

The USAAF entered the strategic bombing campaign with the intention of targeting specific industrial locations and to achieve precision bombing the attacks needed to be made by daylight. Formations of bombers flew in a mutually self-defensive &quot;combat box&quot; where their many machine guns would be sufficient to drive off or bring down enemy fighters. In practice due to many factors including the weather bombing accuracy fell short - around 20% of bombs fell within the required 1000 ft of the aiming point.

The 1943 Casablanca conference led to the Allied strategic bombing organisation: the USAAF would be working together with the RAF in the Combined Bomber offensive concentrating on particular areas of German industry but in such a way as their commanders interpreted their instructions. In 1942 and early 1943 the US 8th Air Force based in UK had limited itself to raids close to base as it built up its strength, and developed tactics. A second strategic force, the 15th Air Force was created in the Mediterranean. Two further air forces, the Ninth Air Force in Western Europe and Twelfth Air Force in Mediterranean were focused on tactical operations in support of land forces.

The Allied strategy was to win the war by a land war in Europe rather than delivering a knock out blow by airpower alone, and the bombing strategy was in support of that. Over the course of the war, the focus of the Combined Bomber Offensive changed. As Germany was reliant on imported fuel and the synthetic generation of fuel from coal, attacks on such facilities were ordered. While some attacks were successful, the aircraft and crew losses were far beyond what could be sustained and further attacks were limited to within range of supporting fighters In late 1943, the Pointblank directive specified the importance of reducing the ability of the Luftwaffe to influence the outcome of the cross-Channel invasion of France planned for mid-1944 by attacking the production of German fighter aircraft. Changes in tactics and availability of longer ranged fighters meant that the active Luftwaffe force was significantly diminished in early 1944 and the majority of the bombing offensive was directed instead against transport routes to prevent reinforcement of the defences there.

==Europe==
The Survey team was formed on 3 November 1944 by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson in response to a directive by President Roosevelt. The headquarters was in Teddington, England, while its teams assessed the damage that had been done targets as the allied armies took control of them. German records were analysed for information and Germans interrogated including the remaining senior officials in the Nazi regime. The survey was not able to assess the effects in Soviet controlled areas.

The sociologist Charles Fritz was part of the survey team before going on to become a significant theorist in disaster research. The Survey was tasked with producing an impartial report on the effects of the bombing against Nazi Germany, in order to:

:*aid the upcoming campaign against the Japanese home islands,
:*establish a basis for evaluating the importance and potentialities of air power as an instrument of military strategy,
:*provide data for planning the future development of the United States armed forces, and
:*determine future economic policies with respect to the national defense.

The report, along with some 200 supporting documents, was dated 30 September 1945. However it was not publicly released until 30 October 1945. The major conclusion of the report was that strategic bombing, particularly the destruction of the oil industry and truck manufacturing, had greatly contributed to the success of the Allies in World War II. However, despite the overall contribution of the bombing, the survey concluded that the impact of strategic bombing could not be separated from the general collapse of Germany in 1945.

The survey notes the effects on the German population: 3,600,000 &quot;dwelling units&quot;, approximately 20% of total housing stock were &quot;destroyed or heavily damaged&quot; with an estimated 300,000 civilians killed and a further 780,000 wounded. About seven and half million were left homeless. The survey found that German morale deteriorated after attacks night bombing having a greater effect but although dissatisfaction with the war increased, under the German police state the will or means to oppose the leadership was absent.

In attacks on urban areas incendiary bombs, were ton for ton, four to five times as destructive as high explosive. German fire defences were inadequate and in cases of fire storms ineffective. While cities were provided with very strong bunkers—resistant to direct hits—as air raid shelters there was insufficient capacity (enough for 8 million) and casualties outside the shelters among those sheltering in basements and cellars was high.

===Successes===
The Survey noted several successes against crucial industrial areas:
* &quot;The Attack on Oil&quot;. This section of the USSBS presents the statistics for the Oil Plan portion of the bombing campaign against petroleum, oil, and lubrication (POL) products, particularly regarding the Leuna complex (largest of the plants) that produced a notable portion of the synthetic oil which as a result of bombing averaged an output of 9% of capacity from mid 1944 The survey reported the Nazi Germany position that the attacks were &quot;catastrophic&quot; with Speer writing on 30 June that aviation fuel was reduced by 90%. An attempt at rebuilding and dispersing production employing a workforce of 350,000 men was made but incomplete by the end of the war From May 1944 production was less than consumption and reserves were drained. The Ardennes offensive of December 1944 was predicated on capturing Allied fuel to sustain it. The synthetic oil plants were also a source of nitrogen for German agriculture and this was heavily cut back (at first to 50%, then 25%, then altogether) in order to release nitrates for explosive production.
* Ammunition: Production fell markedly in 1944 and the arms industry shipped bombs and shells packed partly with rock salt, as Germany ran out of nitrate, a vital ingredient and methanol (another product of fuel synthesis). Finally, Albert Speer, head of the Nazi economy, shifted the last nitrogen from the war effort to agriculture because he believed the war was lost and next year&#x27;s crops were more important.
* Truck manufacturing facilities were extensively bombed. Of the top three producers, Opel at Brandenburg, was completely shut down in one raid in August 1944, and never recovered. Daimler-Benz was decimated a month later. The third largest producer, Ford&#x27;s German subsidiary at Cologne was never directly attacked, but production was sharply cut during the same period by elimination of its component supplies and the bombing of its power sources. By December 1944, production of trucks was reduced to 35 percent of the average for the first half of the year. After the war, General Motors, owner of Opel, successfully sued the US government for $32 million in damages sustained to its German plants (Ford Motor Company also demanded compensation from the U.S. government for &quot;losses&quot; due to bomb damage to its German subsidiary).
*U-boat (submarine) manufacturing was halted in early 1945.
*Disruption of transportation: German transport was dependent on the Reichsbahn railways and on waterways. Bombing from September disrupted movement of material and products. In February 1945 the Ruhr was completely isolated from supplies of coal.

===Failures===
The Survey also noted a number of failed or outcomes of limited success:

* Aviation production: &quot;In 1944 the German air force is reported to have accepted a total of 39,807 aircraft of all types -- compared with 8,295 in 1939, or 15,596 in 1942 before the plants suffered any attack.&quot; According to the report, almost none of the aircraft produced in 1944 were used in combat and some may have been imaginary.
* Armoured fighting vehicle production &quot;reached its wartime peak in December 1944, when 1,854 tanks and armoured vehicles were produced. This industry continued to have relatively high production through February 1945.&quot; but the effect [of bombing] again may have been to cause the industry to fall short of achievable production&quot;
* Ball bearings: &quot;There is no evidence that the attacks on the ball-bearing industry had any measurable effect on essential war production.&quot;
* &quot;Secondary Campaigns&quot; (Operation Chastise against German dams and Operation Crossbow against V-weapons sites): &quot;The bombing of the launching sites being prepared for the V weapons delayed the use of V-1 appreciably. The attacks on the V-weapon experimental station at Peenemunde, however, were not effective; V-1 was already in production near Kassel and V-2 production had been moved to an underground plant. The breaking of the Mohne and the Eder dams, though the cost was small, also had limited effect.&quot;
* Steel: Bombing greatly reduced production within Germany in 1944 chiefly through damage to utilities the blast furnaces and mills depended on. The survey considered the loss was not decisive (and was overshadowed by general collapse of German economy)
* Consumer goods: The survey summary stated &quot;In the early years of the war—the soft war period for Germany—civilian consumption remained high. Germans continued to try for both guns and butter. The German people entered the period of the air war well stocked with clothing and other consumer goods. &quot;Although most consumer goods became increasingly difficult to obtain, Survey studies show that fairly adequate supplies of clothing were available for those who had been bombed out until the last stages of disorganization. Food, though strictly rationed, was in nutritionally adequate supply throughout the war. The Germans&#x27; diet had about the same calories as the British.&quot; Raids on Berlin destroyed half of German clothing industry.
The German power network had not been attacked as the Allied assessment was that it was well organised and resistant to bombing, The survey found that power production and distribution was known by the Germans to be vulnerable and the survey opined that if it had been attacked it would have had a severe effect on materiel.

===On German production===
The Survey concluded that one reason German production rose in so many areas was in part that the German economy did not go on a complete war footing until late 1942 and 1943. German strategy had been focussed on short decisive campaigns with no thought to a sustained war and consequent production. Up until then, factories had been on a single shift in many industries and the German economy was generally inefficient and not operating at full capacity. They also noted that women&#x27;s participation in the manufacturing field remained low, lower than during World War I. The sections of the Survey regarding the German production system remain one of the best resources on the topic.

German aircraft production increased as spare capacity in the industry was used, and dispersal of production increased resilience. The effective combat strength of the Luftwaffe did not increase despite the large numbers of aircraft available. In each of the three months at the start of 1944, over 1,000 fighters were claimed to have been shot down with a consequent loss of pilots. The survey did not identify what happened to the aircraft produced, the German &quot;air generals&quot; unable to explain it and it was supposed some were lost in transit or damaged on the ground with others unable to fly due to lack of fuel.By start of 1945 fighter production was curtailed due to lack of fuel for all except the new jet fighters.

== Conclusions ==
In respect of the bombing campaign over Europe, the survey identified several points:

* The ability of the Allies to attack unhindered from the air meant by the last year of the war, Germany was finished.
* Domination of the air was necessary to allow effective strategic bombing of the German economy
* Despite the attacks, Germany was able to reorganise and take measures to mitigate some effects of the attacks
* Under state control, despite the attacks on them, the German people were resilient to the bombing campaign and that &quot;power of a police state over its people cannot be underestimated.&quot;
* Germany was more concerned about attack on infrastructure that supported several industries than attacks on any particular industry
* Persistence of attack, it was not sufficient to attack a target once but to return to it again.
* American intelligence on the German economy at start of war was inadequate and there was no coordination between military and other government organisations.
* Importance of Allied research, technological and production improvements to achieve &quot;superiority in both numbers and quality of crews, aircraft, and equipment&quot;
* &quot;The achievements of Allied airpower were attained only with difficulty and great cost in men, material and effort. Its success depended on the courage, fortitude, and gallant action of the officers and men of the aircrews and commands. It depended also on a superiority in leadership, ability, and basic strength&quot;

But it warned that the &quot;No greater or more dangerous mistake could be made than to assume that the same policies and practices that won the War in Europe will be sufficient to win the next one-if there be another. The results achieved in Europe will not give the answer to future problems; they should be treated rather as signposts pointing the direction in which such answers may be found&quot;.

And concluded that &quot;The great lesson to be learned in the battered towns of England and the ruined cities of Germany is that the best way to win a war is to prevent it from occurring.&quot;

==Pacific==
After the European report was completed, as order by Truman in August 1945, the Survey turned its attention to the Pacific campaign. The report opens with a discussion of the Japanese strategic plans, which were based on an initial victory against the U.S. Navy which would upset any U.S. plans in the Pacific for an estimated 18 months to 2 years. During this time, they planned to &quot;speedily extract bauxite, oil, rubber and metals from Malaya, Burma, the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, and ship these materials to Japan for processing&quot;. They also noted the belief that high casualties would not be accepted by the U.S. democracy, and that if the initial campaigns were successful, a negotiated peace was possible.

The survey identified that there was no civilian control of the military nor coordination between army and navy. The Japanese Army and Japanese Navy pursued their own foreign policy, independent of the government, according to their own requirements and capacities.

===Against shipping===
The Survey received sufficient information to detail every ship used by the Japanese during the war. They noted that the Imperial Japanese Navy began the war with 381 warships of approximately 1,271,000 tons, and completed another 816 ships of 1,048,000 tons during the war. Of these, 1,744,000 tons were sunk; &quot;625,000 tons were sunk by Navy and Marine aircraft, 375,000 tons by submarines, 183,000 tons by surface vessels, 55,000 tons by Army aircraft, and 65,000 tons by various agents&quot;.

The Japanese merchant fleet was likewise destroyed. They started the war with 6,000,000 tons of merchant ships over 500 tons gross weight, which was alone not sufficient to provide for the wartime economy. Another 4,100,000 tons were constructed, captured or requisitioned. However, 8,900,000 tons were sunk, the vast majority of their fleet. Of this, &quot;54.7 percent of this total was attributable to submarines, 16.3 percent to carrier based planes, 10.2 percent to Army land-based planes and 4.3 percent to Navy and Marine land-based planes, 9.3 percent to mines (largely dropped by B-29s), less than 1 percent to surface gunfire and the balance of 4 percent to marine accidents.&quot; The Allied submarine campaign played the largest role, while naval mining by air in Operation Starvation also played a significant role, sinking or damaging more than 1,250,000 tons.

===Against the home islands===
In total, Allied aircraft dropped 656,400 tons of bombs on Japanese targets, 160,800 tons on the home islands. In Europe there were 2,770,000 tons dropped, and 1,415,745 tons on Germany specifically.

After initial attacks from high-altitude precision bombing in which less than 10% of the bombs fell near their targets, Allied air forces switched to low-level night-time incendiary attacks against Japanese cities. On the night of 9–10 March 1945, of eastern Tokyo were burned out and tens of thousands were killed by U.S. Army Air Forces B-29s in Operation Meetinghouse. The Survey estimated that 88,000 died, while the Tokyo Fire Department estimated 97,000. Historian Richard Rhodes estimated more than 100,000, though journalist Mark Selden considered even this figure to be too low. In the following 10 days, a total of were destroyed. The Survey notes that these attacks had little direct effect on manufacturing, with factories that were hit by bombs having less drop off in production than those that did not. However, they also noted that production dropped by 54% during this period due to the effects of bombing: the killing, injuring and dehousing of the workers as well as the destruction of the transportation network. Further, many of the houses destroyed in the bombing contained small shops that made parts for factories, so the bombing of residential districts also destroyed this decentralized manufacturing. They noted a precipitous reduction in food availability as well, dropping from about 2,000 calories per day at the start of the war, to 1,680 for industrial workers at the height of the campaign, and less for non-essential workers. The Survey found that civilian morale dropped across the country from the bombings, not confined to areas that were bombed, but that Japanese dedication to their Emperor prevented morale from inducing a desire to surrender. The Survey stated that Japanese leaders were partially influenced by low civilian morale, but only to the extent that it warranted concerns about maintaining the ruling class.

===Atomic bombing===
The Survey dedicates a separate section of the reports to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

They noted that although the blast wave was of about the same pressure as that of a high-explosive bomb, the duration of the effect was longer and that brick buildings were collapsed as far as at Hiroshima and at Nagasaki, while traditional wood houses were about the same, while reinforced-concrete structures suffered structural damage or collapse up to at Hiroshima and at Nagasaki.

In Hiroshima (August 6, 1945), approximately 60,000 to 70,000 people were killed, and 50,000 were injured. This is out of a pre-war population of about 340,000 that had been reduced to 245,000 through evacuations. Of approximately 90,000 buildings in the city, 65,000 were rendered unusable and almost all the remainder received at least light superficial damage.

In Nagasaki (August 9, 1945), approximately 40,000 persons were killed or missing and a like number injured. This was from a population of about 285,000, which had been reduced to around 230,000 by August 1945. Of the 52,000 residential buildings in Nagasaki, 14,000 were totally destroyed and a further 5,400 badly damaged. The vast majority of Nagasaki&#x27;s industrial output was from the Mitsubishi factories and steel plant, which were 58 and 78 percent destroyed, respectively.

Unlike Hiroshima, Nagasaki featured extensive bomb shelters in the form of tunnels cut into the sides of hills. &quot;...all the occupants back from the entrances survived, even in those tunnels almost directly under the explosion. Those not in a direct line with the entrance were uninjured. The tunnels had a capacity of roughly 100,000 persons. Had the proper alarm been sounded, and these tunnel shelters been filled to capacity, the loss of life in Nagasaki would have been substantially lower.&quot;

The report also concluded that: &quot;Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts, and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey&#x27;s opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.&quot; Military historian Gian Gentile disputed this counterfactual, stating that testimony from Japanese leaders in USSBS interrogations supported the likelihood of Japan continuing the war beyond November and December 1945. Gentile stated that survey authors chose not to publish such evidence, as it challenged their conclusions.

== Survey officers and controversy ==
The Forward to the Summary Report for the Pacific War said, &quot;The United States Strategic Bombing Survey was established by the Secretary of War on 3 November 1944, pursuant to a directive from the late President Roosevelt. It was established for the purpose of conducting an impartial and expert study of the effects of our aerial attack on Germany, to be used in connection with air attacks on Japan and to establish a basis for evaluating air power as an instrument of military strategy, for planning the future development of the United States armed forces, and for determining future economic policies with respect to the national defense.&quot;

The surveys of both the European and Pacific Wars were managed by a team of a dozen civilians, support by &quot;300 civilians, 350 officers, and 500 enlisted men&quot;, who followed closely the advance of the Allied forces, to search for written records of German decisions before the disappeared completely. Many of which were hidden, some even in coffins. Three of the leaders of the European team were replaced for the research in Japan, so the accompanying table of &quot;Officers of the Survey&quot; includes fifteen men. Those fifteen were selected as nonmilitary leaders, many of whom had even greater career success in supporting the development of strategic forces in the US military after the war than before.

A review of a biography of Galbraith said that the survey &quot;found that, contrary to the claims of the U.S. Air Force [sic], &quot;Germany’s war production rose for much of the period when American and British air attacks were at their fiercest. An obituary of Galbraith for the free market economist Foundation for Economic Education said &#x27;Galbraith wrote wittily, “Nothing in World War II air operations was subject to such assault as open agricultural land.” ... Galbraith’s boss, George Ball ... found something equally disturbing about the firebombing of cities. The RAF’s bombing of central Hamburg, for example, destroyed many lives and many businesses in the central city—restaurants, cabarets, department stores, banks, and more. What were the newly unemployed waiters, bank clerks, and entertainers to do? That’s right: seek jobs in the war plants on the edge of the cities “to get the ration cards that the Nazis thoughtfully distributed to workers there.” ... [T]he incredible destruction that the British and air forces wreaked on Germany, with the high loss of human life, didn’t even have the intended effect of slowing Germany&#x27;s war-production machine. Galbraith had to fight hard to have the report published without it being rewritten to hide the essential points. “I defended it,” he later wrote, “with a maximum of arrogance and a minimum of tact.” ... Galbraith also visited Japan, where he analyzed the effect of the use of the atom bomb. He wrote: &quot;The bombs fell after the decision had been taken by the Japanese government to surrender. That the war had to be ended was agreed by at a meeting of key members of the Supreme War Direction Council with the Emperor on June 20, 1945, a full six weeks before the devastation of Hiroshima. The next steps took time. The Japanese government had the usual bureaucratic lags as between decision and action.&quot;&#x27;

== More recent research ==

The introduction to the summary report of air power in Europe noted that, &quot;Allied air power was called upon to play many roles-partner with the Navy over the sea lanes; partner with the Army in ground battle; partner with both on the invasion beaches; reconnaissance photographer for all; mover of troops and critical supplies; and attacker of the enemy&#x27;s vital strength far behind the battle line.&quot; The summary report only discussed the latter: attacks on the enemy&#x27;s vital strength far behind the battle line. Grant (2008) said, &quot;The survey began in no small part as a way to look at the major targeting controversies (rail vs. oil, and so forth) that had so often consumed the attention of top Allied planners and leaders. Its original intent was to sweep up lessons from Europe for use in the ongoing war with Japan.&quot;

The survey reported that the rate of production of war materials by Germany actually &quot;increased&quot; in response to strategic bombing by the Allies. Destroyed factories were quickly reconstituted in hardened sites. John Kenneth Galbraith, who was one of the &quot;Officers&quot; of the USSBS, wrote, &quot;Nothing in World War II air operations was subject to such assault as open agricultural land.&quot; When Allied bombs fell in cities like central Hamburg, they destroyed many lives and often many businesses in the central city—restaurants, cabarets, department stores, banks, and more. The newly unemployed waiters, bank clerks, and entertainers took jobs in the war plants.

In other words, the Allies may have obtained roughly the same benefits from strategic bombing of &quot;the enemy&#x27;s vital strength far behind the battle line&quot; as Hitler gained from The Blitz, namely nothing—or worse: increasing their enemies&#x27; will to resist.

Pape (1996) studied the use of air power from the First World War into the 1990s. He concluded that air power could be effective in direct support of ground operations, but strategic bombing was a waste. Pape&#x27;s conclusions were supported by a more formal quantitative analysis of a larger set of cases by Horowitz and Reiter (2001). The claims of Galbraith, Pape (1996) and Horowitz and Reiter (2001) are controversial.

<text>The opening is the initial stage of a chess game. It usually consists of established theory. The other phases are the middlegame and the endgame. Many opening sequences, known as &quot;openings&quot;, have standard names such as &quot;Sicilian Defense&quot;. &quot;The Oxford Companion to Chess&quot; lists 1,327 named openings and variants, and there are many others with varying degrees of common usage.

Opening moves that are considered standard are referred to as &quot;book moves&quot;, or simply &quot;book&quot;. When a game begins to deviate from known opening theory, the players are said to be &quot;out of book&quot;. In some openings, book lines have been worked out for over 30 moves, such as some lines in the classical King&#x27;s Indian Defense and in the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense.
Professional chess players spend years studying openings, and they continue doing so throughout their careers as opening theory continues to evolve. Players at the club level also study openings, but the importance of the opening phase is less there since games are rarely decided in the opening. The study of openings can become unbalanced if it is to the exclusion of tactical training and middlegame and endgame strategy.

A new sequence of moves in the opening is referred to as a &quot;&quot;. When kept secret until used in a competitive game, it is often known as a &quot;prepared variation&quot;, a powerful weapon in top-class competition.
==Aims of the opening==

===Common aims in opening play===
Whether they are trying to gain the upper hand as White, or to as Black or to create dynamic imbalances, players generally devote a lot of attention in the opening stages to the following strategies:
* &quot;Development:&quot; One of the main aims of the opening is to mobilize the pieces on useful squares where they will have impact on the game. To this end, knights are usually developed to f3, c3, f6, and c6 (or sometimes e2, d2, e7, or d7), and both players&#x27; king and queen pawns are moved so the bishops can be developed (alternatively, the bishops may be &quot;fianchettoed&quot; with a maneuver such as g3 and Bg2). Rapid mobilization is the key. The queen, and to a lesser extent the rooks, are not usually played to a central position until later in the game, when many minor pieces and pawns are no longer present.
* &quot;Control of the center:&quot; At the start of the game, it is not clear on which part of the board the pieces will be needed. Controlling the central squares, however, allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily, and can also have a cramping effect on the opponent. The classical view is that central control is best effected by placing pawns there, ideally establishing pawns on d4 and e4 (or d5 and e5 for Black). However, the hypermodern school showed that it was not always necessary or even desirable to occupy the center in this way, and that too broad a pawn front could be attacked and destroyed, leaving its architect vulnerable; an impressive-looking pawn center is worth little unless it can be maintained. The hypermoderns instead advocated controlling the center from a distance with pieces, breaking down one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s center, and only taking over the center oneself later in the game. This leads to openings such as Alekhine&#x27;s Defense – in a line like 1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.f4 (the Four Pawns Attack) White has a formidable pawn center for the moment, but Black hopes to undermine it later in the game, leaving White&#x27;s position exposed.
* &quot;King safety:&quot; The king is somewhat exposed in the middle of the board. Measures must be taken to reduce his vulnerability. It is therefore common for both players either to castle in the opening (simultaneously developing one of the rooks) or to otherwise bring the king to the side of the board via artificial castling.
* Most openings strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated, doubled and backward pawns, pawn islands, etc. Some openings sacrifice endgame considerations for a quick attack on the opponent&#x27;s position. Some unbalanced openings for Black, in particular, make use of this idea, such as the Dutch and the Sicilian. Other openings, such as the Alekhine and the Benoni, invite the opponent to overextend and form pawn weaknesses. Specific openings accept pawn weaknesses in exchange for compensation in the form of dynamic play. (See Pawn structure.)
* As the players mobilize their pieces, they both seek to ensure that they are working harmoniously towards the control of key squares.
* Transposition is one common way of doing this.

Apart from these ideas, other strategies used in the middlegame may also be carried out in the opening. These include preparing pawn breaks to create counterplay, creating weaknesses in the opponent&#x27;s pawn structure, seizing control of key squares, making favorable exchanges of minor pieces (e.g. gaining the bishop pair), or gaining a space advantage, whether in the center or on the flanks.

===Top-level objectives===
At higher levels of competition, for many years the main objectives of opening play were to obtain a better position when playing as White and to equalize when playing as Black. The idea behind this is that playing first gives White a slight initial advantage; for example, White will be the first to attack if the game opens symmetrically (Black mirrors White&#x27;s moves).

Since about the 1950s another objective has gradually become more dominant. According to IM Jeremy Silman, the purpose of the opening is to create dynamic imbalances between the two sides, which will determine the character of the middlegame and the strategic plans chosen by both sides. For example, in the main line of the Winawer Variation of the French Defense (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3), White will try to use their and advantage to mount an attack on Black&#x27;s , while Black will seek simplifying exchanges (in particular, trading off one of White&#x27;s bishops to blunt this advantage) and counterattack against the weakened pawns on White&#x27;s ; both players accept different combinations of advantages and disadvantages. This idea was a doctrine of the Soviet school of chess.

A third objective, which is complementary to the previous ones and has been common since the 19th century, is to lure the opponent into positions with which the player is more familiar and comfortable than the opponent. This is usually done by transpositions, in which a game that apparently starts with one opening can reach a position that is normally produced by a different opening.

==Opening repertoires==
Most players realize after a while that they play certain types of positions better than others, and that the amount of theory they can learn is limited. Therefore, most players specialize in certain openings where they know the theory and that lead to positions they favor. The set of openings a player has specialized in is called an opening repertoire. The main elements a player needs to consider in a repertoire are:
* As White, whether to open with 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.c4, or 1.Nf3
* As Black, a defense against any of these openings

A very narrow repertoire allows for deeper specialization but also makes a player less flexible to vary against different opponents. In addition, opponents may find it easier to prepare against a player with a narrow repertoire.

The main openings in a repertoire are usually reasonably sound; that is, they should lead to playable positions even against optimal counterplay. Unsound gambits are sometimes used as surprise weapons, but are unreliable for a stable repertoire. Repertoires often change as a player develops, and a player&#x27;s advancement may be stifled if the opening repertoire does not evolve. Some openings that are effective against amateur players are less effective at the master level. For example, Black obtains active play in return for a pawn in the Benko Gambit; amateur players may have trouble defending against Black&#x27;s activity, while masters are more skilled at defending and making use of the extra pawn. Some openings played between grandmasters are so complex and theoretical that amateur players will have trouble understanding them. An example is the Perenyi Attack of the Sicilian Defense (see diagram), which yields an immensely complicated and tactical position that even strong players have difficulty handling, and that is beyond the comprehension of most amateurs.

==Opening nomenclature==
Major changes in the rules of chess in the late fifteenth century increased the speed of the game, consequently emphasizing the importance of opening study. Thus, early chess books, such as the 1497 text of Luis Ramirez de Lucena, present opening analysis, as do Pedro Damiano (1512) and Ruy López de Segura (1561). Ruy López&#x27;s disagreement with Damiano regarding the merits of 2...Nc6 led to 3.Bb5 (after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6) being named for him as the Ruy Lopez or Spanish Opening. Opening theory was studied more scientifically from the 1840s on, and many opening variations were discovered and named in this period and later.

Opening nomenclature developed haphazardly, and most names are historical accidents not based on systematic principles. In the early 1930s, the nascent FIDE embarked on a project to standardize opening nomenclature, culminating in the publication of a short booklet in 1933, but this had little impact.

The oldest openings tend to be named for geographic places and people. Many openings are named after nationalities of players who advocated them, for example Indian, English, Spanish, French, Dutch, Scotch, Russian, Italian, Scandinavian and Sicilian, or places where important games featuring the opening were played such as Vienna, Berlin, and Wilkes-Barre. The Catalan System is named after the Catalonia region.
Chess players&#x27; names are the most common sources of opening names.
The name given to an opening is not always that of the first player to adopt it; often an opening is named for the player who was the first to popularize it or to publish analysis of it. Eponymic openings include the Ruy Lopez, Alekhine&#x27;s Defense, Morphy Defense, and the Réti Opening. Some opening names honor two people, such as the Caro–Kann and the Smith–Morra.
A few opening names are purely descriptive, such as Giuoco Piano (), Two Knights Defense, Four Knights Game and Bishop&#x27;s Opening.

Some openings have been given fanciful names, often names of animals. This practice became more common in the 20th century. By then, most of the more common and traditional sequences of opening moves had already been named, so these tend to be unusual or recently developed openings like the Orangutan, Hippopotamus, Elephant, Hedgehog, and, most recently, the Cow. A few are given humorous names, such as the Monkey&#x27;s Bum and the Toilet Variation.

Opening names usually include characterizing terms like &quot;opening&quot;, &quot;variation&quot;, &quot;defense&quot;, &quot;gambit&quot;, or &quot;attack&quot;; however, the terminology is inconsistent and imprecise, and is not a useful basis for classification. Broadly, these terms are used as follows:

* &quot;Game:&quot; Used for some of the oldest named openings, such as the Scotch Game, Vienna Game, and Four Knights Game. In the 19th century it was used for other common openings such as the Sicilian Defense (&quot;Sicilian Game&quot;) and French Defense (&quot;French Game&quot;).
* &quot;Opening:&quot; This usually refers to an opening played by White, such as the English Opening or Bird&#x27;s Opening.
* &quot;Variation:&quot; Used to describe a branch of another named opening, for example the Najdorf Variation, a line of the Sicilian Defense.
* &quot;Defense:&quot; Refers to an opening chosen by Black, such as Two Knights Defense or Caro-Kann Defense. Some openings described as &quot;defenses&quot;, such as the King&#x27;s Indian Defense and Sicilian Defense, can in fact be quite aggressive.
* &quot;Gambit:&quot; An opening that involves the sacrifice of , usually one or more pawns. Most openings described as &quot;Gambits&quot; are played by White (e.g., King&#x27;s Gambit), but a few are played by Black (e.g., Latvian Gambit). The terms &quot;Accepted&quot; or &quot;Declined&quot; may be appended to the name, depending on whether the opponent takes the offered material, as in the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted and Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined. In the case of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit, the sacrifice of material is only temporary as there is no good way for Black to keep the pawn . 
* &quot;Countergambit:&quot; A gambit played by Black, often in response to another gambit. Examples of this include the Albin Countergambit in response to the Queen&#x27;s Gambit, the Falkbeer Countergambit in response to the King&#x27;s Gambit, and the Greco Counter Gambit (the former name of the Latvian Gambit) in response to the King&#x27;s Knight Opening.
* &quot;System:&quot; A method of development that can be used against many different setups by the opponent. Examples include London System, Colle System, Réti System, Barcza System, and Hedgehog System.
* &quot;Attack:&quot; Usually used to describe an aggressive or provocative variation such as the Albin–Chatard Attack (or Chatard–Alekhine Attack), the Fried Liver Attack in the Two Knights Defense, and the Grob Attack. The King&#x27;s Indian Attack is an exception, describing a King&#x27;s Indian Defense with .
* &quot;Reversed, inverted:&quot; A Black opening played by White, or more rarely a White opening played by Black. Examples include the Sicilian Reversed (from the English Opening) and the Inverted Hungarian. The Reti, King&#x27;s Indian Attack, Sicilian Reversed (from the English), and other &quot;Black played by White with an extra tempo&quot; often start with 1.Nf3 or 1.c4.
* &quot;Anti-:&quot; Prefix for openings designed to avoid a specific line, for example the Anti-Marshall (against the Marshall (Counter) Attack in the Ruy Lopez) and the Anti-Meran Gambit (against the Meran Variation of the Semi-Slav Defense).

==Classification of chess openings==
Chess openings are primarily categorized by move sequences. In the initial position, White has twenty legal moves. Of these, 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.Nf3, and 1.c4 are by far the most popular as these moves do the most to promote rapid development and control of the center. A few other opening moves are considered reasonable but less consistent with opening principles than the four most popular moves. The Dunst Opening, 1.Nc3, develops a knight to a good square, but is somewhat inflexible because it blocks White&#x27;s c-pawn; also, after 1...d5 the knight is liable to be driven to an inferior square by ...d4. (Note that after 1.Nf3 the analogous 1...e5 loses a pawn.) Bird&#x27;s Opening, 1.f4, addresses center control but not development and weakens the king position slightly. The Sokolsky Opening 1.b4 and the King&#x27;s and Queen&#x27;s fianchettos: Larsen&#x27;s Opening 1.b3 and 1.g3 aid development a bit, but they only address center control peripherally and are slower than the more popular openings. The eleven remaining possibilities are rarely played at the top levels of chess. Of these, the best are merely slow such as 1.c3, 1.d3, and 1.e3. Worse possibilities either ignore the center and development such as 1.a3, weaken White&#x27;s position (for instance, 1.f3 and 1.g4), or place the knights on poor squares (1.Na3 and 1.Nh3).

Black has twenty complementary responses to White&#x27;s opening move. Many of these are mirror images of the most popular first moves for White, but with one less tempo. Defenses beginning with 1...c6 and 1...e6, often followed by the center thrust 2...d5, are also popular. Defenses with an early ...d6 coupled with a kingside fianchetto are also commonly played.

The most important scheme of classifying chess openings for serious players is by &quot;ECO&quot; code, a series of 500 opening codes assigned by the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot;. Although these codes are invaluable for the serious study of the chess opening, they are not very practical for a broad survey of the chess opening as the codes obscure common structural features between related openings.

A simple descriptive categorization of the chess opening is king&#x27;s pawn openings, queen&#x27;s pawn openings, and others. Since these categories are still individually very large, it is common to divide each of them further. One reasonable way to group the openings is:
* Double king pawn, symmetric or open games (1.e4 e5)
* Single king pawn or semi-open games (1.e4 other)
* Double queen pawn or closed games (1.d4 d5)
* Single queen pawn or semi-closed games (1.d4 other)
* Flank openings (including 1.c4, 1.Nf3, 1.f4, and others)
* Unusual first moves for White
The Indian systems (1.d4 Nf6) are the most important of the semi-closed games, and warrant separate treatment.

===Open games: 1.e4 e5===
White starts by playing 1.e4 (moving their king pawn two spaces). This is the most popular opening move and it has many strengths—it immediately works on controlling the center, and it activates two pieces (the queen and a bishop). The oldest openings in chess follow 1.e4. Bobby Fischer rated 1.e4 as &quot;Best by test.&quot; On the downside, 1.e4 places a pawn on an undefended square and weakens d4 and f4. If Black mirrors White&#x27;s move and replies with 1...e5, the result is an open game.

The most popular second move for White is 2.Nf3 attacking Black&#x27;s king pawn, preparing for a kingside castle, and anticipating the advance of the queen pawn to d4. Black&#x27;s most common reply is 2...Nc6, which usually leads to the Ruy Lopez (3.Bb5), Scotch Game (3.d4), or Italian Game (3.Bc4). If Black instead maintains symmetry and counterattacks White&#x27;s center with 2...Nf6 then the Petrov&#x27;s Defense results. The Philidor Defense (2...d6) is not popular in modern chess because it allows White an easy space advantage while Black&#x27;s position remains cramped and passive, although solid. Other responses to 2.Nf3 are not seen in master play.

The most popular alternatives to 2.Nf3 are the Vienna Game (2.Nc3), the Bishop&#x27;s Opening (2.Bc4), and the King&#x27;s Gambit (2.f4). These openings have some similarities with each other, in particular the Bishop&#x27;s Opening frequently transposes to variations of the Vienna Game. The King&#x27;s Gambit was extremely popular in the 19th century. White sacrifices a pawn for quick development and to divert a black pawn from the center. The Vienna Game also frequently features attacks on the Black center by means of a f2–f4 pawn advance.

In the Center Game (2.d4) White immediately opens the center but if the pawn is to be recovered after 2...exd4, White must contend with a slightly premature queen development after 3.Qxd4. An alternative is to sacrifice one or two pawns, for example in the Danish Gambit.

Many other variations after 1.e4 e5 have been studied; see Open Game for details.
* 1.e4 e5 Double King&#x27;s Pawn Opening or Open Game
* 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Ruy Lopez
* 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 Scotch Game
* 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Italian Game
* 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6 Four Knights Game
* 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 Petrov&#x27;s Defense
* 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 Philidor Defense
* 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Vienna Game
* 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Bishop&#x27;s Opening
* 1.e4 e5 2.f4 King&#x27;s Gambit
* 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.Qxd4 Center Game
* 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 Danish Gambit

===Semi-open games: 1.e4, Black plays other than 1...e5===

In the semi-open games White plays 1.e4 and Black breaks symmetry immediately by replying with a move other than 1...e5. The most popular Black defense to 1.e4 is the Sicilian (1...c5), but the French (1...e6, normally followed by 2.d4 d5) and the Caro–Kann (1...c6, normally followed by 2.d4 d5) are also very popular. The Pirc and the Modern are closely related openings that are also often seen, while the Alekhine and the Scandinavian have made occasional appearances in World Chess Championship games.

The Sicilian and French Defenses lead to unbalanced positions that can offer exciting play with both sides having chances to win. The Caro–Kann Defense is solid as Black intends to use their c-pawn to support their center (1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5). Alekhine&#x27;s, the Pirc and the Modern are hypermodern openings in which Black tempts White to build a large center with the goal of attacking it with pieces.

Other semi-open games have been studied but are less common; see Semi-Open Game for details.
* 1.e4 c5 Sicilian Defense
* 1.e4 e6 French Defense
* 1.e4 c6 Caro–Kann Defense
* 1.e4 d5 Scandinavian Defense (also known as the Center Counter defense)
* 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 Pirc Defense
* 1.e4 Nf6 Alekhine&#x27;s Defense
* 1.e4 g6 Modern Defense

===Closed games: 1.d4 d5===
The openings classified as closed games begin 1.d4 d5. The move 1.d4 offers the same benefits to development and center control as does 1.e4, but unlike with King Pawn openings where the e4-pawn is undefended after the first move, the d4-pawn is protected by White&#x27;s queen. This slight difference has a tremendous effect on the opening. For instance, whereas the King&#x27;s Gambit is rarely played today at the highest levels of chess, the Queen&#x27;s Gambit remains a popular weapon at all levels of play. Also, compared with the King Pawn openings, transpositions among variations are more common and critical in the closed games.

The most important closed openings are in the Queen&#x27;s Gambit family (White plays 2.c4). The Queen&#x27;s Gambit is somewhat misnamed, since White can always regain the offered pawn if desired. In the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted, Black plays ...dxc4, giving up the center for free development and the chance to try to give White an isolated queen pawn with a subsequent ...c5 and ...cxd4. White will get active pieces and possibilities for the attack. Black has two popular ways to decline the pawn, the Slav (2...c6) and the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined (2...e6). Both of these moves lead to an immense forest of variations that can require a great deal of opening study to play well. Among the many possibilities in the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined are the Orthodox Defense, Lasker&#x27;s Defense, the Cambridge Springs Defense, the Tartakower Variation, and the Tarrasch and Semi-Tarrasch Defenses. Black replies to the Queen&#x27;s Gambit other than 2...dxc4, 2...c6, and 2...e6 are uncommon.

The Colle System and Stonewall Attack are classified as queen&#x27;s pawn games because White plays d4 but not c4. They are also examples of &quot;Systems&quot;, rather than specific opening variations. White develops aiming for a particular formation without great concern over how Black chooses to defend. Both systems are popular with club players because they are easy to learn, but are rarely used by professionals because a well-prepared opponent playing Black can equalize fairly easily. The Stonewall is characterized by the White pawn formation on c3, d4, e3, and f4, and can be achieved by several move orders and against many different Black setups. The diagram positions and the move sequences given below are typical.

Other closed openings have been studied but are less common; see Closed Game for details.
* 1.d4 d5 Double Queen&#x27;s Pawn Opening or Closed Game
* 1.d4 d5 2.c4 Queen&#x27;s Gambit
* 1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted (QGA)
* 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined (QGD)
* 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 Slav Defense
* 1.d4 d5 2.e3 Nf6 3.Bd3 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.f4 (a typical move sequence) Stonewall Attack
* 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.e3 Colle System

===Indian defenses: 1.d4 Nf6===
The Indian systems are asymmetrical defenses to 1.d4 that employ hypermodern chess strategy. Fianchettos are common in many of these openings. As with the closed games, transpositions are important and many of the Indian defenses can be reached by several different move orders. Although Indian defenses were championed in the 1920s by players in the hypermodern school, they were not fully accepted until Soviet players showed in the late 1940s that these systems are sound for Black. Since then, Indian defenses have been the most popular Black replies to 1.d4 because they offer an unbalanced game with chances for both sides. The usual White second move is 2.c4, grabbing a larger share of the center and allowing the move Nc3, to prepare for moving the e-pawn to e4 without blocking the c-pawn. Black&#x27;s most popular replies are:
* 2...e6, freeing the king&#x27;s bishop and leading into the Nimzo-Indian Defense, Queen&#x27;s Indian Defense, Bogo-Indian Defense, Modern Benoni, or regular lines of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined,
* 2...g6, preparing a fianchetto of the king&#x27;s bishop and entering the King&#x27;s Indian Defense or Grünfeld Defense, and
* 2...c5 3.d5 e6, the Modern Benoni, with an immediate counterpunch in the center.

Advocated by Nimzowitsch as early as 1913, the Nimzo-Indian Defense was the first of the Indian systems to gain full acceptance. It remains one of the most popular and well-respected defenses to 1.d4 and White often adopts move orders designed to avoid it. Black attacks the center with pieces and is prepared to trade a bishop for a knight to weaken White&#x27;s queenside with doubled pawns.

The King&#x27;s Indian Defense is aggressive, somewhat risky, and generally indicates that Black will not be satisfied with a draw. Although it was played occasionally as early as the late 19th century, the King&#x27;s Indian was considered inferior until the 1940s, when it was taken up by Bronstein, Boleslavsky, and Reshevsky. Despite being Fischer&#x27;s favored defense to 1.d4, its popularity faded in the mid-1970s. Kasparov&#x27;s successes with the defense restored the King&#x27;s Indian to prominence in the 1980s.

Ernst Grünfeld debuted the Grünfeld Defense in 1922. Distinguished by the move 3...d5, Grünfeld intended it as an improvement to the King&#x27;s Indian which was not considered entirely satisfactory at that time. The Grünfeld has been adopted by World Champions Smyslov, Fischer, and Kasparov.

The Queen&#x27;s Indian Defense is considered solid, safe, and perhaps somewhat drawish. Black often chooses the Queen&#x27;s Indian when White avoids the Nimzo-Indian by playing 3.Nf3 instead of 3.Nc3. Black constructs a sound position that makes no positional concessions, although sometimes it is difficult for Black to obtain good winning chances. Karpov was a leading expert in this opening.

The Modern Benoni is a risky attempt by Black to unbalance the position and gain active piece play at the cost of allowing White a pawn wedge at d5 and a central majority. Tal popularized the defense in the 1960s by winning several brilliant games with it, and Fischer occasionally adopted it, with good results, including a win in his 1972 world championship match against Boris Spassky. Often Black adopts a slightly different move order, playing 2...e6 before 3...c5 in order to avoid the sharpest lines for White.

The Benko Gambit is often played by strong players, and is very popular at lower levels. Black plays to open lines on the queenside where White will be subject to considerable pressure. If White accepts the gambit, Black&#x27;s compensation is positional rather than tactical, and their initiative can last even after many piece exchanges and well into the endgame. White often chooses instead either to decline the gambit pawn or return it.

The Catalan Opening is characterized by White forming a pawn center at d4 and c4 and fianchettoing their king&#x27;s bishop. It resembles a combination of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit and Réti Opening. Since the Catalan can be reached from many different move orders, (one Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined-like move sequence is 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.g3), it is sometimes called the Catalan System.

The most important Indian Defenses are listed below, but many others have been studied and played; see Indian Defense for details.
* 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 Modern Benoni
* 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5 Benko Gambit (or Volga Gambit)
* 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 Nimzo-Indian Defense
* 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 b6 Queen&#x27;s Indian Defense
* 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 Catalan Opening
* 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 Grünfeld Defense
* 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 King&#x27;s Indian Defense (KID)

===Other Black responses to 1.d4===

Of the defenses to 1.d4 other than 1...d5 and 1...Nf6, the most important are the Dutch Defense and the Benoni Defense.
The Dutch, an aggressive defense adopted for a time by World Champions Alekhine and Botvinnik, and played by both Botvinnik and challenger David Bronstein in their 1951 world championship match, is still played occasionally at the top level by Short and others. Another fairly common opening is the Benoni Defense, which may become very wild if it develops into the Modern Benoni, though other variations are more solid.

Several other uncommon semi-closed openings have been named and studied, see Semi-Closed Game for details.
* 1.d4 c5 Benoni Defense
* 1.d4 f5 Dutch Defense

===Flank openings (including English, Réti, Bird&#x27;s, and White fianchettos)===

The flank openings are the group of White openings typified by play on one or both flanks.
White plays in hypermodern style, attacking the center from the flanks with pieces rather than occupying it with pawns. These openings are played often, and 1.Nf3 and 1.c4 trail only 1.e4 and 1.d4 in popularity as opening moves.

If White opens with 1.Nf3, the game often becomes one of the d4 openings (closed games or semi-closed games) by a different move order (called &quot;transposition&quot;), but unique openings such as the Réti and King&#x27;s Indian Attack are also common. The Réti itself is characterized by White playing 1.Nf3, fianchettoing one or both bishops, and not playing an early d4 (which would generally transpose into one of the 1.d4 openings).

The King&#x27;s Indian Attack (KIA) is a system of development that White may use in reply to almost any Black opening moves. The characteristic KIA setup is 1.Nf3, 2.g3, 3.Bg2, 4.0-0, 5.d3, 6.Nbd2, and 7.e4, although these moves may be played in several different orders. In fact, the KIA is often reached after 1.e4 when White uses it to respond to a Black attempt to play one of the semi-open games such as the Caro–Kann, French, or Sicilian, or even the open games that usually follow 1.e4 e5. Its greatest appeal may be that by adopting a set pattern of development, White can avoid the large amount of opening study required to prepare to meet the many different possible Black replies to 1.e4.

The English Opening (1.c4) also frequently transposes into a d4 opening, but it can take on independent character as well including the Symmetrical Variation (1.c4 c5) and the Reversed Sicilian (1.c4 e5).

1.g3, the King&#x27;s Fianchetto Opening or Benko&#x27;s Opening, received renewed attention after Pal Benko used it to defeat both Fischer and Tal in the 1962 Candidates Tournament in Curaçao. It is flexible and usually transposes into a known opening such as the King&#x27;s Indian Attack or Reti Opening.

Larsen&#x27;s Opening (1.b3) and the Sokolsky Opening (1.b4) are occasionally seen in grandmaster play.

With Bird&#x27;s Opening (1.f4) White tries to get a strong grip on the e5-square.
The opening can resemble a Dutch Defense in reverse after 1.f4 d5, or Black may try to disrupt White by playing 1...e5 (From&#x27;s Gambit).
* 1.b3 Larsen&#x27;s Opening
* 1.b4 Sokolsky Opening
* 1.c4 English Opening
* 1.Nf3 Zukertort Opening (characteristically followed by fianchettoing one or both bishops, and without an early d4)
* 1.Nf3, 2.g3, 3.Bg2, 4.0-0, 5.d3, 6.Nbd2, 7.e4 King&#x27;s Indian Attack (KIA) (moves may be played in many different orders)
* 1.f4 Bird&#x27;s Opening
* 1.g3 Benko Opening
* 1.g4 Grob&#x27;s Attack

===Unusual first moves for White===

First moves other than the king pawn (1.e4), queen pawn (1.d4), or flank openings (1.b3, 1.b4, 1.c4, 1.Nf3, 1.f4, or 1.g3) are not regarded as effective ways to exploit White&#x27;s first-move advantage and thus are rarely played. Although some of these openings are not actually bad for White, each of the twelve remaining possible first moves suffers one or more of the following defects compared to the more popular choices:
* too passive for White (1.d3, 1.e3, 1.c3, or 1.Nc3)
* gratuitously weakens White&#x27;s position (1.f3 or 1.g4)
* does little to aid White&#x27;s development or control the center (1.a3, 1.a4, 1.h3, or 1.h4)
* develops a knight to an inferior square (1.Na3 or 1.Nh3)

<text>The Mare Island Naval Shipyard (MINSY or MINS) was the first United States Navy base established on the Pacific Ocean and was in service 142 years from 1854 to 1996. It is located on Mare Island, northeast of San Francisco, in Vallejo, California. MINSY made a name for itself as the premier U.S. West Coast submarine port as well as serving as the controlling force in San Francisco Bay Area shipbuilding efforts during World War II.

The naval base was closed on 31 March 1996, with more than 7,500 civilians on its payroll, and has gone through several redevelopment phases. It was registered as a California Historical Landmark in 1960, and parts of it were declared a National Historic Landmark District in 1975.

==Beginnings==
In September 1849, Lieutenant Commander William Pope McArthur was placed in command of the US survey schooner &quot;Ewing&quot;, which had been brought around Cape Horn to the West Coast by Lieutenant Washington Allon Bartlett. Upon reaching San Francisco, &quot;Ewing&quot; and the other ship assigned to the survey, , were hampered from progress due to desertions of their crews to the gold fields, including a mutiny when crew members rowing into the city from &quot;Ewing&quot; threw an officer overboard in an attempt to desert. They managed to survey the Mare Island Strait before steaming to Hawaii to obtain crewmen from Hawaiian monarch King Kamehameha III. They returned to San Francisco in the spring of 1850 with the coastal survey of northern California beginning on 4 April 1850 and continued up to the mouth of the Columbia River. On 1 August 1850, while still in Oregon, McArthur purchased a interest in Mare Island for $468.50 then returned to San Francisco later that month to prepare charts and write reports.
On 15 January 1852, Secretary of the Navy William A. Graham ordered a Naval Commission to select a site for a naval yard on the Pacific Coast. Commodore D. Sloat along with Commodore C. Ringgold, Simon F. Blunt and William P.S. Sanger (former overseer of construction of Drydock Number One, Norfolk Naval Shipyard) were appointed to the commission. On 13 July 1852, Sloat recommended Mare Island, across Mare Island Strait from the settlement of Vallejo. The next month, a sectional floating dry dock, authorized by Secretary Graham for use in California, arrived in San Francisco. It was built in New York and shipped in sections around Cape Horn. In 1853, the Navy purchased Mare Island, the original 956 acres (387 ha) of land for MINSY, for a grand sum of $83,491; subsequently the floating dry dock was moved into place in Mare Island Strait. McArthur&#x27;s family share (he had died a few months after purchasing his share of Mare Island) was $5,218. Based on observations at the site, Sanger conceived the original plan for the naval yard at Mare Island, later formalized by planners at the Navy Bureau of Yards and Docks in Washington, D.C. Although the 1854 Sanger plan was basically sound and mostly implemented, it did not overcome its natural shortcoming: the naval yard was built on an island on shallow San Pablo Bay.

On 16 September 1854, the Navy commenced shipbuilding and ship repair operations at Mare Island under the command of then-Commander David Farragut, who later gained fame during the U.S. Civil War Battle of Mobile Bay, when he gave the order, &quot;Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!&quot; Farragut and his newly appointed Civil Engineer, Daniel Turner, began to implement Sanger&#x27;s original plan with only a few minor modifications. Of the early buildings constructed under Turner, five are still standing in historic Shipyard North: Building 46, a smithery built in 1856; Building 71, a storage built in 1858; Building 85, a foundry built in 1858; Building 87, a machine shop built in 1858; and Building 89/91, a boiler shop built in 1858. The other MINSY area constructed was the Ammunition Depot at the south end of the Island, used to store ordnance from warships under repair. Still standing from the Turner years in Ammunition Depot is Building A1, a magazine built in 1857.

MINSY served as a major Pacific Ocean repair station during the late 19th century, handling American as well as Japanese and Russian vessels in the course of duty.
In 1861, the longest lived of the clipper ships, , was brought to Mare Island Navy Yard for $15,000 of repairs. &quot;Syren&quot; had struck Mile Rock twice while trying to sail out of the Golden Gate.

Marines first arrived for duty in 1862 under the command of Maj Addison Garland, who was the first officer to command the Marine barracks on the island.

Built in 1901 under the guidance of Chaplain Adam A. McAlister and U.S. Senator George C. Perkins, St. Peter&#x27;s Chapel was the second chapel built on a U.S. Navy property, the first in the Pacific, and the first interdenominational chapel in the armed services. According to historian McDonald, &quot;The chapel, more than any other building, bears witness to the closeness of the community that developed at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard.&quot;

Mare Island Naval Shipyard also took a commanding role in civil defense and emergency response on the West Coast, dispatching warships to the Pacific Northwest to subdue Native American unrest. MINSY sent ships such as south to Central America and the Panama Canal to protect US political and commercial interests. Some of the support, logistics and munition requirements for the Spanish–American War were filled by Mare Island. MINSY sent men, materiel and ships to San Francisco in response to the fires following the 1906 earthquake. Arctic rescue missions were mounted as necessary. Ordnance manufacturing and storage were two further key missions at MINSY for nearly all of its active service, including ordnance used prior to the American Civil War.
In 1911, the Marine Corps established two West Coast recruit training depots first at Mare Island, the second at Puget Sound, Washington. Mare Island eventually became the West Coast&#x27;s only recruit training facility when the Puget Sound operation consolidated to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1912. Instructors trained recruits there until 10 August 1923, when they relocated to Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego.

==World War I==

In 1917, when the Marine Expeditionary Force in the Pacific was assigned to Mare Island, the MINSY Marine Corps compound, which was always under Marine Corps command, was relocated to the large hilltop isolated from and west of Shipyard South. The newly built Building M37, a handsome three-story reinforced-concrete building of Beaux Arts design, occupied the entire eastern end of a huge parade ground. It served as the focal point, headquarters, and barracks of the Marine Corps detachment at MINSY. During World War I, the MINSY Marine Corps compound was the major training station on the West Coast.

In July 1917, MINSY was the site of a major explosion that killed six people. On July 9, a gunpowder magazine containing 127,600 pounds of black powder blew up, damaging a number of surrounding buildings, and leaving a mystery as to what had caused it. Suspicion settled on an identified German agent and possible saboteur, Lothar Witzke, but the investigation proved inconclusive and the official verdict was that the cause was unknown. Stephen C. Ruder has suggested in a 2022 article that it may not have been an act of German sabotage but suicide by a civilian, Neil Damstedt, who was the principal victim and only individual inside the magazine at the moment of explosion.

MINSY saw major shipbuilding efforts during World War I. MINSY holds a shipbuilding speed record for a destroyer that still stands, launching in just days in May–June 1918. Mare Island was selected by the Navy for construction of the only US West Coast-built dreadnought battleship, , launched in 1919. Several pre-dreadnought battleships had previously been launched at San Francisco and Seattle. Noting the power of underwater warfare shown by German U-boats in World War I, the Navy doubled their Pacific-based submarine construction program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard by founding a submarine program at MINSY in the early 1920s.

=== Mare Island Marines Football Team ===
During this period, the Marines stationed at MINSY fielded a college football team which competed against teams in the Pacific Coast Conference and other military service football teams. After the United States entered WWI during April 1917, many college athletes joined or were drafted into the military. Enrolments diminished at universities around the country, with many schools cutting back their sports programs as a result. Consequently, military academies and training bases established football teams composed mostly of college players who had been recruited for service. This was further encouraged by officials who considered football to be excellent war training, with its themes of leadership, teamwork, and discipline. The 1917 Mare Island Marines football team strung together an impressive first season, going 8–0, shutting out six opponents, winning the 1918 Rose Bowl against the Camp Lewis 91st Division football team, and outscoring all of their opponents by a combined total of 200 to 10. This was despite only 500 Marines being stationed at the base when the team was formed. The 1918 Mare Island Marines football team fielded an entirely new roster, which achieved a similar level of success as the previous year. They finished the season with a 10–1 record, losing only in the 1919 Rose Bowl to the Great Lakes Navy Bluejackets.

===Interwar years===

The Marine Corps training continued after World War I until 1921, when the Marine Corps recruitment center opened in San Diego. The MINSY Marine Corps detachment continued to occupy Building M37 until 1996, but never regained its pre-1921 importance. From around 1922 to 1937, an airfield was established west of the Marine Barracks (Building M37) as a support base for the Navy&#x27;s first aircraft carrier, , which had her origin at Mare Island. When &quot;Langley&quot; was at MINSY for repairs, her planes had to be removed to the MINSY airfield, which was also used for training. At her overhaul at MINSY in 1925, her deck was extended 23 feet, increasing her complement of planes to two full squadrons (36 planes). From October 1936 to February 1937, she was converted to a seaplane tender at MINSY.

In 1919, MINSY was finally, after 65 years, linked to mainland Vallejo by a causeway with a drawbridge, which provided direct land-based movement of supplies and personnel across Mare Island Strait. Owing to the shallowness of the shipping channels in Mare Island Strait and San Pablo Bay, the larger battleships and carriers of the Pacific fleet were sent not to MINSY but to leased dry docks then-privately owned at Hunters Point. However, submarine work was especially suited for Mare Island. MINSY became the major West Coast submarine repair facility in WWI and in 1925 was awarded a contract to build its first submarine, . In the 1930s, land reclamation nearly doubled the usable acreage on Mare Island. For example, the low-lying North End marshland were raised above high tide, making it available for future MINSY expansion.

Before World War II, the Navy established Station I at Mare Island as one of four High Frequency Direction Finding (HFDF) stations on the Pacific mainland to track Japanese naval and merchant shipping east of Hawaii. The other stations were: Point Arguello, California (Station Z), Point Saint George, California (Station T), and Fort Stevens, Oregon (Station S).

==World War II==
Base facilities included a hospital, ammunition depot, paint and rubber testing laboratories, and schools for firefighters, opticians, and anti-submarine attack during World War II. MINSY reached peak capacity for shipbuilding, repair, overhaul, and maintenance of many different kinds of seagoing vessels including both surface combatants and submarines. Up to 50,000 workers were employed. Mare Island even received Royal Navy cruisers and destroyers and four Soviet Navy subs for service.

Before the wartime expansion, MINSY had a usable area of about 635 acres. By 1945, MINSY more than doubled its usable area to about 1500 acres, much of which was reclaimed land at the North End. Most of the large permanent buildings were built between 1938 and 1941, before concrete and steel became restricted because of wartime demands. Shipyard South had the newest and best-built or redesigned industrial buildings for mass pre-fabricated sub-assembly production of submarines as well as the waterfront repair of battle-damaged vessels. The open North End was transformed into a new assembly plant for mass production of escort vessels and landing crafts, producing at its peak performance one destroyer escort every ten days and one landing craft each day.

Following the War, MINSY was considered to be one of the primary stations for construction and maintenance of the Navy&#x27;s Pacific fleet of submarines, having built seventeen submarines and four submarine tenders by the end of hostilities.

===War bonds===
Patriotism and &quot;esprit de corps&quot; among the workers ran very high. Mare Island&#x27;s military and civilian workforce raised almost $76M in war bonds; enough to pay for every one of the submarines built at MINSY prior to VJ Day. More than 300 landing craft were built at Mare Island.

==Dry docks and slipways==
When the shipyard was commissioned in 1854, it relied on a floating dry dock for ship repair. Although the Navy intended from the outset to have a permanent dry dock at Mare Island, the funds were not available until 1872, when Congress authorized $2 million for its construction. By then, Calvin Brown took over design and construction from Daniel Turner, the first civil engineer at the base. Dry Dock 1 was designed by Brown, who prepared for it by touring facilities throughout the U.S. and Europe, and was his most enduring achievement. Dry Dock 1 was the &quot;raison d&#x27;etre&quot; of the 19th century shipyard, the most important single structure at Mare Island. It remains one of the most remarkable examples of stone masonry construction in the United States.

The first concrete foundation for Dry Dock 1 was poured in 1874 and the first granite stone was laid the next year. The granite blocks were cut at quarries at Crystal Lake, Pino, Rocklin, Folsom, and Penryn. The entire surface of Dry Dock 1 is finished in dressed granite blocks. The floor is smooth and the walls are finished in stepped blocks. Construction of Dry Dock 1 was completed in 1891, $400,000 or 20% over budget. Owing to the large increases in the size of American ships in the late 19th century, the Navy began construction of a much longer, concrete, second dry dock shortly after the completion of the historic granite Dry Dock 1.
Dry Dock 2 was built between 1899 and 1910 during a period of intense modernization of Mare Island. The March 1898 Mare Island earthquake that leveled many of the unreinforced masonry structures on the base and the 1898 Spanish-American War convinced the Navy and Congress to modernize Mare Island in order to maintain a substantial fleet in the Pacific. A key element to supporting the Pacific fleet was the construction a &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; Dry Dock 2 that can accommodate any ship of the Navy afloat or under design. It needed to be several hundred feet longer than Dry Dock 1 and had to be built at a 45-degree angle to the shoreline, adjacent to Dry Dock 1, to avoid demolition of the older shop buildings on the waterfront. It was lined with modern hydraulic concrete, with granite masonry used only in critical areas, like its locks and upper sill. Dry Dock 2 served as the main dry dock at Mare Island for three decades, from 1910 through the 1930s. During the build-up leading to and during World War II to meet the sharply increasing demand for the shipyard&#x27;s dual and competing mission of shipbuilding and ship-repairing, two more dry docks were built: Dry Dock 3, the second largest dry dock at Mare Island, and Dry Dock 4, used primarily for submarines and destroyers, both in the newer, more modernized Shipyard South area.


Prior to the wartime expansion beginning in 1938, there were two building ways, No. 1 and 2, at Shipyard North. By the end of World War II, six new building ways had been added in two areas. Ways No. 3 was added to the redesigned Shipyard South and was used primarily for dry dock tugs, barges, and other small crafts. Ways No. 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 were added to the newly transformed North End and were used primarily for mass production of destroyer escorts and landing crafts. The yard also increased greatly its berthing capacity; at its peak MINSY was capable of berthing and working on 100 ships at one time.

==Shipbuilding==

With the prelude to, and the outbreak of World War II, the Mare Island Naval Shipyard specialized in submarines, and other than a few submarine tenders and destroyer escorts, no more surface ships were built there. MINSY continued building non-nuclear subs through the Cold War including two of the three &quot;Barracuda&quot;-class submarines and , an early guided missile launcher. In 1955, Mare Island was awarded the contract to build , the first nuclear submarine laid down at a Pacific base.

The shipyard became one of the few that built and overhauled nuclear submarines, including several UGM-27 Polaris submarines. 1970 saw the launching of , the last nuclear submarine built in California. In 1972, the Navy officially ceased building new nuclear submarines at Mare Island, though overhaul of existing vessels continued. was decommissioned at Mare Island in 1980, then rigged for towing back to Groton, Connecticut, to serve as a museum of naval history.

===Riverine training===
In 1966, during the Vietnam War, the U.S. Navy transferred their Brown Water Navy Riverine Training Operations from Coronado, California, to Mare Island. Motorists traveling along Highway 37 could often see U.S. Navy River Patrol Boats, among other river assault type boats, maneuvering through the sloughs of what is now the Napa-Sonoma State Wildlife Area, which borders the north and west portions of Mare Island.

U.S. Navy Reserve Units may still operate the slough portions of the State Wildlife Area for training purposes, as the navigable waters are considered public property. The U.S. Navy Brown Water Riverine Forces were inactivated after the Vietnam War, maintaining only the U.S. Naval Reserve PBRs and auxiliary craft at Mare Island, until the 1996 base closure.

U.S. Naval Construction Battalion Unit 421

Mare Island was also home to the Seabees CBU 421 who completed many construction projects in the bay area including renovation and restoration of St. Peter&#x27;s chapel. St. Peter&#x27;s is the oldest Navy Chapel in the United States built in 1901.

===Pacific Reserve Fleet, Mare Island===
Pacific Reserve Fleet, Mare Island was a large US reserve fleet that opened in 1946 to store the many surplus ships after World War II. As part of the United States Navy reserve fleets, the fleet &quot;mothballed&quot; ships and submarines. Some ships in the fleet were reactivated for the Korean War and Vietnam War. The Reserve Fleet closed in 1996 with the shipyard. The ships were scrapped or moved to other reserve fleets.

==Base closure==
Mare Island Naval Shipyard expanded to over during its service life and was responsible for construction of over 500 naval vessels and overhauling thousands of other vessels. Though it remained a strong contender for continued operations, MINSY was identified for closure during the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process of 1993. Naval operations ceased and the facility was decommissioned on 31 March 1996.

The California Conservation Corps, Touro University California, and numerous commercial and industrial businesses are currently leasing property aboard the former naval shipyard. In May 2000, the Navy completed the transfer of a former housing area called Roosevelt Terrace using an &quot;economic development conveyance&quot;; a method to accelerate the transfer of BRAC facilities back to civilian communities for their economic benefit. The Navy is also transferring property at the shipyard to other government agencies such as Fish and Wildlife Service refuge, a Forest Service office building, an Army Reserve Center, a Coast Guard communications facility, and a Department of Education school.

==Appearances in popular culture==
The shipyard was featured by Huell Howser in &quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot; Episode 704.

Scenes from the 2018 science fiction film &quot;Bumblebee&quot; were filmed in the industrial section of Mare Island, most notably the dry dock slipways.

In 2015 FIAT shot an automobile commercial along the industrial waterside, including a chase scene on the old coal shed loading platform.

<text>Robert Lee Hayes (December 20, 1942 – September 18, 2002), nicknamed &quot;Bullet Bob&quot;, was an American sprinter and professional football player. After winning gold medals at the 1964 Summer Olympics, he played as a split end in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys (for 11 seasons). Hayes is the only athlete to win both an Olympic gold medal and a Super Bowl ring. He was a two-sport standout in college in both track and field and football at Florida A&amp;M University. Hayes was enshrined in the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor in 2001 and was selected for induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in January 2009. Hayes is the second Olympic gold medalist to be inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, after Jim Thorpe. He once held the world record for the 70-yard dash (with a time of 6.9 seconds). He also is tied for the world&#x27;s second-fastest time in the 60-yard dash.
He was once considered the &quot;world&#x27;s fastest human&quot; by virtue of his multiple world records in the 60-yard, 100-yard, 220-yard, and Olympic 100-meter dashes. He was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Hayes attended Matthew Gilbert High School in Jacksonville, where he was a backup halfback on the football team. The 1958 Gilbert High Panthers finished 12–0, winning the Florida High School Athletic Association black school state championship with a 14–7 victory over Dillard High School of Fort Lauderdale before more than 11,000 spectators. In times of racial segregation laws, their achievement went basically unnoticed, until 50 years later when they were recognized as one of the best teams in Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) history.

==College career==
Hayes was a highly recruited athlete, and accepted a football scholarship from Florida A&amp;M University, a historically black college, where he excelled in track and field.

He never lost a race in the 100-yard or 100-meter competitions, but mainstream schools of the area still did not invite him to their sanctioned meets. In 1962 the University of Miami invited him to a meet on their campus, where he tied the world record of 9.2 seconds in the 100-yard dash, which had been set by Frank Budd of Villanova University the previous year. He also was the first person to break six seconds in the 60-yard dash with his indoor world record of 5.9 seconds.

In 1963, although he never used a traditional sprinter form, he broke the 100-yard dash record with a time of 9.1, a mark that would not be broken for eleven years (until Ivory Crockett ran a 9.0 in 1974). That same year, Hayes set the world best for 200 meters (20.5 seconds, although the time was never ratified) and ran the 220-yard dash in a time of 20.6 seconds (while running into an eight mph wind). He was selected to represent the United States in the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. His football coach Jake Gaither was not very high on giving Hayes time to train, which caused then president Lyndon B. Johnson to call him and insist he allow Hayes time off and to keep him healthy.

He was the AAU 100-yard dash champion three years running, from 1962–1964, and in 1964 was the NCAA champion in the 200-meter dash. He missed part of his senior year because of his Olympic bid for the gold medal.

In 1976, he was inducted into the inaugural class of the Florida A&amp;M University Sports Hall of Fame. In 1996, he was inducted into the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference Hall of Fame. In 2011, he was inducted into the Black College Football Hall of Fame.

==Olympics==


At the 1964 Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, Hayes won the 100m and in doing so tied the then world record in the 100 m with a time of 10.06 seconds, even though he was running in lane 1 which had, the day before, been used for the 20 km racewalk and this badly damaged the cinder track. He also was running in borrowed spikes because one of his shoes had been kicked under the bed when he was playing with some friends and he didn&#x27;t realize until he got there. This was followed by a second gold medal in the 4×100 meter relay, which also produced a new World Record (39.06 seconds).
However, the international track and field federation World Athletics, formerly IAAF, faultily &quot;only&quot; accredits Hayes with a hand-timed 10.0 s during his 10.06 s race making him Olympic Champion over 100m - that although the official manual stopwatches clocked Hayes at 9.8 s, 9.9 s and 9.9 s, which, according to the rules, was a hand-timed 9.9 s.

Hayes&#x27; come-from-behind win for the US team in the relay was one of the most memorable Olympic moments. Hand-timed between 8.5 and 8.9 seconds, his relay leg is the fastest in history. Jocelyn Delecour, France&#x27;s anchor leg runner, famously said to Paul Drayton before the relay final that, &quot;You can&#x27;t win, all you have is Bob Hayes.&quot; Drayton was able to reply afterwards, &quot;That&#x27;s all we need.&quot; The race was also Hayes&#x27; last as a track and field athlete, as he permanently switched to football after it, aged only 21.

In some of the first meets to be timed with experimental fully automatic timing, Hayes was the first man to break ten seconds for the 100 meters, albeit with a 5.3 m/s wind assistance in the semi-finals of the 1964 Olympics. His time was recorded at 9.91 seconds. Jim Hines officially broke 10 seconds at the high altitude of Mexico City, Mexico in 1968 (and on a synthetic track) with a wind-legal 9.95 which stood as the world record for almost 15 years. The next to surpass Hayes at a low altitude Olympics was Carl Lewis in 1984 when he won in 9.99, some 20 years later (though Hasely Crawford equaled the time in 1976).

Until the Tokyo Olympics, world records were measured by officials with stopwatches, measured to the nearest tenth of a second. Although fully automatic timing was used in Tokyo, the times were given the appearance of manual timing. This was done by adding 0.05 seconds to the automatic time and rounding to the nearest tenth of a second, making Hayes&#x27; time of 10.06 seconds convert to 10.0 seconds, despite the fact that the officials with stopwatches had measured Hayes&#x27; time to be 9.9 seconds, and the average difference between manual and automatic times was typically 0.15 to 0.20 seconds. This unique method of determining the official time therefore denied Hayes the record of being the first to officially record 9.9 seconds for the 100 meters. The first official times of 9.9 seconds were recorded at the &quot;Night of Speed&quot; in 1968.

==Professional football career==

===Dallas Cowboys===
The Dallas Cowboys selected Hayes in the seventh round (88th overall) of the 1964 NFL draft with a future draft pick, which allowed the team to draft him before his college eligibility was over, taking a chance that the Olympic sprinter with unrefined football skills could excel as a wide receiver. He was also selected by the Denver Broncos in the 14th round (105th overall) of the 1964 AFL Draft, with a future selection. Hayes has been credited by many with forcing the NFL to develop a zone defense and the bump and run to attempt to contain him.

Hayes&#x27; first two seasons were most successful, during which he led the NFL both times in receiving touchdowns with 12 and 13 touchdowns, respectively. In 1966 Hayes caught six passes for 195 yards against the New York Giants at the Cotton Bowl. Later, in the Dallas Cowboys-Washington Redskins match-up, Hayes caught nine passes for 246 yards (a franchise record until Miles Austin broke it with a 250-yard performance on October 11, 2009, against the Kansas City Chiefs). Hayes&#x27; speed forced other teams to go to a zone since no single player could keep up with him. Spreading the defense out in hopes of containing Hayes allowed the Cowboys&#x27; talented running game to flourish, rushers Don Perkins, Calvin Hill, Walt Garrison and Duane Thomas taking advantage of the diminished coverage at the line of scrimmage. In the 1967 season, Hayes led the NFL in punt return yards, and went on to set an NFL playoff record with 141 punt return yards in Dallas&#x27; 52-14 win over the Cleveland Browns. Hayes also caught 5 passes for 145 yards in that game, including an 86-yard touchdown catch.

Hayes is also infamous for two events, both involving the NFL championship games in 1966 and 1967, both against the Green Bay Packers. In the 1966 game, on the last meaningful play of the game, Hayes missed an assignment of blocking linebacker Dave Robinson, which resulted in Don Meredith nearly being sacked by Robinson and as a result throwing a desperation pass into the end zone that was intercepted by Tom Brown. In the 1967 NFL championship, the &quot;Ice Bowl&quot; played on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1967, Hayes was alleged to have inadvertently disclosed whether the upcoming play was a pass or run because on running plays he kept his hands inside his pants to keep them warm and the Green Bay defense knew they didn&#x27;t need to cover him.

On July 17, 1975, he was traded to the San Francisco 49ers in exchange for a third round draft choice (#73-Duke Fergerson).

Hayes wore No. 22 with the Cowboys, which would later be worn by running back Emmitt Smith.

===San Francisco 49ers===
In 1975 with the San Francisco 49ers, Hayes teamed up with Gene Washington in the starting lineup. On October 23, he was waived after not playing up to expectations, in order to make room for wide receiver Terry Beasley.

===Multiple offensive threat===
In addition to receiving, Hayes returned punts for the Cowboys and was the NFL&#x27;s leading punt returner in 1968 with a 20.8 yards per return average and two touchdowns, including a 90 yarder against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was named to the Pro Bowl three times and First-team All-Pro twice and Second-team All-Pro twice. He helped Dallas win five Eastern Conference titles, two NFC titles, played in two Super Bowls, and was instrumental in Dallas&#x27; first-ever Super Bowl victory after the 1971 season, making Hayes the only person to win both an Olympic gold medal and a Super Bowl ring. Later in his career, as defenses improved playing zone and the bump and run was refined, Hayes&#x27; value was as a decoy rather than a deep threat.

===Cowboy records===
Hayes was the second player (after Franklin Clarke) in the history of the Dallas Cowboys franchise to surpass 1,000 yards (ground or air) in a single season, and he did that in his rookie year by finishing with 1,003 yards. Also during his rookie year, he led the team with 46 receptions and set franchise records for total touchdowns (13) and total receiving touchdowns (12). He finished his 11-year career with 371 receptions for 7,414 yards and 71 touchdowns, giving him an impressive 20 yards per catch average (his yards per catch average remains a franchise record, while his touchdown reception record stood until 2017, when it was broken by Dez Bryant.) He also rushed for 68 yards on 24 carries and two touchdowns, gained 581 yards on 23 kickoff returns, and returned 104 punts for 1,158 yards and three touchdowns.

In 1965 he also started a streak (1965–1966) of seven consecutive games with at least a touchdown catch, which still stands as a Cowboys record shared with Franklin Clarke (1961–1962), Terrell Owens (2007) and Dez Bryant (2012).

His 7,295 receiving yards are the sixth-most in Dallas Cowboys history. To this day, Hayes holds ten regular-season receiving records, four punt return records and 22 overall franchise marks, making him one of the greatest receivers to ever play for the Cowboys.

In 2004, he was named to the Professional Football Researchers Association Hall of Very Good in the association&#x27;s second HOVG class.

==Pro Football Hall of Fame==

===2004 controversy===
Hayes was close to being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2004, but was denied the opportunity in the final round of decision-making. The decision was marred by controversy, with many claiming that the Hall of Fame Senior Selection Committee had a bias against members of the Dallas Cowboys and other NFL teams. Others believe Hayes&#x27; legal and drug use issues marred his chances. Shortly after the announcement of the new 2004 Hall of Fame members, long-time &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Paul Zimmerman resigned from the Selection Committee in protest of the decision to leave Hayes out of the Hall. Zimmerman eventually returned as a Hall of Fame voter.

===2009 induction===
On August 27, 2008, Hayes was named as one of two senior candidates for the 2009 Hall of Fame election. On Saturday, January 31, 2009, he was selected as a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame&#x27;s Class of 2009.

The next day Lucille Hester, who claimed to be Hayes&#x27;s sister, released a letter she said he had drafted three years before he died, on October 29, 1999, in case he did not live to see his induction. Its full text read:

You know I am not sure I am going to be around if I get into the Pro Football Hall of Fame so you must read this for me, I am not sure, I guess I am feeling sorry for myself at this time but you must remember everything I want you to do and say. Mother said you would do what I want because you always did. So read this for me.

I would like to thank everyone who supported me to get into the NFL Hall of Fame, the Dallas Cowboys organization, all of my team mates and everyone who played for the Cowboys, (thank the San Francisco 49rs too). Thank the fans all around the country and the world, thank the committee who voted for me and also the ones who may did not vote for me, thank Mother and my family, thank Roger Stauback and tell all my teammates I love them dearly.

Thank the Pro Football Hall of Fame, all the NFL teams and players, Florida A&amp;M University, thank everyone who went to Mathew Gilbert High School, thank everyone in Jacksonville and Florida and everyone especially on the East Side of Jacksonville. Thank everyone in the City of Dallas and in Texas and just thank everyone in the whole world.

I love you all.

Delivered by Hester in front of hundreds and a national cable television audience, the moment was described as &quot;... one of the most compelling and touching scenes the Hall of Fame has seen.&quot; Shortly after, it was discovered that the supposedly signed letter was printed in the Calibri font, which was not released to the public until five years after Hayes&#x27; death. Some family members disputed Lucille Hester&#x27;s claim to be related to Bob, and took steps to ensure she was not part of the Hall of Fame ceremony.

On August 8, 2009, Hayes was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Roger Staubach, Hayes&#x27; Dallas Cowboy teammate, along with Hayes&#x27; son Bob Hayes Jr., unveiled the bust, which was sculpted by Scott Myers. On hand were six members of Bob&#x27;s Gilbert High School championship team. He was later inducted into the Texas Track and Field Coaches Hall of Fame, Class of 2017.

<doc id="68425" wikidata="Q345673" url="?curid=68425" title="Bobby Morrow">
<text>Bobby Joe Morrow (October 15, 1935May 30, 2020) was an American sprinter who won three gold medals at the 1956 Olympics. He has been called &quot;the dominant sprinter of the 1950s&quot; and &quot;the most relaxed sprinter of all time, even more so than his hero Jesse Owens&quot;.

==Early life==
Morrow was born in Harlingen, Texas, on October 15, 1935, and raised on a cotton and carrot farm on the outskirts of San Benito, Texas. Before becoming a sprinter, Morrow played football for San Benito High School. Morrow also was a sprinter at Abilene Christian University, and became a member of the men&#x27;s club Frater Sodalis in 1955.

==Career==
Morrow won the 1955 AAU 100-yard title. His most successful season was in 1956, when he was chosen by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot;. Morrow won the sprint double in the national college championships and defended his AAU title. Morrow then went to the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, where he won three gold medals and was the leader of the American sprint team. First, he was victorious in the 100-meter dash. He then led an American sweep of the medals in the 200-meter dash, while equaling the world record at that distance with a time of 20.6 seconds (unofficially auto-timed at 20.75). He won his third gold by anchoring the 4 × 100-meter relay team to a world record time. He was the first sprinter since Jesse Owens in 1936 to win gold medals in those three events.

Morrow achieved great fame after winning his three gold medals, and was featured on the covers of &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;SPORT&quot;, as well as &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. He appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and &quot;Arthur Godfrey and His Friends&quot;, and addressed a joint session of the Texas legislature.

Morrow&#x27;s success on a national level continued after the Olympics, but he retired in 1958 to become a farmer and a woodworker. He made a short comeback before the 1960 Olympic Games, but failed to qualify for the U.S. Olympic team.

==Legacy==
In October 2006, San Benito High School named its new 12,000 seat sporting facility in San Benito, used for football and soccer, Bobby Morrow Stadium. Morrow was on hand to help dedicate the new facility. He was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1989 and into the Texas Track and Field Coaches Hall of Fame in 2016.

==Personal life==

Morrow was married to Jo Ann Strickland, whom he met in high school, in what was described as a &quot;fairy-tale marriage&quot;. They moved to Odessa, and later to Houston, where he restarted his career in banking that he had put on hold to train for the 1960 Olympics. They divorced around 1968. He subsequently moved to Ohio, where he met and married Judy.

Morrow died of natural causes on May 30, 2020, at his home in Harlingen, Texas, at the age of 84.

Introduced in the 1977 film &quot;Star Wars,&quot; it is the main antagonistic faction of the original trilogy, which also includes &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983). An oppressive dictatorship with a complicated bureaucracy, the Galactic Empire seeks the rule and social control of every planet and civilization within the galaxy, based on anthropocentrism, nationalisation, state terrorism, power projection, and threat of lethal force.

The Galactic Empire&#x27;s rise was not a violent takeover by force, but rather a calculated dismantling of the Galaxy&#x27;s most powerful institutions by rewriting constitutional foundations, controlling the Jedi Council, weakening the Senate and the appointment of loyal Governors. At its peak, the Galactic Empire sprawls over much of the known &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy, which consists of millions of star systems and billions more fringe colonies, shipyards, fortress worlds, and outer territories. The Empire&#x27;s origins are depicted in the prequel film &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005), where it replaces the Galactic Republic at the end of the Clone Wars orchestrated by the Republic&#x27;s Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine. Palpatine is also secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who masterminds the war to destroy the Jedi and restore the Sith to power.

Palpatine falsely accuses the Jedi of causing the secessionist Clone Wars to weaken the Republic and gain power. He manipulates the Galactic Senate into using clone troopers created during the conflict to purge the Jedi. After engineering these threats, Palpatine reorganizes the Republic into a state meant to &quot;ensure the security and continuing stability, and a safe and secure society&quot;: the Galactic Empire, with himself as Emperor. The Senate overwhelmingly supports this decision and lauds his apparent resolve, bravery, and selflessness.

With Emperor Palpatine keeping mostly to the shadows, his Sith apprentice, Darth Vader maintains a more public presence and leads the Imperial forces, acting as a personification of the Galactic Empire&#x27;s power. By the time of &quot;Episode IV – A New Hope&quot;, the faction has transformed into a fully autocratic regime, though it is opposed by the insurgent Rebel Alliance. The completion of the Death Star, a planet-destroying battle station, allows Emperor Palpatine to instigate a self-coup, dissolving the Imperial Senate and transferring power to &quot;Praetor&quot;-officers called Imperial Moffs, such as Grand Moff Tarkin. 

The Galactic Empire collapses after the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi.&quot; Its remnants form the First Order in the sequel trilogy, set 30 years later.

==Themes==
&quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas sought to make the First Galactic Empire aesthetically and thematically similar to Nazi Germany and to appear to be fascist. Similar to Nazi Germany, the Galactic Empire is a dictatorship based on rigid control of society that dissolved a previous democracy and is led by an all-powerful supreme ruler. The Empire, like the Nazis, desires the creation of totalitarian order and utilizes excessive force and violence to achieve their ends. The title of the Empire&#x27;s main soldiers, the stormtroopers, is somewhat similar to the name given to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s (SA, &quot;storm department&quot;) paramilitary bodyguards.

The visual appearance of Darth Vader in his all-black uniform combined with his fanatical obedience to Palpatine has allusion to the black-uniformed Nazi (SS). According to a Lucasfilm-authorized source, Darth Vader&#x27;s relationship with Palpatine is akin to SS leader Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s relationship with Hitler. The uniforms of Imperial military officers also bear resemblance to uniforms used in Nazi Germany, as well as 19th century Polish &quot;ulans&quot; (mounted lancers)—who wore tunics, riding breeches, and boots like the Empire&#x27;s officers wear—as well as the Imperial officers&#x27; cap resembling the field caps historically worn by German and Austrian troops.

In addition to Nazi Germany, there was also at least one portion of the Galactic Empire that was based on the Soviet Union, which is the various military personnel and TIE Fighters that are flying in formation as Palpatine arrives on the second Death Star in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. According to Lucas, the ceremony for the Emperor&#x27;s arrival was inspired by October Revolution Day military parades in the Soviet Union.

Lucas has also indicated that the Galactic Empire&#x27;s struggle against a smaller guerilla force was inspired by the United States&#x27; involvement in the Vietnam War and his surprise at how relatively few people spoke up against the war.

Palpatine&#x27;s rise to power has been related to political strongman of Augustus Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Adolf Hitler. Palpatine&#x27;s consolidation of power and declaring himself emperor is like the Roman political figure Augustus Caesar, in that Augustus manipulated the Roman Senate as Palpatine did with the Galactic Senate; he legitimized authoritarian rule by saying that corruption in the Senate was hampering the powers of the head of state; he pressured the Roman Senate to give him extraordinary powers as Consul of the Republic to deal with a crisis and he falsely claimed that he would rescind those powers once the crisis was over; and, as with the transition of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire, Augustus, like Palpatine, relied on his strong control over military force.

Many Imperial officers speak with the Received Pronunciation accent (known in-universe as Coruscanti), and Irvin Kershner &quot;deliberately cast British actors as the high-rank imperials for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; to mirror the composition of the American revolution, with the rebels mostly Americans&quot;.

==Depiction==
===Origins===
Note: All dates in this article are in the BBY/ABY format. This is a fictional in-universe dating system centred on the Battle of Yavin in &quot;Episode IV: A New Hope&quot; in which the first Death Star is destroyed. BBY is Before the Battle of Yavin; ABY is After the Battle of Yavin.

====The Twilight of the Republic====
The Galactic Empire is born out of the collapsing Galactic Republic; the rise of the empire wasn&#x27;t sudden but instead unfolded gradually, step by step with one power grab after the next. However, its seeds of decadence are planted and nurtured by the Sith over a period of centuries, that bore fruit during the Clone Wars, the epic war between the Republic and the separatist Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) depicted in &quot;Episode II: Attack of the Clones&quot; and &quot;Episode III: Revenge of the Sith&quot;. Palpatine&#x27;s ascension came with the final layer of poison instilled into a governmental system on the brink of collapse. Because of the hubristic Jedi, the corrupt senate and a civil war, Palatine was seen by many as a savior and is easily able to take near-complete control of the Republic.

In &quot;Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot;, amid a trade dispute and invasion of his homeworld of Naboo, Senator Palpatine convinces Queen Padmé Amidala to call for a vote of no confidence in Supreme Chancellor of the Republic Finis Valorum. Palpatine is elected Supreme Chancellor in Valorum&#x27;s place.

====The Clone Wars====

As the Seperatists Crisis fighting intensifies in &quot;Episode II&quot;, the Galactic Senate, the legislature of the Republic, grants Palpatine emergency powers to deal with the crisis. Palpatine promise safety at the cost of individual freedoms, all while tightening his own control over every facet of society; he promises to relinquish his powers once peace and order is restored. His first executive order creates a massive army of clone troopers. His second executive order conscripts the Jedi as commissioned officers of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) armed forces; by seizing influence over the Jedi Council, Palpatine indirectly takes command of the GAR. His third executive order nationalizes the military-industrial and financial sectors to finance the war effort. He intentionally prolongs and exploits the Clone Wars to amass unprecedented political power, using his apprentice Darth Tyranus, Head of State of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, as a pawn to keep everyone distracted and focused on ending the war.

By the time of &quot;Episode III&quot;, he is effectively a dictator who overstayed his term limits; he exploits the people&#x27;s fears, systematically rewrites constitutional laws and crushes the institutions that threaten his goals. He orchestrates his own kidnapping by the Separatists by leaking classified information, and thereby bringing the war to the capital, Coruscant, to further spread terror. The Jedi are overstretched across the galaxy trying the end the war; they distrust Palpatine&#x27;s motives, fearing he has come under the influence of a Dark Lord of the Sith named Darth Sidious. Their concerns are shared by more than 2,000 loyalist, pro-democracy senators who suspect Palpatine may not return his emergency powers once the war ends. These senators set into motion plans that will eventually lead to the creation of the Rebellion. The film reveals that Palpatine and Sidious are one and the same, and Palpatine engineered the conflicts as a false flag.

====The Purge====

Palpatine reveals himself as a Sith Lord to Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, promising to save Padmé, Skywalker&#x27;s secret wife, from dying in childbirth as Anakin has foreseen. Skywalker reports Palpatine&#x27;s true identity to the Jedi. However, when Jedi Master Mace Windu confronts Palpatine, Anakin comes to Palpatine&#x27;s aid and helps him kill Windu. Desperate to save Padmé, Anakin pledges himself to the dark side of the Force and becomes Palpatine&#x27;s third apprentice, Darth Vader. Palpatine declares the Jedi to be traitors, providing &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; that they were the masterminds behind the Clone Wars, and all but exterminates the Jedi Order in a galaxy-wide slaughter, while sending Vader to kill everyone in the Jedi Temple and assassinate the Separatist leaders. Vader then immediately ends the Clone War by transmitting deactivation codes to all Seperatist droids in galaxy.

Two remaining Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, mount a counterattack. Obi-Wan defeats Vader and leaves him for dead, but Yoda&#x27;s duel with Palpatine ends in a stalemate; both Jedi flee into exile. Grievously wounded, Vader is rescued by Palpatine and fitted with cybernetics and a black suit of armor with a life-support system. After Padmé dies giving birth to twins, Yoda and Obi-Wan decide to separate the children – Luke and Leia – to hide them from the Sith. Luke goes to Vader&#x27;s stepfamily on Tatooine, while Leia is adopted by Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan.

====The New Order====
Having &quot;won&quot; the war, with GAR liberators occupying every known star system, Palpatine orders them to annex planets, suppress the sectors and subjugate the people. Secured in his power and position, with no one left to stop him, Palpatine reorganizes the Republic into the Galactic Empire, with himself as Emperor for life. He moves on to his final political opposition, the Senate; rather than dismantling it outright, he reduces it to a powerless symbol that exists only as an illusion of representation, and as a echo chamber for his rhetoric. Senators with no dedication to public service are bribed or coerced into rubberstamping Palpatine&#x27;s policy; the remaining pro-democracy senators are spied upon, arrested, extorted, assassinated, or otherwise made to disappear. Palpatine appoints governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic; these governors, later known as Imperial Moffs, report directly to Palpatine and are appointed without a vote or approval from any senators. This effectively sidelines the Senate, leaving it unable to influence how the Galaxy is governed.

The Old Republic symbolisms are discarded on favor of the Imperial crest, an emblem that comes from the Galactic Roundel symbol of the ancient Bendu monks (predecessors of the Jedi). Originally a symbol of unity and non-confrontation, the wheel is perverted by Palpatine by removing two spokes, echoing Hitler&#x27;s appropriation of the swastika from Hinduism and Buddhism.

===Government===

====Legislature====
The Senate, now known as the Imperial Senate, nominally continues to exist, though it is virtually powerless. Palpatine dissolves the Senate (off-camera) in &quot;A New Hope&quot; after discovering that several members helped found the Rebel Alliance, a guerrilla army dedicated to overthrowing the Empire and restoring the Republic.

====Executive====
With the end of the Clone Wars, the purge of the Jedi Order, and the formation of the First Galactic Empire, Palpatine rules with absolute power as Emperor. Between the events of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; and &quot;A New Hope&quot;, Palpatine rules the galaxy from the confines of his heavily guarded Imperial Palace on Coruscant. Coruscant was introduced in Timothy Zahn&#x27;s then-canon novel &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;. It made its film debut in the special edition of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Inspiration for the world-spanning city came from 1940s science fiction works, especially Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Trantor&quot;. Visually, it resembles the Art Deco skyscrapers of Manhattan.

&quot;Star Wars Battlefront II (2017)&quot; depicts Palpatine as intentionally having no clear line of succession, desiring either immortality or the destruction of the Empire.

===== Imperial Ruling Council =====
Unwilling to embroil himself in the day-to-day running of the Galactic Empire, the Emperor leaves the mundane work to the Imperial Ruling Council (IRC), an advisory body with whom he confers on vital affairs of state. The group is made up of Imperial Advisors, &quot;yes-men&quot; who serve as ministers and counselors. The spokesman of the Imperial Ruling Council is the Grand Vizier Mas Amedda, who attends most of the Imperial Senate&#x27;s sessions. Amedda functions as an intermediary for Palpatine, managing his schedule, screening his calls and contacting other Imperial dignitaries and officers on his behalf. The Imperial Ruling Council also keeps tabs on the progress of the Imperial Military and delivers news from Imperial High Command to the Emperor.

===== Imperial High Command =====
The Emperor leaves the actual martial management to Imperial High Command (IHC), a central command structure that notably coordinates the Galactic Empire&#x27;s war effort. The cabinet enjoys much power within the government&#x27;s hierarchy, being responsible for: sanctioning weapons programs (such as the TIE Defender project), supervising the armed forces, forming strategies and organizing expansionary or pacification campaigns. Despite this, Imperial High Command was unable to take any serious action against Rebel sympathizers with allies in the Imperial Senate. The group works closely with the Council of Moffs and notifies the Imperial Ruling Council on important developments. Imperial High Command&#x27;s overseer is Darth Vader - also a Sith Lord - who relentlessly pursues the fledging Rebel Alliance, in addition to quelling insurgencies and purging the last of the Jedi Order. As Emperor Palpatine&#x27;s second-in-command, Vader is treated with almost the same deference as his master and has his personal battalion and armada- the 501st Legion and &quot;Death Squadron&quot;, respectively - at his beck and call. 

Imperial High Command maintained a number of subdivisions, each charged with directing the naval, ground and intelligence assets of the Imperial Military. The most important of these were the Joint Chiefs, an executive group of senior officers who advised both the Emperor and the Commander-in-Chief on all martial-related matters. Other members included the Grand Admirals, a cadre of the 12 highest-ranking naval officers that helmed large Imperial fleets and policed Imperial Space; Grand Admiral Thrawn, the commander of the 7th Fleet, is the most famous of their number.

===== Council of Moffs =====
Aside from the Imperial Ruling Council and Imperial High Command, power resides in the hands of &quot;&quot;Praetorian&quot; administrators&quot; (planetary governors) that form the Council of Moffs. The cabinet is composed of 20 Moffs (sector governors) and their superiors, the &quot;Grand Moffs&quot; (oversector governors), all of whom answer directly to the Emperor. The Moffs are senior officials who held the governorship over Administrators of minor provinces and commanded a Sector Fleet-size imperial armed forces at the sector level. The Grand Moffs are among the Galactic Empire&#x27;s top figures, being on equal-footing with the Grand Vizier and the Commander-in-Chief and having been similarly appointed by the Emperor himself. The Council of Moffs works closely with Imperial High Command and is therefore able to dispose of the Imperial Military&#x27;s assets to enforce the Emperor&#x27;s authority in its &quot;provinces&quot;. Governor Wilhuff Tarkin is the most prominent Grand Moff, having suggested the creation of the role and thus holds the distinction of being the first.

====Judiciary====
In the series &quot;Andor&quot;, the Galactic Empire is depicted as arbitrary and cruel in its rule over ordinary people, particularly when it comes to certain agencies such as the Imperial Security Bureau (ISB), which acts as a secret police force. In the latter part of the series, the autocracy takes to retroactively extending the sentences of prisoners, moving prisoners around to different facilities after they are due to be released, euthanizing labor camp prisoners when they become too ill to work, not permitting defendants in criminal cases to present a defense, and committing mass murder when its officers feel they are losing control of a situation. It also engages in torture of subjects of interest and carries out arbitrary executions for political purposes. ISB agents are assigned to spy on political dissidents in the Imperial Senate, such as Senator Mon Mothma.

=====Imperial Security Bureau=====
The Imperial Security Bureau (ISB) is the politically aligned and indoctrinated civilian intelligence branch of the Galactic Empire that is charged with matters of internal state security and law enforcement, being analogous to the Gestapo or the Schutzstaffel, as well as the KGB. The ISB was not a national agency, but a part of COMPOR (&quot;Commission for the Preservation of the New Order&quot;); Palpatine&#x27;s own political party. Because the ISB is so directly connected and fanatically loyal to Palpatine, there are no checks and balances to their power as they did whatever Palatine wanted them to do.

Consisting of several supervisors overseeing multiple sectors, they are charged with matters of counter-terrorism, criminal investigation, internal affairs, state security, state-sponsored propaganda and ensuring the political loyalty of citizens to the Galactic Empire. Each supervisor had at least one ISB attendant assigned to them that helped them do their duties. Veteran Colonel Wullf Yularen acts as ISB&#x27;s main figurehead and spokesman, answering to the likes of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader and Amedda.

Towards the end of the Galactic Empire&#x27;s reign after the death of Emperor Palpatine, ISB officers were entrusted with carrying out Operation Cinder. When that operation fails and the empire collapses, some former ISB officers, such as Moff Gideon, become warlords and part of the Imperial remnants.

=====Inquisitorius=====

Outside the formal chain of command, the Galactic Empire&#x27;s reins are &quot;de facto&quot; held by the Sith, a cult of Force-wielders - called Sith Lords - that call on the dark side in their plot to dominate the galaxy and destroy the Jedi. Both Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader are part of this cult, although this is known to or guessed by only a very few figures in the regime&#x27;s upper echelons, such as Governor Tarkin. The Imperial Inquisition, or Inquisitorius, acts as an extension of the Sith Order and its Force-attuned operatives, the Inquisitors, are routinely given control of Imperial Military assets to hunt down the Jedi Knights that survived the initial purge. The Inquisitors&#x27; lack of proper rank within the armed forces, as well as their reliance on &quot;occult&quot; ways, earn the ire of the standard officers. The Inquisitorius was founded by the Emperor and is governed by the Commander-in-Chief, but the agency is virtually led by a Grand Inquisitor who defers to both.

===Military===
====Notable officers====
*Darth Vader - Dark Lord of the Sith, thus Palpatine&#x27;s second-in-command, until his death in the Battle of Endor.
*Mas Amedda – Grand Vizier of the Imperial Ruling Council and Vice-Chair of the Imperial Senate, later installed by Gallius Rax as puppet leader following Palpatine&#x27;s death in &quot;&quot;. Amedda formally surrenders the Galactic Empire to the New Republic in &quot;&quot;.
*Wilhuff Tarkin – Grand Moff of the Oversector Outer and commander of the Death Star, until his death in the Battle of Yavin.
*Thrawn – Grand Admiral of the 7th Fleet of the Imperial Navy, until being MIA upon his defeat in the liberation of Lothal.
*Orson Krennic – Head of Imperial Weapons Division and director of the Death Star, until his death in the Battle of Scarif. Krennic was also the Head of Advanced Weapons research.

====Tarkin Doctrine====
In &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the Tarkin Doctrine was the plan presented by Tarkin himself to Palpatine in 18 BBY that outlined the Empire&#x27;s goal and structure: bringing order to the galaxy and restoring rule of law to sectors overtaken by piracy and organized crime, ending destructive conflicts through grand strategy and military doctrine, a plan for maximizing social control and propaganda, maintaining economic order and increasing security in the Galactic Empire. Tarkin believed the chief factor that contributed most to the demise of the Republic was not, in fact, the war, but rampant self-interest, which left the body politic feckless and corrupt.

The plan which Palpatine ultimately had implemented in its entirety contained three main principles: territorial consolidation, rapid communication, and coercive diplomacy. Tarkin&#x27;s concept was that rule could be established and maintained &quot;through fear of force rather than force itself&quot;, and he believed grand displays of power—when combined with oppressive means of terrorizing communities—could suppress dissent and crush any would-be rebellion. This Doctrine became the Empire&#x27;s core military doctrine of peacekeeping, internal security, counter-insurgency, and state terrorism-philosophy. The instrument of this power is the military, which includes the Imperial stormtroopers, a massive fleet of about 1,000 Star Destroyers, a couple of Super Star Destroyers, and the Death Star, a moon-sized superweapon capable of destroying entire planets.

Plans for the Death Star first appear (in universe chronology) in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; and construction begins at the end of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. Summarized measures set forth by the Tarkin Doctrine:
*Establish &quot;Oversectors&quot; which contain tumultuous systems; to monitor and react to rebellious activities within those systems. Oversectors would be formed without regard for the borders of standard sectors and would receive more forces than other regions of the Empire. This Imperial presence would be designed to stop small rebel factions before they could become a larger established threat. An average of three Sector Groups would be deployed in an Oversector.
*Assign command of each Oversector to a single individual who reports directly to the Emperor, in order to eliminate any delays created by political opportunism by Imperial advisors.
*Improve communication resources and Imperial response time by placing modified HoloNet transceivers (cannibalized from existing HoloNet transceivers) aboard each flagship of every Sector Group within an Oversector command. Place similar facilities aboard the Emperor&#x27;s flagship and in Imperial City on Imperial Centre (formally Coruscant).
*Control unruly portions of the Galaxy through a fear of force rather than force itself. Through the combination of superior coordination of multiple Oversector groups and the control of information (news media) an impression of overwhelming force will be installed within the citizenry, thereby instilling the idea that resistance is futile.
*Continue to research and develop new and more powerful starships and weapons designed to inspire fear in the resistant systems. Present the citizen with a weapon so powerful, so immense as to defy all conceivable attack against it, a weapon invulnerable and invincible in battle, that shall become a symbol for the Empire. This weapon must possess a power great enough to dispatch an entire system. Only a handful or one of these weapons would be required to accomplish this task.

====Imperial Navy====

The Imperial Naval Command (INC), also referred to as the Imperial Starfleet, is the foremost military arm of the Galactic Empire in charge of maintaining security, peace and order in the galaxy. Led by Darth Vader, it absorbed the military forces of the Galactic Republic after Emperor Palpatine&#x27;s declaration of the New Order.

At its peak, the Imperial Navy fields millions of warships, including an estimated 25,000 Star Destroyers, fulfilling the Emperor&#x27;s will throughout the galaxy. The Empire&#x27;s central warship cadre is well structured and uniformed, but the Imperial Navy suffers against strike craft, largely due to the inadequacies of its own starfighters and point defense. The Empire&#x27;s focus on size, firepower, and terror comes at the expense of a well-balanced fleet. After its defeat at the Battle of Endor, the Galactic Empire splits up into warring factions, and the Imperial Starfleet along with it. While much of the remnants of the Imperial Navy are later reunited under impressive Imperial commanders, the military organization ceases to exist shortly after the death of the Emperor.

Specific responsibilities of the Imperial Navy include defending Imperial citizens from space-based threats (such as pirates, smugglers and rebel contingents), enforcing Imperial will, and overseeing commerce through customs and blockade operations. The Imperial Navy also performs orbital bombardments and transports major ground force deployments, supporting them with space, orbital, and aerial support. Imperial Navy officers wear the same standard uniform that their Army counterparts use but is colored grey, and both services use colored chest plaques to denote rank.

=====Imperial Starfighter Corps=====

The Imperial Starfighter Corps (ISC) was the starfighter pilot branch of the Galactic Empire. Although the Corps was a component of the Navy, most pilots were assigned to ground operations with the Imperial Army. Imperial starfighters include TIE (Twin Ion Engine) fighters, TIE interceptors, TIE Defenders, TIE Brutes, TIE strikers, and TIE bombers. The Corps were scattered after the Battle of Endor (4 ABY).

====Imperial Army====
The Imperial Army was the ground based force. Imperial Army enlisted soldiers wore gray uniforms with a mandarin collar and four pockets along with chest pieces similar to Stormtroopers but in black. Corporals displayed their rank on one of their shoulder pauldrons with a single white diagonal stripe. They also wore a gray Imperial kepi or Imperial Combat Helmet

=====Imperial Stormtrooper Corps=====

Imperial Stormtrooper Corps (ISC) are elite corps of rapid response all-environment shock troops—organized like the U.S. Marine Corps with their own separate divisions. The Stormtroopers operate in conjunction with the Army Ground Troopers and Navy Marine Troopers—who were used as garrison forces—to reinforce and hold defensive positions until the regular military arrived. When not in their signature white armor, stormtrooper officers wear black uniforms.

===Galactic Civil War===
After the formation of the Empire and the purge of the Jedi, Palpatine declares martial law throughout the galaxy. Those in hiding, or attempting to either flee from or oppose the New Imperial Order, are subject to persecution or death. This is the start of the bloody decades-long Galactic Civil War fought between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance.

As portrayed in the live-action series &quot;Andor&quot;, one single moment in Galactic history completely changed the Empire&#x27;s policy towards its citizens and therefore changed its relationship with its citizens. In 5 BBY, on the relatively unremarkable planet of Aldhani, a small Rebel team managed to infiltrate the local Imperial depository, stealing a decent portion of the sector payroll. This created a massive Imperial overreaction, increasing their security spending and draconian law enforcement policies, making all future rebellious activity even more costly and difficult, which is exactly what the mastermind of this heist Luthen Rael wanted.

As portrayed in the animated series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; and &quot;The Bad Batch&quot;, the Empire explores ways to weaponize Force-sensitive kyber crystals, which are sacred to the Jedi and are at the core of every lightsaber. They mine for kyber crystals across worlds, but are thwarted twice in securing massive crystals by the &quot;Ghost&quot; crew and Saw Gerrera. On Jedha, however, the Empire uncovers a surplus of kyber, with which they power the Death Star.

The Death Star, a moon-sized battle station with sufficient firepower to destroy an entire planet, is designed to be the ultimate weapon of the Empire&#x27;s power. The threat of this weapon provoked a desperate suicidal raid, The Battle Of Scariff, by the Rebel Alliance. The engagement and loss of the classified Death Star blueprint plans was to seen as a complete embarrassment for the Imperial forces along with a loss of two Star Destroyers and the destruction of Scarff base.

Tarkin, the station&#x27;s commander, demonstrates that power in &quot;A New Hope&quot; when he destroys Alderaan as a show of force. In the film&#x27;s climactic scene, however, the station is attacked by Rebel starfighters who have come into possession of the station&#x27;s blueprints. The battle ends with the Death Star&#x27;s destruction at the hands of Luke Skywalker, which is the Rebel Alliance&#x27;s first major military success against the Empire. Politically, Alderann&#x27;s destruction was a watershed moment for most Imperial Loyalists, many whom would later defect to the Alliance; it revealed the Empire&#x27;s willingness to kill loyalists on Alderaan, along with millions of innocents, just to prove a point to a rebellious Senator. Tarkin&#x27;s Doctine, meant to perpetually &quot;tighten the noose&quot; and instill fear of being killed for engaging in Rebellion, eventually get overridden by people realizing that no one was actually safe.

After the &quot;Battle of Yavin&quot;, Vader&#x27;s special powers as Commander-in-Chief are increased by Palpatine, granting him full command over all other officials and officers to ease his campaign against the Rebellion. In &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Vader becomes obsessed with finding the Force-sensitive Luke and leads his stormtroopers to attack on the Rebel base on Hoth, but the Rebels escape. Vader would continue to systematically and ruthlessly dismantle Alliance assets, and to hunt for Luke in the process, forcing Alliance survivors to abandon all static bases and regroup with Alliance HQ and remain nomadic. 

In &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, after four years of conflict and near constant harassments by Vader&#x27;s forces, the Alliance achieves a decisive victory over the Empire during the &quot;Battle of Endor&quot;. In the film&#x27;s climactic battle, the Rebellion destroys the second Death Star and a number of capital ships that contain a great portion of the Imperial Navy&#x27;s highest-ranking officers. During this battle, Vader redeems himself by sacrificing his life to kill Palpatine in order to save his son, Luke Skywalker.

The dual loss of the Emperor and his right-hand, the Commander-in-Chief, creates a power vacuum of chaos and instability. By design, the Empire had no clear line of succession; and there was no next-in-line after Palpatine and Vader. Revolts, infighting, fiefdoms and warlordism gradually fracture the Empire apart more effectively than any damage capable of being inflicted by the Rebel Alliance, as the Moffs and Grand Moffs maneuver to grab power for themselves amidst civil unrest.

Palpatine left posthumous orders. Upon verification of his death, messenger droids are sent to select Imperial officers to relay his last orders: to begin &quot;Operation: Cinder&quot;, a scorched earth policy tasking hardline Imperials to destroy entire planets so the Rebellion cannot claim them. The fallen Emperor does not desire the Empire to continue without his presence; if he cannot live forever as the galaxy&#x27;s Emperor, he would rather see it destroyed.

A year after the Battle of Endor, the bolstered Rebellion defeats the weakened Empire during the Battle of Jakku and formally establishes the New Republic.

===New Republic Era===

By the time of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, set five years after the Battle of Endor, the Galactic Empire no longer exists as an official government or a major power and is essentially a failed state. Its former leaders who are now warlords that represent several different rump states, are competing with each other, as well as the New Republic over the power vacuum left behind. One Imperial remnant established a base on the planet Nevarro, where Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin was hired to acquire an asset, later revealed to be a Force-sensitive infant named Grogu. Djarin abandoned his job and decided to protect the child, making him an enemy of the Imperial warlord Moff Gideon and his army of mercenary stormtroopers.

Djarin later returned to Nevarro, reuniting with his allies Greef Karga and Cara Dune, as well as an unnamed Mythrol, to take down an Imperial facility to eradicate the Empire&#x27;s presence on the planet. The group soon discovered that it was housing Imperial experiments, using blood rich in midichlorians obtained from Grogu. The group succeeded in taking down the base. Gideon was informed of the developments while overseeing a unit of enhanced droids known as darktroopers, who would later help him capture Grogu. Djarin led a mission to rescue Grogu, assisted by several allies including Dune, Boba Fett, Fennec Shand, and Mandalorian warrior Bo-Katan Kryze. The group boarded Gideon&#x27;s command ship and subdued him. Djarin turned Grogu over to Luke Skywalker, who took down the Moff&#x27;s darktroopers.

===Successor===
The most successful remnants of the Empire reformed as the First Order, led by Supreme Leader Snoke and former Imperial officers. They become a major faction in the galaxy in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; and face a reformed Rebel Alliance called the Resistance. The First Order rises to power through the use of Starkiller Base, a planet-converted superweapon that later destroys the Hosnian system, the location of the New Republic&#x27;s capital. Starkiller Base is destroyed by the Resistance in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;. In the sequel &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;, however, First Order forces draw the Resistance out of hiding and wipe out a majority of their fleet. During the battle, Snoke is killed by his apprentice Kylo Ren, who assumes the title of Supreme Leader.

In &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, the final film in the sequel trilogy, the First Order allies itself with the Sith Eternal, a cult led by Palpatine, who had transferred his essence into a cloned body and formerly positioned himself to control the First Order over Snoke, a puppet ruler. The cult is stationed on the isolated Sith planet of Exegol. Palpatine offers Ren, who had tracked him to the planet, control of the Sith Eternal&#x27;s fleet, the Final Order, in exchange for killing the young Jedi Rey, Palpatine&#x27;s own granddaughter. Ren initially accepts the assignment, but later forsakes the dark side after a duel with Rey in the wreckage of the second Death Star. With Ren&#x27;s defection, Palpatine turns command over to Allegiant General Enric Pryde, previously an Imperial officer.

With help from the spirit of Luke Skywalker, Rey eventually makes her way to Exegol, guiding the Resistance away to the planet to take down the Sith Eternal forces, including the Sith fleet. With help from a redeemed Ren and the spirits of Jedi past, she resists Palpatine&#x27;s promises of power and turns his own Force lightning against him, destroying the Sith Lord once and for all. The Resistance, with help from their allies across the galaxy, destroys the remaining Sith forces and prevents an establishment of a new Sith Empire. Without reinforcements of the Sith, people across the galaxy rises up against the First Order.

===&quot;Legends&quot;===

With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe material was rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise on April 25, 2014.

====&quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy====
In Timothy Zahn&#x27;s &quot;Thrawn trilogy&quot; of novels – &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; (1991), &quot;Dark Force Rising&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Last Command&quot; (1993) – an army of former Imperials, led by Grand Admiral Thrawn, attempt to overthrow the New Republic and install a dictatorship known as the Empire of the Hand. The backstory of the series explains that following their defeat at the Battle of Endor, the galactic sectors that are still under Imperial control are now governed by several different military juntas that fight each other in a conflict known as the Imperial Civil War, all the while resuming the Galactic Civil War with the Rebellion&#x27;s successor, the New Republic, for control of the galaxy for years until mostly uniting under Grand Admiral Thrawn. By the time of &quot;The Last Command&quot;, Thrawn has nearly defeated the New Republic, but they claim victory in a last-ditch effort, and Thrawn is killed by his bodyguard, shattering the Empire&#x27;s unity.

====&quot;Agent of the Empire&quot;====

&quot;Agent of the Empire&quot; is a 10-issue comic book series published by Dark Horse Comics from 2011 to 2013. It was written by John Ostrander and illustrated by Stephane Roux, and is set three years before the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. Two five-issue story arcs follow an Imperial secret agent, and feature characters such as Han Solo, Princess Leia and Boba Fett. Both arcs were collected in trade paperback volumes.

====&quot;Jedi Prince&quot;====
In the &quot;Jedi Prince&quot; novel series, a group of impostors calling themselves the Prophets of the Dark Side install a three-eyed mutant named Trioculus as Emperor by claiming that he is Palpatine&#x27;s son, reforming the Empire (as Trioculus&#x27;s Empire). By the end of the series, Palpatine&#x27;s true son, Triclops, helps the New Republic defeat this new enemy.

====&quot;Dark Empire&quot;====
In the &quot;Dark Empire&quot; comic book series, Palpatine is reborn in a clone body and unites most of the scattered remnants of the Empire (forming the Dark Empire), hoping to retake control of the galaxy. By the sequel, &quot;Empire&#x27;s End&quot;, he is defeated and destroyed once and for all. Following the final death of Palpatine, Luke Skywalker, influenced by the force ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi, starts the New Jedi Order in an ancient temple on Yavin 4, which had undone the Emperor&#x27;s purge of the Old Jedi Order 28 years earlier at the rise of the Galactic Empire.

====&quot;Jedi Academy&quot; trilogy====
In the &quot;Jedi Academy&quot; trilogy, an Imperial admiral named Daala commandeers the remainder of the Imperial Navy (the Crimson Empire) and mounts a ferocious assault on the New Republic. She nearly succeeds in taking over the galaxy, but is foiled by New Republic pilots Wedge Antilles and Lando Calrissian in the final entry, &quot;Champions of the Force&quot;. A year later she would arrange the assassination of the rival Imperial warlords to unify the feuding Imperial factions into the Imperial Remnant and bring an end to the Imperial Civil War.

====&quot;Darksaber&quot;====
In the 1995 novel &quot;Darksaber&quot;, Daala, frustrated with the Imperial warlords in the Core fighting and bickering amongst themselves, orchestrates the warlords&#x27; deaths and unites and becomes the leader of the remaining Imperial forces. After being defeated in battle once again by the New Republic, she resigns and selects Gilad Pellaeon (originally in the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy) as the new leader, where he becomes Grand Admiral Pellaeon. At the end of the novel, he signs a peace treaty with the New Republic representative Ponc Gavrisom and finally ends the Galactic Civil War.

====&quot;New Jedi Order&quot;====
By the time of the &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; series, the remaining Imperial military factions sign a truce with the New Republic, becoming the Imperial Remnant. The former enemies then become allies against the invading Yuuzhan Vong. A few years later, the Remnant help the Galactic Alliance fight an assimilating insect species known as the Killiks, which become a third party in the Second Galactic Civil War. Eventually, they make peace with the Alliance and Confederation. All three of these are represented by former Imperial commanders.

====&quot;Legacy&quot;====
The &quot;Star Wars: Legacy&quot; comic book series, set 127 years after the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, explains that, during a civil war, the New Galactic Empire known as the Fel Empire declares war on the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances (Galactic Alliance), the successor state of the New Republic, after 83 years of a cold war that began in 44 ABY. This conflict begins the Sith-Imperial War, which after three years leads to the eventual defeat of the Galactic Alliance and the Galactic Empire asserting its domination over the galaxy once again in 130 ABY. A few months later, the Sith overthrows the Fel Empire. The Sith Lord Darth Krayt, the leader of the One Sith, usurps the throne and forces Emperor Roan Fel to take refuge in the fortress planet of Bastion.

In 138 ABY, the Galactic Alliance Remnant led by Admiral Gar Stazi, Fel&#x27;s forces known as the Empire-in-exile led by Empress Marasiah Fel, and the New Jedi Order led by Jedi Master K&#x27;Krukk unite against Krayt&#x27;s empire and eventually destroy it in the Battle of Coruscant, after a grand total of 157 years of its existence. The three united factions form a new galactic government called the Galactic Federation Triumvirate.

The One Sith, led by Darth Wredd, remains at large and wages a war against the GFT. One year later, the former Empire-in-exile works with the other two factions, killing Wredd, rounding up all surviving members including their new leader Darth Nihl, and permanently dissolving the One Sith and the Sith religion itself for good. The next year, the GFT defeats the secular alliances of the One Sith and in the aftermath of that conflict, the galaxy after 172 years of Palpatine&#x27;s influence, enters an era of peace and unity for the first time since before the Clone Wars.

<text>The Gran Valira () is the largest river in Andorra. It flows through the capital, Andorra la Vella, and exits the country in the south near the Spain–Andorra road border crossing.

The Gran Valira is a tributary to the Segre, which in turn is a tributary to the Ebro. It flows into the Segre in La Seu d&#x27;Urgell. Its main tributaries are the Valira d&#x27;Orient, the Valira del Nord and the Madriu. The Valira river system is long.

The map service of the Andorran government calls it the Gran Valira. In certain sources, especially those with a Spanish influence such as maps published in Spain, it is sometimes referred to as the Valira because in the territory of Spain there is only one Valira river. In Andorra, however, there are several different Valiras and hence there is a need to distinguish between them.

<text>White Ruthenia (; ; ; ) is one of the historical divisions of Kievan Rus&#x27; according to the color scheme, which also includes Black and Red Ruthenia. In the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern period, the name White Ruthenia was characterized by instability, designating a number of different regions on the territory of modern Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. It is recorded mainly in Western European sources, starting from the middle of the 13th century.

== History ==
Vasily Tatishchev believed that for the first time the term &quot;White Rus&#x27;&quot; is found in the Rostov chronicles in the year 1135, where the lands of Rostov-Suzdal Principality were mentioned. Referring to the publications of the Pole Maciej Stryjkowski, Persian and other Eastern peoples who called the Russian princes &quot;ak-padishah&quot;(white tsar), and the state &quot;Ak-Urus&quot; (White Rus), the historian in his narrative extends this name to all Vladimir-Rostov princes, starting with Yuri Dolgorukiy, and Andrei Bogolyubsky. He also calls the lands controlled by them &quot;White Rus&#x27;&quot;, and calls the princes &quot;White Russians&quot; or &quot;grand dukes of White Russia&quot;.

The praiseworthy songs composed in the second half of the 14th century by the Austrian poet Peter Suchenwirt tell how in 1349, in the battle of Izborsk (&quot;Eysenburk&quot; in the poem), German knights faced &quot;Weizzen Reuzzen&quot; (&quot;White Russians&quot;). However, it is known that it was a squad of Pskov and Izborsk people, led by Georgy Viktorovich, voivode of the Grand Duke of Lithuania Algirdas.

On the world Fra Mauro map (1459), the territory of Novgorod-Moscow Rus&#x27; between Volga and White Sea is called White Russia (Rossia Biancha). This map gives the following explanation:

Many other variations of this name appeared on ancient maps; for instance, &quot;Russia Alba, Russija Alba, Wit Rusland, Weiß Reußen (Weißreußen), White Russia, Hviterussland, Hvíta Rússland, Weiß Russland (Weißrussland), Ruthenia Alba, Ruthénie Blanche&quot; and &quot;Weiß Ruthenien&quot; &quot;(Weißruthenien)&quot;. The name was also assigned to various territories, often quite distant from that of present Belarus.

According to Alfred Nicolas Rambaud:The name of &quot;White () Russia&quot; is given to the provinces conquered from the 13th to the 14th century by the Grand Dukes of Lithuania. These were the ancient territories of the Krivitches, Polotchans, Dregovitches, Drevlians, Doulebes, now forming the governments of Vitepsk, Mohilef, and Minsk. The Lithuanian territories of Grodno, Novogrodek and Belostok were sometimes called Black Russia.

An ethno-religious theory suggests that the name used to describe the part of old Ruthenian lands within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania that had been populated mostly by Slavs who had been Christianized early, as opposed to Black Ruthenia, which was predominantly inhabited by pagan Balts.

As stated by historian Andrej Kotljarchuk, the first person who called himself &quot;Belarusian&quot; was Calvinist writer Salomon Rysinski (Solomo Pantherus Leucorussus, ca 1569-1626). According to his words, he was born &quot;in richly endowed with forests and animals Ruthenia near the border to frigid Muscovy&quot; and doctorated at the University of Altdorf.

On the 1712 map of French cartographer Henri Chatelain &quot;Russie noire&quot; (Black Ruthenia) is placed in region of Eastern Galicia (today Western Ukraine), which traditionally known as &quot;Russie rouge&quot; (Red Ruthenia).

Vasmer&#x27;s dictionary mentions the dichotomy of &quot;white&quot; land and &quot;taxed&quot; land in Domostroy and speculates that &quot;white&quot; Rus&#x27; may have referred to the parts of Kievan Rus&#x27; that were not conquered by Golden Horde. Another speculation in Vasmer is that the color of the clothes of the White Ruthenians (perhaps as well as the color of their hair) may have contributed to the name. Oleg Trubachyov calls both theories &quot;complete fantasies&quot;.

Also, the 16th century chronicler Alexander Guagnini&#x27;s book &quot;Sarmatiae Europeae descriptio&quot; wrote that Rus&#x27; was divided in three parts. The first part, under the rule of the Muscovite Grand Duke, was called &quot;White Ruthenia&quot;. The second one, under the rule of Polish king, was called &quot;Black Ruthenia&quot;. And the rest was &quot;Red Ruthenia&quot;. He also said Moscow was the center of White Rus&#x27; and the Russian metropolitanate, and that the Grand Duke of Moscow was called the &quot;White Czar&quot;, especially by his subjects.

According to the late 19th-century &quot;Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland&quot;, White Ruthenia (Ruś Biała) constituted the Minsk, Mścisław, Połock, Smolensk and Witebsk voivodeships of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (before the Partitions of Poland), or the Mogilev Governorate, eastern parts of the Minsk and Vitebsk Governorates, the western half of the Smolensk Governorate, and the northern part of the Chernihiv Governorate, i.e. the central, northern and eastern parts of modern Belarus, and the western outskirts of modern Russia with Smolensk and Starodub. The largest cities in the region so defined today are Minsk, Gomel, Vitebsk, Mogilev, Smolensk and Babruysk.
