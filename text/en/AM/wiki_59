<text>The Kuvasz is a Hungarian breed of flock guardian dog. Mention of the breed can be found in old Hungarian texts. They have historically been royal guard dogs, or guarded livestock, but have been increasingly found in homes as pets over the last seventy years. The American Kennel Club includes the breed in the working dog group.

== History ==

During the Migration Period and later Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin, numerous nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes moved into the area that is now Hungary. The Principality of Hungary was founded in 895 or 896 AD. The Magyars probably brought sheep and dogs with them, and established a pastoral culture in the Hungarian plains.

In the fifteenth century Matthias Corvinus is believed to have kept large numbers of Kuvasz dogs at his court as guard dogs or hunting dogs, or sometimes as war dogs.

Selective breeding of the Kuvasz as a breed began in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and a breed standard was drawn up. In 1934 it was accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, which lists the date of full acceptance as 1954.

By the end of World War II, nearly all the Kuvasz dogs in Hungary had been killed. The dogs had such a reputation for protecting their families that they were actively sought and killed by German and Soviet soldiers, while at the same time some German officers used to take Kuvasz dogs home with them. After the Soviet invasion and the end of the war, the breed was nearly extinct in Hungary. After the war, it was revealed that fewer than thirty Kuvasz were left in Hungary and some sources indicate the number may have been as few as twelve. Since then, due to many dedicated breeders, Kuvasz breed have repopulated Hungary. However, as a result of this near extinction, the genetic pool available to breeders was severely restricted and there is conjecture that some may have used other breeds, such as the Great Pyrenees, to continue their programs.

In Romania, a breed-specific legislation specifies that Kuvasz must be muzzled when in public places.

== Characteristics ==

The Kuvasz is a large and powerful dog: dogs stand some at the withers, with weights in the range ; bitches may stand and weigh .

The coat is white or ivory-white; it is thick and coarse, with a soft undercoat. The skin is slate-grey; the tip of the nose, the lips and the rims of the eyes are black, and the pads of the paws are black or slate-grey.

The head is wedge-shaped; the muzzle is slightly less than half the full length of the head, and the is slight. The eyes are almond-shaped, dark brown, and slightly slanted.

Although generally a healthy and robust breed which can be expected to live approximately 12–14 years, the Kuvasz is prone to developmental bone problems.

<doc id="70390" wikidata="Q109860" url="?curid=70390" title="Dagobert I">
<text>Dagobert I (; 603/605 – 19 January 639) was King of the Franks. He ruled Austrasia (623–634) and Neustria and Burgundy (629–639). He has been described as the last king of the Merovingian dynasty to wield real royal power, after which the Mayor of the palace rose as the political and war leader. Dagobert was the first Frankish king to be buried in the royal tombs at the Basilica of Saint-Denis.

==Rule in Austrasia==
Dagobert was the eldest son of Chlothar II and Haldetrude (575–604) and the grandson of Fredegund. Chlothar had reigned alone over all the Franks since 613. In 622, Chlothar made Dagobert king of Austrasia, almost certainly to bind the Austrasian nobility to the ruling Franks. As a child, Dagobert lived under the care of the Carolingian dynasty forebears and Austrasian magnates, Arnulf of Metz and Pepin of Landen.

Chlothar attempted to manage the unstable alliances he had with other noble families throughout much of Dagobert&#x27;s reign. When Chlothar granted Austrasia to Dagobert, he initially excluded Alsace, the Vosges, and the Ardennes, but shortly thereafter the Austrasian nobility forced him to concede these regions to Dagobert. The rule of a Frank from the Austrasian heartland tied Alsace more closely to the Austrasian court. Dagobert created a new duchy (the later Duchy of Alsace) in southwest Austrasia to guard the region from Burgundian or Alemannic encroachments and ambitions. The duchy comprised the Vosges, the Burgundian Gate, and the Transjura. Dagobert made his courtier Gundoin—who incidentally established monasteries in Alsace and Burgundy—the first duke of this new polity that was to last until the end of the Merovingian dynasty. While Austrasian rulers such as Chlothar and Dagobert controlled these regions through part of the seventh-century, they eventually became autonomous kingdoms as powerful aristocratic families sought separate paths across their respective realms.

==United rule==
Upon the death of his father in 629, Dagobert inherited the Neustrian and Burgundian kingdoms. His half-brother Charibert, son of Sichilde, claimed Neustria but Dagobert opposed him. Brodulf, brother of Sichilde, petitioned Dagobert on behalf of his young nephew, but Dagobert assassinated him and became sole king of the Franks. He later gave the Aquitaine to Charibert as a &quot;consolation prize.&quot; In 629, Dagobert concluded a treaty with the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, which entailed enforcing the compulsory baptism of Jews throughout his kingdom. Besides signing this treaty, Dagobert also took steps to secure trade across his empire by protecting important markets along the mouth of the Rhine at Duurstede and Utrecht, which in part explains his later determination to defend the Austrasian Franks from the Avar menace.

Under the rule of Dagobert&#x27;s father and like-minded Merovingians, Frankish society during the seventh-century experienced greater integration—the Catholic faith became predominant for instance—and a generally improved economic situation, but there was no initial impetus for the political unification of Gaul. Clothar II did not seek to force his Neustrian neighbors into submission, choosing instead a policy of cooperation. This did not prohibit plunder-raids to replenish the dynastic coffers, which Dagobert undertook in Spain for example—one raid there earned him 200,000 gold &quot;solidi&quot;. Historian Ian Wood claims that Dagobert &quot;was probably richer than most Merovingian monarchs&quot; and cites for example his assistance to the Visigoth Sisenand—whom he aided in his rise to the Visigothic throne in Spain—and for which, Sisenand awarded Dagobert a golden dish weighing some .

When Charibert and his son Chilperic were assassinated in 632, Dagobert had Burgundy and Aquitaine firmly under his rule, becoming the most powerful Merovingian king in many years and the most respected ruler in the West. In 631, Dagobert led a large army against Samo, the ruler of the Slavic Wends, partly at the request of the Germanic peoples living in the eastern territories and also due to Dagobert&#x27;s quarrel with him about the Wends having robbed and killed a number of Frankish merchants. While Dagobert&#x27;s Austrasian forces were defeated at the Wogastisburg, his Alemannic and Lombard allies were successful in repelling the Wends. Taking advantage of the situation at the time, the Saxons offered to help Dagobert if he agreed to rescind the 500 cow yearly tribute to the Austrasians. Despite accepting this agreement, Fredegar reports that it was to little avail since the Wends attacked again the following year.

==Rule in Neustria, from Paris==
Also in 632, the nobles of Austrasia revolted under the mayor of the palace, Pepin of Landen. In 634, Dagobert appeased the rebellious nobles by putting his three-year-old son, Sigebert III, on the throne, thereby ceding royal power in the easternmost of his realms, just as his father had done for him eleven years earlier. In historian Ian Wood&#x27;s view, Dagobert&#x27;s creation of a sub-kingdom for his son Sigibert had &quot;important long-term implications for the general structure of Merovingian Francia.&quot;
As king, Dagobert made Paris his capital. During his reign, he built the Altes Schloss in Meersburg (in modern Germany), which today is the oldest inhabited castle in that country. Devoutly religious, Dagobert was also responsible for the construction of the Saint Denis Basilica at the site of a Benedictine monastery in Paris. He also appointed St. Arbogast bishop of Strasbourg. Dagobert was beloved in many ways according to Fredegar, who wrote that &quot;He rendered justice to rich and poor alike,&quot; adding that, &quot;he took little sleep or food, and cared only so to act that all men should leave his presence full of joy and admiration.&quot; Such images do not fully convey the power and domination wielded by Frankish kings like Dagobert, who along with his father Chlothar, reigned to such a degree that historian Patrick Geary described the period of their combined rule as the &quot;apogee of Merovingian royal power.&quot;

Dagobert went down in history as one of the greatest Frankish kings, in spite of his mediocre military record (cf. his defeats by the Saxons and the Wends), having held his lands against the eastern hordes and with noblemen as far away as Bavaria, who sought his overlordship. Only thirty six when he died, Dagobert is considered the last of the great Merovingian kings by most historians, but this does not mean there was a major waning in Frankish power, especially in light of the writings of Paul the Deacon and John of Toledo. J.M. Wallace-Hadrill stated that Dagobert &quot;had the ruthless energy of a Clovis and the cunning of a Charlemagne.&quot; Despite having more or less united the Frankish realms, he likely was not expecting unitary rule to continue given the diverging interests of the Austrasian and Neustrian Franks, atop those of the Aquitanians and Burgundians. Upon Dagobert&#x27;s death in 639, Pepin of Landen was able to recoup his position at Metz. Meanwhile, Dagobert was buried in the abbey of Saint Denis Basilica, Paris, the first Frankish king to be buried there. Dagobert&#x27;s interment at Saint-Denis established a precedent for the burial of future French rulers there.

==Legacy==
The pattern of division and assassination, which characterized king Dagobert&#x27;s reign, continued for the next century until Pepin the Short finally deposed the last Merovingian king in 751, establishing the Carolingian dynasty. The Merovingian boy-kings remained ineffective rulers who inherited the throne as young children and lived only long enough to produce a male heir or two, while real power lay in the hands of the noble families who exercised feudal control over most of the land.

In the 830s, a biography of Dagobert, the &quot;Gesta Dagoberti&quot;, was written, probably by Hincmar. It is mostly unreliable, but does contain some information based on authentic archival documents. Dagobert was immortalized in the song &quot;Le bon roi Dagobert&quot; (&quot;The Good King Dagobert&quot;), a nursery rhyme featuring exchanges between the king and his chief adviser, Saint Eligius (&quot;Eloi&quot; in French). The satirical rhymes place Dagobert in various ridiculous positions from which Eligius&#x27; good advice manages to extract him. The text, which probably originated in the 18th century, became extremely popular as an expression of the anti-monarchist sentiment of the French Revolution. Other than placing Dagobert and Eligius in their respective roles, it has no historical accuracy.

In 1984, a 112 minute long French-Italian comedy, &quot;Le bon roi Dagobert&quot; (&quot;Good King Dagobert&quot;) was made, based on Dagobert I. The soundtrack was composed by Guido &amp; Maurizio De Angelis, Starring Ugo Tognazzi, Coluche and Michel Serrault.

==Marriage and children==
According to the &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot; Dagobert I had &quot;three queens almost simultaneously, as well as several concubines&quot;. The &quot;rex Brittanorum&quot; Judicael came to Clichy to visit Dagobert I, but opted not to dine with him due to his misgivings about Dagobert&#x27;s moral choices, instead dining with the king&#x27;s referendary St. Audoen.

The &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot; names three queens. Nanthild, Wulfegundis, and Berchildis, but none of the concubines. In 625/6 Dagobert married Gormatrude, a sister of his father&#x27;s wife Sichilde. The marriage was childless. After divorcing Gormatrude in 629/30 he made Nanthild, a Saxon servant (&quot;puella&quot;) from his personal entourage, his new queen. She gave birth to Clovis II (b. 634/5) later king of Neustria and Burgundy.

Shortly after his marriage to Nanthild, a woman called Ragnetrude bore Dagobert I a son, Sigebert III (b. 630/1) later king of Austrasia. It has been speculated that Regintrud, abbess of Nonnberg Abbey, was also a child of Dagobert I, although this theory does not fit Regintrud&#x27;s supposed date of birth between 660 and 665. She married into the Bavarian Agilolfing family, either Theodo of Bavaria or his son Theodbert of Bavaria.

<doc id="70391" wikidata="Q77212" url="?curid=70391" title="Johann Joachim Quantz">
<text>Johann Joachim Quantz (; 30 January 1697 – 12 July 1773) was a German composer, flutist and flute maker of the late Baroque period. Much of his professional career was spent in the court of Frederick the Great, where he served as the king&#x27;s flute teacher. Quantz composed hundreds of flute sonatas and concertos, and wrote &quot;On Playing the Flute&quot;, an influential treatise on flute performance. His works were known and appreciated by Bach, Haydn and Mozart.

==Biography==
===1697–1723: Early life===
Quantz was born as Hanß Jochim Quantz in Oberscheden, near Göttingen, Lower Saxony, in the Electorate of Hanover. His father, Andreas Quantz, was a blacksmith who died when Hans was not yet 11; on his deathbed, he declared that his son should follow in his footsteps. Quantz states in his autobiography that he had been trained as a blacksmith from the age of nine. As a result of his father&#x27;s death he was given the opportunity to choose his own career path and from 1708 to 1713 he began his musical studies with his uncle Justus Quantz, a town musician in Merseburg; he also studied for a time with a cousin&#x27;s husband, the organist Johann Friedrich Kiesewetter. From 1714 on, Quantz studied composition extensively and pored over scores of the masters to adopt their style.

In 1716 he joined the town band in Dresden, where in 1717 he studied counterpoint with Jan Dismas Zelenka. In March 1718 he was appointed oboist in the newly formed Dresden Polish Chapel of August II, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland. As it became clear that he couldn&#x27;t advance as an oboist in the Polish Chapel, Quantz decided to pursue the flute, studying briefly in 1719 with Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin, principal flute in the Royal Orchestra. He became good friends with Johann Georg Pisendel, concertmaster of the Royal Orchestra, who greatly influenced his style.

===1724–1727: Grand tour===
Between 1724 and 1727 Quantz completed his education by doing a &quot;Grand Tour&quot; of Europe as a flutist. He studied counterpoint with Francesco Gasparini in Rome, met Alessandro Scarlatti in Naples, befriended the flutist Michel Blavet in Paris, and in London was encouraged by Handel to remain there. During Carnival 1728 the Crown Prince, Frederick the Great, visited Dresden and met or rehearsed with Pisendel and Quantz. In April Frederick suffered from depressions and hardly ate anything; his father feared for his life. In May 1728 Quantz accompanied August II on a state visit to Berlin. The Queen of Prussia was impressed and wanted to hire him for her son. Though August II refused, he allowed Quantz to travel to Berlin and Bayreuth twice a year. In June 1730 he took part in the Zeithainer Lustlager and travelled to Berlin. Quantz later told writer Friedrich Nicolai that he and Hans Hermann von Katte one day had to hide in a closet during an outburst of Frederick&#x27;s domineering father, who disapproved of his son&#x27;s hairstyle, musical studies, questionable books and fancy dressing gowns. Quantz married Anna Rosina Carolina Schindler in 1737; the marriage was not happy, and it was generally known in Berlin that his wife tyrannized him. Until 1741 Quantz remained at the Saxon Court in Dresden.

===1741–1773: Court of Frederick===
When Frederick II became King of Prussia in 1740, Quantz finally accepted a position as flute teacher, flute maker and composer. He joined at the court in Berlin in December 1741 and stayed there for the rest of his career. He made flutes from at least 1739 and was an innovator in flute design, adding a second key (Eb, in addition to the standard D#) to help with intonation, for example. Frederick owned 11 flutes made by Quantz.

As well as writing hundreds of sonatas and concertos, mainly for the flute, he is known today as the author of &quot;Versuch einer Anweisung die Flöte traversiere zu spielen&quot; (1752) (titled &quot;On Playing the Flute&quot; in English), a treatise on traverso flute playing. It is a valuable source of reference regarding performance practice and flute technique in the 18th century.

Quantz never joined his orchestra, lived in Berlin-Mitte (Kronenstrasse), but played at Frederick&#x27;s court until his death in 1773. A biography appeared in 1755 in Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg&#x27;s &quot;Historisch-kritischen Beyträgen zur Aufnahme der Musik&quot;; another, in Italian, followed in 1762. His grandnephew, Albert Quantz, published a full-length biography in 1877.

==Works==
Few of Quantz&#x27;s works were published during his lifetime. Most of them are for transverse flute, including more than 200 sonatas, around 300 concertos, including several for two flutes; around 45 trio sonatas (mostly for 2 flutes or flute and violin, with continuo); 6 quartets for flute, violin, viola and continuo; various flute duets and flute trios; and unaccompanied caprices and fantasias for flute.

The thematic catalog for Quantz&#x27;s works was published by Horst Augsbach. &#x27;QV&#x27; stands for &#x27;Quantz Verzeichnis&#x27;, and &#x27;Anh.&#x27; for &#x27;Anhang&#x27; (&quot;supplement&quot;) when the authenticity of the works is in doubt. A number of additional works have been discovered or come to light since its publication.

<text>A countertenor (also contra tenor) is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is equivalent to that of the female contralto or mezzo-soprano voice types, generally extending from around G3 to D5 or E5, although a sopranist (a specific kind of countertenor) may match the soprano&#x27;s range of around C4 to C6. Countertenors often have tenor or baritone chest voices, but sing in falsetto or head voice much more often than they do in their chest voice.

The nature of the countertenor voice has radically changed throughout musical history, from a modal voice, to a modal and falsetto voice, to the primarily falsetto voice that is denoted by the term today. This is partly because of changes in human physiology (increase in body height) and partly because of fluctuations in pitch.

The term first came into use in England during the mid-17th century and was in wide use by the late 17th century. The use of adult male falsettos in polyphony, commonly in the soprano range, was known in European all-male sacred choirs for some decades previous, as early as the mid-16th century. Modern-day ensembles such as the Tallis Scholars and the Sixteen have countertenors on alto parts in works of this period. There is no evidence that falsetto singing was known in Britain before the early 17th century, when it was occasionally heard on soprano parts.

In the second half of the 20th century, there was great interest in and renewed popularity of the countertenor voice, partly due to pioneers such as Alfred Deller and Russell Oberlin, as well as the increased popularity of Baroque opera and the need of male singers to replace the castrati roles in such works. Although the voice has been considered largely an early music phenomenon, there is a growing modern repertoire collection for countertenors, especially in contemporary music.

== History ==
=== Early centuries ===
In polyphonic compositions of the 14th and early 15th centuries, the &quot;contratenor&quot; was a voice part added to the basic two-part contrapuntal texture of discant (&quot;superius&quot;) and tenor (from the Latin , which means to hold, since this part &quot;held&quot; the music&#x27;s melody, while the &quot;superius&quot; descanted upon it at a higher pitch). Though having approximately the same range as the tenor, it was generally of a much less melodic nature than either of these other two parts. With the introduction in about 1450 of four-part writing by composers such as Ockeghem and Obrecht, the &quot;contratenor&quot; split into &quot;contratenor altus&quot; and &quot;contratenor bassus&quot;, which were respectively above and below the tenor. Later the term became obsolete: in Italy, &quot;contratenor altus&quot; became simply &quot;altus&quot;, in France, &quot;haute-contre&quot;, and in England, countertenor. Though originally these words were used to designate a vocal part, they are now used to describe singers of that part, whose vocal techniques may differ (see below).

In the Catholic Church during the Renaissance, St. Paul&#x27;s admonition &quot;mulieres in ecclesiis taceant&quot; (&quot;let the women keep silence in the churches&quot;) still prevailed, and women were banned from singing in church services. Countertenors, though rarely described as such, therefore found a prominent part in liturgical music, whether singing a line alone or with boy trebles or altos. (Spain had a long tradition of male falsettists singing soprano lines). Countertenors were hardly ever used for roles in early opera, however, the rise of which coincided with the arrival of a fashion for castrati. For example, the latter took several roles in the first performance of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; (1607). Castrati were already prominent by this date in Italian church choirs, replacing both falsettists and trebles; the last soprano falsettist singing in Rome, Juan [Johannes de] San[c]tos (a Spaniard), died in 1652. In Italian opera, by the late seventeenth century castrati predominated, while in France, the modal high tenor, called the &quot;haute-contre&quot;, was established as the voice of choice for leading male roles.

In England Purcell wrote significant music for a higher male voice that he called a &quot;counter-tenor&quot;, for example, the roles of Secrecy and Summer in &quot;The Fairy-Queen&quot; (1692). &quot;These lines have often challenged modern singers, who have been unsure whether they are high tenor parts or are meant for falsettists&quot;. Contemporary vocal treatises, however, make clear that Purcell&#x27;s singers would have been trained to blend both methods of vocal production. In Purcell&#x27;s choral music the situation is further complicated by the occasional appearance of more than one solo part designated &quot;countertenor&quot;, but with a considerable difference in range and tessitura. Such is the case in &quot;Hail, bright Cecilia&quot; (&quot;The Ode on St Cecilia&#x27;s Day 1692&quot;) in which the solo, Tis Nature&#x27;s Voice&quot;, has the range F3 to B4 (similar to those stage roles cited previously), whereas, in the duet, &quot;Hark each tree&quot;, the countertenor soloist sings from E4 to D5 (in the trio &quot;With that sublime celestial lay&quot;. Later in the same work, Purcell&#x27;s own manuscript designates the same singer, Mr Howel, described as &quot;a High Contra tenor&quot; to perform in the range G3 to C4; it is very likely that he took some of the lowest notes in a well-blended &quot;chest voice&quot; – see below).

=== 18th century ===
&quot;The Purcell counter-tenor &#x27;tenor&#x27; did not flourish in England much beyond the early years of the [eighteenth] century; within twenty years of Purcell&#x27;s death Handel had settled in London and &quot;opera seria&quot;, which was underpinned entirely by Italian singing, soon became entrenched in British theatres&quot;. In parallel, by Handel&#x27;s time, castrati had come to dominate the English operatic stage as much as that of Italy (and indeed most of Europe outside France). They also took part in several of Handel&#x27;s oratorios, though countertenors, too, occasionally featured as soloists in the latter, the parts written for them being closer in compass to the higher ones of Purcell, with a usual range of A3 to E5. They also sang the alto parts in Handel&#x27;s choruses. It was as choral singers within the Anglican church tradition (as well as in the secular genre of the glee) that countertenors survived as performers throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Otherwise they largely faded from public notice.

=== 20th century ===
The most visible person of the countertenor revival in the twentieth century was Alfred Deller, an English singer and champion of authentic early music performance. Deller initially identified as an &quot;alto&quot;, but his collaborator Michael Tippett recommended the archaic term &quot;countertenor&quot; to describe his voice. In the 1950s and 60s, his group, the Deller Consort, was important in increasing audiences&#x27; awareness (and appreciation) of Renaissance and Baroque music. Deller was the first modern countertenor to achieve fame and has had many prominent successors. Benjamin Britten wrote the leading role of Oberon in his setting of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1960) especially for Deller. The countertenor role of Apollo in Britten&#x27;s &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (1973) was created by James Bowman, the best-known amongst the next generation of English countertenors. Russell Oberlin was Deller&#x27;s American counterpart and another early music pioneer. Oberlin&#x27;s success was entirely unprecedented in a country that did not have much experience of performance of works prior to Bach, and it paved the way for the great success of countertenors following him. Oberlin, however, harked back to the earlier tradition of countertenors using only their modal voices.

Today, countertenors are much in demand in many forms of classical music. In opera, many roles originally written for castrati (castrated males) are now sung and recorded by countertenors, as are some trouser roles originally written for female singers. The former category is much more numerous and includes Orfeo in Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; and many Handel roles, such as the name parts in &quot;Rinaldo&quot;, &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;, &quot;Serse&quot; and &quot;Orlando&quot;, and Bertarido in &quot;Rodelinda&quot;. Mozart also had castrati roles in his operas, including Aminta in &quot;Il re pastore&quot;, Cecilio in &quot;Lucio Silla&quot;, Ramiro in &quot;La finta giardiniera&quot;, Idamante in &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, and Sesto in &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;.

Many modern composers other than Britten have written, and continue to write, countertenor parts, both in choral works and opera, as well as songs and song-cycles for the voice. Men&#x27;s choral groups such as Chanticleer and The King&#x27;s Singers employ the voice to great effect in a variety of genres, including early music, gospel, and even folk songs. Other recent operatic parts written for the countertenor voice include Edgar in Aribert Reimann&#x27;s &quot;Lear&quot; (1978), the messenger in his &quot;Medea&quot; (2010), Prince Go-Go in György Ligeti&#x27;s &quot;Le Grand Macabre&quot; (1978), the title role in Philip Glass&#x27;s &quot;Akhnaten&quot; (1983), Claire in John Lunn&#x27;s &quot;The Maids&quot; (1998), the Refugee in Jonathan Dove&#x27;s &quot;Flight&quot; (1998), Trinculo in Thomas Adès&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; (2004), the Boy in George Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;Written on Skin&quot; (2012) and several others (see Roles in opera below).

== Vocal range ==
The vocal range of a countertenor is equivalent to that of the female contralto or mezzo-soprano voice types. A trained countertenor will typically have a vocal centre similar in placement to that of a contralto or mezzo-soprano. Peter Giles, a professional countertenor and noted author on the subject, defines the countertenor as a musical part rather than as a vocal style or mechanism. In modern usage, the term &quot;countertenor&quot; is essentially equivalent to the medieval term &quot;contratenor altus&quot; (see above). In this way, a countertenor singer can be operationally defined as a man who sings the countertenor part, whatever vocal style or mechanism is employed. The countertenor range is generally equivalent to an alto range, extending from approximately G3 to D5 or E5. In comparison to female voices the male voice usually has an extended range towards the low notes, but the lowest parts of the range are usually not used. In actual practice, it is generally acknowledged that a majority of countertenors sing with a falsetto vocal production for at least the upper half of this range, although most use some form of &quot;chest voice&quot; (akin to the range of their speaking voice) for the lower notes. The most difficult challenge for such a singer is managing the lower middle range, for there are normally a few notes (around B3) that can be sung with either vocal mechanism, and the transition between registers must somehow be blended or smoothly managed.

In response to the (in his view) pejorative connotation of the term falsetto, Giles refuses to use it, calling the upper register &quot;head voice&quot;. Many voice experts would disagree with this choice of terminology, reserving the designation &quot;head voice&quot; for the high damped register accompanied by a relatively low larynx that is typical of modern high operatic tenor voice production. The latter type of head voice is, in terms of the vocal cord vibration, actually more similar to &quot;chest voice&quot; than to falsetto, since it uses the same &quot;speaking voice&quot; production (referred to as &quot;modal&quot; by voice scientists), and this is reflected in the timbre.

== Terminology ==
Particularly in the British choral tradition, the terms &quot;male soprano&quot; and &quot;male alto&quot; serve to identify men who rely on falsetto vocal production, rather than the modal voice, to sing in the soprano or alto vocal range. Elsewhere, the terms have less universal currency. Some authorities do accept them as descriptive of male falsettists, although this view is subject to controversy; they would reserve the term &quot;countertenor&quot; for men who, like Russell Oberlin, sing in the alto range with little or no falsetto, equating it with &quot;haute-contre&quot; and the Italian &quot;tenor altino&quot;. Adherents to this view maintain that a countertenor will have unusually short vocal cords and consequently a higher speaking voice and lower range and tessitura than their falsettist counterparts, perhaps from D3 to D5. Operatic vocal classification, on the other hand, prefers the terms &quot;countertenor&quot; and &quot;sopranist&quot; to &quot;male soprano&quot; and &quot;male alto&quot;, and some scholars consider the latter two terms inaccurate owing to physiological differences between male and female vocal production.

<doc id="70394" wikidata="Q209118" url="?curid=70394" title="Chlothar II">
<text>Chlothar II, sometimes called &quot;the Young&quot; (French: le Jeune), (May/June 584 – 18 October 629) was king of the Franks, ruling Neustria (584–629), Burgundy (613–629) and Austrasia (613–623).

The son of Chilperic I and his third wife, Fredegund, he started his reign as an infant under the regency of his mother, who was in an uneasy alliance with Chlothar&#x27;s uncle King Guntram of Burgundy, who died in 592. Chlothar took power upon the death of his mother in 597; though rich, his realm was one of the smallest portions of Francia. He continued his mother&#x27;s feud with Queen Brunhilda with equal viciousness and bloodshed, finally achieving her execution by dismemberment in 613, after winning the battle that enabled Chlothar to unite Francia under his rule. Like his father, he built up his territories by seizing lands after the deaths of other kings.

His reign was long by contemporary standards, but saw the continuing erosion of royal power to the French nobility and the church against a backdrop of feuding among the Merovingians. The Edict of Paris in 614, concerned with several aspects of appointments to offices and the administration of the kingdom, has been interpreted in different ways by modern historians. In 617 he made the mayor of the Palace a role held for life, an important step in the progress of this office from being first the manager of the royal household to the effective head of government, and eventually the monarch, under Pepin the Short in 751. Chlothar was forced to cede rule over Austrasia to his young son Dagobert I in 623.

Unusually for a Merovingian monarch, he practised monogamy, though early deaths meant that he had three wives. He was generally an ally of the church and, perhaps inspired by the example of his uncle Guntram, his reign seems to lack outrageous acts of murder, the execution of Brunhilda excepted.

==Background==

===Frankish territories in the sixth century===

The domain of Clothar II was located in the territorial and political framework derived from the Frankish kingdom present at 561 at the death of Clothar, son of Clovis and grandfather of Clothar II.

On the death of Clovis in 511, four kingdoms were established with capitals at Reims, Soissons, Paris, and Orléans, Aquitaine being distributed separately. In the year 550, Clothar I, the last survivor of four brothers reunited the Frankish kingdom, and added Burgundian territory (Burgundia) by conquest.

In 561, the four sons of Clothar I followed the events of 511 similarly and split the kingdom again: Sigebert I in Reims, Chilperic I in Soissons, Charibert I in Paris, and Guntram in Orleans, which then included the Burgundian kingdom territory (Burgundia). They divided Aquitaine separately again. Very quickly, Sigebert moved his capital from Reims to Metz, while Guntram moved his from Orléans to Chalon. On the death of Charibert in 567, the land was again split between the three survivors, of greatest importance Sigebert (Metz) received Paris and Chilperic (Soissons) received Rouen. The names Austrasia and Neustria seem to have appeared as the names of these kingdoms for the first time at this point.

===Ambitions of Fredegund===
In 560, Sigebert and Chilperic married two sisters, daughters of the Visigoth king of Spain Athanagild; princesses Brunhilda, and Galswintha respectively. However Chilperic was still very much attached to his lover and consort, Fredegund, causing Galswintha to wish to return to her homeland in Toledo. In 568 she was murdered and within days, after a brief period of grieving, Chilperic officially married Fredegund and elevated her to a queen of a Frankish kingdom. &quot;After this action his brothers thought that the queen mentioned above had been killed at his command...&quot;

Chilperic agreed, at first, to pay a sum of money to end the feud, but not soon after decided to embark on a series of military operations against Sigebert. This was the beginning of what is called the &quot;royal feud &quot; which did not end until Brunhilda died in 613. The main episodes until the assassination of Chilperic in 584 were as follows: the assassination of Sigebert (575), the imprisonment of Brunhilde and her marriage to a son of Chilperic, and the return of Brunhilda to her son Childebert II, successor of Sigebert.

Moreover, Fredegund strove to ensure her position, since she was from lower origins, by eliminating the sons that Chilperic had with his previous wife Audovera: Merovech and Clovis. Her own children, however, died at a very young age and appeared to be by foul play. When Fredegund had a son in the spring of 584, he would have been the future successor of Chilperic I, if he had lived long enough.

==Sources==

The main sources from the time are the chronicles of Gregory of Tours and the Chronicle of Fredegar. It is possible, however, that the authors contain a degree of bias in their works; for instance Gregory was a key figure in some of the conflicts of the time. &quot;The History of the Franks&quot; by Gregory of Tours in the late sixth century only recounts up to 591. It is favorable to Queen Brunhild, Sigebert, and Chilperic but extremely hostile to Fredegund. The Chronicle of Fredegar, beginning in 584, on the other hand is extremely hostile to Brunhild. That chronicle includes:
* The Biography of Clothar II
* Clothar II deals with the Lombards

==Early life==

Under Frankish customs, newborns did not receive names initially, in order not to spread concern related to the symbolic name of the Merovingian. Wanting to choose a name based on the development of unrest in the kingdom of the Franks, his father did not baptize him immediately. Chilperic and Fredegund desired to protect their child, since their four older sons may have been victims of murder, and there was much political intrigue at the time. He was raised in secret in the royal villa in Vitry-en-Artois to avoid detection.

In September 584, Chilperic I was murdered after a hunt near his villa of Chelles, perhaps on the order of Queen Brunhilda. This event produced general disorder and unrest. In this time Austrasians plundered parts of Neustria, seizing valuable treasures and goods, as well as important documents. Princess Rigunth, on the way to Spain to marry Prince Reccared, was captured by Duke Didier of Toulouse and was linked in conspiracy with Gondovald, who stole all that remained of her dowry, so that she was forced to abandon the marriage. Wars broke out between rival cities, and Orléans, Blois and Chartres stood against Châteaudun.

Fredegund managed to keep most of the treasury of the state as well as key political figures, such as the generals Ansoald and Audon, although many, such as chamberlain Eberul, abandoned her. She took her son to Vitry and sent a message to Guntram, King of Burgundy, asking him to adopt the child and offer his protection to him in return for exercising his authority over Neustria until the boy came of age.

Childebert II, who was at Meaux when Chilperic was murdered, considered an attack on Paris, but Guntram was ahead of him. Childebert II began negotiations with Brunhilda on one hand, Guntram on the other; Guntram, however, refused many of his requests, including allowing him into Paris. He refused to deliver Fredegund, whom Brunhilda claimed was behind the regicide of Sigebert I, Clovis, and even Chilperic I.

Guntram convened a meeting of Greater Neustria, in which the court recognized Clothar as the son of Chilperic, although there were some doubts about his paternal identity. It was at this time that they gave him the name Clothar, naming him after his grandfather. Guntram then took legal responsibility of the child, adopting him and becoming his godfather.

Ansoald was responsible for regaining control of cities Neustria had lost since the death of Chilperic. They then swore allegiance to Guntram and Clothar after their capture. Guntram, attempting to restore order in the affairs of Neustria, likely against the advice of Fredegund and, perhaps, to show his authority, replaced key figures in the episcopal see of the church and moved its location. Bishop Promotus of Châteaudun, whose diocese was demoted after the parish council of Paris in 573, saw this as a violation of canon law; after the death of Sigebert I, he demanded to return from exile, and was thus restored much of his personal property.

Two envoys from Brunhilde, Duke Gararic and chamberlain Eberon, succeeded in swaying Limoges, Tours, and Poitiers towards Austrasian influence, with the help of bishops Gregory of Tours and Venantius Fortunat. Guntram responded by sending troops to recover the lost cities that promptly returned their loyalties to Guntram and Clothar. Fredegund was sent to the Villa de Vaudreuil, in the diocese of Rouen, where she was put under the supervision of the bishop Pretextatus.

During the summer of 585, Guntram returned to Paris to act as godfather of Clothar, as he swore to Fredegund, along with three bishops and three hundred nobles of Neustria who recognized Clothar II as the son of Chilperic I. However, the baptism at this time was postponed. It was expected to reconvene at the council of Troyes, but Austrasia refused to participate if Guntram would not disinherit Clothar. The council was moved to Burgundy and Clothar was baptized on 23 October 585.

While Guntram campaigned to capture Visigothic Septimania, Fredegund escaped custody of the bishop and fled Rouen. During Sunday Mass, Pretextatus was stabbed, although he did not die immediately. Fredegund attempted to fetch doctors and gain his favor. However, he openly accused her of being behind this attack and the murder of the various kings. He publicly cursed and denounced her before dying soon after.
The queen then used her new freedom to rally as many nobles and bishops as could be found to her son. She was reinstalled into power despite Guntram&#x27;s exile of her. Guntram then attempted to weaken Fredegund&#x27;s influence by swaying some of the Neustrian aristocracy to his side, and keep Neustrian lands he held between the Loire and Seine by rallying Duke Beppolène. In 587, he managed to capture the towns of Angers, Saintes, and Nantes.

Fredegund then offered to negotiate peace and sent ambassadors to Guntram. But they were arrested and Guntram severed relations with Neustria, approaching Brunhilda and Childebert II, with whom he concluded the pact of Andelot: agreeing that upon the death of one of the two kings, the other would inherit his kingdom. In 592 Guntram died and Childebert became king of Austrasia and Burgundy.

The Austrasia-Burgundy union lasted only until 595, when the death of Childebert II brought it to an end. His realm was then split between his two sons: Theudebert II inherited Austrasia, while Theuderic II received the kingdom of Burgundy. The two brothers then campaigned united against their cousin Chlothar II of Neustria, but their alliance lasted only until 599, when they took up arms against each other.
In 593, although only as a symbolic presence since he was only nine years old, Clothar II appeared at the head of his army, which routed the Austrasian Duke Wintrio who was invading Neustria, in the Battle of Droizy. In 596, Clotaire and Fredegund took Paris, which was supposed to be held in common. Fredegund, then her son&#x27;s regent, sent a force to Laffaux, and the armies of Theudebert and Theuderic were defeated. Fredegund died in 597, leaving Clothar to rule over Neustria alone, although the boy king didn&#x27;t do anything significant for 2 more years.

==Ruler of Neustria==

===Battle of Dormelles===
In 599, he made war with his nephews, Theuderic II of Burgundy and Theudebert II of Austrasia, who were old enough to be his cousins. They defeated him at Dormelles (near Montereau), forcing him to sign a treaty that reduced his kingdom to the regions of Beauvais, Amiens and Rouen, with the remainder split between the two brothers. At this point, however, the two brothers took up arms against each other. In 605, he invaded Theuderic&#x27;s kingdom, but did not subdue it. He remained often at war with Theuderic until the latter died in Metz in late 613 while preparing a campaign against him.

In 604, a first attempt to reconquer his kingdom ended in failure for Clothar. His son Merovech was taken prisoner by Theuderic at the Battle of Étampes and was murdered at the order of Brunhilda by Bertoald. Clothar agreed that he would become the godfather of Theuderic&#x27;s son in 607, naming him Merovech.

Around the same time, Theuderic, seeking a marriage to the Spanish Visigoth princess Ermenberge, daughter of King Witteric, created new political tensions. Witteric then negotiated with Clothar II for an alliance, as well as Agilulf, King of the Lombards. The coalition against Theuderic does not appear to have been followed by significant effects.

===War between Austrasia and Burgundy (610–612)===
In 610 Theudebert and Theuderic entered into a war. Theudebert won initial victories in 610, which led Theuderic to approach Clothar, promising to return northern Neustria to him for his aid. Theudebert was crushed in 612, at the battles of Toul and Tolbiac, near Cologne.

===War between Clothar and Austrasia-Burgundy (613)===

As agreed, Theuderic ceded northern Neustria to Clothar, but then turned around and organized an invasion of Neustria. However he died of dysentery in Metz in 613. His troops dispersed immediately, and Brunhilda placed her great-grandson Sigebert II on the throne of Austrasia.

At that time, Warnachar, mayor of the palace of Austrasia, and Rado, mayor of the palace of Burgundy, abandoned the cause of Brunhilda and her great-grandson, Sigebert II, and the entire realm was delivered into Chlothar&#x27;s hands. Brunhilda and Sigebert met Chlothar&#x27;s army on the Aisne, but the Patrician Aletheus, Duke Rocco, and Duke Sigvald deserted the host and the grand old woman and her king had to flee. They got as far as the Orbe, but Chlothar&#x27;s soldiers caught up with them by the lake Neuchâtel. Both of them and Sigebert&#x27;s younger brother Corbo were executed by Chlothar&#x27;s orders, then proceeded to execute many of the family members of this house except Merovech, his godson, and perhaps Childebert who had fled.

Brunhilde was accused of murdering ten members of the Neustrian royal family, as well as other Frankish royalty, and was tried and convicted. She underwent a very severe torture and execution by being dragged on the back of a horse and drawn-and-quartered. After this victory, Clothar was left as the sole royal ruler of the Frankish peoples and consolidated his power.

==King of All Franks (613–629)==
Upon his unification of all Franks, Clothar took up residence in Paris and in the villas of Alentours.

===Mayors of the Palace===
An important key aspect that was maintained in all three administrations of the kingdoms even after unification was the presence of the Mayors of the Palace. The mayor of the palace was originally the king&#x27;s servant in charge of administrative events of the palace. During the royal feud, however, the role grew in importance as more of a steward of lands to care more directly than the king could and was placed in the hands of aristocracy. One of the most notable figures in this role was Warnachaire, mayor of the palace of Burgundy in 613, who was one of the leaders responsible for capturing Brunhild, and held the position until his death in 626. Warnachaire&#x27;s wife, Berthe, was likely a daughter of Clothar.

===Edict of 614===
In 614, Chlothar II convoked the Council of Paris and promulgated the Edict of Paris, which reserved many rights to the Frankish nobles while it excluded Jews from all civil employment for the Crown. The ban effectively placed all literacy in the Merovingian monarchy squarely under ecclesiastical control and also greatly pleased the nobles, from whose ranks the bishops were ordinarily exclusively drawn. Article 11 of the Edict states that it is to restore &quot;peace and discipline in [the] kingdom&quot; and &quot;suppress rebellion and insolence&quot;. The edict was ratified for all three kingdoms. Owing to several abuses of powers by officials, many of whom had been appointed by Chilperic, several mandates were made, among them the requirement that officials must have come from the region they officiate over.

Chlothar was induced by Warnachar and Rado to make the mayoralty of the palace a lifetime appointment at Bonneuil-sur-Marne, near Paris, in 617.

===Dagobert King of Austrasia (623)===

In 623, he gave the kingdom of Austrasia to his young son Dagobert I. This was a political move as repayment for the support of Bishop Arnulf of Metz and Pepin I, mayor of the palace of Austrasia, the two leading Austrasian nobles, who were effectively granted semi-autonomy.

At the same time, Clothar made territorial changes by assigning the region of Reims to Neustria. But Dagobert, now the semi-autonomous king of Austrasia, negotiated its return in 626.

===Barbarian and Christian relations===
Clothar was no exception in the line of Merovingians of its history of family feuding. This was considered to be a very &#x27;barbarian&#x27; custom. However, he was one of the few Merovingians that did not practice polygamy, instead remaining faithful to a single wife until her death. He remained respectful of the Church and its doctrines, keeping it as an ally. He likely tried to maintain himself as a pious king, inspired by the holiness of his uncle Guntram who had protected him and allowed him the throne.

In 617, he renewed the treaty of friendship that bound the Frankish kings with the kings of the Lombards. He likely had the policy of maintaining good relations with Christianized-barbarian peoples so long as they kept good relations themselves with the Church.

==Death==
Clothar died in 629 at age 45 and was buried, like his father, in the Saint Vincent Basilica of Paris, later incorporated into the church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. His rule lasted longer than any other Merovingian king save for his grandfather, Chlothar I. Clothar&#x27;s son Dagobert, who had been king of Austrasia, succeeded his father in Neustria and Burgundy. Dagobert&#x27;s half-brother, Charibert, however became king of Aquitaine.

==Family==
He first married Haldetrude, with whom he had the following children:

*Merovech, who was captured during a campaign against Burgundy and killed on orders of Brunhilda.
*Emma of Austrasia, married in 618 to King Eadbald of Kent († 640). Though recently it has been suggested that she may have instead been the daughter of Erchinoald, mayor of the palace in Neustria.
*Dagobert I (c. 603–639), King of the Franks

His second wife, Bertrude, was likely the daughter of Richomer, patrician of the Burgundians, and Gertrude. This marriage produced:

*A son who died in infancy in 617.
*Bertha, wife of Warnachaire, mayor of the palace of Burgundy.

In 618, he married Sichilde, sister of Gomatrude, who later married Dagobert I, and probably sister of Brodulfe, who would later support Charibert II. From this marriage there was:

*Charibert II († 632), king of Aquitaine.
*Oda, a daughter.

<text>Bounded rationality is the idea that rationality is limited when individuals make decisions, and under these limitations, rational individuals will select a decision that is satisfactory rather than optimal.

Limitations include the difficulty of the problem requiring a decision, the cognitive capability of the mind, and the time available to make the decision. Decision-makers, in this view, act as satisficers, seeking a satisfactory solution, with everything that they have at the moment rather than an optimal solution. Therefore, humans do not undertake a full cost-benefit analysis to determine the optimal decision, but rather, choose an option that fulfills their adequacy criteria.

Some models of human behavior in the social sciences assume that humans can be reasonably approximated or described as rational entities, as in rational choice theory or Downs&#x27; political agency model. The concept of bounded rationality complements the idea of rationality as optimization, which views decision-making as a fully rational process of finding an optimal choice given the information available. Therefore, bounded rationality can be said to address the discrepancy between the assumed perfect rationality of human behaviour (which is utilised by other economics theories), and the reality of human cognition. In short, bounded rationality revises notions of perfect rationality to account for the fact that perfectly rational decisions are often not feasible in practice because of the intractability of natural decision problems and the finite computational resources available for making them. The concept of bounded rationality continues to influence (and be debated in) different disciplines, including political science, economics, psychology, law, philosophy, and cognitive science.

==Background and motivation==
 was coined by Herbert A. Simon, where it was proposed as an alternative basis for the mathematical and neoclassical economic modelling of decision-making, as used in economics, political science, and related disciplines. Many economics models assume that agents are on average rational, and can in large quantities be approximated to act according to their preferences in order to maximise utility. With bounded rationality, Simon&#x27;s goal was &quot;to replace the global rationality of economic man with a kind of rational behavior that is compatible with the access to information and the computational capacities that are actually possessed by organisms, including man, in the kinds of environments in which such organisms exist.&quot; Soon after the term bounded rationality appeared, studies in the topic area began examining the issue in depth. A study completed by Allais in 1953 began to generate ideas of the irrationality of decision making as he found that given preferences, individuals will not always choose the most rational decision and therefore the concept of rationality was not always reliable in economic predictions.

In &quot;Models of Man&quot;, Simon argues that most people are only partly rational, and are irrational in the remaining part of their actions. In another work, he states &quot;boundedly rational agents experience limits in formulating and solving complex problems and in processing (receiving, storing, retrieving, transmitting) information&quot;. Simon used the analogy of a pair of scissors, where one blade represents &quot;cognitive limitations&quot; of actual humans and the other the &quot;structures of the environment&quot;, illustrating how minds compensate for limited resources by exploiting known structural regularity in the environment.

Simon describes a number of dimensions along which classical models of rationality can be made somewhat more realistic, while remaining within the vein of fairly rigorous formalization. These include:

* limiting the types of utility functions
* recognizing the costs of gathering and processing information
* the possibility of having a vector or multi-valued utility function

Simon suggests that economic agents use heuristics to make decisions rather than a strict rigid rule of optimization. They do this because of the complexity of the situation. An example of behaviour inhibited by heuristics can be seen when comparing the cognitive strategies utilised in simple situations (e.g. tic-tac-toe), in comparison to strategies utilised in difficult situations (e.g. chess). Both games, as defined by game theory economics, are finite games with perfect information, and therefore equivalent. However, within chess, mental capacities and abilities are a binding constraint, therefore optimal choices are not a possibility. Thus, in order to test the mental limits of agents, complex problems, such as those within chess, should be studied to test how individuals work around their cognitive limits, and what behaviours or heuristics are used to form solutions

Anchoring and adjustment are types of heuristics that give some explanation to bounded rationality and why decision makers do not make rational decisions. A study undertaken by Zenko et al. showed that the amount of physical activity completed by decision makers was able to be influenced by anchoring and adjustment as most decision makers would typically be considered irrational and would unlikely do the amount of physical activity instructed and it was shown that these decision makers use anchoring and adjustment to decide how much exercise they will complete.

Other heuristics that are closely related to the concept of bounded rationality include the availability heuristic and representativeness heuristic. The availability heuristic refers to how people tend to overestimate the likelihood of events that are easily brought to mind, such as vivid or recent experiences. This can lead to biased judgments based on incomplete or unrepresentative information. The representativeness heuristic states that people often judge the probability of an event based on how closely it resembles a typical or representative case, ignoring other relevant factors like base rates or sample size. These mental shortcuts and systematic errors in thinking demonstrate how people&#x27;s decision-making abilities are limited and often deviate from perfect rationality.  

===Examples===
An example of bounded rationality in individuals would be a customer who made a suboptimal decision to order some food at the restaurant because they felt rushed by the waiter who was waiting beside the table. Another example is a trader who would make a moderate and risky decision to trade their stock due to time pressure and imperfect information of the market at that time.

In an organisational context, a CEO cannot make fully rational decisions in an ad-hoc situation because their cognition was overwhelmed by a lot of information in that tense situation. The CEO also needs to take time to process all the information given to them, but due to the limited time and fast decision making needed, they will disregard some information in determining the decision.

Bounded rationality can have significant effects on political decision-making, voter behavior, and policy outcomes. A prominent example of this is heuristic-based voting. According to the theory of bounded rationality, individuals have limited time, information, and cognitive resources to make decisions. In the context of voting, this means that most voters cannot realistically gather and process all available information about candidates, issues, and policies. Even if such information were available, the time and effort required to analyze it would be prohibitively high for many voters. As a result, voters often resort to heuristics, which allow voters to make decisions based on cues like party affiliation, candidate appearance, or single-issue positions, rather than engaging in a comprehensive evaluation of all relevant factors. For example, a voter who relies on the heuristic of party affiliation may vote for a candidate whose policies do not actually align with their interests, simply because the candidate belongs to their preferred party.  

==Model extensions==
As decision-makers have to make decisions about how and when to decide, Ariel Rubinstein proposed to model bounded rationality by explicitly specifying decision-making procedures as decision-makers with the same information are also not able to analyse the situation equally thus reach the same rational decision. Rubinstein argues that consistency in reaching final decision for the same level of information must factor in the decision making procedure itself. This puts the study of decision procedures on the research agenda.

Gerd Gigerenzer stated that decision theorists, to some extent, have not adhered to Simon&#x27;s original ideas. Rather, they have considered how decisions may be crippled by limitations to rationality, or have modeled how people might cope with their inability to optimize. Gigerenzer proposes and shows that simple heuristics often lead to better decisions than theoretically optimal procedures. Moreover, Gigerenzer claimed, agents react relative to their environment and use their cognitive processes to adapt accordingly.

Huw Dixon later argued that it may not be necessary to analyze in detail the process of reasoning underlying bounded rationality. If we believe that agents will choose an action that gets them close to the optimum, then we can use the notion of &quot;epsilon-optimization&quot;, which means we choose our actions so that the payoff is within epsilon of the optimum. If we define the optimum (best possible) payoff as formula_1, then the set of epsilon-optimizing options S(ε) can be defined as all those options s such that:
formula_2

The notion of strict rationality is then a special case (&quot;ε&quot;=0). The advantage of this approach is that it avoids having to specify in detail the process of reasoning, but rather simply assumes that whatever the process is, it is good enough to get near to the optimum.

From a computational point of view, decision procedures can be encoded in algorithms and heuristics. Edward Tsang argues that the effective rationality of an agent is determined by its computational intelligence. Everything else being equal, an agent that has better algorithms and heuristics could make more rational (closer to optimal) decisions than one that has poorer heuristics and algorithms.

Tshilidzi Marwala and Evan Hurwitz in their study on bounded rationality observed that advances in technology (e.g. computer processing power because of Moore&#x27;s law, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics) expand the bounds that define the feasible rationality space. Because of this expansion of the bounds of rationality, machine automated decision making makes markets more efficient.

The model of bounded rationality also extends to bounded self-interest, in which humans are sometimes willing to forsake their own self-interests for the benefits of others due to incomplete information that the individuals have at the time being. This is something that had not been considered in earlier economic models.

The theory of rational inattention, an extension of bounded rationality, studied by Christopher Sims, found that decisions may be chosen with incomplete information as opposed to affording the cost to receive complete information. This shows that decision makers choose to endure bounded rationality.

On the other hand, another extension came from the notion of bounded rationality and was explained by Ulrich Hoffrage and Torsten Reimer in their studies of a &quot;fast and frugal heuristic approach&quot;. The studies explained that complete information sometimes is not needed as there are easier and simpler ways to reach the same optimal outcome. However, this approach which is usually known as the gaze heuristic was explained to be the theory for non-complex decision making only.

==Behavioral economics==

Bounded rationality attempts to address assumption points discussed within neoclassical economics theory during the 1950s. This theory assumes that the complex problem, the way in which the problem is presented, all alternative choices, and a utility function, are all provided to decision-makers in advance, where this may not be realistic. This was widely used and accepted for a number of decades, however economists realised some disadvantages exist in utilising this theory. This theory did not consider how problems are initially discovered by decision-makers, which could have an impact on the overall decision. Additionally, personal values, the way in which alternatives are discovered and created, and the environment surrounding the decision-making process are also not considered when using this theory. Alternatively, bounded rationality focuses on the cognitive ability of the decision-maker and the factors which may inhibit optimal decision-making. Additionally, placing a focus on organisations rather than focusing on markets as neoclassical economics theory does, bounded rationality is also the basis for many other economics theories (e.g. organisational theory) as it emphasises that the &quot;...performance and success of an organisation is governed primarily by the psychological limitations of its members...&quot; as stated by John D.W. Morecroft (1981).

One concept closely related to the idea of bounded rationality is nudging. The connection between nudging and bounded rationality lies in the fact that nudges are designed to help people overcome the cognitive limitations and biases that arise from their bounded rationality. Nudging involves designing choice architectures that guide people towards making better decisions without limiting their freedom of choice. The concept was popularized by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein in their 2008 book &quot;.&quot; As nudging has become more popular in the last decade, governments around the world and nongovernmental organizations like the United Nations have established behavioral insights teams or incorporated nudging into their policy-making processes.

One way nudges are used is with the aim of simplifying complex decisions by presenting information in a clear and easily understandable format, reducing the cognitive burden on individuals. Nudges can also be designed to counteract common heuristics and biases, such as the default bias (people&#x27;s tendency to stick with the default option). For example, with adequate other policies in place, making posthumous organ donation the default option with an opt-out provision has been shown to increase actual donation rates. Moreover, in cases where the information needed to make an informed decision is incomplete, nudges can provide the relevant information. For instance, displaying the calorie content of menu items can help people make healthier food choices. Nudges can also guide people towards satisfactory options when they are unable or unwilling to invest the time and effort to find the optimal choice. For example, providing a limited set of well-designed investment options in a retirement plan can help people make better financial decisions.

In economic models based on behavioral economics, implementing bounded rationality implies finding replacements for utility maximization and profit maximization as used in conventional general equilibrium models. Stock-flow consistent models (SFC) and agent-based models (ABM) often implement that agents follow a sequence of simple rule-of-thumb behavior instead of an optimization procedure. Other dynamic models interpret bounded rationality as “looking for the direction of improvement“ such that agents use a gradient climbing approach to increase their utility.

== Principles of boundedness ==
In addition to bounded rationality, bounded willpower and bounded selfishness are two other key concepts in behavioral economics that challenge the traditional neoclassical economic assumption of perfectly rational, self-interested, and self-disciplined individuals. 

Bounded willpower refers to the idea that people often have difficulty following through on their long-term plans and intentions due to limited self-control and the tendency to prioritize short-term desires. This can lead to problems like procrastination, impulsive spending, and unhealthy lifestyle choices. The concept of bounded willpower is closely related to the idea of hyperbolic discounting, which describes how people tend to value immediate rewards more highly than future ones, leading to inconsistent preferences over time.

While traditional economic models assume that people are primarily motivated by self-interest, bounded selfishness suggests that people also have social preferences and care about factors such as fairness, reciprocity, and the well-being of others. This concept helps explain phenomena like charitable giving, cooperation in social dilemmas, and the existence of social norms. However, people&#x27;s concern for others is often bounded in the sense that it is limited in scope and can be influenced by factors such as in-group favoritism and emotional distance.

Together, these three concepts form the core of behavioral economics and have been used to develop more realistic models of human decision-making and behavior. By recognizing the limitations and biases that people face in their daily lives, behavioral economists aim to design policies, institutions, and choice architectures that can help people make better decisions and achieve their long-term goals.

== In psychology ==
The collaborative works of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky expand upon Herbert A. Simon&#x27;s ideas in the attempt to create a map of bounded rationality. The research attempted to explore the choices made by what was assumed as rational agents compared to the choices made by individuals optimal beliefs and their satisficing behaviour. Kahneman cites that the research contributes mainly to the school of psychology due to imprecision of psychological research to fit the formal economic models; however, the theories are useful to economic theory as a way to expand simple and precise models and cover diverse psychological phenomena. Three major topics covered by the works of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky include heuristics of judgement, risky choice, and framing effect, which were a culmination of research that fit under what was defined by Herbert A. Simon as the psychology of bounded rationality. In contrast to the work of Simon; Kahneman and Tversky aimed to focus on the effects bounded rationality had on simple tasks which therefore placed more emphasis on errors in cognitive mechanisms irrespective of the situation. The study undertaken by Kahneman found that emotions and the psychology of economic decisions play a larger role in the economics field than originally thought. The study focused on the emotions behind decision making such as fear and personal likes and dislikes and found these to be significant factors in economic decision making.

Bounded rationality is also shown to be useful in negotiation techniques as shown in research undertaken by Dehai et al. that negotiations done using bounded rationality techniques by labourers and companies when negotiating a higher wage for workers were able to find an equal solution for both parties.

==Influence on social network structure==
Recent research has shown that bounded rationality of individuals may influence the topology of the social networks that evolve among them. In particular, Kasthurirathna and Piraveenan have shown that in socio-ecological systems, the drive towards improved rationality on average might be an evolutionary reason for the emergence of scale-free properties. They did this by simulating a number of strategic games on an initially random network with distributed bounded rationality, then re-wiring the network so that the network on average converged towards Nash equilibria, despite the bounded rationality of nodes. They observed that this re-wiring process results in scale-free networks. Since scale-free networks are ubiquitous in social systems, the link between bounded rationality distributions and social structure is an important one in explaining social phenomena.

<text>Satisficing is a decision-making strategy or cognitive heuristic that entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met, without necessarily maximizing any specific objective. The term &quot;satisficing&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;satisfy&quot; and &quot;suffice&quot;, was introduced by Herbert A. Simon in 1956, although the concept was first posited in his 1947 book &quot;Administrative Behavior&quot;. Simon used satisficing to explain the behavior of decision makers under circumstances in which an optimal solution cannot be determined. He maintained that many natural problems are characterized by computational intractability or a lack of information, both of which preclude the use of mathematical optimization procedures. He observed in his Nobel Prize in Economics speech that &quot;decision makers can satisfice either by finding optimum solutions for a simplified world, or by finding satisfactory solutions for a more realistic world. Neither approach, in general, dominates the other, and both have continued to co-exist in the world of management science&quot;.

Simon formulated the concept within a novel approach to rationality, which posits that rational choice theory is an unrealistic description of human decision processes and calls for psychological realism. He referred to this approach as bounded rationality. &quot;Moral satisficing&quot; is a branch of bounded rationality that views moral behavior as based on pragmatic social heuristics rather than on moral rules or optimization principles. These heuristics are neither good nor bad per se, but only in relation to the environments in which they are used. Some consequentialist theories in moral philosophy use the concept of satisficing in a similar sense, though most call for optimization instead.

== In decision-making research ==
Two traditions of satisficing exist in decision-making research: Simon&#x27;s program of studying how individuals or institutions rely on heuristic solutions in the real world, and the program of finding optimal solutions to problems simplified by convenient mathematical assumptions (so that optimization is possible).

=== Heuristic Satisficing ===
Heuristic satisficing refers to the use of aspiration levels when choosing from different paths of action. By this account, decision-makers select the first option that meets a given need or select the option that seems to address most needs rather than the &quot;optimal&quot; solution. The basic model of aspiration-level adaptation is as follows: 

Step 1: Set an aspiration level α.

Step 2: Choose the first option that meets or exceeds α.

Step 3: If no option has satisfied α after time β, then change α by an amount γ and continue until a satisfying option is found.Example: Consider pricing commodities. An analysis of 628 used car dealers showed that 97% relied on a form of satisficing. Most set the initial price α in the middle of the price range of comparable cars and lowered the price if the car was not sold after 24 days (β) by about 3% (γ). A minority (19%), mostly smaller dealerships, set a low initial price and kept it unchanged (no Step 3). The car dealers adapted the parameters to their business environment. For instance, they decreased the waiting time β by about 3% for each additional competitor in the area.Note that aspiration-level adaptation is a process model of actual behavior rather than an as-if optimization model, and accordingly requires an analysis of how people actually make decisions. It allows for predicting surprising effects such as the &quot;cheap twin paradox&quot;, where two similar cars have substantially different price tags in the same dealership.[4] The reason is that one car entered the dealership earlier and had at least one change in price at the time the second car arrived. 
:Example: A task is to sew a patch onto a pair of blue pants. The best needle to do the threading is a 4-cm-long needle with a 3-millimeter eye. This needle is hidden in a haystack along with 1,000 other needles varying in size from 1 cm to 6 cm. Satisficing claims that the first needle that can sew on the patch is the one that should be used. Spending time searching for that one specific needle in the haystack is a waste of energy and resources.

A crucial determinant of a satisficing decision strategy concerns the construction of the aspiration level. In many circumstances, the individual may be uncertain about the aspiration level.

:Example: An individual who only seeks a satisfactory retirement income may not know what level of wealth is required—given uncertainty about future prices—to ensure a satisfactory income. In this case, the individual can only evaluate outcomes on the basis of their probability of being satisfactory. If the individual chooses that outcome which has the maximum chance of being satisfactory, then this individual&#x27;s behavior is theoretically indistinguishable from that of an optimizing individual under certain conditions.

Another key issue concerns an evaluation of satisficing strategies. Although often regarded as an inferior decision strategy, specific satisficing strategies for inference have been shown to be ecologically rational, that is in particular decision environments, they can outperform alternative decision strategies.

Satisficing also occurs in consensus building when the group looks towards a solution everyone can agree on even if it may not be the best.
:Example: A group spends hours projecting the next fiscal year&#x27;s budget. After hours of debating they eventually reach a consensus, only to have one person speak up and ask if the projections are correct. When the group becomes upset at the question, it is not because this person is wrong to ask, but rather because the group has already come up with a solution that works. The projection may not be what will actually come, but the majority agrees on one number and thus the projection is good enough to close the book on the budget.

=== Optimization ===
One popular method for rationalizing satisficing is optimization when &quot;all&quot; costs, including the cost of the optimization calculations themselves and the cost of getting information for use in those calculations, are considered. As a result, the eventual choice is usually sub-optimal in regard to the main goal of the optimization, i.e., different from the optimum in the case that the costs of choosing are not taken into account.

==== As a form of optimization ====
Alternatively, satisficing can be considered to be just constraint satisfaction, the process of finding a solution satisfying a set of constraints, without concern for finding an optimum. Any such satisficing problem can be formulated as an (equivalent) optimization problem using the indicator function of the satisficing requirements as an objective function. More formally, if denotes the set of all options and denotes the set of &quot;satisficing&quot; options, then selecting a satisficing solution (an element of ) is equivalent to the following optimization problem

: formula_1

where denotes the Indicator function of , that is

:formula_2

A solution to this optimization problem is optimal if, and only if, it is a satisficing option (an element of ). Thus, from a decision theory point of view, the distinction between &quot;optimizing&quot; and &quot;satisficing&quot; is essentially a stylistic issue (that can nevertheless be very important in certain applications) rather than a substantive issue. What is important to determine is should be optimized and should be satisficed. The following quote from Jan Odhnoff&#x27;s 1965 paper is appropriate:

==== Applied to the utility framework ====
In economics, satisficing is a behavior which attempts to achieve at least some minimum level of a particular variable, but which does not necessarily maximize its value. The most common application of the concept in economics is in the behavioral theory of the firm, which, unlike traditional accounts, postulates that producers treat profit not as a goal to be maximized, but as a constraint. Under these theories, a critical level of profit must be achieved by firms; thereafter, priority is attached to the attainment of other goals.

More formally, as before if denotes the set of all options , and we have the payoff function which gives the payoff enjoyed by the agent for each option. Suppose we define the optimum payoff the solution to

:formula_3

with the optimum actions being the set &#x27; of options such that (i.e. it is the set of all options that yield the maximum payoff). Assume that the set &#x27; has at least one element.

The idea of the was introduced by Herbert A. Simon and developed in economics by Richard Cyert and James March in their 1963 book &quot;A Behavioral Theory of the Firm&quot;. The aspiration level is the payoff that the agent aspires to: if the agent achieves at least this level it is satisfied, and if it does not achieve it, the agent is not satisfied. Let us define the aspiration level and assume that . Clearly, whilst it is possible that someone can aspire to something that is better than the optimum, it is in a sense irrational to do so. So, we require the aspiration level to be at or below the optimum payoff.

We can then define the set of satisficing options &#x27; as all those options that yield at least &#x27;: . Clearly since , it follows that . That is, the set of optimum actions is a subset of the set of satisficing options. So, when an agent satisfices, then she will choose from a larger set of actions than the agent who optimizes. One way of looking at this is that the satisficing agent is not putting in the effort to get to the precise optimum or is unable to exclude actions that are below the optimum but still above aspiration.

An equivalent way of looking at satisficing is (that means you choose your actions so that the payoff is within epsilon of the optimum). If we define the &quot;gap&quot; between the optimum and the aspiration as &#x27; where . Then the set of satisficing options &#x27; can be defined as all those options such that .

==== Other applications in economics ====
Apart from the behavioral theory of the firm, applications of the idea of satisficing behavior in economics include the Akerlof and Yellen model of menu cost, popular in New Keynesian macroeconomics. Also, in economics and game theory there is the notion of an Epsilon-equilibrium, which is a generalization of the standard Nash equilibrium in which each player is within &#x27; of his or her optimal payoff (the standard Nash-equilibrium being the special case where &#x27;).

=== Endogenous aspiration levels ===
What determines the aspiration level may be derived from past experience (some function of an agent&#x27;s or firm&#x27;s previous payoffs), or some organizational or market institutions. For example, if we think of managerial firms, the managers will be expected to earn normal profits by their shareholders. Other institutions may have specific targets imposed externally (for example state-funded universities in the UK have targets for student recruitment).

An economic example is the Dixon model of an economy consisting of many firms operating in different industries, where each industry is a duopoly. The endogenous aspiration level is the average profit in the economy. This represents the power of the financial markets: in the long-run firms need to earn normal profits or they die (as Armen Alchian once said, &quot;This is the criterion by which the economic system selects survivors: those who realize positive profits are the survivors; those who suffer losses disappear&quot;). We can then think what happens over time. If firms are earning profits at or above their aspiration level, then they just stay doing what they are doing (unlike the optimizing firm which would always strive to earn the highest profits possible). However, if the firms are earning below aspiration, then they try something else, until they get into a situation where they attain their aspiration level. It can be shown that in this economy, satisficing leads to collusion amongst firms: competition between firms leads to lower profits for one or both of the firms in a duopoly. This means that competition is unstable: one or both of the firms will fail to achieve their aspirations and hence try something else. The only situation which is stable is one where all firms achieve their aspirations, which can only happen when all firms earn average profits. In general, this will only happen if all firms earn the joint-profit maximizing or collusive profit.

== In personality and happiness research ==

Some research has suggested that satisficing/maximizing and other decision-making strategies, like personality traits, have a strong genetic component and endure over time. This genetic influence on decision-making behaviors has been found through classical twin studies, in which decision-making tendencies are self-reported by each member of a twinned pair and then compared between monozygotic and dizygotic twins. This implies that people can be categorized into &quot;maximizers&quot; and &quot;satisficers&quot;, with some people landing in between.

The distinction between satisficing and maximizing not only differs in the decision-making process, but also in the post-decision evaluation. Maximizers tend to use a more exhaustive approach to their decision-making process: they seek and evaluate more options than satisficers do to achieve greater satisfaction. However, whereas satisficers tend to be relatively pleased with their decisions, maximizers tend to be less happy with their decision outcomes. This is thought to be due to limited cognitive resources people have when their options are vast, forcing maximizers to not make an optimal choice. Because maximization is unrealistic and usually impossible in everyday life, maximizers often feel regretful in their post-choice evaluation.

== In survey methodology ==
As an example of satisficing, in the field of social cognition, Jon Krosnick proposed a theory of statistical survey satisficing which says that optimal question answering by a survey respondent involves a great deal of cognitive work and that some people would use satisficing to reduce that burden.
Some people may shortcut their cognitive processes in two ways:
* Weak satisficing: Respondent executes all cognitive steps involved in optimizing, but less completely and with bias.
* Strong satisficing: Respondent offers responses that will seem reasonable to the interviewer without any memory search or information integration.

Likelihood to satisfice is linked to respondent ability, respondent motivation and task difficulty.

Regarding survey answers, satisficing manifests in:
* choosing explicitly offered no-opinion or &#x27;don&#x27;t know&#x27; response option
* choosing socially desirable responses
* non-differentiation or straight-lining when a battery of questions asks for ratings of multiple objects on the same response scale
* acquiescence response bias, which is the tendency to agree with any assertion, regardless of its content
* selecting the first reasonable looking option
* randomly selecting a response
* skipping items
* abandoning the survey or terminating the survey early
* rushing on online surveys
* choosing minimally acceptable answers when verbal answers are required

<text>Gestalt psychology, gestaltism, or configurationism is a school of psychology and a theory of perception that emphasises the processing of entire patterns and configurations, and not merely individual components. It emerged in the early twentieth century in Austria and Germany as a rejection of basic principles of Wilhelm Wundt&#x27;s and Edward Titchener&#x27;s elementalist and structuralist psychology.

Gestalt psychology is often associated with the adage, &quot;The whole is greater than the sum of its parts&quot;. In Gestalt theory, information is perceived as wholes rather than disparate parts which are then processed summatively. As used in Gestalt psychology, the German word &quot;Gestalt&quot; ( , ; meaning &quot;form&quot;) is interpreted as &quot;pattern&quot; or &quot;configuration&quot;.

It differs from Gestalt therapy, which is only peripherally linked to Gestalt psychology.

==Origin and history==
Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang Köhler founded Gestalt psychology in the early 20th century. The dominant view in psychology at the time was structuralism, exemplified by the work of Hermann von Helmholtz, Wilhelm Wundt, and Edward B. Titchener. Structuralism was rooted firmly in British empiricism and was based on three closely interrelated theories: 
#&quot;atomism,&quot; also known as &quot;elementalism,&quot; the view that all knowledge, even complex abstract ideas, is built from simple, elementary constituents
#&quot;sensationalism,&quot; the view that the simplest constituents—the atoms of thought—are elementary sense impressions
#&quot;associationism,&quot; the view that more complex ideas arise from the association of simpler ideas.
Together, these three theories give rise to the view that the mind constructs all perceptions and abstract thoughts strictly from lower-level sensations, which are related solely by being associated closely in space and time. The Gestaltists took issue with the widespread atomistic view that the aim of psychology should be to break consciousness down into putative basic elements.

In contrast, the Gestalt psychologists believed that breaking psychological phenomena down into smaller parts would not lead to understanding psychology. Instead, they viewed psychological phenomena as organized, structured wholes. They argued that the psychological &quot;whole&quot; has priority and that the &quot;parts&quot; are defined by the structure of the whole, rather than the other way round. Gestalt theories of perception are based on human nature being inclined to understand objects as an entire structure rather than the sum of its parts.

Wertheimer had been a student of Austrian philosopher, Christian von Ehrenfels, a member of the School of Brentano. Von Ehrenfels introduced the concept of Gestalt to philosophy and psychology in 1890, before the advent of Gestalt psychology as such. Von Ehrenfels observed that a perceptual experience, such as perceiving a melody or a shape, is more than the sum of its sensory components. He claimed that, in addition to the sensory elements of the perception, there is something additional that is an element in its own right, despite in some sense being derived from the organization of the component sensory elements. He called it &quot;Gestalt-qualität&quot; or &quot;form-quality.&quot; It is this &quot;Gestalt-qualität&quot; that, according to von Ehrenfels, allows a tune to be transposed to a new key, using completely different notes, while still retaining its identity. The idea of a &quot;Gestalt-qualität&quot; has roots in theories by David Hume, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Immanuel Kant, David Hartley, and Ernst Mach. Both von Ehrenfels and Edmund Husserl seem to have been inspired by Mach&#x27;s work &quot;Beiträge zur Analyse der Empfindungen&quot; (Contributions to the Analysis of Sensations, 1886), in formulating their very similar concepts of &quot;gestalt&quot; and &quot;figural moment&quot;, respectively. 

By 1914, the first published references to Gestalt theory could be found in a footnote of Gabriele von Wartensleben&#x27;s application of Gestalt theory to personality. She was a student at Frankfurt Academy for Social Sciences, who interacted deeply with Wertheimer and Köhler.

Through a series of experiments, Wertheimer discovered that a person observing a pair of alternating bars of light can, under the right conditions, experience the illusion of movement between one location and the other. He noted that this was a perception of motion absent any moving object. That is, it was pure phenomenal motion. He dubbed it phi (&quot;phenomenal&quot;) motion. Wertheimer&#x27;s publication of these results in 1912 marks the beginning of Gestalt psychology. In comparison to von Ehrenfels and others who had used the term &quot;gestalt&quot; earlier in various ways, Wertheimer&#x27;s unique contribution was to insist that the &quot;gestalt&quot; is perceptually primary. The gestalt defines the parts from which it is composed, rather than being a secondary quality that emerges from those parts. Wertheimer took the more radical position that one hears the melody first and only then may perceptually divide it up into notes. Similarly, in vision, one sees the form of the circle first, with its apprehension not mediated by a process of part-summation. Only after this primary apprehension might one notice that it is made up of lines or dots or stars.

The two men who served as Wertheimer&#x27;s subjects in the phi experiments were Köhler and Koffka. Köhler was an expert in physical acoustics, having studied under physicist Max Planck, but had taken his degree in psychology under Carl Stumpf. Koffka was also a student of Stumpf&#x27;s, having studied movement phenomena and psychological aspects of rhythm. In 1917, Köhler published the results of four years of research on learning in chimpanzees. Köhler showed, contrary to the claims of most other learning theorists, that animals can learn by &quot;sudden insight&quot; into the &quot;structure&quot; of a problem, over and above the associative and incremental manner of learning that Ivan Pavlov and Edward Lee Thorndike had demonstrated with dogs and cats, respectively.

In 1921, Koffka published a Gestalt-oriented text on developmental psychology, &quot;Growth of the Mind&quot;. With the help of American psychologist Robert Ogden, Koffka introduced the Gestalt point of view to an American audience in 1922 by way of a paper in &quot;Psychological Bulletin&quot;. It contains criticisms of then-current explanations of a number of problems of perception, and the alternatives offered by the Gestalt school. Koffka moved to the United States in 1924, eventually settling at Smith College in 1927. In 1935, Koffka published his &quot;Principles of Gestalt Psychology&quot;. This textbook laid out the &quot;Gestalt&quot; vision of the scientific enterprise as a whole. Science, he said, is not the simple accumulation of facts. What makes research scientific is the incorporation of facts into a theoretical structure. The goal of the &quot;Gestaltists&quot; was to integrate the facts of inanimate nature, life, and mind into a single scientific structure. This meant that science would have to accommodate not only what Koffka called the quantitative facts of physical science but the facts of two other &quot;scientific categories&quot;: questions of order and questions of &quot;Sinn&quot;, a German word which has been variously translated as significance, value, and meaning. Without incorporating the meaning of experience and behavior, Koffka believed that science would doom itself to trivialities in its investigation of human beings.

Having survived the Nazis up to the mid-1930s, all the core members of the Gestalt movement were forced out of Germany to the United States by 1935. Köhler published another book, &quot;Dynamics in Psychology&quot;, in 1940 but thereafter the &quot;Gestalt&quot; movement suffered a series of setbacks. Koffka died in 1941 and Wertheimer in 1943. Wertheimer&#x27;s long-awaited book on mathematical problem-solving, &quot;Productive Thinking,&quot; was published posthumously in 1945, but Köhler was left to guide the movement without his two long-time colleagues.

===Gestalt therapy===
Gestalt psychology differs from Gestalt therapy, which is only peripherally linked to Gestalt psychology. The founders of Gestalt therapy, Fritz and Laura Perls, had worked with Kurt Goldstein, a neurologist who had applied principles of Gestalt psychology to the functioning of the organism. Laura Perls had been a Gestalt psychologist before she became a psychoanalyst and before she began developing Gestalt therapy together with Fritz Perls. The extent to which Gestalt psychology influenced Gestalt therapy is disputed. On one hand, Laura Perls preferred not to use the term &quot;Gestalt&quot; to name the emerging new therapy, because she thought that the Gestalt psychologists would object to it; on the other hand, Fritz and Laura Perls clearly adopted some of Goldstein&#x27;s work. 

Mary Henle noted in her presidential address to Division 24 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association: &quot;What Perls has done has been to take a few terms from Gestalt psychology, stretch their meaning beyond recognition, mix them with notions—often unclear and often incompatible—from the depth psychologies, existentialism, and common sense, and he has called the whole mixture gestalt therapy. His work has no substantive relation to scientific Gestalt psychology. To use his own language, Fritz Perls has done &#x27;his thing&#x27;; whatever it is, it is &quot;not&quot; Gestalt psychology.&quot;

One form of psychotherapy that, unlike Gestalt therapy, is actually consistently based on Gestalt psychology is Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy.

== Theoretical framework and methodology ==
The Gestalt psychologists practiced a set of theoretical and methodological principles that attempted to redefine the approach to psychological research. This is in contrast to investigations developed at the beginning of the 20th century, based on traditional scientific methodology, which divided the object of study into a set of elements that could be analyzed separately with the objective of reducing the complexity of this object.

The principle of totality asserts that conscious experience must be considered globally by taking into account all the physical and mental aspects of the individual simultaneously, because the nature of the mind demands that each component be considered as part of a system of dynamic relationships. Thus, holism as fundamental aspect of Gestalt psychology. Moreover, the perception of the nature of a part depends upon the whole in which it is embedded. The maxim that the whole is more than the sum of its parts is not a precise description of the Gestaltist view. Rather, as Koffka writes, &quot;The whole is something else than the sum of its parts, because summing is a meaningless procedure, whereas the whole-part relationship is meaningful.&quot;

The principle of psychophysical isomorphism hypothesizes that there is a correlation between conscious experience and cerebral activity.

Based on the principles, phenomenon experimental analysis was derived, which asserts that any psychological research should take phenomena as a starting point and not be solely focused on sensory qualities. A related principle is that of the biotic experiment, which establishes the need to conduct real experiments that sharply contrasted with and opposed classic laboratory experiments. This signified experimenting in natural situations, developed in real conditions, in which it would be possible to reproduce, with higher fidelity, what would be habitual for a subject.
== Principles ==
The Gestaltists were the first to document and demonstrate empirically many facts about perception—including facts about the perception of movement, the perception of contour, perceptual constancy, and perceptual illusions. Wertheimer&#x27;s discovery of the phi phenomenon is one example of such a contribution.

===Properties===
The key principles of gestalt systems are emergence, reification, multistability and These principles are not necessarily separable modules to model individually, but they could be different aspects of a single unified dynamic mechanism.

====Reification====

Reification is the constructive or generative aspect of perception, by which the experienced object of perception contains more explicit spatial information than the sensory stimulus on which it is based. For instance, a triangle is perceived in picture A, though no triangle is there. In pictures B and D the eye recognizes disparate shapes as &quot;belonging&quot; to a single shape, in C a complete three-dimensional shape is seen, where in actuality no such thing is drawn.

Reification can be explained by progress in the study of illusory contours, which are treated by the visual system as &quot;real&quot; contours.

====Multistability====
Multistability (or multistable perception) is the tendency of ambiguous perceptual experiences to pop back and forth between two or more alternative interpretations. This is seen, for example, in the Necker cube and Rubin&#x27;s Figure/Vase illusion. Other examples include the three-legged blivet, artist M. C. Escher&#x27;s artwork, and the appearance of flashing marquee lights moving first one direction and then suddenly the other.

====Invariance====
Invariance is the property of perception whereby simple geometrical objects are recognized independent of rotation, translation, and scale, as well as several other variations such as elastic deformations, different lighting, and different component features. For example, the objects in A in the figure are all immediately recognized as the same basic shape, which is immediately distinguishable from the forms in B. They are even recognized despite perspective and elastic deformations as in C, and when depicted using different graphic elements as in D. Computational theories of vision, such as those by David Marr, have provided alternate explanations of how perceived objects are classified.

== Perceptual organisation forms ==

===&quot;Perceptual grouping&quot;===
Like figure-ground organization, perceptual grouping (sometimes called perceptual segregation) is a form of perceptual organization. Perceptual grouping is the process that determines how organisms perceive some parts of their perceptual fields as being more related than others, using such information for object detection. 

The Gestaltists were the first psychologists to systematically study perceptual grouping. According to Gestalt psychologists, the fundamental principle of perceptual grouping is the law of Prägnanz, also known as the law of good Gestalt. &quot;Prägnanz&quot; is a German word that directly translates to &quot;pithiness&quot; and implies salience, conciseness, and orderliness. The law of Prägnanz says that people tend to experience things as regular, orderly, symmetrical, and simple.

Gestalt psychologists attempted to discover refinements of the law of &quot;Prägnanz&quot;, which involved writing down laws that predict the interpretation of sensation. Wertheimer defined a few principles that explain the ways humans perceive objects based on similarity, proximity, and continuity. 

====Law of proximity====

The law of proximity states that when an individual perceives an assortment of objects, they perceive objects that are close to each other as forming a group. For example, in the figure illustrating the law of proximity, there are 72 circles, but we perceive the collection of circles in groups. Specifically, we perceive that there is a group of 36 circles on the left side of the image and three groups of 12 circles on the right side of the image. This law is often used in advertising logos to emphasize which aspects of events are associated.

====Law of similarity====

The law of similarity states that elements within an assortment of objects are perceptually grouped together if they are similar to each other. This similarity can occur in the form of shape, colour, shading or other qualities. For example, the figure illustrating the law of similarity portrays 36 circles all equal distance apart from one another forming a square. In this depiction, 18 of the circles are shaded dark, and 18 of the circles are shaded light. We perceive the dark circles as grouped together and the light circles as grouped together, forming six horizontal lines within the square of circles. This perception of lines is due to the law of similarity.

====Law of closure====

Gestalt psychologists believed that humans tend to perceive objects as complete rather than focusing on the gaps that the object might contain. For example, a circle has good Gestalt in terms of completeness. However, we will also perceive an incomplete circle as a complete circle. That tendency to complete shapes and figures is called closure. The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete. Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap. Research shows that the reason the mind completes a regular figure that is not perceived through sensation is to increase the regularity of surrounding stimuli. For example, the figure that depicts the law of closure portrays what we perceive as a circle on the left side of the image and a rectangle on the right side of the image. However, gaps are present in the shapes. If the law of closure did not exist, the image would depict an assortment of different lines with different lengths, rotations, and curvatures—but with the law of closure, we perceptually combine the lines into whole shapes.

====Law of symmetry====

The law of symmetry states that the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point. It is perceptually pleasing to divide objects into an even number of symmetrical parts. Therefore, when two symmetrical elements are unconnected the mind perceptually connects them to form a coherent shape. Similarities between symmetrical objects increase the likelihood that objects are grouped to form a combined symmetrical object. For example, the figure depicting the law of symmetry shows a configuration of square and curled brackets. When the image is perceived, we tend to observe three pairs of symmetrical brackets rather than six individual brackets.

====Law of common fate====
The law of common fate states that objects are perceived as lines that move along the smoothest path. Experiments using the visual sensory modality found that the movement of elements of an object produces paths that individuals perceive that the objects are on. We perceive elements of objects to have trends of motion, which indicate the path that the object is on. The law of continuity implies the grouping together of objects that have the same trend of motion and are therefore on the same path. For example, if there is an array of dots and half the dots are moving upward while the other half are moving downward, we would perceive the upward moving dots and the downward moving dots as two distinct units.

====Law of continuity====

The law of continuity (also known as the law of good continuation) states that elements of objects tend to be grouped together, and therefore integrated into perceptual wholes if they are aligned within an object. In cases where there is an intersection between objects, individuals tend to perceive the two objects as two single uninterrupted entities. Stimuli remain distinct even with overlap. We are less likely to group elements with sharp abrupt directional changes as being one object. For example, the figure depicting the law of continuity shows a configuration of two crossed keys. When the image is perceived, we tend to perceive the key in the background as a single uninterrupted key instead of two separate halves of a key.

====Law of past experience====
The law of past experience implies that under some circumstances visual stimuli are categorized according to past experience. If objects tend to be observed within close proximity, or small temporal intervals, the objects are more likely to be perceived together. For example, the English language contains 26 letters that are grouped to form words using a set of rules. If an individual reads an English word they have never seen, they use the law of past experience to interpret the letters &quot;L&quot; and &quot;I&quot; as two letters beside each other, rather than using the law of closure to combine the letters and interpret the object as an uppercase U.

====Music====
An example of the Gestalt movement in effect, as it is both a process and result, is a music sequence. People are able to recognise a sequence of perhaps six or seven notes, despite them being transposed into a different tuning or key. An early theory of gestalt grouping principles in music was composer-theorist James Tenney&#x27;s &quot;Meta+Hodos&quot; (1961). Auditory Scene Analysis as developed by Albert Bregman further extends a gestalt approach to the analysis of sound perception.

=== Figure-ground organization ===
Figure-ground organization is a form of perceptual organization, which interprets perceptual elements in terms of their shapes and relative locations in the layout of surfaces in the 3-D world. Figure-ground organization structures the perceptual field into a figure (standing out at the front of the perceptual field) and a background (receding behind the figure). Pioneering work on figure-ground organization was carried out by the Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin. The Gestalt psychologists demonstrated that people tend to perceive as figures those parts of our perceptual fields that are convex, symmetric, small, and enclosed.

== Problem solving and insight ==
Gestalt psychology contributed to the scientific study of problem solving. In fact, the early experimental work of the Gestaltists in Germany marks the beginning of the scientific study of problem solving. Later this experimental work continued through the 1960s and early 1970s with research conducted on relatively simple laboratory tasks of problem solving.

Max Wertheimer distinguished two kinds of thinking: productive thinking and reproductive thinking. &quot;Productive thinking&quot; is solving a problem based on insight—a quick, creative, unplanned response to situations and environmental interaction. &quot;Reproductive thinking&quot; is solving a problem deliberately based on previous experience and knowledge. Reproductive thinking proceeds algorithmically—a problem solver reproduces a series of steps from memory, knowing that they will lead to a solution—or by trial and error.

Karl Duncker, another Gestalt psychologist who studied problem solving, coined the term functional fixedness for describing the difficulties in both visual perception and problem solving that arise from the fact that one element of a whole situation already has a (fixed) function that has to be changed in order to perceive something or find the solution to a problem.

== Legacy ==

Gestalt psychology struggled to precisely define terms like Prägnanz, to make specific behavioural predictions, and to articulate testable models of underlying neural mechanisms. It was criticized as being merely descriptive. These shortcomings led, by the mid-20th century, to growing dissatisfaction with Gestaltism and a subsequent decline in its impact on psychology. Despite this decline, Gestalt psychology has formed the basis of much further research into the perception of patterns and objects and of research into behaviour, thinking, problem solving and psychopathology.

=== Support from cybernetics and neurology ===
In the 1940s and 1950s, laboratory research in neurology and what became known as cybernetics on the mechanism of frogs&#x27; eyes indicate that perception of &#x27;gestalts&#x27; (in particular gestalts &quot;in motion&quot;) is perhaps more primitive and fundamental than &#x27;seeing&#x27; as such:

:A frog hunts on land by vision... He has no fovea, or region of greatest acuity in vision, upon which he must centre a part of the image... The frog does not seem to see or, at any rate, is not concerned with the detail of stationary parts of the world around him. He will starve to death surrounded by food if it is not moving. His choice of food is determined only by size and movement. He will leap to capture any object the size of an insect or worm, providing it moves like one. He can be fooled easily not only by a piece of dangled meat but by any moving small object... He does remember a moving thing provided it stays within his field of vision and he is not distracted.

:The lowest-level concepts related to visual perception for a human being probably differ little from the concepts of a frog. In any case, the structure of the retina in mammals and in human beings is the same as in amphibians. The phenomenon of distortion of perception of an image stabilised on the retina gives some idea of the concepts of the subsequent levels of the hierarchy. This is a very interesting phenomenon. When a person looks at an immobile object, &quot;fixes&quot; it with his eyes, the eyeballs do not remain absolutely immobile; they make small involuntary movements. As a result, the image of the object on the retina is constantly in motion, slowly drifting and jumping back to the point of maximum sensitivity. The image &quot;marks time&quot; in the vicinity of this point.

=== Use in contemporary social psychology ===
The halo effect can be explained through the application of Gestalt theories to social information processing. The constructive theories of social cognition are applied to the expectations of individuals. They have been perceived in this manner and the person judging the individual is continuing to view them in this positive manner. Gestalt&#x27;s theories of perception enforces that individual&#x27;s tendency to perceive actions and characteristics as a whole rather than isolated parts, therefore humans are inclined to build a coherent and consistent impression of objects and behaviors in order to achieve an acceptable shape and form. The halo effect is what forms patterns for individuals, the halo effect being classified as a cognitive bias which occurs during impression formation. The halo effect can also be altered by physical characteristics, social status and many other characteristics. As well, the halo effect can have real repercussions on the individual&#x27;s perception of reality, either negatively or positively, meaning to construct negative or positive images about other individuals or situations, something that could lead to self-fulfilling prophesies, stereotyping, or even discrimination.

===Contemporary cognitive and perceptual psychology===

Some of the central criticisms of Gestaltism are based on the preference Gestaltists are deemed to have for theory over data, and a lack of quantitative research supporting Gestalt ideas. This is not necessarily a fair criticism as highlighted by a recent collection of quantitative research on Gestalt perception. Researchers continue to test hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying Gestalt principles such as the principle of similarity.

Other important criticisms concern the lack of definition and support for the many physiological assumptions made by gestaltists and lack of theoretical coherence in modern Gestalt psychology.

In some scholarly communities, such as cognitive psychology and computational neuroscience, gestalt theories of perception are criticized for being &quot;descriptive&quot; rather than &quot;explanatory&quot; in nature. For this reason, they are viewed by some as redundant or uninformative. For example, a textbook on visual perception states that, &quot;The physiological theory of the gestaltists has fallen by the wayside, leaving us with a set of descriptive principles, but without a model of perceptual processing. Indeed, some of their &#x27;laws&#x27; of perceptual organisation today sound vague and inadequate. What is meant by a &#x27;good&#x27; or &#x27;simple&#x27; shape, for example?&quot;

One historian of psychology, David J. Murray, has argued that Gestalt psychologists first discovered many principles later championed by cognitive psychology, including schemas and prototypes. Another psychologist has argued that the Gestalt psychologists made a lasting contribution by showing how the study of illusions can help scientists understand essential aspects of how the visual system &quot;normally&quot; functions, not merely how it breaks down.

===Use in design===
The gestalt laws are used in several visual design fields, such as user interface design and cartography. The laws of similarity and proximity can, for example, be used as guides for placing radio buttons. They may also be used in designing computers and software for more intuitive human use. Examples include the design and layout of a desktop&#x27;s shortcuts in rows and columns.

In map design, principles of Prägnanz or grouping are crucial for implying a conceptual order to the portrayed geographic features, thus facilitating the intended use of the map. The Law of Similarity is employed by selecting similar map symbols for similar kinds of features or features with similar properties; the Law of Proximity is crucial to identifying geographic patterns and regions; and the Laws of Closure and Continuity allow users to recognize features that may be obscured by other features (such as when a road goes over a river).

<doc id="70408" wikidata="Q4911496" url="?curid=70408" title="Bill Bissett">
<text>Bill Bissett (born William Frederick Bissett, born November 23, 1939), commonly known as bill bissett, is a Canadian poet known for his unconventional style especially regarding unusual orthography and the use of visual elements.

==Early life and education==
Bissett was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The son of a judge, Frederick William Bissett, Bissett had a tumultuous childhood, often ran away from home as a child, and developed peritonitis. Bissett faced several years of hospitalizations and also experienced bullying because of his sexuality, “I was trying to do as well as I could, and getting snowballs thrown at me with rocks in them because I was gay and I was getting beaten up and having really no friends.”

He attended Dalhousie University (1956) and the University of British Columbia (1963–1965). After completing course requirements for his two majors in English and Philosophy, Bissett dropped out of both universities to avoid academic constraints.

In 1962, he had one child with partner Martina Clinton, Ooljah Bissett (whom later in life changed her name to Michelle), who died in 2012 from an unknown illness.

==Career==
Bissett moved to Vancouver, British Columbia in 1958. In 1962, he started &quot;blewointment&quot; magazine. He later launched blewointmentpress, which has published volumes by Cathy Ford, Maxine Gadd, Michael Coutts, Dick Clements writing under the pen name, &quot;p.x. belinsky&quot;, Hart Broudy, Rosemary Hollingshead, Beth Jankola, Carolyn Zonailo, bpNichol, Ken West, Lionel Kearns and D. A. Levy.

In 1965, a CBC documentary by Maurice Embra was filmed of Bissett, entitled Strange Grey Day This, the documentary is one of the earliest known documentations of Bissett&#x27;s poetry and art.

In 1968, Bissett collaborated with experimental rock group Th Mandan Massacre to release a spoken word album, &quot;Awake In The Red Desert,&quot; in a limited edition of 500 copies&quot;.&quot; The album became a highly sought after collector&#x27;s item, until reissued by Feeding Tube Records in 2019. In 1969, having performed earlier in the evening at a concrete poetry show, Bissett fell through a folding door that was supposed to be latched shut and plummeted 20 feet to a basement concrete floor, severely injuring his head. Bissett suffered brain damage, and was rendered catatonic and paralyzed. A two-year court case was won by the insurance company and Bissett never received any compensation.

In 1977, Bob Wenman and a group of other Conservative Members of Parliament objected to the funding of some Canadian poets, Bill Bissett in particular, by the Canadian Council for the Arts, on moral grounds. Wenman, when speaking to Jean Chrétien (then a Minister of Finance), described Bissett&#x27;s work as &quot;disgusting and pornographic.&quot; While in Parliament, Wenman requested that Bissett&#x27;s literary work be read into the record, but his request was denied by the Speaker as not relevant.

After Wenman&#x27;s accusations in 1977, and until June 1978, Bissett received no funding from Canadian Council grants, although there is no clear indication that Wenman&#x27;s allegations were the cause of this. Indeed, according to Frank Davey, a Canadian poet and scholar, by as early as 1974, Bissett had been &quot;ejected from cross-Canada trains, evicted by countless landlords, beaten, harassed by police, and arrested and sentenced to prison.&quot;

In 1983, financial hardship, plus a desire to focus on his own writing and visual art, led him to sell blewointment press (which later became Nightwood Editions). Bissett moved to London, Ontario in 1985. From 1986 to 1991, Bissett was the lyricist and vocalist in the London, Ontario band Luddites, they released several demo cassettes and an LP. They disbanded in 1991, but released a compilation of their works in 2007. Following constant harassment from law enforcement in London, Bissett moved to Toronto, Ontario in 1992, where he currently resides.

In 2006, Nightwood Editions published &quot;radiant danse uv being&quot;, a poetic tribute to Bissett with contributions from more than 80 writers, including Margaret Atwood, Leonard Cohen, Lorna Crozier, Patrick Lane, Steve McCaffery, P. K. Page and Darren Wershler-Henry. In 2006 he was also featured in an episode of the television series &quot;Heart of a Poet&quot; produced by Canadian filmmaker Maureen Judge.

Bissett&#x27;s sound poetry was sampled by The Chemical Brothers on their 2007 CD &quot;We Are the Night&quot;. The CD title was taken from Bissett&#x27;s &quot;Ode To D.A. Levy&quot;. The CD went #1 in the UK and North American Electronic Music Charts.

In 2007, Bissett was awarded the George Woodcock Lifetime Achievement Award for outstanding contributions to literature in British Columbia. The following year, he was given an Honorary Doctorate in Literature from Thompson Rivers University.

In 2015, &quot;Th ground is a prspektiv&quot; by Bissett was once again sampled by The Chemical Brothers, this time for their album Born in the Echoes in &quot;I&#x27;ll See You There&quot;.

In 2019, an anthology of poems from nearly every previously published Bissett book, entitled &quot;breth&quot; was published through Talonbooks. &quot;breth&quot; features hundreds of poems dating as early as the late 1950s, to as recent as the late 2010s. Bissett is now based in Toronto.

Bissett is known in Toronto as a peer support worker and is the treasurer of the schizophrenia peer support group The Secret Handshake founded in 2004, by Bissett and Jordan Stone.

In June 2024, he was appointed to the Order of Canada. In July 2024, a compilation album of previously unreleased or out of print sound recordings of Bill Bissett’s poetry entitled ‘’circulin th moon’’ was independently released digitally on Bissett’s Bandcamp page.

==Art and poetry==
Bissett uses unusual orthography and incorporates visual elements in his printed poetry, and his performance of &quot;concrete sound&quot; poetry, sound effects, chanting, barefoot dancing and playing a maraca during his poetry readings. Frank Davey described him as &quot;rejecting the conventional or &#x27;straight&#x27; world [...] not only in lifestyle but in ruthless alterations to conventional syntax and spelling.&quot; Themes in his work range from the mystical to the mundane, incorporating humour, sentimentality, and political commentary. He often does not capitalise his name or use capital letters. He has had large exhibits of his paintings. In &quot;the Paris Review&quot;, Jack Kerouac called Bill Bissett one of &quot;the great poets.&quot;

<doc id="70421" wikidata="Q105955" url="?curid=70421" title="Elo rating system">
<text>The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games such as chess or esports. It is named after its creator Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-American physics professor.

The Elo system was invented as an improved chess-rating system over the previously used Harkness system, but is also used as a rating system in association football (soccer), American football, baseball, basketball, pool, various board games and esports, and, more recently, large language models.

The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent&#x27;s is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%.

A player&#x27;s Elo rating is a number that may change depending on the outcome of rated games played. After every game, the winning player takes points from the losing one. The difference between the ratings of the winner and loser determines the total number of points gained or lost after a game. If the higher-rated player wins, then only a few rating points will be taken from the lower-rated player. However, if the lower-rated player scores an upset win, many rating points will be transferred. The lower-rated player will also gain a few points from the higher rated player in the event of a draw. This means that this rating system is self-correcting. Players whose ratings are too low or too high should, in the long run, do better or worse correspondingly than the rating system predicts and thus gain or lose rating points until the ratings reflect their true playing strength.

Elo ratings are comparative only, and are valid only within the rating pool in which they were calculated, rather than being an absolute measure of a player&#x27;s strength.

While Elo-like systems are widely used in two-player settings, variations have also been applied to multiplayer competitions.

==History==
Arpad Elo was a chess master and an active participant in the United States Chess Federation (USCF) from its founding in 1939. The USCF used a numerical ratings system devised by Kenneth Harkness to enable members to track their individual progress in terms other than tournament wins and losses. The Harkness system was reasonably fair, but in some circumstances gave rise to ratings many observers considered inaccurate. 

On behalf of the USCF, Elo devised a new system with a more sound statistical basis. At about the same time, György Karoly and Roger Cook independently developed a system based on the same principles for the New South Wales Chess Association.

Elo&#x27;s system replaced earlier systems of competitive rewards with a system based on statistical estimation. Rating systems for many sports award points in accordance with subjective evaluations of the &#x27;greatness&#x27; of certain achievements. For example, winning an important golf tournament might be worth an arbitrarily chosen five times as many points as winning a lesser tournament.

A statistical endeavor, by contrast, uses a model that relates the game results to underlying variables representing the ability of each player.

Elo&#x27;s central assumption was that the chess performance of each player in each game is a normally distributed random variable. Although a player might perform significantly better or worse from one game to the next, Elo assumed that the mean value of the performances of any given player changes only slowly over time. Elo thought of a player&#x27;s true skill as the mean of that player&#x27;s performance random variable.

A further assumption is necessary because chess performance in the above sense is still not measurable. One cannot look at a sequence of moves and derive a number to represent that player&#x27;s skill. Performance can only be inferred from wins, draws, and losses. Therefore, a player who wins a game is assumed to have performed at a higher level than the opponent for that game. Conversely, a losing player is assumed to have performed at a lower level. If the game ends in a draw, the two players are assumed to have performed at nearly the same level.

Elo did not specify exactly how close two performances ought to be to result in a draw as opposed to a win or loss. Actually, there is a probability of a draw that is dependent on the performance differential, so this latter is more of a confidence interval than any deterministic frontier. And while he thought it was likely that players might have different standard deviations to their performances, he made a simplifying assumption to the contrary.

To simplify computation even further, Elo proposed a straightforward method of estimating the variables in his model (i.e., the true skill of each player). One could calculate relatively easily from tables how many games players would be expected to win based on comparisons of their ratings to those of their opponents. The ratings of a player who won more games than expected would be adjusted upward, while those of a player who won fewer than expected would be adjusted downward. Moreover, that adjustment was to be in linear proportion to the number of wins by which the player had exceeded or fallen short of their expected number.

From a modern perspective, Elo&#x27;s simplifying assumptions are not necessary because computing power is inexpensive and widely available. Several people, most notably Mark Glickman, have proposed using more sophisticated statistical machinery to estimate the same variables. On the other hand, the computational simplicity of the Elo system has proven to be one of its greatest assets. With the aid of a pocket calculator, an informed chess competitor can calculate to within one point what their next officially published rating will be, which helps promote a perception that the ratings are fair.

=== Implementing Elo&#x27;s scheme ===
The USCF implemented Elo&#x27;s suggestions in 1960, and the system quickly gained recognition as being both fairer and more accurate than the Harkness rating system. Elo&#x27;s system was adopted by the World Chess Federation (FIDE) in 1970. Elo described his work in detail in &quot;The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present&quot;, first published in 1978.

Subsequent statistical tests have suggested that chess performance is almost certainly not distributed as a normal distribution, as weaker players have greater winning chances than Elo&#x27;s model predicts. In paired comparison data, there is often very little practical difference in whether it is assumed that the differences in players&#x27; strengths are normally or logistically distributed. Mathematically, however, the logistic function is more convenient to work with than the normal distribution.
FIDE continues to use the rating difference table as proposed by Elo.

The development of the Percentage Expectancy Table (table 2.11) is described in more detail by Elo as follows:

The normal probabilities may be taken directly from the standard
tables of the areas under the normal curve when the difference in rating is
expressed as a z score. Since the standard deviation σ of individual
performances is defined as 200 points, the standard deviation σ&#x27; of the
differences in performances becomes σ√2 or 282.84. The z value of a
difference then is . This will then divide the area under the
curve into two parts, the larger giving P for the higher rated player and
the smaller giving P for the lower rated player.

For example, let . Then . The table
gives and as the areas of the two portions under the curve.
These probabilities are rounded to two figures in table 2.11.
The table is actually built with standard deviation as an approximation for .

The normal and logistic distributions are, in a way, arbitrary points in a spectrum of distributions which would work well. In practice, both of these distributions work very well for a number of different games.

== Different ratings systems ==
The phrase &quot;Elo rating&quot; is often used to mean a player&#x27;s chess rating as calculated by FIDE. However, this usage may be confusing or misleading because Elo&#x27;s general ideas have been adopted by many organizations, including the USCF (before FIDE), many other national chess federations, the short-lived Professional Chess Association (PCA), and online chess servers including the Internet Chess Club (ICC), Free Internet Chess Server (FICS), Lichess, Chess.com, and Yahoo! Games. Each organization has a unique implementation, and none of them follows Elo&#x27;s original suggestions precisely.

Instead one may refer to the organization granting the rating. For example: &quot;As of April 2018, Tatev Abrahamyan had a FIDE rating of 2366 and a USCF rating of 2473.&quot; The Elo ratings of these various organizations are not directly comparable, since Elo ratings measure the results within a closed pool of players rather than absolute skill.

===FIDE ratings===
For top players, the most important rating is their FIDE rating. FIDE has issued the following lists:
* From 1971 to 1980, one list a year was issued.
* From 1981 to 2000, two lists a year were issued, in January and July.
* From July 2000 to July 2009, four lists a year were issued, at the start of January, April, July and October.
* From July 2009 to July 2012, six lists a year were issued, at the start of January, March, May, July, September and November.
* Since July 2012, the list has been updated monthly.

The following analysis of the July 2015 FIDE rating list gives a rough impression of what a given FIDE rating means in terms of world ranking:
* 5,323 players had an active rating in the range 2200 to 2299, which is usually associated with the Candidate Master title.
* 2,869 players had an active rating in the range 2300 to 2399, which is usually associated with the FIDE Master title.
* 1,420 players had an active rating between 2400 and 2499, most of whom had either the International Master or the International Grandmaster title.
* 542 players had an active rating between 2500 and 2599, most of whom had the International Grandmaster title.
* 187 players had an active rating between 2600 and 2699, all of whom had the International Grandmaster title.
* 40 players had an active rating between 2700 and 2799. 
* 4 players had an active rating of over 2800. (Magnus Carlsen was rated 2853, and 3 players were rated between 2814 and 2816). 
The highest ever FIDE rating was 2882, which Magnus Carlsen had on the May 2014 list. A list of the highest-rated players ever is at Comparison of top chess players throughout history.

====Performance rating====

Performance rating or special rating is a hypothetical rating that would result from the games of a single event only. Some chess organizations use the &quot;algorithm of 400&quot; to calculate performance rating. According to this algorithm, performance rating for an event is calculated in the following way:
# For each win, add your opponent&#x27;s rating plus 400, 
# For each loss, add your opponent&#x27;s rating minus 400, 
# And divide this sum by the number of played games.

Example: 2 wins (opponents &amp; ), 2 losses (opponents &amp; )

:formula_1
This can be expressed by the following formula:
:formula_2
Example: If you beat a player with an Elo rating of 1000,
:formula_3
If you beat two players with Elo ratings of 1000,
:formula_4
If you draw,
:formula_5

This is a simplification, but it offers an easy way to get an estimate of PR (performance rating).

FIDE, however, calculates performance rating by means of the formulaformula_6where &quot;rating difference&quot; formula_7 is based on a player&#x27;s tournament percentage score formula_8, which is then used as the key in a lookup table where formula_8 is simply the number of points scored divided by the number of games played. Note that, in case of a perfect or no score formula_7 is 800.
===Live ratings===
FIDE updates its ratings list at the beginning of each month. In contrast, the unofficial &quot;Live ratings&quot; calculate the change in players&#x27; ratings after every game. These Live ratings are based on the previously published FIDE ratings, so a player&#x27;s Live rating is intended to correspond to what the FIDE rating would be if FIDE were to issue a new list that day.

Although Live ratings are unofficial, interest arose in Live ratings in August/September 2008 when five different players took the &quot;Live&quot; No. 1 ranking.

The unofficial live ratings of players over 2700 were published and maintained by Hans Arild Runde at the Live Rating website until August 2011. Another website, 2700chess.com, has been maintained since May 2011 by Artiom Tsepotan, which covers the top 100 players as well as the top 50 female players.

Rating changes can be calculated manually by using the FIDE ratings change calculator. All top players have a K-factor of 10, which means that the maximum ratings change from a single game is a little less than 10 points.

=== United States Chess Federation ratings ===
The United States Chess Federation (USCF) uses its own classification of players:
*2400 and above: Senior Master
*2200–2399: National Master
**2200–2399 plus 300 games above 2200: Original Life Master
*2000–2199: Expert or Candidate Master
*1800–1999: Class A
*1600–1799: Class B
*1400–1599: Class C
*1200–1399: Class D
*1000–1199: Class E
*800–999: Class F
*600–799: Class G
*400–599: Class H
*200–399: Class I
*100–199: Class J

====The K-factor used by the USCF====
The &quot;K-factor&quot;, in the USCF rating system, can be estimated by dividing 800 by the effective number of games a player&#x27;s rating is based on () plus the number of games the player completed in a tournament ().
: formula_11

====Rating floors====
The USCF maintains an absolute rating floor of 100 for all ratings. Thus, no member can have a rating below 100, no matter their performance at USCF-sanctioned events. However, players can have higher individual absolute rating floors, calculated using the following formula:
:formula_12

where formula_13 is the number of rated games won, formula_14 is the number of rated games drawn, and formula_15 is the number of events in which the player completed three or more rated games.

Higher rating floors exist for experienced players who have achieved significant ratings. Such higher rating floors exist, starting at ratings of 1200 in 100-point increments up to 2100 (1200, 1300, 1400, ..., 2100). A rating floor is calculated by taking the player&#x27;s peak established rating, subtracting 200 points, and then rounding down to the nearest rating floor. For example, a player who has reached a peak rating of 1464 would have a rating floor of , which would be rounded down to 1200. Under this scheme, only Class C players and above are capable of having a higher rating floor than their absolute player rating. All other players would have a floor of at most 150.

There are two ways to achieve higher rating floors other than under the standard scheme presented above. If a player has achieved the rating of Original Life Master, their rating floor is set at 2200. The achievement of this title is unique in that no other recognized USCF title will result in a new floor. For players with ratings below 2000, winning a cash prize of $2,000 or more raises that player&#x27;s rating floor to the closest 100-point level that would have disqualified the player for participation in the tournament. For example, if a player won $4,000 in a 1750-and-under tournament, they would now have a rating floor of 1800.

==Theory==
Pairwise comparisons form the basis of the Elo rating methodology. Elo made references to the papers of Good, David, Trawinski and David, and Buhlman and Huber.

=== Mathematical details ===
Performance is not measured absolutely; it is inferred from wins, losses, and draws against other players. Players&#x27; ratings depend on the ratings of their opponents and the results scored against them. The difference in rating between two players determines an estimate for the expected score between them. Both the average and the spread of ratings can be arbitrarily chosen. The USCF initially aimed for an average club player to have a rating of 1500 and Elo suggested scaling ratings so that a difference of 200 rating points in chess would mean that the stronger player has an &quot;expected score&quot; of approximately 0.75.

A player&#x27;s &quot;expected score&quot; is their probability of winning plus half their probability of drawing. Thus, an expected score of 0.75 could represent a 75% chance of winning, 25% chance of losing, and 0% chance of drawing. On the other extreme it could represent a 50% chance of winning, 0% chance of losing, and 50% chance of drawing. The probability of drawing, as opposed to having a decisive result, is not specified in the Elo system. Instead, a draw is considered half a win and half a loss. In practice, since the true strength of each player is unknown, the expected scores are calculated using the player&#x27;s current ratings as follows.

If player  has a rating of formula_16 and player  a rating of formula_17, the exact formula (using the logistic curve with base 10) for the expected score of player  is

:formula_18

Similarly, the expected score for player  is

:formula_19

This could also be expressed by

:formula_20

and

:formula_21

where formula_22 and formula_23 Note that in the latter case, the same denominator applies to both expressions, and it is plain that formula_24 This means that by studying only the numerators, we find out that the expected score for player  is formula_25 times the expected score for player . It then follows that for each 400 rating points of advantage over the opponent, the expected score is magnified ten times in comparison to the opponent&#x27;s expected score.

When a player&#x27;s actual tournament scores exceed their expected scores, the Elo system takes this as evidence that player&#x27;s rating is too low, and needs to be adjusted upward. Similarly, when a player&#x27;s actual tournament scores fall short of their expected scores, that player&#x27;s rating is adjusted downward. Elo&#x27;s original suggestion, which is still widely used, was a simple linear adjustment proportional to the amount by which a player over-performed or under-performed their expected score. The maximum possible adjustment per game, called the K-factor, was set at formula_26 for masters and formula_27 for weaker players.

Suppose player  (again with rating formula_28) was expected to score formula_29 points but actually scored formula_30 points. The formula for updating that player&#x27;s rating is

:formula_31

This update can be performed after each game or each tournament, or after any suitable rating period.

An example may help to clarify:
This updating procedure is at the core of the ratings used by FIDE, USCF, Yahoo! Games, the Internet Chess Club (ICC) and the Free Internet Chess Server (FICS). However, each organization has taken a different approach to dealing with the uncertainty inherent in the ratings, particularly the ratings of newcomers, and to dealing with the problem of ratings inflation/deflation. New players are assigned provisional ratings, which are adjusted more drastically than established ratings.

The principles used in these rating systems can be used for rating other competitions—for instance, international football matches.

Elo ratings have also been applied to games without the possibility of draws, and to games in which the result can also have a quantity (small/big margin) in addition to the quality (win/loss). See Go rating with Elo for more.

==== Suggested modification ====
In 2011 after analyzing 1.5 million FIDE rated games, Jeff Sonas demonstrated according to the Elo formula, two players having a rating difference of actually have a true difference of around . Likewise, one can leave the rating difference alone and divide by 480 instead of 400. Since the Elo formula is overestimating the stronger player&#x27;s win probability, stronger players are losing points against weaker players despite playing at their true strength. Likewise, weaker players gain points against stronger players. When the modification is applied, observed win rates deviate by less than 0.1% away from prediction, while traditional Elo can be 4% off the predicted rate. 

==== Most accurate distribution model ====
The first mathematical concern addressed by the USCF was the use of the normal distribution. They found that this did not accurately represent the actual results achieved, particularly by the lower rated players. Instead they switched to a logistic distribution model, which the USCF found provided a better fit for the actual results achieved. FIDE also uses an approximation to the logistic distribution.

==== Most accurate K-factor ====
The second major concern is the correct &quot;-factor&quot; used. The chess statistician Jeff Sonas believes that the original formula_32 value (for players rated above 2400) is inaccurate in Elo&#x27;s work. If the -factor coefficient is set too large, there will be too much sensitivity to just a few, recent events, in terms of a large number of points exchanged in each game. And if the K-value is too low, the sensitivity will be minimal, and the system will not respond quickly enough to changes in a player&#x27;s actual level of performance.

Elo&#x27;s original -factor estimation was made without the benefit of huge databases and statistical evidence. Sonas indicates that a -factor of 24 (for players rated above 2400) may be both more accurate as a predictive tool of future performance and be more sensitive to performance.

Certain Internet chess sites seem to avoid a three-level K-factor staggering based on rating range. For example, the ICC seems to adopt a global except when playing against provisionally rated players.

The USCF (which makes use of a logistic distribution as opposed to a normal distribution) formerly staggered the K-factor according to three main rating ranges:

Currently, the USCF uses a formula that calculates the -factor based on factors including the number of games played and the player&#x27;s rating. The K-factor is also reduced for high rated players if the event has shorter time controls.

FIDE uses the following ranges:

FIDE used the following ranges before July 2014:

The gradation of the -factor reduces rating change at the top end of the rating range, reducing the possibility for rapid rise or fall of rating for those with a rating high enough to reach a low -factor.

In theory, this might apply equally to online chess players and over-the-board players, since it is more difficult for all players to raise their rating after their rating has become high and their -factor consequently reduced. However, when playing online, 2800+ players can more easily raise their rating by simply selecting opponents with high ratings – on the ICC playing site, a grandmaster may play a string of different opponents who are all rated over 2700. In over-the-board events, it would only be in very high level all-play-all events that a player would be able to engage that number of 2700+ opponents. In a normal, open, Swiss-paired chess tournament, frequently there would be many opponents rated less than 2500, reducing the ratings gains possible from a single contest for a high-rated player.

=== Formal derivation for win/loss games ===
The above expressions can be now formally derived by exploiting the link between the Elo rating and the stochastic gradient update in the logistic regression.

If we assume that the game results are binary, that is, only a win or a loss can be observed, the problem can be addressed via logistic regression, where the games results are dependent variables, the players&#x27; ratings are independent variables, and the model relating both is probabilistic: the probability of the player formula_33 winning the game is modeled as

:formula_34

where

:formula_35

denotes the difference of the players&#x27; ratings, and we use a scaling factor formula_36, and, by law of total probability

:formula_37

The log loss is then calculated as

:formula_38

and, using the stochastic gradient descent the log loss is minimized as follows:

:formula_39,

:formula_40.

where formula_41 is the adaptation step.

Since formula_42, formula_43, and formula_44, the adaptation is then written as follows

:formula_45

which may be compactly written as

:formula_46

where formula_47 is the new adaptation step which absorbs formula_48 and formula_49, formula_50 if formula_51 wins and formula_52 if formula_53 wins, and the expected score is given by formula_54.

Analogously, the update for the rating formula_55 is

:formula_56.

=== Formal derivation for win/draw/loss games ===

Since the very beginning, the Elo rating has been also used in chess where we observe wins, losses or draws and, to deal with the latter a fractional score value, formula_57, is introduced. We note, however, that the scores formula_58 and formula_59 are merely indicators to the events when the player formula_33 wins or loses the game. It is, therefore, not immediately clear what is the meaning of the fractional score. Moreover, since we do not specify explicitly the model relating the rating values formula_61 and formula_62 to the probability of the game outcome, we cannot say what the probability of the win, the loss, or the draw is.

To address these difficulties, and to derive the Elo rating in the ternary games, we will define the explicit probabilistic model of the outcomes. Next, we will minimize the log loss via stochastic gradient.

Since the loss, the draw, and the win are ordinal variables, we should adopt the model which takes their ordinal nature into account, and we use the so-called adjacent categories model which may be traced to the Davidson&#x27;s work

:formula_63

:formula_64

:formula_65

where

:formula_66

and formula_67 is a parameter. Introduction of a free parameter should not be surprising as we have three possible outcomes and thus, an additional degree of freedom should appear in the model. In particular, with formula_68 we recover the model underlying the logistic regression

:formula_69

where formula_70.

Using the ordinal model defined above, the log loss is now calculated as

:formula_71

which may be compactly written as

:formula_72

where formula_58 iff formula_33 wins, formula_75 iff formula_76 wins, and formula_77 iff formula_33 draws.

As before, we need the derivative of formula_79 which is given by

:formula_80,

where

:formula_81

Thus, the derivative of the log loss with respect to the rating formula_61 is given by

:formula_83

where we used the relationships formula_84 and formula_85.

Then, the stochastic gradient descent applied to minimize the log loss yields the following update for the rating formula_61

:formula_87

where formula_88 and formula_89. Of course, formula_90 if formula_91 wins, formula_92 if formula_91 draws, and formula_94 if formula_91 loses. To recognize the origin in the model proposed by Davidson, this update is called an Elo-Davidson rating.

The update for formula_62 is derived in the same manner as

:formula_97,

where formula_98.

We note that

:formula_99

and thus, we obtain the rating update may be written as

:formula_100,

where formula_101 and we obtained practically the same equation as in the Elo rating except that the expected score is given by formula_102 instead of formula_103.

Of course, as noted above, for formula_68, we have formula_105 and thus, the Elo-Davidson rating is exactly the same as the Elo rating. However, this is of no help to understand the case when the draws are observed (we cannot use formula_106 which would mean that the probability of draw is null). On the other hand, if we use formula_107, we have

:formula_108

which means that, using formula_107, the Elo-Davidson rating is exactly the same as the Elo rating.

== Practical issues ==

=== Game activity versus protecting one&#x27;s rating ===
In some cases the rating system can discourage game activity for players who wish to protect their rating. In order to discourage players from sitting on a high rating, a 2012 proposal by British Grandmaster John Nunn for choosing qualifiers to the chess world championship included an activity bonus, to be combined with the rating.

Beyond the chess world, concerns over players avoiding competitive play to protect their ratings caused Wizards of the Coast to abandon the Elo system for &quot;&quot; tournaments in favour of a system of their own devising called &quot;Planeswalker Points&quot;.

=== Selective pairing ===

A more subtle issue is related to pairing. When players can choose their own opponents, they can choose opponents with minimal risk of losing, and maximum reward for winning. Particular examples of players rated 2800+ choosing opponents with minimal risk and maximum possibility of rating gain include: choosing opponents that they know they can beat with a certain strategy; choosing opponents that they think are overrated; or avoiding playing strong players who are rated several hundred points below them, but may hold chess titles such as IM or GM. In the category of choosing overrated opponents, new entrants to the rating system who have played fewer than 50 games are in theory a convenient target as they may be overrated in their provisional rating. The ICC compensates for this issue by assigning a lower K-factor to the established player if they do win against a new rating entrant. The K-factor is actually a function of the number of rated games played by the new entrant.

Therefore, Elo ratings online still provide a useful mechanism for providing a rating based on the opponent&#x27;s rating. Its overall credibility, however, needs to be seen in the context of at least the above two major issues described—engine abuse, and selective pairing of opponents.

The ICC has also recently introduced &quot;auto-pairing&quot; ratings which are based on random pairings, but with each win in a row ensuring a statistically much harder opponent who has also won x games in a row. With potentially hundreds of players involved, this creates some of the challenges of a major large Swiss event which is being fiercely contested, with round winners meeting round winners. This approach to pairing certainly maximizes the rating risk of the higher-rated participants, who may face very stiff opposition from players below 3000, for example. This is a separate rating in itself, and is under &quot;1-minute&quot; and &quot;5-minute&quot; rating categories. Maximum ratings achieved over 2500 are exceptionally rare.

=== Ratings inflation and deflation ===
The term &quot;inflation&quot;, applied to ratings, is meant to suggest that the level of playing strength demonstrated by the rated player is decreasing over time; conversely, &quot;deflation&quot; suggests that the level is advancing. For example, if there is inflation, a modern rating of 2500 means less than a historical rating of 2500, while the reverse is true if there is deflation. Using ratings to compare players between different eras is made more difficult when inflation or deflation are present. (See also Comparison of top chess players throughout history.)

Analyzing FIDE rating lists over time, Jeff Sonas suggests that inflation may have taken place since about 1985. Sonas looks at the highest-rated players, rather than all rated players, and acknowledges that the changes in the distribution of ratings could have been caused by an increase of the standard of play at the highest levels, but looks for other causes as well.

The number of people with ratings over 2700 has increased. Around 1979 there was only one active player (Anatoly Karpov) with a rating this high. In 1992 Viswanathan Anand was only the 8th player in chess history to reach the 2700 mark at that point of time. This increased to 15 players by 1994. 33 players had a 2700+ rating in 2009 and 44 as of September 2012. Only 14 players have ever broken a rating of 2800.

One possible cause for this inflation was the rating floor, which for a long time was at 2200, and if a player dropped below this they were struck from the rating list. As a consequence, players at a skill level just below the floor would only be on the rating list if they were overrated, and this would cause them to feed points into the rating pool. In July 2000 the average rating of the top 100 was 2644. By July 2012 it had increased to 2703.

Using a strong chess engine to evaluate moves played in games between rated players, Regan and Haworth analyze sets of games from FIDE-rated tournaments, and draw the conclusion that there had been little or no inflation from 1976 to 2009.

In a pure Elo system, each game ends in an equal transaction of rating points. If the winner gains N rating points, the loser will drop by N rating points. This prevents points from entering or leaving the system when games are played and rated. However, players tend to enter the system as novices with a low rating and retire from the system as experienced players with a high rating. Therefore, in the long run a system with strictly equal transactions tends to result in rating deflation.

In 1995, the USCF acknowledged that several young scholastic players were improving faster than the rating system was able to track. As a result, established players with stable ratings started to lose rating points to the young and underrated players. Several of the older established players were frustrated over what they considered an unfair rating decline, and some even quit chess over it.

====Combating deflation====
Because of the significant difference in timing of when inflation and deflation occur, and in order to combat deflation, most implementations of Elo ratings have a mechanism for injecting points into the system in order to maintain relative ratings over time. FIDE has two inflationary mechanisms. First, performances below a &quot;ratings floor&quot; are not tracked, so a player with true skill below the floor can only be unrated or overrated, never correctly rated. Second, established and higher-rated players have a lower K-factor. New players have a , which drops to after 30 played games, and to when the player reaches 2400.
The current system in the United States includes a bonus point scheme which feeds rating points into the system in order to track improving players, and different K-values for different players. Some methods, used in Norway for example, differentiate between juniors and seniors, and use a larger K-factor for the young players, even boosting the rating progress by 100% for when they score well above their predicted performance.

Rating floors in the United States work by guaranteeing that a player will never drop below a certain limit. This also combats deflation, but the chairman of the USCF Ratings Committee has been critical of this method because it does not feed the extra points to the improving players. A possible motive for these rating floors is to combat sandbagging, i.e., deliberate lowering of ratings to be eligible for lower rating class sections and prizes.

===Ratings of computers===
Human–computer chess matches between 1997 (Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov) and 2006 demonstrated that chess computers are capable of defeating even the strongest human players. However, chess engine ratings are difficult to quantify, due to variable factors such as the time control and the hardware the program runs on, and also the fact that chess is not a fair game. The existence and magnitude of the first-move advantage in chess becomes very important at the computer level. Beyond some skill threshold, an engine with White should be able to force a draw on demand from the starting position even against perfect play, simply because White begins with too big an advantage to lose compared to the small magnitude of the errors it is likely to make. Consequently, such an engine is more or less guaranteed to score at least 25% even against perfect play. Differences in skill beyond a certain point could only be picked up if one does not begin from the usual starting position, but instead chooses a starting position that is only barely not lost for one side. Because of these factors, ratings depend on pairings and the openings selected. Published engine rating lists such as CCRL are based on engine-only games on standard hardware configurations and are not directly comparable to FIDE ratings.

For some ratings estimates, see Chess engine § Ratings.

=== Other board and card games ===
* &quot;Go&quot;: The European Go Federation adopted an Elo-based rating system initially pioneered by the Czech Go Federation.
* &quot;Backgammon&quot;: The popular First Internet Backgammon Server (FIBS) calculates ratings based on a modified Elo system. New players are assigned a rating of 1500, with the best humans and bots rating over 2000. The same formula has been adopted by several other backgammon sites, such as Play65, DailyGammon, GoldToken and VogClub. VogClub sets a new player&#x27;s rating at 1600. The UK Backgammon Federation uses the FIBS formula for its UK national ratings.
* &quot;Scrabble&quot;: National Scrabble organizations compute normally distributed Elo ratings except in the United Kingdom, where a different system is used. The North American Scrabble Players Association has the largest rated population of active members, numbering about 2,000 as of early 2011. Lexulous also uses the Elo system.
* Despite questions of the appropriateness of using the Elo system to rate games in which luck is a factor, trading-card game manufacturers often use Elo ratings for their organized play efforts. The DCI (formerly Duelists&#x27; Convocation International) used Elo ratings for tournaments of &quot;&quot; and other Wizards of the Coast games. However, the DCI abandoned this system in 2012 in favor of a new cumulative system of &quot;Planeswalker Points&quot;, chiefly because of the above-noted concern that Elo encourages highly rated players to avoid playing to &quot;protect their rating&quot;. Pokémon USA uses the Elo system to rank its TCG organized play competitors. Prizes for the top players in various regions included holidays and world championships invites until the 2011–2012 season, where awards were based on a system of Championship Points, their rationale being the same as the DCI&#x27;s for &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot;. Similarly, Decipher, Inc. used the Elo system for its ranked games such as &quot;Star Trek Customizable Card Game&quot; and &quot;Star Wars Customizable Card Game&quot;.

=== Athletic sports ===
The Elo rating system is used in the chess portion of chess boxing. In order to be eligible for professional chess boxing, one must have an Elo rating of at least 1600, as well as competing in 50 or more matches of amateur boxing or martial arts.

American college football used the Elo method as a portion of its Bowl Championship Series rating systems from 1998 to 2013 after which the BCS was replaced by the College Football Playoff. Jeff Sagarin of &quot;USA Today&quot; publishes team rankings for most American sports, which includes Elo system ratings for college football. The use of rating systems was effectively scrapped with the creation of the College Football Playoff in 2014.

In other sports, individuals maintain rankings based on the Elo algorithm. These are usually unofficial, not endorsed by the sport&#x27;s governing body. The World Football Elo Ratings is an example of the method applied to men&#x27;s football. In 2006, Elo ratings were adapted for Major League Baseball teams by Nate Silver, then of Baseball Prospectus. Based on this adaptation, both also made Elo-based Monte Carlo simulations of the odds of whether teams will make the playoffs. In 2014, Beyond the Box Score, an SB Nation site, introduced an Elo ranking system for international baseball.

In tennis, the Elo-based Universal Tennis Rating (UTR) rates players on a global scale, regardless of age, gender, or nationality. It is the official rating system of major organizations such as the Intercollegiate Tennis Association and World TeamTennis and is frequently used in segments on the Tennis Channel. The algorithm analyzes more than 8 million match results from over 800,000 tennis players worldwide. On May 8, 2018, Rafael Nadal—having won 46 consecutive sets in clay court matches—had a near-perfect clay UTR of 16.42.

In pool, an Elo-based system called Fargo Rate is used to rank players in organized amateur and professional competitions.

One of the few Elo-based rankings endorsed by a sport&#x27;s governing body is the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Rankings, based on a simplified version of the Elo algorithm, which FIFA uses as its official ranking system for national teams in women&#x27;s football.

From the first ranking list after the 2018 FIFA World Cup, FIFA has used Elo for their FIFA World Rankings.

In 2015, Nate Silver, editor-in-chief of the statistical commentary website FiveThirtyEight, and Reuben Fischer-Baum produced Elo ratings for every National Basketball Association team and season through the 2014 season. In 2014 FiveThirtyEight created Elo-based ratings and win-projections for the American professional National Football League.

The English Korfball Association rated teams based on Elo ratings, to determine handicaps for their cup competition for the 2011/12 season.

An Elo-based ranking of National Hockey League players has been developed. The hockey-Elo metric evaluates a player&#x27;s overall two-way play: scoring AND defense in both even strength and power-play/penalty-kill situations.

Rugbyleagueratings.com uses the Elo rating system to rank international and club rugby league teams.

Hemaratings.com was started in 2017 and uses a Glicko-2 algorithm to rank individual Historical European martial arts fencers worldwide in different categories such as Longsword, Rapier, historical Sabre and Sword &amp; Buckler.

=== Video games and online games ===
Many video games use modified Elo systems in competitive gameplay. The MOBA game League of Legends used an Elo rating system prior to the second season of competitive play. The Esports game &quot;Overwatch&quot;, the basis of the unique Overwatch League professional sports organization, uses a derivative of the Elo system to rank competitive players with various adjustments made between competitive seasons. &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; also previously used the Glicko-2 system to team up and compare Arena players, but now uses a system similar to Microsoft&#x27;s TrueSkill. The game &quot;Puzzle Pirates&quot; uses the Elo rating system to determine the standings in the various puzzles. This system is also used in FIFA Mobile for the Division Rivals modes. Another recent game to start using the Elo rating system is &quot;AirMech&quot;, using Elo ratings for 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 random/team matchmaking. &quot;RuneScape 3&quot; used the Elo system in the rerelease of the bounty hunter minigame in 2016. &quot;Mechwarrior Online&quot; instituted an Elo system for its new &quot;Comp Queue&quot; mode, effective with the Jun 20, 2017 patch. &quot;Age of Empires II DE&quot; and &quot;Age of Empires III DE&quot; are using the Elo system for their Leaderboard and matchmaking, with new players starting at Elo 1000. Competitive Classic Tetris (Tetris played on the Nintendo Entertainment System) derives its ratings using a combination of players&#x27; personal best scores and a highly modified Elo system.

Few video games use the original Elo rating system. According to Lichess, an online chess server, the Elo system is outdated, with Glicko-2 now being used by many chess organizations. &quot;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&quot; is one of the few video games that utilizes the very first Elo system. In &quot;Guild Wars&quot;, Elo ratings are used to record guild rating gained and lost through guild-versus-guild battles. In 1998, an online gaming ladder called &quot;Clanbase&quot; was launched, which used the Elo scoring system to rank teams. The initial K-value was 30, but was changed to 5 in January 2007, then changed to 15 in July 2009. The site later went offline in 2013. A similar alternative site was launched in 2016 under the name &quot;Scrimbase&quot;, which also used the Elo scoring system for ranking teams. Since 2005, &quot;Golden Tee Live&quot; has rated players based on the Elo system. New players start at 2100, with top players rating over 3000.

Despite many video games using different systems for matchmaking, it is common for players of ranked video games to refer to all matchmaking ratings as &quot;Elo&quot;.

===Other usage===
The Elo rating system has been used in soft biometrics, which concerns the identification of individuals using human descriptions. Comparative descriptions were utilized alongside the Elo rating system to provide robust and discriminative &#x27;relative measurements&#x27;, permitting accurate identification.

The Elo rating system has also been used in biology for assessing male dominance hierarchies, and in automation and computer vision for fabric inspection.

Moreover, online judge sites are also using Elo rating system or its derivatives. For example, Topcoder is using a modified version based on normal distribution, while Codeforces is using another version based on logistic distribution.

The Elo rating system has also been noted in dating apps, such as in the matchmaking app Tinder, which uses a variant of the Elo rating system.

The YouTuber Marques Brownlee and his team used Elo rating system when they let people to vote between digital photos taken with different smartphone models launched in 2022.

The Elo rating system has also been used in U.S. revealed preference college rankings, such as those by the digital credential firm Parchment.

The Elo rating system has also been adopted to evaluate AI models. In 2021, Anthropic utilized the Elo system for ranking AI models in their research. The LMSYS leaderboard briefly employed the Elo rating system to rank AI models before transitioning to Bradley–Terry model.

==References in the media==
The Elo rating system was featured prominently in the 2010 film &quot;The Social Network&quot; during the algorithm scene where Mark Zuckerberg released Facemash. In the scene Eduardo Saverin writes mathematical formulas for the Elo rating system on Zuckerberg&#x27;s dormitory room window. Behind the scenes, the movie claims, the Elo system is employed to rank girls by their attractiveness. The equations driving the algorithm are shown briefly, written on the window; however, they are slightly incorrect.

<text>An esker, eskar, eschar, or os, sometimes called an &quot;asar&quot;, &quot;osar&quot;, or &quot;serpent kame&quot;, is a long, winding ridge of stratified sand and gravel, examples of which occur in glaciated and formerly glaciated regions of Europe and North America. Eskers are frequently several kilometres long and, because of their uniform shape, look like railway embankments.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;esker&quot; is derived from the Irish word (), which means &quot;ridge or elevation, especially one separating two plains or depressed surfaces&quot;. The Irish word was and is used particularly to describe long sinuous ridges, which are now known to be deposits of fluvio-glacial material. The best-known example of such an &quot;eiscir&quot; is the &quot;Eiscir Riada&quot;, which runs nearly the whole width of Ireland from Dublin to Galway, a distance of , and is still closely followed by the main Dublin–Galway road

The synonym &quot;os&quot; comes from the Swedish word , &quot;ridge&quot;.

==Geology==
Most eskers are argued to have formed within ice-walled tunnels by streams that flowed within and under glaciers. They tended to form around the time of the glacial maximum, when the glacier was slow and sluggish. After the retaining ice walls melted away, stream deposits remained as long winding ridges. 

Eskers may also form above glaciers by accumulation of sediment in supraglacial channels, in crevasses, in linear zones between stagnant blocks, or in narrow embayments at glacier margins. Eskers form near the terminal zone of glaciers, where the ice is not moving as fast and is relatively thin.
Plastic flow and melting of the basal ice determines the size and shape of the subglacial tunnel. This in turn determines the shape, composition and structure of an esker. Eskers may exist as a single channel, or may be part of a branching system with tributary eskers. They are not often found as continuous ridges, but have gaps that separate the winding segments. The ridge crests of eskers are not usually level for very long, and are generally knobby. Eskers may be broad-crested or sharp-crested with steep sides. They can reach hundreds of kilometers in length and are generally in height.

The path of an esker is governed by its water pressure in relation to the overlying ice. Generally, the pressure of the ice was at such a point that it would allow eskers to run in the direction of glacial flow, but force them into the lowest possible points such as valleys or river beds, which may deviate from the direct path of the glacier. This process is what produces the wide eskers upon which roads and highways can be built. Less pressure, occurring in areas closer to the glacial maximum, can cause ice to melt over the stream flow and create steep-walled, sharply-arched tunnels.

The concentration of rock debris in the ice and the rate at which sediment is delivered to the tunnel by melting and from upstream transport determines the amount of sediment in an esker. The sediment generally consists of coarse-grained, water-laid sand and gravel, although gravelly loam may be found where the rock debris is rich in clay. This sediment is stratified and sorted, and usually consists of pebble/cobble-sized material with occasional boulders. Bedding may be irregular but is almost always present, and cross-bedding is common.

There are various cases where inland dunes have developed next to eskers after deglaciation. These dunes are often found in the leeward side of eskers, if the esker is not oriented parallel to prevailing winds. Examples of dunes developed on eskers can be found in both Swedish and Finnish Lapland.

Lakes may form within depressions in eskers. These lakes can lack surface outflows and inflows and have drastic fluctuations over time.

==Life on eskers==
Eskers are critical to the ecology of Northern Canada. Several plants that grow on eskers, including bear root and cranberries, are important food for bears and migrating waterfowl; animals from grizzly bears to tundra wolves to ground squirrels can burrow into the eskers to survive the long winters.

==Examples of eskers==

===Europe===
In Sweden, Uppsalaåsen stretches for and passes through Uppsala city. The Badelundaåsen esker runs for over from Nyköping to lake Siljan. Pispala&#x27;s Pyynikki Esker in Tampere, Finland, is on an esker between two lakes carved by glaciers. A similar site is Punkaharju in Finnish Lakeland.

The village of Kemnay in Aberdeenshire, Scotland has a esker locally called the Kemb Hills. In Berwickshire in southeast Scotland is Bedshiel Kaims, a example which is up to high and is a legacy of an ice-stream within the Tweed Valley.

===North America===
Great Esker Park runs along the Back River in Weymouth, Massachusetts, and is home to the highest esker in North America ().

There are over 1,000 eskers in the state of Michigan, primarily in the south-central Lower Peninsula. The longest esker in Michigan is the Mason Esker, which stretches south-southeast from DeWitt through Lansing and Holt, before ending near Mason.

Esker systems in the U.S. state of Maine can be traced for up to .

Thelon Esker is almost long, straddling the boundary between the territories of Nunavut and Northwest Territories in Canada.

Uvayuq or Mount Pelly, in Ovayok Territorial Park, the Kitikmeot Region, Nunavut is an esker.

Roads are sometimes built along eskers to save expense. Examples include the Denali Highway in Alaska, the Trans-Taiga Road in Quebec, and the &quot;Airline&quot; segment of Maine State Route 9 between Bangor and Calais.

There are numerous long eskers in the Adirondack State Park in upstate New York. The Rainbow Lake esker bisects the eponymous lake and extends discontinuously for 85 miles (c. 137 km). Another long discontinuous esker extends from Mountain Pond through Keese Mill, passing between Upper St. Regis Lake and the Spectacle Ponds, and continuing to Ochre, Fish, and Lydia Ponds in the St. Regis Canoe Area. A 150-foot-high esker bisects the Five Ponds Wilderness Area.

<text>Inflammation (from ) is part of the biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants. The five cardinal signs are heat, pain, redness, swelling, and loss of function (Latin &quot;calor&quot;, &quot;dolor&quot;, &quot;rubor&quot;, &quot;tumor&quot;, and &quot;functio laesa&quot;).

Inflammation is a generic response, and therefore is considered a mechanism of innate immunity, whereas adaptive immunity is specific to each pathogen.

Inflammation is a protective response involving immune cells, blood vessels, and molecular mediators. The function of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, clear out damaged cells and tissues, and initiate tissue repair. Too little inflammation could lead to progressive tissue destruction by the harmful stimulus (e.g. bacteria) and compromise the survival of the organism. However inflammation can also have negative effects. Too much inflammation, in the form of chronic inflammation, is associated with various diseases, such as hay fever, periodontal disease, atherosclerosis, and osteoarthritis.

Inflammation can be classified as &quot;acute&quot; or &quot;chronic&quot;. Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli, and is achieved by the increased movement of plasma and leukocytes (in particular granulocytes) from the blood into the injured tissues. A series of biochemical events propagates and matures the inflammatory response, involving the local vascular system, the immune system, and various cells in the injured tissue. Prolonged inflammation, known as &quot;chronic inflammation&quot;, leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells present at the site of inflammation, such as mononuclear cells, and involves simultaneous destruction and healing of the tissue.

Inflammation has also been classified as Type 1 and Type 2 based on the type of cytokines and helper T cells (Th1 and Th2) involved.

== Meaning ==
The earliest known reference for the term inflammation is around the early 15th century. The word root comes from Old French &quot;inflammation&quot; around the 14th century, which then comes from Latin &quot;inflammatio&quot; or &quot;inflammationem&quot;. Literally, the term relates to the word &quot;flame&quot;, as the property of being &quot;set on fire&quot; or &quot;to burn&quot;.

The term &quot;inflammation&quot; is not a synonym for &quot;infection&quot;. &quot;Infection&quot; describes the interaction between the action of microbial invasion and the reaction of the body&#x27;s inflammatory response—the two components are considered together in discussion of infection, and the word is used to imply a microbial invasive cause for the observed inflammatory reaction. &quot;Inflammation&quot;, on the other hand, describes just the body&#x27;s immunovascular response, regardless of cause. But, because the two are often correlated, words ending in the suffix &quot;&quot; (which means inflammation) are sometimes informally described as referring to infection: for example, the word &quot;urethritis&quot; strictly means only &quot;urethral inflammation&quot;, but clinical health care providers usually discuss urethritis as a urethral infection because urethral microbial invasion is the most common cause of urethritis. However, the inflammation–infection distinction is crucial in situations in pathology and medical diagnosis that involve inflammation that is not driven by microbial invasion, such as cases of atherosclerosis, trauma, ischemia, and autoimmune diseases (including type III hypersensitivity).

=== Acute ===
Acute inflammation is a short-term process, usually appearing within a few minutes or hours and begins to cease upon the removal of the injurious stimulus. It involves a coordinated and systemic mobilization response locally of various immune, endocrine and neurological mediators of acute inflammation. In a normal healthy response, it becomes activated, clears the pathogen and begins a repair process and then ceases.

Acute inflammation occurs immediately upon injury, lasting only a few days. Cytokines and chemokines promote the migration of neutrophils and macrophages to the site of inflammation. Pathogens, allergens, toxins, burns, and frostbite are some of the typical causes of acute inflammation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize microbial pathogens. Acute inflammation can be a defensive mechanism to protect tissues against injury. Inflammation lasting 2–6 weeks is designated subacute inflammation.

==== Cardinal signs ====
Inflammation is characterized by five cardinal signs, (the traditional names of which come from Latin):
* Dolor (pain)
* Calor (heat)
* Rubor (redness)
* Tumor (swelling)
* Functio laesa (loss of function)

The first four (classical signs) were described by Celsus (–38 AD).

Pain is due to the release of chemicals such as bradykinin and histamine that stimulate nerve endings. Acute inflammation of the lung (usually in response to pneumonia) does not cause pain unless the inflammation involves the parietal pleura, which does have pain-sensitive nerve endings. Heat and redness are due to increased blood flow at body core temperature to the inflamed site. Swelling is caused by accumulation of fluid.

=====Loss of function=====
The fifth sign, &quot;loss of function&quot;, is believed to have been added later by Galen, Thomas Sydenham or Rudolf Virchow. Examples of loss of function include pain that inhibits mobility, severe swelling that prevents movement, having a worse sense of smell during a cold, or having difficulty breathing when bronchitis is present. Loss of function has multiple causes.

==== Acute process ====

The process of acute inflammation is initiated by resident immune cells already present in the involved tissue, mainly resident macrophages, dendritic cells, histiocytes, Kupffer cells and mast cells. These cells possess surface receptors known as &quot;pattern recognition receptors&quot; (PRRs), which recognize (i.e., bind) two subclasses of molecules: pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). PAMPs are compounds that are associated with various pathogens, but which are distinguishable from host molecules. DAMPs are compounds that are associated with host-related injury and cell damage.

At the onset of an infection, burn, or other injuries, these cells undergo activation (one of the PRRs recognize a PAMP or DAMP) and release inflammatory mediators responsible for the clinical signs of inflammation. Vasodilation and its resulting increased blood flow causes the redness (&quot;rubor&quot;) and increased heat (&quot;calor&quot;). Increased permeability of the blood vessels results in an exudation (leakage) of plasma proteins and fluid into the tissue (edema), which manifests itself as swelling (&quot;tumor&quot;). Some of the released mediators such as bradykinin increase the sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia, &quot;dolor&quot;). The mediator molecules also alter the blood vessels to permit the migration of leukocytes, mainly neutrophils and macrophages, to flow out of the blood vessels (extravasation) and into the tissue. The neutrophils migrate along a chemotactic gradient created by the local cells to reach the site of injury. The loss of function (&quot;functio laesa&quot;) is probably the result of a neurological reflex in response to pain.

In addition to cell-derived mediators, several acellular biochemical cascade systems—consisting of preformed plasma proteins—act in parallel to initiate and propagate the inflammatory response. These include the complement system activated by bacteria and the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems activated by necrosis (e.g., burn, trauma).

Acute inflammation may be regarded as the first line of defense against injury. Acute inflammatory response requires constant stimulation to be sustained. Inflammatory mediators are short-lived and are quickly degraded in the tissue. Hence, acute inflammation begins to cease once the stimulus has been removed.

=== Chronic ===

Chronic inflammation is inflammation that lasts for months or years. Macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells predominate in chronic inflammation, in contrast to the neutrophils that predominate in acute inflammation. Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, allergies, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are examples of diseases mediated by chronic inflammation. Obesity, smoking, stress and insufficient diet are some of the factors that promote chronic inflammation.

====Cardinal signs====
Common signs and symptoms that develop during chronic inflammation are:
* Body pain, arthralgia, myalgia
* Chronic fatigue and insomnia
* Depression, anxiety and mood disorders
* Gastrointestinal complications such as constipation, diarrhea, and acid reflux
* Weight gain or loss
* Frequent infections

== Vascular component ==
=== Vasodilation and increased permeability ===

As defined, acute inflammation is an immunovascular response to inflammatory stimuli, which can include infection or trauma. This means acute inflammation can be broadly divided into a vascular phase that occurs first, followed by a cellular phase involving immune cells (more specifically myeloid granulocytes in the acute setting). The vascular component of acute inflammation involves the movement of plasma fluid, containing important proteins such as fibrin and immunoglobulins (antibodies), into inflamed tissue.

Upon contact with PAMPs, tissue macrophages and mastocytes release vasoactive amines such as histamine and serotonin, as well as eicosanoids such as prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 to remodel the local vasculature. Macrophages and endothelial cells release nitric oxide. These mediators vasodilate and permeabilize the blood vessels, which results in the net distribution of blood plasma from the vessel into the tissue space. The increased collection of fluid into the tissue causes it to swell (edema). This exuded tissue fluid contains various antimicrobial mediators from the plasma such as complement, lysozyme, antibodies, which can immediately deal damage to microbes, and opsonise the microbes in preparation for the cellular phase. If the inflammatory stimulus is a lacerating wound, exuded platelets, coagulants, plasmin and kinins can clot the wounded area using vitamin K-dependent mechanisms and provide haemostasis in the first instance. These clotting mediators also provide a structural staging framework at the inflammatory tissue site in the form of a fibrin lattice – as would construction scaffolding at a construction site – for the purpose of aiding phagocytic debridement and wound repair later on. Some of the exuded tissue fluid is also funneled by lymphatics to the regional lymph nodes, flushing bacteria along to start the recognition and attack phase of the adaptive immune system.

Acute inflammation is characterized by marked vascular changes, including vasodilation, increased permeability and increased blood flow, which are induced by the actions of various inflammatory mediators. Vasodilation occurs first at the arteriole level, progressing to the capillary level, and brings about a net increase in the amount of blood present, causing the redness and heat of inflammation. Increased permeability of the vessels results in the movement of plasma into the tissues, with resultant stasis due to the increase in the concentration of the cells within blood – a condition characterized by enlarged vessels packed with cells. Stasis allows leukocytes to marginate (move) along the endothelium, a process critical to their recruitment into the tissues. Normal flowing blood prevents this, as the shearing force along the periphery of the vessels moves cells in the blood into the middle of the vessel.

=== Plasma cascade systems ===
* The complement system, when activated, creates a cascade of chemical reactions that promotes opsonization, chemotaxis, and agglutination, and produces the MAC.
* The kinin system generates proteins capable of sustaining vasodilation and other physical inflammatory effects.
* The coagulation system or &quot;clotting cascade&quot;, which forms a protective protein mesh over sites of injury.
* The fibrinolysis system, which acts in opposition to the &quot;coagulation system&quot;, to counterbalance clotting and generate several other inflammatory mediators.

=== Plasma-derived mediators ===

== Cellular component ==
The &quot;cellular component&quot; involves leukocytes, which normally reside in blood and must move into the inflamed tissue via &quot;extravasation&quot; to aid in inflammation. Some act as phagocytes, ingesting bacteria, viruses, and cellular debris. Others release enzymatic granules that damage pathogenic invaders. Leukocytes also release inflammatory mediators that develop and maintain the inflammatory response. In general, acute inflammation is mediated by granulocytes, whereas chronic inflammation is mediated by mononuclear cells such as monocytes and lymphocytes.

=== Leukocyte extravasation ===

Various leukocytes, particularly neutrophils, are critically involved in the initiation and maintenance of inflammation. These cells must be able to move to the site of injury from their usual location in the blood, therefore mechanisms exist to recruit and direct leukocytes to the appropriate place. The process of leukocyte movement from the blood to the tissues through the blood vessels is known as &quot;extravasation&quot; and can be broadly divided up into a number of steps:
# Leukocyte margination and endothelial adhesion: The white blood cells within the vessels which are generally centrally located move peripherally towards the walls of the vessels. Activated macrophages in the tissue release cytokines such as IL-1 and TNFα, which in turn leads to production of chemokines that bind to proteoglycans forming gradient in the inflamed tissue and along the endothelial wall. Inflammatory cytokines induce the immediate expression of P-selectin on endothelial cell surfaces and P-selectin binds weakly to carbohydrate ligands on the surface of leukocytes and causes them to &quot;roll&quot; along the endothelial surface as bonds are made and broken. Cytokines released from injured cells induce the expression of E-selectin on endothelial cells, which functions similarly to P-selectin. Cytokines also induce the expression of integrin ligands such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on endothelial cells, which mediate the adhesion and further slow leukocytes down. These weakly bound leukocytes are free to detach if not activated by chemokines produced in injured tissue after signal transduction via respective G protein-coupled receptors that activates integrins on the leukocyte surface for firm adhesion. Such activation increases the affinity of bound integrin receptors for ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on the endothelial cell surface, firmly binding the leukocytes to the endothelium.
# Migration across the endothelium, known as&quot; transmigration, &quot;via the process of diapedesis: Chemokine gradients stimulate the adhered leukocytes to move between adjacent endothelial cells. The endothelial cells retract and the leukocytes pass through the basement membrane into the surrounding tissue using adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1.
# Movement of leukocytes within the tissue via chemotaxis: Leukocytes reaching the tissue interstitium bind to extracellular matrix proteins via expressed integrins and CD44 to prevent them from leaving the site. A variety of molecules behave as chemoattractants, for example, C3a or C5a (the anaphylatoxins), and cause the leukocytes to move along a chemotactic gradient towards the source of inflammation.

=== Phagocytosis ===

Extravasated neutrophils in the cellular phase come into contact with microbes at the inflamed tissue. Phagocytes express cell-surface endocytic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that have affinity and efficacy against non-specific microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Most PAMPs that bind to endocytic PRRs and initiate phagocytosis are cell wall components, including complex carbohydrates such as mannans and β-glucans, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), peptidoglycans, and surface proteins. Endocytic PRRs on phagocytes reflect these molecular patterns, with C-type lectin receptors binding to mannans and β-glucans, and scavenger receptors binding to LPS.

Upon endocytic PRR binding, actin-myosin cytoskeletal rearrangement adjacent to the plasma membrane occurs in a way that endocytoses the plasma membrane containing the PRR-PAMP complex, and the microbe. Phosphatidylinositol and Vps34-Vps15-Beclin1 signalling pathways have been implicated to traffic the endocytosed phagosome to intracellular lysosomes, where fusion of the phagosome and the lysosome produces a phagolysosome. The reactive oxygen species, superoxides and hypochlorite bleach within the phagolysosomes then kill microbes inside the phagocyte.

Phagocytic efficacy can be enhanced by opsonization. Plasma derived complement C3b and antibodies that exude into the inflamed tissue during the vascular phase bind to and coat the microbial antigens. As well as endocytic PRRs, phagocytes also express opsonin receptors Fc receptor and complement receptor 1 (CR1), which bind to antibodies and C3b, respectively. The co-stimulation of endocytic PRR and opsonin receptor increases the efficacy of the phagocytic process, enhancing the lysosomal elimination of the infective agent.

=== Cell-derived mediators ===

== Morphologic patterns ==
Specific patterns of acute and chronic inflammation are seen during particular situations that arise in the body, such as when inflammation occurs on an epithelial surface, or pyogenic bacteria are involved.
* Granulomatous inflammation: Characterised by the formation of granulomas, they are the result of a limited but diverse number of diseases, which include among others tuberculosis, leprosy, sarcoidosis, and syphilis.
* Fibrinous inflammation: Inflammation resulting in a large increase in vascular permeability allows fibrin to pass through the blood vessels. If an appropriate &quot;procoagulative&quot; stimulus is present, such as cancer cells, a fibrinous exudate is deposited. This is commonly seen in serous cavities, where the conversion of fibrinous exudate into a scar can occur between serous membranes, limiting their function. The deposit sometimes forms a pseudomembrane sheet. During inflammation of the intestine (pseudomembranous colitis), pseudomembranous tubes can be formed.
* Purulent inflammation: Inflammation resulting in large amount of pus, which consists of neutrophils, dead cells, and fluid. Infection by pyogenic bacteria such as staphylococci is characteristic of this kind of inflammation. Large, localised collections of pus enclosed by surrounding tissues are called abscesses.
* Serous inflammation: Characterised by the copious effusion of non-viscous serous fluid, commonly produced by mesothelial cells of serous membranes, but may be derived from blood plasma. Skin blisters exemplify this pattern of inflammation.
* Ulcerative inflammation: Inflammation occurring near an epithelium can result in the necrotic loss of tissue from the surface, exposing lower layers. The subsequent excavation in the epithelium is known as an ulcer.

== Disorders ==
Inflammatory abnormalities are a large group of disorders that underlie a vast variety of human diseases. The immune system is often involved with inflammatory disorders, as demonstrated in both allergic reactions and some myopathies, with many immune system disorders resulting in abnormal inflammation.

=== Atherosclerosis ===
Atherosclerosis, formerly considered a lipid storage disorder, is now understood as a chronic inflammatory condition involving the arterial walls. Research has established a fundamental role for inflammation in mediating all stages of atherosclerosis from initiation through progression and, ultimately, the thrombotic complications from it. These new findings reveal links between traditional risk factors like cholesterol levels and the underlying mechanisms of atherogenesis.

Clinical studies have shown that this emerging biology of inflammation in atherosclerosis applies directly to people. For instance, elevation in markers of inflammation predicts outcomes of people with acute coronary syndromes, independently of myocardial damage. In addition, low-grade chronic inflammation, as indicated by levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein, prospectively defines risk of atherosclerotic complications, thus adding to prognostic information provided by traditional risk factors, such as LDL levels.

Moreover, certain treatments that reduce coronary risk also limit inflammation. Notably, lipid-lowering medications such as statins have shown anti-inflammatory effects, which may contribute to their efficacy beyond just lowering LDL levels. This emerging understanding of inflammation&#x27;s role in atherosclerosis has had significant clinical implications, influencing both risk stratification and therapeutic strategies.

==== Emerging treatments ====

Recent developments in the treatment of atherosclerosis have focused on addressing inflammation directly. New anti-inflammatory drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-1β, have been studied in large clinical trials, showing promising results in reducing cardiovascular events. These drugs offer a potential new avenue for treatment, particularly for patients who do not respond adequately to statins. However, concerns about long-term safety and cost remain significant barriers to widespread adoption.

==== Connection to depression ====
Inflammatory processes can be triggered by negative cognition or their consequences, such as stress, violence, or deprivation. Negative cognition may therefore contribute to inflammation, which in turn can lead to depression. A 2019 meta-analysis found that chronic inflammation is associated with a 30% increased risk of developing major depressive disorder, supporting the link between inflammation and mental health.

=== Allergy ===
An allergic reaction, formally known as type 1 hypersensitivity, is the result of an inappropriate immune response triggering inflammation, vasodilation, and nerve irritation. A common example is hay fever, which is caused by a hypersensitive response by mast cells to allergens. Pre-sensitised mast cells respond by degranulating, releasing vasoactive chemicals such as histamine. These chemicals propagate an excessive inflammatory response characterised by blood vessel dilation, production of pro-inflammatory molecules, cytokine release, and recruitment of leukocytes. Severe inflammatory response may mature into a systemic response known as anaphylaxis.

=== Myopathies ===
Inflammatory myopathies are caused by the immune system inappropriately attacking components of muscle, leading to signs of muscle inflammation. They may occur in conjunction with other immune disorders, such as systemic sclerosis, and include dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and inclusion body myositis.

=== Leukocyte defects ===
Due to the central role of leukocytes in the development and propagation of inflammation, defects in leukocyte functionality often result in a decreased capacity for inflammatory defense with subsequent vulnerability to infection. Dysfunctional leukocytes may be unable to correctly bind to blood vessels due to surface receptor mutations, digest bacteria (Chédiak–Higashi syndrome), or produce microbicides (chronic granulomatous disease). In addition, diseases affecting the bone marrow may result in abnormal or few leukocytes.

=== Pharmacological ===
Certain drugs or exogenous chemical compounds are known to affect inflammation. Vitamin A deficiency, for example, causes an increase in inflammatory responses, and anti-inflammatory drugs work specifically by inhibiting the enzymes that produce inflammatory eicosanoids. Additionally, certain illicit drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy may exert some of their detrimental effects by activating transcription factors intimately involved with inflammation (e.g. NF-κB).

=== Cancer ===
Inflammation orchestrates the microenvironment around tumours, contributing to proliferation, survival and migration. Cancer cells use selectins, chemokines and their receptors for invasion, migration and metastasis. On the other hand, many cells of the immune system contribute to cancer immunology, suppressing cancer.
Molecular intersection between receptors of steroid hormones, which have important effects on cellular development, and transcription factors that play key roles in inflammation, such as NF-κB, may mediate some of the most critical effects of inflammatory stimuli on cancer cells. This capacity of a mediator of inflammation to influence the effects of steroid hormones in cells is very likely to affect carcinogenesis. On the other hand, due to the modular nature of many steroid hormone receptors, this interaction may offer ways to interfere with cancer progression, through targeting of a specific protein domain in a specific cell type. Such an approach may limit side effects that are unrelated to the tumor of interest, and may help preserve vital homeostatic functions and developmental processes in the organism.

There is some evidence from 2009 to suggest that cancer-related inflammation (CRI) may lead to accumulation of random genetic alterations in cancer cells.

====Role in cancer====

In 1863, Rudolf Virchow hypothesized that the origin of cancer was at sites of chronic inflammation. As of 2012, chronic inflammation was estimated to contribute to approximately 15% to 25% of human cancers.

====Mediators and DNA damage in cancer====

An inflammatory mediator is a messenger that acts on blood vessels and/or cells to promote an inflammatory response. Inflammatory mediators that contribute to neoplasia include prostaglandins, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-15 and chemokines such as IL-8 and GRO-alpha. These inflammatory mediators, and others, orchestrate an environment that fosters proliferation and survival.

Inflammation also causes DNA damages due to the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by various intracellular inflammatory mediators. In addition, leukocytes and other phagocytic cells attracted to the site of inflammation induce DNA damages in proliferating cells through their generation of ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). ROS and RNS are normally produced by these cells to fight infection. ROS, alone, cause more than 20 types of DNA damage. Oxidative DNA damages cause both mutations and epigenetic alterations. RNS also cause mutagenic DNA damages.

A normal cell may undergo carcinogenesis to become a cancer cell if it is frequently subjected to DNA damage during long periods of chronic inflammation. DNA damages may cause genetic mutations due to inaccurate repair. In addition, mistakes in the DNA repair process may cause epigenetic alterations. Mutations and epigenetic alterations that are replicated and provide a selective advantage during somatic cell proliferation may be carcinogenic.

Genome-wide analyses of human cancer tissues reveal that a single typical cancer cell may possess roughly 100 mutations in coding regions, 10–20 of which are &quot;driver mutations&quot; that contribute to cancer development. However, chronic inflammation also causes epigenetic changes such as DNA methylations, that are often more common than mutations. Typically, several hundreds to thousands of genes are methylated in a cancer cell (see DNA methylation in cancer). Sites of oxidative damage in chromatin can recruit complexes that contain DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), a histone deacetylase (SIRT1), and a histone methyltransferase (EZH2), and thus induce DNA methylation. DNA methylation of a CpG island in a promoter region may cause silencing of its downstream gene (see CpG site and regulation of transcription in cancer). DNA repair genes, in particular, are frequently inactivated by methylation in various cancers (see hypermethylation of DNA repair genes in cancer). A 2018 report evaluated the relative importance of mutations and epigenetic alterations in progression to two different types of cancer. This report showed that epigenetic alterations were much more important than mutations in generating gastric cancers (associated with inflammation). However, mutations and epigenetic alterations were of roughly equal importance in generating esophageal squamous cell cancers (associated with tobacco chemicals and acetaldehyde, a product of alcohol metabolism).

=== HIV and AIDS ===

It has long been recognized that infection with HIV is characterized not only by development of profound immunodeficiency but also by sustained inflammation and immune activation. A substantial body of evidence implicates chronic inflammation as a critical driver of immune dysfunction, premature appearance of aging-related diseases, and immune deficiency. Many now regard HIV infection not only as an evolving virus-induced immunodeficiency, but also as chronic inflammatory disease. Even after the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) and effective suppression of viremia in HIV-infected individuals, chronic inflammation persists. Animal studies also support the relationship between immune activation and progressive cellular immune deficiency: SIVsm infection of its natural nonhuman primate hosts, the sooty mangabey, causes high-level viral replication but limited evidence of disease. This lack of pathogenicity is accompanied by a lack of inflammation, immune activation and cellular proliferation. In sharp contrast, experimental SIVsm infection of rhesus macaque produces immune activation and AIDS-like disease with many parallels to human HIV infection.

Delineating how CD4 T cells are depleted and how chronic inflammation and immune activation are induced lies at the heart of understanding HIV pathogenesisone of the top priorities for HIV research by the Office of AIDS Research, National Institutes of Health. Recent studies demonstrated that caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, drives CD4 T-cell depletion and inflammation by HIV. These are the two signature events that propel HIV disease progression to AIDS. Pyroptosis appears to create a pathogenic vicious cycle in which dying CD4 T cells and other immune cells (including macrophages and neutrophils) release inflammatory signals that recruit more cells into the infected lymphoid tissues to die. The feed-forward nature of this inflammatory response produces chronic inflammation and tissue injury. Identifying pyroptosis as the predominant mechanism that causes CD4 T-cell depletion and chronic inflammation, provides novel therapeutic opportunities, namely caspase-1 which controls the pyroptotic pathway. In this regard, pyroptosis of CD4 T cells and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18 can be blocked in HIV-infected human lymphoid tissues by addition of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765, which has already proven to be safe and well tolerated in phase II human clinical trials. These findings could propel development of an entirely new class of &quot;anti-AIDS&quot; therapies that act by targeting the host rather than the virus. Such agents would almost certainly be used in combination with ART. By promoting &quot;tolerance&quot; of the virus instead of suppressing its replication, VX-765 or related drugs may mimic the evolutionary solutions occurring in multiple monkey hosts (e.g. the sooty mangabey) infected with species-specific lentiviruses that have led to a lack of disease, no decline in CD4 T-cell counts, and no chronic inflammation.

=== Resolution ===
The inflammatory response must be actively terminated when no longer needed to prevent unnecessary &quot;bystander&quot; damage to tissues. Failure to do so results in chronic inflammation, and cellular destruction. Resolution of inflammation occurs by different mechanisms in different tissues.
Mechanisms that serve to terminate inflammation include:


=== Connection to depression ===
There is evidence for a link between inflammation and depression. Inflammatory processes can be triggered by negative cognitions or their consequences, such as stress, violence, or deprivation. Thus, negative cognitions can cause inflammation that can, in turn, lead to depression.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that inflammation can cause depression because of the increase of cytokines, setting the brain into a &quot;sickness mode&quot;.

Classical symptoms of being physically sick, such as lethargy, show a large overlap in behaviors that characterize depression. Levels of cytokines tend to increase sharply during the depressive episodes of people with bipolar disorder and drop off during remission. Furthermore, it has been shown in clinical trials that anti-inflammatory medicines taken in addition to antidepressants not only significantly improves symptoms but also increases the proportion of subjects positively responding to treatment.
Inflammations that lead to serious depression could be caused by common infections such as those caused by a virus, bacteria or even parasites.

=== Connection to delirium ===
There is evidence for a link between inflammation and delirium based on the results of a recent longitudinal study investigating CRP in COVID-19 patients.

== Systemic effects ==
An infectious organism can escape the confines of the immediate tissue via the circulatory system or lymphatic system, where it may spread to other parts of the body. If an organism is not contained by the actions of acute inflammation, it may gain access to the lymphatic system via nearby lymph vessels. An infection of the lymph vessels is known as lymphangitis, and infection of a lymph node is known as lymphadenitis. When lymph nodes cannot destroy all pathogens, the infection spreads further. A pathogen can gain access to the bloodstream through lymphatic drainage into the circulatory system.

When inflammation overwhelms the host, systemic inflammatory response syndrome is diagnosed. When it is due to infection, the term sepsis is applied, with the terms bacteremia being applied specifically for bacterial sepsis and viremia specifically to viral sepsis. Vasodilation and organ dysfunction are serious problems associated with widespread infection that may lead to septic shock and death.

=== Acute-phase proteins ===
Inflammation also is characterized by high systemic levels of acute-phase proteins. In acute inflammation, these proteins prove beneficial; however, in chronic inflammation, they can contribute to amyloidosis. These proteins include C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, and serum amyloid P, which cause a range of systemic effects including:

* Fever
* Increased blood pressure
* Decreased sweating
* Malaise
* Loss of appetite
* Somnolence
=== Leukocyte numbers ===
Inflammation often affects the numbers of leukocytes present in the body:
* Leukocytosis is often seen during inflammation induced by infection, where it results in a large increase in the amount of leukocytes in the blood, especially immature cells. Leukocyte numbers usually increase to between 15 000 and 20 000 cells per microliter, but extreme cases can see it approach 100 000 cells per microliter. Bacterial infection usually results in an increase of neutrophils, creating neutrophilia, whereas diseases such as asthma, hay fever, and parasite infestation result in an increase in eosinophils, creating eosinophilia.
* Leukopenia can be induced by certain infections and diseases, including viral infection, &quot;Rickettsia&quot; infection, some protozoa, tuberculosis, and some cancers.

=== Interleukins and obesity ===
With the discovery of interleukins (IL), the concept of systemic inflammation developed. Although the processes involved are identical to tissue inflammation, systemic inflammation is not confined to a particular tissue but involves the endothelium and other organ systems.

Chronic inflammation is widely observed in obesity. Obese people commonly have many elevated markers of inflammation, including:
* IL-6 (Interleukin-6)

Low-grade chronic inflammation is characterized by a two- to threefold increase in the systemic concentrations of cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP. Waist circumference correlates significantly with systemic inflammatory response.

Loss of white adipose tissue reduces levels of inflammation markers. As of 2017 the association of systemic inflammation with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and with atherosclerosis was under preliminary research, although rigorous clinical trials had not been conducted to confirm such relationships.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is generated at a higher level in obese people, and may increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases.

== Outcomes ==

The outcome in a particular circumstance will be determined by the tissue in which the injury has occurred—and the injurious agent that is causing it. Here are the possible outcomes to inflammation:

# ResolutionThe complete restoration of the inflamed tissue back to a normal status. Inflammatory measures such as vasodilation, chemical production, and leukocyte infiltration cease, and damaged parenchymal cells regenerate. Such is usually the outcome when limited or short-lived inflammation has occurred.
# FibrosisLarge amounts of tissue destruction, or damage in tissues unable to regenerate, cannot be regenerated completely by the body. Fibrous scarring occurs in these areas of damage, forming a scar composed primarily of collagen. The scar will not contain any specialized structures, such as parenchymal cells, hence functional impairment may occur.
# Abscess formationA cavity is formed containing pus, an opaque liquid containing dead white blood cells and bacteria with general debris from destroyed cells.
# Chronic inflammationIn acute inflammation, if the injurious agent persists then chronic inflammation will ensue. This process, marked by inflammation lasting many days, months or even years, may lead to the formation of a chronic wound. Chronic inflammation is characterised by the dominating presence of macrophages in the injured tissue. These cells are powerful defensive agents of the body, but the toxins they release—including reactive oxygen species—are injurious to the organism&#x27;s own tissues as well as invading agents. As a consequence, chronic inflammation is almost always accompanied by tissue destruction.

== Examples ==
Inflammation is usually indicated by adding the suffix &quot;&quot;, as shown below. However, some conditions, such as asthma and pneumonia, do not follow this convention. More examples are available at List of types of inflammation.

<text>Edema (American English), also spelled oedema (British English), and also known as fluid retention, dropsy and hydropsy, is the build-up of fluid in the body&#x27;s tissue, a type of swelling. Most commonly, the legs or arms are affected. Symptoms may include skin that feels tight, the area feeling heavy, and joint stiffness. Other symptoms depend on the underlying cause.
Causes may include venous insufficiency, heart failure, kidney problems, low protein levels, liver problems, deep vein thrombosis, infections, kwashiorkor, angioedema, certain medications, and lymphedema. It may also occur in immobile patients (stroke, spinal cord injury, aging), or with temporary immobility such as prolonged sitting or standing, and during menstruation or pregnancy. The condition is more concerning if it starts suddenly, or pain or shortness of breath is present.
Treatment depends on the underlying cause. If the underlying mechanism involves sodium retention, decreased salt intake and a diuretic may be used. Elevating the legs and support stockings may be useful for edema of the legs. Older people are more commonly affected. The word is from the Ancient Greek &quot;oídēma&quot; meaning &#x27;swelling&#x27;.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Specific area===
An edema will occur in specific organs as part of inflammations, tendinitis or pancreatitis, for instance. Certain organs develop edema through tissue specific mechanisms. Examples of edema in specific organs:
* Peripheral edema (&quot;dependent&quot; edema of legs) is extracellular fluid accumulation in the lower extremities caused by the effects of gravity, and occurs when fluid pools in the lower parts of the body, including the feet, legs, or hands. This often occurs in immobile patients, such as paraplegics or quadriplegics, pregnant women, or in otherwise healthy people due to hypervolemia or maintaining a standing or seated posture for an extended period of time. It can occur due to diminished venous return of blood to the heart due to congestive heart failure or pulmonary hypertension. It can also occur in patients with increased hydrostatic venous pressure or decreased oncotic venous pressure, due to obstruction of lymphatic or venous vessels draining the lower extremity. Certain drugs (for example, amlodipine) can cause pedal edema.
* Cerebral edema is extracellular fluid accumulation in the brain. It can occur in toxic or abnormal metabolic states and conditions such as systemic lupus or reduced oxygen at high altitudes. It causes drowsiness or loss of consciousness, leading to brain herniation and death.
* Pulmonary edema occurs when the pressure in blood vessels in the lung is raised because of obstruction to the removal of blood via the pulmonary veins. This is usually due to failure of the left ventricle of the heart. It can also occur in altitude sickness or on inhalation of toxic chemicals. Pulmonary edema produces shortness of breath. Pleural effusions may occur when fluid also accumulates in the pleural cavity.
* Edema may also be found in the cornea of the eye with glaucoma, severe conjunctivitis, keratitis, or after surgery. Affected people may perceive coloured haloes around bright lights.
* Edema surrounding the eyes is called periorbital edema (puffy eyes) . The periorbital tissues are most noticeably swollen immediately after waking, perhaps as a result of the gravitational redistribution of fluid in the horizontal position.
* Common appearances of cutaneous edema are observed with mosquito bites, spider bites, bee stings (wheal and flare), and skin contact with certain plants such as poison ivy or western poison oak, the latter of which are termed &quot;contact dermatitis&quot;.
* Another cutaneous form of edema is myxedema, which is caused by increased deposition of connective tissue. In myxedema (and a variety of other rarer conditions) edema is caused by an increased tendency of the tissue to hold water within its extracellular space. In myxedema, this is due to an increase in hydrophilic carbohydrate-rich molecules (perhaps mostly hyaluronin) deposited in the tissue matrix. Edema forms more easily in dependent areas in the elderly (sitting in chairs at home or on aeroplanes) and this is not well understood. Estrogens alter body weight in part through changes in tissue water content. There may be a variety of poorly understood situations in which transfer of water from tissue matrix to lymphatics is impaired because of changes in the hydrophilicity of the tissue or failure of the &#x27;wicking&#x27; function of terminal lymphatic capillaries.
* Myoedema is localized mounding of muscle tissue due to percussive pressure, such as flicking the relaxed muscle with the forefinger and thumb. It produces a mound, visible, firm and non-tender at the point of tactile stimulus approximately 1-2 seconds after stimulus, subsiding back to normal after 5-10 seconds. It is a sign in hypothyroid myopathy, such as Hoffmann syndrome.
* In lymphedema, abnormal removal of interstitial fluid is caused by failure of the lymphatic system. This may be due to obstruction from, for example, pressure from a cancer or enlarged lymph nodes, destruction of lymph vessels by radiotherapy, or infiltration of the lymphatics by infection (such as elephantiasis). It is most commonly due to a failure of the pumping action of muscles due to immobility, most strikingly in conditions such as multiple sclerosis, or paraplegia. It has been suggested that the edema that occurs in some people following use of aspirin-like cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors such as ibuprofen or indomethacin may be due to inhibition of lymph heart action.

=== Generalized ===
A rise in hydrostatic pressure occurs in cardiac failure. A fall in osmotic pressure occurs in nephrotic syndrome and liver failure.

Causes of edema that are generalized to the whole body can cause edema in multiple organs and peripherally. For example, severe heart failure can cause pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, ascites and peripheral edema. Such severe systemic edema is called anasarca. In rare cases, a parvovirus B19 infection may cause generalized edemas.

Although a low plasma oncotic pressure is widely cited for the edema of nephrotic syndrome, most physicians note that the edema may occur before there is any significant protein in the urine (proteinuria) or fall in plasma protein level. Most forms of nephrotic syndrome are due to biochemical and structural changes in the basement membrane of capillaries in the kidney glomeruli, and these changes occur, if to a lesser degree, in the vessels of most other tissues of the body. Thus the resulting increase in permeability that leads to protein in the urine can explain the edema if all other vessels are more permeable as well.

As well as the previously mentioned conditions, edemas often occur during the late stages of pregnancy in some women. This is more common with those of a history of pulmonary problems or poor circulation also being intensified if arthritis is already present in that particular woman. Women who already have arthritic problems most often have to seek medical help for pain caused from over-reactive swelling. Edemas that occur during pregnancy are usually found in the lower part of the leg, usually from the calf down.

Hydrops fetalis is a condition in a baby characterized by an accumulation of fluid in at least two body compartments.

==Cause==
=== Heart ===
The pumping force of the heart should help to keep a normal pressure within the blood vessels. But if the heart begins to fail (a condition known as congestive heart failure) the pressure changes can cause very severe water retention. In this condition water retention is mostly visible in the legs, feet and ankles, but water also collects in the lungs, where it causes a chronic cough. This condition is usually treated with diuretics; otherwise, the water retention may cause breathing problems and additional stress on the heart.

=== Kidneys ===
Another cause of severe water retention is kidney failure, where the kidneys are no longer able to filter fluid out of the blood and turn it into urine. Kidney disease often starts with inflammation, for instance in the case of diseases such as nephrotic syndrome or lupus. This type of water retention is usually visible in the form of swollen legs and ankles.

=== Liver ===
Cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver is a common cause of edema in the legs and abdominal cavity.

=== Veins ===
Phlebetic lymphedema (or phlebolymphedema) is seen in untreated chronic venous insufficiency and is the most common type of edema (approx. 90%). It is a combination venous/lymphatic disorder that originates in defective &quot;leaky&quot; veins that allows the blood to back flow (venous reflux), slowing the return of the blood to the heart (venous stasis). The venous pressure in the legs changes dramatically while standing compared to lying down. How much pressure there is depends on the person&#x27;s height, in the average adult person, it is 8 mm Hg while lying down and 100 mm Hg while standing.

In venous insufficiency, venous stasis results in abnormally high venous pressure (venous hypertension) and greater permeability of blood capillaries (capillary hyperpermeability), to drain the blood through the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system slowly removes excess fluid and proteins from the veins in the lower legs towards the upper body; however, as it is not as efficient as an unimpaired circulatory system, swelling (edema) is visible, particularly in the ankles and lower leg. The chronic increased fluid in the lymphatic system and capillary hyperpermeability causes an inflammatory response which leads to tissue fibrosis of both veins and lymphatic system, opening of arteriovenous shunts, all of which then worsens the condition in a vicious cycle.

=== Others ===
Swollen legs, feet and ankles are common in late pregnancy. The problem is partly caused by the weight of the uterus on the major veins of the pelvis. It usually clears up after delivery of the baby, and is mostly not a cause for concern, though it should always be reported to a doctor.

Lack of exercise is another common cause of water retention in the legs. Exercise helps the leg veins work against gravity to return blood to the heart. If blood travels too slowly and starts to pool in the leg veins, the pressure can force too much fluid out of the leg capillaries into the tissue spaces. The capillaries may break, leaving small blood marks under the skin. The veins themselves can become swollen, painful and distorted – a condition known as varicose veins. Muscle action is needed not only to keep blood flowing through the veins but also to stimulate the lymphatic system to fulfil its &quot;overflow&quot; function. Long-haul flights, lengthy bed-rest, immobility caused by disability and so on, are all potential causes of water retention. Even very small exercises such as rotating ankles and wiggling toes can help to reduce it.

Certain medications are prone to causing water retention. These include estrogens, thereby including drugs for hormone replacement therapy or the combined oral contraceptive pill, as well as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and beta-blockers.

Premenstrual water retention, causing bloating and breast tenderness, is common.

== Mechanism ==
Six factors can contribute to the formation of edema:
# increased hydrostatic pressure;
# reduced colloidal or oncotic pressure within blood vessels;
# increased tissue colloidal or oncotic pressure;
# increased blood vessel wall permeability (such as inflammation);
# obstruction of fluid clearance in the lymphatic system;
# changes in the water-retaining properties of the tissues themselves. Raised hydrostatic pressure often reflects retention of water and sodium by the kidneys.
Generation of interstitial fluid is regulated by the forces of the Starling equation. Hydrostatic pressure within blood vessels tends to cause water to filter out into the tissue. This leads to a difference in protein concentration between blood plasma and tissue. As a result, the colloidal or oncotic pressure of the higher level of protein in the plasma tends to draw water back into the blood vessels from the tissue. Starling&#x27;s equation states that the rate of leakage of fluid is determined by the difference between the two forces and also by the permeability of the vessel wall to water, which determines the rate of flow for a given force imbalance. Most water leakage occurs in capillaries or post capillary venules, which have a semi-permeable membrane wall that allows water to pass more freely than protein. (The protein is said to be reflected and the efficiency of reflection is given by a reflection constant of up to 1.) If the gaps between the cells of the vessel wall open up then permeability to water is increased first, but as the gaps increase in size permeability to protein also increases with a fall in reflection coefficient.

Changes in the variables in Starling&#x27;s equation can contribute to the formation of edemas either by an increase in hydrostatic pressure within the blood vessel, a decrease in the oncotic pressure within the blood vessel or an increase in vessel wall permeability. The latter has two effects. It allows water to flow more freely and it reduces the colloidal or oncotic pressure difference by allowing protein to leave the vessel more easily.

Another set of vessels known as the lymphatic system acts like an &quot;overflow&quot; and can return much excess fluid to the bloodstream. But even the lymphatic system can be overwhelmed, and if there is simply too much fluid, or if the lymphatic system is congested, then the fluid will remain in the tissues, causing swellings in legs, ankles, feet, abdomen or any other part of the body.

==Molecular biology==
The excessive extracellular fluid (interstitial fluid) in edemas is to a substantial degree caused by an increased permeability of the smallest blood vessels (capillaries). This permeability is modulated by numerous biochemical chain reactions and can therefore be unbalanced by many influences.

Involved in these processes are, among others, the transmembrane proteins occludin, claudins, tight junction protein ZO-1, cadherins, catenins and actinin, which are directed by intracellular signal chains, in particular in connection with the enzyme protein kinase C.

==Diagnosis==
Edema may be described as pitting edema or non-pitting edema. Pitting edema is when, after pressure is applied to a small area, the indentation persists after the release of the pressure. Peripheral pitting edema, as shown in the illustration, is the more common type, resulting from water retention. It can be caused by systemic diseases, pregnancy in some women, either directly or as a result of heart failure, or local conditions such as varicose veins, thrombophlebitis, insect bites, and dermatitis.

Non-pitting edema is observed when the indentation does not persist. It is associated with such conditions as lymphedema, lipedema, and myxedema.

Edema caused by malnutrition defines kwashiorkor, an acute form of childhood protein-energy malnutrition characterized by edema, irritability, anorexia, ulcerating dermatoses, and an enlarged liver with fatty infiltrates.

==Treatment==
When possible, treatment involves resolving the underlying cause. Many cases of heart or kidney disease are treated with diuretics.

Treatment may also involve positioning the affected body parts to improve drainage. For example, swelling in feet or ankles may be reduced by having the person lie down in bed or sit with the feet propped up on cushions. Intermittent pneumatic compression can be used to pressurize tissue in a limb, forcing fluids—both blood and lymph—to flow out of the compressed area.

<text>The Quiet Man is a 1952 American romantic comedy drama film directed and produced by John Ford, and starring John Wayne, Maureen O&#x27;Hara, Victor McLaglen, Barry Fitzgerald, Arthur Shields and Ward Bond. The screenplay by Frank S. Nugent was based on a 1933 &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; short story of the same name by Irish author Maurice Walsh, later published as part of a collection titled &quot;The Green Rushes&quot;. The film features Winton Hoch&#x27;s lush photography of the Irish countryside and a long, climactic, semi-comic fist fight.

The film was an official selection of the 1952 Venice Film Festival. John Ford won the Academy Award for Best Director, his fourth, and Winton Hoch won for Best Cinematography. In 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

In the 1920s, Sean &quot;Trooper Thorn&quot; Thornton, an Irish-born American retired boxer, travels from Pittsburgh to his birthplace of Inisfree to purchase the old family farm. Shortly after arriving, he meets and falls in love with fiery, red-headed Mary Kate Danaher, the sister of bullying Squire &quot;Red&quot; Will Danaher. Will also wants to buy the old Thornton property, and is angered when the property&#x27;s current owner, the wealthy Widow Tillane, accepts Sean&#x27;s bid instead of his. Will then retaliates by refusing consent for Sean to marry his sister.

Some village residents, including parish priest Father Peter Lonergan and local matchmaker-cum-bookmaker Michaeleen Óge Flynn, trick Will Danaher into believing that Widow Tillane will marry him if Mary Kate is no longer under his roof. He gleefully allows the marriage, but he refuses to give Mary Kate her dowry when he finds he was deceived, and the Widow Tillane knows nothing about the deal. Sean, unschooled in Irish customs, professes no interest in obtaining the dowry; but to Mary Kate, the dowry represents her personal value to the community and her freedom. She insists that the dowry must be received to validate their marriage, causing an estrangement between her and Sean. The villagers eventually persuade Will to release Mary Kate&#x27;s furniture (which she owns), but Will refuses to hand over the monetary part of the dowry (which is his contribution).

Mary Kate believes Sean is a coward for not fighting Will. Sean goes to the local Church of Ireland minister and fellow former boxer, the Rev. Cyril Playfair, and reveals that he once accidentally killed a younger, married opponent in the ring. Sean had sworn to give up fighting out of fear and guilt over the manslaughter. Mary Kate also confesses (in Irish Gaelic) her part in the quarrel to Father Lonergan, who berates her for her selfishness. She and Sean partially reconcile that night, and they share the bedroom for the first time since their marriage.

However, the next morning, Mary Kate quietly leaves their cottage and boards a train for Dublin, hoping this pretense of leaving will spur Sean to action. Sean soon learns from Michaeleen where she is, races his horse to the railway station, and pulls her off the train. Followed by a growing crowd of villagers, Sean forces Mary Kate to walk with him the back to the Danaher farm. There, Sean confronts Will and demands the dowry money. When Will refuses, Sean throws Mary Kate back at her brother, declaring he will abide by the Irish custom &quot;no fortune, no marriage&quot;. The ultimatum shocks both Mary Kate and Will, who finally pays the £350 (over £17,000 in 2022). Sean immediately burns it in the boiler, abetted by Mary Kate. She proudly leaves for home, but a humiliated Will takes a swing at Sean, only to be knocked down by Sean&#x27;s defensive counter-punch.

A donnybrook ensues, then evolves into a long Homeric fistfight between Sean and Will after they insincerely agree to adhere to the Marquess of Queensberry rules. This much-anticipated match attracts more and more spectators as it continues for miles across the landscape. The fighters finally pause for a drink inside Cohan&#x27;s Bar, where they begrudgingly admit a mutual respect for one another. As they argue over who will pay for the drinks, Will tosses a brew into Sean&#x27;s face. Sean punches Will, sending him falling through the bar doors to lie unconscious in the street, ending the fight. Later, the reconciled and inebriated brothers-in-law stagger arm-in-arm back to Sean and Mary Kate&#x27;s home for supper, much to Mary Kate&#x27;s amusement and delight.

The next day, a humbled Will and the Widow Tillane begin their own courtship, and they ride out of the village side by side in a jaunting car driven by Michaeleen. Sean, Mary Kate, and the villagers wave to them as they pass, before Sean and Mary Kate playfully chase each other across the fields back to the cottage.

==Production==
The film was a departure for Republic Pictures, which backed Ford in what was considered a risky venture at the time. It was the only time the studio, known for low budget B-movies, released a film that would receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.

Ford read the story in 1933 and soon purchased the rights to it for $10. The story&#x27;s author was paid another $2,500 when Republic bought the idea, and he received a final payment of $3,750 when the film was actually made. Republic Pictures agreed to finance the film with O&#x27;Hara and Wayne starring and Ford directing, but only if all three agreed to first film a Western with Republic. They did, and after completing &quot;Rio Grande&quot;, they headed for Ireland to start shooting.

One of the conditions that Republic placed on Ford was that the film run under two hours. However, the finished picture was two hours and nine minutes. When screening the film for Republic executives, Ford stopped the film at approximately two hours in, on the verge of the climactic fistfight. Republic executives relented and allowed the film to run its full length. It was one of the few films that Republic filmed in Technicolor; most of the studio&#x27;s other color films were made in a more economical process known as Trucolor.

The film employed many actors from the Irish theatre, including Barry Fitzgerald&#x27;s brother, Arthur Shields, as well as extras from the Irish countryside, and it is one of the few Hollywood movies in which the Irish language can be heard. Filming commenced on June 7, 1951. All of the outdoor scenes were shot on location in Ireland in County Mayo and County Galway. The inside scenes were filmed toward the end of July at the Republic Studios in Hollywood. Vawn Corrigan reports that Ford made considerable efforts to get the costumes correct for the period with Ó’Maille – The Original House of Style in Galway tasked with sourcing the costumes.

The story is set in the fictional community of Inisfree. This is not the same as the Lake Isle of Innisfree, a place in Lough Gill on the Sligo–Leitrim county border made famous by poet William Butler Yeats, which is a tiny island. Many scenes for the film were actually shot in and around the village of Cong, County Mayo, on the grounds of Cong&#x27;s Ashford Castle. Cong is now a wealthy small town and the castle a 5-star luxury hotel. The connections with the film have led to the area becoming a tourist attraction. In 2008, a pub opened in the building used as the pub in the film (it had actually been a shop at the time when the movie was shot); the pub hosts daily re-runs of the film on DVD. The Quiet Man Fan Club holds its annual general meeting in Ashford Castle. Other locations in the film include Thoor Ballylee, County Galway, home of poet W. B. Yeats for a period, Ballyglunin railway station near Tuam County Galway, which was filmed as Castletown station, and various places in Connemara County Galway and County Mayo. Among those are Lettergesh beach, where the horse race scene was filmed, &quot;The Quiet Man Bridge&quot;, signposted off the N59 road between Maam Cross and Oughterard and the &quot;White O&#x27;Morn&quot; cottage. The latter is located on R336 south of Maam, but long ago fell into ruin.

The film also presents Ford&#x27;s depiction of an idealized Irish society, with only implied social divisions based on class and differences in political or religious affiliations. The Catholic priest, Father Lonergan, and the Protestant minister, Reverend Playfair, maintain a strong friendly relationship throughout the film, which represented the norm in what was then the Irish Free State, where religious tensions occurred in the 1930s but were the norm only in Northern Ireland. One of the allusions to Anglo-Irish animosity occurs after the happy couple is married and a congratulatory toast offered by Hugh Forbes expresses the wish that they live in &quot;national freedom&quot; (the term &quot;national&quot; has been censored from most editions) and before the final donnybrook when Thornton demands his wife&#x27;s dowry from Danaher. Danaher asks Hugh Forbes, who had been commander of the local Irish Republican Army unit during the fight to expel the British, &quot;So the IRA is in this too, ah&quot;, to which Forbes replies, &quot;If it were, not a scorched stone of your fine house would be standing.&quot;

Ernie O&#x27;Malley, an Irish Republican Army officer during the war of independence, commander of the anti-Treaty IRA during the Irish Civil War, and author, acted as an advisor to Ford on the local culture, being on set with him every day. According to O&#x27;Hara, Ford &quot;had a great deal of respect for Ernie...He had such respect for Ernie. They would natter away like old buddies...They liked each other. They were friends&quot;.

This movie is, in many ways a family affair. Francis Ford, who played the old man who gets up from his deathbed to watch the fight, is John Ford&#x27;s older brother. Patrick Ford, the director&#x27;s son, did much of the stunt work for Victor McLaglen during the fight scene, and was a unit director. Arthur Shields, who played the Reverend Playfair, is the younger brother of Barry Fitzgerald, Michaeleen Óge Flynn, who was born William Joseph Shields. Charles B. Fitzsimmons, who played Hugh Forbes, and James O&#x27;Hara, who played Father Paul, are the brothers of Maureen O&#x27;Hara. In addition, four of John Wayne&#x27;s children are seen in the horse race scene.

===Music===
Ford chose his friend, Hollywood composer Victor Young, to compose the score for the film. Young sprinkled the soundtrack with many Irish airs such as the &quot;Rakes of Mallow&quot; and &quot;The Wild Colonial Boy&quot;. One piece of music, chosen by Ford himself, is most prominent: the melody the &quot;Isle of Innisfree&quot;, written not by Young, but by the Irish policeman/songwriter Richard Farrelly. The melody of the &quot;Isle of Innisfree&quot;, which is first heard over the opening credit sequence with Ashford Castle in the background, becomes the principal musical theme of &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;. The melody is reprised at least eleven times throughout the film.

The upbeat melody comically hummed by Michaeleen Oge Flynn and later played on the accordion is the &quot;Rakes of Mallow&quot;.

A portion of the Irish version of &quot;The Wild Colonial Boy&quot; is played throughout the film.

When Maureen O&#x27;Hara died in October 2015, her family stated she listened to music from &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; during her final hours. Filmmaker George A. Romero was also said to have died listening to the score.

==Reception==
In 1952 A.H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; viewed the film &quot;as darlin&#x27; a picture as we&#x27;ve seen this year,&quot; with &quot;dialogue that is as tuneful as a lark&#x27;s song.&quot; In another contemporary review, the entertainment trade paper &quot;Variety&quot; called the picture &quot;beautifully filmed&quot; and wrote that &quot;Wayne works well under Ford&#x27;s direction,&quot; but found the 129-minute running time &quot;unnecessary.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; described the film as &quot;a delightful and rollicking comedy melodrama of Irish life, directed with skill and acted with gusto by a fine cast.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared it &quot;a complete jim-dandy ... The photography is glorious and Victor Young&#x27;s score, inspired by folk airs, is a complete joy for an exuberant, vigorous picture.&quot; Philip Hamburger of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was not so taken with the film, writing, &quot;If am to believe what I saw in John Ford&#x27;s sentimental new film, &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;, practically everybody in Ireland is just as cute as a button,&quot; adding, &quot;Mr. Ford&#x27;s scenes of the Irish countryside are often breathtaking ... but the master who made &quot;The Informer&quot; appears to have fallen into a vat of treacle.&quot;

On the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; in 2023 has a 91% approval rating based on reviews from 46 critics. Critical consensus on the website states, &quot;Director John Ford and star John Wayne depart the Western for the Irish countryside, and the result is a beautifully photographed, often comedic romance.&quot;

The film was also a financial success, grossing $3.8 million in its first year of release. This was among the top ten grosses of the year. It was also the seventh most popular film for British audiences in 1952.

<doc id="70432" wikidata="Q1337916" url="?curid=70432" title="Emic and etic">
<text>In anthropology, folkloristics, linguistics, and the social and behavioral sciences, emic () and etic () refer to two kinds of field research done and viewpoints obtained.

The &quot;emic&quot; approach is an insider&#x27;s perspective, which looks at the beliefs, values, and practices of a particular culture from the perspective of the people who live within that culture. This approach aims to understand the cultural meaning and significance of a particular behavior or practice, as it is understood by the people who engage in it.

The &quot;etic&quot; approach, on the other hand, is an outsider&#x27;s perspective, which looks at a culture from the perspective of an outside observer or researcher. This approach tends to focus on the observable behaviors and practices of a culture, and aims to understand them in terms of their functional or evolutionary significance. The etic approach often involves the use of standardized measures and frameworks to compare different cultures and may involve the use of concepts and theories from other disciplines, such as psychology or sociology.

The emic and etic approaches each have their own strengths and limitations, and each can be useful in understanding different aspects of culture and behavior. Some anthropologists argue that a combination of both approaches is necessary for a complete understanding of a culture, while others argue that one approach may be more appropriate depending on the specific research question being addressed.

==Definitions==
&quot;The emic approach investigates how local people think...&quot;. How they perceive and categorize the world, their rules for behavior, what has meaning for them, and how they imagine and explain things. &quot;The etic (scientist-oriented) approach shifts the focus from local observations, categories, explanations, and interpretations to those of the anthropologist. The etic approach realizes that members of a culture often are too involved in what they are doing... to interpret their cultures impartially. When using the etic approach, the ethnographer emphasizes what he or she considers important.&quot;

Although emics and etics are sometimes regarded as inherently in conflict and one can be preferred to the exclusion of the other, the complementarity of emic and etic approaches to anthropological research has been widely recognized, especially in the areas of interest concerning the characteristics of human nature as well as the form and function of human social systems.

Emic and etic approaches of understanding behavior and personality fall under the study of cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropology states that people are shaped by their cultures and their subcultures, and we must account for this in the study of personality. One way is looking at things through an emic approach. This approach &quot;is culture specific because it focuses on a single culture and it is understood on its own terms.&quot; As explained below, the term &quot;emic&quot; originated from the specific linguistic term &quot;phonemic&quot;, from &quot;phoneme&quot;, which is a language-specific way of abstracting speech sounds.

* An &#x27;emic&#x27; account is a description of behavior or a belief in terms meaningful (consciously or unconsciously) to the actor; that is, an emic account comes from a person within the culture. Almost anything from within a culture can provide an emic account.
* An &#x27;etic&#x27; account is a description of a behavior or belief by a social analyst or scientific observer (a student or scholar of anthropology or sociology, for example), in terms that can be applied across cultures; that is, an etic account attempts to be &#x27;culturally neutral&#x27;, limiting any ethnocentric, political or cultural bias or alienation by the observer.

When these two approaches are combined, the &quot;richest&quot; view of a culture or society can be understood. On its own, an emic approach would struggle with applying overarching values to a single culture. The etic approach is helpful in enabling researchers to see more than one aspect of one culture, and in applying observations to cultures around the world.

==History==
The terms were coined in 1954 by linguist Kenneth Pike, who argued that the tools developed for describing linguistic behaviors could be adapted to the description of any human social behavior. As Pike noted, social scientists have long debated whether their knowledge is objective or subjective. Pike&#x27;s innovation was to turn away from an epistemological debate and turn instead to a methodological solution. &quot;Emic&quot; and &quot;etic&quot; are derived from the linguistic terms &quot;phonemic&quot; and &quot;phonetic&quot;, respectively, where a &quot;phone&quot; is a distinct speech sound or gesture (such distinction being referred to as &quot;phonetic&quot;), regardless of whether the exact sound is critical to the meanings of words, whereas a &quot;phoneme&quot; is a speech sound in a given language that, if swapped with another phoneme, could change one word to another. The possibility of a truly objective description was discounted by Pike himself in his original work; he proposed the emic–etic dichotomy in anthropology as a way around philosophic issues about the very nature of objectivity.

The terms were also championed by anthropologists Ward Goodenough and Marvin Harris with slightly different connotations from those used by Pike. Goodenough was primarily interested in understanding the culturally specific meaning of specific beliefs and practices; Harris was primarily interested in explaining human behavior.

Pike, Harris, and others have argued that cultural &quot;insiders&quot; and &quot;outsiders&quot; are equally capable of producing emic &quot;and&quot; etic accounts of their culture. Some researchers use &quot;etic&quot; to refer to outsider accounts, and &quot;emic&quot; to refer to insider accounts.

Margaret Mead was an anthropologist who studied the patterns of adolescence in Samoa. She discovered that the difficulties and the transitions that adolescents faced are culturally influenced. The hormones that are released during puberty can be defined using an etic framework, because adolescents globally have the same hormones being secreted. However, Mead concluded that how adolescents respond to these hormones is greatly influenced by their cultural norms. Through her studies, Mead found that simple classifications about behaviors and personality could not be used because peoples’ cultures influenced their behaviors in such a radical way. Her studies helped create an emic approach of understanding behaviors and personality. Her research deduced that culture has a significant impact in shaping an individual&#x27;s personality.

Carl Jung, a Swiss psychoanalyst, is a researcher who took an emic approach in his studies. Jung studied mythology, religion, ancient rituals, and dreams, leading him to believe that there are archetypes that can be identified and used to categorize people&#x27;s behaviors. Archetypes are universal structures of the collective unconscious that refer to the inherent way people are predisposed to perceive and process information. The main archetypes that Jung studied were the persona (how people choose to present themselves to the world), the anima and animus (part of people experiencing the world in viewing the opposite sex, that guides how they select their romantic partner), and the shadow (dark side of personalities because people have a concept of evil; well-adjusted people must integrate both good and bad parts of themselves). Jung looked at the role of the mother and deduced that all people have mothers and see their mothers in a similar way; they offer nurture and comfort. His studies also suggest that &quot;infants have evolved to suck milk from the breast, it is also the case that all children have inborn tendencies to react in certain ways.&quot; This way of looking at the mother is an emic way of applying a concept cross-culturally and universally.

==Importance as regards personality==
Emic and etic approaches are important to understanding personality because problems can arise &quot;when concepts, measures, and methods are carelessly transferred to other cultures in attempts to make cross-cultural generalizations about personality.&quot; It is hard to apply certain generalizations of behavior to people who are so diverse and culturally different. One example of this is the F-scale (Macleod). The F-scale, which was created by Theodor Adorno, is used to measure authoritarian personality, which can, in turn, be used to predict prejudiced behaviors. This test, when applied to Americans, accurately depicts prejudices towards black individuals. However, when a study was conducted in South Africa using the F-Scale (Pettigrew and Friedman), results did not predict any prejudices towards black individuals. This study used emic approaches of study by conducting interviews with the locals and etic approaches by giving participants generalized personality tests.

<text>The Battle of Vimy Ridge was part of the Battle of Arras, in the Pas-de-Calais department of France, during the First World War. The main combatants were the four divisions of the Canadian Corps in the First Army, against three divisions of the German 6th Army. The battle occurred from 9 to 12 April 1917, marking the commencement of the Battle of Arras and serving as the inaugural assault of the Nivelle Offensive. The objective was to draw German reserves away from the French forces, preparing for a crucial offensive along the Aisne and the Chemin des Dames ridge several days later.

The Canadian Corps was to capture the German-held high ground of Vimy Ridge, an escarpment on the northern flank of the Arras front. This would protect the First Army and the Third Army farther south from German enfilade fire. Supported by a creeping barrage, the Canadian Corps captured most of the ridge during the first day. The village of Thélus fell during the second day, as did the crest of the ridge, once the Canadian Corps overran a salient against considerable German resistance. The final objective, a fortified knoll outside the village of Givenchy-en-Gohelle, fell to the Canadians on 12 April. The German 6th Army then retreated to the Oppy–Méricourt line.

Historians attribute the success of the Canadian Corps to technical and tactical innovation, meticulous planning, powerful artillery support and extensive training, as well as the inability of the 6th Army to properly apply the new German defensive doctrine. The battle was the first occasion when the four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force fought together and it was made a symbol of Canadian national achievement and sacrifice. A portion of the former battleground serves as a memorial park and site of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial.
==Background==

===Vimy Ridge 1914–1916===

Vimy Ridge is an escarpment northeast of Arras on the western edge of the Douai Plain. The ridge rises gradually on its western side and drops more quickly on the eastern side. At approximately in length and culminating at an elevation of or above the Douai Plains, the ridge provides a natural unobstructed view for tens of kilometres in all directions. The ridge fell under German control in October 1914 during the Race to the Sea as the Franco-British and German forces attempted to outflank each other through northeastern France. The French Tenth Army attempted to dislodge the Germans from the region during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915 by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and Notre Dame de Lorette. The French 1st Moroccan Division managed to briefly capture the height of the ridge but was unable to hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements. The French made another attempt during the Third Battle of Artois in September 1915 but only captured the village of Souchez at the western base of the ridge. The Vimy sector calmed following the offensive with both sides taking a largely live and let live approach. The French suffered approximately 150,000 casualties in their attempts to gain control of Vimy Ridge and surrounding territory.

===1916–1917===

The French Tenth Army was relieved in February 1916 by XVII Corps (Lieutenant-General Sir Julian Byng) and transferred to join in the Battle of Verdun. The British soon discovered that German tunnelling companies had taken advantage of the relative calm on the surface to build an extensive network of tunnels and deep mines from which they would attack French positions by setting off explosive charges underneath their trenches. The Royal Engineers sent specialist tunnelling companies to the ridge to combat the German mining operations and German artillery and trench mortar fire intensified in early May 1916. On 21 May 1916, after shelling the British forward trenches and divisional artillery positions from eighty hidden batteries on the reverse slope of the ridge, the German infantry began , an attack on the British lines along a front, to eject them from positions along the ridge. The Germans captured several British-controlled tunnels and mine craters before halting their advance and digging in. Small counter-attacks by battalions of the 140th and 141st Brigades took place on 22 May but were failed. The Canadian Corps relieved IV Corps along the western slopes of Vimy Ridge in October 1916.

==Prelude==

===Strategy===
On 28 May 1916, Byng took command of the Canadian Corps from Lieutenant-General Sir Edwin Alderson. Discussions for a spring offensive near Arras began, following a formal conference of corps commanders held at the First Army Headquarters (HQ) on 21 November 1916. In March 1917, the army HQ formally presented Byng with orders giving Vimy Ridge as the Canadian Corps objective for the Arras Offensive.

A plan, adopted in early March 1917, drew on the briefings of staff officers sent to learn from the experiences of the French Army during the Battle of Verdun. For the first time the four Canadian divisions would fight together. The nature and size of the attack needed more resources than the Canadian Corps possessed and the British 5th Division, artillery, engineer and labour units were attached to the corps, bringing the nominal strength of the Canadian Corps to about 170,000 men, of whom 97,184 were Canadian.

===Tactics===

In January 1917, three Canadian Corps officers accompanied other British and Dominion officers attending lectures by the French Army on their experiences during the Battle of Verdun. The French counter-offensive devised by General Robert Nivelle had been one of a number of Allied successes of 1916. Following extensive rehearsal, eight French divisions had assaulted German positions in two waves along a front. Supported by extremely powerful artillery, the French had recovered lost ground and inflicted severe casualties on five German divisions.

On their return from the lectures, the Canadian Corps staff officers produced a tactical analysis of the Verdun battles and delivered corps and divisional-level lectures to promote the primacy of artillery and stress the importance of harassing fire and company and platoon flexibility. The report of the 1st Canadian Division commander, Arthur Currie, highlighted the lessons he believed the Canadian Corps could learn from the experiences of the French. The final plan for the assault on Vimy Ridge drew on the experience and tactical analysis of the officers who attended the Verdun lectures. The First Army commander, General Henry Horne approved the plan on 5 March 1917.
The plan divided the Canadian Corps advance into four coloured objective lines. The attack would be made on a front of , with its centre opposite the village of Vimy, to the east of the ridge. The first objective, the Black Line, was the German forward defensive position. The final objective of the northern flank was the Red Line, taking the highest point on the ridge, the fortified knoll known as the Pimple, la Folie Farm, the (intermediate position) and the hamlet of Les Tilleuls. The southern two divisions were to achieve two more objectives, the Blue Line, encompassing the village of Thélus and the woods outside the village of Vimy and the Brown Line, which aimed at capturing (Twelve Trench) and the German second position. The infantry would advance close to a creeping barrage by field guns, advancing in timed increments. The medium and heavy howitzers would establish a series of standing barrages further ahead of the infantry against defensive positions.

The plan called for units to leapfrog as the advance progressed, to maintain momentum during the attack. The initial wave would capture and consolidate the Black Line and then push forward to the Red Line. The barrage would pause for reserve units to move up, then move forward with the units pushing beyond the Red Line to the Blue Line. Once the troops secured the Blue Line, advancing units would once again leapfrog them and capture the Brown Line. Conducted properly, the plan would leave the German forces little time to exit their deep dugouts and defend their positions against the infantry. If the corps maintained its schedule, the troops would advance as much as and have the majority of the ridge under control by 1:00pm on the first day.

===German defences===
The experience of the Battle of the Somme led the German command to conclude that the policy of rigidly defending a trench position was no longer effective against the firepower that the Entente armies had accumulated. Ludendorff published a new defensive doctrine in December 1916, in which deeper defences were to be built, within which the garrison would have room to manoeuvre, rather than rigidly holding successive lines of trenches. Along Vimy Ridge, the German forces had spent two years constructing fortifications designed for rigid defence. An extensive network of tunnels and trenches south of Neuville St Vaast was known as &quot;The Labyrinth&quot;. Little reconstruction based upon the new defence-in-depth doctrine had been accomplished by April 1917 because the terrain made it impractical.

The ridge was across at its narrowest point, with a steep drop on the eastern side, all but eliminating the possibility of counterattacks if the ridge was captured. The Germans were apprehensive about the inherent weakness of the Vimy Ridge defences. Their defensive scheme was to maintain a front line defence of sufficient strength to withstand an initial assault and move operational reserves forward, before the enemy could consolidate their gains or overrun the remaining German positions. The German defence at Vimy Ridge relied largely on the firepower of machine guns.

Three divisions, comprising seven infantry regiments were responsible for the immediate defence of the ridge. The paper strength of each division was approximately 15,000 men but their actual strength was significantly lower. In 1917, a full-strength German rifle company was 264 men; at Vimy Ridge, each rifle company contained approximately 150 men. Each German regiment held a zone approximately wide, as far back as the rear area. When the Canadian Corps attacked, each German company faced two or more battalions of approximately 1,000 men each. Reserve divisions were kept about back instead of assembling close behind the second line according to the defence-in-depth theory.

===Artillery===

The eight field artillery brigades of the Canadian Corps divisional artillery and two heavy artillery groups were reinforced with British artillery units. Four heavy artillery groups, nine field artillery brigades, three divisional artillery groups and the artillery complement of the 5th Division was attached to the Canadian Corps. Ten heavy artillery groups of the flanking I and XVII Corps were assigned tasks in support of the Canadian Corps. The artillery batteries of I Corps were particularly important because they enfiladed German gun positions behind Vimy Ridge. The British provided twenty-four brigade artillery groups consisting of four hundred and eighty 18 pounder field guns, one hundred and thirty-eight 4.5 inch howitzers, ninety-six 2 inch trench mortars, twenty-four 9.45 inch mortars, supported by 245 siege guns and heavy mortars. This firepower gave a density of one heavy gun for every and one field gun for every of the corps frontage, representing a considerable average increase, including three times the heavy guns over the distribution of artillery at the Battle of the Somme in 1916.

On 8 February, the First Army issued a 3,000-word artillery plan devised by Horne and his principal artillery commander, Major General H. F. Mercer. Brigadier-General Edward Morrison developed and issued a 35-page multi-phased fire support plan called &quot;Canadian Corps Artillery Instruction No.1 for the Capture of Vimy Ridge&quot; to support the efforts of the infantry. The Canadian Corps received three times the artillery normally assigned to a corps for regular operations. To manage the supply of the extra guns, the Royal Artillery staff officer, Major Alan Brooke, coordinated communication and transport plans to work with the barrage plans.

A 1.6million shell allotment allowed the artillery along the Canadian Corps front to maintain a high rate of fire. Improvements in the quality of the shells ensured fewer duds. The new instantaneous No. 106 fuze greatly improved the effectiveness of the artillery since this fuse burst reliably with the slightest of contact, unlike older timed fuses, making it especially effective at wire cutting before the advance. To maintain communications during the battle, particularly with the artillery, field units laid over of telegraph and field telephone cabling, normally at a depth of . The corps conducted coordinated counter-battery shoots before the battle. The First Army Field Survey Company printed barrage maps for all batteries, produced artillery boards and provided counter-battery support with their flash spotting groups and sound ranging sections. Using flash spotting, sound ranging and aerial reconnaissance from 16 Squadron and Balloon Companies Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in the week before the battle, the counter-battery artillery under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew McNaughton fired 125,900 shells, harassing an estimated 83 per cent of the German gun positions.

===Training===

In February 1917, the British General Staff released a training pamphlet &quot;SS 143 Instructions for the Training of Platoons for Offensive Action&quot;, espousing the return to the pre-war emphasis on fire and movement tactics and the use of the platoon as the basic tactical unit. The pamphlet noted the importance of specialist hand grenade, rifle grenade, rifle and Lewis gun sections in suppressing enemy strong points by exploiting the characteristics of different weapons to fight forward, allowing other units to advance. Coupled with the observations and suggestions made by Currie in the report he submitted in January 1917 following the Verdun lectures, the Canadian Corps instilled the tactical change with vigour. The corps implemented the tactical doctrine for small units by assigning objectives down to the platoon. Assaulting infantry battalions used hills behind the lines as full-scale models of the battlefield.

Taped lines demarcated German trench lines while officers on horseback carried flags to represent the advancing front of the artillery barrage. Recognizing that leaders were likely to be wounded or killed, soldiers learned the jobs of those beside and above them. At the First Army headquarters, a large plasticine model of the Vimy sector was constructed and used to show commissioned and senior non-commissioned officers the topographical features of the battlefield and details of the German trench system. Upwards of 40,000 topographical trench maps were printed and distributed to ensure that even platoon sergeants and section commanders possessed a wider awareness of the battlefield. The new measures gave each platoon a clearer picture of how it fitted into the greater battle plan and in so doing, reduced the command problems that plagued First World War operations.

===Underground operations===
Operations along the Vimy Ridge were accompanied by extensive excavations. The Arras–Vimy sector was conducive to tunnelling, owing to the soft, porous, yet extremely stable nature of the chalk underground. Mine warfare had been conducted on the Vimy sector since 1915 and Bavarian engineers had blown twenty mines in the sector by March 1915. By early 1916, German miners had gained an advantage over their French counterparts. British tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers took over from the French between February and May 1916.

On their arrival, the British began offensive mining against German miners, first stopping the German underground advance and then developing a defensive strategy that prevented the Germans from gaining a tactical advantage by mining. From spring 1916, the British had deployed five tunnelling companies along the Vimy Ridge and during the first two months of their tenure of the area, 70 mines were fired, mostly by the Germans. Between October 1915 and April 1917 an estimated 150 French, British and German charges were fired in this sector of the Western Front. In May 1916, Operation Schleswig-Holstein, a German infantry attack, forced the British back , to stop British mining by capturing the shaft entrances. In the second half of 1916, the British constructed strong defensive underground positions and from August 1916, the Royal Engineers developed a mining scheme for a big infantry attack on the Vimy Ridge proposed for autumn 1916, although this was postponed. After September 1916, when the Royal Engineers had completed their network of defensive galleries along most of the front line, offensive mining largely ceased although activities continued until 1917. The British gallery network beneath Vimy Ridge eventually grew to a length of .

The Canadian Corps was posted to the northern part of Vimy Ridge in October 1916 and preparations for an attack were revived in February 1917. Twelve subways, up to long were excavated at a depth of and used to connect reserve lines to front lines, permitting soldiers to advance to the front quickly, securely and unseen. Often incorporated into subways were light rail lines, hospitals, command posts, water reservoirs, ammunition stores, mortar and machine gun posts and communication centres. The Germans dug a number of similar tunnels on the Vimy front, to provide covered routes to the front line and protection for headquarters, resting personnel, equipment, and ammunition. The Germans also conducted counter-mining against the British tunnellers and destroyed a number of British attempts to plant mines under or near their lines.

Prior to the battle, the British tunnelling companies secretly laid 13 mines under German positions, to destroy surface fortifications before the assault. To protect some advancing troops from German machine gun fire as they crossed no man&#x27;s land during the attack, eight smaller &quot;Wombat&quot; charges were laid at the end of the subways to allow troops to move more quickly and safely enter the German trench system by creating an elongated trench-depth crater that spanned the length of no man&#x27;s land. At the same time, 19 crater groups existed along this section of the Western Front, each with several large craters. To assess the consequences of infantry having to advance across cratered ground after a mining attack, officers from the Canadian Corps visited La Boisselle and Fricourt where the mines had been blown on the First day of the Somme. Their reports and the experience of the Canadians at The Actions of St Eloi Craters in April 1916, where mines had so altered and damaged the landscape as to render occupation of the mine craters by the infantry all but impossible, led to the decision to remove offensive mining from the central sector allocated to the Canadian Corps at Vimy Ridge. Further British mines in the area were vetoed following the blowing by the Germans on 23 March 1917 of nine craters along no man&#x27;s land as it was probable that the Germans were aiming to restrict an attack to predictable points. The three mines laid by 172nd Tunnelling Company were also dropped from the British plans. The mines were left in place after the assault and were only removed in the 1990s. Another mine, prepared by 176th Tunnelling Company against the German strongpoint known as the Pimple, was not completed in time for the attack. The gallery had been pushed silently through the clay, avoiding the sandy and chalky layers of the Vimy Ridge but by 9 April 1917 was still short of its target. In the end, two mines were blown before the attack, while three mines and two &quot;Wombat&quot; charges were fired to support the attack, including those forming a northern flank.

===Trench raiding===

Trench raiding involved making small-scale surprise attacks on enemy positions, often in the middle of the night for reasons of stealth. All belligerents employed trench raiding as a tactic to harass their enemy and gain intelligence. In the Canadian Corps trench raiding developed into a training and leadership-building mechanism. The size of a raid would normally be anything from a few men to an entire company, or more, depending on the size of the mission. The four months before the April attack saw the Canadian Corps execute no fewer than 55 separate trench raids. Competition between units even developed with units competing for the honour of the greatest number of prisoners captured or most destruction wrought. The policy of aggressive trench raiding was not without its cost. A large-scale trench raid on 13 February 1917, involving 900 men from the 4th Canadian Division, resulted in 150 casualties. An even more ambitious trench raid, using chlorine gas, on 1 March 1917, once again by the 4th Canadian Division, failed and resulted in 637 casualties including two battalion commanders and a number of company commanders killed. This experience did not lessen the extent to which the Canadian Corps employed trench raiding with raids being conducted nightly between 20 March and the opening of the offensive on 9 April, resulting in approximately 1,400 additional Canadian casualties. The Germans operated an active patrolling policy and although not as large and ambitious as those of the Canadian Corps, they also engaged in trench raiding. As an example, a German trench raid launched by 79 men against the 3rd Canadian Division on 15 March 1917 was successful in capturing prisoners and causing damage.

===Air operations===

The RFC launched a determined effort to gain air superiority over the battlefield in support of the spring offensive. The Canadians considered activities such as artillery observation and photography of opposing trench systems, troop movements and gun emplacements essential to continue their offensive. The Royal Flying Corps deployed 25 squadrons totalling 365 aircraft along the Arras sector, outnumbering the (Imperial German Air Service) by 2-to-1. Byng was given use of No. 2 Squadron, No. 8 (Naval) Squadron, No. 25 Squadron, No. 40 Squadron and No. 43 Squadron, with No. 16 Squadron permanently attached to the Canadian Corps and employed exclusively for reconnaissance and artillery-observation.

Aerial reconnaissance was often a hazardous task because of the necessity of flying at slow speeds and low altitudes. The task was made more dangerous with the arrival of German air reinforcements, including the highly experienced and well-equipped Jasta 11 which led to a sharp increase in RFC losses. Although significantly outnumbering the Germans, the RFC lost 131 aircraft during the first week of April (Bloody April). Despite the losses suffered by the RFC, the failed to prevent the British from carrying out its priority, air support of the army during the Battle of Arras with up-to-date aerial photographs and other reconnaissance information.

German 6th Army commander General Ludwig von Falkenhausen was responsible for the Cambrai–Lille sector and commanded 20 divisions, plus reserves. Vimy Ridge itself was principally defended by the ad hoc formation based under I Bavarian Reserve Corps commander Karl von Fasbender. However, a division of , under VIII Reserve Corps General of the Infantry Georg Karl Wichura, was involved in the frontline defence along the northernmost portion of the ridge.

Three divisions were responsible for manning the frontline defences opposite the Canadian Corps. The 16th Bavarian Division was located opposite the village of Souchez and responsible for the defence of the northernmost section of the ridge. The division had been created in January 1917 by amalgamating existing Bavarian formations and had so far only opposed the Canadian Corps. The 79th Reserve Division was responsible for the defence of the vast central section, including the highest point of the ridge, Hill 145. The 79th Reserve Division had fought for two years on the Eastern Front before being transferred to the Vimy sector at the end of February 1917. The 1st Bavarian Reserve Division had been in the Arras area since October 1914 and held the villages of Thélus, Bailleul and the southern slope of the ridge.

Byng commanded four attacking divisions, one division in reserve and numerous support units. He was supported to the north by the 24th Division, I Corps, which advanced north of the Souchez River and by the XVII Corps to the south. The 4th Canadian Division was responsible for the northern portion of the advance that included the capture of the highest point of the ridge, followed by the elaborately fortified Pimple just west of the village of Givenchy-en-Gohelle. The 3rd Canadian Division was responsible for the narrow central section of the ridge, including the capture of La Folie Farm. The 2nd Canadian Division, which later included a brigade from the 5th Division, was directly south of the 3rd Canadian Division and entrusted with the capture of the village of Thélus. The 1st Canadian Division was responsible for the broad southern sector of the corps advance and expected to cover the longest distance. Byng planned for a healthy reserve for contingencies that included the relief of forward troops, help in consolidating positions and aiding the 4th Canadian Division with the capture of the Pimple. As a result, the 9th Canadian Brigade and the British 15th and 95th Brigades were kept in corps reserve.
===Preliminary attack===
Foreign intelligence gathering by the Germans, big Allied trench raids and troop concentrations seen west of Arras, made it clear to the Germans that a spring offensive in the area was being prepared. In February 1917, a German-born Canadian soldier deserted and helped confirm many of the suspicions held by the Germans, providing them with a great deal of useful information. By March 1917, the 6th Army knew that an offensive was imminent and would include operations aimed at capturing Vimy Ridge. General of Infantry Ernst August Marx von Bachmeister, commanding the German 79th Reserve Division, reported in late March that he believed the Canadian Corps was moving into an echelon formation and were preparing for a big attack. The Germans quickly planned Operation Munich (), a spoiling attack to capture the northern section of the Zouave Valley, along the northernmost portion of the Canadian front. Munich was not undertaken because the extent of Canadian Corps artillery fire made it impracticable.

The preliminary phase of the Canadian Corps artillery bombardment began on 20 March 1917, with a systematic two-week bombardment of German batteries, trenches and strong points. The Canadian Corps gunners paid particular attention to eliminating German barbed wire, a task made easier with the introduction of the No. 106 instantaneous fuse. Only half of the artillery fired at once and the intensity of the barrage was varied to confuse the Germans about Canadian intentions. Phase two lasted the week beginning 2 April 1917 and employed all of the guns supporting the Canadian Corps, massing the equivalent of a heavy gun for every and a field gun for every . The German soldiers came to refer to the week before the attack as &quot;the week of suffering&quot;. In the German account, their trenches and defensive works were almost completely demolished. The health and morale of the German troops suffered from the stress of remaining at the ready for eleven straight days under extremely heavy artillery bombardment. Compounding German difficulties was the inability of ration parties to bring food supplies to the front lines. On 3 April, General von Falkenhausen ordered his reserve divisions to prepare to relieve front line divisions over the course of a long drawn-out defensive battle in a manner similar to the Battle of the Somme and the divisions were kept from the battlefield to avoid being shelled.

===Main assault===

====9 April====

The attack was to begin at 5:30am on Easter Monday, 9 April 1917. The attack was originally planned for the morning of 8 April (Easter Sunday) but it was postponed for 24hours at the request of the French. During the late hours of 8 April and early morning of 9 April the men of the leading and supporting wave of the attack were moved into their forward assembly positions. The weather was cold and later changed to sleet and snow. Although physically discomforting for everyone, the northwesterly storm provided some advantage to the assaulting troops by blowing snow in the faces of the defending troops. Light Canadian and British artillery bombardments continued throughout the night but stopped in the few minutes before the attack, as the artillery recalibrated their guns in preparation for the synchronized barrage. At 5:30am, every artillery piece at the disposal of the Canadian Corps began firing. Thirty seconds later, engineers detonated the mine charges laid under no man&#x27;s land and the German trench line, destroying a number of German strong points and creating secure communication trenches directly across no man&#x27;s land.

Field guns laid down a barrage that mostly advanced at a rate of in three minutes while medium and heavy howitzers established a series of standing barrages further ahead against known defensive systems. During the early fighting, the German divisional artilleries, despite many losses, were able to maintain their defensive firing. As the Canadian assault advanced, it overran many of the German guns because large numbers of their draught horses had been killed in the initial gas attack. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Canadian Divisions reported reaching and capturing their first objective, the Black Line, by 6:25am. The 4th Canadian Division encountered a great deal of trouble during its advance and was unable to complete its first objective until some hours later. After a planned pause when the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Canadian Divisions consolidated their positions, the advance resumed. Shortly after 7:00am, the 1st Canadian Division captured the left half of its second objective, the Red Line and moved the 1st Canadian Brigade forward to mount an attack on the remainder. The 2nd Canadian Division reported reaching the Red Line and capturing the village of Les Tilleuls at approximately the same time.
A mine explosion that killed many German troops of Reserve Infantry Regiment 262 manning the front line, preceded the advance of the 3rd Canadian Division. The remaining German troops could do no more than man temporary lines of resistance until later manning a full defence at the German third line. As a result, the southern section of the 3rd Canadian Division was able to reach the Red Line at the western edge of the Bois de la Folie at around 7:30am. At 9:00am the division learned of its exposed left flank, as the 4th Canadian Division had not yet captured Hill 145. The 3rd Canadian Division was thus called upon to establish a divisional defensive flank to its north. Although the German commanders were able to maintain open lines of communication and issue orders, even with swift staff work the tempo of the assault was such that the German decision cycle was unable to react decisively.

The only portion of the Canadian assault that did not go as planned was the advance of the 4th Canadian Division, collapsing almost immediately after exiting their trenches. The commanding officer of one of the assaulting battalions requested that the artillery leave a portion of the German trench undamaged. Machine gun nests in the undamaged sections of the German line pinned down, wounded, or killed much of the 4th Canadian Division&#x27;s right flank. The progress on the left flank was eventually impeded by harassing fire from the Pimple that was made worse when the creeping barrage got too far ahead of the advancing troops. In view of the German defence, the 4th Canadian Division did not attempt a further frontal assault throughout the afternoon.
Reserve units from the 4th Canadian Division came forward and once again attacked the German positions on the top of the ridge. Persistent attacks eventually forced the German troops holding the southwestern portion of Hill145 to withdraw after they ran out of ammunition, mortar rounds, and grenades. Towards midday, the 79th Reserve Division was ordered to recapture the portions of its third line lost during the progression of the Canadian attack. However, it was not until 6:00pm that the force was able to organize and counterattack, clearing the Canadian Corps troops out of the ruined village of Vimy, but not recapturing the third line south of the village. By night time, the German forces holding the top of the ridge believed they had overcome the immediate crisis for the time being. Additional German reinforcements began arriving and by late evening portions of the 111th Infantry Division occupied the third line near Acheville and Arleux, with the remainder of the division arriving the following day.

====10 April====

The British moved three fresh brigades up to the Red Line by 9:30am on 10 April to support the advance of the 1st and 2nd Canadian Division, whereupon they were to leapfrog existing units occupying the Red line and advance to the Blue Line. Fresh units including two sections of tanks and the 13th British Brigade were called up from reserve to support the advance of the 2nd Canadian Division. By approximately 11:00am, the Blue Line, including Hill 135 and the village of Thélus, had been captured. To permit the troops time to consolidate the Blue Line, the advance halted and the barrage remained stationary for 90 minutes while machine guns were brought forward. Shortly before 1:00pm, the advance recommenced with both the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions reporting their final objective. The tank-supported advance via Farbus and directed at the rear of the 79th Reserve Division, was eventually halted by concentrated German fire short of the village. The Canadian 1st and 2nd Divisions were nonetheless able to secure the Brown Line by approximately 2:00pm.

The 4th Canadian Division had made an attempt to capture the northern half of Hill 145 at around 3:15pm, briefly capturing the peak before a German counterattack retook the position. The Germans occupying the small salient on the ridge soon found themselves being attacked along their flanks by continuously reinforced Canadian Corps troops. When it became obvious that the position was completely outflanked and there was no prospect of reinforcement, the German troops pulled back. The German forces were evacuated off the ridge with German artillery batteries moved west of the Vimy–Bailleul railway embankment or to the Oppy–Méricourt line. By nightfall of 10 April, the only Canadian objective not yet achieved was the capture of the Pimple.

====12 April====
The 4th Canadian Division faced difficulties at the start of the battle that forced it to delay its assault on the Pimple until 12 April. The Pimple was initially defended by the 16th Bavarian Infantry Division but the Canadian Corps&#x27; preliminary artillery bombardment leading up to the assault on 9 April caused heavy casualties amongst its ranks. On 11 April, the 4th Guards Infantry Division first reinforced and then relieved affected 16th Bavarian Infantry Division units. The night before the attack, artillery harassed German positions while a gas section of Royal Engineers, employing Livens Projectors, fired more than 40 drums of gas directly into the village of Givenchy-en-Gohelle to cause confusion. The defending German troops managed to drive back the initial Canadian assaults at around 4:00am using small arms fire. The 10th Canadian Brigade attacked once again at 5:00am, this time supported by a significant amount of artillery and the 24th Division of I Corps to the north. The German defensive artillery fire was late and too light to cause the assaulting troops great difficulty, allowing the Canadian Corps to exploit wide gaps and break into the German positions. The 10th Canadian Brigade, assisted by snow and a westerly wind, fought hastily entrained German troops to capture the entire Pimple by 6:00pm.

==Aftermath==

By nightfall on 12 April 1917, the Canadian Corps was in firm control of the ridge, having suffered 10,602 casualties; 3,598 men had been killed and 7,004 wounded. The 6th Army casualties were not known at first in the disorganisation after the defeat. Later sources state around 20,000 casualties, German historians credit the high number of German casualties to Canadian and British artillery. Approximately 4,000 men were taken prisoner. The German Historical Service estimated that the 6th Army suffered 79,418 casualties during April and May 1917, 22,792 were classified as missing. Crown Prince Rupprecht estimated 85,000 casualties for the 6th Army, with 3,404 men taken prisoner at Vimy Ridge. Losses of the 79th Reserve Division from 1 to 11 April were 3,473 and in the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division 3,133. Casualties from the bombardment amongst reinforcements and divisions are additional.

Following the defeat, the chief of the German General Staff, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, ordered (OHL, Supreme Army Command) to conduct a court of enquiry into the defensive collapse of the Arras sector. The court concluded that the 6th Army headquarters had disregarded reports from commanders in the front line noting a possible imminent attack and reserve units were too distant to counter-attack before the Canadians could consolidate. The court concluded that 6th Army commander General Ludwig von Falkenhausen failed to apply an elastic defence according to German defensive doctrine. Instead, the defensive system comprised strong points and lines of resistance, which the Allied artillery had isolated and destroyed. Hindenburg removed Falkenhausen from his command and transferred him to Belgium, where he served the remainder of the war as governor-general.
The Germans did not see the capture of Vimy Ridge by the Canadian Corps as a loss. Contemporary German sources viewed the action, at worst, as a draw, given that no breakthrough occurred following the attack. The Germans did not attempt to recapture the ridge, even during the Spring Offensive, and it remained under British control until the end of the war. The loss of Vimy Ridge forced the Germans to reassess their defensive strategy in the area. Instead of mounting a counterattack, they pursued a scorched earth policy and retreated to the Oppy–Méricourt line. The failure of the French Nivelle Offensive in the week after the Arras Offensive placed pressure on Field Marshal Douglas Haig to keep the Germans occupied in the Arras sector to minimize French losses. The Canadian Corps participated in several of these actions including the Battle of Arleux and the Third Battle of the Scarpe in late April and early May 1917. After the end of the war, Byng was raised to the peerage as Baron Byng of Vimy, of Thorpe-le-Soken in the County of Essex, on 7 October 1919. The next month, he retired from the military.

==Commemoration==

===Influence on Canada===
The Battle of Vimy Ridge has considerable significance for Canada. Although the battle is not generally considered the greatest achievement of the Canadian Corps in strategic importance or results obtained, it was the first instance in which all four Canadian divisions, made up of troops drawn from all parts of the country, fought together. The image of national unity and achievement is what, according to one of many recent patriotic narratives, initially gave the battle importance for Canada. According to Pierce, &quot;The historical reality of the battle has been reworked and reinterpreted in a conscious attempt to give purpose and meaning to an event that came to symbolize Canada&#x27;s coming of age as a nation&quot;. That Canadian national identity and nationhood were born out of the battle is an opinion that in the late twentieth century became widely held in military and general histories of Canada. McKay and Swift contend that the theory that Vimy Ridge is a source of Canada&#x27;s rise as a nation is highly contested and developed in the latter part of the twentieth century after most of those who experienced the Great War had died but in 1919 Hopkins had attributed to F.A. MacKenzie the recognition &quot;...that Dominions sharing the common burden shall share the common direction of the Empire&#x27;s war policy&quot; and related Lloyd George&#x27;s commitment that the Dominions would not again be engaged in wars without consultation.

===Vimy Memorial===
The Canadian National Vimy Memorial is Canada&#x27;s largest overseas war memorial. Located on the highest point of the Vimy Ridge, the memorial commemorates Canadian Expeditionary Force members killed during the First World War and those killed in France during the First World War with no known grave. France granted Canada perpetual use of a section of land at Vimy Ridge in 1922 for a battlefield park and memorial. A portion of the former battlefield is preserved as part of the memorial park that surrounds the monument. The grounds of the site are still honeycombed with wartime tunnels, trenches, craters and unexploded munitions and are largely closed for public safety. A section of preserved trenches and a portion of a tunnel have been made accessible to visitors.

The memorial was designed by Toronto architect and sculptor Walter Seymour Allward, who described it as a &quot;sermon against the futility of war&quot;. The memorial took eleven years and cost $1.5million ($ million in present terms) to build. The unveiling was conducted on 26 July 1936, by King Edward VIII accompanied by President Lebrun of France and a crowd of over 50,000 people, including at least 6,200 Canadian veterans and their families.
The Prime Minister of Canada, Mackenzie King, was absent as he had not fought in the war and was reluctant to meet veterans. Mackenzie King&#x27;s harsh treatment of Byng during the 1926 King-Byng Affair caused many veterans to despise him and he felt that a war veteran from the Cabinet should attend in his place. On the day, four federal government ministers and four Canadian Army General officers attended the unveiling. Edward VIII thanked France, in English and French, for its generosity and assured those assembled that Canada would never forget its war missing and dead. A restoration project began in 2004, which included general cleaning and the recarving of many inscribed names. Queen Elizabeth II rededicated the monument on 9 April 2007, during a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle. Veterans Affairs Canada maintains the memorial site. The commemoration at the memorial on 9 April 2017 for the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge was attended by the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau; the Governor General of Canada, David Johnston; Charles, Prince of Wales; Prince William, Duke of Cambridge; Prince Harry and the President of France, Francois Hollande.

<text>John Fisher (c. 19 October 1469 – 22 June 1535) was an English Catholic bishop, theologian and Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. He is honoured as a martyr and saint by the Catholic Church.

Fisher was executed by order of Henry VIII during the English Reformation for refusing to accept him as the supreme head of the Church of England and for upholding the Catholic Church&#x27;s doctrine of papal supremacy. He was named a cardinal shortly before his death. 

In answer to a popular petition of English Catholics, Pope Pius XI canonized John Fisher and Thomas More on 19 May 1935 as representatives of the many Catholic martyrs of England. The two martyrs share a common feast day on 22 June in the current General Roman Calendar of the Catholic Church. His name also appears in some Anglican calendars of saints.

==Biography==
===Early life===
John Fisher was born at Beverley, Yorkshire in 1469, the son of Robert Fisher, a prosperous mercer of Beverley, and Agnes, his wife, who had produced four children. Robert Fisher died in 1477, buried in St. Mary&#x27;s, the parish church; in his will, he made bequests to his children and various poorhouses, churches, and priests, as well as Mass stipends.

John, who was then 8 years old, subsequently witnessed the second marriage of his widowed mother, to a man named White, to whom she bore four further children.

Fisher&#x27;s early education was probably at the school attached to the collegiate church in his home town. He seems to have had close contacts with his extended family all his life. 

=== University of Cambridge ===
Acknowledging Fisher&#x27;s aptitude for learning, and being financially comfortable, his mother assented to his admission to the University of Cambridge, in 1482, at the age of twelve or thirteen.

The University of Cambridge had regressed and stagnated academically. In an oration delivered before Henry VII in 1506, Fisher recalled:

Fisher studied at the University of Cambridge from 1484, where at Michaelhouse he came under the influence of William Melton, a pastorally-minded theologian open to the new current of reform in studies arising from the Renaissance. Fisher received the Bachelor of Arts degree in 1487. In 1491 he proceeded to a Master of Arts degree and was elected a fellow of his college.

Also in 1491 Fisher received a papal dispensation to be ordained to the priesthood despite being under the canonical age. On 17 December 1491 he was ordained into the priesthood, and appointed (nominal) Vicar of Northallerton, Yorkshire.

In 1494 he resigned this benefice to become proctor of the University and three years later was appointed master debater and about the same time he was also appointed chaplain and confessor to Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby, mother of King Henry VII.

On 5 July 1501, he received the degree of doctor of sacred theology and 10 days later was elected Vice-Chancellor of the university. Under Fisher&#x27;s guidance, his patroness Lady Margaret founded St John&#x27;s and Christ&#x27;s Colleges at Cambridge, and a Lady Margaret Professorship of Divinity at each of the two universities at Oxford and Cambridge. Fisher himself becoming the first occupant of the Cambridge chair. From 1505 to 1508 he was also the President of Queens&#x27; College. At the end of July 1516 he was at Cambridge for the opening of St John&#x27;s College and consecrated the chapel.

Fisher&#x27;s strategy was to assemble funds and attract to Cambridge leading scholars from Europe, promoting the study not only of Classical Latin and Greek authors, but of Hebrew. He placed great weight upon pastoral commitment, above all popular preaching, on the part of the endowed fellows. Fisher had a vision to which he dedicated all his personal resources and energies. Despite occasional opposition, he managed to administer the entire university, one of only two in England, conceiving and seeing through long-term projects.

Fisher&#x27;s foundations were also dedicated to prayer for the dead, especially through chantry foundations. A stern and austere man, Fisher was known to place a human skull on the altar during Mass and on the table during meals.

Erasmus said of John Fisher: &quot;He is the one man at this time who is incomparable for uprightness of life, for learning and for greatness of soul.&quot;

===Bishop===
By papal bull dated 14 October 1504, Fisher was appointed bishop of Rochester, at the personal insistence of Henry VII. Rochester was then the poorest diocese in England and usually seen as a first step on an episcopal career. Nonetheless, Fisher stayed there, presumably by his own choice, for the remaining 31 years of his life.

At the same time, like any English bishop of his day, Fisher had certain state duties. These included in particular, his role regarding the University of Cambridge, in which he maintained a passionate interest. In 1504 he was elected the university&#x27;s chancellor. Re-elected annually for 10 years, Fisher ultimately received a lifetime appointment. At this date he is also said to have acted as tutor to the future king, Henry VIII. As a preacher, his reputation was so great that he was appointed to preach the funeral oration for King Henry VII and the Lady Margaret, both of whom died in 1509, the texts being extant. Besides the part he played in the Lady Margaret&#x27;s foundations, Fisher gave further proof of his zeal for learning by inducing Erasmus to visit Cambridge. The latter attributes it (&quot;Epistulae&quot; 6:2) to Fisher&#x27;s protection that the study of Greek was allowed to proceed at Cambridge without the active molestation that it encountered at Oxford.

Despite his fame and eloquence, it was not long before Fisher came into conflict with the new King, his former pupil. The dispute arose over funds left by the Lady Margaret, the King&#x27;s grandmother, for financing foundations at Cambridge.

In 1512 Fisher was nominated as one of the English representatives at the Fifth Council of the Lateran, then sitting, but his journey to Rome was postponed, and finally abandoned.

===Opposition to Lutheranism===
John Fisher was &quot;the first theologian to diagnose justification through faith alone as the founding dogma of the Protestant Reformation.&quot; 
Fisher has also been named, though without any convincing proof, as the true author of the royal treatise against Martin Luther entitled &quot;Assertio septem sacramentorum&quot; (&quot;Defence of the Seven Sacraments&quot;), published in 1521, which won for King Henry VIII the title &quot;Fidei Defensor&quot; (&quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;). Prior to this date Fisher had denounced various abuses in the Church, urging the need for disciplinary reforms.

In 1523, Fisher published a 200,000 word response to Martin Luther&#x27;s (Assertions): (Confutation of the Lutheran Assertions). Luther omitted some of the more provocative material from his German version, allowing the view that Fisher (and, the next year, Erasmus) had misunderstood Luther. Luther did not respond to Fisher.

On about 11 February 1526, at the King&#x27;s command, he preached a famous sermon against Luther at St Paul&#x27;s Cross, the open-air pulpit outside St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. This was in the wake of numerous other controversial writings; the battle against heterodox teachings increasingly occupied Fisher&#x27;s later years.

In 1529 Fisher was called to confirm with Thomas Hitton, a follower of William Tyndale arrested for suspected heresy, that the records of his interviews and forthright admissions to Archbishop William Warham were correct and to convince Hitton to abjure. Failing this, Hitton was handed to the secular authorities and executed at the stake for heresy. William Tyndale, then living overseas, claimed that Hitton had been tortured by the archbishops, however Protestant historian John Foxe who was diligent in passing on this kind of claim, does not claim this.

===Defence of Catherine of Aragon===
When Henry tried to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Fisher became the Queen&#x27;s chief supporter. As such, he appeared on the Queen&#x27;s behalf in the legates&#x27; court, where he startled the audience by the directness of his language and by declaring that, like St John the Baptist, he was ready to die on behalf of the indissolubility of marriage. Henry VIII, upon hearing this, grew so enraged by it that he composed a long Latin address to the legates in answer to the bishop&#x27;s speech. Fisher&#x27;s copy of this still exists, with his manuscript annotations in the margin which show how little he feared the royal anger. The removal of the cause to Rome brought Fisher&#x27;s personal involvement to an end, but the King never forgave him for what he had done.

===Henry&#x27;s attack on church prerogatives===

In November 1529, the &quot;Long Parliament&quot; of Henry&#x27;s reign began encroaching on the Catholic Church&#x27;s prerogatives. Fisher, as a member of the upper house, the House of Lords, at once warned Parliament that such acts could only end in the utter destruction of the Catholic Church in England. The Commons, through their speaker, complained to the King that Fisher had disparaged Parliament, presumably with Henry prompting them behind the scenes. Henry summoned Fisher before him, demanding an explanation. This being given, Henry declared himself satisfied, leaving it to the Commons to declare that the explanation was inadequate, so that he appeared as a magnanimous sovereign, instead of Fisher&#x27;s enemy.

A year later, in 1530, the continued encroachments on the Church moved Fisher, as bishop of Rochester, along with the bishops of Bath and Ely, to appeal to the Holy See. This gave the King his opportunity and an edict forbidding such appeals was immediately issued, and the three bishops were arrested. Their imprisonment, however, must have lasted only a few months for in February 1531, Convocation met, and Fisher was present. This was the occasion when the clergy were forced, at a cost of 100,000 pounds, to purchase the King&#x27;s pardon for having recognized Cardinal Wolsey&#x27;s authority as legate of the pope; and at the same time to acknowledge Henry as supreme head of the Church in England, to which phrase the addition of the clause &quot;so far as God&#x27;s law permits&quot; was made through Fisher&#x27;s efforts.
====Poisoned porridge and cannonball====

A few days later, several of Fisher&#x27;s household were taken ill after eating some porridge served to the household and two died: however Fisher was fasting that day. Henry VIII had parliament enact a retroactive bill that allowed the cook, Richard Roose, to be executed by the state by boiling alive for attempted poisoning without a public trial.

On another occasion in 1530, a cannonball fired from across the Thames hit Fisher&#x27;s house, narrowly missing his study. This was rumoured to be a warning or assassination attempt from the Boleyn family.

===Intrigues with the Holy Roman Emperor===
Fisher also engaged in secret activities to overthrow Henry. As early as 1531 he began secretly communicating with foreign diplomats. In September 1533 communicating secretly through the imperial ambassador Eustace Chapuys he encouraged Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to invade England and depose Henry in combination with a domestic uprising.

===&quot;The King&#x27;s Great Matter&quot;===
Matters now moved rapidly. In May 1532, Sir Thomas More resigned the chancellorship and, in June, Fisher preached publicly against the annulment. In August, William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, died and Thomas Cranmer was at once proposed by Henry to the Pope as his successor. In January of the next year, Henry secretly went through a form of marriage with Anne Boleyn. Cranmer&#x27;s consecration as a bishop took place in March 1533, and, a week later, Fisher was arrested. It seems that the purpose of this arrest was to prevent him from opposing the annulment which Cranmer pronounced in May, or the coronation of Anne Boleyn which followed on 1 June, for Fisher was set at liberty again within a fortnight of the latter event, no charge being made against him.

In the autumn of 1533, various arrests were made in connection with the so-called revelations of the Holy Maid of Kent, Elizabeth Barton, but as Fisher was taken seriously ill in December, proceedings against him were postponed for a time. However, in March 1534, a special Bill of Attainder against Fisher and others for complicity in the matter of the Maid of Kent was introduced in Parliament and passed. By this, Fisher was condemned to forfeit all his personal estate and to be imprisoned during the King&#x27;s pleasure. Subsequently, a pardon was granted him on payment of a fine of 300 pounds.

===Succession and supremacy===
The same session of Parliament passed the First Succession Act, by which all who should be called upon to do so were compelled to take an oath of succession, acknowledging the issue of Henry and Anne as legitimate heirs to the throne, under pain of being guilty of misprision of treason. Fisher refused the oath and was imprisoned in the Tower of London on 26 April 1534. Several efforts were made to induce him to submit, but without effect, and in November he was attained of misprision of treason a second time, his goods being forfeited as from the previous 1 March, and the See of Rochester being declared vacant as of 2 June following. He was to remain in the Tower for over a year, and while he was allowed food and drink sent by friends, and a servant, he was not allowed a priest, even to the very end. A long letter exists, written from the Tower by Fisher to Thomas Cromwell, speaking of the severity of his conditions of imprisonment.

Like Thomas More, Bishop Fisher believed that, because the statute condemned only those speaking maliciously against the King&#x27;s new title, there was safety in silence. However, on 7 May he fell into a trap laid for him by Richard Rich, who was to perjure himself to obtain Thomas More&#x27;s conviction. Rich told Fisher that for his own conscience&#x27;s sake the King wished to know, in strict secrecy, Fisher&#x27;s real opinion. Fisher, once again, declared that the King was not Supreme Head of the Church of England.

===Cardinalate and martyrdom===
In May 1535, the newly elected Pope Paul III created Fisher Cardinal Priest of &quot;San Vitale&quot;, apparently in the hope of inducing Henry to ease Fisher&#x27;s treatment. The effect was precisely the reverse: Henry forbade the cardinal&#x27;s hat to be brought into England, declaring that he would send the head to Rome instead.

In June a special commission for Fisher&#x27;s trial was issued, and on Thursday, 17 June, he was arraigned in Westminster Hall before a court of seventeen, including Thomas Cromwell, Anne Boleyn&#x27;s father, and ten justices. The charge was treason, in that he denied that the King was the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Since he had been deprived of his position of Bishop of Rochester by the Act of Attainder, he was treated as a commoner, and tried by jury. The only testimony was that of Richard Rich. John Fisher was found guilty and condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn.

However, a public outcry was brewing among the London populace who saw a sinister irony in the parallels between the conviction of Fisher and that of his patronal namesake, Saint John the Baptist, who was executed by King Herod Antipas for challenging the validity of Herod&#x27;s marriage to his brother&#x27;s divorcée Herodias. For fear of John Fisher&#x27;s living through his patronal feast day, that of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist on 24 June, and of attracting too much public sympathy, King Henry commuted the sentence to that of beheading, to be accomplished before 23 June, the Vigil of the feast of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist.

He was executed on Tower Hill on 22 June 1535. The execution had the opposite effect from that which King Henry VIII intended, as it created yet another parallel with that of the martyrdom of St. John the Baptist, who was also beheaded; his death also happened on the feast day of Saint Alban, the first martyr of Britain.

Fisher met death with a calm dignified courage which profoundly impressed those present. His body was treated with particular rancour, apparently on Henry&#x27;s orders, being stripped and left on the scaffold until the evening, when it was taken on pikes and thrown naked into a rough grave in the churchyard of All Hallows&#x27; Barking, also known as All Hallows-by-the-Tower. There was no funeral prayer. A fortnight later, his body was laid beside that of Sir Thomas More in the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula within the Tower of London. Fisher&#x27;s head was stuck upon a pole on London Bridge but its ruddy and lifelike appearance excited so much attention that, after a fortnight, it was thrown into the Thames, its place being taken by that of Sir Thomas More, whose execution, also at Tower Hill, occurred on 6 July.

===Canonisation===

John Fisher was beatified by Pope Leo XIII with Thomas More and 52 other English Martyrs on 29 December 1886. In the Decree of Beatification, the greatest place was given to Fisher.

He was canonised, with Thomas More, on 19 May 1935 by Pope Pius XI, after the presentation of a petition by English Catholics. His feast day, for celebration jointly with St Thomas More, is on 22 June (the date of Fisher&#x27;s execution). In 1980, despite being an opponent of the English Reformation, Fisher was added to the Church of England&#x27;s calendar of Saints and Heroes of the Christian Church, jointly with Thomas More, to be commemorated every 6 July (the date of More&#x27;s execution) as &quot;Thomas More, Scholar, and John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, Reformation Martyrs, 1535&quot;. He is also listed along with Thomas More in the calendar of saints of some of the other Churches of the Anglican Communion, such as The Anglican Church of Australia.

<doc id="70443" wikidata="Q623939" url="?curid=70443" title="Tritone">
<text>In music theory, the tritone is defined as a musical interval spanning three adjacent whole tones (six semitones). For instance, the interval from F up to the B above it (in short, F–B) is a tritone as it can be decomposed into the three adjacent whole tones F–G, G–A, and A–B.

Narrowly defined, each of these whole tones must be a step in the scale, so by this definition, within a diatonic scale there is only one tritone for each octave. For instance, the above-mentioned interval F–B is the only tritone formed from the notes of the C major scale. More broadly, a tritone is also commonly defined as any interval with a width of three whole tones (spanning six semitones in the chromatic scale), regardless of scale degrees. According to this definition, a diatonic scale contains two tritones for each octave. For instance, the above-mentioned C major scale contains the tritones F–B (from F to the B above it, also called augmented fourth) and B–F (from B to the F above it, also called diminished fifth, semidiapente, or semitritonus); the latter is decomposed as a semitone B–C, a whole tone C–D, a whole tone D–E, and a semitone E–F, for a total width of three whole tones, but composed as four steps in the scale. In twelve-equal temperament, the tritone divides the octave exactly in half as 6 of 12 semitones or 600 of 1,200 cents.

In classical music, the tritone is a harmonic and melodic dissonance and is important in the study of musical harmony. The tritone can be used to avoid traditional tonality: &quot;Any tendency for a tonality to emerge may be avoided by introducing a note three whole tones distant from the key note of that tonality.&quot; The tritone found in the dominant seventh chord can also drive the piece of music towards resolution with its tonic. These various uses exhibit the flexibility, ubiquity, and distinctness of the tritone in music.

The condition of having tritones is called tritonia; that of having no tritones is atritonia. A musical scale or chord containing tritones is called tritonic; one without tritones is atritonic.

== Augmented fourth and diminished fifth ==

Since a chromatic scale is formed by 12 pitches (each a semitone apart from its neighbors), it contains 12 distinct tritones, each starting from a different pitch and spanning six semitones. According to a complex but widely used naming convention, six of them are classified as &quot;augmented fourths&quot;, and the other six as &quot;diminished fifths&quot;.

Under that convention, a &quot;fourth&quot; is an interval encompassing four staff positions, while a &quot;fifth&quot; encompasses five staff positions (see interval number for more details).
The augmented fourth (&quot;A4&quot;) and diminished fifth (&quot;d5&quot;) are defined as the intervals produced by widening the perfect fourth and narrowing the perfect fifth by one chromatic semitone.
They both span six semitones, and they are the inverse of each other, meaning that their sum is exactly equal to one perfect octave (A4 + d5 = P8).
In twelve-tone equal temperament, the most commonly used tuning system, the A4 is equivalent to a d5, as both have the size of exactly half an octave. In most other tuning systems, they are not equivalent, and neither is exactly equal to half an octave.

Any augmented fourth can be decomposed into three whole tones. For instance, the interval F–B is an augmented fourth and can be decomposed into the three adjacent whole tones F–G, G–A, and A–B.

It is not possible to decompose a diminished fifth into three adjacent whole tones. The reason is that a whole tone is a major second, and according to the rule of interval addition explained in Interval (music), the composition of three seconds is always a fourth (for instance, an A4). To obtain a fifth (for instance, a d5), it is necessary to add another second. For instance, using the notes of the C major scale, the diminished fifth B–F can be decomposed into the four adjacent intervals
: B–C (minor second), C–D (major second), D–E (major second), and E–F (minor second).
Using the notes of a chromatic scale, B–F may be also decomposed into the four adjacent intervals
: B–C (major second), C–D (major second), D–E (major second), and E–F (diminished second).
Notice that the last diminished second is formed by two enharmonically equivalent notes (E and F). On a piano keyboard, these notes are produced by the same key. However, in the above-mentioned naming convention, they are considered different notes, as they are written on different staff positions and have different diatonic functions within music theory.

== Definitions ==
A tritone (abbreviation: &quot;TT&quot;) is traditionally defined as a musical interval composed of three whole tones. As the symbol for whole tone is &quot;T&quot;, this definition may also be written as follows:

: &quot;TT = T+T+T&quot;

Only if the three tones are of the same size (which is not the case for many tuning systems) can this formula be simplified to:

: &quot;TT = 3T&quot;

This definition, however, has two different interpretations (broad and strict).

=== Broad interpretation (chromatic scale) ===
In a chromatic scale, the interval between any note and the previous or next is a semitone. Using the notes of a chromatic scale, each tone can be divided into two semitones:
: &quot;T = S+S&quot;

For instance, the tone from C to D (in short, C–D) can be decomposed into the two semitones C–C and C–D by using the note C, which in a chromatic scale lies between C and D. This means that, when a chromatic scale is used, a tritone can be also defined as any musical interval spanning six semitones:

: &quot;TT = T+T+T = S+S+S+S+S+S&quot;.

According to this definition, with the twelve notes of a chromatic scale it is possible to define twelve different tritones, each starting from a different note and ending six notes above it. Although all of them span six semitones, six of them are classified as &quot;augmented fourth&quot;s, and the other six as &quot;diminished fifths&quot;.

=== Strict interpretation (diatonic scale) ===
Within a diatonic scale, whole tones are always formed by adjacent notes (such as C and D) and therefore they are regarded as incomposite intervals. In other words, they cannot be divided into smaller intervals. Consequently, in this context the above-mentioned &quot;decomposition&quot; of the tritone into six semitones is typically not allowed.

If a diatonic scale is used, with its 7 notes it is possible to form only one sequence of three adjacent whole tones (&quot;T+T+T&quot;). This interval is an A4. For instance, in the C major diatonic scale (C–D–E–F–G–A–B–...), the only tritone is from F to B. It is a tritone because F–G, G–A, and A–B are three adjacent whole tones. It is a &quot;fourth&quot; because the notes from F to B are four (F, G, A, B). It is &quot;augmented&quot; (i.e., widened) because it is wider than most of the fourths found in the scale (they are perfect fourths).

According to this interpretation, the d5 is not a tritone. Indeed, in a diatonic scale, there is only one d5, and this interval does not meet the strict definition of tritone, as it is formed by one semitone, two whole tones, and another semitone:

: &quot;d5 = S+T+T+S&quot;.

For instance, in the C major diatonic scale, the only d5 is from B to F. It is a &quot;fifth&quot; because the notes from B to F are five (B, C, D, E, F). It is &quot;diminished&quot; (i.e. narrowed) because it is smaller than most of the fifths found in the scale (they are perfect fifths).

== Size in different tuning systems ==

In twelve-tone equal temperament, the Aug 4 is exactly half an octave (i.e., a ratio of :1 or 600 cents. The inverse of 600 cents is 600 cents. Thus, in this tuning system, the Aug 4 and its inverse (dim 5) are equivalent.

The half-octave or equal tempered Aug 4 and dim 5 are unique in being equal to their own inverse (each to the other). In other meantone tuning systems, besides 12 tone equal temperament, Aug 4 and dim 5 are distinct intervals because neither is exactly half an octave. In any meantone tuning near to -comma meantone the Aug 4 is near to the ratio 7:5 (582.51) and the dim 5 to 10:7 (617.49), which is what these intervals are in septimal meantone temperament. In 31 equal temperament, for example, the Aug 4 is 580.65 cents, whereas the dim 5 is 619.35 cents. This is perceptually indistinguishable from septimal meantone temperament.

Since they are the inverse of each other, by definition Aug 4 and dim 5 always add up (in cents) to exactly one perfect octave:
: &quot;Aug 4 + dim 5 = Perf 8&quot;.
On the other hand, two Aug 4 add up to six whole tones. In equal temperament, this is equal to exactly one perfect octave:
: &quot;Aug 4 + Aug 4 = Perf 8&quot;.
In quarter-comma meantone temperament, this is a diesis (128:125) less than a perfect octave:
: &quot;Aug 4 + Aug 4 = Perf 8 − diesis&quot;.
In just intonation several different sizes can be chosen both for the Aug 4 and the dim 5. For instance, in 5-limit tuning, the Aug 4 is either 45:32 or 25:18, and the dim 5 is either 64:45 or 36:25. The 64:45 just diminished fifth arises in the C major scale between B and F, consequently the 45:32 augmented fourth arises between F and B.

These ratios are not in all contexts regarded as strictly just but they are the justest possible in 5-limit tuning. 7-limit tuning allows for the justest possible ratios (ratios with the smallest numerator and denominator), namely 7:5 for the Aug 4 (about 582.5 cents, also known as septimal tritone) and 10:7 for the dim 5 (about 617.5 cents, also known as Euler&#x27;s tritone).
These ratios are more consonant than 17:12 (about 603.0 cents) and 24:17 (about 597.0 cents), which can be obtained in 17 limit tuning, yet the latter are also fairly common, as they are closer to the equal-tempered value of 600 cents.

== Eleventh harmonic ==

The ratio of the eleventh harmonic, 11:8 (551.318 cents; approximated as F4 above C1), known as the lesser undecimal tritone or undecimal semi-augmented fourth, is found in some just tunings and on many instruments. For example, very long alphorns may reach the twelfth harmonic and transcriptions of their music usually show the eleventh harmonic sharp (F above C, for example), as in Brahms&#x27;s First Symphony. This note is often corrected to 4:3 on the natural horn in just intonation or Pythagorean tunings, but the pure eleventh harmonic was used in pieces including Britten&#x27;s &quot;Serenade for tenor, horn and strings&quot;. Ivan Wyschnegradsky considered the major fourth a good approximation of the eleventh harmonic.

== Common uses ==
=== Occurrences in diatonic scales ===
The augmented fourth (A4) occurs naturally between the fourth and seventh scale degrees of the major scale (for example, from F to B in the key of C major). It is also present in the natural minor scale as the interval formed between the second and sixth scale degrees (for example, from D to A in the key of C minor). The melodic minor scale, having two forms, presents a tritone in different locations when ascending and descending (when the scale ascends, the tritone appears between the third and sixth scale degrees and the fourth and seventh scale degrees, and when the scale descends, the tritone appears between the second and sixth scale degrees). Supertonic chords using the notes from the natural minor mode thus contain a tritone, regardless of inversion. Containing tritones, these scales are tritonic.

=== Occurrences in chords ===

The dominant seventh chord in root position contains a diminished fifth (tritone) within its pitch construction: it occurs between the third and seventh above the root. In addition, augmented sixth chords, some of which are enharmonic to dominant seventh chords, contain tritones spelled as augmented fourths (for example, the German sixth, from A to D in the key of A minor); the French sixth chord can be viewed as a superposition of two tritones a major second apart.

The diminished triad also contains a tritone in its construction, deriving its name from the diminished-fifth interval (i.e. a tritone). The half-diminished seventh chord contains the same tritone, while the fully diminished seventh chord is made up of two superposed tritones a minor third apart.

Other chords built on these, such as ninth chords, often include tritones (as diminished fifths).

=== Resolution ===

In all of the sonorities mentioned above, used in functional harmonic analysis, the tritone pushes towards resolution, generally resolving by step in contrary motion. This determines the resolution of chords containing tritones.

The augmented fourth resolves outward to a minor or major sixth (the first measure below). The inversion of this, a diminished fifth, resolves inward to a major or minor third (the second measure below). The diminished fifth is often called a tritone in modern tonal theory, but functionally and notationally it can only resolve inwards as a diminished fifth and is therefore not reckoned a tritone—that is, an interval composed of three adjacent whole tones—in mid-renaissance (early 16th-century) music theory.

=== Other uses ===
The tritone is also one of the defining features of the Locrian mode, being featured between the and fifth scale degrees.

The half-octave tritone interval is used in the musical/auditory illusion known as the tritone paradox.

== Historical uses ==
The tritone is a restless interval, classed as a dissonance in Western music from the early Middle Ages through to the end of the common practice period. This interval was frequently avoided in medieval ecclesiastical singing because of its dissonant quality. The first explicit prohibition of it seems to occur with the development of Guido of Arezzo&#x27;s hexachordal system, who suggested that rather than make B a diatonic note, the hexachord be moved and based on C to avoid the F–B tritone altogether. Later theorists such as Ugolino d&#x27;Orvieto and Tinctoris advocated the inclusion of B.

From then until the end of the Renaissance the tritone was regarded as an unstable interval and rejected as a consonance by most theorists.

The name has been applied to the interval from at least the early 18th century, or the late Middle Ages, though its use is not restricted to the tritone, being that the original found example of the term is (Mi against Fa is the devil in music). Andreas Werckmeister cites this term in 1702 as being used by &quot;the old authorities&quot; for both the tritone and for the clash between chromatically related tones such as F and F, and five years later likewise calls the opposition of &quot;square&quot; and &quot;round&quot; B (B and B, respectively) because these notes represent the juxtaposition of . Johann Joseph Fux cites the phrase in his seminal 1725 work , Georg Philipp Telemann in 1733 describes, &quot;mi against fa&quot;, which the ancients called &quot;Satan in music&quot;—and Johann Mattheson, in 1739, writes that the &quot;older singers with solmization called this pleasant interval or &#x27;the devil in music&#x27;.&quot; Although the latter two of these authors cite the association with the devil as from the past, there are no known citations of this term from the Middle Ages, as is commonly asserted. However Denis Arnold, in the &quot;New Oxford Companion to Music&quot;, suggests that the nickname was already applied early in the medieval music itself:

That original symbolic association with the devil and its avoidance led to Western cultural convention seeing the tritone as suggesting &quot;evil&quot; in music. However, stories that singers were excommunicated or otherwise punished by the Church for invoking this interval are likely fanciful. At any rate, avoidance of the interval for musical reasons has a long history, stretching back to the parallel organum of the . In all these expressions, including the commonly cited , the &quot;mi&quot; and &quot;fa&quot; refer to notes from two adjacent hexachords. For instance, in the tritone B–F, B would be &quot;mi&quot;, that is the third scale degree in the &quot;hard&quot; hexachord beginning on G, while F would be &quot;fa&quot;, that is the fourth scale degree in the &quot;natural&quot; hexachord beginning on C.

Later, with the rise of the Baroque and Classical music era, composers accepted the tritone, but used it in a specific, controlled way—notably through the principle of the tension-release mechanism of the tonal system. In that system (which is the fundamental musical grammar of Baroque and Classical music), the tritone is one of the defining intervals of the dominant-seventh chord and two tritones separated by a minor third give the fully diminished seventh chord its characteristic sound. In minor, the diminished triad (comprising two minor thirds, which together add up to a tritone) appears on the second scale degree—and thus features prominently in the progression iio–V–i. Often, the inversion iio6 is used to move the tritone to the inner voices as this allows for stepwise motion in the bass to the dominant root. In three-part counterpoint, free use of the diminished triad in first inversion is permitted, as this eliminates the tritone relation to the bass.

It is only with the Romantic music and modern classical music that composers started to use it totally freely, without functional limitations notably in an expressive way to exploit the &quot;evil&quot; connotations culturally associated with it, such as Franz Liszt&#x27;s use of the tritone to suggest Hell in his &quot;Dante Sonata&quot;:



—or Wagner&#x27;s use of timpani tuned to C and F to convey a brooding atmosphere at the start of the second act of the opera &quot;Siegfried&quot;.

In his early cantata , Debussy uses a tritone to convey the words of the poem by Dante Gabriel Rossetti.

Roger Nichols (1972, p19) says that &quot;the bare fourths, the wide spacing, the tremolos, all depict the words—&#x27;the light thrilled towards her&#x27;—with sudden, overwhelming power.&quot; Debussy&#x27;s String Quartet also features passages that emphasize the tritone.

The tritone was also exploited heavily in that period as an interval of modulation for its ability to evoke a strong reaction by moving quickly to distantly related keys. For example, the climax of Hector Berlioz&#x27;s (1846) consists of a transition between &quot;huge B and F chords&quot; as Faust arrives in Pandaemonium, the capital of Hell. Musicologist Julian Rushton calls this &quot;a tonal wrench by a tritone&quot;.

Later, in twelve-tone music, serialism, and other 20th century compositional idioms, composers considered it a neutral interval. In some analyses of the works of 20th century composers, the tritone plays an important structural role; perhaps the most cited is the axis system, proposed by Ernő Lendvai, in his analysis of the use of tonality in the music of Béla Bartók. Tritone relations are also important in the music of George Crumb and Benjamin Britten, whose &quot;War Requiem&quot; features a tritone between C and F♯ as a recurring motif. John Bridcut (2010, p. 271) describes the power of the interval in creating the sombre and ambiguous opening of the &quot;War Requiem&quot;: &quot;The idea that the chorus and orchestra are confident in their wrong-headed piety is repeatedly disputed by the music. From the instability of the opening tritone—that unsettling interval between C and F sharp—accompanied by the tolling of warning bells ... eventually resolves into a major chord for the arrival of the boys singing &#x27;Te decet hymnus&#x27;.&quot; Leonard Bernstein uses the tritone harmony as a basis for much of &quot;West Side Story&quot;. George Harrison uses tritones on the downbeats of the opening phrases of the Beatles songs &quot;The Inner Light&quot;, &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot;, and &quot;Within You Without You&quot;, creating a prolonged sense of suspended resolution. Perhaps the most striking use of the interval in rock music of the late 1960s can be found in Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s song &quot;Purple Haze&quot;. According to Dave Moskowitz (2010, p. 12), Hendrix &quot;ripped into &#x27;Purple Haze&#x27; by beginning the song with the sinister sounding tritone interval creating an opening dissonance, long described as &#x27;The Devil in Music&#x27;.&quot; The opening riff of &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, the first song on Black Sabbath&#x27;s eponymous debut album, is an inversion of a tritone; the album, and this song in particular, are considered to mark the birth of heavy metal music.

Tritones also became important in the development of jazz tertian harmony, where triads and seventh chords are often expanded to become 9th, 11th, or 13th chords, and the tritone often occurs as a substitute for the naturally occurring interval of the perfect 11th. Since the perfect 11th (i.e. an octave plus perfect fourth) is typically perceived as a dissonance requiring a resolution to a major or minor 10th, chords that expand to the 11th or beyond typically raise the 11th a semitone (thus giving us an augmented or sharp 11th, or an octave plus a tritone from the root of the chord) and present it in conjunction with the perfect 5th of the chord. Also in jazz harmony, the tritone is both part of the dominant chord and its substitute dominant (also known as the sub V chord). Because they share the same tritone, they are possible substitutes for one another. This is known as a tritone substitution. The tritone substitution is one of the most common chord and improvisation devices in jazz.

<text>Mary Tudor ( ; 18 March 1496 – 25 June 1533) was an English princess who was briefly Queen of France as the third wife of King Louis XII. Louis was more than 30 years her senior. Mary was the fifth child of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York, and the youngest to survive infancy.

Following Louis&#x27;s death, Mary married Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. Performed secretly in France, the marriage occurred without the consent of Mary&#x27;s brother Henry VIII. The marriage necessitated the intervention of Thomas Wolsey; Henry eventually pardoned the couple after they paid a large fine. Mary had four children with Suffolk. Through her older daughter, Frances, she was the maternal grandmother of Lady Jane Grey, the disputed queen of England for nine days in July 1553.

==Early life==
Mary was the fifth child of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York, and the youngest of those who survived infancy. She was born at Sheen Palace, on 18 March 1496. A privy seal bill dated from midsummer 1496 authorises a payment of 50 shillings to her nurse, Anne Skeron. Also, Erasmus stated that she was four years old when he visited the royal nursery in 1499–1500. At age six, she was given her own household, complete with &quot;a staff of gentlewomen assigned to wait upon her&quot;, a schoolmaster, and a physician. She was given instruction in French, Latin, music, dancing, and embroidery. Her Governess was Joan Vaux, who she called Mother Guildford; the two shared a close relationship and Mary was furious when Joan was sent back to England upon her arrival in France.

As children, Mary and her brother, the future King Henry VIII, shared a close friendship. He named his first surviving child, the future Queen Mary I, in her honour. They lost their mother when Mary was just six and, given the number of bills paid to her apothecary from 1504 to 1509, it would appear that Mary&#x27;s own health was fragile.

She was known in her youth as one of the most beautiful princesses in Europe; Erasmus said of her that &quot;Nature never formed anything more beautiful.&quot;

In 1506, during a visit from Philip I of Castile, Mary was called to entertain the guests, dancing and playing the lute and clavichord. In September 1506, Philip died, and on 21 December 1507, Mary was betrothed to his son Charles, later Holy Roman Emperor. The betrothal was called off in 1514.

==First marriage: Queen of France==
Cardinal Wolsey negotiated a peace treaty with France, and on 9 October 1514, at the age of 18, Mary married the 52-year-old King Louis XII of France at Abbeville. She was accompanied to France by several English maids of honour (one of whom was Anne Boleyn) under the supervision of her old governess Lady or &quot;Mother&quot; Guildford, who acted as her principal lady-in-waiting.

Despite two previous marriages, Louis had no living sons, and sought to produce one. But he died on 1 January 1515, less than three months after marrying Mary, reputedly worn out by his exertions in the bedchamber, but more likely from the effects of gout. Their union produced no children. Following Louis&#x27;s death, his successor, King Francis I of France, made unsuccessful attempts to arrange a second marriage for Mary.

==Second marriage: Duchess of Suffolk==
Mary had been unhappy in her marriage of state to King Louis XII, as she was almost certainly already in love with Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. King Henry VIII was aware of Mary&#x27;s feelings; letters from her in 1515 indicated that she had agreed to wed Louis only on condition that &quot;if she survived him, she should marry whom she liked&quot;. However, Henry VIII wanted any future marriage to be to his advantage. The King&#x27;s Council, not wishing to see Charles Brandon gain further power at court, was also opposed to the match.

Meanwhile, rumours swirled in France that she would wed either Antoine, Duke of Lorraine, or Charles III, Duke of Savoy. On 26 June 1515, the Duke of Lorraine married Renée of Bourbon instead. At one point, even King Francis I, perhaps in hope of his wife Queen Claude&#x27;s death, was one of Mary&#x27;s suitors in the first week of her widowhood; Mary asserted that she had given him her confidence in order to avoid his overtures. A pair of French friars went so far as to warn Mary that she must not wed Charles Brandon, because he &quot;had traffickings with the devil&quot;.

When King Henry VIII sent Brandon to bring Mary back to England in late January 1515, he made the Duke promise that he would not propose to her. Once in France, Mary persuaded Charles to abandon that pledge; Charles later wrote to the King stating he &quot;never saw a woman so weep&quot;. The couple married in secret at the Hotel de Cluny in Paris on 3 March 1515 in the presence of just 10 people, among them King Francis I. Technically, this was treason, as Brandon had married a royal princess without King Henry&#x27;s consent. Henry was outraged, and the privy council urged that Charles be imprisoned or executed; Mary, as royalty and the King&#x27;s favourite sister, was safe from execution.

Due to the intervention of Thomas Wolsey and Henry&#x27;s affection for both his sister and Charles, the couple were given only a heavy fine of £24,000, to be paid to the King in yearly instalments of £1000; the whole of Mary&#x27;s dower from King Louis XII of £200,000; and the gold plate and jewels King Louis had given or promised her. The £24,000 was later reduced by the King. They officially later married on 13 May 1515 at Greenwich Palace in the presence of King Henry VIII and his courtiers. In 1528, Charles secured a papal bull from Pope Clement VII legitimising the marriage.Mary was Charles Brandon&#x27;s third wife, and he had two daughters, Anne and Mary, by his second wife Anne Browne, who had died in 1510 or 1512. Mary raised the girls with her own children. Even after her second marriage, Mary was normally referred to at the English court as the Queen of France, and was not known as the Duchess of Suffolk in her lifetime, despite being legally allowed to be. Mary spent most of her time at the Duke&#x27;s country seat of Westhorpe Hall in Suffolk.

In the late 1520s, relations between King Henry VIII and his sister Mary were strained when she opposed the King&#x27;s attempt to obtain an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, whom Mary had known for many years. Mary strongly disliked Anne Boleyn (King Henry&#x27;s intended wife), whom she had first encountered in France. Anne and her sister Mary Boleyn had been among the maids of honour in the entourage that had accompanied Mary to France for her wedding to King Louis XII.

In March 1532, Venetian Ambassador Carlo Capello wrote of an incident where Though it was said to be caused by a private quarrel, he was &quot;assured it was owing to opprobrious language uttered against Madam Anne by his Majesty&#x27;s sister, the Duchess of Suffolk, Queen Dowager of France.&quot; Anne Boleyn was the niece of the Duke of Norfolk mentioned by Capello.

==Death==

Mary had multiple bouts of illness, requiring treatments over her lifetime. She died, age 37, at Westhorpe Hall, Suffolk, on 25 June 1533, having never fully recovered from the sweating sickness she caught in 1528. The cause of death has been speculated to have been tuberculosis, appendicitis, or cancer.

As an English princess, daughter of a king, sister to the current king, and a dowager queen of France, Mary Tudor&#x27;s funeral and interment was conducted with much heraldic ceremony. A requiem mass was held at Westminster Abbey. Her body was embalmed and held in state at Westhorpe Hall for three weeks. On 21 July 1533, a delegation from France joined the English delegation for the lavish funeral ceremony. Her daughter Frances was chief mourner, accompanied by her husband and siblings. As was tradition, neither Mary&#x27;s husband nor her brother the king attended. The funeral procession included 100 torch bearers, clergy carrying the cross, six horses pulling the hearse, other nobility and 100 of the duke&#x27;s yeomen. A requiem mass and burial at Bury St. Edmunds Abbey followed the next day. At the funeral, her step-daughters, Anne and Mary, pushed themselves to the head of the cortège just before the coffin was lowered into the crypt of the Abbey, much to the consternation of their half-siblings.

Five years later, when the monastery was dissolved, Mary&#x27;s body was removed to nearby St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Bury St. Edmunds. In 1784, her remains were disinterred, her coffin opened, and locks of her hair were taken by Horace Walpole, Dorothy Bentinck, Duchess of Portland, and several others.

== Appearance and personality ==
Upon her arrival in France, Mary was described as being &quot;handsome and well favoured, were not her eyes and eyebrows too light; she is slight, rather than defective from corpulence, and conducts herself with so much grace, and has such good manners, that for her age of 18 years—and she does not look more—she is a paradise.&quot;

Contemporaries lauded her beauty, including her husband, Louis XII, who described her as a &quot;nymph from heaven&quot;. She regularly took part in masques at her brother&#x27;s court, and enjoyed &quot;hearing singing, instrumental music, and dancing&quot;.

Mary was described as &quot;very lively&quot;, with one nobleman noting &quot;[she] is never still.&quot; She was also said to be cheerful and affable; this is shown when, upon meeting her future husband Louis for the first time, she blew him a kiss in greeting.

== Issue ==
Mary and Charles had four children, two daughters and two sons:

* Henry Brandon (11 March 1516 – 1522)
* Lady Frances Brandon (16 July 1517 – 20 November 1559), who married Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk before he succeeded to the dukedom, he being 3rd Marquess of Dorset at the time of the marriage. They were the parents of Lady Jane Grey.
* Lady Eleanor Brandon (1519 – 27 September 1547), who married Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland.
* Henry Brandon, 1st Earl of Lincoln ( – March 1534).

Mary and Charles raised their children at their home at Westhorpe Hall. Their two sons, both named Henry, are commonly mistaken for being the same son. Both boys died when they were children.

Mary&#x27;s widower later married their son&#x27;s (Henry Brandon, Earl of Lincoln) betrothed, who was also his ward, the 14-year-old Catherine Willoughby, by whom he had his two youngest sons.

== In literature ==
She is the main character in several historical fiction novels:

* &quot;When Knighthood Was in Flower&quot;, by Edwin Caskoden (the pen name of Charles Major) (1898), the novel was the source material for both the Davies film directed by Robert Vignola and the Disney film, &quot;The Sword and the Rose&quot;.
* &quot;The Reluctant Queen&quot; by Molly Costain Haycraft (1962)
* &quot;Mary, Queen of France&quot; by Jean Plaidy (1964)
* &quot;Princess of Desire&quot; by Maureen Peters (1970)
* &quot;Rose of England&quot; by Hilda Lewis (1977)
* &quot;Heart of a Rose&quot; by Hilda Lewis (1978)
* &quot;The Secret Bride&quot; by Diane Haeger (2008)
* &quot;The Last Boleyn&quot; by Karen Harper
* &quot;Three Sisters, Three Queens&quot; by Philippa Gregory (2016)

== In other media ==
* In the 2007 television series &quot;The Tudors,&quot; Mary and Margaret Tudor were amalgamated into one character named Margaret. While the character&#x27;s story is more similar to Mary&#x27;s, she was given the name Margaret to avoid confusion with her namesake niece Mary I of England. Margaret was played by Gabrielle Anwar. She is depicted as marrying the King of Portugal rather than France (as Francis I had already been introduced in the show as King of France, Mary/Margaret could not be shown marrying his predecessor, Louis XII). The fictional Portuguese king lives only a few days until she smothers him in his sleep. She then marries Charles Brandon.
*In &quot;The Spanish Princess&quot; (television mini series, 2019–2020), Mary Tudor is a main character. Isla Merrick-Lawless portrays a younger version in Season 1 and Sai Bennett portrays an older version in Season 2.
* In &quot;The Sword and the Rose&quot; (Walt Disney and Perce Pearce film, 1953), Mary Tudor (played by Glynis Johns) falls for the non-noble Brandon (played by Richard Todd) and attempts to run away from England with him, but is forced by Henry VIII to marry the King of France. She relies on her friend, the Duke of Buckingham, to help her, with nearly disastrous consequences.

== Portraiture and other depictions ==
Mary&#x27;s portraits and other depictions are mostly subject of heated debate as to if it is really her or somebody else, who draw or painted her or whether the painting is misdated.
Confirmed depictions of her include:
*Illumination called Henry VII in mourning, c.1503–1504 which also depicts the three surviving children of Elizabeth of York on left side.
*Painting called The Family of Henry VII with St George and the Dragon, Royal Collection, c. 1503–1509 -shows Mary as second girl on right, with strawberry blonde hair.
*Illumination of The family of Henry VII with Joachim and Anne meeting at the Golden Gate, done after 1503 -depicts Elizabeth of York with four daughters behind her, all depicted with strawberry blonde hair.
*Illuminations of Mary as Queen of France-show her with light red hair.
*So-called marriage portrait depicts Mary holding hands with her second husband Charles Brandon 
**While the identities of the sitters are not questioned, the dating of c.1515 is not accepted unanimously, and later dates have been suggested. Allegedly the version from the collection of the Earl of Yarborough is the original, whilst the Woburn Abbey version is a copy. Both versions shows Mary with brown hair, probably due to darkening of pigments.
**An engraving from 1784 is based upon the same portrait (Royal Collection; National Trust Collection).

Alleged portraits of Mary meant for Charles V include:
*Portrait of woman by Michael Sittow, traditionally labelled as Catherine of Aragon 
**Mary has been suggested instead, however while initials(K, C or E) would fit her, the author of this reidentification says that Catherine of Aragon had no reason to wear the symbol of scallops(which line the bodice) as they were not her emblem; the pomegranate was. Scallops are a symbol of St. James the Great, patron saint of Spain. Notably, pilgrimage to his shrine in Santiago de Compostela was commemorated by wearing scallops, and it is known Catherine of Aragon made this pilgrimage. The credibility of this reidentification is therefore questionable.
*The Magdalen, National Gallery, London
**The painting shows a woman in Spanish clothes wearing jewels of the Crown of Castile, including the emerald necklace depicted on tomb of Joanna of Castile. Mary has been suggested as a possible sitter.
Many believe it is the lost painting of Queen Isabella I of Castile by Sittow, but it is not attributed to him.
*Portrait de Marie d&#x27;Angleterre in Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris 
**Possibly depicts same woman as in The Magdalene, in different dress, but with Spanish headwear called cofia de tranzado.
Note: on Wikipedia this painting is labelled as by Jean Perréal, location unknown. However, on the museum&#x27;s webpage it is not labelled as by him but by anonymous Maître de la Reine Marie Tudor(Master of Queen Mary Tudor).

Lost depictions:
*Portrait for Louis XII by Jean Perréal 
*An original portrait upon which the drawing entitled Maria Regina Fra. et D. Suffoltiae in British Museum is based.
*Drawing of Mary while in France, by either Anonymous French Master or Jean Clouet(father of Francois Clouet). 
**Nobody knows which(if any) of its multiple versions is the original drawing done from life. There are at least five versions:
2 in Ashmolean Museum, one labelled as by follower of Jean Clouet, and the other by anonymous. 
1 in Uffizi Gallery -labelled as Ritratto di donna(portrait of woman) 3911 F, it is a very crude sketch by Francois Clouet, who was a child when Mary was in France.
2 more versions from Bibliothèque Municipale Méjanes, Aix en Provence. Both bear a 16th-century text(thus most likely to be original). However the picture on Wikipedia of one of them is described as not the real drawing but a print of it.

Other suggested depictions:
*Westminster Tournament roll 1511-figure next to Catherine of Aragon in gold-red dress

<text>The Völsunga saga (often referred to in English as the Volsunga Saga or Saga of the Völsungs) is a legendary saga, a late 13th-century prose rendition in Old Norse of the origin and decline of the Völsung clan (including the story of Sigurd and Brunhild and the destruction of the Burgundians). It is one of the most famous legendary sagas and an example of a &quot;heroic saga&quot; that deals with Germanic heroic legend.

The saga covers topics including the quarrel between Sigi and Skaði, a huge family tree of great kings and powerful conquerors, the quest led by Sigmund and Sinfjǫtli to save princess Signý from the evil king Siggeir, and, most famously, Sigurd killing the serpent/dragon Fáfnir and obtaining the cursed ring Andvaranaut that Fáfnir guarded.

== Context and overview ==
The saga is largely based on the epic poetry of the historic &quot;Elder Edda&quot;. The earliest known pictorial representation of this tradition is the Ramsund carving in Sweden, which was created .

The origins of the material are considerably older, however, and it in part echoes real events in Central Europe during the Migration Period, chiefly the destruction of the Kingdom of the Burgundians by the Huns in the fifth century. Some of the poems contained in the &quot;Elder Edda&quot; relate episodes from the Völsung legend. On the other hand, the only surviving medieval manuscript of the saga, Ny kgl. Saml. 1824 b 4to, which is held by the Royal Library of Denmark, dates to about 1400. In this manuscript, the saga leads straight in to &quot;Ragnars saga loðbrókar&quot;.

===Characters===
== Contents ==
The saga can be divided into five phases: the preliminary generations, Sigurd and his foster family, Sigurd and the Gjukingar, Gudrun and the Budlingar, and Gudrun&#x27;s last marriage.

===Volsung&#x27;s ancestors===

The &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; begins with Sigi, the ancestor of the Völsung lineage, and Skaði. Sigi was more important since he was richer and more powerful and was said to be a son of Odin. In the saga, Skaði owns a thrall named Breði whom Sigi takes on a hunting trip all day and evening. When they compare their skills, Breði&#x27;s outshine Sigi&#x27;s. Enraged, Sigi murders Breði and hides his body in a snowdrift. When Sigi returns, he lies to Skaði that Breði rode away into the forest. But Skaði, suspecting something amiss, goes off with his men in search of Breði and discovers his body in the snowdrift. Skaði declares the drift &quot;Breði&#x27;s drift&quot;, and soon every large drift comes to be called &quot;Breði&#x27;s drift&quot; in his honor. Skaði casts Sigi out, leaving him &quot;a wolf in hallowed places&quot;.

After much adventuring, Odin leads Sigi to a land where some longships lay. He and his troops (that his unnamed father gave him) take up raiding. Sigi becomes a successful raider and warlord before seizing a kingdom called Hunaland to rule. His wife&#x27;s brothers eventually become envious of Sigi&#x27;s power and wealth and raise an army against him. In the following battle, Sigi is killed and his enemies take over the kingdom. Later, Sigi&#x27;s son Rerir avenges his father&#x27;s death, killing his uncles and taking his father&#x27;s throne. However, he and his wife have no heir, so they turn to Odin and Frigg to pray for one. In response, Odin and Frigg send one of their wish maidens to take the form of a crow and place a magical apple on Rerir&#x27;s lap. When Rerir shares it with the queen, she conceives and endures an extraordinarily long pregnancy. While awaiting the birth of his heir, Rerir goes on a campaign to pacify the land, but he catches sick and dies before returning. Since the queen knows that she has not long left before the pregnancy kills her, she orders her baby to be cut from her. She dies in the process, but the male child survives and is named Völsung.

=== The life of king Völsung ===

Völsung marries Hljod, the daughter of a jötunn and the maiden who gave the queen the golden apple. Völsung and Hljod have ten sons and one daughter, the two eldest and strongest being the boy and girl twins Sigmund and Signý. King Völsung has a grand palace built for him, with the great hall built around a massive tree known as Barnstokkr () to stand proudly over Völsung&#x27;s guests. One day, Siggeir, the king of Gautland, comes to visit Völsung and ask for Signý&#x27;s hand in marriage. Völsung is pleased at the idea of Signý marrying Siggeir, but Signý despises him. King Völsung arranges the marriage anyway. On the wedding day, as everyone is celebrating, a hooded man with one eye comes into the hall, draws a sword, and thrusts it into Barnstokkr. The mysterious figure says that whoever can pull the sword from Barnstokkr will receive it as a gift, then abruptly leaves. Although the saga does not explicitly say who the man is, his hood and missing eye suggest he is Odin. Indeed, later in the saga it is made clear that such a man could be no one but the All-father, as the figure returns to set more formidable challenges, and the sword later demonstrates its divine powers. Many people attempt to draw the sword from the tree, but no one can make it budge until Sigmund Völsungson comes and pulls the sword out with ease. King Siggeir offers to buy the sword, but Sigmund refuses. That night Siggeir and Signý sleep together, and by the next day she is pressuring King Völsung to allow them to divorce. Although his daughter is in distress, he reluctantly refuses, so as to maintain their alliance with Gautland.

But when Signý travels to Gautland, she finds out that Siggeir is plotting to overthrow Völsung and add Hunaland to his empire. Signý returns to Hunaland to gather Völsung, Sigmund, and their most powerful men, telling them that they must raise an army and invade Gautland if they do not want Hunaland to fall. Völsung agrees to the invasion, sending his army to the shore of Gautland to overthrow and kill Siggeir. After a long, grim, and intense battle, the Völsungs are forced to concede defeat after the deaths of the king and one of his sons.

===The war against Siggeir===

Signý goes to speak with King Siggeir as his wife, begging him to tie her brothers up instead of killing them. Siggeir agrees, thinking a slower death more suitable for them, so the brothers are tied up by their feet and hands and thrown into the woods to die. Signý, hoping for this outcome, sends one of her most trusted men to find her brothers. When he finds them, they tell him that one has been killed and eaten by a she-wolf. For some reason, however, he is unable to untie them, and the she-wolf continues to come every night until only Sigmund is left alive. On the day before he would die, Signý&#x27;s scout returns to the forest and gives him honey, instructing Sigmund to put some in his mouth and smear it on his face. When the she-wolf comes she begins to lick Sigmund&#x27;s face, and intrigued by the sweetness, she puts her tongue in his mouth to lick the honey out. As soon as she does so, Sigmund bites down on her tongue, ripping it out as the beast struggles and thereby killing the she-wolf. The sage mentions that this wolf may have been Siggeir&#x27;s mother who took the shape of a she-wolf through &quot;witchcraft and sorcery&quot;. Sigmund stays where he is so that Signý&#x27;s scouts can find him again. They do, informing Signý of what happened. She visits him and helps him dig an underground base, bringing him enough supplies to survive in secret while they plot revenge against Siggeir.

One night, while Signý is sitting in her chamber, a völva comes and asks her to exchange forms. They do, and the seeress sleeps with Siggeir that night without the king&#x27;s notice. Meanwhile, Signý travels to Sigmund&#x27;s base in the form of the völva, telling him that she had gotten lost in the woods. Sigmund accepts her in, and they have incestuous sexual intercourse. After changing back, Signý discovers she is pregnant. She gives birth to Sinfjǫtli.

When Sinfjǫtli is ten, Signý puts him and her other sons through a painful test to see who is worthy of serving Sigmund. Although the others cry out in pain, Sinfjǫtli does not flinch. Together, Sigmund and Sinfjǫtli plot revenge against King Siggeir. One night, they sneak into Siggeir&#x27;s dwelling and try to assassinate him, but one of Siggeir&#x27;s children catch them and have them seized. The two are thrown in a mound but escape with the power of Sigmund&#x27;s sword that Signý returns to him. They kill Siggeir by making him walk into a bonfire. Signý walks in with him, wanting to die with her husband. Sigmund takes the throne, becoming a great and powerful ruler. He marries Borghild and by her has a son named Helgi.

As an adult, Helgi meets Sigrún, daughter of King Högne, and wishes to marry her. She tells him that her father has promised her to Hothbrodd, so Helgi and Sinfjǫtli raise an army and invade Hothbrodd&#x27;s realm. Helgi kills Hothbrodd, marries Sigrún, and usurps Hothbrodd&#x27;s kingship. Sinfjǫtli also meets a woman he wishes to marry, and to win her he fights and kills another man, who happens to be Borghild&#x27;s brother. In revenge, Borghild kills Sinfjǫtli by poison. A grieving Sigmund rejects Borghild and drives her out of his kingdom.

As an old man, Sigmund marries Hjördís, daughter of King Eylimi. The suitor she rejected in Sigmund&#x27;s favor brings an army against him, and Sigmund is mortally wounded in the battle. Hjördís finds her wounded husband, who entrusts to her the shards of his sword, prophesying that they will be reforged someday for their yet unborn son. He dies, and Hjördís is taken in by Alf, son of Hjalprek, king of Denmark. Shortly thereafter she gives birth to Sigurd, her son by Sigmund. Sigurd is fostered in Hjalprek&#x27;s court by Reginn, his tutor, and grows to manhood there.

=== Sigurd and his foster family ===
Sigurd grows up to be strong, brave, and very popular. One day, he enters the forest looking for a horse and meets Odin, who gives him Grani, who is descended from Odin&#x27;s own Sleipnir and better than any other horse. With Grani, Reginn believes Sigurd capable of a heroic quest and decides to tell him the story of Fáfnir the dragon.

Reginn&#x27;s father Hreiðmarr had three sons: himself, Ótr, and Fáfnir. Ótr was able to shapeshift into an otter-like fisherman, Fáfnir was large and fierce, and Reginn was skilled with ironwork. One day, Odin, Loki, and Hœnir were fishing and killed Ótr in his otter shape, then skinned and ate him. King Hreiðmarr found out and demanded that they fill and cover the skin with gold. Loki took the dwarf Andvari&#x27;s gold and the debt was paid. But out of Andvari&#x27;s treasure, he cursed a ring called Andvaranaut (&quot;Andvari&#x27;s gift&quot;), warning that it would bring death to anyone who owned it. Later, Fáfnir killed his father, hid the body, and took all the treasure, including the Advaranaut, to his hoard. There, he turned into an evil dragon. Reginn, meanwhile, became a smith for King Hjalprek.

Reginn convinces Sigurd to slay Fáfnir and take the treasure. In preparation, he smiths two swords one after another for Sigurd, but they break when he tests them. Sigurd&#x27;s mother gives him the pieces of his father&#x27;s broken sword and Reginn reforges them into a legendary sword called Gram. When Sigurd tests it, it splits the iron anvil down to its base. Before going to kill Fáfnir, he goes to the soothsayer Grípir to ask about his fate. Grípir tells him after some hesitation, and Sigurd returns to Reginn, saying he must avenge his father Sigmund before he can kill the dragon. Sigurd sails to Hunding&#x27;s kingdom and kills many and burns settlements. A brutal battle ensues between him and King Lyngvi and Hunding&#x27;s sons, but Sigurd kills them all with Gram. He returns to Reginn to prepare to meet Fáfnir.

Sigurd travels to Fáfnir&#x27;s territory and digs a ditch to hide in and stab the dragon from. Odin comes and advises him to dig several ditches for the blood to flow into, which he does. As Fáfnir crawls over the ditch, Sigurd stabs him through the heart. As the dragon is dying, he asks Sigurd about his lineage and says that his gold and Reginn will be the cause of Sigurd&#x27;s death. Sigurd returns to Reginn, who was hiding in the heather during Fáfnir&#x27;s slaying. Reginn drinks Fáfnir&#x27;s blood and asks Sigurd to roast Fáfnir&#x27;s heart and let him eat it. When Sigurd tests whether the heart is fully cooked and licks his finger, he suddenly understands the speech of birds. He overhears the nuthatches talking to each other about Reginn&#x27;s plan to kill him. They say that he should eat the heart himself, kill Reginn, take the gold, and find Brynhild. Sigurd kills Reginn, eats some of the heart, takes as much treasure as he can carry, including the Helm of Terror and the Andvaranaut, and rides off on Grani.

Sigurd rides to the land of the Franks and finds a sleeping warrior. He removes the helmet, discovers it is a woman, and cuts her chainmail open. She wakes and tells him Odin stabbed her with a sleeping thorn and mandated that she must marry, but she refuses to marry any man who knows fear. Brynhild gives him beer and recites a poem about how to use different magical runes. Following this, Brynhild gives Sigurd several pieces of sound advice on how to navigate society and survive, and they agree to marry each other.

=== Sigurd and the Gjukingar ===
Sigurd rides to the estate of Heimr, husband of Bekkhild, Brynhild&#x27;s sister. Sigurd catches sight of Brynhild weaving a golden tapestry in the castle. Alsvid tells him to not think about women, but after Brynhild saying they are not fated to be together, they renew their vows.

Meanwhile, a skilled sorceress named Grimhild is married to King Gjuki, and together they have three sons: Gunnar, Hǫgni, and Guthormr. Their daughter Guðrún has a dream about a golden hawk, which Brynhild interprets as her future husband. They then talk of Sigurd&#x27;s excellence and the prophecies about him before his birth. Then Guðrún has a dream about a handsome stag, which Brynhild interprets as Sigurd. Brynhild prophesies she will marry Sigurd, lose him, marry Atli the Hun, lose her brothers, then kill Atli.

Sigurd comes to Gjuki with his horse Grani and his treasure from the dragon Fáfnir. Grimhild gives him a drink that makes him forget about Brynhild, wanting him to marry Guðrún. Gunnar and the others swear brotherhood with Sigurd, and he marries Guðrún. She eats some of the dragon&#x27;s heart, and bears Sigurd a son, Sigmund. Meanwhile, Grimhild encourages Gunnar to marry Brynhild. Sigurd and the three brothers ride to King Buðli for Gunnar to ask for Brynhild&#x27;s hand. She is inside a hall surrounded by fire and has vowed an oath to marry whoever can ride through the flames, believing only Sigurd could be brave enough to do so. Gunnar can&#x27;t take on this task, so he and Sigurd exchange shapes, and Sigurd rides through the fire and asks Brynhild to marry him as Gunnar. Brynhild reluctantly agrees because of her oath and leaves her daughter Aslaug by Sigurd to be raised with Heimr.

Years later, Brynhild and Guðrún are arguing about whose husband is better, and Guðrún shows her the ring which Brynhild had given Sigurd. Brynhild recognizes the ring and realizes she has been tricked. She tells Gunnar she knows he deceived her and that she will kill him and seek revenge on Grimhild. Brynhild takes to her room and Sigurd comes to try to make amends by asking her to marry him, but she rejects his offer, wanting to die and bring doom upon everyone involved.

Gunnar consults with his brothers whether they should kill Sigurd to keep Brynhild or not. They decide to give snake&#x27;s and wolf&#x27;s meat to Guthormr to turn him violent and kill Sigurd. He goes into Sigurd&#x27;s bed chamber and stabs him while asleep. Sigurd wakes up and before dying, throws Gram after him as he leaves, cutting Guthormr in two. Brynhild laughs when she hears Guðrún sobbing, and Guðrún tells Gunnar he made a mistake by killing Sigurd. Brynhild also tells Gunnar he has made a mistake and stabs herself. But before she dies, she foretells the rest of Gunnar&#x27;s and Guðrún&#x27;s future. Gunnar fulfills Brynhild&#x27;s last request, that he put her on a bonfire with Sigurd, Guthormr, and Sigurd&#x27;s 3-year-old son.

=== Guðrún and the Budlingar ===
Everyone mourns Sigurd&#x27;s death and Guðrún runs away, ending up with King Half in Denmark. Grimhild finds Guðrún and orders her to marry King Atli against her will, which she unhappily does. One night, Atli has a dream that he is fed his children, which Guðrún interprets to mean his sons will die. She sends her brothers a runic message warning them about Atli, but the messenger Vingi alters it, inviting her brothers to come to Atli&#x27;s hall. Hǫgni&#x27;s wife Kostbera sees the message is false and tells him. She tells her dream to Hǫgni, in which she predicts the treachery of Atli and Hǫgni&#x27;s death, but he does not believe her. Gunnar&#x27;s wife Glaumvor also has symbolic dreams predicting Gunnar&#x27;s betrayal by Atli and his death, but he eventually gives up trying to interpret them differently and simply concedes he will probably have a short life. Gunnar and Hǫgni go with Vingi to Atli. Vingi reveals he betrayed them, and Gunnar and Hǫgni kill him with their axe handles.

When they arrive, Atli says he wants Sigurd&#x27;s gold and will avenge Sigurd by killing his brothers-in-law. Guðrún tries to stop the fighting, but then puts on armor, picks up a sword, and fights with her brothers. Many of Atli&#x27;s champions are killed. Of their army, only Gunnar and Hǫgni survive and are captured. Hǫgni&#x27;s heart is cut out and shown to Gunnar. Gunnar is placed in a snake pit, but Guðrún brings him a harp which he plays with his toes. All the snakes fall asleep except one, which bites his heart and kills him.

Guðrún and Atli hold a funeral feast. Later, Guðrún kills Atli&#x27;s two sons and gives their blood and hearts to Atli to eat and drink. Atli says she deserves to be killed. Hǫgni&#x27;s son Niflung wants to avenge his father, so he and Guðrún stab Atli while he is asleep. After he dies, Guðrún sets the hall on fire and all Atli&#x27;s retainers die while fighting each other in panic.

=== Guðrún&#x27;s last marriage ===
Guðrún and Sigurd&#x27;s daughter is Svanhild, radiantly beautiful. Guðrún goes to the sea to drown herself after killing Atli, but she gets swept away to the court of King Jonakr, who marries her. They have three sons: Hamdir, Sorli, and Erp. Svanhild is raised with them.

King Jormunrek wants to marry Svanhild, but Bikki convinces Jormunrek&#x27;s son Randver that he would be a better match for her than his father, so he and Svanhild marry. Upon Bikki&#x27;s advice, Jormunrek hangs Randver and has horses trample Svanhild to death.

Guðrún encourages her sons to kill Jormunrek and avenge Svanhild. Her sons ask Erp if he will help them kill Jormunrek, but he gives an ambivalent answer they misunderstand as arrogance, so they kill him, coming to regret it afterwards. They meet Jormunrek and cut off his hands and feet, but Erp would have cut off Jormunrek&#x27;s head, which would have kept Jormunrek from calling for his housecarls. The housecarls are unable to kill Guðrún&#x27;s sons with sharp weapons. Odin then appears as an old one-eyed man and advises Jormunrek&#x27;s housecarls to have the avengers killed with stones, which they do.

==Themes==
===Odin and the supernatural===
Throughout the saga, elements of the supernatural are interwoven into the narrative. One recurring theme is the periodic appearance of Odin, the foremost among Norse deities, associated with &quot;war, wisdom, ecstasy, and poetry&quot;. He is typically depicted as a mysterious, hooded old man with one eye.

Odin appears a number of times to assist characters with his magic and powers. At the start of the saga, he guides his son Sigi out of the underworld. He also sends a wish maiden to Sigi&#x27;s son Rerir with an enchanted apple that finally allowed Rerir and his wife to have a child. Later, he appears as an old, one-eyed stranger and sticks his sword into the tree Barnstokkr during a feast at the palace of King Völsung, declaring that &quot;he who draws this sword out of the trunk shall receive it from me as a gift, and he himself shall prove that he has never carried a better sword than this one&quot;, which King Völsung&#x27;s son Sigmund does.

Odin also directly intervenes during key points in the narrative. During a battle, Odin, again in the guise of an old, one-eyed man, breaks Sigmund&#x27;s sword, turning the tide of the battle and ultimately leading to his death. He also stabs Brynhild with a sleeping thorn and curses her never to win another battle as an act of revenge for killing Hjalmgunnar, a rival king to whom Odin had promised victory.

===The ring Andvaranaut===
In the latter half of the saga the ring Andvaranaut serves as a connection and explanation for the characters&#x27; troubles. Loki killed Ótr, the son of Hreidmar. As compensation for Ótr&#x27;s death, Loki coerced a dwarf named Andvari into repaying the debt with gold. Andvari tried to hold onto one gold ring and when Loki forced him to give it up Andvari cursed the ring, saying, &quot;This ring... and indeed the entire treasure, will be the death of whoever owns it.&quot; This plays out as one character after another is killed soon after they receive the ring. Ótr&#x27;s brother Fáfnir killed his father in order to get the ring and then turned into a dragon to protect it. Sigurd then kills Fáfnir, taking the ring and giving it to Brynhild. The ring is then brought into Queen Grimhild&#x27;s family after her children marry Sigurd and Brynhild. The story of the Andvaranaut is thought to have been one of the texts that inspired J.R.R Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

==Adaptations and related works==

The Middle High German epic poem the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; is related in content. The relative historical accuracy and origin of both works are a subject of academic research—however, whilst traditionally the stories from the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; were assumed to contain an earlier or &quot;more original&quot; version, the actual development of the different texts is more complex—for more details see Nibelungenlied § Origins.

Among the more notable adaptations of this text are Richard Wagner&#x27;s tetralogy of music dramas &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, Ernest Reyer&#x27;s opera &quot;Sigurd&quot;, Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Vikings at Helgeland&quot;, and William Morris&#x27;s epic poem &quot;The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs&quot;. J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún&quot; is derived instead from the Völsung poems in the &quot;Elder Edda&quot;, as Tolkien thought the author of the saga had made a jumble of things.

The saga is also one inspiration for Þráinn Bertelsson&#x27;s satirical crime novel &quot;Valkyrjur&quot; (Reykjavík: JPV, 2005). Melvin Burgess similarly drew inspiration from the saga in his novel &quot;Bloodtide&quot; (1999) and its sequel &quot;Bloodsong&quot; (2007).

<text>The premier of British Columbia is the first minister for the Canadian province of British Columbia. The province was a British crown colony governed by the governors of British Columbia before joining Canadian Confederation in 1871. Since then, it has had a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the premier is the leader of the party that controls the most seats in the legislative assembly. The premier is British Columbia&#x27;s head of government, and the of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the lieutenant governor of British Columbia. The premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of British Columbia and presides over that body.

Members are first elected to the legislature during general elections. General elections must be conducted every four years from the date of the last election. An election may also take place if the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a no-confidence motion.

Before 1903, British Columbia did not use a party system; instead, premiers of British Columbia had no official party affiliation and were chosen by elected members of the legislative assembly from among themselves. Candidates ran as &quot;Government&quot;, &quot;Opposition&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, or in formulations such as &quot;Opposition independent&quot;, indicating their respective positions to the incumbent regime.

British Columbia has had 36 individuals serve as premier since joining Confederation, of which 14 individuals had no party affiliation, three were Conservatives, eight were Liberals, four were Socreds, and seven were New Democrats. The first premier was John Foster McCreight, who was inaugurated in 1871. Joseph Martin spent the shortest time in office, at 106 days. At over twenty years, W. A. C. Bennett spent the longest time in office and is the only premier to serve in more than five parliaments. The incumbent premier is David Eby, who was sworn in on November 18, 2022.

<doc id="70489" wikidata="Q653421" url="?curid=70489" title="Geordie">
<text>Geordie ( ) is an English dialect spoken in the Tyneside area of North East England, especially connected with Newcastle upon Tyne, and sometimes known in linguistics as Tyneside English or Newcastle English. The Geordie dialect and identity are primarily associated with a working-class background. A 2008 newspaper survey found the Geordie accent to be perceived as the &quot;most attractive in England&quot; among the British public.

&quot;Geordie&quot; is also a nickname for a resident of this same region, though there are different definitions of what constitutes a Geordie, and not everyone from the North East identifies as such. Furthermore, a Geordie can mean a supporter of the football club Newcastle United. Geordie Schooner glass was traditionally used to serve Newcastle Brown Ale.

==History==
Like all English dialects, the Geordie dialect traces back to the Old English spoken by Anglo-Saxon settlers, initially employed by the ancient Brythons who fought Pictish invaders after the end of Roman rule in Britain in the 5th century. The Angles, Saxons, and Jutes who arrived became ascendant politically and culturally over the native British through subsequent migration from tribal homelands along the North Sea coast of mainland Europe. The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms that emerged in the Dark Ages spoke largely mutually intelligible varieties of what is now called Old English, each varying somewhat in phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon. In Northern England and the Scottish borders, then dominated by the kingdom of Northumbria, there developed a distinct Northumbrian Old English dialect, which preceded modern Geordie. The linguistic conservatism of Geordie means that poems by the Anglo-Saxon scholar the Venerable Bede can be translated more successfully into Geordie than into standard modern English. 

The British Library points out that the Norse, who primarily lived south of the River Tees, affected the language in Yorkshire but not in regions to the north. This source adds that &quot;the border skirmishes that broke out sporadically during the Middle Ages meant the River Tweed established itself as a significant northern barrier against Scottish influence&quot;. Today, many who speak the Geordie dialect use words such as &quot;gan&quot; (&#x27;go&#x27; – modern Dutch ) and &quot;bairn&quot; (&#x27;child&#x27; – modern Danish ), which &quot;can still trace their roots right back to the Angles&quot;.

==Geographical coverage==
===People===
When referring to the people, as opposed to the dialect, dictionary definitions of a Geordie typically refer to a native or inhabitant of Newcastle upon Tyne, England, or its environs, an area that encompasses North Tyneside, Newcastle, South Tyneside and Gateshead. This area has a combined population of around 700,000, based on 2011 census-data.

The term itself, according to Brockett, originated from all the North East coal mines. The catchment area for the term &quot;Geordie&quot; can include Northumberland and County Durham or be confined to an area as small as the city of Newcastle upon Tyne and the metropolitan boroughs of Tyneside.

Scott Dobson, the author of the book &quot;Larn Yersel Geordie&quot;, once stated that his grandmother, who was brought up in Byker, thought the miners were the true Geordies. There is a theory the name comes from the Northumberland and Durham coal mines. Poems and songs written in this area in 1876 (according to the OED), speak of the &quot;Geordie&quot;.

===Dialect===
Academics refer to the Geordie dialect as &quot;Tyneside English&quot;.

According to the British Library, &quot;Locals insist there are significant differences between Geordie and several other local dialects, such as Pitmatic and Mackem. Pitmatic is the dialect of the former mining areas in County Durham and around Ashington to the north of Newcastle upon Tyne, while &quot;Mackem&quot; is used locally to refer to the dialect of the city of Sunderland and the surrounding urban area of Wearside&quot;.

==Etymology==
A number of rival theories explain how the term &quot;Geordie&quot; came about, though all accept that it derives from a familiar diminutive form of the name George, &quot;a very common name among the pitmen&quot; (coal miners) in North East England; indeed, it was once the most popular name for eldest sons in the region.

One account traces the name to the times of the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715. The Jacobites declared that the natives of Newcastle were staunch supporters of the Hanoverian kings, whose first representative George I reigned (1714–1727) at the time of the 1715 rebellion. Newcastle contrasted with rural Northumberland, which largely supported the Jacobite cause. In this case, the term &quot;Geordie&quot; may have derived from the popular anti-Hanoverian song &quot;Cam Ye O&#x27;er Frae France?&quot;, which calls the first Hanoverian king &quot;Geordie Whelps&quot;, a play on &quot;George the Guelph&quot;.

Another explanation for the name states that local miners in the northeast of England used Geordie safety lamps, designed by George Stephenson, known locally as &quot;Geordie the engine-wright&quot;, in 1815 rather than the competing Davy lamps, designed about the same time by Humphry Davy and used in other mining communities. Using the chronological order of two John Trotter Brockett books, &quot;Geordie&quot; was given to North East pitmen; later he acknowledges that the pitmen also christened their Stephenson lamp &quot;Geordie&quot;.

Linguist Katie Wales also dates the term earlier than does the current &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;; she observes that &quot;Geordy&quot; (or &quot;Geordie&quot;) was a common name given to coal-mine pitmen in ballads and songs of the region, noting that such usage turns up as early as 1793. It occurs in the titles of two songs by songwriter Joe Wilson: &quot;Geordy, Haud the Bairn&quot; and &quot;Keep your Feet Still, Geordie&quot;. Citing such examples as the song &quot;Geordy Black&quot;, written by Rowland Harrison of Gateshead, she contends that, as a consequence of popular culture, the miner and the keelman had become icons of the region in the 19th century, and &quot;Geordie&quot; was a label that &quot;affectionately and proudly reflected this,&quot; replacing the earlier ballad emblem, the figure of Bob Crankie.

In the &quot;English Dialect Dictionary&quot; of 1900, Joseph Wright gave as his fourth definition of &quot;Geordie&quot;: &quot;A man from Tyneside; a miner; a north-country collier vessel&quot;, quoting two sources from Northumberland, one from East Durham and one from Australia. The source from Durham stated: &quot;In South Tyneside even, this name was applied to the Lower Tyneside men.&quot;

Newcastle publisher Frank Graham&#x27;s &quot;Geordie Dictionary&quot; states:

In Graham&#x27;s many years of research, the earliest record he found of the term&#x27;s use dated to 1823 by local comedian Billy Purvis. Purvis had set up a booth at the Newcastle Races on the Town Moor. In an angry tirade against a rival showman, who had hired a young pitman called Tom Johnson to dress as a clown, Billy cried out to the clown:

(Rough translation: &quot;Oh man, who but a fool would have sold off his furniture and left his wife? Now, you&#x27;re a fair downright fool, not an artificial fool like Billy Purvis! You&#x27;re a real Geordie! Go on, man, and hide yourself! Go on and get your picks [axes] again. You may do for the city, but never for the west end of our town!&quot;)

John Camden Hotten wrote in 1869: &quot;Geordie, general term in Northumberland and Durham for a pitman, or coal-miner. Origin not known; the term has been in use more than a century.&quot; Using Hotten as a chronological reference, Geordie has been documented for at least years as a term related to Northumberland and County Durham.

The name &quot;Bad-weather Geordy&quot; applied to cockle sellers:

Travel writer Scott Dobson used the term &quot;Geordieland&quot; in a 1973 guidebook to refer collectively to Northumberland and Durham.

==Linguistic surveys==
The Survey of English Dialects included Earsdon and Heddon-on-the-Wall in its fieldwork, administering more than 1,000 questions to local informants.

The Linguistic Survey of Scotland included Cumberland and Northumberland (using historic boundaries) in its scope, collecting words through postal questionnaires. Tyneside sites included Cullercoats, Earsdon, Forest Hall, Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne, Wallsend-on-Tyne and Whitley Bay.

==Phonology==

The phonemic notation used in this article is based on the set of symbols used by . Other scholars may use different transcriptions. Watt and Allen stated that there were approximately 800,000 people in the early 2000s who spoke this form of British English.

Tyneside English (TE) is spoken in Newcastle upon Tyne, a city of around 260,000 inhabitants in the far north of England, and in the conurbation stretching east and south of Newcastle along the valley of the River Tyne as far as the North Sea. The total population of this conurbation, which also subsumes Gateshead, Jarrow, North and South Shields, Whitley Bay, and Tynemouth, exceeds 800,000.

===Consonants===
Geordie consonants generally follow those of Received Pronunciation, with these unique characteristics as follows:

* appearing in an unstressed final syllable of a word (such as in &quot;reading&quot;) is pronounced as (thus, &quot;reading&quot; is ).
* The Geordie accent does not use the glottal stop in a usual fashion. It is characterised by a unique type of glottal stops. can all be pronounced simultaneously with a glottal stop after them in Geordie, both at the end of a syllable and sometimes before a weak vowel.
** T-glottalisation, in which is realised by before a syllabic nasal (e.g., &quot;button&quot; as ), in absolute final position (&quot;get&quot; as ), and whenever the is intervocalic so long as the latter vowel is not stressed (&quot;pity&quot; as ).
** Glottaling in Geordie is known as &#x27;pre-glottalisation&#x27;, which is &quot;an occlusion at the appropriate place of articulation and &#x27;glottalisation&#x27;, usually manifested as a short period of laryngealised voice before and/or after and often also during the stop gap&quot;. This type of glottal is unique to Tyneside English.
* Other voiceless stops, , are glottally reinforced in medial position, and preaspirated in final position.
* The dialect is non-rhotic like most other dialects of England, with being realised most commonly as an alveolar approximant , although a labiodental realisation is additionally growing in prevalence among younger females. (This variant is also possible, albeit rarer, in the speech of older males.) Traditionally, intrusive R was not present in Geordie, with speakers instead glottalising between boundaries; however, it is present in newer varieties of the dialect.
* &quot;Yod&quot;-coalescence in both stressed and unstressed syllables (so that &quot;dew&quot; becomes ).
* is traditionally clear in all contexts, meaning the velarised allophone is absent. However, modern accents may periodically use in syllable final positions, sometimes it may even be vocalised (as in &quot;bottle&quot; ).

===Vowels===

; Length
* For some speakers, vowel length alternates with vowel quality in a very similar way to the Scottish vowel length rule.
* Vowel length is phonemic for many speakers of Geordie, meaning that length is often the one and only phonetic difference between and ( and ) or between and ( and ). If older or traditional dialect forms are considered, () also has a phonemic long counterpart , which is mostly used in words spelled with , making minimal pairs such as &quot;tack&quot; vs. &quot;talk&quot; (less broad Geordie pronunciation: ). Another appears as an allophone of before final voiced consonants in words such as &quot;lad&quot; .

; Phonetic quality and phonemic incidence
* and , , are typically somewhat closer than in other varieties in morphologically closed syllables; is also less prone to fronting than in other varieties of BrE and its quality is rather close to the cardinal . However, younger women tend to use a central instead. In morphologically open syllables, and are realised as closing diphthongs . This creates minimal pairs such as &quot;freeze&quot; vs. &quot;frees&quot; and &quot;bruise&quot; (hereafter transcribed with for the sake of simplicity) vs. &quot;brews&quot; .
** The vowel is tense and is best analysed as belonging to the phoneme.
* As with other Northern English varieties, Geordie lacks the – split, so that words like &quot;cut&quot;, &quot;up&quot; and &quot;luck&quot; have the same phoneme as &quot;put&quot;, &quot;sugar&quot; and &quot;butcher&quot;. The typical phonetic realisation is unrounded , but it may be hypercorrected to among middle-class (especially female) speakers.
* The long close-mid vowels , in and , may be realised as monophthongs in open syllables or as opening diphthongs in closed syllables. Alternatively, can be a closing diphthong and can be centralised to . The opening diphthongs are recessive, as younger speakers reject them in favour of the monophthongal .
** Other, now archaic, realisations of include in &quot;snow&quot; and in &quot;soldiers&quot; .
** Many female speakers merge with , but the exact phonetic quality of the merged vowel is uncertain.
* , , may be phonetically or a higher, unrounded vowel . An RP-like vowel is also possible.
** In older broadest Geordie, merges with to under the influence of a uvular that once followed it (when Geordie was still a rhotic dialect). The fact that the original vowel is never hypercorrected to or suggests that either this merger was never categorical, or that speakers are unusually successful in sorting those vowels out again.
* The schwa is often rather open (). It also tends to be longer in duration than the preceding stressed vowel, even if that vowel is phonologically long. Therefore, words such as &quot;water&quot; and &quot;meter&quot; are pronounced and . This feature is shared with the very conservative (&quot;Upper Crust&quot;) variety of Received Pronunciation.
** Words such as &quot;voices&quot; and &quot;ended&quot; have in the second syllable (so ), rather than the of RP. That does not mean that Geordie has undergone the weak vowel merger because can still be found in some unstressed syllables in place of the more usual . An example of that is the second syllable of &quot;seven&quot; , but it can also be pronounced with a simple schwa instead. Certain weak forms also have instead of ; these include &quot;at&quot; (homophonous with strong &quot;it&quot;), &quot;of&quot; (nearly homophonous with &quot;if&quot;), &quot;as&quot; (homophonous with strong &quot;is&quot;), &quot;can&quot; and &quot;us&quot; (again, homophonous with strong &quot;is&quot;).
* As in other Northern English dialects, the vowel is short in Geordie, thus there is no London-style trap–bath split. There are a small number of exceptions to this rule; for instance, &quot;half&quot;, &quot;master&quot;, &quot;plaster&quot; and sometimes also &quot;disaster&quot; are pronounced with the vowel .
* Some speakers unround , , to . Regardless of the rounding, the difference in backness between and is very pronounced, a feature which Geordie shares with RP and some northern and midland cities such as Stoke-on-Trent and Derby, but not with the accents of the middle north.
* Older traditional Geordie does not always adhere to the same distributional patterns of vowels found in standard varieties of English. Examples of that include the words &quot;no&quot; and &quot;stone&quot;, which may be pronounced and , so with vowels that are best analysed as belonging to the and phonemes.

; Diphthongs
* The second elements of and , , are commonly as open as the typical Geordie realisation of ().
* The first element of , , varies between , and . Traditionally, this whole vowel was a high monophthong (with &quot;town&quot; being pronounced close to RP &quot;toon&quot;) and this pronunciation can still be heard, as can a narrower diphthong (with &quot;town&quot; being pronounced close to RP &quot;tone&quot;).
* is , but Geordie speakers generally use a less common allophone for certain environments in accordance with the Scottish vowel length rule, , which has a longer, lower, and more back onset than the main allophone. Thus is used in words such as &quot;knife&quot; , whereas is used in &quot;knives&quot; . For simplicity, both of them are written with in this article.

==Vocabulary==
The Geordie dialect shares similarities with other Northern English dialects, as well as with the Scots language (See Rowe 2007, 2009).

Dorfy, real name Dorothy Samuelson-Sandvid, was a noted Geordie dialect writer. In her column for the South Shields Gazette, Samuelson-Sandvid attests many samples of Geordie language usage, such as the nouns &quot;bairn&quot; (&quot;child&quot;) and &quot;clarts&quot; (&quot;mud&quot;); the adjectives &quot;canny&quot; (&quot;pleasant&quot;) and &quot;clag&quot; (&quot;sticky&quot;); and the imperative verb phrase &quot;howay&quot; (&quot;hurry up!&quot;; &quot;come on!&quot;)

&quot;&quot; is broadly comparable to the invocation &quot;Come on!&quot; or the French &quot;Allez-y!&quot; (&quot;Go on!&quot;). Examples of common use include &quot;Howay man!&quot;, meaning &quot;come on&quot; or &quot;hurry up&quot;, &quot;Howay the lads!&quot; as a term of encouragement for a sports team for example (the players&#x27; tunnel at St James&#x27; Park has this phrase just above the entrance to the pitch), or &quot;Ho&#x27;way!?&quot; (with stress on the second syllable) expressing incredulity or disbelief. The literal opposite of this phrase is &quot;haddaway&quot; (&quot;go away&quot;); although not as common as &quot;howay&quot;, it is perhaps most commonly used in the phrase &quot;Haddaway an&#x27; shite&quot; (Tom Hadaway, Figure 5.2 Haddaway an&#x27; shite; &#x27;Cursing like sleet blackening the buds, raging at the monk of Jarrow scribbling his morality and judgement into a book.&#x27;).

Another word, &quot;divvie&quot; or &quot;divvy&quot; (&quot;idiot&quot;), seems to come from the Co-op dividend, or from the two Davy lamps (the more explosive Scotch Davy used in 1850, commission disapproved of its use in 1886 (inventor not known, nicknamed Scotch Davy probably given by miners after the Davy lamp was made perhaps by north east miners who used the Stephenson Lamp), and the later better designed Davy designed by Humphry Davy also called the Divvy.) As in a north east miner saying &#x27;Marra, ye keep way from me if ye usin a divvy.&#x27; It seems the word divvie then translated to daft lad/lass. Perhaps coming from the fact one would be seen as foolish going down a mine with a Scotch Divvy when there are safer lamps available, like the Geordie, or the Davy.

The Geordie word &quot;&quot;, meaning a toilet and place of need and necessity for relief or bathroom, has an uncertain origin. However, some have theorised that it may come from slang used by Roman soldiers on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, which may have later become &quot;&quot; in the Romance language Italian (such as in the Westoe Netty, the subject of a famous painting from Bob Olley). However, &quot;gabbinetto&quot; is the Modern Italian diminutive of &quot;gabbia&quot;, which actually derives from the Latin &quot;&quot; (&quot;hollow&quot;, &quot;cavity&quot;, &quot;enclosure&quot;), the root of the loanwords that became the Modern English &quot;cave&quot;, &quot;cage&quot;, and &quot;gaol&quot;. Thus, another explanation would be that it comes from a Modern Italian form of the word &quot;&quot;, though only a relatively small number of Italians have migrated to the North of England, mostly during the 19th century.

Some etymologists connect the word &quot;&quot; to the Modern English word &quot;needy&quot;. John Trotter Brockett, writing in 1829 in his &quot;A glossary of north country words...&quot;, claims that the etymon of &quot;netty&quot; (and its related form &quot;neddy&quot;) is the Modern English &quot;needy&quot; and &quot;need&quot;.

Bill Griffiths, in &quot;A Dictionary of North East Dialect&quot;, points to the earlier form, the Old English &quot;níd&quot;; he writes: &quot;MS locates a possible early ex. &quot;Robert Hovyngham sall make... at the other end of his house a knyttyng&quot; York 1419, in which case the root could be OE níd &#x27;necessary&#x27;&quot;. Another related word, &quot;nessy&quot; is thought (by Griffiths) to derive from the Modern English &quot;necessary&quot;.

A poem called &quot;Yam&quot; narrated by author Douglas Kew demonstrates the usage of a number of Geordie words.

<text>A Short History of the Confederate States of America is a memoir written by Jefferson Davis, completed shortly before his death in 1889. Davis wrote most of this book while staying at Beauvoir along the Mississippi Gulf Coast near Biloxi, Mississippi.

The book is much less a Davis memoir than an articulation of the secession argument. In Davis&#x27; earlier work, &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government&quot;, he had written what is probably the most thorough exegesis of the compact theory of the United States Constitution in existence, devoting the first fifteen chapters of the book to that topic. Fearful that his readers might not understand, or might forget, he repeated the explanation every second or third chapter after that. Still concerned that people might not understand the compact theory of the Constitution, he wrote A Short History of the Confederate States of America shortly before his death.

The book was first published in 1890 by Belford Co. in New York.

<text>Adûnaic (or Númenórean) (&quot;language of the West&quot;) is one of the fictional languages devised by J. R. R. Tolkien for his fantasy works.

One of the languages of Arda in Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth legendarium, Adûnaic was spoken by the Men of Númenor during the Second Age. By the time of the War of the Ring at the end of the Third Age, it had developed into the common speech or Westron.

==Fictional history==

Adûnaic was invented by the first Men as they awoke in Hildórien. It was the language of Númenor, and after its destruction in the Akallabêth, the &quot;native speech&quot; of the people of Elendil in the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor in the west of Middle-earth, though they usually spoke the Elvish language Sindarin. By the time of the War of the Ring, it had developed into the common speech or Westron. Tolkien called Adûnaic &quot;the language of the culturally and politically influential Númenóreans.&quot;

== Concept and creation ==

Although Tolkien created very few original words in Adûnaic, mostly names, the language serves his concept as the ancestor of a lingua franca for Middle-earth, Westron, a shared language for many different peoples.

Tolkien devised Adûnaic (or Númenórean), the language spoken in Númenor, shortly after World War II, and thus at about the time he completed &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, but before he wrote the linguistic background information of the Appendices. Adûnaic is intended as the language from which Westron (also called &quot;Adûni&quot;) is derived.
This added a depth of historical development to the Mannish languages. Adûnaic was intended to have a &quot;faintly Semitic flavour&quot;. Its development began with his 1945 work &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot;. It is there that the most extensive sample of the language is found, revealed to one of the (modern-day) protagonists, Lowdham, in a visionary dream of Atlantis. Its grammar is sketched in the unfinished &quot;Lowdham&#x27;s Report on the Adunaic Language&quot;, included in &quot;Sauron Defeated&quot;.
Tolkien remained undecided whether the language of the Men of Númenor should be derived from the original Mannish language (as in Adûnaic), or if it should be derived from &quot;the Elvish Noldorin&quot; (i.e. Quenya) instead. In &quot;The Lost Road and Other Writings&quot; it is implied that the Númenóreans spoke Quenya, and that Sauron, hating all things Elvish, taught the Númenóreans the old Mannish tongue they themselves had forgotten.

==Phonology==

The phonology is as follows:

1

== Grammar ==
Most information about Adûnaic grammar comes from an incomplete typescript &quot;Lowdham&#x27;s Report on the Adûnaic Language&quot;, written by Tolkien to accompany &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot;. The report discusses phonology and morphological processes in some detail, and starts to discuss nouns, but breaks off before saying much about verbs, other parts of speech or the grammar as a whole. It appears that Tolkien abandoned work on the language after writing this portion of the Report, and never returned to it.

=== Nouns ===

Most Adûnaic nouns are triconsonantal, but there are a number of biconsonantal nouns as well. Nouns can be divided into three declensions, called Strong I, Strong II and Weak. The two strong declensions form their various cases by modifying the last vowel, similarly to English &quot;man/men&quot;. The weak declension forms its cases by appending a suffix.

There are three numbers, singular, plural and dual. Dual is used mainly for &quot;natural pairs&quot;, like eyes and shoes. There are three cases, Normal, Subjective and Objective. The Subjective case is used as the subject of a verb. The Objective case is used only in compound expressions and appears only in the singular. The Normal case is used in all other circumstances, such as the object of a verb.

Example declensions:
== Sample text ==

This Adûnaic text, part of the tale of the Fall of Númenor, appears in &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot;. It is fragmentary because it appeared in a dream to Tolkien&#x27;s frame story character Lowdham, and is only partially translated by him because he did not know the language. Words in bold are not translated at the point in the text where the translation is first given, but their translation is given later in the story.

<text>Tom Maguire (28 March 1892 – 5 July 1993) was an Irish republican who held the rank of commandant-general in the Western Command of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and led the South Mayo flying column.

==Early life==
Tom Maguire was born 28 March 1892 in Cross, County Mayo, the fourth of eleven children of William Maguire, and Mary Grehan. He joined the Irish Volunteers on their foundation in 1913, and after the 1916 Easter rising, he formed the first company of Volunteers in Cross in 1917. He was elected as a member of Mayo County Council in June 1920 and was subsequently chairman of Ballinrobe district council.

==Irish Republican Army==
On 18 September 1920, the Mayo Brigade was reorganised, it was split up into four separate brigades. Maguire was appointed commander of the South Mayo Brigade.

On 3 May 1921, Maguire led an ambush on a Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) patrol in Toormakeady, County Mayo, killing five members of the RIC. Maguire&#x27;s flying column then made for the Partry Mountains. One account claimed that the column were surrounded by over 700 soldiers and policemen guided by aeroplanes. Maguire was wounded and his adjutant (Michael O&#x27;Brien) killed, but the column managed to escape with no further casualties. British casualties were not revealed but were believed to have been high. Some recent research has raised the possibility that fewer than forty British soldiers were in the vicinity and that Maguire&#x27;s column was forced to abandon their weapons with only one British officer wounded.

Maguire was involved in numerous other engagements including the Kilfall ambush.

At the 1921 election to Dáil Éireann, Maguire was returned unopposed as Teachta Dála (TD) for Mayo South–Roscommon South as a Sinn Féin candidate. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and apart from saying &quot;Níl&quot; (&quot;No&quot; in English) when the vote was called, did not participate in any substantial way in the Dáil treaty debates. He was returned unopposed at the 1922 general election. At the 1923 general election, Maguire faced a contest and succeeded in securing the second of five seats in the Mayo South constituency, winning 5,712 votes (17.8%). He was a member of the anti-Treaty IRA executive which commanded rebel troops during the Irish Civil War. Maguire was captured by the National Army while in bed and was told that he would be executed, but his life was spared. While in prison his brother, Sean Maguire, aged 17, was executed by the government.

Maguire remained a TD until 1927. He had initially indicated a willingness to contest the June 1927 general election as a Sinn Féin candidate but withdrew after the IRA threatened to court-martial any member under IRA General Army Order 28, which forbade its members from standing in elections. (Despite this ban, IRA officers Seán Farrell (Leitrim–Sligo) and John Madden (Mayo North) contested the election, the latter successfully).

Maguire subsequently drifted out of the IRA and became vice-president of Sinn Féin from 1931 to 1933 during the presidency of Brian O&#x27;Higgins. In 1932, a Mayo IRA officer reported that Maguire, now firmly aligned with Sinn Féin, refused to call on men to join the IRA when speaking at republican commemorations. When challenged on this, Maguire claimed that, as the IRA &quot;were no longer the same as they used to be&quot;, he disagreed with the organisation.

==Maguire and republican legitimacy==
In December 1938, Maguire was one of a group of seven people, who had been elected to the Second Dáil in 1921, who met with the IRA Army Council under Seán Russell. At this meeting, the seven signed over what they contended was the authority of the Government of Dáil Éireann to the Army Council. Henceforth, the IRA Army Council perceived itself to be the legitimate government of the Irish Republic and, on this basis, the IRA and Sinn Féin justified their rejection of the states of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and political abstentionism from their parliamentary institutions. According to J. Bowyer Bell, in &quot;The Secret Army&quot;, &quot;With the possible exception of Tom Maguire, who went along, the Dáil members felt that the IRA request gave them the moral recognition so long denied by all factions and that their conditional devolution of power would in turn give the IRA the moral basis for the impending campaign&quot; of 1939–45.

When the majority of IRA and Sinn Féin decided to abandon abstentionism in the 1969–1970 split, Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Dáithí Ó Conaill sought and secured Maguire&#x27;s recognition of the Provisional IRA Council as the legitimate successor to the 1938 Army Council. Of the seven 1938 signatories, Maguire was the only one still alive. Maguire&#x27;s support meant that the Provisional Army Council could claim to being the legitimate government of Ireland and the caretaker of true Irish Republicanism. 

Likewise, in the aftermath of the 1986 split in the Republican Movement, both the Provisional IRA and the Continuity IRA sought Maguire&#x27;s support. Maguire signed a statement which was issued posthumously in 1996. In it, he conferred legitimacy on the Army Council of the Continuity IRA (who provided a firing party at Maguire&#x27;s funeral in 1993). In &quot;The Irish Troubles&quot;, J. Bowyer Bell describes Maguire&#x27;s opinion in 1986, &quot;abstentionism was a basic tenet of republicanism, a moral issue of principle. Abstentionism gave the movement legitimacy, the right to wage war, to speak for a Republic all but established in the hearts of the people.&quot;

==Death==
He died on 5 July 1993. He is buried in Cross, County Mayo. Republican Sinn Féin have held multiple commemorations by his graveside.

<text>The musical term alto, meaning &quot;high&quot; in (Latin: ), historically refers to the contrapuntal part higher than the tenor and its associated vocal range. In four-part voice leading alto is the second-highest part, sung in choruses by either low women&#x27;s or high men&#x27;s voices. In vocal classification these are usually called contralto and male alto or countertenor.

==Etymology==
In choral music for mixed voices, &quot;alto&quot; describes the lowest part commonly sung by women. The explanation for the anomaly of this name is to be found not in the use of adult falsettists in choirs of men and boys but further back in innovations in composition during the mid-15th century. Before this time it was usual to write a melodic &quot;cantus&quot; or &quot;superius&quot; against a tenor (from Latin &quot;tenere&quot;, to hold) or &#x27;held&#x27; part, to which might be added a contratenor, which was in counterpoint with (in other words, against = contra) the tenor. The composers of Ockeghem&#x27;s generation wrote two contratenor parts and designated them as &quot;contratenor altus&quot; and &quot;contratenor bassus&quot;; they were respectively higher and lower than the tenor part. From these derive both the modern terms &quot;alto&quot; (and contralto) and &quot;bass&quot;.

==In opera==
According to &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Opera&quot; (1992), the term &quot;alto&quot; refers to singers whose voice encompasses the pitches of the notes &quot;f&quot; to &quot;d&quot; (see Helmholtz pitch notation). The singer of this voice type is more often described, for a female, as a contralto; for a male, as a countertenor (or in early French music as &quot;haute-contre&quot;) or a falsetto singer. A castrato may also sing in this range.

==Solo voices==


The contralto voice is a matter of vocal timbre and tessitura as well as range, and a classically trained solo contralto would usually have a range greater than that of a normal choral alto part in both the upper and lower ranges. However, the vocal tessitura of a classically trained contralto would still make these singers more comfortable singing in the lower part of the voice. A choral non-solo contralto may also have a low range down to D3 (thus perhaps finding it easier to sing the choral tenor part), but some would have difficulty singing above E5. In a choral context mezzo-sopranos and contraltos might sing the alto part, together with countertenors, thus having three vocal timbres (and two means of vocal production) singing the same notes.

The use of the term &quot;alto&quot; to describe solo voices is mostly seen in contemporary music genres (pop, rock, etc.) to describe singers whose range is lower than that of a mezzo-soprano but higher than that of a true contralto, and is very rarely seen in classical music outside of soloists in choral works. In classical music, most women with an alto range would be grouped within mezzo-sopranos, but many terms in common usage in various languages and in different cultures exist to describe solo classical singers with this range. Examples include contralto, countertenor, &quot;haute-contre&quot;, and &quot;tenor altino&quot;, among others.

== In choral music ==

In SATB four-part mixed chorus, the alto is the second-highest vocal range, above the tenor and bass and below the soprano. The alto range in choral music is approximately from F3 (the F below middle C) to F5 (the second F above middle C). In common usage, alto is used to describe the voice type that typically sings this part, though this is not strictly correct. Alto, like the other three standard modern choral voice classifications (soprano, tenor and bass) was originally intended to describe a part within a homophonic or polyphonic texture, rather than an individual voice type; neither are the terms alto and contralto interchangeable or synonymous, 

Although some women who sing alto in a choir are contraltos, many would be more accurately called mezzo-sopranos (a voice of somewhat higher range and different timbre). Men singing in this range are countertenors, although this term is a source of considerable controversy, some authorities preferring the usage of the term &quot;male alto&quot; for those countertenors who use a predominantly falsetto voice production (boys singing in their natural range may be termed &quot;boy altos&quot;).

<doc id="70500" wikidata="Q27914" url="?curid=70500" title="Tenor">
<text>A tenor is a type of male singing voice whose vocal range lies between the countertenor and baritone voice types. It is the highest male chest voice type. Composers typically write music for this voice in the range from the second B below middle C to the G above middle C (i.e. B2 to G4) in choral music, and from the second B flat below middle C to the C above middle C (B2 to C5) in operatic music, but the range can extend at either end. Subtypes of tenor include the &quot;leggero&quot; tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or .

== History ==
The name &quot;tenor&quot; derives from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;to hold&quot;. As noted in the &quot;Tenor&quot; article at &quot;Grove Music Online&quot;:

In polyphony between about 1250 and 1500, the [tenor was the] structurally fundamental (or &#x27;holding&#x27;) voice, vocal or instrumental; by the 15th century it came to signify the male voice that sang such parts.

All other voices were normally calculated in relation to the tenor, which often proceeded in longer note values and carried a borrowed Cantus firmus melody. Until the late 16th-century introduction of the contratenor singers, the tenor was usually the lowest voice, assuming the role of providing a foundation. It was also in the 18th century that &quot;tenor&quot; came to signify the male voice that sang such parts. Thus, for earlier repertoire, a line marked &#x27;tenor&#x27; indicated the part&#x27;s role, and not the required voice type; indeed, even as late as the eighteenth century, partbooks labelled &#x27;tenor&#x27; might contain parts for a range of voice types.

== Vocal range ==

The vocal range of the tenor is the highest of the male voice types. Within opera, the lowest note in the standard tenor repertoire is widely defined to be B2. However, the role of Rodrigo di Dhu (written for Andrea Nozzari) in Rossini&#x27;s rarely performed &quot;La donna del lago&quot; is defined as a tenor but requires an A2. Within more frequently performed repertoire, Mime and Herod both call for an A2. 

A few tenor roles in the standard repertoire call for a &quot;tenor C&quot; (C5, one octave above middle C). Some, if not all, of the few top Cs in the standard operatic repertoire are either optional—such as in &quot;Che gelida manina&quot; in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;—or interpolated (added) by tradition, such as in &quot;Di quella pira&quot; from Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il trovatore&quot;); however, the highest demanded note in the standard tenor operatic repertoire is D5, found in &quot;Mes amis, écoutez l&#x27;histoire&quot; from Adolphe Adam&#x27;s &quot;Le postillon de Lonjumeau&quot; and &quot;&quot; from Fromental Halévy&#x27;s &quot;La Juive&quot;). In the &quot;leggero&quot; repertoire, the highest note is F5 (Arturo in &quot;Credeasi, misera&quot; from Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I puritani&quot;), therefore, very few tenors have this role in their repertoire without transposition (given the raising of concert pitch since its composition), or resorting to falsetto.

== In choral music ==

In SATB four-part mixed chorus, the tenor is the second lowest vocal range, above the bass and below the alto and soprano. Men&#x27;s chorus usually denotes an ensemble of TTBB in which the first tenor is the highest voice. Whilst certain choral music does require the first tenors to ascend the full tenor range, the majority of choral music places the tenors in the range from approximately B2 up to A4. The requirements of the tenor voice in choral music are also tied to the style of music most often performed by a given choir. Orchestral choruses typically call for tenors with fully resonant voices, but chamber or a cappella choral music (choral music sung with no instrumental accompaniment) can rely on baritones singing in falsetto.

Even so, one nearly ubiquitous facet of choral singing is the shortage of tenor voices. Most men 18 and older tend to have baritone chest voices, and because of this, many men in choirs tend to prefer singing in the bass section (though true basses are even rarer than tenors). Many baritones sing tenor even if they are not able to cover the full range in only their chest voice, and sometimes contraltos sing the tenor part. In men&#x27;s choruses that consist of four male vocal parts (TTBB; tenor 1, tenor 2, bass 1, bass 2), tenors will often sing both in chest voice and falsetto, extending the vocal range of the choir.

== Subtypes and roles in opera ==
Within the tenor voice type category are seven generally recognized subcategories: &quot;leggero&quot; tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, Mozart tenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor. There is considerable overlap between the various categories of role and of voice-type; some tenor singers have begun with lyric voices but have transformed with time into spinto or even dramatic tenors.

=== Leggero ===
Also known as the &quot;tenore di grazia&quot;, the &quot;leggero&quot; tenor is essentially the male equivalent of a lyric coloratura. This voice is light, agile, and capable of executing difficult passages of fioritura. The typical &quot;leggero&quot; tenor possesses a range spanning from approximately C3 to E5, with a few being able to sing up to F5 or higher in full voice. In some cases, the chest register of the &quot;leggero&quot; tenor may extend below C3. Voices of this type are utilized frequently in the operas of Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini and in music dating from the Baroque period.

&quot;Leggero&quot; tenor roles in operas:
* Arturo, &quot;I puritani&quot; (Bellini)
* Count Almaviva, &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; (Rossini)
* Count Ory, &quot;Le comte Ory&quot; (Rossini)
* Ernesto, &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; (Donizetti)
* Elvino, &quot;La sonnambula&quot; (Bellini)
* Henry Morosus, &quot;Die schweigsame Frau&quot; (Strauss)
* Lindoro, &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot; (Rossini)
* Don Ramiro, &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; (Rossini)
* Tonio, &quot;La fille du régiment&quot; (Donizetti)


=== Lyric ===
The lyric tenor is a warm graceful voice with a bright, full timbre that is strong but not heavy and can be heard over an orchestra. Lyric tenors have a range from approximately the C one octave below middle C (C3) to the D one octave above middle C (D5). Similarly, their lower range may extend a few notes below the C3. There are many vocal shades to the lyric tenor group, repertoire should be selected according to the weight, colors, and abilities of the voice.

Gilbert Duprez (1806–1896) was a historically significant lyric tenor. He was the first tenor to sing on stage the operatic high C from the chest (&quot;ut de poitrine&quot;) as opposed to using falsettone. He is also known for originating the role of Edgardo in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;.

Lyric tenor roles in operas:
* Alessandro, &quot;Il re pastore&quot; (Mozart)
* Alfredo, &quot;La traviata&quot; (Verdi)
* Bastien, &quot;Bastien und Bastienne&quot; (Mozart)
* Belmonte, &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; (Mozart)

=== Spinto ===
The spinto tenor has the brightness and height of a lyric tenor, but with a heavier vocal weight enabling the voice to be &quot;pushed&quot; to dramatic climaxes with less strain than the lighter-voice counterparts. Spinto tenors have a darker timbre than a lyric tenor, without having a vocal color as dark as many (not all) dramatic tenors. The German equivalent of the Spinto &quot;Fach&quot; is the &#x27; and encompasses many of the Dramatic tenor roles as well as some Wagner roles such as Lohengrin and Stolzing. The difference is often the depth and metal in the voice where some lyric tenors age or push their way into singing as a Spinto giving them a lighter tone and a &#x27; tends to be either a young heldentenor or true lyric spinto. Spinto tenors have a range from approximately the C one octave below middle C (C3) to the C one octave above middle C (C5).

Spinto tenor roles in operas:
* Andrea Chénier, &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; (Giordano)
* Calaf, &quot; Turandot&quot; (Puccini)
* Des Grieux, &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; (Puccini)
* Don Carlo, &quot;Don Carlos&quot; (Verdi)
* Don José, &quot;Carmen&quot; (Bizet)
* Erik, &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; (Wagner)

* Gustavo, &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; (Verdi)
* Hermann, &quot;Queen of Spades&quot; (Tchaikovsky)

* Radames, &quot;Aida&quot; (Verdi)
* Stiffelio, &quot;Stiffelio&quot; (Verdi)
* Turiddu, &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; (Mascagni)


=== Dramatic ===
Also &quot;tenore robusto&quot;, the dramatic tenor has an emotive, ringing and very powerful, clarion, heroic tenor sound. The dramatic tenor&#x27;s approximate range is from the B one octave below middle C (B2) to the B one octave above middle C (B4) with some able to sing up to the C one octave above middle C (C5). Many successful dramatic tenors though have historically avoided the coveted high C in performance. Their lower range tends to extend into the baritone tessitura or, a few notes below the C3, even down to A♭2. Some dramatic tenors have a rich and dark tonal colour to their voice (such as the mature Enrico Caruso) while others (like Francesco Tamagno) possess a bright, steely timbre.

Dramatic tenor roles in operas:
* Canio, &quot;Pagliacci&quot; (Leoncavallo)
* Dick Johnson, &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; (Puccini)
* Don Alvaro, &quot;La forza del destino&quot; (Verdi)
* Enée, &quot;Les Troyens&quot; (Berlioz)
* Florestan, &quot;Fidelio&quot; (Beethoven)
* Otello, &quot;Otello&quot; (Verdi)
* Samson, &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; (Saint-Saëns)
* Peter Grimes, &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; (Britten)
=== Heldentenor ===

The heldentenor (English: &quot;heroic tenor&quot;) has a rich, dark, powerful and dramatic voice. As its name implies, the heldentenor vocal &quot;Fach&quot; features in the German romantic operatic repertoire. The heldentenor is the German equivalent of the tenore drammatico, however with a more baritonal quality: the typical Wagnerian protagonist. The keystone of the heldentenor&#x27;s repertoire is arguably Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Siegfried&quot;, an extremely demanding role requiring a wide vocal range and great power, plus tremendous stamina and acting ability. Often the heldentenor is a baritone who has transitioned to this &quot;Fach&quot; or tenors who have been misidentified as baritones. Therefore, the heldentenor voice might or might not have facility up to high B or C. The repertoire, however, rarely calls for such high notes.

Heldentenor roles in operas:
* Florestan, &quot;Fidelio&quot; (Beethoven)
* Tannhäuser, &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; (Wagner)
* Lohengrin, &quot;Lohengrin&quot; (Wagner)
* Siegmund, &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (Wagner)
* Siegfried, &quot;Siegfried&quot; (Wagner)
* Siegfried, &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; (Wagner)
* Walther von Stolzing, &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; (Wagner)
* Tristan, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; (Wagner)
* Parsifal, &quot;Parsifal&quot; (Wagner)
* Aegisth, &quot;Elektra&quot; (R. Strauss)
* Bacchus, &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; (R. Strauss)
* The Emperor, &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot; (R. Strauss)
* Menelaus, &quot;Die ägyptische Helena&quot; (R. Strauss)
* Apollo, &quot;Daphne&quot; (R. Strauss)
* Drum Major, &quot;Wozzeck&quot; (Berg)
* Paul, &quot;Die tote Stadt&quot; (Korngold)
* The Stranger, &quot;Das Wunder der Heliane&quot; (Korngold)
* Mao Tse-Tung, &quot;Nixon in China&quot; (Adams)
=== Tenor buffo or spieltenor ===
A Tenor buffo or spieltenor is a tenor with good acting ability, and the ability to create distinct voices for his characters. This voice specializes in smaller comic roles. The range of the tenor buffo is from the C one octave below middle C (C3) to the C one octave above middle C (C5). The tessitura of these parts ranges from lower than other tenor roles to very high and broad. These parts are often played by younger tenors who have not yet reached their full vocal potential or older tenors who are beyond their prime singing years. Only rarely will a singer specialize in these roles for an entire career. In French opéra comique, supporting roles requiring a thin voice but good acting are sometimes described as &#x27;trial&#x27;, after the singer Antoine Trial (1737–1795), examples being in the operas of Ravel and in &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;.

== Other uses ==
There are four parts in barbershop harmony: bass, baritone, lead, and tenor (lowest to highest), with &quot;tenor&quot; referring to the highest part. The tenor generally sings in falsetto voice, corresponding roughly to the countertenor in classical music, and harmonizes above the lead, who sings the melody. The barbershop tenor range is Middle C to A one octave above Middle C, though it is written an octave lower. The &quot;lead&quot; in barbershop music is equivalent to the normal tenor range.

In bluegrass music, the melody line is called the lead. Tenor is sung an interval of a third above the lead. Baritone is the fifth of the scale that has the lead as a tonic, and may be sung below the lead, or even above the lead (and the tenor), in which case it is called &quot;high baritone&quot;.

<doc id="70501" wikidata="Q244039" url="?curid=70501" title="Atlanta Thrashers">
<text>The Atlanta Thrashers were a professional ice hockey team based in Atlanta. Atlanta was granted a franchise in the National Hockey League (NHL) on June 25, 1997, and became the League&#x27;s 28th franchise when it began play in the 1999–2000 season. They were members of the Southeast Division of the NHL&#x27;s Eastern Conference, and played their home games at what is now known as State Farm Arena in downtown Atlanta. Despite several high-level draft picks and some high-profile player acquisitions, including two first-overall selections, the Thrashers were futile for the majority of their existence. They qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs only once, after winning the Southeast Division in the 2006–07 season, but were swept in the first round by the New York Rangers.

In May 2011, the Thrashers were sold to Canadian-based ownership group True North Sports &amp; Entertainment. The group moved the franchise to Winnipeg, which became the second incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets (the first incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix in 1996 to become the Coyotes). The sale and relocation were approved by the NHL on June 21, 2011. With the sale and relocation of the team, Atlanta became the first city in the NHL&#x27;s modern era to have two ice hockey teams relocate to different cities. In both cases, the team moved from Atlanta to a Western Canadian city; the city&#x27;s previous NHL team, the Atlanta Flames, moved to Calgary in 1980 to become the Calgary Flames.

==History==

After the departure of the International Hockey League (IHL)&#x27;s Atlanta Knights (1992–1996) to become the Quebec Rafales, the city of Atlanta was awarded an NHL franchise on June 25, 1997, as part of a four-team tiered expansion. This also included teams in Nashville, Columbus, and St. Paul, in which each new franchise would begin play as its respective new arena was completed. The birth of the new franchise marked NHL hockey&#x27;s return to Georgia after the Atlanta Flames, established in 1972, departed for Canada in 1980 to become the Calgary Flames. The Flames had been the League&#x27;s first foray into the southern U.S., and their failure discouraged further efforts to bring NHL hockey south of Washington for another decade.

The nickname &quot;Thrashers,&quot; after Georgia&#x27;s state bird, the brown thrasher, was selected from a fan poll. &quot;Thrashers&quot; had actually been runner-up to &quot;Flames&quot; in the poll (as an homage to the old Atlanta Flames), and Philips Arena, the Thrashers&#x27; new home, was built on the site of the former Omni, which had been home to the Flames. By coincidence, the first encampment (circa 1839) which later became Atlanta was called Thrasherville, and a historical marker of this is located just down from the arena in front of the State Bar of Georgia (the former home of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta). The team was owned by Atlanta-based media mogul Ted Turner, who also owned Major League Baseball&#x27;s Atlanta Braves and the NBA&#x27;s Atlanta Hawks.

===1999–2003: The early years===
The newly formed Thrashers selected Patrik Stefan with the first overall selection and Luke Sellars with the 30th overall pick (second pick of the second round) in the 1999 NHL entry draft. However, the entire 1999 NHL entry draft was a major disappointment for the Thrashers, as all 11 of their draft picks were out of the NHL by the team&#x27;s last season; Stefan played the most games for the Thrashers (414) from that draft. Their first two picks (Stefan and Sellars) were two of the biggest disappointments in draft history; NHL.com listed Stefan as the worst first overall pick of all time and Sellars (who played only one NHL game) as the worst 30th overall pick in NHL history. This was a surprise, as not only did the media hype Stefan as a franchise player, but hockey experts also considered then-Thrashers general manager Don Waddell to have excellent scouting ability.

The Thrashers played their first game on October 2, 1999, losing 4–1 to the New Jersey Devils. Captain Kelly Buchberger scored the franchise&#x27;s first goal in the loss and the team finished their first season in last place in the Southeast Division with 14 wins, 61 losses (including four overtime losses), and seven ties for a total of 39 points.

Atlanta had the second overall pick in the 2000 NHL entry draft; this draft brought better results, as the player chosen with that pick, Dany Heatley, became one of the team&#x27;s best players. The team also had a fine choice in the 2001 draft with first overall pick Ilya Kovalchuk. Both Heatley and Kovalchuk played their first season in the NHL in 2001–02; both were named to the NHL All-Rookie Team and Heatley was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as the League&#x27;s Rookie of the Year.

The early years of the Atlanta Thrashers saw a sharp increase of hockey fans in Atlanta. Ticket sales for Thrashers games averaged at 10,000 per night, many of them being season tickets. A section of the arena was dedicated to season ticket holders that called themselves the &quot;Nasty Nest&quot;. The &quot;Nasty Nest&quot; chanted and shouted at the opposing team to disrupt them. The Thrashers also had two Thrasher bird heads that faced opposite to the scoreboard. The Thrasher heads opened their beaks to reveal a flamethrower that ignited when the team scored a goal. At this time, the franchise adopted a motto &quot;Believe in Blueland&quot;, which was often used in advertising.

At the same time, however, the Thrashers were hamstrung by Turner&#x27;s reluctance to spend the money it took to make them competitive. According to veteran forward Ray Ferraro, who played for the Thrashers during their first three seasons, Waddell told him that Turner treated the Thrashers mostly as an afterthought; they were allocated whatever money was left over after Turner allocated payroll for the Braves and Hawks.

Marcel Comeau was named director of amateur scouting for the Thrashers, on July 9, 2003, and stayed in the role until the team was sold.

===2003–2005: The Atlanta Spirit years and the NHL lockout===
Turner stepped down as vice chairman of AOL Time Warner, parent company of Turner&#x27;s Turner Broadcasting System, in 2003. A year later, AOL Time Warner sold both teams to Atlanta Spirit, LLC, a group consisting of businessmen based both in Atlanta and elsewhere. 

It later emerged that Atlanta Spirit almost immediately put the Thrashers on the market, which only came to light after one of a myriad of lawsuits involving the consortium.

Tragedy struck the team just eight days after the sale, as star forward Dany Heatley crashed his Ferrari in a one-car accident that seriously injured both himself and Thrashers center Dan Snyder. Heatley suffered a broken jaw and arm, a sprained wrist and a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL); Snyder died five days later due to septic shock from his injuries. The Thrashers dedicated their entire 2003–04 season to Snyder&#x27;s memory, and Thrashers players wore black patches with Snyder&#x27;s number, 37, on their jerseys for the season. Heatley&#x27;s blood alcohol content was below the legal limit, but his combination of speeding (he was driving an estimated 80 miles per hour) and recklessness led to criminal charges, which were later dropped. He eventually received three years&#x27; probation and community service.

Led by captain Shawn McEachern, the Thrashers jumped quickly out of the gate with some notable highlights. Ilya Kovalchuk scored eight goals in the first seven games, including two hat-tricks, one in a 7–2 rout of the Chicago Blackhawks and another in a come-from-behind victory against the Nashville Predators. Those comeback victories became a recurring sight throughout the season, as Atlanta pulled off stunning upsets over the Toronto Maple Leafs, Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators, as well as wins against the Los Angeles Kings and New York Islanders.

Eleven games into the season, the Thrashers were in first place in the Southeast Division and the NHL. Although they continued to play well, they could not keep up with the Tampa Bay Lightning, the eventual Stanley Cup champions, or other teams in the League. Boxing Day 2003 marked both a bright and dark day for the Thrashers. On that day, Heatley skated for the first time since his car accident with Snyder, but it also marked the last win for the Thrashers before an extended losing streak. From December 28 to February 11, the team went a dismal 2–16–3. Kovalchuk became only the second Thrashers&#x27; player to score in the NHL All-Star Game (after Heatley).

While the Thrashers&#x27; playoff hopes were done for the year, they finished second in the Southeast Division to Tampa Bay and tenth in the Eastern Conference, only a handful of wins away from the Stanley Cup playoffs. Kovalchuk tied for the League lead in goals (41) with the Calgary Flames&#x27; Jarome Iginla and the Columbus Blue Jackets&#x27; Rick Nash. Goaltender Kari Lehtonen began his NHL career with four wins in four starts, including one shutout.

===2005–06: Post-lockout===
Before the start of the 2005–06 season, the Thrashers signed several NHL veterans in the hopes of making the playoffs, including forwards Bobby Holik and Scott Mellanby, defenseman Jaroslav Modry and goaltender Mike Dunham. At the same time, however, they lost one of their brightest stars, as Heatley requested a trade in an attempt to leave behind memories of his tragic 2003 car accident. He was eventually swapped to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Marian Hossa (a four-time 30-goal scorer at the time of the trade) and Greg de Vries.

The 2005–06 season saw the Thrashers win a club-record 41 games, even with numerous goaltending injuries. Only a few minutes into the first game of the season, Kari Lehtonen pulled his groin, an injury that would keep him out for a good portion of the season. Veteran backup Mike Dunham, an experienced number-one netminder, stepped in, but also promptly injured himself only a few games later; this left only prospects Michael Garnett and Adam Berkhoel to tend goal. Journeyman goaltender Steve Shields was signed, but he too was injured within ten games. On April 6, Lehtonen was run into by Tampa Bay&#x27;s Chris Dingman, injuring him yet again. The remainder of the season was left to Dunham. Garnett was injured in a game against the Washington Capitals. Dunham, who had started the game but was relieved by the young rookie after poor play, was forced back into action in the third period.

===2006–07: Brief success and only playoff appearance===
The Thrashers&#x27; 2006–07 season began with the highest expectations in franchise history, even after the team&#x27;s second-leading scorer, Marc Savard, departed as a free agent for the Boston Bruins. Veteran center Steve Rucchin, Niko Kapanen and Jon Sim were acquired in an effort to make up for the Savard loss. With NHL superstars Marian Hossa and Ilya Kovalchuk, as well as a healthy goaltender in Kari Lehtonen, the Thrashers clinched their first (and only) playoff berth, winning the Southeast Division title with 43 wins and claiming the third seed in the Conference and home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs. However, they were eliminated from the playoffs on April 18, being swept by the New York Rangers in four straight games in the conference quarterfinals.

This season was the highest attended the Thrashers ever had, with every home playoff game sold out as well as the season opening and closing games. The team was gaining notoriety within the league for their playoff debut, and team popularity within Atlanta reached an all-time high. Atlanta-based hip hop artist Lil Jon publicly showed his support for the team, posing for a picture with the Stanley Cup while wearing a Thrashers jersey. After this season, the Thrashers&#x27; ticket sales would start dwindling due to the housing market crash of 2008, and a stale economy in Atlanta. It did not help matters that the great majority of Thrashers fans lived in Atlanta&#x27;s northern suburbs, and were not willing to brave Atlanta&#x27;s infamous traffic to go to games at Philips Arena.

===2007–2010: Struggles===
Just months after reaching the playoffs for the first time, the Thrashers began the 2007–08 season 0–6. Consequently, they fired head coach Bob Hartley on October 17, 2007, with general manager Don Waddell taking over behind the bench on an interim basis. The Thrashers ended the season with only 76 points, finishing 14th in the Eastern Conference.

On January 27, 2008, the Thrashers hosted the NHL All-Star Game at Philips Arena, matching the Eastern Conference All-Stars against the Western Conference All-Stars. The game had originally been scheduled for the 2004–05 season, but the NHL lockout of that year, followed by the 2006 Winter Olympics the following season and the Dallas Stars&#x27; hosting of the 2007 NHL All-Star Game, made 2008 the earliest available date. The Eastern Conference won the game 8–7, with former Thrasher Marc Savard scoring the game winner late in the third period.

On June 20, 2008, John Anderson was named as the fourth head coach in Thrashers history. In his first season, the Thrashers matched their previous season with 76 points, while finishing 13th in the Eastern Conference. Simultaneously, Atlanta Spirit, LLC, the team&#x27;s ownership group, was coming apart at the seams. A dispute between Steve Belkin and his seven fellow owners dated back to 2005; Belkin claimed the other owners breached their contract, giving him the right to buy them out at cost, while his partners said they should be able to buy out Belkin&#x27;s 30% stake. On November 3, court proceedings began in Maryland to decide the group&#x27;s fate.

In the final year of his contract, Ilya Kovalchuk and the Thrashers could not come to an agreement on an extension. General manager Don Waddell reportedly offered 12-year, $101 million and seven-year, $70 million contracts, both of which Kovalchuk turned down. Rather than potentially losing him to free agency in the off-season, the team traded Kovalchuk on February 4, 2010, to the New Jersey Devils. Atlanta received defenseman Johnny Oduya, rookie forward Niclas Bergfors, junior prospect Patrice Cormier and a first-round pick in the 2010 NHL entry draft in exchange for Kovalchuk and defenseman Anssi Salmela; the teams also traded second-round selections in 2010. The Thrashers finished tenth in the Conference, with 83 points, which would be the most points they had earned in a regular season from the time they won the division title in 2006–07 to the team&#x27;s eventual relocation in the summer of 2011.

===2010–11: The final season in Atlanta===
On April 14, 2010, three days after the finish of the 2009–10 season and after two unsuccessful attempts at making the playoffs, the contracts of head coach John Anderson and his coaching staff were not renewed. General manager Don Waddell was promoted to president of hockey operations, while former assistant general manager Rick Dudley took Waddell&#x27;s place as general manager. This was the only general manager change in Thrashers history.

Dudley made his first trade on June 23, 2010, involving nine players and draft picks, with the Chicago Blackhawks. The Thrashers received Dustin Byfuglien, Ben Eager, Brent Sopel and Akim Aliu in exchange for Marty Reasoner, Joey Crabb, Jeremy Morin, the Devils&#x27; first-round pick (24th overall) in 2010 and the Devils&#x27; second-round pick (54th overall) in 2010. Later, the Thrashers also traded for Blackhawk Andrew Ladd while sending prospect Ivan Vishnevskiy and a draft pick to Chicago. The Blackhawks, the 2010 Stanley Cup champions, found it necessary to trade players for prospects and picks as they were in difficulty with the salary cap.

The next day, the team named Craig Ramsay as the team&#x27;s new head coach. Ramsay, who had been an assistant coach for the Boston Bruins for the previous three seasons, was a former NHL player who had been a teammate of Rick Dudley&#x27;s on the Buffalo Sabres. In the following weeks, the Thrashers hired an associate coach, John Torchetti, and an assistant coach, Mike Stothers. The team also hired Clint Malarchuk as a goaltending consultant.

The Thrashers&#x27; last win came against the New York Rangers, 3–0 at Madison Square Garden on April 7, 2011. On April 10, 2011, the Thrashers played their last game in Atlanta against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Tim Stapleton scored the last goal in Thrashers history in a 5–2 loss to Pittsburgh. The final NHL goal scored in Philips Arena was tallied by the Penguins&#x27; Mike Comrie, an empty net goal and his first of the season.

===Sale and relocation===
Due to financial losses and ownership struggles, the team was frequently a target of relocation rumors. In later years, reports saw the team courted by suitors intending to relocate to Kansas City, Quebec City, Hamilton, or Winnipeg. On January 22, 2011, the team&#x27;s ownership group claimed it had lost US$130 million in the last six years, partially as a result of an ongoing lawsuit with former partner Steve Belkin. In February 2011, majority owner Michael Gearon stated that the team would be seeking new investors. Various local groups announced their intent to purchase the franchise and keep it in Atlanta, but ultimately the team was sold to the Canadian group True North Sports &amp; Entertainment.

On May 16, the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; reported that talks for a sale to True North Sports &amp; Entertainment were underway. According to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, a deal was finalized on May 20, 2011, to relocate the team to Winnipeg. The League later denied the report, but acknowledged that advanced negotiations between the two teams were underway and that NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman supported the move. Draft schedules were prepared that accommodated for the team&#x27;s move to Winnipeg, as True North sought to move the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League (AHL), eventually moving the team to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, in Atlantic Canada, playing as the St. John&#x27;s IceCaps. However, the IceCaps were eventually moved back to Winnipeg in 2015.

On May 31, True North Sports &amp; Entertainment and the NHL held a press conference in Winnipeg to announce the completion of a deal to purchase the Thrashers. True North intended to relocate the team to the MTS Centre in Winnipeg on June 21, 2011 to become the new Winnipeg Jets. Both the sale and relocation of the team were formally approved by the NHL&#x27;s Board of Governors. The Atlanta Spirit Group, however, retained the rights of the name and logos for the Thrashers, which are expected to be used by any future Atlanta NHL franchise that may be established or move there.

As of the 2024–25 NHL season, only two former Thrashers are active in the NHL – Zach Bogosian of the Minnesota Wild and Evander Kane of the Edmonton Oilers. Ben Chiarot of the Detroit Red Wings is the only other player drafted by the Thrashers still active in the NHL, although he did not enter the league until after the Thrashers relocated to Winnipeg.

Atlanta was not without professional ice hockey for long. In 2015, the Gwinnett Gladiators of the ECHL changed their name to the Atlanta Gladiators to include the Atlanta metropolitan area. The team plays in Duluth, Georgia, located northeast of Atlanta and the Gladiators honored the Thrashers legacy on December 16, 2022, by wearing the original blue jerseys first worn in 1999 against the Greenville Swamp Rabbits, in which Greenville won 5–4 in overtime.

==Season-by-season record==
==Team information==

===Jerseys===
Throughout the team&#x27;s tenure in Atlanta, the Thrashers&#x27; wore jerseys of ice blue, navy blue, red, gold and white.

In 2003, the Thrashers unveiled an alternate home jersey. Predominantly blue, it featured a black yoke on the right shoulder with the word &#x27;ATLANTA&#x27; inside. In 2006, it became the team&#x27;s full-time home jersey, replacing the original navy blue jersey that had been worn since the club&#x27;s inception in 1999.

In 2007, Reebok released new team jerseys as part of the rollout of the Reebok Edge Uniform System. For the Thrashers&#x27; jerseys, the waist stripes were removed from the home and road jerseys and piping was added.

Atlanta unveiled its new third jersey, red and midnight blue with white and gold trim, on October 10, 2008. It is often mocked as one of the worst uniforms in league history.

On November 7, 2022, the Thrashers&#x27; former ECHL affiliate, the Atlanta Gladiators, unveiled plans to take on the identity of the Thrashers for a single game on December 16.

===Mascot===
The team&#x27;s mascot was Thrash, a brown thrasher, which also is the official state bird of Georgia.

<doc id="70502" wikidata="Q31687" url="?curid=70502" title="Baritone">
<text>A baritone is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range lies between the bass and the tenor voice-types. It is the most common male voice. The term originates from the Greek (), meaning &quot;heavy sounding&quot;. Composers typically write music for this voice in the range from the second F below middle C to the F above middle C (i.e. F2–F4) in choral music, and from the second G below middle C to the G above middle C (G2 to G4) in operatic music, but the range can extend at either end. Subtypes of baritone include the baryton-Martin baritone (light baritone), lyric baritone, &quot;Kavalierbariton&quot;, Verdi baritone, dramatic baritone, &quot;baryton-noble&quot; baritone, and the bass-baritone.

== History ==
The first use of the term &quot;baritone&quot; emerged as &quot;baritonans&quot;, late in the 15th century, usually in French sacred polyphonic music. At this early stage it was frequently used as the lowest of the voices (including the bass), but in 17th-century Italy the term was all-encompassing and used to describe the average male choral voice.

Baritones took roughly the range as it is known today at the beginning of the 18th century, but they were still lumped in with their bass colleagues until well into the 19th century. Many operatic works of the 18th century have roles marked as bass that in reality are low baritone roles (or bass-baritone parts in modern parlance). Examples of this are to be found, for instance, in the operas and oratorios of George Frideric Handel. The greatest and most enduring parts for baritones in 18th-century operatic music were composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. They include Count Almaviva in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, Guglielmo in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, Papageno in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;.

=== 19th century ===
In theatrical documents, cast lists, and journalistic dispatches that from the beginning of the 19th century till the mid-1820s, the terms &quot;primo basso&quot;, &quot;basse chantante&quot;, and &quot;basse-taille&quot; were often used for men who would later be called baritones. These included the likes of Filippo Galli, Giovanni Inchindi, and Henri-Bernard Dabadie. The basse-taille and the proper bass were commonly confused because their roles were sometimes sung by singers of either actual voice part.

The bel canto style of vocalism which arose in Italy in the early 19th century supplanted the castrato-dominated &quot;opera seria&quot; of the previous century. It led to the baritone being viewed as a separate voice category from the bass. Traditionally, basses in operas had been cast as authority figures such as a king or high priest; but with the advent of the more fluid baritone voice, the roles allotted by composers to lower male voices expanded in the direction of trusted companions or even romantic leads—normally the province of tenors. More often than not, however, baritones found themselves portraying villains.

The principal composers of bel canto opera are considered to be:
*Gioachino Rossini (&quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, &quot;William Tell&quot;);
* Gaetano Donizetti (&quot;Don Pasquale&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;, &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot;, &quot;La favorite&quot;);
*Vincenzo Bellini (&quot;I puritani&quot;, &quot;Norma&quot;);
*Giacomo Meyerbeer (&quot;Les Huguenots&quot;); and
* the young Giuseppe Verdi (&quot;Nabucco&quot;, &quot;Ernani&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, &quot;La traviata&quot;, &quot;Il trovatore&quot;).
The prolific operas of these composers, plus the works of Verdi&#x27;s maturity, such as &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;, &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, &quot;Don Carlos&quot;/&quot;Don Carlo&quot;, the revised &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;, &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;Otello&quot; and &quot;Falstaff&quot;, blazed many new and rewarding performance pathways for baritones.
Figaro in &quot;Il barbiere&quot; is often called the first true baritone role. However, Donizetti and Verdi in their vocal writing went on to emphasize the top fifth of the baritone voice, rather than its lower notes—thus generating a more brilliant sound. Further pathways opened up when the musically complex and physically demanding operas of Richard Wagner began to enter the mainstream repertory of the world&#x27;s opera houses during the second half of the 19th century.

The major international baritone of the first half of the 19th century was the Italian Antonio Tamburini (1800–1876). He was a famous Don Giovanni in Mozart&#x27;s eponymous opera as well as being a Bellini and Donizetti specialist. Commentators praised his voice for its beauty, flexibility and smooth tonal emission, which are the hallmarks of a bel canto singer. Tamburini&#x27;s range, however, was probably closer to that of a bass-baritone than to that of a modern &quot;Verdi baritone&quot;. His French equivalent was Henri-Bernard Dabadie, who was a mainstay of the Paris Opera between 1819 and 1836 and the creator of several major Rossinian baritone roles, including Guillaume Tell. Dabadie sang in Italy, too, where he originated the role of Belcore in &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; in 1832.

The most important of Tamburini&#x27;s Italianate successors were all Verdians. They included:
*Giorgio Ronconi, who created the title role in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Nabucco&quot;
*Felice Varesi, who created the title roles in &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Rigoletto&quot; as well as Germont in &quot;La traviata&quot;
*Antonio Superchi, the originator of Don Carlo in &quot;Ernani&quot;
*Francesco Graziani, who was the original Don Carlo di Vargas in &quot;La forza del destino&quot;
*Leone Giraldoni, the creator of Renato in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; and the first Simon Boccanegra
*Enrico Delle Sedie, who was London&#x27;s first Renato
*, whose singing at La Scala during the 1870s was praised by Verdi
*Antonio Cotogni, a much lauded singer in Milan, London and Saint Petersburg, the first Italian Posa in &quot;Don Carlos&quot; and later a great vocal pedagogue, too
*Filippo Coletti, creator of Verdi&#x27;s Gusmano in &quot;Alzira&quot;, Francesco in &quot;I masnadieri&quot;, Germont in the second version of &quot;La traviata&quot; and for whom Verdi considered writing the (unrealized) opera &quot;Lear&quot;
*Giuseppe Del Puente, who sang Verdi to acclaim in the United States

Among the non-Italian born baritones that were active in the third quarter of the 19th century, Tamburini&#x27;s mantle as an outstanding exponent of Mozart and Donizetti&#x27;s music was probably taken up most faithfully by a Belgian, Camille Everardi, who later settled in Russia and taught voice. In France, Paul Barroilhet succeeded Dabadie as the Paris opera&#x27;s best known baritone. Like Dabadie, he also sang in Italy and created an important Donizetti role: in his case, Alphonse in &quot;La favorite&quot; (in 1840).

Luckily, the gramophone was invented early enough to capture on disc the voices of the top Italian Verdi and Donizetti baritones of the last two decades of the 19th century, whose operatic performances were characterized by considerable re-creative freedom and a high degree of technical finish. They included Mattia Battistini (known as the &quot;King of Baritones&quot;), Giuseppe Kaschmann (born Josip Kašman) who, atypically, sang Wagner&#x27;s Telramund and Amfortas not in Italian but in German, at the Bayreuth Festival in the 1890s; Giuseppe Campanari; Antonio Magini-Coletti; Mario Ancona (chosen to be the first Silvio in &quot;Pagliacci&quot;); and Antonio Scotti, who came to the Met from Europe in 1899 and remained on the roster of singers until 1933. Antonio Pini-Corsi was the standout Italian &quot;&quot; baritone in the period between about 1880 and World War I, reveling in comic opera roles by Rossini, Donizetti and Paer, among others. In 1893, he created the part of Ford in Verdi&#x27;s last opera, &quot;Falstaff&quot;.

Notable among their contemporaries were the cultured and technically adroit French baritones Jean Lassalle (hailed as the most accomplished baritone of his generation), Victor Maurel (the creator of Verdi&#x27;s Iago, Falstaff and Tonio in Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot;), Paul Lhérie (the first Posa in the revised, Italian-language version of &quot;Don Carlos&quot;), and Maurice Renaud (a singing actor of the first magnitude). Lassalle, Maurel and Renaud enjoyed superlative careers on either side of the Atlantic and left a valuable legacy of recordings. Five other significant Francophone baritones who recorded, too, during the early days of the gramophone/phonograph were Léon Melchissédec and Jean Noté of the Paris Opera and Gabriel Soulacroix, Henry Albers and Charles Gilibert of the Opéra-Comique. The Quaker baritone David Bispham, who sang in London and New York between 1891 and 1903, was the leading American male singer of this generation. He also recorded for the gramophone.

The oldest-born star baritone known for sure to have made solo gramophone discs was the Englishman Sir Charles Santley (1834–1922). Santley made his operatic debut in Italy in 1858 and became one of Covent Garden&#x27;s leading singers. He was still giving critically acclaimed concerts in London in the 1890s. The composer of &quot;Faust&quot;, Charles Gounod, wrote Valentine&#x27;s aria &quot;Even bravest heart&quot; for him at his request for the London production in 1864 so that the leading baritone would have an aria. A couple of primitive cylinder recordings dating from about 1900 have been attributed by collectors to the dominant French baritone of the 1860s and 1870s, Jean-Baptiste Faure (1830–1914), the creator of Posa in Verdi&#x27;s original French-language version of &quot;Don Carlos&quot;. It is doubtful, however, that Faure (who retired in 1886) made the cylinders. However, a contemporary of Faure&#x27;s, Antonio Cotogni, (1831–1918)—probably the foremost Italian baritone of his generation—can be heard, briefly and dimly, at the age of 77, on a duet recording with the tenor Francesco Marconi. (Cotogni and Marconi had sung together in the first London performance of Amilcare Ponchielli&#x27;s &quot;La Gioconda&quot; in 1883, performing the roles of Barnaba and Enzo respectively.)

== Subtypes ==
There are 19th-century references in the musical literature to certain baritone subtypes. These include the light and tenorish baryton-Martin, named after French singer Jean-Blaise Martin (1768/69–1837), and the deeper, more powerful Heldenbariton (today&#x27;s bass-baritone) of Wagnerian opera.

Perhaps the most accomplished &quot;Heldenbaritons&quot; of Wagner&#x27;s day were August Kindermann, Franz Betz and Theodor Reichmann. Betz created Hans Sachs in &quot;Die Meistersinger &quot;and undertook Wotan in the first &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; cycle at Bayreuth, while Reichmann created Amfortas in &quot;Parsifal&quot;, also at Bayreuth. Lyric German baritones sang lighter Wagnerian roles such as Wolfram in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, Kurwenal in &quot;Tristan und Isolde &quot;or Telramund in &quot;Lohengrin&quot;. They made large strides, too, in the performance of art song and oratorio, with Franz Schubert favouring several baritones for his vocal music, in particular Johann Michael Vogl.

Nineteenth-century operettas became the preserve of lightweight baritone voices. They were given comic parts in the tradition of the previous century&#x27;s comic bass by Gilbert and Sullivan in many of their productions. This did not prevent the French master of operetta, Jacques Offenbach, from assigning the villain&#x27;s role in &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann &quot;to a big-voiced baritone for the sake of dramatic effect. Other 19th-century French composers like Meyerbeer, Hector Berlioz, Camille Saint-Saëns, Georges Bizet and Jules Massenet wrote attractive parts for baritones, too. These included Nelusko in &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot; (Meyerbeer&#x27;s last opera), Mephistopheles in &quot;La damnation de Faust &quot;(a role also sung by basses), the Priest of Dagon in &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;, Escamillo in &quot;Carmen&quot;, Zurga in &quot;Les pêcheurs de perles&quot;, Lescaut in &quot;Manon&quot;, Athanael in &quot;Thaïs &quot;and Herod in &quot;Hérodiade&quot;. Russian composers included substantial baritone parts in their operas. Witness the title roles in Peter Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin &quot;(which received its first production in 1879) and Alexander Borodin&#x27;s &quot;Prince Igor &quot;(1890).

Mozart continued to be sung throughout the 19th century although, generally speaking, his operas were not revered to the same extent that they are today by music critics and audiences. Back then, baritones rather than high basses normally sang Don Giovanni – arguably Mozart&#x27;s greatest male operatic creation. Famous Dons of the late 19th and early 20th centuries included Scotti and Maurel, as well as Portugal&#x27;s Francisco D&#x27;Andrade and Sweden&#x27;s John Forsell.

The verismo baritone, Verdi baritone, and other subtypes are mentioned below, though not necessarily in 19th-century context.

=== 20th century ===
The dawn of the 20th century opened up more opportunities for baritones than ever before as a taste for strenuously exciting vocalism and lurid, &quot;slice-of-life&quot; operatic plots took hold in Italy and spread elsewhere. The most prominent verismo baritones included such major singers in Europe and America as the polished Giuseppe De Luca (the first Sharpless in &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;), Mario Sammarco (the first Gerard in &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;), Eugenio Giraldoni (the first Scarpia in &quot;Tosca&quot;), Pasquale Amato (the first Rance in &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot;), Riccardo Stracciari (noted for his richly attractive timbre) and Domenico Viglione Borghese, whose voice was exceeded in size only by that of the lion-voiced Titta Ruffo. Ruffo was the most commanding Italian baritone of his era or, arguably, any other era. He was at his prime from the early 1900s to the early 1920s and enjoyed success in Italy, England and America (in Chicago and later at the Met).

The chief verismo composers were Giacomo Puccini, Ruggero Leoncavallo, Pietro Mascagni, Alberto Franchetti, Umberto Giordano and Francesco Cilea. Verdi&#x27;s works continued to remain popular, however, with audiences in Italy, the Spanish-speaking countries, the United States and the United Kingdom, and in Germany, where there was a major Verdi revival in Berlin between the wars.

Outside the field of Italian opera, an important addition to the Austro-German repertory occurred in 1905. This was the premiere of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot;, with the pivotal part of John the Baptist assigned to a baritone. (The enormous-voiced Dutch baritone Anton van Rooy, a Wagner specialist, sang John when the opera reached the Met in 1907). Then, in 1925, Germany&#x27;s Leo Schützendorf created the title baritone role in Alban Berg&#x27;s harrowing &quot;Wozzeck&quot;. In a separate development, the French composer Claude Debussy&#x27;s post-Wagnerian masterpiece &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; featured not one but two lead baritones at its 1902 premiere. These two baritones, Jean Périer and Hector Dufranne, possessed contrasting voices. (Dufranne – sometimes classed as a bass-baritone – had a darker, more powerful instrument than did Périer, who was a true baryton-Martin.)

Characteristic of the Wagnerian baritones of the 20th century was a general progression of individual singers from higher-lying baritone parts to lower-pitched ones. This was the case with Germany&#x27;s Hans Hotter. Hotter made his debut in 1929. As a young singer he appeared in Verdi and created the Commandant in Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Friedenstag &quot;and Olivier in &quot;Capriccio&quot;. By the 1950s, however, he was being hailed as the top Wagnerian bass-baritone in the world. His Wotan was especially praised by critics for its musicianship. Other major Wagnerian baritones have included Hotter&#x27;s predecessors Leopold Demuth, Anton van Rooy, Hermann Weil, Clarence Whitehill, Friedrich Schorr, Rudolf Bockelmann and Hans-Hermann Nissen. Demuth, van Rooy, Weil and Whitehill were at their peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries while Schorr, Bockelmann and Nissen were stars of the 1920s and 1930s.

In addition to their heavyweight Wagnerian cousins, there was a plethora of baritones with more lyrical voices active in Germany and Austria during the period between the outbreak of WW1 in 1914 and the end of WW2 in 1945. Among them were , Heinrich Schlusnus, Herbert Janssen, Willi Domgraf-Fassbaender, Karl Schmitt-Walter and Gerhard Hüsch. Their abundant inter-war Italian counterparts included, among others, Carlo Galeffi, Giuseppe Danise, Enrico Molinari, Umberto Urbano, Cesare Formichi, Luigi Montesanto, Apollo Granforte, Benvenuto Franci, Renato Zanelli (who switched to tenor roles in 1924), Mario Basiola, Giovanni Inghilleri, Carlo Morelli (the Chilean-born younger brother of Renato Zanelli) and Carlo Tagliabue, who retired as late as 1958.

One of the best known Italian Verdi baritones of the 1920s and 1930s, Mariano Stabile, sang Iago and Rigoletto and Falstaff (at La Scala) under the baton of Arturo Toscanini. Stabile also appeared in London, Chicago and Salzburg. He was noted more for his histrionic skills than for his voice, however. Stabile was followed by Tito Gobbi, a versatile singing actor capable of vivid comic and tragic performances during the years of his prime in the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s. He learned more than 100 roles in his lifetime and was mostly known for his roles in Verdi and Puccini operas, including appearances as Scarpia opposite soprano Maria Callas as Tosca at Covent Garden.

Gobbi&#x27;s competitors included Gino Bechi, Giuseppe Valdengo, Paolo Silveri, Giuseppe Taddei, Ettore Bastianini, Cesare Bardelli and Giangiacomo Guelfi. Another of Gobbi&#x27;s contemporaries was the Welshman Geraint Evans, who famously sang Falstaff at Glyndebourne and created the roles of Mr. Flint and Mountjoy in works by Benjamin Britten. Some considered his best role to have been Wozzeck. The next significant Welsh baritone was Bryn Terfel. He made his premiere at Glyndebourne in 1990 and went on to build an international career as Falstaff and, more generally, in the operas of Mozart and Wagner.

Perhaps the first famous American baritone appeared in the 1900s. It was the American-born but Paris-based Charles W. Clark who sang Italian, French and German composers. An outstanding group of virile-voiced American baritones appeared then in the 1920s. The younger members of this group were still active as recently as the late 1970s. Outstanding among its members were the Met-based Verdians Lawrence Tibbett (a compelling, rich-voiced singing actor), Richard Bonelli, John Charles Thomas, Robert Weede, Leonard Warren and Robert Merrill. They sang French opera, too, as did the American-born but also Paris-based baritone of the 1920s, and 1930s Arthur Endreze.

Also to be found singing Verdi roles at the Met, Covent Garden and the Vienna Opera during the late 1930s and the 1940s was the big-voiced Hungarian baritone, Sandor (Alexander) Sved.

The leading Verdi baritones of the 1970s and 1980s were probably Italy&#x27;s Renato Bruson and Piero Cappuccilli, America&#x27;s Sherrill Milnes, Sweden&#x27;s Ingvar Wixell and the Romanian baritone Nicolae Herlea. At the same time, Britain&#x27;s Sir Thomas Allen was considered to be the most versatile baritone of his generation in regards to repertoire, which ranged from Mozart to Verdi and lighter Wagner roles, through French and Russian opera, to modern English music. Another British baritone, Norman Bailey, established himself internationally as a memorable Wotan and Hans Sachs. However, he had a distinguished, brighter-voiced Wagnerian rival during the 1960s, 70s, and 80s in the person of Thomas Stewart of America. Other notable post-War Wagnerian baritones have been Canada&#x27;s George London, Germany&#x27;s Hermann Uhde and, more recently, America&#x27;s James Morris.

Among the late-20th-century baritones noted throughout the opera world for their Verdi performances was Vladimir Chernov, who emerged from the former USSR to sing at the Met. Chernov followed in the footsteps of such richly endowed East European baritones as Ippolit Pryanishnikov (a favorite of Tchaikovski&#x27;s), Joachim Tartakov (an Everardi pupil), Oskar Kamionsky (an exceptional &quot;bel canto&quot; singer nicknamed the &quot;Russian Battistini&quot;), Waclaw Brzezinski (known as the &quot;Polish Battistini&quot;), Georges Baklanoff (a powerful singing actor), and, during a career lasting from 1935 to 1966, the Bolshoi&#x27;s Pavel Lisitsian. Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Sergei Leiferkus are two Russian baritones of the modern era who appear regularly in the West. Like Lisitsian, they sing Verdi and the works of their native composers, including Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; and &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;.

In the realm of French song, the bass-baritone José van Dam and the lighter-voiced Gérard Souzay have been notable. Souzay&#x27;s repertoire extended from the Baroque works of Jean-Baptiste Lully to 20th-century composers such as Francis Poulenc. Pierre Bernac, Souzay&#x27;s teacher, was an interpreter of Poulenc&#x27;s songs in the previous generation. Older baritones identified with this style include France&#x27;s Dinh Gilly and Charles Panzéra and Australia&#x27;s John Brownlee. Another Australian, Peter Dawson, made a small but precious legacy of benchmark Handel recordings during the 1920s and 1930s. (Dawson, incidentally, acquired his outstanding Handelian technique from Sir Charles Santley.) Yet another Australian baritone of distinction between the wars was Harold Williams, who was based in the United Kingdom. Important British-born baritones of the 1930s and 1940s were Dennis Noble, who sang Italian and English operatic roles, and the Mozartian Roy Henderson. Both appeared often at Covent Garden.

Prior to World War II, Germany&#x27;s Heinrich Schlusnus, Gerhard Hüsch and Herbert Janssen were celebrated for their beautifully sung lieder recitals as well as for their mellifluous operatic performances in Verdi, Mozart, and Wagner respectively. After the war&#x27;s conclusion, Hermann Prey and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau appeared on the scene to take their place. In addition to his interpretations of lieder and the works of Mozart, Prey sang in Strauss operas and tackled lighter Wagner roles such as Wolfram or Beckmesser. Fischer-Dieskau sang parts in &#x27;fringe&#x27; operas by the likes of Ferruccio Busoni and Paul Hindemith as well as appearing in standard works by Verdi and Wagner. He earned his principal renown, however, as a lieder singer. Talented German and Austrian lieder singers of a younger generation include Olaf Bär, Matthias Goerne, Wolfgang Holzmair and Johannes Sterkel (which are also performing or have performed regularly in opera), Thomas Quasthoff, and Christian Gerhaher. Well-known non-Germanic baritones of recent times have included the Italians Giorgio Zancanaro and Leo Nucci, the Frenchman François le Roux, the Canadians Gerald Finley and James Westman and the versatile American Thomas Hampson, his compatriot Nathan Gunn and the Englishman Simon Keenlyside.

== Vocal range ==
The vocal range of the baritone lies between the bass and the tenor voice types. The baritone vocal range is usually between the second G below middle C (G) and the G above middle C (G). Composers typically write music for this voice in the range from the second F below middle C to the F above middle C (i.e. F2–F4) in choral music, and from the second A below middle C to the A above middle C (A2 to A4) in operatic music.

== Subtypes and roles in opera ==
Within the baritone voice type category are seven generally recognized subcategories: baryton-Martin baritone (light baritone), lyric baritone, &quot;Kavalierbariton&quot;, Verdi baritone, dramatic baritone, &quot;baryton-noble&quot; baritone, and the bass-baritone.

=== Baryton-Martin ===
The baryton-Martin baritone (sometimes referred to as light baritone) lacks the lower G2–B2 range a heavier baritone is capable of, and has a lighter, almost tenor-like quality. Its common range is from C3 to the B above middle C (C3 to B4). Generally seen only in French repertoire, this &quot;Fach&quot; was named after the French singer Jean-Blaise Martin. Associated with the rise of the baritone in the 19th century, Martin was well known for his fondness for falsetto singing, and the designation &#x27;baryton Martin&#x27; has been used (Faure, 1886) to separate his voice from the &#x27;Verdi Baritone&#x27;, which carried the chest register further into the upper range. This voice type shares the &quot;primo passaggio&quot; and &quot;secondo passaggio&quot; with the Dramatic Tenor and Heldentenor (C4 and F4 respectively), and hence could be trained as a tenor.

Baryton-Martin roles in opera:
*Aeneas, &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; (Purcell)
*Dancaїre, &quot;Carmen&quot; (Bizet)
*L&#x27;horloge comtoise, &quot;L&#x27;enfant et les sortilèges&quot; (Ravel)
*Orfeo, &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; (Monteverdi)
*Pelléas, &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; (Debussy)
*Ramiro, &quot;L&#x27;heure espagnole&quot; (Ravel)

=== Lyric ===
The lyric baritone is a sweeter, milder sounding baritone voice, lacking in harshness; lighter and perhaps mellower than the dramatic baritone with a higher tessitura. Its common range is from the A below C3 to the G above middle C (A2 to G4). It is typically assigned to comic roles.

Lyric baritone roles in opera:

*Count Almaviva, &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (Mozart)
*Guglielmo, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (Mozart)
*Papageno, &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (Mozart)
*Dr Malatesta &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; (Donizetti)
*Prospero, &quot;The Tempest&quot; (Adès)
*Marcello, &quot;La bohème&quot; (Puccini)
*Figaro, &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; (Rossini)
*Morales, &quot;Carmen&quot; (Bizet)
*Top, &quot;The Tender Land&quot; (Copland)
=== &quot;Kavalierbariton&quot; ===
The &quot;Kavalierbariton&quot; baritone is a metallic voice that can sing both lyric and dramatic phrases, a manly, noble baritonal color. Its common range is from the A below low C to the G above middle C (A2 to G4). Not quite as powerful as the Verdi baritone who is expected to have a powerful appearance on stage, perhaps muscular or physically large.

&quot;Kavalierbariton&quot; roles in opera:
*Don Giovanni, &quot;Don Giovanni &quot;(Mozart)
*Count, &quot;Capriccio&quot; (R. Strauss)
*Giorgio Germont, &quot;La traviata &quot;(Verdi)
*Zurga, &quot;Les pêcheurs de perles&quot; (Bizet)

=== Verdi ===
The Verdi baritone is a more specialized voice category and a subset of the Dramatic Baritone. Its common range is from the G below low C to the B above middle C (G2 to B4). A Verdi baritone refers to a voice capable of singing consistently and with ease in the highest part of the baritone range. It will generally have a lot of squillo.
Verdi baritone roles in opera:

* Amonasro, &quot;Aida&quot;
* Conte di Luna, &quot;Il trovatore&quot;
* Don Carlo, &quot;Ernani&quot;
* Don Carlo di Vargas, &quot;La forza del destino&quot;
* Falstaff, &quot;Falstaff&quot;
* Ford, &quot;Falstaff&quot;
* Germont, &quot;La traviata&quot;
* Iago, &quot;Otello&quot;
* Macbeth, &quot;Macbeth&quot;
* Nabucco, &quot;Nabucco&quot;
* Renato, &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;
* Rigoletto, &quot;Rigoletto&quot;
* Rodrigo, &quot;Don Carlos&quot;
* Simon Boccanegra, &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;
=== Dramatic ===
The dramatic baritone is a voice that is richer, fuller, and sometimes harsher than a lyric baritone and with a darker quality. Its common range is from the G half an octave below low C to the G above middle C (G2 to G4). The dramatic baritone category corresponds roughly to the Heldenbariton in the German &quot;Fach&quot; system except that some Verdi baritone roles are not included. The primo passaggio and secondo passaggio of both the Verdi and dramatic baritone are at B and E respectively, hence the differentiation is based more heavily on timbre and tessitura. Accordingly, roles that fall into this category tend to have a slightly lower tessitura than typical Verdi baritone roles, only rising above an F at the moments of greatest intensity. Many of the Puccini roles fall into this category. However, it is important to note that, for all intents and purposes, a Verdi Baritone is simply a Dramatic Baritone with greater ease in the upper tessitura (Verdi Baritone roles center approximately a minor third higher). Because the Verdi Baritone is sometimes seen as a subset of the Dramatic Baritone, some singers perform roles from both sets of repertoire. Similarly, the lower tessitura of these roles allows them frequently to be sung by bass-baritones.

Dramatic baritone roles in opera:
*Jack Rance, &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; (Puccini)
*Scarpia, &quot;Tosca&quot; (Puccini)
*Iago, &quot;Otello &quot;(Verdi)
*Escamillo, &quot;Carmen&quot; (Bizet)

=== &quot;Baryton-noble&quot; ===
The &quot;baryton-noble&quot; baritone is French for &quot;noble baritone&quot; and describes a part that requires a noble bearing, smooth vocalisation and forceful declamation, all in perfect balance. This category originated in the Paris Opera, but it greatly influenced Verdi (Don Carlo in &quot;Ernani &quot;and &quot;La forza del destino&quot;; Count Luna in &quot;Il trovatore&quot;; &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;) and Wagner as well (&quot;Wotan&quot;; &quot;Amfortas&quot;). Similar to the Kavalierbariton.

&quot;Baryton-noble&quot; roles in opera are:

* Aleko, &quot;Aleko&quot;
* Alberich, &quot;Siegfried&quot;
* Albert, &quot;Werther&quot;
* Alfio, &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;
* Amfortas, &quot;Parsifal&quot;
* Amonasro, &quot;Aida&quot;
* Ascanio Petrucci, &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot;
* Athanaël, &quot;Thaïs&quot;
* Barnaba, &quot;La Gioconda&quot;

=== Baritone in popular music ===
In barbershop music, the baritone part sings in a similar range to the lead (singing the melody) however usually singing lower than the lead. A barbershop baritone has a specific and specialized role in the formation of the four-part harmony that characterizes the style.

The baritone singer is often the one required to support or &quot;fill&quot; the bass sound (typically by singing the fifth above the bass root) and to complete a chord. On the other hand, the baritone will occasionally find himself harmonizing above the melody, which calls for a tenor-like quality. Because the baritone fills the chord, the part is often not very melodic.

In bluegrass music, the melody line is called the lead. Tenor is sung an interval of a third above the lead. Baritone is the fifth of the scale that has the lead as a tonic, and may be sung below the lead, or even above the lead (and the tenor), in which case it is called &quot;high baritone&quot;. Conversely, the more &quot;soul&quot; baritones have the more traditional timbre, but sing in a vocal range that is closer to the tenor vocal range. Some of these singers include David Ruffin, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Tom Jones, Michael McDonald, and Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops.

<text>Elizabeth R. Schwartz (née Robinson; August 23, 1911 – May 18, 1999) was an American athlete and winner of the first Olympic 100 metres for women.

==Early life==
Robinson was born in Riverdale, Illinois. She was a student at Thornton Township High School when she achieved national acclaim as an Olympic champion.

Her talent was discovered by her science teacher Charles Price, who saw her running to catch the train after school. He was a former athlete and the coach of the school team.

==Athletics==
Robinson ran her first official race on March 30, 1928, at the age of 16, at an indoor meet where she finished second to Helen Filkey, the US record holder at 100 m, in the 60-yard dash. At her next race on June 2, outdoors at 100 meters, she beat Filkey and equalled the world record, though her time was not recognized because it was deemed wind-aided.

At the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics, her third 100 m competition, Robinson was the only US athlete to qualify for the 100 m final. She reached the final and won, equaling the world record of 12.2 seconds. She was the inaugural Olympic champion in the event, since athletics for women had not been on the program before, and its inclusion was in fact still heavily disputed among officials. She remains the youngest athlete to win Olympic 100 m gold. With the American 4×100 metres relay team, Robinson added a silver medal to her record.

Six decades later, Robinson was interviewed for a book, &quot;Tales of Glory: An Oral History of the Summer Olympic Games Told By America&#x27;s Gold Medal Winners&quot;, by Lewis H. Carlson and John J Fogarty. This is how she remembered the 100 m race:
&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reporter William L Shirer wrote that &#x27;an unheralded, pretty, blue-eyed blond young woman from Chicago became the darling of the spectators when she flew down the cinder path, her golden locks flying, to win&#x27;.

She joined Northwestern University where she decided to pursue a physical education degree, hoping to become a coach at the 1936 Olympics. Robinson joined the rifle team at Northwestern in addition to running track there. She was also a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma.

On 28 June 1931, Robinson was involved in a plane crash and was severely injured. Initial reports had her being discovered unconscious in the wreckage and wrongly thought dead by her rescuer; in fact, he merely thought she was beyond saving. He took her to Oak Forest infirmary, locally known as the &quot;Poor Farm&quot;, because he knew the undertaker. Doctors determined she had suffered severe multiple injuries and she would never race again. It was another six months before she could get out of a wheelchair, and two years before she could walk normally again. Meanwhile, she missed the 1932 Summer Olympics in her home country.

Still unable to kneel for a normal 100 m start due to the fractures and surgeries on her left leg, Robinson was a part of the US team of 4 × 100 metres relay at the 1936 Summer Olympics. The US team was running behind the heavily favored Germans, but the Germans dropped their baton. Robinson took the lead and handed off the baton to Helen Stephens, resulting in her second Olympic gold medal.

==After athletic career==
Retiring after the Berlin Olympics, Robinson remained involved in athletics as an official. She worked in a hardware store for many years. In 1977, she was inducted into the USA National Track and Field Hall of Fame. In 1996, she carried the Olympic Torch for the Atlanta Olympic Games.

==Personal life==
She married and had two children. The family resided in Glencoe, Illinois, a suburb on Chicago&#x27;s North Shore.

She died at age 87, suffering from cancer and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<doc id="70506" wikidata="Q8058" url="?curid=70506" title="Louis XI">
<text>Louis XI (3 July 1423 – 30 August 1483), called &quot;Louis the Prudent&quot; (), was King of France from 1461 to 1483. He succeeded his father, Charles VII. Louis entered into open rebellion against his father in a short-lived revolt known as the Praguerie in 1440. The king forgave his rebellious vassals, including Louis, to whom he entrusted the management of the Dauphiné, then a province in southeastern France. Louis&#x27;s ceaseless intrigues, however, led his father to banish him from court. From the Dauphiné, Louis led his own political establishment and married Charlotte of Savoy, daughter of Louis, Duke of Savoy, against the will of his father. Charles VII sent an army to compel his son to his will, but Louis fled to Burgundy, where he was hosted by Philip the Good, the Duke of Burgundy, Charles&#x27;s greatest enemy.

When Charles VII died in 1461, Louis left the Burgundian court to take possession of his kingdom. His taste for intrigue and his intense diplomatic activity earned him the nicknames &quot;the Cunning&quot; () and &quot;the Universal Spider&quot; (), as his enemies accused him of spinning webs of plots and conspiracies.

In 1472, the subsequent Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, took up arms against his rival Louis. However, Louis was able to isolate Charles from his English allies by signing the Treaty of Picquigny (1475) with Edward IV of England. The treaty formally ended the Hundred Years&#x27; War. With the death of Charles the Bold at the Battle of Nancy in 1477, the dynasty of the dukes of Burgundy died out. Louis took advantage of the situation to seize numerous Burgundian territories, including Burgundy itself and Picardy.

Without direct foreign threats, Louis was able to eliminate his rebellious vassals, expand royal power, and strengthen the economic development of his country. He died in 1483, and was succeeded by his minor son Charles VIII.

==Childhood==
Louis was born in Bourges on 3 July 1423, the son of King Charles VII of France and Marie of Anjou. At the time of the Hundred Years War, the English held northern France, including the city of Paris, and Charles VII was restricted to the centre and south of the country. Louis was the grandson of Yolande of Aragon, who was a force in the royal family for driving the English out of France, which was at a low point in its struggles. Just a few weeks after Louis&#x27;s christening at the Cathedral of St. Étienne on 4 July 1423, the French army suffered a crushing defeat by the English at Cravant. Shortly thereafter, a combined Anglo-Burgundian army briefly raided Bourges itself.

During the reign of Louis&#x27;s grandfather Charles VI (1380–1422), the Duchy of Burgundy was very much connected with the French throne, but because the central government lacked any real power, all the duchies of France tended to act independently. In its position of independence from the French throne, Burgundy had grown in size and power. By the reign of Louis&#x27;s father Charles VII, Philip the Good was reigning as duke of Burgundy, and the duchy had expanded its borders to include all the territory in France from the North Sea in the north to the Jura Mountains in the south and from the Somme River in the west to the Moselle River in the east. During the Hundred Years War, the Burgundians allied themselves with England against the French crown.

In 1429, young Louis found himself at Loches in the presence of Joan of Arc, fresh from her first victory over the English at the Siege of Orléans, which initiated a turning point for the French in the Hundred Years War. Joan later led troops in other victories at the Battle of Jargeau and the Battle of Patay. Paris was recaptured after her death, and Louis and his father were able to ride in triumph into the city on 12 November 1437. Nevertheless, Louis grew up aware of the continuing weakness of France. He regarded his father as a weakling, and despised him for this.

==Marriages==

On 24 June 1436, Louis met Margaret, daughter of King James I of Scotland, the bride his father had chosen for diplomatic reasons. There are no direct accounts from Louis or his young bride of their first impressions of each other, and it is mere speculation whether they actually had negative feelings for each other. Several historians think that Louis had a predetermined attitude to hate his wife, but it is universally agreed that Louis entered the ceremony and the marriage itself dutifully, as evidenced by his formal embrace of Margaret upon their first meeting.

Louis&#x27;s marriage with Margaret resulted from the nature of medieval royal diplomacy and the precarious position of the French monarchy at the time. The wedding ceremony—very plain by the standards of the time—took place in the chapel of the castle of Tours on the afternoon of 25 June 1436, and was presided over by Renaud of Chartres, the Archbishop of Reims. The 12-year-old Louis clearly looked more mature than his 11-year-old bride, who was said to resemble a beautiful doll and was treated as such by her in-laws. Charles wore &quot;grey riding pants&quot; and &quot;did not even bother to remove his spurs&quot;. The Scottish guests were quickly hustled out after the wedding reception, as the French royal court was quite impoverished at this time. They simply could not afford an extravagant ceremony or to host their Scottish guests for any longer than they did. The Scots, however, saw this behaviour as an insult to their small but proud country.

Following the ceremony, &quot;doctors advised against consummation&quot; because of the relative immaturity of the bride and bridegroom. Margaret continued her studies, and Louis went on tour with Charles to loyal areas of the kingdom. Even at this time, Charles was taken aback by the intelligence and temper of his son. During this tour, Louis was named Dauphin of France by Charles, as was traditional for the eldest son of the king. The beautiful and cultured Margaret was popular at the court of France, but her marriage to Louis was not a happy one, in part because of his strained relations with her father-in-law, who was very attached to her. She died childless at the age of 20 in 1445.

In 1440, Louis, aged 16, took part in an uprising known as the Praguerie, which sought to neutralize Charles and install Louis as regent of France. The uprising failed, and Louis was forced to submit to the king, who chose to forgive him. In this revolt, Louis came under the influence of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon, whose troops were in no condition to mount such a serious threat to royal authority. Louis was forced to retreat to Paris, but was &quot;by no means trounced&quot;. In fact, before his final defeat, &quot;[Louis&#x27;s]...military strength, combined with antipathy of the masses for great lords, won him the support of the citizens of Paris.&quot; This was a great learning experience for Louis. James Cleugh notes:


In 1444, Louis led an army of &quot;écorcheurs&quot; (bands of mercenary soldiers) against the Swiss at the Battle of St. Jakob an der Birs where he sought to reconquer territories of his future brother-in-law, Sigismund of Austria-Tyrol. He won only one victory before suing for peace. He failed to achieve his original objective.

He still quarreled with his father. His objectionable scheming, which included disrespectful behavior directed against his father&#x27;s beloved mistress Agnès Sorel, caused him to be ordered out of court on 27 September 1446 and sent to his own province of Dauphiné. He lived mainly in Grenoble, in the &quot;tour de la Trésorerie&quot;. Despite frequent summons by the king, the two would never meet again. In Dauphiné, Louis ruled as king in all but name, continuing his intrigues against his father. On 14 February 1451, Louis, who had been widowed for six years, made a strategic marriage to the eight-year-old Charlotte of Savoy, without Charles&#x27;s consent. This marriage was to have long-ranging effects on foreign policy as the beginning of French involvement in the affairs of the Italian peninsula.

Finally, in August 1456, Charles sent an army to Dauphiné under the command of Antoine de Chabannes. Louis fled to Burgundy, where he was granted refuge by Duke Philip the Good and settled in the castle of Genappe. King Charles was furious when Philip refused to hand over Louis and warned the duke that he was &quot;giving shelter to a fox who will eat his chickens.&quot;

==Accession==

In 1461, Louis learned that his father was dying. He hurried to Reims to be crowned, in case his brother, Charles, Duke of Berry, should try to do the same. Louis XI became King of France on 22 July 1461.

Louis pursued many of the same goals that his father had, such as limiting the powers of the dukes and barons of France, with consistently greater success. Among other initiatives, Louis instituted reforms to make the tax system more efficient. He suppressed many of his former co-conspirators, who had thought him their friend, and he appointed to government service many men of no rank, but who had shown promising talent. He particularly favored the associates of the great French merchant Jacques Coeur. He also allowed enterprising nobles to engage in trade without losing their privileges of nobility. He eliminated offices within the government bureaucracy, and increased the demand on other offices within the government in order to promote efficiency. Louis spent a large part of his kingship on the road. Travelling from town to town in his kingdom, Louis would surprise local officials, investigate local governments, establish fairs, and promote trade regulations. Perhaps the most significant contribution of Louis XI to the organization of the modern state of France was his development of the system of royal postal roads in 1464. In this system, relays at instant service to the king operated on all the high roads of France; this communications network spread all across France and led to the king acquiring his nickname &quot;Universal Spider&quot;.

As king, Louis became extremely prudent fiscally, whereas he had previously been lavish and extravagant. He wore rough and simple clothes and mixed with ordinary people and merchants. A candid account of some of his activities is recorded by the courtier Philippe de Commines in his memoirs of the period. Louis made a habit of surrounding himself with valuable advisers of humble origins, such as Commines himself, Olivier Le Daim, Louis Tristan L&#x27;Hermite, and Jean Balue. Louis was anxious to speed up everything, transform everything, and build his own new world. In recognition of all the changes that Louis XI made to the government of France, he has the reputation of a leading &quot;civil reformer&quot; in French history, and his reforms were in the interests of the rising trading and mercantile classes that would later become the bourgeoisie of France.

Louis XI also involved himself in the affairs of the Church in France. In October 1461, Louis abolished the Pragmatic Sanction that his father had instituted in 1438 to establish a French Gallican Church free of the controls of the popes in Rome.

==Feud with Charles the Bold==

Philip III was the Duke of Burgundy at the time that Louis came to the throne, and was keen to initiate a Crusade against the Ottoman Empire. However, he needed funds to organize such an enterprise. Louis XI gave him 400,000 gold crowns for the Crusade in exchange for a number of territories, including Picardy and Amiens. However, Philip&#x27;s son, the future Charles I, Duke of Burgundy (known as the Count of Charolais at the time of Louis&#x27;s accession) was angry about this transaction, feeling that he was being deprived of his inheritance. He joined a rebellion called the League of the Public Weal, led by Louis&#x27;s brother Charles, the Duke of Berry. Although the rebels were largely unsuccessful in battle, Louis had no better luck. Louis XI fought an indecisive battle against the rebels at Montlhéry and was forced to grant an unfavourable peace as a matter of political expediency.

When the Count of Charolais became Duke of Burgundy in 1467 as Charles I (&quot;the Bold&quot;), he seriously considered declaring an independent kingdom of his own. However, Louis&#x27;s progress toward a strong centralized government had advanced to the point where the dukes of Burgundy could no longer act as independently as they had in the past. The duchy now faced many problems and revolts in its territories, especially from the people of Liège, who conducted the Liège Wars against the Duke of Burgundy. In the Liège Wars, Louis XI allied himself at first with the people of Liège.

In 1468, Louis and Charles met at Péronne, but during the course of negotiations, they learned that the citizens of Liège had again risen up against Charles and killed the Burgundian governor. Charles was furious. Philippe de Commines, at that time in the service of the duke of Burgundy, had to calm him down with the help of the duke&#x27;s other advisors for fear that he might hit the king. Louis was forced into a humiliating treaty. He gave up many of the lands he had acquired from Philip the Good, turned on his erstwhile allies in Liège and swore to help Charles put down the uprising in Liège. Louis then witnessed a siege of Liège in which hundreds were massacred.

However, once out of Charles&#x27;s reach, Louis declared the treaty invalid, and set about building up his forces. His aim was to destroy Burgundy once and for all. Nothing was more odious to Louis&#x27; dream of a centralized monarchy than the existence of an over-mighty vassal such as the Duke of Burgundy. War broke out in 1472. Duke Charles laid siege to Beauvais and other towns. However, these sieges proved unsuccessful; the Siege of Beauvais was lifted on 22 July 1472, and Charles finally sued for peace. Philippe de Commines was then welcomed into the service of King Louis.

In 1469, Louis founded the Order of St. Michael, probably in imitation of the prestigious Burgundian Order of the Golden Fleece, founded by Charles&#x27;s father Philip the Good, just as King John II of France had founded the now defunct Order of the Star in imitation of the Order of the Garter of King Edward III of England. In both cases, a French king appears to have been motivated to found an order of chivalry to increase the prestige of the French royal court by the example of his chief political adversary.

==Dealings with England==
At the same time that France and Burgundy were fighting each other, England was experiencing a bitter civil conflict now known as the Wars of the Roses. Louis had an interest in this war, for the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, was allied with the Yorkists who opposed King Henry VI. When the Earl of Warwick fell out with the Yorkist King Edward IV, after helping Edward attain his throne, Louis granted Warwick refuge in France. Through Louis&#x27;s diplomacy, Warwick then formed an alliance with his bitter enemy Margaret of Anjou in order to restore her husband Henry VI to the throne. The plan worked, and Edward was forced into exile in 1470, but he later returned to England in 1471. Warwick was then killed at the Battle of Barnet in 1471. King Henry VI was soon murdered afterwards.

Now the undisputed master of England, Edward invaded France in 1475, but Louis was able to negotiate the Treaty of Picquigny, by which the English army left France in return for a large sum of money. The English renounced their claim to French lands such as Normandy, and the Hundred Years&#x27; War could be said to be finally over. Louis bragged that although his father had driven the English out by force of arms, he had driven them out by force of pâté, venison, and good French wine.

==Outcome of rivalry with Charles the Bold==
Just as his father had done, Louis spent most of his reign dealing with political disputes with the reigning Duke of Burgundy, and for this purpose he employed the Swiss, whose military might was renowned. He had admired it himself at the Battle of St. Jakob an der Birs.

War broke out between Charles and the Swiss after he invaded Switzerland. The invasion proved to be a tremendous mistake. On 2 March 1476, the Swiss attacked and defeated the Burgundians first at Grandson and then again a few months later, on 22 June that year, at Murten. The duke was killed at the Battle of Nancy on 5 January 1477, an event that marked the end of the Burgundian Wars.

Louis was thus able to see the destruction of his sworn enemy. Those lords who still favored the feudal system gave in to his authority. Others, such as Jacques d&#x27;Armagnac, Duke of Nemours, were executed. The lands belonging to the Duchy of Burgundy as constituted by Louis&#x27;s great-great-grandfather John II for the benefit of his son Philip the Bold reverted to the crown of France.

==Italian connections==
The marriage on 14 February 1451 between 28-year-old Louis and the 8-year-old Charlotte of Savoy was the true beginning of French involvement in the affairs of Italy. The Italian peninsula was a compact and politically competitive space dominated by five powers: Venice, Milan, Florence, the Papacy, and the Kingdom of Naples. Beside these five great regional powers, there were about a dozen smaller states in Italy that were constantly changing policies and shifting alliances between and towards the various regional powers. The city/state of Genoa and the rising state of Savoy, which centered on the city of Turin, were examples of these lesser powers in northern Italy. Even the Italic League—the combination of the five major powers of Italy that had been born out of the Treaty of Lodi of 1454—was constantly undergoing internal realignments.

Both Louis XI and his father Charles VII had been too busy with their struggles with Burgundy to pay much attention to political affairs smoldering in Italy. Additionally, Louis had his attention drawn away from Italy by disagreements with the rulers of England and his struggles with Maximilian of Austria, who married the heir of Charles the Bold, Mary of Burgundy, and wanted to keep her territorial inheritance intact. However, the death of the Duke of Burgundy in 1477, which conclusively settled the issue of Burgundy&#x27;s position under the French throne, the conclusion of the Treaty of Picquigny with England in 1475 and the peaceful resolution in 1482 of the disposition of the &quot;Burgundian inheritance&quot; left to Mary of Burgundy finally allowed Louis XI to turn his attention to Italy.

Viewed from the Italian states, the death of the Duke of Burgundy in 1477 and the resultant downfall of his duchy as a threat to the French throne signalled vast changes in the states&#x27; relationships with the kingdom of France.Despite his connection by marriage to the royal house of Savoy, Louis XI continuously courted a strong relationship with Francesco I Sforza, the Duke of Milan, who was a traditional enemy of Savoy. As a confirmation of the close relationship between Milan and the king of France, Sforza sent his son Galeazzo Maria Sforza to aid Louis XI in his war against the League of Public Weal in 1465 at the head of a large army. Later, differences arose between France and Milan that caused Milan to seek ways of separating itself from dependence on the French. However, with the downfall of Burgundy in 1477, France was seen in a new light by Milan, which now hurriedly repaired its relationship with Louis XI. Likewise, France&#x27;s old enemy King Ferdinand I of Naples began to seek a marriage alliance between the Kingdom of Naples and France. Louis XI also opened new friendly relations with the Papal States, forgetting the past devotion of the popes for the Duke of Burgundy. In January 1478, he signed a favorable treaty with the Republic of Venice.

French involvement in the affairs of Italy would be carried to new levels by Louis XI&#x27;s son Charles VIII in 1493, when he answered an appeal for help from Ludovico Sforza, the younger son of Francesco Sforza, that led to an invasion of Italy. This would become a significant turning point in Italian political history.

==Death==

Louis XI, having suffered from bouts of apoplexy and years of illness, died on 30 August, 1483, and was interred in the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Cléry in Cléry-Saint-André in the Arrondissement of Orléans. His widow, Charlotte, died a few months later, and is interred with him. Louis XI was succeeded by his son Charles VIII, who was thirteen years of age. Louis&#x27; eldest daughter, Anne, became regent on Charles&#x27;s behalf.

===Legacy===

Eager to obtain information about his enemies, Louis created, from 1464, a net of postal relays all over France, which was a precursor to the modern French postal service.

Louis developed his kingdom by encouraging trade fairs and the building and maintenance of roads. Louis XI pursued the organization of the kingdom of France with the assistance of bourgeois officials. In some respects, Louis XI perfected the framework of the modern French Government which was to last until the French Revolution. Thus, Louis XI is one of the first modern kings of France who helped take it out of the Middle Ages.

Louis XI was very superstitious and surrounded himself with astrologers. Interested in science, he once pardoned a man sentenced to death on condition that he serve as a test subject for a gallstone operation.

Through wars and guile, Louis XI overcame France&#x27;s mostly independent feudal lords, and at the time of his death in the Château de Plessis-lez-Tours, he had united France and laid the foundations of a strong monarchy. He was, however, a secretive, reclusive man, and few mourned his death.

Despite Louis XI&#x27;s political acumen and overall policy of &quot;Realpolitik&quot;, Niccolò Machiavelli criticized him harshly in Chapter 13 of &quot;The Prince&quot;, calling him shortsighted and imprudent for abolishing his own infantry in favor of Swiss mercenaries.

<doc id="70508" wikidata="Q814296" url="?curid=70508" title="Brief Encounter">
<text>Brief Encounter is a 1945 British romantic drama film directed by David Lean from a screenplay by Noël Coward, based on his 1936 one-act play &quot;Still Life&quot;. The film stars Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard in lead roles, alongside Stanley Holloway, Joyce Carey, Cyril Raymond, Everley Gregg and Margaret Barton in supporting roles.

&quot;Brief Encounter&quot; tells the story of two married strangers living in pre-World War II England, whose chance meeting at a railway station leads to a brief yet intense emotional affair, disrupting their otherwise conventional lives.

&quot;Brief Encounter&quot; premiered in London on 13 November 1945, followed by its wide release on 25 November. The film received widespread critical acclaim, with Johnson and Howard&#x27;s performances earning high praise. However, despite critical acclaim, it emerged as a moderate commercial success at the box-office.

&quot;Brief Encounter&quot; received three nominations at the 19th Academy Awards for Best Director (Lean), Best Actress (Johnson) and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film was one of the winners in the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; category at the 1st Cannes Film Festival, while Johnson won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.

Many critics, historians, and scholars consider &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; as one of the greatest films of all time&quot;.&quot; In 1999, the British Film Institute ranked it the second-greatest British film of all time. In 2017, a &quot;Time Out&quot; poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers, and critics ranked it the 12th-best British film ever.

== Plot ==
In a railway station refreshment room, a man and a woman are sitting glumly at a table. One of the woman&#x27;s friends comes in and immediately begins chatting away. After some terse pleasantries, the man leaves to catch his train. The woman explains that the man is about to move to Africa. After the man leaves, the woman abruptly disappears but soon returns, explaining that she wanted to see the express train. After a short interval, the two women head for their own train.

At home, Laura Jesson, the woman at the table, sits in the living room with her husband Fred. Although Fred is a kind man, he lacks Laura&#x27;s ear for music, and the two rarely engage in meaningful conversation. Laura silently reflects on her recent experiences, which she retells in the form of a confession to her husband.

Laura visits a nearby town every week to shop and watch a matinée film. During one such outing to Milford, she meets idealistic doctor Alec Harvey, who works at the local hospital on Thursdays. Alec charms her by gently removing a piece of grit from her eye.

Laura continues visiting Milford on Thursdays. The following week, she runs into Alec at the chemist. The week after that, they eat lunch and watch a movie together. Although they are both married with children, their innocent, casual relationship begins to deepen, verging on infidelity. Although the situation makes them uneasy, they admit they love each other.Laura and Alec continue meeting in public until they unexpectedly run into some of Laura&#x27;s friends, necessitating the first of many deceptions. Eventually, they agree to make love at the flat of Alec&#x27;s friend Stephen, who has dinner plans. However, Stephen returns unexpectedly. Stephen overhears Laura sneaking out and subtly chides Alec for his infidelity. A distraught Laura wanders the streets for three hours until a concerned police officer urges her to go home.

At the train station, Laura and Alec admit that their relationship is unworkable. For the sake of his family, Alec decides to end his relationship with Laura by moving to South Africa.

The next week, Laura and Alec have their final meeting in the railway station refreshment room, as previously shown in the opening scene. As they prepare to part for the last time, Laura&#x27;s acquaintance Dolly Messiter interrupts them, oblivious to their anguish.

Alec’s train arrives before they can say a proper goodbye. He discreetly squeezes Laura’s shoulder as he departs. Laura, overcome with emotion, nearly commits suicide by jumping in front of an express train. However, she gathers herself and returns home to her family.

At home, Fred acknowledges Laura&#x27;s emotional distance, though whether he knows the cause remains unclear. He thanks her for coming back to him, and she weeps in his arms.

A parallel subplot involves the interactions of the station and refreshment room staff. Two of the staff flirt with each other but cannot engage in public displays of affection during work hours, which humorously contrasts with Laura and Alec&#x27;s ability to meet openly with each other and inability to have a relationship outside of work hours.

==Cast==
==Adaptation==
===&quot;Still Life&quot;===
&quot;Brief Encounter&quot; is based on Noël Coward&#x27;s one-act play &quot;Still Life&quot; (1936), one of ten short plays in the cycle &quot;Tonight at 8.30&quot;, designed for Gertrude Lawrence and Coward himself, to be performed in various combinations as triple bills. All scenes in &quot;Still Life&quot; are set in the refreshment room of a railway station, the fictional Milford Junction.

As is common in films adapted from stage plays, the film includes settings that are only mentioned in the play, such as Dr. Lynn&#x27;s flat, Laura&#x27;s home, a cinema, a restaurant, and a branch of Boots the Chemist. Several scenes were added for the film, including a scene on a lake where Dr. Harvey gets his feet wet, Laura wandering alone in the dark and smoking on a park bench where she is confronted by a police officer, and a drive in the country in a hired car.

Some scenes were altered to be less ambiguous and more dramatic in the film adaptation. The scene in which the lovers are about to commit adultery is toned down; in the play, it is left to the audience to decide whether they actually consummate their relationship, while in the film, they do not. In the film, Laura has only just arrived at Dr. Lynn&#x27;s flat when the owner returns, prompting Dr. Harvey to quickly escort her out via the kitchen service door. Additionally, when Laura contemplates suicide by throwing herself in front of a train, the film makes her intention clearer through voice-over narration.

In the play, the characters at Milford station—Mrs. Bagot, Mr. Godby, Beryl, and Stanley—are aware of the growing relationship between Laura and Alec and occasionally mention it in an offhand manner. In the film, these characters pay little attention to the couple. The film&#x27;s final scene, where Laura embraces her husband after he acknowledges her emotional distance and possibly suspects the cause, is not present in the original play.

Two editions of Coward&#x27;s original screenplay for the film adaptation are available, both listed in the bibliography.

==Production==
Much of the film was shot at Carnforth railway station in Lancashire, then a junction on the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. Although it was a busy station, it was far enough away from major cities to avoid the blackout for film purposes, allowing shooting to take place in early 1945 before World War II had ended. At two points in the film, platform signs indicate local destinations such as Leeds, Bradford, Morecambe and Lancaster, even though Milford is intended to be in the Home Counties. Noël Coward provided the station announcements in the film. The station refreshment room was recreated in a studio. Carnforth Station retains many of the period features from the time of filming and has become a place of pilgrimage for fans of the film. Some of the urban scenes were shot in London, Denham, and Beaconsfield, near Denham Studios.

The country bridge the lovers visit twice, including on their final day, is Middle Fell Bridge at Dungeon Ghyll in Cumbria.

The poem that Fred asks Laura to help him with for his crossword is by John Keats: &quot;When I have Fears that I may Cease to Be&quot;. The quote Fred recites is &quot;When I behold, upon the night&#x27;s starr&#x27;d face, huge cloudy symbols of a high romance&quot;.

In addition to the Keats reference, there is a visual reference to an Arabic love poem. In Dr. Lynn&#x27;s apartment, a wall hanging is prominently displayed twice—first over the dining table when Laura enters, and later over Alec&#x27;s left shoulder when Stephen confronts him.

The original choice for the role of Alec Harvey was Roger Livesey, but David Lean cast Trevor Howard after seeing him in &quot;The Way to the Stars&quot;. Joyce Barbour was originally cast as Dolly, but Lean was dissatisfied with her performance, and she was replaced by Everley Gregg.

==Music==
Excerpts from Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 recur throughout the film, performed by the National Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Muir Mathieson, with Eileen Joyce as the pianist. Additionally, there is a scene in a tearoom where a salon orchestra plays &quot;Spanish Dance No. 5 (Bolero)&quot; by Moritz Moszkowski.

==Release==

===Box office===
According to trade papers, &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; was a &quot;notable box-office attraction&quot; and was the 21st most popular film at the British box office in 1946. &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; reported that the biggest box office success in Britain that year was &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot;, with other major hits including &quot;The Bells of St Mary&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Piccadilly Incident&quot;, &quot;The Road to Utopia&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Is Forever&quot;, &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;, &quot;Wonder Man&quot;, &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, &quot;Kitty&quot;, &quot;The Captive Heart&quot;, &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot;, &quot;Spanish Main&quot;, &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Gilda&quot;, &quot;Caravan&quot;, &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, &quot;Blue Dahlia&quot;, &quot;Years Between&quot;, &quot;O.S.S.&quot;, &quot;Spellbound&quot;, &quot;Courage of Lassie&quot;, &quot;My Reputation&quot;, &quot;London Town&quot;, &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Meet the Navy&quot;, &quot;Men of Two Worlds&quot;, &quot;Theirs Is the Glory&quot;, &quot;The Overlanders&quot;, and &quot;Bedelia&quot;.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Brief Encounter&quot; received widespread critical acclaim, with Johnson and Howard&#x27;s performances earning high praise; although there were doubts that it would be &quot;generally popular&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film, stating, &quot;Coward&#x27;s name and strong story spell nice US chances.&quot;

It was a moderate success in the UK and became a major hit in the US, leading to Johnson&#x27;s nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Today, &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; is widely acclaimed for its black-and-white cinematography and the evocative atmosphere created by its steam-age railway setting, elements particularly associated with David Lean&#x27;s original version. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;&quot;Brief Encounter&quot; adds a small but valuable gem to the Lean filmography, depicting a doomed couple&#x27;s illicit connection with affecting sensitivity and a pair of powerful performances.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 92 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
==Legacy==
In her book &quot;Noël Coward&quot; (1987), Frances Gray notes that &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; is, after Coward’s major comedies, the one work of his that almost everybody knows and has likely seen. The film has frequently aired on television to high viewership consistently. Its story is that of an unconsummated affair between two married people [...] Coward is keeping his lovers in check because he cannot handle the energies of a less inhibited love in a setting shorn of the wit and exotic flavour of his best comedies [...] To look at the script, shorn of David Lean&#x27;s beautiful camera work, deprived of an audience who would automatically approve of the final sacrifice, is to find oneself asking awkward questions (pp. 64–67).

&quot;Brief Encounter&quot; has earned a lasting legacy in cinema history. In 1952, it was voted one of the 10 greatest films ever made in two separate critics&#x27; polls. In 1999, the British Film Institute ranked it #2 on the BFI Top 100 British films list, and in 2004, &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine named it the 44th greatest British film of all time. Film critic Derek Malcolm included it in his 2000 column &quot;The Century of Films&quot;. British historian Thomas Dixon remarked that &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; &quot;has become a classic example of a very modern and very British phenomenon—weeping over the stiff upper lip, crying at people not crying. The audiences for these wartime weepies could, through their own tears, provide something that was lacking in their own lives as well as those of the on-screen stoics they admired.&quot;

Director Robert Altman&#x27;s wife Kathryn Altman said, &quot;One day, years and years ago, just after the war, [Altman] had nothing to do and he went to a theater in the middle of the afternoon to see a movie. Not a Hollywood movie: a British movie. He said the main character was not glamorous, not a babe. And at first he wondered why he was even watching it. But twenty minutes later, he was in tears, and had fallen in love with her. And it made him feel that it wasn&#x27;t just a movie.&quot; The film was &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;.

The film&#x27;s influence extends into other works. The British play and film &quot;The History Boys&quot; features two characters reciting a passage from &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;.

The episode &quot;Grief Encounter&quot; of the British comedy series &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot; features a reference to Coward and includes a scene filmed at Milford railway station, echoing &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Mum&#x27;s Army&quot;, an episode of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; appears to be loosely inspired by the film.

&quot;Brief Encounter&quot; also serves as a plot device in &quot;Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont&quot; (2005), a comedy-drama film based on Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s 1971 novel. In the story, the aging widow Mrs. Palfrey reminisces about &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; as her and her late husband’s favorite film, leading to a significant connection between her young friend and writer Ludovic Meyer and his eventual girlfriend.

In the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls of the world’s greatest films, &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; received votes from 11 critics and three directors.

==Social context==

Frances Gray acknowledges a common criticism of the play: why do the characters not consummate the affair? Gray argues that the characters&#x27; restraint is rooted in class consciousness. While the working classes might be seen as vulgar and the upper classes as frivolous, the middle class, which sees itself as the moral backbone of society, upholds these values. Coward, whose principal audience was the middle class, was reluctant to question or jeopardize these norms.

In her narration, Laura emphasizes that what ultimately holds her back is not class consciousness, but her deep-seated horror at the thought of betraying her husband and her moral principles, despite being profoundly tempted by her emotions. This tension between desire and duty is a key element that has contributed to the film&#x27;s enduring appeal.

The values that Laura precariously, but ultimately successfully, upholds were widely shared and respected at the time of the film&#x27;s setting. For instance, the stigma associated with divorce was significant enough to cause Edward VIII to abdicate in 1936. Updating the story to a more contemporary setting might have rendered these values obsolete, thereby undermining the plot&#x27;s credibility—a factor that may explain why the 1974 remake failed to resonate as strongly.

The film was released against the backdrop of the Second World War, a period when &quot;brief encounters&quot; were common, and women experienced greater sexual and economic freedom than before. In &quot;British National Cinema&quot; (1997), Sarah Street argues that &quot;&quot;Brief Encounter&quot; articulated a range of feelings about infidelity that invited easy identification, whether it involved one&#x27;s husband, lover, children, or country (p. 55). In this context, feminist critics have interpreted the film as an attempt to stabilize relationships and restore the pre-war social order.

In his 1993 BFI book on the film, Richard Dyer notes that, with the rise of homosexual law reform, gay men also identified with the characters&#x27; plight, seeing it as analogous to their own social constraints in forming and maintaining relationships. Sean O&#x27;Connor further considers the film an &quot;allegorical representation of forbidden love,&quot; informed by Coward&#x27;s experiences as a closeted gay man.

==Further adaptations==

===Radio===
&quot;Brief Encounter&quot; was adapted as a radio play on the 20 November 1946 episode of &quot;Academy Award Theater&quot;, starring Greer Garson. It was also presented three times on &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;: on 12 May 1947 with Herbert Marshall and Lilli Palmer, on 12 January 1948 with Marshall and Irene Dunne, and on 11 January 1951 with Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr. Additionally, &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; adapted the film on 29 November 1948 with Garson and Van Heflin, and again on 14 May 1951 with Olivia de Havilland and Richard Basehart.

On 30 October 2009, as part of the celebrations for the 75th anniversary of the BBC&#x27;s Maida Vale Studios, Jenny Seagrove and Nigel Havers starred in a special Radio 2 production of &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;, performed live from Maida Vale&#x27;s studio 6 (MV6). The script used was a 1947 adaptation for radio by Maurice Horspool, which had been in the BBC&#x27;s archives and had never been performed since its creation.

In addition, &quot;Theatre Guild on the Air&quot; broadcast two adaptations of &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; in its original form, &quot;Still Life&quot;. The first aired on 6 April 1947 on ABC featuring Ingrid Bergman, Sam Wanamaker and Peggy Wood. The second aired on 13 November 1949 on NBC, starring Helen Hayes and David Niven.

===TV===
* In 1961, &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; was adapted for television, starring Dinah Shore and Ralph Bellamy.
* A 1974 television remake, aired in the United States on &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;, featured Sophia Loren and Richard Burton. However, this version was not well received by critics or audiences.

===Theatre===
The first adaptation of &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; to source from both the screenplay and Noël Coward&#x27;s original stage material was created by Andrew Taylor and starred Hayley Mills. This production embarked on its first national tour in 1996 and later transferred to the West End, where it played at the Lyric Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue, in 2000, featuring Jenny Seagrove in the lead role.

Emma Rice/Kneehigh Theatre adaptation

The Kneehigh Theatre production, adapted and directed by Emma Rice, was a unique blend of the film and Coward&#x27;s original stage play, incorporating additional musical elements. Produced by David Pugh and Dafydd Rogers, the adaptation premiered at Birmingham Repertory Theatre in October 2007 and later at the West Yorkshire Playhouse before opening in February 2008 at the Haymarket Cinema in London, which was temporarily converted into a theatre for the play. The 2008 London cast included Amanda Lawrence, Tamzin Griffin, Tristan Sturrock, and Naomi Frederick in lead roles. The production ran until November 2008 and subsequently toured the UK from February to July 2009, with performances at venues including the Oxford Playhouse, Marlowe Theatre and Richmond Theatre. During the tour, the lead roles were played by Hannah Yelland and Milo Twomey.

The US premiere of the Kneehigh adaptation was held at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco from September to October 2009. The production later moved to St. Ann&#x27;s Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York, for performances in December 2009 and January 2010, followed by a run at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis from February to April 2010.

A Roundabout Theatre Company production of the Kneehigh adaptation opened at Studio 54 in New York City on 28 September 2010, starring Hannah Yelland, Tristan Sturrock, and other members of the London cast. The limited engagement closed on 2 January 2011, after 21 previews and 119 performances, including a four-week extension.

After an Australian tour in the autumn of 2013, Kneehigh&#x27;s &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; was staged at the Wallis Annenberg Center in Beverly Hills and the Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C., in the spring of 2014.

The production returned to the UK in 2018, opening at Birmingham Repertory Theatre (where it originally premiered) and The Lowry in Salford in February, before returning to the Haymarket Cinema in London from March to September 2018.

===Opera===
In May 2009, Houston Grand Opera premiered a two-act opera titled &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;, based on the film&#x27;s story. The opera featured music by André Previn and a libretto by John Caird.

<text>Robert Southey (; 12 August 1774 – 21 March 1843) was an English poet of the Romantic school, and Poet Laureate from 1813 until his death. Like the other Lake Poets, William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Southey began as a radical but became steadily more conservative as he gained respect for Britain and its institutions. Other romantics such as Byron accused him of siding with the establishment for money and status. He is remembered especially for the poem &quot;After Blenheim&quot; and the original version of &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bears&quot;.

==Life==

Robert Southey was born in Wine Street, Bristol, to Robert Southey and Margaret Hill. He was educated at Westminster School, London (where he was expelled for writing an article in &quot;The Flagellant&quot;, a magazine he originated, attributing the invention of flogging to the Devil), and at Balliol College, Oxford.

Southey went to Oxford with &quot;a heart full of poetry and feeling, a head full of Rousseau and Werther, and my religious principles shaken by Gibbon&quot;. He later said of Oxford, &quot;All I learnt was a little swimming... and a little boating&quot;. He did, however, write a play, &quot;Wat Tyler&quot; (which, in 1817, after he became Poet Laureate, was published, to embarrass him, by his enemies). Experimenting with a writing partnership with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, most notably in their joint composition of &quot;The Fall of Robespierre&quot;, Southey published his first collection of poems in 1794. The same year, Southey, Coleridge, Robert Lovell and several others discussed creating an idealistic community (&quot;pantisocracy&quot;) on the banks of the Susquehanna River in America.

In 1795 he married Edith Fricker, whose sister Sara married Coleridge. The same year, he travelled to Portugal, and wrote &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, published in 1796. He then wrote many ballads, went to Spain in 1800, and on his return settled in the Lake District.

In 1799, Southey and Coleridge were involved with early experiments with nitrous oxide (laughing gas), conducted by the Cornish scientist Humphry Davy.

While writing prodigiously, he received a government pension in 1807, and in 1809 started a long association with the Quarterly Review, which provided almost his only income for most of his life. He was appointed laureate in 1813, a post he came greatly to dislike. 

In 1819 Southey accompanied the Scottish civil engineer Thomas Telford, whom Southey nicknamed the “Colossus of Roads” on a tour of inspection of Telford’s works in Scotland. These included the Caledonian Canal (which would open three years later) and a number of Telford&#x27;s roads, bridges, and harbour works. Southey’s account of the tour, &quot;Journal of a Tour in Scotland in 1819,&quot; gives detailed descriptions of Telford’s engineering projects and records Southey’s own impressions of the Scottish landscape and people.

In 1821, Southey wrote &quot;A Vision of Judgment&quot;, to commemorate George III, in the preface to which he attacked Byron who, as well as responding with a parody, &quot;The Vision of Judgment&quot; (see below), mocked him frequently in &quot;Don Juan&quot;.
In 1837, Edith died, and Southey remarried, to Caroline Anne Bowles, also a poet, on 4 June 1839. The marriage broke down, not least because of his increasing dementia. His mind was giving way when he wrote a last letter to his friend Walter Savage Landor in 1839, but he continued to mention Landor&#x27;s name when generally incapable of mentioning anyone. He died on 21 March 1843 and was buried in the churchyard of Crosthwaite Church, Keswick, where he had worshipped for forty years. There is a memorial to him inside the church, with an epitaph written by his friend William Wordsworth.
Southey was also a prolific letter writer, literary scholar, essay writer, historian and biographer. His biographies include the life and works of John Bunyan, John Wesley, William Cowper, Oliver Cromwell and Horatio Nelson. The last has rarely been out of print since its publication in 1813 and was adapted as the 1926 British film &quot;Nelson&quot;.

He was a generous man, particularly kind to Coleridge&#x27;s abandoned family, but he incurred the enmity of many, including Hazlitt as well as Byron, who felt he had betrayed his principles in accepting pensions and the laureateship, and in retracting his youthful ideals.

==Politics==

Although originally a radical supporter of the French Revolution, Southey followed the trajectory of his fellow Romantic poets Wordsworth and Coleridge towards conservatism. Embraced by the Tory establishment as Poet Laureate, and from 1807 in receipt of a yearly stipend from them, he vigorously supported the Liverpool government. He argued against parliamentary reform (&quot;the railroad to ruin with the Devil for driver&quot;), blamed the Peterloo Massacre on an allegedly revolutionary &quot;rabble&quot; killed and injured by government troops, and spurned Catholic emancipation. In 1817 he privately proposed penal transportation for those guilty of &quot;libel&quot; or &quot;sedition&quot;. He had in mind figures like Thomas Jonathan Wooler and William Hone, whose prosecution he urged. Such writers were guilty, he wrote in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, of &quot;inflaming the turbulent temper of the manufacturer and disturbing the quiet attachment of the peasant to those institutions under which he and his fathers have dwelt in peace.&quot; Wooler and Hone were acquitted, but the threats caused another target, William Cobbett, to emigrate temporarily to the United States.

In some respects, Southey was ahead of his time in his views on social reform. For example, he was an early critic of the evils the new factory system brought to early 19th-century Britain. He was appalled by the living conditions in towns like Birmingham and Manchester and especially by employment of children in factories and outspoken about them. He sympathised with the pioneering socialist plans of Robert Owen, advocated that the state promote public works to maintain high employment, and called for universal education.

Given his departure from radicalism, and his attempts to have former fellow travellers prosecuted, it is unsurprising that less successful contemporaries who kept the faith attacked Southey. They saw him as selling out for money and respectability.

In 1817, Southey was confronted with the surreptitious publication of a radical play, &quot;Wat Tyler&quot;, which he had written in 1794 at the height of his radical period. This was instigated by his enemies in an attempt to embarrass the Poet Laureate and highlight his apostasy from radical poet to supporter of the Tory establishment. One of his most savage critics was William Hazlitt. In his portrait of Southey, in &quot;The Spirit of the Age&quot;, he wrote: &quot;He wooed Liberty as a youthful lover, but it was perhaps more as a mistress than a bride; and he has since wedded with an elderly and not very reputable lady, called Legitimacy.&quot; Southey largely ignored his critics but was forced to defend himself when William Smith, a member of Parliament, rose in the House of Commons on 14 March to attack him. In a spirited response Southey wrote an open letter to the MP, in which he explained that he had always aimed at lessening human misery and bettering the condition of all the lower classes and that he had only changed in respect of &quot;the means by which that amelioration was to be effected.&quot; As he put it, &quot;that as he learnt to understand the institutions of his country, he learnt to appreciate them rightly, to love, and to revere, and to defend them.&quot;

Another critic of Southey in his later period was Thomas Love Peacock, who scorned him in the character of Mr. Feathernest in his 1817 satirical novel &quot;Melincourt&quot;.

He was often mocked for what were seen as sycophantic odes to the king, notably in Byron&#x27;s long ironic dedication of &quot;Don Juan&quot; to Southey. In the poem Southey is dismissed as insolent, narrow and shabby. This was based both on Byron&#x27;s lack of respect for Southey&#x27;s literary talent, and his disdain for what he perceived as Southey&#x27;s hypocritical turn to conservatism later in life. Much of the animosity between the two men can be traced back to Byron&#x27;s belief that Southey had spread rumours about him and Percy Bysshe Shelley being in a &quot;League of Incest&quot; during their time on Lake Geneva in 1816, an accusation that Southey strenuously denied.

In response, Southey attacked what he called the Satanic School among modern poets in the preface to his poem, &quot;A Vision of Judgement&quot;, written after the death of George III. While not naming Byron, it was clearly directed at him. Byron retaliated with &quot;The Vision of Judgment&quot;, a parody of Southey&#x27;s poem.

Without his prior knowledge, the Earl of Radnor, an admirer of his work, had Southey returned as MP for the latter&#x27;s pocket borough seat of Downton in Wiltshire at the 1826 general election, as an opponent of Catholic emancipation, but Southey refused to sit, causing a by-election in December that year, pleading that he did not have a large enough estate to support him through political life, or want to take on the hours full attendance required. He wished to continue living in the Lake District and preferred to defend the Church of England in writing rather than speech. He declared that &quot;for me to change my scheme of life and go into Parliament, would be to commit a moral and intellectual suicide.&quot; His friend John Rickman, a Commons clerk, noted that &quot;prudential reasons would forbid his appearing in London&quot; as a Member.

In 1835, Southey declined the offer of a baronetcy, but accepted a life pension of £300 a year from Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel.

==Reputation==

Charles Lamb, in a letter to Coleridge, stated, &quot;With &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; I have been delighted, amazed. I had not presumed to expect of any thing of such excellence from Southey. Why the poem is alone sufficient to redeem the character of the age we live in from the imputation of degenerating in Poetry [...] On the whole, I expect Southey one day to rival Milton.&quot;

Regarding &quot;Thalaba the Destroyer&quot;, Ernest Bernhard-Kabisch pointed out that &quot;Few readers have been as enthusiastic about it as Cardinal Newman who considered it the most &#x27;morally sublime&#x27; of English poems. But the young Shelley reckoned it his favourite poem, and both he and Keats followed its lead in some of their verse narratives.&quot;

While Southey was writing &quot;Madoc&quot;, Coleridge believed that the poem would be superior to the &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

Robert Southey had a notable influence on Russian literature. Pushkin highly appreciated his work and translated the beginning of the &quot;Hymn to the Penates&quot; and &quot;Madoc&quot;, and was also inspired by the plot of &quot;Roderick&quot; to create an original poem on the same plot (&quot;Родрик&quot;). At the beginning of the 20th century, Southey was translated by Gumilyov and Lozinsky. In 1922, the publishing house &quot;Vsemirnaya Literatura&quot; published the first separate edition of Southey&#x27;s ballads in Russia, compiled by Gumilyov. In 2006, a bilingual edition prepared by E. Witkowski was published, a significant part of which included new translations.

Southey was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1822. He was also a member of the Royal Spanish Academy.

==In popular culture==
*In the video game &quot;Book of Hours&quot;, released in 2023 by Weather Factory, the Southey family are good friends with the fictional Baroness Eva Dewulf, and there are rumours that they adopted her illegitimate child as Abra Southey and presented her as the younger sister to Robert.

<text>Telenor ASA ( or ) is a Norwegian majority state-owned multinational telecommunications company headquartered at Fornebu in Bærum, close to Oslo. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest mobile telecommunications companies with operations worldwide, but focused in Scandinavia and Asia. It has extensive broadband and TV distribution operations in four Nordic countries, and a 10-year-old research and business line for machine-to-machine technology. Telenor owns networks in 8 countries.

Telenor is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and had a market capitalization in November 2015 of kr 225 billion, making it the third largest company listed on the OSE after DNB and Equinor (previously known as Statoil).

==History==



===Telegraph===
Telenor started off in 1855, as a state-operated monopoly provider of telegraph services named Telegrafverket. The first Norwegian planning for a telegraph were launched within the Royal Norwegian Navy in 1848, but by 1852, the plans were public and the Parliament of Norway decided on a plan for constructing a telegraph system throughout the country. Televerket began by connecting Christiania (now Oslo) to Sweden (Norway was at that time in a union with Sweden) as well as Christiania and Drammen. By 1857, the telegraph had reached Bergen on the west coast via Sørlandet on the south coast, and by 1871, it had reached Kirkenes on the far north coast. Cable connections were opened to Denmark in 1867 and to Great Britain in 1869. The telegraph was most important for the merchant marine who now could use the electric telegraph to instantly communicate between different locations, and get a whole new advantage from better logistics.

===Telephone===

The first telephone service in Norway was offered in 1878, between Arendal and Tvedestrand, while the first international telephone service between Christiania and Stockholm was offered in 1893. Automation of the telephone system was started in 1920, and completed in 1985. In 1946, the first Telex service was offered, and in 1976, satellite telephone connections to the Norwegian merchant navy, at the time the largest in the world and to oil platforms in the North Sea were made operational. This is the start of Inmarsat Satellite Communication, and formed the first steps to digitalise the telephone network in 1980–1985.

Televerket opened its first manual mobile telephone system in 1966, being replaced with the automatic NMT system in 1981, and the enhanced NMT-900 in 1986. Norway was the first country in to get an automatic mobile telephone system. The digital GSM system came into use in 1993. The third generation of mobile technology with UMTS system began full operation 2004. The Opera web browser was created in 1994 by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner and Geir Ivarsøy during their tenure at Telenor, and Opera Software was established in 1995, when they went on to continue development of their browser. Telenor and Huawei conducted a successful test of 5G with 70 Gbit/s Speeds in Lab environment.

===Deregulation and internationalisation===
The corporation changed its name to Televerket in 1969. In 1994, then the Norwegian Telecom was established as a public corporation. The telecom sector in Norway, was deregulated in stages between 1994 and 1998. An attempt to merge Telenor with its counterpart in Sweden, Telia, failed in 1999, while both still were owned by their respective governments. On 4 December 2000, the company was partially privatised and listed on Oslo Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. The privatisation gave the company in new capital, with the Government of Norway owning 77.7 percent of the company. As of 2014, the Norwegian government holds 53.97 percent of the Telenor shares directly and another 4.66 percent through the Government Pension Fund Norway.

In the second half of the 1990s, Telenor began mobile operations in other countries: Russia (1994), Bangladesh, Greece, Ireland, Germany and Austria (1997), Ukraine (1998), Malaysia (1999), Denmark and Thailand (2000), Hungary (2002), Montenegro (2004), Pakistan (2004), Slovakia, Czech Republic, Serbia (2006), Myanmar (2014). Operations in Greece, Ireland and Germany were sold in 1999/2000, and profits were re-invested in emerging markets. In October 2005, Telenor acquired Vodafone Sweden, changing the name to Telenor in April 2006.

Grameenphone was the first Telenor venture in the Asian telecom market and is now the largest mobile operator in Bangladesh, Telenor holds 55.8 per cent of the company. Grameenphone started trading its shares on the stock exchanges in Dhaka and Chittagong on 16 November 2009. The success of Grammeenphone lead to an increased focus on Asia, with successful entries into Malaysia, Thailand Pakistan, and Myanmar. Telenor also entered India, but had to withdraw from that market in 2017, with substantial losses.

In March 2018, Telenor sold its business in Southeast Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, Montenegro and Serbia) to the PPF Group, for a sum of 2.8 billion euros in order to focus more on Asia and the Nordic market. 
In 2019, Telenor bought DNA, the third largest mobile operator in Finland.

On 21 June 2021, Axiata, Telenor and Digi agree to a potential merger of Celcom and Digi to create a stronger telco in Malaysia, which if approved will be completed by the end of 2022. This come after advanced discussions two months earlier. The deal was approved by both Celcom and Digi shareholders on 18 November 2022. The merged company is named CelcomDigi. At completion, Axiata and Telenor will hold equal ownership of 33.1 percent each in the newly merged company. The merger was completed on 30 November 2022 and the company began its operation the next day.

On 22 November 2021, Telenor and Charoen Pokphand Group, officially announced they have agreed to explore a USD 8.6 billion merger plan between Thailand’s second and third largest telecom operators (by subscribers), True Corporation (TRUE) and Total Access Communication (DTAC) – the proposed merger is subject to regulatory approvals. The merger was &quot;acknowledged&quot; by the regulator NBTC at a meeting on October 20, 2022. The newly merged company still retain the True Corporation name, which was founded on 1 March 2023 and it was listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand under the stock ticker symbol TRUE on 3 March 2023.

==Operations==
Telenor offers a full range of telecommunication services in the Nordic countries, including mobile and fixed telephony, Internet access and as well as cable TV access and content. Telenor still remains the largest actor in Norway despite competition from Telia and others.

The group holds a prominent position in the Scandinavian Broadband and TV market, both with regard to the number of subscribers and to the extent of coverage. The TV distribution is branded Allente. Telenor is also a prominent actor in Asia with operations in five different Asian countries.

At year-end 2021, Telenor held controlling interests in mobile operations in Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Pakistan. The Myanmar operation was announced sold in 2021, and the transaction completed in March 2022.

Telenor Kystradio is responsible for the infrastructure for maritime radio communication in Norway, and also includes five staffed coast radio stations whose primary purpose is to monitor the maritime radio traffic (over e.g. VHF and MF bands) and to assist marine vessels in distress.

===Research===
Telenor Research is Telenor&#x27;s corporate unit for research. The unit conducts research and delivers research based advice on topics such as market, technology, data analytics, innovation and organization. Telenor Research provides research based analysis and strategic recommendations to the Telenor Group, as well as to the individual Business Units across Telenor markets. Telenor Research&#x27;s mission is to create business value for Telenor through applied research.

===Machine-to-machine===
Telenor started exploring the M2M potentials in 2000, when Telenor R&amp;D established a project both aimed at technology, services and business models. This was further spurred when Telenor acquired the Swedish mobile company Europolitan, which contained parts of Vodafone&#x27;s research capabilities in the area. As a result, two separate companies have been established: Telenor Connexion in Stockholm, Sweden (aiming higher up in the M2M value chain), and Telenor Objects (aiming further down in the value chain). The initiative has resulted in a substantial market share of Europe&#x27;s fast-growing M2M market and is being used by Nissan in Europe to connect its customers&#x27; electric cars.

===Broadcast===
Telenor&#x27;s wholly owned subsidiary Canal Digital is a leading TV content distributor in the Nordic region with about 2.7 million customers in 2011. On 13 April 2021, the merger of Canal Digital and Viasat in Allente was completed.

Telenor also operates the national terrestrial broadcast network in Norway, through its subsidiary Norkring.

Thor is a family of satellites owned by Telenor. On 11 February 2008, the THOR 5 satellite was launched into geostationary orbit. The launch was provided by International Launch Services using a Proton-M launch vehicle built by Khrunichev Space Center. Telenor operates three satellites from its satellite control centre at Fornebu (THOR5, THOR6 and THOR7).

==Former operations==
Telenor has sold a number of divisions after its privatisation, including Bravida, the former installation division and Findexa, now part of Eniro that is responsible for telephone directories. The browser vendor Opera Software originated in Telenor&#x27;s R&amp;D department. Telenor formerly provided a range of services related to satellite communication, including voice, television and data before its Telenor Satellite Services division was purchased by Vizada in 2007.

Telenor has also previously been active in a number of international markets as a mobile phone network operator:

<doc id="70520" wikidata="Q4401396" url="?curid=70520" title="A Fisherman of the Inland Sea">
<text>A Fisherman of the Inland Sea is a 1994 collection of short stories and novellas by the American author Ursula K. Le Guin. The collection was second in the 1995 Locus Award poll in the collection category.

==Contents==
The collection comprises eight works: 
*&quot;The First Contact with the Gorgonids&quot;
*&quot;Newton&#x27;s Sleep&quot;
*&quot;The Ascent of the North Face&quot;
*&quot;The Rock That Changed Things&quot;
*&quot;The Kerastion&quot;
*&quot;The Shobies&#x27; Story&quot;
*&quot;Dancing to Ganam&quot;
*&quot;Another Story or A Fisherman of the Inland Sea&quot;

==Details==

=== The First Contact with the Gorgonids ===
&quot;The First Contact with the Gorgonids&quot; is a running joke within Le Guin&#x27;s work. The stand-alone story is set in present-day Australia, and depicts an arrogant but stupid American man and his downtrodden wife. This strongly feminist story has the couple make contact with aliens who the husband mistakes for Australian Aboriginals. The resulting farce sees the husband put in his place and for the triumphant wife the spoils of the encounter.

=== Newton&#x27;s Sleep ===
In a postcataclysmic earth, society is rebuilt on an orbiting space station in the form of a new Utopia ruled by an elect group of scientists who have established reason as the guiding principle. The story tells of the conflict that arises when a resurgent religion begins.

=== The Ascent of the North Face ===
This story is mock-heroic in character. Told in the style of Victorian Boys Own Ripping Yarns, the joke is in the fact the north face is not of some Himalayan mountain being scaled by westerners but Indian climbers and that the north face refers to the north face of a suburban house in Portland, Oregon near where Le Guin lived.

===The Shobies&#x27; Story===

&quot;The Shobies&#x27; Story&quot; is set in Le Guin&#x27;s Hainish universe, and follows the protagonists of the first successful jump to a planet using Churten theory. They discover that their experience and memories of the planet are radically different. This matters because Churten theory is more philosophical than scientific. The dissonance between their perceptions of the planets creates massive existential rifts in the fabric of space and time. The story tells of the protagonist attempt to reconcile their perceptions of what happened and mend the rift.

===Dancing to Ganam===
&quot;Dancing to Ganam&quot; is also set in the Hainish universe, and forms a sequel to &quot;The Shobies&#x27; Story&quot;.

Two humans (Shan and Tai) from a far future Earth, have arrived on the fictional planet Hain, heroes due to their being crew members of the first faster-than-light space flight, depicted in &quot;The Shobies&#x27; Story&quot;. When they arrive, another Earth human called Dalzul has also arrived. Dalzul is charismatic and diplomatic and known for having saved thousands of children. He has just used the same faster than light technology to travel to a new planet but without the &quot;distortions&quot; of reality found in &quot;The Shobies Story&quot;. When he arrived he found a planet called Ganam, an isolated world inhabited by pre-industrial humans.

Dalzul suggests that they join him on a return flight, Tai declines and Shan accepts. He suggests that during the flight they sing together to synchronize their perceptions of the flight, and this strategy seems to be successful. When they arrive they are honored and Dalzul is treated as a god-king. The longer they stay on the planet however, the more the crew find dissonances in reality causing confusion and uncertainty.
Dalzul is treated as a god and is taken to a ceremony he perceives to be a coronation but at which he is a sacrifice. It turns out that although their flight was successfully without distortions in the perception that plagued the Shobies&#x27; flight, Dalzul&#x27;s ego had shaped his perception of Ganam culture away from reality.

=== Another Story or A Fisherman of the Inland Sea ===
&quot;Another Story or A Fisherman of the Inland Sea&quot; was written by Le Guin in 1994, and is also set in the Hainish universe. The title is a reference to the legend of Urashima Tarō, which is described in the story.

The plot follows a scientist from the fictional planet O who turns his back on the quiet rural life of his planet to join in the development of a faster than light technology called Churten Theory. To do this he leaves for another planet called Hain, a journey that will take a long time and as a result he must say goodbye to everyone and everything he has ever known.

When he arrives there is a message waiting for him which he does not read because it is too garbled. Gripped with a great remorse for what he has left he pours himself into his work and manages to make a massive leap in the understanding of Churten theory, but which unintentionally transports him back to the time and place that he left his home. There he re-establishes his life and relationships that he left behind and lives out his life in his home world. Many years in the future, on the day he would arrive in Hain he sends a message to himself, the garbled message he himself received so many years ago. That message is the story of his life and is itself the content of the story we are reading.
