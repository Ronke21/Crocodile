<text>The Carnegie Medal for Writing, established in 1936 as the Carnegie Medal, is an annual British literary award for English-language books for children or young adults. It is conferred upon the author by the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP), who in 2016 called it &quot;the UK&#x27;s oldest and most prestigious book award for children&#x27;s writing&quot;.

Nominated books must be written in English and first published in the UK during the preceding school year (September to August). Until 1969, the award was limited to books by British authors first published in England. The first non-British medalist was Australian author Ivan Southall for &quot;Josh&quot; (1972). The original rules also prohibited winning authors from future consideration. The first author to win a second Carnegie Medal was Peter Dickinson in 1981, who won consecutively for &quot;Tulku&quot; and &quot;City of Gold&quot;. As of 2024, eight authors had received the Medal more than once.

The winner is awarded a gold medal and £500 worth of books donated to the winner&#x27;s chosen library. In addition, since 2016 the winner has received a £5,000 cash prize from the Colin Mears bequest.

== History ==
The Medal is named after the Scottish-born American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie (1835–1919), who founded more than 2,800 libraries in the English-speaking world, including at least one in more than half of British library authorities. It was established in 1936 by the British Library Association, to celebrate the centenary of Carnegie&#x27;s birth, and inaugurated in 1937 with the award to Arthur Ransome for &quot;Pigeon Post&quot; (1936) and the identification of two &quot;commended&quot; books. This first Medal was dated 1936, but since 2007 the award has been dated by its year of presentation, not year of publication.

In 1955, the Kate Greenaway Medal, for &quot;distinguished illustration in a book for children&quot;, was established as a companion to the Carnegie Medal.

Both awards were established and administered by the Library Association, which was succeeded by the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) in 2002. In 2022, the two awards were renamed to the Carnegie Medal for Writing and the Carnegie Medal for Illustration.

From 2022 to 2024, the award was sponsored by the audio technology company Yoto and was called the Yoto Carnegie Medal for Writing. As of 2025 the awards are sponsored by Scholastic and the Authors&#x27; Licensing and Collecting Society (ALCS).

== Process ==

CILIP members may nominate books each September and October, with the full list of valid nominations published in November. The longlist, chosen by the judges from the nominated books, is published in February. The judging panel comprises 12 children&#x27;s librarians, all of whom are members of CILIP&#x27;s Youth Libraries Group (YLG). The shortlist is announced in March and the winner in June.

Titles must be English-language works first published in the UK during the preceding year (1 September to 31 August). According to CILIP, &quot;all categories of books, including poetry, non-fiction and graphic novels, in print or ebook format, for children and young people are eligible&quot;. Multiple-author anthologies are excluded; however, co-authored single works are eligible.

Young people from across the UK take part in shadowing groups organised by secondary schools and public libraries, to read and discuss the shortlisted books.

CILIP instructs the judging panel to consider plot, characterisation, and style. Furthermore, it states that &quot;the book that wins the Carnegie Medal should be a book of outstanding literary quality. The whole work should provide pleasure, not merely from the surface enjoyment of a good read, but also the deeper subconscious satisfaction of having gone through a vicarious, but at the time of reading, a real experience that is retained afterwards.&quot;

A diversity review in 2018 led to changes in the nomination and judging process to promote better representation of ethnic minority authors and books.

== 2024 award ==
Joseph Coelho won the 2024 Carnegie Medal for &quot;The Boy Lost in the Maze&quot;, a verse novel that uses the legend of the Minotaur in a tale of a teenager searching for his biological father. 

There were eight books on the 2024 shortlist:

*Kwame Alexander, &quot;The Door of No Return&quot; (Andersen)
*Zillah Bethell, &quot;The Song Walker&quot; (Usborne)
*Sophie Cameron, &quot;Away with Words&quot; (Little Tiger)
*Joseph Coelho, illus. by Kate Milner, &quot;The Boy Lost in the Maze&quot; (Otter-Barry Books)
*Nicola Davies, illus. by Petr Horáček, &quot;Choose Love&quot; (Graffeg)
*Tia Fisher, &quot;Crossing the Line&quot; (Bonnier) Winner of the Shadowers choice
*Hiba Noor Khan, &quot;Safiyyah&#x27;s War&quot; (Andersen)
*Nathanael Lessore, &quot;Steady for This&quot; (Bonnier)

==Winners==
As of 2024, 85 Medals have been awarded over 88 years, spanning the period from 1936 to 2024. No eligible book published in 1943, 1945, or 1966 was considered suitable by the judging panel.

From 2007 onward, the medals are dated by the year of presentation. Prior to this, they were dated by the calendar year of their British publication.

Forty-one winning books were illustrated in their first editions, including every one during the first three decades. Six from 1936 to 1953 were illustrated or co-illustrated by their authors; none since then.
==Carnegie of Carnegies==

To commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Carnegie Medal in 2007, CILIP created a &#x27;Living Archive&#x27; on the Carnegie Medal website with information about each of the winning books and conducted a poll to identify the nation&#x27;s favourite Carnegie Medal winner, to be named the &quot;Carnegie of Carnegies&quot;. The winner, announced on 21 June 2007 at the British Library, was &quot;Northern Lights&quot; by Philip Pullman (1995). It was the expected winner, garnering 40% of the votes in the UK, and 36% worldwide.

70th Anniversary Top Ten
* David Almond, &quot;Skellig&quot;, (Hodder, 1998)
* Melvin Burgess, &quot;Junk&quot;, (Penguin, 1996)
* Kevin Crossley-Holland, &quot;Storm&quot;, (Egmont, 1985)
* Jennifer Donnelly, &quot;A Gathering Light&quot;, (Bloomsbury, 2003)
* Alan Garner, &quot;The Owl Service&quot;, (HarperCollins, 1967)
* Eve Garnett, &quot;The Family from One End Street&quot;, (Penguin, 1937)
* Mary Norton, &quot;The Borrowers&quot;, (Penguin, 1952)
* Philippa Pearce, &quot;Tom&#x27;s Midnight Garden&quot;, (Oxford, 1958)
* Philip Pullman, &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, (Scholastic, 1995)
* Robert Westall, &quot;The Machine Gunners&quot;, (Macmillan, 1975)

&quot;Northern Lights&quot;, with 40% of the public vote, was followed by 16% for &quot;Tom&#x27;s Midnight Garden&quot; by Philippa Pearce and 8% for &quot;Skellig&quot; by David Almond. As those three books had won the 70-year-old Medal in its year 60, year 23, and year 63, some commentary observed that &quot;Tom&#x27;s Midnight Garden&quot; had passed a test of time that the others had not yet faced.

== Honorees ==
Prior to 2007, the award year matched books&#x27; year of publication with selection announced and medals presented early the following year.

=== 1930s ===
=== 1940s ===
=== 1950s ===
=== 1960s ===
=== 1970s ===
=== 1980s ===
=== 1990s ===
=== 2000s ===
Beginning in 2003, commendations were not presented, only short and longlists; only the shortlists are presented below.
=== 2010s ===
=== 2020s ===
== Repeat honorees ==
Eight authors have won two Carnegie Medals, which was prohibited for many years. Additionally, several authors have been shortlisted and/or commended multiple times.

The table below provides a list of authors who have been honoured, sorted first by number of honors and the rank of the honor (e.g., win is higher than commendation), then by the authors&#x27; last name. For the sake of ease, shortlists are considered of equal rank to commendations, though lower than high commendations. The table was last updated in March 2024.
== Multiple award recipients ==
Six books have won both the Carnegie Medal and the annual Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize, which was inaugurated 1967.(Dates are years of U.K. publication, and Carnegie award dates before 2006.)
* Alan Garner, &quot;The Owl Service&quot; (1967)
* Richard Adams, &quot;Watership Down&quot; (1972)
* Geraldine McCaughrean, &quot;A Pack of Lies&quot; (1988)
* Anne Fine, &quot;Goggle-Eyes&quot; (1989)
* Philip Pullman, &quot;His Dark Materials 1: Northern Lights&quot; (1995)
* Melvin Burgess, &quot;Junk&quot; (1996)

Only &quot;A Monster Calls&quot;, written by Patrick Ness and illustrated by Jim Kay, has won both the Carnegie and Greenaway Medals (2012).

Only &quot;The Graveyard Book&quot; by Neil Gaiman (2009) has won both the Carnegie Medal and the equivalent American award, the Newbery Medal.

Sharon Creech, who won the Carnegie for &quot;Ruby Holler&quot; (2002), previously won the Newbery and two U.K. awards for &quot;Walk Two Moons&quot; (1994).
Four writers have won both the Carnegie and the US Michael L. Printz Award. The Printz Award is an American Library Association literary award that annually recognises the &quot;best book written for teens, based entirely on its literary merit&quot;. The four writers are David Almond, Aidan Chambers, Geraldine McCaughrean, and Meg Rosoff. Chambers alone has won both for the same book, the 1999 Carnegie and 2003 Printz for the novel &quot;Postcards from No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;.

In its scope, books for children or young adults, the British Carnegie corresponds to the American Newbery and Printz awards.

<doc id="70117" wikidata="Q193110" url="?curid=70117" title="Floodplain">
<text>A floodplain or flood plain or bottomlands is an area of land adjacent to a river. Floodplains stretch from the banks of a river channel to the base of the enclosing valley, and experience flooding during periods of high discharge. The soils usually consist of clays, silts, sands, and gravels deposited during floods.

Because of regular flooding, floodplains frequently have high soil fertility since nutrients are deposited with the flood waters. This can encourage farming; some important agricultural regions, such as the Nile and Mississippi river basins, heavily exploit floodplains. Agricultural and urban regions have developed near or on floodplains to take advantage of the rich soil and freshwater. However, the risk of inundation has led to increasing efforts to control flooding.

==Formation==
Most floodplains are formed by deposition on the inside of river meanders and by overbank flow.

Wherever the river meanders, the flowing water erodes the river bank on the outside of the meander. At the same time, sediments are simultaneously deposited in a bar on the inside of the meander. This is described as &quot;lateral accretion&quot; since the deposition builds the point bar laterally into the river channel. Erosion on the outside of the meander usually closely balances deposition on the inside so that the channel shifts in the direction of the meander without changing significantly in width. The point bar is built up to a level very close to that of the river banks. Significant net erosion of sediments occurs only when the meander cuts into higher ground. The overall effect is that, as the river meanders, it creates a level flood plain composed mostly of point bar deposits. The rate at which the channel shifts varies greatly, with reported rates ranging from too slow to measure to as much as per year for the Kosi River of India.

Overbank flow takes place when the river is flooded with more water than can be accommodated by the river channel. Flow over the banks of the river deposits a thin veneer of sediments that is coarsest and thickest close to the channel. This is described as &quot;vertical accretion&quot;, since the deposits build upwards. In undisturbed river systems, overbank flow is frequent, typically occurring every one to two years, regardless of climate or topography. Sedimentation rates for a three-day flood of the Meuse and Rhine Rivers in 1993 found average sedimentation rates in the floodplain of between 0.57 and 1.0 kg/m2. Higher rates were found on the levees (4 kg/m2 or more) and on low-lying areas (1.6 kg/m2).

Sedimentation from the overbank flow is concentrated on natural levees, crevasse splays, and in wetlands and shallow lakes of flood basins. Natural levees are ridges along river banks that form from rapid deposition from the overbank flow. Most of the suspended sand is deposited on the levees, leaving the silt and clay sediments to be deposited as floodplain mud further from the river. Levees are typically built up enough to be relatively well-drained compared with nearby wetlands, and levees in non-arid climates are often heavily vegetated.

Crevasses are formed by breakout events from the main river channel. The river bank fails, and floodwaters scour a channel. Sediments from the crevasse spread out as delta-shaped deposits with numerous distributary channels. Crevasse formation is most common in sections of rivers where the river bed is accumulating sediments (aggrading).

Repeated flooding eventually builds up an alluvial ridge, whose natural levees and abandoned meander loops may stand well above most of the floodplain. The alluvial ridge is topped by a channel belt formed by successive generations of channel migration and meander cutoff. At much longer intervals, the river may abandon the channel belt and build a new one at another position on the floodplain. This process is called avulsion and occurs at intervals of 10–1000 years. Historical avulsions leading to catastrophic flooding include the 1855 Yellow River flood and the 2008 Kosi River flood.

Floodplains can form around rivers of any kind or size. Even relatively straight stretches of river are capable of producing floodplains. Mid-channel bars in braided rivers migrate downstream through processes resembling those in point bars of meandering rivers and can build up a floodplain.

The quantity of sediments in a floodplain greatly exceeds the river load of sediments. Thus, floodplains are an important storage site for sediments during their transport from where they are generated to their ultimate depositional environment.

When the rate at which the river is cutting downwards becomes great enough that overbank flows become infrequent, the river is said to have abandoned its floodplain. Portions of the abandoned floodplain may be preserved as fluvial terraces.

==Ecology ==
Floodplains support diverse and productive ecosystems. They are characterized by considerable variability in space and time, which in turn produces some of the most species-rich of ecosystems. From the ecological perspective, the most distinctive aspect of floodplains is the &quot;flood pulse&quot; associated with annual floods, and so the floodplain ecosystem is defined as the part of the river valley that is regularly flooded and dried.

Floods bring in detrital material rich in nutrients and release nutrients from dry soil as it is flooded. The decomposition of terrestrial plants submerged by the floodwaters adds to the nutrient supply. The flooded littoral zone of the river (the zone closest to the river bank) provides an ideal environment for many aquatic species, so the spawning season for fish often coincides with the onset of flooding. Fish must grow quickly during the flood to survive the subsequent drop in water level. As the floodwaters recede, the littoral experiences blooms of microorganisms, while the banks of the river dry out and terrestrial plants germinate to stabilize the bank.
The biota of floodplains has high annual growth and mortality rates, which is advantageous for the rapid colonization of large areas of the floodplain. This allows them to take advantage of shifting floodplain geometry. For example, floodplain trees are fast-growing and tolerant of root disturbance. Opportunists (such as birds) are attracted to the rich food supply provided by the flood pulse.

Floodplain ecosystems have distinct biozones. In Europe, as one moves away from the river, the successive plant communities are bank vegetation (usually annuals); sedge and reeds; willow shrubs; willow-poplar forest; oak-ash forest; and broadleaf forest. Human disturbance creates wet meadows that replace much of the original ecosystem. The biozones reflect a soil moisture and oxygen gradient that in turn corresponds to a flooding frequency gradient. The primeval floodplain forests of Europe were dominated by oak (60%) elm (20%) and hornbeam (13%), but human disturbance has shifted the makeup towards ash (49%) with maple increasing to 14% and oak decreasing to 25%.

Semiarid floodplains have a much lower species diversity. Species are adapted to alternating drought and flood. Extreme drying can destroy the ability of the floodplain ecosystem to shift to a healthy wet phase when flooded.

Floodplain forests constituted 1% of the landscape of Europe in the 1800s. Much of this has been cleared by human activity, though floodplain forests have been impacted less than other kinds of forests. This makes them important refugia for biodiversity. Human destruction of floodplain ecosystems is largely a result of flood control, hydroelectric development (such as reservoirs), and conversion of floodplains to agriculture use. Transportation and waste disposal also have detrimental effects. The result is the fragmentation of these ecosystems, resulting in loss of populations and diversity and endangering the remaining fragments of the ecosystem. Flood control creates a sharper boundary between water and land than in undisturbed floodplains, reducing physical diversity. Floodplain forests protect waterways from erosion and pollution and reduce the impact of floodwaters.

The disturbance by humans of temperate floodplain ecosystems frustrates attempts to understand their natural behavior. Tropical rivers are less impacted by humans and provide models for temperate floodplain ecosystems, which are thought to share many of their ecological attributes.

==Flood control==

Excluding famines and epidemics, some of the worst natural disasters in history (measured by fatalities) have been river floods, particularly in the Yellow River in China – see list of deadliest floods. The worst of these, and the worst natural disaster (excluding famine and epidemics), was the 1931 China floods, estimated to have killed millions. This had been preceded by the 1887 Yellow River flood, which killed around one million people and is the second-worst natural disaster in history.

The extent of floodplain inundation depends partly on flood magnitude, defined by the return period.

In the United States, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) manages the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP offers insurance to properties located within a flood-prone area, as defined by the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), which depicts various flood risks for a community. The FIRM typically focuses on the delineation of the 100-year flood inundation area, also known within the NFIP as the Special Flood Hazard Area.

Where a detailed study of a waterway has been done, the 100-year floodplain will also include the floodway, the critical portion of the floodplain which includes the stream channel and any adjacent areas that must be kept free of encroachments that might block flood flows or restrict storage of flood waters. Another commonly encountered term is the Special Flood Hazard Area, which is any area subject to inundation by a 100-year flood. A problem is that any alteration of the watershed upstream of the point in question can potentially affect the ability of the watershed to handle water, and thus potentially affects the levels of the periodic floods. A large shopping center and parking lot, for example, may raise the levels of 5-year, 100-year, and other floods, but the maps are rarely adjusted and are frequently rendered obsolete by subsequent development.

In order for a flood-prone property to qualify for government-subsidized insurance, a local community must adopt an ordinance that protects the floodway and requires that new residential structures built in Special Flood Hazard Areas be elevated to at least the level of the 100-year flood. Commercial structures can be elevated or floodproofed to or above this level. In some areas without detailed study information, structures may be required to be elevated to at least two feet above the surrounding grade. Many State and local governments have, in addition, adopted floodplain construction regulations which are more restrictive than those mandated by the NFIP. The US government also sponsors flood hazard mitigation efforts to reduce flood impacts. California&#x27;s Hazard Mitigation Program is one funding source for mitigation projects. A number of whole towns such as English, Indiana, have been completely relocated to remove them from the floodplain. Other smaller-scale mitigation efforts include acquiring and demolishing flood-prone buildings or flood-proofing them.

In some floodplains, such as the Inner Niger Delta of Mali, annual flooding events are a natural part of the local ecology and rural economy, allowing for the raising of crops through recessional agriculture. However, in Bangladesh, which occupies the Ganges Delta, the advantages provided by the richness of the alluvial soil of the floodplain are severely offset by frequent floods brought on by cyclones and annual monsoon rains. These extreme weather events cause severe economic disruption and loss of human life in the densely-populated region.
== Floodplain soils ==

=== Oxygen in floodplain soils ===
Floodplain soil composition is unique and varies widely based on microtopography. Floodplain forests have high topographic heterogeneity which creates variation in localized hydrologic conditions. Soil moisture within the upper 30 cm of the soil profile also varies widely based on microtopography, which affects oxygen availability. Floodplain soil stays aerated for long periods in between flooding events, but during flooding, saturated soil can become oxygen-depleted if it stands stagnant for long enough. More soil oxygen is available at higher elevations farther from the river. Floodplain forests generally experience alternating periods of aerobic and anaerobic soil microbe activity, affecting fine root development and desiccation.

=== Phosphorus cycling in floodplain soils ===
Floodplains have high buffering capacity for phosphorus to prevent nutrient loss to river outputs. Phosphorus nutrient loading is a problem in freshwater systems. Much of the phosphorus in freshwater systems comes from municipal wastewater treatment plants and agricultural runoff. Stream connectivity controls whether phosphorus cycling is mediated by floodplain sediments or by external processes. Under conditions of stream connectivity, phosphorus is better able to be cycled, and sediments and nutrients are more readily retained. Water in freshwater streams ends up in either short-term storage in plants or algae or long-term in sediments. Wet/dry cycling within the floodplain greatly impacts phosphorus availability because it alters water level, redox state, pH, and physical properties of minerals. Dry soils that were previously inundated have reduced availability of phosphorus and increased affinity for obtaining phosphorus. Human floodplain alterations also impact the phosphorus cycle. Particulate phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) can contribute to algal blooms and toxicity in waterways when the nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios are altered farther upstream. In areas where the phosphorus load is primarily particulate phosphorus, like the Mississippi River, the most effective ways of removing phosphorus upstream are sedimentation, soil accretion, and burial. In basins where SRP is the primary form of phosphorus, biological uptake in floodplain forests is the best way of removing nutrients. Phosphorus can transform between SRP and particulate phosphorus depending on ambient conditions or processes like decomposition, biological uptake, redoximorphic release, and sedimentation and accretion. In either phosphorus form, floodplain forests are beneficial as phosphorus sinks, and the human-caused disconnect between floodplains and rivers exacerbates the phosphorus overload.

=== Environmental pollutants in floodplain soils ===
Floodplain soils tend to be high in eco-pollutants, especially persistent organic pollutant (POP) deposition. Proper understanding of the distribution of soil contaminants is complex because of high variation in microtopography and soil texture within floodplains.

<text>The Constitution of the Kingdom of the Netherlands of 24 August 1815 () is one of two fundamental documents governing the Kingdom of the Netherlands as well as the fundamental law of the Netherlands proper (the territory of the Kingdom mainly situated in Europe). The Kingdom of the Netherlands also includes Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten: there is an overarching instrument of the entire kingdom that has constitution characteristics: the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Sint Maarten is the only country in the Kingdom of the Netherlands that has a constitutional court to govern the Sint Maarten legislature.

The constitution of the Netherlands is only applicable to the Netherlands proper, i.e. the territory in Europe and its public bodies of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, the latter three since 2010 special municipalities, in the Caribbean, except when the Charter does not cover a certain legal subject. It is generally seen as directly derived from the one issued in 1815, constituting a constitutional monarchy; it is the third oldest constitution still in use worldwide. A revision in 1848 instituted a system of parliamentary democracy. In 1983, the most recent major revision of the Constitution of the Netherlands was undertaken, almost fully rewriting the text and adding new civil rights. 

The text is sober, devoid of legal or political doctrine and includes a bill of rights. It prohibits the judiciary from testing laws and treaties against the constitution, as this is considered a prerogative of the legislature. There is no constitutional court in the Netherlands.

==History==

The first constitution of the Netherlands as a whole, in the sense of a fundamental law which applied to all its provinces and cities, is the 1579 constitution, which established the confederal Dutch Republic. The constitution was empowered by the Union of Utrecht, thus by treaty. Article XIII of the treaty granted each inhabitant of the Republic freedom of conscience.

After the French invasion of 1794 the Batavian Republic, a unitary state, was proclaimed. On 31 January 1795 it issued a bill of rights, the &#x27;. On 1 May 1798 a new constitution, the first in the modern formal sense, the &#x27;, written by a Constituent Assembly, went into force, approved by the National Assembly. The Napoleonic Kingdom of Holland, a constitutional monarchy, was established by the &quot;&quot; on 7 August 1806. In 1810 the kingdom was annexed by the French Empire.

===Establishment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands===
After the French troops had been driven out by Russian Cossacks, the new Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands, was established by the constitution of 29 March 1814, the &quot;Grondwet van den Staat der Verëenigde Nederlanden&quot;. William VI of Orange, instated on 2 December 1813 as &quot;Sovereign Prince&quot; by acclamation, and only accepting &quot;under the safeguard of a free constitution, assuring your freedom against possible future abuses&quot;, had first appointed 600 men of good standing as electors (Assembly of Notables) and these approved the constitution, written by a commission headed by Gijsbert Karel van Hogendorp. On 24 August 1815 William — since 16 March King William I of the Netherlands — having proclaimed himself King of the larger United Netherlands six days earlier, issued the first version of the current constitution, the &#x27; or &#x27;, establishing the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, now expanding his realm with the territory of the present state of Belgium, which would again secede from it in 1830. It included a limited unentrenched bill of rights, with freedom of religion, the principle of habeas corpus, the right of petition and freedom of the press as its main points. In the Treaty of London of 1814 the Allies had ordered that the original Dutch state would devise the new constitution. It had been approved by the new States General (consisting of 55 members) of the Northern Netherlands, but rejected by the majority of appointed electors (796 against 527) of the Southern Netherlands. As 126, however, had indicated that they were against because of the (by them still considered too limited) freedom of religion, which was mandatory under the Treaty of Vienna that ordered the union of the Northern and the Southern Netherlands, their votes and those of the men having refused to vote, were added to the minority, and by this infamous &quot;Hollandic Arithmetic&quot; William felt justified to proclaim the new kingdom.

Regarding the government&#x27;s political structure the 1815 constitution did not diverge much from the situation during the Republic: the 110 members of House of Representatives (lower house) of the States General, the &quot;Second Chamber&quot; as it is still called, were still appointed by the States-Provincial (for three years; each year a third was replaced), who themselves were filled with nobility members or appointed by the city councils, just like under the ancien régime. However, now also some rural delegates were appointed to all States-Provincial (first only true for Friesland) and the city councils were appointed by electoral colleges which were in turn elected by a select group of male citizens of good standing and paying a certain amount of taxes, so indirectly there was a modicum of democracy introduced to the system. Generally, however, the administration was monarchical, with the king appointing for life the members of the Senate, the &quot;First Chamber&quot;, that mockingly was called the &quot;&quot;. In 1840, when a new revision was made necessary by the independence of Belgium, a first step to a more parliamentary system was taken by the introduction of penal ministerial responsibility.

===Constitutional Reform of 1848===
The constitution as it was revised on 11 October 1848 is often described as the original of the version still in force today. Under pressure from the Revolutions of 1848 in surrounding countries, King William II accepted the introduction of full ministerial responsibility in the constitution, leading to a system of parliamentary democracy, with the House of Representatives directly elected by the voters within a system of single-winner electoral districts. Parliament was accorded the right to amend government bills and to hold investigative hearings. The States-Provincial, themselves elected by voters, appointed by majorities for each province the members of the Senate from a select group of upper class citizens. A commission chaired by Johan Rudolph Thorbecke was appointed to draft the new proposed constitution, which was finished on 19 June. Suffrage was expanded (though still limited to census suffrage), as was the bill of rights with the freedom of assembly, the privacy of correspondence, freedom of ecclesiastical organisation and the freedom of education.

===Expansion of suffrage===

In 1884 there was a minor revision. In 1887 the census suffrage system was replaced by one based on minimal wealth and education, which allowed an ever-growing share of the male population to be given the right to vote; therefore this provision was at the time nicknamed the &quot;caoutchouc-article&quot;. The election interval for the House of Representatives was changed from two (with half of it replaced) to four years (with full a replacement of now hundred members). Eligibility for the Senate was broadened. Any penal measure not based on formal law was prohibited.

In 1917, like in 1848 influenced by the tense international situation, universal manhood suffrage was introduced combined with a system of proportional representation to elect the House of Representatives, the States-Provincial and the municipality councils. The Senate continued to be elected by the States-Provincial, but now also employing a system of proportional representation, no longer by majorities per province. The Christian democratic parties agreed to universal manhood suffrage in exchange for a complete constitutional equality in state funding between public and denominational schools, thus ending the school struggle. By the revision of 1922 universal suffrage was explicitly adopted in the constitution, after it had already been introduced by law in 1919. Each three years, half of the members of the Senate were to be elected by the States-Provincial for a period of six years, using a system of proportional representation.

===Later revisions===
In 1938 there was a minor revision, introducing some elements of the then fashionable corporatism by giving a constitutional base to public bodies regulating sectors of the economy. A proposal to make it possible to impeach &quot;revolutionary&quot; members of representative bodies, directed against communists and fascists, failed to get a two-thirds majority.

After World War II in 1946 a revision failed attempting to simplify the revisional procedure. However, a change was accepted allowing to send conscripts to the colonial war in the Dutch East Indies. In the revision of 1948 a complete new chapter was added to facilitate the incorporation of the new state of Indonesia within the Kingdom under the Netherlands-Indonesia Union. Soon it would become irrelevant as Indonesia severed all ties with the Netherlands in 1954. The revision also created the office of secretary of state, a kind of junior minister but one fully subordinate to a certain minister. In 1953 new articles were introduced concerning international relations, as the Netherlands was abandoning its old policy of strict neutrality. In the revision of 1956 the constitution was changed to accommodate the full independence of Indonesia. The number of members of the House of Representatives members was brought up to 150, of Senate members to 75. The revision of 1963 accommodated the loss of Dutch New Guinea to Indonesia. The voting age was lowered from 23 to 21. In 1972 there was a minor revision; the main change was a lowering of the voting age to 18.

In 1983 the constitution was almost entirely rewritten. Many articles were abolished. Social rights were included, most articles were reformulated (the main exception being article 23 about the still sensitive freedom of education) using a new uniform legal terminology and their sequence was changed. The bill of rights was expanded with a prohibition of discrimination, a prohibition of the death penalty, a general freedom of expression, the freedom of demonstration and a general right to privacy.

In 1987 there was a minor revision. In the revision of 1995 the introduction of a professional army, replacing the conscript army, was regulated. In the revision of 1999 a proposal to introduce an advisory referendum was rejected by the Senate. After a minor revision in 2002, the last changes were made in 2005; a proposal to introduce an elected mayor was rejected by the Senate.

==Revision==

There are substantial safeguards to prevent carefree revision of the constitution. A revision of the constitution is submitted to both chambers of the States General, the House of Representatives and the Senate where the proposed revision has to pass with a (normal) majority. The proposed revision needs to be subsequently be supported by both chambers with a 2/3 majority, after general elections for the house of representatives (in practice most revision are submitted shortly before planned elections). The general elections and the new house of representatives guarantees citizens can indirectly vote for or against a revision.

==Content==
===Systematics and terminology===
Civil law systems are characterized by their emphasis on abstract rules and methodology. Since the Second World War there has been a dominant movement within the Dutch legal community to be fully consistent in this and incorporate the total of case law accumulated over the years, while the old law books derived from the French Code Napoleon remained basically unchanged, into a completely new set of modern codes. There has been a general tendency to strive for economy of style, clarity of expression, conceptual coherence and unity of terminology. The complete revision of the Dutch constitution in 1983 is part of this process. Combined with an absence of explicit legal doctrine the result can be deceptive, as the simple phrasing hides the underlying implicit doctrine.

Because there is no Constitutional Court testing laws and acts against the constitution, much of the systematics are centered on the problem of delegation. If the legislative were allowed to delegate its powers to the government or to lower decentralized bodies, this would threaten democratic legitimacy and the constitutional protection of the citizen (as citizens have no recourse to a Constitutional Court). Therefore, delegation is only allowed if articles contain the terms &quot;regulate&quot; or &quot;by force of law&quot;; otherwise it is forbidden. This rule itself, however, being legal doctrine, is not explicitly included anywhere within the written law and is only found in the official commission reports and ministerial commentaries accompanying the bill.

===Chapters===
====Chapter 1: Basic rights====
Chapter 1 is mainly a bill of rights. There is no normative hierarchy indicated by the constitution: all basic rights are principally equal in value and importance. Some rights are absolute, most can be limited by parliamentary or &quot;formal&quot; law, many can be limited by delegation of limiting powers. They include:
* Equality before the law and prohibition of discrimination (Article 1). This article forbids any discrimination on any grounds but allows affirmative action. This right can only be limited by law, if there is an objective, reasonable justification for restricting it. In that case, the court will decide if the law is suitable, necessary and in proportion to reach the purpose of the law. 
* Nationality, citizenship and right to reside in the country (including extradition) is specified in article 2.
* Right to be appointed to a public function and to hold multiple nationalities is specified in article 3.
*The right to vote (Article 4). The right can be limited by formal law; no delegation is allowed.
*The right of (written) petition (Article 5). This ancient right is absolute and cannot be limited by law. The right of petition has a long tradition in the Netherlands; indeed the Dutch War of Independence started after a petition had been rejected by the Habsburg authorities, the noble petitioners having been contemptuously treated as &quot;beggars&quot; (&quot;Geuzen&quot;). The constitution of 1815 limited the ancient right to written petitions, hoping to curtail the typical disorder created by large groups of delegates. Nevertheless, such public mass petitioning has always remained very popular. The right of petition does not imply an accompanying right to be answered, but in practice all public bodies have special commissions to do just that. Often petitions are directed to the King, although the system of ministerial responsibility makes it impossible for him to take action by himself; his secretarial cabinet relegates such petitions to the relevant ministries.
*Freedom of religion (Article 6). This right can be limited by formal law; delegation is possible.
*Freedom of speech (Article 7). This article has only been partially changed in the 1983 revision, as it was linked to very complicated case law. Subarticle 1 contains the classic freedom of the press. Any censorship is absolutely forbidden. However, formal law can otherwise limit this freedom, e.g. by making a certain content punishable under penal law. Such limiting powers cannot be delegated to lower administrative bodies such as municipalities; the related right of distribution of printed materials can similarly only be limited by formal law. However, the Supreme Court has nevertheless ruled since 1950 that such bodies may in fact limit the distribution of materials, if such a limitation is not based on the content of those materials and does not imply a complete impediment to any separate means of distribution. They may for instance limit the spreading of pamphlets to certain hours for reasons of public order. Subarticle 2 has the same arrangement for television and radio broadcasts. Subarticle 3, added in 1983, gives a general right of expression, for those cases where neither printed nor broadcast information is involved; this includes the freedom of speech. Again, no censorship is ever allowed, but the right can otherwise be limited by formal law; explicitly mentioned in subarticle 3 is the possibility to limit the viewing of movies by minors under the age of sixteen. Although no delegation is possible, lower bodies may limit the exercise of the right for reasons of public order if such limitations are not based on the content of the expressed views. Subarticle 4 states that commercial advertising is not protected by article 7. The Dutch constitution does not contain a freedom of gathering of information.
*Freedom of association (Article 8). This right can be limited by formal law, but only to safeguard public order. No delegation is allowed. Almost any organization posing any conceivable danger to public order in the broadest sense is forbidden by the still extant &quot;Wet vereniging en vergadering&quot; (&quot;Law of association and assembly&quot;) of 1855, but this law only very rarely leads to an official disbandment of an organization as a legal entity under the civil code. Dutch legal doctrine holds that the freedom of association does not protect against forced membership of organizations, e.g. when such membership is a condition for being active in a certain profession.
*Freedom of assembly and freedom of demonstration (Article 9). The revision of 1983 split the old combination of &quot;freedom of assembly and association&quot; and added the former to a new freedom of demonstration. The right can be limited by formal law. Delegation is allowed but only to protect public health, for traffic concerns and to prevent public disorder.

These first eight rights (excluding present Article 8) were the only ones present in the original 1815 document. The remainder were added starting in the 20th century.

*Right to privacy (Article 10). This right, introduced by the revision of 1983, is a general right to be protected whenever the personal integrity is threatened. The right can be limited by formal law. Delegation is allowed, but only in relation to databases. The article imposes a duty on the government to protect against a threat to privacy posed by a possible abuse of databases (subarticle 2); and to regulate the right of persons to be informed about the content of such databases concerning their person and the right to improve possible mistakes in such content (subarticle 3).
*Inviolence of the (human) body (Article 11). This right, introduced by the revision of 1983, can be limited by formal law; delegation is allowed. The right is a subspecies of the general right to personal integrity expressed in article 10, so no dichotomy is intended between the two concepts. It protects against violations like forced medical experiments, corporal punishment, torture and mutilation. It does not end with death and thus demands a legal basis for organ donation.
*Prohibition of unlawful entry of the home when no permission of the inhabitant has been obtained (Article 12). Although often presented as a general &quot;right of the home&quot;, this article is in fact more based on the principle that the authorities do have a fundamental right to enter homes, but that this must be given a legal basis. The law has to indicate in which case and by which persons entry is legal. Delegation is allowed. Dutch courts tend to give precedence to the practicality of police investigation, so this article has had little protective value.
*Secrecy of communication (Article 13). Subarticle 1 contains the privacy of correspondence. This can only be violated on order of a judge and only in those cases indicated by formal law. No delegation is allowed. The judge in question is rarely a court but in practice the investigative judge (&quot;rechter-commissaris&quot;). The Dutch penal code offers a further protection of this right as several types of violating it are punishable as crimes. Subarticle 2 contains the privacy of communication by telephone and telegraph. This right can be limited by law; such law has to indicate which persons have the authority to allow a violation. No delegation is allowed. For most cases again the investigative judge has the competent authority. Since the nineties there is doctrinal consensus that the right extends to cell phone communication, but earlier this was contended. 
*Prohibition of unlawful expropriation (Article 14). The Dutch constitution contains no general right to property. This has been defended by successive governments with the argument that such right is so fundamental to Dutch society that it is redundant to explicitly mention it. Expropriation is only allowed to serve the public interest and on the condition that prior formal assurance is given of (full) indemnity, meaning that some exact sum has to be determined. It has to be based on law; delegation is allowed, but only as regards the indemnity determination procedure, not the expropriation as such. Subarticle 2 states, however, that in an emergency situation the prior assurance has not to be given — in those cases the amount of compensation will be determined later. Subarticle 3 extends this arrangement to cases of destruction, partial damage, total loss and limitations of the right to property, caused by the competent authority to serve the public interest. Normal cases of damage are ruled by the civil code.
*Right to liberty (Article 15). This right can be limited by formal law. Delegation is allowed since the revision of 1983. Subarticle 2 safeguards access to the competent judge for anyone detained; this judge has the power to order the release of the detainee, like in the common law habeas corpus doctrine. In fact all relevant laws order the authorities to obtain approval from the judge within a certain time limit, but deny to the detainee access by his own initiative until that limit has been reached. Subarticle 3 contains the penal law obligation of the authorities to ensure that a trial takes place and is finished within a reasonable period of time. This right cannot be limited by law. In fact the Dutch penal code contains loopholes making it possible to delay trials indefinitely. Subarticle 4 states that all basic rights of a detainee can be limited in the interest of his detention.
*Nulla poena sine praevia lege (Article 16). This fundamental principle of legality (which requires that one cannot be punished for doing something that is not prohibited by law), already present in the penal code and introduced to the constitution in the revision of 1983, is absolute and cannot be limited by law. However, at the same time, the additional article IX was added to the constitution making an exception for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
*Ius de non evocando (Article 17). This ancient right states that no one can against his will be kept from the competent court. It cannot be limited by law — but law decides which court is competent.

In addition to these classic rights the revision of 1983 introduced a number of social rights. The distinction between the two categories is not strictly based on any legal doctrine and in fact the social right articles contain many freedom rights. The social rights are:

*Right to counsel (Article 18). Subarticle 1 contains a freedom right: anyone has the right to be legally assisted or represented in court or during administrative appeal. This right is absolute and cannot be limited by law. Nevertheless, the law may impose qualification requirements on legal representatives so that e.g. only attorneys are allowed to represent. Subarticle 2 contains the right to legal aid for the destitute. The right can be limited by formal law; delegation is allowed. However, doctrine holds that the State has an absolute duty to provide a minimum of legal aid.
*Labour rights (Article 19). Subarticle 1 imposes a duty on the government to ensure sufficient employment. This does not imply a right to be employed for the individual. Subarticle 2 demands that laws are made regarding the legal position of workers, including the protection of workers against accidents and workers&#x27; participation. Subarticle 3 contains a general freedom right to labour. This right can be limited by formal law; delegation is allowed. The right is limited to those of Dutch nationality, so in principle foreign nationals can be denied access to the labour market. The law in fact denies such access to illegal immigrants and asylum seekers.
*Welfare of the people (Article 20). Subarticle 1 imposes a duty upon the government to ensure the subsistence of the population and an adequate distribution of wealth. Subarticle 2 demands that laws are made concerning the entitlements to social welfare. Delegation is allowed. Subarticle 3 contains a right to welfare for the destitute. The right can be limited by formal law; delegation is allowed. The government has a duty to make a law implementing the right. The right is limited to those Dutch nationals living in the Netherlands.
*Environmental protection (Article 21) This article imposes a duty on government to ensure the habitability of the land — including the general infrastructure and especially the vital sea-defences — and the protection and improvement of the environment. Doctrinal consensus holds that &quot;improvement&quot; implies that government is not allowed to make environmental laws much less strict.
*Health, housing, culture and recreation (Article 22). This is a basket article combining rights that were too important to remain unmentioned, but too unimportant to warrant a separate article status. Subarticle 1 imposes a duty upon government to improve public health. Subarticle 2 does the same for living conditions and subarticle 3 for &quot;cultural self-realisation&quot; and recreational activities.
*Freedom of education (Article 23). The Dutch education system is characterized by ideological divisions. The constitutions of 1814 and 1815 expressed the principle of neutral state education; even in private schools giving a full curriculum religious education was forbidden. Parents wanting their children to be given some formal religious instruction had to send them to special bible classes in Sunday schools. In the revision of 1848 the freedom of education was first expressed. However, this was a negative right: parents were at liberty to let their children be educated in denominational schools, but had to pay for this themselves, whereas state schools offered free education. As the frame of government grew ever more democratic, this arrangement proved untenable in the gradually becoming more &quot;pillarised&quot; Dutch society. The school system became the central battleground of political change: the school struggle between elitist neutral liberals and conservatives on the one and mass-oriented confessional protestants and Catholics and eventually socialists on the other hand. In 1889 a system of school funding for denominational schools was introduced; in the revision of 1917 this was formalised by a guarantee of full constitutional equality between public and special schools: the Pacification. Even in 1983 this issue remained so sensitive that government and parliament failed to reach consensus over a changed redaction. As a result, Article 23 remained unchanged. It is therefore outside of the uniform terminology and systematics of the renewed constitution: some elements of Article 23 are absolute rights, others can be limited by law, for some this limitation can be delegated to lower administrative bodies — but it is impossible to understand from the article itself what is the situation for each element; this can only be learned from case law and doctrine. Absolute is the right to education itself (subarticle 2), the equality between public and special schools and the duty of the State to finance them all. The right to education is primarily a right to &quot;give&quot; education of any kind; the right to &quot;be&quot; educated is seen as derived; parents are free in the choice of schools. The right implies the right to found schools, the right to freely choose their underlying religion or philosophy of life and the right to organise them in accordance with such religion or philosophy. So not all &quot;special&quot; schools are denominational; some are e.g. anthroposophic or platonist. All have to be funded by government and with the strictest equality (subarticle 7); until recently law stated that this equality was nominal, meaning that if a municipality spent a certain sum per student in public schools, exactly the same sum had to be spent in its special schools. The right can be limited by formal law in that minimal quality requirements can be imposed (subarticle 5), both as regards the level of education and the standard of organization. Some of this power is in fact delegated to lower bodies; one of the breaking-points in 1983 was the refusal of parliament to express this in the constitution. The duty of State to (equally) fund is limited to free compulsory education (presently until the age of sixteen); Subarticle 7, however, states that law will specify the conditions under which non-compulsory education will be funded; unsurprisingly there is in fact in this field also strict equality. Subarticle 1 expresses the social right that education in general is an ongoing concern for the government; Subarticle 4 states that municipalities have the duty to provide for sufficient primary schools.
====Chapter 2: Government====
Dutch constitutional doctrine holds that the King and ministers together form the government and this indivisibly, so that the King in any of his public acts always acting under ministerial responsibility is not the Head of Government, but embodies it fully. The King &quot;is&quot;, however, head of state, and so a special paragraph is dedicated to the King in this quality.

=====§1: King=====
Article 24 stipulates that there is kingship and that this kingship is held by William I of the Netherlands and his lawful successors. Articles 25 and 26 regulate the line of succession to the Dutch throne; since 1983 female successors have equal rights to the throne. Further articles regulate abdication (Article 27); parliamentary approval of royal marriage on penalty of loss of the right to the throne (Art. 28); the exclusion of unfit possible heirs (Art. 29); appointment of a successor if heirs are absent (Art. 30 and 31); the oath and inauguration in the capital of the Netherlands, Amsterdam (Art. 32); the age of royal majority at eighteen (Art. 33); guardianship over a minor King (Art. 34); declaration by Parliament of the King&#x27;s inability (Art. 35); temporary relinquishment of the exercise of royal authority (Art. 36); regency (Art. 37 and 38); the membership of the Royal House (in practice mainly consisting of members of the House of Orange) (Art. 39); its payment (Art. 40) and the organisation of the royal household by the King (Art. 41).

=====§2: King and ministers=====
Article 42 states the main principles of Dutch government: that it is formed by King and ministers (Subarticle 1) and that &quot;the King is inviolate; the ministers are responsible&quot; (Subarticle 2). Before 1848 the inviolacy of the King was interpreted as a judicial one: he could never be tried in court for whatever reason. This is still so, but ministerial responsibility implies there is since the revision of 1848 primarily a political inviolacy. This means that the King cannot act in a public capacity without ministerial approval: externally the governmental policy is always represented by the responsible minister who, should he feel that the King&#x27;s personal influence in it threatens to become too predominant, has to resign if he cannot prevent it; what happens internally between King and ministers is the Crown Secret, never to be divulged. What little of it nevertheless has come to the public attention, shows that the common conception that the kingship since the reign of William III of the Netherlands has in fact been almost fully ceremonial, is not supported by the facts. Often it is assumed that there is a &quot;derived ministerial responsibility&quot; for all members of the Royal House.

The Prime Minister and the ministers are appointed and dismissed by Royal Decree (Article 43). Such decrees are also signed by the Prime Minister himself, who signs his own appointment and those of the others (Article 48). Royal decree also institutes the ministries (Article 44), which have tended to be very variable in number and scope, and non-departmental ministers (Subarticle 2), who officially have no ministry but whom in fact is assigned the necessary personnel and who sign and are responsible for a partial budget. The ministers together form the Council of Ministers (Article 45), presided by the Prime Minister (Subarticle 2), which assembles (in fact weekly) to promote the unity of the general governmental policy (Subarticle 3). Though existing since 1823, this council has only been mentioned since the revision of 1983; its constitutional powers as such are almost nil. The proceedings are secret for a period of fifty years. Outwardly the council acts as if there were complete agreement between all ministers: the so-called &quot;homogeneity&quot;. By Royal Decree are appointed secretaries of state (Article 46); these are subordinate to a certain minister who is fully responsible for their acts (Subarticle 2). All laws and Royal Decrees have to be countersigned by the responsible minister(s) or secretaries of state (Article 47). The countersign has been mandatory since the revision of 1840. Since 1983 such laws and decrees also have to be affirmed by a signed affirmation; it is usually assumed these acts coincide. All ministers and secretaries of state have to swear an oath of purification (declaring to not having bribed anyone to obtain their office, nor having been bribed to commit certain acts when in office) and swear allegiance to the Constitution (Article 49).

The individual ministers do not have a (general) executive power, other than that which is attributed to them by special law.

====Chapter 3: States General====
=====§1: Organisation and composition=====
Article 50 states that there are States General and that these represent the whole of the people of the Netherlands. Thus a clear distinction is made to the situation under the confederal Dutch Republic when the States General represented the provinces. Doctrine holds that the article also entails that political parties have to give priority to the public interest, as opposed to the particular interests of their constituents. Article 51 specifies that the States General consist of a House of Representatives of the Netherlands (lower house), the Second Chamber of 150 members and a Senate (upper house), the First Chamber of 75 members — the constitution deliberately mentions the House of Representatives first to emphasize its political primate. Subarticle 4 mentions that both Houses can gather in an indivisible United Assembly of 225 members, a joint session necessary to perform some acts, such as the appointment of a new King in absence of royal heirs. When in United Assembly the President of the Senate is President of the States General (Article 62); the House of Representatives has tried to change this in the revision of 1983 but has twice been defeated by the Senate defending its privilege. The Houses sit for four years (Article 52). They are elected on basis of proportional representation (Article 53) and by a secret ballot (Subarticle 2). The House of Representatives is elected by all Dutch citizens over the age of eighteen (Article 54), except those who have been disqualified by a court sentence as part of their punishment for a crime or those who have been declared incapable by court because of insanity (Subarticle 2). Formal law can limit the right to vote to resident nationals only but presently does not. The Senate is elected by the States Provincial (Article 55).

To be eligible to be elected it is necessary to be of Dutch nationality, to be over eighteen in age and not to have been excluded from the right to vote (Article 56); there are also certain incompatibilities of function (Article 57), the most important of which is that a minister not belonging to a demissionary cabinet cannot be a member of the States General, a stark contrast with the situation in United Kingdom or Germany, but in line with the United States. This principle underlies the political dualism of Dutch politics. The Houses investigate the Letters of Credence of new members, in this case a written affirmation by the central voting office that they have indeed obtained the necessary number of votes. After the investigation new members swear four oaths: the oath of purification, the oath of allegiance to the Constitution and the oath of loyal discharge of their office are demanded by Article 60; the oath of loyalty to King and Statute is demanded by Article 47 of the Statute of the Kingdom, the higher Constitution of the Realm. All other issues pertaining the elections are regulated by formal law; delegation is possible (Article 59).

Each House appoints its own President from its members (Article 61) and a clerk, not from its own members; no officials of the States General may be member of the States (Subarticle 2). Law regulates the remuneration of the members; delegation is possible; such law can only be approved by a two-thirds majority (Article 63).

Article 64 states that government can dissolve each House by Royal Decree. Within three months elections have to be held (Subarticle 2). The duration of a new House of Representatives after dissolution is determined by law and not to exceed five years (Subarticle 4). The dissolution only takes effect when the new House meets, to avoid a period without representation. Dissolution of Parliament was in the 19th century an instrument for government to decide a conflict with the House of Representatives by submitting the issue to the voter. Unwritten law developed between 1866 and 1868 that this should not be done more than once over the same issue. The last instance occurred in 1894. In the 20th century such &quot;conflict resolution&quot; was replaced by &quot;crisis resolution&quot; whenever a political coalition fell apart and could not be reconciled; the government then resigns and instead of trying to find a new coalition majority, decides on holding new elections, normally in accordance with the wishes of parliament itself. Earlier typically an &quot;interim cabinet&quot; was formed to arrange for the elections, but this hasn&#x27;t happened since 1982.

=====§2: Procedures=====
Article 65 states that the parliamentary year is opened on the third Tuesday of September (&quot;Prinsjesdag&quot;) by the King holding the Speech from the Throne. The same day the minister of finance presents the yearly national budget. The sessions of the States General are public (Article 66), but the session will be secret (&quot;In camera&quot;) when the House in question so decides (Subarticle 3) which can be proposed by a tenth of the quorum or the President, on which proposal the doors are closed immediately for the vote (Subarticle 2). Normally there is a quorum of a half to start a session or to take any decision (Article 67). Decisions are taken by majority (more than half of the votes, Subarticle 2) and without mandate (Subarticle 3) — a reference to the situation under the Republic when each delegate had to vote on instruction from the nobles or city councils he represented. On demand of a single member the vote must be oral and by roll call; no member may abstain.

The States General have an absolute right to information from the government in writing or in person, only constitutionally limited by State interests, such as the national security (Article 68). Doctrine holds that there can also be &quot;natural impediments&quot; justifying that a minister fails in answering questions, such as the circumstance that he simply doesn&#x27;t know the answer, that he has already answered or that he is about to answer much more completely by issuing a written report on the question. Another doctrinal limitation is the ministerial responsibility: a minister is not obliged to give information about a subject for which not he is responsible but his colleague. Government members have access to the sessions and can freely partake in the discussions (Article 69); they can also be invited to do so by the Houses (Subarticle 2). Such an invitation is in fact an order: government members are not at liberty to refuse. They do however have the right to invite any expert to assist them in the discussions (Subarticle 3). All persons partaking in the deliberations of parliament or in the parliamentary commission meetings have legal immunity regarding any communication they made, either in speech or in writing (Article 71). Otherwise the members have no parliamentary immunity.

The States General have the right of inquiry (Article 70). They can by majority vote empower a commission that in public or secret hearings can investigate any subject. Any person in the Realm is obliged to appear and answer their questions; it is a crime not to obey. This right can be limited by formal law; delegation is possible. Sixteen such inquiries have been held since 1848, one of them, about the events in the Second World War, lasting from 1947 till 1956.

The Houses each determine their own Rules of Procedure (Article 72). As the legislative is in the Netherlands formed by parliament and government in cooperation, these Rules of Procedure are not formal laws but have a &quot;sui generis&quot; &quot;legal&quot; status.

====Chapter 4: Council of State, Court of Audit, National Ombudsman and Permanent Advisory Colleges====

Chapter 4 covers certain other High Councils of State apart from parliament. The most important of these is the Council of State (&quot;Raad van State&quot;). Any proposal of law in the broadest sense and any proposed treaty is in principle first submitted to the Council of State for legal comment; this can be limited by formal law, which however only does so for trivial cases (Article 73). Though officially such comment is merely an advice, it is very rare for law proposals to remain unchanged if the judgment of the council is negative. The council is seen as the guardian of legislative quality; no minister can ignore its opinion without dire effects on his own reputation. Thus the Council in fact codetermines the legislative process. The council also acts as the highest court for administrative appeal (Subarticle 2 and 3); it thus has the final say on the way the country is actually ruled, though this is limited by the fact such appeals can only be made on formal or procedural grounds. The large influence of the council is not always appreciated by external and internal observers. If the King is unable to exert the royal authority and there is as yet no regent, the Council exerts the royal authority (Article 38). The council is officially presided by the King (Article 74); in view of the ministerial responsibility he in fact only does so on special occasions: normally the current chairman is the vice-president of the council, some times by journalists called the &quot;Viceroy of the Netherlands&quot;. The probable heir becomes a member of the Council when he reaches the age of eighteen and often does attend the meetings. Law can give other members of the Royal House the right to attend; it in fact determines that they nor the heir have voting powers. The members of the council, the &quot;Staatsraden&quot;, are appointed by Royal Decree for life (Subarticle 2); they can be dismissed on demand by Decree, or in cases determined by law by the Council itself, and law can determine an age limit (Subarticles 3 and 4). The competence, organisation and composition of the council are regulated by law; delegation is possible (Article 75). This competence may exceed the functions indicated in Article 73; in this case no delegation is allowed (Subarticle 2). The number of &quot;Staatsraden&quot; is determined by law at a maximum of 29 ordinary members and 50 extraordinary members.

The second is the Court of Audit (&quot;Algemene Rekenkamer&quot;). Its task is to perform financial audits (Article 76). The members are appointed for life by Royal Decree from a shortlist of three, proposed by the House of Representatives (Article 77). They can be dismissed on demand by Decree or when reaching an age determined by law (Subarticle 2); or dismissed by the Supreme Court in certain other cases determined by law (Subarticle 3). Law determines the organisation, composition and competence of the Court of Audit (Article 78); delegation is possible; this may exceed the functions indicated by Article 76; in this case no delegation is allowed (Subarticle 2). In fact the Court of Audit not only performs financial audits but also &quot;value for money&quot; efficiency analyses; it also reports on the effectiveness of all governmental policy via performance audits. Dutch legal doctrine believes in a clear distinction between efficiency and effectiveness reports and this is reflected in two separate types of investigation carried out. The budget as such is always officially approved, be it with &quot;comments&quot; when irregularities have been discovered; these then have to be remedied by special law. The effectiveness reports, carried out in great detail, in full independence and without the slightest regard for political sensitivities, have given the Court of Audit a large political influence, even more so than the British National Audit Office.

The third is the National Ombudsman, a relatively new function; he may investigate by his own initiative or on request of anyone, the actions of State bodies or other governmental bodies indicated by law; this indication can be delegated (Article 78a). The ombudsman and his substitute are appointed by the House of Representatives for a certain period of time, to be determined by law. They are in any case dismissed by the House of Representatives on demand and when reaching a certain age (Subarticle 2). Law determines the competence of the ombudsman and the way he proceeds; delegation is allowed (Subarticle 3). His competence may by law be determined to exceed that given in Subarticle 1; delegation is allowed (Subarticle 4) — in contrast with the arrangement given for the Council of State and the Court of Audit.

The constitution has a general Article 79 founding the establishment of other advisory bodies, the &quot;permanent advisory colleges&quot;. The law regulates the organisation, composition and competence of these bodies (Subarticle 2); other competences than mere advisory ones may be attributed by law (Subarticle 3); in both cases delegation is allowed. There used to be a great many of these advisory bodies; after 1996 their number was brought back to a few to economise. The advice of all bodies indicated in Chapter 4 is in principle public; the law regulates the way it is published; delegation is allowed (Article 80); it is submitted to the States General (subarticle 2).

====Chapter 5: Legislation and Administration====
=====§1: Laws and other prescripts=====
The Legislative is formed by Government (i.e. King and ministers) and the States General in cooperation (Article 81), although the term &quot;legislative&quot; is not actually used: the article simply states that government and the States General together make laws. This means that the Dutch concept of &quot;formal law&quot; cannot simply be equated to &quot;Act of Parliament&quot;, as government and parliament act in unison in creating laws. In the Dutch constitutional system there is no decisive referendum, although sometimes consultative referendums are held, like the one in 2005 in which the people advised to reject the European Constitution; the Dutch people is thus not a direct lawgiver.

Bills are presented by the King or by the House of Representatives, which thus has the right of initiative (Article 82). Some bills have to be presented by the States General in United Assembly (subarticle 2). The Senate cannot propose law. The ministers can but in fact act through the King who sends a Royal Missive (Article 83), containing the proposal, which is only signed by himself, thus without countersign. The House of Representatives has the right of amendment; government too may amend (Article 84). The Senate only can pass or reject laws in full (Article 85), defended by the responsible minister or by members of the House of Representatives having taken the initiative to propose the law; however, in practice it can send the proposal back asking for a &quot;novelle&quot; to be passed by the House of Representatives, in fact an amendment of law. Bills may be withdrawn by the proposer until passed (Article 86), but only by a majority of the House of Representatives if the bill has been presented by some members of the House of Representatives and has been passed by the House of Representatives. Bills become valid law once they have been passed by Parliament and have been affirmed by the King (Article 87). It is generally assumed that this also fulfills the demand of signature by Article 47. The affirmation needs sign and ministerial countersign but also the older Royal Order has to be signed and countersigned, ordering to publish the law in a special publication, the &quot;Staatsblad van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden&quot; (&quot;Bulletin of Acts, Orders and Decrees of the Kingdom of the Netherlands&quot;, also called &quot;Bulletin of Acts and Decrees&quot;). Only after such publication the law has an external binding force (Article 88).

In the Dutch constitutional system there is not only formal law; also other general governmental regulations are recognised, binding the citizen; the overarching concept is called &quot;material law&quot;. These other regulations are the &quot;other prescripts&quot; mentioned in the heading of §1. Only the most important subcategory of these is explicitly mentioned in the constitution, in Article 89: the &quot;Algemene maatregelen van bestuur&quot;, &quot;General Administrative Orders&quot;. To avoid doctrinal strive over what orders exactly are covered by this concept, a consensus has developed that a strict formal definition can be applied: all general orders made by Royal Decree (Subarticle 1) that have been submitted to the Council of Ministers and to the Council of State and have been published by the &quot;Staatsblad&quot;, are General Administrative Orders. Since the Second World War a doctrinal consensus has gradually developed that all general Royal Decrees have to conform to these conditions to be valid and that earlier practices to issue general Royal Decrees without meeting these three formalities — such Decrees, general or otherwise, are called &quot;minor Royal Decrees&quot; — can no longer result in regulations with binding force towards the citizen. Since 1889 the constitution determines that all prescripts with a penal character have to be based on formal law and that this law imposes the penalty (Subarticles 2 and 4). This includes the Royal Decrees and thus the General Administrative Orders. A doctrinal consensus has developed, however, that all General Administrative Orders, not just those with penal content, have to be based on formal law to be valid, with the competence to regulate delegated by such law.

=====§2: Other prescripts=====
The second paragraph of Chapter 5 contains several articles of disparate administrative content; but they are not the same as the &quot;other prescripts&quot; of §1; the redaction of the headings is generally seen as confusing and infelicitous on this point. Most articles in §2 are combined in coherent groups.

The first of these groups consists of articles pertaining to international law and treaties. Article 90 states that it is the duty of government to promote the international rule of law. The Netherlands is home to several International Courts. Doctrine holds that this article also attributes the general right to conclude treaties. Article 91 states that the Kingdom shall not be bound by treaty without prior approval of the States General, except for those cases where law determines no such approval is necessary. Such approval may be tacit (Subarticle 2). Despite this, if not either a reservation of approval is made on conclusion of the treaty, or the treaty contains a ratification clause, treaties are according to international law binding upon conclusion. The article must thus be seen as imposing a duty upon government to arrange for such reservation or clause. Subarticle 3 determines that if a treaty conflicts with the Constitution, it has to be approved by a two-thirds majority of both Houses. Whether such conflict exists is decided by the States General; article 6 of the lower &quot;Rijkswet goedkeuring en bekendmaking verdragen&quot; determines that this decision has again to be made by special formal law. A special implementation by law of the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht determines that certain European Community decisions having force of treaty have to be approved by Parliament prior to even the conclusion itself. By treaty legislative, administrative and judicial powers may be conferred on organisations established under international law (Article 92). This has been done on many occasions, e.g. on the Benelux, the European Community, the United Nations, the Council of Europe and NATO.

According to present doctrine, that of &quot;treaty monism&quot;, treaties are in the Dutch legal system in principle self-executing; no special transformation is needed by implementing special law, as in countries with a &quot;dualistic&quot; system (such as the United Kingdom). However, when the present articles covering this subject were last revisioned, in 1953, doctrine was divided and some defended a more dualistic position, that of &quot;limited monism&quot;. They demanded the constitution to be neutral on this issue and this has led to some infelicitous results. Government originally intended that Article 93, stating that treaties of a generally binding nature would only have such binding force after they had been published, to be simply a safeguard, protecting the citizen against duties imposed on him by such treaty. However, the &quot;limited monists&quot; held that only such published treaties are self-executing and that thus Article 93 is the basis for all treaty monism; to appease them government stated that the article should in any case be read as covering also the treaties conferring rights on the citizen and imposing duties upon government. The unintended result was that government might thus in principle withhold rights to the citizen by not publishing the treaty. Article 94 determines that legal prescripts are inapplicable if they conflict with treaties of a generally binding nature. This means that laws can be tested against treaty norms and obligations. Dutch courts have however been very reluctant to do so, limiting this to cases where government has been left no freedom of policy at all by the treaty, or to severe formal and procedural defects. The case law is very complex and contradictory, complicated by the fact that the phrase &quot;generally binding nature&quot; is assumed to have exactly the same meaning in both articles. Article 95 states that law regulates the publication of treaties or (binding) decisions of international organisations; delegation is allowed.

A second group of articles consists of those pertaining to the national security. Before the revision of 1983 these were combined in a separate Chapter 10; the articles as such remained largely unchanged in 1983, but were finally fully revised in 2000. Article 96 states that a prior approval of the States General is necessary for the government (since 1983 no longer the King) to declare that the Kingdom is in a state of war. This approval must be given by the United Assembly (Subarticle 3), as it would be most embarrassing if the House of Representatives approved but the Senate withheld approval. If the existing war conditions make such an approval impossible it is not required. Indeed, the approval has little value in any case: the subject of the article is not the classic declaration of war, as such a declaration according to doctrine might constitute a war crime by implying a war of aggression forbidden by international law. It is a simple declarative statement of fact, without legal consequences, that a war situation has come to exist. The doctrine of many other nations makes no such distinction. Article 97 states that a defence force exists to defend the Kingdom and its interests and to maintain and promote the international rule of law; Subarticle 2 determines that the supreme authority over this defence force is exercised by the government; there is thus no constitutional supreme commander. This defence force consists of volunteers and may contain conscripts (Article 98). Since Napoleonic times conscription had been the rule and voluntary service the exception; this has now been inverted to accommodate the creation of a fully professional army in 1997. However, the old laws regulating conscription have only been suspended, to be reactivated in case of emergency; this is given a constitutional basis by Subarticle 2; delegation is allowed. A provision that has remained unchanged is Article 99, stating that law regulates the exemption of military service for conscientious objectors; delegation is allowed. In 2000 a new Article 99a was inserted, that law has to regulate civil defence; the older legal system regulating this issue had been largely abolished since the end of the Cold War. Delegation is allowed. Government has to inform the States General about any intended foreign deployment of Dutch forces outside of defence treaty obligations, thus to protect the international rule of law and for humanitarian missions (Article 100). In an emergency situation such information can be given after the facts. Both government and parliament tended to present this duty as a kind of implicit approval, as parliament could in principle force government to call off the mission, but the Council of State has made clear this is at least formally not the case. Article 101 (mobilisation) has been abrogated in 1995, Article 102 (defence budget and prohibition of billeting) in 2000. Article 103 states that law has to determine in which cases a Royal Decree may declare a state of emergency to maintain external or internal security; delegation is allowed. The powers of lower administrative bodies can be limited; the basic rights expressed in Articles 6,7,8,9, 12 Subarticle 2, 13 and 113 Subarticle 1 and 3 can be infringed upon (Subarticle 2). Royal Decree may end the state of emergency. The States General decide in United Assembly whether the state of emergency must be maintained, immediately after its declaration and as often as they see fit afterwards (Subarticle 3).

The third group consists of articles pertaining to financial issues. Imposed taxation must be based on formal law (Article 104). Delegation is allowed. However, to indicate this must be done hesitantly, parliament insisted on a slightly different terminology: instead of &quot;krachtens de wet&quot;, the phrase &quot;uit kracht van wet&quot; was used; both mean &quot;by force of law&quot; or &quot;pursuant to law&quot;; but the second expression puts somewhat more emphasis on the &quot;force&quot; of the law and thus on the fact all delegation is ultimately derived from law. A yearly budget is on &quot;Prinsjesdag&quot; presented to the States General, its balance sheet approved by the Court of Audit (Article 105). Delegation is not allowed. The budget debates are held by the House of Representatives, with a separate treatment of each departmental budget and of special interdepartmental budgets; since 1971, the Senate immediately approves the budget formally in exchange for full policy debates. Article 106 states that formal law regulates the monetary system. Delegation is allowed. The article has lost its relevance by the introduction of the euro in 2002; doctrine holds that the constitution does not demand a purely national system.

A fourth and last group of articles pertains to judicial issues. Article 107 is the &quot;codification article&quot;. It imposes that that private law, penal law and the separate procedural laws covering these subjects must indeed be formal law and treated in a general Civil Code and a Penal Code, although certain subject might be covered by special laws. Delegation is allowed but doctrine holds that criminal law (which is seen as a more limited field than general penal law) must be determined by formal law only. This means provinces and municipalities cannot create their own criminal codes and government cannot make a certain act a crime by a Royal Decree not based on formal law. As the administrative law of the Netherlands is so complex, it was deemed impossible to incorporate it in a single code, but its general rules must be covered in a general code (Subarticle 2) as has indeed gradually been done since the nineties, be it with great difficulty. Article 108 (investigative bodies for civil complaints) has been abrogated in 1999. Article 109 states that the position of civil servants, including their protection and workers&#x27; participation must be determined by law. This has as yet not been done in any general way. Doctrine holds that civil servants enjoy full protection by constitutional basic rights. Article 110 imposes a duty upon government to safeguard by formal law sufficient public access to information regarding governmental activities. Delegation is allowed. The government does not see this as some general &quot;right to public access to information&quot; and this has been the reason not to insert it into Chapter 1, but this interpretation is quite popular in doctrine as the right does even more resemble a freedom right than a social right.

Article 111, the last of this paragraph, stands alone; it determines that formal law shall instate honorary Royal Orders of Knighthood. These are in fact the Order of William, the Order of the Netherlands Lion and the Order of Orange-Nassau. They do not include Royal House Orders, which are the personal prerogative of the King, such the House Order of Orange and the later Order of the Crown and The Order for Loyalty and Merit. Each year many thousands are honoured by the constitutional orders.

====Chapter 6: Administration of justice====
This chapter regulates the Dutch judicial system. The central subject is the relation between the judiciary and other courts. The term &quot;judiciary&quot; is not meant to indicate the Judicial of the Trias politica, but rather a purely organisational complex of judicial institutions: those courts are simply part of the judiciary that are designated as such by formal law (Article 116). Their organisation, composition and competence is regulated by law; delegation is possible (Subarticle 2). However, one safeguard that is typical of the Judicial, to guarantee its independence, is also characteristic of the Dutch judiciary: its members are appointed for life (Article 117); they can resign voluntarily or will be fired at an age determined by law (Subarticle 2); present law prescribes an age of seventy. Other principles, like impartiality, are not explicitly mentioned in the constitution. The law regulates to which extent persons who are not members of the judiciary, partake in its rulings; delegation is possible (Article 116, sub 3). This refers to (scientific or other) experts on a certain subject, not to a system of jury trials, which is absent in the Netherlands.

Article 112 states the main principle: the power to judge disputes of private law and the law of obligations is exclusively attributed to the judiciary (subarticle 1); formal law can attribute other judicial powers to either the judiciary or other courts; delegation is possible as regards the regulation of the procedures and the implementation of rulings (subarticle 2). Doctrine holds that the competence of the court is determined by the nature of the legal rule on which the plaintiff founds his claim. This implies that even in administrative disputes the citizen can always assure some legal resort, simply by bringing a tort action against the State: the judiciary is then competent. Article 115 states that in the cases covered by Article 112, sub 2, always &quot;some&quot; administrative appeal is possible. However, it does not guarantee a decision by an independent court: on 23 October 1985 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the Crown Appeal by the Council of State, then by exclusion the highest administrative appeal court, lacked the necessary independence. This necessitated a complete revision of the Dutch administrative court system, resulting in a much expanded access to independent administrative courts.

Article 113 exclusively attributes also the power to judge offences to the judiciary. However, law can regulate the establishment by government of disciplinary courts outside of the judiciary. Delegation is possible (Subarticle 2). The judiciary is attributed the exclusive right to impose a punishment entailing a deprivation of liberty (Subarticle 3). This does not refer to forms of detention that are not punitive in nature. Law may regulate exceptions to the provisions of Article 113 in case of trials held outside of the European territory of the Netherlands or of proceedings of martial law; delegation is possible (Subarticle 4).

Article 114 entails a civil right: the prohibition of the death penalty, included by the constitutional revision of 1983 after the death penalty itself had already been abolished in 1870. The article is not a guarantee, as doctrine holds that in a state of emergency any right might be suspended by unwritten constitutional emergency law; also in principle some treaty might oblige the judge to impose the death penalty. However, in fact the Netherlands has ratified the Sixth Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights, also containing a prohibition and having precedence over any other treaty. Therefore, since 1986 no Dutch judge has any formal competence to impose the death penalty. Nevertheless, the Dutch government might by treaty be obligated to cooperate with some international tribunal with the powers to impose the death penalty, such as the International Military Tribunal once was.

Article 118 regulates the Dutch Supreme Court, the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden. Their members are appointed from a shortlist of three, made by the House of Representatives of the States General (Subarticle 1). Formal law determines in which cases the Supreme Court may reverse judgments of lower courts (cassation) for violation of the law (Subarticle 2). The Supreme Court in revision only decides points of law, not substantial matters. Other duties may be attributed by formal law (Subarticle 3). These other duties in fact include the resolving of conflicts of competence between courts, penal trials against judges for offences committed in office, disciplinary and advisory tasks and the decision in disputes about prizes taken by Dutch vessels. Article 119 attributes the exclusive right to the Supreme Court of trying members of the States General, ministers and secretaries of state, whether incumbent or formal, for offences committed in office. It also states such a trial is instigated by either a Royal Decree or a decision by the House of Representatives.

Article 120 states that no judge will judge the constitutionality of laws and treaties. Therefore, no constitutional review of formal laws is possible; the Netherlands lack a Constitutional Court. However, regulations of lower administrative bodies may be tested against the constitution by the courts. Also any law may be tested against any self-executing treaty, though this rarely happens.

Article 121 states three safeguards for a fair trial: the first is that trials are public. The second is that judgments must specify the considerations and grounds upon which they are based. The third is that any judgment must be pronounced in public. Any exception to these principles can only be made by formal law; no delegation is possible. Article 122 states that pardon is granted by Royal Decree, on advice by a court indicated by law. Formal law regulates the procedure; delegation is possible. Also, an amnesty is possible by a special law or by force of such law; delegation is possible (Subarticle 2).

====Chapter 7: Provinces, municipalities, water boards and other public bodies====

The Netherlands form a decentralised unitary state, meaning that although the state is not a federation, some bodies have an autonomous power of regulation, either based on a territorial division or on a functional division.

Article 123 states that provinces and municipalities can be established and abolished by formal law, hereby indicating the two levels of territorial division. The twelve Dutch provinces still largely coincide with their medieval predecessors, with the exception of Flevoland, and North and South Holland, which were created in 1815 from Holland; the municipalities have recently been greatly decreased in number. Formal law regulates changes in their boundaries, delegation is allowed (Subarticle 2).

Article 124 states the main principles of decentralisation: provinces and municipalities are competent to regulate and administrate their internal affairs (Subarticle 1), delegation is possible — but only by the provinces and municipalities themselves (Article 128); nevertheless demands, regulated by formal law, can be made by the central government on such regulative and administrative powers; delegation is allowed (Article 124 sub 2). So the lower territorial administrative bodies have on the one hand a relative autonomy — but on the other hand they must work within the national legal framework, loyally implement national government policy and are subject to central control. This is further covered by Article 132: the standard organisation of provinces and municipalities and the composition and competence of their administrative organs is regulated by formal law (Subarticle 1); how they are controlled is regulated by law (Subarticle 2); their decisions shall only be subject to prior supervision in cases determined by law or by force of law (Subarticle 3); their decisions shall only be quashed by Royal Decree and on grounds that they violate the law (in the broadest sense: the &quot;recht&quot;) or conflict with the public interest (Subarticle 4). Law will in general regulate the kind of provisions to be made if provinces or municipalities fail to meet the demands of Article 124 sub 2 (Subarticle 5). Which taxes may be levied by provinces and municipalities and their financial relationship with the state, are determined by law (Subarticle 6).

Article 125 indicates the main administrative organs of the lower territorial administrative bodies: in the case of the provinces these are the States-Provincial; the municipalities are administrated by the municipal councils. Their sessions are public, except in cases regulated by formal law; delegation is allowed (Subarticle 1). The sessions of the States-Provincial are presided by the Commissioner of the King, those of the municipal councils by the mayor (Subarticle 3). The Commissioner of the King is also part of the provincial administration as are the Deputised States; the mayor is also part of the municipal administration, as is the College of Mayor and Aldermen (Subarticle 2). In this system the administrative organs exert the function of both the executive and legislative (Article 127); however, to form the daily administration they appoint Deputised States (for provinces) or the Colleges of Mayor and Aldermen (municipalities). In 2002 the system underwent a major revision the &quot;aldermen&quot; (&quot;wethouders&quot;) and States Deputised were no longer allowed to be members of the municipal councils or States Provincial respectively. This makes their function designation a misnomer, although the etymology of the word &quot;wethouder&quot; or &quot;deputised&quot; is no longer commonly understood. The Commissioner of the King and the mayor are officials, appointed by Royal Decree (Article 131). A proposed revision to introduce an elected mayor, recently was rejected by the Senate. The mayor has some legal executive powers of his own, mainly regarding the protection of public order, but these have no direct constitutional basis, they are delegated by the national legislator. Article 126 states, however, that formal law may determine that instructions regarding his office may be given to the Commissioner of the King by the national government. For cases of gross neglect of administrative duty, formal law will regulate the kind of provisions to be made in deviation of Articles 125 and 127 (Article 132, sub 4)

The members of the States-Provincial and the municipal council are directly elected by their constituents. The conditions of the right to elect and be elected are the same as those regarding the elections of the House of Representatives (Article 129 sub 1). However, formal law may give inhabitants of municipalities, that do not have the Dutch nationality, the right to elect, and be elected in, the municipal council, if they meet the other conditions (Article 130). This right has indeed been given to certain categories of foreign nationals, e.g. all citizens of the European Union. The elections take place within a system of proportional representation (Article 129 sub 2); the vote is secret and the organisation of the voting is regulated by law (Subarticle 3). The term of the States-Provincial and the municipal council is four years, unless formal law determines otherwise (Subarticle 4) Law determines possible incompatibilities of function, and may determine that family ties, marriage or the commission of acts indicated by such law may lead to a loss of membership (Subarticle 5). E.g. membership of a municipal council is incompatible with that of the Council of Ministers; a lawyer will lose his membership of a municipal council if he represents his municipality in court. All members vote without mandate (Subarticle 6). This is a reference to the situation under the Republic when the members of the States of a province voted on instruction from the city councils they represented.

==== Chapter 8: Amending the constitution====
To amend the constitution, the proposed changes must first be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate of the States General with a simple majority (more than 50%). This law is called a &quot;voorstelwet&quot; or &#x27;law to propose changes to the constitution&#x27; (lit. &quot;proposal law&quot;) and does not alter the constitution, but declares there are sufficient grounds for a certain proposal to change the constitution to be considered. The House of Representatives must then be dissolved and general elections held. The proposed changes to the constitution are then discussed a second time, this time needing a two-thirds majority in both houses of the States General to approve them. This is intended to give voters a say in the matter, by allowing them the opportunity to elect a parliament to vote down the changes if desired. In practice, however, instead of disbanding the House of Representatives and having early elections, the proposal law is simply considered after the next regularly scheduled elections have been held. Consequently, unless early elections are held for some reason (e.g. following the collapse of the government) changes to the constitution can only occur once every four years. In earlier versions of the amendment process, the Senate was also dissolved whenever general elections were held and both Houses had approved a law to propose changes to the constitution. This was deemed a pointless addition to procedure, however, as the Senate is elected by the States-Provincial and the States-Provincial are not dissolved following the adoption of a proposal in parliament (see elections in the Netherlands). The Senate will therefore invariably have the same composition unless provincial elections are held as well. Neither holding provincial elections specially for this purpose, nor postponing consideration of the proposal to change the constitution until after the regularly scheduled provincial elections is considered a desirable alternative. Changes that involve the relations between the countries of the Kingdom must be proposed by a law formulated by the Government of the Realm.

====Additional articles====
There used to be several additional articles with Roman numbering; however, all except articles IX and XIX are now abrogated.

==Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands==

Each of the four countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands (The Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten) has its own constitution or &quot;basic law&quot;. These constitutions are legally subjected to the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which is the constitution of the entire Kingdom. The Charter however, mainly describes the relations between the different parts of the Kingdom. In addition it stipulates that each country is obliged to promote human rights, listed in a special bill of rights, and decent governance. The Kingdom of the Netherlands is a federacy, where the central government gives considerable autonomy to some parts of the kingdom (Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten), but retains control over a large part (European Netherlands). There is a Government of the Realm, a Legislative of the Realm and a Supreme Court of the Realm. However, these bodies are only fully formed on special occasions and by appointing special Antillian members to the normal Dutch government, parliament and Supreme Court. One of the members of the Dutch council of ministers is always also appointed a permanent &quot;Minister of Antillian Affairs&quot;. Since 1998 this is the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations; when he is acting in this capacity the council has the status of the Government of the Realm to treat minor issues. Though the Charter is in principle higher than the Dutch Constitution, there is no legal mechanism to enforce this. The Dutch Supreme Court has consistently ruled that it is forbidden for judges to test laws and administrative acts against the Charter. However the Government of the Realm can strike void any law of Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten for being incompatible with the Statute. This asymmetry and the fact that foreign affairs and the defence of the Kingdom are administered by the Dutch Government in its capacity of Government of the Realm show that the frame of government of the Kingdom has also elements of a decentralised unitary state. The Charter can only be changed with the consent of all countries within the Kingdom; the laws to this effect can be adopted with a simple absolute majority in each of their parliaments.

==General precepts==

Although the constitution itself is the primary body of constitutional law in the Netherlands, it is not the only law that contains constitutional codification. A number of general precepts are encoded in a separate law known as the &quot;Law on general precepts&quot; (the &quot;Wet Algemene bepalingen&quot;). These precepts cover a number of varying topics ranging from applicability of different types of laws to persons or territories, to regulations mandating that judges must hear all cases brought before them.

<doc id="70128" wikidata="Q336168" url="?curid=70128" title="E3">
<text>E3 (short for Electronic Entertainment Expo) was an annual trade event for the video game industry organized and presented by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA). It was held principally in Los Angeles from 1995 to 2019, with its final iteration held virtually in 2021. The event hosted developers, publishers, hardware manufacturers, and other industry professionals who used the occasion to introduce and advertise upcoming games, hardware, and merchandise to the press. During its existence, E3 was the world&#x27;s largest and most prestigious annual gaming expo. 

E3 included an exhibition floor for developers, publishers, and manufacturers to showcase their titles and products for sale in the upcoming year. Before and during the event, publishers and hardware manufacturers usually held press conferences to announce new games and products. Before 2017, E3 was an industry-only event; the ESA required individuals wishing to attend to verify a professional relationship with the video game industry. With the rise of streaming media, several press conferences were broadcast to the public to increase their visibility. E3 2017 became open to the public for the first time, with 15,000 general-admittance passes for those who wanted to attend.

When hosted in Los Angeles, E3 was held in the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event was cancelled for the first time in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the event in 2021 was held as a virtual event to mixed reception. The 2022 event was cancelled also due to the pandemic, and with no virtual event held. The ESA had planned to return to a full in-person convention in 2023 with a new format, including a fan convention component at a separate venue in collaboration with ReedPop. 

The pandemic further accelerated the use of standalone presentations by individual publishers and media outlets to promote upcoming games directly to consumers, development timelines usually aligned around the convention had been disrupted, and publishers were increasingly concerned over the costs of exhibiting at the convention. E3 2023 was cancelled after all major publishers pulled out of the event, and E3 2024 was cancelled in September 2023 in order to evaluate plans for 2025. On December 12, 2023, the ESA announced that E3 had been retired and would no longer be held.

==History==
===Origins===
Before E3, game publishers went to other trade shows like the Consumer Electronics Show and the European Computer Trade Show to display new or upcoming products as well as to pre-sell shipments to retailers for the rest of the year including the late-year holiday season as well as to view for press coverage of upcoming games. As the game industry grew rapidly during the early 1990s, industry professionals felt that it had outgrown the older trade shows. According to Tom Kalinske, CEO of Sega of America, &quot;The CES organizers used to put the video game industry way, way in the back. In 1991, they put us in a tent, and you had to walk past all the porn vendors to find us. That particular year it was pouring rain, and the rain leaked right over our new Genesis system. I was just furious with the way CES treated the video game industry, and I felt we were a more important industry than they were giving us credit for.&quot; Sega did not return to CES the following year, and several other companies exited from further CES shows.

Separately, in 1994, the video game industry had formed the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA, later becoming the Entertainment Software Association, ESA, in 2003) in response to attention the industry had drawn from the United States Congress over a lack of a ratings system in late 1993. The IDSA was formed to unify the video game industry and establish a commission, the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) to create a voluntary standard rating system that was approved by Congress.
The industry recognized that it needed some type of trade show for retailers. According to Eliot Minsker, chairman and CEO of Knowledge Industry Publications (which produced and promoted the show with Infotainment World), &quot;Retailers have pointed to the need for an interpretive event that will help them make smarter buying decisions by interacting with a wide range of publishers, vendors, industry influentials, and opinion leaders in a focused show setting.&quot; Attempts were made between the video game companies and the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) which ran CES, to improve how video games were treated at CES, but these negotiations failed to produce a result. Pat Ferrell, creator of &quot;GamePro&quot; which was owned by International Data Group (IDG), conceived of an idea for starting a dedicated trade show for video games, building off IDG&#x27;s established experience in running the Macworld convention. Ferrell contacted the IDSA who saw the appeal of using their position in the industry to create a video game-specific tradeshow, and offered to co-found the Electronic Entertainment Expo with IDG.

Though several companies agreed to present at this E3 event, Ferrell discovered that CEA had offered video game companies a dedicated space at the next CES, which would have conflicted with the planned E3 event, requiring the companies to pick one or the other. Most of the IDSA members supported E3, while Nintendo and Microsoft were still supportive of the CES approach. After about three to four months, Ferrell was told by CEA&#x27;s CEO Gary J. Shapiro that he had &quot;won&quot; and that they had canceled the CES video game event, effectively making E3 the premier trade show for the video game industry.

===1995–2006: Growth and success through first decade===

The first event was held from May 11–13, 1995 at the Los Angeles Convention Center, which would generally be the convention&#x27;s location in future years. The organizers were unsure of how successful this would be, but by the end of the convention, they had booked most of the space at the Convention Center, and saw more than 40,000 attendees. In the aftermath of its first year, E3 was already regarded as the biggest event in the video game industry. The IDSA realized the strength of a debut trade show, and subsequently renegotiated with IDG to allow the IDSA to take full ownership of the show and the intellectual property associated with the name, while hiring IDG to help with execution of the event. During this E3, Sega had introduced the Sega Saturn, priced at $399. Sony also introduced the first PlayStation console, with Sony Computer Entertainment North America&#x27;s president Steve Race came on stage during their press event to simply say &quot;$299&quot; before leaving the stage to applause. The surprise undercutting price had a significant impact on Sega and the current console war between Sega, Sony, and Nintendo. From then on, E3 was seen to play a major part in other console wars, with journalists reporting on which manufacturer &quot;won&quot; E3 based on their product offerings. 

In 1996, IDG and the IDSA tried a Japanese version of E3, in preparation for a worldwide series of events, at the Makuhari Messe in Tokyo (as E3 Tokyo &#x27;96) in association with TV Asahi. Although Sony Computer Entertainment was the show&#x27;s original sponsor, the company withdrew its support in favor of its PlayStation Expo. Sega then pulled out at the last minute, leaving Nintendo the only big-three company to appear. Held November 1–4, 1996, the presence of several other gaming expos and lack of support from Japanese game manufacturers led to reportedly poor turnout and rumored E3 events in Singapore and Canada did not take place.

Due to failed negotiations for the convention space in Los Angeles, the E3 conventions in 1997 and 1998 were held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Turnout at these shows was dramatically lower than at the first two E3s, which has been attributed to a declining number of game developers and the fact that many video game companies were based on the West Coast, making the cost of sending staff and equipment to Atlanta prohibitive. The show returned to the Los Angeles Convention Center in 1999, and continued to grow in attendance, ranging from 60,000 to 70,000 attendees.

In addition to the event, E3 started to support (or became associated with) several websites. One was E365, introduced in 2006, an online community which attendees used to network and schedule meetings.

===2007–2008: &quot;Media and Business Summit&quot;===
Following the 2006 convention, the IDSA—now ESA—found that many exhibitors were worried about the high costs of presenting at the event, spending between for their booths. They had also found that a larger proportion of attendees were bloggers and attendees who were not perceived to be industry professionals by vendors, managing to secure access to the conference. These additional attendees diluted the vendors&#x27; ability to reach out to their target audience, retailers and journalists. Both of these reasons had previously caused the COMDEX trade show to shut down. Several large vendors told the ESA that they were going to pull out of the next E3, which would have had a domino effect on other vendors.

To avoid this, the ESA announced in July 2006 that E3 would be downsized and restructured due to the overwhelming demand from the exhibitors, and would limit attendees to those from the media and retail sectors. For 2007 and 2008, E3 was renamed to the E3 Media and Business Summit, and moved into the July timeframe, about two months later in the year than previous shows. The 2007 show was held at the Barker Hangar at the Santa Monica Airport and other nearby hotels in Santa Monica, California with attendance limited to about 10,000, and was the last time the show was not physically held at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The 2008 event returned to the Los Angeles Convention Center, but also capped attendance at about 5,000.

ESA was harshly criticized for these smaller events. Industry analyst Michael Pachter said that because consumers had been eliminated from attending the events, there was little external media coverage of these E3s, reducing the visibility and commercialization opportunities for publishers, and suggested that without a change, E3 would become extinct. Pachter also found that retailers were less interested in E3 due to the later calendar date. Activision, which had been a member of the ESA since its start, opted to leave the ESA in 2008 and to no longer participate in the E3 event, with their CEO Robert Kotick stating the company was too big for the E3 and ESA at that point, riding on revenue from &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;.

===2009–2015: Return to larger format===
Responding to the complaints from the previous two years, the ESA announced that E3 2009 would be more open, but capping attendance at about 45,000 and closed to the public, as to achieve a balance between the two extremes. All subsequent E3s took place in June of the calendar year at the Los Angeles Convention Center.
Starting in 2013, some of the major video game companies, particularly Nintendo and Electronic Arts, have opted not to showcase at E3. In Nintendo&#x27;s case, they have foregone a large keynote presentation and instead have used pre-recorded Nintendo Direct and live video events during the E3 week since 2013 to showcase their new products, though they still run floor booths for hands-on demonstrations. Since 2014, there also have been Nintendo Treehouse Live streams that focused on several different games as well as tournaments for different titles. Electronic Arts, since 2016, have set up a separate EA Play event in a nearby locale to announce and exhibit their titles, citing the move as a result of the lack of public access to the main E3 show. Other vendors, like Microsoft and Sony have used pre-E3 events to showcase hardware reveals, leaving the E3 event to cover new games for these systems.

By 2015, traditional video game marketing had been augmented by the use of publicity through word-of-mouth by average gamers, persons not normally part of the &quot;professional&quot; development community. The ESA began to seek ways to allow these people to attend E3 in limited numbers without overwhelming the normal attendees. For E3 2015, 5,000 tickets were distributed to vendors to be given to fans to be able to attend the event. That same year also marked the introduction of the &quot;PC Gaming Show&quot;, featuring games for personal computers across a range of developers and publishers.

===2016–2019: Opening to the public===
E3 2016 featured a separate but free &quot;E3 Live&quot; event at the nearby L.A. Live space that was to help provide a small-scale version of the E3 experience. While it drew about 20,000 people, it was found to be underwhelming. In 2017, the ESA reserved 15,000 tickets to the convention for members of the public to buy; these were all sold, leading to more than 68,000 attendees during E3 2017, which led to noticeable crowding and floor management issues. ESA confirmed that E3 2018 would include public passes, but that for two of the days, the event would be open only to industry attendees for three hours prior to admitting the public.

The ESA unveiled the new logo for E3, replacing its previous one using three-dimensional block letters with a flatter, stylized graphic, in October 2017.

While the ESA has the Convention Center space reserved through 2019, ESA&#x27;s CEO Mike Gallagher said, following the 2017 event, that they were considering other options due to lack of modernization and upgrades that the center has had to make the space more appropriate for their needs. Gallagher said that the ESA was working with the City and Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) which owns the Los Angeles Convention Center and the space around it, with plans to have nearly of additional exhibition space added by 2020, but that they would judge this in the 2018 show. During 2018, the event drew 69,200 attendees, the largest since 2005.

With announcements of the dates for E3 2019, the ESA declined to state where they had planned to hold the 2020 event. Sony Interactive Entertainment had announced that it would not be participating in E3 2019, having had participated in every E3 since its launch. Sony stated that they &quot;are exploring new and familiar ways to engage our community in 2019&quot;. Sony&#x27;s CEO Shawn Layden stated in a February 2019 interview that with changes in retailer procurement, their own switch to fewer but more quality titles, and the rapid spread of news via the Internet that having a trade show as late as June is no longer helpful, and that Sony had to create its own Destination PlayStation experience in February as to secure retailer sales. Industry Analyst Michael Patcher, speaking to GamingBolt, said, &quot;I think it&#x27;s a mistake to skip the show, they will probably be there without a big booth. It was a surprise to me&quot;.

As of 2016, revenues from running E3 accounted for about 48% of the organization&#x27;s annual budget, with another 37% coming from membership dues. With Sony&#x27;s withdrawal from the conference and the controversies surrounding outgoing ESA president Mike Gallagher, some member companies criticized the ESA for splitting its focus between producing E3 and acting as a legislative advocacy group, with neither focus receiving adequate attention. This led to calls advocating for the business of running E3 to be split out into a separate company. Developers and publishers complained of the increasing cost to have a booth presence at E3 compared to simply holding a digital event streamed online, saying the exposure afforded by E3 was not always worth the price. Sony and Electronic Arts&#x27; departure and Nintendo&#x27;s move to a digital-only keynote diminished E3&#x27;s status as the premier game announcement event, which further eroded its ability to attract exhibitors. E3 lost nearly 1/3 of its exhibitors between 2017 and 2019, going from 293 to 209.

====Data leak====
On August 3, 2019, it was found that an unsecured list of personal attendee data was publicly accessible from the ESA&#x27;s site. The list contained the information of over 2,000 people, most of them being the press and social media influencers that had attended E3 2019. ESA removed the list after it was found, and apologized for allowing the information to become public. However, using similar techniques to access the 2019 data, users found similar data for over 6,000 attendees of past E3 events still available on user-authenticated portions of their website; these too were subsequently pulled by the ESA once notified. A number of journalists on the lists reported that they were subsequently harassed and had received death threats due to their private information being released as part of the leak. Ahead of E3 2020, the ESA stated they were taking stricter security measures to protect the privacy of those registering for E3 as a result of the leak. ESA president Stanley Pierre-Louis stated they plan to collect less data from attendees and take measures such as securing the data on separate servers to avoid this type of leak from occurring again.

===2020–2023: Impact of COVID-19 and discontinuation===
During the last day of the event in 2019, it was confirmed that E3 would be held at the LACC for at least another year, with the 2020 edition. The ESA affirmed they had renegotiated use of the LACC through 2023, but retained the rights to break that contract if desired.

The ESA&#x27;s membership approved an increase in the number of public passes from 15,000 to 25,000 for the 2020 show. Alongside this, the ESA had presented proposed, but not finalized, plans to make the 2020 event a &quot;fan, media, and influencer festival&quot;. To mitigate the longer lines caused by increased public attendance, they aimed to use &quot;queuetainment&quot; to advertise to attendees while they wait, as well as a FastPass-like system of reserving game demos in advance similar to the one employed by Disney Parks. They planned to give priority to &quot;influencers&quot; by providing them appointment-only presentations on new games. Additionally, with these changes, the ESA were considering adding an extra day on the Tuesday of the convention week that would be an industry-only day before the floor of the convention was opened to public passes. Sony affirmed it would not attend the 2020 show, stating that the vision for E3 2020 did not meet their goals, and instead would showcase their games at other events throughout the year. In the wake of Sony&#x27;s announcement, ESA affirmed that the 2020 show &quot;will be an exciting, high-energy show featuring new experiences, partners, exhibitor spaces, activations, and programming that will entertain new and veteran attendees alike&quot;. On February 12, 2020, Geoff Keighley, host of E3 Coliseum and The Game Awards, released a statement announcing that he would also be forgoing his attendance of E3 for the first time in the expo&#x27;s 25-year history, citing his discomfort with the direction planned for the event in 2020.

However, in the months leading to the 2020 event, the COVID-19 pandemic created concerns related to large gatherings such as E3. As late as March 4, 2020, the ESA had still intended to hold E3 2020, though said they were monitoring the situation around the outbreak. On March 11, 2020, the ESA announced that E3 2020 had been cancelled due to the pandemic. The ESA also claimed that they would both fully refund prospective attendees and exhibitors and devise a virtual event that would enable exhibitors to hold digital presentations during the same week in lieu of a physical meeting. However, by April 7, 2020, the ESA stated that the disruption caused by the pandemic made it impossible to host an online equivalent, fully cancelling the event, though the ESA would help its partners to present individual announcements via E3&#x27;s website. Keighley would organize &quot;Summer Game Fest&quot;—an event series encompassing various publisher-led digital presentations and demo offerings from May to August 2020.

Despite cancelling the 2020 event, the ESA stated it still planned to hold the 2021 event, announcing its normal June dates to partners in April 2020. While the ESA had planned for a combined in-person and virtual event, the organization notified its partners in February 2021 that it was dropping the in-person event but maintaining the virtual event plans. According to &quot;Video Games Chronicle&quot;, the ESA still planned to use the LACC to broadcast some of these virtual events during E3 2021, as well as planning on further use of the space in 2022 and 2023. The virtual event faced a mixed reception among users and the industry, including issues with the event&#x27;s official mobile app, and assessments that E3 as a virtual event was redundant to streaming presentations that could be held as standalone events by publishers.

While Mayor Eric Garcetti stated that the ESA had planned E3 2022 to be an in-person event, on January 7, 2022, the ESA announced that the in-person version of E3 2022 had been cancelled due to COVID-19, with no immediate confirmation of a virtual event. Although this announcement came amid spread of the Omicron variant, &quot;IGN&quot; reported that unlike past years, E3 2022 had no dates publicized by either the ESA or the LACC—which had cast doubt (especially amid the internal issues surrounding the 2020 event, and the aforementioned reception to E3 2021) over whether the event was even being planned at all. Furthermore, &quot;IGN&quot; reported via anonymous sources that the ESA had made a decision to cancel the event as early as late-2021. The ESA formally announced on March 31, 2022, that they had fully cancelled E3 2022.

In June 2022, the ESA stated that they still planned to return with a physical and virtual show in 2023. One month later, the ESA confirmed that E3 2023 would occur at the Los Angeles Convention Center during the second week of June 2023, and that they have partnered with ReedPop, who operate conventions such as PAX events, New York Comic Con, and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Celebration, to help manage the event. In September 2022, the ESA announced that the event would also include three &quot;Business Days&quot; where the floor would be limited to developers, publishers, retailers, and recognized journalists, while two days at a separate location would be held as &quot;Fan Days&quot; for all members of the public. In January 2023, &quot;IGN&quot; reported that none of Microsoft, Nintendo, or Sony would exhibit at E3 2023, with Nintendo confirming their absence the following month, citing that &quot;this year&#x27;s E3 show didn&#x27;t fit into our plans.&quot; Microsoft confirmed in March 2023 they would not be on the E3 showfloor, but would be holding the digital events. In the same month, Ubisoft also announced that they would not be attending E3 2023, and would be hosting their own presentation event in June instead. On March 29, &quot;IGN&quot; reported that both Sega and Tencent would be skipping E3 2023.

On March 30, 2023, the 2023 event was cancelled because of a lack of &quot;sustained interest&quot;. According to ESA&#x27;s president, Stanley Pierre-Louis, the choice to cancel the 2023 show was a result of three factors: that the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted the typical development cycle for most companies; that the current economy had publishers and developers re-evaluate the need for attending E3; and that, as a result, there has been more exploration of the mix of in-person and digital marketing events that individual companies have run. While Pierre-Louis stated that ESA was intending to hold E3 in 2024, they were looking themselves to find a balance that works for the industry. 

The ESA affirmed in September 2023 that there would be no E3 2024, that they would not be using the LACC in the immediate future, and that ReedPop was no longer working to help organize future events. The ESA stated they were still in discussions with their partners on E3 2025 and future shows, with the former reportedly planned to have a &quot;complete reinvention&quot;. On December 12, 2023, the ESA announced that E3 had been discontinued, citing &quot;the new opportunities our industry has to reach fans and partners&quot;. Pierre-Louis said that other live events were not responsible for the decision to end E3, while the increasing number of publisher-specific showcases was a reason. He further stated that ReedPop&#x27;s departure was not solely responsible for their decision to end E3 but helped to inform their choice.

<text>Mistletoe is the common name for obligate hemiparasitic plants in the order Santalales. They are attached to their host tree or shrub by a structure called the haustorium, through which they extract water and nutrients from the host plant. There are hundreds of species which mostly live in tropical regions.

The name mistletoe originally referred to the species &quot;Viscum album&quot; (European mistletoe, of the family Santalaceae in the order Santalales); it is the only species native to the British Isles and much of Europe. A related species with red fruits, rather than white, &quot;Viscum cruciatum&quot;, occurs in Southwest Spain and Southern Portugal, as well as in Morocco in North Africa and in southern Africa. There is also a wide variety of species in Australia. The genus &quot;Viscum&quot; is not native to North America, but &quot;Viscum album&quot; was introduced to Northern California in 1900.

The eastern mistletoe native to North America, &quot;Phoradendron leucarpum&quot;, belongs to a distinct genus of the family Santalaceae.

European mistletoe has smooth-edged, oval, evergreen leaves borne in pairs along the woody stem, and waxy, white berries that it bears in clusters of two to six. The eastern mistletoe of North America is similar, but has shorter, broader leaves and longer clusters of ten or more berries.

Over the centuries, the term mistletoe has been broadened to include many other species of parasitic plants with similar habits, found in other parts of the world, that are classified in different genera and families such as the Misodendraceae of South America and the mainly southern hemisphere tropical Loranthaceae.

== Etymology ==
The word &#x27;mistletoe&#x27; derives from the older form &#x27;mistle&#x27; adding the Old English word (twig). &#x27;Mistle&#x27; is from Common Germanic (cf. Old High German , Middle High German , Old English , Old Norse ). Further etymology is uncertain, but may be related to the Germanic base for &#x27;mash&#x27;.

&quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot; claims a similar theory, noting: &quot;The alteration of the ending... is perhaps from a mistaking of the final &quot;-n&quot; for a plural suffix after &quot;tan&quot; fell from use as a separate word, but &quot;Oxford&quot; finds it a natural evolution in West Saxon based on stress.&quot;

== Groups ==
Parasitism has evolved at least twelve times among the vascular plants. Molecular data show the mistletoe habit has evolved independently five times within the Santalales—first in the Misodendraceae, but also in the Loranthaceae and three times in the Santalaceae (in the former Santalalean families Eremolepidaceae and Viscaceae, and the tribe Amphorogyneae).

The largest family of mistletoes, the Loranthaceae, has 73 genera and more than 900 species. Subtropical and tropical climates have markedly more mistletoe species; Australia has 85, of which 71 are in Loranthaceae, and 14 in Santalaceae.

== Life cycle ==
Mistletoe species grow on a wide range of host trees, some of which experience side effects including reduced growth, stunting, and loss of infested outer branches. A heavy infestation may also kill the host plant. &quot;Viscum album&quot; successfully parasitizes more than 200 tree and shrub species.

All mistletoe species are hemiparasites because they do perform some photosynthesis for some period of their life cycle. However, in some species its contribution is very nearly zero. For example, some species, such as &quot;Viscum minimum&quot;, that parasitize succulents, commonly species of Cactaceae or Euphorbiaceae, grow largely within the host plant, with hardly more than the flower and fruit emerging. Once they have germinated and attached to the circulatory system of the host, their photosynthesis reduces so much that it becomes insignificant.
Most of the Viscaceae bear evergreen leaves that photosynthesise effectively, and photosynthesis proceeds within their green, fleshy stems as well. Some species, such as &quot;Viscum capense&quot;, are adapted to semi-arid conditions and their leaves are vestigial scales, hardly visible without detailed morphological investigation. Therefore, their photosynthesis and transpiration only take place in their stems, limiting their demands on the water supply of its host, but also limiting their intake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. Accordingly, their contribution to the metabolic balance of its host becomes trivial and the idle parasite may become quite yellow or golden as it grows, having practically given up photosynthesis.

At another extreme, other species have vigorous green leaves. Not only do they photosynthesize actively, but a heavy infestation of mistletoe plants may take over whole host tree branches, sometimes killing practically the entire crown and replacing it with their own growth. In such a tree the host is relegated purely to the supply of water and mineral nutrients and the physical support of the trunk. Such a tree may survive as a &quot;Viscum&quot; community for years; it resembles a totally unknown species unless one examines it closely, because its foliage does not look like that of any tree. An example of a species that behaves in this manner is &quot;Viscum continuum&quot;.

A mistletoe seed germinates on the branch of a host tree or shrub, and in its early stages of development it is independent of its host. It commonly has two or even four embryos, each producing its hypocotyl, that grows toward the bark of the host under the influence of light and gravity, and potentially each forming a mistletoe plant in a clump. Possibly as an adaptation to assist in guiding the process of growing away from the light, the adhesive on the seed tends to darken the bark. On having made contact with the bark, the hypocotyl, with only a rudimentary scrap of root tissue at its tip, penetrates it, a process that may take a year or more. In the meantime the plant is dependent on its own photosynthesis. Only after it reaches the host&#x27;s conductive tissue may it begin to rely on the host for its needs. Later, it forms a haustorium that penetrates the host tissue and takes water and nutrients from the host plant.

Species more or less obligate include the leafless quintral, &quot;Tristerix aphyllus&quot;, which lives deep inside the sugar-transporting tissue of a spiny cactus, appearing only to show its tubular red flowers, and the genus &quot;Arceuthobium&quot; (dwarf mistletoe; Santalaceae) that has reduced photosynthesis; as an adult, it manufactures only a small proportion of the sugars it needs from its own photosynthesis, but as a seedling actively photosynthesizes until a connection to the host is established.

Some species of the largest family, Loranthaceae, have small, insect-pollinated flowers (as with Santalaceae), but others have spectacularly showy, large, bird-pollinated flowers.

Most mistletoe seeds are spread by birds who eat the &#x27;seeds&#x27; (in actuality drupes). Of the many bird species that feed on them, the mistle thrush is the best-known in Europe, the phainopepla in southwestern North America, and &quot;Dicaeum&quot; flowerpeckers in Asia and Australia. Depending on the species of mistletoe and the species of bird, the seeds are regurgitated from the crop, excreted in their droppings, or stuck to the bill and causing the bird to have to wipe it off onto a branch. The seeds are coated with a sticky material called viscin. Some viscin remains on the seed and when it touches a stem, it sticks tenaciously. The viscin soon hardens and attaches the seed firmly to its future host, where it germinates and its haustorium penetrates the sound bark.

Specialist mistletoe eaters have adaptations that expedite the process; some pass the seeds through their unusually shaped digestive tracts so fast that a pause for defecation of the seeds is part of the feeding routine. Others have adapted patterns of feeding behavior; the bird grips the fruit in its bill and squeezes the sticky-coated seed out to the side. The seed sticks to the beak and the bird wipes it off onto the branch and consumes the remainder of the fruit. An example of a bird with this adapted method is the blackcap (&quot;Sylvia atricapilla&quot;).

Biochemically, viscin is a complex adhesive mix containing cellulosic strands and mucopolysaccharides.

Once a mistletoe plant is established on its host, it usually is possible to save a valuable branch by pruning and judicious removal of the wood invaded by the haustorium, if the infection is caught early enough. Some species of mistletoe can regenerate if the pruning leaves any of the haustorium alive in the wood.

== Toxicity ==
There are 1500 species of mistletoe, varying widely in toxicity to humans; the European mistletoe (&quot;Viscum album&quot;) is more toxic than the American mistletoe (&quot;Phoradendron serotinum&quot;).

The primary active toxic compounds in American mistletoe are phoratoxins (in &quot;Phoradendron&quot;) and their effects can include blurred vision, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, although these rarely occur. Their primary mechanism of action is through disruption of cell membranes which causes lysis and cell death at high concentrations.

In European mistletoe (&quot;Viscum&quot;), viscumin is the more dangerous active toxin. It acts by irreversibly inhibiting ribsomal protein synthesis in cells, which leads to the death of the affected cell, tissue damage in the area of exposure from mass cell death in the very short term, with the potential for organ failure and death depending on the level of exposure. Early symptoms depend mostly on the route of exposure as the first cells it contacts (thus the first to have their protein synthesis deactivated by it) will be the first to die. Its toxic effects take place through the same mechanism as ricin and other ribosome-inactivating proteins but it enters the cells by a different mechanism than ricin and is toxic even to cultured ricin-resistant cells. 

Mistletoe has been used historically in medicine for its supposed value in treating arthritis, high blood pressure, epilepsy, and infertility.

== Ecological importance ==
Mistletoes are often considered pests that kill trees and devalue natural habitats, but some species have recently been recognized as ecological keystone species, organisms that have a disproportionately pervasive influence over their community. A broad array of animals depend on mistletoe for food, consuming the leaves and young shoots, transferring pollen between plants and dispersing the sticky seeds. In western North America their juicy berries are eaten and spread by birds (notably the phainopepla) while in Australia the mistletoebird behaves similarly. When eaten with the fruit, some seeds pass unharmed through their digestive systems, emerging in extremely sticky droppings which the bird deposits on tree branches, where some may stick long enough to germinate. As the plants mature, they grow into masses of branching stems that suggest the popular name &quot;witches&#x27; brooms&quot;.

The dense evergreen witches&#x27; brooms formed by the dwarf mistletoes (&quot;Arceuthobium&quot; species) of western North America also make excellent locations for roosting and nesting of the northern spotted owl and the marbled murrelet. In Australia the diamond firetail and painted honeyeater are recorded as nesting in different mistletoes.

A study of mistletoe in junipers concluded that more juniper berries sprout in stands where mistletoe is present, as the mistletoe attracts berry-eating birds who also eat juniper berries.

== Cultural importance ==
Mistletoe is relevant to several cultures. Pagan cultures regarded the white berries as symbols of male fertility, with the seeds resembling semen. The Celts, particularly, saw mistletoe as the semen of Taranis, while the Ancient Greeks referred to mistletoe as &quot;oak sperm&quot;. Also in Roman mythology, mistletoe was used by the hero Aeneas to reach the underworld.

Mistletoe may have played an important role in Druidic mythology in the Ritual of Oak and Mistletoe, although the only ancient writer to mention the use of mistletoe in this ceremony was Pliny. Evidence taken from bog bodies makes the Celtic use of mistletoe seem medicinal rather than ritual. It is possible that mistletoe was originally associated with human sacrifice and only became associated with the white bull after the Romans banned human sacrifices.

The Romans associated mistletoe with peace, love, and understanding and hung it over doorways to protect the household.

In the advent of the Christian era, mistletoe in the Western world became associated with Christmas as a decoration under which lovers are expected to kiss, as well as with protection from witches and demons. Mistletoe continued to be associated with fertility and vitality through the Middle Ages, and by the eighteenth century it had also become incorporated into Christmas celebrations around the world. The custom of kissing under the mistletoe is referred to as popular among servants in late eighteenth-century England.

The serving class of Victorian England is credited with perpetuating the tradition. The tradition dictated that a man was allowed to kiss any woman standing underneath mistletoe, and that bad luck would befall any woman who refused the kiss. One variation on the tradition stated that with each kiss a berry was to be plucked from the mistletoe, and the kissing must stop after all the berries had been removed.

From at least the mid-nineteenth century, Caribbean herbalists of African descent have referred to mistletoe as &quot;god-bush&quot;. In Nepal, diverse mistletoes are used for a variety of medical purposes, particularly for treating broken bones.

Mistletoe is the floral emblem of the U.S. state of Oklahoma and the flower of the UK county of Herefordshire. Every year, the UK town of Tenbury Wells holds a mistletoe festival and crowns a &#x27;Mistletoe Queen&#x27;.

<text>The Twenty-first Amendment (Amendment XXI) to the United States Constitution repealed the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which had mandated nationwide prohibition on alcohol. The Twenty-first Amendment was proposed by the 72nd Congress on February 20, 1933, and was ratified by the requisite number of states on December 5, 1933. It is unique among the 27 amendments of the U.S. Constitution for being the only one to repeal a prior amendment, as well as being the only amendment to have been ratified by state ratifying conventions.

The Eighteenth Amendment was ratified on January 16, 1919, after years of advocacy by the temperance movement. The subsequent enactment of the Volstead Act established federal enforcement of the nationwide prohibition on alcohol. As many Americans continued to drink despite the amendment, Prohibition gave rise to a profitable black market for alcohol, fueling the rise of organized crime. Throughout the 1920s, Americans increasingly came to see Prohibition as unenforceable, and a movement to repeal the Eighteenth Amendment grew until the Twenty-first Amendment was ratified in 1933.

Section 1 of the Twenty-first Amendment expressly repeals the Eighteenth Amendment. Section2 bans the importation of alcohol into states and territories that have laws prohibiting the importation or consumption of alcohol. Several states continued to be &quot;dry states&quot; in the years after the repealing of the Eighteenth Amendment. Nonetheless, several states continue to closely regulate the distribution of alcohol. Many states delegate their power to ban the importation of alcohol to counties and municipalities, and there are numerous dry communities throughout the United States. Section2 has occasionally arisen as an issue in Supreme Court cases that touch on the Commerce Clause.

== Text ==
== Background ==

The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution had ushered in a period known as Prohibition, during which the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages was illegal. The enactment of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919 was the crowning achievement of the temperance movement, but it soon proved highly unpopular. Crime rates soared under Prohibition as gangsters, such as Chicago&#x27;s Al Capone, became rich from a profitable, often violent, black market for alcohol. The federal government was incapable of stemming the tide: enforcement of the Volstead Act proved to be a nearly impossible task and corruption was rife among law enforcement agencies. In 1932, wealthy industrialist John D. Rockefeller Jr. stated in a letter:
As more and more Americans opposed the Eighteenth Amendment, a political movement grew for its repeal. However, repeal was complicated by grassroots politics. Although the U.S. Constitution provides two methods for ratifying constitutional amendments, only one method had been used up until that time: ratification by the state legislatures of three-fourths of the states. However, the wisdom of the day was that the lawmakers of many states were either beholden to or simply fearful of the temperance lobby.

== Proposal and ratification ==
The Congress adopted the Blaine Act, which proposed the Twenty-first Amendment, on February 20, 1933.

The proposed amendment was adopted on December 5, 1933. It is the only amendment to have been ratified by state ratifying conventions, specifically selected for the purpose.

The Twenty-first Amendment ending national prohibition also became effective on December 5, 1933. The Acting Secretary of State William Phillips certified the amendment as having been passed by the required three-fourths of the states at 5:49 p.m. EST, just 17 minutes after the passage of the amendment by the Utah convention. President Roosevelt then issued a proclamation following the passage and certification of the amendment which stated in part the following: &quot;I trust in the good sense of the American people that they will not bring upon themselves the curse of excessive use of intoxicating liquors to the detriment of health, morals and social integrity. The objective we seek through a national policy is the education of every citizen towards a greater temperance throughout the nation.&quot; The end of prohibition was thought to be responsible for the creation of a half million jobs.

The various responses of the 48 states is as follows:

The following states ratified the amendment:

# Michigan: April 10, 1933 (99–1)
# Wisconsin: April 25, 1933 (15–0)

# Utah: December 5, 1933 (20–0)
The amendment was officially added to the U.S. Constitution on December 5, 1933, when Utah&#x27;s state convention unanimously ratified the amendment.

The amendment was subsequently ratified by conventions in the following states:
The amendment was unanimously rejected by South Carolina&#x27;s state convention on December 4, 1933. On November 7, 1933, North Carolina held a vote, and approximately 70% of its voters rejected holding a convention to consider the amendment.

== Implementation ==
=== State and local control ===

Mississippi was the last state to remain entirely dry. In August 1966, 19 of Mississippi&#x27;s counties voted to legalize alcohol. Kansas continued to prohibit public bars until 1987. Many states now delegate the authority over alcohol granted to them by this Amendment to their municipalities or counties (or both).

=== Court rulings ===

Early rulings suggested that Section2 enabled states to legislate with exceptionally broad constitutional powers. In &quot;State Board of Equalization v. Young&#x27;s Market Co.&quot;, the Supreme Court recognized that &quot;Prior to the Twenty-first Amendment it would obviously have been unconstitutional&quot; for a state to require a license and fee to import beer anywhere within its borders. First, the Court held that Section2 abrogated the right to import intoxicating liquors free of a direct burden on interstate commerce, which otherwise would have been unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause before passage of the Twenty-first Amendment. In its second holding, the Court rejected an equal protection claim because &quot;A classification recognized by the Twenty-first Amendment cannot be deemed forbidden by the Fourteenth.&quot; 

In &quot;Craig v. Boren&quot; (1976), the Supreme Court found that analysis under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment had not been affected by the passage of the Twenty-first Amendment. Although the Court did not specify whether the Twenty-first Amendment could provide an exception to any other constitutional protections outside of the Commerce Clause, it acknowledged &quot;the relevance of the Twenty-first Amendment to other constitutional provisions becomes increasingly doubtful&quot;. Likewise, it has been held that Section2 of the Twenty-first Amendment does not affect the Supremacy Clause or the Establishment Clause. However, the &quot;Craig v. Boren&quot; Court did distinguish two characteristics of state laws permitted by the Amendment, which otherwise might have run afoul of the Constitution. The constitutional issues in each centered or touched upon: (1) &quot;&quot;importation of intoxicants&quot;, a regulatory area where the State&#x27;s authority under the Twenty-first Amendment is transparently clear&quot;; and (2) &quot;&quot;purely economic matters&quot; that traditionally merit only the mildest review under the Fourteenth Amendment&quot;. As to the Dormant Commerce Clause in particular, the Court clarified that, while not a &quot;pro tanto&quot; repeal, the Twenty-First Amendment nonetheless &quot;primarily created an exception to the normal operation of the Commerce Clause&quot;.

In &quot;South Dakota v. Dole&quot; (1987), the Supreme Court upheld the withholding of some federal highway funds to South Dakota, because beer with an alcohol content below a specified percentage could be lawfully sold to adults under the age of 21 within the state. In a 7–2 majority opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Court held that the offer of benefits is not coercion that inappropriately invades state sovereignty. The Twenty-first Amendment could not constitute an &quot;independent constitutional bar&quot; to the spending power granted to Congress under Article I, section 8, clause 1 of the Constitution. Justice Brennan, author of the majority opinion in &quot;Craig v. Boren&quot;, provided a brief but notable dissent based solely on Section 2. Justice O&#x27;Connor also dissented, arguing that &quot;the regulation of the age of the purchasers of liquor, just as the regulation of the price at which liquor may be sold, falls squarely within the scope of those powers reserved to the States by the Twenty-first Amendment.&quot;

In &quot;44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island&quot; (1996), the Court held states cannot use the Twenty-first Amendment to abridge freedom of speech protections under the First Amendment. Rhode Island imposed a law that prohibited advertisements disclosing the retail prices of alcoholic beverages sold to the public. In declaring the law unconstitutional, the Court reiterated that &quot;although the Twenty-first Amendment limits the effect of the Dormant Commerce Clause on a State&#x27;s regulatory power over the delivery or use of intoxicating beverages within its borders, the Amendment does not license the States to ignore their obligations under other provisions of the Constitution&quot;.

Most recently, however, &quot;Granholm v. Heald&quot; (2005) held that the Twenty-first Amendment does not overrule the Dormant Commerce Clause with respect to alcohol sales, and therefore states must treat in-state and out-of-state wineries equally. The Court criticized its earliest rulings on the issue, (including &quot;State Board of Equalization v. Young&#x27;s Market Co.&quot;) and promulgated its most limited interpretation to date:
In a lengthy dissent, Justice Thomas argued that the plain meaning of Section2 removed &quot;any doubt regarding its broad scope, the Amendment simplified the language of the Webb–Kenyon Act and made it clear that States could regulate importation destined for in-state delivery free of negative Commerce Clause restraints&quot;.

<text>The Twenty-second Amendment (Amendment XXII) to the United States Constitution limits the number of times a person can be elected to the office of President of the United States to two terms, and sets additional eligibility conditions for presidents who succeed to the unexpired terms of their predecessors. Congress approved the Twenty-second Amendment on March 21, 1947, and submitted it to the state legislatures for ratification. That process was completed on February 27, 1951, when the requisite 36 of the 48 states had ratified the amendment (neither Alaska nor Hawaii had yet been admitted as a state), and its provisions came into force on that date.

The amendment prohibits anyone who has been elected president twice from being elected again. Under the amendment, someone who fills an unexpired presidential term lasting more than two years is also prohibited from being elected president more than once. Scholars debate whether the amendment prohibits affected individuals from succeeding to the presidency under any circumstances or whether it applies only to presidential elections. Until the amendment&#x27;s ratification, the president had not been subject to term limits, but both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson (the first and third presidents) decided not to run for a third term, establishing a two-term tradition. In the 1940 and 1944 presidential elections, Franklin D. Roosevelt became the only president to be elected for a third and fourth term, giving rise to concerns about a president serving unlimited terms.

==Text==

==Background==

The Twenty-second Amendment was a reaction to Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s election to an unprecedented four terms as president, but presidential term limits had long been debated in American politics. Delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 considered the issue extensively (alongside broader questions, such as who would elect the president, and the president&#x27;s role). Many, including Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, supported lifetime tenure for presidents, while others favored fixed terms. Virginia&#x27;s George Mason denounced the life-tenure proposal as tantamount to elective monarchy. An early draft of the U.S. Constitution provided that the president was restricted to one seven-year term. Ultimately, the Framers approved four-year terms with no restriction on how many times a person could be elected president.

Though dismissed by the Constitutional Convention, term limits for U.S. presidents were contemplated during the presidencies of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. As his second term entered its final year in 1796, Washington was exhausted from years of public service, and his health had begun to decline. He was also bothered by his political opponents&#x27; unrelenting attacks, which had escalated after the signing of the Jay Treaty, and believed he had accomplished his major goals as president. For these reasons, he decided not to run for a third term, a decision he announced to the nation in his September 1796 &quot;Farewell Address&quot;. Eleven years later, as Thomas Jefferson neared the halfway point of his second term, he wrote,
Since Washington made his historic announcement, numerous academics and public figures have looked at his decision to retire after two terms, and have, according to political scientist Bruce Peabody, &quot;argued he had established a &quot;two-term tradition&quot; that served as a vital check against any one person, or the presidency as a whole, accumulating too much power&quot;. Various amendments aimed at changing informal precedent to constitutional law were proposed in Congress in the early to mid-19th century, but none passed. Three of the next four presidents after Jefferson—Madison, James Monroe, and Andrew Jackson—served two terms, and each adhered to the two-term principle; Martin Van Buren was the only president between Jackson and Abraham Lincoln to be nominated for a second term, though he lost the 1840 election and so served only one term. At the outset of the Civil War, the seceding states drafted the Constitution of the Confederate States of America, which in most respects resembled the United States Constitution, but limited the president to a single six-year term.
In spite of the strong two-term tradition, a few presidents before Roosevelt attempted to secure a third term. Following Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s reelection in 1872, there were serious discussions within Republican political circles about the possibility of his running again in 1876. But interest in a third term for Grant evaporated in the light of negative public opinion and opposition from members of Congress, and Grant left the presidency in 1877 after two terms. Even so, as the 1880 election approached, he sought nomination for a (non-consecutive) third term at the 1880 Republican National Convention, but narrowly lost to James A. Garfield, who won the 1880 election.

Theodore Roosevelt succeeded to the presidency on September 14, 1901, following William McKinley&#x27;s assassination ( days into his second term), and was handily elected to a full term in 1904. He declined to seek a third (second full) term in 1908, but did run again in the 1912 election, losing to Woodrow Wilson. Wilson himself, despite his ill health following a serious stroke, aspired to a third term. Many of his advisers tried to convince him that his health precluded another campaign, but Wilson nonetheless asked that his name be placed in nomination for the presidency at the 1920 Democratic National Convention. Democratic Party leaders were unwilling to support Wilson, and the nomination went to James M. Cox, who lost to Warren G. Harding. Wilson again contemplated running for a (non-consecutive) third term in 1924, devising a strategy for his comeback, but again lacked any support. He died in February of that year.

Franklin Roosevelt spent the months leading up to the 1940 Democratic National Convention refusing to say whether he would seek a third term. His vice president, John Nance Garner, along with Postmaster General James Farley, announced their candidacies for the Democratic nomination. When the convention came, Roosevelt sent a message to the convention saying he would run only if drafted, saying delegates were free to vote for whomever they pleased. This message was interpreted to mean he was willing to be drafted, and he was renominated on the convention&#x27;s first ballot. Roosevelt won a decisive victory over Republican Wendell Willkie, becoming the only president to exceed eight years in office. His decision to seek a third term dominated the election campaign. Willkie ran against the open-ended presidential tenure, while Democrats cited the war in Europe as a reason for breaking with precedent.

Four years later, Roosevelt faced Republican Thomas E. Dewey in the 1944 election. Near the end of the campaign, Dewey announced his support of a constitutional amendment to limit presidents to two terms. According to Dewey, &quot;four terms, or sixteen years [a direct reference to the president&#x27;s tenure in office four years hence] is the most dangerous threat to our freedom ever proposed.&quot; He also discreetly raised the issue of the president&#x27;s age. Roosevelt exuded enough energy and charisma to retain voters&#x27; confidence and was elected to a fourth term.

While he quelled rumors of poor health during the campaign, Roosevelt&#x27;s health was deteriorating. On April 12, 1945, only days after his fourth inauguration, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died, to be succeeded by Vice President Harry Truman. In the midterm elections months later, Republicans took control of the House and the Senate. As many of them had campaigned on the issue of presidential tenure, declaring their support for a constitutional amendment that would limit how long a person could serve as president, the issue was given priority in the 80th Congress when it convened in January 1947.

==Proposal and ratification==
===Proposal in Congress===

The House of Representatives took quick action, approving a proposed constitutional amendment (House Joint Resolution 27) setting a limit of two four-year terms for future presidents. Introduced by Earl C. Michener, the measure passed 285–121, with support from 47 Democrats, on February 6, 1947. Meanwhile, the Senate developed its own proposed amendment, which initially differed from the House proposal by requiring that the amendment be submitted to state ratifying conventions for ratification, rather than to the state legislatures, and by prohibiting any person who had served more than 365 days in each of two terms from further presidential service. Both of these provisions were removed when the full Senate took up the bill; however, a new provision was added. Put forward by Robert A. Taft, it clarified procedures governing the number of times a vice president who succeeded to the presidency might be elected to office. The amended proposal was passed 59–23, with 16 Democrats in favor, on March 12.

On March 21, the House agreed to the Senate&#x27;s revisions and approved the resolution to amend the Constitution. Afterward, the amendment imposing term limitations on future presidents was submitted to the states for ratification. The ratification process was completed on February 27, 1951, after it was sent to the states.

===Ratification by the states===


Once submitted to the states, the 22nd Amendment was ratified by:
# Maine: March 31, 1947
# Michigan: March 31, 1947
# Iowa: April 1, 1947
# Kansas: April 1, 1947
# New Hampshire: April 1, 1947
# Delaware: April 2, 1947
# Illinois: April 3, 1947

# Texas: February 22, 1951
# Utah: February 26, 1951
# Nevada: February 26, 1951
# Minnesota: February 27, 1951&lt;br&gt;Ratification was completed when the Minnesota Legislature ratified the amendment. On March 1, 1951, the Administrator of General Services, Jess Larson, issued a certificate proclaiming the 22nd Amendment duly ratified and part of the Constitution. The amendment was subsequently ratified by:
# North Carolina: February 28, 1951
# South Carolina: March 13, 1951
# Maryland: March 14, 1951
# Florida: April 16, 1951
# Alabama: May 4, 1951
Conversely, two states—Massachusetts and Oklahoma—rejected the amendment, while five (Arizona, Kentucky, Rhode Island, Washington, and West Virginia) took no action.

==Effect==

Because of the grandfather clause in Section 1, the amendment did not apply to Harry S. Truman, who was the incumbent president at the time it was submitted to the states by the Congress. This full exemption allowed Truman to run again in 1952. He had served nearly all of Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s unexpired 1945–1949 term and had been elected to a full four-year term beginning in 1949. But with his job approval rating at around 27%, and after a poor performance in the 1952 New Hampshire primary, Truman chose not to seek his party&#x27;s nomination. Since becoming operative in 1951, the amendment has barred six twice-elected presidents from election to a third term: Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Donald Trump, who was elected to two non-consecutive terms, will also be barred from seeking a third term as president.

Additionally, Lyndon B. Johnson was eligible for two terms as president, and Gerald Ford for one term, under the 22nd Amendment. In Johnson&#x27;s case, he had finished what was fourteen months, a little over a year, left of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidency. Thus, he was eligible for two terms and would have then been term limited to January 20, 1973. With Ford, he served over 28 months, or just over two years, of the remainder of Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidency. Had Ford won the 1976 election, he would have been term limited to January 20, 1981.

==Interaction with the Twelfth Amendment==

As worded, the focus of the 22nd Amendment is on limiting individuals from being elected to the presidency more than twice. Questions have been raised about the amendment&#x27;s meaning and application, especially in relation to the 12th Amendment, ratified in 1804, which states, &quot;no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.&quot; While the 12th Amendment stipulates that the constitutional qualifications of age, citizenship, and residency apply to the president and vice president, it is unclear whether someone who is ineligible to be elected president due to term limits could be elected vice president. Because of the ambiguity, a two-term former president could possibly be elected vice president and then succeed to the presidency as a result of the incumbent&#x27;s death, resignation, or removal from office, or succeed to become Acting President from another stated office in the presidential line of succession.

It has been argued that the 22nd Amendment and 12th Amendment bar any two-term president from later serving as vice president as well as from succeeding to the presidency from any point in the presidential line of succession. Others contend that the original intent of the 12th Amendment concerns qualification for service (age, residence, and citizenship), while the 22nd Amendment concerns qualifications for election, and thus a former two-term president is still eligible to serve as vice president. Neither amendment restricts the number of times someone can be elected to the vice presidency and then succeed to the presidency to serve out the balance of the term, although the person could be prohibited from running for election to an additional term. The practical applicability of this distinction has not been tested, as no person has been elected president and vice president in that order, regardless of terms served.

==Attempts at repeal or reform==

Over the years, several presidents have voiced their antipathy toward the amendment. After leaving office, Harry Truman described the amendment as stupid and one of the worst amendments of the Constitution with the exception of the Prohibition Amendment. A few days before leaving office in January 1989, President Ronald Reagan said he would push for a repeal of the 22nd Amendment because he thought it infringed on people&#x27;s democratic rights. In a November 2000 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, President Bill Clinton suggested that the 22nd Amendment should be altered to limit presidents to two consecutive terms but then allow for non-consecutive terms, because of longer life expectancies.

The first efforts in Congress to repeal the 22nd Amendment were undertaken in 1956, five years after the amendment&#x27;s ratification. Over the next 50 years, 54 joint resolutions seeking to repeal the two-term presidential election limit were introduced. Between 1997 and 2013, Representative José E. Serrano introduced nine resolutions (one per Congress, all unsuccessful) to repeal the amendment.

In January 2025, Representative Andy Ogles introduced a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment that would allow a president to serve a third term, provided that their first two are non-consecutive. The language of the bill was intended to specifically allow incumbent President Donald Trump to serve a third term, as he is the only living president to serve non-consecutive terms.

<doc id="70133" wikidata="Q215810" url="?curid=70133" title="Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution">
<text>The Twenty-third Amendment (Amendment XXIII) to the United States Constitution extends the right to participate in presidential elections to the District of Columbia. The amendment grants to the district electors in the Electoral College, as though it were a state, though the district can never have more electors than the least-populous state. How the electors are appointed is to be determined by Congress. The Twenty-third Amendment was proposed by the 86th Congress on June 16, 1960; it was ratified by the requisite number of states on March 29, 1961.

The Constitution provides that each state receives presidential electors equal to the combined number of seats it has in the Senate and the House of Representatives. As the District of Columbia is not a state, it was not entitled to any electors before the adoption of the Twenty-third Amendment. As early as 1888, some journalists and members of Congress favored a constitutional amendment to grant the district electoral votes. Still, such an amendment did not win widespread support until the rise of the civil rights movement in the 1950s. The amendment was not seen as a partisan measure; ratification of the amendment was endorsed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and both major party candidates in the 1960 presidential election. The amendment&#x27;s ratification made the district the only entity other than the states to have any representation in the Electoral College.

The first presidential election in which the District of Columbia participated was the election of 1964. Starting with that election, the District of Columbia has consistently had three members in the Electoral College, this being the constitutionally implied minimum number it is entitled to; notwithstanding the constitutionally entrenched limitation on its number of electors, the District&#x27;s population has never reached the threshold where it otherwise would have been entitled to more than three. Since the passage of the Twenty-third Amendment, all but one of the district&#x27;s electoral votes have been cast for the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential candidates. The Twenty-third Amendment did not grant the district voting rights in Congress, nor did it give the district the right to participate in the process that allows the Constitution to be amended. A constitutional amendment to do this was proposed by Congress in 1978, but not enough states ratified it for it to be adopted. Many citizens of the district favor statehood or further constitutional amendments to address these issues.

==Text==
==Background==
The United States Constitution&#x27;s rules for the composition of the House of Representatives and the Senate explicitly grant seats to states and no other entities. Similarly, electors (i.e., members of the Electoral College) are apportioned to states, not to territories or the federal district. The main reference to the federal district is in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power &quot;To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States.&quot; In the early existence of the District, it was too small and rural to merit a hypothetical seat in the House of Representatives anyway, with fewer than 30,000 inhabitants.

In 1888, a bill to amend the Constitution was introduced in Congress by Senator Henry Blair of New Hampshire to grant the District of Columbia voting rights in presidential elections, but it did not proceed. Theodore W. Noyes, a writer of the &quot;Washington Evening Star&quot;, published several stories in support of D.C. voting rights. Noyes also helped found the Citizens&#x27; Joint Committee on National Representation for the District of Columbia, a group which lobbied Congress to pass an amendment expanding D.C. voting rights. Noyes died in 1946, but the Citizens&#x27; Joint Committee continued onward, and the issue of district voting rights began to be seen as similar to the civil rights movement. A split developed between advocates for greater power for the district after World War II. The &quot;Evening Star&quot;, continuing in the Noyes mold, supported D.C. representation in Congress and the electoral college but opposed &quot;home rule&quot; (locally elected mayors and councils with actual power rather than direct rule by Congress). &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, however, supported &quot;home rule&quot; and civil rights but opposed full-fledged representation for the district. Additionally, while many of the people leading the push were liberal Democrats, the District of Columbia in the 1950s was fairly balanced in its potential voting impact; Democrats had only a slight edge over Republicans, although district Republicans in the 1950s were liberal by national standards. Thus, an amendment to grant the district increased voting powers could gain bipartisan support in a way that would have been more difficult later. Only 28% of the district was African-American according to the 1940 census, and the black population was young compared to other residents, making the voting electorate even smaller due to the voting age of 21. This grew to 54% in the 1960 census, but according to political scientist Clement E. Vose, &quot;various factors—inexperience in voting, educational handicaps, residency requirements, welfare laws, and social ostracism before the Voting Rights Act of 1965—minimized black registration and voting&quot;.

==Proposal and ratification==
===Adoption by the Congress===
Senate Joint Resolution–39, which would eventually become the Twenty-third Amendment, was introduced in 1959 by Tennessee Democratic senator Estes Kefauver. His proposal would provide for the emergency functioning of Congress and continuity of the legislative process by authorizing governors to fill vacancies in the House of Representatives &quot;on any date that the total number of vacancies ... exceeds half of the authorized membership.&quot; The governor&#x27;s appointive authority would have been limited to 60 days, and the appointee would have served until a successor was elected in a special election. The bill was amended twice on the Senate floor. One added provision, proposed by New York Republican Kenneth Keating, would grant the District of Columbia electoral votes in national elections and non-voting delegate(s) to the House. The other, offered by Florida Democrat Spessard Holland, would eliminate the poll tax or other property qualification as a prerequisite for voting in federal elections. The Senate passed SJR–39 in this three-amendment form on February 2, 1960, by a vote of 70–18, and sent it to the House.

The House Judiciary Committee, after setting aside the anti-poll tax and House emergency appointment provisions of SJR–39, sent its own proposal, House Joint Resolution–757, devoted solely to presidential electors for the District of Columbia, to the House floor for consideration. This was adopted in the House without amendment, by voice vote, on June 14, 1960. Then, by unanimous consent, the text of HJR–757 was inserted into SJR–39, the original language of which was removed. The Senate adopted the revised resolution by voice vote on June 16, 1960.

===Ratification by the states===
To become valid as part of the Constitution, the Twenty-third Amendment needed to be ratified by the legislatures of three-quarters of the states (38, following the admission of Alaska and Hawaii to the union in 1959) within seven years from its submission to the states by Congress (June 16, 1967). President Eisenhower, along with both major party candidates in the 1960 presidential election, Vice President Richard Nixon and Senator John F. Kennedy from Massachusetts, endorsed the proposal. Amendment supporters ran an effective ratification campaign, mobilizing persons in almost every state to press for its approval.

The following states ratified the amendment:
#Hawaii – June 23, 1960
#Massachusetts – August 22, 1960
#New Jersey – December 19, 1960
#New York – January 17, 1961
#California – January 19, 1961
#Oregon – January 27, 1961
#Maryland – January 30, 1961
#Idaho – January 31, 1961
#Maine – January 31, 1961
#Minnesota – January 31, 1961
#New Mexico – February 1, 1961
#Nevada – February 2, 1961
#Montana – February 6, 1961
#Colorado – February 8, 1961
#Washington – February 9, 1961
#West Virginia – February 9, 1961
#Alaska – February 10, 1961
#Wyoming – February 13, 1961
#South Dakota – February 14, 1961 (date of filing in Office of Secretary of State of South Dakota)
#Delaware – February 20, 1961
#Utah – February 21, 1961
#Wisconsin – February 21, 1961
#Pennsylvania – February 28, 1961
#Indiana – March 3, 1961
#North Dakota – March 3, 1961
#Tennessee – March 6, 1961
#Michigan – March 8, 1961
#Connecticut – March 9, 1961
#Arizona – March 10, 1961
#Illinois – March 14, 1961
#Nebraska – March 15, 1961
#Vermont – March 15, 1961
#Iowa – March 16, 1961
#Missouri – March 20, 1961
#Oklahoma – March 21, 1961
#Rhode Island – March 22, 1961
#Kansas – March 29, 1961
#Ohio – March 29, 1961

Ratification was completed on March 29, 1961, 9 months and 12 days after being proposed by Congress. The following states subsequently ratified the amendment:
:39. New Hampshire – March 30, 1961 (Date in the official notice; preceded by ratification on March 29, 1961, as the 37th state to ratify, which was annulled and then repeated later that same day.)
:40. Alabama – April 11, 2002

On April 3, 1961, John L. Moore, Administrator of General Services, certified that the amendment had been adopted by the requisite number of States and had become a part of the Constitution.

The amendment was rejected by Arkansas on January 24, 1961. Nine states took no action on the amendment: Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Texas, North Carolina, and Virginia.

==Implementing legislation==

The Amendment granted Congress the power to determine how the District of Columbia&#x27;s electors should be appointed. In October 1961, Congress enacted legislation to amend the DC Code by providing that the District&#x27;s electors should be appointed based on a popular vote, with all electors awarded to the presidential ticket prevailing in the ballot.

In 1973, Congress enacted the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, delegating to the Council of the District of Columbia certain legislative powers over the District (subject to Congressional override). The DC Council subsequently passed legislation affecting the appointment of DC&#x27;s presidential electors, most notably by adopting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact in 2010.

== Political impact ==

While perceived as politically neutral and only somewhat liberal-leaning at the time of passage in 1961, the district swung dramatically toward the Democratic Party in the years after passage. African Americans voted in more significant numbers than they had in the 1940s and 1950s with the clearing away of restrictions on the vote, and their share of the district electorate increased; according to the 1970 census, 71% of the federal district was black, a dramatic jump. In line with black voters&#x27; strong support for the Democrats, the district has sent its three electoral votes to the Democratic candidate in every single presidential election since 1964, including the 1984 landslide re-election of President Reagan, where only the District of Columbia and Minnesota voted for Democratic candidate Walter Mondale. The district&#x27;s electoral votes have never proven decisive in a presidential election; the smallest Electoral College majority won by a Democratic president since the Twenty-third Amendment&#x27;s ratification was Jimmy Carter&#x27;s 57 point win in 1976.

Unaddressed by the Twenty-third Amendment were the parallel issues of congressional representation and &quot;home rule&quot; for the district. On December 24, 1973, Congress approved the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which established an elected office of mayor and a 13-member elected council for the district. These officials were empowered to pass laws and enact administrative policies for the district, though Congress retained veto power if they chose to intervene. On September 22, 1970, President Nixon signed the District of Columbia Delegate Act, which authorized voters in the district to elect one non-voting delegate to represent them in the House of Representatives. The election to fill the seat was held on March 23, 1970. On August 22, 1978, Congress submitted the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment to the states for ratification. This sweeping proposal would have granted the District of Columbia full representation in the United States Congress as if it were a state, repealed the Twenty-third Amendment and granted the district full representation in the Electoral College plus participation in the process by which the Constitution is amended as if it were a state. The amendment failed to become part of the Constitution, however, as it was not ratified by the required number of states (38) prior to its August 22, 1985 ratification deadline. The campaign for the proposed amendment ran into much fiercer conservative opposition due to the open and obvious fact that by 1978 the proposed amendment would have practically guaranteed two Democratic senators for some time; the amendment was criticized on various other grounds as well, and was not ratified even by several more &quot;liberal&quot; states.

<text>The Twenty-fourth Amendment (Amendment XXIV) of the United States Constitution prohibits both Congress and the states from requiring the payment of a poll tax or any other tax to vote in federal elections. The amendment was proposed by Congress to the states on August 27, 1962, and was ratified by the states on January 23, 1964.

Southern states of the former Confederate States of America adopted poll taxes both in their state laws and in their state constitutions throughout the late-19th and early-20th centuries. This became more widespread as the Democratic Party regained control of most levels of government in the South in the decades after Reconstruction. The purpose of poll taxes was to prevent African Americans and poor whites from voting. Use of the poll tax by states was held to be constitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in the 1937 case &quot;Breedlove v. Suttles&quot;.

When the 24th Amendment was ratified in 1964, five states still retained a poll tax: Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas and Virginia. The amendment prohibited a poll tax for voters in federal elections, but it was not until 1966 that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6–3 in &quot;Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections&quot; that poll taxes for any level of elections were unconstitutional. It stated that these violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Subsequent litigation related to potential discriminatory effects of voter registration requirements has generally been based on application of this clause.

==Text==

==Background==


Southern states had adopted the poll tax as a requirement for voting as part of a series of laws in the late 19th century intended to exclude black Americans from politics so far as practicable without violating the Fifteenth Amendment. This required that voting not be limited by &quot;race, color, or previous condition of servitude&quot;. All voters were required to pay the poll tax, but in practice it most affected the poor. Notably this affected both African Americans and poor white voters, some of whom had voted with Populist and Fusionist candidates in the late 19th century, temporarily disturbing Democratic rule. Proponents of the poll tax downplayed this aspect and assured white voters they would not be affected. Passage of poll taxes began in earnest in the 1890s, as Democrats wanted to prevent another Populist-Republican coalition. Despite election violence and fraud, African Americans were still winning numerous local seats. By 1902, all eleven states of the former Confederacy had enacted a poll tax, many within new constitutions that contained other provisions as barriers to voter registration, such as literacy or comprehension tests administered subjectively by white workers. The poll tax was used together with other devices such as grandfather clauses and the &quot;white primary&quot; designed to exclude blacks, as well as threats and acts of violence. For example, potential voters had to be &quot;assessed&quot; in Arkansas, and blacks were utterly ignored in the assessment.

From 1900 to 1937, such use of the poll tax was nearly ignored by the federal government. Several state-level initiatives repealed poll taxes during this period for two reasons: firstly that they encouraged corruption since wealthy persons could and would pay other people&#x27;s poll taxes; secondly, because they discouraged white voting more than many populist Southern politicians desired. The poll tax survived a legal challenge in the 1937 Supreme Court case &quot;Breedlove v. Suttles&quot;, which unanimously ruled that

The issue remained prominent, as most African Americans in the South were disenfranchised. President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke out against the tax. He publicly called it &quot;a remnant of the Revolutionary period&quot; that the country had moved past. However, Roosevelt&#x27;s favored liberal Democrats in the South lost in the 1938 primaries to the reigning conservative Southern Democrats, and he backed off the issue. He felt that he needed Southern Democratic votes to pass New Deal programs and did not want to further antagonize them. Still, efforts at the Congressional level to abolish the poll tax continued. A 1939 bill to abolish the poll tax in federal elections was tied up by the Southern Bloc, lawmakers whose long tenure in office from a one-party region gave them seniority and command of numerous important committee chairmanships. A discharge petition was able to force the bill to be considered, and the House passed the bill 254–84. However, the bill was unable to defeat a filibuster in the Senate by Southern senators and a few Northern allies who valued the support of the powerful and senior Southern seats. This bill would be re-proposed in the next several Congresses. It came closest to passage during World War II, when opponents framed abolition as a means to help overseas soldiers vote. However, after learning that the U.S. Supreme Court decision &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; (1944) banned the use of &quot;white primary&quot;, the Southern block refused to approve abolition of the poll tax.

In 1946, the Senate came close to passing the bill. 24 Democrats and 15 Republicans approved an end to debate, while 7non-southern Democrats and 7Republicans joined the 19 Southern Democrats in opposition. The result was a 39–33 vote in favor of the bill, but a cloture vote to end the filibuster required a two-thirds supermajority of 48 votes at the time, and so the bill was not brought to a vote. Those in favor of abolition of the poll tax considered a constitutional amendment after the 1946 defeat, but that idea did not advance either.

The tenor of the debate changed in the 1940s. Southern politicians tried to re-frame the debate as a constitutional issue, but private correspondence indicates that black disenfranchisement was still the true concern. For instance, Mississippi Senator Theodore Bilbo declared, &quot;If the poll tax bill passes, the next step will be an effort to remove the registration qualification, the educational qualification of Negroes. If that is done we will have no way of preventing the Negroes from voting.&quot; This fear explains why even Southern Senators from states that had abolished the poll tax still opposed the bill; they did not want to set a precedent that the federal government could interfere in state elections.

President Harry S. Truman established the President&#x27;s Committee on Civil Rights, which among other issues investigated the poll tax. Considering that opposition to federal poll tax regulation in 1948 was claimed as based on the Constitution, the Committee noted that a constitutional amendment might be the best way to proceed. Still, little occurred during the 1950s. Members of the anti-poll tax movement laid low during the anti-Communist frenzy of the period; some of the main proponents of poll tax abolition, such as Joseph Gelders and Vito Marcantonio, had been committed Marxists.

President John F. Kennedy returned to this issue. His administration urged Congress to adopt and send such an amendment to the states for ratification. He considered the constitutional amendment the best way to avoid a filibuster, as the claim that federal abolition of the poll tax was unconstitutional would be moot. Still, some liberals opposed Kennedy&#x27;s action, feeling that an amendment would be too slow compared to legislation. Spessard Holland, a conservative Democrat from Florida, introduced the amendment to the Senate. Holland had opposed most civil rights legislation during his career, and his support helped splinter monolithic Southern opposition to the amendment. Holland had tried several times earlier in his Senate career to ban the poll tax, but had been unsuccessful. Ratification of the amendment was relatively quick, taking slightly more than a year; it was rapidly ratified by state legislatures across the country from August 1962 to January 1964.

President Lyndon B. Johnson called the amendment a &quot;triumph of liberty over restriction&quot; and &quot;a verification of people&#x27;s rights&quot;. States that had maintained the poll tax were more reserved. Mississippi&#x27;s Attorney General, Joseph Turner Patterson, complained about the complexity of two sets of votersthose who had paid their poll tax and could vote in all elections, and those who had not and could vote only in federal elections. Additionally, non-payers could still be deterred by such requirements as having to register far in advance of the election and retain records of such registration. Some states also continued to exercise discrimination in the application of literacy tests.

==Proposal and ratification==


Congress proposed the Twenty-fourth Amendment on August 27, 1962. The amendment was submitted to the states on September 24, 1962, after it passed with the requisite two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate. The final vote in the House was 295–86 (132–15 in the House Republican Conference and 163–71 in the House Democratic Caucus) with 54 members voting present or abstaining, while in the Senate the final vote was 77–16 (30–1 in the Senate Republican Conference and 47–15 in the Senate Democratic Caucus) with 7members voting present or abstaining. The following states ratified the amendment:
# Illinois (November 14, 1962)
# New Jersey (December 3, 1962)
# Oregon (January 25, 1963)
# Montana (January 28, 1963)

# Kentucky (June 27, 1963)
# Maine (January 16, 1964)
# South Dakota (January 23, 1964)

Ratification was completed on January 23, 1964. The Georgia legislature did make a last-second attempt to be the 38th state to ratify. This was a surprise as &quot;no Southern help could be expected&quot; for the amendment. The Georgia Senate quickly and unanimously passed it, but the House did not act in time. Georgia&#x27;s ratification was apparently dropped after South Dakota&#x27;s ratification.

The amendment was subsequently ratified by the following states:
The following state rejected the amendment:
# Mississippi (December 20, 1962)

The following states have not ratified the amendment:
# Arizona
# Arkansas
# Georgia
# Louisiana
# Oklahoma
# South Carolina
# Wyoming

==Post-ratification law==

Arkansas effectively repealed its poll tax for all elections with Amendment 51 to the Arkansas Constitution at the November 1964 general election, several months after this amendment was ratified. The poll-tax language was not completely stricken from its Constitution until Amendment 85 in 2008. Of the five states originally affected by this amendment, Arkansas was the only one to repeal its poll tax; the other four retained their taxes. These were struck down in 1966 by the US Supreme Court decision in &quot;Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections&quot; (1966), which ruled poll taxes unconstitutional even for state elections. Federal district courts in Alabama and Texas, respectively, struck down these states&#x27; poll taxes less than two months before the &quot;Harper&quot; ruling was issued.

The state of Virginia accommodated the amendment by providing an &quot;escape clause&quot; to the poll tax. In lieu of paying the poll tax, a prospective voter could file paperwork to gain a certificate establishing a place of residence in Virginia. The papers would have to be filed six months in advance of voting, and the voter had to provide a copy of that certificate at the time of voting. This measure was expected to decrease the number of legal voters. In the 1965 Supreme Court decision &quot;Harman v. Forssenius&quot;, the Court unanimously found such measures unconstitutional. It declared that for federal elections, &quot;the poll tax is abolished absolutely as a prerequisite to voting, and no equivalent or milder substitute may be imposed.&quot;

While not directly related to the Twenty-fourth Amendment, the &quot;Harper&quot; case held that the poll tax was unconstitutional at every level, not just for federal elections. The &quot;Harper&quot; decision relied upon the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, rather than the Twenty-fourth Amendment. As such, issues related to whether burdens on voting are equivalent to poll taxes in discriminatory effect have usually been litigated on Equal Protection grounds since.

<text>The Twenty-fifth Amendment (Amendment XXV) to the United States Constitution addresses issues related to presidential succession and disability.

It clarifies that the vice president becomes president if the president dies, resigns, or is removed from office by impeachment. It also establishes the procedure for filling a vacancy in the office of the vice president. Additionally, the amendment provides for the temporary transfer of the president&#x27;s powers and duties to the vice president, either on the president&#x27;s initiative alone or on the initiative of the vice president together with a majority of the president&#x27;s cabinet. In either case, the vice president becomes the acting president until the president&#x27;s powers and duties are restored.

The amendment was submitted to the states on July 6, 1965, by the 89th Congress, and was adopted on February 10, 1967, the day the requisite number of states (38) ratified it.

== Text and effect ==
=== Section 1: Presidential succession ===

Section 1 clarifies that in the enumerated situations the vice president becomes president, instead of merely assuming the powers and duties of the presidency as acting president. It operates automatically, without needing to be explicitly invoked.

=== Section 2: Vice presidential vacancy ===

Section 2 provides a mechanism for filling a vacancy in the vice presidency. Before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, a vice-presidential vacancy continued until a new vice president took office at the start of the next presidential term; the vice presidency had become vacant several times due to death, resignation, or succession to the presidency, and these vacancies had often lasted several years.

=== Section 3: President&#x27;s declaration of inability ===
Section 3 allows the president to voluntarily transfer presidential authority to the vice president (for example, in anticipation of a medical procedure) by declaring in writing his inability to discharge the presidency&#x27;s powers and duties. The vice president then assumes those powers and duties as acting president. The vice president does not &quot;become&quot; president; the president remains in office without authority. The president regains those powers and duties upon declaring in writing his ability to discharge them.

=== Section 4: Declaration by vice president and cabinet members of president&#x27;s inability ===
Section 4 addresses the case of a president who cannot discharge the powers and duties of the presidency but also cannot, or does not, execute the voluntary declaration contemplated by Section3. It allows the vice president, together with a &quot;majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide&quot;, to issue a written declaration that the president is unable to discharge his duties. When such a declaration is sent to Congress, the vice president immediately becomes acting president, while (as with Section3) the president remains in office, temporarily divested of authority.

John Feerick, the principal draftsman of the amendment, writes that Congress deliberately left the terms &quot;unable&quot; and &quot;inability&quot; undefined &quot;since cases of inability could take various forms not neatly fitting into [a rigid] definition... The debates surrounding the Twenty-fifth Amendment indicate that [those terms] are intended to cover all cases in which some condition or circumstance prevents the President from discharging his powers and duties&quot;. A survey of scholarship on the amendment found

Among potential examples of such unforeseen emergencies, legal scholars have listed kidnapping of the president and &quot;political emergencies&quot; such as impeachment. Traits such as unpopularity, incompetence, impeachable conduct, poor judgment, or laziness might not in themselves constitute inability, but should such traits &quot;rise to a level where they prevented the President from carrying out his or her constitutional duties, they still might constitute an inability, even in the absence of a formal medical diagnosis.&quot; In addition, a president who already manifested disabling traits at the time he was elected is not thereby immunized from a declaration of inability.

The &quot;principal officers of the executive department[s]&quot; are the 15 Cabinet members enumerated in the United States Code at :

* Secretary of State
* Secretary of the Treasury
* Secretary of Defense
* Attorney General
* Secretary of the Interior
* Secretary of Agriculture
* Secretary of Commerce
* Secretary of Labor
* Secretary of Health and Human Services
* Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
* Secretary of Transportation
* Secretary of Energy
* Secretary of Education
* Secretary of Veterans Affairs
* Secretary of Homeland Security

Acting secretaries can participate in issuing the declaration.

If the president subsequently issues a declaration claiming to be able, then a four-day period begins during which the vice president remains acting president. If, by the end of this period, the vice president and a majority of the &quot;principal officers&quot; have not issued a second declaration of the president&#x27;s inability, the president resumes his powers and duties; but if they do issue a second declaration within the four days, then the vice president remains acting president while Congress considers the matter. Then, if within 21 days the Senate and the House determine, each by a two-thirds vote, that the president is unable, the vice president continues as acting president; otherwise the president resumes his powers and duties.

Section 4&#x27;s requirement of a two-thirds vote in both the House and the Senate is stricter than the Constitution&#x27;s requirement for impeachment and removal of the president for &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot;—a &quot;majority&quot; of the House followed by two-thirds of the Senate. In addition, an impeached president retains his authority unless and until the Senate votes to remove him or her at the end of an impeachment trial; in contrast, should Congress be called upon to decide the question of the president&#x27;s ability or inability under Section4, presidential authority remains in the hands of the vice president (as acting president) unless and until the question is resolved in the president&#x27;s favor.

== Historical background ==
ArticleII, Section1, Clause6 of the Constitution reads:
This provision is ambiguous as to whether, in the enumerated circumstances, the vice president becomes the president or merely assumes the &quot;powers and duties&quot; of the presidency. It also fails to define what constitutes &quot;inability&quot; or how questions concerning inability are to be resolved. The Twenty-fifth Amendment addresses these deficiencies. The ambiguities in ArticleII, Section1, Clause6 of the Constitution regarding death, resignation, removal, or disability of the president created difficulties several times:
* In 1841, William Henry Harrison died in office. It had previously been suggested that the vice president would become acting president upon the president&#x27;s death, but Vice President John Tyler asserted that he had succeeded to the presidency, instead of merely assuming its powers and duties; he also declined to acknowledge documents referring to him as &quot;acting president&quot;. Although Tyler felt his vice presidential oath obviated any need for the presidential oath, he was persuaded that being formally sworn in would resolve any doubts. Accordingly, he took the oath and title of &quot;President&quot;, without any qualifiers, moved into the White House, and assumed full presidential powers. Though Tyler was sometimes derided as &quot;His Accidency&quot;, both houses of Congress adopted a resolution confirming that he was president. The &quot;Tyler precedent&quot; of succession was thus established, and subsequently Vice Presidents Millard Fillmore (1850), Andrew Johnson (1865), Chester A. Arthur (1881), Theodore Roosevelt (1901), Calvin Coolidge (1923), Harry S. Truman (1945), and Lyndon B. Johnson (1963) were all deemed to have become president on the death of incumbent presidents.
* In 1893, Grover Cleveland secretly had cancer surgery, after which he was incapacitated for a time and kept from public view.
* Following Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s stroke in 1919, no one officially assumed his powers and duties, in part because his wife, Edith Wilson, and the White House physician, Cary T. Grayson, kept his condition secret. By the time Wilson&#x27;s condition became public knowledge, only a few months remained in his term and Congressional leaders were disinclined to press the issue.
* Up to 1967, the office of vice president had become vacant 16 times when the vice president died, resigned, or succeeded to the presidency. The vacancy created when Andrew Johnson succeeded to the presidency upon Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s assassination was one of several that encompassed nearly an entire four-year term. In 1868, Johnson was impeached by the House of Representatives and came one vote short of being removed from office by the Senate in his impeachment trial. Had Johnson been removed, President pro tempore Benjamin Wade would have become acting president in accordance with the Presidential Succession Act of 1792.
* After several periods of incapacity due to severe health problems, President Dwight D. Eisenhower attempted to clarify procedures through a signed agreement with Vice President Richard Nixon, drafted by Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr., but this agreement had no legal authority. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in September 1955 and intestinal problems requiring emergency surgery in July 1956. Each time, until Eisenhower was able to resume his duties, Nixon presided over Cabinet meetings and, along with Eisenhower aides, kept the executive branch functioning and assured the public the situation was under control. But Nixon refused to use the president&#x27;s White House office or sit in the president&#x27;s chair at Cabinet meetings.
The 1951 novel &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; and its 1954 film version influenced the amendment&#x27;s drafters. John D. Feerick told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2018 that the film was a &quot;live depiction&quot; of the type of crisis that could arise &quot;if a president ever faced questions about physical or mental inabilities but disagreed completely with the judgment&quot;, a situation the Constitution did not address. Lawmakers and lawyers drafting the amendment wanted no such &quot;Article 184 situation&quot; in which the vice president or others could depose the president merely by saying that he was &quot;disabled&quot;.

== Proposal, enactment, and ratification ==
=== Keating–Kefauver proposal ===

In 1963, Senator Kenneth Keating of New York proposed a Constitutional amendment that would have enabled Congress to enact legislation providing for how to determine when a president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the presidency, rather than, as the Twenty-fifth Amendment does, having the Constitution so provide. This proposal was based upon a recommendation of the American Bar Association in 1960.

The text of the proposal read:
Senators raised concerns that the Congress could either abuse such authority or neglect to enact any such legislation after the adoption of this proposal. Tennessee senator Estes Kefauver, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, a longtime advocate for addressing the disability question, spearheaded the effort until he died in August 1963. Keating was defeated in the 1964 election, but Senator Roman Hruska of Nebraska took up Keating&#x27;s cause as a new member of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments.

=== Kennedy assassination ===

By the 1960s, medical advances had made it increasingly plausible that an injured or ill president might live a long time while incapacitated. The assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 underscored the need for a clear procedure for determining presidential disability, particularly since the new president, Lyndon B. Johnson, had once suffered a heart attack and—with the office of vice president to remain vacant until the next term began on January 20, 1965—the next two people in the line of succession were the 71-year-old speaker of the House, John McCormack, and the 86-year-old Senate president pro tempore, Carl Hayden. Senator Birch Bayh succeeded Kefauver as chairman of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments and set about advocating a detailed amendment dealing with presidential disability.

=== Bayh–Celler proposal ===

On January 6, 1965, Senator Birch Bayh proposed S.J. Res.1 in the Senate and Representative Emanuel Celler (Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee) proposed H.J. Res.1 in the House of Representatives. Their proposal specified the process by which a president could be declared &quot;unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office&quot;, thereby making the vice president an acting president, and how the president could regain the powers of his office. Their proposal also provided a way to fill a vacancy in the office of vice president before the next presidential election. This was as opposed to the Keating–Kefauver proposal, which provided neither for filling a vacancy in the office of vice president before the next presidential election nor a process for determining presidential disability. In 1964, the American Bar Association endorsed the type of proposal Bayh and Celler advocated. On January 28, 1965, President Johnson endorsed S.J. Res.1 in a statement to Congress. The proposal received bipartisan support.

On February 19, the Senate passed the amendment, but the House passed a different version of the amendment on April13. On April22 it was returned to the Senate with revisions. There were four areas of disagreement between the House and Senate versions:
* the Senate official who was to receive any written declaration under the amendment;
* the period of time during which the vice president and principal officers of the executive departments must decide whether they disagree with the president&#x27;s declaration that he is fit to resume the duties of the presidency;
* the time before Congress meets to resolve the issue;
* the time limit for Congress to reach a decision.
On July 6, after a conference committee ironed out differences between the versions, the amendment&#x27;s final version passed both houses of Congress and was presented to the states for ratification.

=== Ratification ===

Nebraska was the first state to ratify the amendment, on July12, 1965, and ratification became complete when Nevada became the 38th state to ratify it, on February10, 1967.

When President Lyndon B. Johnson underwent planned surgery in 1965, he was unable to temporarily transfer power to Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey because the amendment&#x27;s ratification remained incomplete. On February23, 1967, at the White House ceremony certifying the ratification, Johnson said:
== Invocations ==
=== Sections 1 and 2: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Nelson Rockefeller ===
On October 10, 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned, following a controversy over his personal taxes; two days later, President Richard Nixon nominated Representative Gerald Ford to replace Agnew as vice president pursuant to Section2. Ford was confirmed by the Senate and the House on November27 and December6, respectively, and sworn in on December6.

On August 9, 1974, Nixon resigned due to the Watergate scandal and Ford became president under Section1, the only president never to have been elected to either the presidency or the vice presidency. The office of vice president was thus again vacant, and on August20 Ford nominated former New York governor Nelson Rockefeller. Rockefeller was confirmed by the Senate and the House on December 10 and 19, respectively, and sworn in on December 19.

Feerick writes that the Twenty-fifth Amendment helped pave the way for Nixon&#x27;s resignation during the Watergate scandal. Nixon and Agnew were Republicans, and in the months immediately following Agnew&#x27;s resignation, with the vice presidency empty, Nixon&#x27;s removal or resignation would have transferred the presidential powers to House Speaker Carl Albert, a Democrat. But once Ford, a Republican, became vice president under Section 2, Nixon&#x27;s removal became more palatable because it would not change the party holding the presidency, and therefore &quot;the momentum for exposing the truth about Nixon&#x27;s involvement in Watergate increased&quot;.

=== Section 3 ===
On December 22, 1978, President Jimmy Carter considered invoking Section3 in advance of hemorrhoid surgery. Since then, presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump also contemplated invoking Section3 at various times without doing so.

==== 1985: Ronald Reagan - George H. W. Bush as acting president====

On July 12, 1985, President Ronald Reagan underwent a colonoscopy and was diagnosed with bowel cancer. He elected to have the lesion removed immediately, and consulted with White House counsel Fred Fielding about whether to invoke Section3, and in particular about whether doing so would set an undesirable precedent. Fielding and White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan recommended that Reagan transfer power, and two letters were drafted: one specifically invoking Section3, the other mentioning only that Reagan was mindful of its provisions. On July 13, Reagan signed the letter mentioning that he was mindful of Section 3 before being placed under general anesthesia for a colectomy, and Vice President George H. W. Bush was acting president from 11:28 a.m. until 7:22 pm, when Reagan transmitted a letter declaring himself able to resume his duties.

In the &quot;Fordham Law Review&quot;, commentator John Feerick asserted that although Reagan disclaimed any use of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in his letter (likely out of &quot;fear of the reaction of the country and the world to a &#x27;President&#x27; who admitted to being disabled, and concern ... [over] set[ting] a harmful precedent&quot;), he followed the process set forth in Section3. Furthermore, Feerick noted that &quot;no constitutional provision except the Twenty-Fifth Amendment would have allowed&quot; him to designate the vice president as acting president. Reagan later wrote in a memoir that he had, in fact, invoked the Twenty-fifth Amendment.

==== 2002 and 2007: George W. Bush - Dick Cheney as acting president ====
On June 29, 2002, President George W. Bush explicitly invoked Section3 in temporarily transferring his powers to Vice President Dick Cheney before undergoing a colonoscopy, which began at 7:09 am. Bush awoke about forty minutes later, but refrained from resuming his presidential powers until 9:24 a.m. to ensure that no aftereffects remained. According to his staff, Cheney (as acting president) held his regular national security and homeland security meetings with aides at the White House, but made no appearances and took no recorded actions while acting president.

On July 21, 2007, Bush invoked Section3 before another colonoscopy. Cheney was acting president from 7:16 a.m. until 9:21 am. During that time, Cheney remained at home. Neither invocation received much attention in the press.

In the view of commentator Adam Gustafson, George W. Bush&#x27;s unambiguous application of Section3 &quot;rectified&quot; President Reagan&#x27;s &quot;ambivalent invocation&quot; and provided an example of a &quot;smooth and temporary transition&quot; under Section3 that paved the way for future applications. The two invocations established the reasonableness of invocation for relatively minor inabilities, promoting continuity in the Executive Branch.

==== 2021: Joe Biden - Kamala Harris as acting president ====
On November 19, 2021, President Joe Biden temporarily transferred his powers and duties to Vice President Kamala Harris before undergoing a colonoscopy, making her acting president from 10:10 a.m. until 11:35 a.m. This is the first time a woman held the powers and duties of the president of the United States.

=== Section 4 ===

Section 4 has never been invoked.

== Considered invocations of Section 4 ==

=== 1981: Reagan assassination attempt ===


Following the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan on March30, 1981, Vice President George H. W. Bush did not assume the presidential powers and duties as acting president. Reagan had been rushed into surgery with no opportunity to invoke Section3; Bush did not invoke Section4 because he was on a plane at the time of the shooting, and Reagan was out of surgery by the time Bush landed in Washington. In 1995, Birch Bayh, the primary sponsor of the amendment in the Senate, wrote that Section4 should have been invoked. Physician to the President Daniel Ruge, who supervised Reagan&#x27;s treatment immediately after the shooting, said he had erred by not having Reagan invoke Section3 because Reagan needed general anesthesia and was in an intensive care unit.

=== 2021: Trump and the Capitol attack ===
After the January 6 United States Capitol attack, President Donald Trump was accused of having incited the incident, and by evening some of his Cabinet members were reportedly considering trying to get Vice President Mike Pence to agree to invoke Section4.

<doc id="70136" wikidata="Q219274" url="?curid=70136" title="Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution">
<text>The Twenty-sixth Amendment (Amendment XXVI) to the United States Constitution establishes a nationally standardized minimum age of 18 for participation in state and federal elections. It was proposed by Congress on March 23, 1971, and three-fourths of the states ratified it by July 1, 1971.

Various public officials had supported lowering the voting age during the mid-20th century, but were unable to gain the legislative momentum necessary for passing a constitutional amendment.

The drive to lower the voting age from 21 to 18 grew across the country during the 1960&#x27;s and was driven in part by the military draft held during the Vietnam War. The draft conscripted young men between the ages of 18 and 21 into the United States Armed Forces, primarily the U.S. Army, to serve in or support military combat operations in Vietnam. This means young men could be required to fight and possibly die for their nation in wartime at 18. However, these same citizens could not have a legal say in the government&#x27;s decision to wage that war until the age of 21. A youth rights movement emerged in response, calling for a similarly reduced voting age. A common slogan of proponents of lowering the voting age was &quot;old enough to fight, old enough to vote&quot;.

Determined to get around inaction on the issue, congressional allies included a provision for the 18-year-old vote in a 1970 bill that extended the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court subsequently held in the case of &quot;Oregon v. Mitchell&quot; that Congress could not lower the voting age for state and local elections. Recognizing the confusion and costs that would be involved in maintaining separate voting rolls and elections for federal and state contests, Congress quickly proposed and the states ratified the Twenty-sixth Amendment.

== Text ==
==Background==

The framers of the U.S. Constitution did not establish specific criteria for national citizenship or voting qualifications in state or federal elections. Before the Twenty-sixth Amendment, states had the authority to set their own minimum voting ages, which was typically 21 as the national standard.

Senator Harley Kilgore began advocating for a lowered voting age in 1941 in the 77th Congress. Despite the support of fellow senators, representatives, and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, Congress failed to pass any national change. However, public interest in lowering the voting age became a topic of interest at the local level. In 1943 and 1955 respectively, the Georgia and Kentucky legislatures approved measures to lower the voting age to 18.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in his 1954 State of the Union address, became the first president to publicly support prohibiting age-based denials of suffrage for those 18 and older. During the 1960s, both Congress and the state legislatures came under increasing pressure to lower the minimum voting age from 21 to 18. This was in large part due to the Vietnam War, in which many young men who were ineligible to vote were conscripted to fight in the war, thus lacking any means to influence the people sending them off to risk their lives. &quot;Old enough to fight, old enough to vote&quot; was a common slogan used by proponents of lowering the voting age. The slogan traced its roots to World War II, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt lowered the military draft age to 18.

In 1963, the President&#x27;s Commission on Registration and Voting Participation, in its report to President Lyndon Johnson, encouraged lowering the voting age. Johnson proposed an immediate national grant of the right to vote to 18-year-olds on May 29, 1968. Historian Thomas H. Neale argues that the move to lower the voting age followed a historical pattern similar to other extensions of the franchise; with the escalation of the war in Vietnam, constituents were mobilized and eventually a constitutional amendment passed.

Those advocating for a lower voting age drew on a range of arguments to promote their cause, and scholarship increasingly links the rise of support for a lower voting age to young people&#x27;s role in the civil rights movement and other movements for social and political change of the 1950s and 1960s. Increasing high-school graduation rates and young people&#x27;s access to political information through new technologies also influenced more positive views of their preparation for the most important right of citizenship.

Between 1942, when public debates about a lower voting age began in earnest, and the early 1970s, ideas about youth agency increasingly challenged the caretaking model that had previously dominated the nation&#x27;s approaches to young people&#x27;s rights. Characteristics traditionally associated with youth—idealism, lack of &quot;vested interests&quot;, and openness to new ideas—came to be seen as positive qualities for a political system that seemed to be in crisis.

In 1970, Senator Ted Kennedy proposed amending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to lower the voting age nationally. On June 22, 1970, President Richard Nixon signed an extension of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that required the voting age to be 18 in all federal, state, and local elections. In his statement on signing the extension, Nixon said:
Subsequently, Oregon and Texas challenged the law in court, and the case came before the Supreme Court in 1970 as &quot;Oregon v. Mitchell&quot;. By this time, four states had a minimum voting age below 21: Georgia, Kentucky, Alaska, and Hawaii.

===&quot;Oregon v. Mitchell&quot;===
During debate of the 1970 extension of the Voting Rights Act, Senator Ted Kennedy argued that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed Congress to pass national legislation lowering the voting age. In &quot;Katzenbach v. Morgan&quot; (1966), the Supreme Court had ruled that if Congress acted to enforce the 14th Amendment by passing a law declaring that a type of state law discriminates against a certain class of persons, the Supreme Court would let the law stand if the justices could &quot;perceive a basis&quot; for Congress&#x27;s actions.

President Nixon disagreed with Kennedy in a letter to the Speaker of the House and the House minority and majority leaders, asserting that the issue was not whether the voting age should be lowered, but how. In his own interpretation of &quot;Katzenbach&quot;, Nixon argued that to include age as a possible parameter of discrimination would overstretch the concept, and voiced concerns that the damage of a Supreme Court decision to overturn the Voting Rights Act could be disastrous.

In &quot;Oregon v. Mitchell&quot; (1970), the Supreme Court considered whether the voting-age provisions Congress added to the Voting Rights Act in 1970 were constitutional. The Court struck down the provisions that established 18 as the voting age in state and local elections. However, the Court upheld the provision establishing the voting age as 18 in federal elections. The Court was deeply divided in this case, and a majority of justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.

The decision resulted in states being able to maintain 21 as the voting age in state and local elections, but being required to establish separate voter rolls so that voters between 18 and 21 years old could vote in federal elections.

===Opposition===
Although the Twenty-sixth Amendment passed faster than any other constitutional amendment, about 17 states refused to pass measures to lower their minimum voting ages after Nixon signed the 1970 extension to the Voting Rights Act. Opponents to extending the vote to youths questioned the maturity and responsibility of people at the age of 18. Representative Emanuel Celler of New York, one of the most vocal opponents of a lower voting age from the 1940s through 1970 (and Chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee for much of that period), insisted that youth lacked &quot;the good judgment&quot; essential to good citizenship and that the qualities that made youth good soldiers did not also make them good voters.

Professor William G. Carleton wondered why the vote was proposed for youth at a time when the period of adolescence had grown so substantially rather than in the past when people had more responsibilities at earlier ages. Carleton further criticized the move to lower the voting age, citing American preoccupations with youth in general, exaggerated reliance on higher education, and equating technological savvy with responsibility and intelligence. He denounced the military service argument as well, calling it a &quot;cliche&quot;. Considering the ages of soldiers in the Civil War, he asserted that literacy and education were not the grounds for limiting voting; rather, common sense and the capacity to understand the political system grounded voting-age restrictions.

James J. Kilpatrick, a political columnist, asserted that the states were &quot;extorted&quot; into ratifying the Twenty-sixth Amendment. In his article, he claims that, by passing the 1970 extension to the Voting Rights Act, Congress effectively forced the States to ratify the amendment lest they be forced to financially and bureaucratically cope with maintaining two voting registers. George Gallup also mentions the cost of registration in his article showing percentages favoring or opposing the amendment, and he draws particular attention to the lower rates of support among adults aged 30–49 and over 50 (57% and 52% respectively) as opposed to those aged 18–20 and 21–29 (84% and 73% respectively).

==Proposal and ratification==
===Passage by Congress===

Senator Birch Bayh&#x27;s subcommittee on constitutional amendments began hearings on extending voting rights to 18-year-olds in 1968.

After &quot;Oregon v. Mitchell&quot;, Bayh surveyed election officials in 47 states and found that registering an estimated 10million young people in a separate system for federal elections would cost approximately $20million. Bayh concluded that most states could not change their state constitutions in time for the 1972 election, mandating national action to avoid &quot;chaos and confusion&quot; at the polls.

On March 2, 1971, Bayh&#x27;s subcommittee and the House Judiciary Committee approved the proposed constitutional amendment to lower the voting age to 18 for all elections.

On March 10, 1971, the Senate voted 94–0 in favor of proposing a constitutional amendment to guarantee the minimum voting age could not be higher than 18. On March 23, 1971, the House of Representatives voted 401–19 in favor of the proposed amendment.



===Ratification by the states===
Having been passed by the 92nd United States Congress, the proposed Twenty-sixth Amendment was sent to the state legislatures for their consideration. Which state was the first to officially ratify the amendment was a matter of dispute: the Minnesota legislature approved the amendment at 3:14 p.m. CST (4:14 p.m. EST), minutes before U.S. Senate president pro tempore Allen J. Ellender officially approved the federal law at approximately 4:35 or 4:40 pm. EST. Legislators in Delaware, which ratified the amendment at 4:51 pm, argued that Minnesota&#x27;s ratification was invalid because the amendment had not yet been sent to the states. The U.S. Senate parliamentarian ruled that Minnesota acted prematurely, but the legality of its ratification of the amendment was never officially challenged.

Ratification was completed on June 30, 1971, after the amendment had been ratified by thirty-eight states. Which state was the 38th to ratify and thus put the amendment into effect has also been disputed. Contemporaneous reports agree that Ohio&#x27;s House of Representatives cast the decisive vote on the evening of June 30, and that Alabama and North Carolina had ratified the amendment earlier in the day. As of 2013, however, the Government Printing Office states that North Carolina did not complete its ratification of the amendment until July 1, at which time it became the 38th state to ratify. Additionally, Alabama governor George Wallace claimed that his state was the 38th to ratify, because he did not sign the ratification resolution until after North Carolina and Ohio completed their ratifications; however, the approval of the governor is not required to ratify an amendment.

Having been ratified by three-fourths of the States (38), the Twenty-sixth Amendment became part of the Constitution. On July 5, 1971, the Administrator of General Services, Robert Kunzig, certified its adoption. President Nixon and Julianne Jones, Joseph W. Loyd Jr., and Paul S. Larimer of the &quot;Young Americans in Concert&quot; also signed the certificate as witnesses. During the signing ceremony, held in the East Room of the White House, Nixon talked about his confidence in the youth of America:

The amendment was subsequently ratified by 5 more states, bringing the total number of ratifying states to 43:

: 39. Oklahoma: July 1, 1971
: 40. Virginia: July 8, 1971
: 41. Wyoming: July 8, 1971
: 42. Georgia: October 4, 1971
: 43. South Dakota: March 4, 2014

No action has been taken on the amendment by the states of Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, or Utah.

<text>The Twenty-seventh Amendment (Amendment XXVII, also known as the Congressional Compensation Act of 1789) to the United States Constitution states that any law that increases or decreases the salary of members of Congress may take effect only after the next election of the House of Representatives has occurred. It is the most recently adopted amendment but was one of the first proposed.

The 1st Congress submitted the amendment to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789, along with 11 other proposed amendments (&quot;Articles I–XII&quot;). The last ten Articles were ratified in 1791 to become the Bill of Rights, but the first two, the Twenty-seventh Amendment and the proposed Congressional Apportionment Amendment, were not ratified by enough states to come into force with them.

The proposed congressional pay amendment was largely forgotten until 1982, when Gregory Watson, a 19-year-old student at the University of Texas at Austin, wrote a paper for a government class in which he claimed that the amendment could still be ratified. He later launched a nationwide campaign to complete its ratification. The amendment eventually became part of the United States Constitution, effective May 5, 1992, completing a record-setting ratification period of 202 years, 7 months, and 10 days, beating the previous record set by the Twenty-second Amendment of 3 years and 343 days.

The idea behind this amendment is to reduce corruption in the legislative branch by requiring an election before a congressperson&#x27;s salary increase takes effect. The public can thus remove members of Congress from office before their salaries increase. It is unclear whether the amendment produced any change in congressional behavior.

== Text ==


== Historical background ==

Several states raised the issue of Congressional salaries as they debated whether to ratify the Constitution.

North Carolina&#x27;s ratifying convention proposed several amendments to the Constitution, including the following: &quot;The laws ascertaining the compensation of senators and representatives, for their services, shall be postponed in their operation until after the election of representatives immediately succeeding the passing thereof; that excepted which shall first be passed on the subject.&quot; Virginia&#x27;s ratifying convention recommended an identical amendment.

New York&#x27;s declaration of ratification was accompanied by a similar amendment proposal: &quot;That the Compensation for the Senators and Representatives be ascertained by standing law; and that no alteration of the existing rate of Compensation shall operate for the Benefit of the Representatives, until after a subsequent Election shall have been had.&quot;

=== Proposal by Congress ===

This amendment was one of several proposed amendments to the Constitution that Representative James Madison of Virginia introduced in the House of Representatives on June 8, 1789. Madison&#x27;s original intent was that it be added to the end of Article I, Section 6, Clause 1 of the Constitution (&quot;The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States&quot;). This and Madison&#x27;s other proposals were referred to a committee consisting of one representative from each state. After emerging from committee, the full House debated the issue and, on August 24, 1789, passed it and 16 other articles of amendment. Next, the proposals went to the Senate, which made 26 substantive alterations. On September 9, 1789, the Senate approved a culled and consolidated package of 12 articles of amendment.

On September 21, 1789, a House–Senate conference committee convened to resolve numerous differences between the House and Senate Bill of Rights proposals. On September 24, 1789, the committee issued its report, which finalized 12 proposed amendments for the House and Senate to consider. The House agreed to the conference report that day, and the Senate concurred the next day.

What would become the Twenty-seventh Amendment was listed second among the 12 proposals sent on September 25, 1789, to the states for their consideration. Ten of these, numbers 3–12, were ratified 27 months later and are known as the Bill of Rights. The remaining proposal, the Congressional Apportionment Amendment, has not been ratified by enough states to become part of the Constitution.

The article on Congressional compensation was initially ratified by seven states through 1792 (including Kentucky), but was not ratified by another state for eighty years. The Ohio General Assembly ratified it on May 6, 1873, in protest of an unpopular Congressional pay raise. A century later, on March 6, 1978, the Wyoming Legislature also ratified the article.

=== Revival of interest ===

This proposed amendment was largely forgotten until Gregory Watson, an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, wrote a paper on the subject in 1982 for a political science course. In the paper, Watson argued that the amendment was still &quot;live&quot; and could be ratified. Watson received a &quot;C&quot; grade for his paper from one of the course&#x27;s teaching assistants. Watson appealed the grade to the course instructor, Sharon Waite, who declined to overrule the teaching assistant. Waite has said, &quot;I kind of glanced at it, but I didn&#x27;t see anything that was particularly outstanding about it and I thought the C was probably fine&quot;. Watson responded by starting a new push for ratification with a letter-writing campaign to state legislatures.

In &quot;Dillon v. Gloss&quot;, the Supreme Court remarked that &quot;ratification [of a proposed constitutional amendment] must be within some reasonable time after the proposal&quot;, and suggested that it was &quot;quite untenable&quot; to view proposed amendments from 1789, 1810, and 1861 as still pending.

But in &quot;Coleman v. Miller&quot;, the court ruled that the validity of state ratifications of a constitutional amendment is a political matter, and thus not properly assigned to the judiciary. It also held that for a political question, it was up to Congress to determine whether an amendment with no time limit for ratification is still viable after a long time based on &quot;the political, social and economic conditions which have prevailed during the period since the submission of the amendment&quot;.

Watson used $6,000 of his own money to sponsor his nationwide effort. When Watson began his campaign in early 1982, he was aware of ratification by only six states and erroneously believed that Virginia&#x27;s 1791 approval was the last action a state had taken. He discovered in 1983 that Ohio had approved the amendment in 1873 as a means of protest against the Salary Grab Act and learned in 1984 that Wyoming had done the same in 1978, as a protest against a 1977 congressional pay raise. Watson also did not know until 1997, well after the amendment&#x27;s adoption, that Kentucky had ratified the amendment in 1792. Neither did Kentucky lawmakers themselvesin Watson&#x27;s desire for a 50-state sweep, the Kentucky General Assembly post-ratified the amendment in 1996 (Senate Joint Resolution No. 50), at Watson&#x27;s request, likewise unaware that the task had already been attended to 204 years earlier.

In April 1983, Maine became the first state to ratify the amendment as a result of Watson&#x27;s campaign, followed by Colorado in April 1984. Numerous state legislatures followed suit, with some reaffirming the amendment despite having affirmed it centuries ago. Michigan and New Jersey rushed to be the 38th state to ratify the amendment, but Michigan was faster, ratifying the amendment on May 7, 1992, resulting in the certification of the amendment. New Jersey ratified the amendment regardless, overturning its rejection of the amendment centuries earlier.

In 2016, Zach Elkins, a professor in the University of Texas at Austin Department of Government, became interested in Watson&#x27;s story and began to document its origins. He tracked down Sharon Waite, who had left academia in the 1980s to work on her family&#x27;s citrus farm. Elkins suggested to Waite that they change Watson&#x27;s grade. In 2017, Elkins submitted a grade change form with Waite&#x27;s signature and a grade change to A+. In an interview, Waite said, &quot;Goodness, he certainly proved he knew how to work the Constitution and what it meant and how to be politically active, [...] So, yes, I think he deserves an A after that effortA-plus!&quot; A+ is not a valid grade at UT, so Watson&#x27;s grade may have been changed to an A, though Elkins urged the registrar to leave it as the only A+ ever recorded at the University of Texas. In the same year, the Texas Legislature passed a congratulatory resolution in response to Watson&#x27;s successful grade change and his overall political participation.

On May 18, 1992, the Archivist of the United States, Don W. Wilson, certified that the amendment&#x27;s ratification had been completed. Michigan&#x27;s May 7, 1992, ratification was believed to be the 38th state, but it later came to light that the Kentucky General Assembly had ratified the amendment during that state&#x27;s initial month of statehood, making Alabama (which acted after Missouri on May 5, 1992) the state to finalize the amendment&#x27;s addition to the Constitution.

The amendment was subsequently ratified by:

# &lt;li value=40&gt; New Jersey – May 7, 1992 (After rejection on November 20, 1789)
# Illinois – May 12, 1992
# California – June 26, 1992
# Rhode Island – June 10, 1993 (After rejection on June 7, 1790)
# Hawaii – April 29, 1994
# Washington – April 6, 1995
# Nebraska – April 1, 2016

Four states have not ratified the Twenty-seventh Amendment: Massachusetts, Mississippi, New York, and Pennsylvania.

=== Affirmation of ratification ===
On May 19, 1992, the Twenty-seventh Amendment&#x27;s certificate of ratification, signed by the Archivist of the United States, Don W. Wilson, on May 18, 1992, was printed and published in the &quot;Federal Register&quot;.

In certifying that the amendment had been duly ratified, the Archivist of the United States had acted under statutory authority granted to his office by the Congress under , which states:

The response in Congress was sharp. Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia scolded Wilson for certifying the amendment without congressional approval. Although Byrd supported congressional acceptance of the amendment, he contended that Wilson had deviated from &quot;historic tradition&quot; by not waiting for Congress to consider the ratification&#x27;s validity, given the extremely long time since the amendment had been proposed. Speaker of the House Tom Foley and others called for a legal challenge to the ratification.

On May 20, 1992, under the authority recognized in &quot;Coleman&quot;, and in keeping with the precedent established by the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, each house of the 102nd Congress passed its own version of a concurrent resolution agreeing that the amendment was validly ratified, despite the more than 202 years the task took. The Senate&#x27;s approval of the resolution was unanimous (99 to 0) and the House vote was 414 to 3.

== Legal issues ==

=== Cost-of-living adjustments ===

Congressional cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) have been upheld against legal challenges based on this amendment. In &quot;Boehner v. Anderson&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the first COLA was in accord with the amendment because it took effect after the election that followed its vote. The court declined to rule on the constitutionality of COLAs in general. In &quot;Schaffer v. Clinton&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled (explicitly disagreeing with &quot;Boehner&quot;) that receiving such a COLA does not grant members of the Congress standing in federal court to challenge it; the Supreme Court did not hear either case, and so has never ruled on this amendment&#x27;s effect on COLAs.

=== No Budget, No Pay Act ===
The No Budget, No Pay Act was proposed in 2012 and again in 2013 to prevent lawmakers from being paid during a government shutdown. The bill received limited bipartisan support, but concerns were raised that it violated the twenty-seventh amendment saying that Congress may not &quot;vary&quot; the compensation of its members until the next election. The bill did not pass and the Supreme Court has not addressed its constitutionality.

<text>A click-to-donate site is a website where users can click a button to generate a donation for a charity without spending any of their own money. The money for the donation comes from advertisers whose banners are displayed each time a user clicks the button. While not directly contributing (though many sites offer additional ways of support), visitors are making a difference in the sense that, had they not visited, no donation would have been given.

In most cases, the donation generated by each user only amounts to a few cents, but the goal is to accumulate enough clicks to add up to a significant amount.

Many charities launched this style of program in the late 1990s. However, the constriction of online advertising spending around 2001 following the dot-com collapse caused many sites to be closed. Yet there are still many in operation, notably Freerice, The Hunger Site, and Por Los Chicos.

Flattr and CentUp (now defunct) used click-to-donate technology on many sites instead of being centralized on just one.

<text>Platanaceae, the plane family, is a family of flowering plants in the order Proteales. The family consists of only a single extant genus &quot;Platanus&quot;, with twelve known species. The plants are tall trees, native to temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The hybrid London plane is widely planted in cities worldwide.

== Description ==

== Ecology ==
Pollination is anemophilous; flowering begins at the start of spring when the new leaves are sprouting. The heads that sustain the fruit normally shed the year after they have matured, during the autumn. Dispersion of the individual fruiting bodies, with their thistledown, is anemochorous (they are sometimes dispersed by water as a secondary mechanism).

The plants grow in cool situations in temperate climates and are frequently found on the banks of rivers and streams. They are totally absent from dry or excessively cold areas.

== Phytochemistry ==
They contain cyanogenic glycosides derived from tyrosine, flavonoids belonging to the proanthocyanidins group (e.g. prodelphinidin) and flavonols (kaempferol, quercetin, myricetin), in addition to triterpenols (including betulinic acid). They lack ellagic acid, saponins, and sapogenins.

== Cultivation ==

The main use for a number of the species is to provide shade in pedestrian areas in temperate regions, particularly the London plane (&quot;Platanus × hispanica&quot;), which is widely distributed throughout Europe and North America. It is highly resistant, probably due to so-called hybrid vigour, although its use requires caution due to their allergy-producing thistledown. The parent species are also grown for the same effect, but with poorer results as they are less resistant to contamination, among other reasons. The wood is used in cabinetmaking, paneling, and other interior work, and is also prized for its long burn time.

== Fossils ==
A large number of fossils of this family have been recorded from the Lower Cretaceous (98-113 million years ago, &quot;Platanocarpus&quot;). The examples from that time had very small pollen (8-10 μm) and a developed perianth and they lacked hairs at the base of the nucule. It is thought to have had entomophilous pollination. During the mid Cretaceous, the fossilized forms with platanoid leaves became mixed with pinnate leaves (&quot;Sapindopsis&quot;) or pedatisect leaves (&quot;Debeya&quot;, &quot;Dewalquea&quot;), and these forms lasted until the Eocene. The leaves with typical stipules belonging to the sub-genus &quot;Platanus&quot; are very common in Palaeocene formations (60 M years ago). It is thought that the only modern genus, &quot;Platanus&quot;, is a relict that can be considered a living fossil. It must have been polyploid during its evolution judging by the size of its stomata.

== Systematic position ==
The APG II system (2003) allows the option of including it in the family Proteaceae, or treating it as distinct as a segregate family. In as far as APG II accepts the family, it is placed in the order Proteales, in the clade eudicots. This represents a slight change from the APG system of 1998, which did accept this family. The Cronquist system of 1981 recognized the family and placed it in order Hamamelidales, in subclass Hamamelidae in class Magnoliopsida (dicotyledons). The Dahlgren system and Thorne system (1992) also recognized this family and placed it in the order Hamamelidales in superorder Rosanae in subclass Magnoliidae &quot;sensu&quot; Dahlgren and Thorne (dicotyledons). The Engler system, in its 1964 update, also recognized the family and placed it in the order Rosales in subclass Archichlamydeae of class Dicotyledoneae. The Wettstein system, last revised in 1935, also recognized the family and placed it in the order Hamamelidales in the Monochlamydeae in subclass Choripetalae of the class Dicotyledones. Based on molecular and morphological data the APW (Angiosperm Phylogeny Website) places the family in the order Proteales as a sister family to the Proteaceae, making them the Northern Hemisphere version of this family (cf. AP-website).

== Taxa included ==
:&quot;Theoretical introduction to Taxonomy&quot;

The only extant genus, &quot;Platanus&quot; L., 1753, has the type species &quot;Platanus orientalis&quot; L., 1753. It is divided into two subgenera: the subgenus &quot;Castaneophyllum&quot; J.-F. Leroy, 1982, with elliptical, penninerved leaves with small scarious, stipules, that only includes &quot;Platanus kerrii&quot; Gagnep., 1939, an isolated relict species that represents the genus’ evolutionary basal branch and which is the sister group of the other species, which comprise the subgenus &quot;Platanus&quot;.

== Hybrids ==

The London plane or hybrid plane has long been considered a hybrid derived from the cross between &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; and &quot;P. orientalis&quot;, despite this its origin is not clear. Some experts think it originated in London and others in Spain or even in natural or cultivated hybrid form (or not) in Turkey. The question has not been investigated with modern molecular methods. As a consequence, even its nomenclature is hotly debated, to the extent that until recently, some anglophone authors denied the priority of the name used by Otto von Münchhausen (following Maria da Luz de Oliveira Tavares Monteiro da Rocha Afonso, 1990, see References). The plant is not found in the wild, though it appears in a naturalised form along the banks of rivers and streams.

Hybrid &quot;Platanus × hispanica&quot; (= &quot;P. orientalis&quot; var. &quot;acerifolia&quot; ; &quot;P. hybrida&quot; ; &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; ; &quot;P. × acerifolia&quot;.

Other names proposed for hybrids that are probably synonymous with the above, which is the only name in English, and which represent smaller minorities are:
* Hybrid &quot;Platanus&quot; × &quot;cantabrigensis&quot; 
* Hybrid &quot;Platanus&quot; × &quot;parviloba&quot; 

The references consulted do not agree as to whether the fruit is a nucule or achene, the difference between the two ultimately depends on the size of the pericarp and the extent of its lignification. The fruit is dry, indehiscent, monocarpelar and monospermatic.

<text>Cypriniformes is an order of ray-finned fish, which includes many families and genera of cyprinid (carps and their kin) fish, such as barbs, gobies, loaches, botias, and minnows (among others). Cypriniformes is an &quot;order-within-an-order&quot;, placed under the superorder [[Ostariophysi]]—which is also made up of cyprinid, ostariophysin fishes. The order contains 11–12 families (with some authorities having listed as many as 23), over 400 genera, and more than 4,250 named species; new species are regularly described, and new genera are recognized frequently. Cyprinids are most diverse in South and Southeast Asia and are entirely absent from Australia and South America. At 112 years old, the longest-lived cypriniform fish documented is the bigmouth buffalo.

Their closest living relatives are the Characiformes (characins, tetras and their kin), the Gymnotiformes (electric eel and American knifefishes), and the Siluriformes (catfishes).

==Description==

Like other orders of the Ostariophysi, fishes of Cypriniformes possess a Weberian apparatus. They differ from most of their relatives in having only a dorsal fin on their backs; most other fishes of Ostariophysi have a small, fleshy adipose fin behind the dorsal fin. Other differences are the Cypriniformes&#x27; unique kinethmoid, a small median bone in the snout, and the lack of teeth in the mouth. Instead, they have convergent structures called pharyngeal teeth in the throat. While other groups of fish, such as cichlids, also possess pharyngeal teeth, the cypriniformes&#x27; teeth grind against a chewing pad on the base of the skull, rather than an upper pharyngeal jaw.
The most notable family placed here is the Cyprinidae (carps and minnows), which make up two-thirds of the order&#x27;s diversity. This is one of the largest families of fish, and is widely distributed across Africa, Eurasia, and North America. Most species are strictly freshwater inhabitants, but some are found in brackish water, such as roach and bream. At least one species is found in saltwater, the Pacific redfin, &quot;Tribolodon brandtii&quot;. Brackish water and marine cyprinids are invariably anadromous, swimming upstream into rivers to spawn. Sometimes separated as family Psilorhynchidae, they seem to be specially adapted fishes of the Cyprinidae.

The Balitoridae and Gyrinocheilidae are families of mountain-stream fishes feeding on algae and small invertebrates. They are found only in tropical and subtropical Asia. While the former are a speciose group, the latter contain only a handful of species. The suckers (Catostomidae) are found in temperate North America and eastern Asia. These large fishes are similar to carps in appearance and ecology. Members of the Cobitidae are common across Eurasia and parts of North Africa. A midsized group like the suckers, they are rather similar to catfish in appearance and behaviour, feeding primarily off the substrate and equipped with barbels to help them locate food at night or in murky conditions. Fishes in the families Cobitidae, Balitoridae, Botiidae, and Gyrinocheilidae are called loaches, although the last do not seem to belong to the lineage of &quot;true&quot; loaches, but are related to the suckers.

== Systematics ==

Historically, these included all the forms now placed in the superorder Ostariophysi except the catfish, which were placed in the order Siluriformes. By this definition, the Cypriniformes were paraphyletic, so recently, the orders Gonorhynchiformes, Characiformes, (characins and allies), and Gymnotiformes (knifefishes and electric eels) have been separated out to form their own monophyletic orders.

The families of Cypriniformes are traditionally divided into two suborders. Superfamily Cyprinioidea contains the carps and minnows (Cyprinidae) and also the mountain carps as the family Psilorhynchidae. In 2012, Maurice Kottelat reviewed the superfamily Cobitoidei and under his revision it now consists of the following families: hillstream loaches (Balitoridae), Barbuccidae, Botiidae, suckers (Catostomidae), true loaches (Cobitidae), Ellopostomatidae, Gastromyzontidae, sucking loaches (Gyrinocheilidae), stone loaches (Nemacheilidae), Serpenticobitidae, and long-finned loaches (Vaillantellidae).

Catostomoidea is usually treated as a junior synonym of the Cobitoidei, but it could be split off the Catostomidae and Gyrinocheilidae in a distinct superfamily; the Catostomoidea might be closer relatives of the carps and minnows than of the &quot;true&quot; loaches. While the Cyprinioidea seem more &quot;primitive&quot; than the loach-like forms, they were apparently successful enough never to shift from the original ecological niche of the basal Ostariophysi. Yet, from the ecomorphologically conservative main lineage apparently at least two major radiations branched off. These diversified from the lowlands into torrential river habitats, acquiring similar habitus and adaptations in the process.

The mountain carps are the highly apomorphic Cyprinidae, perhaps close to true carps (Cyprininae), or maybe to the danionins. While some details about the phylogenetic structures of this massively diverse family are known – e.g. that Cultrinae and Leuciscinae are rather close relatives and stand apart from Cyprininae – no good consensus exists yet on how the main lineages are interrelated. A systematic list, from the most ancient to the most modern lineages, can thus be given as:
* Family †Jianghanichthyidae (Paleocene to Eocene of China)
* Suborder Gyrinocheiloidei 
** Family Gyrinocheilidae (algae eaters)
* Suborder Catostomoidei 
** Family Catostomidae (suckers)
* Suborder Cobitoidei 
** Family Botiidae , 1940 (pointface loaches)
** Family Vaillantellidae (longfin loaches)
** Family Cobitidae (spined loaches)
** Family Barbuccidae (scooter loaches)
** Family Gastromyzontidae (hillstream loaches)
** Family Serpenticobitidae (snake loaches)
** Family Balitoridae (river loaches)

===Phylogeny===
Phylogeny based on the work of the following works

===Evolution===
Cypriniformes include the most primitive of the Ostariophysi in the narrow sense (i.e. excluding the Gonorynchiformes). This is evidenced not only by physiological details, but also by their great distribution, which indicates they had the longest time to spread. The earliest that Cypriniformes might have diverged from Characiphysi (Characiformes and relatives) is thought to be about the Early Triassic, about 250 million years ago (mya). However, their divergence probably occurred only with the splitting-up of Pangaea in the Jurassic, maybe 160 million years ago (Mya). By 110 Mya, the plate tectonics evidence indicates that the Laurasian Cypriniformes must have been distinct from their Gondwanan relatives.

The Cypriniformes are thought to have originated in South-east Asia, where the most diversity of this group is found today. The alternative hypothesis is that they began in South America, similar to the other otophysans. If this were the case, they would have spread to Asia through Africa or North America before the continents split up, for these are purely freshwater fishes. As the Characiformes began to diversify and spread, they may have outcompeted South American basal cypriniforms in Africa, where more advanced cypriniforms survive and coexist with characiforms.

The earliest cypriniform fossils are already assignable to the living family Catostomidae; from the Paleocene of Alberta, they are roughly 60 million years old. During the Eocene (55–35 Mya), catostomids and cyprinids spread throughout Asia; the earliest members of the cyprinid subfamilies Barbinae and Danioninae are known from the Eocene Sangkarewang Formation of Indonesia, in addition to possibly Smilogastrinae and Labeoninae. The extinct family Jianghanichthyidae is known from the Eocene of China. In the Oligocene, around 30 Mya, advanced cyprinids began to outcompete catostomids wherever they were sympatric, causing a decline of the suckers. Cyprinids reached North America and Europe about the same time, and Africa in the early Miocene (some 23–20 Mya). The cypriniforms spread to North America through the Bering land bridge, which formed and disappeared again several times during the many millions of years of cypriniform evolution.

==Relationship with humans==
The Cyprinidae in particular are important in a variety of ways. Many species are important food fish, particularly in Europe and Asia. Some are also important as aquarium fish, of which the goldfish and koi are perhaps the most celebrated. The other families are of less commercial importance. The Catostomidae have some importance in angling, and some &quot;loaches&quot; are bred for the international aquarium fish trade.

Accidentally or deliberately introduced populations of common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;) and grass carp (&quot;Ctenopharyngodon idella&quot;) are found on all continents except Antarctica. In some cases, these exotic species have a negative impact on the environment. Carp in particular stir up the riverbed, reducing the clarity of the water, making plant growth difficult.

In science, one of the most famous members of the Cypriniformes is the zebrafish (&quot;Danio rerio&quot;). The zebrafish is one of the most important vertebrate model organisms in biological and biochemical sciences, being used in many kinds of experiments. During early development, the zebrafish has a nearly transparent body, so it is ideal for studying developmental biology. It is also used for the elucidation of biochemical signaling pathways. They are also good pets, but can be shy in bright light and crowded tanks.

===Threats and extinction===

Habitat destruction, damming of upland rivers, pollution, and in some cases overfishing for food or the pet trade have driven some Cypriniformes to the brink of extinction or even beyond. In particular, Cyprinidae of southwestern North America have been severely affected; a considerable number went entirely extinct after settlement by Europeans. For example, in 1900 the thicktail chub (&quot;Gila crassicauda&quot;) was the most common freshwater fish found in California; 70 years later, not a single living individual existed.
The well-known red-tailed black shark (&quot;Epalzeorhynchos bicolor&quot;) from the Mae Klong River of &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; fame possibly only survives in captivity. Ironically, while pollution and other forms of overuse by humans have driven it from its native home, it is bred for the aquarium fish trade by the thousands. The Yarqon bleak (&quot;Acanthobrama telavivensis&quot;) from the Yarqon River had to be rescued into captivity from imminent extinction; new populations have apparently been established again successfully from captive stock. The Balitoridae and Cobitidae, meanwhile, contain a very large number of species about which essentially nothing is known except how they look and where they were first found.

Globally extinct Cypriniformes species are:
* &quot;Acanthobrama hulensis&quot;
* Gökçe balığı, &quot;Alburnus akili&quot;

* Endorheic chub, &quot;Evarra tlahuacensis&quot;
* Thicktail chub, &quot;Gila crassicauda&quot;
* Pahranagat spinedace, &quot;Lepidomeda altivelis&quot;
* Harelip sucker, &quot;Moxostoma lacerum&quot;
* Durango shiner, &quot;Notropis aulidion&quot;
* Phantom shiner, &quot;Notropis orca&quot;
* Salado shiner, &quot;Notropis saladonis&quot;

<doc id="70145" wikidata="Q6001772" url="?curid=70145" title="ImClone Systems">
<text>ImClone Systems LLC was a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing biologic medicines in the area of oncology. It was founded in 1984 and had its corporate headquarters in Bridgewater, New Jersey, and its research headquarters in New York City. On October 6, 2008, it accepted a $6.5 billion acquisition offer from Eli Lilly and Company, and became a fully-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company on November 24, 2008. Prior to the acquisition, it was traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol IMCL. Imclone lost its separate identity in 2014 when its former ImClone research and manufacturing sites were renamed as &quot;Eli Lilly and Company&quot;.

==Insider trading scandal==
ImClone&#x27;s stock price dropped sharply at the end of 2001 when its drug Erbitux, an experimental monoclonal antibody, failed to get the expected Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. It was later revealed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that numerous executives sold their stock before the announcement of the decision after the close of trading on December 28.

Its founder, Samuel D. Waksal, was arrested in 2002 on insider trading charges for informing friends and family to sell their stock, and attempting to sell his own. His daughter, Aliza Waksal, sold $2.5 million in shares on December 27. His father, Jack Waksal, sold $8.1 million in shares over the 27th and 28th. Company executives had done the same. John B. Landes, the general counsel, sold $2.5 million in shares on December 6. Ronald A. Martell, the vice president for marketing and sales, sold $2.1 million in shares on December 11. Four other executives sold shares in the following weeks as well. Later, Samuel Waksal pleaded guilty to various charges, including securities fraud, and on June 10, 2003, was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.

Martha Stewart, the founder of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (Waksal had dated Stewart&#x27;s daughter) also became embroiled in the scandal after it emerged that she sold about $230,000 in ImClone shares on December 27, just a day before the announcement of FDA decision. Although Stewart maintained her innocence, she was found guilty and sentenced on July 16, 2004, to five months in prison, five months of home confinement, and two years probation for lying about a stock sale, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice.

Ultimately a new clinical trial and FDA filing prepared by Imclone&#x27;s partner Merck KGaA (&quot;German Merck,&quot; not to be confused with the US company of similar name) resulted in an FDA approval of Erbitux in 2004 for use in colon cancer.

A Congressional hearing on improprieties at ImClone, held in October 2002, unveiled a culture of corruption dating back to 1986. This was the year that ImClone CEO Waksal first forged the signature of the company&#x27;s general counsel John Landes (one of the three original employees of the company) for financial gain. Nonetheless, Landes defended Waksal&#x27;s illegal actions at the hearings before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, portraying the forgery as &quot;a good-faith misunderstanding,&quot; to which Representative James Greenwood replied &quot;My children know better than that, Mr. Landes.&quot; Further questioning about this and subsequent forgeries on Waksal&#x27;s part revealed that neither Landes, the chief legal officer of the company, nor the company&#x27;s outside directors reported Waksal&#x27;s actions to proper authorities or made any moves to have Waksal removed as CEO. Instead, testimony revealed that they initiated their own internal investigation, which was never concluded. The decades-long tolerance for Waksal&#x27;s fraud, starting from the company&#x27;s earliest days, provoked Representative Peter Deutsch to refer to the ongoing misconduct as &quot;wacky.&quot;

The FDA&#x27;s February 2004 announcement of approval for use of Erbitux for treatment of colorectal cancer reported that conclusions were drawn from a trial involving 329 patients, of which 10.8% responded when Erbitux was used by itself, delaying tumor growth by 1.5 months. When used in conjunction with a standard chemotherapy treatment, irinotecan, 22.9% of patients responded and tumor growth was delayed by approximately 4.1 months.

In September 2001, Bristol-Myers Squibb committed $2 billion (including a $1 billion up-front cash payment) for less than 20% of ImClone due to what was called at the time the drug&#x27;s &quot;blockbuster&quot; potential.

In January 2006, the company was put up for sale but failed to find any buyers, likely due to the fact that Erbitux by that time faced significant competition in the medical marketplace. ImClone directors withdrew the sale of the company in mid-2006.

In April 2007, The Wall Street Journal reported that &quot;Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and ImClone Systems Inc. said their cancer drug, Erbitux, failed to significantly prolong the lives of people with pancreatic cancer in a new study, marking yet another setback in the drug industry&#x27;s efforts to find a better treatment for this deadly disease.&quot;

==Compassionate use controversy==
The FDA approved the aforementioned colorectal cancer drug, Erbitux, on February 12, 2004. In May 2001, while ImClone was still seeking approval for the drug (then known as IMC-C225), the CBS news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; aired a story about two cancer patients&#x27; struggles to obtain &quot;compassionate use&quot; of the drug. One ultimately succeeded; the other failed despite repeated pleas to ImClone officials. It was alleged in the story that ImClone was arbitrary in who received the drug and had no written criteria for compassionate use.

==Carl Icahn acquisition==
On October 25, 2006, a group led by billionaire investor Carl Icahn acquired a majority of stock thereby giving him control of the board. Within hours of the announcement, interim CEO Joseph Fischer resigned, and Icahn announced that other members of the Board of Directors would not be re-elected.

==Yeda/Aventis/Imclone patent dispute==
Yeda Research and Development, a company set up to commercialize and market the products of research at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, challenged the Aventis-owned patent, licensed by Imclone, for the use of anti-Epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies in combination with chemotherapy, to slow the growth of certain tumors. This is the so-called &#x27;866&#x27; patent, which was filed in 1989 by Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer, issued in 2001, and on which Joseph Schlessinger was listed as first-named inventor.

Joseph Schlessinger&#x27;s former colleagues at the Weizmann Institute, in particular Michael Sela, claimed to have come up with this concept alongside Schlessinger when they worked together there years earlier, and Yeda challenged the Aventis patent in the United States. Schlessinger testified in court that the idea of combining the anti-EGFR antibody that his lab had developed with chemotherapy in cancer treatment was his own idea. However, the Weizmann Institute scientists provided extensive documentation that they had been developing this idea using an antibody against EGFR that Schlessinger&#x27;s laboratory had developed and generated, and that he had given them for these studies. Schlessinger claims to have initiated the idea of this use in combination therapy, but had not documented his research and ideas as thoroughly, leaving him forced to rely on his recollections of the events that led to the patent filing some 17 years before Yeda mounted their challenge.

The court ruled that Yeda are the sole owners of the disputed patent in the U.S., while Yeda and Sanofi-Aventis co-own the 866 Patent&#x27;s foreign counterparts. Following the ruling, ImClone and Sanofi-Aventis agreed to settle the dispute with Yeda, for $120 million, with each company paying Yeda $60 million. In return, ImClone were also granted a worldwide license to technology covered by the 866 Patent, and agreed to pay a small royalty on Erbitux sales to Yeda.

==Takeover offer from Bristol-Myers Squibb, and subsequent bidding showdown==
On July 31, 2008, Bristol-Myers Squibb offered to take over ImClone for $60 a share cash. The offer was made by letter addressed to ImClone&#x27;s chairman of the board, Carl Icahn.

On September 10, 2008, an undisclosed company and CEO offered to take over ImClone for $70 a share, financing approach was not disclosed. The offer was conditional on the results of a due diligence review of ImClone&#x27;s business and technology by the undisclosed party, to be completed September 28, 2008.

On September 23, 2008, Bristol-Myers Squibb upped its offer to take over ImClone to $62 a share. In addition, Bristol threatened to take the offer to the share holders for a proxy battle with the intention of replacing the current Board of Directors headed by Carl Icahn.

On October 6, 2008, ImClone agreed to be acquired by Eli Lilly for $6.5 billion ($70/share). On November 24, 2008, ImClone was formally acquired by Eli Lilly, with all NASDAQ IMCL shares tendered for $6.5 billion ($70/share). ImClone is now a fully owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company. In 2014 a drug developed by ImClone, tumor angiogenesis inhibitor Cyramza, was approved by the FDA for gastric cancer. Lilly acquired the drug through its purchase of ImClone.

<doc id="70146" wikidata="Q7411220" url="?curid=70146" title="Samuel D. Waksal">
<text>Samuel D. Waksal (born September 8, 1947) is the founder and former CEO of the biopharmaceutical company ImClone Systems. He is also the founder of Kadmon Pharmaceuticals, which was financed with private capital and commenced operations in New York City in 2010. At ImClone, Waksal led the company to develop the cancer drug Erbitux (cetuximab). During the course of its review process with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Waksal became involved in an insider trading scandal revolving around improper communications with personal friends and family members. He was convicted of several securities violations, served time in federal prison, and was released.

==Education and early career==
Waksal was born on September 8, 1947, in Paris, France, to a Jewish family, the son of Holocaust survivors. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1969 and a doctorate in immunobiology in 1974, both from The Ohio State University.

Over the next 15 years, he worked as a medical researcher at Stanford University, the National Cancer Institute, Tufts University and Mount Sinai Hospital, New York. However, he often faced scrutiny for misrepresenting the source of material and fabricating lab results.

==ImClone Systems==
Waksal founded ImClone Systems in 1984. The company was engaged in several research and development projects before filing its first Biologic License Application with the FDA in 2001. When it won the rights to develop Erbitux, a cancer antibody, the drug&#x27;s clinical success caused ImClone&#x27;s stock to reach a high of $70 a share. In September 2001, Bristol-Myers Squibb was intrigued enough by Erbitux to sign a $2 billion deal with the company in return for the marketing rights to the drug. In December 2001, however, the FDA issued a &quot;Refuse to File&quot; decision effectively turning down ImClone&#x27;s application due to concerns about the structure of the clinical trials. In 2004, Erbitux was approved by the FDA. In 2008, the drug generated over $1.5 billion in sales and was credited with aiding thousands of cancer patients. That same year, ImClone was sold to Eli Lilly and Company for $6.5 billion.

==Criminal activity and conviction==

Waksal became aware of the FDA&#x27;s rejection on Christmas Day 2001. Unable to get the FDA to reconsider, ImClone began drafting a press release announcing the Erbitux rejection. This was due to be released at the close of business on December 28. Until then, under federal securities law, Waksal was barred from selling his ImClone stock or telling anyone about the pending rejection. However, public release of the Erbitux rejection would expose Waksal to a number of financial problems beyond the near-certainty of ImClone&#x27;s stock sliding. For example, Waksal had pledged a warrant to buy ImClone shares as collateral for a loan from Bank of America despite having already executed the warrant in 2000. If Bank of America discovered the warrant was no longer valid, Waksal could be charged with bank fraud. He tipped off several of his friends and family to sell their ImClone stock. When Waksal&#x27;s broker at Merrill Lynch, Peter Bacanovic, became aware of the pending rejection, he alerted their mutual friend, Martha Stewart, that ImClone was about to lose a good deal of its value.

Waksal was arrested June 12, 2002 on insider trading charges. On October 15, he pleaded guilty to charges of securities fraud, bank fraud, obstruction of justice, and perjury.

On March 3, 2003, he pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and wire fraud for avoiding $1.2 million in sales taxes on $15 million in artwork. The art included works by Mark Rothko, Richard Serra, Roy Lichtenstein, and Willem de Kooning, purchased between June 2000 and October 2001.

On June 10, 2003, Waksal was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison and ordered to pay more than $4 million in fines and back taxes, all the maximum punishments allowable under law. Waksal wanted to go to Federal Prison Camp, Eglin, but instead he went to Federal Correctional Institution, Schuylkill. He was later transferred to the Federal Correctional Institution, Milan. On February 9, 2009, Waksal, Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) # 53803-054, was released from BOP custody.

==Kadmon Pharmaceuticals==
In 2009, upon his release from prison Waksal began fundraising and launched the company Kadmon Pharmaceuticals in New York City. Waksal was forced to step down from the CEO position in 2014 as the company planned an IPO, because his sentence also ruled that he was banned from serving as an officer or director to any public company for life. With Waksal leaving the role, his brother Harlan began serving as CEO. Waksal remained with the company and transitioned into the role of Chief of Innovation. In February 2016, Waksal left the Kadmon Pharmaceuticals but remained a shareholder in the company. In June 2016, the company announced it had filed the paperwork to undergo an IPO. In July 2016, the company raised $75 million in its IPO.

==Personal life==
Waksal is divorced from Cynthia F. Waksal; they had two children: Aliza and Elana. His daughter, Elana, is married to Jarrett Posner, son of Steven Posner and grandson of Victor Posner. Waksal dated Martha Stewart&#x27;s daughter, Alexis, for several years prior to his criminal conviction. As of 2016 he was reported to hold executive positions with the New York Biotechnology Association and the New York Council for the Humanities, and is also a member of the board of advisors of Rockefeller University.

<doc id="70147" wikidata="Q535583" url="?curid=70147" title="Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland">
<text>Joan Beaufort ( 1377 – 13 November 1440) was the youngest of the four legitimised children and only daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster (third surviving son of King Edward III), by his mistress, later wife, Katherine de Roet. She married Ralph de Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and in her widowhood became a powerful landowner in the north of England.

== Early life ==
The year and place of Joan&#x27;s birth is unknown. She may have been born at Kettlethorpe in Lincolnshire, the seat of the Swynford family, or at Pleshey in Essex, the home of Joan Fitzalan, Countess of Hereford. The usual date given for Joan&#x27;s birth is 1379, as wine was ordered by John of Gaunt to be sent with all speed to Kettlethorpe in that year and he dated a couple of documents at that time from Kettlethorpe; thus, Joan&#x27;s father may have been present for her birth or arrived shortly thereafter. Alison Weir, however, believes 1377 may be more accurate. Joan may have been named after Joan of Kent, at the time of her birth Dowager Princess of Wales. In September 1396 she, together with her siblings, the children of John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford, were legitimised by papal bull.

==Marriages and issue==
=== First marriage ===
In 1386 her father arranged for her to be betrothed to Robert Ferrers, 5th Baron Boteler of Wem (d. c. 1395). The marriage took place in 1391/2 at Beaufort-en-Vallée, Anjou and the couple remained in the household of her father. Ferrers died only three years after the marriage, having had two daughters by Joan:
* Elizabeth Ferrers, 6th Baroness Boteler of Wem (1393–1474). She married John de Greystoke, 4th Baron Greystoke (1389–1436) on 28 October 1407 in Greystoke Castle, Greystoke, Cumberland, and had issue. She is buried at Black Friars Church, York.
* Mary or Margery (1394 – 25 January 1457/1458). She married her stepbrother, Sir Ralph Neville, son of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmoreland, before 1411 in Oversley, Warwickshire and had issue.

=== Second marriage ===
In November 1396 Joan married, secondly, to the recently widowed Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland (d. 1425), who had twelve children by his first wife and fathered a further fourteen by Joan. On the marriage her father settled on the couple for life an annuity of £206 13s 4d. The couple&#x27;s primary residence was the ancient Neville seat of Raby Castle in the county of Durham. Joan Beaufort and Ralph Neville had the following 14 children:
* Lady Katherine Neville (c. 1397 – c. 1483), married, firstly, on 12 January 1411 John Mowbray, 2nd Duke of Norfolk; married, secondly, Sir Thomas Strangways; married, thirdly, John Beaumont, 1st Viscount Beaumont; married, fourthly, Sir John Woodville (d. 12 August 1469).
* Lady Eleanor Neville (c. 1398 – 1472), married, firstly, Richard le Despenser, 4th Baron Burghersh, married, secondly, Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland.
* Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury (1400–1460), married Alice Montacute, &quot;suo jure&quot; 5th Countess of Salisbury. Had issue
* Henry Neville (c. 1402), died in infancy
* Robert Neville (1404–1457), Bishop of Durham
* William Neville, 1st Earl of Kent (c. 1405 – 1463), married Joan Fauconberg
* John Neville (c. 1406), died in infancy
* George Neville, 1st Baron Latimer (c. 1407 – 1469)
* Lady Anne Neville (c. 1408 – 1480), married Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham.
* Thomas Neville (c. 1410), died as a child 
* Cuthbert Neville (c. 1411), died in infancy
* Joan Neville (c. 1412 – 1453), became a nun of the Order of St. Clare
* Edward Neville, 3rd Baron Bergavenny (c. 1414 – 1476), married Elizabeth Beauchamp
* Lady Cecily Neville (1415–1495) (&quot;Proud Cis&quot;), married Richard, 3rd Duke of York, and mothered kings Edward IV and Richard III.
==Life==
In 1399 Joan was made a Lady of the Order of the Garter by King Richard II. Although that king had created Ralph as the first Earl of Westmorland, Ralph sided with Joan&#x27;s half-brother Henry Bolingbroke, who deposed Richard in 1399 and assumed the throne as King Henry IV. Joan and Ralph were granted numerous offices, lands, wardships and pensions under Henry IV. Joan was named in royal grants as &quot;the King&#x27;s sister.&quot;

Ralph and Joan used their relationship with Henry IV to seek out the best marriages for their children, often purchasing the wardships and marriages of children orphaned by aristocratic rebellions. For example, in 1423, Ralph purchased the wardship of Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York who lived with the family at Raby Castle and was accordingly later married to Cecily Neville, one of the daughters of Richard and Joan. J. R. Lander called these machinations &quot;the most amazing series of child marriages in English history.&quot; By the time of her death, Joan was the mother of an earl, three barons, a countess, three duchesses and a bishop.

In about 1413 Joan invited the mystic Margery Kempe to the family home and it is likely that she helped to fund Margery&#x27;s pilgrimage to Jerusalem. In 1422 Joan acquired an indult permitting her to stay with any order of nuns attended by &quot;eight honest women.&quot;

== Later life and death ==
After Ralph&#x27;s death in 1425, the title Earl of Westmorland passed to Ralph&#x27;s eldest grandson from his first marriage but many of the Neville lands were transferred to Joan&#x27;s eldest son Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury. This sparked the Neville–Neville feud between the two lines descended from Ralph, which continued into the Wars of the Roses.

During her widowhood Joan became a patron of literature. In about 1430 Joan and her family were depicted by Pol de Limbourg in the &quot;Neville Book of Hours&quot;. In 1428 Joan undertook a religious pilgrimage and joined the Sisterhood of the Abbey of St. Alban&#x27;s. At some point during her widowhood Joan swore a vow of chastity.

==Death and burial==
Joan died on 13 November 1440 at Howden in Yorkshire and was buried beside her mother in Lincoln Cathedral.

==Descendants==
Joan Beaufort was the mother of Cecily, Duchess of York, and thus was a grandmother of kings Edward IV and Richard III. The latter was defeated in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth by Henry VII who replaced him as king. Henry then married Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV, and their second son later became King Henry VIII. Henry VIII&#x27;s sixth wife, Catherine Parr, was also a descendant of Joan through her eldest son Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, thus Henry&#x27;s third cousin. The 5th Earl of Salisbury was father to Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, &quot;the Kingmaker&quot; (father of queen consort Anne Neville and Isabel Neville, Duchess of Clarence).

<text>Les Automatistes were a group of Québécois artistic dissidents from Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The movement was founded in the early 1940s by painter Paul-Émile Borduas. Les Automatistes were so called because they were influenced by Surrealism and its theory of automatism. Members included Marcel Barbeau, Roger Fauteux, Claude Gauvreau, Jean-Paul Riopelle, Pierre Gauvreau, Fernand Leduc, Jean-Paul Mousseau, Guy Borremans, Marcelle Ferron and Françoise Sullivan.

The movement may have begun with an exhibition Borduas gave in Montreal in 1942. Held at the Ermitage, an exhibition hall owned by the Collège de Montréal, the show featured gouaches that illustrated the artist&#x27;s experimentation with non-figurative painting. Initially, les Automatistes exhibited in makeshift venues, since no commercial gallery was willing to show the work of all the members. However, the group was soon being exhibited in Paris and New York also. Though it began as a visual arts group, it also spread to other forms of expression, such as drama, poetry and dance. The title &quot;les Automatistes&quot; came from journalist Tancrède Marcil Jr., in a review of their second exhibit in Montreal (February 15 to March 1, 1947), which appeared in &quot;Le Quartier Latin&quot; (the Université de Montréal&#x27;s student journal).

In 1948, Borduas published a collective manifesto called the Refus global, an important document in the cultural history of Quebec and a declaration of artistic independence and the need for expressive freedom. The decision to write the manifesto was partly influenced by Jean Paul Riopelle, who had recently signed the Surrealist manifesto &quot;Rupture inaugurale&quot; during a visit to Paris. &quot;Refus global&quot; was published in a first edition of four hundred copies, which went on sale at the Librairie Tranquille in Montreal on August 9, 1948. The manifesto&#x27;s denunciation of the Catholic Church&#x27;s authority was particularly scandalous and resulted in the group&#x27;s public humiliation. This ultimately led to a kind of martyrdom but was initially devastating. Borduas was dismissed from his position at the École du meuble and, unable to find work, left Quebec permanently in 1953. Although the group dispersed soon after the manifesto was published, the movement continues to have influence, and may be considered a forerunner of the Quiet Revolution.

Alongside Lyrical Abstract painters in France, the Automatistes favoured a fluid, painterly technique over the comparatively reserved, hard-edge abstraction so popular in the U.S. and Eastern Europe at the time. Much like a nonobjective Group of Seven, they were looking to create a distinctively Canadian artistic identity. Heavily influenced by Surrealist manifestos and poetry, their work was largely stream-of-consciousness inspired, believing this to be a truer means of communicating subconscious emotions and sensory experiences; they wanted to be liberated from intention, reason, and any kind of structure, in order to communicate a universal human experience without bias. This resulted in increasingly crude or intuitive methods such as applying paint with palette knives and fingers and painting blindfolded, their efforts contradicting their claims of working without intention.

== Media ==

In 1954, the Automatistes were the subject of the NFB/CBC documentary series &quot;On the Spot&quot; in an episode entitled &quot;Artist in Montreal.&quot;

<text>The Human Stain is a novel by Philip Roth, published May 5, 2000. The book is set in Western Massachusetts in the late 1990s. Its narrator is 65-year-old author Nathan Zuckerman, who appears in several earlier Roth novels, including two books that form a loose trilogy with &quot;The Human Stain,&quot; &quot;American Pastoral&quot; (1997) and &quot;I Married a Communist&quot; (1998). Zuckerman acts largely as an observer as the complex story of the protagonist, Coleman Silk, a retired professor of classics, is slowly revealed.

A national bestseller, &quot;The Human Stain&quot; was adapted in 2003 as a film by the same name directed by Robert Benton.

==Synopsis==
Coleman Silk is a former professor and dean of the faculty at Athena College, a fictional institution in the Berkshires of western Massachusetts, where he still lives. The story is narrated by Roth&#x27;s recurring character Nathan Zuckerman, a writer and a neighbor of Silk.

In 1996, two years before the main action of the novel, Silk is accused of racism by two African-American students after he wonders aloud whether the reason they have missed all his classes so far is that they are &quot;&quot;. Though Silk has no idea they are black, they and others at the college see the term as a racial epithet. When the uproar is about to die down, in Silk&#x27;s view, he resigns. Soon afterward, his wife, Iris, dies of a stroke that Silk feels is caused by the stress of defending him. 

In the summer of 1998, just after Iris dies, the 71-year-old Silk approaches Zuckerman and asks him to write a book on the incident. Ranting about it, Silk blames the widespread condemnation of him on, among other things, anti-semitism. Zuckerman is uninterested, but the two begin a brief friendship and Silk tells him his life story. Zuckerman is surprised to learn that Silk is in a relationship with Faunia Farley, a 34-year-old woman who works as a janitor at the college and who everyone including Silk believes (falsely, as it turns out) is illiterate.

Zuckerman&#x27;s version of the story starts when Coleman Silk is a light-skinned black boy in East Orange, New Jersey. Coleman becomes a straight-A student and, in defiance of his father, a quick and clever boxer. A boxing coach suggests that he pass as a Jew. During World War II he drops out of Howard University and joins the Navy, listing his race as white.

After the war he studies at New York University and lives in Greenwich Village. When he introduces a white girlfriend to his family and they realize he is &quot;passing&quot;, his brother cuts him off from the family. Silk marries Iris, a non-religious Jewish woman, and has four children. His wife and children are unaware of his ancestry; he invents a Jewish background and tells them he&#x27;s unable to get in touch with his few living relatives.

A successful academic career in classics leads to his position of dean, where he raises the faculty&#x27;s standards by forcing out less academically accomplished professors. Decades later, he returns to teaching and is accused of racism as described above.

Some time after his approach to Zuckerman, Silk loses most contact with the people other than Faunia whom he is on good terms with, including his children and Zuckerman. In November, Silk and Faunia Farley are killed in a car accident, which Zuckerman suspects was caused by Farley&#x27;s jealous and abusive ex-husband Lester Farley, a Vietnam War veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. At Silk&#x27;s funeral, his sister Ernestine reveals his secret to Zuckerman. The novel ends with an encounter between Les Farley and Zuckerman, who is en route to New Jersey to have dinner with the Silk family.

Especially in the second half of the novel, there are scenes detailing the thoughts and feelings of other characters, notably Faunia, Les Farley, and Delphine Roux, Silk&#x27;s main antagonist at Athena. Zuckerman gives his sources for some conversations at which he was not present, but he also says, &quot;I imagine. I am forced to imagine. [...] It is my job. It&#x27;s now all I do.&quot;

==Background==
&quot;The Human Stain&quot; is set in 1998 in the United States, during the period of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s impeachment hearings and scandal over Monica Lewinsky. It is the third of Roth&#x27;s postwar novels that take on large social themes.

Roth described in a 2012 piece for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; how his novel was inspired by an event in the life of his friend Melvin Tumin, a &quot;professor of sociology at Princeton for some thirty years.&quot; Tumin was subject to a &quot;witch hunt&quot; but was ultimately found blameless in a matter involving use of allegedly racial language concerning two African American students.

==Critical response==

===Themes===
&quot;The Human Stain&quot; is the third in a trilogy, following &quot;American Pastoral&quot; and &quot;I Married a Communist&quot;, in which Roth explores American morality and its effects. Here he examines the cut-throat and, at times, petty, atmosphere in American academia, in which &quot;political correctness&quot; was upheld. Roth said he wrote the trilogy to reflect periods in the 20th centurythe McCarthy years, the Vietnam War, and President Bill Clinton&#x27;s impeachmentthat he thinks are the &quot;historical moments in post-war American life that have had the greatest impact on my generation.&quot;

Journalist Michiko Kakutani said that in &quot;The Human Stain&quot;, Roth &quot;explores issues of identity and self-invention in America which he had long explored in earlier works.&quot; She wrote the following interpretation:
It is a book that shows how the public Zeitgeist can shape, even destroy, an individual&#x27;s life, a book that takes all of Roth&#x27;s favorite themes of identity and rebellion and generational strife and refracts them not through the narrow prism of the self but through a wide-angle lens that exposes the fissures and discontinuities of 20th-century life. ... When stripped of its racial overtones, Roth&#x27;s book echoes a story he has told in novel after novel. Indeed, it closely parallels the story of Nathan Zuckerman, himself another dutiful, middle-class boy from New Jersey who rebelled against his family and found himself exiled, &#x27;unbound&#x27; as it were, from his roots.

Mark Shechner writes in his 2003 study that in the novel, Roth &quot;explores issues in American society that force a man such as Silk to hide his background, to the point of not having a personal history to share with his children or family. He wanted to pursue an independent course unbounded by racial restraints, but became what he once despised. His downfall to some extent is engineered by Delphine Roux, the young, female, elite, French intellectual who is dismayed to find herself in a New England outpost of sorts, and sees Silk as having become deadwood in academia, the very thing he abhorred at the beginning of his own career.&quot;

===Alleged resemblance to Anatole Broyard===
In the reviews of the book in both the daily and the Sunday &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2000, Kakutani and Lorrie Moore suggested that the central character of Coleman Silk might have been inspired by Anatole Broyard, a well-known New York literary editor of the &quot;Times&quot;. Other writers in the academic and mainstream press made the same suggestion. After Broyard&#x27;s death in 1990, it had been revealed that he racially passed during his many years employed as a critic at &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He was of Louisiana Creole ancestry.

Roth himself stated that he had not known of Broyard&#x27;s ancestry when he started writing the book and only learned of it months later. In Roth&#x27;s words, written in &quot;An Open Letter to Wikipedia&quot; and published by &quot;The New Yorker&quot;: &quot;Neither Broyard nor anyone associated with Broyard had anything to do with my imagining anything in &quot;The Human Stain&quot;.&quot; Roth stated that Coleman Silk was inspired &quot;by an unhappy event in the life of my late friend Melvin Tumin.&quot;

==Reception==
The novel was well received, became a national bestseller, and won numerous awards. According to Book Marks, primarily from American press, the book received a &quot;rave&quot; consensus, based on five critics: three &quot;rave&quot; and two &quot;positive&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Observer&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, and &quot;Times&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot;. 

In choosing it for its &quot;Editors&#x27; Choice&quot; list of 2000, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote:
When Zuckerman and Silk are together and testing each other, Roth&#x27;s writing reaches an emotional intensity and a vividness not exceeded in any of his books. The American dream of starting over entirely new has the force of inevitability here, and Roth&#x27;s judgment clearly is that you can never make it all the way. There is no comfort in this vision, but the tranquility Zuckerman achieves as he tells the story is infectious, and that is a certain reward.

In April 2013, &quot;GQ&quot; listed &quot;The Human Stain&quot; as one of the best books of the 21st century. The &quot;New York Times&quot; likewise, in 2024, listed the novel as one of the best books of the 21st century.

After Roth died, &quot;The New York Times&quot; asked several prominent authors to name their favorite work by him. Thomas Chatterton Williams chose &quot;The Human Stain&quot;, writing that &quot;Roth achieves something here that is very difficult to imagine his mostly domesticated descendants even attempting: He steps fully out of his own backyard and dares to imagine what he cannot possibly know by means of his own personal identity. I came to this gem late, as a 33-year-old &#x27;mixed-race&#x27; black man who&#x27;d just become the father of a blond-haired, blue-eyed &#x27;black&#x27; daughter who could pass for Swedish. Flipping through my paperback now, I smile as I reread the dog-eared pages, their margins overflowing with comments to the effect of: &quot;How can he possibly know that?&quot; There are many ways to display brilliance through narrative, but one of the most difficult — and courageous — is to render the I-who-is-not-I as vividly as one can render the self.&quot;

<text>The Resin Identification Code(RIC) is a technical standard with a set of symbols appearing on plastic products that identify the plastic resin out of which the product is made. It was developed in 1988 by the Society of the Plastics Industry (now the Plastics Industry Association) in the United States, but since 2008 it has been administered by ASTM International, an international standards organization.

Due to resemblance to the recycling symbol, RIC symbols are often mistaken for the former. Subsequent revisions to the RIC have replaced the arrows with a solid triangle, but the old symbols are still in common use.

==History==
The US Society of the Plastics Industry (SPI) first introduced the system in 1988 as the &quot;Voluntary Plastic Container Coding System&quot;. The SPI stated that one purpose of the original SPI code was to &quot;Provide a consistent national system to facilitate recycling of post-consumer plastics.&quot; The system has been adopted by a growing number of communities implementing recycling programs, as a tool to assist in sorting plastics. In order to deal with the concerns of recyclers across the U.S., the RIC system was designed to make it easier for workers in materials recovery and recycling facilities to sort and separate items according to their resin type. Plastics must be recycled separately, with other like materials, in order to preserve the value of the recycled material, and enable its reuse in other products after being recycled.

In its original form, the symbols used as part of the RIC consisted of arrows that cycle clockwise to form a triangle that encloses a number.

* 1: polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) (beverage bottles, cups, other packaging, etc.)
* 2: high-density polyethylene (HDPE) (bottles, cups, milk jugs, etc.)
* 3: polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (pipes, siding, flooring, etc.)
* 4: low-density polyethylene (LDPE) (plastic bags, six-pack rings, tubing, etc.)
* 5: polypropylene (PP) (auto parts, industrial fibres, food containers, etc.)
* 6: polystyrene (PS) (plastic utensils, Styrofoam, cafeteria trays, etc.)
* 7: Other (N/A) other plastics, such as acrylic, nylon and polycarbonate.

When a number is omitted, the arrows arranged in a triangle resemble the universal recycling symbol, a generic indicator of recyclability. Subsequent revisions to the RIC have replaced the arrows with a solid triangle, in order to address consumer confusion about the meaning of the RIC, and the fact that the presence of a RIC symbol on an item does not necessarily indicate that it is recyclable any more than its absence means the plastic object is necessarily &quot;un&quot;recyclable.

In 2008, ASTM International took over the administration of the RIC system and eventually issued ASTM D7611—Standard Practice for Coding Plastic Manufactured Articles for Resin Identification. In 2013 this standard was revised to change the graphic marking symbol of the RIC from the &quot;chasing arrows&quot; of the Recycling Symbol to a solid triangle instead.

== Consumer confusion ==
In the United States, use of the RIC in the coding of plastics has led to ongoing consumer confusion about which plastic products are recyclable. When many plastics recycling programs were first being implemented in communities across the United States, only plastics with RICs &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; (polyethylene terephthalate and high-density polyethylene, respectively) were accepted to be recycled. The list of acceptable plastic items has grown since then, and in some areas municipal recycling programs can collect and successfully recycle most plastic products regardless of their RIC. This has led some communities to instruct residents to refer to the form of packaging (i.e. &quot;bottles&quot;, &quot;tubs&quot;, &quot;lids&quot;, etc.) when determining what to include in a curbside recycling bin, rather than instructing them to rely on the RIC. To further alleviate consumer confusion, the American Chemistry Council launched the &quot;Recycling Terms &amp; Tools&quot; program to promote standardized language that can be used to educate consumers about how to recycle plastic products.

However, even when it is technically possible to recycle a particular plastic, it is often economically unfeasible to recycle it, and this can mislead consumers into thinking that more plastic is recycled than really is. In the U.S. in 2018, only 8.5% of plastic waste was recycled.

== Possible new codes ==
Modifications to the RIC are currently being discussed and developed by ASTM&#x27;s D20.95 subcommittee on recycled plastics.

In the U.S. the Sustainable Packaging Coalition has also created a &quot;How2Recycle&quot; label in an effort to replace the RIC with a label that aligns more closely with how the public currently uses the RIC. Rather than indicating what type of plastic resin a product is made out of, the four &quot;How2Recycle&quot; labels indicate whether a plastic product is

* Widely Recycled (meaning greater than 60 percent of the U.S. can recycle the item through a curbside recycling program or municipal drop-off location). 
* Limited (meaning only 20–60 percent of the U.S. can recycle the item through a curbside recycling program or municipal drop-off location). 
* Not Yet Recycled (meaning less than 20 percent of the U.S. can recycle the item through a curbside recycling program or municipal drop-off location). 
* Store Drop-Off (meaning the item can be recycled if brought to participating store drop-off locations, typically at grocery stores).

The &quot;How2Recycle&quot; labels also encourage consumers to check with local facilities to see what plastics each municipal recycling facility can accept.

== Unicode characters ==
The different resin identification codes can be represented by Unicode icons ♳ (U+2673), ♴ (U+2674), ♵ (U+2675), ♶ (U+2676), ♷ (U+2677), ♸ (U+2678), and ♹ (U+2679). ♺ (U+267A) is the portion of the symbol without the number or abbreviation.

<text>The Toronto Maple Leafs (officially the Toronto Maple Leaf Hockey Club and often referred to as the Leafs) are a professional ice hockey team based in Toronto. The Maple Leafs compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference. The club is owned by Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment, a company that owns several professional sports teams in the city, while the team&#x27;s broadcasting rights are split between BCE Inc. and Rogers Communications.

The club was founded as the Toronto Arenas for the inaugural 1917–18 NHL season, and rebranded to the Toronto St. Patricks after two years. Conn Smythe renamed the franchise to the Maple Leafs after buying it in 1927. The team played home games at the Mutual Street Arena for its first 14 seasons before moving to Maple Leaf Gardens in 1931. Since February 1999, the Maple Leafs play at Scotiabank Arena, which was formerly known as &quot;Air Canada Centre.&quot;

Toronto has won more Stanley Cup championships and played more NHL seasons than any team other than the Montreal Canadiens. The club had two recognized dynasties which spanned the 1946–47 to 1950–51 seasons and the 1961–62 to 1966–67 seasons, during which the Leafs won a combined eight of eleven Stanley Cup championships. These successes were followed by an extended championship drought, which at 57 seasons is the longest in league history. The Maple Leafs have rivalries with the Boston Bruins, Buffalo Sabres, Detroit Red Wings, the Montreal Canadiens, and the Ottawa Senators. The team&#x27;s American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate is the Toronto Marlies.

Several individuals who hold an association with the club have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Nineteen players have had their numbers retired by the Maple Leafs, including the first in professional sports.

== History ==

=== Early years (1917–1927) ===
The National Hockey League (NHL) was formed in 1917 in Montreal by teams formerly belonging to the National Hockey Association (NHA) that had a dispute with Eddie Livingstone, owner of the Toronto Blueshirts. The owners of the other four clubs—the Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers, Quebec Bulldogs and the Ottawa Senators—wanted to replace Livingstone, but discovered that the NHA constitution did not allow them to simply vote him out of the league. Instead, they opted to create a new league, the NHL, and did not invite Livingstone to join them. They also remained voting members of the NHA, and thus had enough votes to suspend the other league&#x27;s operations, effectively leaving Livingstone&#x27;s league with one team.

The NHL had decided that it would operate a four-team circuit, made up of the Canadiens, Montreal Maroons, Ottawa, and one more club in either Quebec City or Toronto. Toronto&#x27;s inclusion in the NHL&#x27;s inaugural season was formally announced on November 26, 1917, with concerns over the Bulldogs&#x27; financial stability surfacing. The League granted temporary franchise rights to the Arena Company, owners of the Arena Gardens. The NHL granted the Arena responsibility of the Toronto franchise for only the inaugural season, with specific instructions to resolve the dispute with Livingstone or transfer ownership of the Toronto franchise back to the League at the end of the season.
The franchise did not have an official name but was informally called &quot;the Blueshirts&quot; or &quot;the Torontos&quot; by the fans and press. Although the inaugural roster was made up of players leased from the NHA&#x27;s Toronto Blueshirts, including Harry Cameron and Reg Noble, the Maple Leafs do not claim the Blueshirts&#x27; history as their own. During the inaugural season, the club performed the first trade in NHL history, sending Sammy Hebert to the Senators, in return for cash. Under manager Charlie Querrie, and head coach Dick Carroll, the team won the Stanley Cup in the inaugural 1917–18 season.

For the next season, rather than return the Blueshirts&#x27; players to Livingstone as originally promised, on October 19, 1918, the Arena Company formed the Toronto Arena Hockey Club, which was readily granted full membership in the NHL. The Arena Company also decided that year that only NHL teams were allowed to play at the Arena Gardens—a move that effectively killed the NHA. Livingstone sued to get his players back. Mounting legal bills from the dispute forced the Arenas to sell some of their stars, resulting in a horrendous five-win season in 1918–19. With the company facing increasing financial difficulties, and the Arenas officially eliminated from the playoffs, the NHL agreed to let the team forfeit their last two games. Operations halted on February 20, 1919, with the NHL ending its season and starting the playoffs. The Arenas&#x27; .278 winning percentage that season remains the worst in franchise history. However, the 1919 Stanley Cup Finals ended without a winner due to the worldwide flu epidemic.
The legal dispute forced the Arena Company into bankruptcy, and it was forced to sell the team. On December 9, 1919, Querrie brokered the team&#x27;s purchase by the owners of the St. Patricks Hockey Club (Percy and Fred Hambly), allowing him to maintain an ownership stake in the team. The new owners renamed the team the Toronto St. Patricks (or St. Pats for short), which they used until 1927. Changing the colours of the team from blue to green, the club won their second Stanley Cup championship in 1922. Babe Dye scored four times in the 5–1 Stanley Cup-clinching victory against the Vancouver Millionaires.

In 1924, the team&#x27;s ownership changed again, as movie theatre impresario Nathan Nathanson and mining magnate Jack Bickell purchased the shares of the Hamblys. Bickell invested in the St. Pats as a favour to his friend Querrie, who needed to financially reorganize his hockey team.

=== Conn Smythe era (1927–1961) ===
After several financially difficult seasons, the St. Patricks&#x27; ownership group (Querrie and Nathan Nathanson) seriously considered selling the team to C. C. Pyle for . Pyle sought to move the team to Philadelphia. However, Toronto Varsity Blues coach Conn Smythe put together a group of his own and made a $160,000 ) offer. With the support of minority shareholder Bickell, Smythe persuaded Querrie and Nathanson to accept their bid, arguing that civic pride was more important than money. Bickell would become team president.

Smythe took control on February 14, 1927; installing himself as governor and general manager. He immediately renamed the team the Maple Leafs, after the national symbol of Canada, but the team was forced to play out the remainder of the 1926–27 season as St. Patricks. He attributed his choice of a maple leaf for the logo to his experiences as a Canadian Army officer and prisoner of war during World War I. Viewing the maple leaf as a &quot;badge of courage&quot;, and a reminder of home, Smythe decided to give the same name to his hockey team, in honour of the many Canadian soldiers who wore it. However, the team was not the first to use the name. A Toronto minor-league baseball team had used the name &quot;Toronto Maple Leafs&quot; since 1895. Although Smythe would not acquire controlling interest in the team until 1947, he would be the franchise&#x27;s dominant voice for the next four decades.

Initial reports were that the team&#x27;s colours were to be red and white, but the Leafs wore white sweaters with a green maple leaf for their first game on February 17, 1927. On September 27, 1927, it was announced that the Leafs had changed their colour scheme to blue and white. Although Smythe later stated he chose blue because it represents the Canadian skies and white to represent snow, these colours were also used on the trucks for his gravel and sand business. The colour blue was also a colour historically associated with the City of Toronto. The use of blue by top-level Toronto-based sports clubs began with the Argonaut Rowing Club in the 19th century, later adopted by their football team, the Toronto Argonauts, in 1873.

==== Opening of Maple Leaf Gardens (1930s) ====

By 1930, Smythe saw the need to construct a new arena, viewing the Arena Gardens as a facility lacking modern amenities and seating. Finding an adequate number of financiers, he purchased land from the Eaton family, and construction of the arena was completed in five months.

The Maple Leafs debuted at their new arena, Maple Leaf Gardens, with a 2–1 loss to the Chicago Black Hawks on November 12, 1931. The opening ceremonies for Maple Leaf Gardens included a performance from the 48th Highlanders of Canada Pipe and Drums. The military band has continued to perform in every subsequent season home opening game, as well as other ceremonies conducted by the hockey club. The debut also featured Foster Hewitt in his newly constructed press box above the ice surface, where he began his famous &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; radio broadcasts that eventually came to be a Saturday-night tradition. The press box was often called &quot;the gondola&quot;, a name that emerged during the Gardens&#x27; inaugural season when a General Motors advertising executive remarked how it resembled the gondola of an airship.
By the 1931–32 NHL season, the Maple Leafs were led by the &quot;Kid Line&quot; consisting of Busher Jackson, Joe Primeau and Charlie Conacher and coached by Dick Irvin. The team captured their third Stanley Cup that season, vanquishing the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round, the Montreal Maroons in the semifinals, and the New York Rangers in the finals. Smythe took particular pleasure in defeating the Rangers that year. He had been tapped as the Rangers&#x27; first general manager and coach for their inaugural season (1926–27) but had been fired in a dispute with Madison Square Garden management before the season had begun.

Maple Leafs star forward Ace Bailey was nearly killed in 1933 when Boston Bruins defenceman Eddie Shore checked him from behind at full speed into the boards. Leafs defenceman Red Horner knocked Shore out with a punch, but Bailey, writhing on the ice, had his career ended. The Leafs held the Ace Bailey Benefit Game, the NHL&#x27;s first All-Star Game, to collect medical funds to help Bailey. His jersey was retired later the same night. The Leafs reached the finals five times in the next seven years but bowed out to the now-disbanded Maroons in 1935, the Detroit Red Wings in 1936, Chicago in 1938, Boston in 1939 and the Rangers in 1940. After the end of the 1939–40 season, Smythe allowed Irvin to leave the team as head coach, replacing him with former Leafs captain Hap Day.

==== The first dynasty (1940s) ====

In the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals, the Maple Leafs were down three games to none in the best-of-seven series against Detroit. Fourth-line forward Don Metz then galvanized the team, to score a hat-trick in game four and the game-winner in game five. Goalie Turk Broda shut out the Wings in game six, and Sweeney Schriner scored two goals in the third period to win the seventh game 3–1, completing the reverse-sweep. The Leafs remain the only team to have successfully performed a reverse-sweep in the Stanley Cup finals. Captain Syl Apps won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy that season, not taking one penalty, and finished his 10-season career with an average of 5 minutes, 36 seconds in penalties a season.

Smythe, who reenlisted in the Canadian Army at the outbreak of World War II, was given leave from military duty to view the final game of the 1942 finals. He arrived at the game in full military regalia. Earlier, at the outbreak of war, Smythe arranged for many of his Maple Leafs players and staff to take army training with the Toronto Scottish Regiment. Most notably, the Leafs announced a large portion of their roster had enlisted, including Apps, and Broda, who did not play on the team for several seasons due to their obligations with the Canadian Forces. During this period, the Leafs turned to lesser-known players such as rookie goaltender Frank McCool and defenceman Babe Pratt.

The Maple Leafs beat the Red Wings in the 1945 Finals. They won the first three games, with goaltender McCool recording consecutive shutouts. However, in a reversal of the 1942 finals, the Red Wings won the next three games. The Leafs were able to win the series, winning the seventh game by the score of 2–1 to prevent a complete reversal of the series played three years ago.
After the end of the war, players who had enlisted were beginning to return to their teams. With Apps and Broda regaining their form, the Maple Leafs beat the first-place Canadiens in the 1947 finals. To bolster their centre depth, the Leafs acquired Cy Thomas and Max Bentley in the following off-season. With these key additions, the Leafs were able to win a second consecutive Stanley Cup, sweeping the Red Wings in the 1948 finals. With their victory in 1948, the Leafs moved ahead of Montreal as the team having won the most Stanley Cups in League history. Apps announced his retirement following the 1948 finals, with Ted Kennedy replacing him as the team&#x27;s captain. Under a new captaincy, the Leafs managed to make it to the 1949 finals, facing the Red Wings, who had finished the season with the best overall record. However, the Leafs went on to win their third consecutive Cup, sweeping the Red Wings in four games. This brought the total of Detroit&#x27;s playoff game losses against the Leafs to eleven. The Red Wings were able to end this losing streak in the following postseason, eliminating Toronto in the 1950 NHL playoffs.

==== The Barilko Curse (1950s) ====
The Maple Leafs and Canadiens met again in the 1951 finals, with five consecutive overtime games played in the series. Defenceman Bill Barilko managed to score the series-winning goal in overtime, leaving his defensive position (despite coach Joe Primeau&#x27;s instructions otherwise) to pick up an errant pass and score. Barilko helped the club secure its fourth Stanley Cup in five years. His glory was short-lived, as he disappeared in a plane crash near Timmins, Ontario, four months later. The crash site was not found until a helicopter pilot discovered the plane&#x27;s wreckage plane about north of Cochrane, Ontario 11 years later. The Leafs did not win another Cup during the 1950s, with rumours swirling that the team was &quot;cursed&quot;, and would not win a cup until Barilko&#x27;s body was found. The &quot;curse&quot; came to an end after the Leafs&#x27; 1962 Stanley Cup victory, which came six weeks before the discovery of the wreckage of Barilko&#x27;s plane.

Their 1951 victory was followed by lacklustre performances in the following seasons. The team finished third in the 1951–52 season and was eventually swept by the Red Wings in the semifinals. With the conclusion of the 1952–53 regular season, the Leafs failed to make it to the postseason for the first time since the 1945–46 playoffs. The Leafs&#x27; poor performance may be attributed partly to a decline in their sponsored junior system (including the Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s Majors and the Toronto Marlboros). The junior system was managed by Frank J. Selke until his departure to the Canadiens in 1946. In his absence, the quality of players it produced declined. Many who were called up to the Leafs in the early 1950s were found to be seriously lacking in ability. It was only later in the decade that the Leafs&#x27; feeder clubs produced prospects that helped them become competitive again.

After a two-year drought from the playoffs, the Maple Leafs clinched a berth after the 1958–59 season. Under Punch Imlach, their new general manager and coach, the Leafs made it to the 1959 Finals, losing to the Canadiens in five games. Building on a successful playoff run, the Leafs followed up with a second-place finish in the 1959–60 regular season. Although they advanced to their second straight Cup Finals, the Leafs were again defeated by the Canadiens in four games.

=== New owners and a new dynasty (1961–1971) ===

Beginning in the 1960s, the Leafs became a stronger team, with Johnny Bower as the goaltender, and Bob Baun, Carl Brewer, Tim Horton and Allan Stanley serving as the Maple Leafs&#x27; defencemen. To bolster their forward group during the 1960 off-season, Imlach traded Marc Reaume to the Red Wings for Red Kelly. Originally a defenceman, Kelly was asked to make the transition to the role of centre, where he remained for the rest of his career. Kelly helped reinforce a forward group made up of Frank Mahovlich, and team captain George Armstrong. The beginning of the 1960–61 season also saw the debut of rookies Bob Nevin, and Dave Keon. Keon previously played for the St. Michael&#x27;s Majors (the Maple Leafs junior affiliate), but had impressed Imlach during the Leafs&#x27; training camp, and joined the team for the season. Despite these new additions, the Leafs&#x27; 1961 playoff run ended in the semifinals against the Red Wings, with Armstrong, Bower, Kelly and others, suffering from injuries.

In November 1961, Smythe sold nearly all of his shares in the club&#x27;s parent company, Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL), to a partnership composed of his son Stafford Smythe, and his partners, newspaper baron John W. H. Bassett and Toronto Marlboros president Harold Ballard. The sale price was $2.3 million (), a handsome return on Smythe&#x27;s original investment 34 years earlier. Initially, Conn Smythe claimed that he knew nothing about his son&#x27;s partners and was furious with the arrangement (though it is highly unlikely he could have believed Stafford could have financed the purchase on his own). However, he did not stop the deal because of it. Conn Smythe was given a retiring salary of $15,000 per year for life, an office, a secretary, a car with a driver, and seats to home games. Smythe sold his remaining shares in the company, and resigned from the board of directors in March 1966, after a Muhammad Ali boxing match was scheduled for the Gardens. Smythe found Ali&#x27;s refusal to serve in the United States Army offensive, noting that the Gardens was &quot;no place for those who want to evade conscription in their own country&quot;. He had also said that because the Gardens&#x27; owners agreed to host the fight they had &quot;put cash ahead of class&quot;.
Under the new ownership, Toronto won another three straight Stanley Cups. The team won the 1962 Stanley Cup Finals beating the defending champion Chicago Black Hawks on a goal from Dick Duff in game 6. During the 1962–63 season, the Leafs finished first in the league for the first time since the 1947–48 season. In the following playoffs, the team won their second Stanley Cup of the decade. The 1963–64 season saw certain members of the team traded. With Imlach seeking to reinvigorate the slumping Leafs, he made a mid-season trade that sent Duff, and Nevin to the Rangers for Andy Bathgate and Don McKenney. The Leafs managed to make the postseason as well as the Cup finals. In game six of the 1964 Cup finals, Baun suffered a fractured ankle and required a stretcher to be taken off the ice. He returned to play with his ankle frozen, and eventually scored the game-winning goal in overtime against the Red Wings. The Leafs won their third consecutive Stanley Cup in a 4–0 game 7 victory; Bathgate scored two goals.

The two seasons after the Maple Leafs&#x27; Stanley Cup victories, the team saw several player departures, including Bathgate, and Brewer, as well as several new additions, including Marcel Pronovost, and Terry Sawchuk. During the 1966–67 season, the team had lost 10 games in a row, sending Imlach to the hospital with a stress-related illness. However, from the time King Clancy took over as the head coach, to Imlach&#x27;s return, the club was on a 10-game undefeated streak, building momentum before the playoffs. The Leafs made their last Cup finals in 1967. Playing against Montreal, the heavy favourite for the year, the Leafs managed to win, with Bob Pulford scoring the double-overtime winner in game three; Jim Pappin scored the series winner in game 6. Keon was named the playoff&#x27;s most valuable player and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.

From 1968 to 1970, the Maple Leafs made it to the playoffs only once. They lost several players to the 1967 NHL expansion draft, and the team was racked with dissension because of Imlach&#x27;s authoritative manner, and his attempts to prevent the players from joining the newly formed Players&#x27; Association. Imlach&#x27;s management of the team was also brought into question due to some of his decisions. It was apparent that he was too loyal to aging players who had been with him since 1958. In the 1967–68 season, Mahovlich was traded to Detroit in a deal that saw the Leafs acquire Paul Henderson and Norm Ullman. The Leafs managed to return to the playoffs after the 1968–69 season, only to be swept by the Bruins. Immediately after, Stafford Smythe confronted Imlach and fired him. This act was not without controversy, with some older players, including Horton, declaring that, &quot;if this team doesn&#x27;t want Imlach, I guess it doesn&#x27;t want me&quot;.

The Maple Leafs completed the 1969–70 season out of the playoffs. With their low finish, the Leafs were able to draft Darryl Sittler at the 1970 NHL amateur draft. The Leafs returned to the playoffs after the 1970–71 season with the addition of Sittler, as well as Bernie Parent and Jacques Plante, who were both acquired through trades during the season. They were eliminated in the first round against the Rangers.

=== The Ballard years (1971–1990) ===

A series of events in 1971 made Harold Ballard the primary owner of the Maple Leafs. After a series of disputes between Bassett, Ballard and Stafford Smythe, Bassett sold his stake in the company to them. Shortly afterwards, Smythe died in October 1971. Under the terms of Stafford&#x27;s will, of which Ballard was an executor, each partner was allowed to buy the other&#x27;s shares upon their death. Stafford&#x27;s brother and son tried to keep the shares in the family, but in February 1972 Ballard bought all of Stafford&#x27;s shares for $7.5 million, valuing the company at $22 million (). Six months later, Ballard was convicted of charges including fraud, and theft of money and goods, and spent a year at Milhaven Penitentiary.

By the end of 1971, the World Hockey Association (WHA) began operations as a direct competitor to the NHL. Believing the WHA would not be able to compete against the NHL, Ballard&#x27;s attitude caused the Maple Leafs to lose key players, including Parent to the upstart league. Undermanned and demoralized, the Leafs finished with the fourth-worst record for the 1972–73 season. They got the fourth overall pick in the 1973 NHL amateur draft, and drafted Lanny McDonald. General Manager Jim Gregory also acquired the 10th overall pick from the Philadelphia Flyers, and the 15th overall pick from the Bruins, using them to acquire Bob Neely and Ian Turnbull. In addition to these first-round picks, the Leafs also acquired Borje Salming during the 1973 off-season.

Despite acquiring Tiger Williams in the 1974 draft, and Roger Neilson as head coach in the 1977–78 season, the Maple Leafs found themselves eliminated in the playoffs by stronger Flyers or Canadiens teams from 1975 to 1979. Although Neilson was a popular coach with fans and his players, he found himself at odds with Ballard, who fired him late in the 1977–78 season. Nielson was later reinstated after appeals from the players and the public. He continued as Leafs&#x27; head coach until after the 1979 playoffs, when he was fired again, alongside Gregory. Gregory was replaced by Imlach as general manager.

In the first year of his second stint as general manager, Imlach became embroiled in a dispute with Leafs&#x27; captain Darryl Sittler over his attempt to take part in the Showdown series for &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. In a move to undermine Sittler&#x27;s influence on the team, Imlach traded McDonald, who was Sittler&#x27;s friend. By the end of the 1979–80 season, Imlach had traded away nearly half of the roster he had at the beginning of his tenure as general manager. With the situation between Ballard and Sittler worsening, Sittler asked to be traded. Forcing the Leafs&#x27; hand, the club&#x27;s new general manager, Gerry McNamara, traded Sittler to the Flyers on January 20, 1982. Rick Vaive was named the team&#x27;s captain shortly after Sittler&#x27;s departure.

The Maple Leafs&#x27; management continued in disarray throughout most of the decade, with an inexperienced McNamara named as Imlach&#x27;s replacement in September 1981. He was followed by Gord Stellick on April 28, 1988, who was replaced by Floyd Smith on August 15, 1989. Coaching was similarly shuffled often after Nielson&#x27;s departure. Imlach&#x27;s first choice for coach was his former player Smith, although he did not finish the 1979–80 season after being hospitalized by a car accident on March 14, 1980. Joe Crozier was named the new head coach until January 10, 1981, when he was succeeded by Mike Nykoluk. Nykoluk was head coach until April 2, 1984. Dan Maloney returned as head coach from 1984 to 1986, with John Brophy named head coach from 1986 to 1988. Both coaches had little success during their tenure. Doug Carpenter was named the new head coach to begin the 1989–90 season when the Leafs posted their first season above .500 in the decade.

The team did not have much success during the decade, missing the playoffs entirely in 1982, 1984 and 1985. On at least two occasions, they made the playoffs with the worst winning percentages on record for a playoff team. However, in those days, the top four teams in each division made the playoffs, regardless of record. Since the Norris only had five teams in total, this meant only the last-place team in the division missed the postseason. In 1985–86, for instance, they finished with a .356 winning percentage, the fourth worst in the league. However, due to playing in a Norris Division where no team cracked the 90-point mark, the Leafs still made the playoffs because Detroit had the worst record in the league. In 1987–88, they entered the final day of the season with the worst record in the league, but were only one point behind the Minnesota North Stars and thus were still in playoff contention. The Red Wings was the only team in the division with a winning record. However, the Leafs upset the Red Wings in their final game while the North Stars lost to the Flames hours later to hand the Leafs the final spot from the Norris.

The low finishes allowed the team to draft Wendel Clark first overall at the 1985 NHL entry draft. Clark managed to lead the Leafs to the playoffs from 1986 to 1988, as well as the 1990 playoffs. Ballard died on April 11, 1990.

=== Resurgence (1990–2004) ===

Don Crump, Don Giffin, and Steve Stavro were named executors of Ballard&#x27;s estate. Stavro succeeded Ballard as chairman of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. and governor of the Maple Leafs. Cliff Fletcher was hired by Giffin to be the new general manager, although this was opposed by Stavro, who told Fletcher that he wanted to appoint his own general manager.

Notwithstanding Stavro&#x27;s initial reluctance with Fletcher&#x27;s appointment, the Leafs&#x27; new ownership would soon earn a reputation for steering clear of exerting undue interference in hockey operations, in stark contrast to Ballard. Fletcher soon set about building a competitive club, hiring Pat Burns as the new coach, and making a series of trades and free-agent acquisitions, such as acquiring Doug Gilmour and Dave Andreychuk, which turned the Leafs into a contender. Assisted by stellar goaltending from minor league call-up Felix Potvin, the team posted a then-franchise-record 99 points.

During the 1993 playoffs, Toronto dispatched the Detroit Red Wings in seven games in the first round, then defeated the St. Louis Blues in another seven games in the division finals. Hoping to meet long-time rival Montreal (who was playing in the Wales Conference finals against the New York Islanders) in the Cup finals, the Leafs faced the Los Angeles Kings in the Campbell Conference finals. They led the series 3–2 but dropped game six in Los Angeles. The game was not without controversy, as Wayne Gretzky clipped Gilmour in the face with his stick, but referee Kerry Fraser did not call a penalty, and Gretzky scored the winning goal moments later. The Leafs eventually lost in game seven 5–4.
The Leafs had another strong season in 1993–94, starting the season on a ten-game winning streak, and finishing it with 98 points. The team made it to the conference finals again, only to be eliminated by the Vancouver Canucks in five games. At the 1994 NHL entry draft, the Leafs packaged Wendel Clark in a multi-player trade with the Quebec Nordiques that landed them Mats Sundin. After the Leafs traded Gilmour to the New Jersey Devils in 1997, Sundin was named captain. Missing two consecutive playoffs in 1997 and 1998, the Leafs relieved Fletcher as general manager.

==== New home and a new millennium (1998–2004) ====
On February 12, 1998, MLGL purchased the Toronto Raptors, a National Basketball Association franchise, and the arena the Raptors were building, from Allan Slaight and Scotiabank. With the acquisition, MLGL was renamed Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment (MLSE), acting as the parent company of the two teams. Larry Tanenbaum was a driving force in the acquisition, having bought a 12.5 percent stake in Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL) in 1996.

Curtis Joseph was acquired as the team&#x27;s starting goalie, while Pat Quinn was hired as the head coach before the 1998–99 season. Realigning the NHL&#x27;s conferences in 1998, the Leafs were moved from the Western to the Eastern Conference. On February 13, 1999, the Leafs played their final game at the Gardens before moving to their new home at the then-Air Canada Centre. In the 1999 playoffs, the team advanced to the conference finals but lost in five games to the Buffalo Sabres.
In the 1999–2000 season, the Leafs hosted the 50th NHL All-Star Game. By the end of the season, they recorded their first 100-point season and won their first division title in 37 years. In both the 2000 and 2001 playoffs, the Leafs defeated the Ottawa Senators in the first round and lost to the New Jersey Devils in the second round. In the 2002 playoffs, the Leafs dispatched the Islanders and the Senators in seven games each during the first two rounds, only to lose to the Cinderella-story Carolina Hurricanes in six games in the conference finals. The 2001–02 season was particularly impressive in that injuries sidelined many of the Leafs&#x27; better players, but the efforts of depth players, including Alyn McCauley, Gary Roberts and Darcy Tucker, led them to the conference finals.

As Joseph opted to become a free agent during the 2002 off-season, the Leafs signed Ed Belfour as the new starting goaltender. Belfour played well during the 2002–03 season and was a finalist for the Vezina Trophy. The Leafs lost to Philadelphia in seven games during the first round of the 2003 playoffs. In 2003, an ownership change occurred in MLSE. Stavro sold his controlling interest in MLSE to the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan (OTPP) and resigned his position as chairman in favour of Tanenbaum. Quinn remained as head coach but was replaced as general manager by John Ferguson Jr.

Before the 2003–04 season, the team held their training camp in Sweden and played in the NHL Challenge against teams from Sweden and Finland. The Leafs went on to enjoy a very successful regular season, leading the NHL at the time of the All-Star Game (with Quinn named head coach of the East&#x27;s All-Star Team). They finished the season with a then-franchise-record 103 points. They finished with the fourth-best record in the League, and their highest overall finish in 41 years, achieving a .628 win percentage, their best in 43 years, and third-best in franchise history. In the 2004 playoffs, the Leafs defeated the Senators in the first round of the postseason for the fourth time in five years, with Belfour posting three shutouts in seven games, but lost to the Flyers in six games during the second round.

=== After the lockout (2005–2014) ===

Following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the Maple Leafs experienced their longest playoff drought in the team&#x27;s history. They struggled in the 2005–06 season; despite a late-season surge (9–1–2 in their final 12 games), led by goaltender Jean-Sebastien Aubin, Toronto was out of playoff contention for the first time since 1998. This marked the first time the team had missed the postseason under Quinn, who was later relieved as head coach. Quinn&#x27;s dismissal was controversial since many of the young players who were key contributors to the Leafs&#x27; late-season run had been drafted by him before Ferguson&#x27;s arrival, while Ferguson&#x27;s signings (Jason Allison, Belfour, Alexander Khavanov, and Eric Lindros) had suffered season-ending injuries.

Paul Maurice, who had previously coached the inaugural season of the Maple Leafs&#x27; Toronto Marlies farm team, was named as Quinn&#x27;s replacement. On June 30, 2006, the Leafs bought out fan-favourite Tie Domi&#x27;s contract. The team also decided against picking up the option year on goaltender Ed Belfour&#x27;s contract; he became a free agent. However, despite the coaching change, as well as a shuffle in the roster, the team did not make the playoffs in 2006–07. During the 2007–08 season, John Ferguson Jr. was fired in January 2008 and replaced by former Leafs&#x27; general manager Cliff Fletcher on an interim basis. The team retained Toronto-based sports lawyer Gord Kirke to begin a search for a new team president and general manager, and negotiate a contract. The Leafs did not qualify for the postseason, marking the first time since 1928 the team had failed to make the playoffs for three consecutive seasons. It was also Sundin&#x27;s last year with the Leafs, as his contract was due to expire at the end of the season. However, he refused Leafs management&#x27;s request to waive his no-trade clause for the team to rebuild by acquiring prospects or draft picks. On May 7, 2008, after the 2007–08 season, the Leafs fired Maurice, as well as assistant coach Randy Ladouceur, naming Ron Wilson as the new head coach, and Tim Hunter and Rob Zettler as assistant coaches.
On November 29, 2008, the Maple Leafs hired Brian Burke as their 13th non-interim, and the first American, general manager in team history. The acquisition ended the second Cliff Fletcher era and settled persistent rumours that Burke was coming to Toronto. On June 26, 2009, Burke made his first appearance as the Leafs GM at the 2009 NHL entry draft, selecting London Knights forward Nazem Kadri with the seventh overall pick. On September 18, 2009, Burke traded Toronto&#x27;s first- and second-round 2010, as well as its 2011 first-round picks, to the Boston Bruins in exchange for forward Phil Kessel. On January 31, 2010, the Leafs made another high-profile trade, this time with the Calgary Flames in a seven-player deal that brought defenceman Dion Phaneuf to Toronto. On June 14, during the off-season, the Leafs named Phaneuf captain after two seasons without one following Sundin&#x27;s departure. On February 18, 2011, the team traded long-time Maple Leafs defenceman Tomas Kaberle to the Bruins in exchange for prospect Joe Colborne, Boston&#x27;s first-round pick in 2011, and a conditional second-round draft choice.

On March 2, 2012, Burke fired Wilson and named Randy Carlyle the new head coach. However, the termination proved to be controversial as Wilson had received a contract extension just two months before being let go. Changes at the ownership level also occurred in August 2012, when the OTPP completed the sale of their shares in MLSE to BCE Inc. and Rogers Communications. On January 9, 2013, Burke was fired as general manager, and replaced by Dave Nonis. In their first full season under the leadership of Carlyle, Toronto managed to secure a playoff berth in the 2012–13 season (which was shortened again due to another lock-out) for the first time in eight years. However, the Leafs lost in seven games to eventual 2013 Stanley Cup finalist Boston in the first round. Despite the season&#x27;s success, it was not repeated during the 2013–14 season, as the Leafs failed to make the playoffs.

=== Brendan Shanahan era (2014–present) ===

Following the 2013–14 regular season, Brendan Shanahan was named as the president and an alternate governor of the Maple Leafs. On January 6, 2015, the Leafs fired Randy Carlyle as head coach, and assistant coach Peter Horachek took over on an interim basis immediately. While the Leafs had a winning record before Carlyle&#x27;s firing, the team eventually collapsed. On February 6, 2015, the Leafs set a new franchise record of 11 consecutive games without a win. At the beginning of February, Shanahan gained the approval of MLSE&#x27;s board of directors to begin a &quot;scorched earth&quot; rebuild of the club. Both Dave Nonis and Horachek were relieved of their duties on April 12, just one day after the season concluded. In addition, the Leafs also fired several assistant coaches, including Steve Spott, and Rick St. Croix; as well as individuals from the Leafs&#x27; player scouting department.

On May 20, 2015, Mike Babcock was named as the new head coach, and on July 23, Lou Lamoriello was named the 16th general manager in team history. On July 1, 2015, the Leafs packaged Kessel in a multi-player deal to the Pittsburgh Penguins in return for three skaters, including Kasperi Kapanen, a conditional first-round pick, and a third-round pick. Toronto also retained $1.2 million of Kessel&#x27;s salary for the remaining seven seasons of his contract. During the following season, on February 9, 2016, the Leafs packaged Phaneuf in another multi-player deal, acquiring four players, as well as a 2017 second-round pick from the Ottawa Senators. The team finished last in the NHL for the first time since the 1984–85 season. They subsequently won the draft lottery and used the first overall pick to draft Auston Matthews.
In their second season under Babcock, Toronto secured the final Eastern Conference wildcard spot for the 2017 playoffs. On April 23, 2017, the Maple Leafs were eliminated from the playoffs by the top-seeded Washington Capitals four games to two in the best-of-seven series.

Toronto finished the 2017–18 season with 105 points by beating Montreal 4–2 in their final game of the regular season, a franchise-record, beating the previous record of 103 points set in 2004. They faced the Boston Bruins in the first round and lost in seven games. Following the playoffs, Lamoriello was not renewed as general manager. Kyle Dubas was subsequently named the team&#x27;s 17th general manager in May 2018. During the 2018 off-season, the Maple Leafs signed John Tavares to a seven-year, $77 million contract. On April 1, the Maple Leafs clinched a division berth for the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Maple Leafs were eliminated in the first round of the 2019 playoffs on April 23, after losing to the Bruins in a seven-game series.

On October 2, 2019, Tavares was named as the team&#x27;s 25th team captain prior to the Leafs&#x27; 2019–20 season opening game. After a 9–10–4 start to the 2019–20 season, the club relieved Babcock as head coach on November 20, with Sheldon Keefe named as his replacement. The Maple Leafs were eliminated in the 2020 Stanley Cup Qualifiers on August 9, after losing a five-game series against the Columbus Blue Jackets.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions at the Canada–United States border, the Leafs were temporarily moved to the North Division for the 2020–21 season alongside the NHL&#x27;s other Canadian teams. During that season, teams only played games against teams in their divisions, in a limited 56-game season. On May 8, 2021, the Leafs clinched the North Division title, giving the Leafs guaranteed home advantage in the first two rounds of the 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs. Matthews also led the league in goals with 41 goals, becoming the first Maple Leaf to win the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy. However, the Leafs lost in the first round to their rivals, the Montreal Canadiens, with the Leafs surrendering a 3–1 series lead in the process.

Despite the ending to the previous season, the Leafs were poised to make another run, with much of the core roster intact. Aided by the arrival of defenceman Mark Giordano and centre Colin Blackwell from the Seattle Kraken on March 21, the team cruised throughout the regular season. The Maple Leafs broke their franchise record for points in a season, with 115, and wins in a season, with 50, during a 4–2 victory over the New York Islanders on April 17. Despite the achievement, they were unable to match the league-leading Florida Panthers&#x27;, finishing second in the Atlantic Division During the season, Matthews became the first Leaf in a decade to score 60 goals in a season, and was awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy. The Leafs made the playoffs but lost in the first round to the Tampa Bay Lightning in seven games. With this loss, the Maple Leafs became the first team in the four major North American sports leagues to lose five consecutive winner-take-all games.

The 2022 off-season saw the departure of the Leafs&#x27; goalie tandem, Jack Campbell and Petr Mrazek, the former signing with Edmonton, the latter being traded to the Blackhawks during the 2022 NHL entry draft. Needing a goaltender tandem for the upcoming season, the Leafs acquired Matt Murray through a trade with the Senators, and signed free agent Ilya Samsonov.

During the 2022–23 NHL season, the Leafs again fared well in the regular season, achieving an excellent 50–21–11 record and 111 points, one point less than the record achieved the season prior. However, the record-setting 2022–23 Boston Bruins led the division, finishing with 135 points, and leaving the Leafs in second place in the Atlantic. In the first round of the playoffs, the Leafs defeated the Lightning in a six-game series, marking the first time the Maple Leafs advanced to the second round of the playoff appearance since 2004. During the series with the Lightning, the Leafs became the first NHL team to win three road playoff games in overtime. However, the Leafs lost to the Florida Panthers in the second round in five games. Following the loss, Dubas&#x27; contract as general manager was not renewed with the club for the 2023–24 season. Dubas was then replaced by Brad Treliving on May 31.

In 2023–2024, the team finished with a 46–26–10 record, good for 102 points and the third seed in the Atlantic Division. Matthews broke his own career and franchise records for goals in a season, with 69, and was awarded his third Rocket Richard Trophy. However, they were again eliminated in the first round of the playoffs, falling to the Bruins in seven games. After the season, Keefe was dismissed as head coach on May 9, with Craig Berube hired as his successor on May 17.

Prior to the 2024–25 season, Tavares relinquished his role as captain to Matthews on August 14, 2024, with the latter becoming the 26th overall and first American-born captain in franchise history.

== Team culture ==

=== Fan base ===
The price of a Maple Leafs home game ticket is the highest amongst any team in the NHL. Scotiabank Arena holds 18,819 seats for Leafs games, with 15,500 reserved for season ticket holders. Because of the demand for season tickets, their sale is limited to the 10,000 people on the waiting list. As of March 2016, Leafs&#x27; season tickets saw a renewal rate of 99.5 percent, a rate that would require more than 250 years to clear the existing waiting list. In a 2014 survey by &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot;, the Leafs were ranked last out of the 122 professional teams in the Big Four leagues. Teams were graded by stadium experience, ownership, player quality, ticket affordability, championships won and &quot;bang for the buck&quot;; in particular, the Leafs came last in ticket affordability.
Leafs fans are known for their dedicated support and notable loyalty to the team despite their performance. They are considered to have one of the loudest and largest fan base in the NHL. In a study conducted by sports retailer Fanatics in March 2017, the Leafs and the Minnesota Wild were the only two NHL teams to average arena sellouts despite a below league average winning percentage. Conversely, fans of other teams harbour an equally passionate dislike of the team. In November 2002, the Leafs were named by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; hockey writer Michael Farber as the &quot;Most Hated Team in Hockey&quot;.

Despite their loyalty, there have been several instances where the fanbase voiced their displeasure with the club. During the 2011–12 season, fans attending the games chanted for the dismissal of head coach Ron Wilson, and later general manager Brian Burke. Wilson was let go shortly after the fans&#x27; outburst, even though he had been given a contract extension months earlier. Burke alluded to the chants noting &quot;it would be cruel and unusual punishment to let Ron coach another game in the Air Canada Centre&quot;. In the 2014–15 season, fans threw Leafs jerseys onto the ice to show their disapproval of the team&#x27;s poor performances in the past few decades. Similarly, during the later portion of the 2015–16 season, which overlaps with the start of Major League Baseball&#x27;s regular season of play, fans were heard sarcastically chanting &quot;Let&#x27;s go Blue Jays!&quot; and clapping alongside the chant as a sign of their farcical shift in priority from an under-performing team to the more successful playoff-bound 2016 Toronto Blue Jays season. Leafs fans also vandalized Mike Babcock&#x27;s Wikipedia article amid the poor records of the first few months into the 2019–20 season; his article was temporarily semi-protected to minimize further vandalism.

In addition to the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), many fans live throughout Ontario, Quebec, including the New York state and Michigan. As a result, Leafs&#x27; away games at the Canadian Tire Centre in Ottawa, Bell Centre in Montreal, KeyBank Center in Buffalo and at the Little Caesars Arena in Detroit host a more neutral attendance. This is due in part to the Leafs fans in those areas, and those cities&#x27; proximity to the GTA.

The Leafs are also a popular team in Atlantic Canada. In November 2016, a survey was conducted that found 20 percent of respondents from Atlantic Canada viewed the Leafs as their favourite team, second only to the Montreal Canadiens at 26 percent. The Leafs were found to be the most favoured team in Prince Edward Island, with 24 percent of respondents favouring the Leafs; and the second favourite team in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador (19 and 24 percent respectively, both trailing respondents who favoured the Canadiens by one percent).

=== Rivalries ===

During the 25 years of the Original Six era (1942–67), teams played each other 14 times during the regular season, and with only four teams continuing into the playoffs, rivalries were intense. The Maple Leafs established several rivalries with other teams that played in this era, including the Boston Bruins, Detroit Red Wings, and the Montreal Canadiens. In addition to the aforementioned teams, the Maple Leafs have also developed a rivalry with the Ottawa Senators, as well as a minor geographic rivalry with the Buffalo Sabres called the Battle of the QEW after the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW), the freeway that links Buffalo with Toronto along the western edge of Lake Ontario within the Golden Horseshoe.

==== Boston Bruins ====
Both teams are Original Six teams, with their first game played in Boston&#x27;s inaugural season on December 3, 1924. In the match-up, the St. Patricks earned a 5–3 victory against the Bruins at Mutual Street Arena. The Maple Leafs played their first Stanley Cup playoff series against the Bruins in 1933, winning the series 3–2. From 1933 to 2019, the two teams played in 16 postseason series against one another, including one Stanley Cup Finals.

The rivalry has since been renewed from the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs which saw the Bruins rally from a 4–1 third-period deficit to defeat the Maple Leafs in overtime, 5–4, and advance to the second round. In the 2018, 2019, and 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Bruins would again defeat the Maple Leafs in seven games in all three of those years.

==== Detroit Red Wings ====
The Detroit Red Wings and the Maple Leafs are both Original Six teams, playing their first game together in 1927. From 1929 to 1993, the teams met each other in the 16 playoff series, as well as seven Stanley Cup Finals. Meeting one another a combined 23 times in the postseason, they have played each other in more playoff series than any other two teams in NHL history except of the Bruins and Canadiens who have played a total of 34 playoff series. Overlapping fanbases, particularly in markets such as Windsor, Ontario, and the surrounding Essex County, have added to the rivalry.

The rivalry between the Detroit Red Wings and the Maple Leafs was at its height during the Original Six era. The Leafs and Red Wings met in the playoffs six times during the 1940s, including four Stanley Cup finals. The Leafs beat the Red Wings in five of their six meetings. In the 1950s, the Leafs and Red Wings met one another in six Stanley Cup semifinals; the Red Wings beat the Leafs in five of their six meetings. From 1961 to 1967, the two teams met one another in three playoff series, including two Stanley Cup finals. Within those 25 years, the Leafs and Red Wings played a total of 15 playoff series including six Cup Finals; the Maple Leafs beat the Red Wings in all six Cup Finals.

The teams have only met three times in the playoffs since the Original Six era, with their last meeting in 1993. After the Leafs moved to the Eastern Conference in 1998, they faced each other less often, and the rivalry began to stagnate. The rivalry became intradivisional once again in 2013 when Detroit was moved to the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference as part of a realignment.

==== Montreal Canadiens ====

The rivalry between the Montreal Canadiens and the Maple Leafs is the oldest in the NHL, featuring two clubs that were active since the inaugural NHL season in 1917. In the early 20th century, the rivalry was an embodiment of a larger culture war between English Canada and French Canada. The Canadiens have won 24 Stanley Cups, while the Maple Leafs have won 13, ranking them first and second for most Cup wins, respectively.
The height of the rivalry was during the 1960s when the Canadiens and Leafs combined to win all but one Cup. The two clubs had 15 playoff meetings. However, the rivalry has waned with the two having not met in the postseason from 1979 to 2021. It also suffered when Montreal and Toronto were placed in opposite conferences in 1981, with the Leafs in the Clarence Campbell/Western Conference and the Canadiens in the Prince of Wales/Eastern Conference. The rivalry became intradivisional once again in 1998 when the Leafs were moved into the Eastern Conference&#x27;s Northeast Division.

The rivalry&#x27;s cultural imprint may be seen in literature and art. The rivalry from the perspective of the Canadiens fan is captured in the popular Canadian short story &quot;The Hockey Sweater&quot; by Roch Carrier. Originally published in French as &quot;Une abominable feuille d&#x27;érable sur la glace&quot; (&quot;An abominable maple leaf on the ice&quot;), it referred to the Maple Leafs sweater a mother forced her son to wear. The son is presumably based on Carrier himself when he was young. This rivalry is also evident in Toronto&#x27;s subway station, which displays murals depicting the two teams, one on each platform (the Leafs mural being on the southbound platform), given that when the murals were installed in 1984, the station was the closest to the Leafs&#x27; then-home of Maple Leaf Gardens.

==== Ottawa Senators ====

The modern Ottawa Senators entered the NHL in 1992, but the rivalry between the two teams did not begin to emerge until the late 1990s. From 1992 to 1998, Ottawa and Toronto played in different conferences (Prince of Wales / Eastern and Clarence Campbell / Western respectively), which meant they rarely played each other. However, before the 1998–99 season, the conferences and divisions were realigned, with Toronto moved to the Eastern Conference&#x27;s Northeast Division with Ottawa. From 2000 to 2004, the teams played four postseason series; the Leafs won all four playoff series. Due in part to the number of Leafs fans living in the Ottawa Valley, and in part to Ottawa&#x27;s relative proximity to Toronto, Leafs–Senators games at the Canadian Tire Centre in Ottawa hold a more neutral audience.

=== Branding ===

==== Logo and uniform ====

The team is represented through several images and symbols, including the maple leaf logo found on the club&#x27;s uniform. The Maple Leafs&#x27; jersey has a long history and is one of the best-selling NHL jerseys among fans. The club&#x27;s uniforms have been altered several times. The club&#x27;s first uniforms were blue and featured the letter T. The first major alteration came in 1919 when the club was renamed the St. Patricks. The uniforms were green with &quot;Toronto St. Pats&quot; on the logo, lettered in green either on a white &quot;pill&quot; shape or stripes.

When the club was renamed the Maple Leafs in the 1927–28 season, the logo was changed, and the team reverted to blue uniforms. The logo was a 48-point maple leaf with the words lettered in white. The home jersey was blue with alternating thin-thick stripes on the arms, legs and shoulders. The road uniform was white with three stripes on the chest and back, waist and legs. For 1933–34, the alternating thin-thick stripes were replaced with stripes of equal thickness. This remained the basic design for the next 40 years. In 1937, veins were added to the leaf and &quot;Toronto&quot; curved downwards at the ends instead of upwards. In 1942, the 35-point leaf was introduced. In 1946, the logo added trimming to the leaf with a white or blue border, while &quot;C&quot; for captain and &quot;A&quot; for alternate captain first appeared on the sweaters. In 1947, the &quot;Toronto Maple Leafs&quot; lettering was in red for a short time. In 1958, a six-eyelet lace and tie were added to the neck and a blue shoulder yoke was added. In 1961, player numbers were added to the sleeves.
The fourth major change came in the 1966–67 season when the logo was changed to an 11-point leaf, similar to the leaf on the then-new flag of Canada to commemorate the Canadian Centennial. The simpler leaf logo featured the Futura Display typeface, replacing the previous block letters. The stripes on the sleeves and waistline were also changed, adding a wider stripe in between the two thinner stripes (similar to the stripe patterns on the socks and the early Leafs sweaters). Before the 1970–71 season, the Leafs adopted a new 11-point leaf logo, with a Kabel bold-font &quot;Toronto&quot; going straight across, running parallel to the other words. Other changes to the sweater included the replacement of the arm strips with an elongated yoke that extended to the ends of the sleeves, a solid single stripe on the waist replacing the three waistline stripes, two stripes on the stockings, and a smaller, textless Leaf crest on the shoulders. In 1973, the jersey&#x27;s neck was a lace tie-down design, before the V-neck returned in 1976. In 1977, the NHL rules were changed to require names on the backs of the uniforms, but Harold Ballard resisted the change. Under Ballard&#x27;s direction, the team briefly &quot;complied&quot; with the rule by placing blue letters on the blue road jersey for a game on February 26, 1978. With the NHL threatening hefty fines for failing to comply with the spirit of the rule (namely, having the names be legible for the fans and broadcasters in attendance), Ballard reached a compromise with the league, allowing the Leafs to finish the 1977–78 season with contrasting white letters on the road sweaters, and coming into full compliance with the new rule in the 1978–79 season by adding names in blue to the white home sweaters.

With the NHL&#x27;s 75th anniversary season (1991–92 season), the Leafs wore &quot;Original Six&quot; style uniforms similar to the designs used in the 1940s. Because of the fan reaction to the previous season&#x27;s classic uniforms, the first changes to the Maple Leafs uniform in over 20 years were made. The revised uniforms for 1992–93 featured two stripes on the sleeves and waistline like the classic uniform, but with the 1970 11-point leaf with Kabel text on the front. A vintage-style veined leaf crest was placed on the shoulders. The uniforms would undergo a few modifications over the years.
In 1997, Nike acquired the rights to manufacture Maple Leafs uniforms. Construction changes to the uniform included a wishbone collar and pothole mesh underarms, while the player name and number font were changed to Kabel to match the logo. CCM returned to manufacturing the Leafs uniforms in 1999 when Nike withdrew from the hockey jersey market, and kept most of the changes, although in 2000 the Kabel numbers were replaced with block numbers outlined in silver, and a silver-outlined interlocked TML monogram replaced the vintage leaf on the shoulders. Also during this time, the Leafs began wearing a white 1960s-style throwback third jersey featuring the outlined 35-point leaf, blue shoulders, and lace-up collar.

With Reebok taking over the NHL jersey contract following the 2004–05 lockout, changes were expected when the Edge uniform system was set to debut in 2007. As part of the Edge overhaul, the TML monograms were removed from the shoulders, and the silver outlines on the numbers were replaced with blue or white outlines (e.g. the blue home jersey featured white numbers with blue and white outlines, rather than blue and silver), and the waistline stripes were removed. In 2010, the two waistline stripes were restored, the vintage leaf returned to the shoulders, and the player names and numbers were changed again, reverting to a simpler single-colour block font. Finally, lace-up collars were brought back to the primary uniforms. The Leafs also brought back the 1967–1970 blue uniform, replacing the white 1960s jersey as their third uniform. For the 2014 NHL Winter Classic, the Leafs wore a sweater inspired by their earlier uniforms in the 1930s.

On February 2, 2016, the team unveiled a new logo for the 2016–17 season in honour of its centennial, dropping the use of the Kabel-style font lettering used from 1970; it returns the logo to a form inspired by the earlier designs, with 31 points to allude to the 1931 opening of Maple Leaf Gardens, and 17 veins a reference to its establishment in 1917. 13 of the veins are positioned along the top part in honour of its 13 Stanley Cup victories. The logo was subsequently accompanied by a new uniform design that was unveiled during the 2016 NHL entry draft on June 24, 2016. In addition to the new logo, the new uniforms feature a custom block typeface for the player names and numbers. Two stripes remain on the sleeves, with a single stripe at the waistline. The updated design carried over to the Adidas Adizero uniforms adopted by the NHL in 2017.

The Maple Leafs have worn historical throwback uniforms for select games, with the club wearing Toronto Arenas or St. Pats-inspired throwback designs. Additionally, the Leafs have also used contemporary &quot;historically inspired&quot; uniforms as an alternate uniform. For the Centennial Classic, each Leafs player wore a blue sweater with bold white stripes across the chest and arms; the white stripe being a tribute to the St. Pats, while a stylized-&quot;T&quot; used by the Arenas featured on their hockey pants. For the 2020–21 season, the Maple Leafs wore &quot;reverse retro&quot; alternate uniforms, which included silver stripes inspired by the uniforms used from 1970 to 1972, while using the club&#x27;s logo used from 1967 to 1970. Then for the 2022 Heritage Classic, the Maple Leafs donned a modified version of the team&#x27;s Arenas throwbacks, with blue-on-blue lettering on the &quot;Arenas&quot; wordmark as a nod to the infamous 1978 uniforms. A second &quot;reverse retro&quot; alternate uniform, featuring the blue version of the white road uniforms they wore in 1962, was released. This design added a white shoulder yoke which was absent on the original blue uniform.

Other alternate uniforms worn by the team include a white uniform with two blue stripes across the chest and arms, paired this uniform with white pants worn for the 2018 NHL Stadium Series. The uniforms were largely coloured white as a tribute to the Royal Canadian Navy and also included bolder blue outlines to create uniforms more pronounced for outdoor settings.

During the 2021–22 season, the Leafs named TikTok, a video-sharing website, as their helmet entitlement partner. Then in the 2022–23 season, the Maple Leafs announced a uniform sponsorship with the Dairy Farmers of Ontario, utilizing the organization&#x27;s &quot;Milk&quot; insignia. For the 2023–24 season, Pizza Pizza became the team&#x27;s helmet entitlement partner; however, they were only featured on the home helmets.

On March 22, 2022, the Maple Leafs unveiled a new alternate uniform, but for the first time in team history, black served as a base colour with the traditional blue serving as a trim colour. The &quot;Next Gen&quot; uniform features the team crest with a blue and black tie-dye background, along with a subtle black/blue skyline motif serving as sleeve stripes. It also comes with a reversible crest, featuring Canadian singer Justin Bieber&#x27;s modified drew house insignia inside a yellow Maple Leafs logo and yellow stripes. The black/blue front is normally worn as a game uniform.

==== Mascot ====
The Maple Leafs&#x27; mascot is Carlton the Bear, an anthropomorphic polar bear whose name and number (#60) come from the location of Maple Leaf Gardens at 60 Carlton Street, where the Leafs played throughout much of their history. Carlton made his first public appearance on July 29, 1995. He later made his regular season appearance on October 10, 1995.

=== Broadcasting ===
As a result of both Bell Canada and Rogers Communications having an ownership stake in MLSE, Maple Leafs broadcasts are split between the two media companies; with regional TV broadcasts split between Rogers&#x27; Sportsnet Ontario and Bell&#x27;s TSN4. Colour commentary for Bell&#x27;s television broadcasts is performed by Mike Johnson, while play-by-play is provided by Gord Miller. Colour commentary for Rogers&#x27; television broadcasts is performed by Craig Simpson, while play-by-play is provided by Chris Cuthbert; both also serve as the lead broadcast team of Hockey Night in Canada and Sportsnet&#x27;s national TV broadcasts. From 2001 to 2022, MLSE also operated a specialty channel, the Leafs Nation Network.

Like the Maple Leafs television broadcasts, radio broadcasts are split evenly between Rogers&#x27; CJCL (Sportsnet 590, The Fan) and Bell&#x27;s CHUM (TSN Radio 1050). Both Bell and Rogers&#x27; radio broadcasts have their colour commentary provided by Jim Ralph, with play-by-play provided by Joe Bowen.

Radio broadcasts of games played by the club were started in 1923. The first Leafs hockey game that was televised occurred on November 10, 1952; the broadcast also being the first English-language television broadcast of an NHL game in Canada. Foster Hewitt was the Leafs&#x27; first play-by-play broadcaster, providing radio play-by-play from 1927 to 1978. In addition, he provided play-by-play for television from 1952 to 1958, and colour commentary from 1958 to 1961. Originally aired over CFCA, Hewitt&#x27;s broadcast was picked up by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (the CRBC) in 1933, moving to CBC Radio (the CRBC&#x27;s successor) three years later.

=== Home arenas and practice facilities ===

The team&#x27;s first home was the Arena Gardens, later known as the Mutual Street Arena. From 1912 until 1931, the Arena was ice hockey&#x27;s premier site in Toronto. The Arena Gardens was the third arena in Canada to feature a mechanically frozen, or artificial, ice surface, and for 11 years was the only such facility in Eastern Canada. The Arena was demolished in 1989, with most of the site converted to residential developments. In 2011, parts of the site were made into a city park, known as Arena Gardens.
Within a six months in 1931, Conn Smythe built Maple Leaf Gardens on the northwest corner of Carlton Street and Church Street, for C$1.5 million (C$ million in 2025). The arena soon acquired nicknames including the &quot;Carlton Street Cashbox&quot;, and the &quot;Maple Leaf Mint&quot;, since the team&#x27;s games were constantly sold out. The Maple Leafs won 11 Stanley Cups while playing at the Gardens. The first annual NHL All-Star Game was also held at Maple Leaf Gardens in 1947. The Gardens opened on November 12, 1931, with the Maple Leafs losing 2–1 to the Chicago Blackhawks. On February 13, 1999, the Maple Leafs played their last game at the Gardens, also suffering a 6–2 loss to the Blackhawks. The building is presently used as a multi-purpose facility, with a Loblaws grocery store occupying retail space on the lower floors, Joe Fresh and LCBO occupying another floor, and an athletics arena for Ryerson University (now Toronto Metropolitan University) occupying the topmost level.

The Maple Leafs presently use two facilities in the City of Toronto. The club moved from the Gardens on February 20, 1999, to their current home arena, Air Canada Centre, later renamed Scotiabank Arena, a multi-purpose indoor entertainment arena on Bay Street in the South Core neighbourhood of Downtown Toronto. The arena is owned by the Maple Leafs&#x27; parent company MLSE and is shared with the NBA&#x27;s Toronto Raptors (another MLSE subsidiary), as well as the National Lacrosse League&#x27;s Toronto Rock. In addition to the main arena, the Maple Leafs also operate a practice facility at the Ford Performance Centre. The facility was opened in 2009 and operated by the Lakeshore Lions Club until September 2011, when the City of Toronto took over ownership of the facility after the Lions Club faced financial difficulties. The facility now operates as a City of Toronto-controlled corporation. The facility was known as the Mastercard Centre for Hockey Excellence until 2019 when it was renamed the Ford Performance Centre. The facility has three NHL rinks and one Olympic-sized rink.

On January 1, 2017, the Maple Leafs played the Detroit Red Wings in a home game at BMO Field, an outdoor multipurpose stadium at Exhibition Place, home to Leafs owner MLSE&#x27;s other teams: the Toronto FC and the Toronto Argonauts. Known as the NHL Centennial Classic, the outdoor game served as a celebration for both the centennial season of the franchise and the NHL.

=== Minor league affiliates ===
The Maple Leafs are affiliated with the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League, the Marlies play from Coca-Cola Coliseum in Toronto. The Maple Leafs&#x27; parent company has owned the Marlies franchise since 1978.
The first AHL affiliate owned by the Maple Leafs was the Rochester Americans, a team the Leafs initially co-owned with the Montreal Canadiens from 1956 to 1959, before MLGL bought out the Canadiens&#x27; share in the team. MLGL held sole ownership of the team until it was sold to an investor group in 1966. However, it continued to serve as their minor league affiliate until 1969. The Leafs did not have an AHL affiliate from 1969 to 1978 and relied on placing their drafted players with other team&#x27;s affiliates. However, after several poor draft picks and having insufficient control over their prospect&#x27;s development, MLGL opted to reestablish their own farm system; co-founding the Marlies franchise in 1978, and operating the Cincinnati Tigers of the Central Hockey League from 1981 to 1982. The Marlies were initially established as the New Brunswick Hawks, and were later relocated to St. Catherines, Newmarket, and St. John&#x27;s, before finally moving to Toronto in 2005.

The Newfoundland Growlers were the ECHL affiliate of the Maple Leafs from 2018 until 2024, they played from the Mary Brown&#x27;s Centre in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. Unlike the Marlies, the Growlers were not owned by the Leafs&#x27; parent company but were instead owned by Deacon Sports and Entertainment. The Growlers folded in 2024. The Cincinnati Cyclones signed an agreement to become the ECHL affiliate of the Maple Leafs in July 2024.

The Marlies were named after the Toronto Marlboros, a junior hockey team named after the Duke of Marlborough. Founded in 1903, the Marlboros were sponsored by the Leafs from 1927 to 1989. The Marlboros constituted one of two junior hockey teams the Leafs formerly sponsored, the other being the Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s Majors. The sponsored junior system served as the Leafs primary farm system for young replacement players from the 1940s to 1950s. Formal NHL sponsorship of junior teams ceased in 1966, making all qualifying prospects not already on NHL-sponsored lists eligible for the draft.

=== Ownership ===
The Maple Leafs is one of six professional sports teams owned by Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment (MLSE). In 2018, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated the value of the club at US$1.45 billion, making the Maple Leafs the second most valuable franchise in the NHL, after the New York Rangers. However, MLSE has refuted past valuations made by &quot;Forbes&quot;.
Initially, ownership of the club was held by the Arena Gardens of Toronto, Limited; an ownership group fronted by Henry Pellatt that owned and managed Arena Gardens. The club was named a permanent franchise in the League following its inaugural season, with team manager Charles Querrie, and the Arena Gardens treasurer Hubert Vearncombe as its owners. The Arena Company owned the club until 1919 when litigations from Eddie Livingstone forced the company to declare bankruptcy. Querrie brokered the sale of the Arena Garden&#x27;s share to the owners of the amateur St. Patricks Hockey Club. Maintaining his shares in the club, Querrie fronted the new ownership group until 1927, when the club was put up for sale. Toronto Varsity Blues coach Conn Smythe put together an ownership group and purchased the franchise for $160,000. In 1929, Smythe decided, amid the Great Depression, that the Maple Leafs needed a new arena. To finance it, Smythe launched Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL), a publicly traded management company to own both the Maple Leafs and the new arena, which was named Maple Leaf Gardens. Smythe traded his stake in the Leafs for shares in MLGL and sold shares in the holding company to the public to help fund construction for the arena.

Although Smythe was the face of MLGL from its founding, he did not gain a controlling interest in the company until 1947. Smythe remained MLGL&#x27;s principal owner until 1961 when he sold 90 percent of his shares to an ownership group consisting of Harold Ballard, John W. H. Bassett and Stafford Smythe. Ballard became majority owner in February 1972 shortly following the death of Stafford Smythe. Ballard was the principal owner of MLGL until he died in 1990. The company remained a publicly traded company until 1998, when an ownership group fronted by Steve Stavro privatized the company by acquiring more than the 90 percent of stock necessary to force objecting shareholders out.

While initially primarily a hockey company, with ownership stakes in several junior hockey clubs including the Toronto Marlboros of the Ontario Hockey Association, the company later branched out to own the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League from the late 1970s to late 1980s (though the company would later sell off the Tiger-Cats). On February 12, 1998, MLGL purchased the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association, who were constructing the then–Air Canada Centre. After MLGL acquired the Raptors, the company changed its name to MLSE. The company&#x27;s portfolio has since expanded to include the Toronto FC of Major League Soccer, the Toronto Marlies of the AHL, the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, and a 37.5 percent stake in Maple Leaf Square.

The present ownership structure emerged in 2012 after the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan (the company&#x27;s former principal owner) announced the sale of its 75 percent stake in MLSE to a consortium made up of telecommunications rivals Bell Canada and Rogers Communications, in a deal valued at $1.32 billion. As part of the sale, two numbered companies were created to jointly hold stock. This ownership structure ensures that, at the shareholder level, Rogers and Bell vote their overall 75 percent interest in the company together and thus decisions on the management of the company must be made by consensus between the two. A portion of Bell&#x27;s share in MLSE is owned by its pension fund, to make Bell&#x27;s share in MLSE under 30 percent. This was done so that Bell could retain its existing 18 percent interest in the Montreal Canadiens; as NHL&#x27;s conflict of interest rules prevent any shareholder that owns more than 30 percent of a team from holding an ownership position in another. The remaining 25 percent is owned by Larry Tanenbaum, who is also the chairman of MLSE.

=== Current roster ===
=== Team captains ===
In all, 25 individuals have served as captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Ken Randall served as the team&#x27;s first captain for two years beginning with the inaugural 1917–18 NHL season. John Ross Roach was the first goaltender to be named captain in the NHL, and the only goaltender to serve as the Leafs&#x27; captain. He was one of only six goalies in NHL history to have been officially recognized as the team captain. George Armstrong served as captain from 1958 through 1969 and was the longest-serving captain in the team&#x27;s history. In 1997, Mats Sundin became the first non-Canadian to captain the Maple Leafs. His tenure as captain holds the distinction as the longest captaincy for a non-North American-born player in NHL history. The last player named to the position was Auston Matthews on August 14, 2024.

Three captains of the Maple Leafs have held the position at multiple points in their careers. Syl Apps&#x27; first tenure as the captain began from 1940 to 1943, before he stepped down and left the club to enlist in the Canadian Army. Bob Davidson served as the Maple Leafs captain until Apps&#x27; return from the Army in 1945 and resumed his captaincy until 1948. Ted Kennedy&#x27;s first tenure as captain was from 1948 to 1955. He announced his retirement from the sport at the end of the 1954–55 season, with Sid Smith succeeding him as captain. Although Kennedy missed the entire 1955–56 season, he came out of retirement to play the second half of the 1956–57 season. During that half-season, Kennedy served his second tenure as the Maple Leafs&#x27; captain. Darryl Sittler was the third player to have been named the team&#x27;s captain twice. As a result of a dispute between Sittler and the Maple Leafs&#x27; general manager Punch Imlach, Sittler relinquished the captaincy on December 29, 1979. The dispute was resolved in the following off-season after a heart attack hospitalized Imlach. Sittler arranged talks with Ballard to resolve the issue, eventually resuming his captaincy on September 24, 1980. No replacement captain was named during the interim period.

=== Head coaches ===
The Maple Leafs have had 41 head coaches (including four interim coaches). The franchise&#x27;s first head coach was Dick Carroll, who coached the team for two seasons. Several coaches have served as the Leafs head coach on multiple occasions. King Clancy was named the head coach on three occasions while Charles Querrie and Punch Imlach served the position on two occasions. Craig Berube is the current head coach. He was named coach on May 17, 2024.

Punch Imlach coached the most regular season games of any Leafs&#x27; head coach with 770 games, and has the most all-time points with the Maple Leafs, with 865. He is followed by Pat Quinn, who coached 574 games, with 678 points all-time with the Maple Leafs. Both Mike Rodden and Dick Duff, have the fewest points with the Maple Leafs, with 0. Both were interim coaches who coached only two games each in 1927 and 1980 respectively, losing both games. Sheldon Keefe earned the most points of any Leafs head coach in a single season, with 115 points during the 2021–22 season. Five Maple Leafs&#x27; coaches have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as players, while four others were inducted as builders. Pat Burns is the only Leafs&#x27; head coach to win a Jack Adams Award with the team.

=== Draft picks ===

In the 1963 NHL amateur draft, the NHL&#x27;s inaugural draft, the Maple Leafs selected Walt McKechnie, a centre from the London Nationals with their first pick, sixth overall. Two Maple Leafs captains were obtained through the draft, Darryl Sittler in the 1970 draft; as well as Wendel Clark in the 1985 draft. The Maple Leafs have drafted two players with a first overall draft pick; Clark in the 1985 draft, and Auston Matthews in the 2016 draft. Other notable Maple Leafs draft picks and current players with the team are defenceman Morgan Rielly (fifth overall, 2012), and wingers William Nylander and Mitch Marner (eighth and fourth overall in 2014 and 2015 respectively). The team&#x27;s most recent first round selection was Easton Cowan, at 28th overall in the 2023 draft.

===Announcers===
The Toronto Maple Leafs have had four PA announcers in their history. In addition Harold (Hap) Watson was the Toronto Arenas&#x27; announcer in 1929 before the team moved to Maple Leaf Gardens and became the Toronto Maple Leafs.
* Walter (Red) Barber (1931–1961)

== Team and league honours ==

The Maple Leafs have won 13 Stanley Cups in its history. Toronto&#x27;s first two Stanley Cups, in 1918 and 1922, took place when the Stanley Cup tournament operated as an interleague competition. Toronto&#x27;s subsequent 11 Stanley Cups were awarded after 1926 when the Cup was established as the championship trophy of the NHL. The Maple Leafs won their last Stanley Cup in 1967; with the team&#x27;s 55-season Stanley Cup drought being the longest championship drought in the NHL. The Maple Leafs were also awarded the Prince of Wales Trophy twice, following the 1946–47 season, and the 1962–63 season. The Prince of Wales Trophy was awarded to the club when it was used as NHL&#x27;s regular season championship trophy.

=== Retired numbers ===
The Maple Leafs have retired the numbers of 19 players; as some players used the same number, only 13 numbers have been retired. Between October 17, 1992, and October 15, 2016, the Maple Leafs took a unique approach to retired numbers. Whereas players who suffered a career-ending injury had their numbers retired, &quot;great&quot; players had their number &quot;honoured&quot;. Honoured numbers remained in general circulation for players, however, during Brian Burke&#x27;s tenure as the Maple Leafs&#x27; general manager, the use of honoured numbers required his approval.

During this period, only two players met the criteria for retirement, the first being number 6, worn by Ace Bailey and retired on February 14, 1934; and Bill Barilko&#x27;s number 5, retired on October 17, 1992. The retirement of Bailey&#x27;s number was the first of its kind in professional sports. It was briefly taken out of retirement after Bailey asked that Ron Ellis be allowed to wear his number. Bailey&#x27;s number returned to retirement after Ellis&#x27;s final game on January 14, 1981.

The first players to have their numbers honoured were Syl Apps and Ted Kennedy, on October 3, 1993. Mats Sundin was the last player to have his number honoured on February 11, 2012. On October 15, 2016, before the home opening game of the team&#x27;s centenary season, the Maple Leafs announced they had changed their philosophy on retiring numbers, and that the numbers of those 16 honoured players would now be retired, in addition to the retirement of Dave Keon&#x27;s number.

As well as honouring and retiring the numbers, the club also commissioned statues of former Maple Leafs. The group of statues, known as Legends Row, is a granite hockey bench with statues of former club players. Unveiled in September 2014, it is located outside Gate 5 of Scotiabank Arena, at Maple Leaf Square. As of October 2017, statues have been made of 14 players with retired numbers.
In addition to the 13 numbers retired by the Maple Leafs, the number 99 is also retired from use in the organization. At the 2000 NHL All-Star Game hosted in Toronto, the NHL announced the league-wide retirement of Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s number 99, retiring it from use throughout all its member teams, including the Maple Leafs.

=== Hall of Fame ===
The Toronto Maple Leafs acknowledge an affiliation with 76 inductees of the Hockey Hall of Fame, including 62 former players as well as 13 builders of the sport. The Maple Leafs have the greatest number of players inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame of any NHL team. The 13 individuals recognized as builders of the sport include former Maple Leafs broadcasters, executives, head coaches, and other personnel relating to the club&#x27;s operations. Inducted in 2017, Dave Andreychuk was the latest Maple Leafs player to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

In addition to players and builders, five broadcasters for the Maple Leafs were also awarded the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1984, radio broadcaster Foster Hewitt was awarded the Hall of Fame&#x27;s inaugural Foster Hewitt Memorial Award, an award named after him. Before the award&#x27;s creation, Hewitt had already been inducted as a builder into the Hall of Fame. Other Maple Leafs broadcasters that received the award include Wes McKnight in 1986, Bob Cole in 2007, Bill Hewitt in 2007 and Joe Bowen in 2018.

<doc id="70157" wikidata="Q132580" url="?curid=70157" title="Recycling">
<text>Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. This concept often includes the recovery of energy from waste materials. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to &quot;conventional&quot; waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions. It can also prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, reducing energy use, air pollution (from incineration) and water pollution (from landfilling).

Recycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third component of the &quot;Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle&quot; waste hierarchy. It promotes environmental sustainability by removing raw material input and redirecting waste output in the economic system. There are some ISO standards related to recycling, such as ISO 15270:2008 for plastics waste and ISO 14001:2015 for environmental management control of recycling practice.

&quot;Recyclable materials&quot; include many kinds of glass, paper, cardboard, metal, plastic, tires, textiles, batteries, and electronics. The composting and other reuse of biodegradable waste—such as food and garden waste—is also a form of recycling. Materials for recycling are either delivered to a household recycling center or picked up from curbside bins, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials for manufacturing new products.

In ideal implementations, recycling a material produces a fresh supply of the same material—for example, used office paper would be converted into new office paper, and used polystyrene foam into new polystyrene. Some types of materials, such as metal cans, can be remanufactured repeatedly without losing their purity. With other materials, this is often difficult or too expensive (compared with producing the same product from raw materials or other sources), so &quot;recycling&quot; of many products and materials involves their &quot;reuse&quot; in producing different materials (for example, paperboard). Another form of recycling is the salvage of constituent materials from complex products, due to either their intrinsic value (such as lead from car batteries and gold from printed circuit boards), or their hazardous nature (e.g. removal and reuse of mercury from thermometers and thermostats).

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Reusing materials has been a common practice for most of human history with recorded advocates as far back as Plato in the fourth century BC. During periods when resources were scarce, archaeological studies of ancient waste dumps show less household waste (such as ash, broken tools, and pottery), implying that more waste was recycled in place of new material. However, archaeological artefacts made from recyclable material, such as glass or metal, may neither be the original object nor resemble it, with the consequence that a successful ancient recycling economy can become invisible when recycling is synonymous with re-melting rather than reuse.
In pre-industrial times, there is evidence of scrap bronze and other metals being collected in Europe and melted down for continuous reuse. Paper recycling was first recorded in 1031 when Japanese shops sold repulped paper. In Britain dust and ash from wood and coal fires was collected by &quot;dustmen&quot; and downcycled as a base material for brick making. These forms of recycling were driven by the economic advantage of obtaining recycled materials instead of virgin material, and the need for waste removal in ever-more-densely populated areas. In 1813, Benjamin Law developed the process of turning rags into &quot;shoddy&quot; and &quot;mungo&quot; wool in Batley, Yorkshire, which combined recycled fibers with virgin wool. The West Yorkshire shoddy industry in towns such as Batley and Dewsbury lasted from the early 19th century to at least 1914.

Industrialization spurred demand for affordable materials. In addition to rags, ferrous scrap metals were coveted as they were cheaper to acquire than virgin ore. Railroads purchased and sold scrap metal in the 19th century, and the growing steel and automobile industries purchased scrap in the early 20th century. Many secondary goods were collected, processed and sold by peddlers who scoured dumps and city streets for discarded machinery, pots, pans, and other sources of metal. By World War I, thousands of such peddlers roamed the streets of American cities, taking advantage of market forces to recycle post-consumer materials into industrial production.

Manufacturers of beverage bottles, including Schweppes, began offering refundable recycling deposits in Great Britain and Ireland around 1800. An official recycling system with refundable deposits for bottles was established in Sweden in 1884, and for aluminum beverage cans in 1982; it led to recycling rates of 84–99%, depending on type (glass bottles can be refilled around 20 times).

=== Wartime ===


New chemical industries created in the late 19th century both invented new materials (e.g. Bakelite in 1907) and promised to transform valueless into valuable materials. Proverbially, you could not —until the US firm Arthur D. Little published in 1921 &quot;On the Making of Silk Purses from Sows&#x27; Ears&quot;, its research proving that when &quot;chemistry puts on overalls and gets down to business [...] new values appear. New and better paths are opened to reach the goals desired.&quot;

Recycling—or &quot;salvage&quot;, as it was then usually known—was a major issue for governments during World War II, where financial constraints and significant material shortages made it necessary to reuse goods and recycle materials. These resource shortages caused by the world wars, and other such world-changing events, greatly encouraged recycling. It became necessary for most homes to recycle their waste, allowing people to make the most of what was available. Recycling household materials also meant more resources were left available for war efforts. Massive government campaigns, such as the National Salvage Campaign in Britain and the Salvage for Victory campaign in the United States, occurred in every fighting nation, urging citizens to donate metal, paper, rags, and rubber as a patriotic duty.

=== Post-World War II ===
A considerable investment in recycling occurred in the 1970s due to rising energy costs. Recycling aluminium uses only 5% of the energy of virgin production. Glass, paper and other metals have less dramatic but significant energy savings when recycled.

Although consumer electronics have been popular since the 1920s, recycling them was almost unheard of until early 1991. The first electronic waste recycling scheme was implemented in Switzerland, beginning with collection of old refrigerators, then expanding to cover all devices. When these programs were created, many countries could not deal with the sheer quantity of e-waste, or its hazardous nature, and began to export the problem to developing countries without enforced environmental legislation. (For example, recycling computer monitors in the United States costs 10 times more than in China.) Demand for electronic waste in Asia began to grow when scrapyards found they could extract valuable substances such as copper, silver, iron, silicon, nickel, and gold during the recycling process. The 2000s saw a boom in both the sales of electronic devices and their growth as a waste stream: In 2002, e-waste grew faster than any other type of waste in the EU. This spurred investment in modern automated facilities to cope with the influx, especially after strict laws were implemented in 2003.

As of 2014, the European Union had about 50% of world share of waste and recycling industries, with over companies employing people and a turnover of €24 billion. EU countries are mandated to reach recycling rates of at least 50%; leading countries are already at around 65%. The overall EU average was 39% in 2013
and is rising steadily, to 45% in 2015.

In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly set 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Goal 12, Responsible Consumption and Production, specifies 11 targets &quot;to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns&quot;. The fifth target, Target 12.5, is defined as substantially reducing waste generation by 2030, indicated by the National Recycling Rate.

In 2018, changes in the recycling industry have sparked a global &quot;crisis&quot;. On 31 December 2017, China announced its &quot;National Sword&quot; policy, setting new standards for imports of recyclable material and banning materials deemed too &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;hazardous&quot;. The new policy caused drastic disruptions in the global recycling market, and reduced the prices of scrap plastic and low-grade paper. Exports of recyclable materials from G7 countries to China dropped dramatically, with many shifting to countries in southeast Asia. This generated significant concern about the recycling industry&#x27;s practices and environmental sustainability. The abrupt shift caused countries to accept more materials than they could process, and raised fundamental questions about shipping waste from developed countries to countries with few environmental regulations—a practice that predated the crisis.

== Health and environmental impact ==

=== Health impact ===
==== E-waste ====
According to the WHO (2023), “Every year millions of electrical and electronic devices are discarded ... a threat to the environment and to human health if they are not treated, disposed of, and recycled appropriately. Common items ... include computers ... e-waste are recycled using environmentally unsound techniques and are likely stored in homes and warehouses, dumped, exported or recycled under inferior conditions. When e-waste is treated using inferior activities, it can release as many as 1000 different chemical substances ... including harmful neurotoxicants such as lead.” A paper in the journal &quot;Sustainable Materials &amp; Technologies&quot; remarks upon the difficulty of managing e-waste, particularly from home automation products, which, due to their becoming obsolete at a high rate, are putting increasing strain on recycling systems, which have not adapted to meet the recycling needs posed by this type of product.

==== Slag recycling ====
Copper slag is obtained when copper and nickel ores are recovered from their source ores using a pyrometallurgical process, and these ores usually contain other elements which include iron, cobalt, silica, and alumina. An estimate of 2.2–3 tons of copper slag is generated per ton of copper produced, resulting in around 24.6 tons of slag per year, which is regarded as waste.

Environmental impact of slag include copper paralysis, which leads to death due to gastric hemorrhage, if ingested by humans. It may also cause acute dermatitis upon skin exposure. Toxicity may also be uptaken by crops through soil, consequently spreading animals and food sources and increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, cognitive impairment, chronic anemia, and damage to kidneys, bones, nervous system, brain and skin.

Substituting gravel and grit in quarries has been more cost-effective, due to having its sources with better proximity to consumer markets. Trading between countries and establishment of blast furnaces is helping increase slag utilization, hence reducing wastage and pollution.

==== Concrete recycling ====

=== Environmental impact ===
Economist Steven Landsburg, author of a paper entitled &quot;Why I Am Not an Environmentalist&quot;, claimed that paper recycling actually reduces tree populations. He argues that because paper companies have incentives to replenish their forests, large demands for paper lead to large forests while reduced demand for paper leads to fewer &quot;farmed&quot; forests.

When foresting companies cut down trees, more are planted in their place; however, such farmed forests are inferior to natural forests in several ways. Farmed forests are not able to fix the soil as quickly as natural forests. This can cause widespread soil erosion and often requiring large amounts of fertilizer to maintain the soil, while containing little tree and wild-life biodiversity compared to virgin forests. Also, the new trees planted are not as big as the trees that were cut down, and the argument that there would be &quot;more trees&quot; is not compelling to forestry advocates when they are counting saplings.

In particular, wood from tropical rainforests is rarely harvested for paper because of their heterogeneity. According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat, the overwhelming direct cause of deforestation is subsistence farming (48% of deforestation) and commercial agriculture (32%), which is linked to food, not paper production.

Other non-conventional methods of material recycling, like Waste-to-Energy (WTE) systems, have garnered increased attention in the recent past due to the polarizing nature of their emissions. While viewed as a sustainable method of capturing energy from material waste feedstocks by many, others have cited numerous explanations for why the technology has not been scaled globally.

== Legislation ==

=== Supply ===
For a recycling program to work, a large, stable supply of recyclable material is crucial. Three legislative options have been used to create such supplies: mandatory recycling collection, container deposit legislation, and refuse bans. Mandatory collection laws set recycling targets for cities, usually in the form that a certain percentage of a material must be diverted from the city&#x27;s waste stream by a target date. The city is responsible for working to meet this target.

Container deposit legislation mandates refunds for the return of certain containers—typically glass, plastic and metal. When a product in such a container is purchased, a small surcharge is added that the consumer can reclaim when the container is returned to a collection point. These programs have succeeded in creating an average 80% recycling rate. Despite such good results, the shift in collection costs from local government to industry and consumers has created strong opposition in some areas—for example, where manufacturers bear the responsibility for recycling their products. In the European Union, the WEEE Directive requires producers of consumer electronics to reimburse the recyclers&#x27; costs.

An alternative way to increase the supply of recyclates is to ban the disposal of certain materials as waste, often including used oil, old batteries, tires, and garden waste. This can create a viable economy for the proper disposal of the products. Care must be taken that enough recycling services exist to meet the supply, or such bans can create increased illegal dumping.

=== Government-mandated demand ===
Four forms of legislation have also been used to increase and maintain the demand for recycled materials: minimum recycled content mandates, utilization rates, procurement policies, and recycled product labeling.

Both minimum recycled content mandates and utilization rates increase demand by forcing manufacturers to include recycling in their operations. Content mandates specify that a certain percentage of a new product must consist of recycled material. Utilization rates are a more flexible option: Industries can meet their recycling targets at any point of their operations, or even contract out recycling in exchange for tradable credits. Opponents to these methods cite their large increase in reporting requirements, and claim that they rob the industry of flexibility.

Governments have used their own purchasing power to increase recycling demand through &quot;procurement policies&quot;. These policies are either &quot;set-asides&quot;, which reserve a certain amount of spending for recycled products; or &quot;price preference&quot; programs that provide larger budgets when recycled items are purchased. Additional regulations can target specific cases: in the United States, for example, the Environmental Protection Agency mandates the purchase of oil, paper, tires and building insulation from recycled or re-refined sources whenever possible.

The final government regulation toward increased demand is recycled product labeling. When producers are required to label their packaging with the amount of recycled material it contains (including the packaging), consumers can make more educated choices. Consumers with sufficient buying power can choose more environmentally conscious options, prompting producers to increase the recycled material in their products and increase demand. Standardized recycling labeling can also have a positive effect on the supply of recyclates when it specifies how and where the product can be recycled.

== Recyclates ==
&quot;Recyclate&quot; is a raw material sent to and processed in a waste recycling plant or materials-recovery facility so it can be used in the production of new materials and products. For example, plastic bottles can be made into plastic pellets and synthetic fabrics.

=== Quality of recyclate ===
The quality of recyclates is one of the principal challenges for the success of a long-term vision of a green economy and achieving zero waste. It generally refers to how much of it is composed of target material, versus non-target material and other non-recyclable material. Steel and other metals have intrinsically higher recyclate quality; it is estimated that two-thirds of all new steel comes from recycled steel. Only target material is likely to be recycled, so higher amounts of non-target and non-recyclable materials can reduce the quantity of recycled products. A high proportion of non-target and non-recyclable material can make it more difficult to achieve &quot;high-quality&quot; recycling; and if recyclate is of poor quality, it is more likely to end up being down-cycled or, in more extreme cases, sent to other recovery options or landfilled. For example, to facilitate the remanufacturing of clear glass products, there are tight restrictions for colored glass entering the re-melt process. Another example is the downcycling of plastic, where products such as plastic food packaging are often downcycled into lower quality products, and do not get recycled into the same plastic food packaging.

The quality of recyclate not only supports high-quality recycling, but it can also deliver significant environmental benefits by reducing, reusing, and keeping products out of landfills. High-quality recycling can support economic growth by maximizing the value of waste material. Higher income levels from the sale of quality recyclates can return value significant to local governments, households and businesses. Pursuing high-quality recycling can also promote consumer and business confidence in the waste and resource management sector, and may encourage investment in it.

There are many actions along the recycling supply chain, each of which can affect recyclate quality. Waste producers who place non-target and non-recyclable wastes in recycling collections can affect the quality of final recyclate streams, and require extra efforts to discard those materials at later stages in the recycling process. Different collection systems can induce different levels of contamination. When multiple materials are collected together, extra effort is required to sort them into separate streams and can significantly reduce the quality of the final products. Transportation and the compaction of materials can also make this more difficult. Despite improvements in technology and quality of recyclate, sorting facilities are still not 100% effective in separating materials. When materials are stored outside, where they can become wet, can also cause problems for re-processors. Further sorting steps may be required to satisfactorily reduce the amount of non-target and non-recyclable material.

== Recycling consumer waste ==

=== Collection ===
A number of systems have been implemented to collect recyclates from the general waste stream, occupying different places on the spectrum of trade-off between public convenience and government ease and expense. The three main categories of collection are drop-off centers, buy-back centers and curbside collection. About two-thirds of the cost of recycling is incurred in the collection phase.

==== Curbside collection ====


Curbside collection encompasses many subtly different systems, which differ mostly on where in the process the recyclates are sorted and cleaned. The main categories are mixed waste collection, commingled recyclables, and source separation. A waste collection vehicle generally picks up the waste.

In mixed waste collection, recyclates are collected mixed with the rest of the waste, and the desired materials are sorted out and cleaned at a central sorting facility. This results in a large amount of recyclable waste (especially paper) being too soiled to reprocess, but has advantages as well: The city need not pay for the separate collection of recyclates, no public education is needed, and any changes to the recyclability of certain materials are implemented where sorting occurs.

In a commingled or single-stream system, recyclables are mixed but kept separate from non-recyclable waste. This greatly reduces the need for post-collection cleaning, but requires public education on what materials are recyclable.

=====Source separation=====
Source separation is the other extreme, where each material is cleaned and sorted prior to collection. It requires the least post-collection sorting and produces the purest recyclates. However, it incurs additional operating costs for collecting each material, and requires extensive public education to avoid recyclate contamination. In Oregon, USA, Oregon DEQ surveyed multi-family property managers; about half of them reported problems, including contamination of recyclables due to trespassers such as transients gaining access to collection areas.

Source separation used to be the preferred method due to the high cost of sorting commingled (mixed waste) collection. However, advances in sorting technology have substantially lowered this overhead, and many areas that had developed source separation programs have switched to what is called &quot;co-mingled collection&quot;.

==== Buy-back centers ====

At buy-back centers, separated, cleaned recyclates are purchased, providing a clear incentive for use and creating a stable supply. The post-processed material can then be sold. If profitable, this conserves the emission of greenhouse gases; if unprofitable, it increases their emission. Buy-back centres generally need government subsidies to be viable. According to a 1993 report by the U.S. National Waste &amp; Recycling Association, it costs an average $50 to process a ton of material that can be resold for $30.

==== Drop-off centers ====

Drop-off centers require the waste producer to carry recyclates to a central location—either an installed or mobile collection station or the reprocessing plant itself. They are the easiest type of collection to establish but suffer from low and unpredictable throughput.

==== Distributed recycling ====
For some waste materials such as plastic, recent technical devices called recyclebots enable a form of distributed recycling called DRAM (distributed recycling additive manufacturing). Preliminary life-cycle analysis (LCA) indicates that such distributed recycling of HDPE to make filament for 3D printers in rural regions consumes less energy than using virgin resin, or using conventional recycling processes with their associated transportation.

Another form of distributed recycling mixes waste plastic with sand to make bricks in Africa. Several studies have looked at the properties of recycled waste plastic and sand bricks. The composite pavers can be sold at 100% profit while employing workers at 1.5× the minimum wage in the West African region, where distributed recycling has the potential to produce 19 million pavement tiles from 28,000 tons of plastic water sachets annually in Ghana, Nigeria, and Liberia. This has also been done with COVID19 masks.

=== Sorting ===
Once commingled recyclates are collected and delivered to a materials recovery facility, the materials must be sorted. This is done in a series of stages, many of which involve automated processes, enabling a truckload of material to be fully sorted in less than an hour. Some plants can now sort materials automatically; this is known as single-stream recycling. Automatic sorting may be aided by robotics and machine learning. In plants, a variety of materials is sorted including paper, different types of plastics, glass, metals, food scraps, and most types of batteries. A 30% increase in recycling rates has been seen in areas with these plants. In the US, there are over 300 materials recovery facilities.

Initially, commingled recyclates are removed from the collection vehicle and placed on a conveyor belt spread out in a single layer. Large pieces of corrugated fiberboard and plastic bags are removed by hand at this stage, as they can cause later machinery to jam.

Next, automated machinery such as disk screens and air classifiers separate the recyclates by weight, splitting lighter paper and plastic from heavier glass and metal. Cardboard is removed from mixed paper, and the most common types of plastic—PET (#1) and HDPE (#2)—are collected, so these materials can be diverted into the proper collection channels. This is usually done by hand; but in some sorting centers, spectroscopic scanners are used to differentiate between types of paper and plastic based on their absorbed wavelengths. Plastics tend to be incompatible with each other due to differences in chemical composition; their polymer molecules repel each other, similar to oil and water.

Strong magnets are used to separate out ferrous metals such as iron, steel and tin cans. Non-ferrous metals are ejected by magnetic eddy currents: A rotating magnetic field induces an electric current around aluminum cans, creating an eddy current inside the cans that is repulsed by a large magnetic field, ejecting the cans from the stream.

Finally, glass is sorted according to its color: brown, amber, green, or clear. It may be sorted either by hand, or by a machine that uses colored filters to detect colors. Glass fragments smaller than cannot be sorted automatically, and are mixed together as &quot;glass fines&quot;.

In 2003, San Francisco&#x27;s Department of the Environment set a citywide goal of zero waste by 2020. San Francisco&#x27;s refuse hauler, Recology, operates an effective recyclables sorting facility that has helped the city reach a record-breaking landfill diversion rate of 80% as of 2021. Other American cities, including Los Angeles, have achieved similar rates.

== Recycling industrial waste ==
Although many government programs concentrate on recycling at home, 64% of waste in the United Kingdom is generated by industry. The focus of many recycling programs in industry is their cost-effectiveness. The ubiquitous nature of cardboard packaging makes cardboard a common waste product recycled by companies that deal heavily in packaged goods, such as retail stores, warehouses, and goods distributors. Other industries deal in niche and specialized products, depending on the waste materials they handle.

Glass, lumber, wood pulp and paper manufacturers all deal directly in commonly recycled materials; however, independent tire dealers may collect and recycle rubber tires for a profit.

The waste produced from burning coal in a Coal-fired power station is often called fuel ash or fly ash in the United States. It is a very useful material and used in concrete construction. It exhibits Pozzolanic activity.

Levels of metals recycling are generally low. In 2010, the International Resource Panel, hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), published reports on metal stocks and their recycling rates. It reported that the increase in the use of metals during the 20th and into the 21st century has led to a substantial shift in metal stocks from below-ground to use in above-ground applications within society. For example, in the US, in-use copper grew from 73 to 238 kg per capita between 1932–1999.

The report&#x27;s authors observed that, as metals are inherently recyclable, metal stocks in society can serve as huge above-ground mines (the term &quot;urban mining&quot; has thus been coined). However, they found that the recycling rates of many metals are low. They warned that the recycling rates of some rare metals used in applications such as mobile phones, battery packs for hybrid cars and fuel cells, are so low that unless future end-of-life recycling rates are dramatically increased, these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology.

The military recycles some metals. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s Ship Disposal Program uses ship breaking to reclaim the steel of old vessels. Ships may also be sunk to create artificial reefs. Uranium is a dense metal that has qualities superior to lead and titanium for many military and industrial uses. Uranium left over from processing it into nuclear weapons and fuel for nuclear reactors is called depleted uranium, and is used by all branches of the U.S. military for the development of such things as armor-piercing shells and shielding.

The construction industry may recycle concrete and old road surface pavement, selling these materials for profit.

Some rapidly growing industries, particularly the renewable energy and solar photovoltaic technology industries, are proactively creating recycling policies even before their waste streams have considerable volume, anticipating future demand.

Recycling of plastics is more difficult, as most programs are not able to reach the necessary level of quality. Recycling of PVC often results in downcycling of the material, which means only products of lower quality standard can be made with the recycled material.

E-waste is a growing problem, accounting for 20–50 million metric tons of global waste per year according to the EPA. It is also the fastest growing waste stream in the EU. Many recyclers do not recycle e-waste responsibly. After the cargo barge Khian Sea dumped 14,000 metric tons of toxic ash in Haiti, the Basel Convention was formed to stem the flow of hazardous substances into poorer countries. They created the e-Stewards certification to ensure that recyclers are held to the highest standards for environmental responsibility and to help consumers identify responsible recyclers. It operates alongside other prominent legislation, such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive of the EU and the United States National Computer Recycling Act, to prevent poisonous chemicals from entering waterways and the atmosphere.

In the recycling process, television sets, monitors, cell phones, and computers are typically tested for reuse and repaired. If broken, they may be disassembled for parts still having high value if labor is cheap enough. Other e-waste is shredded to pieces roughly in size and manually checked to separate toxic batteries and capacitors, which contain poisonous metals. The remaining pieces are further shredded to particles and passed under a magnet to remove ferrous metals. An eddy current ejects non-ferrous metals, which are sorted by density either by a centrifuge or vibrating plates. Precious metals can be dissolved in acid, sorted, and smelted into ingots. The remaining glass and plastic fractions are separated by density and sold to re-processors. Television sets and monitors must be manually disassembled to remove lead from CRTs and the mercury backlight from LCDs.

Vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines can also be recycled. They often contain rare-earth elements (REE) and/or other critical raw materials. For electric car production, large amounts of REE&#x27;s are typically required.

Whereas many critical raw elements and REE&#x27;s can be recovered, environmental engineer Phillipe Bihouix reports that recycling of indium, gallium, germanium, selenium, and tantalum is still very difficult and their recycling rates are very low.

=== Plastic recycling ===


Plastic recycling is the process of recovering scrap or waste plastic and reprocessing the material into useful products, sometimes completely different in form from their original state. For instance, this could mean melting down soft drink bottles and then casting them as plastic chairs and tables. For some types of plastic, the same piece of plastic can only be recycled about 2–3 times before its quality decreases to the point where it can no longer be used.

==== Physical recycling ====
Some plastics are remelted to form new plastic objects; for example, PET water bottles can be converted into polyester destined for clothing. A disadvantage of this type of recycling is that the molecular weight of the polymer can change further and the levels of unwanted substances in the plastic can increase with each remelt.

A commercial-built recycling facility was sent to the International Space Station in late 2019. The facility takes in plastic waste and unneeded plastic parts and physically converts them into spools of feedstock for the space station additive manufacturing facility used for in-space 3D printing.

==== Chemical recycling ====
For some polymers, it is possible to convert them back into monomers, for example, PET can be treated with an alcohol and a catalyst to form a dialkyl terephthalate. The terephthalate diester can be used with ethylene glycol to form a new polyester polymer, thus making it possible to use the pure polymer again. In 2019, Eastman Chemical Company announced initiatives of methanolysis and syngas designed to handle a greater variety of used material.

==== Waste plastic pyrolysis to fuel oil ====
Another process involves the conversion of assorted polymers into petroleum by a much less precise thermal depolymerization process. Such a process would be able to accept almost any polymer or mix of polymers, including thermoset materials such as vulcanized rubber tires and the biopolymers in feathers and other agricultural waste. Like natural petroleum, the chemicals produced can be used as fuels or as feedstock. A RESEM Technology plant of this type in Carthage, Missouri, US, uses turkey waste as input material. Gasification is a similar process but is not technically recycling since polymers are not likely to become the result.
Plastic Pyrolysis can convert petroleum based waste streams such as plastics into quality fuels, carbons. Given below is the list of suitable plastic raw materials for pyrolysis:
* Mixed plastic (HDPE, LDPE, PE, PP, Nylon, Teflon, PS, ABS, FRP, PET etc.)
* Mixed waste plastic from waste paper mill
* Multi-layered plastic

== Recycling codes ==


In order to meet recyclers&#x27; needs while providing manufacturers a consistent, uniform system, a coding system was developed. The recycling code for plastics was introduced in 1988 by the plastics industry through the Society of the Plastics Industry. Because municipal recycling programs traditionally have targeted packaging—primarily bottles and containers—the resin coding system offered a means of identifying the resin content of bottles and containers commonly found in the residential waste stream.

In the United States, plastic products are printed with numbers 1–7 depending on the type of resin. Type 1 (polyethylene terephthalate) is commonly found in soft drink and water bottles. Type 2 (high-density polyethylene) is found in most hard plastics such as milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles, and some dishware. Type 3 (polyvinyl chloride) includes items such as shampoo bottles, shower curtains, hula hoops, credit cards, wire jacketing, medical equipment, siding, and piping. Type 4 (low-density polyethylene) is found in shopping bags, squeezable bottles, tote bags, clothing, furniture, and carpet. Type 5 is polypropylene and makes up syrup bottles, straws, Tupperware, and some automotive parts. Type 6 is polystyrene and makes up meat trays, egg cartons, clamshell containers, and compact disc cases. Type 7 includes all other plastics such as bulletproof materials, 3- and 5-gallon water bottles, cell phone and tablet frames, safety goggles and sunglasses. Having a recycling code or the chasing arrows logo on a material is not an automatic indicator that a material is recyclable but rather an explanation of what the material is. Types 1 and 2 are the most commonly recycled.

== Cost–benefit analysis ==

In addition to environmental impact, there is debate over whether recycling is economically efficient. According to a Natural Resources Defense Council study, waste collection and landfill disposal creates less than one job per 1,000 tons of waste material managed; in contrast, the collection, processing, and manufacturing of recycled materials creates 6–13 or more jobs per 1,000 tons. According to the U.S. Recycling Economic Informational Study, there are over 50,000 recycling establishments that have created over a million jobs in the US. The National Waste &amp; Recycling Association (NWRA) reported in May 2015 that recycling and waste made a $6.7 billion economic impact in Ohio, U.S., and employed 14,000 people. Economists would classify this extra labor used as a cost rather than a benefit since these workers could have been employed elsewhere; the cost effectiveness of creating these additional jobs remains unclear.

Sometimes cities have found recycling saves resources compared to other methods of disposal of waste. Two years after New York City declared that implementing recycling programs would be &quot;a drain on the city&quot;, New York City leaders realized that an efficient recycling system could save the city over $20 million. Municipalities often see fiscal benefits from implementing recycling programs, largely due to the reduced landfill costs. A study conducted by the Technical University of Denmark according to the Economist found that in 83 percent of cases, recycling is the most efficient method to dispose of household waste. However, a 2004 assessment by the Danish Environmental Assessment Institute concluded that incineration was the most effective method for disposing of drink containers, even aluminium ones.

Fiscal efficiency is separate from economic efficiency. Economic analysis of recycling does not include what economists call externalities: unpriced costs and benefits that accrue to individuals outside of private transactions. Examples include less air pollution and greenhouse gases from incineration and less waste leaching from landfills. Without mechanisms such as taxes or subsidies, businesses and consumers following their private benefit would ignore externalities despite the costs imposed on society. If landfills and incinerator pollution is inadequately regulated, these methods of waste disposal appear cheaper than they really are, because part of their cost is the pollution imposed on people nearby. Thus, advocates have pushed for legislation to increase demand for recycled materials. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has concluded in favor of recycling, saying that recycling efforts reduced the country&#x27;s carbon emissions by a net 49 million metric tonnes in 2005. In the United Kingdom, the Waste and Resources Action Programme stated that Great Britain&#x27;s recycling efforts reduce CO2 emissions by 10–15 million tonnes a year. The question for economic efficiency is whether this reduction is worth the extra cost of recycling and thus makes the artificial demand creates by legislation worthwhile.

Certain requirements must be met for recycling to be economically feasible and environmentally effective. These include an adequate source of recyclates, a system to extract those recyclates from the waste stream, a nearby factory capable of reprocessing the recyclates, and a potential demand for the recycled products. These last two requirements are often overlooked—without both an industrial market for production using the collected materials and a consumer market for the manufactured goods, recycling is incomplete and in fact only &quot;collection&quot;.

Free-market economist Julian Simon remarked &quot;There are three ways society can organize waste disposal: (a) commanding, (b) guiding by tax and subsidy, and (c) leaving it to the individual and the market&quot;. These principles appear to divide economic thinkers today.

Frank Ackerman favours a high level of government intervention to provide recycling services. He believes that recycling&#x27;s benefit cannot be effectively quantified by traditional &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics. Allen Hershkowitz supports intervention, saying that it is a public service equal to education and policing. He argues that manufacturers should shoulder more of the burden of waste disposal.

Paul Calcott and Margaret Walls advocate the second option. A deposit refund scheme and a small refuse charge would encourage recycling but not at the expense of illegal dumping. Thomas C. Kinnaman concludes that a landfill tax would force consumers, companies and councils to recycle more.

Most free-market thinkers detest subsidy and intervention, arguing that they waste resources. The general argument is that if cities charge the full cost of garbage collection, private companies can profitably recycle any materials for which the benefit of recycling exceeds the cost (e.g. aluminum) and do not recycle other materials for which the benefit is less than the cost (e.g. glass). Cities, on the other hand, often recycle even when they not only do not receive enough for the paper or plastic to pay for its collection, but must actually pay private recycling companies to take it off of their hands. Terry Anderson and Donald Leal think that all recycling programmes should be privately operated, and therefore would only operate if the money saved by recycling exceeds its costs. Daniel K. Benjamin argues that it wastes people&#x27;s resources and lowers the wealth of a population. He notes that recycling can cost a city more than twice as much as landfills, that in the United States landfills are so heavily regulated that their pollution effects are negligible, and that the recycling process also generates pollution and uses energy, which may or may not be less than from virgin production.

=== Trade in recyclates ===
Certain countries trade in unprocessed . Some have complained that the ultimate fate of recyclates sold to another country is unknown and they may end up in landfills instead of being reprocessed. According to one report, in America, 50–80 percent of computers destined for recycling are actually not recycled. There are reports of illegal-waste imports to China being dismantled and recycled solely for monetary gain, without consideration for workers&#x27; health or environmental damage. Although the Chinese government has banned these practices, it has not been able to eradicate them. In 2008, the prices of recyclable waste plummeted before rebounding in 2009. Cardboard averaged about £53/tonne from 2004 to 2008, dropped to £19/tonne, and then went up to £59/tonne in May 2009. PET plastic averaged about £156/tonne, dropped to £75/tonne and then moved up to £195/tonne in May 2009.

Certain regions have difficulty using or exporting as much of a material as they recycle. This problem is most prevalent with glass: both Britain and the U.S. import large quantities of wine bottled in green glass. Though much of this glass is sent to be recycled, outside the American Midwest there is not enough wine production to use all of the reprocessed material. The extra must be downcycled into building materials or re-inserted into the regular waste stream.

Similarly, the northwestern United States has difficulty finding markets for recycled newspaper, given the large number of pulp mills in the region as well as the proximity to Asian markets. In other areas of the U.S., however, demand for used newsprint has seen wide fluctuation.

In some U.S. states, a program called RecycleBank pays people to recycle, receiving money from local municipalities for the reduction in landfill space that must be purchased. It uses a single stream process in which all material is automatically sorted.

== Criticisms and responses ==

Much of the difficulty inherent in recycling comes from the fact that most products are not designed with recycling in mind. In the USA around 6 to 7 percent of pastic is recycled. The concept of sustainable design aims to solve this problem, and was laid out in the 2002 book &quot;Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things&quot; by architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart. They suggest that every product (and all packaging it requires) should have a complete &quot;closed-loop&quot; cycle mapped out for each component—a way in which every component either returns to the natural ecosystem through biodegradation or is recycled indefinitely.

While recycling diverts waste from entering directly into landfill sites, current recycling misses the dispersive components. Critics believe that complete recycling is impracticable as highly dispersed wastes become so diluted that the energy needed for their recovery becomes increasingly excessive.

As with environmental economics, care must be taken to ensure a complete view of the costs and benefits involved. For example, paperboard packaging for food products is more easily recycled than most plastic, but is heavier to ship and may result in more waste from spoilage. Economic expenses can incentivize fraud.

=== Net environmental benefits ===
Critics dispute the net economic and environmental benefits of recycling over its costs, and suggest that proponents of recycling often make matters worse and suffer from confirmation bias. Specifically, critics argue that the costs and energy used in collection and transportation detract from (and outweigh) the costs and energy saved in the production process; also that the jobs produced by the recycling industry can be a poor trade for the jobs lost in logging, mining, and other industries associated with production; and that materials such as paper pulp can only be recycled a few times before material degradation prevents further recycling.

The amount of energy saved through recycling depends upon the material being recycled and the type of energy accounting that is used. Correct accounting for this saved energy can be accomplished with life-cycle analysis using real energy values, and in addition, exergy, which is a measure of how much useful energy can be used. In general, it takes far less energy to produce a unit mass of recycled materials than it does to make the same mass of virgin materials.

Some scholars use emergy (spelled with an m) analysis, for example, budgets for the amount of energy of one kind (exergy) that is required to make or transform things into another kind of product or service. Emergy calculations take into account economics that can alter pure physics-based results. Using emergy life-cycle analysis researchers have concluded that materials with large refining costs have the greatest potential for high recycle benefits. Moreover, the highest emergy efficiency accrues from systems geared toward material recycling, where materials are engineered to recycle back into their original form and purpose, followed by adaptive reuse systems where the materials are recycled into a different kind of product, and then by-product reuse systems where parts of the products are used to make an entirely different product.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) states on its website that &quot;a paper mill uses 40 percent less energy to make paper from recycled paper than it does to make paper from fresh lumber.&quot; Some critics argue that it takes more energy to produce recycled products than it does to dispose of them in traditional landfill methods, since the curbside collection of recyclables often requires a second waste truck. However, recycling proponents point out that a second timber or logging truck is eliminated when paper is collected for recycling, so the net energy consumption is the same. An emergy life-cycle analysis on recycling revealed that fly ash, aluminum, recycled concrete aggregate, recycled plastic, and steel yield higher efficiency ratios, whereas the recycling of lumber generates the lowest recycle benefit ratio. Hence, the specific nature of the recycling process, the methods used to analyse the process, and the products involved affect the energy savings budgets.

It is difficult to determine the amount of energy consumed or produced in waste disposal processes in broader ecological terms, where causal relations dissipate into complex networks of material and energy flow. 

How much energy is used in recycling also depends on the type of material being recycled and the process used to do so. Aluminium is generally agreed to use far less energy when recycled rather than being produced from scratch. The EPA states that &quot;recycling aluminum cans, for example, saves 95 percent of the energy required to make the same amount of aluminum from its virgin source, bauxite.&quot; In 2009, more than half of all aluminium cans produced came from recycled aluminium. Similarly, it has been estimated that new steel produced with recycled cans reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 75%.

Economist Steven Landsburg has suggested that the sole benefit of reducing landfill space is trumped by the energy needed and resulting pollution from the recycling process. Others, however, have calculated through life-cycle assessment that producing recycled paper uses less energy and water than harvesting, pulping, processing, and transporting virgin trees. When less recycled paper is used, additional energy is needed to create and maintain farmed forests until these forests are as self-sustainable as virgin forests.

Other studies have shown that recycling in itself is inefficient to perform the &quot;decoupling&quot; of economic development from the depletion of non-renewable raw materials that is necessary for sustainable development. The international transportation or recycle material flows through &quot;... different trade networks of the three countries result in different flows, decay rates, and potential recycling returns&quot;. As global consumption of a natural resources grows, their depletion is inevitable. The best recycling can do is to delay; complete closure of material loops to achieve 100 percent recycling of nonrenewables is impossible as micro-trace materials dissipate into the environment causing severe damage to the planet&#x27;s ecosystems. Historically, this was identified as the metabolic rift by Karl Marx, who identified the unequal exchange rate between energy and nutrients flowing from rural areas to feed urban cities that create effluent wastes degrading the planet&#x27;s ecological capital, such as loss in soil nutrient production. Energy conservation also leads to what is known as Jevon&#x27;s paradox, where improvements in energy efficiency lowers the cost of production and leads to a rebound effect where rates of consumption and economic growth increases.

=== Economic costs ===
Journalist John Tierney notes that it is generally more expensive for municipalities to recycle waste from households than to send it to a landfill and that &quot;recycling may be the most wasteful activity in modern America.&quot;

The amount of money actually saved through recycling depends on the efficiency of the recycling program used to do it. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance argues that the cost of recycling depends on various factors, such as landfill fees and the amount of disposal that the community recycles. It states that communities begin to save money when they treat recycling as a replacement for their traditional waste system rather than an add-on to it and by &quot;redesigning their collection schedules and/or trucks&quot;.

In some cases, the cost of recyclable materials also exceeds the cost of raw materials. Virgin plastic resin costs 40 percent less than recycled resin. Additionally, a United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study that tracked the price of clear glass from 15 July to 2 August 1991, found that the average cost per ton ranged from $40 to $60 while a USGS report shows that the cost per ton of raw silica sand from years 1993 to 1997 fell between $17.33 and $18.10.

Comparing the market cost of recyclable material with the cost of new raw materials ignores economic externalities—the costs that are currently not counted by the market. Creating a new piece of plastic, for instance, may cause more pollution and be less sustainable than recycling a similar piece of plastic, but these factors are not counted in market cost. A life cycle assessment can be used to determine the levels of externalities and decide whether the recycling may be worthwhile despite unfavorable market costs. Alternatively, legal means (such as a carbon tax) can be used to bring externalities into the market, so that the market cost of the material becomes close to the true cost.

=== Working conditions and social costs===
The recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment can create a significant amount of pollution. This problem is specifically occurrent in India and China. Informal recycling in an underground economy of these countries has generated an environmental and health disaster. High levels of lead (Pb), polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated dioxins and furans, as well as polybrominated dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs), concentrated in the air, bottom ash, dust, soil, water, and sediments in areas surrounding recycling sites. These materials can make work sites harmful to the workers themselves and the surrounding environment.

In some countries, recycling is performed by the entrepreneurial poor such as the karung guni, zabbaleen, the rag-and-bone man, waste picker, and junk man. With the creation of large recycling organizations that may be profitable, either by law or economies of scale, the poor are more likely to be driven out of the recycling and the remanufacturing job market. To compensate for this loss of income, a society may need to create additional forms of societal programs to help support the poor. Like the parable of the broken window, there is a net loss to the poor and possibly the whole of a society to make recycling artificially profitable, e.g. through the law. However, in Brazil and Argentina, waste pickers/informal recyclers work alongside the authorities, in fully or semi-funded cooperatives, allowing informal recycling to be legitimized as a paid public sector job.

Because the social support of a country is likely to be less than the loss of income to the poor undertaking recycling, there is a greater chance for the poor to come in conflict with the large recycling organizations. This means fewer people can decide if certain waste is more economically reusable in its current form rather than being reprocessed. Contrasted to the recycling poor, the efficiency of their recycling may actually be higher for some materials because individuals have greater control over what is considered &quot;waste&quot;.

One labor-intensive underused waste is electronic and computer waste. Because this waste may still be functional and wanted mostly by those on lower incomes, who may sell or use it at a greater efficiency than large recyclers.

Some recycling advocates believe that laissez-faire individual-based recycling does not cover all of society&#x27;s recycling needs. Thus, it does not negate the need for an organized recycling program. Local government can consider the activities of the recycling poor as contributing to the ruining of property.

== Public participation rates ==
Changes that have been demonstrated to increase recycling rates include:
* Single-stream recycling
* Pay as you throw fees for trash
In a study done by social psychologist Shawn Burn, it was found that personal contact with individuals within a neighborhood is the most effective way to increase recycling within a community. In her study, she had 10 block leaders talk to their neighbors and persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without personal contact. As a result of this study, Shawn Burn believes that personal contact within a small group of people is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who had friends and neighbors that recycled were much more likely to also recycle than those who did not have friends and neighbors that recycled.

Many schools have created recycling awareness clubs in order to give young students an insight on recycling. These schools believe that the clubs actually encourage students to not only recycle at school but at home as well.

Recycling of metals varies extremely by type. Titanium and lead have an extremely high recycling rates of over 90%. Copper and cobalt have high rates of recycling around 75%. Only about half of aluminum is recycled. Most of the remaining metals have recycling rates of below 35%, while 34 types of metals have recycling rates of under 1%.

&quot;Between 1960 and 2000, the world production of plastic resins increased 25 times its original amount, while recovery of the material remained below 5 percent.&quot; Many studies have addressed recycling behaviour and strategies to encourage community involvement in recycling programs. It has been argued that recycling behavior is not natural because it requires a focus and appreciation for long-term planning, whereas humans have evolved to be sensitive to short-term survival goals; and that to overcome this innate predisposition, the best solution would be to use social pressure to compel participation in recycling programs. However, recent studies have concluded that social pressure does not work in this context. One reason for this is that social pressure functions well in small group sizes of 50 to 150 individuals (common to nomadic hunter–gatherer peoples) but not in communities numbering in the millions, as we see today. Another reason is that individual recycling does not take place in the public view.

Following the increasing popularity of recycling collection being sent to the same landfills as trash, some people kept on putting recyclables on the recyclables bin.

== Recycling in art ==
Art objects are more and more often made from recycled material.

== Embracing a circular economy through advanced sorting technologies ==
By extending the lifespan of goods, parts, and materials, a circular economy seeks to minimize waste and maximize resource utilization. Advanced sorting techniques like optical and robotic sorting may separate and recover valuable materials from waste streams, lowering the requirement for virgin resources and accelerating the shift to a circular economy.

Community engagement, such as education and awareness campaigns, may support the acceptance of recycling and reuse programs and encourage the usage of sustainable practices. One can lessen our influence on the environment, save natural resources, and generate economic possibilities by adopting a circular economy using cutting-edge sorting technology and community engagement. According to Melati et al., to successfully transition to a circular economy, legislative and regulatory frameworks must encourage sustainable practices while addressing possible obstacles and difficulties in putting these ideas into action.

<doc id="70158" wikidata="Q544076" url="?curid=70158" title="John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset">
<text>John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset (c. 1373 – 16 March 1410), known as the Marquess of Somerset and Marquess of Dorset from 1397–99, was an English nobleman and politician. Beaufort was the second son of John of Gaunt (1340–1399; third surviving son of King Edward III), eldest of the four children by his mistress Katherine Swynford, whom he later married in 1396.

The Beaufort children were declared legitimate twice by parliament, first during the reign of King Richard II, in 1397, which was confirmed by Henry IV, as well as by Pope Boniface IX in September 1396.

Beaufort&#x27;s surname (properly &quot;de Beaufort&quot;, &quot;from Beaufort&quot;) probably reflects his birthplace at his father&#x27;s castle and manor of Beaufort (&quot;beautiful stronghold&quot;) in Champagne, France. The Portcullis heraldic badge of the Beauforts, now the emblem of the House of Commons, is believed to have been based on that of the castle of Beaufort, now demolished.
Between May and September 1390, Beaufort saw military service in North Africa in the Barbary Crusade led by Louis II, Duke of Bourbon. In 1394, he was in Lithuania serving with the Teutonic Knights.

John was created Earl of Somerset on 10 February 1397, just a few days after the legitimation of the Beaufort children was recognised by Parliament. The same month, he was also appointed Admiral of the Irish fleet, as well as Constable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports. In May, his admiralty was extended to include the northern fleet. That summer, the new earl became one of the noblemen who helped Richard II free himself from the power of the Lords Appellant. As a reward, he was created Marquess of Somerset and Marquess of Dorset on 29 September, and sometime later that year he was made a Knight of the Garter and appointed Lieutenant of Aquitaine. In addition, two days before his elevation as a Marquess he married the king&#x27;s niece, Margaret Holland, sister of Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey, another of the counter-appellants. John remained in the king&#x27;s favour even after his older half-brother Henry Bolingbroke (later Henry IV) was banished from England in 1398.

==Later career==
After Richard II was deposed by Henry Bolingbroke in 1399, the new king rescinded the titles that had been given to the counter-appellants, and thus John Beaufort became merely Earl of Somerset again. Nevertheless, he proved loyal to his half-brother&#x27;s reign, serving in various military commands and on some important diplomatic missions. It was Beaufort who was given the confiscated estates of the Welsh rebel leader Owain Glyndŵr in 1400, although he would not have been able to take possession of these estates unless he had lived until after 1415. In 1404, he was named Constable of England.

==Family==
John Beaufort and his wife Margaret Holland, the daughter of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent and Alice FitzAlan, had six children. His granddaughter Lady Margaret Beaufort married Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond, the son of Dowager Queen Catherine of Valois by Owen Tudor.

John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, died in the Hospital of St Katharine&#x27;s by the Tower. He was buried in St Michael&#x27;s Chapel in Canterbury Cathedral.

His children included the following:
*Henry Beaufort, 2nd Earl of Somerset (1401 – 25 November 1418)
*John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset (baptised 25 March 1404 – 27 May 1444) – father of Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby, mother of King Henry VII of England
*Joan Beaufort, Queen of Scotland (1404 – 15 July 1445) – married James I, King of Scots.
*Thomas Beaufort, Count of Perche (1405 – 3 October 1431)
*Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset (1406 – 22 May 1455)
*Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Devon (1409–1449) – married Thomas de Courtenay, 13th Earl of Devon.

==Appointments==

*Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports: 1398
*Admiral of the West: 1397
*Admiral of the Irish Fleet: 1397
*Lieutenant of Aquitaine: 1397
*Admiral of the North and Western Fleets: 9 May 1398 – 15 November 1399
*Lord High Constable of England: 1404
*Admiral of the North and Western Fleets: May 1406 – June 1407

==Arms==
As a legitimised grandson of King Edward III, Beaufort bore that king&#x27;s royal arms, differenced by a &quot;bordure gobony argent and azure&quot;.
Arms of Beaufort, legitimised progeny of John of Gaunt, third surviving son of King Edward III: &quot;Royal arms of King Edward III within a bordure compony argent and azure&quot; (see Coat of arms of England). The arms were updated when the kings of England adopted France modern, having been adopted by the King of France in 1376. Charles, an illegitimate son of Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset (1436–1464), took the surname &quot;Somerset&quot; together with the Beaufort arms and was created Baron Herbert (1461) and Earl of Worcester (1513). In 1682 his descendant Henry Somerset, 3rd Marquess of Worcester (1629–1700), was created Duke of Beaufort. These arms are thus used by Beaufort, Duke of Somerset (extinct) and Somerset, Duke of Beaufort (extant).

<text>Anthony Trollope ( ; 24 April 1815 – 6 December 1882) was an English novelist and civil servant of the Victorian era. Among his best-known works is a series of novels collectively known as the &quot;Chronicles of Barsetshire&quot;, which revolves around the imaginary county of Barsetshire. He also wrote novels on political, social, and gender issues and other topical matters.

Trollope&#x27;s literary reputation dipped during the last years of his life, but he regained somewhat of a following by the mid-20th century.

==Biography==
Anthony Trollope was the son of barrister Thomas Anthony Trollope and the novelist and travel writer Frances Milton Trollope. Though a clever and well-educated man and a Fellow of New College, Oxford, Thomas Trollope failed at the Bar due to his bad temper. Ventures into farming proved unprofitable, and his expectations of inheritance were dashed when an elderly, childless uncle remarried and fathered children. Thomas Trollope was the son of the Rev. (Thomas) Anthony Trollope, rector of Cottered, Hertfordshire, himself the sixth son of Sir Thomas Trollope, 4th Baronet. The baronetcy later came to descendants of Anthony Trollope&#x27;s second son, Frederic. As a son of landed gentry, Thomas Trollope wanted his sons raised as gentlemen who would attend Oxford or Cambridge. Anthony Trollope suffered much misery in his boyhood, owing to the disparity between the privileged background of his parents and their comparatively meagre means.

Born in London, Anthony attended Harrow School as a day pupil for three years, beginning at age seven, without paying fees because his father&#x27;s farm, acquired for that purpose, lay in the neighbourhood. After a spell at a private school at Sunbury, he followed his father and two older brothers to Winchester College, where he remained for three years. He then returned to Harrow as a day-boy to reduce his education costs. With no money or friends at these two high-ranked elite public schools, Trollope was bullied a great deal, enduring miserable experiences. At the age of 12, he fantasised about suicide. He also sought refuge in daydreams, constructing elaborate imaginary worlds.

In 1827, his mother, Frances Trollope, moved to America, to the Nashoba Commune, along with Trollope&#x27;s three younger siblings. After that failed, she opened a bazaar in Cincinnati, which proved unsuccessful. Thomas Trollope joined them for a short time before returning to the farm at Harrow, but Anthony stayed in England throughout. His mother returned in 1831 and rapidly made a name for herself as a writer, soon earning a good income. His father&#x27;s affairs, however, went from bad to worse. He gave up his legal practice entirely and failed to make enough income from farming to pay rent to his landlord, Lord Northwick. In 1834, he fled to Belgium to avoid arrest for debt. The whole family moved to a house near Bruges, where they lived entirely on Frances&#x27;s earnings.

In Belgium, Anthony was offered a commission in an Austrian cavalry regiment. To accept it, he needed to learn French and German; he had a year in which to do so. To acquire these languages without expense to himself and his family, he became an usher (assistant master) in a school in Brussels, making him the tutor of 30 boys. After six weeks there, however, he was offered a clerkship in the General Post Office, obtained through a family friend. Accepting this post, he returned to London in the autumn of 1834. Thomas Trollope died the following year.

According to Trollope, &quot;the first seven years of my official life were neither creditable to myself nor useful to the public service.&quot; At the Post Office, he acquired a reputation for unpunctuality and insubordination. A debt of £12 to a tailor fell into the hands of a moneylender and grew to more than £200; the lender regularly visited Trollope at his workplace to demand payments. Trollope hated his job, but saw no alternative and lived in constant fear of dismissal.

===Move to Ireland===
In 1841, an opportunity to escape arose. A postal surveyor clerk in central Ireland, reported as incompetent, needed replacement. The position was not regarded as desirable, but Trollope, in debt and in trouble at work, volunteered for it; and his supervisor, William Maberly, eager to be rid of him, appointed him to the position.

Trollope&#x27;s new work consisted largely of inspection tours in Connaught, and he based himself in Banagher, King&#x27;s County. Although he had arrived with a bad reference from London, his new supervisor resolved to judge him on his merits, and within a year, by Trollope&#x27;s account, he earned a reputation as a valuable public servant. His salary and travel allowance went much further in Ireland than they had in London, and he found himself enjoying a measure of prosperity. He took up fox hunting, which he would pursue enthusiastically for the next three decades. As a post-office surveyor, he interacted with local Irish people, whose company he found pleasant: &quot;The Irish people did not murder me, nor did they even break my head. I soon found them to be good-humoured, clever—the working classes very much more intelligent than those of England—economical and hospitable.&quot;

At the watering place of Dún Laoghaire, Trollope met Rose Heseltine (1821–1917), the daughter of a Rotherham bank manager. They became engaged when he had been in Ireland for just a year, but Trollope&#x27;s debts and her lack of a fortune prevented them from marrying until 1844. Soon after they wed, Trollope was transferred to another postal district in the south of Ireland, and the family moved to Clonmel. Their first son, Henry Merivale, was born in 1846, and their second, Frederick James Anthony, in 1847.

===Early works===
Though Trollope had decided to become a novelist, he had accomplished very little writing during his first three years in Ireland. At the time of his marriage, he had only written the first of three volumes of his first novel, &quot;The Macdermots of Ballycloran&quot;. Within a year of his marriage, he finished that work.

Trollope began writing on the numerous long train trips around Ireland he had to take to carry out his postal duties. Setting firm goals about how much he would write each day, he eventually became one of the most prolific writers of all time. He wrote his earliest novels while working as a Post Office inspector, occasionally dipping into the &quot;lost-letter&quot; box for ideas.

Significantly, many of his earliest novels have Ireland as their setting—natural enough given that he wrote them or thought them up while he was living and working in Ireland, but unlikely to enjoy warm critical reception, given the contemporary English attitude towards Ireland. Critics have pointed out that Trollope&#x27;s view of Ireland separates him from many of the other Victorian novelists. Other critics claimed that Ireland did not influence Trollope as much as his experience in England, and that the society in Ireland harmed him as a writer, especially since Ireland was experiencing the Great Famine during his time there. However, these critics (who have been accused of bigoted opinions against Ireland) failed or refused to acknowledge both Trollope&#x27;s true attachment to the country and the country&#x27;s capacity as a rich literary field.

Trollope published four novels about Ireland. Two were written during the Great Famine, while the third deals with the famine as a theme (&quot;The Macdermots of Ballycloran&quot;, &quot;The Kellys and the O&#x27;Kellys&quot;, and &quot;Castle Richmond&quot;, respectively). &quot;The Macdermots of Ballycloran&quot; was written while he was staying in the village of Drumsna, County Leitrim. &quot;The Kellys and the O&#x27;Kellys&quot; (1848) is a humorous comparison of the romantic pursuits of the landed gentry (Francis O&#x27;Kelly, Lord Ballindine) and his Catholic tenant (Martin Kelly). Two short stories deal with Ireland (&quot;The O&#x27;Conors of Castle Conor, County Mayo&quot; and &quot;Father Giles of Ballymoy&quot;). Some critics argue that these works seek to unify an Irish and British identity, instead of viewing the two as distinct. Even as an Englishman in Ireland, Trollope was still able to attain what he saw as essential to being an &quot;Irish writer&quot;: possessed, obsessed, and &quot;mauled&quot; by Ireland.

The reception of the Irish works left much to be desired. Henry Colburn wrote to Trollope, &quot;It is evident that readers do not like novels on Irish subjects as well as on others.&quot; In particular, magazines such as &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot;, which included reviews that attacked the Irish for their actions during the famine, were representative of the dismissal by English readers of any work written about the Irish.

===Success as an author===
In 1851, Trollope was sent to England, charged with investigating and reorganising rural mail delivery in southwestern England and south Wales. The two-year mission took him over much of Great Britain, often on horseback. Trollope describes this time as &quot;two of the happiest years of my life&quot;.

In the course of it, he visited Salisbury Cathedral; and there, according to his autobiography, he conceived the plot of &quot;The Warden&quot;, which became the first of the six Barsetshire novels. His postal work delayed the beginning of writing for a year; the novel was published in 1855, in an edition of 1,000 copies, with Trollope receiving half of the profits: £9 8s. 8d. in 1855, and £10 15s. 1d. in 1856. Although the profits were not large, the book received notices in the press and brought Trollope to the attention of the novel-reading public.

He immediately began work on &quot;Barchester Towers&quot;, the second Barsetshire novel; upon its publication in 1857, he received an advance payment of £100 (about £ in 2024 consumer pounds) against his share of the profits. Like &quot;The Warden&quot;, &quot;Barchester Towers&quot; did not obtain large sales, but it helped to establish Trollope&#x27;s reputation. In his autobiography, Trollope writes, &quot;It achieved no great reputation, but it was one of the novels which novel readers were called upon to read.&quot; For the following novel, &quot;The Three Clerks&quot;, he was able to sell the copyright for a lump sum of £250; he preferred this to waiting for a share of future profits.

===Return to England===
Although Trollope had been happy and comfortable in Ireland, he felt that as an author, he should live within easy reach of London. In 1859, he sought and obtained a position in the Post Office as Surveyor to the Eastern District, comprising Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, and most of Hertfordshire.
Later that year, he moved to Waltham Cross, about from London in Hertfordshire, where he lived until 1871.

In late 1859, Trollope learned of preparations for the release of the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot;, to be published by George Murray Smith and edited by William Makepeace Thackeray. He wrote to the latter, offering to provide short stories for the new magazine. Thackeray and Smith both responded: the former urging Trollope to contribute, the latter offering £1,000 for a novel, provided that a substantial part of it could be available to the printer within six weeks. Trollope offered Smith &quot;Castle Richmond&quot;, which he was then writing; but Smith declined to accept an Irish story, and suggested a novel dealing with English clerical life as had &quot;Barchester Towers&quot;. Trollope then devised the plot of &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot;, setting it near Barchester so that he could make use of characters from the Barsetshire novels.

&quot;Framley Parsonage&quot; proved enormously popular, establishing Trollope&#x27;s reputation with the novel-reading public and amply justifying the high price that Smith had paid for it. The early connection to &quot;Cornhill&quot; also brought Trollope into the London circle of artists, writers, and intellectuals, not least among whom were Smith and Thackeray.

By the mid-1860s, Trollope had reached a fairly senior position within the Post Office hierarchy, despite ongoing differences with Rowland Hill, who was at that time Chief Secretary to the Postmaster General. Postal history credits Trollope with introducing the pillar box (the ubiquitous mail-box) in the United Kingdom. He was earning a substantial income from his novels. He had overcome the awkwardness of his youth, made good friends in literary circles, and hunted enthusiastically. In 1865, Trollope was among the founders of the liberal Fortnightly Review.

When Hill left the Post Office in 1864, Trollope&#x27;s brother-in-law, John Tilley, who was then Under-Secretary to the Postmaster General, was appointed to the vacant position. Trollope applied for Tilley&#x27;s old post but was passed over in favour of a subordinate, Frank Ives Scudamore. In the autumn of 1867, Trollope resigned his position at the Post Office, having by that time saved enough to generate an income equal to the pension he would lose by leaving before the age of 60.

===Beverley campaign===
Trollope had long dreamt of taking a seat in the House of Commons. As a civil servant, however, he was ineligible for such a position. His resignation from the Post Office
removed this disability, and he almost immediately began seeking a seat for which he might stand. In 1868, he agreed to stand as a Liberal candidate in the borough of Beverley, in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

Party leaders apparently took advantage of Trollope&#x27;s eagerness to stand and of his willingness to spend money on a campaign. Beverley had a long history of vote-buying and of intimidation by employers and others. Every election since 1857 had been followed by an election petition alleging corruption, and it was estimated that 300 of the 1,100 voters in 1868 would sell their votes. The task of a Liberal candidate was not to win the election but to give the Conservative candidates an opportunity to display overt corruption, which could then be used to disqualify them.

Trollope described his period of campaigning in Beverley as &quot;the most wretched fortnight of my manhood&quot;.
He spent a total of £400 on his campaign. The election was held on 17 November 1868; the novelist finished last of four candidates, with the victory going to the two Conservatives. A petition was filed, and a Royal Commission investigated the circumstances of the election; its findings of extensive and widespread corruption drew nationwide attention, and led to the disfranchisement of the borough in 1870. The fictional Percycross election in &quot;Ralph the Heir&quot; and the Tankerville election in &quot;Phineas Redux&quot; are closely based on the Beverley campaign.

===Later years===
After the defeat at Beverley, Trollope concentrated entirely on his literary career. While continuing to produce novels rapidly, he also edited the &quot;St Paul&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which published several of his novels in serial form.

&quot;Between 1859 and 1875, Trollope visited the United States five times. Among American literary men he developed a wide acquaintance, which included Lowell, Holmes, Emerson, Agassiz, Hawthorne, Longfellow, Bret Harte, Artemus Ward, Joaquin Miller, Mark Twain, Henry James, William Dean Howells, James T. Fields, Charles Norton, John Lothrop Motley, and Richard Henry Dana Jr.&quot;

Trollope wrote a travel book focusing on his experiences in the US during the American Civil War titled &quot;North America&quot; (1862). Aware that his mother had published a harshly anti-American travel book about the U.S. (titled the &quot;Domestic Manners of the Americans&quot;) and feeling markedly more sympathetic to the United States, Trollope resolved to write a work which would &quot;add to the good feeling which should exist between two nations which ought to love each other.&quot; During his time in America, Trollope remained a steadfast supporter of the Union, being a committed abolitionist who was opposed to the system of slavery as it existed in the South.

In 1871, Trollope made his first trip to Australia, arriving in Melbourne on 28 July 1871 on the SS &quot;Great Britain&quot;, with his wife and their cook. The trip was made to visit their younger son, Frederick, who was a sheep farmer near Grenfell, New South Wales. He wrote his novel &quot;Lady Anna&quot; during the voyage. In Australia, he spent a year and two days &quot;descending mines, mixing with shearers and rouseabouts, riding his horse into the loneliness of the bush, touring lunatic asylums, and exploring coast and plain by steamer and stagecoach&quot;. He visited the penal colony of Port Arthur and its cemetery, Isle of the Dead. Despite this, the Australian press was uneasy, fearing he would misrepresent Australia in his writings. This fear was based on rather negative writings about America by his mother, Fanny, and by Charles Dickens. On his return, Trollope published a book, &quot;Australia and New Zealand&quot; (1873). It contained both positive and negative comments. On the positive side, it found a comparative absence of class consciousness and praised aspects of Perth, Melbourne, Hobart and Sydney. However, he was negative about Adelaide&#x27;s river, the towns of Bendigo and Ballarat, and the Aboriginal population. What most angered the Australian papers, though, were his comments &quot;accusing Australians of being braggarts&quot;.

Trollope returned to Australia in 1875 to help his son close down his failed farming business. He found that the resentment created by his accusations of bragging remained. Even when he died in 1882, Australian papers still &quot;smouldered&quot;, referring yet again to these accusations, and refusing to fully praise or recognize his achievements.

In the late 1870s, Trollope furthered his travel writing career by visiting southern Africa, including the Cape Colony and the Boer Republics of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal. Admitting that he initially assumed that the Afrikaners had &quot;retrograded from civilization, and had become savage, barbarous, and unkindly&quot;, Trollope wrote at length on Boer cultural habits, claiming that the &quot;roughness ... Spartan simplicity and the dirtiness of the Boer&#x27;s way of life [merely] resulted from his preference for living in rural isolation, far from any town.&quot; In the completed work, which Trollope simply titled &quot;South Africa&quot; (1877), he described the mining town of Kimberly as being &quot;one of the most interesting places on the face of the earth.&quot;

In 1880, Trollope moved to the village of South Harting in West Sussex. He spent some time in Ireland in the early 1880s researching his last, unfinished, novel, &quot;The Landleaguers&quot;. It is said that he was extremely distressed by the violence of the Land War.

==Death==
Trollope died in Marylebone, London, in 1882 and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, near the grave of his contemporary, Wilkie Collins.

==Works and reputation==

Trollope&#x27;s first major success came with &quot;The Warden&quot; (1855)—the first of six novels set in the fictional county of &quot;Barsetshire&quot; (often collectively referred to as the &quot;Chronicles of Barsetshire&quot;), dealing primarily with the clergy and landed gentry. &quot;Barchester Towers&quot; (1857) has probably become the best-known of these. Trollope&#x27;s other major series, the Palliser novels, which overlap with the Barsetshire novels, concerned itself with politics, with the wealthy, industrious Plantagenet Palliser (later Duke of Omnium) and his delightfully spontaneous, even richer wife Lady Glencora featured prominently. However, as with the Barsetshire series, many other well-developed characters populated each novel and in one, &quot;The Eustace Diamonds&quot;, the Pallisers play only a small role.

Trollope&#x27;s popularity and critical success diminished in his later years, but he continued to write prolifically, and some of his later novels have acquired a good reputation. In particular, critics, who concur that the book was not popular when published, generally acknowledge the sweeping satire &quot;The Way We Live Now&quot; (1875) as his masterpiece. In all, Trollope wrote 47 novels, 42 short stories, and five travel books, as well as nonfiction books titled &quot;Thackeray&quot; (1879) and &quot;Lord Palmerston&quot; (1882).

After his death, Trollope&#x27;s &quot;An Autobiography&quot; appeared and was a bestseller in London. Trollope&#x27;s downfall in the eyes of the critics stemmed largely from this volume. Even during his writing career, reviewers tended increasingly to shake their heads over his prodigious output, but when Trollope revealed that he strictly adhered to a daily writing quota, and admitted that he wrote for money, he confirmed his critics&#x27; worst fears. Writers were expected to wait for inspiration, not to follow a schedule.

Julian Hawthorne, an American writer, critic and friend of Trollope, while praising him as a man, calling him &quot;a credit to England and to human nature, and ... [deserving] to be numbered among the darlings of mankind&quot;, also said that &quot;he has done great harm to English fictitious literature by his novels&quot;.

Henry James also expressed mixed opinions of Trollope. The young James wrote some scathing reviews of Trollope&#x27;s novels (&quot;The Belton Estate&quot;, for instance, he called &quot;a stupid book, without a single thought or idea in it ... a sort of mental pabulum&quot;). He also made it clear that he disliked Trollope&#x27;s narrative method; Trollope&#x27;s cheerful interpolations into his novels about how his storylines could take any twist their author wanted did not appeal to James&#x27;s sense of artistic integrity. However, James thoroughly appreciated Trollope&#x27;s attention to realistic detail, as he wrote in an essay shortly after the novelist&#x27;s death:
His [Trollope&#x27;s] great, his inestimable merit was a complete appreciation of the usual. ... [H]e &quot;felt&quot; all daily and immediate things as well as saw them; felt them in a simple, direct, salubrious way, with their sadness, their gladness, their charm, their comicality, all their obvious and measurable meanings. ... Trollope will remain one of the most trustworthy, though not one of the most eloquent, of the writers who have helped the heart of man to know itself. ... A race is fortunate when it has a good deal of the sort of imagination—of imaginative feeling—that had fallen to the share of Anthony Trollope; and in this possession our English race is not poor.

Writers such as William Thackeray, George Eliot and Wilkie Collins admired and befriended Trollope, and Eliot noted that she could not have embarked on so ambitious a project as &quot;Middlemarch&quot; without the precedent set by Trollope in his own novels of the fictional—yet thoroughly alive—county of Barsetshire. Other contemporaries of Trollope praised his understanding of the quotidian world of institutions, official life, and daily business; he is one of the few novelists who find the office a creative environment. W. H. Auden wrote of Trollope: &quot;Of all novelists in any country, Trollope best understands the role of money. Compared with him, even Balzac is too romantic.&quot;

As trends in the world of the novel moved increasingly towards subjectivity and artistic experimentation, Trollope&#x27;s standing with critics suffered. But Lord David Cecil noted in 1934 that &quot;Trollope is still very much alive ... and among fastidious readers.&quot; He noted that Trollope was &quot;conspicuously free from the most characteristic Victorian faults&quot;. In the 1940s, Trollopians made further attempts to resurrect his reputation; he enjoyed a critical renaissance in the 1960s, and again in the 1990s. Some critics today have a particular interest in Trollope&#x27;s portrayal of women—he caused remarks even in his own day for his deep insight and sensitivity to the inner conflicts caused by the position of women in Victorian society.

In the early 1990s, interest in Trollope increased. A Trollope Society flourishes in the United Kingdom, as does its sister society in the United States. In 2011, the University of Kansas&#x27;s Department of English, in collaboration with the Hall Center for the Humanities and in partnership with &quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot;, began awarding an annual Trollope Prize. The Prize was established to focus attention on Trollope&#x27;s work and career.

Notable fans have included Alec Guinness, who never travelled without a Trollope novel; the former British prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Sir John Major; the first Canadian prime minister, John A. Macdonald; the economist John Kenneth Galbraith; the merchant banker Siegmund Warburg, who said that &quot;reading Anthony Trollope surpassed a university education&quot;; the English judge Lord Denning; the American novelists Sue Grafton, Dominick Dunne, and Timothy Hallinan; the poet Edward Fitzgerald; the artist Edward Gorey, who kept a complete set of his books; the American author Robert Caro; the playwright David Mamet; the soap opera writer Harding Lemay; the screenwriter and novelist Julian Fellowes; liberal political philosopher Anthony de Jasay and theologian Stanley Hauerwas.

<text>The Wiradjuri people (; ) are a group of Aboriginal Australian people from central New South Wales, united by common descent through kinship and shared traditions. They survived as skilled hunter-fisher-gatherers, in family groups or clans, and many still use knowledge of hunting and gathering techniques as part of their customary life.

In the 21st century, major Wiradjuri groups live in Condobolin, Peak Hill, Narrandera and Griffith. There are significant populations at Wagga Wagga and Leeton and smaller groups at West Wyalong, Parkes, Dubbo, Forbes, Cootamundra, Darlington Point, Cowra and Young.

==Name==
The Wiradjuri autonym is derived from , meaning &quot;no&quot; or &quot;not&quot;, with the comitative suffix or meaning &quot;having&quot;. That the Wiradjuri said , as opposed to some other word for &quot;no&quot;, was seen as a distinctive feature of their speech, and several other tribes in New South Wales, to the west of the Great Dividing Range, are similarly named after their own words for &quot;no&quot;. A similar distinction was made between Romance languages in medieval France, with the &quot;langues d&#x27;oc&quot; and the &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; distinguished by their word for &quot;yes&quot;.

In his book &quot;Aboriginal Tribes of Australia&quot; (1974), Norman Tindale wrote that &quot;Wiradjuri&quot; was one of several terms coined later, after the 1890s had seen a &quot;rash of such terms&quot;, following the publication of a work by ethnologist John Fraser. In 1892, Fraser had published a revised and expanded edition of Lancelot Threlkeld&#x27;s 1834 work on the Awabakal language, &quot;An Australian Grammar&quot;, in which he created his own names for groupings, such as Yunggai, Wachigari and Yakkajari.

Tindale says that some of the later terms had entered the literature, although not based on fieldwork and lacking Aboriginal support, as artificial, collective names for his &quot;Great Tribes&quot; of New South Wales. He writes that there was such a &quot;literary need for major groupings that [Fraser] set out to provide them for New South Wales, coining entirely artificial terms for his &#x27;Great tribes&#x27;. These were not based on field research and lacked aboriginal support. His names such as Yunggai, Wachigari and Yakkajari can be ignored as artifacts...During the 1890s the idea spread and soon there was a rash of such terms...Some of these have entered, unfortunately, into popular literature, despite their dubious origins.&quot;

He lists Wiradjuri (NSW) as one of these artificial names, along with Bangarang (Pangerang) (Vic.); Booandik (Vic. &amp; SA); Barkunjee (Barkindji) (NSW), Kurnai (Vic.), Thurrawal (Dharawal) (NSW), and Malegoondeet (?) (Vic.). He also mentions R. H. Mathews, A. W. Howitt and John Mathew as promulgators of the &quot;nations&quot; concept. However, Tindale refers to Wiradjuri in his own work (p. 200): &quot;Wiradjuri &#x27;Wiradjuri (Wi&#x27;raduri)&quot;.

==Wiradjuri language==

Wiradjuri is a Pama–Nyungan family and classified as a member of the small Wiradhuric branch of Australian languages of Central New South Wales.

The Wiradjuri language is effectively extinct, but attempts are underway to revive it, with a reconstructed grammar, based on earlier ethnographic materials and wordlists and the memories of Wiradjuri families, which is now used to teach the language in schools. This reclamation work was originally propelled by elder Stan Grant and John Rudder who had previously studied Australian Aboriginal languages in Arnhem Land.

==Country==
The Wiradjuri are the largest Aboriginal group in New South Wales. They once occupied a vast area in central New South Wales, on the plains running north and south to the west of the Blue Mountains. The area was known as &quot;the land of the three rivers&quot;, the &quot;Wambuul&quot; (Macquarie), the &quot;Kalare&quot; later known as the Lachlan and the Murrumbidgee, or &quot;Murrumbidjeri&quot;.

Norman Tindale estimated the territorial range of the Wiradjuri tribal lands at . Their eastern borders ran from north to south from above Mudgee, down to the foothills of the Blue Mountains east of Lithgow and Oberon, and east of Cowra, Young and Tumut and south to the upper Murray at Albury and east to about Tumbarumba. The southern border ran to Howlong. Its western reaches went along Billabong Creek to beyond Mossgiel. They extended southwest to the vicinity of Hay and Narrandera. Condobolin southwards to Booligal, Carrathool, Wagga Wagga, Cootamundra, Parkes, Trundle; Gundagai, Boorowa, and Rylstone, Wellington, and Carcoar all lay within Wiradjuri territory.

The Murray River forms the Wiradjuri&#x27;s southern boundary and the change from woodland to open grassland marks their eastern boundary.

==Social organisation==
The Wiradjuri were organised into bands. Norman Tindale quotes Alfred William Howitt as mentioning several of these local groups of the tribe:
* &quot;Narrandera&quot; (prickly lizard)
* &quot;Cootamundra&quot; (, kutamun turtle)
* &quot;Murranbulla&quot; (, two bark canoes).

===Burial rite===
The Wiradjuri, together with the Gamilaraay (who however used them in bora ceremonies), were particularly known for their use of carved trees which functioned as taphoglyphs, marking the burial site of a notable medicine-man, ceremonial leader, warrior or orator of a tribe. On the death of a distinguished Wiradjuri, initiated men would strip the bark off a tree to allow them to incise symbols on the side of the trunk which faced the burial mound. The craftsmanship on remaining examples of this funeral artwork displays notable artistic power. Four still stand near Molong at the Grave of Yuranigh.

They are generally to be found near rivers where the softer earth allowed easier burial. Alfred William Howitt remarked that these trees incised with taphoglyphs served both as transit points to allow mythological cultural heroes to ascend to, and descend from, the firmament as well as a means for the deceased to return to the sky.

==Lifestyle==
The Wiradjuri diet included yabbies and fish such as Murray cod from the rivers. In dry seasons, they ate kangaroos, emus and food gathered from the land, including fruit, nuts, yam daisies (&quot;Microseris lanceolata&quot;), wattle seeds, and orchid tubers. The Wiradjuri travelled into Alpine areas in the summer to feast on Bogong moths.

The Wiradjuri were also known for their handsome possum-skin cloaks stitched together from several possum furs. Governor Macquarie was presented with one of these cloaks by a Wiradjuri man when he visited Bathurst in 1815.

==British penetration==
Wiradjuri territory was first penetrated by British colonists in 1813. In 1822 George Suttor took up an extensive lot of land, later known as Brucedale Station, after Wiradjuri guides showed him an area with ample water sources. Suttor learnt their language, and befriended Windradyne, nicknamed &quot;Saturday&quot;, and attributed conflict to the harshness of his own people&#x27;s behaviour, since the Wiradjuri were in his view, fond of white people, as they would call them. Clashes between the British settlers and the Wiradjuri however multiplied as the influx of colonist increased, and became known as the Bathurst Wars. The occupation of their lands and their cultivation caused famine among the Wiradjuri, who had a different notion of what constituted property. In the 1850s there were still corroborees around Mudgee, but there were fewer clashes.

==Wiradjuri culture in fiction==
The short story &quot;Death in the Dawntime&quot;, originally published in &quot;The Mammoth Book of Historical Detectives&quot; (Mike Ashley, editor; 1995), is a murder mystery that takes place entirely among the Wiradjuri people before the arrival of Europeans in Australia.

In Bryce Courtenay&#x27;s novel &quot;Jessica&quot;, the plot is centred in Wiradjuri region. Jessica&#x27;s best friend (Mary Simpson) was from Wiradjuri.

Noel Beddoe&#x27;s novel &quot;The Yalda Crossing&quot; also explores Wiradjuri history from an early settler perspective, bringing to life a little-known massacre that occurred in the 1830s. Andy Kissane&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Station Owner&#x27;s Daughter, Narrandera&quot; tells a story about the aftermath of that same massacre, and was the inspiration for Alex Ryan&#x27;s short film, &quot;Ngurrumbang&quot;.

==Alternative names==
The variety of spellings for the name Wiradjuri is extensive, with over 60 ways of transcribing the word registered.

==Some words==
* &#x27;native peach&#x27;. The English word for this in Australia, &quot;quandong,&quot; is thought to derive from the Wirandjuri term.
* &#x27;crow&#x27;. The Wiradjeri term perhaps lies behind the toponym for the town of Wagga Wagga. The reduplication may be a pluralizer suggesting the idea of &quot;(place of) many crows&quot;. This has recently been questioned by Wiradjuri elder Stan Grant Sr and Tim Wess, an academic. The word behind the toponym is, they claim, , meaning &quot;dance&quot;, and the reduplicative would mean &quot;many dances/much dancing&quot;.

<text>Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter (c. January 137731 December 1426) was an English military commander during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, and briefly Chancellor of England. He was the third of the four children born to John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and his mistress Katherine Swynford. To overcome their problematic parentage, his parents were married in 1396, and he and his siblings were legitimated in 1390 and again in 1397. He married the daughter of Sir Thomas Neville (died 1387) of Hornby, Margaret Neville (born c. 1384), who bore him one son, Henry Beaufort. However, the child died young.

==Under Henry IV==
After the accession of his half-brother Henry IV, Beaufort was made a Knight of the Garter. In the following years he held various military posts: constable of Ludlow (1402), appointed Admiral of the North (1403), appointed captain of Calais (1407), and Admiral of the North and West (1408–1413) he retained the title for life. His most notable action during this decade was commanding the forces against the northern rebellion of 1405.

He became Chancellor of England on 31 January 1410, an office he held until 5 January 1412 during a time when King Henry was having trouble with the clergy, and then returned to military matters. Later in 1412 he was created Earl of Dorset.

==Under Henry V==
On the accession of Henry V, Beaufort was appointed Lieutenant of Aquitaine in 1413 and then captain of Harfleur in 1415. He spent the next few years in Normandy, serving as lieutenant of that duchy from 1416. He was created Duke of Exeter for life that same year.

Beaufort returned to England in 1417 while the king was still in Normandy in order to deal with problems in Scotland. In 1418, he went back to Normandy with a large force, taking part in the sieges of Évreux, Ivry, and Rouen. After the fall of Rouen in 1419, he was made captain of the city and conquered several more of the smaller Norman cities. Finally, in 1419, he took the great fortress of Château Gaillard, midway between Rouen and Paris, after a six-month siege.

During this time, Henry V began a policy of creating Norman titles for his aristocrats, with Beaufort being made Count of Harcourt in 1418.

In 1420, Beaufort helped negotiate the treaty of Troyes. The next year he was captured at the Battle of Baugé, where his nephew, Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence, was killed.

Beaufort was one of the executors of Henry V&#x27;s will, and so returned to England in 1422 after the latter&#x27;s death. He served on the governing council for the infant King Henry VI, though it is likely he spent some time in France as well.

The character of Exeter in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry V&quot; is based on Beaufort, although Beaufort was not actually created duke of Exeter until after the Battle of Agincourt; in 1415 he was still earl of Dorset. He also appears in &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;.

He is reported to have died on 31 December 1426, although 27 December 1426 or 1 January 1427 have been suggested as alternative dates. All of his titles (Duke of Exeter, Earl of Dorset and Count of Harcourt) became extinct. The Duchy of Exeter was restored to the Holland family; the Earldom of Dorset was recreated for Edmund, Count of Mortain, his nephew.

==Arms==
As a legitimated grandson of the sovereign, Beaufort bore the arms of the kingdom, differenced by a &quot;bordure gobony azure and ermine&quot;.

<text>The Drones Club is a recurring fictional location in the stories of British humorist P. G. Wodehouse. It is a gentlemen&#x27;s club in London. Many of Wodehouse&#x27;s Jeeves and Blandings Castle stories feature the club or its members.

Various members of the club appear in stories included in the &quot;Drones Club series&quot;, which contains stories not already included in other series. Most of the Drones Club stories star either Freddie Widgeon or Bingo Little. The club is initially introduced as a minor element in Wodehouse&#x27;s 1920 novel &quot;Jill the Reckless&quot;; it subsequently appears with more prominence across many Wodehouse stories and novels. The Drones Club makes its final appearance as a setting in 1972&#x27;s &quot;Pearls, Girls and Monty Bodkin&quot;.

The name &quot;Drones&quot; has been used by several real-life clubs and restaurants.

==Overview==
The Drones Club is in Mayfair, London, located in Dover Street, off Piccadilly. A drone being a male bee that does no work of its own and lives off the labour of others, it aptly describes the late 1920s to early 1930s stereotype of rich, idle young men, though some of the club members have careers and even jobs.

As decided by a vote of the club&#x27;s members, the Drones Club tie is a striking &quot;rich purple&quot;. A Drones Club scarf is also mentioned.

Wodehouse based the Drones Club on a combination of three real London clubs: the Bachelors&#x27; Club (which existed around the turn of the century), Buck&#x27;s Club (established 1919), and a dash of the Bath Club for its swimming pool&#x27;s ropes and rings. The fictional Drones barman, McGarry, has the same surname as the Buck&#x27;s first bartender, a Mr McGarry (Buck&#x27;s barman from 1919 to 1941, credited with creating the Buck&#x27;s Fizz and Sidecar cocktails). However Evelyn Waugh declared that the Drones did not resemble any real club in 1920s London.

A real club has been based at 40 Dover Street since 1893, The Arts Club. Other gentlemen&#x27;s clubs which have existed on Dover Street but are now dissolved include the Bath Club, the Junior Naval and Military Club, and the Scottish Club, as well as two mixed-sex clubs, the Albemarle Club and the Empress Club. None of these were considered among London&#x27;s &#x27;premier&#x27; clubs of the kind found on St James&#x27;s Street and Pall Mall, and so their ambience often had something of the raucous informality of the fictional Drones Club.

About a dozen club members are major or secondary recurring characters in the Wodehouse stories. In addition to Bertie Wooster (Jeeves stories), Pongo Twistleton (Uncle Fred stories), Rupert Psmith (Psmith stories), and Freddie Threepwood (Blandings stories), prominent recurring drones include Bingo Little and Freddie Widgeon, plus Monty Bodkin, Barmy Fotheringay-Phipps, Tuppy Glossop, Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright, Archibald Mulliner, and the club millionaire Oofy Prosser.

==Events==
* The Drones Club annual Golf tournament: A yearly golf handicap tournament that was held one year at Bingley-on-Sea.
* The Drones Club Squash Handicap: A yearly squash tournament. One year, Bertie Wooster was runner-up.
* The Drones Club Darts Tournament: An annual darts sweepstakes tournament held in February. Instead of taking part themselves, members purchase tickets for 10 shillings and each draw the name of one actual participant. The tournament is then held, and the member holding the name of the champion wins the jackpot.
* The Drones Club Fat Uncles Sweep: An annual sweepstakes contest introduced by Freddie Widgeon. Members enter their uncles in the contest and each draw the name of one uncle at random. Later, on the first day of the Eton v Harrow match, the members bring their uncles to the Drones Club for lunch. McGarry, having the uncanny ability to estimate the weight of anything to an ounce by sight, estimates the weight of each uncle and determines the fattest one. The member holding that name wins the jackpot, which exceeded £100 the first year the contest was run. A later rule change stipulates that £50 of the jackpot money is awarded to the nephew of the winning uncle.

==Stories==

Among the Wodehouse works, what was later dubbed the &quot;Drones Club series&quot; is a loose set of separate stories told by various narrators about members of the Drones Club. Many of the stories are told at the club or have some events happening at the club.

Relatable is one story, which features the club and a Drone as a secondary character, and marks the first mention of the Drones Club:

* &quot;Jill the Reckless&quot; (1921) – novel, Drone Algy Martyn as secondary character, one chapter at the club

Many more stories simply include a Drones member in some scenes, or have mentions of club members.

; Not included 

Not included are all identical stories published under other titles (in magazines or U.S. versions), or &quot;recycled&quot; stories, especially:

* &quot;Comrade Bingo&quot; and &quot;Bingo and the Little Woman&quot; (Bingo Little) – 1922 magazine stories merged into the semi-novel &quot;The Inimitable Jeeves&quot; (1923)
* &quot;Quest&quot; (Freddie Widgeon) – 1931 magazine story rewritten as &quot;The Knightly Quest of Mervyn&quot; (Mr Mulliner, non-Drones story, still featuring Oofy Prosser)
* &quot;The Ordeal of Bingo Little&quot; (Bingo Little) – 1954 magazine story rewritten as &quot;Leave It to Algy&quot; (Bingo Little, included above)
* &quot;Unpleasantness at Kozy Kot&quot; (Drone Dudley &quot;Biffy&quot; Wix-Biffen) – 1958 &quot;exclusive&quot; story recycled for the U.S. edition of &quot;A Few Quick Ones&quot; (1959) from &quot;Fixing it for Freddie&quot; (Jeeves story)
* &quot;The Great Fat Uncle Contest&quot; (Bingo Little) – 1965 magazine rewrite of &quot;Stylish Stouts&quot; (Bingo Little, included above)

==Eggs, Beans, and Crumpets==

Most of the Drones short stories are also &quot;Eggs, Beans, and Crumpets stories&quot;. These stories feature unnamed club members, each referred to as an &quot;Egg&quot;, &quot;Bean&quot;, or &quot;Crumpet&quot;. This is allegedly based on the habit they have of addressing each other as &quot;old egg&quot;, &quot;old bean&quot;, or &quot;my dear old crumpet&quot;, though characters in the stories almost never address other characters by these nicknames. A few later stories introduce a fourth subset of Drones Club members known as &quot;Piefaces&quot;.

Many of the Drones Club stories begin with these nondescript members talking about the latest exploits of Freddie Widgeon, Pongo Twistleton, Bingo Little, or another of their number. The story then transitions into a particularly well-informed Crumpet narrating the story as he tells it to an uninformed Egg or Bean:

: &quot;Beau Widgeon?&quot; said the Egg, impressed. &quot;What ho!&quot; A Crumpet shook his head. &quot;You won&#x27;t catch Freddie joining any Foreign Legion, once he gets on to the fact that it means missing his morning cup of tea. [...]&quot; (in &quot;Noblesse Oblige&quot;)

: &quot;[...] I allude, of course, to the Bella Mae Jobson affair.&quot; The Bean asked what the Bella Mae Jobson affair was, and the Crumpet, expressing surprise that he had not heard of it, said that it was the affair of Bella Mae Jobson. (in &quot;The Editor Regrets&quot;)

: &quot;He can&#x27;t do that here,&quot; said an Egg, [...] &quot;Hoy!&quot; he went on, addressing the Crumpet, who had entered as he spoke. (in &quot;The Word in Season&quot;)

Wodehouse had already used this technique in the stories told by his Mr Mulliner, who refers to his anonymous interlocutors by the name of their drink.

==Members==
The total number of members is not established. At the Drones Club weekend in Le Touquet, France, were &quot;about 87 members&quot;, and not all of them crossed the Channel (such as Pongo Twistleton and Horace Pendlebury-Davenport).

==Real Drones Clubs== 

Some real &quot;Drones&quot; clubs or restaurants exist or have existed, including:
* The Drones Club, a private club in Point Judith, Rhode Island (USA), was established in the late 1930s.
* A &quot;Drones&quot; restaurant existed in the early 1970s in London at 1 Pont Street off Knightsbridge. Previously a burger-and-fries, in November 2000 it was turned into a gastronomic restaurant by new owner and restaurateur Marco Pierre White. This &quot;Drones Club&quot; moved to 12 St. George Street in Mayfair, and was purchased in 2004 by businessman Ben Goldsmith and turned into a members-only dining club. Membership included pop stars, peers, CEOs and princesses. This club closed in March 2007 due to losing its location to a restaurant.
* Another &quot;Drones&quot; restaurant, aka &quot;Drones Fenwick of Bond Street&quot;, exists in London inside the Fenwick department store at 63 New Bond Street. It was linked to &quot;The Drones Club&quot; above.

<doc id="70174" wikidata="Q235282" url="?curid=70174" title="Moral">
<text>A moral (from Latin &quot;morālis&quot;) is a message that is conveyed or a lesson to be learned from a story or event. The moral may be left to the hearer, reader, or viewer to determine for themselves, or may be explicitly encapsulated in a maxim. A moral is a lesson in a story or real life.

==Finding morals==
As an example of an explicit maxim, at the end of Aesop&#x27;s fable of the Tortoise and the Hare, in which the plodding and determined tortoise won a race against the much-faster yet extremely arrogant hare, the stated moral is &quot;slow and steady wins the race&quot;. However, other morals can often be taken from the story itself; for instance, that arrogance or overconfidence in one&#x27;s abilities may lead to failure or the loss of an event, race, or contest.

The use of stock characters is a means of conveying the moral of the story by eliminating the complexity of personality and depicting the issues arising in the interplay between the characters, enabling the writer to generate a clear message. With more rounded characters, such as those typically found in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, the moral may be more nuanced but no less present, and the writer may point it out in other ways (see, for example, the Prologue to &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;).

=== Arts ===
Throughout the history of recorded literature, most fictional writing has served not only to entertain but also to instruct, inform, or improve their audiences or readership. In classical drama, for example, the role of the chorus was to comment on the proceedings and draw out a message for the audience to take away with them. At the same time, the novels of Charles Dickens are a vehicle for morals regarding the social and economic system of Victorian Britain.

Morals have typically been more obvious in children&#x27;s literature, sometimes even being introduced with the phrase: &quot;moral of the story is …&quot;. Such explicit techniques have grown increasingly out of fashion in modern storytelling, and are now usually only included for ironic purposes.

Some examples are: &quot;Better to be safe than sorry&quot; (precautionary principle), &quot;The evil deserves no aid&quot;, &quot;Be friends with whom you don&#x27;t like&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t judge people by the way they look&quot;, &quot;Slow and steady wins the race&quot;, &quot;Once started down the dark path, forever will it hold your destiny&quot;, and &quot;Your overconfidence is your weakness&quot;. Aesop&#x27;s Fables is one of the most famous collections of stories with strong moral conclusions.

=== Moral tales ===
Moral tales were one of the main purposes of literature during 1780–1830, especially in children&#x27;s literature. Part of the reason for this was the writings of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau in the 18th century, which brought attention to children as an audience for literature. Following in their line of thought, Thomas Day (1748–1789) wrote &quot;Sandford and Merton&quot;, elevating the outstanding morals of one young boy above the rapscallion nature of another. Maria Edgeworth (1776–1849) was another prominent author of moral tales, writing about how a wise adult can educate a child; one of her more famous stories is &quot;The Purple Jar&quot;. During this time, the theme of &quot;a young heroine or hero gaining wisdom and maturity&quot; was taken up by many other writers.

The ability of children to derive moral lessons from stories and visual media develops around the age of 9 or 10 years.

Research in developmental psychology has shown that children’s ability to understand and apply moral lessons from stories typically begins to develop between the ages of 9 and 10, as they become more capable of abstract thinking.

In more recent children&#x27;s literature, moral lessons continue to be conveyed through fantasy and adventure stories. For example, in J.K. Rowling&#x27;s Harry Potter series, themes of friendship, courage, and standing up for what is right are central moral messages that resonate with young readers.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Adolph Marr (November 16, 1819 – July 17, 1904) was a German journalist and politician, who popularized the term &quot;antisemitism&quot; (1881).

==Life==
Marr was born in Magdeburg as the only son of an actor and stage director. He went to a primary school in Hanover, then to a high school in Braunschweig. In Hamburg and Bremen, he was an apprentice in commerce, then he joined his father in Vienna, who had been engaged by the Burgtheater. There he worked as an employee in two Jewish firms. Later, Marr claimed that he had unjustly lost his job.

In 1841, he went to Zürich, where he became acquainted with political émigrés (like Georg Herwegh, Julius Fröbel, and August Follen), most of whom were members of the democratic or liberal leftist movements of the early 19th century.

In 1843, Marr was expelled from Zürich under the accusation that he had furthered communist activities. He turned to Lausanne, where he joined Hermann Döleke and Julius Standau, the founders of the secret Léman-Bund, which belonged to the &quot;Junges Deutschland&quot; (Young German Movement). Marr eventually became the head of the secret society and began to lean towards anarchism and atheism, founded another secret society, the &quot;Schweizerischer Arbeiterbund&quot; (Swiss Worker&#x27;s Union) and edited the &quot;Blätter der Gegenwart für soziales Leben&quot; (Present-Day Papers for Social Life, 1844/45). In 1845 he was expelled from Lausanne, too, and went to Hamburg. There he became a political journalist and published the satirical magazine &quot;Mephistopheles&quot; (1847/48–1852). He belonged to the leftists of the radical-democratic &quot;party&quot; and was a delegate to the National Assembly in Frankfurt after the March-Revolution of 1848. After the ultimate failure of the revolution he became, like so many other former revolutionaries, a proponent of the idea of German unification under Prussian leadership.

In 1852, Marr went abroad, to Costa Rica, where he tried to make a living as a businessman. Lacking success, he returned to Hamburg, worked again as a journalist, and in 1854 he married Georgine Johanna Bertha Callenbach, daughter of a Jewish businessman who had renounced his faith.

In 1859, Marr was elected member of the Hamburg Parliament. In an article, in the &quot;Courier an der Weser&quot; on 13 June 1862, he attacked the elected liberal speaker of the house, the Jewish lawyer , accusing him and other Jews of betraying the democratic movement and abusing their emancipation in order to enter the city&#x27;s merchant class. After extensive public protests, Marr was not reelected in 1862.

Marr and his first wife were divorced in 1873. In 1874, Marr married the Jewish Helene Sophia Emma Maria Behrend, who died within the same year. Marr&#x27;s first marriage was an unhappy one, and despite being financially stable, Marr was in emotional distress. Marr&#x27;s second marriage was a happy one, but then his wife and child died within days of each other, which left Marr in great distress and bitter towards the world. In 1875, there was a third marriage, to Jenny Therese Kornick (whose parents lived in a Christian-Jewish mixed marriage), who bore him a son. In 1877, this marriage was ended in divorce too; Marr&#x27;s last wife was Clara Maria Kelch, daughter of a Hamburg working man.

Marr&#x27;s speeches and articles showed first indications of antisemitism in 1848. He was influenced by the &quot;Burschenschaft&quot; movement of the early nineteenth century, which developed out of frustration among German students with the failure of the Congress of Vienna to create a unified state out of all the territories inhabited by the German people. The Burschenschaft rejected the participation of Jewish and other non-German minorities as members, &quot;unless they prove that they are anxious to develop within themselves a Christian-German spirit&quot; (a decision of the &quot;&quot;Burschenschaft&quot; Congress of 1818&quot;). While they were opposed to the participation of Jews in their movement, similarly to Heinrich von Treitschke later, they did allow the possibility of the Jewish (and other) minorities to participate in the German state if they were to abandon all signs of ethnic and religious distinctiveness and assimilate into the German &quot;Volk&quot;.

=== League of antisemites ===

Marr rejected the premise of assimilation as a means for Jews to become Germans. In his pamphlet &quot;Der Weg zum Siege des Germanenthums über das Judenthum&quot; (The Way to Victory of Germanism over Judaism, 1879) he introduced the idea that Germans and Jews were locked in a longstanding conflict, the origins of which he attributed to race—and that the Jews were winning. He argued that Jewish emancipation resulting from German liberalism had allowed the Jews to control German finance and industry. Furthermore, since this conflict was based on the different qualities of the Jewish and German races, it could not be resolved even by the total assimilation of the Jewish population. 

According to Marr, the struggle between Jews and Germans would only be resolved by the victory of one and the ultimate death of the other. A Jewish victory, he concluded, would result in &quot;finis Germaniae&quot; (the end of the German people). To prevent this from happening, in 1879 Marr founded the League of Antisemites (Antisemiten-Liga), the first German organization committed specifically to combating the alleged threat to Germany posed by the Jews and advocating their forced removal from the country.

The Pan-German League, founded in 1891, originally allowed for the membership of Jews, provided they were fully assimilated into German culture. It was only in 1912, eight years after Marr&#x27;s death, that the League declared racism as an underlying principle. Nevertheless, Marr was a major link in the evolving chain of German racism that erupted into genocide during the Nazi era.

According to Moshe Zimmermann in &quot;Wilhelm Marr: The Patriarch of Anti-Semitism&quot;, a book written 100 years after the fact, toward the end of his life Marr came to renounce antisemitism, arguing that social upheaval in Germany had been the result of the Industrial Revolution and conflict between political movements. This book was never published by Marr, only as text cited by Zimmermann.

<text>Frank Harris (14 February 1856 – 26 August 1931) was an Irish-American editor, novelist, short story writer, journalist and publisher, who was friendly with many well-known figures of his day.

Born in Ireland, he emigrated to the United States early in life, working in a variety of unskilled jobs before attending the University of Kansas to study law. After graduation, he quickly tired of his legal career and returned to Europe in 1882. He traveled in continental Europe before settling in London to pursue a career in journalism. In 1921, in his sixties, he became a US citizen. Though he attracted much attention during his life for his irascible, aggressive personality, editorship of famous periodicals, and friendship with the talented and famous, he is remembered mainly for his multiple-volume memoir &quot;My Life and Loves&quot;, which was banned in countries around the world for its sexual explicitness.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Harris was born James Thomas Harris in 1855, in Galway, Ireland, to Welsh parents. His father, Thomas Vernon Harris, was a naval officer from Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, Wales. While living with his older brother he was, for a year or more, a pupil at The Royal School, Armagh. At the age of 12 he was sent to Wales to continue his education as a boarder at the Ruabon Grammar School in Denbighshire, a time he was to remember later in &quot;My Life and Loves&quot;. Harris was unhappy at the school and ran away within a year.

He emigrated to the United States in late 1869, arriving in New York City virtually penniless. The 14-year-old took a series of odd jobs to support himself, working first as a boot black, a porter, a general laborer, and a construction worker on the erection of the Brooklyn Bridge. Harris would later turn these early occupational experiences into art, incorporating tales from them into his book &quot;The Bomb.&quot;

From New York Harris moved to the American Midwest, settling in the country&#x27;s second largest city, Chicago, where he took a job as a hotel clerk and eventually a manager. Owing to Chicago&#x27;s central place in the meat packing industry, Harris made the acquaintance of various cattlemen, who inspired him to leave the big city to take up work as a cowboy. Eventually growing tired of life in the cattle industry, he enrolled at the University of Kansas, where he studied law and earned a degree, gaining admission to the Kansas state bar association.

In 1878, in Brighton, England, he married Florence Ruth Adams, who died the following year.

===Return to Europe===

Harris was not cut out to be a lawyer and soon decided to turn his attention to literature. He moved to England in 1882, later traveling to various cities in Germany, Austria, France, and Greece on his literary quest. He worked briefly as an American newspaper correspondent before settling down in England to seriously pursue the vocation of journalism.

Harris first came to general notice as the editor of a series of London publications, including the &quot;Evening News&quot;, the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot; and the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, the last-named being the high point of his journalistic career, with H. G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw as regular contributors.

From 1908 to 1914 Harris concentrated on working as a novelist, authoring a series of popular books such as &quot;The Bomb,&quot; &quot;The Man Shakespeare,&quot; and &quot;The Yellow Ticket and Other Stories&quot;. With the advent of World War I in the summer of 1914, Harris decided to return to the United States.

From 1916 to 1922 he edited the U.S. edition of &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Magazine,&quot; a popular monthly which combined short story fiction with socialist-tinted features on contemporary news topics. One issue of the publication was banned from the mails by Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson during the period of American participation in the Great War. Despite this Harris managed to navigate the delicate situation which faced the left-wing press and to keep &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Magazine&quot; functioning and solvent during the war years.

Harris became an American citizen in April 1921. In 1922 he travelled to Berlin to publish his best-known work, his autobiography &quot;My Life and Loves&quot; (published in four volumes, 1922–1927). It is notorious for its graphic descriptions of Harris&#x27; purported sexual encounters and for its exaggeration of the scope of his adventures and his role in history. Years later, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reflected in its 21 March 1960 issue &quot;Had he not been a thundering liar, Frank Harris would have been a great autobiographer ... he had the crippling disqualification that he told the truth, as Max Beerbohm remarked, only &#x27;when his invention flagged&#x27;.&quot; A fifth volume, supposedly taken from his notes but of doubtful provenance, was published in 1954, long after his death.

Harris also wrote short stories and novels, two books on Shakespeare, a series of biographical sketches in five volumes under the title &quot;Contemporary Portraits&quot; and biographies of his friends Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. His attempts at playwriting were less successful: only &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Daventry&quot; (1900) (which may have been based on an idea by Oscar Wilde) was produced on the stage.

===Death and legacy===
Married three times, Harris died at 9 Rue de la Buffa in Nice aged 75 on 26 August 1931, of a heart attack. He was subsequently buried at Cimetière Sainte-Marguerite, adjacent to the Cimetière Caucade, in the same city.

Just after his death a biography written by Hugh Kingsmill (pseudonym of Hugh Kingsmill Lunn) was published.

==Cultural references==

In 1920, French writer and diplomat Paul Morand met an aged Frank Harris in Nice and borrowed much of his personality to create the character of O&#x27;Patah, a larger than life writer, publisher and Irish patriot, &quot;the last of the Irish bards&quot; in his short story &quot;La nuit de Portofino kulm&quot; (part of the famed collection of short stories &quot;Fermé la nuit&quot;) published in 1923 by Gallimard.

In 1922, Whittaker Chambers published a &quot;blasphemous&quot; and &quot;sacrilegious&quot; playlet called &quot;A Play for Puppets&quot; in &quot;The Morningside&quot;, a Columbia University student magazine, based on Frank Harris&#x27; 1919 play &quot;Miracle of the Stigmata&quot;, for which Chambers quit school to avoid expulsion. (&quot;The greater part of it is so plainly sacrilegious that it cannot be reproduced.&quot;)

In 1929, Cole Porter&#x27;s song &quot;After All, I&#x27;m Only a Schoolgirl&quot; references Harris and &quot;My Life and Loves&quot;, in a tale about a girl who is learning about adult relationships from a private tutor.

In 1936, Harris appeared as a character in the play &quot;Oscar Wilde&quot;, by Leslie &amp; Sewell Stokes, first produced at London&#x27;s Gate Theatre Studio (1936) and later at the Fulton Theatre, New York, in 1938, in both cases starring Robert Morley in the title role.

In 1958, the feature film &quot;Cowboy&quot; is an adaptation of the semi-autobiographical novel &quot;My Reminiscences as a Cowboy&quot;. Harris is played by Jack Lemmon.

In 1960, he is seen as a minor character in &quot;The Trials of Oscar Wilde&quot; played by Paul Rogers. Harris had specifically warned Wilde against prosecuting Queensberry for criminal libel, which led to his downfall.

In a 1972 episode of &quot;The Edwardians&quot;, he was played by John Bennett.

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson meet Harris in Nicholas Meyer&#x27;s 1976 novel &quot;The West End Horror&quot;. Watson comments on Harris&#x27; habit of always speaking very loudly.

A volume by Frank Harris held up the couch in &quot;Six Big Boobies&quot; (1985) episode of &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;.

On television, Harris was played by Leonard Rossiter in a 1978 BBC Play of the Week: &quot;Fearless Frank, or, Tidbits From The Life Of An Adventurer&quot;.

In 1980, a musical stage adaptation of &quot;Fearless Frank&quot; briefly ran on Broadway at the Princess Theatre, with Niall Toibin in the starring role. It had book and lyrics by Andrew Davies, music by Dave Brown, and was directed by Robert Gillespie. The production ran for 13 previews and 12 performances.

Harris appears as a vampire in Kim Newman&#x27;s 1992 novel &quot;Anno Dracula&quot;, as the mentor and vampire sire of one of the novel&#x27;s main characters.

He is a character in the 1997 Tom Stoppard play &quot;The Invention of Love&quot;, which deals with the life of A. E. Housman and the Oscar Wilde trials.

He appears as a close friend of Oscar Wilde in the award-winning play by Moisés Kaufman: &quot;Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde&quot;.

He appears in the first episode of the 2001 miniseries &quot;The Infinite Worlds of H. G. Wells&quot;, rejecting a story from Wells for being too long and too preposterous.

In the ITV series &quot;Mr Selfridge&quot; (2013), Samuel West plays a newspaper editor and publisher called Frank Edwards, a character based on Frank Harris.

In the crime comedy Pulp, Michael Caine plays a novelist who someone compares to Frank Harris, in which Caine glibly replies, &quot;Frank was a novice.&quot;

<doc id="70178" wikidata="Q18404" url="?curid=70178" title="Henri Barbusse">
<text>Henri Barbusse (; 17 May 1873 – 30 August 1935) was a French novelist, short story writer, journalist, poet and political activist. He began his literary career in the 1890s as a Symbolist poet and continued as a neo-Naturalist novelist; in 1916, he published &quot;Under Fire&quot;, a novel about World War I based on his experience which is described as one of the earliest works of the Lost Generation movement or as the work which started it; the novel had a major impact on the later writers of the movement, namely on Ernest Hemingway and Erich Maria Remarque.
Barbusse is considered one of the important French writers of 1910–1939 who mingled the war memories with moral and political meditations.

Before World War I, Barbusse was a pacifist, but in 1914, he volunteered for wartime service and was awarded the &quot;Croix de guerre&quot;; during the war, he was influenced by the Communists and came to the belief that a Revolution against the imperialist governments would be the only quick way to end the war and to deal with militarism and reaction. In years following the war, his work acquired a definite political orientation; he became a member of the French Communist Party and an Anti-Fascist and an anti-war activist. In the 1930s, he supported the Stalinist regime despite having a friendly relationship with Leon Trotsky in the middle of the 1920s and contributed to Joseph Stalin&#x27;s personality cult by writing his biography which became a &#x27;canonical&#x27; text for the French Stalinists but wasn&#x27;t in line with the glorification of Stalin in the USSR. He died in 1935 and didn&#x27;t see the events that followed, like the Moscow trials and the Nazi-Soviet pact.

He was a lifelong friend of Albert Einstein.

==Life==

=== Early life and career ===
The son of a French father and an English mother, Barbusse was born in Asnières-sur-Seine, France in 1873. Although he grew up in a small town, he left for Paris in 1889, at age 16. In 1895, he published a poetry collection &quot;Mourners&quot; (&quot;Pleureuses&quot;), which is sometimes identified as &quot;neo-Symbolist&quot;.

In 1908, Barbusse wrote a novel &quot;Hell&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Enfer&quot;), in which he described the life of a young Parisian who lives in a boarding house and spies through a hole in his wall on the other boarders and sees birth, death, adultery and lesbianism. The novel produced controversy because of breaking taboos and crossing conventional moral boundaries of the time; this work is identified as &#x27;neo-Naturalist&#x27;.

=== First World War ===
In 1914, at age 41, he enlisted in the French Army and served on the Western front during World War I. Invalided out of the army three times, Barbusse served in the war for 17 months, until November 1915, when he was permanently moved into a clerical position due to pulmonary damage, exhaustion, and dysentery. On 8 June 1915, he was awarded the Croix de guerre with citation. In 1916, he participated in the battle of Verdun. He was reformed on 1 June 1917.

Barbusse first came to fame with the publication of his novel &quot;Le Feu&quot; (translated by William Fitzwater Wray as &quot;Under Fire&quot;) in 1916, which was based on his experiences during World War I. By this time, Barbusse had become a pacifist, and his writing demonstrated his growing hatred of militarism. &quot;Le Feu&quot; drew criticism at the time for its harsh naturalism, but won the Prix Goncourt in December 1916.

=== Political and cultural activities ===
In January 1918, he left France and moved to Moscow, where he married a Russian woman and joined the Bolshevik Party. His novel, &quot;Clarté&quot;, is about an office worker who, while serving in the army, begins to realize that the imperialist war is a crime.. Vladimir Lenin commented that this novel was censored in France.

The Russian Revolution had a significant influence on Barbusse&#x27;s life and work. He joined the French Communist Party in 1923 and later travelled back to the Soviet Union. His later works, &quot;Manifeste aux Intellectuels&quot; (&quot;Elevations&quot;) (1930) and others, show a more revolutionary standpoint. Of these, the 1921 &quot;Le Couteau entre les dents&quot; (&quot;The Knife Between My Teeth&quot;) marks Barbusse&#x27;s siding with Bolshevism and the October Revolution. Barbusse characterized the birth of Soviet Russia as &quot;the greatest and most beautiful phenomenon in world history&quot;. The book &quot;Light from the Abyss&quot; (1919) and the collection of articles &quot;Words of a Fighting Man&quot; (1920) contain calls for the overthrow of capitalism. In 1925, Barbusse published &quot;Chains&quot;, showing history as the unbroken chain of suffering of people and their struggle for freedom and justice. In the publicistic book &quot;The Butchers&quot;, he exposes the White Terror in the Balkan countries.

In 1927, Barbusse participated in the Congress of Friends of the Soviet Union in Moscow. He led the World Congress Against Imperialist War (Amsterdam, 1932) and headed the World Committee Against War and Fascism, founded in 1933. He also took part in the work of the International Youth Congress (Paris, 1933) and the International Congress of Writers in Defense of Culture. Additionally, in the 1920s and 1930s, he edited the periodicals &quot;Monde&quot; (1928–1935) and &quot;Progrès Civique&quot;, which published some of George Orwell&#x27;s first writings. He was also literary editor for the daily newspaper &quot;l&#x27;Humanité&quot; from 1926 to 1929.

In 1934, Barbusse sent Egon Kisch to Australia to represent the International Movement Against War and Fascism as part of his work for the Comintern. The resulting unsuccessful exclusion of Egon Kisch from Australia by the conservative Australian government succeeded in energizing Communism in Australia and resulted in Kisch&#x27;s staying longer than Barbusse had intended.

An associate of Romain Rolland&#x27;s and editor of &quot;Clarté&quot;, he attempted to define a &quot;proletarian literature&quot;, akin to &quot;Proletkult&quot; and Socialist realism.

Barbusse was an Esperantist, and was honorary president of the first congress of the Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda. In 1921, he wrote an article titled &quot;Esperantista Laboristo&quot; (&quot;Esperantist worker&quot;) for &quot;Esperanto&quot; journal.

=== Support for Stalin ===
In his 1928 book &quot;Voici ce qu&#x27;on a fait de la Géorgie&quot;, Barbusse praised post-sovietization political, social, and economic conditions in Georgia and completely glossed over the brutal methods employed by Stalin which disturbed the dying Lenin, triggering a critical response from the Georgian émigré Dathico Charachidze who published in 1929 &quot;Barbusse, les Soviets et la Géorgie&quot;, with a sympathetic preface by Karl Kautsky.

In 1930, he published a book &quot;Russie&quot;, an account of year-long living in the Soviet Union which contained flattering references to Stalin.

In 1932, Barbusse agreed to write a biography of Stalin. Originally, Stalin wanted Maxim Gorky to write it, but he didn&#x27;t, and the task was handed to Barbusse; the key condition was that it would be checked and subject to editorial changes in the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, and Barbusse assured that he would break with the &quot;Trostkyist elements&quot; in the editorial of his journal &quot;Monde&quot;. It appeared in 1935 as &quot;Staline: Un monde nouveau vu à travers un homme&quot; (&quot;Stalin: A New World Seen Through the Man&quot;). Barbusse praised Stalin, whom he called in his personal notes as &quot;great comrade&quot;, as a man with &quot;the head of a scholar, with the figure of a worker, and with the dress of a simple soldier&quot; and as the only true heir of Lenin; one of the phrases of the book, &quot;Stalin is the Lenin of today&quot;, became one of the most celebrated slogans of the Stalin cult; according to Isaak Mints, the slogan was written by Stalin himself. Although Barbusse had a friendly relationship with Leon Trotsky in the middle of the 1920s, in the book he was condemned as an intriguer and a deviationist, a Menshevik at heart. Nevertheless, Aleksei Stetskii, one of the chief ideologues of the Stalin cult, was concerned by Barbusse&#x27;s description of Stalin not as &quot;the greatest theoritician of Marxism after Lenin&quot;, as he was described in the Soviet Union, but as a &quot;man of action&quot; and practice, while Trotsky still seemed as a &quot;different type of leader&quot;: the opposition between Trotsky and Stalin seemed as an opposition between Trotsky&#x27;s intellectualism and Stalin&#x27;s anti-intellectualism. The book was published in Russian in the same year.

Victor Serge, a writer and a member of the Left Opposition, met Barbusse in the 1920s and tried to make him aware of the political repression in the USSR:

After this conversation, Barbusse made Serge one of the cosponsors of &quot;Monde&quot;, but removed him from the masthead after his imprisonment.

Trotsky criticised Barbusse as representative of a &quot;pretentious ... humanitarian, lyric and pacificstical &#x27;communism&#x27;&quot;.

==Death==

While writing a second biography of Stalin in Moscow, Barbusse fell ill with pneumonia and died on 30 August 1935. His funeral drew 500,000 people and he is buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

==Legacy==
In the Spanish Civil War in December 1936 the Henri Barbusse Battalion was formed as part of the XIV International Brigade, named in honour of Henri Barbusse.

In the foreword to &quot;I Saw It Happen&quot;, a 1942 collection of eyewitness accounts of the war, Lewis Gannett wrote: &quot;We shall be hearing and reading of this war for decades to come. No one of us can yet guess who will be its Tolstoys, its Barbusses, its Remarques and its Hemingways.&quot;

The &quot;parc Henri Barbusse&quot; was the site of the Château d&#x27;Issy.

<text>Lucy Ware Hayes (née Webb; August 28, 1831 – June 25, 1889) was the wife of President Rutherford B. Hayes and served as first lady of the United States from 1877 to 1881.

Hayes was the first First Lady to have a college degree. She was also a more egalitarian hostess than previous First Ladies. An advocate for African Americans both before and after the American Civil War, she invited the first African-American professional musician to appear at the White House. She was a Past Grand of Lincoln Rebekah Lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, together with her husband.

Historians have christened her &quot;Lemonade Lucy&quot; due to her staunch support of the temperance movement; however, contrary to popular belief, she was never referred to by that nickname while living. It was her husband who banned alcohol from the White House.

Lucy Webb was born on August 28, 1831, in Chillicothe, Ohio. Her parents were Dr. James Webb and Maria Cook. She had two older brothers who both became medical doctors. Her earliest ancestor in America was Giles Webb, who emigrated to the Americas from England in the early-mid 1600s.

In 1833, Lucy&#x27;s father went to his family&#x27;s home in Lexington, Kentucky, to free 15-20 slaves he had inherited from his aunt. There was a cholera epidemic happening at the time and James cared for the sick. Soon James became infected with cholera and died. Friends of Lucy&#x27;s mother advised the family to sell the slaves rather than free them. Maria responded that she would take in washing to earn money before she would sell a slave.

Maria&#x27;s father, Isaac Cook, was a temperance advocate and he encouraged young Lucy to sign a pledge to abstain from alcohol.

The Webbs were Methodists.

== Education ==
In 1844, the Webb family moved to Delaware, Ohio. Lucy&#x27;s brothers enrolled at Ohio Wesleyan University. Although women were not allowed to study at Wesleyan, Lucy was permitted to enroll in the college prep program at the university. A term report signed by the vice-president of Ohio Wesleyan in 1845 noted that her conduct was &quot;unexceptionable&quot; (beyond reproach).

Several months later Lucy transferred to Cincinnati Wesleyan Female College and she graduated from there in 1850. Lucy was unusually well educated for a young lady of her day.

While in college, Lucy wrote essays on social and religious issues. One essay was entitled &quot;Is Traveling on the Sabbath Consistent with Christian Principles?&quot; At her commencement, she read an original essay, &quot;The Influence of Christianity on National Prosperity.&quot; Lucy appears to have been influenced by the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, writing in one essay, &quot;It is acknowledged by most persons that her (woman&#x27;s) mind is as strong as a man&#x27;s. ... Instead of being considered the slave of man, she is considered his equal in all things, and his superior in some.&quot;

== Marriage ==
Lucy first met Rutherford B. Hayes at Ohio Wesleyan University. At the time, Lucy was fourteen years old and Rutherford was twenty-three. Rutherford&#x27;s mother was hopeful that the two would find a connection, but at this point Rutherford considered Lucy &quot;not quite old enough to fall in love with.&quot;

In 1850, Rutherford&#x27;s older sister Fanny Platt encouraged him to visit with Lucy again. That summer Lucy was 19, and she and Rutherford were members of the same wedding party. Rutherford was so taken with Lucy that he gave her the prize (a gold ring) that he had found in the wedding cake.

In 1851, Rutherford wrote in his diary, &quot;I guess I am a great deal in love with L(ucy). ... Her low sweet voice ... her soft rich eyes.&quot; Rutherford also praised her intelligence and character, &quot;She sees at a glance what others study upon, but will not, perhaps study what she is unable to see at a flash. She is a genuine woman, right from instinct and impulse rather than judgment and reflection.&quot;

After the couple became engaged, Lucy returned the wedding cake ring to Rutherford. He wore that ring for the rest of his life.

Lucy and Rutherford were married at her mother&#x27;s house in Cincinnati in a simple ceremony on December 30, 1852.

They spent their honeymoon at Fanny&#x27;s house in Columbus, Ohio, before returning to Cincinnati. In Columbus, Rutherford argued a case before the Ohio Supreme Court while Fanny and Lucy developed a close friendship. The two women attended lectures and concerts together. Lucy and Fanny once went to a lecture by noted suffragette Lucy Stone. Lucy Hayes agreed with Stone that a reform in the wage scale for women was long overdue, and that &quot;violent&quot; methods sometimes served the purpose of calling attention to the need for reforms. Lucy noted that Stone took the position that &quot;whatever is proper for a man to do is equally right for a woman provided she has the power.&quot; According to Emily Apt Geer of the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center, &quot;if the influence of the bright and aggressive Fanny Platt had extended over a normal lifetime, Lucy Hayes might have become active in the woman&#x27;s rights movement.&quot; Fanny Platt died in childbirth during the winter of 1856. Lucy named her sixth child and only daughter Fanny in memory of her sister-in-law and friend.

The couple had eight children: Birchard Austin (1853–1926), Webb Cook (1856–1934), Rutherford Platt (1858–1927), Joseph Thompson (1861–1863), George Crook (1864–1866), Fanny (1867–1950), Scott Russell (1871–1923), and Manning Force (1873–1874).

Rutherford had previously thought the abolition of slavery was too radical an action. But, influenced by Lucy&#x27;s anti-slavery sentiments, soon after their marriage Rutherford began defending runaway slaves in court who had crossed into Ohio from Kentucky.

After Lincoln&#x27;s election in 1860, Lucy and Rutherford joined the presidential train from Indianapolis to Cincinnati.

== Civil War ==
When the first news of the firing on Fort Sumter reached Cincinnati, Lucy was in favor of the war. She felt that if she had been at Fort Sumter with a garrison of women, there might not have been a surrender. Her enthusiasm encouraged Rutherford to enlist as a major in the Twenty-third Ohio Volunteer Infantry. As often as she could, Lucy – sometimes with her mother and children – visited Rutherford in the field. She often assisted her brother, Dr. Joe Webb, in caring for the sick.

In September 1862, Rutherford was injured in battle in Middleton, Maryland. Thinking he was hospitalized in Washington due to a paperwork error, Lucy rushed to the nation&#x27;s capital. She eventually found Hayes in Maryland and after two weeks of convalescence, the Hayeses returned to Ohio, traveling by train with other wounded troops.

After Rutherford returned to his regiment, Lucy became a regular visitor in Rutherford&#x27;s Army camp. She ministered to the wounded, cheered the homesick, and comforted the dying. She also secured supplies from Northern civilians to better equip the Union soldiers. Lucy was often joined by her mother at camp and her brother Joe was the regiment&#x27;s surgeon. The men of the 23rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry affectionately nicknamed her &quot;Mother Lucy&quot; for her service. At one point, twenty-year-old William McKinley spent hours tending a campfire because Lucy sat nearby.

The couple&#x27;s infant son, Joe, died while the family was at an Army camp.

== Congress ==
While Rutherford served in Congress, Lucy joined him in Washington for its winter social season. Lucy regularly sat in the gallery of the House to listen to congressional debates. She often wore a checkered shawl so her husband could spot her.

In 1866, the Hayeses and other congressional couples visited the scene of race riots in Memphis and New Orleans to see the damage that had been done.

Lucy also worked for the welfare of children and veterans. The couple&#x27;s nearly two-year-old son George died during this period.

== First Lady of Ohio ==
While Rutherford was Governor of Ohio, Lucy often accompanied her husband on visits to prisons, correctional institutions for boys and girls, hospitals for the mentally ill, and facilities for the deaf and mute.

In 1870, Lucy and her friends established a soldiers&#x27; orphans home in Xenia, Ohio.

Rutherford initially chose not to run for a third term as governor and in 1873, the family moved to Spiegel Grove. Rutherford&#x27;s uncle, Sardis Birchard, had built the house years earlier with them in mind. This house would later become the first presidential library.

In 1875, Rutherford ran for and won a third term as governor. The hard fought victory brought Rutherford to national prominence. In June 1876, he was nominated for president by the Republican party.

Lucy played an active role in her husband&#x27;s administration and lobbied the state legislature to provide more funding to schools, orphanages, and insane asylums.

Their youngest child, named for General Manning F. Force, was born in 1873 and died in 1874, while the Hayes family lived at Spiegel Grove.

== First Lady of the United States ==
The presidential election of 1876 was one of the most controversial in the country&#x27;s history. Hayes was not declared the winner until March 1, 1877, five months after Election Day. The declaration was so delayed that the Hayes family boarded a train to Washington without being sure if Rutherford was the president elect. The next morning, March 2, they were awakened near Harrisburg to receive the news that Congress had finally declared Hayes President of the United States.

In the early days of Rutherford&#x27;s administration, the North&#x27;s military occupation of the South and the Reconstruction era came to an end.

Restoration funds for the White House were unavailable when they first moved in, so Lucy retrieved old furniture from the attic and rearranged things to hide the holes in the carpets and drapes. According to executive assistant William Cook, &quot;any really good things owed their preservation to this energetic lady.&quot;

By the time of Rutherford&#x27;s inauguration, the position of First Lady was an increasingly prominent one. There were growing numbers of female journalists in the late nineteenth century. Female reporters devoted much of their time and energy to covering the most visible woman in America: the First Lady. The attention began after Rutherford&#x27;s inauguration, with the &quot;New York Herald&quot; writing &quot;Mrs. Hayes is a most attractive and lovable woman. She is the life and soul of every party ... For the mother of so many children she looks ... youthful.&quot;

Lucy Hayes was the first wife of a President to be widely referred to as the First Lady by the press, when Mary C. Ames referred to the &quot;First Lady&quot; in a newspaper column about the inauguration. Advances in printing technology meant that a wide audience saw sketches of the new First Lady from the 1877 inauguration.

At this time it was not the custom for a president&#x27;s wife to have a staff of social assistants and, unlike some previous First Ladies, Lucy had no adult daughters to help shoulder the workload. Lucy depended on nieces, cousins, and daughters of friends to help with social events, and these young ladies also helped enliven the Hayes White House.

Lucy was fond of animals. A cat, a bird, two dogs, and a goat joined the Hayes family in residence at the White House.

In 1879, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Lucy&#x27;s dress at the White House New Year&#x27;s Reception, &quot;The dress of Mrs. Hayes was at once simple and elegant ... With accustomed good taste she wore no jewelry, and the white plume in her black hair fell gracefully in drooping folds.&quot;

At the first official state dinner on April 19, 1877, to honor Russian Grand Duke Alexis and Grand Duke Constantine, a &quot;full quota&quot; of wine was served. But soon after this, President Hayes made it known that there would be no more alcoholic beverages served at future White House functions. The six wine glasses laid out at each place setting had angered temperance advocates and Rutherford believed the Republican Party needed the temperance vote. The decision was Rutherford&#x27;s, although Lucy may have influenced him. Although the Hayes family were generally teetotal, they had previously served alcoholic beverages to guests at their home in Ohio. But because Lucy was a known teetotaler (Hayes sometimes had a &quot;schoppen&quot; of beer when he visited Cincinnati) she was blamed for the dry White House. Regardless of her teetotaler status however, along with her husband they privately opposed Prohibition. They believed controlling alcohol consumption through education and example rather than force was more effective. Yet Hayes understood the political power becoming a teetotaler gave him by ensuring dry Republicans stayed within the party. He believed this stance on alcohol would only effect them at the White House and could still enjoy in private. This political move earned them more attention than they had originally thought. As a mother herself, Lucy stood as a key figure in the temperance movement as setting an example for how women could set moral examples for their families She understood the power her role possessed and announced to the public that, “I have young sons who have never tasted liquor, they shall not receive from my hand, or with the sanction that its use in the family would give, the first taste of what might prove their ruin. What I wish for my own sons I must do for the sons of other mothers.”
Later, when President Garfield brought alcohol back to the White House, the Hayeses predicted it would cause a split within the Republican Party. 

In general, Lucy had a more casual style that was reflected in the receptions she held during Washington&#x27;s winter social season. During the holidays, she invited staff members and their families to Thanksgiving dinner and opened presents with them on Christmas morning. The White House telegraph operator and secretaries were included in the Thanksgiving group. The group was so large it took three turkeys and a roast pig to feed them all. Lucy was generally kind towards the White House staff, she also allowed White House servants to take time off to attend school.

On December 31, 1877, Rutherford and Lucy celebrated their silver wedding anniversary in the White House.

The most significant change made to the White House during the Hayes Administration were the installation of bathrooms with running water and the addition of a crude wall telephone. Lucy was the first First Lady to use a typewriter, a telephone, and a phonograph while in office, and was also the first to enjoy a permanent system of running water in the White House.

Lucy preferred to enlarge the greenhouse conservatories rather than to undertake extensive redecoration of the White House. The billiard-room, which connected the house with the conservatories, was converted into an attractive greenhouse and the billiard table consigned to the basement. Shuttered windows in the State Dining Room could be opened for dinner guests to look into the conservatories. Some Americans considered the billiard table as either a gambling device or a rich man&#x27;s toy, and the Hayes were glad to get it out of sight.

Every day, flowers were brought in from the greenhouses to decorate the White House. Additional bouquets were sent to friends and Washington hospitals. Greenhouse upkeep made up one fourth of the White House&#x27;s household expenditures under Hayes.

Looking to celebrate American flora and fauna, Lucy commissioned Theodore R. Davis to design new china for the White House. After using the pieces, Washington hostess Clover Adams complained that it was hard to eat soup calmly with a coyote springing from behind a pine tree in the bowl.

Music was important to Lucy and she held informal &quot;sings&quot; upstairs in the family quarters. Lucy sang and played the guitar, and was assisted by the talents of friends and family. At times, Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz played the piano while Vice President William A. Wheeler, Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman, and his brother, Gen. William T. Sherman, joined in singing gospel songs.
Lucy frequently accompanied her husband on trips around the country. Rutherford travelled so much that the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; nicknamed him &quot;Rutherford the Rover.&quot; In 1877, The couple undertook a tour of the South in hopes of improving national unity. The &quot;Richmond Dispatch&quot; reported that Lucy &quot;won the admiration of people where she has been.&quot;

In 1878, Lucy toured Philadelphia without her husband. She visited the Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia School of Design for Women, and the Woman&#x27;s Medical College, as well as several schools and orphanages. This was the first documented instance of a First Lady following a public schedule independent of the President.

In 1880, Lucy was the first presidential spouse to visit the West Coast while her husband was President. While on their Western tour, Lucy and Rutherford met with Sarah Winnemucca. Lucy was moved to tears by Winnemucca&#x27;s impassioned speech for Native American lands.

Lucy&#x27;s compassion and sincerity endeared her to Washingtonians. She regularly visited the National Deaf Mute College (today Gallaudet University) and the Hampton Institute, where she sponsored a scholarship for a student. She continued to show concern for the poor by contributing generously to Washington charities. In January 1880 alone, Lucy and Rutherford gave $990 (~$ in ) to help the poor in Washington.

However, Lucy rejected pleas from groups requesting her public support, committing herself instead to serving as a moral example to the nation. Rutherford once commented, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how much influence Mrs. Hayes has with Congress, but she has great influence with me.&quot;

As First Lady, Lucy advocated for the completion of the Washington Monument.

When the children of Washington were banned from rolling their Easter eggs on the Capitol grounds, they were invited to use the White House lawn on the Monday following Easter.

Lucy was a friend to other First Ladies. During her tenure as First Lady, Lucy visited with Sarah Polk and journeyed to Martha Washington&#x27;s Mount Vernon and Dolley Madison&#x27;s Montpelier. She asked Julia Tyler to help officiate at a White House reception and was friendly with former First Lady Julia Grant. She was also friendly with future First Ladies including Lucretia Garfield, Ida McKinley, and Helen Herron Taft.

When portraits of past presidents were commissioned for the White House, Lucy insisted that paintings of both Martha Washington and Dolley Madison also grace the walls of the presidential mansion. Lucy&#x27;s own official portrait by Daniel Huntington was commissioned by the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union.

On his 48th birthday, Rutherford wrote to Lucy, &quot;My life with you has been so happy--so successful--so beyond reasonable anticipations, that I think of you with a loving gratitude that I do not know how to express.&quot;

Rutherford kept his promise to serve only one term, the Hayes family returned to their Fremont, Ohio, home, Spiegel Grove, in 1881.

== Views on race ==
Lucy Hayes was an advocate for African Americans both before and after the Civil War. She remained in contact with her family&#x27;s former slaves, and employed some. Winnie Monroe, a former slave freed by Lucy&#x27;s mother Maria, eventually moved to the White House with the Hayes family as a cook and nurse. Later, Lucy would encourage Winnie&#x27;s daughter Mary Monroe to attend Oberlin.

The Hayes were so known for their sympathy towards African Americans that a month after they returned to Cincinnati from Columbus, a black baby was left on their doorstep.

In 1861, Lucy wrote to her husband, &quot;if a contraband [runaway slave] is in Camp--- don&#x27;t let the 23rd Regiment be disgraced by returning [him or her].&quot;

As First Lady, Lucy invited African-American performers to the White House. In 1878, Marie Selika Williams (1849–1937), also known as Madame Selika, appeared at the White House. Introduced by Frederick Douglass, Madame Selika was the first African-American professional musician to appear at the White House.

== Views on temperance ==
Known as a teetotaler, Lucy had signed a pledge to abstain from alcohol at a young age.

The White House had a ban on alcoholic beverages during Rutherford&#x27;s term, but historians generally credit Rutherford with the final decision to ban alcohol. Lucy actually opposed prohibition. She preferred to persuade rather than prevent and did not condemn those who used alcohol in moderation.

Lucy was not a member of any temperance groups. She resisted attempts by the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) to enlist her as a leader out of fear of creating political fallout for her husband by association with the controversial cause.

The WCTU paid for a portrait of Lucy by Daniel Huntington before she left the White House.

The first written references to &quot;Lemonade Lucy&quot; don&#x27;t turn up until the 20th century, which didn&#x27;t begin until 11 years after Lucy&#x27;s death in 1889, according to Tom Culbertson of the Hayes Center. Hundreds of articles, cartoons, and poems chronicled and parodied her opposition to drinking. Historian Carl Anthony &quot;suggests a reason the legend of Lemonade Lucy might have become so popular with historians of the early 20th century, when there was greater moral stigma associated with alcohol consumption&quot;.

== Views on suffrage ==
As a young woman, Lucy expressed opinions that suggested she was pro-suffrage, but she did not join any of the prominent suffrage groups of the day. Two of Lucy&#x27;s aunts were involved in the suffrage movement.

Many historians believe that had her sister-in-law Fanny Platt lived longer, Lucy would have become a committed advocate for women&#x27;s suffrage.

== Later life ==

Back in Ohio after leaving the White House, Lucy joined the Woman&#x27;s Relief Corps (founded 1883), taught a Sunday School class, attended reunions of the 23rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and entertained distinguished visitors to Spiegel Grove. Lucy also became national president of the newly formed Woman&#x27;s Home Missionary Society of the Methodist Church. As president, she called attention to the plight of the urban poor and disenfranchised African-Americans in the South. She also spoke out against Mormon polygamy. However, when asked by Susan B. Anthony to send delegates from the Home Missionary Society to a meeting of the International Council of Women, Lucy declined.

Hayes spent her last eight years at Spiegel Grove. A few days after suffering a stroke, she died, at age 57, on June 25, 1889. Flags across the country were flown at half-mast in her honor.

Rutherford died three and a half years later and was buried beside his wife. In 1915, their remains were moved to Spiegel Grove. Below them their dog Gryme and two horses named Old Whitey and Old Ned are buried also.

== Legacy ==
Lucy Hayes served as First Lady during an important transitional era in nineteenth-century American history. Major economic trends of the 1870s included the rise of national businesses, shifts in centers of agriculture, and the development of a favorable balance of trade for the United States. The accelerated movement of people from rural to urban areas also brought about great alterations in social life.

Emily Apt Geer explained,

Spiegel Grove is operated by the Ohio History Connection and is open to the public.

Hayes is honored with a life-size bronze sculpture inside the Cuyahoga County Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument in Cleveland, Ohio.

<text>Oology (; also oölogy) is a branch of ornithology studying bird eggs, nests and breeding behaviour. The word is derived from the Greek &quot;oion&quot;, meaning egg. Oology can also refer to the hobby of collecting wild birds&#x27; eggs, sometimes called egg collecting, birdnesting or egging, which is now illegal in many jurisdictions.

==History==

===As a science===

Oology became increasingly popular in Britain and the United States during the 1800s. Observing birds from afar was difficult because high-quality binoculars were not readily available. Thus it was often more practical to shoot the birds or collect their eggs. While the collection of the eggs of wild birds by amateurs was considered a respectable scientific pursuit in the 19th century and early 20th century, from the mid 20th century onwards it was increasingly regarded as being a hobby rather than a scientific discipline.

In the 1960s, the naturalist Derek Ratcliffe compared peregrine falcon eggs from historical collections with more recent egg-shell samples, and was able to demonstrate a decline in shell thickness. This was found to cause the link between the use by farmers of pesticides such as DDT and dieldrin, and the decline of British populations of birds of prey.

===As a hobby===
Egg collecting was still popular in the early 20th century, even as its scientific value became less prominent. Egg collectors built large collections and traded with one another. Frequently, collectors would go to extreme lengths to obtain eggs of rare birds. For example, Charles Bendire was willing to have his teeth broken to remove a rare egg that became stuck in his mouth. He had placed the egg in his mouth while climbing down a tree.

In 1922, the British Oological Association was founded by Baron Rothschild, a prominent naturalist, and the Reverend Francis Jourdain; the group was renamed the Jourdain Society after Jourdain&#x27;s death in 1940. Rothschild and Jourdain founded it as a breakaway group after egg collecting by members of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union was denounced by Earl Buxton at a meeting of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.

==Poaching laws==
===In the UK===
Legislation, such as the Protection of Birds Act 1954 and Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 in the United Kingdom, has made it impossible to collect wild birds&#x27; eggs legally. In the United Kingdom, it is only legal to possess a wild-bird&#x27;s egg if it was taken before 1954, or with a permit for scientific research; selling wild birds&#x27; eggs, regardless of their age, is illegal.

However, the practice of egg collecting, or egging, continues as an underground or illegal activity in the UK and elsewhere. In the 1980s and 1990s, the fines allowed by the law were only a moderate deterrent to some egg collectors. However, the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 allowed for six months&#x27; imprisonment for the possession of the eggs of wild birds and, since it came into force, a number of individuals have been imprisoned, both for possessing and for attempting to buy egg collections. The Jourdain Society continued to meet although membership dwindled after 1994, when a dinner of the society was raided by police, assisted by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). This resulted in six members being convicted and fined.

Despite this, some of those who engage in egg collecting show considerable recidivism in their activity. One, Colin Watson, was convicted six times before he fell to his death in 2006, while attempting to climb to a nest high up in a tree. While the threat of imprisonment after 2000 encouraged some to give up egg collecting, others were not deterred. One individual has been convicted ten times and imprisoned twice. As recently as 2018, a man was imprisoned for amassing a collection of 5000 eggs, after previously being imprisoned in 2005. Another man was convicted of possessing 200 eggs in 2021.

The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has been particularly active in fighting illegal egg collection and maintains an investigative unit that collects intelligence on egg collectors and assists police in mounting prosecutions on them, in addition to investigating other wildlife crimes. At one point, RSPB staff were being trained by soldiers from the Brigade of Gurkhas in camouflage skills and in surveillance, map and radio techniques, to better enable them to guard nests of rare birds.

In the United Kingdom, to avoid the possibility of prosecution, owners of old egg collections must retain sufficient proof to show, on the balance of probabilities, that the eggs pre-date 1981. However owners of genuinely old collections are unlikely to face prosecution as experienced investigators and prosecutors are able to distinguish them from recently collected eggs. It is illegal to sell a collection, regardless of the eggs&#x27; age, so old collections may only be disposed of by giving the eggs away or by destroying them. Museums are reluctant to accept donations of collections without reliable collection data (i.e. date and place that they were collected) that gives them scientific value. Also, museums no longer put egg collections on public display.

===In the US===
In the United States, the collection and possession of wild bird eggs is also restricted, and in some cases is a criminal act. Depending on the species, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Lacey Act, the Endangered Species Act, or other laws may apply.

==Collecting==

===Methods===
When collecting eggs, normally the whole clutch of eggs is taken. Because eggs will rot if the contents are left inside, they must be &quot;blown&quot; to remove the contents. Although collectors will take eggs at all stages of incubation, freshly laid eggs are much easier to blow, usually through a small, inconspicuous hole drilled with a specialized drill through the side of the eggshell. Egg blowing is also done with domestic bird&#x27;s eggs for the hobby of egg decorating.

==Oology related publications==

Numerous books, and at one point a journal, have been published on egg collecting and identification:
*Thomas Mayo Brewer, (1814–80), an American ornithologist, wrote most of the biographical sketches in the &quot;History of North American Birds&quot;, by Baird, Brewer, and Ridgway (1874–84). He has been called &quot;the father of American oölogy&quot;. He wrote &quot;North American Oölogy&quot; which was partially published in 1857.
*William Chapman Hewitson, &quot;Illustrations of Eggs of British Birds&quot;, (third edition, London, 1856).
*Archibald James Campbell, &quot;Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds: Embracing Papers On &quot;Oology of Australian Birds,&quot; Read Before the Field Naturalists&#x27; Club of Victoria, Supplemented by Other Notes &amp; Memoranda; Also, an Appendix of Several Outs - Nesting, Shooting Etc.&quot;, (A. J. Campbell, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 1883) (Cover title: &quot;Oology of Australian Birds&quot;. Ferguson no. 7870)
*Oliver Davie, &quot;Nests and Eggs of North American Birds&quot;, (fifth edition, Columbus, 1898).
*Alfred Newton, &quot;Dictionary of Birds&quot;, (New York, 1893–96).

==In popular culture==
* Chapter 7 of P.G. Wodehouse&#x27;s novel &quot;The Pothunters&quot; describes a student&#x27;s interest in hunting for the eggs of a water wagtail.
* A 2007 episode of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; surrounds illegal oology.
* In 2017, Artist Andy Holden and father, ornithologist Peter Holden, staged a series of exhibitions titled &quot;Natural Selection&quot;, staged by Artangel, which took place at Bristol Museum, Towner Gallery in Eastbourne, and Leeds Art Gallery, in which they explored the &#x27;social history&#x27; of oology in Britain. The exhibition included a vast recreation of an illegal egg collection, as well as a film narrating the history of egg collecting in Britain.
