<doc id="69982" wikidata="Q2958359" url="?curid=69982" title="Charles">
<text>Charles is a masculine given name predominantly found in English and French speaking countries. It is from the French form &quot;Charles&quot; of the Proto-Germanic name (in runic alphabet) or &quot;*karilaz&quot; (in Latin alphabet), whose meaning was &quot;free man&quot;. The Old English descendant of this word was &quot;Ċearl&quot; or &quot;Ċeorl&quot;, as the name of King Cearl of Mercia, that disappeared after the Norman conquest of England.

The name was notably borne by Charlemagne (Charles the Great), and was at the time Latinized as &quot;Karolus&quot; (as in &quot;Vita Karoli Magni&quot;), later also as &quot;Carolus&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name&#x27;s etymology is a Common Germanic noun &quot;*karilaz&quot; meaning &quot;free man&quot;, which survives in English as (&lt; Old English &quot;ċeorl&quot;), which developed its deprecating sense in the Middle English period.

Some Germanic languages, for example Dutch and German, have retained the word in two separate senses. In the particular case of Dutch, &quot;Karel&quot; refers to the given name, whereas the noun &quot;kerel&quot; means &quot;a bloke, fellow, man&quot;.

In the form &quot;Charles&quot;, the initial spelling &quot;ch-&quot; corresponds to the palatalization of the Latin group &quot;ca-&quot; to [tʃa] in Central Old French (Francien) and the final &quot;-s&quot; to the former subjective case (cas sujet) of masculine names in Old French like in Giles or James (&lt; Latin &quot;-us&quot;, see Spanish/ Portuguese &quot;Carlos&quot;).

According to Julius Pokorny, the historical linguist and Indo-Europeanist, the root meaning of Charles is &quot;old man&quot;, from Indo-European *, where the ĝ is a palatal consonant, meaning &quot;to rub; to be old; grain.&quot; An old man has been worn away and is now grey with age.

In some Slavic languages, the name &quot;Drago&quot; (and variants: &quot;Dragomir&quot;, &quot;Dragoslav&quot;, etc., all based on the root &quot;drag&quot; &#x27;dear&#x27;) has been used as an equivalent for &quot;Charles&quot; (&quot;Karel&quot;, etc.). This is based on the false etymology deriving &quot;Carl&quot; from Latin &quot;carus&quot; &#x27;dear&#x27;. Examples are the Slovene politician Karel Dežman (1821–1889), also known as &quot;Dragotin Dežman&quot;, and the Slovene historian Dragotin Lončar (1876–1954), baptized &quot;Carl&quot;.

==History==

===Early Middle Ages===
The name is atypical for Germanic names as it is not composed of two elements, but simply a noun meaning &quot;(free) man&quot;. This meaning of &quot;ceorl&quot; contrasts with &quot;eorl&quot; (Old Norse &quot;jarl&quot;) &quot;nobleman&quot; on one hand and with &quot;þeow&quot; (Old Norse &quot;þræll&quot;) &quot;bondsman, slave&quot; on the other. As such it would not seem a likely candidate for the name of a Germanic king, but it is attested as such with Cearl of Mercia (), the first Mercian king mentioned by Bede in his &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;. It is a peculiarity of the Anglo-Saxon royal names that many of the rulers of the earliest period (6th to 7th centuries) have monothematic (simplex) names, while the standard dithematic (compounded) names become almost universal from the 8th century. Compare the name of King Mul of Kent (7th century) which simply translates to &quot;mule&quot;.

Charles Martel, the son of Pepin of Herstal and Alpaida, was either illegitimate or the product of a bigamous marriage, and therefore indeed a &quot;free man&quot;, but not of noble rank. After his victory at the Battle of Soissons (718), Charles Martel styled himself Duke of the Franks. Charles&#x27; eldest son was named Carloman (754), a rare example of the element &quot;carl-&quot; occurring in a compound name. 
The &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot; names an earlier &quot;Carloman&quot; as the father of Pepin of Landen, and thus the great-great-grandfather of the Charles Martel. This would place the name &quot;Carloman&quot; in the 6th century, and open the possibility that the Frankish name &quot;Carl&quot; may originate as a short form of &quot;Carloman&quot;. The only other compound name with the &quot;Carl-&quot; prefix is &quot;Carlofred&quot; (&quot;Carlefred&quot;), attested in the 7th century; as a suffix, it occurs in the rare names &quot;Altcarl&quot; and &quot;Gundecarl&quot; (9th and 11th centuries, respectively).

Charlemagne (742–814) was Charles Martel&#x27;s grandson. After Charlemagne&#x27;s reign, the name became irrevocably connected with him and his Carolingian dynasty.
After Charlemagne, the name Charles (&quot;Karol&quot;) became even the standard word for &quot;king&quot; in Slavic (Czech and Slovak &quot;král&quot;, Polish &quot;król&quot;; South Slavic &quot;kral&quot; крал, &quot;krȃlj&quot; краљ; Russian король), Baltic (Latvian &quot;karalis&quot;, Lithuanian &quot;karalius&quot;) and Hungarian (&quot;király&quot;).

Charlemagne&#x27;s son Charles the Younger died without issue, but the name resurfaces repeatedly within the 9th-century Carolingian family tree, so with Charles the Bald (823–877), Charles the Fat (839–888) Charles of Provence (845–863), Charles the Child (847/848–866) and Charles the Simple (879–929).

===Later Middle Ages and Early Modern history===
The name survives into the High Middle Ages (Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine; Charles, Count of Valois; Charles I, Count of Flanders (Charles the Good, beatified in 1882); Charles I of Naples; Charles I of Hungary). Karl Sverkersson was a king of Sweden in the 12th century, counted as &quot;Charles VII&quot; due to a genealogical fiction of the 17th century by Charles &quot;IX&quot;, but actually the first king of Sweden with this name.

Charles resurfaces as a royal name in Germany with Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor (1316–1378, counted as &quot;the fourth&quot; after Charlemagne, Charles the Bald and Charles the Fat) and in France with Charles IV of France (1294–1328, &quot;the fourth&quot; after Charlemagne, Charles the Bald and Charles the Simple), and becomes comparatively widespread in the Late Middle Ages (Charles I, Duke of Savoy, Charles III, Duke of Savoy).

Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (1500–1558) gives rise to a tradition of Charlses in Habsburg Spain (Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, Charles II of Spain, Charles III of Spain, Charles IV of Spain).

The numbering scheme for the kings of Sweden was continued in modern times with Charles X, Charles XI, Charles XII, Charles XIII, Charles XIV and Charles XV.

Charles I of England (1600–1649) is followed by Charles II of England (1630–1685). The Province of Carolina is named during the rule of Charles II, after Charles I.

Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine (1661–1742).

===Modern history===
Carlism is a political movement in Spain seeking the establishment of a separate line of the Bourbon family on the Spanish throne. This line descended from Infante Carlos, Count of Molina (1788–1855), and was founded due to dispute over the succession laws and widespread dissatisfaction with the Alfonsine line of the House of Bourbon. The movement was at its strongest in the 1830s, causing the Carlist Wars, and had a revival following Spain&#x27;s defeat in the Spanish–American War in 1898, and lasted until the end of the Franco regime in 1975 as a social and political force

Charles Floyd (1782–1804) was the only casualty in the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Charles DeRudio (1832–1910) was an Italian aristocrat, would-be assassin of Napoleon III, and later a career U.S. Army officer who fought in the 7th U.S. Cavalry at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Charles Albert Varnum (1849–1936) was the commander of the scouts in the Little Bighorn Campaign and received the Medal of Honor for his actions in a conflict following the Battle of Wounded Knee.
&quot;Lonesome&quot; Charley Reynolds (1842–1876) was a scout in the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment who was killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.

&quot;Carl&quot; has been a very popular male given name in the United States during the late 19th to early 20th centuries, consistently ranking in the top 30 male given names in the US from 1887 to 1938, and remaining among the top 100 until the 1980s, but since declining below rank 500. &quot;Charles&quot; has always been among the top 100 names in the U.S. since records started in 1880. In addition, it is among the top 100 names given in England and Wales; the current King of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, Charles III, is a notable bearer of the name. In 2022, it was the 26th most popular name given to boys in Canada.

==Derived feminine names==
Caroline and Charlotte are feminine given names derived from &quot;Carl&quot;.

Charlotte is late medieval, e.g. Charlotte of Savoy (1441–1483), Charlotte of Cyprus (1444–1487). It was introduced to Britain in the 17th century, and gave rise to hypocorisms such as &quot;Lottie, Tottie, Totty&quot;.

Caroline is early modern, e.g. Caroline of Ansbach (1683–1737). It has given rise to numerous variations, such as &quot; Carlyn, Carolina, Carolyn, Karolyn, Carolin, Karolina, Karoline, Karolina, Carolien&quot;, as well as hypocorisms, such as &quot;Callie, Carol, Carrie&quot;, etc.

Another derived feminine name is Carla (Bulgarian, Catalan, Dutch, English, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish), a name which dates from early Italy.

<text>Murray Bail (born 22 September 1941) is an Australian writer of novels, short stories and non-fiction. In 1980 he shared the Age Book of the Year award for his novel &quot;Homesickness&quot;.

He was born in Adelaide, South Australia, a son of Cyril Lindsay Bail (1914–1966). He has lived most of his life in Australia except for sojourns in India (1968–70) and England and Europe (1970–74). He lives in Sydney.

He was trustee of the National Gallery of Australia from 1976 to 1981 and wrote a book on Australian artist Ian Fairweather.

A portrait of Bail by the artist Fred Williams is hung in the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra. The portrait was done while both Williams and Bail were Council members of the National Gallery of Australia.

==Career==
He is most well known for &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, which won the Miles Franklin Award in 1999. His other work includes the novels &quot;Homesickness&quot;, which was a joint winner of The Age Book of the Year in 1980, and &quot;Holden&#x27;s Performance&quot;, another award-winner. Reviewers recently compared Bail&#x27;s &quot;Notebooks 1970-2003&quot; with Proust, Gide and Valéry&#x27;s. &quot;The Pages&quot; [2008] was shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Award. His latest novel, &quot;The Voyage&quot;, was released in November 2012.

Laurie Clancy suggests that Bail is, with Peter Carey and Frank Moorhouse, one of the chief innovators in Australian short story writing, and that he was part of its revival in the 1970s. He notes that Bail is particularly interested in the relationship between language and reality, and that this is evident in his early short stories. About the story ‘Portrait of Electricity’ from the collection &quot;Contemporary Portraits and Other Stories&quot; (1975), Clancy says that &quot;the story displays the strange mixture of surrealist fantasy and broad satire of Australian mores that characterizes all of Bail&#x27;s work&quot;.

After early success with short fiction, Bail turned to the novel as a form commensurate with his vision of life&#x27;s complexity, which emerges in all its perplexing intricacy in &quot;Homesickness&quot;. This first novel describes the unscripted, global travels of a group of Australian tourists to diverse museums, real and imaginary. His next book, &quot;Holden&#x27;s Performance&quot;, dealt more overtly with issues of national identity and the diverse forces that shape individual character. His later novels explored related issues in terms of a key binary: in &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, these are empirical knowledge and imagination, in &quot;The Pages&quot; psychology and philosophy. Bail prides himself, rightly, on being a novelist of ideas, who is determined to be audacious in his creations and to challenge reader expectations and complacency.

The standard study of his work is Michael Ackland&#x27;s &quot;The Experimental Fiction of Murray Bail&quot; (2012).

==Personal life==
Bail is the second of four children. His father worked in the tramways and his mother was a homemaker. He attended Norwood Technical High School.

Bail started working in advertising agencies in Adelaide and Melbourne. He and his first wife moved to India in 1968, where he worked in an advertising agency in Bombay. He contracted amoebic dysentery on his travels, and went to London for treatment at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases. There he decided the novel he had written in India was worthless, so he threw it in the garbage. He remained in London for five years, the first year on the dole, before returning to Australia in 1975.

<doc id="70011" wikidata="Q189901" url="?curid=70011" title="Argos, Peloponnese">
<text>Argos (; ; ) is a city and former municipality in Argolis, Peloponnese, Greece and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, and the oldest in Europe. It is the largest city in Argolis and a major center in the same prefecture, having nearly twice the population of the prefectural capital, Nafplio.

Since the 2011 local government reform it has been part of the municipality of Argos-Mykines, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 138.138 km2. It is from Nafplion, which was its historic harbour. A settlement of great antiquity, Argos has been continuously inhabited as at least a substantial village for the past 7,000 years.

A resident of the city of Argos is known as an Argive ( , ; ). However, this term is also used to refer to those ancient Greeks generally who assaulted the city of Troy during the Trojan War; the term is more widely applied by the Homeric bards.

Numerous ancient monuments can be found in the city today. Agriculture is the mainstay of the local economy.

== Etymology ==
There are several proposed etyma. The name is associated with the legendary Argus, the third king of the city in ancient times, who renamed it after himself, thus replacing its older name Phoronikon Asty (, &quot;Citadel of Phoroneus&quot;). Both the personal name and placename are linked to the word (), which meant &quot;white&quot; or &quot;shining&quot;; possibly, this had to do with the visual impression given of the Argolic plain during harvest time. According to Strabo, the name could have even originated from the word () &#x27;field&#x27; by metathesis of the consonants.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Herodotus first recorded the myth of the traditional story of Argos being the origin of the ancient Macedonian royal house of the Argead dynasty (Greek: Ἀργεάδαι, Argeádai) of Philip II and Alexander the Great. As a strategic location on the fertile plain of Argolis, Argos was a major stronghold during the Mycenaean era. In classical times, Argos was a powerful rival of Sparta for dominance over the Peloponnese, but was eventually shunned by other Greek city-states after remaining neutral during the Greco-Persian Wars. 


There is evidence of continuous settlement in the area starting with a village about 7,000 years ago in the late Neolithic, located on the foot of Aspida hill. Since that time, Argos has been continually inhabited at the same geographical location. And while the name &quot;Argos&quot; is generally accepted to have a Hellenic Indo-European etymology, &quot;Larissa&quot; is generally held to derive from a Pre-Greek substrate.

The city is located at a rather propitious area, among Nemea, Corinth and Arcadia. It also benefitted from its proximity to lake Lerna, which, at the time, was at a distance of one kilometre from the south end of Argos.

===Mycenaean Argos===
Argos was a major stronghold of Mycenaean times, and along with the neighbouring acropolis of Mycenae and Tiryns became a very early settlement because of its commanding positions in the midst of the fertile plain of Argolis.

===Archaic Argos===
Argos experienced its greatest period of expansion and power under the energetic 7th century BC ruler King Pheidon. Under Pheidon, Argos regained sway over the cities of the Argolid and challenged Sparta&#x27;s dominance of the Peloponnese. Spartan dominance is thought to have been interrupted following the Battle of Hyssiae in 669–668 BC, in which Argive troops defeated the Spartans in a hoplite battle. During the time of its greatest power, the city boasted a pottery and bronze sculpturing school, pottery workshops, tanneries and clothes producers. Moreover, at least 25 celebrations took place in the city, in addition to a regular local products exhibition. A sanctuary dedicated to Hera was also found at the same spot where the monastery of Panagia Katekrymeni is located today. Pheidon also extended Argive influence throughout Greece, taking control of the Olympic Games away from the citizens of Elis and appointing himself organizer during his reign. Pheidon is also thought to have introduced reforms for standard weight and measures in Argos, a theory further reinforced with the unearthing of six &quot;spits&quot; of iron in an Argive Heraion, possibly remainders of a dedication from Pheidon.

===Classical Argos===

In 494 BC, Argos suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of its regional rival, Sparta, at the Battle of Sepeia. Following this defeat, Herodotus tells us the city suffered a form of &quot;stasis&quot;. The political chaos is thought to have resulted in a democratic transition in the city. Argos did not participate in the Hellenic Alliance against the Persian Invasion of 480 BC. This resulted in a period of diplomatic isolation, although there is evidence of an Argive alliance with Tegea prior to 462 BC.

In 462 BC, Argos joined a tripartite alliance with Athens and Thessaly. This alliance was somewhat dysfunctional, however, and the Argives are only thought to have provided marginal contributions to the alliance at the Battle of Oenoe and Tanagra. For example, only 1,000 Argive hoplites are thought to have fought alongside the Athenians at the Battle of Tanagra. Following the allies&#x27; defeat at Tanagra in 457 BC, the alliance began to fall apart, resulting in its dissolution in 451 BC.

Argos remained neutral or the ineffective ally of Athens during the Archidamian War between Sparta and Athens. Argos&#x27; neutrality resulted in a rise of its prestige among other Greek cities, and Argos used this political capital to organize and lead an alliance against Sparta and Athens in 421 BC. This alliance included Mantinea, Corinth, Elis, Thebes, Argos, and eventually Athens. This alliance fell apart, however, after the allied loss at the Battle of Mantinea in 418 BC. This defeat, combined with the raiding of the Argolid by the Epidaurians, resulted in political instability and an eventual oligarchic coup in 417 BC. Although democracy was restored within a year, Argos was left permanently weakened by this coup. This weakening led to a loss of power, which in turn led to the shift of commercial focus from the Ancient Agora to the eastern side of the city, delimited by Danaou and Agiou Konstadinou streets.

Argos played a minor role in the Corinthian Wars against Sparta, and for a short period of time considered uniting with Corinth to form an expanded Argolid state. For a brief period of time, the two poleis combined, but Corinth quickly rebelled against Argive domination, and Argos returned to its traditional boundaries. After this, Argos continued to remain a minor power in Greek affairs.

Argos escaped occupation by Macedon during the reigns of Philip II and Alexander the Great and remained unscathed during the Wars of the Diadochi, however in 272 it was attacked by Pyrrhus of Epirus at the Battle of Argos, in which Pyrrhus was killed.

===Democracy in Classical Argos===
Argos was a democracy for most of the classical period, with only a brief hiatus between 418 and 416. Democracy was first established after a disastrous defeat by the Spartans at the Battle of Sepeia in 494. So many Argives were killed in the battle that a revolution ensued, in which previously disenfranchised outsiders were included in the state for the first time.

Argive democracy included an Assembly (called the &quot;aliaia&quot;), a Council (the &quot;bola&quot;), and another body called &#x27;The Eighty,&#x27; whose precise responsibilities are obscure. Magistrates served six-month terms of office, with few exceptions, and were audited at the end of their terms. There is some evidence that ostracism was practiced.

===Roman and Byzantine period===

Under Roman rule, Argos was part of the province of Achaea. While prosperous during the early principate, Argos along with much of Greece and the Balkans experienced disasters during the Crisis of the 3rd Century when external threats and internal revolts left the Empire in turmoil. During Gallienus&#x27; reign, marauding bands of Goths and Heruli sailed down from the Black Sea in 267 A.D. and devastated the Greek coastline and interior. Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes and Argos were all sacked. Gallienus finally cut off their retreat north and destroyed them with great slaughter at Naissus in Moesia.

With the death of the last emperor over a unified Empire, Theodosius I, the Visigoths under their leader Alaric I descended into Greece in 396–397 A.D., sacking and pillaging as they went. Neither the eastern or western Roman warlords, Rufinus (consul) or Stilicho, made an effective stand against them due to the political situation between them. Athens and Corinth were both sacked. While the exact level of destruction for Argos is disputed due to the conflicting nature of the ancient sources, the level of damage to the city and people was considerable. Stilicho finally landed in western Greece and forced the Visigoths north of Epirus. Sites said to have been destroyed in Argos include the Hypostyle hall, parts of the agora, the odeion, and the Aphrodision. In the late 7th century, it became part of the Theme of Hellas, and later of the Theme of the Peloponnese.

===Crusader and Ottoman rule===
In the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, the Crusaders captured the castle built on Larisa Hill, the site of the ancient acropolis, and the area became part of the lordship of Argos and Nauplia. In 1388, it was sold to the Republic of Venice, but was taken by the Despot of the Morea Theodore I Palaiologos before the Venetians could take control of the city; he sold it anyway to them in 1394. The Crusaders established a Latin bishopric. Venetian rule lasted until 1463, when the Ottomans captured the city.

In 1397, the Ottomans plundered Argos, carrying off part of the population, to sell as slaves. The Venetians repopulated the town and region with Albanian settlers, granting them long-term agrarian tax exemptions. Together with the Greeks of Argos, they supplied stratioti troops to the armies of Venice. Throughout the Ottoman–Venetian wars, many Albanians died or were captured in service to the Venetians; at Nafpaktos, Nafplio, Argos, Methoni, Koroni and Pylos. Furthermore, 8,000 Albanian stratioti, most of them along with their families, left the Peloponnese to continue their military service under the Republic of Venice or the Kingdom of Naples. At the end of the Ottoman–Venetian wars, a large number of Albanians had fled from the Peloponnese to Sicily. Some historians consider the French military term &quot;argoulet&quot; to derive from the Greek &quot;argetes&quot;, or inhabitant of Argos, as a large number of French stratioti came from the plain of Argos.
During Ottoman rule, Argos was divided in four mahalas, or quarters; the Greek (Rûm) mahala, Liepur mahala, Bekir Efenti mahala and Karamoutza or Besikler mahala, respectively corresponding to what is now the northeastern, the northwestern, the southwestern and southeastern parts of the city. The Greek mahala was also called the &quot;quarter of the unfaithful of Archos town&quot; in Turkish documents, whereas Liepur mahala (the quarter of the rabbits) was composed mostly of Albanian emigrants and well-reputed families. Karamoutza mahala was home to the most prominent Turks and boasted a mosque (modern-day church of Agios Konstadinos), a Turkish cemetery, Ali Nakin Bei&#x27;s serail, Turkish baths and a Turkish school. It is also at this period when the open market of the city is first organised on the site north to Kapodistrias&#x27; barracks, at the same spot where it is held in modern times. A mosque would have existed there, too, according to the city planning most Ottoman cities followed.

Argos grew exponentially during this time, with its sprawl being unregulated and without planning. As French explorer Pouqueville noted, &quot;its houses are not aligned, without order, scattered all over the place, divided by home gardens and uncultivated areas&quot;. Liepur mahala appears to have been the most organised, having the best layout, while Bekir mahala and Karamoutza mahala were the most labyrinthine. However, all quarters shared the same type of streets; firstly, they all had main streets which were wide, busy and public roads meant to allow for communication between neighbourhoods (typical examples are, to a great extent, modern-day Korinthou, Nafpliou and Tripoleos streets). Secondary streets were also common in all four quarters since they lead to the interior of each mahala, having a semi-public character, whereas the third type of streets referred to dead-end private alleys used specifically by families to access their homes. Remnants of this city layout can be witnessed even today, as Argos still preserves several elements of this Ottoman type style, particularly with its long and complicated streets, its narrow alleys and its densely constructed houses.

===Independence and modern history===
With the exception of a period of Venetian domination in 1687–1715, Argos remained in Ottoman hands until the beginning of the Greek War of Independence in 1821, when wealthy Ottoman families moved to nearby Nafplio due to its stronger walling.

At that time, as part of the general uprising, many local governing bodies were formed in different parts of the country, and the &quot;Consulate of Argos&quot; was proclaimed on 28 March 1821, under the Peloponnesian Senate. It had a single head of state, Stamatellos Antonopoulos, styled &quot;Consul&quot;, between 28 March and 26 May 1821.

Later, Argos accepted the authority of the unified Provisional Government of the First National Assembly at Epidaurus, and eventually became part of the Kingdom of Greece. With the coming of governor Ioannis Kapodistrias, the city underwent efforts of modernisation. Being an agricultural village, the need for urban planning was vital. For this reason, in 1828, Kapodistrias himself appointed mechanic Stamatis Voulgaris as the creator of a city plan which would offer Argos big streets, squares and public spaces. However, both Voulgaris and, later, French architect de Borroczun&#x27;s plans were not well received by the locals, with the result that the former had to be revised by Zavos. Ultimately, none of the plans were fully implemented. Still, the structural characteristics of de Borroczun&#x27;s plan can be found in the city today, despite obvious proof of pre-revolutionary layout, such as the unorganised urban sprawl testified in the area from Inachou street to the point where the railway tracks can be found today.

After talks concerning the intentions of the Greek government to move the Greek capital from Nafplio to Athens, discussions regarding the possibility of Argos also being a candidate as the potential new capital became more frequent, with supporters of the idea claiming that, unlike Athens, Argos was naturally protected by its position and benefited from a nearby port (Nafplio). Moreover, it was maintained that construction of public buildings would be difficult in Athens, given that most of the land was owned by the Greek church, meaning that a great deal of expropriation would have to take place. On the contrary, Argos did not face a similar problem, having large available areas for this purpose. In the end, the proposition of the Greek capital being moved to Argos was rejected by the father of king Otto, Ludwig, who insisted in making Athens the capital, something which eventually happened in 1834.

During the German occupation, Argos airfield was frequently attacked by Allied forces. One of the raids was so large that it resulted in the bombing of the city on 14 October 1943, with the casualties of about 100 dead Argives and several casualties, and 75 of the Germans. The bombing started from the airfield heading southeast, hitting the monastery of Katakrykmeni and several areas of the city, up to the railway station.

==Mythology==
The mythological kings of Argos are (in order): Inachus, Phoroneus, Apis, Argus, Criasus, (Phorbas, Triopas is sometimes between Criasus and Iasus in some sources), Iasus, Agenor, (Crotopus and Sthenelus was between Agenor and Gelanor in some sources), Gelanor AKA Pelasgus, Danaus, Lynceus, Abas, Proetus, Acrisius, Perseus, Megapenthes, (Argeus and Anaxagoras comes after in some sources).
An alternative version supplied by Tatian of the original 17 consecutive kings of Argos includes Apis, Argios, Kriasos and Phorbas between Argus and Triopas, explaining the apparent unrelation of Triopas to Argus.

The city of Argos was believed to be the birthplace of the mythological character Perseus, the son of the god Zeus and Danaë, who was the daughter of the king of Argos, Acrisius.

After the original 17 kings of Argos, there were three kings ruling Argos at the same time (see Anaxagoras), one descended from Bias, one from Melampus, and one from Anaxagoras. Melampus was succeeded by his son Mantius, then Oicles, and Amphiaraus, and his house of Melampus lasted down to the brothers Alcmaeon and Amphilochus.

Anaxagoras was succeeded by his son Alector, and then Iphis. Iphis left his kingdom to his nephew Sthenelus, the son of his brother Capaneus.

Bias was succeeded by his son Talaus, and then by his son Adrastus who, with Amphiaraus, commanded the disastrous war of the Seven against Thebes. Adrastus bequeathed the kingdom to his son, Aegialeus, who was subsequently killed in the war of the Epigoni. Diomedes, grandson of Adrastus through his son-in-law Tydeus and daughter Deipyle, replaced Aegialeus and was King of Argos during the Trojan war. This house lasted longer than those of Anaxagoras and Melampus, and eventually the kingdom was reunited under its last member, Cyanippus, son of Aegialeus, soon after the exile of Diomedes.

==Ecclesiastical history==
After Christianity became established in Argos, the first bishop documented in extant written records is Genethlius, who in 448 AD took part in the synod called by Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople that deposed Eutyches from his priestly office and excommunicated him. The next bishop of Argos, Onesimus, was at the 451 Council of Chalcedon. His successor, Thales, was a signatory of the letter that the bishops of the Roman province of Hellas sent in 458 to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian to protest the killing of Proterius of Alexandria. Bishop Ioannes was at the Third Council of Constantinople in 680, and Theotimus at the Photian Council of Constantinople (879). The local see is today the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Argolis.

Under &#x27;Frankish&#x27; Crusader rule, Argos became a Latin Church bishopric in 1212, which lasted as a residential see until Argos was taken by the Ottoman Empire in 1463 but would be revived under the second Venetian rule in 1686. Today the diocese is a Catholic titular see.

==Geography==
===Subdivisions===
The former municipality and current municipal unit, is subdivided into the following communities and their respective settlements:
* Argos (Akova, Argos, Kokla, Timenio)
* Dalamanara
* Elliniko (Elliniko, Krya Vrysi, Kryoneri, Tourniki, Zogka)
* Ira
* Inachos (Inachos, Tristrato)
* Kefalari (Kefalari, Magoula)
* Kourtaki
* Lalouka
* Pyrgella

===Climate===
Argos has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;). It is one of the hottest places in Greece during summer. Argos has generally cold winters, although due to the local climate, some winter months may have little rainfall. The weather of Argos includes an abundant amount of sunny days throughout the year, even in the winter. Temperatures below zero degrees Celsius are recorded mostly in the nightly hours during the winter months. Snowfalls are generally rare there, although not unheard of. The most recent significant snowfall in Argos occurred in early January 2017 during a large European cold wave. There is also a degree of variation in the annual rainfall volumes in Argos, as rainfall in Argos usually is between 300 and 800 millimeters depending the year.
==Characteristics==

===Orientation===

The city of Argos is delimited to the north by dry river Xerias, to the east by Inachos river and Panitsa stream (which emanates from the latter), to the west by the Larissa hill (site of homonymous castle and of a monastery called Panagia Katakekrymeni-Portokalousa) and the Aspida Hill (unofficially Prophetes Elias hill), and to the south by the Notios Periferiakos road.

The Agios Petros (Saint Peter) square, along with the eponymous cathedral (dedicated to saint Peter the Wonderworker), make up the town centre, whereas some other characteristic town squares are the Laiki Agora (Open Market) square, officially Dimokratias (Republic) square, where, as implied by its name, an open market takes place twice a week, Staragora (Wheat Market), officially Dervenakia square, and Dikastirion (Court) square. Bonis Park is an essential green space of the city.

Currently, the most commercially active streets of the city are those surrounding the Agios Petros square (Kapodistriou, Danaou, Vassileos Konstantinou streets) as well as Korinthou street. The Pezodromi (Pedestrian Streets), i.e. the paved Michael Stamou, Tsaldari and Venizelou streets, are the most popular meeting point, encompassing a wide variety of shops and cafeterias. The neighborhood of Gouva, which extends around the intersection of Vassileos Konstantinou and Tsokri streets, is also considered a commercial point.

In the center of the city, next to the St. Peter&#x27;s church, there is an artificial lake that was constructed and filled during an extensive redevelopment works in the city, which lasted between February 2015 and April 2016. During the work for the redevelopment of the city&#x27;s square the floor of the old (now demolished) church of St. Nicholas was found, which was located north of the present-day church of St. Peter, that was built after 1865. Pursuant to a decision of the Central Archaeological Council, the floor and part of the sidewalls of the old church were covered with dirt in early March 2016.

On 15 February 2022 a new statue of Heracles was unveiled. It is a replica of a statue made by Lysippus of Sicyon in the 4th century BC. The Roman copy of Lysippus&#x27; statue is known as the Farnese Hercules, and it is exhibited in Naples, Italy.

In March 2022 the construction of the fountain in St. Peter&#x27;s square was completed. In the base of the marble fountain there are four lions. Above the visitor can see four members of the Danaids. The fountain has a width of 7 meters and a height of 5 meters, while the fountain was designed in collaboration with the Supreme School of Fine Arts in Athens.

The city has three monasteries that are located in Larissa hill.

===Population===
In 700 BC there were at least 5,000 people living in the city. In the fourth century BC, the city was home to as many as 30,000 people.
Today, according to the 2021 Greek census, the city has a population of 21,891. It is the largest city in Argolis, larger than the capital Nafplio.

===Economy===

The primary economic activity in the area is agriculture. Citrus fruits are the predominant crop, followed by olives and apricots. The area is also famous for its local melon variety, Argos melons (or Argitiko). There is also important local production of dairy products, factories for fruits processing.

Considerable remains of the ancient and medieval city survive and are a popular tourist attraction.

==Monuments==

Most of Argos&#x27; historical and archaeological monuments are currently unused, abandoned, or only partially renovated:

* The Larisa castle, built during prehistoric time, which has undergone several repairs and expansions since antiquity and played a significant historical role during the Venetian domination of Greece and the Greek War of Independence. It is located on top of the Larissa Hill, which also constitutes the highest spot of the city (289 m.). In ancient times, a castle was also found on neighbouring Aspida Hill. When connected with walls, these two castles fortified the city from enemy invasions. 
* The ancient theatre, built in the 3rd century B.C with a capacity of 20,000 spectators, replaced an older neighbouring theatre of the 5th century BC and communicated with the ancient agora. It was visible from any part of the ancient city and the Argolic gulf. In 1829, it was used by Ioannis Kapodistrias for the Fourth National Assembly of the new Hellenic State. Today, cultural events are held at its premises during the summer months.
* The ancient agora, adjacent to the ancient theatre, which developed in the 6th century B.C., was located at the junction of the ancient roads coming from Corinth, Heraion and Tegea. Excavations in the area have uncovered a bouleuterion, built in 460 B.C. when Argos adopted the democratic regime, a Sanctuary of Apollo Lyceus and a palaestra.
* The &quot;Criterion&quot; of Argos, an ancient monument located on the southwest side of the town, on the foot of Larissa hill, which came to have its current structure during the 6th–3rd century BC period. Initially, it served as a court of ancient Argos, similar to Areopagus of Athens. According to mythology, it was at this area where Hypermnestra, one of the 50 daughters of Danaus, the first king of Argos, was tried. Later, under the reigns of Hadrian, a fountain was created to collect and circulate water coming from the Hadrianean aqueduct located in northern Argos. The site is connected via a paved path with the ancient theatre.
* The Barracks of Kapodistrias, a preservable building with a long history. Built in the 1690s during the Venetian domination of Greece, they initially served as a hospital run by the Sisters of Mercy. During the Tourkokratia, they served as a market and a post office. Later, in 1829, significant damage caused during the Greek revolution was repaired by Kapodistrias who turned the building into a cavalry barrack, a school (1893–1894), an exhibition space (1899), a shelter for Greek refugees displaced during the population exchange between Greece and Turkey (since 1920) and an interrogation and torture space (during the German occupation of Greece). In 1955–68, it was used by the army for the last time; it now accommodates the Byzantine Museum of Argos, local corporations and also serves as an exhibition space.
* The Municipal Neoclassical Market building (unofficially the &quot;Kamares&quot;, i.e. arches, from the arches that it boasts), built in 1889, which is located next to Dimokratias square, is one of the finest samples of modern Argos&#x27; masterly architecture, in Ernst Ziller style. The elongated, two corridor, preservable building accommodates small shops.
* The Kapodistrian school, in central Argos. Built by architect Labros Zavos in 1830, as part of Kapodistrias&#x27; efforts to provide places of education to the Greek people, it could accommodate up to 300 students. However, technical difficulties led to its decay, until it was restored several times, the last of which being in 1932. Today, its neoclassical character is evident, with the building housing the 1st elementary school of the town. 
* The old Town Hall, built during the time of Kapodistrias in 1830, which originally served as a venue for a justice of the peace, the local government of Argos, an arm of the carabineers and a prison. From 1987 to 2012, it housed the town hall, which is now located in Kapodistriou street.
* The house of philhellene Thomas Gordon, built in 1829 that served as an all-girls school, a dance school and was home to the 4th Greek artillery regiment. Today it accommodates the French Institute of Athens (Institut Français d&#x27; Athènes).
* The house of Spyridon Trikoupis (built in 1900), where the politician was born and spent his childhood. Also located in the estate, which is not open to public, is the Saint Charalambos chapel where Trikoupis was baptized. 
* The house of general Tsokris, important military fighter in the Greek revolution of 1821 and later assemblyman of Argos.
* The temple of Agios Konstadinos, one of the very few remaining buildings in Argos dating from the Ottoman Greece era. It is estimated to have been built around 1570–1600, with a minaret also having existed in its premises. It served as a mosque and an Ottoman cemetery up to 1871, when it was declared a Christian temple.
* The chambered tombs of the Aspida hill.
* The Hellinikon Pyramid. Dating back to late 4th century B.C., it has elicited many theories as to its purpose (tumulus, fortress). Together with the widely accepted scientific chronology, there are some people who claim it was built shortly after the Great Pyramid of Giza as a symbol of the excellent relationship the citizens of Argos had with Egypt.

A great number of archaeological findings, dating from the prehistoric ages, can be found at the Argos museum, housed at the old building of Dimitrios Kallergis at Saint Peter&#x27;s square. The Argos airfield, located in the homonymous area (Aerodromio) in the northwest outskirts of the city, is also worth mentioning. The area it covers was created in 1916–1917 and was heavily used during the Greco-Italian War and for the training of new Kaberos school aviators for the Hellenic Air Force Academy. It also constituted an important benchmark in the organization of the Greek air forces in southern Greece. Furthermore, the airfield was used by the Germans for the release of their aerial troops during the Battle of Crete. It was last used as a landing/takeoff point for spray planes (for agricultural purposes in the olive tree cultivations) up until 1985.

==Transportation==

Argos is connected via regular bus services with neighbouring areas as well as Athens. In addition, taxi stands can be found at the Agios Petros as well as the Laiki Agora square. A good road network ensures the connection of the city with the surrounding towns, villages and the rest of Peloponnese and the country.

The city also has a railway station which, at the moment, remains closed due to an indefinite halt to all railway services in the Peloponnese area by the Hellenic Railways Organisation. However, in late 2014, it was announced that the station would open up again, as part of an expansion of the Athens suburban railway in Argos, Nafplio and Korinthos, however the plan never came in fruition. Finally in mid 2020 it was announced by the administration of Peloponnese Region their cooperation with the Hellenic Railways Organisation for the metric line and stations maintenance for the purpose of the line&#x27;s reoperation in the middle of 2021. As of April 2023, no steps have been taken to prepare for reopening of the railway lines, to the dismay of the local population.

==Education==

Argos has a wide range of educational institutes that also serve neighbouring sparsely populated areas and villages. In particular, the city has seven dimotika (primary schools), four gymnasia (junior high), three lyceums (senior high), one vocational school, one music school as well as a Touristical Business and Cooking department and a post-graduate ASPETE department. The city also has two public libraries.

For the academic year 2020–2021, the beginning of operations for a faculty of Rural Economy of the University of Peloponnese in Argos was planned. However, the creation of this faculty was cancelled by the Greek ministry of education.

There is a municipal children&#x27;s-youth library next to the Bonis Park, and another one next to Aggeli Bobou street.

== Mayors of Argos ==
The municipality was established in 1834 and operated till 1914 and again since 1925 till 2010 when it was abolished. During 1914–1925, it was downgraded into community, due to having less than 10,000 population. Before the Kapodistrias reform in 1997, municipality of Argos contained only the community of Argos. First mayor was Hristos Vlassis.

<text>Grace Ethel Cecile Rosalie Allen (July 26, 1895 – August 27, 1964) was an American vaudevillian, singer, actress, and comedian who became internationally famous as the zany partner and comic foil of husband George Burns, her straight man, appearing with him on radio, television and film as the duo Burns and Allen.

For her contributions to the television industry, Allen was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6672 Hollywood Boulevard. She and Burns were inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1988.

Costar Bea Benaderet said of Allen in 1966, &quot;She was probably one of the greatest actresses of our time.&quot;

==Early life==
Allen was born in San Francisco, to George Allen and Margaret Theresa (&quot;Molly&quot;) Allen (née Darragh; later Mrs. Edward Pidgeon), who were both of Irish Catholic descent. She made her first appearance on stage at age three, and was given her first role on the radio by Eddie Cantor. She graduated from Star of the Sea Convent School in 1914, and during that time became a talented dancer.

She soon began performing Irish folk dances with her three sisters, who were billed as &quot;The Four Colleens&quot;. In 1909, Allen joined her sister, Bessie, as a vaudeville performer. At a performance in 1922, Allen met George Burns, and the two formed a comedy act. They were married on January 7, 1926 in Cleveland by a justice of the peace.

Allen was born with heterochromia, giving her two different color eyes, one blue and one green. Her left arm and shoulder were badly scarred when a boiling pot of tea fell on her as a child; as a result, she wore long-sleeved dresses throughout her life. Allen also suffered from crippling migraine headaches.

===Birthdate myth===
Some discrepancy exists as to her date of birth. Depending on the source, Allen is alleged to have been born on July 26 in 1895, 1896, 1902, or 1906. All public vital records held by the city and county of San Francisco were destroyed in the earthquake and great fire of April 1906. Her husband George Burns professed not to know exactly how old she was, though it was presumably he who provided the date of July 26, 1902 that appears on her death record. Allen&#x27;s crypt marker also shows her year of birth as 1902.

Among Allen&#x27;s signature jokes was a dialogue in which she would claim that she was born in 1906. Her foil would press her for proof or corroborating information, and she would reply that her birth certificate had been destroyed in the earthquake. Her foil would point out that she was born in July, but that the earthquake was three months earlier in April. Allen would simply smile and reply: &quot;Well, it was an &quot;awfully big&quot; earthquake.&quot;

Presumably the most reliable information comes from U.S. Census data collected on June 1, 1900 that shows Grace Allen, age four (born in July 1895), along with her parents and five siblings. This proves that Allen was born before 1900 and indicates that the birthdate of July 26, 1895 may be correct. Additionally, the yearbook from her senior year of high school has been located; its 1914 date is consistent with her having been born in 1895.

==Double act==

The Burns and Allen act began with Allen as the straight man, setting up Burns to deliver the punchlines and receive the laughs. In his book &quot;&quot;, Burns explained that he had noticed that Allen&#x27;s straight lines were bringing more laughs than did his punchlines, so he cannily flipped the act, making himself the straight man so that Allen would elicit the laughter. Audiences immediately fell in love with Allen&#x27;s character, which combined the traits of naivete, zaniness and innocence. The reformulated team, focusing on Allen, toured the country, eventually headlining in major vaudeville houses. Many of their famous routines were preserved in one- and two-reel short films, including &quot;Lambchops&quot; (1929), made while the couple was still performing on the stage.

Burns attributed all of the couple&#x27;s early success to Allen, ignoring his own brilliance as a straight man. He summarized their act by saying: &quot;All I had to do was say, &#x27;Gracie, how&#x27;s your brother?&#x27; and she talked for 38 years. And sometimes I didn&#x27;t even have to remember to say &#x27;Gracie, how&#x27;s your brother?&#x27;&quot;

==Radio==
In the early 1930s, like many stars of the era, Burns and Allen graduated to radio. The show was originally a continuation of the flirtation act from their vaudeville and short-film routines. In 1935, famed composer and arranger Ferde Grofe joined them as musical director. Burns realized that they were too old for that type of material and changed the show&#x27;s format in the fall of 1941 into the situation comedy for which they are best remembered: a working showbusiness married couple negotiating ordinary problems caused by Gracie&#x27;s &quot;illogical logic&quot;, usually with the help of neighbors Harry and Blanche Morton and their announcer Bill Goodwin (later replaced by Harry von Zell during the run of their television series).

==Publicity stunts==

Burns and Allen frequently used running gags as publicity stunts. During 1932–33, they pulled off one of the most successful in the business: a year-long search for Allen&#x27;s supposedly missing brother. Allen would make unannounced cameo appearances on other shows, asking if anyone had seen her brother. However, her brother did not find it comical and eventually asked them to stop; he was so irked by the gag&#x27;s popularity that he disappeared from society at the height of its popularity.

In 1940, Allen announced that she was running for president of the United States on the Surprise Party ticket. Burns and Allen embarked on a cross-country whistle-stop campaign tour on a private train, performing their live radio show in various cities. In one of her campaign speeches, Gracie said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know much about the Lend-Lease Bill, but if we owe it, we should pay it.&quot; Another typical quip on the campaign trail was: &quot;Everybody knows a woman is better than a man when it comes to introducing bills into the house.&quot; The Surprise Party mascot was the kangaroo, and its motto was &quot;It&#x27;s in the bag.&quot; As part of the gag, Dwell, Sloan and Pearce published a book, &quot;How to Become President by Gracie Allen&quot; (in reality, written by Burns and Allen writer Charles Lofgren) that included photographs from their nationwide campaign tour and the Surprise Party convention. Allen received an endorsement from Harvard University.

Allen was also the subject of one of S. S. Van Dine&#x27;s Philo Vance mystery novels, &quot;The Gracie Allen Murder Case&quot;. Allen said: &quot;S.S. Van Dine is silly to spend six months writing a novel when you can buy one for $2.95.&quot;

In another publicity stunt, Allen played a piano concert at the Hollywood Bowl (and later at Carnegie Hall). The Burns and Allen staff hired a composer to write the &quot;Concerto for Index Finger&quot;, a joke piece in which the orchestra would play madly, only to pause while Allen played a one-finger scale with a final incorrect note. The orchestra would then play a musical piece that developed around the wrong note. On her final solo, Allen would finally hit the right note, causing the entire orchestra to applaud. The actual index-finger playing was performed offstage by a professional pianist. The concerto was featured in the film &quot;Two Girls and a Sailor&quot; (1944) with an orchestra conducted by Albert Coates.

==Films==

In the early 1930s, Burns and Allen appeared in several short films in which they performed some of their classic vaudeville routines. They also appeared in two full-length movies with W. C. Fields: &quot;International House&quot; (1933) and &quot;Six of a Kind&quot; (1934). Burns and Allen also appeared in three out of the four &quot;Big Broadcast&quot; ensemble comedies including &quot;The Big Broadcast&quot; (1932) with Bing Crosby, &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1936&quot; (1935) with Crosby, and &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1937&quot; (1936) with Jack Benny. They were also in &quot;We&#x27;re Not Dressing&quot; (1934), billed directly under Crosby and Carole Lombard.

In 1937, Burns and Allen starred with Fred Astaire in &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot;, a musical with an original score by George Gershwin that introduced the song &quot;A Foggy Day&quot;. It was Astaire&#x27;s first RKO film without dancing partner Ginger Rogers. Astaire&#x27;s costar Joan Fontaine was not a dancer, and he was reluctant to dance on screen alone. He also felt the script needed more comic relief to enhance the overall appeal of the film. Burns and Allen had each worked in vaudeville as dancers before forming their act, and when word of the project reached them, they called Astaire and he asked them to audition. Burns contacted an act whom he had once seen performing a dance using small whisk brooms. For the next several weeks, he and Allen practiced the complicated routine for their audition. When they presented the dance to Astaire, he liked it so much that he asked them to teach it to him, and it was added to the film with the three of them dancing together. Burns and Allen also matched Astaire step-by-step in the film&#x27;s demandingly epic dance sequence in a funhouse including amazing visuals with distorted mirrors.

Their next film the following year was &quot;College Swing&quot; (1938) starring Burns and Allen top-billed above Martha Raye and Bob Hope with a stellar supporting cast featuring Edward Everett Horton, Betty Grable, Jackie Coogan, John Payne, Robert Cummings, and Jerry Colonna. The picture was directed by Raoul Walsh.

A lively musical comedy came next titled &quot;Honolulu&quot; (1939) starring Eleanor Powell, Robert Young and Burns and Allen billed above the title. Unusually, Burns and Allen performed separately through most of the film until the end, with Allen singing and dancing the energetic titular song with Powell at one point while Burns is off-screen.

That same year, Allen&#x27;s popularity was such that S.S. Van Dine wrote one of his Philo Vance detective novels featuring her as the principal character titled &quot;The Gracie Allen Murder Case&quot;. The zanily comedic book was adapted into a film, also titled &quot;The Gracie Allen Murder Case&quot; (1939). Allen was billed above Warren William (the actor then portraying Philo Vance in the series of Vance films), and without Burns. The result was so successful that Allen was cast two years later in a similar mystery/comedy film titled &quot;Mr. and Mrs. North&quot; (1942) in which she is top-billed as a comedic detective, again without Burns in the cast. 
Allen made her last film appearance in a musical cameo as an amusing concert pianist in &quot;Two Girls and a Sailor&quot;, without Burns, but remained in radio and would segue into series television with her husband six years later.

==Television==
In the fall of 1949, having apparently put their movie career behind them but working continuously in radio, Burns and Allen became part of the CBS talent raid. Their good friend and frequent guest star Jack Benny had already departed NBC for CBS, and CBS head William S. Paley made it clear that he believed that talent, not the network, made the difference, which was not the case at NBC. Benny convinced Burns and Allen (among others) to join him in the move to CBS. The &quot;Burns and Allen&quot; radio show became part of the CBS lineup, and a year later, they also brought their show to television as &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;. They continued to use the formula that had kept them longtime radio stars, playing themselves only now as television stars, still living next door to Harry and Blanche Morton. They concluded each show with a brief dialogue performance in the style of their classic vaudeville and earlier radio routines. Burns always ended the show with, &quot;Say goodnight, Gracie&quot;, to which Allen simply replied, &quot;Goodnight&quot; (Allen never said, &quot;Goodnight, Gracie&quot;, as legend has it).

Allen retired in 1958, and Burns tried to continue without her. The show was renamed &quot;The George Burns Show&quot; with the cast intact except for Allen. The show&#x27;s setting was changed from the Burns home to his office, with Blanche working as Burns&#x27; secretary so that she could help Allen keep an eye on him. The renamed show barely lasted a year.

==Private life==
In the 1930s, Burns and Allen adopted two children, Sandra Jean and Ronald Jon.

Eight years before his death, Burns publicly admitted that once in their marriage, in the 1950s, he cheated on Allen. In guilt over the one-night affair, Burns gave Allen a $10,000 diamond ring and a $750 silver centerpiece. Allen learned about the affair but never let on to Burns that she knew, and the couple never discussed it.

===Death===

Allen, who had a history of heart disease, died from a heart attack in Hollywood on August 27, 1964. An 1895 birth year would place her age at death as 69. Her remains were interred in a crypt at the Freedom Mausoleum in the Sanctuary of Heritage at Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

Burns&#x27; remains were interred at her side in 1996 when he died at the age of 100. The marker on the crypt was changed from &quot;Grace Allen Burns—Beloved Wife And Mother (1902–1964)&quot; to &quot;Gracie Allen (1902–1964) and George Burns (1896–1996)—Together Again&quot;.

<doc id="70020" wikidata="Q344793" url="?curid=70020" title="George Burns">
<text>George Burns (born Nathan Birnbaum; January 20, 1896March 9, 1996) was an American comedian, actor, writer, and singer, and one of the few entertainers whose career successfully spanned vaudeville, radio, film, and television. His arched eyebrow and cigar-smoke punctuation became familiar trademarks for over three-quarters of a century. He and his wife Gracie Allen appeared on radio, television and film as the comedy duo Burns and Allen.

At age 79, Burns experienced a sudden career revival as an amiable, beloved, and unusually active comedy elder statesman in the 1975 film &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot;, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

== Early life ==

George Burns was born Nathan Birnbaum () on January 20, 1896, in New York City, the ninth of 12 children born to Hadassah &quot;Dorah&quot; (née Bluth; 1857–1927) and Eliezer Birnbaum (1855–1903), known as Louis or Lippa, Jewish immigrants who had come to the United States from Ropczyce, Galicia, now Poland. Burns was a member of the First Roumanian-American Congregation.

His father was a substitute cantor at the local synagogue but usually worked as a coat presser. During the influenza epidemic of 1903, Lippe Birnbaum contracted the flu and died at the age of 47. Burns, called Nattie or Nate at the time, went to work to help support the family, shining shoes, running errands and selling newspapers.

When he got a job as a syrup maker in a local candy shop at age seven, Burns was &quot;discovered&quot;, as he later recalled:

One of the Burns brothers&#x27; first regular gigs was operating the curtains at the vaudeville and nickelodeon theatre of Frank Seiden, father of Joseph Seiden, who later became a Yiddish film producer. Burns started smoking cigars when he was 14.

Burns was drafted into the United States Army when the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, but failed the physical examination because he was extremely nearsighted. To hide his Jewish heritage, he adopted the stage name by which he would be known for the rest of his life. He later claimed that he selected the name George Burns because there were two active star professional baseball players with the name (George H. Burns and George J. Burns, unrelated), each of whom accumulated more than 2,000 hits and held some major-league records. Burns also was reported to have taken &quot;George&quot; from his brother Izzy (who had first adopted the name because he hated his own) and &quot;Burns&quot; from the Burns Brothers Coal Company, from whose trucks he stole coal as a youth.

His first wife was Hannah Siegel (stage name Hermosa Jose), one of his dance partners. The marriage lasted 26 weeks and occurred only because Siegel&#x27;s family would not permit her to tour with Burns unless they were married. They divorced at the end of the tour.

Burns normally partnered with a girl, sometimes in an adagio dance routine, sometimes in comic patter. Though he had an apparent flair for comedy, he never quite clicked with any of his partners until he met Gracie Allen, a young Irish Catholic woman, in 1923. &quot;All of a sudden&quot;, he later said, &quot;the audience realized I had a talent. They were right. I did have a talent—and I was married to her for 38 years.&quot; Burns wed Allen in 1926.

== Stage to screen ==

Burns and Allen began their career in motion pictures with a series of comic short films in the late 1920s and early 1930s, such as &quot;The Big Broadcast&quot; (1932) with Bing Crosby, &quot;International House&quot; (1933) and &quot;Six of a Kind&quot; (1934) with W.C. Fields, &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1936&quot; with Crosby again, &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1937&quot; with Jack Benny, &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot; (1937) with Fred Astaire and Joan Fontaine, and &quot;College Swing&quot; (1938) with Bob Hope and Martha Raye. &quot;Honolulu&quot; (1939) with Eleanor Powell and Robert Young was Burns&#x27;s last film for nearly 40 years, though Allen starred in two more pictures without him.

In 1938, Paramount producer and managing director William LeBaron was planning a vehicle for Burns and Allen to team with established star Bing Crosby, with a script written by Don Hartman and Frank Butler. But the story didn&#x27;t fit Burns and Allen&#x27;s style, so LeBaron ordered rewrites to fit two male co-stars: Crosby and Bob Hope. The project became &quot;Road to Singapore&quot; (1940), the first in a long-running and popular series of &quot;Road&quot; films.

== Radio stars ==

Burns and Allen first appeared on the radio as the comedy relief for bandleader Guy Lombardo. In his memoir &quot;The Third Time Around&quot;, Burns shared a letter from a college fraternity complaining that its weekly dance parties were interrupted by Burns and Allen routines.

Burns and Allen found their own show and radio audience, first airing on February 15, 1932. Their show was based on their classic stage routines and sketch comedy in which their style was woven into multiple smaller scenes, in a manner similar to that of the short films that they had made in Hollywood. They were also known for clever publicity stunts, such as Allen&#x27;s hunt for her missing brother that carried over into guest spots on other radio shows. In April 1935 they added Ferde Grofé as musical director.

The couple was portrayed at first as unmarried, with Allen the object of Burns&#x27;s affections as well as those of other cast members. Bandleaders Ray Noble (known for his phrase &quot;Gracie, this is the first time we&#x27;ve ever been alone&quot;) and Artie Shaw played Allen&#x27;s love interests. Singer Tony Martin also played Allen&#x27;s unwilling love interest, whom she comically threatened to fire if he did not reciprocate her romantic interest.

With ratings declining and their audience familiar with their real-life marriage, Burns and Allen adapted their radio show in 1941 to present them as a married couple. Artie Shaw, who also appeared as a character in some of the show&#x27;s sketches, was the show&#x27;s bandleader at one time. Allen&#x27;s character also changed slightly during this era, often being mean to Burns.

As this format grew stale over the years, Burns and his fellow writers redeveloped the show as a situation comedy in 1941. The reformat focused on the couple&#x27;s married life and their friends and neighbors, including Elvia Allman as Tootsie Sagwell, a man-hungry spinster in love with Bill Goodwin. The characters of Harry and Blanche Morton became a mainstay of the program.

As with &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, the new &quot;George Burns &amp; Gracie Allen Show&quot; portrayed Burns and Allen as entertainers with their own weekly radio show. Goodwin remained, and the music was now led by Meredith Willson (later to be better known for composing the Broadway musical &quot;The Music Man&quot;). Willson also played himself on the show as naïve, friendly and shy with women. The new format&#x27;s success made it one of the few classic radio comedies to completely reinvent itself and regain great success.

=== Supporting players ===
The supporting cast during this phase included Mel Blanc as the melancholy, ironically named &quot;Happy Postman&quot; (his catchphrase was &quot;Remember, keep smiling!&quot;); Bea Benaderet (later Cousin Pearl in &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, Kate Bradley in &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; and the voice of Betty Rubble in &quot;The Flintstones&quot;) and Hal March (later the host of &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot;) as neighbors Blanche and Harry Morton; and the various members of Allen&#x27;s ladies&#x27; club, the Beverly Hills Uplift Society. One running gag during this period, stretching into the television era, was Burns&#x27;s questionable singing voice; Allen lovingly called him &quot;Sugar Throat&quot;. The show received and maintained a Top 10 rating for the rest of its radio life.

=== New network ===
In 1949, after 12 years at NBC, the couple took the show back to its original network CBS, where they had risen to fame from 1932 to 1937. Their friend Jack Benny reached a negotiating impasse with NBC over the corporation he set up (&quot;Amusement Enterprises&quot;) to package his show, the better to put more of his earnings on a capital-gains basis and avoid the 80% taxes levied on very high earners in the World War II period. CBS executive William S. Paley convinced Benny to move to CBS (Paley, among other things, impressed Benny with his attitude that the performers make the network, not the other way around, as NBC chief David Sarnoff reputedly believed); Benny in turn convinced several NBC stars to join him, including Burns and Allen. Thus, CBS reaped the benefits when Burns and Allen moved to television in 1950.

== Television ==
=== &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot; ===

On television, &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot; put faces to some of the radio characters audiences had come to love (they already knew Burns and Allen&#x27;s faces from their films). A number of significant changes were seen in the show:
*A parade of actors portrayed Harry Morton: Hal March, &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; alumnus John Brown, veteran film and television character actor Fred Clark, and future &quot;Mister Ed&quot; co-star Larry Keating.
* Burns often broke the fourth wall, and chatted with the home audience, telling understated jokes and commenting wryly on what show characters were doing. In later shows, he actually turned on a television and watched what the other characters were up to when he was off camera, then returned to foil them.
* When announcer Bill Goodwin left after the first season, Burns hired announcer Harry Von Zell, a veteran of the Fred Allen and Eddie Cantor radio shows. Von Zell was cast as the good-natured, easily confused Burns and Allen announcer and buddy. He also became one of the show&#x27;s running gags: his involvement in Allen&#x27;s harebrained ideas got him fired at least once a week by Burns.
* The first shows were simply a copy of the radio format, complete with lengthy and integrated commercials for sponsor Carnation Evaporated Milk by Goodwin. But what worked well on radio sometimes appeared forced and plodding on television. The show was changed into the now-standard situation comedy format, with the commercials distinct from the plot.
* Midway through the run of the show, the Burnses&#x27; two children, Sandra and Ronald, began to appear, Sandy in an occasional voiceover or brief on-air part (often as a telephone operator) and Ronnie in various small roles during seasons 4 and 5. Ronnie joined the regular cast in season 6. Typical of the blurred line between reality and fiction in the show, Ronnie played George and Gracie&#x27;s on-air son, showing up in the second episode of season 6 (&quot;Ronnie Arrives&quot;) with no explanation offered for where he had been for the past five years. Originally his character was an aspiring dramatic actor who held his parents&#x27; comedy style in befuddled contempt and deemed it unsuitable for a &quot;serious&quot; drama student. When the show&#x27;s characters moved back to California in season 7 after spending the prior year in New York City, Ronnie&#x27;s character dropped his acting aspirations and enrolled in USC, becoming an inveterate girl chaser.

Burns and Allen also took a cue from Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz&#x27;s Desilu Productions and formed a company of their own, McCadden Corporation (named after the street on which Burns&#x27;s brother lived), headquartered on the General Service Studio lot in the heart of Hollywood, and set up to film television shows and commercials. Besides their own hit show (which transitioned from a biweekly live series to a weekly filmed version in 1952), the couple&#x27;s company produced such television series as &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; (later syndicated and rerun as &quot;Love That Bob&quot;); &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot;, starring Jackie Cooper; &quot;Mona McCluskey&quot;, starring Juliet Prowse; and &quot;Mister Ed&quot;, starring Alan Young and a talented &quot;talking&quot; horse. Several of Jack Benny&#x27;s 1953–55 filmed episodes were also produced by McCadden for CBS.

=== &quot;The George Burns Show&quot; ===
&quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot; ran on CBS Television from 1950 to 1958, when Burns at last consented to Allen&#x27;s retirement. The onset of heart trouble in the early 1950s had left her exhausted from full-time work and she had been anxious to stop, but could not say no to Burns.

Burns attempted to continue the show (for new sponsor Colgate-Palmolive on NBC), but without Allen, the show ended after a year.

=== &quot;Wendy and Me&quot; ===
Burns subsequently created &quot;Wendy and Me&quot;, a sitcom in which he co-starred with Connie Stevens, Ron Harper, and J. Pat O&#x27;Malley. He acted primarily as the narrator, and secondarily as the adviser to Stevens&#x27;s Gracie-like character. The first episode involved the nearly 69-year-old Burns watching his younger neighbor&#x27;s activities with amusement, just as he had watched the Burns and Allen television show while it was unfolding to get a jump on what Gracie was up to in its final two seasons. Also as in the Burns and Allen television show, Burns frequently broke the fourth wall by talking directly to viewers. The series only lasted a year. In a promotion, Burns had joked that &quot;Connie Stevens plays Wendy, and I play &#x27;me&#x27;.&quot;

== &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; ==
After Gracie died in 1964, Burns immersed himself in work. McCadden Productions co-produced the television series &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot;, based on the hit Broadway play; Burns also produced Juliet Prowse&#x27;s 1965–66 NBC situation comedy, &quot;Mona McCluskey&quot;. At the same time, he toured the U.S. playing nightclub and theater engagements with such diverse partners as Carol Channing, Dorothy Provine, Jane Russell, Connie Haines, and Berle Davis. He also performed a series of solo concerts, playing university campuses, New York&#x27;s Philharmonic Hall and winding up a successful season at Carnegie Hall, where he wowed a capacity audience with his show-stopping songs, dances, and jokes.

In 1974, Jack Benny signed to play one of the lead roles in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film version of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; (Red Skelton was originally the other, but he objected to some of the script&#x27;s language). But Benny&#x27;s health had begun to fail, and he advised his manager, Irving Fein, to let Burns fill in for him on a series of nightclub dates to which Benny had committed around the U.S.

Burns, who enjoyed working, accepted the job for what would be his first feature film appearance for 36 years. As he recalled years later:
: &quot;The happiest people I know are the ones that are still working. The saddest are the ones who are retired. Very few performers retire on their own. It&#x27;s usually because no one wants them. Six years ago Sinatra announced his retirement. He&#x27;s still 

Ill health prevented Benny from working on &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot;; he died of pancreatic cancer on December 26, 1974. Heartbroken, Burns said that the only time he ever wept in his life other than Allen&#x27;s death was when Benny died. He was chosen to give one of the eulogies at the funeral and said, &quot;Jack was someone special to all of you, but he was so special to me ... I cannot imagine my life without Jack Benny, and I will miss him so very much.&quot; Burns then broke down and had to be helped to his seat. People who knew Burns said he never really came to terms with Benny&#x27;s death.

Six weeks before filming started, Burns had triple bypass surgery.

Burns replaced Benny in the film as well as the club tour, a move that turned out to be one of the biggest breaks of his career; his wise performance as faded vaudevillian Al Lewis won him the 1975 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and permanently secured his career resurgence. At 80, Burns was the oldest Oscar winner in the history of the Academy Awards, a record that stood until Jessica Tandy won an Oscar for &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; in 1989.

== &quot;Oh, God!&quot; ==
In 1977, Burns made another hit film, &quot;Oh, God!&quot;, playing the omnipotent title role opposite singer John Denver as an earnest but befuddled supermarket manager, whom God picks at random to revive his message. The image of Burns in a sailor&#x27;s cap and light springtime jacket as the droll Almighty influenced his subsequent comedic work, as well as that of other comedians. At a celebrity roast in his honor, Dean Martin adapted a Burns crack: &quot;When George was growing up, the Top 10 were the Ten Commandments&quot;.

Burns appeared in this character along with Vanessa Williams on the September 1984 cover of &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine, the issue that contained Williams&#x27;s notorious nude photos, as well as the first appearance of underage pornographic film star Traci Lords. A blurb on the cover announced &quot;Oh God, she&#x27;s nude!&quot;

&quot;Oh, God!&quot; inspired two sequels, &quot;Oh, God! Book II&quot; (in which the Almighty engages a precocious schoolgirl played by Louanne Sirota to spread the word) and &quot;Oh, God! You Devil&quot;—in which Burns played a dual role as God and the devil, with the soul of a would-be songwriter (played by Ted Wass) at stake.

== Later films ==
After guest-starring on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and &quot;Alice&quot;, Burns appeared in 1978&#x27;s &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, the film based on The Beatles&#x27; album of the same name. In 1979, at 83, Burns starred in two feature films, &quot;Just You and Me, Kid&quot; and &quot;Going in Style&quot;. He remained active in films and TV past his 90th birthday. One of his last films was 1988&#x27;s &quot;18 Again!&quot;, based on his half-novelty, half-country music-based hit single, &quot;I Wish I Was 18 Again&quot;. In this film, Burns played an 81-year-old self-made millionaire industrialist who switched bodies with his awkward, artistic, 18-year-old grandson (played by Charlie Schlatter).

Burns also did regular nightclub stand-up acts in his later years, usually portraying himself as a lecherous old man. He always smoked a cigar onstage and reputedly timed his monologues by the amount the cigar had burned down. For this reason, he preferred cheap El Producto cigars as the loosely wrapped tobacco burned longer. Burns once quipped: &quot;In my youth, they called me a rebel. When I was middle-aged, they called me eccentric. Now that I&#x27;m old, I&#x27;m doing the same thing I&#x27;ve always done and they&#x27;re calling me senile.&quot;

Arthur Marx estimated that Burns smoked around 300,000 cigars during his lifetime, starting at age 14. In his final years, he smoked no more than four a day, and he never used cigarettes or marijuana, saying, &quot;Look, I can&#x27;t get any more kicks than I&#x27;m getting. What can marijuana do for me that show business hasn&#x27;t done?&quot; His last feature film role was the cameo role of Milt Lackey, a 100-year-old stand-up comedian, in the 1994 comedy mystery &quot;Radioland Murders&quot;.

== Final years and death ==
Eight years before his death, Burns publicly admitted that once in their marriage, in the 1950s, he had cheated on Allen. In guilt over the one-night affair, Burns gave Allen a $10,000 diamond ring and a $750 silver centerpiece. Allen learned about the affair but never let on to Burns that she knew, and the couple never discussed it.

Burns was still appearing at major hotel/casinos in Las Vegas, Reno, and Lake Tahoe during the early 1980s. When he turned 90 in 1986, the city of Los Angeles renamed the northern end of Hamel Road &quot;George Burns Road.&quot; City regulations prohibited naming a city street after a living person, but an exception was made for Burns. In celebration of Burns&#x27;s 99th birthday in 1995, Los Angeles renamed the eastern end of Alden Drive &quot;Gracie Allen Drive.&quot; Burns was present at the unveiling ceremony (one of his last public appearances), and quipped: &quot;It&#x27;s good to be here at the corner of Burns &amp; Allen. At my age, it&#x27;s good to be anywhere!&quot; George Burns Road and Gracie Allen Drive cross just a few blocks west of the Beverly Center mall in the heart of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Burns served as honorary chairman of the center&#x27;s endowment drive.

Burns remained in good health for most of his life, in part thanks to a daily exercise regimen of swimming, walks, sit-ups, and push-ups. He bought new Cadillacs every year and drove until the age of 93. After that, Burns had chauffeurs drive him around. In his later years, he also had difficulty reading fine print.

Burns suffered a head injury after falling in his bathtub in 1994 and underwent surgery to remove fluid in his skull. He never fully recovered, and his performing career came to an end. In February 1995, Burns, in one of his final television appearances, was presented with the first SAG Lifetime Achievement Award by the Screen Actors Guild. When he was 96, he had signed a lifetime contract with Caesars Palace in Las Vegas to perform stand-up comedy there, which included the guarantee of a show on his centenary, January 20, 1996. But when that day came, he was too weak to give a performance. In December 1995, Burns was well enough to attend a Christmas party hosted by Frank Sinatra (who turned 80 that month), where he reportedly caught the flu, which weakened him further. He released a statement joking about how he would love for his 100th birthday to have &quot;a night with Sharon Stone.&quot; His last television appearance came in a commercial for the Australian Football League&#x27;s centenary season in 1996, which aired after his death.

On 9 March 1996, Burns died in his Beverly Hills home of heart failure. His funeral was held three days later at the Wee Kirk o&#x27; the Heather church in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Glendale. As much as he looked forward to reaching age 100, Burns also said, about a year before he died, that he also looked forward to death, saying that on the day he would die, he would be with Allen again in Heaven. Upon being interred with Allen, the crypt&#x27;s marker was changed from, &quot;Grace Allen Burns—Beloved Wife And Mother (1902–1964)&quot; to &quot;Gracie Allen (1895–1964) &amp; George Burns (1896–1996)—Together Again&quot;. Burns had always said that he wanted Allen to have top billing.

== Legacy ==
George Burns has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: a motion pictures star at 1639 Vine Street, a television star at 6510 Hollywood Boulevard, and a live performance star at 6672 Hollywood Boulevard. The first two stars were placed during the initial installations of 1960, while the third-star ceremony was held in 1984, in the new category of live performance, or live theatre, established that year. Burns is also a member of the Television Hall of Fame, where he and Gracie Allen were inducted in 1988. There is a street named after Burns in San Antonio, Texas.

He is the subject of Rupert Holmes&#x27;s one-actor play &quot;Say Goodnight, Gracie&quot;.

<text>Mysore ( ), officially Mysuru (), is a city in the southern Indian state of Karnataka. It is the headquarters of Mysore district and Mysore division. As the traditional seat of the Wadiyar dynasty, the city functioned as the capital of the Kingdom of Mysore for almost six centuries (). Known for its heritage structures, palaces (such as the famous Mysore Palace), and its culture, Mysore has been called the &quot;City of Palaces&quot;, the &quot;Heritage City&quot;, and the &quot;Cultural capital of Karnataka&quot;. It is the second-most populous in the state and one of the cleanest cities in India according to the Swachh Survekshan.

Mysore is situated at the foothills of the Chamundi Hills. At an altitude of above mean sea level, the city of Mysore is geographically located at 12° 18′ 26″ north latitude and 76° 38′ 59″ east longitude. It is about southwest of the state&#x27;s capital, Bangalore, and spreads across an area of (city and neighbouring census towns). The population of the city combined with its neighbouring towns in its metropolitan area is about 1,288,000 in 2023.

Most of the city&#x27;s development during modern times could be attributed to the maharajas of Mysore and the Wadiyar dynasty, who were patrons of art and culture. Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, when they were briefly in power in succession, also contributed significantly to the economic growth of the city and the kingdom by planting mulberry trees and silk in the region, and fighting four wars against the British. In present days, the Mysore City Corporation is responsible for the civic administration of the city.

During the Dasara festivals, Mysore receives hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world. The city is also the namesake to various art forms and culture, such as Mysore Dasara and Mysore painting; foods such as the sweet delicacy Mysore pak, breakfasts like Mysore Dosa and Mysore Masala Dosa; brands such as Mysore Sandal Soap, Mysore Paints; and styles and cosmetics such as Mysore peta, a traditional silk turban, and the Mysore silk saris. Mysore is also known for betel leaves and its own special variety of jasmine flower fondly referred to as &quot;Mysore mallige&quot;. Tourism is a lifeline industry for the city alongside the traditional industries. Mysore&#x27;s intracity public transportation includes bus and intercity public transportation includes rail, bus, and air.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Mysore&quot; is an anglicised form of &quot;Mahiṣūru&quot;, which means &quot;the abode of &quot;Mahiṣa&quot;&quot; in the vernacular Kannada. The common noun &quot;Mahiṣa,&quot; in Sanskrit, means buffalo; in this context, however, &quot;Mahiṣa&quot; refers to Mahishasura, a mythical demon who could assume the form of either a human or a buffalo, and who, according to Hindu mythology, ruled the ancient parts of Mysore Kingdom, known in Sanskrit as &quot;Mahiṣaka&quot;, centred at &quot;Mahiṣapura&quot;. He was killed by the goddess Chamundeshwari, whose temple is situated atop the Chamundi Hills, after whom it is named. &#x27;Mahishapura&#x27; later became &quot;Mahisūru&quot; (a name which, even now, the royal family uses), and finally came to be rendered as &quot;Mysore&quot; by the British and &quot;Maisūru&quot; (Mysuru) in the vernacular Kannada language.

In December 2005, the Government of Karnataka announced its intention to change the English name of the city to &quot;Mysuru&quot;. This was approved by the Government of India in October 2014, and Mysore was officially renamed, along with twelve other cities, on 1 November 2014.

== History ==

The site where Mysore Palace now stands was occupied by a village named Puragere at the beginning of the 16th century. The Mahishūru Fort was constructed in 1524 by Chamaraja Wodeyar III (1513–1553), who passed on the dominion of &quot;Puragere&quot; to his son Chamaraja Wodeyar IV (1572–1576). Since the 16th century, the name of &quot;Mayashūru&quot; has commonly been used to denote the city. The Kingdom of Mysore, governed by the Wodeyar family, initially served as a vassal state of the Vijayanagara Empire. With the decline of that empire after the Battle of Talikota in 1565, the Mysore Kingdom gradually achieved independence, and by the time of King Narasaraja Wodeyar (1637), it had become a sovereign state. Seringapatam, near Mysore, the present-day Srirangapatna, was the capital of the kingdom beginning in 1610. The 17th century saw a steady expansion of its territory and, under Narasaraja Wodeyar I and Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar, the kingdom annexed large areas of what is now southern Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu, to become a powerful state in the southern Deccan.

The kingdom reached the height of its military power and dominion in the latter half of the 18th century, under the de facto rulers Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan. The latter demolished parts of Mysore to remove legacies of the Wodeyar dynasty. During this time, the kingdom of Mysore came into conflict with the Marathas, the British, and the Nizam of Hyderabad, leading to the four Anglo-Mysore wars, success in the first two of which was followed by defeat in the third and fourth. After Tipu Sultan&#x27;s death in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799, the capital of the kingdom was moved back to Mysore from Seringapatam, and the kingdom was distributed by the British to their allies of the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War. Part of the kingdom was annexed into the Madras Presidency, another to the Nizam of Hyderabad. The landlocked interior of the defeated kingdom of Mysore was turned into a princely state under the suzerainty of the British Crown, with the five-year-old Wodeyar Krishnaraja III as titular ruler and with Purnaiah, who had served under Tipu, as chief minister or &quot;diwan&quot; and Lt. Col. Barry Close as Resident. The British took control of Mysore&#x27;s foreign policy and insisted on an annual tribute for maintaining a standing British army at Mysore. Purnaiah is credited with improving Mysore&#x27;s public works. In 1831, claiming there was maladministration, the British took direct control of the princely state. For the next fifty years, the kingdom of Mysore was under the direct rule of British Commissioners, and in 1831 the city of Mysore lost its status as the administrative centre, when the British Commissioner moved the capital to Bangalore.

In 1876–77, towards the end of the period of direct British rule, Mysore suffered from the Great Famine of 1876–1878, in which nearly a fifth of the population died. In 1881, Maharaja Chamaraja Wadiyar X was given control of Mysore, in a process called rendition, but with a resident British officer and a diwan to handle the Maharaja&#x27;s administration, and the city of Mysore regained its status as the capital. The Mysore municipality was established in 1888 and the city was divided into eight wards. In 1897 an outbreak of bubonic plague killed nearly half of the population of the city. With the establishment of the City Improvement Trust Board (CITB) in 1903, Mysore became one of the first cities in Asia to undertake planned urban development. Public demonstrations and meetings were held there during the Quit India movement and other phases of the Indian independence movement.

Until the independence of British India (which did not include Mysore) in 1947, Mysore remained a Princely State within the British Indian Empire, with the Wodeyars continuing their rule. After Indian Independence, Mysore city remained as part of the Mysore State, now known as Karnataka. Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, then king of Mysore, was allowed to retain his titles and was nominated as the &quot;Rajapramukh&quot; (appointed governor) of the state with a £20,000 payment. He died in September 1974 and was cremated in Mysore.

Over the years, Mysore became well known as a centre for tourism; the city remained largely peaceful, except for occasional riots related to the Kaveri River Water Dispute. Among the events that took place in Mysore and made national headlines were a fire at a television studio that claimed 62 lives in 1989, and the sudden deaths of many animals at the Mysore Zoo.

The &quot;Dasara&quot; festivities, which are celebrated over a ten-day period, were first introduced by King Raja Wodeyar I in 1610. On the ninth day of &quot;Dasara&quot;, called &quot;Mahanavami&quot;, the royal sword is worshipped and is taken on a procession of decorated elephants, camels and horses. On the tenth day, called &quot;Vijayadashami&quot;, the traditional &quot;Dasara&quot; procession (locally known as &quot;Jumboo Savari&quot;) is held on the streets of Mysore which usually falls in the month of September or October. The idol of the goddess Chamundeshwari is placed on a golden &quot;mantapa&quot; on the back of a decorated elephant and taken on a procession, accompanied by tabla, dance groups, music bands, decorated elephants, horses and camels. The procession starts from the Mysore Palace and culminates at a place called Bannimantapa, where the &quot;banni&quot; tree (&quot;Prosopis spicigera&quot;) is worshipped. The &quot;Dasara&quot; festivities culminate on the night of &quot;Vijayadashami&quot; with a torchlight parade, known locally as &quot;Panjina Kavayatthu&quot;.

Mysore is called the &quot;City of Palaces&quot; because of several ornate examples in the city. Among the most notable are Amba Vilas, popularly known as Mysore Palace; Jaganmohana Palace, which also serves as an art gallery; Rajendra Vilas, also known as the summer palace; Lalitha Mahal, which has been converted into a hotel; and Jayalakshmi Vilas.

Mysore is known for rosewood inlay work; around 4,000 craftsmen were involved in this art in 2002. The city lends its name to the Mysore silk sari, a women&#x27;s garment made with pure silk and gold &quot;zari&quot; (thread). &quot;Mysore Peta&quot;, the traditional indigenous turban worn by the erstwhile rulers of Mysore, is worn by men in some traditional ceremonies.

<text>The Maine Coon is a large domesticated cat breed. One of the oldest natural breeds in North America, the breed originated in the U.S. state of Maine, where it is the official state cat.

The Maine Coon is a large and social cat, commonly referred to as &quot;the gentle giant.&quot; The Maine Coon is predominantly known for its size and dense coat of fur which helps it survive in the harsh climate of Maine. The Maine Coon is often cited as having &quot;dog-like&quot; characteristics.

== History ==
The Maine Coon is one of the largest domesticated cats. It has a distinctive physical appearance and valuable hunting skills. The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but its existence became threatened when long-haired breeds from overseas were introduced in the early 20th century. The Maine Coon has since made a comeback, and in 2023 the Maine Coon overtook the Exotic, becoming the second most popular pedigree cat breed in the world.

=== Origin ===

==== Myths ====
Maine Coon cats are known to have originated in Maine. However, their lineage is surrounded by mystery, folk tales, and myths. One myth claims the Maine Coon cat is a hybrid with another animal species, such as the raccoon or bobcat. The second myth states the cats are descendants of Viking ship&#x27;s cats, known today as the Norwegian Forest cats. A third story involves Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France who was executed in 1793. The story goes that before her death, Antoinette attempted to escape from France with the help of Captain Samuel Clough. She loaded Clough&#x27;s ship with her most prized possessions, including six of her favorite Turkish Angora or possibly Siberian cats. Although she did not make it to the United States, all of her pets managed to reach the shore of Wiscasset, Maine, safely, where they bred with other short-haired breeds and developed into the modern breed of the Maine Coon.

==== Science ====
These myths and theories have long speculated that the long-haired Maine Coon cat has to be related to other long-haired breeds, due to their similarities in phenotype. For the Maine Coon in particular, that it is descended from the Norwegian or Siberian Forest cat, brought to New England by settlers or Vikings. Phylogenetic studies showed that the Maine Coon belongs to the Western European monophyletic cat branch, but forms the closest relationship with the random-bred cat population in the Northeastern US (New York region). This Western European branch contains the Norwegian and Siberian Forest cat, but they fall under a different sub-branch.

Maine Coons are descendants of cats brought to New England by Puritan settlers in the 1600-1700s, and out of the European cats they are genetically closest to cats found in the United Kingdom. It is not relatedness that makes them look similar to the Norwegian and Siberian Forest cats, but convergent evolution. These breeds all formed in harsh climates, in which natural selection pressures for similar qualities. Thick, long coats, toe and ear tufts, big bodies, and snowshoe-like big feet, are useful traits in all the harsh climates where these breeds originate.

=== Cat shows and popularity ===
The first mention of Maine Coon cats in a literary work was in 1861, in Frances Simpson&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Cat&quot; (1903). F.R. Pierce, who owned several Maine Coons, wrote a chapter about the breed. During the late 1860s, farmers located in Maine told stories about their cats and held the &quot;Maine State Champion Coon Cat&quot; contest at the local Skowhegan Fair.

In 1895, a dozen Maine Coons were entered into a show in Boston. On 8 May 1895, the first North American cat show was hosted at Madison Square Garden in New York City. A female Maine Coon brown tabby, named Cosey, was entered into the show. Owned by Mrs. Fred Brown, Cosey won the silver collar and medal and was named Best in Show. The silver collar was purchased by the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) Foundation with the help of a donation from the National Capital Cat Show. The collar is housed at the CFA Central Office in the Jean Baker Rose Memorial Library.

In the early 20th century, the Maine Coon&#x27;s popularity began to decline with the introduction of other long-haired breeds, such as the Persian, which originated in the Middle East. The last recorded win by a Maine Coon in a national cat show for over 40 years was in 1911 at a show in Portland, Oregon. The breed was rarely seen after that. The decline was so severe that the breed was declared extinct in the 1950s, although this declaration was considered to be exaggerated and reported prematurely at the time. The Central Maine Cat Club (CMCC) was created in the early 1950s by Ethylin Whittemore, Alta Smith, and Ruby Dyer in an attempt to increase the popularity of the Maine Coon. For 11 years, the CMCC held cat shows and hosted exhibitions of photographs of the breed and is noted for creating the first written breed standards for the Maine Coon.

The Maine Coon was denied provisional breed status—one of the three steps required for a breed not yet recognized by the CFA to be able to compete in championship competitions—by the CFA three times, which led to the formation of the Maine Coon Cat Club in 1973. The breed was accepted by the CFA under provisional status in May 1975, and was approved for championship status in May 1976. The next couple of decades saw a rise in the popularity of the Maine Coon, with championship victories and an increase in national rankings. In 1985, the state of Maine announced that the breed would be named the official state cat.

== Description ==

=== Fur coat ===
The Maine Coon is a long- or medium-haired cat. The coat is soft and silky, although texture may vary with coat color. The length is shorter on the head and shoulders and longer on the stomach and flanks, with some cats having a leonine ruff around their neck. Minimal grooming is required for the breed compared to other long-haired breeds, as their double coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density undercoat. The coat is subject to seasonal variation, with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer.

Maine Coons have several physical adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection when they are walking or sitting on top of wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow. It can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a frozen surface.

Large paws facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside can keep warm more easily.

=== Coat colors ===
Maine Coons can have any colors that other cats have. Colors indicating crossbreeding, such as chocolate, lavender, the Siamese pointed patterns or the &quot;ticked&quot; patterns, are not accepted by some breed standards. This is not universal; the ticked pattern, for example, is accepted by TICA and CFA. The most common pattern seen in the breed is brown tabby. All eye colors are accepted under breed standards, with the exception of blue or odd-eyes, i.e. heterochromia iridium (two eyes of different colors), in cats possessing coat colors other than white.

=== Size ===

The Maine Coon was considered the largest breed of domestic cat until the introduction of the Savannah cat in the mid-1980s, yet it is still the largest non-hybrid breed. On average, males weigh from , with females weighing from . The height of adults can vary between and they can reach a length of up to , including the tail, which can reach a length of and is long, tapering, and heavily furred, almost resembling a raccoon&#x27;s tail. The body is solid and muscular, which is necessary for supporting their weight, and the chest is broad. Maine Coons possess a rectangular body shape and are slow to physically mature; their full size is normally not reached until they are three to five years old, while other cats take about one year.

In 2010, the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; accepted a male purebred Maine Coon named &quot;Stewie&quot; as the &quot;Longest Cat&quot;, measuring from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail. Stewie died on February 4, 2013, from cancer at his home in Reno, Nevada, at age 8. As of 2015 the living record-holder for &quot;Longest Cat&quot; is &quot;Ludo&quot;, measuring . He lives in Wakefield, England, in the United Kingdom. 
Large Maine Coons can overlap in length with Eurasian lynxes, although with a much lighter build and lower height.

=== Polydactylism ===
Many of the original Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism (having one or more extra toes on a paw). With the 1970s revival of the interest in the breed, Maine Coon cats were noted to show an increased incidence of polydactylism compared to other breeds. Subsequently, breeders of show-standard cats were advised to regard this variation as undesirable and to offer affected kittens as household pets. The trait later became separately certified by some organizations, like The International Cat Association (TICA). Meanwhile, in increasing numbers of cat fancy competitions, the trait is no longer marked down.

Polydactylism is rarely, if ever, seen in Maine Coons in the show ring, since it is not allowed by competition standards. The gene for polydactylism is a simple autosomal dominant gene. The polydactylism results from genetic problems which are not encouraged for breeding. Polydactyly in Maine Coon cats is characterised by broad phenotypic diversity. Polydactyly not only affects digit number and conformation, but also carpus and tarsus conformation. The trait was almost eradicated from the breed due to the fact that it was an automatic disqualifier in show rings. Some private organizations and breeders were created in order to preserve polydactylism in Maine Coon cats.

== Health ==
===Life expectancy===
Pet insurance data obtained from a study during years 2003–2006 in Sweden puts the median lifespan of the Maine Coon at &gt; 12.5 years. 74% lived to 10 years or more and 54% lived to 12.5 years or more. A UK study found a life expectancy of 9.71 years compared to 11.74 years overall.

=== Heart ===
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been observed in Maine Coon populations. A mutation in the MYBPC3 gene found in Maine Coons has been associated with HCM.

Of all the Maine Coons tested for the MyBPC mutation at the Veterinary Cardiac Genetics Lab at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington State University, approximately one-third tested positive. Not all cats that test positive will have clinical signs of the disease, and some Maine Coon cats with clinical evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy test negative for this mutation, strongly suggesting that a second mutation exists in the breed. The HCM prevalence was found to be 10.1% (95% CI 5.8 -14.3%) in this study. Early growth and nutrition, larger body size, and obesity may be environmental modifiers of genetic predisposition to HCM.

=== Kidney ===
Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is an inherited condition in cats that causes multiple cysts (pockets of fluid) to form in the kidneys. These cysts are present from birth. Initially, they are very small, but they grow larger over time and may eventually disrupt kidney function, resulting in kidney failure. While renal cysts are observed with a low incidence in Maine Coons, PKD appears to be a misnomer in this particular breed. In a 2013 study, spanning 8 years, renal cysts were documented by ultrasound in 7 of 187 healthy Maine Coons enrolled in a pre-breeding screening programme. The cysts were mostly single and unilateral (6/7, 85.7%), small (mean 3.6 mm in diameter), and located at the corticomedullary junction (4/6, 66.7%). Thus, different in size, number, and location from those observed in Persian-related breeds. In the same study, all six Maine Coon cats with renal cysts tested negative for the PKD1 mutation, proving the disease in these cats to be unrelated to the PKD observed in Persians and related breeds. Gene sequencing of these cats failed to demonstrate any common genetic sequences. Gendron et al. found that &#x27;Maine Coon PKD&#x27; represents a form of juvenile nephropathy other than PKD.

=== Skeletal, joint and muscle ===
Hip dysplasia is an abnormality of the hip joint which can cause crippling lameness and arthritis. The cats most commonly affected with hip dysplasia tend to be males of the larger, big-boned breeds such as Persians and Maine Coons. The relatively smaller size and weight of cats frequently results in symptoms that are less pronounced. X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) between 1974 and 2011 indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons in the database were dysplastic. Dysplasia was more severe in bilateral than unilateral cases and with increasing age.

The Maine Coon is one of the more commonly affected breeds for spinal muscular atrophy. An autosomal recessive mutation in both the LIX1 and LNPEP gene are responsible for the condition in the breed.

=== Other ===
Maine Coons also seem to be predisposed to develop entropion, mainly on the lateral aspect of the eyelids, which can lead to corneal irritation and ulceration, and may require surgery.

<doc id="70025" wikidata="Q7960" url="?curid=70025" title="American Curl">
<text>The American Curl is a cat characterised by its unusual ears, which curl back from the face toward the center of the back of the skull. The breed originated in Lakewood, California, due to a spontaneous mutation.

==History==
The first American Curls appeared as strays on the doorstep of the Rugas in Lakewood, California in June 1981. The black female, named Shulamith, gave birth to a litter of cats with the same curled ears, and so became the ancestor of all American Curls today. In 1986, an American Curl was exhibited at a cat show for the first time, and in 1992, the longhaired American Curl was given championship status by The International Cat Association (TICA). In 1999, the American Curl became the first breed admitted to the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) Championship Class with both longhair and shorthair divisions.
The American Curl is a medium-sized cat , and does not reach maturity until 2–3 years of age. Females should be between and males .

American Curl kittens are born with straight ears, which begin to curl within forty-eight hours. After four months, their ears will not curl any longer, and should be hard and stiff to the touch at the base of the ear with flexible tips. A pet-quality American Curl may have almost straight ears, but showcats must have ears that curl in an arc between 90 and 180 degrees. A 90 degrees is preferable, but cats will be disqualified if their ears touch the back of their skulls.

Both longhaired and shorthaired American Curls have soft, silky coats which lie flat against their bodies. They require little grooming and enjoy spending time with their owners and generally get along well with other animals and people who aren&#x27;t their owners. 

The American Curl, while still an uncommon breed, is found across the world in the United States, Spain, France, Japan, Russia, and many other countries.

==Health==
Various matings between cats with curled ears and cats without curled ears revealed a dominant inheritance of the curl gene. Sex-linked distribution was not found. The mutant gene was designated as curl and is symbolized by Cu. Another mutation of the ear pinna was found in Scottish Fold cats. In these cats both heterozygous and homozygous (FdFd) cats, animals suffer from osteochondrodysplasia. The question arises if homozygous curls (CuCu) could also be affected by cartilage formation defects and bone abnormalities. However, observations of a CuCu cat over two years showed no sign of anomaly.

<doc id="70026" wikidata="Q52939" url="?curid=70026" title="Charles IX of Sweden">
<text>Charles IX, also Carl (; 4 October 1550 – 30 October 1611), reigned as King of Sweden from 1604 until his death. He was the youngest son of King Gustav I () and of his second wife, Margaret Leijonhufvud, the brother of King Eric XIV and of King John III, and the uncle of Sigismund, who became king both of Sweden and of Poland. By his father&#x27;s will Charles received, by way of appanage, the Duchy of Södermanland, which included the provinces of Närke and Värmland; but he did not come into actual possession of them till after the fall of Eric and the succession to the throne of John in 1569.

Both Charles and one of his predecessors, Eric XIV (), took their regnal numbers according to a fictitious history of Sweden. He was actually the third Swedish king called Charles.

He came into the throne by championing the Protestant cause during the increasingly tense times of religious strife between competing sects of Christianity. Just under a decade after his death, these would re-ignite in the Thirty Years&#x27; War of 1618–1648. These conflicts had already caused the dynastic squabble rooted in religious freedom that deposed Charles&#x27; nephew (Sigismund III) and brought Charles to rule as king of Sweden.

His reign marked the start of the final chapter (dated 1648 by some) both of the Reformation and of the Counter-Reformation. With the death of his brother John III of Sweden in November 1592, the Swedish throne went to his nephew, the Habsburg ally Sigismund of Poland and Sweden. During these tense political times, Charles viewed the inheritance of the throne of Protestant Sweden by his devout Catholic nephew with alarm. Several years of religious controversy and discord followed.

While King Sigismund resided in Poland, Charles and the Swedish privy council ruled in Sigismund&#x27;s name. After various preliminaries, the Riksdag of the Estates forced Sigismund to abdicate the throne to Charles IX in 1595. This eventually kicked off nearly seven decades of sporadic warfare as the two lines of the divided House of Vasa both continued to attempt to remake the union between the Polish and Swedish thrones with opposing counter-claims and dynastic wars.

Quite likely, the dynastic outcome between the Swedish and Polish representatives of the House of Vasa exacerbated and radicalized the later actions of Europe&#x27;s Catholic princes in the German states such as the Edict of Restitution of 1629. In fact, it worsened European politics to the abandonment or prevention of settling events by diplomacy and compromise during the vast bloodletting of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

==Duke==
In 1568, he was the real leader of the rebellion against Eric XIV. However, he took no part in the designs of his brother John III against the unhappy king after his deposition. Charles&#x27;s relations with John were always more or less strained. He was at least suspected of being implicated in the Mornay Plot to depose John III in 1574, and was one of the alternative regents suggested by the conspirators of the 1576 Plot. He had no sympathy with John&#x27;s High-Church tendencies on the one hand, and he sturdily resisted all the king&#x27;s endeavours to restrict his authority as Duke of Södermanland on the other. The nobility and the majority of the Riksdag of the Estates supported John. However, in his endeavours to unify the realm, and Charles had consequently (1587) to resign his pretensions to autonomy within his duchy. But, steadfast Lutheran as he was, on the religious question he was immovable. The matter came to a crisis on the death of John III in 1592. The heir to the throne was John&#x27;s eldest son, Sigismund III Vasa, already king of Poland and a devoted Catholic. The fear that Sigismund might re-catholicize the land alarmed the Protestant majority in Sweden—particularly the commoners and lower nobility, and Charles came forward as their champion, and also as the defender of the Vasa dynasty against foreign interference.

It was due entirely to him that Sigismund &quot;as king-elect&quot; was forced to confirm the resolutions at the Uppsala Synod in 1593, thereby recognizing the fact that Sweden was essentially a Lutheran Protestant state. Under the agreement, Charles and the Swedish Privy Council shared power and ruled in Sigismund&#x27;s place since he resided in Poland. In the ensuing years 1593–1595, Charles&#x27;s task was extraordinarily difficult. He had steadily to oppose Sigismund&#x27;s reactionary tendencies and directives; he had also to curb the nobility which sought to increase their power at the expense of the absent king, which he did with cruel rigor.

Necessity compelled him to work with the clergy and people rather than the gentry; hence it was that the Riksdag of the Estates assumed under his regency government a power and an importance which it had never possessed before. In 1595, the Riksdag of Söderköping elected Charles regent, and his attempt to force Klas Fleming, governor of Finland, to submit to his authority, rather than to that of the king, provoked a civil war. Charles sought to increase his power and the king attempted to manage the situation by diplomacy over several years, until fed up, Sigismund got permission from the Commonwealth&#x27;s legislature to pursue the matters dividing his Swedish subjects, and invaded with a mercenary army.

In April 1597, after having subdued the Cudgel War and preparing to resist the expected invasion of Charles, Fleming died and was succeeded as governor by Arvid Stålarm the Younger. In August 1597, Charles and his army invaded Österland, took Åland, which was the fief of her sister Queen Dowager Catherine, and besieged Turku Castle. Fleming was still not buried, and, according to legend, Charles had the coffin opened to reassure himself that Fleming was indeed dead. After having identified the face of Fleming, he was to have pulled Fleming&#x27;s beard with the words, &quot;If you had been alive, your head would not have been safe&quot;, upon which Fleming&#x27;s wife Ebba Stenbock replied, &quot;If my late husband was alive, Your Grace would never have been here.&quot;

Despite some initial successes, Sigismund lost the decisive Battle of Stångebro and was captured. He was then forced to surrender several Swedish noblemen, whom Charles and the Riksdag of the Estates had named traitors. These noblemen were later executed in what became known as the Linköping Bloodbath. With Sigismund defeated and exiled—seen as both an outsider and a heretic by most of the Swedish nation—his formal deposition by the Riksdag of the Estates in 1599 served as both a natural vindication of Charles&#x27;s actions and a retroactive legitimization of his claim to power. In the same session, the Riksdag named Charles as regent.

==King==
Finally, the Riksdag at Linköping, 24 February 1604 declared that Sigismund abdicated the Swedish throne, that duke Charles was recognized as the sovereign. He was declared king as Karl IX (anglicized as Charles IX). Charles&#x27;s short reign was one of uninterrupted warfare. The hostility of Poland and the breakup of Russia involved him in overseas contests for the possession of Livonia and Ingria, the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1611) and the Ingrian War, while his pretensions to claim Lappland brought upon him a war with Denmark-Norway in the last year of his reign.

In all these struggles, he was more or less unsuccessful, owing partly to the fact that he and his forces had to oppose superior generals (e.g. Jan Karol Chodkiewicz and Christian IV of Denmark) and partly to sheer ill-luck. Compared with his foreign policy, the domestic policy of Charles IX was comparatively unimportant. It aimed at confirming and supplementing what had already been done during his regency. He did not officially become king until 22 March 1604. The first deed in which the title appears is dated 20 March 1604; but he was not crowned until 15 March 1607.

==Death and legacy==

Four and a half years later Charles IX died at Nyköping, 30 October 1611 when he was succeeded by his seventeen-year-old son Gustavus Adolphus ; he had participated in the wars. As a ruler, Charles is the link between his great father and his still greater son. He consolidated the work of Gustav I, the creation of a great Protestant state; he prepared the way for the erection of the Protestant empire of Gustavus Adolphus.

==Ancestors==

==Children==
He married, firstly, Anna Marie of Palatinate-Simmern (1561–1589), daughter of Louis VI, Elector Palatine (1539–1583) and Elisabeth of Hesse (1539–1584). Their children were:

* Margareta Elisabeth (1580–1585)
* Elisabeth Sabina (1582–1585)
* Louis (1583–1583)
* Catherine (1584–1638), married a prince of the Palatinate Zweibrücken, becoming mother of Charles X Gustav.
* Gustav (1587–1587)
* Maria (1588–1589)

In 1592 he married his second wife Christina of Holstein-Gottorp (1573–1625), daughter of Adolf of Holstein-Gottorp (1526–1586) and Christine of Hesse (1543–1604), and first cousin of his previous wife. Their children were:

* Christina (1593–1594)
* Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden (Gustav II Adolf) (1594–1632)
* Maria Elizabeth (1596–1618), married her first cousin Duke John, youngest son of John III of Sweden
* Charles Philip (1601–1622)

He also had a son with his mistress, Karin Nilsdotter:
* Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm (1574–1650), Field Marshal

<doc id="70048" wikidata="Q209" url="?curid=70048" title="Rectangle">
<text>In Euclidean plane geometry, a rectangle is a rectilinear convex polygon or a quadrilateral with four right angles. It can also be defined as: an equiangular quadrilateral, since equiangular means that all of its angles are equal (360°/4 = 90°); or a parallelogram containing a right angle. A rectangle with four sides of equal length is a &quot;square&quot;. The term &quot;&quot; is used to refer to a non-square rectangle. A rectangle with vertices &quot;ABCD&quot; would be denoted as .

The word rectangle comes from the Latin &quot;rectangulus&quot;, which is a combination of &quot;rectus&quot; (as an adjective, right, proper) and &quot;angulus&quot; (angle).

A [[#Crossed rectangles|crossed rectangle]] is a crossed (self-intersecting) quadrilateral which consists of two opposite sides of a rectangle along with the two diagonals (therefore only two sides are parallel). It is a special case of an antiparallelogram, and its angles are not right angles and not all equal, though opposite angles are equal. Other geometries, such as spherical, elliptic, and hyperbolic, have so-called rectangles with opposite sides equal in length and equal angles that are not right angles.

Rectangles are involved in many tiling problems, such as tiling the plane by rectangles or tiling a rectangle by polygons.

==Characterizations==
A convex quadrilateral is a rectangle if and only if it is any one of the following:
* a parallelogram with at least one right angle
* a parallelogram with diagonals of equal length
* a parallelogram &quot;ABCD&quot; where triangles &quot;ABD&quot; and &quot;DCA&quot; are congruent
* an equiangular quadrilateral
* a quadrilateral with four right angles
* a quadrilateral where the two diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other
* a convex quadrilateral with successive sides &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; whose area is formula_1.
* a convex quadrilateral with successive sides &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; whose area is formula_2

==Classification==
===Traditional hierarchy===
A rectangle is a special case of a parallelogram in which each pair of adjacent sides is perpendicular.

A parallelogram is a special case of a trapezium (known as a trapezoid in North America) in which &quot;both&quot; pairs of opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.

A trapezium is a convex quadrilateral which has at least one pair of parallel opposite sides.

A convex quadrilateral is
* Simple: The boundary does not cross itself.
* Star-shaped: The whole interior is visible from a single point, without crossing any edge.

===Alternative hierarchy===
De Villiers defines a rectangle more generally as any quadrilateral with axes of symmetry through each pair of opposite sides. This definition includes both right-angled rectangles and crossed rectangles. Each has an axis of symmetry parallel to and equidistant from a pair of opposite sides, and another which is the perpendicular bisector of those sides, but, in the case of the crossed rectangle, the first axis is not an axis of symmetry for either side that it bisects.

Quadrilaterals with two axes of symmetry, each through a pair of opposite sides, belong to the larger class of quadrilaterals with at least one axis of symmetry through a pair of opposite sides. These quadrilaterals comprise isosceles trapezia and crossed isosceles trapezia (crossed quadrilaterals with the same vertex arrangement as isosceles trapezia).

==Properties==

===Symmetry===
A rectangle is cyclic: all corners lie on a single circle.

It is equiangular: all its corner angles are equal (each of 90 degrees).

It is isogonal or vertex-transitive: all corners lie within the same symmetry orbit.

It has two lines of reflectional symmetry and rotational symmetry of order 2 (through 180°).

===Rectangle-rhombus duality===
The dual polygon of a rectangle is a rhombus, as shown in the table below.
* The figure formed by joining, in order, the midpoints of the sides of a rectangle is a rhombus and vice versa.

===Miscellaneous===
A rectangle is a rectilinear polygon: its sides meet at right angles.

A rectangle in the plane can be defined by five independent degrees of freedom consisting, for example, of three for position (comprising two of translation and one of rotation), one for shape (aspect ratio), and one for overall size (area).

Two rectangles, neither of which will fit inside the other, are said to be incomparable.

==Formulae==

If a rectangle has length formula_3 and width formula_4, then:
* it has area formula_5;
* it has perimeter formula_6;
* each diagonal has length formula_7; and
* when formula_8, the rectangle is a square.

==Theorems==
The isoperimetric theorem for rectangles states that among all rectangles of a given perimeter, the square has the largest area.

The midpoints of the sides of any quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals form a rectangle.

A parallelogram with equal diagonals is a rectangle.

The Japanese theorem for cyclic quadrilaterals states that the incentres of the four triangles determined by the vertices of a cyclic quadrilateral taken three at a time form a rectangle.

The British flag theorem states that with vertices denoted &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;, for any point &quot;P&quot; on the same plane of a rectangle:
:formula_9

For every convex body &quot;C&quot; in the plane, we can inscribe a rectangle &quot;r&quot; in &quot;C&quot; such that a homothetic copy &quot;R&quot; of &quot;r&quot; is circumscribed about &quot;C&quot; and the positive homothety ratio is at most 2 and formula_10.

There exists a unique rectangle with sides formula_11 and formula_12, where formula_11 is less than formula_12, with two ways of being folded along a line through its center such that the area of overlap is minimized and each area yields a different shapea triangle and a pentagon. The unique ratio of side lengths is formula_15.

==Crossed rectangles==
A &quot;crossed&quot; &quot;quadrilateral&quot; (self-intersecting) consists of two opposite sides of a non-self-intersecting quadrilateral along with the two diagonals. Similarly, a crossed rectangle is a &quot;crossed quadrilateral&quot; which consists of two opposite sides of a rectangle along with the two diagonals. It has the same vertex arrangement as the rectangle. It appears as two identical triangles with a common vertex, but the geometric intersection is not considered a vertex.

A &quot;crossed quadrilateral&quot; is sometimes likened to a bow tie or butterfly, sometimes called an &quot;angular eight&quot;. A three-dimensional rectangular wire frame that is twisted can take the shape of a bow tie.

The interior of a &quot;crossed rectangle&quot; can have a polygon density of ±1 in each triangle, dependent upon the winding orientation as clockwise or counterclockwise.

A &quot;crossed rectangle&quot; may be considered equiangular if right and left turns are allowed. As with any &quot;crossed quadrilateral&quot;, the sum of its interior angles is 720°, allowing for internal angles to appear on the outside and exceed 180°.

A rectangle and a crossed rectangle are quadrilaterals with the following properties in common:
* Opposite sides are equal in length.
* The two diagonals are equal in length.
* It has two lines of reflectional symmetry and rotational symmetry of order 2 (through 180°).

==Other rectangles==
In spherical geometry, a spherical rectangle is a figure whose four edges are great circle arcs which meet at equal angles greater than 90°. Opposite arcs are equal in length. The surface of a sphere in Euclidean solid geometry is a non-Euclidean surface in the sense of elliptic geometry. Spherical geometry is the simplest form of elliptic geometry.

In elliptic geometry, an elliptic rectangle is a figure in the elliptic plane whose four edges are elliptic arcs which meet at equal angles greater than 90°. Opposite arcs are equal in length.

In hyperbolic geometry, a hyperbolic rectangle is a figure in the hyperbolic plane whose four edges are hyperbolic arcs which meet at equal angles less than 90°. Opposite arcs are equal in length.

==Tessellations==
The rectangle is used in many periodic tessellation patterns, in brickwork, for example, these tilings:
==Squared, perfect, and other tiled rectangles==
A rectangle tiled by squares, rectangles, or triangles is said to be a &quot;squared&quot;, &quot;rectangled&quot;, or &quot;triangulated&quot; (or &quot;triangled&quot;) rectangle respectively. The tiled rectangle is &quot;perfect&quot; if the tiles are similar and finite in number and no two tiles are the same size. If two such tiles are the same size, the tiling is &quot;imperfect&quot;. In a perfect (or imperfect) triangled rectangle the triangles must be right triangles. A database of all known perfect rectangles, perfect squares and related shapes can be found at squaring.net. The lowest number of squares need for a perfect tiling of a rectangle is 9 and the lowest number needed for a perfect tilling a square is 21, found in 1978 by computer search.

A rectangle has commensurable sides if and only if it is tileable by a finite number of unequal squares. The same is true if the tiles are unequal isosceles .

The tilings of rectangles by other tiles which have attracted the most attention are those by congruent non-rectangular polyominoes, allowing all rotations and reflections. There are also tilings by congruent polyaboloes.

<text>Carl Gustaf Christer Pettersson (23 April 1947 – 29 September 2004) was a Swedish criminal who was a suspect in the 1986 assassination of Olof Palme, the Prime Minister of Sweden. In 1989 he was convicted of the murder in district court but acquitted on appeal the following year.

== Early life ==
Pettersson was born on 23 April 1947, to Roland Pettersson (1916–1977) and Inga Maria Hansson (1918–1973) and grew up in a middle-class family in Solna outside of Stockholm and later moved to the suburb of Sollentuna. In his youth, he attended a theatrical school (&quot;Calle Flygares teaterskola&quot;), where he was considered to be promising by at least one of his teachers. However, Pettersson suffered a head injury from which he would never fully recover. Petterson then began a period of substance abuse, which would eventually force him to drop out of school.

In 1970, he stabbed a man to death in central Stockholm, during a street brawl in what the Swedish press dubbed the &quot;bayonet murder&quot;. The killing took place just around the corner from what would later be the site of the Palme assassination. Pettersson was sentenced to closed psychiatric care for manslaughter for the killing. After less than two years he was released and continued a life of petty crime, which financed his alcohol and drug abuse.

=== Tried for murder of Olof Palme ===

On the night of 28 February 1986, Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, a Social Democrat, was shot and killed in Stockholm as he walked home from a cinema with his wife, Lisbet Palme. The killer quickly escaped and left no traces except two .357-caliber Magnum bullets. Witness statements about his appearance were confused and contradictory.

In 1988, Pettersson was detained and accused of Palme&#x27;s murder after an investigation, which appeared to have started based on rumors about his involvement among fellow small-time criminals and drug addicts. The initial investigation had uncovered little of significance, but once detained, Pettersson was picked out from a ten-person police lineup by Lisbet Palme.

Pettersson denied any involvement and claimed he had liked Palme and had left central Stockholm at the time of the murder.

However, Lisbet Palme&#x27;s identification, combined with statements by acquaintances of Pettersson, who stated that he had been near the scene of the crime at the night of the murder, led to a 1989 conviction for murder. Pettersson was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Just a few months later, however, Pettersson was freed on appeal. The court cited a lack of evidence, including the missing murder weapon, and raised questions over the reliability of Lisbet Palme&#x27;s identification. Pettersson was awarded about $50,000 in compensation.

Although Pettersson appears to have quickly spent the money on alcohol and drugs, he remained in the media spotlight and then raised his income by selling TV and newspaper interviews. In several interviews, particularly on TV3, Pettersson was encouraged to admit to killing Olof Palme. In such situations, he repeatedly engaged in what-if scenarios that came close to an admission of guilt. However, his confession was not treated seriously, and when cornered, he argued that he had simply come seeking money for yet another television appearance.

Police investigators continued to investigate Pettersson, with many reportedly feeling that he had got off on a technicality and was in fact guilty. In 1998, the Swedish Supreme Court rejected a prosecutor&#x27;s appeal to retry Pettersson by citing that the new evidence put before it was &quot;not of such nature that a new trial can be granted in the case.&quot;

== Coma and death ==

After a brawl with police, Pettersson was admitted to hospital on 15 September 2004. On leaving hospital the following day, he reportedly fell and suffered a cerebral haemorrhage and went into a coma. Pettersson died at Karolinska University Hospital on 29 September 2004, at the age of 57. 

Pettersson was buried in Sollentuna on 20 January 2005.

<doc id="70052" wikidata="Q125445" url="?curid=70052" title="Temple of Heaven">
<text>The Temple of Heaven () is a complex of imperial religious buildings situated in the southeastern part of central Beijing. The complex was visited by the Emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties for annual ceremonies of prayer to Heaven for a good harvest. The Temple of Heaven was inscribed as a World Heritage site in 1998 and was described as &quot;a masterpiece of architecture and landscape design which simply and graphically illustrates a cosmogony of great importance for the evolution of one of the world&#x27;s great civilizations...&quot; as the &quot;symbolic layout and design of the Temple of Heaven had a profound influence on architecture and planning in the Far East over many centuries.&quot;

==History==
The temple complex was constructed from 1406 to 1420 during the reign of the Yongle Emperor of Ming Dynasty, who was also responsible for the construction of the Forbidden City in Beijing. It is currently located in Dongcheng Beijing, China. The complex was extended and renamed Temple of Heaven during the reign of the Jiajing Emperor in the 16th century. Jiajing also built three other prominent temples in Beijing, the Temple of the Sun (日壇) in the east, the Temple of Earth (地壇) in the north, and the Temple of Moon (月壇) in the west. The Temple of Heaven was renovated in the 18th century under the Qianlong Emperor. By then, the state budget was insufficient, so this was the last large-scale renovation of the temple complex in imperial times. 

The temple was occupied by the Anglo-French alliance during the Second Opium War. In 1900, during the Boxer Rebellion, the Eight-Nation Alliance occupied the temple complex and turned it into the force&#x27;s temporary command in Peking, which lasted for one year. With the downfall of the Qing, the temple complex was left un-managed. The neglect of the temple complex led to the collapse of several halls in the following years.

In 1914, Yuan Shikai, then President of the Republic of China, performed a Ming prayer ceremony at the temple, as part of an effort to have himself declared Emperor of China. In 1918 the temple was turned into a park and for the first time open to the public.

==Buildings and layout==

The Temple grounds cover of parkland and comprises three main groups of constructions, all built according to strict philosophical requirements:

* The Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests (祈年殿) is a magnificent triple-gabled circular building, in diameter and tall, built on three levels of marble stone base, where the Emperor prayed for good harvests. The building is completely wooden, with no nails. The original building was burned down by a fire caused by lightning in 1889. The current building was re-built several years after the incident.
* The Imperial Vault of Heaven (皇穹宇) is a single-gabled circular building, built on a single level of marble stone base. It is located south of the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests and resembles it, but is smaller. It is surrounded by a smooth circular wall, the Echo Wall, that can transmit sounds over large distances. The Imperial Vault is connected to the Hall of Prayer by the Vermilion Steps Bridge, a raised walkway that slowly ascends from the Vault to the Hall of Prayer. The dome for this building also has no crossbeams to support the dome.
* The Circular Mound Altar (圜丘坛) is the altar proper, located south of the Imperial Vault of Heaven. It is an empty circular platform on three levels of marble stones, each decorated by lavishly carved dragons. The numbers of various elements of the Altar, including its balusters and steps, are either the sacred number nine or its nonuples. The center of the altar is a round slate called the Heart of Heaven (天心石) or the Supreme Yang (太阳石), where the Emperor prayed for favorable weather. Thanks to the design of the altar, the sound of the prayer will be reflected by the guardrail, creating significant resonance, which was supposed to help the prayer communicate with Heaven. The Altar was built in 1530 by the Jiajing Emperor and rebuilt in 1740.

==Ceremony==
In ancient China, the Emperor of China was regarded as the &quot;Son of Heaven&quot;, who administered earthly matters on behalf of, and representing, heavenly authority. To be seen to be showing respect to the source of his authority, in the form of sacrifices to heaven, was extremely important. The temple was built for these ceremonies, mostly comprising prayers for good harvests.

Twice a year the Emperor and all his retinue would move from the Forbidden City through Beijing to encamp within the complex, wearing special robes and abstaining from eating meat. No ordinary Chinese was allowed to view this procession or the following ceremony. In the temple complex the Emperor would personally pray to Heaven for good harvests. The highpoint of the ceremony at the winter solstice was performed by the Emperor on the Earthly Mount. The ceremony had to be perfectly completed; it was widely held that the smallest of mistakes would constitute a bad omen for the whole nation in the coming year.

==Symbolism==
Earth was represented by a square and Heaven by a circle; several features of the temple complex symbolize the connection of Heaven and Earth, of circle and square. The whole temple complex is surrounded by two cordons of walls; the outer wall has a taller, semi-circular northern end, representing Heaven, and a shorter, rectangular southern end, representing the Earth. Both the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests and the Circular Mound Altar are round, each standing on a square yard, again representing Heaven and Earth. 
The number nine represents the Emperor and is evident in the design of the Circular Mound Altar: a single round marmor plate is surrounded by a ring of nine plates, then a ring of 18 plates, and so on for a total of nine surrounding rings, the outermost having 9×9 plates.

The Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests has four inner, twelve middle and twelve outer pillars, representing the four seasons, twelve months and twelve traditional Chinese hours respectively. Combined, the twelve middle and twelve outer pillars represent the traditional solar terms. 
All the buildings within the Temple have special dark blue roof tiles, representing the Heaven.

The Seven-Star Stone Group, east of the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest, represents the seven peaks of Taishan Mountain, a place of Heaven worship in classical China.

There are four main supportive, dragon pillars each representing a season. The structure, held up by these dragons, imitates the style of an ancient Chinese royal palace. Twelve inner pillars symbolize the lunar months, and it is thought that the twelve outer pillars refer to the 12 two-hour periods of the day.

==Park==
The surrounding park is quite extensive, with the entire complex totaling . Some of it consists of playgrounds, exercise and game areas. These facilities are well used by adults, as well as by parents and grandparents bringing children to play. Some of the open spaces and side buildings are often used, particularly in the morning, for choral shows, ethnic dances, and other presentations.

==Access==
The Temple of Heaven is located in southern Dongcheng District, which until 2010 was part of Chongwen District. The park itself is open daily from 6:00am–10:00 pm. The relic sites inside the park open at 8:00 and close at 17:30 from April 1 to October 31, and close at 17:00 from November 1 to March 31. There is a nominal entry charge which varies according to whether it is peak season or off season. Tickets stop selling one hour and a half before gate closing.

All four of the park&#x27;s gates are accessible by public transportation.

<text>In Norse mythology, Brokkr (Old Norse: , &quot;the one who works with metal fragments; blacksmith&quot;, anglicized Brokk) is a dwarf, and the brother of Eitri or Sindri.

According to &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Loki had Sif&#x27;s hair, Freyr&#x27;s ship Skíðblaðnir and Odin&#x27;s spear Gungnir fashioned by the Sons of Ivaldi. Loki boasted greatly of all the things that the Sons of Ivaldi could create. He also boasted that the other dwarves could not create anything beautiful or useful. Brokkr, who was in Asgard at the time, declared that his brother Eitri could make things far more beautiful and useful than the Sons of Ivaldi. Brokkr bet his head with that of Loki that his brother Eitri could make things with better craftsmanship than Skíðblaðnir or Gungnir.

While Eitri used magic in a forge that was extremely hot, Brokkr worked the bellows so that the fire would not cool down nor get too hot for the magic. While making the boar Gullinbursti, a gadfly, often thought to be Loki himself, came and bit Brokkr on the hand. Brokkr was not disturbed though and kept blowing into the fire. While making the golden arm ring Draupnir the gadfly came again and bit Brokkr, this time in the neck but Brokkr kept on blowing. Finally, while making the hammer Mjölnir the gadfly bit Brokkr on the eye this time. This temporarily caused Brokkr to stop blowing. That brief stoppage of blowing into the fire caused Mjölnir&#x27;s handle to become shorter than it should have been. Because of this, Thor had to wear the iron gauntlets Járngreipr to handle it.

Eitri succeeded in making the golden ring Draupnir, the golden-bristled boar Gullinbursti and the hammer Mjölnir. These objects were judged by the gods to be superior and Brokkr won the bet. However, Loki did not allow him to take his head as doing so would have damaged his neck which was not included in the bet. In lieu of this, Brokkr sewed Loki&#x27;s lips so that Loki would not brag until the thread came out.

<text>In the Old Norse religion, Eitri (Old Norse: ; or Sindri) is a dwarf and the brother of Brokkr.
According to &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, when Loki had Sif&#x27;s hair, Freyr&#x27;s ship Skidbladnir and Odin&#x27;s spear Gungnir fashioned by the Sons of Ivaldi, he bet his own head with Brokkr that Eitri would not have been able to make items that matched the craftsmanship of those mentioned above.

Eitri began working in his furnace while his brother was working the bellows, but a fly (sometimes thought to be Loki himself) began stinging Brokkr, trying to stop him and spoil the items.

Eitri succeeded in making the golden boar Gullinbursti, the golden ring Draupnir, and the hammer Mjöllnir that made his brother win the bet, even if its handle was shorter than it should have been.

<text>The First Fleet were 11 British ships which transported a group of settlers to mainland Australia, marking the beginning of the European colonisation of Australia. It consisted of two Royal Navy vessels, three storeships and six convict transports under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip. On 13 May 1787, the ships, with over 1,400 convicts, marines, sailors, colonial officials and free settlers onboard, left Portsmouth and travelled over and over 250 days before arriving in Botany Bay on 18 January 1788. Governor Arthur Phillip rejected Botany Bay choosing instead Port Jackson, to the north, as the site for the new colony; they arrived there on 26 January 1788, establishing the colony of New South Wales, as a penal colony which would become the first British settlement in Australia.

==History==
Lord Sandwich, together with the President of the Royal Society, Sir Joseph Banks, the eminent scientist who had accompanied Lieutenant James Cook on his 1770 voyage, was advocating establishment of a British colony in Botany Bay, New South Wales. Banks accepted an offer of assistance from the American Loyalist James Matra in July 1783. Under Banks&#x27;s guidance, he rapidly produced &quot;A Proposal for Establishing a Settlement in New South Wales&quot; (24 August 1783), with a fully developed set of reasons for a colony composed of American Loyalists, Chinese and South Sea Islanders (but not convicts). The decision to establish a colony in Australia was made by Thomas Townshend, Lord Sydney, Secretary of State for the Home Office. This was taken for two reasons: the ending of transportation of criminals to North America following the American Revolution, as well as the need for a base in the Pacific to counter French expansion.

In September 1786, Captain Arthur Phillip was appointed Commodore of the fleet, which came to be known as the First Fleet, which was to transport the convicts and soldiers to establish a colony at Botany Bay. Upon arrival there, Phillip was to assume the powers of Captain General and Governor in Chief of the new colony. A subsidiary colony was to be founded on Norfolk Island, as recommended by Sir John Call and Sir George Young, to take advantage for naval purposes of that island&#x27;s native flax (harakeke) and timber.

The cost to Britain of outfitting and dispatching the Fleet was £84,000 (about £9.6 million, or $19.6 million as of 2015).

==Ships==

===Royal Naval escort===
On 25 October 1786 the 10-gun , lying in the dock at Deptford, was commissioned, and the command given to Phillip. The armed tender HMAT was under command of Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball, who was also commissioned to join the expedition. Lt. David Blackburn was the ship&#x27;s Master. On 15 December, Captain John Hunter was assigned as second captain to &quot;Sirius&quot; to command in the absence of Phillip, whose presence, it was to be supposed, would be requisite at all times wherever the seat of government in that country might be fixed.

====HMS &quot;Sirius&quot;====
&quot;Sirius&quot; was Phillip&#x27;s flagship for the fleet. She had been converted from the merchantman &quot;Berwick&quot;, built in 1780 for Baltic trade. She was a 520 ton, sixth-rate vessel, originally armed with ten guns, four six-pounders and six carronades, Phillip had ten more guns placed aboard.

====HMAT &quot;Supply&quot;====
&quot;Supply&quot; was designed in 1759 by shipwright Thomas Slade, as a yard craft for the ferrying of naval supplies. Measuring 170 tons, she had two masts, and was fitted with four small 3-pounder cannons and six -pounder swivel guns. Her armament was substantially increased in 1786 with the addition of four 12-pounder carronades.

===Convict transports===
===Food and supply transports===
Ropes, crockery, agricultural equipment and a miscellany of other stores were needed. Items transported included tools, agricultural implements, seeds, spirits, medical supplies, bandages, surgical instruments, handcuffs, leg irons and a prefabricated wooden frame for the colony&#x27;s first Government House. The party had to rely on its own provisions to survive until it could make use of local materials, assuming suitable supplies existed, and grow its own food and raise livestock.

====&quot;Golden Grove&quot;====
The reverend Richard Johnson, chaplain for the colony, travelled on the &quot;Golden Grove&quot; with his wife and servants.

===Legacy===
Scale models of all the ships are on display at the Museum of Sydney. The models were built by ship makers Lynne and Laurie Hadley, after researching the original plans, drawings and British archives. The replicas of &quot;Supply&quot;, &quot;Charlotte&quot;, &quot;Scarborough&quot;, &quot;Friendship&quot;, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, &quot;Lady Penrhyn&quot;, &quot;Borrowdale&quot;, &quot;Alexander&quot;, &quot;Sirius&quot;, &quot;Fishburn&quot; and &quot;Golden Grove&quot; are made from Western Red or Syrian Cedar.

Nine Sydney harbour ferries built in the mid-1980s are named after First Fleet vessels. The unused names are &quot;Lady Penrhyn&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;.

==People==
The majority of the people travelling with the fleet were convicts, all having been tried and convicted in Great Britain, almost all of them in England. Many are known to have come to England from other parts of Great Britain and, especially, from Ireland; at least 14 are known to have come from the British colonies in North America; at least 15 are identified as black (born in Britain, Africa, the West Indies, North America, India or a European country or its colony). The convicts had committed a variety of crimes, including theft, perjury, fraud, assault, robbery, for which they had variously been sentenced to death, which was then commuted to penal transportation for 7 years, 14 years, or the term of their natural life.

Four companies of marines volunteered for service in the colony, these marines made up the New South Wales Marine Corps, under the command of Major Robert Ross, a detachment on board every convict transport. The families of marines also made the voyage.

A number of people on the First Fleet kept diaries and journals of their experiences, including the surgeons, sailors, officers, soldiers, and ordinary seamen. There are at least eleven known manuscript journals of the First Fleet in existence as well as some letters.

The exact number of people directly associated with the First Fleet will likely never be established, as accounts of the event vary slightly. A total of 1,420 people have been identified as embarking on the First Fleet in 1787, and 1,373 are believed to have landed at Sydney Cove in January 1788. In her biographical dictionary of the First Fleet, Mollie Gillen gives the following statistics:

While the names of all crew members of &quot;Sirius&quot; and &quot;Supply&quot; are known, the six transports and three store ships may have carried as many as 110 more seamen than have been identified – no complete musters have survived for these ships. The total number of persons embarking on the First Fleet would, therefore, be approximately 1,530 with about 1,483 reaching Sydney Cove.

According to the first census of 1788 as reported by Governor Phillip to Lord Sydney, the non-indigenous population of the colony was 1,030 and the colony also consisted of 7 horses, 29 sheep, 74 swine, 6 rabbits, and 7 cattle.

The following statistics were provided by Governor Phillip:
The chief surgeon for the First Fleet, John White, reported a total of 48 deaths and 28 births during the voyage. The deaths during the voyage included one marine, one marine&#x27;s wife, one marine&#x27;s child, 36 male convicts, four female convicts, and five children of convicts.

==Voyage==
===Preparing the fleet===
In September 1786 Captain Arthur Phillip was chosen to lead the expedition to establish a colony in New South Wales. On 15 December, Captain John Hunter, was appointed Phillip&#x27;s second. By now had been nominated as flagship, with Hunter holding command. The armed tender HMAT under command of Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball had also joined the fleet.

With Phillip in London awaiting Royal Assent for the bill of management of the colony, the loading and provisioning of the transports was carried out by Lieutenant John Shortland, the agent for transports.

On 16 March 1787, the fleet began to assemble at its appointed rendezvous, the Mother Bank, Isle of Wight. His Majesty&#x27;s frigate &quot;Sirius&quot; and armed tender &quot;Supply&quot;, three store-ships, &quot;Golden Grove&quot;, &quot;Fishburn&quot; and &quot;Borrowdale&quot;, for carrying provisions and stores for two years; and lastly, six transports; &quot;Scarborough&quot; and &quot;Lady Penrhyn&quot;, from Portsmouth; &quot;Friendship&quot; and &quot;Charlotte&quot;, from Plymouth; &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, and &quot;Alexander&quot;, from Woolwich. On 9 May Captain Phillip arrived in Portsmouth, the next day coming aboard the ships and giving orders to prepare the fleet for departure.

===Leaving Portsmouth===
Phillip first tried to get the fleet to sail on 10 May, but a dispute by sailors of the &quot;Fishburn&quot; about pay, they refused to leave until resolved. The fleet finally left Portsmouth, England on 13 May 1787. The journey began with fine weather, and thus the convicts were allowed on deck. The Fleet was accompanied by the armed frigate until it left English waters. On 20 May 1787, one convict on &quot;Scarborough&quot; reported a planned mutiny; those allegedly involved were flogged and two were transferred to &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. In general, however, most accounts of the voyage agree that the convicts were well behaved. On 3 June 1787, the fleet anchored at Santa Cruz at Tenerife. Here, fresh water, vegetables and meat were brought on board. Phillip and the chief officers were entertained by the local governor, while one convict tried unsuccessfully to escape. On 10 June they set sail to cross the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro, taking advantage of favourable trade winds and ocean currents.

The weather became increasingly hot and humid as the Fleet sailed through the tropics. Vermin, such as rats, and parasites such as bedbugs, lice, cockroaches and fleas, tormented the convicts, officers and marines. Bilges became foul and the smell, especially below the closed hatches, was over-powering. While Phillip gave orders that the bilge-water was to be pumped out daily and the bilges cleaned, these orders were not followed on &quot;Alexander&quot; and a number of convicts fell sick and died. Tropical rainstorms meant that the convicts could not exercise on deck as they had no change of clothes and no method of drying wet clothing. Consequently, they were kept below in the foul, cramped holds. On the female transports, promiscuity between the convicts, the crew and marines was rampant, despite punishments for some of the men involved. In the doldrums, Phillip was forced to ration the water to three pints a day.

The Fleet reached Rio de Janeiro on 5 August and stayed for a month. The ships were cleaned and water taken on board, repairs were made, and Phillip ordered large quantities of food. The women convicts&#x27; clothing had become infested with lice and was burnt. As additional clothing for the female convicts had not arrived before the Fleet left England, the women were issued with new clothes made from rice sacks. While the convicts remained below deck, the officers explored the city and were entertained by its inhabitants. A convict and a marine were punished for passing forged quarter-dollars made from old buckles and pewter spoons. Ellen Fraser, mother of the second child of English parents born in the colony (John Fraser born 7 June 1789), is thought to be the female convict transferred from the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; to the &quot; Charlotte&quot; during the stop over in Rio on 13 August 1787. Her husband, William Fraser was a convict on &quot;Charlotte&quot;.
The Fleet left Rio de Janeiro on 4 September to run before the westerlies to the Table Bay in southern Africa, which it reached on 13 October. This was the last port of call, so the main task was to stock up on plants, seeds and livestock for their arrival in Australia. The livestock taken on board from Cape Town destined for the new colony included two bulls, seven cows, one stallion, three mares, 44 sheep, 32 pigs, four goats and &quot;a very large quantity of poultry of every kind&quot;. Women convicts on &quot;Friendship&quot; were moved to other transports to make room for livestock purchased there. The convicts were provided with fresh beef and mutton, bread and vegetables, to build up their strength for the journey and maintain their health. The Dutch colony of Cape Town was the last outpost of European settlement which the fleet members would see for years, perhaps for the rest of their lives. &quot;Before them stretched the awesome, lonely void of the Indian and Southern Oceans, and beyond that lay nothing they could imagine.&quot;

Assisted by the gales in the &quot;Roaring Forties&quot; latitudes below the 40th parallel, the heavily laden transports surged through the violent seas. In the last two months of the voyage, the Fleet faced challenging conditions, spending some days becalmed and on others covering significant distances; &quot;Friendship&quot; travelled 166 miles one day, while a seaman was blown from &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; at night and drowned. Water was rationed as supplies ran low, and the supply of other goods including wine ran out altogether on some vessels. Van Diemen&#x27;s Land was sighted from &quot;Friendship&quot; on 4 January 1788. A freak storm struck as they began to head north around the island, damaging the sails and masts of some of the ships.

On 25 November, Phillip had transferred to &quot;Supply&quot;. With &quot;Alexander&quot;, &quot;Friendship&quot; and &quot;Scarborough&quot;, the fastest ships in the Fleet, which were carrying most of the male convicts, &quot;Supply&quot; hastened ahead to prepare for the arrival of the rest. Phillip intended to select a suitable location, find good water, clear the ground, and perhaps even have some huts and other structures built before the others arrived. This was a planned move, discussed by the Home Office and the Admiralty prior to the Fleet&#x27;s departure. However, this &quot;flying squadron&quot; reached Botany Bay only hours before the rest of the Fleet, so no preparatory work was possible. &quot;Supply&quot; reached Botany Bay on 18 January 1788; the three fastest transports in the advance group arrived on 19 January; slower ships, including &quot;Sirius&quot;, arrived on 20 January.

This was one of the world&#x27;s greatest sea voyages – eleven vessels carrying about 1,487 people and stores had travelled for 252 days for more than 15,000 miles (24,000 km) without losing a ship. Forty-eight people died on the journey, a death rate of just over three percent.

=== Arrival in Australia ===

It was soon realised that Botany Bay did not live up to the glowing account that the explorer Captain James Cook had provided. The bay was open and unprotected, the water was too shallow to allow the ships to anchor close to the shore, fresh water was scarce, and the soil was poor. First contact was made with the local indigenous people, the Eora, who seemed curious but suspicious of the newcomers. The area was studded with enormously strong trees. When the convicts tried to cut them down, their tools broke and the tree trunks had to be blasted out of the ground with gunpowder. The primitive huts built for the officers and officials quickly collapsed in rainstorms. The marines had a habit of getting drunk and not guarding the convicts properly, whilst their commander, Major Robert Ross, drove Phillip to despair with his arrogant and lazy attitude. Crucially, Phillip worried that his fledgling colony was exposed to attack from those described as &quot;Aborigines&quot; or from foreign powers. Although his initial instructions were to establish the colony at Botany Bay, he was authorised to establish the colony elsewhere if necessary.

On 21 January, Phillip and a party which included John Hunter, departed the Bay in three small boats to explore other bays to the north. Phillip discovered that Port Jackson, about 12 kilometres to the north, was an excellent site for a colony with sheltered anchorages, fresh water and fertile soil. Cook had seen and named the harbour, but had not entered it. Phillip&#x27;s impressions of the harbour were recorded in a letter he sent to England later: &quot;the finest harbour in the world, in which a thousand sail of the line may ride in the most perfect security ...&quot;. The party returned to Botany Bay on 23 January.

On the morning of 24 January, the party was startled when two French ships, the &quot;Astrolabe&quot; and the &quot;Boussole&quot;, were seen just outside Botany Bay. This was a scientific expedition led by Jean-François de La Pérouse. The French had expected to find a thriving colony where they could repair ships and restock supplies, not a newly arrived fleet of convicts considerably more poorly provisioned than themselves. There was some cordial contact between the French and British officers, but Phillip and La Pérouse never met. The French ships remained until 10 March before setting sail on their return voyage. They were not seen again and were later discovered to have been shipwrecked off the coast of Vanikoro in the present-day Solomon Islands.

On 26 January 1788, the Fleet weighed anchor and sailed to Port Jackson. The site selected for the anchorage had deep water close to the shore, was sheltered, and had a small stream flowing into it. Phillip named it Sydney Cove, after Lord Sydney, the British Home Secretary. This date is celebrated as Australia Day, marking the beginning of British settlement. Contrary to popular belief, the British flag was not officially planted until 7 February 1788 when possession was formally proclaimed. There was, as always, a British naval ensign erected at the site of the military encampment, and this had been performed on the evening of 25 January 1788 in a small ceremony conducted by Phillip and some officers and marines from &quot;Supply&quot;, with the remainder of &quot;Supply&quot;″s crew and the convicts observing from on board ship. The remaining ships of the Fleet did not arrive at Sydney Cove until later that day. Writer and art critic Robert Hughes popularized the idea in his 1986 book &quot;The Fatal Shore&quot; that an orgy occurred upon the unloading of the convicts, though more modern historians regard this as untrue, since the first reference to any such indiscretions is as recent as 1963.

=== First contact ===
The First Fleet encountered Indigenous Australians when they landed at Botany Bay. The Cadigal people of the Botany Bay area witnessed the Fleet arrive and six days later the two ships of French explorer La Pérouse, the &quot;Astrolabe&quot; and the &quot;Boussole&quot;, sailed into the bay. When the Fleet moved to Sydney Cove seeking better conditions for establishing the colony, they encountered the Eora people, including the Bidjigal clan. A number of the First Fleet journals record encounters with Aboriginal people.

Although the official policy of the British Government was to establish friendly relations with Aboriginal people, and Arthur Phillip ordered that the Aboriginal people should be well treated, it was not long before conflict began. The colonists did not sign treaties with the original inhabitants of the land. Between 1790 and 1810, Pemulwuy of the Bidjigal clan led the local people in a series of attacks against the colonists.

=== After January 1788 ===
The ships of the First Fleet mostly did not remain in the colony. Some returned to England, while others left for other ports. Some remained at the service of the Governor of the colony for some months: some of these were sent to Norfolk Island where a second penal colony was established.

1788
* 15 February – HMAT &quot;Supply&quot; sails for Norfolk Island carrying a small party to establish a settlement.
* 5/6 May – &quot;Charlotte&quot;, &quot;Lady Penrhyn&quot; and &quot;Scarborough&quot; set sail for China.
* 14 July – &quot;Borrowdale&quot;, &quot;Alexander&quot;, &quot;Friendship&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; set sail to return to England.
* 2 October – &quot;Golden Grove&quot; sets sail for Norfolk Island with a party of convicts, returning to Port Jackson 10 November, while HMS &quot;Sirius&quot; sails for Cape of Good Hope for supplies.
* 19 November – &quot;Fishburn&quot; and &quot;Golden Grove&quot; set sail for England. This means that only HMAT &quot;Supply&quot; now remains in Sydney cove.

1789
* 23 December – carrying stores for the colony strikes an iceberg and is forced back to the Cape. It never reaches the colony in New South Wales.

1790:
* 19 March – HMS &quot;Sirius&quot; is wrecked off Norfolk Island.
* 17 April – HMAT &quot;Supply&quot; sent to Batavia, Dutch East Indies, for emergency food supplies.
* 3 June – &quot;Lady Juliana&quot;, the first of six vessels of the Second Fleet, arrives in Sydney cove. The remaining five vessels of the Second Fleet arrive in the ensuing weeks.
* 19 September – HMAT &quot;Supply&quot; returns to Sydney having chartered the Dutch vessel &quot;Waaksamheyd&quot; to accompany it carrying stores.

===Last survivors===
On Sat 26 January 1842 The &quot;Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser&quot; reported &quot;The Government has ordered a pension of one shilling per diem to be paid to the survivors of those who came by the first vessel into the Colony. The number of these really &#x27;old hands&#x27; is now reduced to three, of whom, two are now in the Benevolent Asylum, and the other is a fine hale old fellow, who can do a day&#x27;s work with more spirit than many of the young fellows lately arrived in the Colony.&quot; The names of the three recipients were not given, and is academic as the notice turned out to be false, not having been authorised by the Governor. There were at least 25 persons still living who had arrived with the First Fleet, including several children born on the voyage. A number of these contacted the authorities to arrange their pension and all received a similar reply to the following received by John McCarty on 14 Mar 1842 &quot;I am directed by His Excellency the Governor to inform you, that the paragraph which appeared in the Sydney Gazette relative to an allowance to the persons of the first expedition to New South Wales was not authorised by His Excellency nor has he any knowledge of such an allowance as that alluded to&quot;. E. Deas Thomson, Colonial Secretary.

Following is a list of persons known to be living at the time the false pension notice was published, in order of their date of death. At this time New South Wales included the whole Eastern seaboard of present day Australia except for Van Diemen&#x27;s Land which was declared a separate colony in 1825 and achieved self governing status in 1855-6. This list does not include marines or convicts who returned to England after completing their term in NSW and who may have lived past January 1842.

* Rachel Earley: (or Hirley), convict per &quot;Friendship&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; died 27 April 1842 at Kangaroo Point, VDL (said to be aged 75).
* Roger Twyfield: convict per &quot;Friendship&quot; died 30 April 1842 at Windsor, aged 98 (NSW reg as Twifield).
* Thomas Chipp: marine private per &quot;Friendship&quot; died 3 July 1842, buried Parramatta, aged 81 (NSW Reg age 93).
* Anthony Rope: convict per &quot;Alexander&quot; died 20 April 1843 at Castlereagh NSW, aged 84 (NSW Reg age 89).
* William Hubbard: Hubbard was convicted in the Kingston Assizes in Surrey, England, on 24 March 1784 for theft. He was transported to Australia on &quot;Scarborough&quot; in the First Fleet. He married Mary Goulding on 19 December 1790 in Rose Hill. In 1803 he received a land grant of 70 acres at Mulgrave Place. He died on 18 May 1843 at the Sydney Benevolent Asylum. His age was given as 76 when he was buried at Christ Church St. Lawrence, Sydney on 22 May 1843.
* Thomas Jones: convict per &quot;Alexander&quot; died October 1843 in NSW, aged 87.
* John Griffiths: marine private per &quot;Friendship&quot; who died 5 May 1844 at Hobart, aged 86.

* John McCarty: McCarty was a marine private who sailed on &quot;Friendship&quot;. McCarty claimed to have been born in Killarney, County Kerry, Ireland, &quot;circa&quot; Christmas 1745. He first served in the colony of New South Wales, then at Norfolk Island where he took up a land grant of 60 acres (Lot 71). He married first fleet convict Ann Beardsley on Norfolk Island in November 1791 after his marine discharge a month earlier. In 1808, at the impending closure of the Norfolk Island settlement, he resettled in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land later taking a land grant (80 acres at Herdsman&#x27;s Cove Melville) in lieu of the one forfeited on Norfolk Island. The last few years of his life were spent at the home of Mr. William H. Budd, at the Kinlochewe Inn near Donnybrook, Victoria. McCarty was buried on local land 24 July 1846, six months past his 100 birthday, although this is very likely an exaggerated age.
* John Alexander Herbert: convict per &quot;Scarborough&quot; died 19 November 1846 at Westbury Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, aged 79.
* Robert Nunn: convict per &quot;Scarborough&quot; died 20 November 1846 at Richmond, aged 86.
* John Howard: convict per &quot;Scarborough&quot; died 1 January 1847 at Sydney Benevolent Asylum, aged 94.

He helped to pitch the first tent in Sydney, and remembered the first display of the British flag there, which was hoisted on a swamp oak-tree, then growing on a spot now occupied as the Water-Police Court. He was the last of those called the &#x27;first-fleeters&#x27; (arrivals by the first convict ships) and, notwithstanding his great age, retained his faculties to the last.&quot; John Limeburner was a convict on &quot;Charlotte&quot;. He was convicted on 9 July 1785 at New Sarum, Wiltshire of theft of a waistcoat, a shirt and stockings. He married Elizabeth Ireland in 1790 at Rosehill and together they establish a 50-acre farm at Prospect.

* John Jones: Jones was a marine private on the First Fleet and sailed on &quot;Alexander&quot;. He is listed in the N.S.W. 1828 Census as aged 82 and living at the Sydney Benevolent Asylum. He is said to have died at the Benevolent Asylum in 1848.
* Jane/Jenny Rose: (nee Jones), child of convict Elizabeth Evans per &quot;Lady Penrhyn&quot; died 29 August 1849 at Wollongong, aged 71.
* Samuel King: King was a scribbler (a worker in a scribbling mill) before he became a marine. He was a marine with the First Fleet on board . He shipped to Norfolk Island on &quot;Golden Grove&quot; in September 1788, where he lived with Mary Rolt, a convict who arrived with the First Fleet on &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. He received a grant of 60 acres (Lot No. 13) at Cascade Stream in 1791. Mary Rolt returned to England on &quot;Britannia&quot; in October 1796. King was resettled in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, boarding &quot;City of Edinburgh&quot; on 3 September 1808, and landed in Hobart on 3 October. He married Elizabeth Thackery on 28 January 1810. He died on 21 October 1849 at 86 years of age and was buried in the Wesleyan cemetery at Lawitta Road, Back River.
* Mary Stevens: (nee Phillips), convict per &quot;Charlotte&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; died 22 January 1850 at Longford Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, aged 81.

* Lydia Munro: (m.Goodwin) per &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; died 29 June 1856 at Hobart, reg as Letitia Goodwin, aged 85.
* Elizabeth Thackery: Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; King (née Thackery) was tried and convicted of theft on 4 May 1786 at Manchester Quarter Sessions, and sentenced to seven years&#x27; transportation. She sailed on &quot;Friendship&quot;, but was transferred to &quot;Charlotte&quot; at the Cape of Good Hope. She was shipped to Norfolk Island on in 1790 and lived there with James Dodding. In August 1800 she bought 10 acres of land from Samuel King at Cascade Stream. Elizabeth and James were relocated to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land in December 1807 but parted company sometime afterwards. On 28 January 1810 Elizabeth married &quot;First Fleeter&quot; Private Samuel King (above) and lived with him until his death in 1849. Betty King died in New Norfolk, Tasmania on 7 August 1856, aged 89 years.

===Smallpox===
Historians have disagreed over whether those aboard the First Fleet were responsible for introducing smallpox to Australia&#x27;s indigenous population, and if so, whether this was the consequence of deliberate action.

In 1914, J. H. L. Cumpston, director of the Australian Quarantine Service, put forward the hypothesis that smallpox arrived in Australia with First Fleet. Some researchers have argued that any such release may have been a deliberate attempt to decimate the indigenous population. Hypothetical scenarios for such an action might have included: an act of revenge by an aggrieved individual, a response to attacks by indigenous people, or part of an orchestrated assault by the New South Wales Marine Corps, intended to clear the path for colonial expansion. Seth Carus, a former Deputy Director of the National Defense University in the United States wrote in 2015 that there was a &quot;strong circumstantial case supporting the theory that someone deliberately introduced smallpox in the Aboriginal population.&quot;
Other historians have disputed the idea that there was a deliberate release of smallpox virus and/or suggest that it arrived with visitors to Australia other than the First Fleet. It has been suggested that live smallpox virus may have been introduced accidentally when Aboriginal people came into contact with variolous matter brought by the First Fleet for use in anti-smallpox inoculations.

In 2002, historian Judy Campbell offered a further theory, that smallpox had arrived in Australia through contact with fishermen from Makassar in Indonesia, where smallpox was endemic. In 2011, Macknight stated: &quot;The overwhelming probability must be that it [smallpox] was introduced, like the later epidemics, by [Indonesian] trepangers ... and spread across the continent to arrive in Sydney quite independently of the new settlement there.&quot;

There is a fourth theory, that the 1789 epidemic was not smallpox but chickenpox – to which indigenous Australians also had no inherited resistance – that happened to be affecting, or was carried by, members of the First Fleet. This theory has also been disputed.

===Commemoration Garden===
After Ray Collins, a stonemason, completed years of research into the First Fleet, he sought approval from about nine councils to construct a commemorative garden in recognition of these immigrants. Liverpool Plains Shire Council was ultimately the only council to accept his offer to supply the materials and construct the garden free of charge. The site chosen was a disused caravan park on the banks of Quirindi Creek at Wallabadah, New South Wales. In September 2002 Collins commenced work on the project. Additional support was later provided by Neil McGarry in the form of some signs and the council contributed $28,000 for pathways and fencing. Collins hand-chiselled the names of all those who came to Australia on the eleven ships in 1788 on stone tablets along the garden pathways. The stories of those who arrived on the ships, their life, and first encounters with the Australian country are presented throughout the garden. On 26 January 2005, the First Fleet Garden was opened as the major memorial to the First Fleet immigrants. Previously the only other specific memorial to the First Fleeters was an obelisk at Brighton-Le-Sands, New South Wales. The surrounding area has a barbecue, tables, and amenities.

=== First Fleet Park ===
First Fleet Park is situated in The Rocks, near the site of the First Fleet&#x27;s landing. The area has remained in public ownership continually since 1788, under the control of various agencies. It was previously used for a hospital, Queen&#x27;s Wharf, shops and houses, the first Commissariat Store and the first post office. Archaeological remains are extant on the site dating back to the earliest days of settlement.

<doc id="70068" wikidata="Q244032" url="?curid=70068" title="Skaði">
<text>In Norse mythology, Skaði (; Old Norse: ; sometimes anglicized as Skadi, Skade, or Skathi) is a jötunn and goddess associated with bowhunting, skiing, winter, and mountains. Skaði is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in the works of skalds.
Skaði is the daughter of the deceased Þjazi, and Skaði married the god Njörðr as part of the compensation provided by the gods for killing her father Þjazi. In &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, Skaði is described as having split up with Njörðr and as later having married the god Odin, and that the two produced many children together. In both the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Skaði is responsible for placing the serpent that drips venom onto the bound Loki. Skaði is alternately referred to as Öndurguð (Old Norse &#x27;ski god&#x27;) and Öndurdís (Old Norse &#x27;ski dís&#x27;).

The etymology of the name &quot;Skaði&quot; is uncertain, but may be connected with the original form of &quot;Scandinavia&quot;. Some place names in Scandinavia refer to Skaði. Scholars have theorized a potential connection between Skaði and the god Ullr (who is also associated with skiing), a particular relationship with the jötunn Loki, and that &quot;Scandinavia&quot; may be related to the name Skaði (potentially meaning &#x27;Skaði&#x27;s island&#x27;) or the name may be connected to Old Norse nouns meaning either &#x27;shadow&#x27; or &#x27;harm&#x27;. Skaði has inspired various works of art.

==Etymology==
The Old Norse name &quot;Skaði&quot;, along with &quot;Sca(n)dinavia&quot; and &quot;Skáney&quot;, may be related to Gothic &quot;skadus&quot;, Old English &quot;sceadu&quot;, Old Saxon &quot;scado&quot;, and Old High German &quot;scato&quot; (meaning &#x27;shadow&#x27;) - compare also the Irish Scáthach, a famous woman warrior known as &#x27;the shadowy one&#x27;. Scholar John McKinnell comments that this etymology suggests Skaði may have once been a personification of the geographical region of Scandinavia or associated with the underworld.

Georges Dumézil disagrees with the notion of &quot;Scadin-avia&quot; as etymologically &#x27;the island of the goddess Skaði&#x27;. Dumézil comments that the first element &quot;Scadin&quot; must have had—or once had—a connection to &quot;darkness&quot; &quot;or something else we cannot be sure of&quot;. Dumézil says that, rather, the name &quot;Skaði&quot; derives from the name of the geographical region, which was at the time no longer completely understood. In connection, Dumézil points to a parallel in &quot;Ériu&quot;, a goddess personifying Ireland that appears in some Irish texts, whose name he says comes from &quot;Ireland&quot; rather than the other way around.

Alternatively, &quot;Skaði&quot; may be connected with the Old Norse noun &quot;skaði&quot; (&#x27;harm&#x27;), source of the Icelandic and Faroese &quot;&quot; (&#x27;harm, damage&#x27;) and cognate with English &quot;scathe&quot; (&quot;unscathed&quot;, &quot;scathing&quot;).

==Attestations==
Skaði is attested in poems found in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, in two books of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and in one &quot;Heimskringla&quot; book.

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===

In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, the god Odin (disguised as &quot;Grímnir&quot;) reveals to the young Agnarr the existence of twelve locations. Odin mentions the location Þrymheimr sixth in a single stanza. In the stanza, Odin details that the jötunn Þjazi once lived there, and that now his daughter Skaði does. Odin describes Þrymheimr as consisting of &quot;ancient courts&quot; and refers to Skaði as &quot;the shining bride of the gods&quot;. In the prose introduction to the poem &quot;Skírnismál&quot;, the god Freyr has become heartsick for a fair girl (the jötunn Gerðr) he has spotted in Jötunheimr. The god Njörðr asks Freyr&#x27;s servant Skírnir to talk to Freyr, and in the first stanza of the poem, Skaði also tells Skírnir to ask Freyr why he is so upset. Skírnir responds that he expects harsh words from their son Freyr.

In the prose introduction to the poem &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, Skaði is referred to as the wife of Njörðr and is cited as one of the goddesses attending Ægir&#x27;s feast. After Loki has an exchange with the god Heimdallr, Skaði interjects. Skaði tells Loki that he is &quot;light-hearted&quot; and that Loki will not be &quot;playing [...] with [his] tail wagging free&quot; for much longer, for soon the gods will bind Loki to a sharp rock with the ice-cold entrails of his son. Loki responds that, even if this is so, he was &quot;first and foremost&quot; at the killing of Þjazi. Skaði responds that, if this is so, &quot;baneful advice&quot; will always flow from her &quot;sanctuaries and plains&quot;. Loki responds that Skaði was more friendly in speech when Skaði was in his bed—an accusation he makes to most of the goddesses in the poem and is not attested elsewhere. Loki&#x27;s flyting then turns to the goddess Sif.

In the prose section at the end of &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, the gods catch Loki and bind him with the innards of his son Nari, while they turn his son Váli into a wolf. Skaði places a venomous snake above Loki&#x27;s face. Venom drips from the snake and Loki&#x27;s wife Sigyn sits and holds a basin beneath the serpent, catching the venom. When the basin is full, Sigyn must empty it, and during that time the snake venom falls onto Loki&#x27;s face, causing him to writhe in a tremendous fury, so much so that all earthquakes stem from Loki&#x27;s writhings.

In the poem &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;, the female jötunn Hyndla tells the goddess Freyja various mythological genealogies. In one stanza, Hyndla notes that Þjazi &quot;loved to shoot&quot; and that Skaði was his daughter.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Skaði is attested in two books: &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;.

====&quot;Gylfaginning&quot;====
In chapter 23 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the enthroned figure of High details that Njörðr&#x27;s wife is Skaði, that she is the daughter of the jötunn Þjazi, and recounts a tale involving the two. High recalls that Skaði wanted to live in the home once owned by her father called Þrymheimr. However, Njörðr wanted to live nearer to the sea. Subsequently, the two made an agreement that they would spend nine nights in Þrymheimr and then the next three nights in Njörðr&#x27;s sea-side home Nóatún (or nine winters in Þrymheimr and another nine in Nóatún according to the &quot;Codex Regius&quot;.). However, when Njörðr returned from the mountains to Nóatún, he said:

:&quot;Hateful for me are the mountains,
:I was not long there,
:only nine nights.
:The howling of the wolves
:sounded ugly to me
:after the song of the swans.&quot;

Skaði responded:

:&quot;Sleep I could not
:on the sea beds
:for the screeching of the bird.
:That gull wakes me
:when from the wide sea
:he comes each morning.&quot;

The sources for these stanzas are not provided in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; or elsewhere. High says that afterward Skaði went back up to the mountains and lived in Þrymheimr, and there Skaði often travels on skis, wields a bow, and shoots wild animals. High notes that Skaði is also referred to as &quot;ski god&quot; (Old Norse &quot;Öndurgud&quot;) or Öndurdis and the &quot;ski lady&quot; (&quot;Öndurdís&quot;). In support, the above-mentioned stanza from the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot; is cited. In the next chapter (24), High says that &quot;after this&quot;, Njörðr &quot;had two children&quot;: Freyr and Freyja. The name of the mother of the two children is not provided here.

At the end of chapter 51 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High describes how the gods caught and bound Loki. Skaði is described as having taken a venomous snake and fastening it above the bound Loki, so that the venom may drip on to Loki&#x27;s face. Loki&#x27;s wife Sigyn sat by his side and caught the venom in a bowl. But when the bowl becomes full, she must leave to empty it, and then Loki is burned by the acidic liquid and he writhes in extreme pain, causing the earth to shake and resulting in what we know as an earthquake.

====&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;====

In chapter 56 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Bragi recounts to Ægir how the gods killed Þjazi. Þjazi&#x27;s daughter, Skaði, took a helmet, a coat of mail, and &quot;all weapons of war&quot; and traveled to Asgard, the home of the gods. Upon Skaði&#x27;s arrival, the gods wished to atone for her loss and offered compensation. Skaði provides them with her terms of settlement, and the gods agree that Skaði may choose a husband from among themselves. However, Skaði must choose this husband by looking solely at their feet. Skaði saw a pair of feet that she found particularly attractive and said &quot;I choose that one; there can be little that is ugly about Baldr.&quot; However, the owner of the feet turned out to be Njörðr.

Skaði also included in her terms of settlement that the gods must do something she thought impossible for them to do: make her laugh. To do so, Loki tied one end of a cord around the beard of a nanny goat and the other end around his testicles. The goat and Loki drew one another back and forth, both squealing loudly. Loki dropped into Skaði&#x27;s lap, and Skaði laughed, completing this part of her atonement. Finally, in compensation to Skaði, Odin took Þjazi&#x27;s eyes, plunged them into the sky, and from the eyes made two stars.

Further in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, a work by the skald Þórðr Sjáreksson is quoted. The poem refers to Skaði as &quot;the wise god-bride&quot; and notes that she &quot;could not love the Van&quot;. Prose below the quote clarifies that this is a reference to Skaði&#x27;s leaving of Njörðr. In chapter 16, names for Loki are given, including &quot;wrangler of Heimdall and Skaði&quot;. In chapter 22, Skaði is referenced in the 10th century poem &quot;Haustlöng&quot; where the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir refers to an ox as &quot;bow-string-Var&#x27;s [Skaði&#x27;s] whale&quot;. In chapter 23, the skald Bragi Boddason refers to Þjazi as the &quot;father of the ski-dis&quot;. In chapter 32, Skaði is listed among six goddesses who attend a party held by Ægir. In chapter 75, Skaði is included among a list of 27 ásynjur names.

===&quot;Heimskringla&quot;===
In chapter 8 of the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; book &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, Skaði appears in an euhemerized account. This account details that Skaði had once married Njörðr but that she would not have sex with him, and that later Skaði married Odin. Skaði and Odin had &quot;many sons&quot;. Only one of the names of these sons is provided: Sæmingr, a king of Norway. Two stanzas are presented by the skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir in reference. In the first stanza, Skaði is described as a jötunn and a &quot;fair maiden&quot;. A portion of the second stanza is missing. The second stanza reads:

:Of sea-bones,
:and sons many
:the ski-goddess
:gat with Óthin

Lee Hollander explains that &quot;bones-of-the-sea&quot; is a kenning for &quot;rocks&quot;, and believes that this defective stanza undoubtedly referred to Skaði as a &quot;dweller of the rocks&quot; in connection with her association with mountains and skiing.

==Theories==

===&quot;Völsunga saga&quot;===

Another figure by the name of Skaði who appears in the first chapter of &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;. In the chapter, this Skaði—who is male—is the owner of a thrall by the name of Breði. Another man, Sigi—a son of Odin—went hunting one winter with the thrall. Sigi and the thrall Breði hunted throughout the day until evening, when they compared their kills. Sigi saw that the thrall&#x27;s kills outdid his own, and so Sigi killed Breði and buried Breði&#x27;s corpse in a snowdrift.

That night, Sigi returned home and claimed that Breði had ridden out into the forest, that he had lost sight of Breði, and that he furthermore did not know what became of the thrall. Skaði doubted Sigi&#x27;s explanation, suspected that Sigi was lying, and that Sigi had instead killed Breði. Skaði gathered men together to look for Breði and the group eventually found the corpse of Breði in a snowdrift. Skaði declared that henceforth the snowdrift should be called &quot;Breði&#x27;s drift,&quot; and ever since then people have referred to large snow drifts by that name. The fact that Sigi murdered Breði was evident, and so Sigi was considered an outlaw. Led by Odin, Sigi leaves the land, and Skaði is not mentioned again in the saga.

Scholar Jesse Byock notes that the goddess Skaði is also associated with winter and hunting, and that the episode in &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; involving the male Skaði, Sigi, and Breði has been theorized as stemming from an otherwise lost myth.

===Other===
Scholar John Lindow comments that the episode in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; detailing Loki&#x27;s antics with a goat may have associations with castration and a ritual involving making a goddess laugh. Lindow notes that Loki and Skaði appear to have had a special relationship, an example being Skaði&#x27;s placement of the snake over Loki&#x27;s face in &quot;Lokasenna&quot; and &quot;Gylfaginning.&quot;

Due to their shared association with skiing and the fact that both place names referring to Ullr and Skaði appear most frequently in Sweden, some scholars have proposed a particular connection between the two gods. On the other hand, &quot;Skaði&quot; may potentially be a masculine form and, as a result, some scholars have theorized that Skaði may have originally been a male deity.

Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson proposes that Skaði&#x27;s cult may have thrived in Hålogaland, a province in northern Norway, because &quot;she shows characteristics of the Sami people, who were renowned for skiing, shooting with the bow and hunting; her separation from Njord might point to a split between her cult and that of the Vanir in this region, where Scandinavians and the Sami were in close contact.&quot;

==Modern influence==
Modern works of art depicting Skaði include &quot;Skadi und Niurd&quot; (illustration, 1883) by K. Ehrenberg and &quot;Skadi&quot; (1901) by Emil Doepler the Younger. Skaði also appears in Adam Oehlenschläger&#x27;s poem (1819) &quot;Skades Giftermaal&quot;. 

Art deco depictions of both the god Ullr (1928) and Skaði (1929) appear on covers of the Swedish ski annual &quot;På Skidor&quot;, both skiing and wielding bows. E. John B. Allen notes that the deities are portrayed in a manner that &quot;give[s] historical authority to this most important of Swedish ski journals, which began publication in 1893&quot;. 

A moon of the planet Saturn (Skathi) and a mountain on Venus (Skadi Mons) are named after the goddess.

<text>The Weirdstone of Brisingamen: A Tale of Alderley is a children&#x27;s fantasy novel by English author Alan Garner. Garner began work on the novel, his literary debut, in 1957, after he moved into the late medieval house, Toad Hall, in Blackden, Cheshire. The story, which took the local legend of The Wizard of the Edge as a partial basis for the novel&#x27;s plot, was influenced by the folklore and landscape of neighbouring Alderley Edge where he had grown up. Upon completion the book was picked up by Sir William Collins who released it through his publishing company Collins in 1960.

The novel, set in and around Macclesfield and Alderley Edge in Cheshire, tells the story of two children, Colin and Susan, who are staying with some old friends of their mother while their parents are overseas. Susan possesses a small tear-shaped jewel held in a bracelet: unknown to her, this is the weirdstone of the title. Its nature is revealed when the children are hunted by the minions of the dark spirit Nastrond who, centuries before, had been defeated and banished by a powerful king. The children also have to compete with the wicked shape-shifting sorceress Selina Place and the evil wizard Grimnir, each of whom wishes to possess the weirdstone. Along the way Colin and Susan are aided by the wizard Cadellin Silverbrow and his dwarf companions.

The novel met with critical praise and led to a sequel, &quot;The Moon of Gomrath&quot;, published in 1963. Growing to dislike the main characters, Garner decided not to write the envisioned third part of the trilogy. For the 1963 reprint Garner also made several changes to the original text and by the late 1960s he came to reject &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot; as &quot;a fairly bad book&quot;. Although it fell out of critical approval it was adapted in the late 1970s as a musical that was staged in Manchester and Essex. In 2010 HarperCollins brought out a special 50th anniversary issue of the book, containing a new preface by Garner and praise from various other figures involved in children&#x27;s literature, while 2011 saw BBC Radio 4 produce a radio adaptation. In August 2012 &quot;Boneland&quot;, the third volume in Garner&#x27;s trilogy, was finally released.

==Plot==

The book&#x27;s introduction concerns the origin of the weirdstone. Following the defeat of Nastrond steps had been taken to prepare for his eventual return. This involved bringing together a small band of warriors of pure heart, each with a horse, and gathering them inside the old dwarf caves of Fundindelve, deep inside the hill of Alderley. The caves were sealed by powerful white magic which would both defend Fundindelve from evil as the ages passed and prevent the warriors and their horses from ageing. When the time was ripe and the world once more in mortal peril it was prophesied that this small band of warriors would ride out from the hill, trusting in their purity of heart to defeat Nastrond forever. Fundindelve had a guardian, the ancient wizard Cadellin Silverbrow, and the heart of the white magic was sealed inside a drop-shaped jewel, the Weirdstone of Brisingamen, also known as Firefrost.

At the beginning of the story, however, the Weirdstone has been lost, stolen centuries before by a farmer whose milk-white mare Cadellin had bought to complete the numbers in Fundindelve. The stone became a family heirloom – now called only &quot;the Tear&quot;- and eventually found its way to Susan&#x27;s mother, who passed it on to Susan, oblivious of its history and purpose. When the children meet Cadellin the wizard fails to notice the bracelet even when the children come to visit him in Fundindelve. However, its presence does not go unnoticed by Selina Place and the witches of the morthbrood, who send their minions to steal it. Susan finally realises the identity of the Weirdstone and, fearing its destruction, sets out to warn the wizard. The children return to Fundindelve but are waylaid by a dark presence and the Tear is taken. Once they inform Cadellin they are told to keep away, to not further involve themselves. However, while exploring on their bikes they notice a mysterious cloud travelling across the landscape before hovering over the home of Selina Place, St Mary&#x27;s Clyffe, and they go to investigate hoping to recover the stone on their own. They are successful but become lost in a labyrinth of mine-shafts and caverns. As the members of the morthbrood and Selina Place, later revealed as The Morrigan, close in on them they are rescued by a pair of dwarves, Fenodyree and Durathror, who are close companions of Cadellin. After passing through many perils the group returns to the farm where Susan and Colin are staying to spend the night, where at midnight The Morrigan menaces them through the door. They set out with the farm&#x27;s owner the next day to return the Weirdstone to Cadellin before it can fall into the wrong hands. Their travels take them through gardens, lawns, fens, tangled rhododendron thickets, pine plantations, mountain peaks and snowy fields while striving to avoid the attention of the morthbrood.

At the climax of the story a great battle takes place on a hill near Alderley during which the children and their companions make a desperate last stand to protect the Weirdstone. However the enemy forces prove too strong and Durathror is mortally wounded. Grimnir takes the Weirdstone for himself and, in the ensuing chaos, Nastrond sends the great wolf Fenrir (in some editions Managarm) to destroy his enemies. As the remaining companions begin to despair, Cadellin appears and slays Grimnir, whom he reveals to be his own brother and who in the final moment accepts defeat and drops the stone into Cadellin&#x27;s hand. The Morrigan flees in terror while Cadellin uses the power of the Weirdstone to subdue once again the forces of darkness.

==Characters==
* Susan – A young girl who inadvertently becomes the guardian of the &quot;weirdstone&quot;; for this reason she is sometimes referred to by the other characters as &quot;Stonemaiden&quot;.
* Colin – Susan&#x27;s twin brother who shares in her adventures (the fact that they are twins is not explicit until &quot;Boneland&quot; was published, although this is hinted at in the passage through the Earldelving, where Colin is described as being &quot;an inch taller than his sister&quot; [p. 141])
* Gowther Mossock – A farmer with whom the children are staying while their parents are away overseas.
* Bess Mossock – Gowther&#x27;s wife; years ago she was nurse to the children&#x27;s mother.

* Fenodyree – A dwarf, ally to Cadellin who watches over the children in his stead.
* Durathror – Prince of the Huldrafolk, and Fenodyree&#x27;s cousin, whose pride lies in his strength in battle.

* Grimnir – An evil magician, and the estranged twin brother of Cadellin Silverbrow, who wishes to keep the Weirdstone for himself; he forms a reluctant alliance with Selina Place to gain the stone from Cadellin.
* Nastrond – The great spirit of darkness who was defeated by the King in Fundindelve, but is ever waiting to return and conquer the mortal world. He is mentioned in the book but never appears firsthand.
* Svart alfar – Goblins, described by Cadellin as &quot;the maggot breed of Ymir&quot;
* Lios alfar – Elves of light, exiled from populated areas, &quot;the scab(s) of tile and brick&quot;

==Background==
===Alan Garner===
Alan Garner was born in the front room of his grandmother&#x27;s house in Congleton, Cheshire, on 17 October 1934. He grew up not far away, on Alderley Edge, a well-to-do rural Cheshire village that by this time had effectively become a suburb of Manchester. Growing up in &quot;a rural working-class family&quot;, Garner&#x27;s ancestry had been connected to Alderley Edge since at least the 16th century, with Alan tracing his lineage back to the death of William Garner in 1592. The Garner family had passed on &quot;a genuine oral tradition&quot;, teaching their children the folk tales about The Edge, which included a description of a king and his army of knights that slept under it, guarded by a wizard, and in the mid 19th century, Alan&#x27;s great-great-grandfather Robert had carved the face of a bearded wizard onto the rock of a cliff next to a well that was known in local folklore as the Wizard&#x27;s Well.

Alan&#x27;s own grandfather, Joseph Garner, &quot;could read, but didn&#x27;t and so was virtually unlettered&quot;, but instead taught his grandson the various folk tales about The Edge, Alan later remarking that, as a result, he was &quot;aware of [the Edge&#x27;s] magic&quot; when as a child he would often play there with his friends. The story of the king and the wizard living under the hill played an important part in the young Alan&#x27;s life, becoming &quot;deeply embedded in my psyche&quot; and influencing his novels, in particular &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot;.

In 1957 Garner purchased Toad Hall, a late mediaeval building in Blackden, seven miles from Alderley Edge. In the late 19th century the Hall had been divided into two agricultural labourers&#x27; cottages, but Garner obtained both for a total of £670, and proceeded to convert them back into a single home. It was at Toad Hall, on the afternoon of Tuesday 4 September 1957, that Garner set about writing his first novel, which would result in &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot;. Whilst engaged in writing in his spare time, Garner attempted to gain employment as a teacher, but soon gave that up, believing that &quot;I couldn&#x27;t write and teach: the energies were too similar&quot;. He began working as a general labourer for four years, remaining unemployed for much of that time.

===Landscape of Cheshire===
Like many of Garner&#x27;s books the novel is set in the real landscape of Cheshire, in this case focused around Alderley Edge, and features fictional characters interacting at genuine sites such as the sandstone escarpment of the Edge, the Wizard&#x27;s Well, the open mine pits, and the Beacon.&quot; Literary critic Neil Philip would later relate that &quot;this sense of a numinous, sacred potency in landscape&quot; was something that imbued all of Garner&#x27;s work.

In a 1968 article Garner explained why he chose to set &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot; in a real landscape rather than in a fictional realm, remarking that &quot;If we are in Eldorado, and we find a mandrake, then OK, so it&#x27;s a mandrake: in Eldorado anything goes. But, by force of imagination, compel the reader to believe that there is a mandrake in a garden in Mayfield Road, Ulverston, Lancs, then when you pull up that mandrake it is really going to scream; and possibly the reader will too.&quot;

*St. Mary&#x27;s Clyffe
*The Edge
**Castle Rock
**Holy Well
**Stormy Point
**Iron Gates
**Druid Stones

===Mythology and folklore===
====Story====
The legend of The Wizard of Alderley Edge revolves around a king and his sleeping knights who rest beneath the hill, waiting for the day when they must awake to save the land. Each knight had a steed, a pure white horse. However, at the time the knights were placed under their enchanted slumber, the wizard whose job it was to guard the king and his knights found that they lacked one horse. One day, he encountered a local farmer taking a pure white mare to sell at the market. The wizard bought the horse, offering the farmer many rich jewels taken from the king&#x27;s secret store of treasure under the Edge in payment.

====Language====
The majority of the non-English words used in &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot; have been adopted from Norse mythology. For instance, the svart-alfar, which means &#x27;black elves&#x27; in Scandinavian, are described as the &quot;maggot-breed of Ymir&quot;, a reference to the primeval giant of Norse myth; while the realm of Ragnarok, which in Garner&#x27;s story is the home of the malevolent spirit Nastrond, is actually named after the Norse end-of-the-world myth. Fimbulwinter, the magically induced winter weather that hinders the children&#x27;s escape, also refers to Norse eschatology.

====Characters====
Other terms are taken not from Norse mythology, but from the Welsh mythology encapsulated in Mediaeval texts like the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. For instance, Govannon, one of the names with which Garner addresses Grimnir, has been adopted from the mythological character of Govannon ap Dun. Although Garner avoided incorporating his story into Arthurian mythology, the benevolent wizard in the novel, Cadellin Silverbrow, does have a link to the Arthurian mythos, in that &quot;Cadellin&quot; is one of the many names by which Culhwch invoked Arthur&#x27;s aid in the Mediaeval Welsh Arthurian romance about &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;.

Other words used in the novel are taken from elsewhere in European mythology and folklore. The name of Fenodyree, a benevolent dwarf in Garner&#x27;s tale, is actually borrowed from Manx folklore, where it refers to a type of grotesque goblin or brownie. Meanwhile, the Morrigan, whom Garner presents as a malevolent shapeshifting witch, has a name adopted from Irish mythology, where she is a war goddess who is the most powerful aspect of the tripartite goddess Badb. Literary critic Neil Philip also argued that further folkloric and mythological influences could be seen in the character of Grimnir, who had both a foul smell from and an aversion to fresh water, characteristics traditionally associated with the Nuckelavee, a creature in Scottish folklore. Accompanying this, Philip opined that Grimnir was also &quot;half identified&quot; with the creature Grendel, the antagonist in the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

==Publication==
Garner sent his debut novel to the publishing company Collins, where it was picked up by the company&#x27;s head, Sir William Collins, who was on the lookout for new fantasy novels following on from the recent commercial and critical success of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1954–55). Garner, who would go on to become a personal friend of Collins, would later relate that &quot;Billy Collins saw a title with funny-looking words in it on the stockpile, and he decided to publish it.&quot; 

Following its release in 1960, &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot; proved to be a &quot;resounding success... both critically and commercially&quot;, later being described as &quot;a tour de force of the imagination, a novel that showed almost every writer who came afterwards what it was possible to achieve in novels ostensibly published for children.&quot; For the book&#x27;s republication in 1963, Garner made several alterations to the text, excising what Neil Philip called &quot;extraneous clauses, needless adjectives and flabby phrases.&quot; In his opinion, this &quot;second text is taut where the first one is slack, precise where the first is woolly.&quot; Nonetheless, as the novel was republished by the US market by Puffin Books as an Armada Lion paperback in 1971, the 1960 text was once more used.

===50th anniversary reprint===

In the fiftieth anniversary edition of &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot;, published by HarperCollins in 2010, several notable British fantasy novelists praised Garner and his work. Susan Cooper related that &quot;The power and range of Alan Garner&#x27;s astounding talent has grown with every book he&#x27;s written&quot;, whilst David Almond called him one of Britain&#x27;s &quot;greatest writers&quot; whose works &quot;really matter&quot;. Philip Pullman, the author of the &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy, went further when he remarked that:

Garner is indisputably the great originator, the most important British writer of fantasy since Tolkien, and in many respects better than Tolkien, because deeper and more truthful ... Any country except Britain would have long ago recognised his importance, and celebrated it with postage stamps and statues and street-names. But that&#x27;s the way with us: our greatest prophets go unnoticed by the politicians and the owners of media empires. I salute him with the most heartfelt respect and admiration.

Another British fantasy author, Neil Gaiman, said &quot;Garner&#x27;s fiction is something special&quot; in that it was &quot;smart and challenging, based in the here and the now, in which real English places emerged from the shadows of folklore, and in which people found themselves walking, living and battling their way through the dreams and patterns of myth.&quot; Praise also came from Nick Lake, the editorial director of HarperCollins Children&#x27;s Books, who proclaimed that &quot;Garner is, quite simply, one of the greatest and most influential writers this country has ever produced.&quot;

==Reception==
In 1970 &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot; was given the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award by the University of Wisconsin–Madison School of Education.

===The author===

Upon publication it was a critical success, but later Garner had begun to find fault, referring to it in a 1968 interview as &quot;a fairly bad book&quot; and in 1970 as &quot;one of the worst books published in the last twenty years... technically... inept&quot;.

===Literary critics===

Literary critic Neil Philip devoted a chapter to both &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot; and &quot;The Moon of Gomrath&quot; in his book &quot;A Fine Anger: A Critical Introduction to the Work of Alan Garner&quot; (1981). He noted that it had become &quot;fashionable to condemn Garner&#x27;s early work, perhaps because of his own dismissive attitude to it.&quot; He argued that the two books &quot;may be flawed&quot;, but that &quot;they are arguably Garner&#x27;s most popular books; certainly it is on them that his reputation as a purely children&#x27;s author rests.&quot; Philip argued that &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot; suffers from a &quot;lack of characterisation&quot;; its &quot;most serious flaw&quot;. Yet he also felt that the book had much to commend it, with a narrative that while &quot;unstructured&quot;, was &quot;gripping and enthralling&quot;, holding the reader&#x27;s attention and keeping them &quot;guessing what is going to happen next.&quot; He commented on &quot;Garner&#x27;s assured, poetic command of English&quot;, with a writing style that is &quot;more fleshy, more prolix than the pared-down economy of Garner&#x27;s later style&quot;.

In the 2005 book &quot;Horror: Another 100 Best Books&quot;, edited by Stephen Jones and Kim Newman, Muriel Gray&#x27;s article for &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot; described it with expressions such as &quot;truly gripping,&quot; &quot;beautifully crafted&quot; and &quot;a young person&#x27;s introduction to horror.&quot;

===Other fantasy writers===

The book has received high praise from numerous other fantasy writers. Young adult fantasy writer Garth Nix indicated its impact on his own writing, saying &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen is one of the most important books in children’s fantasy. It has been an enormous inspiration to me and countless other writers, and is as enjoyable and fascinating now as it was when I first read it, wide-eyed and mesmerised at the age of ten.&quot;

Philip Pullman also gave it high praise, stating &quot;Alan Garner is indisputably the great originator, the most important British writer of fantasy since Tolkien.&quot; Neil Gaiman has observed that &quot;Alan Garner’s fiction is something special. Garner’s fantasies were smart and challenging, based in the here and now, in which real English places emerged from the shadow of folklore, and in which people found themselves walking, living and battling their way through the dreams and patterns of myth.&quot;

==Adaptations==
===1963 radio drama===

A six-part radio adaptation by Nan MacDonald was broadcast on the BBC Home Service in 1963. The cast included John Thornley as Colin, Margaret Dew as Susan, Alison Bayley as Selina Place, Geoffrey Banks as Cadellin the Wizard, Brian Trueman as Fenodyree, John Blain as Police Sergeant, Ronald Harvi as Durathror, and George Hagan as Narrator.

===1989 radio drama===

The novel was dramatised in four parts by David Wade, and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1989. The production was directed at BBC Manchester by Caroline Smith. It starred Robin Bailey as Cadellin, James Tomlinson as Gowther Mossock/Narrator, Andrea Murphy as Susan, Mark Kingston as Colin, Rosalind Knight as Selina Place, Patsy Byrne as Bess, George Parsons as Guard/Ticket collector, Richard Herdman as Farmer/Porter, and Anne Jameson as the Crow.

===2011 radio drama===

In the 2011 BBC Radio 4 adaptation Robert Powell played the narrator; he has known Garner since he was a schoolboy at Manchester Grammar School. Struan Rodger, who played the dwarf Durathror, was in a radio production of another Garner story, &quot;Elidor&quot;, when he was thirteen years old. This adaptation was broadcast again in November 2012.

===Musical===

In the 1970s, &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot; was adapted as a musical by Paul Pearson and was staged in 1983 in Manchester and later in Essex. The original Manchester cast included artist Sue Mason, who also designed the programme book. The songs from the show were later re-arranged by Inkubus Sukkubus with hopes of resurrecting the musical for a modern audience, but copyright restrictions have made it unlikely that it will be presented again.

<text>In Norse mythology, Náströnd (&quot;Corpse Shore&quot;) is a place in Hel where Níðhöggr devours the dead souls of the dishonorable. It is the afterlife for those guilty of murder, and severe oath-breaking.

==Orthography==
In the standardized Old Norse orthography, the name was spelled &quot;Nástrǫnd&quot;, which in 11th century Old West Norse was pronounced . In Modern Icelandic the letter &#x27;ǫ&#x27; is replaced by ö, and Náströnd is pronounced .

<text>The chancellor of the exchequer, often abbreviated to chancellor, is a senior minister of the Crown within the Government of the United Kingdom, and the head of His Majesty’s Treasury. As one of the four Great Offices of State, the chancellor is a high-ranking member of the British Cabinet.

Responsible for all economic and financial matters, the role is equivalent to that of a finance minister in other countries. The chancellor is now always second lord of the Treasury as one of at least six lords commissioners of the Treasury, responsible for executing the office of the Treasurer of the Exchequer the others are the prime minister and Commons government whips. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, it was common for the prime minister also to serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer if he sat in the Commons; the last Chancellor who was simultaneously prime minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer was Stanley Baldwin in 1923. Formerly, in cases when the chancellorship was vacant, the lord chief justice of the King&#x27;s Bench would act as chancellor &quot;pro tempore&quot;. The last lord chief justice to serve in this way was Lord Denman in 1834.

The chancellor is the third-oldest major state office in English and British history, and in recent times has come to be the most powerful office in British politics after the prime minister. It originally carried responsibility for the Exchequer, the medieval English institution for the collection and auditing of royal revenues. The earliest surviving records which are the results of the exchequer&#x27;s audit date from 1129 to 1130 under King Henry I and show continuity from previous years. The chancellor has oversight of fiscal policy, therefore of taxation and public spending across government departments. It previously controlled monetary policy as well until 1997, when the Bank of England was granted independent control of its interest rates.

Since 1718, all chancellors of the exchequer, except at times the lord chief justice as interim holders, have been members of the House of Commons, with Lord Stanhope being the last chancellor from the House of Lords.

The office holder works alongside the other Treasury ministers and the permanent secretary to the Treasury. The corresponding shadow minister is the shadow chancellor of the Exchequer, and the chancellor is also scrutinised by the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson and the Treasury Select Committee.

The current chancellor is Rachel Reeves.

== Second Lord of the Treasury ==
The holder of the office of chancellor of the exchequer is &quot;ex officio&quot; second lord of the Treasury as a member of the commission exercising the ancient office of treasurer of the exchequer. As second lord, her official residence is 11 Downing Street in London, next door to the residence of the first lord of the Treasury (a title that has for many years been held by the prime minister), who resides in 10 Downing Street. While in the past both houses were private residences, today they serve as interlinked offices, with the occupant living in an apartment made from attic rooms previously resided in by servants.

Since 1827, the chancellor has always simultaneously held the office of second lord of the Treasury when that person has not also been the prime minister.

==Roles and responsibilities==
A previous chancellor, Robert Lowe, described the office in the following terms in the House of Commons, on 11 April 1870: &quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer is a man whose duties make him more or less of a taxing machine. He is entrusted with a certain amount of misery which it is his duty to distribute as fairly as he can.&quot;

===Fiscal policy===
The chancellor has considerable control over other departments as it is the Treasury that sets Departmental Expenditure Limits. The amount of power this gives to an individual chancellor depends on their personal forcefulness, their status within their party and their relationship with the prime minister. Gordon Brown, who became chancellor when Labour came into Government in 1997, had a large personal power base in the party. Perhaps as a result, Tony Blair chose to keep him in the same position throughout his ten years as prime minister; making Brown an unusually dominant figure and the longest-serving chancellor since the Reform Act 1832. This has strengthened a pre-existing trend towards the chancellor occupying a clear second position among government ministers, elevated above their traditional peers, the foreign secretary and home secretary.

One part of the chancellor&#x27;s key roles involves the framing of the annual year budget. As of 2017, the first is the Autumn Budget, also known as Budget Day which forecasts government spending in the next financial year and also announces new financial measures. The second is a Spring Statement, also known as a &quot;mini-Budget&quot;. Britain&#x27;s tax year has retained the old Julian end of year: 24 March (Old Style) / 5 April (New Style, i.e. Gregorian). From 1993, the Budget was in spring, preceded by an annual autumn statement. This was then called Pre-Budget Report. The Autumn Statement usually took place in November or December. The 1997, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2012 and 2016 budgets were all delivered on a Wednesday, summarised in a speech to the House of Commons.

The budget is a state secret until the chancellor reveals it in the speech given to Parliament. Hugh Dalton, on his way to giving the budget speech in 1947, inadvertently blurted out key details to a newspaper reporter, and they appeared in print before he made his speech. Dalton was forced to resign.

===Monetary policy===
Although the Bank of England is responsible for setting interest rates, the chancellor also plays an important part in the monetary policy structure. They set the inflation target which the Bank must set interest rates to meet. Under the Bank of England Act 1998 the chancellor has the power of appointment of four out of nine members of the Bank&#x27;s Monetary Policy Committee – the so-called &#x27;external&#x27; members. They also have a high level of influence over the appointment of the Bank&#x27;s Governor and Deputy Governors, and has the right of consultation over the appointment of the two remaining MPC members from within the Bank. The Act also provides that the Government has the power to give instructions to the Bank on interest rates for a limited period in extreme circumstances. This power has never been officially used.

===Ministerial arrangements===
At HM Treasury the chancellor is supported by a political team of four junior ministers and by permanent civil servants. The most important junior minister is the chief secretary to the Treasury, a member of the Cabinet, to whom the negotiations with other government departments on the details of government spending are delegated, followed by the paymaster general, the financial secretary to the Treasury and the economic secretary to the Treasury. Whilst not continuously in use, there can also be appointed a commercial secretary to the Treasury and an exchequer secretary to the Treasury. Two other officials are given the title of a secretary to the Treasury, although neither is a government minister in the Treasury: the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury is the Government Chief Whip in the House of Commons; the permanent secretary to the Treasury is not a minister but the senior civil servant in the Treasury.

The chancellor is obliged to be a member of the Privy Council, and thus is styled the Right Honourable (Rt. Hon.). Because the House of Lords is excluded from financial matters by tradition confirmed by the Parliament Acts, the office is effectively limited to members of the House of Commons; apart from the occasions when the lord chief justice of the King&#x27;s Bench has acted as interim Chancellor. The last peer to hold the office was Henry Booth, 2nd Baron Delamer (created Earl of Warrington shortly after leaving office) from 9 April 1689 to 18 March 1690. The chancellor holds the formerly independent office of Master of the Mint as a subsidiary office.

==Perquisites of the office==

===Official residence===
The chancellor of the Exchequer has no official London residence as such but since 1828 in their role as Second Lord of the Treasury they live in the second lord&#x27;s official residence, No. 11 Downing Street. In 1997, the then first and second Lords, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown respectively, swapped apartments, as the chancellor&#x27;s larger apartment in No. 11 better accommodated Blair&#x27;s substantial family (besides himself and his wife, he had three children under 18 upon taking office, and a fourth was born in 2000); meanwhile, Brown was then unmarried and had no children.

===Dorneywood===
Dorneywood is the summer residence that is traditionally made available to the chancellor, though it is the prime minister who ultimately decides who may use it. Gordon Brown, on becoming chancellor in 1997, refused to use it and the house, which is set in of parkland, was allocated to Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. In 2007, it reverted to the then-chancellor, Alistair Darling.

===Budget box===

The chancellor traditionally carries his or her budget speech to the House of Commons in a particular red despatch box. The so-called ‘Budget Box’ is identical to the cases used by all other government ministers (known as ministerial boxes or &quot;despatch boxes&quot;) to transport their official papers, but is better known because the chancellor traditionally displays the box, containing the budget speech, to the press before leaving 11 Downing Street for the House of Commons.

The original budget box was first used by William Ewart Gladstone in 1853 and continued in use until 1965 when James Callaghan was the first chancellor to break with tradition when he used a newer box. Prior to Gladstone, a generic red despatch box of varying design and specification was used. The practice is said to have begun in the late 16th century, when Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s representative Francis Throckmorton presented the Spanish Ambassador, Bernardino de Mendoza, with a specially constructed red briefcase filled with black puddings.

In July 1997, Gordon Brown became the second chancellor to use a new box for the Budget. Made by industrial trainees at Babcock Rosyth Defence Ltd ship and submarine dockyard in Fife, the new box is made of yellow pine, with a brass handle and lock, covered in scarlet leather and embossed with the Royal cypher and crest and the chancellor&#x27;s title. In his first Budget, in March 2008, Alistair Darling reverted to using the original budget box and his successor, George Osborne, continued this tradition for his first budget, before announcing that it would be retired due to its fragile condition. The key to the original budget box has been lost.

===Budget tipple===
By tradition, the chancellor has been allowed to drink whatever they wish while making the annual budget speech to Parliament. This includes alcohol, which is otherwise banned under parliamentary rules.

Previous chancellors have opted for whisky (Kenneth Clarke), gin and tonic (Geoffrey Howe), brandy and water (Benjamin Disraeli and John Major), spritzer (Nigel Lawson) and sherry and beaten egg (William Gladstone).

The chancellors after Clarke, Philip Hammond, George Osborne, Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown, opted for water. In fact Darling drank what was named &quot;Standard Water&quot; in reference to, and support of, the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; newspaper&#x27;s campaign to have plain tap water available in restaurants at no charge to customers.

===Robe of office===
The chancellor, as Master of the Mint, has a robe of office, similar to that of the lord chancellor (as seen in several of the portraits depicted below). In recent times, it has only regularly been worn at coronations, but some chancellors (at least until the 1990s) have also worn it when attending the Trial of the Pyx as Master of the Mint. According to George Osborne, the robe (dating from Gladstone&#x27;s time in office, and worn by the likes of Lloyd George and Churchill) &#x27;went missing&#x27; during Gordon Brown&#x27;s time as chancellor.

<text>Hel (Old Norse: ) is an afterlife location in Norse mythology and paganism. It is ruled over by a being of the same name, Hel. In late Icelandic sources, varying descriptions of Hel are given and various figures are described as being buried with items that will facilitate their journey to Hel after their death . In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, Brynhildr&#x27;s trip to Hel after her death is described and Odin, while alive, also visits Hel upon his horse Sleipnir. In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Baldr goes to Hel on his death and subsequently Hermóðr uses Sleipnir to attempt to retrieve him.

==Etymology==
The Old Norse feminine proper noun &quot;Hel&quot; is identical to the name of the entity that presides over the realm, Old Norse &quot;Hel&quot;. The word has cognates in all branches of the Germanic languages, including Old English (and thus Modern English &quot;hell&quot;), Old Frisian &quot;helle&quot;, Old Saxon &quot;hellia&quot;, Old High German &quot;&quot;, and Gothic &quot;𐌷𐌰𐌻𐌾𐌰&quot;. All forms ultimately derive from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic feminine noun *&quot;haljō&quot; (&#x27;concealed place, the underworld&#x27;). In turn, the Proto-Germanic form derives from the o-grade form of the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;kel-&quot;, *&quot;kol&quot;-: &#x27;to cover, conceal, save&#x27;.

The term is etymologically related to Modern English &quot;hall&quot; and therefore also &quot;Valhalla&quot;, an afterlife &#x27;hall of the slain&#x27; in Norse Mythology. &quot;Hall&quot; and its numerous Germanic cognates derive from Proto-Germanic *&quot;hallō&quot; &#x27;covered place, hall&#x27;, from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;kol-&quot;.

Related early Germanic terms and concepts include Proto-Germanic *&quot;halja-rūnō(n)&quot;, a feminine compound noun, and *&quot;halja-wītjan&quot;, a neutral compound noun. This form is reconstructed from the Latinized Gothic plural noun *&quot;haliurunnae&quot; (attested by Jordanes; according to philologist Vladimir Orel, meaning &#x27;witches&#x27;), Old English &#x27; (&#x27;sorceress, necromancer&#x27;, according to Orel), and Old High German &#x27; &#x27;magic&#x27;. The compound is composed of two elements: *&quot;haljō&quot; and *&quot;rūnō&quot;, the Proto-Germanic precursor to Modern English &quot;rune&quot;. The second element in the Gothic &quot;&quot; may however instead be an agent noun from the verb &quot;rinnan&quot; (&quot;to run, go&quot;), which would make its literal meaning &quot;one who travels to the netherworld&quot;.

Proto-Germanic *&quot;halja-wītjan&quot; is reconstructed from Old Norse &#x27; &#x27;hell&#x27;, Old English &#x27; &#x27;hell-torment, hell&#x27;, Old Saxon &quot;helli-wīti&quot; &#x27;hell&#x27;, and the Middle High German feminine noun &#x27;. The compound is a compound of *&quot;haljō&quot; (discussed above) and *&quot;wītjan&quot; (reconstructed from forms such as Old English &#x27; &#x27;right mind, wits&#x27;, Old Saxon &quot;gewit&quot; &#x27;understanding&#x27;, and Gothic &quot;&quot; &#x27;foolishness, understanding&#x27;).

==Attestations==
===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
In reference to Hel, in the poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, a völva states that Hel will play an important role in Ragnarök. The völva states that a crowing &quot;sooty-red cock from the halls of Hel&quot; is one of three cocks that will signal one of the beginning events of Ragnarök. The other two are Fjalar in Jotunheim and Gullinkambi in Valhalla.

In &quot;Grímnismál&quot; stanza 31, Hel is listed as existing beneath one of the three roots of the world tree Yggdrasil. One of the other two leads to the frost jötnar and the third to Mankind. In &quot;Guðrúnarkviða I&quot;, as Herborg tells of her grief in having prepared funeral arrangements for various members of her family, her children and her husbands, described it as &quot;arranging their journey to Hel&quot;.

In the short poem &quot;Helreið Brynhildar&quot;, Hel is directly referenced as a location in the title, translating to &quot;Brynhild&#x27;s Hel-Ride&quot;. While riding along a road on the border of Hel in a lavish cart (the cart her corpse was burnt within), Brynhildr encounters a dead gýgr at a burial mound belonging to her. This results in a heated exchange, during which Brynhildr tells of her life.

In &quot;Baldrs draumar&quot;, Odin rides to the edge of Hel to investigate nightmares that Baldr has had. He uses a spell to bring to life the corpse of a völva. Odin introduces himself under a false name and pretense and asks for information from the völva relating to Baldr&#x27;s dreams. The völva reluctantly proceeds to produce prophecies regarding the events of Ragnarök.

The poem gives some information regarding the geographic location of Hel in parallel to the description in the Prose Edda, which may be related to the fact that it was not included in the Codex Regius but is instead a later addition. Niflhel is mentioned as being just outside Hel. The bloody Garmr makes an appearance, encountering Odin on Odin&#x27;s ride to Hel. Odin continues down the road and approaches Hel, which is described as the &quot;high hall of Hel.&quot; There he proceeds to the grave of the völva near the eastern doors where the descriptions of Hel end.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, more detailed information is given about the location, including a detailed account of a venture to the region after the death of the god Baldr. Snorri&#x27;s descriptions of Hel in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; are not corroborated outside &quot;Baldrs draumar&quot;, which does not appear in the original Codex Regius but is a later addition often included with modern editions of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;.

====&quot;Gylfaginning&quot;====
In the book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Hel is introduced in chapter 3 as a location where &quot;evil men&quot; go upon death, and into Niflhel. The chapter further details that Hel is in the ninth of the Nine Worlds.

In chapter 34, Hel, the being is introduced. Snorri writes that Hel was cast down into Hel by Odin who &quot;made her ruler over Nine Worlds&quot;. Snorri further writes that there Hel is located in Niflheim. Here it is related that she could give out lodging and items to those sent to her that have died of disease or old age. A very large dwelling is described as existing in Niflheim owned by Hel with huge walls and gates. The within of this place is called Éljúðnir, where Hel is described as having a servant, a slave and various possessions.

At the end of chapter 49, the death of Baldr and Nanna is described. Hermóðr, described as Baldr&#x27;s brother in this source, sets out for Hel on horseback to retrieve the deceased Baldr. To enter Hel, Hermóðr rides for nine nights through &quot;valleys so deep and dark that he saw nothing&quot; until he arrives at the river Gjöll (&quot;Noisy&quot;) and the Gjöll bridge. The bridge is described as having a roof made of shining gold. Hermóðr then proceeds to cross it. Hermóðr encounters Móðguð, who is the guard of the bridge (&quot;Furious Battler&quot;).

Móðguð speaks to Hermóðr and comments that the bridge echoes beneath him more than the entire party of five people who had just passed. This is a reference to Baldr, Nanna and those that were burnt in their funeral pyre passing over the bridge on death. Móðguð also says that the dead in Hel appear as a different color than the living and tells him that to get to Hel he must go &quot;down and to the North&quot; where he would find the Road to Hel.

Continuing along the Road to Hel, Hermóðr encounters the Gates of Hel. Hermóðr remounts and spurs Sleipnir, and the two bound far over it. Hermóðr proceeds further beyond the gates for some distance before arriving at the hall, dismounting and entering. There Hermóðr sees Baldr sitting in a &quot;seat of honor&quot; and Hermóðr spends a night in Hel. The following day, Hermóðr presses Hel, the being, to allow Baldr to leave. Hel gives him an offer and then Baldr leads him out of the hall. Baldr then gives Hermóðr various gifts from Nanna and himself to bring from Hel to the living Æsir. Hermóðr then retraces his path back to the land of the living. Hel&#x27;s offer fails and in chapter 50, Loki is blamed for Baldr remaining in Hel.

In chapter 53, Hel is mentioned a final time in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. Here, Höðr and Baldr are mentioned as returning from Hel in a post-Ragnarök world:

===&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;===
Book I of &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; contains an account of what has often been interpreted as a trip to Hel. While having dinner, King Hadingus is visited by a woman bearing stalks of hemlock who asks him if he knows where such fresh herbs grow in winter. Hadingus wants to know; so the woman muffles him with her cloak, pulls him into the ground, and they vanish. Saxo reasons that the gods wished for Hadingus to visit in the flesh where he will go when he dies.

The two penetrate a dark and misty cloud, and then continue along a path worn from heavy use over the ages. The two see men wearing rich-looking robes, and nobles wearing purple. Passing them, they finally reach sunny regions where the herbs the woman presented Hadingus grow.

Hadingus and the woman continue until they arrived at a river of blue-black water that is fast-moving, full of rapids, and filled with various weapons. They cross the bridge, and see two &quot;strongly-matched&quot; armies meeting. Hadingus asks the woman about their identity, and she responds that they are men that have met their death by sword, and that they present an everlasting display of their destruction while attempting to equal the activity of their past lives.

Moving forward, the two encounter a wall that they cannot find a way over. The woman attempts to leap over it, but despite her slender and wrinkled body, cannot. The woman removes the head of a cock that she was carrying and throws it over the wall. The bird crows immediately; it has returned to life. Hadingus returns to his wife, and foils a threat by pirates.

==Theories==
Hilda Ellis Davidson, writing on Snorri&#x27;s unique description of Hel in his Prose Edda, states that &quot;it seems likely that Snorri&#x27;s account of the underworld is chiefly his own work&quot; and that the idea that the dead entering Hel who have died of sickness and old age may have been an attempt on Snorri&#x27;s part to reconcile the tradition with his description of Valhalla, citing that &quot;the one detailed account of Hel&quot; that Snorri gives is that of Baldr entering Hel without dying of old age or sickness. Davidson writes that Snorri was potentially using a &quot;rich source&quot; unknown to us for his description of Hel, though it may not have told him very much about the location beyond that it was a hall and that Snorri&#x27;s description of Hel may at times be influenced by Christian teachings about the after-life.

<text>August Bournonville (21 August 1805 – 30 November 1879) was a Danish ballet master and choreographer. He was the son of Antoine Bournonville, a dancer and choreographer trained under the French choreographer, Jean Georges Noverre, and the nephew of Julie Alix de la Fay, née Bournonville, of the Royal Swedish Ballet.

Bournonville was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, where his father had settled. He trained with his father Antoine Bournonville as well he studied under the Italian choreographer Vincenzo Galeotti at the Royal Danish Ballet, Copenhagen, and in Paris, France, under French dancer Auguste Vestris. He initiated a unique style in ballet known as the Bournonville School.

Following studies in Paris as a young man, Bournonville became solo dancer at the Royal Ballet in Copenhagen. From 1830 to 1848 he was choreographer for the Royal Danish Ballet, for which he created more than 50 ballets admired for their exuberance, lightness and beauty. He created a style which, although influenced from the Paris ballet, is entirely his own. As a choreographer, he created a number of ballets with varied settings that range from Denmark to Italy, Russia to South America. A limited number of these works have survived.

Bournonville&#x27;s work became known outside Denmark only after World War II. Since 1950, The Royal Ballet has several times made prolonged tours abroad, not the least to the United States, where they have performed his ballets.

Bournonville&#x27;s best-known ballets are &quot;La Sylphide&quot; (1836), &quot;Napoli&quot; (1842), &quot;Le Conservatoire&quot; (1849), &quot;The Kermesse in Bruges&quot; (1851) and &quot;A Folk Tale&quot; (1854). Later major ballets include Valkyrien, Thrymskviden, Arcona and Fjedstuen.

==Early years==
Born in Copenhagen on 21 August 1805, Bournonville was the son of the French ballet master Antoine Bournonville, who had settled in Denmark, and Lovisa Sundberg, a Swede. At the age of eight, he entered the Royal Ballet School at the Court Theatre in Christiansborg Palace under the tutelage of his father and Vincenzo Galeotti, ballet master and principal choreographer of the Royal Danish Ballet from 1775 to 1816.

On 2 October 1813, Bournonville made his first stage appearance in a small part as the son of a Viking king in Galeotti&#x27;s &quot;Lagertha&quot;, the first ballet on a Nordic theme. Less than a year later, he received his first personal applause for dancing a Hungarian solo at the Court Theatre. In addition to dance, Bournonville was a voracious reader, learned French at home, played the violin, sang in a boy soprano voice, and studied declamation with the actors Michael Rosing, Lindgreen, and Frydensdahl. His many talents were brought together on the Queen&#x27;s birthday, 29 October 1817, when as a twelve-year-old he played the role of Adonia to royal acclaim in a music-drama, &quot;Solomon&#x27;s Judgment&quot; and sang a romance, &quot;The Mother with Her Drooping Wings&quot;.

==Family==

Bournonville had five siblings. He was the only one in out of the children who showed any interest in dancing. He married Helena Fredrika Håkansson on 23 June 1830. They had seven children, including Charlotte who became an opera singer and actress. Both sons died as toddlers.

==Paris==

In 1820, Antoine Bournonville received a grant from his sovereign, Frederick VI, to briefly study ballet in Paris. Bournonville accompanied his father to Paris, and, although he studied solely with his father during the Paris sojourn, he was exposed to the latest trends in ballet and watched the illustrious teachers, Gardel and Vestris in action. Upon returning to Denmark, Bournonville became a member of the Royal Theatre, dancing in repertory that was less interesting to him after his exposure to Paris ballet.

In the spring of 1824, Bournonville returned to Paris for final studies and examination preparations at the Paris Opera. The expected fifteen-month sojourn would stretch to five years, during which time Danish ballet would approach near-disastrous decline. In Paris, Bournonville met his father&#x27;s old friend, Louis Nivelon, who provided him with friendship, meals, and entree into society. Bournonville hoped the master Gardel would accept him but Gardel&#x27;s studio was no longer in existence and he was directed to Auguste Vestris for training in his weakest areas — &quot;balance, pirouettes, and arms.&quot; Vestris accepted Bournonville. Bournonville wrote his father: 

Bournonville danced from 1820 to 1828 with the noted dancer Marie Taglioni and the Paris Opera Ballet.

==Death==

Bournonville stopped teaching adult classes in the spring of 1877. On returning from church on 30 November 1879, he was stricken and taken to a hospital. Bournonville was interred in Asminderød Churchyard near Fredensborg.

==Legacy==

Bournonville&#x27;s work remains an important link with earlier traditions. He resisted many of the excesses of the romantic era ballets in his work. He is noted for his egalitarian choreography, which gave equal emphasis to both male and female roles, at a time when European ballet emphasized the ballerina. Many of his contemporaries explored the extremes of human emotion, while Bournonville, using enthusiastic footwork and fluid phrases in his work, portrayed a more balanced human nature.

<doc id="70085" wikidata="Q47285" url="?curid=70085" title="J. J. Thomson">
<text>Sir Joseph John Thomson (18 December 1856 – 30 August 1940) was an English physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906 &quot;in recognition of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases.&quot;

In 1897, Thomson showed that cathode rays were composed of previously unknown negatively charged particles (now called electrons), which he calculated must have bodies much smaller than atoms and a very large charge-to-mass ratio. Thomson is also credited with finding the first evidence for isotopes of a stable (non-radioactive) element in 1913, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays (positive ions). His experiments to determine the nature of positively charged particles, with Francis William Aston, were the first use of mass spectrometry and led to the development of the mass spectrograph.

Thomson was awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the conduction of electricity in gases. Thomson was also a teacher, and seven of his students went on to win Nobel Prizes: Ernest Rutherford (Chemistry 1908), Lawrence Bragg (Physics 1915), Charles Barkla (Physics 1917), Francis Aston (Chemistry 1922), Charles Thomson Rees Wilson (Physics 1927), Owen Richardson (Physics 1928) and Edward Victor Appleton (Physics 1947). Only Arnold Sommerfeld&#x27;s record of mentorship offers a comparable list of high-achieving students.

==Education and personal life==
Joseph John Thomson was born on 18 December 1856 in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, Lancashire, England. His mother, Emma Swindells, came from a local textile family. His father, Joseph James Thomson, ran an antiquarian bookshop founded by Thomson&#x27;s great-grandfather. He had a brother, Frederick Vernon Thomson, who was two years younger than he was. J. J. Thomson was a reserved yet devout Anglican.

His early education was in small private schools where he demonstrated outstanding talent and interest in science. In 1870, he was admitted to Owens College in Manchester (now University of Manchester) at the unusually young age of 14 and came under the influence of Balfour Stewart, Professor of Physics, who initiated Thomson into physical research. Thomson began experimenting with contact electrification and soon published his first scientific paper. His parents planned to enroll him as an apprentice engineer to Sharp, Stewart &amp; Co, a locomotive manufacturer, but these plans were cut short when his father died in 1873.

He moved on to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1876. In 1880, he obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics (Second Wrangler in the Tripos and 2nd Smith&#x27;s Prize). He applied for and became a fellow of Trinity College in 1881. He received his Master of Arts degree (with Adams Prize) in 1883.

==Family==
In 1890, Thomson married Rose Elisabeth Paget at the church of St. Mary the Less. Rose, who was the daughter of Sir George Edward Paget, a physician and then Regius Professor of Physic at Cambridge, was interested in physics. Beginning in 1882, women could attend demonstrations and lectures at the University of Cambridge. Rose attended demonstrations and lectures, among them Thomson&#x27;s, leading to their relationship.

They had two children: George Paget Thomson, who was also awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on the wave properties of the electron, and Joan Paget Thomson (later Charnock), who became an author, writing children&#x27;s books, non-fiction and biographies.

==Career and research==
===Overview===
On 22 December 1884, Thomson was appointed Cavendish Professor of Physics at the University of Cambridge. The appointment caused considerable surprise, given that candidates such as Osborne Reynolds or Richard Glazebrook were older and more experienced in laboratory work. Thomson was known for his work as a mathematician, where he was recognised as an exceptional talent.

He was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1906, &quot;in recognition of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases.&quot; He was knighted in 1908 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1912. In 1914, he gave the Romanes Lecture in Oxford on &quot;The atomic theory&quot;. In 1918, he became Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he remained until his death. He died on 30 August 1940; his ashes rest in Westminster Abbey, near the graves of Sir Isaac Newton and his former student Ernest Rutherford.

Rutherford succeeded him as Cavendish Professor of Physics. Six of Thomson&#x27;s research assistants and junior colleagues (Charles Glover Barkla, Niels Bohr, Max Born, William Henry Bragg, Owen Willans Richardson and Charles Thomson Rees Wilson) won Nobel Prizes in physics, and two (Francis William Aston and Ernest Rutherford) won Nobel prizes in chemistry. Thomson&#x27;s son (George Paget Thomson) also won the 1937 Nobel Prize in physics for proving the wave-like properties of electrons.

Thomson&#x27;s prize-winning master&#x27;s work, &quot;Treatise on the motion of vortex rings&quot;, shows his early interest in atomic structure. In it, Thomson mathematically described the motions of William Thomson&#x27;s vortex theory of atoms.
Thomson published a number of papers addressing both mathematical and experimental issues of electromagnetism. He examined the electromagnetic theory of light of James Clerk Maxwell, introduced the concept of electromagnetic mass of a charged particle, and demonstrated that a moving charged body would apparently increase in mass.

Much of his work in mathematical modelling of chemical processes can be thought of as early computational chemistry. In further work, published in book form as &quot;Applications of dynamics to physics and chemistry&quot; (1888), Thomson addressed the transformation of energy in mathematical and theoretical terms, suggesting that all energy might be kinetic. His next book, &quot;Notes on recent researches in electricity and magnetism&quot; (1893), built upon Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;Treatise upon electricity and magnetism&quot;, and was sometimes referred to as &quot;the third volume of Maxwell&quot;. In it, Thomson emphasized physical methods and experimentation and included extensive figures and diagrams of apparatus, including a number for the passage of electricity through gases. His third book, &quot;Elements of the mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism&quot; (1895) was a readable introduction to a wide variety of subjects, and achieved considerable popularity as a textbook.

A series of four lectures, given by Thomson on a visit to Princeton University in 1896, were subsequently published as &quot;Discharge of electricity through gases&quot; (1897). Thomson also presented a series of six lectures at Yale University in 1904.

===Discovery of the electron===
Several scientists, such as William Prout and Norman Lockyer, had suggested that atoms were built up from a more fundamental unit, but they envisioned this unit to be the size of the smallest atom, hydrogen. Thomson in 1897 was the first to suggest that one of the fundamental units of the atom was more than 1,000 times smaller than an atom, suggesting the subatomic particle now known as the electron. Thomson discovered this through his explorations on the properties of cathode rays. Thomson made his suggestion on 30 April 1897 following his discovery that cathode rays (at the time known as Lenard rays) could travel much further through air than expected for an atom-sized particle. He estimated the mass of cathode rays by measuring the heat generated when the rays hit a thermal junction and comparing this with the magnetic deflection of the rays. His experiments suggested not only that cathode rays were over 1,000 times lighter than the hydrogen atom, but also that their mass was the same in whichever type of atom they came from. He concluded that the rays were composed of very light, negatively charged particles which were a universal building block of atoms. He called the particles &quot;corpuscles&quot;, but later scientists preferred the name electron which had been suggested by George Johnstone Stoney in 1891, prior to Thomson&#x27;s actual discovery.

In April 1897, Thomson had only early indications that the cathode rays could be deflected electrically (previous investigators such as Heinrich Hertz had thought they could not be). A month after Thomson&#x27;s announcement of the corpuscle, he found that he could reliably deflect the rays by an electric field if he evacuated the discharge tube to a very low pressure. By comparing the deflection of a beam of cathode rays by electric and magnetic fields he obtained more robust measurements of the mass-to-charge ratio that confirmed his previous estimates. This became the classic means of measuring the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron. Later in 1899 he measured the charge of the electron to be of .

Thomson believed that the corpuscles emerged from the atoms of the trace gas inside his cathode-ray tubes. He thus concluded that atoms were divisible, and that the corpuscles were their building blocks. In 1904, Thomson suggested a model of the atom, hypothesizing that it was a sphere of positive matter within which electrostatic forces determined the positioning of the corpuscles. To explain the overall neutral charge of the atom, he proposed that the corpuscles were distributed in a uniform sea of positive charge. In this &quot;plum pudding model&quot;, the electrons were seen as embedded in the positive charge like raisins in a plum pudding (although in Thomson&#x27;s model they were not stationary, but orbiting rapidly).

Thomson made the discovery around the same time that Walter Kaufmann and Emil Wiechert discovered the correct mass to charge ratio of these cathode rays (electrons).

The name &quot;electron&quot; was adopted for these particles by the scientific community, mainly due to the advocation by George Francis FitzGerald, Joseph Larmor, and Hendrik Lorentz. The term was originally coined by George Johnstone Stoney in 1891 as a tentative name for the basic unit of electrical charge (which had then yet to be discovered). For some years Thomson resisted using the word &quot;electron&quot; because he didn&#x27;t like how some physicists talked of a &quot;positive electron&quot; that was supposed to be the elementary unit of positive charge just as the &quot;negative electron&quot; is the elementary unit of negative charge. Thomson preferred to stick with the word &quot;corpuscle&quot; which he strictly defined as negatively charged. He relented by 1914, using the word &quot;electron&quot; in his book &quot;The Atomic Theory&quot;. In 1920, Rutherford and his fellows agreed to call the nucleus of the hydrogen ion &quot;proton&quot;, establishing a distinct name for the smallest known positively-charged particle of matter (that can exist independently anyway).

===Isotopes and mass spectrometry===

In 1912, as part of his exploration into the composition of the streams of positively charged particles then known as canal rays, Thomson and his research assistant F. W. Aston channelled a stream of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured its deflection by placing a photographic plate in its path. They observed two patches of light on the photographic plate (see image on right), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection, and concluded that neon is composed of atoms of two different atomic masses (neon-20 and neon-22), that is to say of two isotopes. This was the first evidence for isotopes of a stable element; Frederick Soddy had previously proposed the existence of isotopes to explain the decay of certain radioactive elements.

Thomson&#x27;s separation of neon isotopes by their mass was the first example of mass spectrometry, which was subsequently improved and developed into a general method by F. W. Aston and by A. J. Dempster.

===Experiments with cathode rays===
Earlier, physicists debated whether cathode rays were immaterial like light (&quot;some process in the aether&quot;) or were &quot;in fact wholly material, and ... mark the paths of particles of matter charged with negative electricity&quot;, quoting Thomson. The aetherial hypothesis was vague, but the particle hypothesis was definite enough for Thomson to test.

====Magnetic deflection====
Thomson first investigated the magnetic deflection of cathode rays. Cathode rays were produced in the side tube on the left of the apparatus and passed through the anode into the main bell jar, where they were deflected by a magnet. Thomson detected their path by the fluorescence on a squared screen in the jar. He found that whatever the material of the anode and the gas in the jar, the deflection of the rays was the same, suggesting that the rays were of the same form whatever their origin.

====Electrical charge ====

While supporters of the aetherial theory accepted the possibility that negatively charged particles are produced in Crookes tubes, they believed that they are a mere by-product and that the cathode rays themselves are immaterial. Thomson set out to investigate whether or not he could actually separate the charge from the rays.

Thomson constructed a Crookes tube with an electrometer set to one side, out of the direct path of the cathode rays. Thomson could trace the path of the ray by observing the phosphorescent patch it created where it hit the surface of the tube. Thomson observed that the electrometer registered a charge only when he deflected the cathode ray to it with a magnet. He concluded that the negative charge and the rays were one and the same.
====Electrical deflection====


In May–June 1897, Thomson investigated whether or not the rays could be deflected by an electric field. Previous experimenters had failed to observe this, but Thomson believed their experiments were flawed because their tubes contained too much gas.

Thomson constructed a Crookes tube with a better vacuum. At the start of the tube was the cathode from which the rays projected. The rays were sharpened to a beam by two metal slits – the first of these slits doubled as the anode, the second was connected to the earth. The beam then passed between two parallel aluminium plates, which produced an electric field between them when they were connected to a battery. The end of the tube was a large sphere where the beam would impact on the glass, created a glowing patch. Thomson pasted a scale to the surface of this sphere to measure the deflection of the beam. Any electron beam would collide with some residual gas atoms within the Crookes tube, thereby ionizing them and producing electrons and ions in the tube (space charge); in previous experiments this space charge electrically screened the externally applied electric field. However, in Thomson&#x27;s Crookes tube the density of residual atoms was so low that the space charge from the electrons and ions was insufficient to electrically screen the externally applied electric field, which permitted Thomson to successfully observe electrical deflection.

When the upper plate was connected to the negative pole of the battery and the lower plate to the positive pole, the glowing patch moved downwards, and when the polarity was reversed, the patch moved upwards.
====Measurement of mass-to-charge ratio====

In his classic experiment, Thomson measured the mass-to-charge ratio of the cathode rays by measuring how much they were deflected by a magnetic field and comparing this with the electric deflection. He used the same apparatus as in his previous experiment, but placed the discharge tube between the poles of a large electromagnet. He found that the mass-to-charge ratio was over a thousand times &quot;lower&quot; than that of a hydrogen ion (H+), suggesting either that the particles were very light and/or very highly charged. Significantly, the rays from every cathode yielded the same mass-to-charge ratio. This is in contrast to anode rays (now known to arise from positive ions emitted by the anode), where the mass-to-charge ratio varies from anode-to-anode. Thomson himself remained critical of what his work established, in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech referring to &quot;corpuscles&quot; rather than &quot;electrons&quot;.

Thomson&#x27;s calculations can be summarised as follows (in his original notation, using F instead of E for the electric field and H instead of B for the magnetic field):

The electric deflection is given by formula_1, where Θ is the angular electric deflection, F is applied electric intensity, e is the charge of the cathode ray particles, l is the length of the electric plates, m is the mass of the cathode ray particles and v is the velocity of the cathode ray particles. The magnetic deflection is given by formula_2, where φ is the angular magnetic deflection and H is the applied magnetic field intensity.

The magnetic field was varied until the magnetic and electric deflections were the same, when formula_3. This can be simplified to give formula_4. The electric deflection was measured separately to give Θ and H, F and l were known, so m/e could be calculated.
====Conclusions====
As to the source of these particles, Thomson believed they emerged from the molecules of gas in the vicinity of the cathode.

Thomson imagined the atom as being made up of these corpuscles orbiting in a sea of positive charge; this was his plum pudding model. This model was later proved incorrect when his student Ernest Rutherford showed that the positive charge is concentrated in the nucleus of the atom.

===Other work===
In 1905, Thomson discovered the natural radioactivity of potassium.

In 1906, Thomson demonstrated that hydrogen had only a single electron per atom. Previous theories allowed various numbers of electrons.

<doc id="70087" wikidata="Q810981" url="?curid=70087" title="Battle Abbey">
<text>Battle Abbey is a partially ruined Benedictine abbey in Battle, East Sussex, England. The abbey was built on the site of the Battle of Hastings and dedicated to St Martin of Tours. It is a Scheduled Monument.

The Grade I listed site is now operated by English Heritage as 1066 Battle of Hastings, Abbey and Battlefield, which includes the abbey buildings and ruins, a visitor centre with a film and exhibition about the battle, audio tours of the battlefield site, and the monks&#x27; gatehouse with recovered artefacts. The visitor centre includes a children&#x27;s discovery room and a café, and there is an outdoor-themed playground.

==History==
===Foundation===
William the Conqueror had vowed to build a monastery in the event that he won the battle. In 1070, Pope Alexander II ordered the Normans to do penance for killing so many people during their conquest of England. William vowed to build an abbey where the Battle of Hastings had taken place, with the high altar of the church on the supposed spot where King Harold fell in battle on Saturday, 14 October 1066.

William started building it but died before it was completed. The Vill survey of 1076 and early legal documents of adjoining property refer to a hospital or guesthouse which was attached to the gate of the abbey. The monastic buildings were about a mile in circuit and formed a large quadrangle, the high altar of the church being on the spot where Harold fell. The church was finished in about 1094 and consecrated during the reign of his son William II (commonly known as William Rufus). The king presented there his father&#x27;s sword and coronation robes.
The first monks were from the Benedictine Abbey of Marmoutier; the new foundation was dedicated to the Holy Trinity, St. Mary and St. Martin. It was designed for one hundred and forty monks, though there were never more than sixty in residence at one time.

William I had ruled that the church of St Martin of Battle was to be exempted from all episcopal jurisdiction, putting it on the level of Canterbury. The abbey was enriched by many privileges, including the right of sanctuary, of treasure trove, of free warren, and of inquest, and the inmates and tenants were exempt from all episcopal and secular jurisdiction. It was ruled by a mitred abbot who afterward had a seat in Parliament and who had the curious privilege of pardoning any criminal he might meet being led to execution.

Walter de Luci became abbot in 1139 and made several improvements. During the reign of Henry II of England, rival church authorities at Canterbury and Chichester unsuccessfully tested the charter. At the Abbey was kept the famous &quot;Roll of Battle Abbey&quot; which was a list of all those who accompanied William from Normandy. As time went on and the honour of descent from one of these Norman families was more highly thought of, unauthentic additions seem to have been made.

===Suppression===

The church was remodelled in the late 13th century, but virtually destroyed during the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538 under King Henry VIII. At the time of the suppression of the Abbey (May 1538), there were seventeen monks in residence. The displaced monks of Battle Abbey were provided with pensions, including the abbot John Hamond and the prior Richard Salesherst, as well as monks John Henfelde, William Ambrose, Henry Sinden, Thomas Bede and Thomas Levett, all bachelors in theology.

The abbey and much of its land was given by Henry VIII to his friend and Master of the Horse, Sir Anthony Browne, who demolished the church and parts of the cloister and turned the abbot&#x27;s quarters into a country house.

A triple-light window in Buckland Church, Tasmania, depicting the life of St John and the crucifixion of Jesus, is claimed to have once adorned Battle Abbey. The oft repeated legend goes that it was removed and hidden during the Cromwell era to protect it from destruction, until it was transported to Tasmania many years later. This seems highly unlikely. 

===Later history===
The abbey was sold in 1721 by Browne&#x27;s descendant, Anthony Browne, 6th Viscount Montagu, to Sir Thomas Webster, MP and baronet. Webster was succeeded by his son, Sir Whistler Webster, 2nd Baronet, who died childless in 1779, being succeeded in the baronetcy by his brother. Battle Abbey remained in the Webster family until 1857, when it was sold to Lord Harry Vane, later Duke of Cleveland. On the death of the Duchess of Cleveland in 1901, the estate was bought back by Sir Augustus Webster, 7th baronet.

Sir Augustus (son of Sir Augustus, 7th baronet) was born in 1864 and succeeded his father as 8th baronet in 1886. Sir Augustus was formerly a captain in the Coldstream Guards. With the death of the 8th baronet in 1923, the baronetage became extinct. The abbot&#x27;s house was an all-girls boarding school; Canadian troops were stationed there during the Second World War.

===Present day===
In 1976, the Webster family trustees sold Battle Abbey to the British government (albeit aided by a substantial contribution from a group of American philanthropists); it is now in the care of English Heritage. In 2016, Historic England commissioned tree-ring analyses of oak timbers from the gatehouse, dorter and reredorter to help identify when these areas might have been built. Findings imply phased building and local timber acquisition, with samples indicating early- and later-fifteenth-century building work.

The church&#x27;s high altar reportedly stood on the spot where Harold died. This is now marked by a plaque on the ground, and nearby is a monument to Harold erected by the people of Normandy in 1903. The ruins of the abbey, with the adjacent battlefield, are a popular tourist attraction, with events such as the Battle of Hastings reenactments.

All that is left of the abbey church itself today is its outline on the ground, but parts of some of the abbey&#x27;s buildings are still standing: those built between the 13th and 16th centuries. These are still in use as the independent Battle Abbey School. Visitors to the abbey are usually not allowed inside the school buildings, although during the school&#x27;s summer holidays, access to the abbot&#x27;s hall is often allowed.

The church was used as the primary ground for the filming of band Black Sabbath&#x27;s music video for &quot;Headless Cross&quot;, the title track of the album of the same name released in 1989.

<doc id="70089" wikidata="Q1323264" url="?curid=70089" title="Recursive descent parser">
<text>In computer science, a recursive descent parser is a kind of top-down parser built from a set of mutually recursive procedures (or a non-recursive equivalent) where each such procedure implements one of the nonterminals of the grammar. Thus the structure of the resulting program closely mirrors that of the grammar it recognizes.

A &quot;predictive parser&quot; is a recursive descent parser that does not require backtracking. Predictive parsing is possible only for the class of LL(&quot;k&quot;) grammars, which are the context-free grammars for which there exists some positive integer &quot;k&quot; that allows a recursive descent parser to decide which production to use by examining only the next &quot;k&quot; tokens of input. The LL(&quot;k&quot;) grammars therefore exclude all ambiguous grammars, as well as all grammars that contain left recursion. Any context-free grammar can be transformed into an equivalent grammar that has no left recursion, but removal of left recursion does not always yield an LL(&quot;k&quot;) grammar. A predictive parser runs in linear time.

Recursive descent with backtracking is a technique that determines which production to use by trying each production in turn. Recursive descent with backtracking is not limited to LL(&quot;k&quot;) grammars, but is not guaranteed to terminate unless the grammar is LL(&quot;k&quot;). Even when they terminate, parsers that use recursive descent with backtracking may require exponential time.

Although predictive parsers are widely used, and are frequently chosen if writing a parser by hand, programmers often prefer to use a table-based parser produced by a parser generator, either for an LL(&quot;k&quot;) language or using an alternative parser, such as LALR or LR. This is particularly the case if a grammar is not in LL(&quot;k&quot;) form, as transforming the grammar to LL to make it suitable for predictive parsing is involved. Predictive parsers can also be automatically generated, using tools like ANTLR.

Predictive parsers can be depicted using transition diagrams for each non-terminal symbol where the edges between the initial and the final states are labelled by the symbols (terminals and non-terminals) of the right side of the production rule.

==Example parser==
The following EBNF-like grammar (for Niklaus Wirth&#x27;s PL/0 programming language, from &quot;Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs&quot;) is in LL(1) form:
 program = block &quot;.&quot; .
 block =
 [&quot;const&quot; ident &quot;=&quot; number {&quot;,&quot; ident &quot;=&quot; number} &quot;;&quot;]
 [&quot;var&quot; ident {&quot;,&quot; ident} &quot;;&quot;]
 {&quot;procedure&quot; ident &quot;;&quot; block &quot;;&quot;} statement .
 statement =
 ident &quot;:=&quot; expression
 | &quot;call&quot; ident
 | &quot;begin&quot; statement {&quot;;&quot; statement } &quot;end&quot;
 | &quot;if&quot; condition &quot;then&quot; statement
 | &quot;while&quot; condition &quot;do&quot; statement .
 condition =
 &quot;odd&quot; expression
 | expression (&quot;=&quot;|&quot;#&quot;|&quot;&lt;&quot;|&quot;&lt;=&quot;|&quot;&gt;&quot;|&quot;&gt;=&quot;) expression .
 expression = [&quot;+&quot;|&quot;-&quot;] term {(&quot;+&quot;|&quot;-&quot;) term} .
 term = factor {(&quot;*&quot;|&quot;/&quot;) factor} .
 factor =
 ident
 | number
 | &quot;(&quot; expression &quot;)&quot; .
Terminals are expressed in quotes. Each nonterminal is defined by a rule in the grammar, except for &quot;ident&quot; and &quot;number&quot;, which are assumed to be implicitly defined.

===C implementation===

What follows is an implementation of a recursive descent parser for the above language in C. The parser reads in source code, and exits with an error message if the code fails to parse, exiting silently if the code parses correctly.

Notice how closely the predictive parser below mirrors the grammar above. There is a procedure for each nonterminal in the grammar. Parsing descends in a top-down manner until the final nonterminal has been processed. The program fragment depends on a global variable, &quot;sym&quot;, which contains the current symbol from the input, and the function &quot;nextsym&quot;, which updates &quot;sym&quot; when called.

The implementations of the functions &quot;nextsym&quot; and &quot;error&quot; are omitted for simplicity.

<doc id="70091" wikidata="Q155653" url="?curid=70091" title="Spirited Away">
<text>is a 2001 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It was produced by Toshio Suzuki, animated by Studio Ghibli, and distributed by Toho. The film stars Rumi Hiiragi, alongside Miyu Irino, Mari Natsuki, Takashi Naito, Yasuko Sawaguchi, Tsunehiko Kamijō, Takehiko Ono, and Bunta Sugawara. In &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, Chihiro &quot;Sen&quot; Ogino moves to a new neighborhood and inadvertently enters the world of &quot;kami&quot; (spirits of Japanese Shinto folklore). After her parents are turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba, Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba&#x27;s bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents and return to the human world.

Miyazaki wrote the screenplay after he decided the film would be based on the ten-year-old daughter of his friend Seiji Okuda, the film&#x27;s associate producer, who came to visit his house each summer. At the time, Miyazaki was developing two personal projects, but they were rejected. With a budget of US$19 million, production of &quot;Spirited Away&quot; began in 2000. Pixar animator John Lasseter, a fan and friend of Miyazaki, convinced Walt Disney Pictures to buy the film&#x27;s North American distribution rights, and served as executive producer of its English-dubbed version. Lasseter then hired Kirk Wise as director and Donald W. Ernst as producer, while screenwriters Cindy and Donald Hewitt wrote the English-language dialogue to match the characters&#x27; original Japanese-language lip movements.

Released in Japan on 20 July 2001, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; was widely acclaimed and commercially successful, grossing at the worldwide box office. Accordingly, it became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history with a total of ($305 million). It held the record for 19 years until it was surpassed by &quot;Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train&quot; in 2020.

&quot;Spirited Away&quot; was a co-recipient of the Golden Bear with &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival and became the first hand-drawn, Japanese anime and non-English-language animated film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards. The film is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time and has been included in various &quot;best-of&quot; lists, including ranking fourth on BBC&#x27;s 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century.

==Plot==

Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents Akio and Yūko travel to their new home. Akio, taking a shortcut, stops in front of a tunnel leading to what appears to be an abandoned amusement park, which Yūko insists on exploring over Chihiro&#x27;s protestations. Upon finding a seemingly empty restaurant still stocked with food, Chihiro&#x27;s parents immediately begin to eat. While exploring further, Chihiro finds an enormous bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to return across the riverbed before sunset. However, Chihiro discovers her parents have been transformed into pigs and she cannot cross the now-flooded river.

Haku finds Chihiro and instructs her to ask for a job from the bathhouse&#x27;s boiler-man, Kamaji, a yōkai commanding the susuwatari. Kamaji instead asks a worker named Lin to bring Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse and cursed her parents, as well as Haku&#x27;s master. Yubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but eventually gives her a work contract. As Chihiro signs the contract with her name (), Yubaba takes away the second kanji in her name, renaming her . She soon forgets her real name, and Haku later explains that Yubaba controls people by taking their names; if she completely forgets hers like he once did, she will never be able to leave the spirit world.

The other workers, except for Kamaji and Lin, frequently mock Sen. While working, she invites a silent creature named No-Face inside, believing him to be a customer. The spirit of a polluted river arrives as Sen&#x27;s first customer. After she cleans him, he gives her a magic emetic dumpling as a token of gratitude. Meanwhile, No-Face demands food from the bathhouse workers, granting gold copied from the river spirit in exchange. However, when Sen declines the gold and leaves, he angrily swallows some workers.

Sen sees paper shikigami attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku metamorphosed. When the seriously injured Haku crashes into Yubaba&#x27;s penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami that stowed away on her back shapeshifts into Yubaba&#x27;s twin sister Zeniba, who turns Yubaba&#x27;s son, Boh, into a mouse and creates a false copy of him. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from her that carries a deadly curse. Haku strikes the shikigami, causing Zeniba to vanish. Once he and Sen fall into the boiler room, she gives him part of the emetic dumpling to vomit up the seal and a slug that Sen disgustedly kills.

Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba. She confronts an engorged No-Face and feeds him the rest of the dumpling to regurgitate the workers. No-Face follows Sen out of the bathhouse, and Lin helps them leave. Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel to see Zeniba with train tickets gifted by Kamaji. Meanwhile, Yubaba nearly orders Sen&#x27;s parents&#x27; slaughtering, but Haku reveals Boh is missing and offers to retrieve him if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba complies, but only if Sen can pass a final test.

Sen meets with Zeniba, who makes her a magic hairband and reveals that Yubaba used the slug to control Haku. Using his dragon form, Haku flies Sen and Boh back, while No-Face decides to stay with Zeniba. Mid-flight, Sen recalls falling into the Kohaku River years earlier and being washed safely ashore, correctly guessing Haku&#x27;s real identity as .

When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba tests Sen to identify her parents among a group of pigs to leave. After she answers correctly that none of the pigs are her parents, her contract disappears and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now-dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents. Shortly before leaving for her new home, Chihiro looks back at the tunnel with her hairband from Zeniba still intact.

==Production==
===Development and inspiration===


During summers, Hayao Miyazaki spent his vacation at a mountain cabin with his family and five girls who were friends of the family. The idea for &quot;Spirited Away&quot; came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films for small children and teenagers such as &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; and &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;, but he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read the shōjo manga magazines (like &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; and &quot;Ribon&quot;) that the girls had left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on &quot;crushes&quot; and romance. Miyazaki felt this was not what these young friends &quot;held dear in their hearts&quot;, and resolved to make the film about a young heroine whom they could look up to.
Miyazaki had wanted to produce a new film for years, but his two previous proposalsone based on the Japanese book by Sachiko Kashiwaba, and another about a teenage heroinewere rejected. His third proposal, which ended up becoming &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, was more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki&#x27;s hometown. He thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, and there was a small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bath house. Miyazaki was always curious about what was behind it, and he made up several stories about it, one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of &quot;Spirited Away&quot;.
Production of &quot;Spirited Away&quot; commenced in February 2000 on a budget of (US$15 million). The film was produced in association with Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Tohokushinsha Film, and Mitsubishi. Disney&#x27;s 10% investment allowed for the right of first refusal for North American distribution. As with &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;, Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli staff experimented with computer animation. With the use of more computers and programs such as Softimage 3D, the staff learned the software, but used the technology carefully so that it enhanced the story, instead of &quot;stealing the show&quot;. Each character was mostly hand-drawn, with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see if they were getting it just right. The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length. When production began, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the &quot;eye candy&quot; in the film because he wanted it to be simple. Miyazaki did not want to make the hero a &quot;pretty girl&quot;. At the beginning, he was frustrated at how she looked &quot;dull&quot; and thought, &quot;She isn&#x27;t cute. Isn&#x27;t there something we can do?&quot; As the film neared the end, however, he was relieved to feel &quot;she will be a charming woman.&quot;

During production, Miyazaki often sought inspiration by visiting the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei, Tokyo. He based some of the buildings in the spirit world on the Pseudo-Western style buildings from the Meiji period that were available there. The museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic, &quot;especially when I stand here alone in the evening, near closing time, and the sun is setting – tears well up in my eyes.&quot; Another major inspiration was the , a traditional Japanese inn located in Yamagata Prefecture, famous for its exquisite architecture and ornamental features. While some guidebooks and articles claim that the old gold town of Jiufen in Taiwan served as an inspirational model for the film, Miyazaki has denied this. The Dōgo Onsen is also often said to be a key inspiration for the &quot;Spirited Away&quot; onsen/bathhouse.

Toshio Suzuki, the producer of the film, also cites European inspirations and influences in the production of &quot;Spirited Away&quot;. He specifically invokes the structure of the film as European-inspired due to Miyazaki&#x27;s own influences by European films such as &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; and &quot;The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep&quot;.

===Music===

The film score of &quot;Spirited Away&quot; was composed and conducted by Miyazaki&#x27;s regular collaborator Joe Hisaishi, and performed by the New Japan Philharmonic. The soundtrack received awards at the 56th Mainichi Film Competition Award for Best Music, the Tokyo International Anime Fair 2001 Best Music Award in the Theater Movie category, and the 17th Japan Gold Disk Award for Animation Album of the Year. Later, Hisaishi added lyrics to &quot;One Summer&#x27;s Day&quot; and named the new version of the song which was performed by Ayaka Hirahara.

The closing song, was written and performed by Youmi Kimura, a composer and lyre-player from Osaka. The lyrics were written by Kimura&#x27;s friend Wakako Kaku. The song was intended to be used for , a different Miyazaki film which was never released. In the special features of the Japanese DVD, Hayao Miyazaki explains how the song in fact inspired him to create &quot;Spirited Away&quot;. The song itself would be recognized as Gold at the 43rd Japan Record Awards.

Besides the original soundtrack, there is also an image album, titled , that contains 10 tracks.

===English dub===
John Lasseter, Pixar animator and a fan and friend of Miyazaki, would often sit with his staff and watch Miyazaki&#x27;s work when encountering story problems. After seeing &quot;Spirited Away&quot; Lasseter was ecstatic. Upon hearing his reaction to the film, Disney CEO Michael Eisner asked Lasseter if he would be interested in introducing &quot;Spirited Away&quot; to an American audience. Lasseter obliged by agreeing to serve as the executive producer for the English adaptation. Following this, several others began to join the project: &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; co-director Kirk Wise and &quot;Aladdin&quot; co-producer Donald W. Ernst joined Lasseter as director and producer of &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, respectively. Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt penned the English-language dialogue, which they wrote in order to match the characters&#x27; original Japanese-language lip movements.

The cast of the film consists of Daveigh Chase, Jason Marsden, Suzanne Pleshette (in her final film role before her death in January 2008), Michael Chiklis, Lauren Holly, Susan Egan, David Ogden Stiers and John Ratzenberger (a Pixar regular). Advertising was limited, with &quot;Spirited Away&quot; being mentioned in a small scrolling section of the film section of &quot;Disney.com&quot;; Disney had sidelined their official website for &quot;Spirited Away&quot; and given the film a comparatively small promotional budget. Marc Hairston writing for FPS Magazine argues that this was a justified response to Studio Ghibli&#x27;s retention of the merchandising rights to the film and characters, which limited Disney&#x27;s ability to properly market the film.

==Themes==

=== Supernaturalism ===
The major themes of &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto-Buddhist folklore, centre on the protagonist, Chihiro, and her liminal journey through the realm of spirits. The central location of the film is a Japanese bathhouse where a great variety of Japanese folklore creatures, including kami, come to bathe. Miyazaki cites the solstice rituals when villagers call forth their local kami and invite them into their baths. Chihiro also encounters kami of animals and plants. Miyazaki says of this:Chihiro&#x27;s archetypal entrance into another world changes her status as one somewhere between child and adult. Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting. The use of the word &quot;kamikakushi&quot; (literally &#x27;hidden by gods&#x27;) within the Japanese title, and its associated folklore, reinforces this liminal passage: &quot;Kamikakushi is a verdict of &#x27;social death&#x27; in this world, and coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant &#x27;social resurrection.&#x27;&quot;

Additional themes are expressed through No-Face, who reflects the characters who surround him, learning by example and taking the traits of whomever he consumes. This nature results in No-Face&#x27;s monstrous rampage through the bathhouse. After Chihiro saves No-Face with the emetic dumpling, he becomes timid once more. At the end of the film, Zeniba decides to take care of No-Face so he can develop without the negative influence of the bathhouse.

==== Fantasy ====
The film has been compared to Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, as the stories are set in fantasy worlds, involve disturbances in logic and stability, and there are motifs such as food having metamorphic qualities; though other developments and themes are not shared.

Yubaba has many similarities to the Coachman from the 1940 film &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, in the sense that she mutates humans into pigs in a similar way that the boys of Pleasure Island were mutated into donkeys. Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba&#x27;s seizure of Chihiro&#x27;s true name symbolically kills the child, who must then assume adulthood. She then undergoes a rite of passage according to the monomyth format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.

=== Traditional Japanese culture ===
&quot;Spirited Away&quot; contains critical commentary on modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues. Chihiro has been seen as a representation of the &quot;shōjo&quot;, whose roles and ideology had changed dramatically since post-war Japan. Just as Chihiro seeks her past identity, Japan, in its anxiety over the economic downturn occurring during the release of the film in 2001, sought to reconnect to past values. In an interview, Miyazaki has commented on this nostalgic element for an old Japan.

Japanese philosophy plays a huge role in &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, specifically through concepts like &quot;Kami&quot; and principles like &quot;Mottainai&quot; and &quot;On&quot;. The concept of Kami, for instance, involves various spirits that each represent different elements and aspects of nature. The principle of Mottainai, which is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, embodies a sense of regret towards waste, valuing the complete utilization of an object or resource. While the principle of On, a key tenet of Japanese ethics that signifies a sense of moral indebtedness, plays a significant role in Chihiro&#x27;s character development.

=== Western consumerism ===
Similar to the Japanese concept of &quot;On&quot;, the film can be partly understood as an exploration of the effect of greediness and Western consumerism on traditional Japanese culture. For instance, Yubaba is stylistically unique within the bathhouse, wearing a Western dress and living among European décor and furnishings, in contrast with the minimalist Japanese style of her employees&#x27; quarters, representing the Western capitalist influence over Japan in its Meiji period and beyond. Along with its function within the ostensible coming of age theme, Yubaba&#x27;s act of taking Chihiro&#x27;s name and replacing it with Sen (an alternate reading of &quot;chi&quot;, the first character in Chihiro&#x27;s name, ) can be thought of as symbolic of capitalism&#x27;s single-minded concern with value.

The film&#x27;s setting encapsulates Miyazaki&#x27;s commentary on modern Japanese values and the erosion of cultural heritage. The bathhouse, situated within an abandoned theme park, symbolizes Japan&#x27;s distorted cultural identity. This once-traditional locale is marred by neon signs and Westernization, exemplifying cultural degradation. Early scenes highlight economic concerns and consumerism. The film&#x27;s visuals underscore the commercialization of Japanese culture. The failed theme park serves as a metaphor for the unsuccessful fusion of ideologies. The Meiji design of the park is the setting for Chihiro&#x27;s parents&#x27; metamorphosis – the family arrives in an imported Audi car and the father wears a European-styled polo shirt, reassuring Chihiro that he has &quot;credit cards and cash&quot;, before morphing into literal consumerist pigs because of their bad habits. Miyazaki has stated:
The bathhouse of the spirits cannot be seen as a place free of ambiguity and darkness. Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of No-Face. In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro&#x27;s journey and transformation is the constantly chaotic carnival in the background.

=== Environmentalism ===
Commentators have often referred to environmental themes in the films of Miyazaki. In &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, two major instances of allusions to environmental issues have been noted. Pam Coats, for example, a Vice President of Walt Disney Feature Animation, describes Chihiro dealing with the &quot;stink spirit&quot;, who, it turns out, is actually a river spirit but is so corrupted with filth that one cannot tell what it is at first glance. It only becomes clean again when Chihiro pulls out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go.

The second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of humans&#x27; need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and destruction of natural habitats; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals&#x27; homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but do not think about how it can affect other living things.

==Release==
===Box office and theatrical release===
&quot;Spirited Away&quot; was released theatrically in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor Toho. It grossed a record ¥1.6 billion ($13.1 million) in its first three days, beating the previous record set by &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;. It was number one at the Japanese box office for its first eleven weeks and spent 16 weeks there in total. After 22 weeks of release and after grossing $224 million in Japan, it started its international release, opening in Hong Kong on 13 December 2001. It was the first film that had grossed more than $200 million at the worldwide box office excluding the United States. It went on to gross ¥30.4 billion to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, according to the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan. It also set the all-time attendance record in Japan, surpassing the 16.8 million tickets sold by &quot;Titanic&quot;. Its gross at the Japanese box office has since increased to , .

In February 2002, Wild Bunch, an international sales company that had recently spun off from its former parent StudioCanal, picked up the international sale rights for the film outside of Asia and France. The company would then on-sell it to independent distributors across the world. On 13 April 2002, The Walt Disney Company acquired the Taiwanese, Singapore, Hong Kong, French and North American sale rights to the film, alongside Japanese Home Media rights.

Disney&#x27;s English dub of the film, supervised by Lasseter, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2002 and was later released in the United States on 20 September 2002. The film grossed $450,000 in its opening weekend from 26 theatres. &quot;Spirited Away&quot; had very little marketing, less than Disney&#x27;s other B-films, with a maximum of 151 theatres showing the film in 2002. After the 2003 Oscars, it expanded to 714 theatres. It ultimately grossed around $10 million by September 2003. Outside of Japan and the United States, the movie was moderately successful in both South Korea and France where it grossed $11 million and $6 million, respectively. In Argentina, it is in the top 10 anime films with the most tickets sold.

In the United Kingdom, then-independent based film distributor Optimum Releasing acquired the rights to the movie from Wild Bunch in January 2003. The company then released it theatrically on 12 September 2003. The movie grossed $244,437 on its opening weekend from 51 theatres, and by the end of its theatrical run in October, the movie has grossed $1,383,023 in the country.

About 18 years after its original release in Japan, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; had a theatrical release in China on 21 June 2019. It followed the theatrical release in China of &quot;My Neighbour Totoro&quot; in December 2018. The delayed theatrical release in China was due to long-standing political tensions between China and Japan, but many Chinese became familiar with Miyazaki&#x27;s films due to rampant video piracy. It topped the Chinese box office with a opening weekend, beating &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; in China. In its second weekend, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; grossed a cumulative in China, and was second only behind &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; that weekend. , the film has grossed in China, bringing its worldwide total box office to over .

&quot;Spirited Away&quot; worldwide box office total stands at US$395,802,070.

Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; positively reviewed the film and praised the animation. Mitchell drew a favorable comparison to Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, and wrote that Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;movies are as much about moodiness as mood&quot; and that &quot;the prospect of animated figures&#x27; not being what they seem – either spiritually or physically – heightens the tension&quot;. Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; said that &quot;Spirited Away&quot; &quot;can be enjoyed by sprigs and adults alike&quot; and praised the animation and music.

=== Accolades ===

== Impact and legacy ==
=== Film industry ===
&quot;Spirited Away&quot; is frequently regarded as one of the best films of the 21st century as well as one of the greatest animated films ever made. &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; wrote that the film &quot;set the bar extremely high for all anime movies that followed it – including Studio Ghibli&#x27;s&quot; and further explained that &quot;It&#x27;s a movie many people re-watch due to its comfort and nostalgia, and since Netflix brought the Ghibli movies to North America last year, it&#x27;s become even more accessible&quot;. Swapnil Dhruv Bose from &quot;Far Out Magazine&quot; declared the film to be &quot;the greatest animated film of all time&quot; and explained that it &quot;resonated with audiences all over the world despite the existence of cultural barriers is because of its brilliantly devised universality&quot; and has the ability to &quot;generate fascinating multiplicities which morph according to the age of the viewer&quot;. In another article detailing Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s wide impact to the film industry, he wrote &quot;The influence of &quot;Spirited Away&quot; can be easily observed in Disney productions like &quot;Brave&quot; and &quot;Frozen&quot;, thanks to John Lasseter&#x27;s (the Chief Creative Officer of Pixar) efforts to introduce it to Western audiences&quot;. &quot;Vice&quot; also declared &quot;Spirited Away&quot; to be the all-time best animated film and wrote that the film &quot;showed how breathtaking, heartfelt, and serious animation can be&quot; that &quot;Pixar, Disney, and other mainstream animators have still failed to genuinely realize 15 years later&quot;.

Film director Steven Spielberg said that &quot;Spirited Away&quot; might be &quot;better than any Disney films&quot; he has ever seen. Rayna Denison, professor of film, television, and media studies, told &quot;Time&quot; that &quot;This is a film made by a master animator at the height of his powers and it is one where the quality of the animation really does set it apart from everything else around it. Nobody else was making films that looked like this or that were as inventive as this was at this time&quot;. The film has been cited as influence for various Disney and Pixar animated films. Production designer Harley Jessup said that he initially looked at &quot;Spirited Away&quot; and was inspired by the spiritual feelings elements to utilize them in &quot;Coco&quot;. Co-writers Ken and Ryan Firpo cited the film as one of the influences that helps them explore &quot;ideas of morality and humanity&quot; in &quot;Eternals&quot;. &quot;Turning Red&quot; director Domee Shi named &quot;Spirited Away&quot; as one of her favorite animated films and one of the influences for her film.

===Commercial and cultural significance===
According to &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; &quot;arrived at a time when animation was widely perceived as a genre solely for children, and when cultural differences often became barriers to the global distribution of animated works&quot; but it &quot;shattered preconceived notions about the art form and also proved that, as a film created in Japanese with elements of Japanese folklore central to its core, it could resonate deeply with audiences around the world&quot;. Denison emphasized that John Lasseter and Disney &quot;boosted &quot;Spirited Away&quot; visibility in America by heavily campaigning for the film to be considered for the Academy Awards&quot;, and cited it as one of the reasons why it won Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Writer Jonathan Clements, whose published works revolve around East Asian culture, anime, and Japanese television dramas, emphasized that the film&#x27;s Oscar win was &quot;a wake-up call for a lot of people in the film business who had been disregarding Japanese animation for years&quot;. Susan Napier, professor of Japanese studies at Tufts University, called &quot;Spirited Away&quot; wins at major Western award shows &quot;a very big shot in the arm to the Japanese animation industry&quot;. She further explained that cartoons in the West have often been seen as &quot;childish, vulgar, things that you didn&#x27;t take seriously&quot; but after the film took home the Academy Award, people were starting to see animation as &quot;a real art form&quot;.

===Stage adaptation===
A stage adaptation of &quot;Spirited Away&quot; was announced in February 2021 with a world premiere planned in Tokyo on 28 February 2022. It is written and directed by John Caird, with Toho as the production company, with Studio Ghibli&#x27;s blessing. The role of Chihiro is played by both Kanna Hashimoto and Mone Kamishiraishi. In August 2023, it was announced that the production would have its European premiere at the London Coliseum from April 2024, with most of the cast reprising their roles.

<text>Word usage is the way a word, phrase, or concept is used in a language or language variety. Lexicographers gather samples of written instances where a word is used and analyze them to determine patterns of regional or social usage as well as meaning. A word, for example the English word &quot;donny&quot; (a round rock about the size of a man&#x27;s head), may be only a rare regional usage, or a word may be used worldwide by standard English speakers and have one or several evolving definitions.

Word usage may also involve grammar.

<text>Johann Georg Leopold Mozart (November 14, 1719 – May 28, 1787) was a German composer, violinist, and music theorist. He is best known today as the father and teacher of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and for his violin textbook &quot;Versuch einer gründlichen Violinschule&quot; (1756).

==Life and career==
===Childhood and youth===
He was born in Augsburg, son of Johann Georg Mozart, a bookbinder, and his second wife Anna Maria Sulzer. From an early age he sang as a choirboy. He attended a local Jesuit school, , where he studied logic, science, and theology, graduating &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1735. He studied then at the St. Salvator Lyzeum.

While a student in Augsburg, he appeared in student theater productions as an actor and singer, and became a skilled violinist and organist. He also developed an interest, which he retained, in microscopes and telescopes. Although his parents had planned a career for Leopold as a Catholic priest, this apparently was not Leopold&#x27;s own wish. An old school friend told Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1777, &quot;Ah he [Leopold] was a great fellow. My father thought the world of him. And how he hoodwinked the clerics about becoming a priest!&quot;

He withdrew from the St. Salvator Lyzeum after less than a year. Following a year&#x27;s delay, he moved to Salzburg to resume his education, enrolling in November 1737 at the Benedictine University (now University of Salzburg) to study philosophy and jurisprudence. At the time Salzburg was the capital of an independent state within the Holy Roman Empire (the Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg), now part of Austria. Except for periods of travel, Leopold spent the rest of his life there.

Leopold received the degree of Bachelor of Philosophy in 1738. However, in September 1739, he was expelled from the university for poor attendance, having &quot;hardly attended Natural Science more than once or twice&quot;.

===Early music career===
In 1740, Mozart began his career as a professional musician, becoming violinist and valet to one of the university&#x27;s canons, Johann Baptist, Count of Thurn-Valsassina and Taxis. This was also the year of his first musical publication, the six Trio Sonatas, Opus 1. These were titled &quot;Sonate sei da chiesa e da camera&quot;; Leopold did the work of copper engraving himself. He continued to compose, producing a series of German Passion cantatas.

In 1747, he married Anna Maria Pertl, who bore him seven children, although only two of them survived past infancy:
* Johann Leopold Joachim (August 18, 1748 – February 2, 1749)
* Maria Anna Cordula (June 18, 1749 – June 24, 1749)
* Maria Anna Nepomucena Walpurgis (May 13, 1750 – July 29, 1750)
* Maria Anna Walburga Ignatia, &quot;Nannerl&quot; (July 30, 1751 – October 29, 1829)
* Johann Karl Amadeus (November 4, 1752 – February 2, 1753)
* Maria Crescentia Francisca de Paula (May 9, 1754 – June 27, 1754)
* Johann Chrysostomus Wolfgang Theophilus (January 27, 1756 – December 5, 1791)

In 1743, Leopold Mozart was appointed to a position (fourth violinist) in the musical establishment of Count Leopold Anton von Firmian, the ruling Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. His duties included composition and the teaching of violin (later, piano) to the choirboys of the Salzburg cathedral. He was promoted to second violinist in 1758 and in 1763 to deputy Kapellmeister. He rose no further; others were repeatedly promoted over him to the head position of Kapellmeister.

The question of whether Leopold was successful as a composer (either in terms of artistic success or fame) is debated. The &quot;Grove Dictionary&quot; says that as of 1756, &quot;Mozart was already well-known. His works circulated widely in German-speaking Europe.&quot; However, biographer Maynard Solomon asserts that he &quot;failed to make his mark as a composer&quot;, and Alfred Einstein &quot;judged him to be an undistinguished composer&quot;.

Scholars agree, however, that Leopold was successful as a pedagogue. In 1755, he wrote his &quot;Versuch einer gründlichen Violinschule&quot;, a comprehensive treatise on violin playing. This work was published in 1756 (the year of Wolfgang&#x27;s birth), and went through two further German editions (1769, 1787), as well as being translated into Dutch (1766) and French (1770). Today, the work is consulted by musicians interested in 18th-century performance practice; see Historically informed performance. This work made a reputation in Europe for Leopold, and his name begins to appear around this time in music dictionaries and other works of musical pedagogy.

===As teacher of Nannerl and Wolfgang===

Mozart discovered that his two children were child prodigies in about 1759, when he began with keyboard lessons for the seven-year-old Nannerl. The toddler Wolfgang immediately began imitating his sister, at first picking out thirds on the keyboard and then making rapid progress under Leopold&#x27;s instruction. By 1762, the children were ready to work as concert performers, and Leopold began taking the family on extensive concert tours, performing for both aristocracy and public, throughout central and western Europe. This tour included Munich, Vienna, Pressburg (Bratislava), Paris and the Hague together with a lengthy stay in London; see Mozart family Grand Tour.

The discovery of his children&#x27;s talent is considered to have been a life-transforming event for Mozart. He once referred to his son as the &quot;miracle which God let be born in Salzburg&quot;. Of Leopold&#x27;s attitude, the &quot;Grove Dictionary&quot; says:

By &quot;missionary&quot;, the &quot;Grove Dictionary&quot; refers to the family&#x27;s concert tours.

Scholars differ on whether the tours made substantial profits. To be sure, often the children performed before large audiences and took in large sums, but the expenses of travel were also very high, and no money at all was made during the various times that Mozart and the children suffered serious illnesses. Mozart biographer Maynard takes the view that the tours were lucrative and produced long-term profits for Leopold; Ruth states to the contrary that their income generally only covered their travel and living expenses.

Since the instruction took much of his time, and the touring kept him away from Salzburg for long periods, Mozart cut down his activities in other areas. Nannerl later claimed that he &quot;entirely gave up both violin instruction and composition in order to direct that time not claimed in service to the prince to the education of his two children&quot;. After 1762, his compositional efforts seem to have been limited to revising his earlier work, and by 1771 he had ceased composing altogether.

The touring continued into the early 1770s. The last three trips were to Italy, with only the father accompanying Wolfgang. Leopold Mozart&#x27;s failure to advance above his Vice-Kapellmeister position at Salzburg is attributed by the &quot;Grove Dictionary&quot; to the great amount of time that the journeys kept him away from Salzburg (the longest journey was about three-and-a-half years). After the final return from Italy in 1773, Leopold was repeatedly passed over for the Kapellmeister post.

===Family life in Salzburg===

Although Mozart is portrayed (notably by Halliwell 1998) as generally quite worried about money, the Mozart family evidently by 1773 felt prosperous enough to upgrade their living quarters. They left the home in the Getreidegasse where the children had been born and moved to rooms in the &quot;Tanzmeisterhaus&quot; (&quot;Dancing-Master&#x27;s House&quot;), which had been the home of the recently deceased dancing master Franz Karl Gottlieb Spöckner. As tenants of Spöckner&#x27;s cousin and heir Maria Anna Raab, the Mozarts had eight rooms, including the quite large room that Spöckner had used for dancing lessons. This the Mozarts used for teaching, for domestic concerts, for storing keyboard instruments sold by Leopold, and for &quot;Bölzlschiessen&quot;, a form of recreation in which family and their guests shot airguns at humorously designed paper targets.

Starting around this time, a major preoccupation was the lengthy and frustrating struggle to find a professional position for his son. His wife died in 1778 in Paris while accompanying Wolfgang on a job-hunting tour.

==Relations with his children in their adulthood==
Mozart is a controversial figure among his biographers, with the largest disagreements arising concerning his role as the parent of adult children. Mozart biographer Maynard Solomon has taken a particularly harsh view of Leopold, treating him as tyrannical, , and possessive; Ruth Halliwell adopts a far more sympathetic view, portraying his correspondence as a sensible effort to guide the life of a grossly irresponsible Wolfgang.

===Relations with Nannerl===
Wolfgang left home permanently in 1781 (see below), and from this time until 1784, his father lived in Salzburg with just Nannerl (now in her early thirties) and their servants. Nannerl had a number of suitors, of whom the most important was Franz Armand d&#x27;Ippold, with whom she was evidently in love. In the end she did not marry him, and the reason for this is unknown. One possibility, frequently entertained by biographers, is that the marriage was blocked by Leopold, who liked having Nannerl at home as the lady of the house. However, Halliwell observes that no written evidence on this point survives and insists that we simply do not know why Nannerl married so late. Nannerl finally did marry in August 1784, at age 33. She moved to the home of her new husband, Johann Baptist Franz von Berchtold zu Sonnenburg, in the small rural town of St. Gilgen, roughly six hours journey east of Salzburg.

During his remaining years, Mozart spent a fair amount of his time trying to help Nannerl at a distance, as her new marriage situation, involving five apparently ill-educated stepchildren, was apparently not easy. According to Halliwell, Nannerl depended on him in many ways: he did &quot;shopping [and] the engagement of servants. ... He relayed news from Salzburg, Munich, and Vienna to divert her, did his best to organize the maintenance of her fortepiano, paid for Wolfgang&#x27;s music to be copied and arranged for her to receive it; collected musicians together when she had visited him so that she could play it with most of the parts; .. tried to look after her health; and encouraged her to stand up to her husband when he was being unreasonable.&quot; Following Leopold&#x27;s death in 1787, Nannerl had to do without this support, and Halliwell asserts that &quot;there is every reason to believe that Leopold&#x27;s death was devastating&quot; to her.&quot;

===Raising Nannerl&#x27;s child===

In July 1785, Nannerl came to Salzburg to give birth to her first child, a son. The infant stayed with his grandfather when she returned home, and with the assistance of his servants, he raised the child. He frequently sent letters to Nannerl (at least one per week) that usually began with the sentence &quot;Leopoldl is healthy&quot;, (&quot;Leopoldl&quot; is &quot;Little Leopold&quot;) and offered a full report on the child. Leopoldl stayed until his grandfather&#x27;s death in May 1787. He apparently found raising his grandson a happy experience. Halliwell relates one repeated episode:

Maynard Solomon suggests that in keeping his grandson in his home, Mozart may have hoped to train yet another musical prodigy. Halliwell notes a different possibility: that conditions for child-rearing in the Berchtold household were distinctly suboptimal.

===Relations with Wolfgang===

Wolfgang left home for good in 1781, when instead of returning from a stay in Vienna with his employer Archbishop Colloredo he remained in the city to pursue a freelance career. This effort was to a fair degree successful; Wolfgang achieved great fame and was for a time quite prosperous (though poor planning later changed this status). The move almost certainly aided Wolfgang&#x27;s musical development; the great majority of his most celebrated works were composed in Vienna.

As indicated by Mozart&#x27;s return letters (which alone survive), his father was strongly opposed to the Vienna move, wanting Wolfgang to return to Salzburg. A fairly harsh family quarrel resulted. He was also strongly opposed to Wolfgang&#x27;s marriage to Constanze Weber in 1782, and gave his permission late, reluctantly, and under duress. Biographers differ on the extent that Constanze was later snubbed by Leopold, if at all, during her visit with Wolfgang (July – October 1783) to Salzburg; the &quot;Grove Dictionary&quot; calls the visit &quot;not entirely happy&quot;.

In 1785, he visited Wolfgang and Constanze in Vienna, at a time when his son&#x27;s career success was at its peak. He witnessed first hand his son&#x27;s success as a performer, and on February 12 heard Joseph Haydn&#x27;s widely quoted words of praise, upon hearing the string quartets Wolfgang dedicated to him, &quot;Before God and as an honest man I tell you that your son is the greatest composer known to me either in person or by name: He has taste, and, furthermore, the most profound knowledge of composition.&quot; The visit was the last time that Leopold saw his son, though they continued to correspond, and Wolfgang sometimes sent copies of his piano concertos and string quartets for Leopold and Nannerl to perform with friends.

Later in 1785, when Leopold Mozart took in Nannerl&#x27;s child, Wolfgang was not informed. However, in the following year Wolfgang found this out from a mutual acquaintance in Vienna. At this time, Wolfgang wrote to Leopold to ask if he would be willing to take care of his own two children while he and Constanze went on concert tour. Leopold turned him down, probably with harsh words. His letter to Wolfgang does not survive, but his summary to Nannerl of it does (November 17, 1786):

For interpretations of this letter, see , which takes a viewpoint sympathetic to Leopold, and , which takes a viewpoint sympathetic to Wolfgang.

Starting around the time he wrote this letter and continuing through the first part of 1787, his health was failing. He had become seriously ill by April 4. On this day, Wolfgang wrote to him in alarm at the news, though he did not travel to Salzburg to see him. When Leopold Mozart died on 28 May (see below), Wolfgang was unable to attend the funeral, the travel time to Salzburg being too long.

Little information is available on how Wolfgang took his father&#x27;s death, but a postscript he included in a letter to his friend Gottfried von Jacquin suggests that, despite the quarrels and partial estrangement, his father&#x27;s death was a blow to him: &quot;I inform you that on returning home today I received the sad news of my most beloved father&#x27;s death. You can imagine the state I am in.&quot;

== Compositions ==
:&quot;See :Category:Compositions by Leopold Mozart&quot;
Leopold Mozart&#x27;s music is inevitably overshadowed by the work of his son Wolfgang, and in any case the father willingly sacrificed his own career to promote his son&#x27;s. But his &quot;Cassation in G for Orchestra and Toys&quot; (Toy Symphony), (also variously attributed to Joseph Haydn, Michael Haydn, and Austrian Benedictine monk ) remains popular, and a number of symphonies, a trumpet concerto, and other works also survive.

A contemporary report described what he had composed prior to 1757:

Leopold Mozart was much concerned with a naturalistic feel to his compositions, his &quot;Jagdsinfonie&quot; (or &quot;Sinfonia da Caccia&quot; for four horns and strings) calls for shotguns, and his &quot;Bauernhochzeit&quot; (Peasant Wedding) includes bagpipes, hurdy-gurdy, a dulcimer, whoops and whistles (ad. lib.), and pistol shots. &quot;&quot; (musical sleigh ride) calls for bells and whips in addition to a rich orchestra.

His oeuvre was extensive, but only recently have scholars begun to assess the scope or the quality of it; much is lost, and it is not known how representative the surviving works are of his overall output. Cliff Eisen, who wrote a doctoral dissertation on Leopold Mozart&#x27;s symphonies, finds in a Symphony in G major examples of his &quot;sensitivity to orchestral colour&quot; and a work that &quot;compares favourably with those of virtually any of Mozart&#x27;s immediate contemporaries&quot;.

Some of his work was erroneously attributed to Wolfgang and some pieces attributed to Leopold were subsequently shown to be the work of Wolfgang. Much of what survives is light music but there is some more substantial work including his &quot;Sacramental Litany&quot; in D major (1762) and three fortepiano sonatas, all published in his lifetime.

==Assessment==
The assessment of Leopold Mozart as a person and as a father brings forth serious disagreement among scholars. The &quot;Grove Dictionary&quot; article, by Cliff Eisen, denounces &quot;his misrepresentation at the hands of later biographers&quot;:

Other scholars have taken a harsher view. Solomon portrays Mozart as a man who loved his children but was unwilling to grant them their independence when they reached adulthood, resulting in considerable hardship for them. Daniel Steptoe makes a similar assessment, and particularly faults Leopold for having blamed Wolfgang for his mother&#x27;s early death – not just immediately following the death in 1778 (&quot;a crushing reply to a young man grieving for his mother&quot;), but even later on in 1780.

Robert Spaethling, who translated Mozart&#x27;s letters, typically takes a position strongly sympathetic to Wolfgang in his struggles with his father; he describes Wolfgang&#x27;s resignation of his Salzburg position and marriage to Constanze as a two-act &quot;drama of liberation from Salzburg, specially Wolfgang&#x27;s liberation from Leopold Mozart&quot;.

<text>Joseph Satriani (born July 15, 1956) is an American rock guitarist, composer, and songwriter. Early in his career he worked as a guitar instructor, with many of his former students achieving fame, including Steve Vai, Larry LaLonde, Rick Hunolt, Kirk Hammett, Andy Timmons, Charlie Hunter, Kevin Cadogan, and Alex Skolnick. Satriani went on to have a successful solo music career, starting in the mid-1980s. He is a 15-time Grammy Award nominee and has sold over ten million albums, making him the bestselling instrumental rock guitarist of all time.

In 1988, Satriani was recruited by Mick Jagger as lead guitarist for his first solo tour. Satriani briefly toured with Deep Purple, joining shortly after another departure of Ritchie Blackmore from the band in November 1993. He has worked with a range of guitarists during the G3 tour, which he founded in 1995. Satriani has been the guitarist for the supergroup Chickenfoot since joining the band in 2008.

==Early life==
Satriani was born in Westbury, New York to a family of Italian descent. His paternal grandparents were from Piacenza and Bobbio, while his maternal grandparents were from Bari. He was raised Roman Catholic. He was inspired to play guitar at age 14, after hearing of the death of Jimi Hendrix. Satriani heard the news during football practice, where he then announced to his coach that he was quitting to become a guitarist.

Satriani graduated from Carle Place High School. In 1974, he studied music with jazz guitarist Billy Bauer and with reclusive jazz pianist Lennie Tristano. The technically demanding Tristano greatly influenced Satriani&#x27;s playing. He began teaching guitar, with his most notable student at the time being fellow Long Island native Steve Vai (who also went to Carle Place). While he was teaching Vai, he was attending Five Towns College for studies in music. In 1978, Satriani moved to Berkeley, California, to pursue a music career. Soon after, he resumed teaching. His students included Kirk Hammett of Metallica, David Bryson of Counting Crows, Kevin Cadogan from Third Eye Blind, Larry LaLonde of Primus and Possessed, Alex Skolnick of Testament, Rick Hunolt (ex-Exodus), Phil Kettner of Lȧȧz Rockit, Geoff Tyson of T-Ride, Charlie Hunter, and David Turin.

==Career==
===1980s–2000===
Satriani started playing in a San Francisco-based band called Squares, which he formed with his brother-in-law Neil Sheehan in the late 1970s. He was later invited to join the Greg Kihn Band, who were on the downside of their career, but whose generosity helped Satriani pay off the overwhelming credit card debt from recording his first album, &quot;Not of This Earth&quot;, released in 1986. The same year, he also sang backing vocals on the self-titled Crowded House album.

In 1987, Satriani&#x27;s second album, &quot;Surfing with the Alien&quot;, produced radio hits and was the first all-instrumental release to chart so highly in many years. The track &quot;Crushing Day&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of a low-budget film titled &quot;It Takes Two&quot;. In 1988, Satriani helped produce the EP &quot;The Eyes of Horror&quot; for the death metal band Possessed. That same year, he also released an EP titled &quot;Dreaming #11&quot;, which featured the song &quot;The Crush of Love&quot;. In 1989, Satriani released the album &quot;Flying in a Blue Dream&quot;. It was said to be inspired by the death of his father, who died in 1989 during the recording of the album. &quot;One Big Rush&quot; featured on the soundtrack to the Cameron Crowe movie &quot;Say Anything...&quot;. &quot;The Forgotten Part II&quot; was featured on a Molson Dry commercial in Canada in 1993. &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot; featured in a car chase sequence in the Don Johnson-starring show &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;. 

In 1992, Satriani released &quot;The Extremist&quot;, his most commercially successful album to date. The album was certified Gold in the United States and peaked at number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Radio stations across the US picked up &quot;Summer Song&quot;, which got a major boost when Sony used it in a major commercial campaign for their Discman portable CD players. &quot;Cryin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, and the title track were regional hits on radio. In late 1993, Satriani joined Deep Purple as a temporary replacement for departed guitarist Ritchie Blackmore during the band&#x27;s Japanese tour. The concerts were a success, and Satriani was asked to join the band permanently, but he declined, having just signed a multi-album solo deal with Sony, and Steve Morse took the guitarist slot in Deep Purple.

In 1996, Satriani founded G3, a concert tour intended to include a rotating trio of guitarists. The original lineup featured Satriani, Steve Vai, and Eric Johnson. The G3 tour has continued periodically since its inaugural version, with Satriani the only permanent member. Other guitarists who have performed in G3 include Yngwie Malmsteen, John Petrucci, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Robert Fripp, Andy Timmons, Uli Jon Roth, Michael Schenker, Adrian Legg, Paul Gilbert, Steve Morse, and Steve Lukather. In 1998, Satriani recorded and released &quot;Crystal Planet&quot;, followed by &quot;Engines of Creation&quot;, one of his more experimental works featuring the electronica genre. Two shows at the Fillmore West in San Francisco were recorded in December 2000 and released as &quot;Live in San Francisco&quot;, a two-disc live album and DVD.

===2000–present===
Satriani released &quot;Strange Beautiful Music&quot; in 2002 and &quot;Is There Love in Space?&quot; in 2004. In May 2005, the musician toured India for the first time, playing concerts in Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai. In 2006, he recorded and released &quot;Super Colossal&quot; and &quot;Satriani Live!&quot;, another two-disc live album and DVD recorded May 3, 2006, at the Grove in Anaheim, California. In 2006, Satriani signed on as an official supporter of Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit organization that provides free musical instruments and instruction to children in underserved public schools throughout the US. The artist has personally delivered instruments to children in the program through a charity raffle for the organization, and like Steve Vai, sits on its board of directors as an honorary member.

On August 7, 2007, Epic/Legacy Recordings re-released &quot;Surfing with the Alien&quot; to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its publication. This was a two-disc set that includes a remastered album and a DVD of a never-before-seen live show filmed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1988. Satriani&#x27;s next album, &quot;Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock&quot;, was released on April 1, 2008.

On May 29, 2008, Satriani revealed that he was joining hard rock supergroup Chickenfoot, composed of former Van Halen members Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony, and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith. They released their debut, self-titled album on June 5, 2009. A second album, titled &quot;Chickenfoot III&quot;, followed on September 27, 2011.

On December 4, 2008, he filed a copyright infringement suit against Coldplay in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Satriani&#x27;s suit claims that the band&#x27;s song &quot;Viva la Vida&quot; includes &quot;substantial original portions&quot; of the Satriani song &quot;If I Could Fly&quot; from his 2004 album, &quot;Is There Love in Space?&quot; The Coldplay song in question received two Grammy Awards. Coldplay denied the allegation. The case was dismissed in September 2009, with each party paying their own trial costs.
The artist released a live DVD recording of a concert in Paris titled &quot;Live in Paris: I Just Wanna Rock&quot; and a companion two-CD set on February 2, 2010. In March 2010, he participated with other guitarists in the Experience Hendrix Tribute Tour, performing music written and inspired by Jimi Hendrix.

In May 2010, Satriani announced he was about to enter the studio to record a new album, and dates were released for an autumn tour. He also said that demos had been recorded for a second Chickenfoot record. Satriani released his 13th studio album, &quot;Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards&quot;, on October 5, 2010.

He issued the DVD/Blu-ray of his three-dimensional concert film &quot;&quot; on April 24, 2012, after its limited showing in theaters. The film was shot in December 2010 in Montreal and was directed by award-winning filmmakers François and Pierre Lamoureux. &quot;Satchurated 3D&quot; is the first Blu-ray concert film available with Dolby TrueHD 7.1.

On May 7, 2013, Satriani released his 14th studio album, titled &quot;Unstoppable Momentum&quot;. A career retrospective box set titled &quot;Joe Satriani: The Complete Studio Recordings&quot;, which contains remastered editions of every studio album from &quot;Not of This Earth&quot; to &quot;Unstoppable Momentum&quot; was released on April 22, 2014. A book titled &quot;Strange Beautiful Music: A Memoir&quot; was also published, to coincide with the release of the box set.

In August 2014, Satriani participated in the G4 Experience—a weeklong guitar camp—with fellow guitarists Paul Gilbert and Andy Timmons, and keyboardist Mike Keneally.

In February 2015, the first dates were announced for the Shockwave World Tour, in support of Satriani&#x27;s 15th studio album, slated for release in July. &quot;Shockwave Supernova&quot; was released on July 24, 2015. The album was conceived after Satriani found himself playing guitar with his teeth a lot during the &quot;Unstoppable Momentum&quot; tour, and had a daydream about an alter ego, &quot;Shockwave Supernova&quot;, making him do it.

On September 16, 2017, Satriani teased his upcoming 16th studio album, &quot;What Happens Next&quot;, through social media. The album was released on January 12, 2018. He collaborated with former Deep Purple bassist Glenn Hughes and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, two Rock and Roll Hall of Fame members.

On April 5, 2019, the guitarist released an eponymous retrospective collection of songs he had recorded in the 1970s with his band Squares. The following April, he published his seventeenth solo album, &quot;Shapeshifting&quot;.

On January 19, 2022, Satriani released &quot;Sahara&quot; as the first single from his eighteenth album, &quot;The Elephants of Mars&quot;. The record was released on April 8, 2022, by earMUSIC, making it Satriani&#x27;s first since his 1995 self-titled album to be released by a label other than Epic Records or its parent company, Sony Music.

In late 2022, Satriani announced a continuation of his G3 touring project, under the title &quot;G4 Experience V6.0&quot;, which took place on January 3–7, 2023. The event was led by Satriani, together with Peter Frampton—among his final performances before retirement, Steve Lukather, and Steve Morse, and included workshops and jam sessions led by Alex Skolnick, Andy James, Cory Wong, Eric Gales, John 5, Mateus Asato, and Nili Brosh.

In early 2024, Satriani, Steve Vai, and Eric Johnson embarked on a limited-run &quot;Reunion&quot; tour of the original G3 lineup. Subsequently, Satriani and Vai continued touring as a double bill. After more than fifty years of professional and personal friendship, the pair wrote and recorded their first single together, &quot;The Sea of Emotion, Pt.1&quot;, which was released on March 29, 2024.

===Chickenfoot===
In May 2008, Satriani joined hard rock supergroup Chickenfoot, composed of former Van Halen members Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony, and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer, Chad Smith. The band features Hagar on vocals, Satriani on guitar, Anthony on bass, and Smith on drums. Their eponymous debut album was released on June 5, 2009. The first single and video released was the track &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;, which was played on &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; on June 5, 2009. Satriani received a co-writing credit on all the songs on the band&#x27;s debut album. &quot;Broken Records&quot; magazine asked Satriani about his new band, and he enthusiastically mentioned, &quot;it was great fun&quot; and it gives him a &quot;kick in the music bone&quot; to play with such great talent. He said it felt natural to step back and play more rhythm than solo guitar. Chickenfoot&#x27;s second album, &quot;Chickenfoot III&quot;, was released on September 27, 2011. The album&#x27;s first single was the track &quot;Bigfoot&quot;.

Satriani is credited on many other albums, including guitar duties on Alice Cooper&#x27;s 1991 album, &quot;Hey Stoopid&quot;, Spinal Tap&#x27;s 1992 album, &quot;Break Like the Wind&quot;, Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s 1988 album, &quot;Imaginos&quot;, and band members Stu Hamm and Gregg Bissonette&#x27;s solo records. He was credited with singing background vocals on the 1986 debut album by Crowded House. In 2003, he played lead guitar on The Yardbirds&#x27;s release &quot;Birdland&quot;. In 2006, he made appearances on tracks for Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan&#x27;s solo CD/DVD dual disc, &quot;Gillan&#x27;s Inn&quot;.

On Dream Theater&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;Systematic Chaos&quot;, Satriani contributed spoken lyrics to the song &quot;Repentance&quot;. He also contributed a guitar solo to Jordan Rudess&#x27; 2004 solo release, &quot;Rhythm of Time&quot;. He composed much of the soundtrack for the racing video game &quot;NASCAR 06: Total Team Control&quot;, while his song &quot;Crowd Chant&quot; was featured in &quot;NHL 2K10&quot; and &quot;Madden NFL 11&quot;. In 2009, he played two characters in season three of Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;.
Satriani has starred in several movies, including the 2006 Christopher Guest film &quot;For Your Consideration&quot;, as the guitarist in the band that played for the late-night show. He appeared as himself in the film &quot;Moneyball&quot;, playing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;.

The &quot;American Dad!&quot; episode &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Be Friends&quot; featured the song &quot;Always with Me, Always with You&quot;. The song was also sampled in the Nicki Minaj single &quot;Right Thru Me&quot;.

Satriani joined Chickenfoot in voicing themselves in the &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; episode &quot;IAMAPOD&quot;.

==Style and influence==
Satriani is considered a highly technical guitarist, and has been referred to as a top guitar virtuoso. He has mastered many playing techniques on electric guitar, including legato, two-handed tapping and arpeggio tapping, volume swells, harmonics, and extreme whammy bar effects. During fast passages, Satriani favors a legato technique (achieved primarily through hammer-ons and pull-offs) that yields smooth and flowing runs. He is also adept at other speed-related techniques such as rapid alternate picking and sweep picking.

Satriani was influenced by Jimi Hendrix and by English rock guitarists such as Brian May, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore, and Jeff Beck. He was also influenced by jazz fusion guitarist Allan Holdsworth.

==Equipment==
Satriani endorses Ibanez&#x27;s JS Series guitars and the Marshall JVM410HJS amplifier. Both lines were designed specifically for him as signature products. The Ibanez JS1 (the original JS model) was based on, and replaced, the Ibanez 540 Radius model that Satriani first endorsed. Many of his guitars are made by the company, including the JS1000 and JS1200. These guitars typically feature the DiMarzio PAF Pro (which he used up until 1993 in both the neck and bridge positions), the DiMarzio Fred (which he used in the bridge position from 1993 to 2005), and the Mo&#x27; Joe and the Paf Joe (which he has used in the bridge and neck positions from 2005 to the present). He has more recently introduced the Satch Track single-coil pickup that he used in his humbucker/single coil-equipped signature Ibanez guitars. He has since replaced the Satch Track with the Sustainiac.

The JS line of guitars is Satriani&#x27;s signature line, with the JS1000, JS1200, JS2400, JSBDG, and JS20th using Ibanez&#x27;s original Edge double-locking tremolo bridge. The JS100 and JS120s both use Ibanez&#x27;s Edge 3 tremolo bridge. The JS1600 is a fixed-bridge guitar with no tremolo system. The guitar he was most associated with during the 1990s was a chrome-finished guitar nicknamed &quot;Chrome Boy&quot;. This instrument can be seen on the &quot;Live in San Francisco&quot; DVD. However, the guitar used for most of the concert was in fact a lookalike nicknamed &quot;Pearly&quot;, which featured Seymour Duncan Pearly Gates pickups.

Satriani uses a number of other JS models, such as the JS double neck model, JS700 (primary axe on his self-titled CD, seen on the 1995 &quot;Joe Satriani&quot; tour, which features a fixed bridge, P-90 pickups, and a matching mahogany body and neck), JS6/JS6000 (natural body), JS1 (the original JS model), JS2000 (fixed-bridge model), a variety of JS100s, JS1000s and JS1200s with custom paint work, and a large number of prototype JSs. All double-locking bridges have been the original Edge tremolo, not the newer models, which point to a more custom guitar than the off-the-shelf models. Satriani played a red 7-string JS model, seen in the &quot;G3 Live in Tokyo&quot; DVD from 2005. He also has a prototype 24-fret version of the JS, now called the JS–2400, which he has used with Chickenfoot. He has also used other prototypes featuring a Sustainiac or a JS model with three single coil-sized humbucker pickups.

Satriani has used a wide variety of guitar amps, with Marshalls being his main amplifier (notably the limited-edition blue-colored 6100 LM model) up until 2001, and his Peavey signature series amps, the Peavey JSX, up until his time with Chickenfoot.

The JSX began life as a prototype Peavey XXX and developed into the Joe Satriani signature Peavey model. However, Satriani still used distortion pedals with the clean channel rather than the built-in overdrive channels. He has used other amplifiers over the years in the studio, such as the Peavey 5150 (used to record the song &quot;Crystal Planet&quot;), Cornford, and the Mesa/Boogie Mark IIC+ (used to record the song &quot;Flying in a Blue Dream&quot;), among others. He later switched to the Marshall JVM series, having used a modified JVM 410H in his &quot;Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards&quot; tour in 2010 and with Chickenfoot in 2010 and 2011.

These modified JVM Marshall amps were prototypes for a signature amp that Marshall scheduled for release in 2011. They replaced the reverb with noise gates that eliminate lag when switching channels. The clean channel was replaced by the clean channel of a 6100 LM model, which Satriani likes as an option to use distortion pedals with. The orange overdrive channel and the modern red overdrive channel have been better matched with each other as Satriani claims to prefer the organic overdrive of the JVM over pedals. The red overdrive channel was modified for a beefy rock rather than a nu metal sound. The effect loop has been simplified to be serial only.

Satriani has used many amps in the studio when recording, including the Peavey Classic. He used Marshall heads and cabinets, including live, prior to his Peavey endorsement. Recently, he used the JSX head through a Palmer Speaker Simulator. He has released a Class-A 5-watt tube amp called the &quot;Mini Colossal&quot;. In 2009, Satriani split from Peavey and returned to using Marshall amps. Live, he has been using a Marshall JVM410JS since 2009.

His effects pedals include the Vox wah, Dunlop Cry Baby wah, RMC Wizard wah, DigiTech Whammy, BK Butler Tube Driver, Boss DS-1, Boss CH-1, Boss CE-2, Boss DD-2 and a standard Boss DD-3 (used together to emulate reverb effects), Boss BF-3, Boss OC-2, Barber Burn Drive Unit, Fulltone Deja Vibe, Fulltone Ultimate Octave, and Electro-Harmonix POG (Polyphonic Octave Generator), the latter being featured prominently on the title cut to his 2006 &quot;Super Colossal&quot;. He has collaborated with Vox on a range of signature-effect stompboxes. These include the &quot;Satchurator&quot; and &quot;Ice 9&quot; distortions, the &quot;Time Machine&quot; delay, and the &quot;Big Bad Wah&quot;.

Satriani&#x27;s 2000 guitar rig has been documented in detail.

==Musical themes==
Satriani&#x27;s work frequently makes references to various science fiction stories and ideas. &quot;Surfing with the Alien&quot;, &quot;Back to Shalla-Bal&quot;, and &quot;The Power Cosmic 2000&quot; refer to the comic book character Silver Surfer, while &quot;Ice 9&quot; refers to the secret government ice weapon in Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;. &quot;Borg Sex&quot; is a reference to &quot;Star Trek&quot;, which features a cybernetic race known as the Borg. His albums and songs often have otherworldly titles, such as &quot;Not of this Earth&quot;, &quot;Crystal Planet&quot;, &quot;Is There Love in Space?&quot;, and &quot;Engines of Creation&quot;.

On the album &quot;Super Colossal&quot;, the song titled &quot;Crowd Chant&quot; was originally called &quot;Party on the Enterprise&quot;. It would have featured sampled sounds from the &quot;Starship Enterprise&quot; from &quot;Star Trek&quot;. But as Satriani explained in a podcast, legal issues regarding the samples could not be resolved, and he was unable to get permission to use them. He then removed the sounds from the song and called it &quot;Crowd Chant&quot;. Its ending theme was inspired by composer Gabriel Fauré&#x27;s &quot;Pavane in F-sharp minor, Op. 50&quot;. The song is used as goal celebration music for a number of National Hockey League and Major League Soccer teams, including the Minnesota Wild (NHL), New York Islanders (NHL), and New England Revolution (MLS). The song is also used in the 2K Sports hockey video game &quot;NHL 2k10&quot;.

&quot;Redshift Riders&quot;, another song from &quot;Super Colossal&quot;, is &quot;...based on the idea that in the future, when people can travel throughout space, they will theoretically take advantage of the cosmological redshift effect so they can be swung around large planetary objects and get across [the] universe a lot faster than normal&quot;, according to Satriani. On the album &quot;Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock&quot;, the song &quot;I Just Wanna Rock&quot; is about a giant robot on the run who happens to stumble upon a rock concert.

<text>In computer science, a compiler-compiler or compiler generator is a programming tool that creates a parser, interpreter, or compiler from some form of formal description of a programming language and machine.

The most common type of compiler-compiler is called a parser generator. It handles only syntactic analysis.

A formal description of a language is usually a grammar used as an input to a parser generator. It often resembles Backus–Naur form (BNF), extended Backus–Naur form (EBNF), or has its own syntax. Grammar files describe a syntax of a generated compiler&#x27;s target programming language and actions that should be taken against its specific constructs.

Source code for a parser of the programming language is returned as the parser generator&#x27;s output. This source code can then be compiled into a parser, which may be either standalone or embedded. The compiled parser then accepts the source code of the target programming language as an input and performs an action or outputs an abstract syntax tree (AST).

Parser generators do not handle the semantics of the AST, or the generation of machine code for the target machine.

A metacompiler is a software development tool used mainly in the construction of compilers, translators, and interpreters for other programming languages. The input to a metacompiler is a computer program written in a specialized programming metalanguage designed mainly for the purpose of constructing compilers. The language of the compiler produced is called the object language. The minimal input producing a compiler is a metaprogram specifying the object language grammar and semantic transformations into an object program.

== Variants ==
A typical parser generator associates executable code with each of the rules of the grammar that should be executed when these rules are applied by the parser. These pieces of code are sometimes referred to as semantic action routines since they define the semantics of the syntactic structure that is analyzed by the parser. Depending upon the type of parser that should be generated, these routines may construct a parse tree (or abstract syntax tree), or generate executable code directly.

One of the earliest (1964), surprisingly powerful, versions of compiler-compilers is META II, which accepted an analytical grammar with output facilities that produce stack machine code, and is able to compile its own source code and other languages.

Among the earliest programs of the original Unix versions being built at Bell Labs was the two-part lex and yacc system, which was normally used to output C programming language code, but had a flexible output system that could be used for everything from programming languages to text file conversion. Their modern GNU versions are flex and bison.

Some experimental compiler-compilers take as input a formal description of programming language semantics, typically using denotational semantics. This approach is often called &#x27;semantics-based compiling&#x27;, and was pioneered by Peter Mosses&#x27; Semantic Implementation System (SIS) in 1978. However, both the generated compiler and the code it produced were inefficient in time and space. No production compilers are currently built in this way, but research continues.

The Production Quality Compiler-Compiler (PQCC) project at Carnegie Mellon University does not formalize semantics, but does have a semi-formal framework for machine description.

Compiler-compilers exist in many flavors, including bottom-up rewrite machine generators (see JBurg) used to tile syntax trees according to a rewrite grammar for code generation, and attribute grammar parser generators (e.g. ANTLR can be used for simultaneous type checking, constant propagation, and more during the parsing stage).

===Metacompilers===
As a metacompiler&#x27;s metalanguage will usually be a powerful string and symbol processing language, they often have strong applications for general-purpose applications, including generating a wide range of other software engineering and analysis tools.

Besides being useful for domain-specific language development, a metacompiler is a prime example of a domain-specific language, designed for the domain of compiler writing.

A metacompiler is a metaprogram &quot;usually written in its own metalanguage&quot; or an existing computer programming language. The process of a metacompiler, written in its own metalanguage, compiling itself is equivalent to self-hosting compiler. Most common compilers written today are self-hosting compilers. Self-hosting is a powerful tool, of many metacompilers, allowing the easy extension of their own metaprogramming metalanguage. The feature that separates a metacompiler apart from other compiler compilers is that it takes as input a specialized metaprogramming language that describes all aspects of the compiler&#x27;s operation. A metaprogram produced by a metacompiler is as complete a program as a program written in C++, BASIC or any other general programming language. The metaprogramming metalanguage is a powerful attribute allowing easier development of computer programming languages and other computer tools. Command line processors, text string transforming and analysis are easily coded using metaprogramming metalanguages of metacompilers.

A full featured development package includes a linker and a run time support library. Usually, a machine-oriented system programming language, such as C or C++, is needed to write the support library. A library consisting of support functions needed for the compiling process usually completes the full metacompiler package.

====The meaning of metacompiler====
In computer science, the prefix &quot;meta&quot; is commonly used to mean &quot;about (its own category)&quot;. For example, metadata are data that describe other data. A language that is used to describe other languages is a metalanguage. Meta may also mean &quot;on a higher level of abstraction&quot;. A metalanguage operates on a higher level of abstraction in order to describe properties of a language. Backus–Naur form (BNF) is a formal metalanguage originally used to define ALGOL 60. BNF is a weak metalanguage, for it describes only the syntax and says nothing about the semantics or meaning. Metaprogramming is the writing of computer programs with the ability to treat programs as their data. A metacompiler takes as input a metaprogram written in a specialized metalanguages (a higher level abstraction) specifically designed for the purpose of metaprogramming. The output is an executable object program.

An analogy can be drawn: That as a &quot;C++&quot; compiler takes as input a &quot;C++&quot; programming language program, a &quot;meta&quot;compiler takes as input a &quot;meta&quot;programming metalanguage program.

===Forth metacompiler===

Many advocates of the language Forth call the process of creating a new implementation of Forth a meta-compilation and that it constitutes a metacompiler. The Forth definition of metacompiler is:
:&quot;A metacompiler is a compiler which processes its own source code, resulting in an executable version of itself.&quot;
This Forth use of the term metacompiler is disputed in mainstream computer science. See Forth (programming language) and History of compiler construction. The actual Forth process of compiling itself is a combination of a Forth being a self-hosting extensible programming language and sometimes cross compilation, long established terminology in computer science. Metacompilers are a general compiler writing system. Besides the Forth metacompiler concept being indistinguishable from self-hosting and extensible language. The actual process acts at a lower level defining a minimum subset of forth &quot;words&quot;, that can be used to define additional forth words, A full Forth implementation can then be defined from the base set. This sounds like a bootstrap process. The problem is that almost every general purpose language compiler also fits the Forth metacompiler description.
: When (self-hosting compiler) X processes its own source code, resulting in an executable version of itself, X is a metacompiler.
Just replace X with any common language, C, C++, Pascal, COBOL, Fortran, Ada, Modula-2, etc. And X would be a metacompiler according to the Forth usage of metacompiler. A metacompiler operates at an abstraction level above the compiler it compiles. It only operates at the same (self-hosting compiler) level when compiling itself. One has to see the problem with this definition of metacompiler. It can be applied to most any language.

However, on examining the concept of programming in Forth, adding new words to the dictionary, extending the language in this way is metaprogramming. It is this metaprogramming in Forth that makes it a metacompiler.

Programming in Forth is adding new words to the language. Changing the language in this way is metaprogramming. Forth is a metacompiler, because Forth is a language specifically designed for metaprogramming. Programming in Forth is extending Forth adding words to the Forth vocabulary creates a new Forth dialect. Forth is a specialized metacompiler for Forth language dialects.

==History==
Design of the original compiler-compiler was started by Tony Brooker and Derrick Morris in 1959, with initial testing beginning in March 1962. The Brooker Morris Compiler Compiler (BMCC) was used to create compilers for the new Atlas computer at the University of Manchester, for several languages: Mercury Autocode, Extended Mercury Autocode, Atlas Autocode, ALGOL 60 and ASA Fortran. At roughly the same time, related work was being done by E. T. (Ned) Irons at Princeton, and Alick Glennie at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston whose &quot;Syntax Machine&quot; paper (declassified in 1977) inspired the META series of translator writing systems mentioned below.

The early history of metacompilers is closely tied with the history of SIG/PLAN Working group 1 on Syntax Driven Compilers. The group was started primarily through the effort of Howard Metcalfe in the Los Angeles area. In the fall of 1962, Howard Metcalfe designed two compiler-writing interpreters. One used a bottom-to-top analysis technique based on a method described by Ledley and Wilson. The other used a top-to-bottom approach based on work by Glennie to generate random English sentences from a context-free grammar.

At the same time, Val Schorre described two &quot;meta machines&quot;, one generative and one analytic. The generative machine was implemented and produced random algebraic expressions. Meta I the first metacompiler was implemented by Schorre on an IBM 1401 at UCLA in January 1963. His original interpreters and metamachines were written directly in a pseudo-machine language. META II, however, was written in a higher-level metalanguage able to describe its own compilation into the pseudo-machine language.

Lee Schmidt at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman wrote a metacompiler in March 1963 that utilized a CRT display on the time-sharing PDP-l. This compiler produced actual machine code rather than interpretive code and was partially bootstrapped from Meta I.

Schorre bootstrapped Meta II from Meta I during the spring of 1963. The paper on the refined metacompiler system presented at the 1964 Philadelphia ACM conference is the first paper on a metacompiler available as a general reference. The syntax and implementation technique of Schorre&#x27;s system laid the foundation for most of the systems that followed. The system was implemented on a small 1401, and was used to implement a small ALGOL-like language.

Many similar systems immediately followed.

Roger Rutman of AC Delco developed and implemented LOGIK, a language for logical design simulation, on the IBM 7090 in January 1964. This compiler used an algorithm that produced efficient code for Boolean expressions.

Another paper in the 1964 ACM proceedings describes Meta III, developed by Schneider and Johnson at UCLA for the IBM 7090. Meta III represents an attempt to produce efficient machine code, for a large class of languages. Meta III was implemented completely in assembly language. Two compilers were written in Meta III, CODOL, a compiler-writing demonstration compiler, and PUREGOL, a dialect of ALGOL 60. (It was pure gall to call it ALGOL).

Late in 1964, Lee Schmidt bootstrapped the metacompiler EQGEN, from the PDP-l to the Beckman 420. EQGEN was a logic equation generating language.

In 1964, System Development Corporation began a major effort in the development of metacompilers. This effort includes powerful metacompilers, Bookl, and Book2 written in Lisp which have extensive tree-searching and backup ability. An outgrowth of one of the Q-32 systems at SDC is Meta 5. The Meta 5 system incorporates backup of the input stream and enough other facilities to parse any context-sensitive language. This system was successfully released to a wide number of users and had many string-manipulation applications other than compiling. It has many elaborate push-down stacks, attribute setting and testing facilities, and output mechanisms. That Meta 5 successfully translates JOVIAL programs to PL/I programs demonstrates its power and flexibility.

Robert McClure at Texas Instruments invented a compiler-compiler called TMG (presented in 1965). TMG was used to create early compilers for programming languages like B, PL/I and ALTRAN. Together with metacompiler of Val Schorre, it was an early inspiration for the last chapter of Donald Knuth&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;.

The LOT system was developed during 1966 at Stanford Research Institute and was modeled very closely after Meta II. It had new special-purpose constructs allowing it to generate a compiler which could in turn, compile a subset of PL/I. This system had extensive statistic-gathering facilities and was used to study the characteristics of top-down analysis.

SIMPLE is a specialized translator system designed to aid the writing of pre-processors for PL/I, SIMPLE, written in PL/I, is composed of three components: An executive, a syntax analyzer and a semantic constructor.

The TREE-META compiler was developed at Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park, California. April 1968. The early metacompiler history is well documented in the TREE META manual. TREE META paralleled some of the SDC developments. Unlike earlier metacompilers it separated the semantics processing from the syntax processing. The syntax rules contained tree building operations that combined recognized language elements with tree nodes. The tree structure representation of the input was then processed by a simple form of unparse rules. The unparse rules used node recognition and attribute testing that when matched resulted in the associated action being performed. In addition like tree element could also be tested in an unparse rule. Unparse rules were also a recursive language being able to call unparse rules passing elements of thee tree before the action of the unparse rule was performed.

The concept of the metamachine originally put forth by Glennie is so simple that three hardware versions have been designed and one actually implemented. The latter at Washington University in St. Louis. This machine was built from macro-modular components and has for instructions the codes described by Schorre.

CWIC (Compiler for Writing and Implementing Compilers) is the last known Schorre metacompiler. It was developed at Systems Development Corporation by Erwin Book, Dewey Val Schorre and Steven J. Sherman With the full power of (lisp 2) a list processing language optimizing algorithms could operate on syntax generated lists and trees before code generation. CWIC also had a symbol table built into the language.

With the resurgence of domain-specific languages and the need for parser generators which are easy to use, easy to understand, and easy to maintain, metacompilers are becoming a valuable tool for advanced software engineering projects.

Other examples of parser generators in the yacc vein are ANTLR, Coco/R, CUP, GNU Bison, Eli, FSL, SableCC, SID (Syntax Improving Device), and JavaCC. While useful, pure parser generators only address the parsing part of the problem of building a compiler. Tools with broader scope, such as PQCC, Coco/R and DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit provide considerable support for more difficult post-parsing activities such as semantic analysis, code optimization and generation.

==Schorre metalanguages==
The earliest Schorre metacompilers, META I and META II, were developed by D. Val Schorre at UCLA. Other Schorre based metacompilers followed. Each adding improvements to language analysis and/or code generation.

In programming it is common to use the programming language name to refer to both the compiler and the programming language, the context distinguishing the meaning. A C++ program is compiled using a C++ compiler. That also applies in the following. For example, META II is both the compiler and the language.
The metalanguages in the Schorre line of metacompilers are functional programming languages that use top down grammar analyzing syntax equations having embedded output transformation constructs.

A syntax equation:

is a compiled &quot;test&quot; function returning &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot;. &lt;name&gt; is the function name. &lt;body&gt; is a form of logical expression consisting of tests that may be grouped, have alternates, and output productions. A &quot;test&quot; is like a &quot;bool&quot; in other languages, &quot;success&quot; being &quot;true&quot; and &quot;failure&quot; being &quot;false&quot;.

Defining a programming language analytically top down is natural. For example, a program could be defined as:

Defining a program as a sequence of zero or more declaration(s).

In the Schorre META X languages there is a driving rule. The program rule above is an example of a driving rule. The program rule is a &quot;test&quot; function that calls declaration, a &quot;test&quot; rule, that returns &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot;. The $ loop operator repeatedly calling declaration until &quot;failure&quot; is returned. The $ operator is always successful, even when there are zero declaration. Above program would always return success. (In CWIC a long fail can bypass declaration. A long-fail is part of the backtracking system of CWIC)

The character sets of these early compilers were limited. The character / was used for the alternant (or) operator. &quot;A or B&quot; is written as A / B. Parentheses ( ) are used for grouping.
 A (B / C)
Describes a construct of A followed by B or C. As a boolean expression it would be
 A &quot;and&quot; (B &quot;or&quot; C)
A sequence X Y has an implied X and Y meaning. ( ) are grouping and / the or operator. The order of evaluation is always left to right as an input character sequence is being specified by the ordering of the tests.

Special operator words whose first character is a &quot;.&quot; are used for clarity. .EMPTY is used as the last alternate when no previous alternant need be present.
 X (A / B / .EMPTY)
Indicates that X is optionally followed by A or B. This is a specific characteristic of these metalanguages being programming languages. Backtracking is avoided by the above. Other compiler constructor systems may have declared the three possible sequences and left it up to the parser to figure it out.

The characteristics of the metaprogramming metalanguages above are common to all Schorre metacompilers and those derived from them.

===META I===
META I was a hand compiled metacompiler used to compile META II. Little else is known of META I except that the initial compilation of META II produced nearly identical code to that of the hand coded META I compiler.

===META II===

Each rule consists optionally of tests, operators, and output productions. A rule attempts to match some part of the input program source character stream returning success or failure. On success the input is advanced over matched characters. On failure the input is not advanced.

Output productions produced a form of assembly code directly from a syntax rule.

===TREE-META===
TREE-META introduced tree building operators :&lt;&quot;node_name&quot;&gt; and [&lt;&quot;number&quot;&gt;] moving the output production transforms to unparsed rules. The tree building operators were used in the grammar rules directly transforming the input into an abstract syntax tree. Unparse rules are also test functions that matched tree patterns. Unparse rules are called from a grammar rule when an abstract syntax tree is to be transformed into output code. The building of an abstract syntax tree and unparse rules allowed local optimizations to be performed by analyzing the parse tree.

Moving of output productions to the unparse rules made a clear separation of grammar analysis and code production. This made the programming easier to read and understand.

===CWIC===
In 1968–1970, Erwin Book, Dewey Val Schorre, and Steven J. Sherman developed CWIC. (Compiler for Writing and Implementing Compilers) at System Development Corporation Charles Babbage Institute Center for the History of Information Technology (Box 12, folder 21),

CWIC is a compiler development system composed of three special-purpose, domain specific, languages, each intended to permit the description of certain aspects of translation in a straight forward manner. The syntax language is used to describe the recognition of source text and the construction from it to an intermediate tree structure. The generator language is used to describe the transformation of the tree into appropriate object language.

The syntax language follows Dewey Val Schorre&#x27;s previous line of metacompilers. It most resembles TREE-META having tree building operators in the syntax language. The unparse rules of TREE-META are extended to work with the object based generator language based on LISP 2.

CWIC includes three languages:
* Syntax: Transforms the source program input, into list structures using grammar transformation formula. A parsed expression structure is passed to a generator by placement of a generator call in a rule. A tree is represented by a list whose first element is a node object. The language has operators, &lt; and &gt;, specifically for making lists. The colon : operator is used to create node objects. :ADD creates an ADD node. The exclamation ! operator combines a number of parsed entries with a node to make a tree. Trees created by syntax rules are passed to generator functions, returning success or failure. The syntax language is very close to TREE-META. Both use a colon to create a node. CWIC&#x27;s tree building exclamation !&lt;number&gt; functions the same as TREE-META&#x27;s [&lt;number&gt;]. 
* Generator: a named series of transforming rules, each consisting of an unparse, pattern matching, rule. and an output production written in a LISP 2 like language. the translation was to IBM 360 binary machine code. Other facilities of the generator language generalized output.
* MOL-360: an independent mid level implementation language for the IBM System/360 family of computers developed in 1968 and used for writing the underlying support library.

==== Generators language ====
Generators Language had semantics similar to Lisp. The parse tree was thought of as a recursive list. The general form of a Generator Language function is:

The code to process a given tree included the features of a general purpose programming language, plus a form: &lt;stuff&gt;, which would emit (stuff) onto the output file. 
A generator call may be used in the unparse_rule. The generator is passed the element of unparse_rule pattern in which it is placed and its return values are listed in (). For example:

That is, if the parse tree looks like (ADD[&lt;something1&gt;,&lt;something2&gt;]), expr_gen(x) would be called with &lt;something1&gt; and return x. A variable in the unparse rule is a local variable that can be used in the production_code_generator. expr_gen(y) is called with &lt;something2&gt; and returns y. Here is a generator call in an unparse rule is passed the element in the position it occupies. Hopefully in the above x and y will be registers on return. The last transforms is intended to load an atomic into a register and return the register. The first production would be used to generate the 360 &quot;AR&quot; (Add Register) instruction with the appropriate values in general registers. The above example is only a part of a generator. Every generator expression evaluates to a value that con then be further processed. The last transform could just as well have been written as:

In this case load returns its first parameter, the register returned by getreg(). the functions load and getreg are other CWIC generators.

==== CWIC addressed domain-specific languages before the term domain-specific language existed ====
From the authors of CWIC:
&quot;A metacompiler assists the task of compiler-building by automating its non creative aspects, those aspects that are the same regardless of the language which the produced compiler is to translate. This makes possible the design of languages which are appropriate to the specification of a particular problem. It reduces the cost of producing processors for such languages to a point where it becomes economically feasible to begin the solution of a problem with language design.&quot;

<doc id="70101" wikidata="Q863259" url="?curid=70101" title="National Rifle Association">
<text>The National Rifle Association of America (NRA of America) is a gun rights advocacy group based in the United States. Founded in 1871 to advance rifle marksmanship, the modern NRA has become a prominent gun rights lobbying organization while continuing to teach firearm safety and competency. The organization also publishes several magazines and sponsors competitive marksmanship events. The group claimed nearly 5 million members though that figure has not been independently confirmed.

The NRA is among the most influential advocacy groups in U.S. politics. The NRA Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) is its lobbying division, which manages its political action committee (PAC), the Political Victory Fund (PVF). Over its history, the organization has influenced legislation, participated in or initiated lawsuits, and endorsed or opposed various candidates at local, state, and federal levels. Some notable lobbying efforts by the NRA-ILA are the Firearm Owners Protection Act, which lessened restrictions of the Gun Control Act of 1968, and the Dickey Amendment, which blocks the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from using federal funds to advocate for gun control.

Starting in the mid- to late 1970s, the NRA has been increasingly criticized by gun control and gun rights advocacy groups, political commentators, and politicians. This criticism began following changes in the NRA&#x27;s organizational policies, following what is now referred to as the Revolt at Cincinnati at the 1977 NRA annual convention. The changes, which deposed former NRA executive vice president Maxwell Rich and included new organizational bylaws, have been described as moving the organization away from its previous focuses of &quot;hunting, conservation, and marksmanship&quot; and toward a focus on the defense of the right to bear arms. The organization has been the focus of intense criticism in the aftermath of high-profile shootings, such as the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and the Parkland High School shooting, after both of which they suggested adding armed security guards to schools.

==History==
===Early history===

A few months after the Civil War began in 1861, a national rifle association was proposed by Americans in England. In a letter that was sent to President Abraham Lincoln and published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, R.G. Moulton and R.B. Perry recommended forming an organization similar to the National Rifle Association in Britain, which had formed a year and a half earlier. They suggested making a shooting range, perhaps on the base on Staten Island, and were offering Whitworth rifles for prizes for the first shooting competition with those rifles. They suggested a provisional committee to start the Association which would include: President Lincoln, Secretary of War, officers, and other prominent New Yorkers.

The &quot;National Rifle Association of America&quot; was chartered in the State of New York on November 17, 1871 by &quot;Army and Navy Journal&quot; editor William Conant Church and Captain George Wood Wingate. On November 25, 1871, the group voted to elect its first corporate officers. Union Army Civil War General Ambrose Burnside, who had worked as a Rhode Island gunsmith, was elected president. When Burnside resigned on August 1, 1872, Church succeeded him as president.

Union Army records for the Civil War indicate that its troops fired about 1,000 rifle shots for each Confederate hit, causing General Burnside to lament his recruits: &quot;Out of ten soldiers who are perfect in drill and the manual of arms, only one knows the purpose of the sights on his gun or can hit the broad side of a barn.&quot; The generals attributed this to the use of volley tactics, devised for earlier, less accurate smoothbore muskets.
Recognizing a need for better training, Wingate sent emissaries to Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany to observe militia and armies&#x27; marksmanship training programs. With plans provided by Wingate, the New York Legislature funded the construction of a modern range at Creedmoor, Long Island, for long-range shooting competitions. The range officially opened on June 21, 1873. The Central Railroad of Long Island established a railway station nearby, with trains running from Hunter&#x27;s Point, with connecting boat service to 34th Street and the East River, allowing access from New York City. 

After beating England and Scotland to win the Elcho Shield in 1873 at Wimbledon, then a village outside London, the Irish Rifle Team issued a challenge through the &quot;New York Herald&quot; to riflemen of the United States to raise a team for a long-range match to determine an Irish-American championship. A team was organized through the subsidiary &quot;Amateur Club of New York City&quot;. Remington Arms and Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company produced breech-loading weapons for the team. Although muzzle-loading rifles had long been considered more accurate, eight American riflemen won the 1874 Irish-American Match firing breech-loading rifles. Publicity of the event generated by the &quot;New York Herald&quot; helped to establish breech-loading firearms as suitable for military marksmanship training, and promoted the NRA to national prominence.

In 1875, the NRA issued a challenge for an international rifle match as part of the 1876 Centennial celebrations of the founding of the nation. Australia, Ireland, Scotland and Canada accepted the challenge, and the Centennial Trophy was commissioned from Tiffany &amp; Co. (later known as the &quot;Palma Trophy&quot;). The United States won the 1876 match, and the Palma Match went on to be contested every four years as the World Long Range Rifle Championships.

====Rifle clubs====

The NRA organized rifle clubs in other states, and many state National Guard organizations sought NRA advice to improve members&#x27; marksmanship. Wingate&#x27;s marksmanship manual evolved into the United States Army marksmanship instruction program. Former President Ulysses S. Grant served as the NRA&#x27;s eighth president and General Philip H. Sheridan as its ninth. The US Congress created the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice in 1901 to include representatives from the NRA, National Guard, and United States military services. A program of annual rifle and pistol competitions was authorized, and included a national match open to military and civilian shooters. In 1907, NRA headquarters moved to Washington, D.C. to facilitate the organization&#x27;s advocacy efforts. Springfield Armory and Rock Island Arsenal began the manufacture of M1903 Springfield rifles for civilian members of the NRA in 1910. The Director of Civilian Marksmanship began manufacture of M1911 pistols for NRA members in August 1912. Until 1927, the United States Department of War provided free ammunition and targets to civilian rifle clubs with a minimum membership of ten United States citizens at least 16 years of age.

===1934–1970s===
After the passage of the National Firearms Act (NFA) of 1934, the first federal gun-control law in the US, the NRA formed its Legislative Affairs Division to update members with facts and analysis of upcoming bills. Karl Frederick, NRA president in 1934, during congressional NFA hearings testified &quot;I have never believed in the general practice of carrying weapons. I seldom carry one. I have when I felt it was desirable to do so for my own protection. I know that applies in most of the instances where guns are used effectively in self-defense or in places of business and in the home. I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns. I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses.&quot; Four years later, the NRA backed the Federal Firearms Act of 1938.

The NRA supported the NFA along with the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), which together created a system to federally license gun dealers and established restrictions on particular categories and classes of firearms. The organization opposed a national firearms registry, an initiative favored by then-President Lyndon Johnson.

===1970s–2000s===
Until the 1970s, the NRA was nonpartisan. Previously, the NRA mainly focused on sportsmen, hunters, and target shooters. During the 1970s, it became increasingly aligned with the Republican Party. After 1977, the organization expanded its membership by focusing heavily on political issues and forming coalitions with conservative politicians. Most of these are Republicans.

However, the passage of the GCA galvanized a growing number of NRA gun rights activists, including Harlon Carter. In 1975, it began to focus more on politics and established its lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA), with Carter as director. The next year, its political action committee (PAC), the Political Victory Fund, was created in time for the 1976 elections. The 1977 annual convention was a defining moment for the organization and came to be known as &quot;The Cincinnati Revolution&quot; (or as the Cincinnati Coup, the Cincinnati Revolt, or the Revolt at Cincinnati). Leadership planned to relocate NRA headquarters to Colorado and to build a $30 million recreational facility in New Mexico, but activists within the organization, whose central concern was Second Amendment rights, defeated the incumbents (i.e. Maxwell Rich) and elected Carter as executive director and Neal Knox as head of the NRA-ILA. Insurgents including Carter and Knox had demanded new leadership in part because they blamed incumbent leaders for existing gun control legislation like the GCA and believed that no compromise should be made.

With a goal to weaken the GCA, Knox&#x27;s ILA successfully lobbied Congress to pass the Firearm Owners Protection Act (FOPA) of 1986 and worked to reduce the powers of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). In 1982, Knox was ousted as director of the ILA, but began mobilizing outside the NRA framework and continued to promote opposition to gun control laws.

At the 1991 national convention, Knox&#x27;s supporters were elected to the board and named staff lobbyist Wayne LaPierre as the executive vice president. The NRA focused its attention on the gun control policies of the Clinton Administration. Knox again lost power in 1997, as he lost reelection to a coalition of moderate leaders who supported movie star Charlton Heston, despite Heston&#x27;s past support of gun control legislation.

In 1994, the NRA unsuccessfully opposed the Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB), but successfully lobbied for the ban&#x27;s 2004 expiration. Heston was elected president in 1998 and became a highly visible spokesman for the organization. In an effort to improve the NRA&#x27;s image, Heston presented himself as the voice of reason in contrast to Knox.

===2018–present===
====Ackerman McQueen lawsuit====
In April 2019, the group unexpectedly sued its longtime public relations firm Ackerman McQueen, which was responsible for two decades of aggressive gun-rights advertising on behalf of the NRA. The lawsuit alleges that the firm refused to turn over financial records to support its billings to the NRA, which amounted to $40 million in 2017. The lawsuit questioned recent programming on NRATV, an online channel operated by Ackerman, which has taken political positions unrelated to the NRA&#x27;s traditional focus on gun-related issues. There were also concerns about possible conflicts of interest, such as the $1 million contract to host NRATV between Ackerman and NRA president Oliver North. Leading up to the NRA&#x27;s 2019 national convention in April, there were reports that North and LaPierre were at odds, with North demanding that LaPierre resign and LaPierre accusing North of extortion. At the convention a letter was read from North, saying he had been told he would not be granted a second term as NRA president and adding that he intended to create a committee to investigate allegations of financial mismanagement. A subsequent resolution to oust LaPierre over &quot;highly suspect&quot; financial practices was hotly debated for an hour before members voted not to discuss financial issues in public and to refer the resolution to the NRA board. On June 25, 2019, the NRA severed all ties with Ackerman McQueen and shut down the NRATV operation.

==2024 New York State corruption verdict; 2021 bankruptcy filing==
Following an 18-month investigation, on August 6, 2020, New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a civil lawsuit against the NRA, alleging fraud, financial misconduct, and misuse of charitable funds by some of its executives, including its long-time former CEO and EVP Wayne LaPierre, treasurer Wilson Phillips, former chief of staff and current executive director of general operations Joshua Powell, and general counsel and secretary John Frazer. The suit called for the dissolution of the NRA as being &quot;fraught with fraud and abuse&quot;. On the same date, Attorney General for the District of Columbia Karl Racine filed a lawsuit against the NRA for misusing charitable funds.

On January 15, 2021, the NRA announced in a press release that it and one of its subsidiaries had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas in Dallas. It also announced that it would reincorporate in Texas, subject to court approval, although its headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia, would not move. During the bankruptcy trial LaPierre stated that he had kept the bankruptcy filing secret from the NRA&#x27;s board of directors and most of its senior officials. LaPierre&#x27;s spending of NRA funds on himself and his wife, such as upscale suits, chartered jet flights, and a traveling &quot;glam squad&quot; for his wife, became a subject of testimony in the eleven-day Texas proceedings.

On May 11, 2021, Judge Harlin Hale of the federal bankruptcy court of the Northern District of Texas, dismissed the bankruptcy petition without prejudice, describing that it &quot;was not filed in good faith&quot;, warning that if the NRA chose to file a new bankruptcy case, Hale&#x27;s court would immediately revisit concerns about &quot;disclosure, transparency, secrecy, conflicts of interest of litigation counsel&quot;, which could lead to the appointment of a trustee to oversee the organization&#x27;s affairs. Hale doubted that the NRA was &quot;faced with financial difficulties&quot;, instead ruling that the true purposes of the lawsuit were &quot;to gain an unfair litigation advantage&quot; against the New York Attorney General, and to &quot;avoid&quot; regulation from New York.

On March 2, 2022, New York state court in Manhattan ruled against Letitia James&#x27;s effort to break up the NRA while allowing the portion of the legal actions against the NRA&#x27;s leadership to continue. The judge found that dissolving the NRA would have a negative impact on the free speech and assembly rights of the organization&#x27;s members. It was also found that the NRA as an organization did not benefit from the alleged misconduct of its leadership and &quot;less intrusive&quot; remedies against NRA officials could be sought instead.

In February 2024, NRA leaders were found guilty of financial misconduct and corruption by a Manhattan jury.

==Lobbying and political activity==

When the National Rifle Association of America was officially incorporated on November 16, 1871, its primary goal was to &quot;promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis&quot;. The NRA&#x27;s website says the organization is &quot;America&#x27;s longest-standing civil rights organization&quot;.

On February 7, 1872, the NRA created a committee to lobby for legislation in the interest of the organization. Its first lobbying effort was to petition the New York State legislature for $25,000 to purchase land to set up a range. Within three months, the legislation had passed and had been signed into law by Governor John T. Hoffman.

In 1934, the National Rifle Association created a Legislative Affairs Division and testified in front of Congress in support of the first substantial federal gun control legislation in the US, the National Firearms Act.

The Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA), the lobbying branch of the NRA, was established in 1975. According to political scientists John M. Bruce and Clyde Wilcox, the NRA shifted its focus in the late 1970s to incorporate political advocacy, and started seeing its members as political resources rather than just as recipients of goods and services. Despite the impact on the volatility of membership, the politicization of the NRA has been consistent and its PAC, the Political Victory Fund established in 1976, ranked as &quot;one of the biggest spenders in congressional elections&quot; as of 1998.

A 1999 &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine survey said that lawmakers and their staffers considered the NRA the most powerful lobbying organization three years in a row. Chris W. Cox was the NRA&#x27;s chief lobbyist and principal political strategist, a position he held from 2002 until 2019. In 2012, 88% of Republicans and 11% of Democrats in Congress had received an NRA PAC contribution at some point in their career. Of the members of the Congress that convened in 2013, 51% received funding from the NRA PAC within their political careers, and 47% received NRA money in their most recent race. According to Lee Drutman, political scientist and senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation, &quot;It is important to note that these contributions are probably a better measure of allegiance than of influence.&quot;

Internationally, the NRA opposes the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). It has opposed Canadian gun registry, supported Brazilian gun rights, and criticized Australian gun laws.

In 2016, the NRA raised a record $366 million and spent $412 million for political activities. The NRA also maintains a PAC which is excluded from these figures. The organization donated to congressional races for both Republicans (223) and Democrats (9) to candidates for Congress.

The NRA has been described as influential in shaping American gun control policy. The organization influences legislators&#x27; voting behavior through its financial resources and ability to mobilize its large membership. The organization has not lost a major battle over gun control legislation since the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban. At the federal level, the NRA successfully lobbied Congress in the mid-1990s to effectively halt governments-sponsored research into the public health effects of firearms, and to ensure the passage of legislation in 2005 largely immunizing gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits. At the same time, the NRA stopped efforts at the federal level to increase regulation of firearms. At the state and local level, the NRA successfully campaigned to deregulate guns, for example by pushing state governments to eliminate the ability of local governments to regulate guns and removing restrictions on guns in public places (such as bars and campuses).

===Elections===

The NRA Political Victory Fund (PVF) PAC was established in 1976 to challenge gun-control candidates and to support gun-rights candidates. An NRA &quot;A+&quot; candidate is one who has &quot;not only an excellent voting record on all critical NRA issues, but who has also made a vigorous effort to promote and defend the Second Amendment&quot;, whereas an NRA &quot;F&quot; candidate is a &quot;true enemy of gun owners&#x27; rights&quot;.

The NRA endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time in 1980, backing Ronald Reagan over Jimmy Carter. The NRA has also made endorsements even when it viewed both candidates positively. For example, in the 2006 Pennsylvania Senate elections, the NRA endorsed Rick Santorum over Bob Casey Jr., even though they both had an &quot;A&quot; rating. Despite this endorsement, Santorum lost to Casey.

Republicans joined forces with the NRA and used the recently passed gun control measures to motivate voters in the 1994 midterm elections. In 1993, with Democrats in the majority of both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, President Bill Clinton signed the Brady Bill, named after the press secretary who was shot and paralyzed during the 1981 assassination attempt of President Reagan. The Brady Bill created a mechanism for background checks in order to enforce the GCA of 1968 and prevent criminals and minors from purchasing guns. In addition, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 included a 10-year ban on the sale of assault weapons. In 1994, the ban was favored by 78% of Americans according to a CBS poll.

According to Yale professor Reva Siegel, during the 1994 midterm elections, the NRA &quot;spent more than $3.2 million on GOP campaigns and helped win nineteen of twenty-four &#x27;priority&#x27; races the organization targeted, leading to a House with a majority of members who were &#x27;A-rated&#x27; by the NRA.&quot; Groups like the NRA seeking to expand interpretation of the Second Amendment to include an individual right to a gun, coincided with the &#x27;New Right&#x27;, a political movement concerned with gun control, and social issues such as school prayer and abortion. Leader of the new House Majority Leader Newt Gingrich stated that support for or against gun control defined ones partisan identity. NRA leader Knox echoed this sentiment, assuring members that Republicans would be defenders of Second Amendment rights and repeal recently passed gun control legislation.

The NRA spent $40 million on United States elections in 2008, including $10 million in opposition to the election of Senator Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential campaign.

In 2010, &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot; was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, paving the way for dark money to flow into U.S. elections. As of mid-September 2018, the NRA has become one of just 15 groups which account for three-quarters of the anonymous cash.

The NRA spent over $360,000 in the Colorado recall election of 2013, which resulted in the ouster of state senators John Morse and Angela Giron. &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; called the recall &quot;a stunning victory for the National Rifle Association and gun rights activists.&quot; Morse and Giron helped to pass expanded background checks and ammunition magazine capacity limits after the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, and Sandy Hook, Connecticut, shootings.

On May 20, 2016, the NRA endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election. The timing of the endorsement, before Trump became the official Republican nominee, was unusual, as the NRA typically endorses Republican nominees towards the end of the general election. The NRA said its early endorsement was due to the strong gun control stance of Hillary Clinton In the 2016 United States presidential election the NRA reported spending more than $30 million in support of Donald Trump, more than any other independent group in that election, and three times what it spent in the 2012 presidential election.

===Russian influence===

Investigations by the FBI and Special Counsel Robert Mueller resulted in indictments of Russian nationals on charges of developing and exploiting ties with the NRA to influence US politics by using the NRA to gain access to Republican politicians. Russian politician and gun-rights activist Aleksandr Torshin, a lifetime NRA member who is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was suspected by some of illegally funneling money through the NRA to benefit Trump&#x27;s 2016 campaign. In May 2018, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee released a report stating it had obtained &quot;a number of documents that suggest the Kremlin used the National Rifle Association as a means of accessing and assisting Mr. Trump and his campaign&quot; through Torshin and his assistant Maria Butina, and that &quot;The Kremlin may also have used the NRA to secretly fund Mr. Trump&#x27;s campaign.&quot;

Butina was arrested on July 15, 2018, and charged with conspiring to act as an unregistered agent of the Russian Federation and using Republican operative Paul Erickson for cover and connections as she developed an influence operation designed to &quot;advance the interests of the Russian Federation.&quot; The FBI acquired an email Erickson had sent to an acquaintance in 2016 stating, &quot;Unrelated to specific presidential campaigns, I&#x27;ve been involved in securing a VERY private line of communication between the Kremlin and key [GOP] leaders through, of all conduits, the [NRA].&quot; According to the affidavit, from 2015 through at least February 2017, Butina worked at the direction of Russian who was a high level government official and official at the Russian Central Bank. In December, Butina agreed in a plea deal to cooperate with federal prosecutors. Butina later denied accusations that she was a Russian agent.

In 2018, in a letter sent to Sen. Ron Wyden and addressed to Congress, the NRA acknowledged it had accepted approximately $2,000 in membership dues and magazine subscriptions and $525 in contributions from 23 Russian nationals or people associated with Russian addresses since 2015. In an earlier news interview the NRA&#x27;s lawyers stated that the NRA had received less than $1000 from only one Russian donor. According to a Wyden aide, the NRA letter would be referred to the Federal Election Commission. NRA&#x27;s General Counsel John C. Frazer wrote to Senator Wyden: &quot;While we do receive some contributions from foreign individuals and entities, those contributions are made directly to the NRA for lawful purposes. Our review of our records has found no foreign donations in connection with a United States election, either directly or through a conduit.&quot;

According to the minority Democratic staff of the Senate Finance Committee the NRA acted as &quot;a foreign asset&quot; of Russia during the 2016 election, putting its tax exempt status at risk. The allegations were made in a 77-page report on an 18-month investigation released on September 27, 2019. An 18-page rebuttal by majority committee Republicans said the Democratic report demonstrated &quot;little or nothing&quot;.

Neither the FBI nor Special Counsel investigations found any Russian money funneling. The FBI investigation resulted in the conviction of Butina, not on any money-related charges, and the Mueller Report does not mention the NRA. The Federal Election Commission has dismissed allegations of Russian money funneling as unsupported by the evidence.

===The ATF and Senate confirmations===
The NRA has for decades sought to limit the ability of the ATF to regulate firearms by blocking nominees and lobbying against reforms that would increase the ability of the ATF to track gun crimes. For instance, the NRA opposed ATF reforms to trace guns to owners electronically; the ATF currently does so through paper records. In 2006, the NRA lobbied US Representative F. James Sensenbrenner to add a provision to the Patriot Act reauthorization that requires Senate confirmation of ATF director nominees. For seven years after that, the NRA lobbied against and &quot;effectively blocked&quot; every presidential nominee. First was President George W. Bush&#x27;s choice, Michael Sullivan, whose confirmation was held up in 2008 by three Republican Senators who said the ATF was hostile to gun dealers. One of the Senators was Larry Craig, who was an NRA board member during his years in the Senate. Confirmation of President Obama&#x27;s first nominee, Andrew Traver, stalled in 2011 after the NRA expressed strong opposition. Some Senators resisted confirming another Obama nominee, B. Todd Jones, because of the NRA&#x27;s opposition, until 2013, when the NRA said it was neutral on Jones&#x27; nomination and that it would not include the confirmation vote in its grading system. Dan Freedman, national editor for Hearst Newspapers&#x27; Washington, D.C. bureau, stated that it, &quot;clears the way for senators from pro-gun states—Democrats as well as at least some Republicans—to vote for Jones without fear of political repercussions&quot;.

In 2014, Obama weighed the idea of delaying a vote on his nominee for Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, when Republicans and some conservative Democrats criticized Murthy, after the NRA opposed him. In February, the NRA wrote to Senate leaders Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell to say that it &quot;strongly opposes&quot; Murthy&#x27;s confirmation, and told &quot;The Washington Times&quot;″ Emily Miller that it would score the vote in its PAC grading system. &quot;The NRA decision&quot;, wrote Miller, &quot;will undoubtedly make vulnerable Democrats up for reelection in the midterms reconsider voting party line on this nominee.&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; stated on March 15, &quot;Crossing the NRA to support Dr. Murthy could be a liability for some of the Democrats running for re-election this year in conservative-leaning states&quot;. Murthy&#x27;s nomination received broad support from over 100 medical and public health organizations in the U.S., including the American College of Physicians, the American Public Health Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, and the American Diabetes Association. On December 15, 2014, Murthy&#x27;s appointment as Surgeon General was approved by the Senate.

The NRA also opposed the appointments of Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan as Supreme Court justices.

===Legislation===
The NRA initially opposed the 1934 National Firearms Act, but gave their support after several changes including the removal of pistols and revolvers and redefinition of machine gun, which regulated what were considered at the time &quot;gangster weapons&quot; such as machine guns, short-barreled rifles, short-barreled shotguns, and sound suppressors. However, the organization&#x27;s position on suppressors has since changed.

The NRA supported the 1938 Federal Firearms Act (FFA) which established the Federal Firearms License (FFL) program. The FFA required all manufacturers and dealers of firearms who ship or receive firearms or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce to have a license, and forbade them from transferring any firearm or most ammunition to any person interstate unless certain conditions were met.

The NRA supported and opposed parts of the Gun Control Act of 1968, which broadly regulated the firearms industry and firearms owners, primarily focusing on regulating interstate commerce in firearms by prohibiting interstate firearms transfers except among licensed manufacturers, dealers and importers. The law was supported by America&#x27;s oldest manufacturers (Colt, Smith &amp; Wesson, etc.) in an effort to forestall even greater restrictions which were feared in response to recent domestic violence. The NRA supported elements of the law, such as those forbidding the sale of firearms to convicted criminals and the mentally ill.

The NRA influenced the writing of the Firearm Owners Protection Act and worked for its passage.

In 2004, the NRA opposed renewal of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994. The ban expired on September 13, 2004.

In 2005, President George W. Bush signed into law the NRA-backed Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act which partially shields firearms manufacturers and dealers from being held liable for negligence when crimes have been committed with their products.

===Litigation===
In November 2005, the NRA and other gun advocates filed a lawsuit challenging San Francisco Proposition H, which banned the ownership and sales of firearms. The NRA argued that the proposition overstepped local government authority and intruded into an area regulated by the state. The San Francisco County Superior Court agreed with the NRA position. The city appealed the court&#x27;s ruling, but lost a 2008 appeal. In October 2008, San Francisco was forced to pay a $380,000 settlement to the National Rifle Association and other plaintiffs to cover the costs of litigating Proposition H.

In April 2006, New Orleans, Louisiana, police began returning to citizens guns that had been confiscated after Hurricane Katrina. The NRA, Second Amendment Foundation (SAF), and other groups agreed to drop a lawsuit against the city in exchange for the return.

The NRA filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in the 2008 landmark gun rights case of &quot;District of Columbia v Heller&quot;. In a 5 to 4 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that the District of Columbia&#x27;s gun laws were unconstitutional, and for the first time held that an individual&#x27;s right to a gun was unconnected to service in a militia. Some legal scholars believe that the NRA was influential in altering the public&#x27;s interpretation of the Second Amendment, providing the foundation for the majority&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Heller&quot;.

In 2009, the NRA again filed suit (&quot;Guy Montag Doe v. San Francisco Housing Authority&quot;) in the city of San Francisco challenging the city&#x27;s ban of guns in public housing. On January 14, 2009, the San Francisco Housing Authority reached a settlement with the NRA, which allows residents to possess legal firearms within a SFHA apartment building.

In 2010, the NRA sued the city of Chicago, Illinois (&quot;McDonald v. Chicago&quot;) and the Supreme Court ruled that like other substantive rights, the right to bear arms is incorporated via the Fourteenth Amendment to the Bill of Rights, and therefore applies to the states.

In March 2013, the NRA joined a federal lawsuit with other gun rights groups challenging New York&#x27;s gun control law (the NY SAFE Act), arguing that Governor Andrew Cuomo &quot;usurped the legislative and democratic process&quot; in passing the law, which included restrictions on magazine capacity and expanding the state&#x27;s assault weapons ban.

In November 2013, voters in Sunnyvale, California, passed an ordinance banning certain ammunition magazines along with three other firearm-related restrictions. The ordinance was passed by 66 percent in favor. The ordinance requires city residents to &quot;dispose, donate, or sell&quot; any magazine capable of holding more than ten rounds within a proscribed period of time once the measure takes effect. The following month, the NRA joined local residents in suing the city on second amendment grounds. A federal judge dismissed the suit three months later, upholding the Sunnyvale&#x27;s ordinance.

The city of San Francisco then passed similar ordinances a short time later. The San Francisco Veteran Police Officers Association (SFVPOA), represented by NRA attorneys, filed a lawsuit challenging San Francisco&#x27;s ban on the possession of high-capacity magazines, seeking an injunction. A federal judge denied the injunction in February 2014.

In 2014, the NRA lobbied for a bill in Pennsylvania which grants it and other advocacy groups legal standing to sue municipalities to overturn local firearm regulations passed in violation of a state law such regulations, and which also allows the court to force cities to pay their legal fees. As soon as it became law, the NRA sued three cities: Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Lancaster. In Philadelphia, seven regulations the NRA sued to overturn included a ban on gun possession by those found to be a risk for harming themselves or others, and a requirement to report stolen guns to the police within twenty-four hours after discovery of the loss or theft. In Lancaster, a city of fewer than 60,000, mayor Rick Gray, who has chaired the pro-gun control group Mayors Against Illegal Guns, was also named in the suit. In that city, the NRA challenged an ordinance requiring gun owners to tell police when a firearm is lost or stolen within 72 hours or face jail time. The basis for the lawsuits is &quot;a 1974 state law that bars municipalities against passing restrictions that are pre-empted by state gun laws&quot;. At least 20 Pennsylvania municipalities have rescinded regulations in response to threatened litigation.

The NRA has worked with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in opposing NSA collection of the call records of calls in the United States.

On September 4, 2019, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a non-binding resolution which declared the NRA a domestic terrorist organization and said the city should &quot;take every reasonable step&quot; to limit vendors which do business with the city from also doing business with the NRA. On September 9, the NRA filed a lawsuit in response, accusing city officials of violating the organization&#x27;s free speech rights by discriminating against the organization &quot;based on the viewpoint of their political speech.&quot; On September 23, mayor London Breed and city attorney Dennis Herrera announced in a memo that &quot;the city&#x27;s contracting process and policies have not changed and will not change as a result of the resolution.&quot; On November 7, 2019, the NRA dropped their lawsuit against San Francisco. Los Angeles had passed a similar ordinance but the NRA won a preliminary injunction on December 11, 2019 and subsequently dropped the lawsuit after Los Angeles repealed the law.

==Programs==

The National Rifle Association owns the National Firearms Museum in Fairfax County, Virginia, featuring exhibits on the evolution and history of firearms in America. In August 2013, the NRA National Sporting Arms Museum opened at an expansive Bass Pro Shops retail store in Springfield, Missouri. It displays almost 1,000 firearms, including historically significant firearms from the NRA and other collections. The NRA publishes a number of periodicals including &quot;American Rifleman&quot; and others.

The NRA sponsors a range of programs about firearm safety for children and adults, including a program for school-age children, the NRA&#x27;s &quot;Eddie Eagle&quot;. The organization issues credentials and trains firearm instructors.

In 1994, following disagreements between the NRA and athletes over control of the program of Olympic shooting sports, the US Olympic Committee recommended USA Shooting replace the NRA as the national governing body for Olympic shooting. The NRA dropped out just before the decision was announced, citing a lack of appreciation for their efforts.

The NRA supports marksmanship training as well as hosting the National Rifle and Pistol Matches at Camp Perry, events which are described by the El Paso Times as &quot;America&#x27;s world series of competitive shooting&quot;.

In 2014 the NRA temporarily moved the National Smallbore Matches to Bristol, Indiana in advance of Camp Perry hosting the 2015 Palma Match (Long Range World Championships). In 2015 it was announced the change was permanent. The move drew criticism from shooters as the Bristol ranges lacked affordable accommodation, trade stands per Camp Perry&#x27;s &quot;Commercial Row&quot;, or even interest from the NRA - whose own publications had only reported on the Camp Perry matches. A fall in participant numbers led to the foundation of the American Smallbore Shooting Association in 2016 as an apolitical match organiser to address the NRA&#x27;s perceived lack of interest in smallbore competition shooting.

The National Rifle Association maintains ties with other organizations such as the Boy Scouts of America and 4-H and contributes to youth shooting programs.

The NRA hosts annual meetings. The 2018 meeting was held on May 3 in Dallas, Texas. More than 800 exhibitors and 80,000 people attended the event, making it the largest in NRA history. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence addressed attendees.

==Organizational structure and finances==
===Leadership===
====Executive staff and spokespersons====
From 1991 to 2024, Wayne LaPierre served as the organization&#x27;s executive vice president, and functioned as the chief executive officer. LaPierre&#x27;s compensation averaged $1 million per year and included a nearly $4 million retirement payout in 2015. Other previous notable holders of that office include: Milton Reckord, Floyd Lavinius Parks, Franklin Orth, Maxwell Rich, Harlon Carter, J. Warren Cassidy, and Gary Anderson.

Chris W. Cox was the executive director of the NRA&#x27;s lobbying branch, the Institute for Legislative Action. He received more than $1.3 million in compensation in 2015. Kyle Weaver is executive director of general operations. Kayne B. Robinson is executive director of the General Operations Division and chairman of the Whittington Center.
In 2017, political commentator Dana Loesch was appointed as the NRA&#x27;s national spokesperson, with the formal title of &quot;Special Assistant to the Executive Vice President for Public Communication.&quot; Loesch hosts &quot;The DL&quot; on NRATV and has featured prominently in other NRA-produced videos.

Actor Chuck Norris serves as the honorary chairman for the association&#x27;s voter registration campaign. Colion Noir hosts a video program on the NRA&#x27;s online video channel.

In May 2018, the NRA announced that Oliver North would become president of the organization. North served one tumultuous term, marked by multiple legal battles and a power struggle with LaPierre; he was replaced by Carolyn D. Meadows on April 29, 2019.

====Board of directors====
The NRA is governed by a board of 76 elected directors, 75 of whom serve three-year terms and one who is elected to serve as a cross-over director. The directors choose a president and other officers from among the membership, as well as the executive director of the NRA General Operations and the executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA). In 2015, 71 members were white and 65 were male. More came from Texas than any other state. Only 7 percent of eligible members vote. Most board nominations are vetted by an appointed nine-member Nominating Committee. One member is George Kollitides of the Freedom Group. The nomination committee has been called &quot;kingmakers&quot; by MSNBC and Jeff Knox says &quot;the process is front-loaded to give incumbents and Nominating Committee candidates a significant advantage&quot;.

===Membership===
According to the NRA, their membership reached 5.5 million total members in 2018, a record high, and membership dues went from $128,209,303 in 2017 to $170,391,374 in 2018; an increase of $42,182,071, or 33 percent.

A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that 19% of US gun owners consider themselves NRA members. Journalist Megan Wilson stated that the Pew study places membership at 14 million, far higher than the NRA&#x27;s own report of 5 million. According to the NRA, some non-members typically claim to be members when surveyed, as a show of support.

====Notable members====
Nine US presidents have been NRA members. In addition to Grant, they are: Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush (who resigned in 1995), and Donald Trump. Three US vice presidents, two chief justices of the US Supreme Court, and several US congressmen, as well as legislators and officials of state governments are or have been members.

Current or past members also include journalist Hunter S. Thompson, Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, documentarian Michael Moore (who joined with the intent of dismantling the organization), actor Rick Schroder, and singer James Hetfield.

===Interconnected organizations===
The National Rifle Association is composed of several financially interconnected organizations under common leadership, including the NRA Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) which manages the NRA&#x27;s political action committee and the NRA Civil Defense Fund which does &quot;pro bono&quot; legal work for people with cases involving Second Amendment rights. The NRA Civil Rights Defense Fund was established in 1978. Harlon Carter and Neal Knox were responsible for its founding.

In 1994, the Fund spent over $500,000 on legal fees to support legal cases involving guns and gun control measures. It donated $20,000 in 1996 for the defense of New York City resident Bernhard Goetz when he was sued by a man he shot and left paralyzed. It paid the legal bills in the case of Brian Aitken, a New Jersey resident sentenced to seven years in state prison for transporting guns without a carry permit. On December 20, 2010, Governor Chris Christie granted Aitken clemency and ordered Aitken&#x27;s immediate release from prison.

====NRA Foundation====
The NRA Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that raises and donates money to outdoors groups and others such as ROTC programs, 4-H and Boy Scouts. In 2010, the NRA Foundation distributed $21.2 million in grants for gun-related training and education programs: $12.6 million to the NRA itself, and the rest to community programs for hunters, competitive shooters, gun collectors, and law enforcement, and to women and youth groups. The foundation has no staff and pays no salaries.

Friends of NRA is a program that raises money for the NRA Foundation. Since its inception in 1992, Friends of NRA has held over 17,600 events, reached over 3.2 million attendees and raised over $600 million for The NRA Foundation.

====Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF)====

By 1976, as the NRA became more politically oriented, the Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF), a PAC, was established as a subsidiary to the NRA, to support NRA-friendly politicians. Chris W. Cox, who is the NRA&#x27;s chief lobbyist and principal political strategist, is also the NRA-PVF chairman. Through the NRA-PVF, the NRA began to rate political candidates on their positions on gun rights. An NRA &quot;A+&quot; candidate is one who has &quot;not only an excellent voting record on all critical NRA issues, but who has also made a vigorous effort to promote and defend the Second Amendment&quot;, whereas an NRA &quot;F&quot; candidate is deemed a &quot;true enemy of gun owners&#x27; rights&quot;.

In the 2008 elections, the PVF spent millions on &quot;direct campaign donations&quot; and &quot;grassroots operation&quot;. In 2012, NRA-PVF income was $14.4 million and expenses were $16.1 million. By 2014, the NRA-PVF income rose to 21.9 million with expenses of 20.7 million.

===Finances===

In 2010, the NRA reported revenue of $227.8 million and expenses of $243.5 million, with revenue including roughly $115 million generated from fundraising, sales, advertising and royalties, and most of the rest from membership dues. Less than half of the NRA&#x27;s income comes from membership dues and program fees; the majority is from contributions, grants, royalties, and advertising.

Corporate donors include a variety of companies such as outdoors-supply and sporting-goods companies, and firearm manufacturers. From 2005 through 2011, the NRA received at least $14.8 million from more than 50 firearms-related firms. An April 2011 Violence Policy Center presentation stated that the NRA had received between $14.7 million and $38.9 million from the firearms industry since 2005. In 2008, Beretta exceeded $2 million in donations to the NRA, and in 2012 Smith &amp; Wesson gave more than $1 million. Sturm, Ruger &amp; Company raised $1.25 million through a program in which it donated $1 to the NRA-ILA for each gun it sold from May 2011 to May 2012. In a similar program, gun buyers and participating stores are invited to &quot;round up&quot; the purchase price to the nearest dollar as a voluntary contribution. According to the NRA&#x27;s 2010 tax forms, the &quot;round-up&quot; funds have been allocated both to public-interest programs and to lobbying.

====2018 New York lawsuit ====
In 2018, the NRA alleged in an official Court document that it suffered tens of millions of dollars in damage from actions of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the State&#x27;s financial regulator. The state&#x27;s Department of Financial Services (DFS) was directed by the Cuomo administration to encourage institutions it oversees, insurance companies, banks and other financial services companies licensed in New York state, to review their business interactions with the NRA and &quot;other similar organizations&quot; and assess if they would pose &quot;reputational risk&quot;. The NRA&#x27;s suit states that Cuomo&#x27;s actions violate the organization&#x27;s first-amendment rights and the NRA had suffered tens of millions of dollars in financial losses. The ACLU has filed a brief with the Northern District of New York court supporting the NRA&#x27;s case. The brief noted that if proven true, the allegations disclose an abuse of government regulatory authority to retaliate against a disfavored advocacy organization by imposing a burden on the NRA&#x27;s ability to conduct lawful business.

On November 3, 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case &quot;National Rifle Association of America v. Vullo&quot; about whether the director of the New York DFS violated the First Amendment by instructing financial institutions not to do business with the NRA. The Court released its opinion on May 30, 2024, vacating the Second Circuit&#x27;s decision and remanding the case to the lower court.

==== 2020 New York lawsuit ====
In August 2020, on behalf of the State of New York, Attorney General Letitia James sued the NRA and four individuals involved with the organization: CEO Wayne LaPierre; former chief of staff and the executive director of general operations Joshua Powell; former treasurer and CFO Wilson &quot;Woody&quot; Phillips; and corporate secretary and general counsel John Frazer. James charged the organization with illegal conduct, stating that the NRA mismanaged funds and assets and failed to follow state and federal laws. The suit claims that money was diverted away from its charitable mission, and instead used to fund personal expenses for senior leadership, resulting in a loss to the NPO of $64 million over three years. While the NRA sought to dismiss the lawsuit, in June 2022, Manhattan Judge Joel M. Cohen ruled that the lawsuit could move forward. NRA leadership was found guilty of corruption by a Manhattan jury in February 2024, with former vice-president and CEO LaPierre found to have cost the NRA $5.4 million in damages and ordered to pay restitution of $4.35 million.

==Public opinion and image==

A Reuters/Ipsos poll in April 2012 found that 82% of Republicans and 55% of Democrats saw the NRA &quot;in a positive light&quot;. In seven of eight Gallup polls between 1993 and 2015, a majority of Americans reported holding a favorable opinion of the NRA. Its highest rating was at 60% favorability in 2005 (with 34% unfavorable), while its lowest rating was at 42% favorability in 1995 (with 51% unfavorable). In October 2015, 58% of Americans held a favorable opinion of the NRA, though there was a wide spread among political affiliations: 77% of conservatives, 56% of moderates and 30% of liberals held this view.

A &quot;Washington Post&quot;/ABC News poll in January 2013 showed that only 36% of Americans had a favorable opinion of the NRA leadership.

A 2017 poll conducted by the political action committee Americans for Responsible Solutions, which supports gun control, exclusively questioned 661 gun owners. 26% of the respondents stated they were a member of the NRA. The ARS reported that less than 50% of gun owners polled believed the NRA represented their interests, while 67% of them somewhat or strongly agreed with the statement that it had been &quot;overtaken by lobbyists and the interests of gun manufacturers and lost its original purpose and mission.&quot; The NRA disputed the poll&#x27;s veracity in an e-mail sent to &quot;Politico&quot;, which had published the story.

Polling trends since 2018 show a significant decline in NRA favorability. A 2018 NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll found that &quot;for the first time since at least 2000, Americans hold a net unfavorable view of the NRA&quot;—the poll showed respondents view of the NRA was 40% negative and 37% positive. The poll showed that compared to the same question in 2017, the favorability rating of the NRA overall dropped 5%, noting that the shift was largely due to favorability declines among certain demographics: married white women, urban residents, white women (overall), and moderate Republicans.

A February 2018 Quinnipiac poll found that 51% of Americans believe that the policies supported by the NRA are bad for the U.S., a 4% increase since October 2017.

The NRA calls itself &quot;the oldest continuously operating civil liberties organization&quot; and is &quot;one of the largest and best-funded lobbying organizations&quot; in the United States. Its claim that it is one of the oldest civil rights organizations is disputed. While the NRA was founded in 1871, it did not pursue a gun rights agenda until 1934. The National Association for the Deaf (NAD, founded in 1880) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP, founded in 1909) both originated as civil rights organizations according to other sources.

==Criticism==
The National Rifle Association has been criticized by newspaper editorial boards, gun control and gun rights advocacy groups, political commentators, and politicians. Democrats and liberals frequently criticize the organization. The NRA&#x27;s oldest organized critics include the gun control advocacy groups the Brady Campaign, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV), and the Violence Policy Center (VPC). Twenty-first century groups include Everytown for Gun Safety (formerly Mayors Against Illegal Guns), Moms Demand Action, and Giffords.

===Political involvement===

In 1995, former US President George H. W. Bush resigned his life membership to the organization after receiving a National Rifle Association Institute of Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) fund-raising letter, signed by executive vice president Wayne LaPierre, that referred to ATF agents as &quot;jack-booted government thugs&quot;. The NRA later apologized for the letter&#x27;s language.

In December 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; editorial board criticized the NRA&#x27;s attacks, which it called false and misleading, on Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign.

After US President Donald Trump&#x27;s election, the NRA closely aligned with him. At an event in February 2018, Trump said that he was a &quot;big fan of the NRA&quot; but said that &quot;doesn&#x27;t mean we have to agree on everything.&quot;

Although the NRA has previously donated to and endorsed Democratic candidates, it has become more closely affiliated with the Republican Party since the 1990s. In 2016, only two Democratic House candidates received donations from the NRA, compared to 115 in the 1992 elections, in a reflection of decreasing Democratic support for the NRA and its mission. Self-identified Republicans are far more likely to hold a positive view of the NRA than are Democrats.

===Gun control===
In February 2013, &quot;USA Today&quot; editors criticized the NRA for flip-flopping on expansion of universal background checks to private and gun show sales, which the NRA now opposes.

&quot;As early as March 23 (2013), POLITICO had reported on rumors that the NRA and (WV Sen. Joe) Manchin were engaged in secret talks over background checks. Two days later, the National Association for Gun Rights (NAGR) sent out a bulletin to its members: &quot;I&#x27;ve warned you from the beginning that our gravest danger was an inside-Washington driven deal,&quot; wrote NAGR executive Dudley Brown. He added that the deal was a &quot;Manchin-NRA compromise bill&quot;. The Gun Owners of America followed suit a week later, urging its members to contact the NRA to voice their opinion. Neither of these groups had even a tenth of the NRA&#x27;s membership, or its political power, but they threatened to chip away at the group&#x27;s reputation. Whatever NRA HQ&#x27;s position on the bill may have been, it was fast getting outflanked by ideologues on the right.&quot;

In March 2014, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; criticized the NRA&#x27;s interference in government research on gun violence, and both &quot;Post&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editors criticized its opposition of Vivek Murthy for US Surgeon General. In November 2018, a social media dispute was seen, after a paper was published by the American College of Physicians that stated that medical professionals had a special responsibility to speak out on prevention of gun-related injuries and that they should support appropriate regulation of the purchase of legal weapons. In response to the paper the NRA tweeted against the paper and &quot;anti-gun doctors&quot; and claimed that &quot;half of the articles in Annals of Internal Medicine are pushing for gun control&quot;, and medical professional began posting their experiences of caring for gun violence victims. Economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton have also noted that the NRA has been effective in pressuring Congress to not fund high-quality research on gun accessibility and suicide rates.

A survey of NRA members found that the majority support certain gun control policies, such as a universal background check:

===Gun manufacturing industry===
Critics have charged that the NRA represents the interests of gun manufacturers rather than gun owners. The NRA receives donations from gun manufacturers.

===Mass shootings===

====Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting====
Following the high-profile 2012 shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, the organization began to become the focus of intense criticism, due to its continued refusal to endorse any new restrictions on assault-style gun ownership, or to endorse any other types of new restrictions on gun ownership.
While supporters say the organization advances their rights to buy and own guns according to the constitution&#x27;s Second Amendment, some critics have described it as a &quot;terrorist organization&quot; for advocating policies that enable and permit the widespread distribution and sale of assault-style weapons, and for its opposition to any other types of restrictions on gun sales or use.

In December 2012, following the shooting, NRA broke its social media silence and media blackout to announce a press conference. At the event, LaPierre announced an NRA-backed effort to assess the feasibility of placing armed security officers in the nation&#x27;s 135,000 public and private schools under a &quot;National School Shield Program&quot;. He called on Congress &quot;to act immediately to appropriate whatever is necessary&quot;. The announcement came in the same week after President Obama had stated his support for a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

The NRA has been criticized for their media strategy following mass shootings in the United States. Following the Sandy Hook shooting, the NRA released an online video which attacked Obama and mentioned Obama&#x27;s daughters; New Jersey Governor Chris Christie called it &quot;reprehensible&quot; and said that it demeaned the organization. A senior lobbyist for the organization later characterized the video as &quot;ill-advised&quot;.

====2017 Las Vegas shooting====

After the October 2017 shooting at a concert in Las Vegas, which left 58 people dead and 851 injured, the NRA was initially criticized for their silence. After four days they issued a statement opposing additional gun control laws, which they said would not stop further attacks, and called for a federal law allowing people who have a concealed carry permit in one state to carry concealed weapons in all other states. The organization also suggested additional regulations on so-called bump fire stocks, which allow a semi-automatic weapon to function like a machine gun; the Las Vegas shooter had used such a device.

====Stoneman Douglas High School shooting====

In February 2018 a school shooting at a high school in Florida left 17 dead and another 17 injured, and student survivors organized a movement called Never Again MSD to demand passage of certain gun control measures. Many of the students blamed the NRA, and the politicians who accept money from the organization, for preventing enactment of any gun control proposals after previous high-profile shootings. An NRA spokesman responded by blaming the shooting on the FBI and the media. The NRA also issued a statement that the incident was proof that more guns were immediately required in schools in the hands of a bolstered force of armed security personnel in order to &quot;harden&quot; them against any further similar assaults. A Florida law passed in the wake of the shooting, which includes a provision to ban the sale of firearms to people under 21, was immediately challenged in federal court by the NRA on the grounds that it is &quot;violating the constitutional rights of 18- to 21-year-olds.&quot;

In May 2018, Cameron Kasky&#x27;s father and other Parkland parents formed a super PAC, Families vs Assault Rifles PAC (FAMSVARPAC), with a stated goal of going &quot;up against NRA candidates in every meaningful race in the country&quot;. The organization seeks federal legislation to ban &quot;the most dangerous firearms&quot;, while not affecting the Second Amendment.

====Boycott====

The NRA offers corporate discounts to its members at various businesses through its corporate affiliate programs. For several years, and increasingly in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, &quot;affiliate companies&quot; have been targeted in social media as part of a boycott effort to terminate their business relationships with the NRA. As a result of this boycott movement, several major corporations such as Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Hertz, Symantec, and MetLife have disaffiliated from the NRA, while others, such as FedEx have refused to disaffiliate.

===Media campaigns===
In 2017, Zack Beauchamp of &quot;Vox&quot; and Mark Sumner of &quot;Daily Kos&quot; criticized a video advertisement from the NRA. In the video, Dana Loesch runs through a list of wrongs committed by an unspecified &quot;they&quot;:

They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that the president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars, and singers, and comedy shows, and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance. All to make them march. Make them protest. Make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia. To smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law abiding. Until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they&#x27;ll use it as an excuse for their outrage. The only way we stop this. The only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth.

Sumner alleged the NRA was trying to boost gun sales by &quot;convincing half of America to declare war on the other half.&quot; Beauchamp wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s a paranoid vision of American life that encourages the NRA&#x27;s fans to see liberals not as political opponents, but as monsters.&quot;

In May 2018, the NRA ran an advertisement which criticized the media for giving too much coverage to school shooters by showing their faces and revealing their names, in effect causing a &quot;glorification of carnage in pursuit of ratings&quot;, and satirically suggested that Congress pass legislation to limit such coverage in order to make provocative point about gun control. In response, critics suggested that this would violate the First Amendment right of free speech.

===Pro-gun rights criticism===
Pro-gun rights critics include Gun Owners of America (GOA), founded in the 1970s because some gun rights advocates believed the NRA was too flexible on gun issues. Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership (JPFO) has also disagreed with NRA for what it perceives as a willingness to compromise on gun control. The National Association for Gun Rights (NAGR) has been an outspoken critic of the NRA for a number of years. According to the Huffington Post, &quot;NAGR is the much leaner, more pugnacious version of the NRA. Where the NRA has looked to find some common ground with gun reform advocates and at least appear to be reasonable, NAGR has been the unapologetic champion of opening up gun laws even more.&quot; In June 2014, an open carry group in Texas threatened to withdraw its support of the NRA if it did not retract its statements critical of the practice. The NRA–ILA&#x27;s Chris Cox said the statements were a staffer&#x27;s personal opinion and a mistake.

===Lack of advocacy for black gun owners===
The NRA has been accused of insufficiently defending African-American gun rights and of providing muted and delayed responses in gun rights cases involving black gun owners. Others argue that the NRA&#x27;s inaction in prominent gun rights cases involving black gun owners is a consequence of their reluctance to criticize law enforcement, noting NRA support for Otis McDonald and Shaneen Allen.

In a well-publicized 2016 case, Philando Castile, an African-American and legal gun owner, was fatally shot by a police officer during a traffic stop while reaching for his wallet. Castile had a valid firearm permit and informed the police officer of his gun prior to the shooting. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the NRA had typically &quot;been quick to defend other gun owners who made national news&quot;, but stayed silent on the Castile shooting. Other gun rights advocates as well as some NRA members voiced similar criticisms. In a delayed response to the shooting the NRA stated the death was &quot;a terrible tragedy that could have been avoided.&quot;

Adam Winkler, professor of constitutional law at the UCLA School of Law, has argued that there are historical precedents to the NRA&#x27;s lack of advocacy for black gun owners, stating that the NRA promoted gun control legislation in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1960s with the intent to reduce gun ownership by immigrants and racial minorities.

<doc id="70104" wikidata="Q2709511" url="?curid=70104" title="Simple LR parser">
<text>In computer science, a Simple LR or SLR parser is a type of LR parser with small parse tables and a relatively simple parser generator algorithm. As with other types of LR(1) parser, an SLR parser is quite efficient at finding the single correct bottom-up parse in a single left-to-right scan over the input stream, without guesswork or backtracking. The parser is mechanically generated from a formal grammar for the language.

SLR and the more general methods LALR parser and Canonical LR parser have identical methods and similar tables at parse time; they differ only in the mathematical grammar analysis algorithms used by the parser generator tool. SLR and LALR generators create tables of identical size and identical parser states. SLR generators accept fewer grammars than LALR generators like yacc and Bison. Many computer languages don&#x27;t readily fit the restrictions of SLR, as is. Bending the language&#x27;s natural grammar into SLR grammar form requires more compromises and grammar hackery. So LALR generators have become much more widely used than SLR generators, despite being somewhat more complicated tools. SLR methods remain a useful learning step in college classes on compiler theory.

SLR and LALR were both developed by Frank DeRemer as the first practical uses of Donald Knuth&#x27;s LR parser theory. The tables created for real grammars by full LR methods were impractically large, larger than most computer memories of that decade, with 100 times or more parser states than the SLR and LALR methods.

== Lookahead sets ==
To understand the differences between SLR and LALR, it is important to understand their many similarities and how they both make shift-reduce decisions. (See the article LR parser now for that background, up through the section on reductions&#x27; lookahead sets.)

The one difference between SLR and LALR is how their generators calculate the lookahead sets of input symbols that should appear next, whenever some completed production rule is found and reduced.

SLR generators calculate that lookahead by an easy approximation method based directly on the grammar, ignoring the details of individual parser states and transitions. This ignores the particular context of the current parser state. If some nonterminal symbol &quot;S&quot; is used in several places in the grammar, SLR treats those places in the same single way rather than handling them individually. The SLR generator works out codice_1, the set of all terminal symbols which can immediately follow some occurrence of &quot;S&quot;. In the parse table, each reduction to &quot;S&quot; uses Follow(S) as its LR(1) lookahead set. Such follow sets are also used by generators for LL top-down parsers. A grammar that has no shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts when using follow sets is called an SLR grammar. 

LALR generators calculate lookahead sets by a more precise method based on exploring the graph of parser states and their transitions. This method considers the particular context of the current parser state. It customizes the handling of each grammar occurrence of some nonterminal S. See article LALR parser for further details of this calculation. The lookahead sets calculated by LALR generators are a subset of (and hence better than) the approximate sets calculated by SLR generators. If a grammar has table conflicts when using SLR follow sets, but is conflict-free when using LALR follow sets, it is called a LALR grammar. 

== Example ==
A grammar that can be parsed by an SLR parser but not by an LR(0) parser is the following:

: (0) S → E
: (1) E → 1 E
: (2) E → 1

Constructing the action and goto table as is done for LR(0) parsers would give the following item sets and tables:

;Item set 0
: S → • E
: + E → • 1 E
: + E → • 1

;Item set 1
: E → 1 • E
: E → 1 •
: + E → • 1 E
: + E → • 1

;Item set 2
: S → E •

;Item set 3
: E → 1 E •

The action and goto tables:

As can be observed there is a shift-reduce conflict for state 1 and terminal &#x27;1&#x27;. This occurs because, when the action table for an LR(0) parser is created, reduce actions are inserted on a per-row basis. However, by using a follow set, reduce actions can be added with finer granularity. The follow set for this grammar:
A reduce only needs to be added to a particular action column if that action is in the follow set associated with that reduce. This algorithm describes whether a reduce action must be added to an action column:

 function mustBeAdded(reduceAction, action) {
 ruleNumber = reduceAction.value;
 ruleSymbol = rules[ruleNumber].leftHandSide;
 return (action in followSet(ruleSymbol))

for example, is false, because the left hand side of rule 2 is &quot;E&quot;, and 1 is not in E&#x27;s follow set.
Contrariwise, is true, because &quot;$&quot; is in E&#x27;s follow set.

By using mustBeAdded on each reduce action in the action table, the result is a conflict-free action table:

<text>Athens is a city and the county seat of Athens County, Ohio, United States. The population was 23,849 at the 2020 United States census. Located along the Hocking River within Appalachian Ohio about southeast of Columbus, Athens is best known as the home of Ohio University, a large public research university with an undergraduate and graduate enrollment of more than 21,000 students. It is the principal city of the Athens micropolitan area.

== History ==
The first permanent European settlers arrived in Athens in 1797, more than a decade after the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War. In 1800, the town site was first surveyed and plotted and incorporated as a village in 1811. Ohio had become a state in 1803. Ohio University was chartered in 1804, the first public institution of higher learning in the Northwest Territory. Previously part of Washington County, Ohio, Athens County was formed in 1805, named for the ancient center of learning, Athens, Greece.

Ohio University in Athens was established with the first federal endowment of an educational institution in the United States. In July 1787, the Congress of the Confederation gave to the Ohio Company of Associates &quot;two townships of good land for the support of a literary institution&quot; in the newly created Northwest Territory.

During The First Session of the Second Territorial General Assembly, held in Chillicothe from November 23, 1801, to January 23, 1802, the General Assembly passed an act establishing the &quot;American Western University&quot; at Athens. The act was approved by Arthur St. Clair, Governor of the Northwest Territory on January 9, 1802. However, no university with the name of American Western University would be established. Ohio became a state in 1803 and on February 18, 1804, the state legislature passed an act establishing the &quot;Ohio University&quot; in the town of Athens. Athens received city status in 1912, following the 1910 census showing the population had passed 5,000 residents, the requirement for city status in Ohio.

Originally, large tracts of land in Athens and Alexander Townships were set aside through a contract between the Congress (under the Articles of Confederation) and the Ohio Company of Associates, a group of American Revolutionary War veterans. These lands were given to Ohio University by the Federal government. This was the first federal land grant for a university, pre-dating the Morrill Act by more than 70 years. At first, lands were mostly leased out, but the failure of many lessors to pay their rents resulted in most of the land being sold. The sale of these lands funded the growth of Ohio University. Today it is one of the largest institutions of higher learning in Ohio, with an enrollment of over 20,000 on the Athens campus and over 28,000 for all campuses.

The earliest industry in the area was salt production, followed by iron production and coal extraction. The largest employer in the county is Ohio University. In 1843, the Hocking Canal opened, enabling shipping from the Ohio River up the Hocking River, which passes through Athens, to Nelsonville, Ohio, and points beyond. However, the canal was closed during cold winters when it froze over.

The first railroad reached Athens in 1857. In the late 19th century, an interurban line opened between Athens and Nelsonville and operated for some years. The Athens Lunatic Asylum, later named the Athens State Hospital, opened in 1874. This was on high ground to the south of town and to the south of the Hocking River. In the late 19th century the hospital was the town&#x27;s largest employer. The state hospital was eventually decommissioned and the property was deeded to Ohio University. It is now known as The Ridges. Much of the building space has been renovated for offices and research space or demolished, and most of the grounds have been set aside as open space, including a land lab.

In 1904, the U. S. Army and the Ohio National Guard conducted joint training exercises near the city. Multiple US army regulars became drunk and were arrested by National Guard Provosts for causing disturbances. The arrests angered the regulars; on Friday a large contingent set out from camp to free an arrested comrade. The armed regulars were stopped by provosts and the ensuing quarrel quickly escalated into a shoot-out on Washington Street, during which one guardsman was killed and five others were wounded.

By 1935, Athens was known as a coal and fruit-producing region and a state center of higher education and psychiatric care. The major manufactured goods included stoves, lumber, parquetry flooring, caskets, and flooring.

The university (and in turn, the city) saw large growth during the post-World War Two era and again during the Vietnam War era. Growth slowed in the 1980s with small increases in growth into present times.

== Geography ==

Athens is located in the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau about 47 miles from Chillicothe and 35 miles west of Marietta. Athens is surrounded by hills that rise about three hundred feet from river valley to the narrow ridge tops. The county extends west from the Ohio River, mostly centered around the lower Hocking River watershed.
According to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of , of which (or 97.81%) is land and (or 2.19%) is water. Large sections of Athens and Ohio University are located in the floodplain of the Hocking River. Over the last two centuries the town suffered from many destructive floods, including notable floods in 1832, 1873, 1907, 1937, 1949, 1964 and 1968. In 1969 the Army Corps of Engineers completed a major work that rerouted and expanded the channel of the Hocking River, for a stretch of several miles around the town, moving the river hundreds of feet to the south. That project and the ongoing efforts to maintain the channel have greatly reduced the negative effects of seasonally high river levels.

Athens is located mostly on and around a south-jutting ridge bordered by a loop in the Hocking River. The underlying geology is mostly sandstone and shale, including &quot;redbed&quot; shale that presents a severe slip hazard when structures are built over it on hillsides. However, there are safe zones above sandstone beds, most notably the Connelsville Sandstone that outcrops high on the hillsides. The old Athens Mental Hospital grounds (now part of the university) was built on the top of a hillside in the late 1860s, and is completely stable due to its position atop the hill rather than on a slope. The recent University Courtyard Apartments is also built on similar underlying geology across a small valley, but the hilltop was extensively removed in order to create a stable base. The city receives all its water supply from wells in unconsolidated river aquifers, and is reputed to be the largest city in the United States to do so.

===Climate===
Athens has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;), typical of most of Ohio.

About 14.8% of families and 51.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 19.1% of those under age 18 and 7.2% of those age 65 or over.

== Economy ==
From the mid-1800s until the 1950s, coal and brick-making were major sources of employment in the county. They became a minor source after the best and most available coal had been extracted and cheaper brick-making became available outside the area. A former manufacturing company was the Midget Motors Corporation, makers of the small automobile, the King Midget.

Ohio University is the largest employer in Athens County. In addition to direct employment through the university, much of the local economy depends on tourism and events related to the university, through local restaurants, bars, stores and hotels. Manufacturing and technology related businesses, including Quidel Corporation (formerly Diagnostic Hybrids), Stewart-MacDonald, Sunpower, Mitchell Electronics, Fastenall, and Gorman-Redlich.

Since the 1970s Athens has earned a reputation as one of the more progressive (liberal) communities in Southeastern Ohio. That reputation includes Democratic political leaning, presence of some international communities, support for use of alternative energy, calling for &#x27;smart growth&#x27; development, development of small farms emphasizing sustainable and organic-produced crops, and support for local businesses. The Athens Farmers Market is open year-round.

Court Street has a number of small to large student apartment buildings. Ohio University&#x27;s main &#x27;college green&#x27; entrance is located at Court &amp; Union. The student center (John Calhoun Baker University Center, colloquially &quot;Baker Center&quot;) is at one end of Court Street. Several Athens shopping areas are located outside the uptown area; the largest is on East State Street with a small mall, several shopping strip centers, large box stores, car dealerships, hotels/motels and many local and national sit-down / fast food restaurants. On the north side of town is Columbus Road area with some shopping, car dealer, motels, eateries and office buildings. On the south side, Richland Avenue has large student housing apartment complexes. West Union St. has a hospital complex, some student housing and the county fairgrounds.

==Arts and culture==
Athens has a long musical tradition that includes local acts and events for touring musicians, performing at Ohio University and festivals in Athens. The folk song &quot;Athens County&quot; - words by Joe Dolce; music by Jonathan Edwards - refers to Athens, Ohio, where Edwards &amp; Dolce attended college in the late 60s. Edwards went on to have a Number 2 hit song nationally with &#x27;Sunshine&#x27; while Dolce moved to Australia and had an international Number 1 hit with Shaddap You Face. Dolce is now an established poet and essayist in Melbourne. Bands hailing from Athens include The Headstone Circus, The Snapdragons, Appalachian Death Ride, She Bears, Southeast Engine, The Ridges and the metal band Skeletonwitch. Athens native Steve Reis, a founder of the Columbus, Ohio-based band McGuffey Lane named his band after a street in Athens. 

Several theater companies have operated in Athens over the years. Studio for Young Actors, aka Drama Club Youth Academy was a youth theater which operated from 2000 to approximately 2010. They performed both original and published plays and musicals featuring young actors. Their main venue was Stuart&#x27;s Opera House in Nelsonville, Ohio They subsequently moved their performance venue to Arts/West a community arts space in Athens, Ohio, operated by the City of Athens. A university park on Richland Ave was designed by Athens&#x27; own Maya Lin.

===Museums===

* Athens County Historical Society and Museum DBA The Southeast Ohio History Center: Historic items relating to life in Athens County
* The Dairy Barn Arts Center: Contemporary arts and crafts.
* Kennedy Museum of Art at Ohio University: Major collections include Southwest Native American textiles and jewelry. Contemporary prints.
* Ohio Valley Museum of Discovery: Interactive children&#x27;s center.

===Annual festivals===

* Athens is home to the annual Halloween Block Party, a massive international spectacle that draws attention from news media across the world each year. Ohio University&#x27;s citation as the world&#x27;s most haunted institution of higher education by the British Psychical Institute; Athens&#x27;s citation as one of the 10 most haunted American cities; and the annual Halloween celebration, have dually added to Athens&#x27;s reputation as one of the 10 most terrifying places on Earth and the &quot;World Capital of Halloween&quot;. Athens was vaunted as one of the top fifteen most haunted cities in America on the Fox Family Channel special &quot;Scariest Places On Earth&quot; that aired on October 23, 2000. Locals with knowledge of the history of The Ridges criticized the Fox portrayal as sensationalistic and misleading on details of the situation. The block party has welcomed more guests each year, and festivities and security have grown in it for that reason. The event caters to roughly 20,000 to 30,000 dressed up partygoers on four closed blocks of uptown streets.
* Blackout Fest is held annually at The Union Bar &amp; Grill and features many local, national, and international indie rock acts.
* The Athens Community Music Festival is held each August. In 2017 two dozen local bands were involved.
* Concert &quot;Under the Elms&quot; is held on the OU College Green from June until early July with the &#x27;Communiversity Band&#x27; (made up of OU faculty, students, alumni as well as community members)
* For many years, an annual Springfest was held on the OU Campus. Primarily due to changes in state alcohol laws, it was replaced by an annual event at Ervin&#x27;s Big Red Barn (and field), a private &quot;party-farm&quot; just outside the city. After the move, the festival was called Derby days. The organization who coordinated the event was removed from campus in 2003. Starting in 2004, Ohio University Seniors Dominic Petrozzi and Timothy Kehoe created One Fest. The festival name is changed each year to represent the number of years it has been held (for example, 2011 was 8Fest). As of 9 Fest, the event has been held at its new location on West Union Street, just outside the campus. It has become one of the largest independent collegiate music festivals in the country, boasting previous performances by national recording artists such as Mike Posner, Machine Gun Kelly, Timeflies, Chip Tha Ripper, Wiz Khalifa, Kendrick Lamar, Steve Aoki and more. in 2008, the name of the festival was changed to &quot;The Number Fest&quot; with an updated &quot;edition&quot; for each year it takes place. Number Fest - 14th Edition will be held on April 16, 2016. 
* Lobsterfest is an annual free concert hosted by the university&#x27;s All Campus Radio Network.
* Since 1983, the 970WATH-Power 105 Chili Bowl has been an annual event and each year raises money for a charity. Currently it takes place in October, at The Market on State.
* Hookah in the hills, an annual festival held twice a year at Poston Lake Music Park in the Spring and Fall, featuring the Columbus-based band Ekoostik Hookah, as well as other local bands.
* The annual Athens International Film and Video Festival is one of the few festivals that are on the official list of Academy Award-qualifying festivals.
*Ohio Brew Week, founded in 2005 as a way to increase commerce in the town of Athens while students were away for summer, has grown into a nine-day festival including dozens of Ohio craft breweries and hundreds of beers. Notable attendees have included Brooklyn Brewery president Steve Hindy and co-founder of Great Lakes Brewing Company Pat Conway. Events typically include keg tappings, live performances at local venues, and the &quot;last call&quot; street festival.

== Parks and recreation ==

Athens recreation facilities include a community recreation center, several city parks and play grounds, public gardens, soccer fields, an arts center called Arts West, two off-leash enclosed dog parks, and an extensive scenic trail system in the city lands, adjacent Strouds Run State Park, and the Blair Preserve owned by the Athens Conservancy. The Athens Skate Park is the second largest skate park in Ohio. The City of Athens Ohio Community Recreation center (Athens Community Center), known simply as &quot;The Rec Center&quot; to locals, offers programming in athletics, childcare, sports camps, community events and more. Located in the East State Street area, the center is accessible from the Hockhocking Adena Bikeway. Recreation facilities include an outdoor swimming pool, a skate park, fitness equipment, an indoor walking and running track, event rental facilities, and playgrounds. The Arts, Parks and Recreation Department actively supports a variety of community recreation initiatives. It sponsors adult summer and fall slow-pitch softball that is popular among residents in Athens and the county. The recreation department has organized men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and co-ed leagues, although the co-ed leagues have seen strongest participation in recent years. Soccer leagues are organized year round, with programs offered through the Community Recreation Center, Ohio University and the Athens Soccer Academy. Youth sports, such as soccer leagues, summer camps and little league, are also supported by local residents. Programming for the arts are facilitated through Arts West, the Dairy Barn, and Ohio University. Sells Park is located on the east side of Athens, near The City of Athens Ohio Community Recreation center. Sells Park comprises 22.5 acres (980,491.87 ft²), and includes Sells Pond, a pond. Strouds Run State Park is located just outside the city, bordering the city line. This park features of wooded hills, including many bluffs and rock shelters, centered around a man-made lake. Camping is available. Both Sells Park and Strouds Run State Park are part of The Athens Trail Network, a multi-use trail network branching out from Sells Park. The City of Athens has recently established the Strouds Ridge Preserve project, currently including some , to save land from development adjacent to the state park. This preserve includes an old-growth forest known as &quot;Hawk Woods&quot;, or, more formally, the Dale &amp; Jacki Riddle State Nature Preserve. Also adjacent to the state park is the Blair Preserve, owned by the Athens Conservancy.

The Hockhocking Adena Bikeway is a multi-use asphalt trail with its main hub (mile marker 0) at the Athens Community Center on East State Street. The trail extends northwest to Robbins&#x27; Crossing and Hocking College in Nelsonville and on to the Rocky Brands complex near the Public Square, and approximately further east along East State Street and US Route 50 to South Canaan Road (Athens County Road 24A). Access points with parking are located at mile 4 at the West State Street Park, mile 10.2 off Rt. 682 in The Plains, and mile 16.4 at Robbins&#x27; Crossing and Hocking College. The trail, which generally follows the course of the Hocking River, provides access to the East State Street commercial areas, Ohio University&#x27;s campus (at South Green and Peden Stadium), The Plains, and Hocking College. It is designed for walking, running, biking, cross-country skiing, skating, and wheelchairs. Additionally several city streets are marked as bike lanes.

Athens is a qualified Tree City USA as recognized by the National Arbor Day Foundation.

=== Trails ===

The Athens Trail Network is a multi-use trail network branching out from Sells Park at the end of Avon Place. A series of twelve trails and connectors branch out into the surrounding woods, heading eastwards to eventually connect with the trails of Strouds Run State Park. The trails are designed for hiking, running, and biking, although some sections are off-limits to bicycles. The trails provide scenic views of the East State Street commercial area and travel past and through notable features such as Sells Pond, Riddle State Nature Preserve (also known as Hawk Woods), Boulder Cove, Turtlehead Cave (also known as Blue Ash Rockhouse), Finger Rock, Pioneer Cemetery, and Dow Lake at Strouds Run State Park. The trail network is maintained by community and university volunteers.

==Government==

Athens is governed by a mayoral-council form of government. Elected officials include mayor, auditor, treasurer, seven council members, and council president. The mayor, auditor, and treasurer are elected for four-year terms. Council members and council president are elected for two-year terms. Four council members represent each of the city&#x27;s four wards. Three council members are elected at-large. Council president only votes in case of a tie vote. City Hall is located in uptown on Washington Street.

Athens is also covered by the Athens County Department of Health, the Athens County Planning Office, and Athens County Job and Family Services. The city of Athens has a strict parking policy. The city has a professional Police Department since 1911 working 24/7 year round. Today the force is made up of about 30 Officers plus a like number of reserve officers and support staff.

== Education ==

Ohio University is a public university located in Athens (30,000+ students) that is situated on an campus. Founded in 1804, it is the oldest university in Ohio, oldest in the Northwest Territory, and ninth oldest public university in the United States. Known as the Bobcats, Ohio University hosts over 250 academic programs, 5,300 employees, and has been recognized by the John Templeton Foundation as one of the top character building institutions in the country. In addition to its main campus in Athens, Ohio University also operates regional campuses in Chillicothe, Cleveland, Dublin, Ironton (Ohio University - Southern), Lancaster, Pickerington, Proctorville, St. Clairsville (Ohio University - Eastern), and Zanesville.

Outside of Ohio University, the residents of Athens are served by the Athens City School District, founded in the late 1840s. Currently it consists of 5 schools: East Elementary (PK-3), Morrison Gordon Elementary (PK-3), The Plains Intermediate School (4-6), Athens Middle School (grades 7–8), and Athens High School home of the &#x27;Bulldogs&#x27; and Joe Burrow Stadium. East Elementary and Morrison Gordon Elementary were replaced with new buildings on the same locations, and opened in Fall 2021, and The Plains Intermediate was significantly remodeled for a re-opening in Fall 2022. In 2019, a new Athens High School was scheduled to begin design and construction in 2024 with a planned Fall 2026 opening. As a result of COVID and other work-related delays, work has not yet begun, but as a result of a tax-funded levy passed in November 2023 giving a $24 million bond to the Athens City School District (ACSD), as well as $28.5 million from the OFCC CFAP, construction will begin in 2025 and be completed within an estimated 18 to 30 months.

On the city&#x27;s east side, Athens has a public library, a branch of the Athens County Public Libraries.

=== Transportation ===
Railroad came to the city in the 1850s, with the last passenger train ending in 1981. That left a few freight trains passing near the city. Until 1981, Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Shenandoah&quot; (Cincinnati - Washington, D.C.) stopped at Athens station. In earlier years, the daily B&amp;O trains, &quot;Diplomat&quot; (St. Louis - Jersey City, NJ) and &quot;National Limited&quot; (St. Louis - Jersey City, NJ) stopped at the station.

The first 4-lane road into and out of the city came in the early 1970s. SR 32 from Athens to Cincinnati was completed in the early 1980s. Four lanes from Athens to Belpre/Parkersburg was completed in the late 1990s on US-50, SR-32 &amp; 7 hooking up with I-77. In the early 2000s, SR-33 &#x27;Super-2&#x27; highway was complete, linking Athens to I-77 at Ravenswood, WVa. In October 2013, the last section of the 4-lane highway was completed, bypassing Nelsonville&#x27;s two lane road on SR-33, linking Athens with Columbus.

Ohio University has a modern regional airport about 15 miles southwest of the city near Albany off US-50/SR-32 called Gordon K. Bush Airport.

<text>A land lab is an area of land that has been set aside for use in biological studies. Thus, it is literally an outdoor laboratory based on an area of land.

Studies may be elementary or advanced. For instance, students may simply be given the task of identifying all the tree species in a land lab, or an advanced student may be doing an intensive survey of the microbial life forms found in a soil sample.

Hands on, tangible, project-base learning is a key aspect of land labs within an educational context. Land labs can exist anywhere with outdoor access: educational campuses, residential neighborhoods, peri-urban settings, urban settings, or even a small courtyard. The driving principle behind land lab education is getting outside and interacting with the world directly.

Land labs are often marked out in plots or transects for studies. A plot may be any size, usually marked out in square meters. This allows for more intensive, delimited studies of changes and inventories of biota. Transects are straight lines at which, at intervals, measurements are taken for a profile of the ecological community.

Land labs serve an important role in giving students access to a natural environment to observe native plants and wildlife, apply STEM concepts with hands on projects, and build a better understanding of how critical biodiversity is for ecological health.

== Common educational projects conducted at a land lab often include ==

* Surveying pollinator species in pollinator gardens or in the native flora
* Restoring old agricultural land back to original landscapes such as: wetlands, prairie, or forest
* Composting biomass to rebuild healthy soil
* Maintaining beehives or other pollinator habitats for moths, ground bees, and other pollinators
* Recording weather conditions to better understand the microclimate
* Conducting nature studies to identify and observe local flora and fauna
* Planting native trees, grasses, and flowers to increase biodiversity
* Encouraging native riparian plant growth along ponds and streams
* Installing bird houses, bat houses and owl houses
* Holding art classes where students can paint flora, fauna and landscapes
* Collecting and removing trash and other man-made pollutants
* Designing low-impact trails and paths for visitors to explore the land lab

== Studying humans needs and sustainability in land labs ==

Learning to produce food, fiber and energy in sustainable ways is a tremendous opportunity for students of all ages within land labs. Students can explore biomass energy, biogas fuels, solar energy, permaculture, composting, organic gardening, and many other facets of sustainability through land labs.

By designing systems that mimic natural processes (biomimicry), we are able to produce food, fiber, and energy in more sustainable ways for local communities. Numerous environmental and economic benefits exist to growing food locally and producing energy locally. These biomimicry inspired systems are circular in nature. Nothing is wasted, as the outputs of one circular system become the inputs of another.

==Circular systems in land labs==
Circular system experiments, promoting a circular economy, are a natural fit for educational land labs. Circular systems function by ensuring that nothing is wasted. Every output of a system becomes an input for another system.

For example: Food scraps feed chickens, chicken manure fertilizes the garden, the garden grows more vegetables, food scraps are then available from the vegetables to feed chickens.

Circular systems that are well-suited for land labs include:

* Biogas methane digesters for generating clean cooking fuel and liquid fertilizer for gardens
* Composting rollers for composting leaves, grass clippings, &amp; food scraps
* Raising black soldier fly larvae on food waste to become feed for chickens or fish 
* Solar panels for providing on-site power
* Free range chickens for providing eggs and manure
* Greenhouses for growing mushrooms and seedlings
* Raised beds for market garden vegetables
* Beehives for garden pollination, honey, and wax
* Rotationally grazed pastures for goats, cattle, pigs, sheep, etc
* Biochar production to improve soil quality and sequester carbon
* Aquaponics systems for growing fish and greens symbiotically
* Rainwater collection systems for retaining water for gardens

== Multi-disciplinary environment within land labs ==
Land labs help to form an ecosystem well suited for long-term project-based learning. Students, teachers, and community members can participate in multi-disciplinary activities ranging from land restoration, animal husbandry, gardening, weather analysis to outdoor art studies.

The multi-disciplinary context within a land lab is perfect for cross-curricular education. The following disciplines and subjects can all tie into land lab activities in an integrated fashion:

* Ecology - nature studies, increasing biodiversity, studying water cycle
* Biology - gardening, agriscience projects, botany
* Sustainable Agriculture - composting, permaculture, local food movement
* Engineering - building aquaponics, rainwater collection, animal shelters
* Chemistry - methane digesters, plant fertilization, solar power
* Life Sciences - carbon cycle, water cycle, composting biomass
* Animal Husbandry - free range chickens, goats, apiary
* Climate Studies - weather observation, weather logging
* History &amp; Culture Studies - local food culture, history of agriculture, natural resources
* Culinary Arts - cooking garden produce using clean energy like biomass, biogas, or solar power
* Multi media arts - designing pollinator landscapes, bird houses, bat houses, murals 
** Painting - nature studies, murals
** Pottery - watering pots, plant pots
** Wood working - pollinator houses, chicken coop

== Goals and outcomes of land lab education experiences ==

Land labs exist as perpetual educational projects that can span years to decades or more. Common goals within a land lab are often:

* Restoring degraded land back into a balanced, biodiverse state
* Establishing an environment for native flora and fauna to thrive
* Building deep, rich soil with an active microbiome
* Growing local produce, herbs, and flowers
* Raising livestock with sustainable, ethical methods
* Producing healthy food for local communities
* Producing local energy to power the land lab operations
* Inspiring young people to care about biodiversity, agriculture, and nature
* Building real-life, practical STEM skills for students and adults
* Building strong communities around unique outdoor projects in nature
* Educating people about the benefits and simple joys found in gardening
== Footprints and Sizes of Land Labs ==
Land labs can be designed in all shapes and sizes. The key attributes of a land lab are typically the following:

* Building an outdoor learning area designated for cross-curricular studies in a STEM environment
* Establishing a focus on increasing biodiversity and restoring local environmental features
* Educating people about meeting humans needs sustainably through agriculture, energy production, shelter, and sanitation
A small land lab could be as little as a courtyard, balcony garden, or a designated patch of land outside of a classroom window. Conversely, larger land lab could encompass hundreds of acres. The ideal size for a flexible land lab space allowing for many different ecological activities and circular systems is between 1/4 of an acre to 5 acres.

== Sustainable societal solutions originating from land labs ==
Land labs are real-life environments by design. The project-based environment encourages students, teachers, and community members to experiment with ecological solutions that can be implemented on a small scale.

Ideally, the solutions and systems implemented in a land lab are transferred beyond the land lab and into the surrounding community. Composting, rainwater catchment, food-waste upcycling with methane digesters and BSF, local food production, harnessing of solar power, and other land lab systems can all be implemented throughout a community at various scales: residential, schools, community gardens, and local businesses.

The purpose of a land lab is to allow students to develop, implement, and learn about practical, sustainable solutions for addressing the five basic physiological needs all humans have:

# The need for clean water
# The need for healthy food
# The need for shelter
# The need for energy
# The need for sanitation

Our industrial systems of providing food, water, energy, shelter, and sanitation have inherent weaknesses to their centralized models. Long supply chains, fossil-fuel dependance, environmental damage, and the fragmented production of goods are common traits to industrial models. Land labs tie these 5 basic human needs together in integrated systems.

Permaculture is a concept of integrating these human needs into local, ecological, human-scale systems. Land labs can be thought of as an education area for promoting creative solutions for meeting these needs, while ensuring the land and local ecology are being restored in the process.

Land labs provide students with real-world experiences to help change their behavior as consumers, and get them more involved with meeting their 5 physiological needs.

Land labs are focused on production rather than just consumption. Western consumer culture makes the provision of our 5 basic physiological needs very abstract and far removed from the daily life of most people.

When these 5 basic needs are abstracted away from consumers, it is easier for the underlying systems providing these needs to operate without supervision to ensure they are ethical and sustainable.

== Mental health benefits for students being outside ==

In today&#x27;s digital world, many students spend inordinate amounts of time on a screen both at home and at school. Inherent limits exist to project based learning that takes place entirely behind a screen or within a classroom.

Land labs help break students out of a digital environment by providing much needed time outdoors. Studies have shown that as our digital landscape of social media has exploded in popularity, depression and mental struggles have increased dramatically in students.

Studies also show that student&#x27;s mental health benefits immensely from being outdoors and participating in hands on projects with meaningful outcomes.

== Waste streams used in land labs ==

Multiple types of local &quot;waste&quot; streams, that can often be obtained freely, can be used to supply a land lab with the raw materials to build soil, generate power, grow food, and restore biodiversity.

* Woodchips - Used for garden paths, mulch, composting &amp; biochar. Often available from local tree companies or municipalities for free.
* Grass clippings - Used for compost and mulch. Available from neighbors and onsite.
* Leaves - Used for compost and mulch. Available from neighbors and onsite.
* Food waste - Used for composting, methane production, liquid fertilizer, and feeding BSF.
* Coffee grounds - Used for composting and BSF production.
* Pallets (Non-treated) - Used for making raised beds, biochar, composting bins, and other structures.
* IBC totes (Food grade) - Used for storing rainwater and liquid fertilizer. 
* 5 Gallon Buckets - Used for collecting food waste, and other waste streams.
* Shredded paper - Used for composting.
* Shredded cardboard - Used for composting.
* Newspapers - Used for composting and mulching.
* Logs - Used for pollinator habitats. Freely availably from many tree companies.
* Reclaimed lumber (non treated) - Used for raised beds, biochar, and small building projects.
* Billboard tarps - Used for rainwater catchment, roofing, and shade cloths. Freely available from billboard companies.

Part of the process of building a land lab is developing relationships with local businesses, neighbors, restaurants, and community members to begin upcycling these wastes into the materials and systems needed within a land lab. Many people have a desire to help students who are working hard on a meaningful community project. Much of the materials listed above can be had for little to no cost as relationships are formed.
