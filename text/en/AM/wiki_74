<text>X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is the emission of characteristic &quot;secondary&quot; (or fluorescent) X-rays from a material that has been excited by being bombarded with high-energy X-rays or gamma rays. The phenomenon is widely used for elemental analysis and chemical analysis, particularly in the investigation of metals, glass, ceramics and building materials, and for research in geochemistry, forensic science, archaeology and art objects such as paintings.

==Underlying physics==
When materials are exposed to short-wavelength X-rays or to gamma rays, ionization of their component atoms may take place. Ionization consists of the ejection of one or more electrons from the atom, and may occur if the atom is exposed to radiation with an energy greater than its ionization energy. X-rays and gamma rays can be energetic enough to expel tightly held electrons from the inner orbitals of the atom. The removal of an electron in this way makes the electronic structure of the atom unstable, and electrons in higher orbitals &quot;fall&quot; into the lower orbital to fill the hole left behind. In falling, energy is released in the form of a photon, the energy of which is equal to the energy difference of the two orbitals involved. Thus, the material emits radiation, which has energy characteristic of the atoms present. The term &quot;fluorescence&quot; is applied to phenomena in which the absorption of radiation of a specific energy results in the re-emission of radiation of a different energy (generally lower).


===Characteristic radiation===
Each element has electronic orbitals of characteristic energy. Following removal of an inner electron by an energetic photon provided by a primary radiation source, an electron from an outer shell drops into its place. There are a limited number of ways in which this can happen, as shown in Figure 1. The main transitions are given names: an L→K transition is traditionally called Kα, an M→K transition is called Kβ, an M→L transition is called Lα, and so on. Each of these transitions yields a fluorescent photon with a characteristic energy equal to the difference in energy of the initial and final orbital. The wavelength of this fluorescent radiation can be calculated from Planck&#x27;s Law:

:formula_1

The fluorescent radiation can be analysed either by sorting the energies of the photons (energy-dispersive analysis) or by separating the wavelengths of the radiation (wavelength-dispersive analysis). Once sorted, the intensity of each characteristic radiation is directly related to the amount of each element in the material. This is the basis of a powerful technique in analytical chemistry. Figure 2 shows the typical form of the sharp fluorescent spectral lines obtained in the wavelength-dispersive method (see Moseley&#x27;s law).

===Primary radiation sources===
In order to excite the atoms, a source of radiation is required, with sufficient energy to expel tightly held inner electrons. Conventional X-ray generators, based on electron bombardment of a heavy metal (i.e. tungsten or rhodium) target are most commonly used, because their output can readily be &quot;tuned&quot; for the application, and because higher power can be deployed relative to other techniques. X-ray generators in the range 20–60 kV are used, which allow excitation of a broad range of atoms. The continuous spectrum consists of &quot;bremsstrahlung&quot; radiation: radiation produced when high-energy electrons passing through the tube are progressively decelerated by the material of the tube anode (the &quot;target&quot;). A typical tube output spectrum is shown in Figure 3.

For portable XRF spectrometers, copper target is usually bombared with high energy electrons, that are produced either by impact laser or by pyroelectric crystals.

Alternatively, gamma ray sources, based on radioactive isotopes (such as 109Cd, 57Co, 55Fe, 238Pu and 241Am) can be used without the need for an elaborate power supply, allowing for easier use in small, portable instruments.

When the energy source is a synchrotron or the X-rays are focused by an optic like a polycapillary, the X-ray beam can be very small and very intense. As a result, atomic information on the sub-micrometer scale can be obtained.

===Dispersion===
In energy-dispersive analysis, the fluorescent X-rays emitted by the material sample are directed into a solid-state detector which produces a &quot;continuous&quot; distribution of pulses, the voltages of which are proportional to the incoming photon energies. This signal is processed by a multichannel analyzer (MCA) which produces an accumulating digital spectrum that can be processed to obtain analytical data.

In wavelength-dispersive analysis, the fluorescent X-rays emitted by the sample are directed into a diffraction grating-based monochromator. The diffraction grating used is usually a single crystal. By varying the angle of incidence and take-off on the crystal, a small X-ray wavelength range can be selected. The wavelength obtained is given by Bragg&#x27;s law:

:formula_2

where &quot;d&quot; is the spacing of atomic layers parallel to the crystal surface.

===Detection===

In energy-dispersive analysis, dispersion and detection are a single operation, as already mentioned above. Proportional counters or various types of solid-state detectors (PIN diode, Si(Li), Ge(Li), silicon drift detector SDD) are used. They all share the same detection principle: An incoming X-ray photon ionizes a large number of detector atoms with the amount of charge produced being proportional to the energy of the incoming photon. The charge is then collected and the process repeats itself for the next photon. Detector speed is obviously critical, as all charge carriers measured have to come from the same photon to measure the photon energy correctly (peak length discrimination is used to eliminate events that seem to have been produced by two X-ray photons arriving almost simultaneously). The spectrum is then built up by dividing the energy spectrum into discrete bins and counting the number of pulses registered within each energy bin. EDXRF detector types vary in resolution, speed and the means of cooling (a low number of free charge carriers is critical in the solid state detectors): proportional counters with resolutions of several hundred eV cover the low end of the performance spectrum, followed by PIN diode detectors, while the Si(Li), Ge(Li) and SDDs occupy the high end of the performance scale.

In wavelength-dispersive analysis, the single-wavelength radiation produced by the monochromator is passed into a chamber containing a gas that is ionized by the X-ray photons. A central electrode is charged at (typically) +1700 V with respect to the conducting chamber walls, and each photon triggers a pulse-like cascade of current across this field. The signal is amplified and transformed into an accumulating digital count. These counts are then processed to obtain analytical data.

===X-ray intensity===

The fluorescence process is inefficient, and the secondary radiation is much weaker than the primary beam. Furthermore, the secondary radiation from lighter elements is of relatively low energy (long wavelength) and has low penetrating power, and is severely attenuated if the beam passes through air for any distance. Because of this, for high-performance analysis, the path from tube to sample to detector is maintained under vacuum (around 10 Pa residual pressure). This means in practice that most of the working parts of the instrument have to be located in a large vacuum chamber. The problems of maintaining moving parts in vacuum, and of rapidly introducing and withdrawing the sample without losing vacuum, pose major challenges for the design of the instrument. For less demanding applications, or when the sample is damaged by a vacuum (e.g. a volatile sample), a helium-swept X-ray chamber can be substituted, with some loss of low-Z (Z = atomic number) intensities.

==Chemical analysis==

The use of a primary X-ray beam to excite fluorescent radiation from the sample was first proposed by Glocker and Schreiber in 1928. Today, the method is used as a non-destructive analytical technique, and as a process control tool in many extractive and processing industries. In principle, the lightest element that can be analysed is beryllium (Z = 4), but due to instrumental limitations and low X-ray yields for the light elements, it is often difficult to quantify elements lighter than sodium (Z = 11), unless background corrections and very comprehensive inter-element corrections are made.

===Energy dispersive spectrometry===

In energy-dispersive spectrometers (EDX or EDS), the detector allows the determination of the energy of the photon when it is detected. Detectors historically have been based on silicon semiconductors, in the form of lithium-drifted silicon crystals, or high-purity silicon wafers.

====Si(Li) detectors====
These consist essentially of a 3–5 mm thick silicon junction type p-i-n diode (same as PIN diode) with a bias of −1000 V across it. The lithium-drifted centre part forms the non-conducting i-layer, where Li compensates the residual acceptors which would otherwise make the layer p-type. When an X-ray photon passes through, it causes a swarm of electron-hole pairs to form, and this causes a voltage pulse. To obtain sufficiently low conductivity, the detector must be maintained at low temperature, and liquid-nitrogen cooling must be used for the best resolution. With some loss of resolution, the much more convenient Peltier cooling can be employed.

====Wafer detectors====
More recently, high-purity silicon wafers with low conductivity have become routinely available. Cooled by the Peltier effect, this provides a cheap and convenient detector, although the liquid nitrogen cooled Si(Li) detector still has the best resolution (i.e. ability to distinguish different photon energies).

====Amplifiers====
The pulses generated by the detector are processed by pulse-shaping amplifiers. It takes time for the amplifier to shape the pulse for optimum resolution, and there is therefore a trade-off between resolution and count-rate: long processing time for good resolution results in &quot;pulse pile-up&quot; in which the pulses from successive photons overlap. Multi-photon events are, however, typically more drawn out in time (photons did not arrive exactly at the same time) than single photon events and pulse-length discrimination can thus be used to filter most of these out. Even so, a small number of pile-up peaks will remain and pile-up correction should be built into the software in applications that require trace analysis. To make the most efficient use of the detector, the tube current should be reduced to keep multi-photon events (before discrimination) at a reasonable level, e.g. 5–20%.

====Processing====
Considerable computer power is dedicated to correcting for pulse-pile up and for extraction of data from poorly resolved spectra. These elaborate correction processes tend to be based on empirical relationships that may change with time, so that continuous vigilance is required in order to obtain chemical data of adequate precision.

Digital pulse processors are widely used in high performance nuclear instrumentation. They are able to effectively reduce pile-up and base line shifts, allowing for easier processing. A low pass filter is integrated, improving the signal to noise ratio. The Digital Pulse Processor requires a significant amount of energy to run, but it provides precise results.

====Usage====
EDX spectrometers are different from WDX spectrometers in that they are smaller, simpler in design and have fewer engineered parts, however the accuracy and resolution of EDX spectrometers are lower than for WDX. EDX spectrometers can also use miniature X-ray tubes or gamma sources, which makes them cheaper and allows miniaturization and portability. This type of instrument is commonly used for portable quality control screening applications, such as testing toys for lead (Pb) content, sorting scrap metals, and measuring the lead content of residential paint. On the other hand, the low resolution and problems with low count rate and long dead-time makes them inferior for high-precision analysis. They are, however, very effective for high-speed, multi-elemental analysis. Field Portable XRF analysers currently on the market weigh less than 2 kg, and have limits of detection on the order of 2 parts per million of lead (Pb) in pure sand. Using a Scanning Electron Microscope and using EDX, studies have been broadened to organic based samples such as biological samples and polymers.


===Wavelength dispersive spectrometry===
In wavelength dispersive spectrometers (WDX or WDS), the photons are separated by diffraction on a single crystal before being detected. Although wavelength dispersive spectrometers are occasionally used to scan a wide range of wavelengths, producing a spectrum plot as in EDS, they are usually set up to make measurements only at the wavelength of the emission lines of the elements of interest. This is achieved in two different ways:

*&quot;Simultaneous&quot; spectrometers have a number of &quot;channels&quot; dedicated to analysis of a single element, each consisting of a fixed-geometry crystal monochromator, a detector, and processing electronics. This allows a number of elements to be measured simultaneously, and in the case of high-powered instruments, complete high-precision analyses can be obtained in under 30 s. Another advantage of this arrangement is that the fixed-geometry monochromators have no continuously moving parts, and so are very reliable. Reliability is important in production environments where instruments are expected to work without interruption for months at a time. Disadvantages of simultaneous spectrometers include relatively high cost for complex analyses, since each channel used is expensive. The number of elements that can be measured is limited to 15–20, because of space limitations on the number of monochromators that can be crowded around the fluorescing sample. The need to accommodate multiple monochromators means that a rather open arrangement around the sample is required, leading to relatively long tube-sample-crystal distances, which leads to lower detected intensities and more scattering. The instrument is inflexible, because if a new element is to be measured, a new measurement channel has to be bought and installed.
*&quot;Sequential&quot; spectrometers have a single variable-geometry monochromator (but usually with an arrangement for selecting from a choice of crystals), a single detector assembly (but usually with more than one detector arranged in tandem), and a single electronic pack. The instrument is programmed to move through a sequence of wavelengths, in each case selecting the appropriate X-ray tube power, the appropriate crystal, and the appropriate detector arrangement. The length of the measurement program is essentially unlimited, so this arrangement is very flexible. Because there is only one monochromator, the tube-sample-crystal distances can be kept very short, resulting in minimal loss of detected intensity. The obvious disadvantage is relatively long analysis time, particularly when many elements are being analysed, not only because the elements are measured in sequence, but also because a certain amount of time is taken in readjusting the monochromator geometry between measurements. Furthermore, the frenzied activity of the monochromator during an analysis program is a challenge for mechanical reliability. However, modern sequential instruments can achieve reliability almost as good as that of simultaneous instruments, even in continuous-usage applications.

====Sample preparation====
In order to keep the geometry of the tube-sample-detector assembly constant, the sample is normally prepared as a flat disc, typically of diameter 20–50 mm. This is located at a standardized, small distance from the tube window. Because the X-ray intensity follows an inverse-square law, the tolerances for this placement and for the flatness of the surface must be very tight in order to maintain a repeatable X-ray flux. Ways of obtaining sample discs vary: metals may be machined to shape, minerals may be finely ground and pressed into a tablet, and glasses may be cast to the required shape. A further reason for obtaining a flat and representative sample surface is that the secondary X-rays from lighter elements often only emit from the top few micrometres of the sample. In order to further reduce the effect of surface irregularities, the sample is usually spun at 5–20 rpm. It is necessary to ensure that the sample is sufficiently thick to absorb the entire primary beam. For higher-Z materials, a few millimetres thickness is adequate, but for a light-element matrix such as coal, a thickness of 30–40 mm is needed.

====Monochromators====
The common feature of monochromators is the maintenance of a symmetrical geometry between the sample, the crystal and the detector. In this geometry the Bragg diffraction condition is obtained.

The X-ray emission lines are very narrow (see figure 2), so the angles must be defined with considerable precision. This is achieved in two ways:

=====Flat crystal with Söller collimators=====
A Söller collimator is a stack of parallel metal plates, spaced a few tenths of a millimeter apart. To improve angular resolution, one must lengthen the collimator, and/or reduce the plate spacing. This arrangement has the advantage of simplicity and relatively low cost, but the collimators reduce intensity and increase scattering, and reduce the area of sample and crystal that can be &quot;seen&quot;. The simplicity of the geometry is especially useful for variable-geometry monochromators.


=====Curved crystal with slits=====
The Rowland circle geometry ensures that the slits are both in focus, but in order for the Bragg condition to be met at all points, the crystal must first be bent to a radius of 2R (where R is the radius of the Rowland circle), then ground to a radius of R. This arrangement allows higher intensities (typically 8-fold) with higher resolution (typically 4-fold) and lower background. However, the mechanics of keeping Rowland circle geometry in a variable-angle monochromator is extremely difficult. In the case of fixed-angle monochromators (for use in simultaneous spectrometers), crystals bent to a logarithmic spiral shape give the best focusing performance. The manufacture of curved crystals to acceptable tolerances increases their price considerably.

====Crystal materials====
An intuitive understanding of X-ray diffraction can be obtained from the Bragg model of diffraction. In this model, a given reflection is associated with a set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing through the centers of the atoms of the crystal lattice. 
The orientation of a particular set of sheets is identified by its three Miller indices (&quot;h&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot;), and let their spacing be noted by &quot;d&quot;. 
William Lawrence Bragg proposed a model in which the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively (constructive interference) when the angle between the plane and the X-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple &quot;n&quot; of the X-ray wavelength λ.(Fig.7)
: formula_3
The desirable characteristics of a diffraction crystal are:
*High diffraction intensity
*High dispersion
*Narrow diffracted peak width
*High peak-to-background
*Absence of interfering elements
*Low thermal coefficient of expansion
*Stability in air and on exposure to X-rays
*Ready availability
*Low cost

Crystals with simple structures tend to give the best diffraction performance. Crystals containing heavy atoms can diffract well, but also fluoresce more in the higher energy region, causing interference. Crystals that are water-soluble, volatile or organic tend to give poor stability.

Commonly used crystal materials include LiF (lithium fluoride), ADP (ammonium dihydrogen phosphate), Ge (germanium), Si (silicon), graphite, InSb (indium antimonide), PE (&quot;tetrakis&quot;-(hydroxymethyl)-methane, also known as pentaerythritol), KAP (potassium hydrogen phthalate), RbAP (rubidium hydrogen phthalate) and TlAP (thallium(I) hydrogen phthalate). In addition, there is an increasing use of &quot;layered synthetic microstructures&quot; (LSMs), which are &quot;sandwich&quot; structured materials comprising successive thick layers of low atomic number matrix, and monatomic layers of a heavy element. These can in principle be custom-manufactured to diffract any desired long wavelength, and are used extensively for elements in the range Li to Mg.

In scientific methods that use X-ray/neutron or electron diffraction the before mentioned planes of a diffraction can be doubled to display higher order reflections. The given planes, resulting from Miller indices, can be calculated for a single crystal. The resulting values for &quot;h, k and l&quot; are then called Laue indices.
So a single crystal can be variable in the way, that many reflection configurations of that crystal can be used to reflect different energy ranges.
The Germanium (Ge111) crystal, for example, can also be used as a Ge333, Ge444 and more.

For that reason the corresponding indices used for a particular experimental setup always get noted behind the crystal material(e.g. Ge111, Ge444)

Notice, that the Ge222 configuration is forbidden due to diffraction rules stating, that all allowed reflections must be with all odd or all even Miller indices that, combined, result in formula_4,
where formula_5 is the order of reflection.

====Elemental analysis lines====
The spectral lines used for elemental analysis of chemicals are selected on the basis of intensity, accessibility by the instrument, and lack of line overlaps. Typical lines used, and their wavelengths, are as follows:
Other lines are often used, depending on the type of sample and equipment available.

====Structural analysis lines====

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is still the most used method for structural analysis of chemical compounds. Yet, with increasing detail on the relation of formula_6-line spectra and the surrounding chemical environment of the ionized metal atom, measurements of the so-called valence-to-core (V2C) energy region become increasingly viable.

Scientists noted that after ionization of 3d-transition metal atom, the formula_6-line intensities and energies shift
with oxidation state of the metal and with the species of ligand(s). Spin states in a compound tend to affect this kind of measurement.

This means, that by intense study of these spectral lines, one can obtain several crucial pieces of information from a sample. Especially, if there are references that have been studied in detail and can be used to make out differences. The information collected from this kind of measurement include:
*Oxidation state of the central metal atom in a compound (shifts of formula_8-mainline in low-spin complexes)
*Spin states of transition metal complexes (general shape of formula_8- and formula_10-mainlines)
*Structural electronic configuration around the central metal atom (determine intensity, broadening, tailing and piloting of formula_11- and formula_12-lines)

These measurements are mostly done at synchrotron facilities, although a number of so-called &quot;in-lab&quot;-spectrometers have been developed and used for pre-beamtime (time at a synchrotron) measurements.

====Detectors====
Detectors used for wavelength dispersive spectrometry need to have high pulse processing speeds in order to cope with the very high photon count rates that can be obtained. In addition, they need sufficient energy resolution to allow filtering-out of background noise and spurious photons from the primary beam or from crystal fluorescence. There are four common types of detector:
*gas flow proportional counters
*sealed gas detectors
*scintillation counters
*semiconductor detectors
Gas flow proportional counters are used mainly for detection of longer wavelengths. Gas flows through it continuously. Where there are multiple detectors, the gas is passed through them in series, then led to waste. The gas is usually 90% argon, 10% methane (&quot;P10&quot;), although the argon may be replaced with neon or helium where very long wavelengths (over 5 nm) are to be detected. The argon is ionised by incoming X-ray photons, and the electric field multiplies this charge into a measurable pulse. The methane suppresses the formation of fluorescent photons caused by recombination of the argon ions with stray electrons. The anode wire is typically tungsten or nichrome of 20–60 μm diameter. Since the pulse strength obtained is essentially proportional to the ratio of the detector chamber diameter to the wire diameter, a fine wire is needed, but it must also be strong enough to be maintained under tension so that it remains precisely straight and concentric with the detector. The window needs to be conductive, thin enough to transmit the X-rays effectively, but thick and strong enough to minimize diffusion of the detector gas into the high vacuum of the monochromator chamber. Materials often used are beryllium metal, aluminised PET film and aluminised polypropylene. Ultra-thin windows (down to 1 μm) for use with low-penetration long wavelengths are very expensive. The pulses are sorted electronically by &quot;pulse height selection&quot; in order to isolate those pulses deriving from the secondary X-ray photons being counted.

Sealed gas detectors are similar to the gas flow proportional counter, except that the gas does not flow through it. The gas is usually krypton or xenon at a few atmospheres pressure. They are applied usually to wavelengths in the 0.15–0.6 nm range. They are applicable in principle to longer wavelengths, but are limited by the problem of manufacturing a thin window capable of withstanding the high pressure difference.

Scintillation counters consist of a scintillating crystal (typically of sodium iodide doped with thallium) attached to a photomultiplier. The crystal produces a group of scintillations for each photon absorbed, the number being proportional to the photon energy. This translates into a pulse from the photomultiplier of voltage proportional to the photon energy. The crystal must be protected with a relatively thick aluminium/beryllium foil window, which limits the use of the detector to wavelengths below 0.25 nm. Scintillation counters are often connected in series with a gas flow proportional counter: the latter is provided with an outlet window opposite the inlet, to which the scintillation counter is attached. This arrangement is particularly used in sequential spectrometers.

Semiconductor detectors can be used in theory, and their applications are increasing as their technology improves, but historically their use for WDX has been restricted by their slow response (see EDX).

====Extracting analytical results====
At first sight, the translation of X-ray photon count-rates into elemental concentrations would appear to be straightforward: WDX separates the X-ray lines efficiently, and the rate of &quot;generation&quot; of secondary photons is proportional to the element concentration. However, the number of photons &quot;leaving the sample&quot; is also affected by the physical properties of the sample: so-called &quot;matrix effects&quot;. These fall broadly into three categories:
*X-ray absorption
*X-ray enhancement
*sample macroscopic effects
All elements &quot;absorb&quot; X-rays to some extent. Each element has a characteristic absorption spectrum which consists of a &quot;saw-tooth&quot; succession of fringes, each step-change of which has wavelength close to an emission line of the element. Absorption attenuates the secondary X-rays leaving the sample. For example, the mass absorption coefficient of silicon at the wavelength of the aluminium Kα line is 50 m2/kg, whereas that of iron is 377 m2/kg. This means that fluorescent X-rays generated by a given concentration of aluminium in a matrix of iron are absorbed about seven times more (that is 377/50) compared with the fluorescent X-rays generated by the same concentration of aluminium, but in a silicon matrix. That would lead to about one seventh of the count rate, once the X-rays are detected. Fortunately, mass absorption coefficients are well known and can be calculated. However, to calculate the absorption for a multi-element sample, the composition must be known. For analysis of an unknown sample, an iterative procedure is therefore used. To derive the mass absorption accurately, data for the concentration of elements not measured by XRF may be needed, and various strategies are employed to estimate these. As an example, in cement analysis, the concentration of oxygen (which is not measured) is calculated by assuming that all other elements are present as standard oxides.

Enhancement occurs where the secondary X-rays emitted by a heavier element are sufficiently energetic to stimulate additional secondary emission from a lighter element. This phenomenon can also be modelled, and corrections can be made provided that the full matrix composition can be deduced.

Sample macroscopic effects consist of effects of inhomogeneities of the sample, and unrepresentative conditions at its surface. Samples are ideally homogeneous and isotropic, but they often deviate from this ideal. Mixtures of multiple crystalline components in mineral powders can result in absorption effects that deviate from those calculable from theory. When a powder is pressed into a tablet, the finer minerals concentrate at the surface. Spherical grains tend to migrate to the surface more than do angular grains. In machined metals, the softer components of an alloy tend to smear across the surface. Considerable care and ingenuity are required to minimize these effects. Because they are artifacts of the method of sample preparation, these effects can not be compensated by theoretical corrections, and must be &quot;calibrated in&quot;. This means that the calibration materials and the unknowns must be compositionally and mechanically similar, and a given calibration is applicable only to a limited range of materials. Glasses most closely approach the ideal of homogeneity and isotropy, and for accurate work, minerals are usually prepared by dissolving them in a borate glass, and casting them into a flat disc or &quot;bead&quot;. Prepared in this form, a virtually universal calibration is applicable.

Further corrections that are often employed include background correction and line overlap correction. The background signal in an XRF spectrum derives primarily from scattering of primary beam photons by the sample surface. Scattering varies with the sample mass absorption, being greatest when mean atomic number is low. When measuring trace amounts of an element, or when measuring on a variable light matrix, background correction becomes necessary. This is really only feasible on a sequential spectrometer. Line overlap is a common problem, bearing in mind that the spectrum of a complex mineral can contain several hundred measurable lines. Sometimes it can be overcome by measuring a less-intense, but overlap-free line, but in certain instances a correction is inevitable. For instance, the Kα is the only usable line for measuring sodium, and it overlaps the zinc Lβ (L2-M4) line. Thus zinc, if present, must be analysed in order to properly correct the sodium value.

==Other spectroscopic methods using the same principle==
It is also possible to create a characteristic secondary X-ray emission using other incident radiation to excite the sample:
*electron beam: electron microprobe;
*ion beam: particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE).
When radiated by an X-ray beam, the sample also emits other radiations that can be used for analysis:
*electrons ejected by the photoelectric effect: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), also called electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA)
The de-excitation also ejects Auger electrons, but Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) normally uses an electron beam as the probe.

Confocal microscopy X-ray fluorescence imaging is a newer technique that allows control over depth, in addition to horizontal and vertical aiming, for example, when analysing buried layers in a painting.

==Instrument qualification==

A 2001 review, addresses the application of portable instrumentation from QA/QC perspectives. It provides a guide to the development of a set of SOPs if regulatory compliance guidelines are not available.

<text>The Wold Newton family is a literary concept derived from a form of crossover fiction developed by the American science fiction writer Philip José Farmer.

==Origins==
In real life a meteorite, called the Wold Cottage meteorite, fell near Wold Newton, Yorkshire, England, on December 13, 1795. 

Farmer suggested in two fictional biographies, &quot;Tarzan Alive: A Definitive Biography of Lord Greystoke&quot; (1972) and &quot;Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life&quot; (1973) that this meteorite caused genetic mutations in the occupants of two passing coaches due to ionization. Many of their descendants were thus endowed with extremely high intelligence and strength, as well as an exceptional capacity and drive to perform good or, as the case may be, evil deeds. The progeny of these travellers are purported to have been the real-life originals of fictionalised characters, both heroic and villainous, over the last few hundred years.

==Members==

As well as Tarzan and Doc Savage, both Lord Peter Wimsey and Sherlock Holmes are descendants of the original families. Other popular characters included by Farmer as members of the Wold Newton family are Solomon Kane; Captain Blood; The Scarlet Pimpernel; Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s nemesis Professor Moriarty; Phileas Fogg; The Time Traveller (main character of &quot;The Time Machine&quot; by H. G. Wells); Allan Quatermain; A. J. Raffles; Professor Challenger; Richard Hannay; Bulldog Drummond; the evil Fu Manchu and his adversary, Sir Denis Nayland Smith; G-8; The Shadow; Sam Spade; Doc Savage&#x27;s cousin Patricia Savage and one of his five assistants, Monk Mayfair; The Spider; Nero Wolfe; Mr. Moto; The Avenger; Philip Marlowe; James Bond; Lew Archer; Travis McGee; Monsieur Lecoq; and Arsène Lupin.

==Universe==
The Wold Newton Universe (or WNU) is a term coined by Win Scott Eckert to denote an expansion of Philip José Farmer&#x27;s original Wold Newton Family concept (introduced in &quot;Tarzan Alive&quot; [1972]). Eckert introduced the term in 1997 on his website, &quot;An Expansion of Philip José Farmer&#x27;s Wold Newton Universe&quot;. Eckert and others use Farmer&#x27;s concept of the Wold Newton Family as a unifying device and to expand the universe that the Wold Newton Family inhabits by including essays in the vein of the Sherlockian &quot;Game,&quot; in which theories are proposed and supported by supplying contextual background information and persuasive argument; by writing fiction authorized by Farmer and Farmer&#x27;s Estate which adds elements and characters to the Wold Newton Family and/or the WNU; by writing other fiction which contains &quot;Easter egg&quot; references to the Wold Newton Family or the WNU, or which otherwise expands the overall mythos; and by documenting crossovers between fictional characters from various media and genres.

Characters incorporated into the WNU are not necessarily blood relatives, descendants, or ancestors of the coach travelers present at the 1795 Wold Cottage meteor strike, but these characters all exist in the same shared fictional universe. Farmer himself penned a number of stories and novels set in what is now termed the Wold Newton Universe; not all characters in Farmer&#x27;s Wold Newton fiction are core members of the Wold Newton Family, but all are linked into the larger WNU via connections with Farmer&#x27;s primary Wold Newton Family works, &quot;Tarzan Alive&quot; and &quot;Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life&quot;.

===Depowering superheroes===
Among the membership of the WNU are comic book superheroes and supervillains whose published exploits, by their very nature, often prove difficult to reconcile with Farmer&#x27;s original framework. But WNU’s root conceit has always been that characters known by the reader as fictional actually lived or are yet living, with their adventures based on true events embroidered by the genre authors who serve as their &quot;biographers.&quot; Therefore, in order for aspects of larger fictional universes to adhere to WNU’s overall continuity and believability, certain accounts of these new characters&#x27; lives have been labeled as a distortion of actual events or dismissed as complete fabrication.

===Additional genres===
Eckert and other post-Farmerian authors—admirers of Farmer&#x27;s Wold Newton biographies and fiction who write in Eckert’s vein—have published numerous further fictional characters in many literary styles and media, including works emulating the aesthetics of the Renaissance, Romantic and Victorian eras; such subgenres of prose fiction as Gothic and steampunk; the fairy tale, mythology and folklore categories of traditional stories; publication formats like the graphic novel, the comic book, the pulp magazine and the penny dreadful; and the non-print media of motion pictures, television shows, radio programs and video games.

===References===
The expanded WNU is documented in articles by WNU experts on the various WNU-themed websites; in &quot;Myths for the Modern Age: Philip José Farmer&#x27;s Wold Newton Universe&quot; (edited by Win Scott Eckert, MonkeyBrain Books, 2005, a 2007 Locus Award finalist); in various issues of &quot;Farmerphile: The Magazine of Philip José Farmer&quot;, the prozine dedicated to and authorized by Farmer and published by Michael Croteau, webmaster of the Official Philip José Farmer Home Page ; and in various stories, novellas, and novels authorized by Farmer or by Farmer&#x27;s Estate, such as &quot;Tales of the Wold Newton Universe&quot; (edited by Win Scott Eckert and Christopher Paul Carey, Titan Books, 2013) and various books published by Meteor House.

Going beyond the WNU is Eckert&#x27;s &quot;Crossover Universe,&quot; published in book form by Black Coat Press in two volumes in 2010 as &quot;Crossovers: A Secret Chronology of the World,&quot; in which a massive continuity is created in a &quot;six degrees&quot; game of linked crossover stories. Eckert&#x27;s &quot;Crossover Universe&quot; work is being carried forward by Sean Levin. The important distinction between a Wold Newton story and a crossover story is discussed at length by Eckert and Carey in their introduction to &quot;Tales of the Wold Newton Universe.&quot;

==Similar creations==
An earlier proponent of this sort of fiction was William S. Baring-Gould, who wrote a fictional biography of Sherlock Holmes entitled &quot;Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street&quot;.

In 1977 C. W. Scott-Giles, an expert in heraldry who served as Fitzalan Pursuivant of Arms Extraordinary, published a history of Lord Peter Wimsey&#x27;s family, going back to 1066 (but describing the loss of the family tree going back to Adam and Eve); the book is based on material from Scott-Giles&#x27;s correspondence with Dorothy L. Sayers, who wrote at least two of the family anecdotes in the book, one of them in mediaeval French. For details, see Duke of Denver.

Warren Ellis&#x27;s comic book series &quot;Planetary&quot; has a similar premise of fitting many different superhero, science fiction, and fantasy elements into the same universe. (For the most part, constrained by the needs of the story and copyright, Ellis does not use the originals but rather his own re-interpretations of the archetypes).

Author Kim Newman has stated that his &quot;Anno Dracula&quot; series was partially inspired by the Wold Newton family.

The anthology series &quot;Tales of the Shadowmen&quot; edited by Jean-Marc Lofficier is also based on the Wold Newton concept and includes characters from French literature.

Alan Moore did likewise in his &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; comic book (and its sequels), in which various Victorian-era literary characters meet and join the eponymous League (though they are not descended from a single family). Over the course of the series, the world of the League incorporates many works of fiction from many different eras – not just Victorian literature – into its universe. Moore calls the Wold Newton stories &quot;a seminal influence upon the League&quot;.

<text>The Ottawa Lynx were a Minor League Baseball team that competed in the Triple-A International League (IL) from 1993 to 2007. The team&#x27;s home field was Lynx Stadium in Ottawa, Ontario. Over 15 seasons, the team was an affiliate of the Montreal Expos (1993–2002), Baltimore Orioles (2003–2006), and Philadelphia Phillies (2007). At the time, it was the only IL franchise in Canada.

In late August 2006, the league approved the conditions to negotiate the sale of the team. The new owners moved the team to Allentown, Pennsylvania, beginning with the 2008 season, where it became known as the Lehigh Valley IronPigs.

== History ==

In 1991, Ottawa businessman and then Ottawa 67&#x27;s owner Howard Darwin was successful in applying to the IL for an expansion franchise to begin play in 1993, at a cost of $5 million. The Lynx became the second IL franchise to play in Ottawa, after the former Ottawa Giants and Ottawa Athletics of the 1950s. The application was contingent on the City of Ottawa building a baseball stadium for the team. Lynx Stadium was completed in time for the 1993 season.

The Lynx began play in 1993, serving as the top farm team for the Montreal Expos. The team won the International League championship in 1995, the only time it would do so. During this period, the Lynx featured such future Major League Baseball players as Rondell White, Cliff Floyd, Matt Stairs, Kirk Rueter, and F.P. Santangelo. The Lynx eventually retired two numbers: Santangelo&#x27;s 24, and Jamey Carroll&#x27;s 3.

In 2000, Darwin sold his shares in the team to Ray Pecor for $7 million. According to news reports, Pecor lost $1 million annually on the team due to low attendance.

In 2003, the Lynx were not given any assurances from either the Montreal Expos or Major League Baseball on the long-term future of the Expos. They became the Triple-A affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles on September 24, 2002. As a result, Montreal shifted its affiliation to the Edmonton Trappers of the Pacific Coast League. The Lynx&#x27;s working agreement with the Orioles ended when the latter signed a Player Development Contract with the Norfolk Tides on September 25, 2006.

In 2006, the ball club was sold to Joe Finley and Craig Stein, while Pecor maintained a minority stake. Finley and Stein declared their intention to move the team to Allentown, Pennsylvania, for the 2008 season, where a new stadium was set to begin construction that September (now built as Coca-Cola Park). The owners, facing a lawsuit from the City of Ottawa if they moved the Lynx, filed a lawsuit of their own against the City of Ottawa on October 17, 2006, seeking $10.75 million in damages claiming that the city failed to provide enough parking spaces, which, the team alleged, was a violation of its lease. The location far from the city centre might have contributed to the attendance problem.

The team played its last game in Ottawa on September 3, 2007, in front of a crowd of 7,461 people, losing to the Syracuse Chiefs, 8–5. The Ottawa Lynx ultimately won exactly 1,000 games before leaving Ottawa.

== Titles ==
The Lynx won the Governors&#x27; Cup, the championship of the International League, once by defeating the Norfolk Tides in 1995.

<text>The Wold Cottage meteorite (also called the Wold Newton meteorite) fell near Wold Cottage farm in 1795, a few miles away from the village of Wold Newton in Yorkshire, England.

==The meteorite==
The stone fell at around 3 o&#x27;clock, on 13 December 1795, landing within a few yards of ploughman John Shipley. It created a crater approximately across, and embedded itself in the underlying chalk rock to a depth of , passing through of topsoil. The fall was observed by several people, who described a dark body passing through the air. As discovered at its landing point, the stone was warm and smoking; several people reported sounds of explosions as it fell. The owner of the land was Major Edward Topham, a well-known public figure, an ex-soldier, playwright and newspaper proprietor; he publicised the find and exhibited the meteorite publicly at Piccadilly in London.

The stone initially weighed . James Sowerby, a naturalist, acquired the meteorite in 1804. The meteorite was later acquired by the British Museum in 1835.

The meteorite can nowadays be seen in the Natural History Museum in London.

===Analysis and research===
Early analyses recorded two parts of the stone, an earthy part, and a malleable part. The earthy part analysed as containing silicon, magnesium, iron, and a small amount of nickel, of which some parts of the iron and nickel were in the elemental state; the earthy substance was similar to kaolin (weathered feldspar), but relatively tough. The malleable parts also contained iron and nickel, the majority iron. A form of iron pyrites (iron sulphur compound) was also reported present. Modern science records the meteorite as a L6 ordinary chondrite.

The Wold Cottage meteorite was the largest meteorite observed to fall in Britain, and is the second-largest recorded in Europe (after the Ensisheim meteorite). The meteorite and evidence given about its fall contributed to the debate concerning whether extraterrestrial matter existed or not, and towards the early scientific study of meteorites.

===The monument===

A monument was erected on the location of the stone&#x27;s impact, by Major Topham, on whose property the stone had fallen. The structure was built of brick square and high, with a plaque on one face.
==In fiction==
The event was used by the science fiction writer Philip José Farmer in his &quot;biographies&quot; of fictional characters (&quot;Tarzan Alive&quot; and &quot;Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life&quot;) as the basis for a literary premise commonly referred to as the Wold Newton family. The film &quot;Robinson in Ruins&quot; would also refer to the event, with the main character, Robinson, seeing it showing meteorites always fall at the time of significant events, in this case the 1795 amendment to the Settlement Act which allowed capitalism to develop faster in England.

The meteorite plays quite a central role in the 2019 detective novel &quot;Sherlock Holmes &amp; The Christmas Demon&quot; by British author James Lovegrove.

<doc id="72080" wikidata="Q477243" url="?curid=72080" title="Charvaka">
<text>Charvaka (; IAST: Cārvāka), also known as Lokāyata, is an ancient school of Indian materialism. It&#x27;s an example of the atheistic schools in the Ancient Indian philosophies. Charvaka holds direct perception, empiricism, and conditional inference as proper sources of knowledge, embraces philosophical skepticism, and rejects ritualism. In other words, the Charvaka epistemology states that whenever one infers a truth from a set of observations or truths, one must acknowledge doubt; inferred knowledge is conditional.

It was a well-attested belief system in ancient India. Brihaspati, a philosopher, is traditionally referred to as the founder of Charvaka or Lokāyata philosophy, although some scholars dispute this. Charvaka developed during the Hindu reformation period in the first millennium BCE, after Buddhism was established by Gautama Buddha and Jainism was re-organized by Parshvanatha. Its teachings have been compiled from historic secondary literature such as those found in the shastras, sutras, and Indian epic poetry.

Charvaka is categorized as one of the &quot;nāstika&quot; or &quot;heterodox&quot; schools of Indian philosophy.

==Etymology and meaning==
The etymology of Charvaka (Sanskrit: चार्वाक) is uncertain. Bhattacharya quotes the grammarian Hemacandra, to the effect that the word cārvāka is derived from the root , &#x27;to chew&#x27; : &quot;A Cārvāka chews the self (carvatyātmānaṃ cārvākaḥ). Hemacandra refers to his own grammatical work, Uṇādisūtra 37, which runs as follows: mavāka-śyāmāka-vārtāka-jyontāka-gūvāka-bhadrākādayaḥ. Each of these words ends with the āka suffix and is formed irregularly.&quot; This may also allude to the philosophy&#x27;s hedonistic precepts of &quot;eat, drink, and be merry&quot;.

Others believe it to mean &quot;agreeable speech&quot; or pejoratively, &quot;sweet-tongued&quot;, from Sanskrit&#x27;s &quot;agreeable&quot; and &quot;speech&quot; (which becomes in the nominative singular and in compounds). Yet another hypothesis is that it is eponymous, with the founder of the school being Charvaka, a disciple of Brihaspati.

===As Lokayata===
According to claims of Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, the traditional name of Charvaka is Lokayata. It was called Lokayata because it was prevalent () among the people (), and meant the world-outlook of the people. The dictionary meaning of Lokāyata (लोकायत) signifies &quot;directed towards, aiming at the world, worldly&quot;.

In early to mid 20th century literature, the etymology of &quot;Lokayata&quot; has been given different interpretations, in part because the primary sources are unavailable, and the meaning has been deduced from divergent secondary literature. The name Lokāyata, for example, is found in Chanakya&#x27;s &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, which refers to three &quot;ānvīkṣikīs&quot; (अन्वीक्षिकी, literally, examining by reason, logical philosophies) – Yoga, Samkhya and Lokāyata. However, Lokāyata in the Arthashastra is not anti-Vedic, but implies Lokāyata to be a part of Vedic lore. Lokāyata here refers to logic or science of debate (&quot;disputatio&quot;, &quot;criticism&quot;). Rudolf Franke translated &quot;Lokayata&quot; in German as &quot;logisch beweisende Naturerklärung&quot;, that is &quot;logically proving explanation of nature&quot;.

In 8th century CE Jaina literature, &quot;Saddarsanasamuccaya&quot; by Haribhadra, &quot;Lokayata&quot; is stated to be the Hindu school where there is &quot;no God, no samsara (rebirth), no karma, no duty, no fruits of merit, no sin.&quot;

The Buddhist Sanskrit work Divyavadana (ca. 200–350 CE) mentions &quot;Lokayata&quot;, where it is listed among subjects of study, and with the sense of &quot;technical logical science&quot;. Shantarakshita and Adi Shankara use the word &quot;lokayata&quot; to mean materialism, with the latter using the term Lokāyata, not Charvaka.

In Silāṅka&#x27;s commentary on &quot;Sūtra-kṛtāṅgna&quot;, the oldest Jain Āgama Prakrt literature, he has used four terms for Cārvāka viz. (1) Bṛhaspatya (2) Lokāyata (3) Bhūtavādin (4) Vāmamārgin.

==Origin==
The tenets of the Charvaka atheistic doctrines can be traced to the relatively later composed layers of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, while substantial discussions on the Charvaka is found in post-Vedic literature. The primary literature of Charvaka, such as the &quot;Brhaspati Sutra&quot;, is missing or lost. Its theories and development has been compiled from historic secondary literature such as those found in the shastras (such as the Arthashastra), sutras and the epics (the Mahabharata and Ramayana) of Hinduism as well as from the dialogues of Gautama Buddha and Jain literature.

In the oldest of the &quot;Upanishads&quot;, in chapter 2 of the &quot;Brhadāranyaka&quot; (ca. 900 BCE), the leading theorist Yājnavalkya states in a passage often referred to by the irreligious, &quot;So I say, after death there is no awareness.&quot;

This declaration arises in a discussion with his female philosophy interlocutor, Maitreyi, who notices that this might mean there is no afterlife – no religion: &quot;After Yājñavalkya said this, Maitreyi exclaimed: &#x27;Now, sir, you have totally confused me by saying &#x27;after death there is no awareness&#x27;.&quot;

Substantial discussions about the Charvaka doctrines are found in texts during the 6th century BCE because of the emergence of competing philosophies such as Buddhism and Jainism. Bhattacharya posits that Charvaka may have been one of several atheistic, materialist schools that existed in ancient India during the 6th century BCE. Though there is evidence of its development in Vedic era, the Charvaka school of philosophy predated the Āstika schools as well as being a philosophical predecessor to subsequent or contemporaneous philosophies such as Ajñāna, Ājīvika, Jainism and Buddhism in the classical period of Indian philosophy.

The earliest Charvaka scholar in India whose texts still survive is Ajita Kesakambali. Although materialist schools existed before Charvaka, it was the only school which systematised materialist philosophy by setting them down in the form of aphorisms in the 6th century BCE. There was a base text, a collection sūtras or aphorisms and several commentaries were written to explicate the aphorisms. This should be seen in the wider context of the oral tradition of Indian philosophy. It was in the 6th century BCE onwards, with the emergent popularity of Buddhism, that ancient schools started codifying and writing down the details of their philosophy.

E. W. Hopkins, in his &quot;The Ethics of India&quot; (1924), claims that Charvaka philosophy predated Jainism and Buddhism, mentioning &quot;the old Cārvāka or materialist of the 6th century BC&quot;. Rhys Davids assumes that &quot;lokāyata&quot; in ca. the 5th century BC came to mean &quot;skepticism&quot; in general without yet being organised as a philosophical school. This proves that it had already existed for centuries and had become a generic term by 600 BCE. Its methodology of skepticism is included in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Ayodhya kanda, chapter 108, where Jabāli tries to persuade Rāma to accept the kingdom by using nāstika arguments (Rāma refutes him in chapter 109):
There are alternate theories behind the origins of Charvaka. Bṛhaspati is sometimes referred to as the founder of Charvaka or Lokāyata philosophy, although other scholars dispute this. states that a philosopher named Charvaka lived in or about the 6th century BCE, who developed the premises of this Indian philosophy in the form of &quot;Brhaspati Sutra&quot;. These sutras predate 150 BCE, because they are mentioned in the &quot;Mahābhāṣya&quot; (7.3.45).

Arthur Llewellyn Basham, citing the Buddhist &quot;Samaññaphala Sutta&quot;, suggests six schools of heterodox, pre-Buddhist and pre-Jain, atheistic Indian traditions in 6th century BCE, that included Charvakas and Ajivikas. Charvaka was a living philosophy up to the 12th century in India&#x27;s historical timeline, after which this system seems to have disappeared without leaving any trace.

==Philosophy==
The Charvaka school of philosophy had a variety of atheistic and materialistic beliefs. They held perception and direct experiments to be the valid and reliable source of knowledge.

===Epistemology===
The Charvaka epistemology holds perception as the primary and proper source of knowledge, while inference is held as prone to being either right or wrong and therefore conditional or invalid. Perceptions are of two types, for Charvaka, external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind. Inference is described as deriving a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths. To Charvakas, inference is useful but prone to error, as inferred truths can never be without doubt. Inference is good and helpful, it is the validity of inference that is suspect – sometimes in certain cases and often in others. To the Charvakas there were no reliable means by which the efficacy of inference as a means of knowledge could be established.

Charvaka&#x27;s epistemological argument can be explained with the example of fire and smoke. Kamal states that when there is smoke (middle term), one&#x27;s tendency may be to leap to the conclusion that it must be caused by fire (major term in logic). While this is often true, it need not be universally true, everywhere or all the times, stated the Charvaka scholars. Smoke can have other causes. In Charvaka epistemology, as long as the relation between two phenomena, or observation and truth, has not been proven as unconditional, it is an uncertain truth. In this Indian philosophy such a method of reasoning, that is jumping to conclusions or inference, is prone to flaw. Charvakas further state that full knowledge is reached when we know all observations, all premises and all conditions. But the absence of conditions, state Charvakas, can not be established beyond doubt by perception, as some conditions may be hidden or escape our ability to observe. They acknowledge that every person relies on inference in daily life, but to them if we act uncritically, we err. While our inferences sometimes are true and lead to successful action, it is also a fact that sometimes inference is wrong and leads to error. Truth then, state Charvaka, is not an unfailing character of inference, truth is merely an accident of inference, and one that is separable. We must be skeptics, question what we know by inference, question our epistemology.

This epistemological proposition of Charvakas was influential among various schools of Indian philosophies, by demonstrating a new way of thinking and re-evaluation of past doctrines. Hindu, Buddhist and Jain scholars extensively deployed Charvaka insights on inference in rational re-examination of their own theories.

====Comparison with other schools of Hinduism====
Charvaka epistemology represents minimalist &quot;pramāṇas&quot; (epistemological methods) in Hindu philosophy. The other schools of Hinduism developed and accepted multiple valid forms of epistemology. To Charvakas, &quot;Pratyakṣa&quot; (perception) was the one valid way to knowledge and other means of knowledge were either always conditional or invalid. While the Charvaka school accepted just one valid means for knowledge, in other schools of Hinduism they ranged between 2 and 6. Advaita Vedanta scholars considered six means of valid knowledge and to truths: &quot;Pratyakṣa&quot; (perception), &quot;Anumāna&quot; (inference), &quot;Upamāna&quot; (comparison and analogy), &quot;Arthāpatti&quot; (postulation), &quot;Anupalabdhi&quot; (non-perception, cognitive proof) and &quot;Śabda&quot; (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).

===Metaphysics===
Since none of the means of knowing were found to be worthy to establish the invariable connection between middle term and predicate, Charvakas concluded that the inference could not be used to ascertain metaphysical truths. Thus, to Charvakas, the step which the mind takes from the knowledge of something to infer the knowledge of something else could be accounted for by its being based on a former perception or by its being in error. Cases where inference was justified by the result were seen only to be mere coincidences.

Therefore, Charvakas denied metaphysical concepts like reincarnation, an extracorporeal soul, the efficacy of religious rites, other worlds (heaven and hell), fate and accumulation of merit or demerit through the performance of certain actions. Charvakas also rejected the use of supernatural causes to describe natural phenomena. To them all natural phenomena was produced spontaneously from the inherent nature of things.
=== Ethics ===
The Charvaka school is commonly associated with egoism, emphasizing the individual&#x27;s ends over others. It rejects ethical systems based on supernatural beliefs, advocating pleasure as the only intrinsic good, and promoting hedonism. It also opposes utilitarianism, which seeks collective pleasure, maintaining that individuals should prioritize their own interests and only benefit society if it serves them. Some scholars argue that the Charvaka school is nihilistic, focusing solely on rejecting concepts like &quot;The Good&quot; and divinity, rather than actively promoting hedonism.

===Consciousness and afterlife===

The Charvaka did not believe in karma, rebirth or an afterlife. To them, all attributes that represented a person, such as thinness, fatness, etc., resided in the body. The &quot;Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha&quot; states the Charvaka position as follows,
===Pleasure===
Charvaka believed that there was nothing wrong with sensual pleasure. Since it is impossible to have pleasure without pain, Charvaka thought that wisdom lay in enjoying pleasure and avoiding pain as far as possible. Unlike many of the Indian philosophies of the time, Charvaka did not believe in austerities or rejecting pleasure out of fear of pain and held such reasoning to be foolish.

The &quot;Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha&quot; states the Charvaka position on pleasure and hedonism as follows,
The scholar Bhattacharya argues that the common belief that &quot;all materialists are nothing but sensualists&quot; is a misconception, as no authentic Carvaka aphorism have been cited by the movement&#x27;s opponents to support this view.

===Religion===
Charvakas rejected many of the standard religious conceptions of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Ajivikas, such as an afterlife, reincarnation, samsara, karma and religious rites. They were critical of the Vedas, as well as Buddhist scriptures.

The &quot;Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha&quot; with commentaries by Madhavacharya describes the Charvakas as critical of the Vedas, materialists without morals and ethics. To Charvakas, the text states, the Vedas suffered from several faults – errors in transmission across generations, untruth, self-contradiction and tautology. The Charvakas pointed out the disagreements, debates and mutual rejection by &quot;karmakanda&quot; Vedic priests and &quot;jñānakanda&quot; Vedic priests, as proof that either one of them is wrong or both are wrong, as both cannot be right.

Charvakas, according to &quot;Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha&quot; verses 10 and 11, declared the Vedas to be incoherent rhapsodies whose only usefulness was to provide livelihood to priests. They also held the belief that Vedas were invented by man, and had no divine authority.

Charvakas rejected the need for ethics or morals, and suggested that &quot;while life remains, let a man live happily, let him feed on ghee even though he runs in debt&quot;.

The Jain scholar Haribhadra, in the last section of his text &quot;Saddarsanasamuccaya&quot;, includes Charvaka in his list of six &quot;darśanas&quot; of Indian traditions, along with Buddhism, Nyaya-Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Jainism and Jaiminiya. Haribhadra notes that Charvakas assert that there is nothing beyond the senses, consciousness is an emergent property, and that it is foolish to seek what cannot be seen.

The accuracy of these views, attributed to Charvakas, has been contested by scholars.

===Public administration===
An extract from &quot;Aaine-Akbari&quot; (vol.III, tr. by H. S. Barrett, pp217–218) written by Abul Fazl, the famous historian of Akbar&#x27;s court, mentions a symposium of philosophers of all faiths held in 1578 at Akbar&#x27;s insistence. The account is given by the historian Vincent Smith, in his article titled &quot;The Jain Teachers of Akbar&quot;. Some Carvaka thinkers are said to have participated in the symposium. Under the heading &quot;Nastika&quot; Abul Fazl has referred to the good work, judicious administration and welfare schemes that were emphasised by the Charvaka law-makers. Somadeva has also mentioned the Charvaka method of defeating the enemies of the nation.

==Mention in &quot;Mahabharata&quot;==
In the epic Mahabharata, Book 12 Chapter 39, a rakshasa who dresses up like a Brahmin and appoints himself as spokesperson for all Brahmins is named &quot;Charvaka&quot;. Charvaka criticizes Yudhishthira for killing his kinsmen, superiors, and teacher, and claims that all the Brahmins are uttering maledictions to him. Yudhishthira is ashamed of this, but the Brahmin Vaishampayana reassures him. The Brahmins, now filled with rage, destroy Charvaka with the power of their mantras.

==Mention in other works==
No independent works on Charvaka philosophy can be found except for a few sūtras attributed to Brihaspati. The 8th century &quot;Tattvopaplavasimha&quot; of Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa with Madhyamaka influence is a significant source of Charvaka philosophy. Shatdarshan Samuchay and Sarvadarśanasaṅ̇graha of Vidyaranya are a few other works which elucidate Charvaka thought.

One of the widely studied references to the Charvaka philosophy is the &quot;Sarva-darśana-saṅgraha&quot; (etymologically all-philosophy-collection), a famous work of 14th century Advaita Vedanta philosopher Mādhava Vidyāraṇya from South India, which starts with a chapter on the Charvaka system. After invoking, in the Prologue of the book, the Hindu gods Shiva and Vishnu (&quot;by whom the earth and rest were produced&quot;), Vidyāraṇya asks, in the first chapter:
Sanskrit poems and plays like the Naiṣadha-carita, Prabodha-candrodaya, Āgama-dambara, Vidvanmoda-taraṅgiṇī and Kādambarī contain representations of the Charvaka thought. However, the authors of these works were thoroughly opposed to materialism and tried to portray the Charvaka in an unfavourable light. Therefore, their works should only be accepted critically.

===Loss of original works===

There was no continuity in the Charvaka tradition after the 12th century. Whatever is written on Charvaka post this is based on second-hand knowledge, learned from preceptors to disciples and no independent works on Charvaka philosophy can be found. Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of Charvaka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of its ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition:
&quot;Though materialism in some form or other has always been present in India, and occasional references are found in the Vedas, the Buddhistic literature, the Epics, as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism, nor any organised school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess. But almost every work of the other schools states, for refutation, the materialistic views. Our knowledge of Indian materialism is chiefly based on these.&quot;
===Controversy on reliability of sources===
 states that the claims against Charvaka of hedonism, lack of any morality and ethics and disregard for spirituality is from texts of competing religious philosophies (Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism). Its primary sources, along with commentaries by Charvaka scholars, are missing or lost. This reliance on indirect sources raises the question of reliability and whether there was a bias and exaggeration in representing the views of Charvakas. Bhattacharya points out that multiple manuscripts are inconsistent, with key passages alleging hedonism and immorality missing in many manuscripts of the same text.

The &quot;Skhalitapramathana Yuktihetusiddhi&quot; by Āryadevapāda, in a manuscript found in Tibet, discusses the Charvaka philosophy, but attributes a theistic claim to Charvakas - that happiness in this life, and the only life, can be attained by worshiping gods and defeating demons. Toso posits that as Charvaka philosophy&#x27;s views spread and were widely discussed, non-Charvakas such as Āryadevapāda added certain points of view that may not be of the Charvakas&#x27;.

Buddhists, Jains, Advaita Vedantins and Nyāya philosophers considered the Charvakas as one of their opponents and tried to refute their views. These refutations are indirect sources of Charvaka philosophy. The arguments and reasoning approaches Charvakas deployed were so significant that they continued to be referred to, even after all the authentic Charvaka/Lokāyata texts had been lost. However, the representation of the Charvaka thought in these works is not always firmly grounded in first-hand knowledge of Charvaka texts and should be viewed critically.

Likewise, states Bhattacharya, the charge of hedonism against Charvaka might have been exaggerated. Countering the argument that the Charvakas opposed all that was good in the Vedic tradition, states, &quot;It may be said from the available material that Cārvākas hold truth, integrity, consistency, and freedom of thought in the highest esteem.&quot;

=== Influence on Europe and China ===
According to reports, the Europeans were surprised by the openness and rational doubts of the Mughal emperor Akbar and the Indians. In Pierre De Jarric&#x27;s &quot;Histoire&quot; (1610), based on the Jesuit reports, the Mughal emperor is compared to an atheist himself: &quot;Thus we see in this Prince the common fault of the atheist, who refuses to make reason subservient to faith (...)&quot;

Hannah Chapelle Wojciehowski writes this concerning the Jesuit descriptions in the paper &quot;East-West Swerves: Cārvāka Materialism and Akbar&#x27;s Religious Debates at Fatehpur Sikri&quot; (2015):&quot;...The information they sent back to Europe was disseminated widely in both Catholic and Protestant countries (...) A more detailed understanding of Indian philosophies, including Cārvāka, began to emerge in Jesuit missionary writings by the early to mid-seventeenth century.&quot;The Jesuit Roberto De Nobili wrote in 1613 that the &quot;Logaidas&quot; (Lokayatas) &quot;hold the view that the elements themselves are god&quot;. Some decades later, Heinrich Roth, who studied Sanskrit in Agra ca. 1654–60, translated the &quot;Vedantasara&quot; by the influential Vedantic commentator Sadananda (14th). This text depicts four different schools of the Carvaka philosophies.

Wojciehowski notes: &quot;Rather than proclaiming a Cārvāka renaissance in Akbar&#x27;s court, it would be safer to suggest that the ancient school of materialism never really went away.&quot;

In &quot;Classical Indian Philosophy&quot; (2020), by Peter Adamson and Jonardon Ganeri, they mention a lecture by Henry T. Coolebrooke in 1827 on the schools of the Carvaka/Lokayata materialists. Adamson and Ganeri compare the Carvakas to the &quot;emergentism in the philosophy of mind,&quot; which is traced back to John Stuart Mill.

They write that Mill &quot;sounds like a follower of Brhaspati, founder of the Cārvāka system, when he writes in his &quot;System of Logic&quot; that &#x27;All organised bodies are composed of parts, similar to those composing inorganic nature (...)

The historian of ideas Dag Herbjørnsrud has pointed out that the Charvaka schools influenced China: &quot;This Indian-Chinese materialist connection is documented in a little-known but groundbreaking paper by professor Huang Xinchuan, &quot;Lokayata and Its Influence in China,&quot; published in Chinese in 1978 (English version in the quarterly journal &quot;Social Sciences&quot; in March 1981). Xinchuan, a senior researcher at the China Academy of Social Science, demonstrates how the Indian Lokāyata schools exercised an influence on ancient Chinese over the centuries. He lists 62 classical texts in China that refer to these Indian material-atheistic schools, from the &quot;Brahmajala Sutra&quot; translated by Zhi Qian (Chih Chien, 223–253), of the Kingdom of Wu, to &quot;An Explanation for Brahmajala Sutra&quot; written by Ji Guang (Chi-kuang, 1528–1588) of the Ming Dynasty. In addition, Xinchuan mentions four texts on Lokayata in Chinese by Japanese Buddhist writers.&quot;

Xinchuan&#x27;s paper explains how the Buddhists regarded the Lokayatikas as fellow-travellers of the Confucian and the Taoist Schools, and how they launched an attack on them because of their materialistic views. Xinchuan cites, as also Rasik Vihari Joshi noted in 1987, dozens of texts where Chinese classical works describe Lokayata either as &quot;Shi-Jian-Xing&quot; (&quot;doctrine prevailing in the world&quot;), &quot;Wu-Hou-Shi-Lun&quot; (&quot;doctrine of denying after-life&quot;), or refers to &quot;Lu-Ka-Ye-Jin&quot; (the &quot;Lokāyata Sutra&quot;).

==Commentators==
Aviddhakarṇa, Bhavivikta, Kambalasvatara, Purandara and Udbhatabhatta are the five commentators who developed the Carvaka/Lokayata system in various ways.

==Influence==
* Dharmakirti, a 7th-century philosopher deeply influenced by Carvaka philosophy wrote in Pramanvartik.
* Pyrrho
* The influence of this heterodox doctrine is seen in other spheres of Indian thought.

==Organisations==
* The Charvaka Ashram founded by Boddu Ramakrishna in 1973 has stood the test of time and continues to further the cause of the rationalist movement.

==Criticism==
Ain-i-Akbari, a record of the Mughal Emperor Akbar&#x27;s court, mentions a symposium of philosophers of all faiths held in 1578 at Akbar&#x27;s insistence (also see ). In the text, the Mughal historian Abu&#x27;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak summarizes the Charvaka philosophy as &quot;unenlightened&quot; and characterizes their works of literature as &quot;lasting memorials to their ignorance&quot;. He notes that Charvakas considered paradise as &quot;the state in which man lives as he chooses, without control of another&quot;, while hell as &quot;the state in which he lives subject to another&#x27;s rule&quot;. On state craft, Charvakas believe, states Mubarak, that it is best when &quot;knowledge of just administration and benevolent government&quot; is practiced.

<text>Murder Must Advertise is a 1933 mystery novel by Dorothy L. Sayers, the eighth in her series featuring Lord Peter Wimsey. Most of the action of the novel takes place in an advertising agency, a setting with which Sayers was familiar as she had herself worked as an advertising copywriter until 1931.

==Plot==
Death Bredon arrives at Pym&#x27;s Publicity Ltd, an advertising agency, to take up the post of junior copywriter. He is assigned the room of his predecessor Victor Dean, who has died in a fall down the office&#x27;s iron spiral staircase. The doctor states that death was caused either by a broken neck, due to his landing on his head at the bottom of the stair, or by a wound of the right temple. The death appears suspicious, as the victim apparently made no attempt to save himself as he fell. Looking through Dean&#x27;s desk, Bredon discovers a partially-completed letter to the firm&#x27;s proprietor, Mr Pym, telling him that something &#x27;undesirable&#x27; is going on in the office.

Bredon befriends Pamela Dean, Victor&#x27;s sister, so that she can get him into a cocaine-fuelled fancy-dress party hosted by Dian de Momerie, a socialite with whom Dean had been associating. Disguised as Harlequin, Bredon attracts the attention of de Momerie and later meets her several times, always in disguise. His presence annoys de Momerie&#x27;s companion Major Tod Milligan, who is supplying her with drugs.

It is revealed that Death Bredon is in fact Lord Peter Wimsey, who has been brought in by Pym to investigate Dean&#x27;s death. Various clues turn up: a catapult belonging to &#x27;Ginger&#x27; Joe, the office boy; a carved stone scarab belonging to Dean; and £50 in banknotes found in the desk of Mr Tallboy, group manager.

After having a drink in a Covent Garden pub, newspaper reporter Hector Puncheon discovers that someone has slipped cocaine into his coat pocket. Chief Inspector Charles Parker, Wimsey&#x27;s brother-in-law, suspects that Puncheon has stumbled on Milligan&#x27;s drugs gang, but finds no further suspicious activity there. It appears that the cocaine is being distributed from a different pub each week.

Puncheon spots a man from the pub who is behaving suspiciously, and who almost immediately falls in front of a train and is killed. Searching the man&#x27;s flat, Wimsey and Parker discover a phone book with the names of many pubs ticked off, including the one in Covent Garden. Wimsey realises what has been happening. One of Pym&#x27;s major clients runs a newspaper advertisement every Friday, the headline for which is approved a few days earlier. The first letter of the headline is being used to indicate the pub for that week, with Tallboy covertly supplying the letter to the gang in advance.

Milligan is killed in an &#x27;accident&#x27;, and Wimsey – in his identity as Bredon – is nearly jailed for the murder of Dian de Momerie (also the gang&#x27;s work). The police want to catch the ringleaders during their next weekly drug distribution. Using the phone book, all they need to find the next pub is the letter for the week, as provided by Tallboy.

Wimsey is sure that Tallboy killed Victor Dean, but he does not want to act until the gang has been rounded up. On the night of the next drug distribution, Tallboy comes to Wimsey&#x27;s flat to confess. He says that, when he was in financial difficulty, he was lured into the scheme with an innocent-sounding story and the offer of money but soon became trapped. Dean had found out and was blackmailing him, so Tallboy killed Dean, using Ginger Joe&#x27;s catapult and the scarab, making it look like an accidental fall on the staircase. Wanting to spare his wife and child, Tallboy proposes suicide. Wimsey, seeing a gang member watching in the street below his window, suggests Tallboy leave on foot, without looking behind him. Both know that the gang&#x27;s killers are waiting, and Tallboy is knocked down and killed as he walks home.

==Literary significance and criticism==
In their review of Crime novels (revised edition 1989), the US writers Barzun and Taylor called the novel &quot;A superb example of Sayers&#x27; ability to set a group of people going. The advertising agency is inimitable, and hence better than the De Momerie crowd that goes with it. The murder is ingenious and Wimsey is just right&quot;.

Writing in 1993, the biographer Barbara Reynolds noted that &quot;Sayers herself disliked the novel, which she wrote quickly in order to fulfil her publisher&#x27;s contract, and was unsure whether it would ring true with the reading public&quot;. Reynolds quotes a letter that Sayers wrote to her publisher Victor Gollancz on 14 September 1932:
In her 1941 book &quot;The Mind of the Maker&quot; Sayers wrote: &quot;I undertook (not very successfully) to present a contrast of two &#x27;cardboard&#x27; worlds, equally fictitious—the world of advertising and the world of the post-war &#x27;Bright Young People&#x27;. (It was not very successful, because I knew and cared much more about advertising than about Bright Youth)&quot;. But she went on to quote a reader who pointed out that &quot;Peter Wimsey, who represents reality, never appears in either world except in disguise&quot;. She commented, &quot;It was perfectly true; and I had never noticed it. With all its defects of realism, there had been some measure of integral truth about the book&#x27;s Idea, since it issued, without my conscious connivance, in a true symbolism&quot;.

==Background==
Most of the action of the novel takes place in an advertising agency, a setting with which Sayers was very familiar as she had herself been employed as a copywriter at S. H. Benson&#x27;s agency, located at Kingsway from 1922 to 1931. In chapter 12 of the novel she quotes the slogan &quot;Guinness is good for you&quot;, from her own jingle &quot;If he can say as you can. / Guinness is good for you / How grand to be a Toucan / Just think what Toucan do&quot;. Lord Peter, as Death Bredon, comes up with a brilliant advertising campaign for a cigarette, &quot;Whiffling around Britain,&quot; which recalls the Colman&#x27;s Mustard Club campaign on which Sayers herself worked extensively. Her colleague Bobby Bevan was the inspiration for one of the characters in the novel, Mr Ingleby.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Murder Must Advertise&quot; was adapted by Bill Craig for television in 1973 as a BBC TV mini-series starring Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey. A six-part radio adaptation by Alistair Beaton was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in January 1979, again with Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey.

<doc id="72094" wikidata="Q80288" url="?curid=72094" title="Martin Frobisher">
<text>Sir Martin Frobisher (; – 22 November 1594) was an English sailor and privateer who made three voyages to the New World looking for the North-west Passage. He probably sighted Resolution Island near Labrador in north-eastern Canada, before entering Frobisher Bay and landing on present-day Baffin Island.

On his second voyage, Frobisher found what he thought was gold ore and carried of it home on three ships, where initial assaying determined it to be worth a profit of £5.20 per ton (equivalent to £ per ton in ). Encouraged, Frobisher returned to Canada with an even larger fleet and dug several mines around Frobisher Bay. He carried 1,350 tons of the ore back to England, where, after years of smelting, it was realized that the ore was a worthless rock containing the mineral hornblende. As an English privateer, he plundered riches from French ships. He was later knighted for his service in repelling the Spanish Armada in 1588.

==Early life==
Martin Frobisher was probably born in 1535 or 1536, the son of merchant Bernard Frobisher of Altofts, Yorkshire, and Margaret York of Gouthwaite. He was the third of five children when his father died prematurely in 1542. The family was left in the care of his uncle, Francis Frobisher. Little else is known of his early life in Yorkshire; his education appears to have been rudimentary. In hopes of better opportunity, young Frobisher was sent to London in 1549 to live with a maternal relative, Sir John York. York was a wealthy and influential member of the Merchant Taylors and had important connections in the royal government.

In 1553, Thomas Wyndham led the first English expedition to West Africa, comprising three ships and 140 men. York was an investor in the enterprise and Frobisher accompanied the fleet in an unknown capacity. After plundering Portuguese ships in the vicinity of Madeira, they made their most successful transactions on the Gold Coast, trading English cloth for 150 pounds of gold. Pushing further south they reached Benin and negotiated directly with Oba Orhogbua for 80 tons of melegueta pepper. After some initial reluctance, Orhogbua agreed to trade but while the pepper was being gathered, disease swept through the English crew killing many of them including the expedition leader, Wyndham. Lacking sufficient sailors to crew the entire fleet, they abandoned one ship and, in their panic to leave, even left behind some members of the expedition. The return voyage was extremely difficult for the sick and short-handed crew. Another ship was lost and when the one remaining ship returned to England only 40 of the original 140 crewmen were still alive. Frobisher was one of the survivors, perhaps a confirmation of York&#x27;s assessment that Frobisher had &quot;great spirit and bould courage, and natural hardnes of body.&quot;

Despite the loss of two ships and 100 lives, the 1553 voyage was considered a financial success and investors, including York, funded another trading expedition to Portuguese Guinea in 1554. Undaunted by his first experience, Frobisher joined the new expedition and served as an apprentice merchant working for York&#x27;s trading representative, John Beryn. Three ships left Dartmouth in November 1554 under the command of John Lok. This may have been Frobisher&#x27;s first acquaintance with the Lok family, a relationship that would play an important role in his future.

After seven weeks&#x27; sailing, they made their first landfall near the Cestos River in present-day Liberia. They traded for a quantity of pepper and then proceeded to the Gold Coast, the West African gold trade centre. The local government refused to deal with the English until they provided a hostage to ensure negotiations in good faith. Frobisher volunteered to serve as the hostage and discussions were allowed to proceed. However, before they could conclude a deal, a Portuguese ship appeared offshore and fired on the English fleet. The expedition abandoned Frobisher and went elsewhere to trade, eventually returning to England with a valuable cargo of gold, pepper, and ivory. His African captors then handed Frobisher over to the Portuguese at their trading post of Mina, where he was imprisoned in the castle of São Jorge da Mina. After nine months or so, the Portuguese authorities sent him to Portugal, whence he eventually made his way back to England about 1558.

==Privateer and pirate==
The circumstances and timing of Frobisher&#x27;s return from Portugal are unclear. There is no indication of any diplomatic or financial effort to secure his release; perhaps the Portuguese simply saw no advantage to holding a low-ranking political prisoner any longer. Frobisher must have returned to the sea soon after his release. There is some evidence that by 1559, he led a voyage to the Barbary Coast to secure the release of an English hostage, Anthony Hammond. In September of the same year the well-known pirate, Henry Strangways, testified in court that Frobisher had been part of an aborted plot to attack and plunder the Portuguese fortress of Mina where Frobisher had been held captive in 1555.

On 30 September 1559, Frobisher married a Yorkshire widow, Isobel Richard, who had two young children and a substantial settlement from her previous marriage to Thomas Rigatt of Snaith. Little is known of their domestic life, but having spent all her inheritance to finance his ventures, Frobisher seems to have left her and her children by the mid-1570s; Isobel&#x27;s death in a poorhouse in 1588 went unremarked by the ambitious captain.

In 1563, Frobisher became involved in a privateering venture with his brother, John Frobisher, and a fellow Yorkshireman, John Appleyard. Appleyard was licensed to seize ships of the French Catholic party and financed a fleet of three vessels. Martin Frobisher captained one vessel and may have been fleet commander. By May 1563, they had seized five French ships and brought them to Plymouth harbour. Frobisher was promptly arrested by officers of the Privy Council because his ship had also participated in the seizure of a Spanish ship which resulted in the death of 40 Englishmen. The leader of this attack was the pirate Thomas Cobham, who gave Frobisher the Spanish cargo of tapestries and wine. Possession of these goods was sufficient evidence to land Frobisher in prison.

In 1564, Frobisher was released from prison. In 1565, he purchased two ships, the &quot;Mary Flower&quot; and &quot;William Baxter&quot;. His stated intention was to outfit the ships for a trading expedition to the Guinea coast. Based on previous experience, officials were skeptical of his motives and when a storm drove him into Scarborough, he was seized along with the &quot;William Baxter&quot;. His brother, John Frobisher, was captain of the &quot;Mary Flower&quot; and escaped arrest. Martin Frobisher was once again imprisoned briefly by the admiralty court.

On 31 October 1566, Frobisher was again set free on the condition that he refrain from going to sea without a license. In 1568, he commanded the &quot;Robert&quot; in service to the exiled Cardinal of Chatillon who licensed at least six vessels to prey on French shipping. For a brief time Frobisher associated with other notable privateers including John Hawkins and William Winter. However, Frobisher refused to limit his depredations to French Catholic vessels and also seized Protestant ships carrying English goods. In 1569, he was again arrested by admiralty officers and imprisoned first at Fleet prison and then at Marshalsea. He might have remained there for some time if not for the intervention of the lord admiral, Edward Fiennes de Clinton and the secretary of state, William Cecil. With their help, Frobisher was free again in March 1570.

The terms of his release are unknown but it appears that Frobisher was required to undertake certain assignments at the direction of the Privy Council. In October 1571, he was commissioned to command four ships in the search for pirates and smugglers along the English coast. There is no indication that he had any success in this effort. In 1572, he was directed to the Irish coast to provide logistical support for the English campaign against the Desmond Rebellions.

Starting in 1571, Frobisher was involved in various plots that ran counter to government interest. He possibly had the tacit approval of the Privy Council, suggesting that he may have been working as a double agent. He was briefly associated with a plan to help the Earl of Desmond flee England; then a proposal to lead a group of disaffected English mercenaries to seize Flushing for the Spanish king; and finally, in 1573, a plot to capture the English rebel, Thomas Stukley.

According to the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, the first direct notice of Frobisher apparently is an account in the state papers of two interrogations in 1566, &quot;on suspicion of his having fitted out a vessel as a pirate&quot;. On 21 August 1571, Captain E. Horsey wrote to Lord Burghley from Portsmouth that he &quot;has expedited the fitting out of a hulk for M. Frobisher&quot;; this is the earliest mention of Frobisher being in the Crown&#x27;s employ. Burghley, then chief minister of the Queen, became Lord High Treasurer in 1572. From the latter part of 1571 to 1572, Frobisher was in the public service at sea off the coast of Ireland.

==North-west passage==
Throughout much of the sixteenth century, the feasibility of a northern route to Cathay and the East Indies was debated and tested by England. In 1508, Sebastian Cabot led one of the first expeditions to search for a North-west Passage. In the 1530s, Robert Thorne and Roger Barlow tried unsuccessfully to interest Henry VIII in a plan to sail directly over the North Pole to China. In 1551 a company of English merchants (later known as the Muscovy Company) was formed to search for a northeast passage to Cathay. The initiative failed to find a route but did establish a long-lasting trade relationship with Russia. In the 1560s Humphrey Gilbert was an influential advocate for seeking a North-west Passage and penned a detailed treatise in support of the idea.

Although Frobisher may have expressed interest in a search for the North-west Passage as early as 1560, it was only much later that he actively pursued the idea. In 1574, Frobisher petitioned the Privy Council for permission and financial support to lead an expedition to find a north-west passage to &quot;the Southern Sea&quot; (the Pacific Ocean) and thence to Cathay. Some of its members were intrigued by his proposal, but cautiously referred him to the Muscovy Company, an English merchant consortium which had previously sent out several parties searching for the Northeast Passage around the Arctic coasts of Norway and Russia, and held exclusive rights to any northern sea routes to the East.

===First voyage===
In 1576, Frobisher persuaded the Muscovy Company to license his expedition. With the help of the company&#x27;s director, Michael Lok (whose well-connected father William Lok had held an exclusive mercers&#x27; licence to provide Henry VIII with fine cloths), Frobisher was able to raise enough capital for three barques: &quot;Gabriel&quot; and &quot;Michael&quot; of about 20–25 tons each, and an unnamed pinnace of 10 tons, with a total crew of 35. Queen Elizabeth I sent word that she had &quot;good liking of their doings&quot;, and the ships weighed anchor at Blackwall on 7 June 1576. As they headed downstream on the Thames, Elizabeth waved to the departing ships from a window of Greenwich Palace, while cannons fired salutes and a large assembly of the people cheered.

On 26 June 1576, the little fleet reached the Shetland Islands, where it stopped to repair a leak in &quot;Michael&quot; hull and repair the barques&#x27; water casks. The ships hoisted sail the same evening and set course westwards, sailing west by north for three days until a violent storm arose and pounded them continuously through 8 July. On 11 July 1576, they sighted the mountains of the southeastern tip of Greenland, which they mistook for the non-existent island called &#x27;Friesland&#x27;. Crossing the Davis Strait, they encountered another violent storm in which the pinnace was sunk and &quot;Michael&quot; turned back to England, but &quot;Gabriel&quot; sailed on for four days until her crew sighted what they believed was the coast of Labrador. The landmass was actually the southernmost tip of Baffin Island; Frobisher named it &quot;Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Foreland&quot;.

The ship reached the mouth of Frobisher Bay a few days later, and because ice and wind prevented further travel north, Frobisher determined to sail westwards up the bay, which he believed to be the entrance to the North-west Passage, naming it Frobisher&#x27;s Strait, to see &quot;whether he might carry himself through the same into some open sea on the backside&quot;. &quot;Gabriel&quot; sailed northwestwards, keeping in sight of the bay&#x27;s north shore. On 18 August 1576, Burch&#x27;s Island was sighted and named after the ship&#x27;s carpenter who first spied it; there the expedition met some local Inuit. Having made arrangements with one of the Inuit to guide them through the region, Frobisher sent five of his men in a ship&#x27;s boat to return him to shore, instructing them to avoid getting too close to any of the others. The boat&#x27;s crew disobeyed, however, and five of Frobisher&#x27;s men were taken captive.

After days of searching, Frobisher could not recover the insubordinate sailors, and eventually took hostage a native man to see if an exchange for the missing boat&#x27;s crew could be arranged. The captive refused to communicate with his fellow Inuit and Frobisher&#x27;s men were never seen again by their fellows, but Inuit oral tradition tells that the men lived among them for a few years of their own free will until they died attempting to leave Baffin Island in a self-made boat.

Meanwhile, the local man, &quot;Wherupon, when he founde himself in captivitie, for very choler and disdain, he bit his tong in twayne within his mouth: notwithstanding, he died not therof, but lived untill he came in Englande, and then he died of colde which he had taken at sea.&quot;

Frobisher turned homewards, and was well received by the Queen when he docked in London on 9 October. Among the things which had been hastily brought away by the men was a black stone &quot;as great as a half-penny loaf&quot; which had been found loose on the surface of Hall&#x27;s Island of Baffin Island by the shipmaster, Robert Garrard, who took it to be sea-coal, of which they had to need. Frobisher took no account of the black rock but kept it as a token of possession of the new territory.

Michael Lok said that Frobisher, upon his return to London from the Arctic, had given him the black stone as the first object taken from the new land. Lok brought samples of the stone to the royal assayer in the Tower of London and two other expert assayers, all of whom declared that it was worthless, saying that it was marcasite and contained no gold. Lok then took the &quot;ore&quot; to an Italian alchemist living in London, Giovanni Battista Agnello, who claimed it was gold-bearing. Agnello assayed the ore three times and showed Lok small amounts of gold dust; when he was challenged as to why the other assayers failed to find gold in their specimens, Agnello replied, &quot;Bisogna sapere adulare la natura&quot; (&quot;One must know how to flatter nature&quot;). Ignoring the negative reports, Lok secretly wrote to the Queen to inform her of the encouraging result, and used this assessment to lobby investors to finance another voyage. Subsequently the stone became the focus of intense attention by the Cathay enterprise&#x27;s venturers, who saw in it the possibility of vast profits to be derived from mining the rocky islands of &quot;Meta Incognita&quot;; gossip spread in the court and from there throughout London about the gold powder Agnello was supposedly deriving from the rock.

===Second voyage===
In 1577, a much bigger expedition than the former was fitted out. The Queen lent the 200-ton ship or &quot;Ayde&quot; to the Company of Cathay (Frobisher&#x27;s biographer James McDermott says she sold it) and invested £1000 () in the expedition. Prior to 30 March 1577, Frobisher petitioned the Queen to be confirmed as High Admiral of the north-western seas and governor of all lands discovered, and to receive five per cent of profits from trade. It is unknown whether or not his request was ever granted. Michael Lok, meanwhile, was petitioning the queen for his own charter, by the terms of which the Company of Cathay would have sole rights to exploit the resources of all seas, islands and lands to the west and north of England, as well as any goods produced by the peoples occupying them; Frobisher would be apportioned a much smaller share of the profits. Lok&#x27;s request was ignored and a charter was never issued, nor was a royal license granted, creating corporate ambiguity that redounded to the Queen&#x27;s benefit.

Besides &quot;Ayde&quot;, the expedition included the ships &quot;Gabriel&quot; and &quot;Michael&quot;; Frobisher&#x27;s second-in-command aboard &quot;Ayde&quot; was Lieutenant George Best (who later wrote the most informative account of the three voyages) with Christopher Hall as master, while the navigator Edward Fenton was in command of &quot;Gabriel&quot;. The learned John Dee, one of the preeminent scholars of England, acquired shares in the Cathay Company&#x27;s venture, and instructed Frobisher and Hall in the use of navigational instruments and the mathematics of navigation, as well as advising them which books, charts, and instruments the expedition should purchase. The fleet left Blackwall on 27 May 1577 and headed down the Thames, ostensibly having, per the instructions of the Privy Council, a maximum complement of 120 men, including 90 mariners, gunners and carpenters to crew the ship, as well as refiners, merchants, and thirty Cornish miners; this figure included a group of convicts to be expatriated and put to use as miners in the new lands. Frobisher had exceeded the assigned quota of crewmen by at least twenty men, and perhaps by as many as forty. Letters from the Privy Council were waiting for him at Harwich, however, commanding him to trim the excess; consequently, he sent the convicts and several seamen ashore at the harbour on 31 May and set sail northwards to Scotland. The fleet anchored at St Magnus Sound in the Orkney Islands on 7 June 1577 to take on water, and weighed anchor that evening. It enjoyed fair weather and favourable winds on its passage across the Atlantic, and &quot;Friesland&quot; (southern Greenland) was first sighted on 4 July. Hall and Frobisher each attempted landing in the ship&#x27;s boat but were driven back by fog and the certain knowledge of unseen ice in the water before them.

On 8 July 1577, presented with no opportunity to land, Frobisher set his course westwards. The ships were caught almost immediately in severe storms and separated, each of them lowering their sails for long intervals. They continued this way for several days, tracking before the wind until the weather cleared on 17 July and the fleet was able to regroup, a testament to the skill of the masters. A sailor aboard &quot;Ayde&quot; spied Hall&#x27;s Island at the mouth of Frobisher Bay the same evening. The next day, Frobisher and a small party landed at Little Hall&#x27;s Island in &quot;Ayde&#x27;s&quot; pinnace to search for more samples of the black ore acquired originally by Robert Garrard, but found none. On 19 July, Frobisher and forty of his best men landed at Hall&#x27;s Island and made their way to its highest point, which he dubbed Mount Warwick in honour of the Earl of Warwick, one of the principal investors in the expedition. There they piled a cairn of stones to mark possession of the new land and prayed solemnly for the success of their venture.

Several weeks were now spent in collecting ore, but very little was done in the way of discovery, Frobisher being specially directed by his orders from the Company of Cathay to &quot;defer the further discovery of the passage until another time&quot;. There was much parleying and some skirmishing with the Inuit, and earnest but futile attempts were made to recover the five men captured the previous year. The expedition&#x27;s return to England commenced on 23 August 1577, and &quot;Ayde&quot; reached Milford Haven in Wales on 23 September. &quot;Gabriel&quot; and &quot;Michael&quot; later arrived separately at Bristol and Yarmouth.

Frobisher brought with him three Inuit who had been forcibly taken from Baffin Island: a man called Calichough or Kalicho, a woman, Egnock or Arnaq, and her child, Nutioc or Nuttaaq. All three died soon after their arrival in England, Calichough dying from a wound suffered when a rib was broken unintentionally during his capture and eventually punctured his lung.

Frobisher was received and thanked by the queen at Windsor. Great preparations were made and considerable expense incurred for the assaying of the great quantity of &quot;ore&quot; (about 200 tons) brought home. This took much time and led to disputes among the various interested parties.

===Third voyage===
Meanwhile, the Queen and others in her retinue maintained a strong faith in the potential productivity of the newly discovered territory, which she herself named &quot;Meta Incognita&quot; (Latin: Unknown Shore). It was resolved to send out the largest expedition yet, with everything necessary to establish a colony of 100 men. Frobisher was again received by the queen, whereupon she threw a chain of fine gold around his neck.

The expedition consisted of fifteen vessels: the flagship &quot;Ayde&quot;, &quot;Michael&quot;, and &quot;Gabriel&quot;, as well as &quot;Judith&quot;, &quot;Dennis&quot; or &quot;Dionyse&quot;, &quot;Anne Francis&quot;, &quot;Francis of Foy&quot; and &quot;Moon of Foy&quot;, &quot;Bear of Leycester&quot;, &quot;Thomas of Ipswich&quot;, &quot;Thomas Allen&quot;, &quot;Armenall&quot;, &quot;Soloman of Weymouth&quot;, &quot;Hopewell&quot;, and &quot;Emanuel of Bridgwater&quot;. There were over 400 men aboard the ships, with 147 miners, 4 blacksmiths, and 5 assayers in the crew.

On 3 June 1578, the expedition left Plymouth and, sailing through the Channel, on 20 June reached the south of Greenland, where Frobisher and some of his men managed to land. On 2 July 1578, the foreland of Frobisher Bay was sighted. Stormy weather and dangerous ice prevented the rendezvous, and, besides causing the wreck on an iceberg of the 100-ton barque &quot;Dennis&quot;, drove the fleet unwittingly up a waterway that Frobisher named &quot;Mistaken Strait&quot;. He believed that the strait, now known as Hudson Strait, was less likely to be an entrance to the North-west Passage than Frobisher Bay (&quot;Frobisher&#x27;s Strait&quot; to him). After proceeding about sixty miles up the new strait, Frobisher with apparent reluctance turned back, and after many buffetings and separations, the fleet at last came to anchor in Frobisher Bay. During this voyage, the vessel &quot;Emanuel&quot; claimed to have found the phantom Buss Island.

Some attempt was made at founding a settlement, and a large quantity of ore was shipped, but dissension and discontent prevented the establishment of a successful colony. On the last day of August 1578, the fleet set out on its return and reached England at the beginning of October, although the vessel &quot;Emanuel&quot; was wrecked en route at Ard na Caithne on the west coast of Ireland. The ore was taken to a specially constructed smelting plant at Powder Mill Lane in Dartford; assiduous efforts to extract gold and further assays were made over five years, but the ore proved to be a valueless rock containing hornblende and was eventually salvaged for road metalling and wall construction. The Cathay Company went bankrupt and Michael Lok was ruined, being sent to debtors&#x27; prison several times.

==Anglo-Spanish War==
Finding his reputation as an adventurer-explorer damaged following the disastrous outcome of the Cathay Company venture, and that his services in that line were no longer required, Frobisher sought other employment. He applied to a major shareholder in the Arctic enterprise, Sir William Wynter, one of the Queen&#x27;s most trusted naval commanders, who was leading a fleet of four heavily armed vessels to Ireland under orders to put down the Desmond rebellion against the English Crown. Frobisher secured an appointment as captain of &quot;Foresight&quot; and sailed in early March 1580; in November, he participated in the Siege of Smerwick at the Dingle Peninsula, a rocky promontory on the southwestern shore of County Kerry, where &quot;Emanuel&quot; had wrecked two years previously.

Frobisher joined Francis Drake on his 1585 raids of Spanish ports and shipping in the West Indies as vice-admiral of Drake&#x27;s fleet, appointed to that position by the Queen; his flagship was the &quot;Primrose&quot;. Shortly after the voyage began, Frobisher was admitted to a select group of advisors to Drake (together with Christopher Carleill, Nichols, and Fenner). On 20 July 1588, the Spanish Armada set sail from Corunna in Galicia to escort the Army of Flanders, led by the Duke of Parma, to invade England. Sir Francis Walsingham sent a dispatch to Whitehall stating that the Armada had been sighted in the chops (entrance) of the Channel that day. When the two navies first engaged, Frobisher was in command of &quot;Triumph&quot;, the Royal Navy&#x27;s largest ship, leading a consort of the ships &quot;Merchant Royal&quot;, &quot;Margaret and John&quot;, &quot;Centurion&quot;, &quot;Golden Lion&quot; and &quot;Mary Rose&quot;.

===Spanish Armada===
Following a council of war, Lord Howard, the Lord High Admiral of the Fleet, reorganized the English fleet into four squadrons. Frobisher was made commander of one of these and assigned &quot;Triumph&quot;, as well as Lord Sheffield&#x27;s &quot;White Bear&quot;, Lord Thomas Howard&#x27;s &quot;Golden Lion&quot;, and Sir Robert Southwell&#x27;s &quot;Elizabeth Jonas&quot;, all heavily armed vessels. On the morning of 21 July 1588, Frobisher in &quot;Triumph&quot;, Drake in &quot;Revenge&quot;, and Hawkins in &quot;Victory&quot; attacked the seaward wing of the Spanish defensive formation, damaging &quot;San Juan de Portugal&quot;, the ship of the Armada&#x27;s vice-admiral, Juan Martínez de Recalde, and forcing his rescue by galleasses from the Bizcayan squadron. Later that day Frobisher and Hawkins engaged Pedro de Valdez, commander of the Andalusian squadron, who did not yield his ship, &quot;Nuestra Señora del Rosario&quot; (Our Lady of the Rosary) until Drake came to their assistance the next morning, much to his rival Frobisher&#x27;s consternation. Three days later, the English fleet was reinforced by Lord Seymour&#x27;s channel patrol of thirty-five or forty sail, and Frobisher assumed command of his newly formed squadron.

Frobisher&#x27;s squadron was close inshore at dawn on 25 July 1588, the only one landwards of the Armada that morning; the sea was dead calm when he engaged the Duke of Medina Sidonia&#x27;s flagship &quot;San Martín&quot; and gave her another pummeling like that of a few days past. However, a breeze rose from the southwest, allowing several Spanish galleons to move in and save their flagship. The other English ships withdrew in time, but &quot;Triumph&quot; was caught on the lee shore off Dunnose cape on the Isle of Wight, and more than thirty Armada ships bore down upon him. Frobisher used his boats to manoeuvre &quot;Triumph&quot; with good effect and managed to escape when the wind shifted again, allowing him the weather gage.

Frobisher was knighted for valour on 26 July 1588 by Lord Howard aboard Howard&#x27;s flagship &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, alongside Sheffield, Thomas Howard, and Hawkins. Two days later the English launched eight fire ships into the midst of the Armada at its moorings, forcing its captains to cut their anchors; the decisive action was fought 29 July 1588 on the shoals off Gravelines, where Frobisher, Drake, and Hawkins pounded the Spanish ships with their guns. Drake in &quot;Revenge&quot; gave Medina Sidonia&#x27;s flagship, &quot;San Martin&quot;, a full broadside while Thomas Fenner in &quot;Nonpareil&quot; followed his example and the rest of Drake&#x27;s squadron did the same. Even so, &quot;San Martin&quot; sustained no major damage although her men suffered heavy casualties. Drake withdrew to the north-east, with his squadron in line astern of &quot;Revenge&quot;, and engaged the other Spanish ships nearby as he passed. Frobisher, directly behind him in the English line, stayed with the &quot;San Martin&quot; at close range and poured cannon shot into her oaken flanks, but failed to take her. Five Spanish ships were lost.

Following this defeat of the Spanish fleet, &quot;Revenge&quot; was engaged in harassing Spanish shipping and it was Frobisher&#x27;s flagship in 1590 when he commanded the efforts to intercept Spanish treasure galleons.

==Later life==
In 1590, Frobisher visited his native Altofts and found himself welcomed in the homes of the peers and landed gentry of Yorkshire county as an honoured guest. He paid particular attention to a daughter of Thomas, 1st Baron Wentworth, Dorothy Wentworth, 3 January 1601), recently widowed by the death of her husband, Paul Withypool of Ipswich; sometime before October she became Frobisher&#x27;s second wife. In November 1591, he purchased from the Queen the leasehold of the manor of Whitwood in Yorkshire for an unstated sum, and of Finningley Grange in Nottinghamshire, which had belonged to the Mattersey Priory, for £949 (). Frobisher made Whitwood his chief residence, befitting his new status as a landed proprietor, but found little leisure for country life.

The following year Frobisher took charge of an English fleet sent out to blockade the Spanish coast and rendezvous with the Spanish treasure fleet; it was fitted out by investors including the Queen, the Earl of Cumberland, Sir Walter Raleigh and his brother, and John Hawkins. Raleigh and Cumberland were the principal organizers of the expedition, and on 28 February Raleigh was commissioned to lead it; the Queen, however, was not eager to send her current favourite off to sea, and he, no great lover of sea life and with no experience in the command of fleets, recommended Frobisher take his place. The fleet was divided into two divisions, with Frobisher&#x27;s squadron patrolling the waters off the coast of Portugal near the Burlings, while Sir John Burgh (Borough) and John Norton&#x27;s squadrons sailed for the Azores where they captured a rich prize, the &quot;Madre de Deus&quot;, much to the discomfiture of Frobisher when he learned the news.

In September 1594, Frobisher led a squadron of ships that besieged Morlaix and forced its surrender. The following month he was engaged with the squadron in the siege and relief of Brest, where he received a gunshot wound to his thigh during the Siege of Fort Crozon, a Spanish-held fortress. The surgeon who extracted the ball left the wadding behind and an ensuing infection resulted in his death days later at Plymouth on 22 November. His heart was buried at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Plymouth, and his body was then taken to London and buried at St Giles-without-Cripplegate, Fore Street.

<doc id="72096" wikidata="Q1850358" url="?curid=72096" title="List of premiers of Quebec">
<text>This is a list of the premiers of the province of Quebec since Canadian Confederation in 1867. Quebec uses a unicameral (originally bicameral) Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the premier is the leader of the party that controls the most seats in the National Assembly (previously called the Legislative Assembly). The premier is Quebec&#x27;s head of government, while the king of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the lieutenant governor of Quebec. The premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Quebec, and presides over that body.

Members are first elected to the legislature during general elections. General elections must be conducted every five years from the date of the last election, but the premier may ask for early dissolution of the legislative assembly. An election may also happen if the Governing party loses the confidence of the legislature, by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.

This article only covers the time since the Canadian Confederation was created in 1867. For the premiers of the Canada East from 1840 to 1867, see List of joint premiers of the Province of Canada. The governments of Lower Canada from 1792 to 1840 were mostly controlled by representatives of the Crown.

<doc id="72118" wikidata="Q5819" url="?curid=72118" title="José Bové">
<text>Joseph &quot;José&quot; Bové (born 11 June 1953) is a French farmer, labor leader and alter-globalization activist, and spokesman for Via Campesina. He was one of the twelve official candidates in the 2007 French presidential election. He served in the European Parliament as a member of the European Green Party in the 2009–2014 and 2014–2019.

== Early life ==
José Bové was born in Talence, near Bordeaux, but was raised in many different places. As a child he lived both inside and outside France, including the United States. Bové speaks English fluently, as his parents moved with him to Berkeley, California when he was three. They were invited to be researchers at the University of California, Berkeley.

After they returned to France, they lived in Paris. Bové attended a Jesuit secondary school near Paris (from which he was expelled for being &quot;faithless&quot;). While at university, he associated with anarchists and pacifists. When asked to serve in the army, he refused as a conscientious objector. While waiting for his court appeal, he went into hiding and worked in a farm.

== Anti-military activist ==

In 1976, Bové joined the Fight for the Larzac, a movement protesting the proposed expansion of a military camp on the Larzac plateau. It would have displaced regional sheep farmers and changed the ecology of the area. He joined a band of peasants occupying the threatened territory and illegally building a sheep barn. The protest eventually succeeded, and the government cancelled the military plan. As a result of that experience, Bové became a sheep farmer there, producing Roquefort cheese.

== Agricultural unionist ==

Bové continued both as a farmer and an activist. In 1987, he formed the &quot;Confédération Paysanne,&quot; an agricultural union. It promotes the quality of life for humans and the environment, promoting organic farming. In opposition to many companies in the profit-oriented agro-industry, Bové is a prominent opponent of genetically modified organisms (GMO). In 1995 he joined Greenpeace on their ship, the &quot;Rainbow Warrior,&quot; in a voyage to protest nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific Ocean. He has also been part of the anarchist organization &quot;Alternative Libertaire.&quot;

Bové and the &quot;Confédération&quot; gained national and international attention in 1999 by dismantling a McDonald&#x27;s franchise that was under construction in Millau (Aveyron). Considered by his supporters to be non-violent, Bové designed this protest against new US restrictions on importing Roquefort cheese and other products, which were harming the farmers who live from these products, and to raise awareness about McDonald&#x27;s&#x27; use of hormone-treated beef. Bové was sentenced to three months&#x27; imprisonment for his role; he was imprisoned for 44 days and released early on 1 August 2002.

Later, the European Union imposed restrictions on importing hormone-treated beef (see Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement). However, the World Trade Organization, of which both the US and France are members, disallowed this restriction. After the EU refused to comply and remove the restrictions, the United States placed punitive tariffs on the importation of certain European goods, including Roquefort cheese, in retaliation.

== Alter-globalization activist ==
During an interview by Lynn Jeffress for &quot;Z&quot; magazine in June 2001, Bové explained why he destroyed the McDonald&#x27;s, saying: &quot;This is a fight against free trade global capitalism. It&#x27;s about the logic of a certain economic system, not an American system. It can be a struggle against any country, this one or that one.&quot;
Bové has participated in numerous anti-globalization movements. In June 1997 he took part in the first anti-GM mowing. The same year that he took part in destruction of the McDonald&#x27;s, he attended the protests in Seattle against the World Trade Organization meeting. Bové became a figure of anti-globalization.

Since then, he has redoubled his efforts in the world peasant and anti-globalization movements. He has said that he does not oppose the WTO and global rules, and agrees there is a need for such forms. But his resistance, as stated by his followers, is directed against the lack of democracy in how these rules are developed, approved and implemented. Bové is a founding member of ATTAC.

In 2001 Bové took part in a major action destroying genetically modified crops in Brazil. In 2005 he campaigned for a &quot;No&quot; vote in the French referendum on the EU Constitution; the proposal was defeated.

== Controversies ==

In April 2002 Bové was at the head of an activist group arriving in the West Bank to protest the massive Israeli Army operation, Operation Defensive Shield, conducted at that time, which had caused many Palestinian casualties. The group entered Yassir Arafat&#x27;s headquarters in Ramallah, at the time besieged by Israeli forces. Bové joined with members of the newly established International Solidarity Movement (ISM), who were acting as &quot;human shields&quot; at the Palestinian Presidential Compound so as to deter the army from breaking in.

After spending a day in the besieged headquarters, Bové came out and was promptly arrested and deported by Israeli police. Upon his return to France, he was met by dozens of pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian demonstrators, who scuffled briefly at Paris&#x27; Orly Airport.

In an interview in 2002 with TV channel Canal Plus, Bové said he believed that the wave of attacks against French synagogues was being either arranged or fabricated by Mossad (the Israeli secret service). &quot;Who profits from the crime?&quot; Bové asked. &quot;The Israeli government and its secret services have an interest in creating a certain psychosis, in making believe that there is a climate of antisemitism in France, in order to distract attention from what they are doing.&quot; Considerable outrage was expressed after his remarks, and he later apologized for the statement. His visit to Arafat was denounced in a speech by the head of France&#x27;s CRIF, an umbrella group for Jewish organisations.

Bové has intervened to support the movements of the Tahitians and the Kanaks, the indigenous Melanesian people of New Caledonia. On 23 April 2004 he announced that he would join the People&#x27;s Congress of Kurdistan (&quot;Kongra-Gel&quot;). This group has been classified as terrorist by both the European Union and the United States State Department.

== Civil disobedience ==

In 1976, Bové was sentenced and served three weeks of imprisonment for having destroyed documents belonging to the military, when opposing extension of Larzac military camp.

In 2002, Bové was sentenced to three months&#x27; imprisonment for his role in the 1999 destruction of a McDonald&#x27;s franchise in Millau, Aveyron. He served 44 days and was released on 1 August 2002.

On 22 June 2003 Bové began serving a sentence of ten months for the destruction of transgenic crops. ATTAC protested and called for him to be freed. A general pardon of prisoners issued for Bastille Day, together with an individual action in his case by President Jacques Chirac, reduced the sentence to seven months. Both supporters and opponents expressed dissatisfaction with the Presidential pardon, saying that it was entirely inadequate and wholly unjustified, respectively. On 15 November 2005, the Toulouse court of appeals sentenced Bové to 4 months in jail for having destroyed genetically engineered corn from a field. Other defendants, such as Noël Mamère, got suspended sentences.

In February 2006, Bové was stopped at entry by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at New York&#x27;s JFK Airport. He was traveling to Cornell University&#x27;s School of Industrial and Labor Relations for events sponsored by Cornell&#x27;s Global Labor Institute. According to Bové, the Customs agents told him he was &quot;ineligible&quot; to enter the U.S. due to his past prosecutions for &quot;moral crimes.&quot; After being detained for several hours, Bové was placed on an Air France flight to Paris.

On 11 October 2016, Bové was denied entry to Canada because of his convictions related to protests, notably against McDonald&#x27;s. He was subsequently allowed to stay in the country for seven days.

== Political life ==

Following an appeal from his supporters, who gathered 40,000 signatures, in January 2007 Bové announced he would run as a candidate that year in the 2007 French presidential election. He formally declared on 1 February and in six weeks gained the required 500 signatures from elected officials necessary to be a candidate. He declared he was fighting for &quot;the people that have no voice.&quot; He was trying to promote unity on the radical left and aiming to defeat the right and the far right, which had recently gained popularity. He was endorsed by actress Juliette Binoche, who has international renown. On 19 March Bové announced that he had secured the support necessary to reach the second stage, to be listed on the published ballot, alongside 11 other contenders. On the first round of the presidential election, Bové scored 1.32% of the popular vote (483,008 votes).

Following the French presidential elections, Bové became more closely associated with Europe Écologie, a coalition of French environmentalist political parties including the Green Party. In the 2009 European Parliament election, he headed the list of candidates for the South-West constituency. On 7 June 2009, he was elected to the European Parliament, as Europe Ecologie garnered more than 16% of the vote in a proportional electoral system. He was re-elected at the 2014 European Parliament election.

<text>Salisbury ( , ) is a cathedral city and civil parish in Wiltshire, England with a population of 41,820, at the confluence of the rivers Avon, Nadder and Bourne. The city is approximately from Southampton and from Bath.

Salisbury is in the southeast of Wiltshire, near the edge of Salisbury Plain. An ancient cathedral was north of the present city at Old Sarum. A new cathedral was built near the meeting of the rivers and a settlement grew up around it, which received a city charter in 1227 as . This continued to be its official name until 2009, when Salisbury City Council was established. Salisbury railway station is an interchange between the West of England Line and the Wessex Main Line.

Stonehenge, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is northwest of Salisbury.

==Toponymy==

&quot;Cair-Caratauc&quot;, one of 28 cities of the Ancient Britons listed in the &quot;History of the Britons&quot; (9th century), has been identified with Salisbury. Alternative names for the city, in the Welsh &quot;Chronicle of the Britons&quot; (12th century) were &quot;Caer-Caradog&quot;, &quot;Caer-Gradawc&quot;, and &quot;Caer-Wallawg.&quot; 

By the Roman era, the name had become &quot;Sorbiodūnum&quot;; the first part was of unknown origin, although the Brittonic suffix &quot;-dūnon&quot; meant &quot;fortress&quot;. The name first recorded during the Anglo-Saxon era was &quot;Searoburg&quot; (dative &quot;Searobyrig&quot;), around the end of the 9th century. This was a partial calque of the Roman name, with &quot;burg&quot; being the Old English word for &quot;fort&quot;. Middle English &quot;Sarisberie&quot; was abbreviated as &quot;Sar&quot;, which in turn gave rise to the latinization &quot;Sarum&quot;.

==History==

===Old Sarum===

The hilltop at Old Sarum lies near the Neolithic sites of Stonehenge and Avebury and shows some signs of early settlement. It commanded a salient between the River Bourne and the Hampshire Avon, near a crossroads of several early trade routes. During the Iron Age, sometime between 600 and 300 BC, a hillfort (oppidum) was constructed around it. The Romans may have occupied the site or left it in the hands of an allied tribe. At the time of the Saxon invasions, Old Sarum fell to King Cynric of Wessex in 552. Preferring settlements in bottomland, such as nearby Wilton, the Saxons largely ignored Old Sarum until the Viking invasions led (King of Wessex from 871 to 899) to restore its fortifications. Along with Wilton, however, it was abandoned by its residents to be sacked and burned by the Dano-Norwegian king Sweyn Forkbeard in 1003. It subsequently became the site of Wilton&#x27;s mint. Following the Norman invasion of 1066, a motte-and-bailey castle was constructed by 1070. The castle was held directly by the Norman kings; its castellan was generally also the sheriff of Wiltshire.

In 1075 the Council of London established Herman as the first bishop of Salisbury, uniting his former sees of Sherborne and Ramsbury into a single diocese which covered the counties of Dorset, Wiltshire, and Berkshire. In 1055, Herman had planned to move his seat to Malmesbury, but its monks and Earl Godwin objected. Herman and his successor, Saint Osmund, began the construction of the first Salisbury cathedral, though neither lived to see its completion in 1092. Osmund served as Lord Chancellor of England (in office 1070–1078); he was responsible for the codification of the Sarum Rite, the compilation of the Domesday Book, which was probably presented to William at Old Sarum, and, after centuries of advocacy from Salisbury&#x27;s bishops, was finally canonised by Pope in 1457. The cathedral was consecrated on 5 April 1092 but suffered extensive damage in a storm, traditionally said to have occurred only five days later. Bishop Roger was a close ally of (reigned 1100–1135): he served as viceroy during the king&#x27;s absence in Normandy and directed, along with his extended family, the royal administration and exchequer. He refurbished and expanded Old Sarum&#x27;s cathedral in the 1110s and began work on a royal palace during the 1130s, prior to his arrest by Henry&#x27;s successor, Stephen. After this arrest, the castle at Old Sarum was allowed to fall into disrepair, but the sheriff and castellan continued to administer the area under the king&#x27;s authority.

===New Sarum===

Bishop of Salisbury Hubert Walter was instrumental in the negotiations with Saladin during the Third Crusade, but he spent little time in his diocese prior to his elevation to archbishop of Canterbury. The brothers Herbert and Richard Poore succeeded him and began planning the relocation of the cathedral into the valley almost immediately. Their plans were approved by but repeatedly delayed: Herbert was first forced into exile in Normandy in the 1190s by the hostility of his archbishop Walter and then again to Scotland in the 1210s owing to royal hostility following the papal interdiction against . The secular authorities were particularly incensed, according to tradition, owing to some of the clerics debauching the castellan&#x27;s female relations. In the end, the clerics were refused permission to reenter the city walls following their rogations and processions. This caused Peter of Blois to describe the church as &quot;a captive within the walls of the citadel like the ark of God in the profane house of Baal&quot;. He advocated
Herbert Poore&#x27;s successor and brother Richard Poore eventually moved the cathedral to a new town on his estate at Veteres Sarisberias (&quot;Old Salisburies&quot;) in 1220. The site was at &quot;Myrifield&quot; (&quot;Merryfield&quot;), a meadow near the confluence of the River Nadder and the Hampshire Avon. It was first known as &quot;New Sarum&quot; or . The town was laid out on a grid.

Work on the new cathedral building, the present Salisbury Cathedral, began in 1221. The site was supposedly established by shooting an arrow from Old Sarum, although this is certainly a legend: the distance is over . The legend is sometimes amended to claim that the arrow struck a white deer, which continued to run and died on the spot where the cathedral now rests. The structure was built upon wooden faggots on a gravel bed with unusually shallow foundations of and the main body was completed in only 38 years. The tall spire, the tallest in the UK, was built later. With royal approval, many of the stones for the new cathedral were taken from the old one; others came from Chilmark. They were probably transported by ox-cart, owing to the obstruction to boats on the River Nadder caused by its many weirs and watermills. The cathedral is considered a masterpiece of Early English architecture. The spire&#x27;s large clock was installed in 1386, and is one of the oldest surviving mechanical clocks in the world. The cathedral also contains the best-preserved of the four surviving copies of Magna Carta.

New Sarum was made a city by a charter from in 1227 and, by the 14th century, was the largest settlement in Wiltshire. The city wall surrounds the Close and was built in the 14th century, again with stones removed from the former cathedral at Old Sarum. The wall now has five gates: the High Street Gate, Gate, the Queen&#x27;s Gate, and Gate were original, while a fifth was constructed in the 19th century to allow access to Bishop Wordsworth&#x27;s School, in the Cathedral Close. During his time in the city, the composer Handel stayed in a room above St Ann&#x27;s gate. The original site of the city at Old Sarum, meanwhile, fell into disuse. It continued as a rotten borough: at the time of its abolition during the reforms of 1832, its Member of Parliament (MP) represented three households.

In May 1289, there was uncertainty about the future of Margaret, Maid of Norway, and her father sent ambassadors to Edward I. Edward met Robert the Bruce and others at Salisbury in October 1289, which resulted in the Treaty of Salisbury, under which Margaret would be sent to Scotland before 1 November 1290 and any agreement on her future marriage would be delayed until she was in Scotland.

The Parliament of England met at New Sarum in the years 1324, 1328, and 1384.

In 1450, a number of riots broke out in Salisbury at roughly the same time as Jack Cade led a famous rebellion through London. The riots occurred for related reasons, although the declining fortunes of Salisbury&#x27;s cloth trade may also have been influential. The violence peaked with the murder of the bishop, William Ayscough, who had been involved with the government. In 1483, a large-scale rebellion against Richard III broke out, led by his own &#x27;kingmaker&#x27;, Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. After the revolt collapsed, Buckingham was executed at Salisbury, near the Bull&#x27;s Head Inn. An act of Parliament, the River Avon Navigation (Christchurch to New Sarum) Act 1664 (16 &amp; 17 Cha. 2. c. 12) was passed on 2 March 1665 for making the River Avon navigable from Christchurch to the city of New Sarum. and the work completed, only for the project to be ruined shortly thereafter by a major flood. Soon after, during the Great Plague of London, Charles II held court in Salisbury&#x27;s cathedral close.

Salisbury was the site chosen to assemble James II&#x27;s forces to resist the Glorious Revolution. He arrived to lead his approximately men on 19 November 1688. His troops were not keen to fight Mary or her husband William, and the loyalty of many of James&#x27;s commanders was in doubt. The first blood was shed at the Wincanton Skirmish, in Somerset. In Salisbury, James heard that some of his officers had deserted, such as Edward Hyde, and he broke out in a nosebleed, which he took as an omen that he should retreat. His commander in chief, the Earl of Feversham, advised retreat on 23 November, and the next day John Churchill defected to William. On 26 November, James&#x27;s own daughter, Princess Anne, did the same, and James returned to London the same day, never again to be at the head of a serious military force in England.

===20th and 21st centuries===

Following the destruction by the Luftwaffe of the Southampton factories building Supermarine Spitfires in 1940, production was dispersed to shadow factories elsewhere in the south of England. Salisbury was the major centre of production, supplemented by Trowbridge and Reading. Several factories were set up in the centre of Salisbury and staffed by predominantly young women who had no previous mechanical experience but were trained for specific tasks in the aircraft construction process. Supporting the factories were many workers producing small components in home-based workshops and garden sheds. Sub-assemblies were built in the city centre factories and then transported to High Post airfield (north of the city, in Durnford parish) and Chattis Hill (northeast, near Stockbridge), where the aircraft were assembled, test flown and then distributed to RAF airfields across England. A total of over 2000 Spitfires were produced. The whole process was carried out in secret without the knowledge of even the local people and only emerged into public knowledge after the production of a film describing the whole process. In July 2021 a memorial to the workers, in the form of a life-size fibreglass model Mk IX Spitfire, was unveiled in Castle Road, Salisbury (near the rugby club) on the site of one of the factories.

At the time of the 1948 Summer Olympics, held in London, a relay of runners carried the Olympic Flame from Wembley Stadium, where the Games were based, to the sailing centre at Torbay via Slough, Basingstoke, Salisbury, and Exeter.

The 1972 Local Government Act eliminated the administration of the City of New Sarum under its former charters, but its successor, Wiltshire County&#x27;s Salisbury District, continued to be accorded its former city status. The name was finally formally amended from &quot;New Sarum&quot; to &quot;Salisbury&quot; during the 2009 changes occasioned by the 1992 Local Government Act, which established the Salisbury City Council.

On 4 March 2018, former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, were poisoned in Salisbury with a Novichok nerve agent.

==Governance==
Salisbury is within the county of Wiltshire, and the administrative district of the same name. For local government purposes, it is administered by the Wiltshire Council unitary authority. Salisbury forms a civil parish with a parish council known as the Salisbury City Council.

Since the local boundary review of 2020, two electoral wards – St Edmund and Harnham East – cover the city centre within the A36 ring road, and the rest of the unitary and city council areas are covered by six further wards. Laverstock and Ford parish council has the same boundary as the Laverstock ward, as well as part of the Old Sarum and Upper Bourne Valley ward, at unitary level. The Bishopdown Farm estate on the outskirts of Salisbury is now part of Laverstock and Ford, joining Hampton Park and Riverdown Park.

Prior to 2009, Salisbury was part of the now-abolished non-metropolitan county of Wiltshire. It was governed by Wiltshire County Council at the county level and Salisbury District Council, which oversaw most of south Wiltshire as well as the city. Salisbury (previously officially New Sarum) has had city status since time immemorial.

The Member of Parliament for the Salisbury constituency, which includes the city, Wilton, Old Sarum, Laverstock and surrounding rural areas, is John Glen (Conservative), who was first elected in 2010.

==Geography==
Salisbury is approximately halfway between Exeter and London being 80 miles (128 km) east-northeast of Exeter, 78 miles (126 km) west-southwest of London and also south of Swindon, northwest of Southampton and southeast of Bath.
The geology of the area, as with much of South Wiltshire and Hampshire, is largely chalk. The rivers which flow through the city have been redirected, and along with landscaping, have been used to feed into public gardens. They are popular in the summer, particularly in Queen Elizabeth Gardens, as the water there is shallow and slow-flowing enough to enter safely. Because of the low-lying land, the rivers are prone to flooding, particularly during the winter months. The Town Path, a walkway that links Harnham with the rest of the city, is at times impassable.

Water-meadows at Harnham, fed by two branches of the River Nadder, are first documented in the 17th century. East Harnham Meadows, in the floodplain of the Avon, is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

There are civil airfields at Old Sarum (where the experimental aircraft the Edgley Optica was developed and tested) and at Thruxton near Andover.

===Areas and suburbs===
Salisbury has many areas and suburbs, most of them being former villages that were absorbed by the growth of the city. The boundaries of these areas are for the most part unofficial and not fixed. All of these suburbs are within Salisbury&#x27;s ONS Urban Area, which had a population of 44,748 in 2011. However, not all of these suburbs are administered by the city council, and are therefore not within the eight wards that had a combined population of 40,302 in 2011. Two parishes are part of the urban area but outside Salisbury parish.

==Demography==
The civil parish of Salisbury, which does not include some of the city&#x27;s suburbs such as Laverstock, Ford, Britford and Netherhampton, had a population of 40,302 at the 2011 census.

The urban zone, which contains the wards immediately surrounding the city, had a population of 62,216 at the 2011 Census. The wards included in this figure are Laverstock, Britford, Downton, Alderbury, Odstock and the neighbouring town of Wilton, among others, however it does not include the towns of Amesbury or Romsey, as these support their own local populations and are further afield.

At the 2011 census the population of the civil parish was 95.73% white (91.00% White British), 2.48% Asian (0.74% Indian, 0.41% Bangladeshi, 0.40% Chinese), 0.45% black and 1.15% mixed race. Within the parish, the largest ethnic minority group was &#x27;other white&#x27; comprising 3.6% of the population as of 2011. There is not much contrast between areas when it comes to ethnic diversity. The ward of St Edmund and Milford is the most multiethnic, with 86.0% of the population being White British. The least multiethnic is the ward of St Francis and Stratford, which contains suburbs in the north of the city, with 94.8% of the population being White British. The city is represented by six other wards.

Within the parish, the largest ethnic minority group was &#x27;other white&#x27; comprising 3.6% of the population as of 2011.

==Economy==

Salisbury holds a charter market on Tuesdays and Saturdays and has held markets regularly since 1227. In the 15th century the Market Place had four crosses: the Poultry Cross, whose name describes its market; the &#x27;cheese and milk cross&#x27;, which indicated that market and was in the triangle between the HSBC bank and the Salisbury Library; a third cross near the site of the present war memorial, which marked a woollen and yarn market; and a fourth, called Barnwell or Barnard&#x27;s Cross, in the Culver Street and Barnard Street area, which marked a cattle and livestock market. Today, only the Poultry Cross remains, to which flying buttresses were added in the 19th century. The Market Hall, later known as the Corn Exchange, was completed in 1859.

In 1226, Henry III granted the Bishop of Salisbury a charter to hold a fair lasting eight days from the Feast of the Assumption of Mary (15 August). Over the centuries the dates of the fair have moved around, but in its modern guise, a funfair is now held in the Market Place for three days from the third Monday in October.
From 1833 to the mid-1980s, the , which ran the city&#x27;s gasworks, was one of the major employers in the area. The company was formed in 1832 with a share capital of £8,000, and its first chairman was the 3rd Earl of Radnor. The company was incorporated by a local act of Parliament, the &#x27; (27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. xxiii), and the &#x27; confirmed by the Gas Orders Confirmation Act 1882 (45 &amp; 46 Vict. c. xcix) empowered it to raise capital of up to £40,000. At its peak, the gasworks were producing not only coal gas but also coke, which was sold off as the by-product of gas-making. Ammoniacal liquor, another by-product, was mixed with sulphuric acid, dried and ground to make a powder which was sold as an agricultural fertiliser. The clinker from the retort house was sold to a firm in London to be used as purifier beds in the construction of sewage works.

Salisbury power station supplied electricity to Salisbury and the surrounding area from 1898 to 1970. The power station was at Town Mill and was owned and operated by Salisbury Electric Light and Supply Company Limited prior to the nationalisation of the British electricity supply industry in 1948. The coal-fired power station was redeveloped several times to incorporate new plant including a water-driven turbine.

From the Middle Ages to the start of the 20th century, Salisbury was noted for its cutlery industry. Early motor cars were manufactured in the city from 1902 by Dean and Burden Brothers, using the Scout Motors brand. In 1907, the company moved to a larger factory at Churchfields; each car took six to eight weeks to build, mostly using bodies made elsewhere by coachbuilders. By 1912, 150 men were employed and the company was also making small commercial vehicles and 20-seater buses, some of which were later used by the newly established Wilts &amp; Dorset operator. The Scout company failed in 1921 after wartime disruption and competition from larger makers.

Shopping centres include The Old George Mall, The Maltings, Winchester Street, and the Crosskeys precinct. Major employers include Salisbury District Hospital. The closure of the Friends Life office, the second largest employer, was announced in 2015.

==Culture==

Salisbury was an important centre for music in the 18th century. The grammarian James Harris, a friend of Handel, directed concerts at the Assembly Rooms for almost 50 years up to his death in 1780. Many of the most famous musicians and singers of the day performed there.

Salisbury holds an annual St George&#x27;s Day pageant, the origins of which are claimed to go back to the 13th century.

Salisbury has a strong artistic community, with galleries situated in the city centre, including the Young Gallery (incorporating the John Creasey Museum), located in Salisbury Library. In the 18th century, John Constable made a number of celebrated landscape paintings featuring the cathedral&#x27;s spire and the surrounding countryside. Salisbury&#x27;s annual International Arts Festival, started in 1973, and held in late May to early June, provides a programme of theatre, live music, dance, public sculpture, street performance and art exhibitions. Salisbury also houses a producing theatre, Salisbury Playhouse, which produces between eight and ten plays a year, as well as welcoming touring productions.

===The Salisbury Museum===

The Salisbury Museum is housed in the King&#x27;s House, a Grade I listed building whose history dates back to the 13th century, opposite the west front of the cathedral.

The permanent Stonehenge exhibition gallery has interactive displays about Stonehenge and the archaeology of south Wiltshire, and its collections include the skeleton of the Amesbury Archer, which is on display.
The Pitt Rivers display holds a collection from General Augustus Pitt Rivers.
The costume gallery showcases costumes and textiles from the area, with costumes for children to try on while imagining themselves as characters from Salisbury&#x27;s past.

The former home of Sir Edward Heath, Arundells in the Cathedral Close, is open as a museum.

==Twin towns and sister cities==
Salisbury has been twinned with Saintes, France, since 1990, and with Xanten, Germany, since 2005. Salisbury is also a sister city of Salisbury, North Carolina and Salisbury, Maryland, both of which are in the United States.

==Education==
In the 13th and 14th centuries, Salisbury was a seat of learning, with students of theology and the liberal arts taught at the College of the Valley Scholars, founded by Bishop Giles of Bridport in 1262. This has some claim to be seen as the first university college in England, as it was founded three years before Merton College, Oxford. Most of the scholars transferred to Salisbury Hall, Oxford, in 1325. 

There are several schools in and around Salisbury. The city has the only grammar schools in Wiltshire, South Wilts Grammar School for girls and Bishop Wordsworth&#x27;s School for boys; since September 2020, both have mixed sixth forms. Other schools in or near the city include Salisbury Cathedral School, Chafyn Grove School, Leehurst Swan School, the Godolphin senior and prep schools, Sarum Academy, St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic School, and Wyvern St Edmund&#x27;s.

Sixth-form education is offered by Salisbury Sixth Form College, while the Salisbury campus of Wiltshire College offers a range of further education courses, as well as some higher education courses in association with Bournemouth University. Sarum College is a Christian theological college, within the Cathedral close.

==Transport==

===Road===
The main transport links for the city are the roads. Salisbury lies on the intersection of the A30, the A36, and the A338, and is at the end of the A343, A345, A354, and A360. Car parks around the periphery of the city are linked to the city centre by a park-and-ride scheme (see details in the bus section below). The A36 forms an almost complete ring road around the city centre. The A3094 comprises the southwestern quadrant of the ring road, passing through the city&#x27;s outer suburbs.

The lack of adequate roads is a cause of concern to the people of Salisbury as there are no motorway links to the ports of Southampton and Bristol. The closest motorway access is at junction 2 of the M27 at Southampton, and at junction 8 of the M3 near Basingstoke. Traffic passes around the city centre on the A36 to Bath.

===Bus===

There are bus links to Southampton, Bournemouth, Andover, Devizes, and Swindon, with limited services on Sundays. Salisbury Reds, a brand of Go South Coast, is the main local operator. Wheelers Travel provide services to Shaftesbury and Andover, as well as intermediate-distance services. Other operators include Stagecoach (Amesbury, Tidworth, Andover) and Beeline (Warminster).

Salisbury has a Park and Ride bus scheme with five sites around the city. The scheme attempts to relieve pressure on the city centre, but as of 2010, ran at an annual loss of £1 million.

Salisbury bus station, which opened in 1939, closed in January 2014 due to high operating costs and low usage. Situated in Endless Street, on the northeastern edge of the city centre, the site was later developed into retirement homes, which opened in February 2018.

===Railways===
Salisbury railway station is the crossing point of the West of England Main Line, from to , and the Wessex Main Line from to . The station is operated by South Western Railway. Great Western Railway hourly trains call from , Bristol Temple Meads, to Southampton Central and .

==Churches==
Besides the cathedral church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Salisbury has several churches of various denominations. Three of them – St Martin, St Thomas and St Lawrence (Stratford-sub-Castle) – are Grade I listed.

===Medieval===

St Martin&#x27;s Church predates the establishment of the cathedral at New Sarum. The church is on the south side of Milford Hill, beyond the eastern edge of the medieval town. The chancel is from c.1230, the tower (with spire) is 14th-century and the nave and aisles are from the late 15th century, but there is evidence of an earlier church and of Saxon burials. The parish has a long-standing Anglo-Catholic tradition.

St Edmund&#x27;s was founded as a collegiate church in 1269, in the north of the city. It was originally a larger building which was damaged when the central tower fell in 1653; the nave was demolished and a new tower was built at the west end. A chancel was added in 1766 and then rebuilt in 1865–1867 by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The church was declared redundant in 1974 and reopened as Salisbury Arts Centre in 1975. A two-storey addition was built on the north side in 2003–2005.
St Thomas&#x27; church has a central position, just west of the market square. It was founded in the early 13th century and rebuilt in the 15th at the expense of the city&#x27;s prosperous merchants. Above the chancel arch is a large 15th-century doom painting, &quot;one of the best surviving&quot; according to Orbach.

The churches of three rural parishes are in areas now absorbed into Salisbury. St George&#x27;s at West Harnham was begun in the 12th century and altered in the early 14th century. St Lawrence, Stratford-sub-Castle, was built in the 13th century for the settlement near Old Sarum, at first as a chapelry of St Martin&#x27;s. The small church of St Andrew at Bemerton was built in the 14th century on the site of an earlier church. It is associated with the poet and priest George Herbert, rector from 1630 until his death in 1633.

===19th century===
St Osmund&#x27;s (Catholic) is on Exeter Street in the city centre, a short distance east of the cathedral. It was designed by Augustus Pugin, who also designed some of the stained glass, and was consecrated in 1848.

St Paul&#x27;s church, serving part of the northern suburbs, was built near the start of the Devizes road in 1853. It was a replacement for St Clement&#x27;s at Fisherton village, which had stood near the Nadder since at least the 14th century. The style of worship has been evangelical since the 1860s.

The small All Saints&#x27; church was built at East Harnham in 1854, to designs of T.H. Wyatt.

In 1861, St John&#x27;s church was built at Bemerton to supplement St Andrew&#x27;s. The building was declared redundant in 2010 and reopened in 2016 as a community centre and events venue.

St Mark&#x27;s was dedicated in 1894 to serve the expanding northern suburbs. The church is described as &quot;ambitious&quot; by Historic England and &quot;expensively detailed&quot; by Orbach. Construction was in stages, finishing in 1915, and the upper part of the tower was never built.

19th-century buildings for other denominations include, in the city centre, the Methodist Church (1811, enlarged later); the United Reformed Church (originally Congregational, 1879); Elim Pentecostal Church (originally Primitive Methodist, 1896, now a nightclub); and on Wilton Road, Emmanuel Church (1860).

===20th century===

The Roman Catholic St. Gregory&#x27;s Church was built in the city&#x27;s western suburbs in 1938.

As the city&#x27;s suburbs extended further north, St Francis&#x27;s church was consecrated in 1940 to serve an area which had been part of Stratford-sub-Castle parish. Worship is evangelical in style, and services are designed to appeal to families and young people.

==Sport and leisure==
The city has a football team, Salisbury F.C., who play in the and are based at the Raymond McEnhill Stadium, on the northern edge of the city. Other non-league clubs are Bemerton Heath Harlequins F.C. and Laverstock &amp; Ford F.C.
Salisbury Rugby Club, which is based at Castle Road, plays in Southern Counties South. South Wilts Cricket Club is based at the Salisbury and South Wiltshire Sports Club and play in the Southern Premier Cricket League. Salisbury Hockey Club is also based at the Salisbury and South Wilts Sports Club.

The Five Rivers Leisure Centre and Swimming Pool, which was opened in 2002, is just outside the ring road. Salisbury Racecourse is a flat racing course to the south-west of the city. Five Rivers Indoor Bowls Club and Salisbury Snooker Club share a building on Tollgate Road, behind the college.

Old Sarum Airfield, north of the city centre, is home to a variety of aviation-based businesses, including flying schools and the APT Charitable Trust for disabled flyers.

The city&#x27;s theatre is the Salisbury Playhouse. The City Hall is an entertainment venue and hosts comedy, musical performances (including those by the resident Musical Theatre Salisbury), as well as seminars and conventions. Salisbury Arts Centre, housed in a redundant church, has exhibitions and workshops.

Salisbury is well-supplied with pubs. The &quot;Haunch of Venison&quot;, overlooking the Poultry Cross, operates from a 14th-century building; one of its attractions is a cast of a mummified hand, supposedly severed during a game of cards. The &quot;Rai d&#x27;Or&quot; has original deeds dating from 1292. It was the home of Agnes Bottenham, who used the profits of the tavern to found Trinity Hospital next door in c. 1380.

<doc id="72128" wikidata="Q55260" url="?curid=72128" title="David Lean">
<text>Sir David Lean (25 March 190816 April 1991) was an English film director, producer, screenwriter, and editor, widely considered one of the most important figures of British cinema. He directed the large-scale epics &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957), &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965), &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1970), and &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1984). He also directed the film adaptations of Charles Dickens novels &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946) and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948), as well as the romantic drama &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; (1945).

Originally a film editor in the early 1930s, Lean made his directorial debut with 1942&#x27;s &quot;In Which We Serve&quot;, which was the first of four collaborations with Noël Coward. Lean began to make internationally co-produced films financed by the big Hollywood studios, beginning with &quot;Summertime&quot; in 1955. The critical failure of his film &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; led him to take a fourteen-year break from filmmaking, during which he planned a number of film projects which never came to fruition. In 1984, he had a career revival with &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, adapted from E. M. Forster&#x27;s novel. This was a hit with critics, but it proved to be the last film that Lean directed.

Lean is described by film critic Michael Sragow as &quot;a director&#x27;s director, whose total mastery of filmcraft commands nothing less than awe among his peers&quot;. He has been lauded by directors such as Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, and Ridley Scott. He was voted 9th greatest film director of all time in the British Film Institute &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; &quot;Directors&#x27; Top Directors&quot; poll in 2002. He was nominated seven times for the Academy Award for Best Director, which he won twice for &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; and &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, and he has seven films in the British Film Institute&#x27;s Top 100 British Films (with three of them being in the top five) and was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1990.

==Early life and education==
David Lean was born on 25 March 1908 at 38 Blenheim Crescent, South Croydon, Surrey (now part of Greater London), to Francis William le Blount Lean and the former Helena Tangye (niece of Sir Richard Trevithick Tangye). His parents were Quakers and he was a pupil at the Quaker-founded Leighton Park School in Reading. His younger brother, Edward Tangye Lean (1911–1974), founded the original Inklings literary club when a student at Oxford University. Lean was a half-hearted schoolboy with a dreamy nature who was labelled a &quot;dud&quot; of a student; he left school in the Christmas Term of 1926, at the age of 18, and entered his father&#x27;s chartered accountancy firm as an apprentice.

A more formative event for his career than his formal education was an uncle&#x27;s gift, when Lean was aged ten, of a Brownie box camera. &quot;You usually didn&#x27;t give a boy a camera until he was 16 or 17 in those days. It was a huge compliment and I succeeded at it.&quot; Lean printed and developed his films, and it was his &quot;great hobby&quot;. In 1923, his father deserted the family. Lean later followed a similar path after his own first marriage and child.

==Career==

===Period as film editor===
Bored by his work, Lean spent every evening in the cinema, and in 1927, after an aunt had advised him to find a job he enjoyed, he visited Gaumont Studios where his obvious enthusiasm earned him a month&#x27;s trial without pay. He was taken on as a teaboy, promoted to clapperboy, and soon rose to the position of third assistant director. By 1930 he was working as an editor on newsreels, including those of Gaumont Pictures and Movietone, while his move to feature films began with &quot;Freedom of the Seas&quot; (1934) and &quot;Escape Me Never&quot; (1935).

He edited Gabriel Pascal&#x27;s film productions of two George Bernard Shaw plays, &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1938) and &quot;Major Barbara&quot; (1941). He edited Powell &amp; Pressburger&#x27;s &quot;49th Parallel&quot; (1941) and &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot; (1942). After this last film, Lean began his directing career, after editing more than two dozen features by 1942. As Tony Sloman wrote in 1999, &quot;As the varied likes of David Lean, Robert Wise, Terence Fisher and Dorothy Arzner have proved, the cutting rooms are easily the finest grounding for film direction.&quot; David Lean was given honorary membership of the Guild of British Film Editors in 1968.

===British films===
His first work as a director was in collaboration with Noël Coward on &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (1942), and he later adapted several of Coward&#x27;s plays into successful films. These films are &quot;This Happy Breed&quot; (1944), &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; (1945) and &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; (1945) with Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard as quietly understated clandestine lovers, torn between their unpredictable passion and their respective orderly middle-class marriages in suburban England. The film shared Grand Prix honors at the 1946 Cannes film festival and garnered Lean his first Academy nominations for directing and screen adaptation, and Celia Johnson a nomination for Best Actress. It has since become a classic, one of the most highly regarded British films.

Two celebrated Charles Dickens adaptations followed – &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946) and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948). David Shipman wrote in &quot;The Story of Cinema: Volume Two&quot; (1984): &quot;Of the other Dickens films, only Cukor&#x27;s &quot;David Copperfield&quot; approaches the excellence of this pair, partly because his casting, too, was near perfect&quot;. These two films were the first directed by Lean to star Alec Guinness, whom Lean considered his &quot;good luck charm&quot;. The actor&#x27;s portrayal of Fagin was controversial at the time. The first screening in Berlin during February 1949 offended the surviving Jewish community and led to a riot. It caused problems too in New York, and after private screenings, was condemned by the Anti-Defamation League and the American Board of Rabbis. &quot;To our surprise it was accused of being anti-Semitic&quot;, Lean wrote. &quot;We made Fagin an outsize and, we hoped, an amusing Jewish villain.&quot; The terms of the production code meant that the film&#x27;s release in the United States was delayed until July 1951 after cuts amounting to eight minutes.

The next film directed by Lean was &quot;The Passionate Friends&quot; (1949), an atypical Lean film, but one which marked his first occasion to work with Claude Rains, who played the husband of a woman (Ann Todd) torn between him and an old flame (Howard). &quot;The Passionate Friends&quot; was the first of three films to feature the actress Ann Todd, who became his third wife. &quot;Madeleine&quot; (1950), set in Victorian-era Glasgow is about an 1857 &quot;cause célèbre&quot; with Todd&#x27;s lead character accused of murdering a former lover. &quot;Once more&quot;, writes film critic David Thomson &quot;Lean settles on the pressing need for propriety, but not before the film has put its characters and the audience through a wringer of contradictory feelings.&quot; The last of the films with Todd, &quot;The Sound Barrier&quot; (1952), has a screenplay by the playwright Terence Rattigan and was the first of his three films for Sir Alexander Korda&#x27;s London Films. &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1954), with Charles Laughton in the lead, was based on the play by Harold Brighouse.

===International films===

&quot;Summertime&quot; (1955) marked a new departure for Lean. It was partly American financed, although again made for Korda&#x27;s London Films. The film features Katharine Hepburn in the lead role as a middle-aged American woman who has a romance while on holiday in Venice. It was shot entirely on location there. Although best known for his epics, Lean&#x27;s personal favourite of all his films was &quot;Summertime&quot;, and Hepburn his favourite actress.

====For Columbia and Sam Spiegel====

Lean&#x27;s films now began to become infrequent but much larger in scale and more extensively released internationally. &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957) was based on a novel by Pierre Boulle recounting the story of British and American prisoners of war trying to survive in a Japanese prison camp during the Second World War. The film stars William Holden and Alec Guinness and became the highest-grossing film of 1957 in the United States. It won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Alec Guinness, who had battled with Lean to give more depth to his role as an obsessively correct British commander who is determined to build the best possible bridge for his Japanese captors in Burma.

After extensive location work in the Middle East, North Africa, Spain, and elsewhere, Lean&#x27;s &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; was released in 1962. This was the first project of Lean&#x27;s with a screenplay by playwright Robert Bolt, rewriting an original script by Michael Wilson (one of the two blacklisted writers of &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;). It recounts the life of T. E. Lawrence, the British officer who is depicted in the film as uniting the squabbling Bedouin peoples of the Arab peninsula to fight in World War I and then push on for independence.

After some hesitation, Alec Guinness appeared here in his fourth David Lean film as the Arab leader Prince Faisal, despite his misgivings from their conflicts on &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;. French composer Maurice Jarre, on his first Lean film, created a soaring film score with a famous theme and won his first Oscar for Best Original Score. The film turned actor Peter O&#x27;Toole, playing Lawrence, into an international star. Lean was nominated for ten Oscars, winning seven, including two for Best Director. Lean remains the only British director to win more than one Oscar for directing.

====For MGM====

Lean had his greatest box-office success with &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965), a romance set during the Russian Revolution. The film, based on the Soviet suppressed novel by Nobel Prize-winning Russian poet Boris Pasternak, tells the story of a brilliant and warm-hearted physician and poet (Omar Sharif) who, while seemingly happily married into the Russian aristocracy, and a father, falls in love with a beautiful abandoned young mother named Lara (Julie Christie) and struggles to be with her in the chaos of the Bolshevik revolution and subsequent Russian Civil War.
Initially, reviews for &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; were lukewarm, but critics have since come to see it as one of Lean&#x27;s best films, with film director Paul Greengrass calling it &quot;one of the great masterpieces of cinema&quot;. , it is the 9th highest-grossing film of all time, adjusted for inflation. Producer Carlo Ponti used Maurice Jarre&#x27;s lush romantic score to create a pop tune called &quot;Lara&#x27;s Theme&quot;, which became an international hit song with lyrics under the title &quot;Somewhere My Love&quot;, one of cinema&#x27;s most successful theme songs. The British director of photography, Freddie Young, won an Academy Award for his colour cinematography. Around the same time, Lean also directed some scenes of &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965) while George Stevens was committed to location work in Nevada.

Lean&#x27;s &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1970) was released after an extended period on location in Ireland. A doomed romance set against the backdrop of 1916 Ireland&#x27;s struggles against the British, it is loosely based on Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;. Starring the aging Hollywood &#x27;bad boy&#x27; Robert Mitchum in an uncharacteristic role as a long-suffering Irish husband and British actress Sarah Miles as his faithless young wife, the film received far fewer positive reviews than the director&#x27;s previous work, being particularly savaged by the New York critics. Some critics felt the film&#x27;s massive visual scale on gorgeous Irish beaches and extended running time did not suit its small-scale romantic narrative. Nonetheless, the film was a box office success, earning $31 million and making it the 8th highest-grossing film of that year. It won two Academy Awards the following year, another for cinematographer Freddie Young and for supporting actor John Mills in his role as a village halfwit.

The poor critical reception of the film prompted Lean to meet with the National Society of Film Critics, gathered at the Algonquin Hotel in New York, including &quot;The New Yorker&quot; Pauline Kael, and ask them why they objected to the movie. &quot;I sensed trouble from the moment I sat down&quot;, Lean says of the now famous luncheon. &quot;Time&quot; critic Richard Schickel asked Lean point blank how he, the director of &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;, could have made &quot;a piece of bullshit&quot; like &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. These critics so lacerated the film for two hours to David Lean&#x27;s face that the devastated Lean was put off from making films for a long time. &quot;They just took the film to bits&quot;, said Lean in a later television interview. &quot;It really had such an awful effect on me for several years ... you begin to think that maybe they&#x27;re right. Why on earth am I making films if I don&#x27;t have to? It shakes one&#x27;s confidence terribly.&quot;

===Last years and unfulfilled projects===

====&quot;The Lawbreakers&quot; and &quot;The Long Arm&quot;====
From 1977 until 1980, Lean and Robert Bolt worked on a film adaptation of &quot;Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian&quot;, a dramatized account by Richard Hough of the Mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot;. It was originally to be released as a two-part film, one named &quot;The Lawbreakers&quot; that dealt with the voyage out to Tahiti and the subsequent mutiny, and the second named &quot;The Long Arm&quot; that studied the journey of the mutineers after the mutiny as well as the admiralty&#x27;s response in sending out the frigate HMS &quot;Pandora&quot;, in which some of the mutineers were imprisoned. Lean could not find financial backing for both films after Warner Bros. withdrew from the project; he decided to combine it into one and looked at a seven-part TV series before getting backing from Italian mogul Dino De Laurentiis. The project then suffered a further setback when Bolt suffered a serious stroke and was unable to continue writing; the director felt that Bolt&#x27;s involvement would be crucial to the film&#x27;s success. Melvyn Bragg ended up writing a considerable portion of the script.

Lean was forced to abandon the project after overseeing casting and the construction of the $4 million &quot;Bounty&quot; replica; at the last possible moment, actor Mel Gibson brought in his friend Roger Donaldson to direct the film, as producer De Laurentiis did not want to lose the millions he had already put into the project over what he thought was as insignificant a person as the director dropping out. The film was eventually released as &quot;The Bounty&quot;.

====&quot;A Passage to India&quot;====
Lean then embarked on a project he had pursued since 1960, a film adaptation of &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1984), from E. M. Forster&#x27;s 1924 novel of colonial conflicts in British-occupied India. Entirely shot on location in the sub-continent, this became his last completed film. He rejected a draft by Santha Rama Rau, responsible for the stage adaptation and Forster&#x27;s preferred screenwriter, and wrote the script himself. In addition, Lean also edited the film with the result that his three roles in the production (writer, editor, director) were given equal status in the credits.

Lean recruited long-time collaborators for the cast and crew, including Maurice Jarre (who won another Academy Award for the score), Alec Guinness in his sixth and final role for Lean, as an eccentric Hindu Brahmin, and John Box, the production designer for &quot;Dr. Zhivago&quot;. Reversing the critical response to &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, the film opened to universally enthusiastic reviews; the film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards and Lean himself nominated for three Academy Awards in directing, editing, and writing. His female star, in the complex role of a confused young British woman who falsely accuses an Indian man of attempted rape, gained Australian actress Judy Davis her first Academy nomination. Peggy Ashcroft, as the sensitive Mrs. Moore, won the Oscar for best supporting actress, making her, at 77, the oldest actress to win that award. According to Roger Ebert, it is &quot;one of the greatest screen adaptations I have ever seen&quot;.

====&quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;====
He was signed on to direct a Warner Bros.-backed adaptation of J. G. Ballard&#x27;s autobiographical novel &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; after director Harold Becker left the project. Steven Spielberg was brought on board as a producer for Lean, but later assumed the role of director when Lean dropped out of the project; Spielberg was drawn to the idea of making the film due to his long-time admiration for Lean and his films. &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; was released in 1987.

====&quot;Nostromo&quot;====
During the last years of his life, Lean was in pre-production of a film version of Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Nostromo&quot;. He assembled an all-star cast, including Marlon Brando, Paul Scofield, Anthony Quinn, Peter O&#x27;Toole, Christopher Lambert, Isabella Rossellini and Dennis Quaid, with Georges Corraface as the title character. Lean also wanted Alec Guinness to play Dr. Monygham, but the aged actor turned him down in a letter from 1989: &quot;I believe I would be disastrous casting. The only thing in the part I might have done well is the crippled crab-like walk.&quot; As with &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;, Steven Spielberg came on board as producer with the backing of Warner Bros., but after several rewrites and disagreements on the script, he left the project and was replaced by Serge Silberman, a respected producer at Greenwich Film Productions.

The &quot;Nostromo&quot; project involved several writers, including Christopher Hampton and Robert Bolt, but their work was abandoned. In the end, Lean decided to write the film himself with the assistance of Maggie Unsworth (wife of cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth), with whom he had worked on the scripts for &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;, &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, and &quot;The Passionate Friends&quot;. Originally Lean considered filming in Mexico but later decided to film in London and Madrid, partly to secure O&#x27;Toole, who had insisted he would take part only if the film was shot close to home. &quot;Nostromo&quot; had a total budget of $46 million and was six weeks away from filming at the time of Lean&#x27;s death from throat cancer. It was rumoured that fellow film director John Boorman would take over direction, but the production collapsed. &quot;Nostromo&quot; was finally adapted for the small screen with an unrelated BBC television mini-series in 1997.

==Personal life==
Lean was a long-term resident of Limehouse, East London. His home on Narrow Street is still owned by his family.

His co-writer and producer, Norman Spencer, has said Lean was a &quot;huge womaniser&quot;, and that &quot;to my knowledge, he had almost 1,000 women&quot;. He was married six times, had one son, and at least two grandchildren—from all of whom he was completely estranged—and was divorced five times. He was survived by his last wife Sandra Cooke, art dealer and co-author (with Barry Chattington) of &quot;David Lean: An Intimate Portrait&quot; (2001), and by Peter Lean, his son from his first marriage.

His six wives were:
* Isabel Lean (28 June 1930 – 1936) (his first cousin); one son, Peter.
* Kay Walsh (23 November 1940 – 1949)
* Ann Todd (21 May 1949 – 1957)
* Leila Matkar (4 July 1960 – 1978) (from Hyderabad, India); Lean&#x27;s longest-lasting marriage.
* Sandra Hotz (28 October 1981 – 1984)
* Sandra Cooke (15 December 1990 – 16 April 1991, Lean&#x27;s death)

Lean died in Limehouse, London, on 16 April 1991, at the age of 83. He was interred at Putney Vale Cemetery.

== Honours ==
Lean was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1953, and was knighted for his contributions and services to the arts in 1984. Lean received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1990. In 2012, Lean was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork—the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover—celebrating the British cultural figures of his lifetime that he most admires.

In 1999, the British Film Institute compiled its list of the Top 100 British films. Seven of Lean&#x27;s films appeared on the list:
* &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; (#2)
* &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (#3)
* &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (#5)
* &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (#11)
* &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (#27)
* &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (#46)
* &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (#92)

In addition, on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 1998 list of 100 Years...100 Movies, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; placed 5th, &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; 13th, and &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; 39th. In the 2007 revised edition, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; placed 7th and &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; placed 36th.

With five wins out of six nominations, Lean directed more films that won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography at the Oscars than any other director for: &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; and &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;—the last nomination being for &quot;A Passage to India&quot;.

==Style==
As Lean himself pointed out, his films are often admired by fellow directors as a showcase of the filmmaker&#x27;s art. According to Katharyn Crabbe, &quot;[t]he rewards of watching a David Lean film are most often described in terms of his skillful use of cinematic conventions, his editing, his alertness to the ability of film to create effects.&quot; In his introduction to &quot;David Lean: Interviews&quot;, Steven Organ claims that Lean &quot;often straddl[ed] that fine line between commercialism and artistry. To view one of Lean&#x27;s films is to see the complete spectrum of tools available to the filmmaker – and used to their fullest potential.&quot;

According to David Ehrenstein, &quot;What all [his] brilliant, seemingly disparate works have in common is the clarity and precision of Lean&#x27;s filmmaking technique, as well as his steely resolve in using it to attain poetic grandeur.&quot; Michael Sragow calls Lean &quot;a superb romantic moviemaker and one of the slow but steady innovators of the cinema … Though Lean is usually praised for his &#x27;film sense&#x27;, as though it were divorced from his other faculties, he&#x27;s done as much as men of the theater like Visconti to merge the illusions and grand passions of the stage with the verisimilitude and immediacy of the screen. His ability to combine factual filigree and larger-than-life characters in a sometimes hallucinatory atmosphere has inspired generations of filmmakers to try to fuse the most ruthless documentation with the most elaborate myth-making.&quot; He further highlights Lean&#x27;s use of &quot;highly charged staging and editing and a lucid, fluid realism to depict the contrast between ongoing life and life at its extremes.&quot;

On the occasion of Lean&#x27;s centenary in 2008, writer and broadcaster Andrew Collins praised him as &quot;more than just cinema&#x27;s great choreographer of scale&quot;:

Alain Silver analyses Lean&#x27;s technique as &quot;one that elucidates story and characters through pictures.&quot; He states that Lean is able to subjectify a film&#x27;s perspective through visuals regardless of whether the film has a &quot;third-person&quot; or &quot;first-person&quot; narrative:

Lean was notorious for his perfectionist approach to filmmaking; director Claude Chabrol stated that he and Lean were the only directors working at the time who were prepared to wait &quot;forever&quot; for the perfect sunset, but whereas Chabrol measured &quot;forever&quot; in terms of days, Lean did so in terms of months. Similarly, Hugh Hudson, writing shortly after Lean&#x27;s death in 1991, called him &quot;[a] man driven to achieve the perfect realisation of his ideas and ruthless in that pursuit.&quot; He goes on to describe the filmmaker&#x27;s method of working with actors:

===Themes===
Steven Ross has written that Lean&#x27;s films &quot;reveal a consistently tragic vision of the romantic sensibility attempting to reach beyond the constraints and restrictions of everyday life&quot;, and that they tend to feature &quot;intimate stories of a closely-knit group of characters [whose] fates are indirectly but powerfully shaped by history-shaking events going on around them.&quot; He further observes that, in his work, &quot;setting [is used] as a presence with as much dramatic and thematic form as any character in the film.&quot; Similarly, Lean biographer Gene D. Phillips writes that the director &quot;saw in his style an attraction to characters who refuse to accept defeat, even when their most cherished hopes go unfulfilled. His protagonists seek to transform their lives, but often fail to do so. Pip in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, Colonel Nicholson in &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, and T. E. Lawrence in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, among others, struggle against the limitations of their own personalities to achieve a level of existence that they deem higher or nobler.&quot;

According to Silver, &quot;Lean&#x27;s signature characters are ordinary dreamers and epic visionaries, people who want to transform the world according to their expectations... The tragic flaw in Lean&#x27;s characters is a self-centeredness which can lead to misimpression, which can prevent them from seeing what is so clear to everyone else.&quot; In Sragow&#x27;s view, Lean has &quot;depicted the need for constricted modern men and women either to act out their dreams &quot;or&quot; preserve the life they have by making a scene or putting on a show―indulging in the histrionic to renew their sense of self and purpose.&quot;

Michael Newton of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, analysing &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; and &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, says:

Hudson considers the director an important chronicler of the British character in the 20th century:

Several critics have found a close relationship between style and theme in Lean&#x27;s work. John Orr, author of &quot;Romantics and Modernists in British Cinema&quot;, examines Lean in terms of &quot;the stylised oscillation of romance and restraint that shapes so much of his work&quot;, as well as of &quot;the intersection of culture and nature, where a story&#x27;s momentous events are not only framed against landscape settings but also integrated into the very texture of the image that his camera produces.&quot; He argues that &quot;Lean could have given us kitsch, syrupy imitations of landscape photography, but his staging and cutting blend so fluently that his evocation of the romantic sublime is linked, inextricably, to his &quot;découpage&quot; and sense of place.&quot; In &quot;The Rough Guide to Film&quot;, Tom Charity argues: &quot;It&#x27;s in the cutting that you feel both the romantic ardour and the repression that create the central tension in [Lean&#x27;s] work.&quot;

==Legacy==
Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese in particular are fans of Lean&#x27;s epic films and claim him as one of their primary influences. Spielberg and Scorsese also helped in the 1989 restoration of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, which had been substantially altered both by the studio in theatrical release and in particular in its televised versions; the theatrical re-release greatly revived Lean&#x27;s reputation.

Several of the many other later directors who have acknowledged significant influence by Lean include Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Spike Lee, Sergio Leone, Sir John Boorman, Paul Thomas Anderson, Lawrence Kasdan and Guillermo del Toro.

John Woo once named &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; among his top three films. More recently, Joe Wright (&quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot;, &quot;Atonement&quot;) has cited Lean&#x27;s works, particularly &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, as an important influence on his work, as has director Christopher Nolan (&quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;).

The critical verdict was not unanimous, however. For example, David Thomson, writing about Lean in his &quot;New Biographical Dictionary of Film&quot;, comments: &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Bosley Crowther dismissed &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; as &quot;a huge, thundering camel-opera that tends to run down rather badly as it rolls on into its third hour and gets involved with sullen disillusion and political deceit&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Andrew Sarris remarked that &quot;Lawrence&quot; was &quot;simply another expensive mirage, dull, overlong, and coldly impersonal ... on the whole I find it hatefully calculating and condescending&quot;.

<text>Alexander Boswell, Lord Auchinleck, 8th Laird of Auchinleck (1706–1782) was a Scottish judge who served in the supreme courts of Scotland. He was the father of the author and biographer James Boswell, and grandfather of songwriter Sir Alexander Boswell.

Alexander Boswell was the eldest son of James Boswell (ca. 1672–1749), 7th Laird of Auchinleck. He attended the University of Edinburgh, read Civil Law at the University of Leyden and was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1727.

He was appointed Sheriff of Wigtown in 1748 but resigned the position in 1750 after inheriting the Auchinleck estate in Ayrshire on the death of his father. There he built the present Adam-style Auchinleck House.

In 1754, he built a new aisle in Auchinleck church for Rev. John Dun who was also the family tutor.

Alexander was nominated to the Court of Session in 1754, receiving the additional appointment to the High Court of Justiciary in the following year. As a judge he took the courtesy title &quot;Lord Auchinleck&quot; from the name of his estate, of which he was the 8th Laird. He is noted for rescuing the Auchinleck manuscript in 1740 from a professor of the University of Aberdeen who was in the process of destroying it. He donated the manuscript to the Advocates&#x27; Library in Edinburgh.

He is known for frequently arguing with his son, James Boswell, upon matters such as Boswell&#x27;s career choice, life style, his publishing methods and routes of travel, his friends and even his choice of wife.

==Family==
He married Euphemia Erskine (1718–1766) in 1738; their children included James, John (1743–1798) and (Thomas) David (1748–1826). John joined the Army but was obliged to resign on the grounds of insanity. Thomas David was a merchant trading with Spain before becoming head of the Prize Department of the Navy. After Euphemia&#x27;s death in 1766 he married his cousin Elizabeth Boswell on the same day as his son James&#x27;s marriage in 1769.

<text>A psychologist is a professional who practices psychology and studies mental states, perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and social processes and behavior. Their work often involves the experimentation, observation, and interpretation of how individuals relate to each other and to their environments.

Psychologists usually acquire a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology, followed by a master&#x27;s degree or doctorate in psychology. Unlike psychiatric physicians and psychiatric nurse-practitioners, psychologists usually cannot prescribe medication, but depending on the jurisdiction, some psychologists with additional training can be licensed to prescribe medications; qualification requirements may be different from a bachelor&#x27;s degree and master&#x27;s degree.

Psychologists receive extensive training in psychological testing, communication techniques, scoring, interpretation, and reporting, while psychiatrists are not usually trained in psychological testing. Psychologists are also trained in, and often specialize in, one or more psychotherapies to improve symptoms of many mental disorders, including but not limited to treatment for anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, personality disorders and eating disorders. Treatment from psychologists can be individual or in groups. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a commonly used, well studied and high efficacy psychotherapy practiced by psychologists. Psychologists can work with a range of institutions and people, such as schools, prisons, in a private clinic, in a workplace, or with a sports team.

Applied psychology applies theory to solve problems in human and animal behavior. Applied fields include clinical psychology, counseling psychology, sport psychology, forensic psychology, industrial and organizational psychology, health psychology and school psychology. Licensing and regulations can vary by state and profession.

== Australia ==
In Australia, the psychology profession, and the use of the title &quot;psychologist&quot;, is regulated by an Act of Parliament, the Health Practitioner Regulation (Administrative Arrangements) National Law Act 2008, following an agreement between state and territorial governments. Under this national law, registration of psychologists is administered by the Psychology Board of Australia (PsyBA). Before July 2010, the professional registration of psychologists was governed by various state and territorial Psychology Registration Boards. The Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) oversees education standards for the profession.

The minimum requirements for general registration in psychology, including the right to use the title &quot;psychologist&quot;, are an APAC approved four-year degree in psychology followed by either a two-year master&#x27;s program or two years of practice supervised by a registered psychologist. However, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) is currently in the process of phasing out the 4 + 2 internship pathway. Once the 4 + 2 pathway is phased out, a master&#x27;s degree or PhD will be required to become a psychologist in Australia. This is because of concerns about public safety, and to reduce the burden of training on employers. There is also a &#x27;5 + 1&#x27; registration pathway, including a four-year APAC approved degree followed by one year of postgraduate study and one year of supervised practice. Endorsement within a specific area of practice requires additional qualifications. These notations are not &quot;specialist&quot; titles (Western Australian psychologists could use &quot;specialist&quot; in their titles during a three-year transitional period from 17 October 2010 to 17 October 2013).

Membership with the Australian Psychological Society (APS) differs from registration as a psychologist. The standard route to full membership (MAPS) of the APS usually requires four years of APAC-accredited undergraduate study, plus a master&#x27;s or doctorate in psychology from an accredited institution. An alternate route is available for academics and practitioners who have gained appropriate experience and made a substantial contribution to the field of psychology.

Restrictions apply to all individuals using the title &quot;psychologist&quot; in all states and territories of Australia. However, the terms &quot;psychotherapist&quot;, &quot;social worker&quot;, and &quot;counselor&quot; are currently self-regulated, with several organizations campaigning for government regulation.

== Belgium ==
Since 1933, the title &quot;psychologist&quot; has been protected by law in Belgium. It can only be used by people who are on the National Government Commission list. The minimum requirement is the completion of five years of university training in psychology (master&#x27;s degree or equivalent). The title of &quot;psychotherapist&quot; is not legally protected. As of 2016, Belgian law recognizes the clinical psychologist as an autonomous health profession. It reserves the practice of psychotherapy to medical doctors, clinical psychologists and clinical orthopedagogists.

== Canada ==
A professional in the U.S. or Canada must hold a graduate degree in psychology (MA, Psy.D., Ed.D., or Ph.D.), or have a provincial license to use the title &quot;psychologist&quot;.
Provincial regulators include:
* Alberta: College of Alberta Psychologists
* British Columbia: College of Psychologists of British Columbia
* Manitoba: Psychological Association of Manitoba
* Newfoundland and Labrador: Newfoundland and Labrador Psychology Board
* New Brunswick: College of Psychologists of New Brunswick
* Northwest Territories: Office of the Registrar, Northwest Territories (NWT) Professional Licensing
* Nova Scotia: Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology
* Nunavut: Registrar, Professional Licensing Kugluktuk
* Ontario: College of Psychologists of Ontario
* Prince Edward Island: Prince Edward Island Psychologists Registration Board
* Quebec: Order of Psychologists of Quebec
* Saskatchewan: Saskatchewan College of Psychologists

== Dominican Republic ==
A professional psychologist in the Dominican Republic must have a suitable qualification and be a member of the Dominican College of Psychologists.

== Finland ==
In Finland, the title &quot;psychologist&quot; is protected by law. The restriction for psychologists (licensed professionals) is governed by National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (Finland) (Valvira). It takes 330 ECTS-credits (about six years) to complete the university studies (master&#x27;s degree). There are about 6,200 licensed psychologists in Finland.

== Germany ==
In Germany, the use of the title (Dipl.-Psych.) is restricted by law, and a practitioner is legally required to hold the corresponding academic title, which is comparable to a M.Sc. degree and requires at least five years of training at a university. Originally, a diploma degree in psychology awarded in Germany included the subject of clinical psychology. With the Bologna-reform, this degree was replaced by a master&#x27;s degree. The academic degree of or M.Sc. (Psychologie) does not include a psychotherapeutic qualification, which requires three to five years of additional training. The psychotherapeutic training combines in-depth theoretical knowledge with supervised patient care and self-reflection units. After having completed the training requirements, psychologists take a state-run exam, which, upon successful completion (Approbation), confers the official title of &quot;psychological psychotherapist&quot; (). After many years of inter-professional political controversy, non-physician psychotherapy was given an adequate legal foundation through the creation of two new academic healthcare professions.

== Greece ==
Since 1979, the title &quot;psychologist&quot; has been protected by law in Greece. It can only be used by people who hold a relevant license or certificate, which is issued by the Greek authorities, to practice as a psychologist. The minimum requirement is the completion of university training in psychology at a Greek university, or at a university recognized by the Greek authorities. Psychologists in Greece are legally required to abide by the Code of Conduct of Psychologists (2019). Psychologists in Greece are not required to register with any psychology body in the country in order to legally practice the profession. Titles such as &quot;psychotherapist&quot; or &quot;counselor&quot; are not protected by law in Greece and anyone may call themselves a &quot;psychotherapist&quot; or &quot;counselor&quot; without having earned a graduate degree in psychology.

== India ==
In India, &quot;clinical psychologist&quot; is specifically defined in the Mental Health Act, 2017. An MPhil in Clinical Psychology degree of two years duration recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India is required to apply for registration as a clinical psychologist. PsyD and Professional diploma in Clinical Psychology is also a less popular way to get license of Clinical Psychologist in India. This procedure has been criticized by some stakeholders since clinical psychology is not limited to the area of rehabilitation. Titles such as &quot;counselor&quot;, &quot;psychoanalyst&quot;, &quot;psychoeducator&quot; or &quot;psychotherapist&quot; are not protected at present. In other words, an individual may call themselves a &quot;psychotherapist&quot; or &quot;counselor&quot; without having any recognized degree from Rehabilitation council of India and without having to register with the Rehabilitation Council of India. Rehabilitation psychologists also require a license from RCI to practice. Psychologs magazine is the major media, working on mental health awareness. Tele-MANAS is a nationwide governmental program launched by Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare in October 2021.

== New Zealand ==
In New Zealand, the use of the title &quot;psychologist&quot; is restricted by law. Prior to 2004, only the title &quot;registered psychologist&quot; was restricted to people qualified and registered as such. However, with the proclamation of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act, in 2003, the use of the title &quot;psychologist&quot; was limited to practitioners registered with the New Zealand Psychologists Board. The titles &quot;clinical psychologist&quot;, &quot;counseling psychologist&quot;, &quot;educational psychologist&quot;, &quot;intern psychologist&quot;, and &quot;trainee psychologist&quot; are similarly protected. This is to protect the public by providing assurance that the title-holder is registered and therefore qualified and competent to practice, and can be held accountable. The legislation does not include an exemption clause for any class of practitioner (e.g., academics, or government employees).

== Norway ==
In Norway, the title &quot;psychologist&quot; is restricted by law and can only be obtained by completing a six-year integrated program, leading to the Candidate of Psychology degree. Psychologists are considered health personnel, and their work is regulated through the &quot;health personnel act&quot;.

== South Africa ==
In South Africa, psychologists are qualified in either clinical, counseling, educational, organizational, or research psychology.
As below, qualification requires at least five years of study, and at least one of internship.

To become qualified, one must complete a recognized master&#x27;s degree in Psychology, an appropriate practicum at a recognized training institution, and take an examination set by the Professional Board for Psychology. Registration with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) is required and includes a Continuing Professional Development component.

The practicum usually involves a full year internship, and in some specializations, the HPCSA requires completion of an additional year of community service. The master&#x27;s program consists of seminars, coursework-based theoretical and practical training, and a dissertation of limited scope, and is (in most cases) two years in duration. 
Prior to enrolling in the master&#x27;s program, the student studies psychology for three years as an undergraduate (B.A. or B.Sc., and, for organizational psychology, also B.Com.), followed by an additional postgraduate honours degree in psychology; see List of universities in South Africa. 

The undergraduate B.Psyc. is a four-year program integrating theory and practical training, and—with the required examination set by the Professional Board for Psychology—is sufficient for practice as a psychometrist or counselor.

== United Kingdom ==
In the UK, &quot;registered psychologist&quot; and &quot;practitioner psychologist&quot; are protected titles. The title of &quot;neuropsychologist&quot; is not protected. In addition, the following specialist titles are also protected by law: &quot;clinical psychologist&quot;, &quot;counselling psychologist&quot;, &quot;educational psychologist&quot;, &quot;forensic psychologist&quot;, &quot;health psychologist&quot;, &quot;occupational psychologist&quot; and &quot;sport and exercise psychologist&quot;. The Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) is the statutory regulator for practitioner psychologists in the UK. In the UK, the use of the title &quot;chartered psychologist&quot; is also protected by statutory regulation, but that title simply means that the psychologist is a chartered member of the British Psychological Society, but is not necessarily registered with the HCPC. However, it is illegal for someone who is not in the appropriate section of the HCPC register to provide psychological services. The requirement to register as a clinical, counselling, or educational psychologist is a professional doctorate (and in the case of the latter two the British Psychological Society&#x27;s Professional Qualification, which meets the standards of a professional doctorate). The title of &quot;psychologist&quot;, by itself, is not protected. The British Psychological Society is working with the HCPC to ensure that the title of &quot;neuropsychologist&quot; is regulated as a specialist title for practitioner psychologists.

=== Employment ===
, in the United Kingdom, there are 19,000 practitioner psychologists registered across seven categories: clinical psychologist, counselling psychologist, educational psychologist, forensic psychologist, health psychologist, occupational psychologist, sport and exercise psychologist. At least 9,500 of these are clinical psychologists, which is the largest group of psychologists in clinical settings such as the NHS. Around 2,000 are educational psychologists.

In the United States and Canada, full membership in each country&#x27;s professional association—American Psychological Association (APA) and Canadian Psychological Association (CPA), respectively—requires doctoral training (except in some Canadian provinces, such as Alberta, where a master&#x27;s degree is sufficient). The minimal requirement for full membership can be waived in circumstances where there is evidence that significant contribution or performance in the field of psychology has been made. Associate membership requires at least two years of postgraduate studies in psychology or an approved related discipline.

Some U.S. schools offer accredited programs in clinical psychology resulting in a master&#x27;s degree. Such programs can range from forty-eight to eighty-four units, most often taking two to three years to complete after the undergraduate degree. Training usually emphasizes theory and treatment over research, quite often with a focus on school or couples and family counseling. Similar to doctoral programs, master&#x27;s level students usually must complete a clinical practicum under supervision; some programs also require a minimum amount of personal psychotherapy. While many graduates from master&#x27;s level training go on to doctoral psychology programs, a large number also go directly into practice—often as a licensed professional counselor (LPC), marriage and family therapist (MFT), or other similar licensed practice, which varies by state.

There is stiff competition to gain acceptance into clinical psychology doctoral programs (acceptance rates of 2–5% are not uncommon). Clinical psychologists in the U.S. undergo many years of graduate training—usually five to seven years after the bachelor&#x27;s degree—to gain demonstrable competence and experience. Licensure as a psychologist may take an additional one to two years post-PhD/PsyD. Some states require a 1-year postdoctoral residency, while others do not require postdoctoral supervised experience and allow psychology graduates to sit for the licensure exam immediately. Some psychology specialties, such as clinical neuropsychology, require a 2-year postdoctoral experience regardless of the state, as set forth in the Houston Conference Guidelines. Today in America, about half of all clinical psychology graduate students are being trained in PhD programs that emphasize melding research with practice and are conducted by universities—with the other half in PsyD programs, which less focus on research (similar to professional degrees for medicine and law). Both types of doctoral programs (PhD and PsyD) envision practicing clinical psychology in a research-based, scientifically valid manner, and most are accredited by the APA.

APA accreditation is very important for U.S. clinical, counseling, and school psychology programs because graduating from a non-accredited doctoral program may adversely affect employment prospects and present a hurdle for becoming licensed in some jurisdictions.

Doctorate (PhD and PsyD) programs usually involve some variation on the following 5 to 7 year, 90–120 unit curriculum:

:*Bases of behavior—biological, cognitive-affective, and cultural-social
:*Individual differences—personality, lifespan development, psychopathology
:*History and systems—development of psychological theories, practices and scientific knowledge
:*Clinical practice—diagnostics, psychological assessment, psychotherapeutic interventions, psychopharmacology, ethical and legal issues
:*Coursework in statistics and research design
:* Clinical experience
:**Practicum—usually three or four years of working with clients under supervision in a clinical setting. Most practicum placements begin in either the first or second year of doctoral training.
:**Doctoral internship—usually an intensive one or two-year placement in a clinical setting
:* Dissertation—PhD programs usually require original quantitative empirical research, while PsyD dissertations involve original quantitative or qualitative research, theoretical scholarship, program evaluation or development, critical literature analysis or clinical application and analysis. The dissertation typically takes 2–3 years to complete.
:*Specialized electives—many programs offer sets of elective courses for specializations, such as health, child/adolescent, family, community, or neuropsychology.
:* Personal psychotherapy—many programs require students to undertake a certain number of hours of personal psychotherapy (with a non-faculty therapist) although in recent years this requirement has become less frequent.
:* Comprehensive exams or master&#x27;s thesis: a thesis can involve original data collection and is distinct from a dissertation.
Psychologists can be seen as practicing within two general categories of psychology: health service psychology, which includes &quot;practitioners&quot; or &quot;professionals&quot; and research-oriented psychology which includes &quot;scientists&quot; or &quot;scholars&quot;. The training models (Boulder and Vail models) endorsed by the APA require that health service psychologists be trained as both researchers and practitioners, and that they possess advanced degrees.

Psychologists typically have one of two degrees: PsyD or PhD. The PsyD program prepares the student primarily as a practitioner for clinical practice (e.g., testing, psychotherapy), but also as a scholar that consumes research. Depending on the specialty (industrial/organizational, social, clinical, school, etc.), a PhD may be trained in clinical practice as well as in scientific methodology, to prepare for a career in academia or research. Both the PsyD and PhD programs prepare students to take the national psychology licensing exam, the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP).

Within the two main categories are many further types of psychologists as reflected by APA&#x27;s 54 Divisions, which are specialty or subspecialty or topical areas, including clinical, counseling, and school psychologists. Such professionals work with persons in a variety of therapeutic contexts. People often think of the discipline as involving only such clinical or counseling psychologists. While counseling and psychotherapy are common activities for psychologists, these health service psychology fields are just two branches in the larger domain of psychology. There are other classifications such as industrial and organizational and community psychologists, whose professionals mainly apply psychological research, theories, and techniques to &quot;real-world&quot; problems of business, industry, social benefit organizations, government, and academia.

==== APA-recognized specialties ====
* Clinical psychology
* Clinical neuropsychology
* Clinical child and adolescent psychology
*School psychology
*Behavioral and cognitive psychology
* Couple and family psychology
* Clinical health psychology
* Geropsychology
* Police and public safety psychology
* Sleep psychology
* Rehabilitation psychology
* Group psychology and group psychotherapy
* Forensic psychology
* Industrial and organizational psychology
* Psychoanalysis
* Counseling psychology
* Serious mental illness psychology
* Clinical psychopharmacology

Clinical psychologists receive training in a number of psychological therapies, including behavioral, cognitive, humanistic, existential, psychodynamic, and systemic approaches, as well as in-depth training in psychological testing, and to some extent, neuropsychological testing. 

==== Services ====
Clinical psychologists can offer a range of professional services, including:

* Psychological treatment (psychotherapy)
* Administering, scoring, and interpreting psychological tests
* Prescribing medications (in six states)
* Conducting psychological research
* Teaching
* Developing prevention programs
* Consulting
* Program administration
* Expert testimony
*Supervision of students or other mental health professionals

In practice, clinical psychologists might work with individuals, couples, families, or groups in a variety of settings, including private practices, hospitals, community mental health centers, schools, businesses, and non-profit agencies.

Most clinical psychologists who engage in research and teaching do so within a college or university setting. Clinical psychologists may also choose to specialize in a particular field.

===== Prescriptive Authority for Psychologists (RxP) =====
Psychologists in the United States campaigned for legislative changes to enable specially-trained psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medications. Legislation in Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, New Mexico, Illinois, and Colorado has granted those who complete an additional master&#x27;s degree program in clinical psychopharmacology authority to prescribe medications for mental and emotional disorders. , Louisiana is the only state where the licensing and regulation of the practice of medical psychology by medical psychologists (MPs) is regulated by a medical board (the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners) rather than a board of psychologists. While other states have pursued prescriptive authority, they have not succeeded. Similar legislation in the states of Hawaii and Oregon passed through their respective legislative bodies, but in each case the legislation was vetoed by the state&#x27;s governor.
In 1989, the U.S Department of Defense was directed to create the Psychopharmacology Demonstration Project (PDP). By 1997, ten psychologists were trained in psychopharmacology and granted the ability to prescribe psychiatric medications.

==== Licensure ====
The practice of clinical psychology requires a license in the United States and Canada. Although each of the U.S. states is different in terms of requirements and licenses (see and for examples), there are three common requirements:

# Graduation from an accredited school with the appropriate degree
# Completion of supervised clinical experience
# Passing a written and/or oral examination

All U.S. state and Canada provincial licensing boards are members of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) which created and maintains the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP). Many states require other examinations in addition to the EPPP, such as a jurisprudence (i.e., mental health law) examination or an oral examination. Nearly all states also require a certain number of continuing education credits per year in order to renew a license. Licensees can obtain this through various means, such as taking audited classes and attending approved workshops.

There are professions whose scope of practice overlaps with the practice of psychology (particularly with respect to providing psychotherapy) and for which a license is required.

==== Ambiguity of title ====
To practice with the title of &quot;psychologist&quot;, in almost all cases a doctoral degree is required (PhD, PsyD, or EdD in the U.S.). Normally, after the degree, the practitioner must fulfill a certain number of supervised postdoctoral hours ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 (usually taking one to two years), and pass the EPPP and any other state or provincial exams. By and large, a professional in the U.S. must hold a doctoral degree in psychology (PsyD, EdD, or PhD), and/or have a state license to use the title &quot;psychologist&quot;. However, regulations vary from state to state. For example, in the states of Michigan, West Virginia, and Vermont, there are psychologists licensed at the master&#x27;s level.

==== Differences with psychiatrists ====
Although clinical psychologists and psychiatrists share the same fundamental aim—the alleviation of mental distress—their training, outlook, and methodologies are often different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licensed physicians, and, as such, psychiatrists are apt to use the medical model to assess mental health problems and to also employ psychotropic medications as a method of addressing mental health problems.

Psychologists generally do not prescribe medication, although in some jurisdictions they do have prescription privileges. In five U.S. states (New Mexico, Louisiana, Illinois, Iowa, Idaho, and Colorado), psychologists with clinical psychopharmacology training have been granted prescriptive authority for mental health disorders.

Psychologists receive extensive training in psychological test administration, scoring, interpretation, and reporting, while psychiatrists are not trained in psychological testing. In addition, psychologists (particularly those from PhD programs) spend several years in graduate school being trained to conduct behavioral research; their training includes research design and advanced statistical analysis. While this training is available for physicians via dual MD/PhD programs, it is not typically included in standard medical education, although psychiatrists may develop research skills during their residency or a psychiatry fellowship (post-residency).

Psychiatrists, as licensed physicians, have been trained more intensively in other areas, such as internal medicine and neurology, and may bring this knowledge to bear in identifying and treating medical or neurological conditions that present with primarily psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, or paranoia (e.g., hypothyroidism presenting with depressive symptoms, or pulmonary embolism with significant apprehension and anxiety).

=== Mental health professions ===
* Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT). An MFT license requires a doctorate or master&#x27;s degree. In addition, it usually involves two years of post-degree clinical experience under supervision, and licensure requires passing a written exam, commonly the National Examination for Marriage and Family Therapists, which is maintained by the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. In addition, most states require an oral exam. MFTs, as the title implies, work mostly with families and couples, addressing a wide range of common psychological problems. Some jurisdictions have exemptions that let someone practice marriage and family therapy without meeting the requirements for a license. That is, they offer a license but do not require that marriage and family therapists obtain one.
* Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC). Similar to the MFT, the LPC license requires a master&#x27;s or doctorate degree, a minimum number of hours of supervised clinical experience in a pre-doc practicum, and the passing of the National Counselor Exam. Similar licenses are the Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC), Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor (LCPC), and Clinical Counselor in Mental Health (CCMH). In some states, after passing the exam, a temporary LPC license is awarded and the clinician may begin the normal 3000-hour supervised internship leading to the full license allowing to practice as a counselor or psychotherapist, usually under the supervision of a licensed psychologist. Some jurisdictions have exemptions that allow counseling to practice without meeting the requirements for a license. That is, they offer a license but do not require that counselors obtain one.
* Licensed Psychological Associate (LPA) Twenty-six states offer a master&#x27;s-only license, a common one being the LPA, which allows for the therapist to either practice independently, or, more commonly, under the supervision of a licensed psychologist, depending on the state. Common requirements are two to four years of post-master&#x27;s supervised clinical experience and passing a Psychological Associates Examination. Other titles for this level of licensing include psychological technician (Alabama), psychological assistant (California), licensed clinical psychotherapist (Kansas), licensed psychological practitioner (Minnesota), licensed behavioral practitioner (Oklahoma), licensed psychological associate (North Carolina) or psychological examiner (Tennessee).
* Licensed behavior analysts

Licensed behavior analysts are licensed in five states to provide services for clients with substance abuse, developmental disabilities, and mental illness. This profession draws on the evidence base of applied behavior analysis and the philosophy of behaviorism. Behavior analysts have at least a master&#x27;s degree in behavior analysis or in a mental health related discipline, as well as having taken at least five core courses in applied behavior analysis. Many behavior analysts have a doctorate. Most programs have a formalized internship program, and several programs are offered online. Most practitioners have passed the examination offered by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board The model licensing act for behavior analysts can be found at the Association for Behavior Analysis International&#x27;s website.

=== Employment ===
In the United States, of 181,600 jobs for psychologists in 2021, 123,300 are employed in clinical, counseling, and school positions; 2,900 are employed in industrial-organizational positions, and 55,400 are in &quot;all other&quot; positions.

The median salary in the U.S. for clinical, counseling, and school psychologists in May 2021 was US$82,510 and the median salary for industrial-organizational psychologists was US$105,310.

Psychologists can work in applied or academic settings. Academic psychologists educate higher education students, as well as conduct research, with graduate-level research being an important part of academic psychology. Academic positions can be tenured or non-tenured, with tenured positions being highly desirable.

<text>The cinema of New Zealand refers to films made by New Zealand–based production companies in New Zealand or films made about New Zealand by filmmakers from other countries. New Zealand produces many films that are co-financed by overseas companies.

The history of cinema in New Zealand is almost as long as the medium itself. The first public screening of a motion picture took place in 1896. A documentary made in 1900 is the oldest surviving New Zealand film, while the first feature film made in New Zealand premiered in 1914. A small-scale industry developed between the 1920s and the 1960s, but it was not until the 1970s that locally made films began to attract significant audiences.

From the 1990s onward, New Zealand-made films have increasingly achieved international success, including both those with local funding and themes, and those with additional foreign cooperation, such as &quot;Avatar&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy.

For a list of the 328 feature films and 117 documentaries made in New Zealand, see List of New Zealand Films.

==Defining New Zealand film==
In October 1978, the New Zealand Film Commission was formalised by Parliament under the Third National Government.

Under Section 17 of the New Zealand Film Commission Act 1978, the functions of the commission are to:
* Encourage and assist in the making, promotion, distribution and exhibition of films
* Encourage and promote cohesion with NZ film industry
* Encourage and promote maintenance of films in archives

With this Act, the New Zealand film industry became more stabilised. Section 18 of the Act, entitled &quot;Content of Films&quot;, defines what makes &quot;a New Zealand film&quot;. To qualify, a film must have &quot;significant New Zealand content&quot;, judged by taking into account the following:
* The subject of the film (settings, characters, source material, etc.)
* The locations at which the film was made
* The nationalities or places of residence of:
** the authors, scriptwriters, composers, producers, directors, actors, technicians, editors, etc.
** the owners of any company, partnership, or joint venture involved in making the film
** the copyright holders
* The sources from which the money is derived
* The ownership and whereabouts of the equipment and technical facilities

These defining aspects have in recent years caused debate on whether films like &quot;The Frighteners&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; qualify as New Zealand films. The impact of the New Zealand Film Commission upon the industry was significant in getting films made, coming to a definition of &quot;New Zealand Film&quot;, and helped to establish a screen industry in New Zealand.

Most New Zealand films are made by independent filmmakers, often on a low budget and with sponsorship from public funding sources. Few New Zealand-made films have been specifically commissioned for the international market by international film distributors.

Recently, international film companies have become more aware of the skills of New Zealand filmmakers, and have increasingly used the country as a shooting location and also somewhere to finish production of their feature films.

Private funding for New Zealand films has often been in short supply, although for a period in the early 1980s, tax breaks resulted in a short term production boom. Some New Zealand directors and actors have been ignored in large part by their own country, despite success overseas, and often had to work in the US, Australia, and the UK as a result.

==History==
===Early film: 1890s–1920s===

The first public screening of a motion picture in New Zealand took place on 13 October 1896 at the Opera House in Auckland. The screening—which was in fact a demonstration of Thomas Edison&#x27;s kinetograph—was part of a show presented by Charles Godfrey&#x27;s Vaudeville Company. The first screening of a colour film—one using a colour process, not just a colourised black-and-white film—was on 24 December 1911 in Auckland. The film was shown simultaneously at the Globe Picture Theatre in Queen Street and the Kings Theatre on Upper Pitt Street (now the Mercury Theatre).

The first filmmaker in New Zealand was Alfred Henry Whitehouse, who made ten films between 1898 and mid-1900. The oldest surviving New Zealand film is Whitehouse&#x27;s &quot;The Departure of the Second Contingent for the Boer War&quot; (1900).

The first feature film made in New Zealand is arguably &quot;Hinemoa&quot;. It premiered on 17 August 1914 at the Lyric Theatre, Auckland. 

New Zealand&#x27;s oldest surviving cinema is in Roxburgh in Central Otago, which opened in the town&#x27;s Athenæum Hall on 11 December 1897. The editors of the local newspaper, the &quot;Mount Benger Mail&quot;, wrote in the issue of 10 December: &quot;&quot;We would draw the attention of the public to the Salon Cinématographe entertainment in the Athenæum Hall to-morrow evening. This is an opportunity which should not be missed of witnessing life scenes&quot;.&quot; 

Purpose-built cinemas were built from 1910 onwards, with the first being Wellington&#x27;s The Kings, built in 1910. Another example is the Mayfair Theatre in Dunedin, built in 1913. The oldest surviving purpose-built cinema in New Zealand — and in the Southern Hemisphere — is the Victoria Theatre in Devonport, Auckland, built in 1912.

===The classical era: 1920s–1960s===
New Zealand&#x27;s was a small-scale film industry between the 1920s and 1960s. In the 1920s and 1930s, Rudall Hayward made a number of feature films on New Zealand themes. &quot;Rewi&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; was probably his best, but little of this 1925 film survives. The film was remade with sound in 1940. Independent filmmaker John O&#x27;Shea was active from 1940 to 1970 making New Zealand cinema; his company Pacific Films produced numerous short films as well as the three New Zealand feature films made in that period: &quot;Broken Barrier&quot; (1952) with Roger Mirams; &quot;Runaway&quot; (1964); and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Get You&quot; (1966).

However, most New Zealand-made films of the period were documentaries. The National Film Unit was a government-funded producer of short films, documentaries, and publicity material. &quot;This is New Zealand&quot;, a short film made for the World Expo in 1970, was extremely popular there and subsequently screened in New Zealand cinemas, garnering considerable acclaim. It used three separate projectors to create a wide-screen image. The film was restored in 2006 and shown at the 2007 New Zealand International Film Festivals.

===Establishment of the New Zealand Film Commission: 1970s–1980s===
In 1978, the New Zealand Film Commission was established. Its aim was to encourage and promote the national film industry, and a number of film projects have been funded by the commission.

One of the first New Zealand films to attract large-scale audiences at home was &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;, directed by Roger Donaldson in 1977. The film, a dark, political action thriller that portrays the reaction of one man to the formation of a totalitarian government and the ensuing guerrilla war, introduced Sam Neill as a leading actor. The imagery of large-scale civil conflict and government repression would be realised only a few years later when the 1981 Springbok Tour caused nationwide protests and clashes with police.

&quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot; is also notable as the first full-length 35mm feature film made entirely by a New Zealand production crew. Before then, films such as 1973&#x27;s &quot;Rangi&#x27;s Catch&quot; had been shot in New Zealand, where they were set, but were produced and directed by foreign crews.

1981 saw the release of the road film &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie&quot;, which made NZ$1.5 million. Director Geoff Murphy was lured away by Hollywood, but he made two other key New Zealand films: &quot;Utu&quot; (1983), about the land wars of the 1860s, and a nuclear-apocalypse science-fiction story, &quot;The Quiet Earth&quot; (1985). Bruno Lawrence, who appeared in both films, became a star.

Melanie Read was the first woman to write and direct a New Zealand feature film with the 1984 thriller &quot;Trial Run&quot;. In 1987 Barry Barclay&#x27;s film &quot;Ngati&quot;, screenplay by Tama Poata and starring veteran actor Wi Kuki Kaa, was released to critical acclaim and some box-office success. &quot;Ngati&quot; is recognised as the first feature film to be written and directed by a person of Māori descent.

Merata Mita was the first Māori woman to write and direct a dramatic feature film, when she directed &quot;Mauri&quot; in 1988. An accomplished documentary film-maker, Mita made landmark documentaries including &quot;Bastion Point: Day 507&quot; (1980), about the occupation of land there, and &quot;Patu!&quot; (1983), a film about the controversial and violent anti-apartheid protests during the 1981 Springboks rugby tour from South Africa.

The late 1980s saw the reinvention of the New Zealand short film, beginning with Alison Maclean&#x27;s &quot;Kitchen Sink&quot;. Instead of trying to be short features focused on dialogue and character, the new shorts tried instead to &quot;push the envelope&quot; in terms of visual design and cinematic grammar. An explosion of visually rich and compelling works emerged that seemed to have more in common with European art-house cinema than Hollywood.

Key examples of these are: &quot;The Lounge Bar&quot; (The Front Lawn), &quot;Kitchen Sink&quot; (Alison Maclean), &quot;A Little Death&quot; (Simon Perkins; Paul Swadel), &quot;Stroke&quot; (Christine Jeffs), &quot;La Vie en Rose&quot; (Anna Reeves), &quot;A Game With No Rules&quot; (Scott Reynolds), &quot;Eau de la vie&quot; (Simon Baré), &quot;O Tamaiti (The Children)&quot; (Sima Urale) which won the Silver Lion Best Short Film at the Venice Film Festival, and &quot;Two Cars, One Night&quot; (Taika Waititi), which was nominated for the Best Short Film Oscar.

===International breakthrough: 1990–2000===

The early 1990s saw New Zealand film gain international recognition, most obviously with Jane Campion&#x27;s &quot;The Piano&quot; (1993), which won three Academy Awards. Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; (1994) and Lee Tamahori&#x27;s &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot; also received international acclaim and high grosses in a number of countries. &quot;The Piano&quot; and &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; showed an increasing tendency for New Zealand films to be partially or completely funded by overseas production companies, and star non-local actors (for example, Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel in &quot;The Piano&quot;, and Kate Winslet in &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;). This did not stop the migration of New Zealanders to the United States: Tamahori, Melanie Lynskey of &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; and Canadian-born &quot;Piano&quot; star Anna Paquin are now all primarily based in America.

A notable exception to the migration tendency is Peter Jackson, who continued to make films in New Zealand. Jackson&#x27;s career began with low-budget comedies such as &quot;Bad Taste&quot; (1987) and &quot;Meet the Feebles&quot; (1989). He was eventually noticed by Hollywood, and in the 2000s directed &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series. Although made with mainly foreign funding (helped by a tax break from the New Zealand government) and featuring a primarily international cast, Jackson filmed the films in New Zealand, using a largely local production crew, helping create an enormous skill base in the New Zealand film industry.

This has led to a number of prominent Hollywood films being made in New Zealand, with major international productions not only filming there but also using the country&#x27;s various post-production facilities and special effects companies. Among these films are &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; and &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. While the funding for these movies has come largely from the United States, the trend has helped New Zealand film studios and filmmakers develop skills and improve facilities.
However, some industry figures claim that having large international productions employ New Zealand crews has its downside. One New Zealand filmmaker recently complained that it has become difficult to employ cameramen on a low-budget New Zealand film, as cameramen are now used to large wages. Other filmmakers find that the opposite is true, and argue that the greater number of local professionals may have driven wages down from the relative heights of the 1980s. 

===Since 2001===

In early 21st century, the amount of local content has significantly increased, with &quot;Whale Rider&quot; (2002) becoming the second-highest-grossing North American independent film of 2003 and third-highest worldwide, earning $40.1 million. Other notable films include &quot;In My Father&#x27;s Den&quot; (2004) and &quot;The World&#x27;s Fastest Indian&quot; (2005). Both films did well at the New Zealand box office, with the latter beating &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot; to become the highest-grossing New Zealand film at the domestic box office, earning over 6.5 million; a record beaten by &quot;Boy&quot; in 2010&quot;.&quot;

Sam Neill and Judy Rymer&#x27;s documentary &quot;Cinema of Unease&quot; was made in 1995. 
The latter part of the first decade of the new century saw the expansion of Peter Jackson&#x27;s filmmaking empire, with the producer-director optioning the rights to &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;, &quot;Halo&quot;, &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; and the fantasy series &quot;Temeraire&quot;. Major productions such as &quot;Avatar&quot; and the 2007 blockbuster &quot;The Water Horse&quot; used Jackson&#x27;s Wellington studios and the services of the special-effects company Weta Digital. US-based video game company Unity Software bought Weta Digital for $1.63bn in 2021.

&quot;Eagle vs Shark&quot; (2007) was director Taika Waititi&#x27;s first feature film, starring Jemaine Clement and Loren Horsley. The film earned over at the box office. Waititi&#x27;s film &quot;Boy&quot;, released in 2010, topped the box office receipts for the opening week, earning more on its opening day than any previous locally made film, becoming the highest-grossing New Zealand film of all time. In 2014 the mockumentary &quot;What We Do in the Shadows&quot;, directed by Waititi and Clement, was released to substantial critical acclaim. Two years later, Waititi released &quot;Hunt for the Wilderpeople,&quot; starring Sam Neill and Julian Dennison, a film that became the new highest-grossing opening weekend box office New Zealand film on home soil, beating the record set by &quot;Boy&quot; six years prior.

New Zealand is grappling with the effect of international streaming platforms in the New Zealand market. In 2023 the New Zealand&#x27;s screen producers&#x27; guild, SPADA pointed out international streamers currently &#x27;pay no tax in New Zealand, face no regulation, and use broadband infrastructure partially funded by our Government while at the same time impact local broadcasting viewership and advertising revenue&#x27;. Regulating this would be in-line with many other countries.

==New Zealand Film Archive==

The New Zealand Film Archive was founded and incorporated on 9 March 1981. Film enthusiast, critic and historian Jonathan Dennis (19532002) was a driving force behind the archive, and became its first director. The archive was set up to preserve and restore significant New Zealand film and television images. It now holds a collection of much of early New Zealand cinema film and holds public screenings of its collection.

Much of the early cinema film made in New Zealand has been lost, as it was printed on nitrate, which is unstable. In 1992, when film enthusiasts and the New Zealand Film Archive realised how much of New Zealand&#x27;s film heritage was being lost, they mounted the &quot;Last Film Search&quot; and found 7,000 significant films, both in New Zealand and around the world.

<text>Lokasenna (Old Norse: &#x27;The Flyting of Loki&#x27;, or &#x27;Loki&#x27;s Verbal Duel&#x27;) is one of the poems of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. The poem presents flyting between the gods and Loki. It is written in the ljóðaháttr metre, typical for wisdom verse. &quot;Lokasenna&quot; is believed to be a 10th-century poem.

Loki, amongst other things, accuses the gods of moralistic sexual impropriety, the practice of &quot;seiðr&quot; (sorcery), and bias. Not ostensibly the most serious of allegations, these elements are, however, said ultimately to lead to the onset of Ragnarök in the Eddic poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;. However, &quot;Lokasenna&quot; does not &quot;directly&quot; state that Loki&#x27;s binding is as a consequence of the killing of Baldr. This is explicitly stated only in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;.

Lee M. Hollander, in his introduction to his translation of the poem, claims that it was in no sense a popular lay and suggests we should not necessarily believe that the accusations of the &quot;sly god&quot; were an accepted part of the lore.

==Plot==
The setting is a feast given by the sea god Ægir. In continuity, the prose introduction says: &quot;Ægir, also named Gymir, had made ale for the Æsir, when he had received the great kettle of which was told&quot; (see &quot;Hymiskviða&quot;). Thor did not attend, but his wife Sif came in his stead as did Bragi and his wife Iðunn. Tyr, by this time one-handed as a consequence of his sacrifice of his hand in the shackling of Loki&#x27;s son, the wolf Fenrisulfr, attended, as did Niord and his wife Skaði, Freyr and Freyja, as well as Vidar, the son of Odin. Many other Vanir, Æsir, and also elves were there.

The servants of Ægir, Fimafeng and Eldir, did a thorough job of welcoming the guests; Loki was jealous of the praise being heaped upon them and slew Fimafeng. The gods were angry with Loki and drove him out of the hall, before returning to their carousing. On returning Loki encountered Eldir.

He threatened him and bade him reveal what the gods were talking about in their cups. Eldir&#x27;s response was that they were discussing their might at arms, and that Loki was not welcomed.

Loki then enters the hall of Ægir after trading insults and threats with Eldir. A hush falls. Loki calls upon the rules of hospitality, demanding a seat and ale. Bragi then responds that he is unwelcome. Loki demands fulfillment of an ancient oath sworn with Odin that they should drink together. Odin asked his son Vidar to make a space for Loki.

Vidar rises and pours a drink for Loki. Before Loki drains his draught, he utters a toast to the gods but pointedly excludes Bragi from it. Bragi offers Loki a horse, a ring and a sword to placate him; Loki, however, is spoiling for a fight, and insults Bragi by questioning his courage. Bragi&#x27;s response is that it would be contrary to the rules of correct behaviour to fight within his hosts&#x27; hall, but were they back in Asgard then things would be different. Iðunn, Bragi&#x27;s wife, holds him back. Loki then insults Iðunn, calling her sexually loose. Gefjon is the next to speak and then Loki turns his spite on her. Odin then attempts to take a grip, as do (in turn), Freyja, Njord, Tyr, Freyr and Byggvir. The exchanges between Odin and Loki are particularly vitriolic.

Eventually Thor turns up at the party, and he is not to be placated, nor withheld. Alternating with Loki&#x27;s insults to him, he says four times that he will use his hammer to knock Loki&#x27;s head off if he continues. Loki replies that for Thor alone he will leave the hall, because his threats are the only ones he fears. He then leaves.

Finally there is a short piece of prose summarizing the tale of Loki&#x27;s binding, which is told in fuller form in the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; section of Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. Loki is chased by the gods, and caught after an unsuccessful attempt at disguising himself as a salmon. The entrails of his son Nari are used to bind him to three rocks above which Skaði places a serpent to drip venom on him. Loki&#x27;s wife Sigyn remains by his side with a bowl to catch the venom; however, whenever she leaves to empty the bowl, venom falls on Loki, causing him to writhe in agony; this writhing was said to be the cause of earthquakes. The text says that Loki&#x27;s other son, Narfi, was turned into a wolf, but does not make clear that he tears his brother apart; also in the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; version it is a son of Loki named Váli whom the Æsir transform into a wolf and who kills Narfi. Some editors have therefore chosen to read the names &quot;Nari&quot; and &quot;Narvi&quot; as a mistake in the manuscript, and transcribe &quot;Nari&quot; as &quot;Váli&quot;. &quot;Nari&quot; and &quot;Narfi&quot; are otherwise considered to be variations of the same name.

==Excerpts==
Thorpe&#x27;s Translation.

*Loki:
:&quot;Hail, Æsir!
:Hail, Asyniur!
:And ye, all-holy gods!
:all, save that one man,
:who sits within there,
:Bragi, on yonder bench.&quot;

*Bragi:
:&quot;I know that were I without,
:as I am now within,
:the hall of Ægir,
:I thy head would
:bear in my hand,
:and so for lying punish thee.&quot;

*Loki:
:&quot;Valiant on thy seat art thou, Bragi!
:but so thou shouldst not be,
:Bragi, the bench&#x27;s pride!
:Go and fight,
:if thou art angry;
:a brave man sits not considering.&quot;

Idunn stepped in to protect her husband.

*Idunn:
:&quot;I pray thee, Bragi!
:let avail the bond of children,
:and of all adopted sons,
:and to Loki speak not
:in reproachful words,
:in Ægir&#x27;s hall.&quot;

*Loki:
:&quot;Be silent, Idunn!
:of all women I declare thee
:most fond of men,
:since thou thy arms,
:carefully washed, didst twine
:round thy brother&#x27;s murderer.&quot;

*Idunn:
:&quot;Loki I address not
:with opprobrious words,
:in Ægir&#x27;s hall.
:Bragi I soothe,
:by beer excited.
:I desire not that angry ye fight.&quot;

*Gefjun:
:&quot;Why will ye, Æsir twain,
:here within,
:strive with reproachful words?
:Lopt perceives not
:that he is deluded,
:and is urged on by fate.&quot;

*Loki:
:&quot;Be silent, Gefjun!
:I will now just mention,
:how that fair youth
:thy mind corrupted,
:who thee a necklace gave,
:and around whom thou thy limbs didst twine?&quot;

Odin interfered, but Loki called him &quot;unmanly&quot; as well.

*Odin:
:&quot;Knowest thou that I gave
:to those I ought not –
:victory to cowards?
:Thou was eight winters
:on the earth below,
:milked cow as a woman,
:and didst there bear children.
:Now that, methinks, betokens a base nature.&quot;

*Loki:
:&quot;But, it is said, thou wentest
:with tottering steps in Samsö,
:and knocked at houses as a Vala. 
:In likeness of a fortune teller,
:thou wentest among people;
:Now that, methinks, betokens a base nature.&quot;

Frigg tried to defend her husband.

*Frigg:
:&quot;Your doings
:ye should never
:publish among men,
:what ye, Æsir twain,
:did in days of yore.
:Ever forgotten be men&#x27;s former deeds!&quot;

*Loki:
:&quot;Be thou silent, Frigg!
:Thou art Fjorgynn&#x27;s daughter,
:and ever hast been lustful,
:since Ve and Vili, it is said,
:thou, Vidrir&#x27;s wife, didst 
:both to thy bosom take.&quot;

*Freyja:
:&quot;Mad art thou, Loki!
:in recounting
:thy foul misdeeds.
:Frigg, I believe,
:knows all that happens,
:although she says it not.&quot;

*Loki:
:&quot;Be thou silent, Freyja!
:I know thee full well;
:thou art not free from vices:
:of the Æsir and the Alfar,
:that are herein,
:each has been thy paramour.&quot;

*Freyja:
:&quot;False is thy tongue.
:Henceforth it will, I think,
:prate no good to thee.
:Wroth with thee are the Æsir,
:and the Asyniur.
:Sad shalt thou home depart.&quot;

*Loki:
:&quot;Be silent, Freyja!
:Thou art a sorceress,
:and with much evil blended;
:since against thy brother thou
:the gentle powers excited.
:And then, Freyja! what didst thou do?&quot;

*Njörðr:
:&quot;It is no great wonder,
:if silk-clad dames
:get themselves husbands, lovers;
:but &#x27;tis a wonder that a wretched man,
:that has borne children, 
:should herein enter.&quot;

*Loki:
:&quot;Cease now, Njörðr!
:in bounds contain thyself;
:I will no longer keep it secret:
:it was with thy sister
:thou hadst such a son 
:hardly worse than thyself.&quot;

*Týr:
:&quot;Freyr is best
:of all the exalted gods
:in the Æsir&#x27;s courts:
:no maid he makes to weep,
:no wife of man,
:and from bonds looses all.&quot;

Not only mocking Týr&#x27;s wound (his arm was bitten by Fenrir), Loki also called him a cuckold.

*Loki:
:&quot;Be silent, Týr;
:to thy wife it happened
:to have a son by me.
:Nor rag nor penny ever
:hadst thou, poor wretch!
:for this injury.&quot;

*Freyr:
:&quot;I the wolf see lying 
:at the river&#x27;s mouth,
:until the powers are swept away.
:So shalt thou be bound,
:if thou art not silent,
:thou framer of evil.&quot;

*Loki:
:&quot;With gold thou boughtest
:Gýmir&#x27;s daughter, 
:and so gavest away thy sword:
:but when Muspell&#x27;s sons 
:through the dark forest ride,
:thou, unhappy, wilt not
:have wherewith to fight.&quot;

*Heimdallr:
:&quot;Loki, thou art drunk,
:and hast lost thy wits.
:Why dost thou not leave off, Loki?
:But drunkenness
:so rules every man,
:that he knows not of his garrulity.&quot;

*Loki:
:&quot;Be silent, Heimdallr!
:For thee in early days
:was that hateful life decreed:
:with a wet back
:thou must ever be,
:and keep watch as guardian of the gods.&quot;

*Skaði:
:&quot;Thou art merry, Loki!
:Not long wilt thou
:frisk with an unbound tail;
:for thee, on a rock&#x27;s point,
:with the entrails of thy ice-cold son,
:the gods will bind.&quot;

*Loki:
:&quot;Milder was thou of speech
:to Laufey&#x27;s son, 
:when to thy bed thou didst invite me.
:Such matters must be mentioned,
:if we accurately must
:recount our vices.&quot;

Sif went to pour for Loki.

*Sif:
:&quot;Hail to thee, Loki!
:and this cool cup receive,
:full of old mead:
:at least me alone,
:among the blameless Æsir race,
:leave stainless.&quot;

*Loki:
:&quot;So alone shouldst thou be,
:hadst thou strict and prudent been
:towards thy mate;
:but one I know,
:and, I think, know him well,
:a favoured rival of Hlorridi,
:and that is the wily Loki.&quot;

After this, Thor came in and drove Loki away.

*Thor:
:&quot;Silence, thou impure being!
:My mighty hammer, Mjöllnir,
:shall stop thy prating.
:I will thy head
:from thy neck strike;
:then will thy life be ended.&quot;

<text>The VIC-20 (known as the VC-20 in Germany and the VIC-1001 in Japan) is an 8-bit home computer that was sold by Commodore Business Machines. The VIC-20 was announced in 1980, roughly three years after Commodore&#x27;s first personal computer, the PET. The VIC-20 was the first computer of any description to sell one million units, eventually reaching 2.5 million. It was described as &quot;one of the first anti-spectatorial, non-esoteric computers by design...no longer relegated to hobbyist/enthusiasts or those with money, the computer Commodore developed was the computer of the future.&quot;

== History ==
As the Apple II gained momentum with the advent of VisiCalc in 1979, Jack Tramiel wanted a product that would compete in the same segment, to be presented at the January 1980 CES. For this reason Chuck Peddle and Bill Seiler started to design a computer named &quot;TOI&quot; (The Other Intellect). The TOI computer failed to materialize, mostly because it required an 80-column character display which in turn required the MOS Technology 6564 chip. However, the chip could not be used in the TOI since it required very expensive static RAM to operate fast enough.

As the new decade began, the price of computer hardware was dropping and Tramiel saw an emerging market for low-price computers, that could be sold at retail stores to relative novices rather than professionals or people with an electronics or programming background. Radio Shack had been achieving considerable success with the TRS-80 Model I, a relatively low-cost machine that was widely sold to novices and in 1980 released the Color Computer, which was aimed at the home and educational markets, used ROM cartridges for software, and connected to a TV set.

=== Development ===
In the meantime, new engineer Robert Yannes at MOS Technology (then a part of Commodore) designed a computer in his home dubbed the &quot;MicroPET&quot; and finished a prototype with help from Al Charpentier and Charles Winterble. With the TOI unfinished, when Jack Tramiel was shown the MicroPET prototype, he immediately said he wanted it to be finished and ordered it to be mass-produced following a limited demonstration at the CES.

The prototype produced by Yannes had few of the features required for a real computer, so Robert Russell at Commodore headquarters had to coordinate and finish large parts of the design under the codename &quot;Vixen&quot;. The parts contributed by Russell included a port of the operating system (kernel and BASIC interpreter) taken from John Feagans&#x27; design for the Commodore PET, a character set with the characteristic PETSCII, an Atari CX40 joystick-compatible interface, and a ROM cartridge port. The serial IEEE-488-derivative CBM-488 interface was designed by Glenn Stark. It served several purposes, including costing substantially less than the IEEE-488 interface on the PET, using smaller cables and connectors that allowed for a more compact case design, and also complying with newly imposed FCC regulations on RFI emissions by home electronics (the PET was certified as Class B office equipment which had less stringent RFI requirements). Some features, like the memory add-in board, were designed by Bill Seiler.

Altogether, the VIC 20 development team consisted of five people led by Michael Tomczyk, the product manager who recruited the group and dubbed them the VIC Commandos. Commodore founder Jack Tramiel initially gave Tomczyk the title VIC Czar and later appointed him product manager. Tomczyk insisted on several features including full-size typewriter keys, programmable function keys, and a built-in RS-232 interface. Michael later contracted and co-designed a $100 modem, the VICModem, which became the first modem to sell 1 million units. According to one of the development team, Neil Harris, &quot;[W]e couldn&#x27;t get any cooperation from the rest of the company who thought we were jokers because we were working late, about an hour after everyone else had left the building. We&#x27;d swipe whatever equipment we needed to get our jobs done. There was no other way to get the work done! [...] they&#x27;d discover it was missing and they would just order more stuff from the warehouse, so everybody had what they needed to do their work.&quot;

At the time, Commodore had a glut of SRAM chips, so Tramiel decided these should be used in the new computer. The result was arguably closer to the &quot;PET&quot; or &quot;TOI&quot; computers than to Yannes&#x27; prototype, albeit with a 22-column VIC chip instead of the custom chips designed for the more ambitious computers. As the amount of memory on the VIC-20&#x27;s system board was very small even for 1981 standards, the design team could get away with using more expensive SRAM due to its lower power consumption, heat output, and less supporting circuitry. The original Revision A system board found in all silver-label VIC-20s used 2114 SRAMs and due to their tiny size (only 512 bytes per chip), ten of them were required to reach 5 KB of system RAM. The Revision B system board, found in rainbow logo VIC-20s (see below) switched to larger 2048-byte SRAMs which reduced the memory count to five chips: 2× 2048-byte chips + 3× 2114 (the 1024 × 4 bits) chips.

In April 1980, at a meeting of general managers outside London, Jack Tramiel declared he wanted a low-cost color computer. When most of the GMs argued against it, preferring Peddle&#x27;s more sophisticated design, he said: &quot;The Japanese are coming, so we must become the Japanese!&quot; (in reference to the threats of low-cost systems from Japan). This was in keeping with Tramiel&#x27;s philosophy which was to make &quot;computers for the masses, not the classes&quot;. The concept was supported at the meeting by Tomczyk, newly hired marketing strategist and assistant to the president; Tony Tokai, General Manager of Commodore Japan, and Kit Spencer, the UK&#x27;s top marketing executive. Peddle disagreed with the decision and left the company with other engineers, so an engineering team in Commodore Japan led by Yash Terakura helped finish the design. The VIC-20 was marketed in Japan as VIC-1001 before VIC-20 was introduced to the US.

When they returned to California from that meeting, Tomczyk wrote a 30-page memo detailing recommendations for the new computer and presented it to Tramiel. Recommendations included programmable function keys (inspired by competing Japanese computers), full-size typewriter-style keys, and built-in RS-232. Tomczyk insisted on &quot;user-friendliness&quot; as the prime directive for the new computer, to engineer Terakura, and proposed a retail price of . He recruited a marketing team and a small group of computer enthusiasts and worked closely with colleagues in the UK and Japan to create colorful packaging, user manuals, and the first wave of games and home applications.

Scott Adams was contracted to provide a series of text adventure games. With help from a Commodore engineer who came to Longwood, Florida, to assist in the effort, five of Adams&#x27;s Adventure International game series were ported to the VIC. They got around the limited memory of VIC-20 by having the games reside in a ROM cartridge instead of being loaded into main memory via cassette as they were on the TRS-80 and other machines. The first production run of the five cartridges generated over $1,500,000 in sales for Commodore.

=== Evolution ===
The VIC-20 went through several variations in its three-and-a-half years of production. First-year models (1980) had a PET-style keyboard with a blocky typeface while most VIC-20s made during 1981 had a slightly different keyboard also shared with early C64s. The rainbow logo VIC-20 was introduced in early 1983 and has the newer C64 keyboard with gray function keys and the Revision B motherboard. It has a similar power supply to the C64 PSU, although the amperage is slightly lower. A C64 &quot;black brick&quot; PSU is compatible with Revision B VIC-20s; however, the VIC&#x27;s PSU is not recommended on a C64 if any external devices, such as cartridges or user port accessories, are installed, as it will overdraw the available power. Older Revision A VIC-20s cannot use a C64 PSU or vice versa as their power requirement is too high.

=== Decline ===

The VIC-20 was a bestseller, becoming the first computer to sell over a million. In total, 2.5 million computers were sold. In summer 1982, Commodore unveiled the a more advanced machine with of RAM and considerably improved sound and graphics. Initial sales of the C64 were slow but took off in mid-1983. The VIC-20 was widely available for under $90 by that time. Commodore discontinued the VIC-20 in January 1985.

Perhaps the last new commercially available VIC-20 peripheral was the VIC-Talker, a speech synthesizer. &quot;Ahoy!&quot; wrote in January 1986, &quot;Believe it or not, a new VIC accessory... We were as surprised as you.&quot;

== Design ==

The VIC-20 was intended to be more economical than the PET computer. It was equipped with 5 KB of static RAM and used the same MOS 6502 CPU as the PET. The VIC-20&#x27;s video chip, the MOS Technology VIC, was a general-purpose color video chip designed by Al Charpentier in 1977 and intended for use in inexpensive display terminals and game consoles, but Commodore could not find a market for the chip.

While newer PETs had the upgraded BASIC 4.0, with disk commands and improved garbage collection, the VIC-20 reverted to the 8 KB BASIC 2.0 used on earlier PETs as part of another of the design team&#x27;s goals: 20 KB system ROMs. There are no dedicated sound or graphics features.

The VIC-20 has a composite output, which provides a sharper, cleaner picture if a dedicated monitor is used. The TRS-80 Color Computer and Atari 400 have only RF video output. An external RF modulator was necessary to use the computer with a TV set.

The &quot;20&quot; in the computer&#x27;s name was widely assumed to refer to the text width of the screen (although in fact, the VIC-20 has 22-column text, not 20) or that it referred to the combined size of the system ROMs (8 KB BASIC+8 KB KERNAL+4 KB character ROM). Bob Yannes claimed that &quot;20&quot; meant nothing in particular and said &quot;We simply picked &#x27;20&#x27; because it seemed like a friendly number and the computer&#x27;s marketing slogan was &#x27;The Friendly Computer&#x27;. I felt it balanced things out a bit since &#x27;Vic&#x27; sounded like the name of a truck driver.&quot;

=== Graphics ===
The graphics capabilities of the VIC chip (6560/6561) are limited but flexible. At startup, the screen shows 176×184 pixels, with a fixed-color border to the edges of the screen. Since a PAL or NTSC screen has a 4:3 width-to-height ratio, each VIC pixel is much wider than it is high. The screen normally shows 22 columns and 23 rows of 8-by-8-pixel characters; it is possible to increase these dimensions up to 27 columns, but the characters would soon run out the sides of the monitor at about 25 columns. Just as on the PET, two different 256-character sets are included, the uppercase/graphics character set and the upper/lowercase set, and reverse video versions of both. Normally, the VIC-20 operates in a high-resolution mode whereby each character is 8×8 pixels in size and uses one color. A lower-resolution multicolor mode can also be used with 4×8 characters and three colors each, but it is not used as often due to its extreme blockiness.

The VIC chip does not support a true bitmap mode, but programmers can define their own custom character sets. It is possible to get a fully addressable screen, although slightly smaller than normal, by filling the screen with a sequence of different double-height characters, then turning on the pixels selectively inside the RAM-based character definitions. The Super Expander cartridge adds BASIC commands supporting such a graphics mode using a resolution of 160×160 pixels. It is also possible to fill a larger area of the screen with addressable graphics using a more dynamic allocation scheme if the contents are sparse or repetitive enough. This is used by the port of &quot;Omega Race&quot;.

The VIC chip has readable scan-line counters but cannot generate interrupts based on the scan position. The two VIA timer chips can serve this purpose through an elaborate programming technique, allowing graphics to be mixed with text above or below it, two different backgrounds and border colors, or more than 200 characters for the pseudo-high-resolution mode.

The VIC chip can process a light pen signal via the joystick port, but few appeared on the market.

The VIC chip outputs Luma+Sync and Chroma video signals, which are combined to create the VIC-20&#x27;s composite video output. Commodore did not include an RF modulator inside the computer&#x27;s case because of FCC regulations. It can either be attached to a dedicated monitor or a TV set using the external modulator included with the computer.

=== Sound ===

The VIC chip has three pulse wave generators and a white noise generator with overall volume control and mono output. Each pulse wave generator has a range of three octaves located on the scale about an octave apart, giving a total range of about five octaves.

=== Memory ===

The VIC-20 shipped with RAM, but of this is used for the video display and dynamic aspects of the ROM-resident Commodore BASIC and KERNAL (a low-level operating system). Only 3,583 bytes of BASIC program memory for code and variables are actually available on an unexpanded machine.

Unlike the PET, the VIC-20 does not include a machine language monitor, but Commodore offered them on disk, tape, or cartridge, with several different executables to load into various memory locations. The monitor programs were the same as the PET monitor but added a mini-assembler instead of requiring the user to enter hexadecimal opcodes.

The VIC-20&#x27;s RAM is expandable through the cartridge port via a RAM cartridge. RAM cartridges were available from Commodore in several sizes: (with or without an included &quot;Super Expander&quot; BASIC extension ROM), , and . The internal memory map is reorganized if you plug in and cartridges, leading to a situation where some programs only work if the right amount of memory is present (the most significant divide being between a machine with no or extra memory on one hand, and a machine with more extra memory on the other).

Most expansion cartridges featured hardware DIP switches, allowing the RAM to be enabled in user-selectable memory blocks. Since the VIC-20 was designed to use SRAM rather than DRAM, the system board has no provisions for DRAM refresh. RAM expansion cartridges ultimately allowed adding up to to the BASIC user memory; together with the built-in user memory, this gave a maximum of for BASIC programs and variables. Memory not visible to BASIC could still be used by machine code programs.

=== Peripherals and expansion ===
The VIC-20 has card edge connectors for program/expansion cartridges and a PET-standard Datassette tape drive. The VIC-20 did not originally have a disk drive; the VIC-1540 disk drive was released in 1981.

There is one Atari joystick port, compatible with the digital joysticks and paddles used with Atari VCS and Atari 8-bit computers; a serial CBM-488 bus (a serial version of the PET&#x27;s IEEE-488 bus) for daisy chaining disk drives and printers; a TTL-level &quot;user port&quot; with both RS-232 and Centronics signals (most frequently used as RS-232, for connecting a modem).

The VIC has a ROM cartridge port for games and other software as well as for adding memory to the machine. Port expander boxes from Commodore and other vendors allow more than one cartridge to be attached at a time. Cartridge size ranges from in size, although the latter was uncommon due to its cost.

The VIC-20 can be hooked into external electronic circuitry via the joystick port, the &quot;user port,&quot; or the memory expansion cartridge port, which exposes various analog to digital, memory bus, and other internal I/O circuits to the experimenter. PEEK and POKE commands from BASIC can be used to perform data acquisition from temperature sensors, control robotic stepper motors, etc.
In 1981, Tomczyk contracted with an outside engineering group to develop a direct-connect modem-on-a-cartridge (the VICModem), which at US$99 became the first modem priced under US$100. The VICModem was also the first modem to sell over 1 million units. VICModem was packaged with US$197.50 worth of free telecomputing services from The Source, CompuServe, and Dow Jones. Tomczyk also created a SIG called the Commodore Information Network to enable users to exchange information and take some of the pressure off of Customer Support inquiries, which were straining Commodore&#x27;s lean organization. In 1982, this network accounted for the largest traffic on CompuServe.

Commodore&#x27;s VIC-1010 Expansion allows the user to connect multiple devices to the VIC-20&#x27;s cartridge port. It has its own power supply and six slots that can be used to connect memory extensions, game cartridges or other peripherals.
== Applications ==
The VIC-20&#x27;s BASIC is compatible with the PET&#x27;s, and the Datasette format is the same. Before the computer&#x27;s release, a Commodore executive promised it would have &quot;enough additional documentation to enable an experienced programmer/hobbyist to get inside and let his imagination work&quot;. &quot;Compute!&quot; favorably contrasted the company&#x27;s encouragement of &quot;cottage industry software developers&quot; to Texas Instruments discouraging third-party software. Because of its small memory and low-resolution display compared to some other computers of the time, the VIC-20 was primarily used for educational software and games. However, productivity applications such as home finance programs, spreadsheets, and communication terminal programs were also made for the machine.

The VIC had a sizable library of public domain and freeware software. This software was distributed via online services such as CompuServe, BBSs, as well as offline by mail order and by user groups. Several computer magazines sold on newsstands, such as &quot;Compute!&quot;, &quot;Family Computing&quot;, &quot;RUN&quot;, &quot;Ahoy!&quot;, and the CBM-produced &quot;Commodore Power/Play&quot;, offered programming tips and type-in programs for the VIC-20.

An estimated 300 commercial titles were available on cartridge and another 500+ were available on tape. A handful of disk applications were released.

The VIC&#x27;s low cost led to it being used by the Fort Pierce, Florida, Utilities Authority to measure the input and output of two of their generators and display the results on monitors throughout the plant. The utility was able to purchase multiple VIC and C64 systems for the cost of one IBM PC compatible.

== Marketing and retail ==

While the PET was sold through authorized dealers the VIC-20 primarily sold at retail, especially discount and toy stores, where it could compete directly with game consoles. It was the first computer to be sold in K-Mart. Commodore took out advertisements featuring actor William Shatner (of &quot;Star Trek&quot; fame) as its spokesman, asking: &quot;Why buy just a video game?&quot; and describing it as &quot;The Wonder Computer of the 1980s&quot;. Television personality Henry Morgan (best known as a panelist on the TV game show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;) became the commentator in a series of Commodore product ads.

The VIC-20 was called &quot;VC-20&quot; in Germany and was marketed as though it were an abbreviation of &quot;VolksComputer&quot; (&quot;people&#x27;s computer,&quot; similar to Volkswagen and Volksempfänger).

== Reception ==

Describing it as &quot;an astounding machine for the price&quot;, &quot;Compute!&quot; in 1981 expected the VIC-20 would be popular in classrooms and homes with small children, with &quot;excellent graphic and sound capabilities&quot;. While predicting the 22-column screen was &quot;too small to support any but the most rudimentary business applications&quot; the magazine observed that &quot;at a price of , that is hardly the point&quot;, stating that &quot;the VIC will provide very stiff competition to the TRS-80 Color Computer&quot; and &quot;is a much more valuable computer literacy tool than&quot; other products like the TRS-80 Pocket Computer. &quot;Compute!&quot; concluded &quot;VIC will create its own market, and it will be a big one&quot;. While also noting the small screen size and RAM, &quot;BYTE&quot; stated that the VIC 20 was &quot;unexcelled as low-cost, consumer-oriented computer. Even with some of its limitations...it makes an impressive showing against...the Apple II, the Radio Shack TRS-80, and the Atari 800&quot;. The magazine praised the price (&quot;Looking at a picture...might cause you to think would be a fair price...But it does not cost —the VIC 20 retails for &quot;), keyboard (&quot;the equal of any personal-computer keyboard in both appearance and performance. This is a remarkable achievement, almost unbelievable considering the price of the entire unit&quot;), graphics, documentation, and ease of software development with the KERNAL.

<text>Human population planning is the practice of managing the growth rate of a human population. The practice, traditionally referred to as population control, had historically been implemented mainly with the goal of increasing population growth, though from the 1950s to the 1980s, concerns about overpopulation and its effects on poverty, the environment and political stability led to efforts to reduce population growth rates in many countries. More recently, however, several countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, Iran, Italy, Spain, Finland, Hungary and Estonia have begun efforts to boost birth rates once again, generally as a response to looming demographic crises.

While population planning can involve measures that improve people&#x27;s lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, a few programs, such as the Chinese government&#x27;s &quot;one-child policy and two-child policy&quot;, have employed coercive measures.

==Types==

Three types of population planning policies pursued by governments can be identified:

# Increasing or decreasing the overall population growth rate.
# Increasing or decreasing the relative population growth of a subgroup of people, such as those of high or low intelligence or those with special abilities or disabilities. Policies that aim to boost relative growth rates are known as positive eugenics; those that aim to reduce relative growth rates are known as negative eugenics.
# Attempts to ensure that all population groups of a certain type (e.g. all social classes within a society) have the same average rate of population growth.

==History==

===Ancient times through Middle Ages===
A number of ancient writers have reflected on the issue of population. At about 300 BC, the Indian political philosopher Chanakya (c. 350-283 BC) considered population a source of political, economic, and military strength. Though a given region can house too many or too few people, he considered the latter possibility to be the greater evil. Chanakya favored the remarriage of widows (which at the time was forbidden in India), opposed taxes encouraging emigration, and believed in restricting asceticism to the aged.

In ancient Greece, Plato (427-347 BC) and Aristotle (384-322 BC) discussed the best population size for Greek city-states such as Sparta, and concluded that cities should be small enough for efficient administration and direct citizen participation in public affairs, but at the same time needed to be large enough to defend themselves against hostile neighbors. In order to maintain a desired population size, the philosophers advised that procreation, and if necessary, immigration, should be encouraged if the population size was too small. Emigration to colonies would be encouraged should the population become too large. Aristotle concluded that a large increase in population would bring, &quot;certain poverty on the citizenry and poverty is the cause of sedition and evil.&quot; To halt rapid population increase, Aristotle advocated the use of abortion and the exposure of newborns (that is, infanticide).

Confucius (551-478 BC) and other Chinese writers cautioned that, &quot;excessive growth may reduce output per worker, repress levels of living for the masses and engender strife.&quot; Some Chinese writers may also have observed that &quot;mortality increases when food supply is insufficient; that premature marriage makes for high infantile mortality rates, that war checks population growth.&quot; It is particularly noteworthy that Han Fei (281-233 BC), long before Malthus, had already noted the conflict between a population growing at the exponential rate and a food supply growing at the arithmetic rate. Not only did he conclude that overpopulation was the root cause of the intensification of political and social conflict, but he also reduced traditional morality to an evolutionary product of material surplus rather than having any objective value. Nevertheless, during the Han Dynasty, the emperors enacted a large number of laws to encourage early marriage and childbirth.

Ancient Rome, especially in the time of Augustus (63 BC-AD 14), needed manpower to acquire and administer the vast Roman Empire. A series of laws were instituted to encourage early marriage and frequent childbirth. Lex Julia (18 BC) and the Lex Papia Poppaea (AD 9) are two well-known examples of such laws, which among others, provided tax breaks and preferential treatment when applying for public office for those who complied with the laws. Severe limitations were imposed on those who did not. For example, the surviving spouse of a childless couple could only inherit one-tenth of the deceased fortune, while the rest was taken by the state. These laws encountered resistance from the population which led to the disregard of their provisions and to their eventual abolition.

Tertullian, an early Christian author (ca. AD 160-220), was one of the first to describe famine and war as factors that can prevent overpopulation. He wrote: &quot;The strongest witness is the vast population of the earth to which we are a burden and she scarcely can provide for our needs; as our demands grow greater, our complaints against Nature&#x27;s inadequacy are heard by all. The scourges of pestilence, famine, wars, and earthquakes have come to be regarded as a blessing to overcrowded nations since they serve to prune away the luxuriant growth of the human race.&quot;

Ibn Khaldun, a North African polymath (1332–1406), considered population changes to be connected to economic development, linking high birth rates and low death rates to times of economic upswing, and low birth rates and high death rates to economic downswing. Khaldoun concluded that high population density rather than high absolute population numbers were desirable to achieve more efficient division of labour and cheap administration.

During the Middle Ages in Christian Europe, population issues were rarely discussed in isolation. Attitudes were generally pro-natalist in line with the Biblical command, &quot;Be ye fruitful and multiply.&quot;

When Russian explorer Otto von Kotzebue visited the Marshall Islands in Micronesia in 1817, he noted that Marshallese families practiced infanticide after the birth of a third child as a form of population planning due to frequent famines.

===16th and 17th centuries===
European cities grew more rapidly than before, and throughout the 16th century and early 17th century discussions on the advantages and disadvantages of population growth were frequent. Niccolò Machiavelli, an Italian Renaissance political philosopher, wrote, &quot;When every province of the world so teems with inhabitants that they can neither subsist where they are nor remove themselves elsewhere... the world will purge itself in one or another of these three ways,&quot; listing floods, plague and famine. Martin Luther concluded, &quot;God makes children. He is also going to feed them.&quot;

Jean Bodin, a French jurist and political philosopher (1530–1596), argued that larger populations meant more production and more exports, increasing the wealth of a country. Giovanni Botero, an Italian priest and diplomat (1540–1617), emphasized that, &quot;the greatness of a city rests on the multitude of its inhabitants and their power,&quot; but pointed out that a population cannot increase beyond its food supply. If this limit was approached, late marriage, emigration, and the war would serve to restore the balance.

Richard Hakluyt, an English writer (1527–1616), observed that, &quot;Through our longe peace and seldom sickness... we are grown more populous than ever heretofore;... many thousands of idle persons are within this realme, which, having no way to be sett on work, be either mutinous and seek alteration in the state, or at least very burdensome to the commonwealth.&quot; Hakluyt believed that this led to crime and full jails and in &quot;A Discourse on Western Planting&quot; (1584), Hakluyt advocated for the emigration of the surplus population. With the onset of the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–48), characterized by widespread devastation and deaths brought on by hunger and disease in Europe, concerns about depopulation returned.

==Population planning movement==
In the 20th century, population planning proponents have drawn from the insights of Thomas Malthus, a British clergyman and economist who published &quot;An Essay on the Principle of Population&quot; in 1798. Malthus argued that, &quot;Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence only increases in an arithmetical ratio.&quot; He also outlined the idea of &quot;positive checks&quot; and &quot;preventative checks.&quot; &quot;Positive checks&quot;, such as diseases, wars, disasters, famines, and genocides are factors which Malthus believed could increase the death rate.
&quot;Preventative checks&quot; were factors which Malthus believed could affect the birth rate such as moral restraint, abstinence and birth control. He predicted that &quot;positive checks&quot; on exponential population growth would ultimately save humanity from itself and he also believed that human misery was an &quot;absolute necessary consequence&quot;. Malthus went on to explain why he believed that this misery affected the poor in a disproportionate manner.


Finally, Malthus advocated for the education of the lower class about the use of &quot;moral restraint&quot; or voluntary abstinence, which he believed would slow the growth rate.

Paul R. Ehrlich, a US biologist and environmentalist, published &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; in 1968, advocating stringent population planning policies. His central argument on population is as follows:


In his concluding chapter, Ehrlich offered a partial solution to the &quot;population problem&quot;,
&quot;[We need] compulsory birth regulation... [through] the addition of temporary sterilants to water supplies or staple food. Doses of the antidote would be carefully rationed by the government to produce the desired family size&quot;.

Ehrlich&#x27;s views came to be accepted by many population planning advocates in the United States and Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. Since Ehrlich introduced his idea of the &quot;population bomb&quot;, overpopulation has been blamed for a variety of issues, including increasing poverty, high unemployment rates, environmental degradation, famine and genocide. In a 2004 interview, Ehrlich reviewed the predictions in his book and found that while the specific dates within his predictions may have been wrong, his predictions about climate change and disease were valid. Ehrlich continued to advocate for population planning and co-authored the book &quot;The Population Explosion&quot;, released in 1990 with his wife Anne Ehrlich.

However, it is controversial as to whether human population stabilization will avert environmental risks. A 2014 study published in the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America&quot; found that given the &quot;inexorable demographic momentum of the global human population&quot;, even mass mortality events and draconian one-child policies implemented on a global scale would still likely result in a population of 5 to 10 billion by 2100. Therefore, while reduced fertility rates are positive for society and the environment, the short term focus should be on mitigating the human impact on the environment through technological and social innovations, along with reducing overconsumption, with population planning being a long-term goal. A letter in response, published in the same journal, argued that a reduction in population by 1 billion people in 2100 could help reduce the risk of catastrophic climate disruption. A 2021 article published in &quot;Sustainability Science&quot; said that sensible population policies could advance social justice (such as by abolishing child marriage, expanding family planning services and reforms that improve education for women and girls) and avoid the abusive and coercive population control schemes of the past while at the same time mitigating the human impact on the climate, biodiversity and ecosystems by slowing fertility rates.

Paige Whaley Eager argues that the shift in perception that occurred in the 1960s must be understood in the context of the demographic changes that took place at the time. It was only in the first decade of the 19th century that the world&#x27;s population reached one billion. The second billion was added in the 1930s, and the next billion in the 1960s. 90 percent of this net increase occurred in developing countries. Eager also argues that, at the time, the United States recognised that these demographic changes could significantly affect global geopolitics. Large increases occurred in China, Mexico and Nigeria, and demographers warned of a &quot;population explosion&quot;, particularly in developing countries from the mid-1950s onwards.

In the 1980s, tension grew between population planning advocates and women&#x27;s health activists who advanced women&#x27;s reproductive rights as part of a human rights-based approach. Growing opposition to the narrow population planning focus led to a significant change in population planning policies in the early 1990s.

==Population planning and economics==
Opinions vary among economists about the effects of population change on a nation&#x27;s economic health. US scientific research in 2009 concluded that the raising of a child cost about $16,000 yearly ($291,570 total for raising the child to its 18th birthday). In the US, the multiplication of this number with the yearly population growth will yield the overall cost of the population growth. Costs for other developed countries are usually of a similar order of magnitude.

Some economists, such as Thomas Sowell and Walter E. Williams, have argued that poverty and famine are caused by bad government and bad economic policies, not by overpopulation.

In his book &quot;The Ultimate Resource&quot;, economist Julian Simon argued that higher population density leads to more specialization and technological innovation, which in turn leads to a higher standard of living. He claimed that human beings are the ultimate resource since we possess &quot;productive and inventive minds that help find creative solutions to man’s problems, thus leaving us better off over the long run&quot;.

Simon also claimed that when considering a list of countries ranked in order by population density, there is no correlation between population density and poverty and starvation. Instead, if a list of countries is considered according to corruption within their respective governments, there is a significant correlation between government corruption, poverty and famine.

==Views on population planning==

===Birth rate reductions===
====Support====

As early as 1798, Thomas Malthus argued in his &quot;Essay on the Principle of Population&quot; for implementation of population planning. Around the year 1900, Sir Francis Galton said in his publication &quot;Hereditary Improvement&quot;: &quot;The unfit could become enemies to the State if they continue to propagate.&quot; In 1968, Paul Ehrlich noted in &quot;The Population Bomb&quot;, &quot;We must cut the cancer of population growth&quot;, and &quot;if this was not done, there would be only one other solution, namely the &#x27;death rate solution&#x27; in which we raise the death rate through war-famine-pestilence, etc.”

In the same year, another prominent modern advocate for mandatory population planning was Garrett Hardin, who proposed in his landmark 1968 essay &quot;Tragedy of the commons&quot;, society must relinquish the &quot;freedom to breed&quot; through &quot;mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon.&quot; Later on, in 1972, he reaffirmed his support in his new essay &quot;Exploring New Ethics for Survival&quot;, by stating, &quot;We are breeding ourselves into oblivion.&quot; Many prominent personalities, such as Bertrand Russell, Margaret Sanger (1939), John D. Rockefeller, Frederick Osborn (1952), Isaac Asimov, Arne Næss and Jacques Cousteau have also advocated for population planning.
Today, a number of influential people advocate population planning such as these:

* David Attenborough
* Christian de Duve, Nobel laureate
* Sara Parkin
* Jonathon Porritt, UK sustainable development commissioner
* William J. Ripple, lead author of the 2017 World Scientists&#x27; Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice
* Crispin Tickell

The head of the UN Millennium Project Jeffrey Sachs is also a strong proponent of decreasing the effects of overpopulation. In 2007, Jeffrey Sachs gave a number of lectures (2007 Reith Lectures) about population planning and overpopulation. In his lectures, called &quot;Bursting at the Seams&quot;, he featured an integrated approach that would deal with a number of problems associated with overpopulation and poverty reduction. For example, when criticized for advocating mosquito nets he argued that child survival was, &quot;by far one of the most powerful ways&quot;, to achieve fertility reduction, as this would assure poor families that the smaller number of children they had would survive.

====Opposition====
Critics of human population planning point out that attempts to curb human population growth have resulted in violations of human rights such as forced sterilization, particularly in China and India. In the latter half of the twentieth century, India&#x27;s population reduction program received substantial funds and powerful incentives from Western countries and international population planning organizations to reduce India&#x27;s growing population. This culminated in &quot;the Emergency,&quot; a period in the mid-1970&#x27;s where millions of people were forcibly sterilized. Violent resistance to forced sterilization led to police brutality and some instances of mass shootings of civilians by police. Critics also argue that supposedly voluntary population planning is often coerced. Some also believe that the environmental problems caused by supposed overpopulation are better explained by other factors, and that the goal of human population reduction does not justify the threat to human rights posed by population planning policies.

Other causes for opposition emerge from the feasibility of substantially impacting human population. According to some researchers, even rapid global adoption of a one-child policy would result in a world population exceeding 8 billion in 2050, and in a scenario involving catastrophic mass death of 2 billion people, world population would exceed 8 billion by 2100.

The Catholic Church has opposed abortion, sterilization, and artificial contraception as a general practice but especially in regard to population planning policies. Pope Benedict XVI has stated, &quot;The extermination of millions of unborn children, in the name of the fight against poverty, actually constitutes the destruction of the poorest of all human beings.&quot; The reformed Theology pastor Dr. Stephen Tong also opposes the planning of human population.

==Pro-natalist policies==

In 1946, Poland introduced a tax on childlessness, discontinued in the 1970s, as part of natalist policies in the Communist government. From 1941 to the 1990s, the Soviet Union had a similar tax to replenish the population losses incurred during the Second World War.

The Socialist Republic of Romania under Nicolae Ceaușescu severely repressed abortion, (the most common birth control method at the time) in 1966, and forced gynecological revisions and penalties for unmarried women and childless couples.
The surge of the birth rate taxed the public services received by the &quot;decreței 770&quot; (&quot;Scions of the Decree 770&quot;) generation. A consequence of Ceaușescu&#x27;s natalist policy is that large numbers of children ended up living in orphanages, because their parents could not cope. The vast majority of children who lived in the communist orphanages were not actually orphans, but were simply children whose parents could not afford to raise them. The Romanian Revolution of 1989 preceded a fall in population growth.

===Balanced birth policies===
Nativity in the Western world dropped during the interwar period. Swedish sociologists Alva and Gunnar Myrdal published &quot;Crisis in the Population Question&quot; in 1934, suggesting an extensive welfare state with universal healthcare and childcare, to increase overall Swedish birth rates, and level the number of children at a reproductive level for all social classes in Sweden. Swedish fertility rose throughout World War II (as Sweden was largely unharmed by the war) and peaked in 1946.

==Modern practice by country==

===Australia===
Australia currently offers fortnightly Family Tax Benefit payments plus a free immunization scheme, and recently proposed to pay all child care costs for women who want to work.

===China===
====One-child era (1979–2015)====

The most significant population planning system in the world was China&#x27;s one-child policy, in which, with various exceptions, having more than one child was discouraged. Unauthorized births were punished by fines, although there were also allegations of illegal forced abortions and forced sterilization. As part of China&#x27;s planned birth policy, (work) unit supervisors monitored the fertility of married women and may decide whose turn it is to have a baby.

The Chinese government introduced the policy in 1978 to alleviate the social and environmental problems of China. According to government officials, the policy has helped prevent 400 million births. The success of the policy has been questioned, and reduction in fertility has also been attributed to the modernization of China. The policy is controversial both within and outside of China because of its manner of implementation and because of concerns about negative economic and social consequences e.g. female infanticide. In Asian cultures, the oldest male child has responsibility of caring for the parents in their old age. Therefore, it is common for Asian families to invest most heavily in the oldest male child, such as providing college, steering them into the most lucrative careers, and so on. To these families, having an oldest male child is paramount, so in a one-child policy, daughters have no economic benefit, so daughters, especially as a first child, are often targeted for abortion or infanticide. China introduced several government reforms to increase retirement payments to coincide with the one-child policy. During that time, couples could request permission to have more than one child.

According to Tibetologist Melvyn Goldstein, natalist feelings run high in China&#x27;s Tibet Autonomous Region, among both ordinary people and government officials. Seeing population control &quot;as a matter of power and ethnic survival&quot; rather than in terms of ecological sustainability, Tibetans successfully argued for an exemption of Tibetan people from the usual family planning policies in China such as the one-child policy.

==== Two-child era (2016–2021) ====

In November 2014, the Chinese government allowed its people to conceive a second child under the supervision of government regulation.

On 29 October 2015, the ruling Chinese Communist Party announced that all one-child policies would be scrapped, allowing all couples to have two children. The change was needed to allow a better balance of male and female children, and to grow the young population to ease the problem of paying for the aging population. The law enacting the two-child policy took effect on 1 January 2016, and replaced the previous one-child policy.

==== Three-child era (2021–) ====

In May 2021, the Chinese government allowed its people to conceive a third child, in a move accompanied by &quot;supportive measures&quot; it regarded &quot;conducive&quot; to improving its &quot;population structure, fulfilling the country&#x27;s strategy of actively coping with an ageing population and maintaining the advantage, endowment of human resources&quot; after declining birth rates recorded in the 2020 Chinese census.

===Hungary===
During the Second Orbán Government, Hungary increased its family benefits spending from one of the lowest rates in the OECD to one of the highest. In 2015, it amounted to nearly 4% of GDP.

===India===

Only those with two or fewer children are eligible for election to a local government.

&quot;Us two, our two&quot; (&quot;Hum do, hamare do&quot; in Hindi) is a slogan meaning &quot;one family, two children&quot; and is intended to reinforce the message of family planning thereby aiding population planning.

Facilities offered by government to its employees are limited to two children. The government offers incentives for families accepted for sterilization. Moreover, India was the first country to take measures for family planning back in 1952.
In 2019, the Population Control Bill, 2019 bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha in July 2019 by Rakesh Sinha. The purpose of the bill is to control the population growth of India.

===Iran===

After the Iran–Iraq War, Iran encouraged married couples to produce as many children as possible to replace population lost to the war.

Iran succeeded in sharply reducing its birth rate from the late 1980s to 2010. Mandatory contraceptive courses are required for both males and females before a marriage license can be obtained, and the government emphasized the benefits of smaller families and the use of contraception. This changed in 2012, when a major policy shift back towards increasing birth rates was announced. In 2014, permanent contraception and advertising of birth control were to be outlawed.

===Israel===
In Israel, Haredi families with many children receive economic support through generous governmental child allowances, government assistance in housing young religious couples, as well as specific funds by their own community institutions. Haredi women have an average of 6.7 children while the average Jewish Israeli woman has 3 children.

===Japan===
Japan has experienced a shrinking population for many years. The government is trying to encourage women to have children or to have more children – many Japanese women do not have children, or even remain single. The population is culturally opposed to immigration.

Some Japanese localities, facing significant population loss, are offering economic incentives. Yamatsuri, a town of 7,000 just north of Tokyo, offers parents $4,600 for the birth of a child and $460 a year for 10 years.

===Myanmar===
In Myanmar, the Population planning Health Care Bill requires some parents to space each child three years apart. The Economist, in 2015, stated that the measure was expected to be used against the persecuted Muslim Rohingyas minority.

===Pakistan===
=== Russia ===
Russian President Vladimir Putin directed Parliament in 2006 to adopt a 10-year program to stop the sharp decline in Russia&#x27;s population, principally by offering financial incentives and subsidies to encourage women to have children.

=== Singapore ===
Singapore has undergone two major phases in its population planning: first to slow and reverse the baby boom in the Post-World War II era; then from the 1980s onwards to encourage couples to have more children as the birth rate had fallen below the replacement-level fertility. In addition, during the interim period, eugenics policies were adopted.

The anti-natalist policies flourished in the 1960s and 1970s: initiatives advocating small families were launched and developed into the &quot;Stop at Two&quot; programme, pushing for two-children families and promoting sterilisation. In 1984, the government announced the &quot;Graduate Mothers&#x27; Scheme&quot;, which favoured children of more well-educated mothers; the policy was however soon abandoned due to the outcry in the general election of the same year.
Eventually, the government became pro-natalist in the late 1980s, marked by its &quot;Have Three or More&quot; plan in 1987. Singapore pays $3,000 for the first child, $9,000 in cash and savings for the second; and up to $18,000 each for the third and fourth.

===Spain===
In 2017, the government of Spain appointed Edelmira Barreira, as &quot;Government Commissioner facing the Demographic Challenge&quot;, in a pro-natalist attempt to reverse a negative population growth rate.

===Turkey===
In May 2012, Turkey&#x27;s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan argued that abortion is murder and announced that legislative preparations to severely limit the practice are underway. Erdogan also argued that abortion and C-section deliveries are plots to stall Turkey&#x27;s economic growth. Prior to this move, Erdogan had repeatedly demanded that each couple have at least three children.

===United States===

Enacted in 1970, Title X of the Public Health Service Act provides access to contraceptive services, supplies and information to those in need. Priority for services is given to people with low incomes. The Title X Family Planning program is administered through the Office of Population Affairs under the Office of Public Health and Science.
It is directed by the Office of Family Planning. In 2007, Congress appropriated roughly $283 million for family planning under Title X, at least 90 percent of which was used for services in family planning clinics. Title X is a vital source of funding for family planning clinics throughout the nation, which provide reproductive health care, including abortion.

The education and services supplied by the Title X-funded clinics support young individuals and low-income families. The goals of developing healthy families are accomplished by helping individuals and couples decide whether to have children and when the appropriate time to do so would be.

Title X has made the prevention of unintended pregnancies possible. It has allowed millions of American women to receive necessary reproductive health care, plan their pregnancies and prevent abortions. Title X is dedicated exclusively to funding family planning and reproductive health care services.

Title X as a percentage of total public funding to family planning client services has steadily declined from 44% of total expenditures in 1980 to 12% in 2006. Medicaid has increased from 20% to 71% in the same time. In 2006, Medicaid contributed $1.3 billion to public family planning.

In the early 1970s, the United States Congress established the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future (Chairman John D. Rockefeller III), which was created to provide recommendations regarding population growth and its social consequences. The Commission submitted its final recommendations in 1972, which included promoting contraceptives and liberalizing abortion regulations, for example.

====Natalism in the United States====
In a 2004 editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, David Brooks expressed the opinion that the relatively high birth rate of the United States in comparison to Europe could be attributed to social groups with &quot;natalist&quot; attitudes. The article is referred to in an analysis of the Quiverfull movement. However, the figures identified for the demographic are extremely low.

Former US Senator Rick Santorum made natalism part of his platform for his 2012 presidential campaign. Many of those categorized in the General Social Survey as &quot;Fundamentalist Protestant&quot; are more or less natalist, and have a higher birth rate than &quot;Moderate&quot; and &quot;Liberal&quot; Protestants. However, Rick Santorum is not a Protestant but a practicing Catholic.

===Uzbekistan===

It is reported that Uzbekistan has been pursuing a policy of forced sterilizations, hysterectomies and IUD insertions since the late 1990s in order to impose population planning.

<text>The South Sandwich Islands () are a chain of uninhabited volcanic islands in the South Atlantic Ocean. They are administered as part of the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The chain lies in the sub-Antarctic region, about southeast of South Georgia and northeast from the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.

The archipelago comprises 11 main islands forming an island arc running north–south, the largest being Montagu at . It is divided into four groups, from north to south: The Traversay, Candlemas and Central Islands (Saunders, Montagu, and Bristol), and Southern Thule. 

The archipelago is prone to violent earthquakes. Over the previous century, nine M 7+ earthquakes have occurred here, the most recent being the M 8.1 in August 2021. None of these earthquakes are known to have caused fatalities due to their remote location.

==History==
The southern eight islands of the Sandwich Islands Group were discovered by James Cook in 1775. The northern three were discovered by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen in 1819.

Departing from South Georgia, Captain Cook sailed to the southeast to discover Clerke Rocks and a group of islands which he named &quot;Sandwich Land&quot; in honour of Lord Sandwich, then First Lord of the Admiralty. The word &quot;South&quot; was later added to distinguish them from the &quot;Sandwich Islands&quot;, now known as Hawai&#x27;i.

The Traversay Islands (Zavodovski, Leskov and Visokoi) were discovered by the Imperial Russian Navy expedition of Bellingshausen and Lazarev in the ships &quot;Vostok&quot; and &quot;Mirny&quot; in 1819.

The United Kingdom formally annexed the South Sandwich Islands through letters patent in 1908, grouping them with other British-held territory in Antarctica as the Falkland Islands Dependencies.

Argentina claimed the South Sandwich Islands in 1938 and challenged British sovereignty in the islands on several occasions. From 25 January 1955 through the summer of 1956 Argentina maintained the summer station Teniente Esquivel at Ferguson Bay on the southeastern coast of Thule Island. From 1976 to 1982, Argentina maintained a naval base named Corbeta Uruguay in the lee (southern east coast) of the same island. Although the British discovered the presence of the Argentine base in 1976, protested, and tried to resolve the issue by diplomatic means, no effort was made to remove them by force until after the Falklands War. The base was eventually removed on 20 June 1982 and the installations were demolished in December of that year.

Since 1995, the South African Weather Bureau has maintained two automatic weather stations on the islands of Zavodovski and Thule.

The territory of &quot;South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands&quot; was formed in 1985; previously, both archipelagos had been governed as part of the Falkland Islands Dependencies.

On 10 February 2008, an earthquake of magnitude 6.5 on the Richter Scale had its epicenter south-southeast of Bristol Island. On 30 June 2008, an earthquake of magnitude 7.0 struck the region. Its epicenter was at east-northeast (73 degrees) of Bristol Island.

==Geography==
The northernmost of the South Sandwich Islands form the Traversay Islands and Candlemas Islands groups, while the southernmost make up Southern Thule. The three largest islandsSaunders, Montagu, and Bristollie between the two. The Islands&#x27; highest point is Mount Belinda () on Montagu Island. The fourth highest peak, Mount Michael () on Saunders Island has a persistent lava lake, known to occur at only eight volcanoes in the world.

The South Sandwich Islands are uninhabited, though an illegal permanently staffed Argentine research station was located on Thule Island from 1976 to 1982 (for details, see above). Automatic weather stations are on Thule Island and Zavodovski. To the northwest of Zavodovski Island is the Protector Shoal, a submarine volcano.

The South Sandwich Islands from north to south are:

A series of six passages separates each of the islands or island groups in the chain. They are, from north to south: Zavodovski Isl., &quot;Traverse passage&quot;, Visokoi Isl., &quot;Brown&#x27;s passage&quot;, Candlemas Isl., &quot;Shackleton&#x27;s passage&quot;, Saunders Isl., &quot;Larsen&#x27;s passage&quot;, Montagu Isl., Biscoe&#x27;s passage, Bristol Isl., Forsters Passage, Southern Thule. Nelson Channel is the passage between Candlemas and Vindication islands.

<text>Environmental determinism (also known as climatic determinism or geographical determinism) is the study of how the physical environment predisposes societies and states towards particular economic or social developmental (or even more generally, cultural) trajectories. Jared Diamond, Jeffrey Herbst, Ian Morris, and other social scientists sparked a revival of the theory during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. This &quot;neo-environmental determinism&quot; school of thought examines how geographic and ecological forces influence state-building, economic development, and institutions. While archaic versions of the geographic interpretation were used to encourage colonialism and eurocentrism, modern figures like Diamond use this approach to reject the racism in these explanations. Diamond argues that European powers were able to colonize, due to unique advantages bestowed by their environment, as opposed to any kind of inherent superiority.

== A history of thought ==

=== Classical and medieval periods ===
Early theories of environmental determinism in Ancient China, Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome suggested that environmental features completely determined the physical and intellectual qualities of whole societies. Guan Zhong (720–645 BC), an early chancellor in China, held that the qualities of major rivers shaped the character of surrounding peoples. Swift and twisting rivers made people &quot;greedy, uncouth, and warlike&quot;. The ancient Greek philosopher Hippocrates wrote a similar account in his treatise &quot;Airs, Waters, Places&quot;.

In this text, Hippocrates explained how the ethnicities of people were connected to their environment. He argued that there existed a connection between the geography surrounding people and their ethnicity. Hippocrates described the effects of different climates, customs, and diets on people and how this affected their behaviors, attitudes, as well as their susceptibility to diseases and illnesses.

For example, he explains the Asian race were less warlike compared to other civilizations due to their climate. He attributes this to the fact that there are “no great shifts in the weather, which is neither hot nor cold but temperate” and how the climate conditions allow Asians to live without shock or mental anxieties. According to Hippocrates, anxieties and shocks promote passion and recklessness in humans, but since Asians lack this, they remain feeble. This connects to the manner in which Asians are ruled, stating they do not “rule themselves nor are autonomous but subjects to a despot, there is no self-interest in appearing warlike.” In the later chapters of his work, he contrasts this attitude to that of Europeans. He claims that laziness can be attributed as an effect of uniform climate and that “Endurance of both the body and soul comes from change. Also cowardice increases softness and laziness, while courage engenders endurance and a work ethic.” Since Europeans experience more fluctuations in their climate, they do not remain accustomed to their climate and are forced to endure constant change. Hippocrates claims that this is reflected in a person&#x27;s character and ties that to the character of Europeans, explaining that “For this reason, those dwelling in Europe are more effective fighters.”

According to Hippocrates, there are also physical manifestations of environmental determinism in people. He presents the connection between the nature of the land and its people, arguing that the physique and nature of a man are formed and influenced by it. He explains one of the ways this connection is exhibited by stating, “Where the land is rich, soft, and well watered, and the waters are near the surface so that they become hot in the summer and cold in the winter, and where the climate is nice, there the men are flabby and jointless, bloated and lazy and mostly cowards.” He notes the nomadic Scythians as examples of a civilization that possesses these traits. In a previous section of his text, he notes how the Scythians are flabby and bloated and that they possess the most bloated bellies of all peoples. He also comments that all males are identical and all females are identical in appearance, males with males and females with females. He attributes this to the climate conditions they live in and the fact that they experience identical summer and winter seasons. The lack of change leads them to wear the same clothes, eat the same fame, breathe the same damp air, and refrain from labor. This continuity and the lack of strong shifts in climate is what Hippocrates identifies as the cause for their appearance. Since the Scythians are not accosted to experiencing sudden changes, they cannot develop the body or soul to endure physical activity.  In comparison, locations “where the land is barren, dry, harsh, and harried by storms in the winter or scorched by the sun in the summers, there one would find strong, lean, well-defined. muscular, and hairy men.” These characteristics would also reflect on their character, as they would possess hard-working, intelligent, and independent natures as well as being more skilled and warlike than others.

Hippocrates also argues that the physical appearance caused by people&#x27;s environments affect the reproduction and fertility of civilizations, which affects future generations. He presents the appearance and bodies of the Scythians as having a negative impact on the fertility of their civilization. Hippocrates argues that due to their bloated stomachs and “extremely soft and cold lower bellies” Scythian men are not eager for intercourse and due to this condition, “highly unlikely to be able to satisfy his lusts.” He further argues that the behavior of the Scythian men and their horseback riding customs also affected their fertility because the “constant bouncing on horseback has rendered Scythian men unfit for sex” and made them infertile. Women, according to Hippocrates are also infertile because of their physical condition and because they are fat and bloated. Hippocrates claims that due to their physique, women have wombs that are too wet and “incapable of absorbing a man&#x27;s seed.” This he explains, affects their fertility and their reproduction as well as causes other problems in the function of their reproductive system, for example “their monthly purge is also not as it should be, but is infrequent as scanty.” Due to their fat, their wombs are clogged which blocks male seed. All of these conditions and traits are evidence that supports his claim that the Scythian race is infertile and acts as an example of how the concept of environmental determinism manifests.

Writers in the medieval Middle East also produced theories of environmental determinism. The Afro-Arab writer al-Jahiz argued that the skin color of people and livestock were determined by the water, soil, and heat of their environments. He compared the color of black basalt in the northern Najd to the skin color of the peoples living there to support his theory.

Ibn Khaldun, the Arab sociologist and polymath, similarly linked skin color to environmental factors. In his &quot;Muqaddimah&quot; (1377), he wrote that black skin was due to the hot climate of sub-Saharan Africa and not due to African lineage. He thereby challenged Hamitic theories of race that held that the sons of Ham (son of Noah) were cursed with black skin. Many writings of Ibn Khaldun were translated during the colonial era in order to advance the colonial propaganda machine.

Ibn Khaldun believed that the physical environment influenced non-physical factors in addition to skin color. He argued that soil, climate, and food determined whether people were nomadic or sedentary, and what customs and ceremonies they held. His writings may have influenced the later writings of Montesquieu during the 18th century through the traveller Jean Chardin, who travelled to Persia and described theories resembling those of Ibn Khaldun.

=== Western colonial period ===

Environmental determinism has been widely criticized as a tool to legitimize colonialism, racism, and imperialism in Africa, The Americas, and Asia. Environmental determinism enabled geographers to scientifically justify the supremacy of white European races and the naturalness of imperialism. The scholarship bolstered religious justifications and in some cases superseded them during the late 19th century.

Many writers, including Thomas Jefferson, supported and legitimized African colonization by arguing that tropical climates made the people uncivilized. Jefferson argued that tropical climates encouraged laziness, relaxed attitudes, promiscuity and generally degenerative societies, while the frequent variability in the weather of the middle and northern latitudes led to stronger work ethics and civilized societies. Adolf Hitler also made use of this theory to extol the supremacy of the Nordic race.

Defects of character supposedly generated by tropical climates were believed to be inheritable under the Lamarckian theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, a discredited precursor to the Darwinian theory of natural selection. The theory begins with the observation that an organism faced with environmental pressures may undergo physiological changes during its lifetime through the process of acclimatization. Lamarckianism suggested that those physiological changes may be passed directly to offspring, without the need for offspring to develop the trait in the same manner.

Geographical societies like the Royal Geographical Society and the Société de géographie supported imperialism by funding explorers and other colonial proponents. Scientific societies acted similarly. Acclimatization societies directly supported colonial enterprises and enjoyed their benefits. The writings of Lamarck provided theoretical backing for the acclimatization doctrines. The Société Zoologique d&#x27;Acclimatation was largely founded by Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire—son of Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, a close colleague and supporter of Lamarck.

Ellen Churchill Semple, a prominent environmental determinism scholar, applied her theories in a case study which focused on the Philippines, where she mapped civilization and wildness onto the topography of the islands. Other scholars argued that climate and topography caused specific character traits to appear in a given populations. Scholars thereby imposed racial stereotypes on whole societies. Imperial powers rationalized labor exploitation by claiming that tropical peoples were morally inferior.

The role of environmental determinism in rationalizing and legitimizing racism, ethnocentrism and economic inequality has consequently drawn strong criticism.

David Landes similarly condemns of what he terms the unscientific moral geography of Ellsworth Huntington. He argues that Huntington undermined geography as a science by attributing all human activity to physical influences so that he might classify civilizations hierarchically – favoring those civilizations he considered best.

=== Late-20th-century growth of neo-environmental determinism ===
Environmental determinism was revived in the late-twentieth century as neo-environmental determinism, a new term coined by the social scientist and critic Andrew Sluyter. Sluyter argues that neo-environmental determinism does not sufficiently break with its classical and imperial precursors. Others have argued that in a certain sense a Darwinian approach to determinism is useful in shedding light on human nature.

Neo-environmental determinism examines how the physical environment predisposes societies and states towards particular trajectories of economic and political development. It explores how geographic and ecological forces influence state-building, economic development, and institutions. It also addresses fears surrounding the effects of modern climate change. Jared Diamond was influential in the resurgence of environmental determinism due to the popularity of his book &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;, which addresses the geographic origins of state formation prior to 1500 A.D.

Neo-environmental determinism scholars debate how much the physical environment shapes economic and political institutions. Economic historians Stanley Engerman and Kenneth Sokoloff argue that factor endowments greatly affected &quot;institutional&quot; development in the Americas, by which they mean the tendency to more free (democratic, free market) or unfree (dictatorial, economically restrictive) regimes.

In contrast, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson underscore that the geographic factors most influenced institutional development during early state formation and colonialism. They argue that geographic differences cannot explain economic growth disparities after 1500 A.D. directly, except through their effects on economic and political institutions.

Economists Jeffrey Sachs and John Luke Gallup have examined the direct impacts of geographic and climatic factors on economic development, especially the role of geography on the cost of trade and access to markets, the disease environment, and agricultural productivity.

The contemporary global warming crisis has also impacted environmental determinism scholarship. Jared Diamond draws similarities between the changing climate conditions that brought down the Easter Island civilization and modern global warming in his book &quot;&quot;. Alan Kolata, Charles Ortloff, and Gerald Huag similarly describe the Tiwanaku empire and Maya civilization collapses as caused by climate events such as drought. Peter deMenocal, Just as the earthworks in the deserts of the west grew out of notions of landscape painting, the growth of public art stimulated artists to engage the urban landscape as another environment and also as a platform to engage ideas and concepts about the environment to a larger audience. A scientist at the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, writes that societal collapse due to climate change is possible today.

== Ecological and geographic impacts on early state formation ==
=== Effects of species endowments, climate, and continental axes prior to 1500 ===

In the Pulitzer Prize winning &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; (1999), author Jared Diamond points to geography as the answer to why certain states were able to grow and develop faster and stronger than others. His theory cited the natural environment and raw materials a civilization had as factors for success, instead of popular century-old claims of racial and cultural superiority. Diamond says that these natural endowments began with the dawn of man, and favored Eurasian civilizations due to their location along similar latitudes, suitable farming climate, and early animal domestication.

Diamond argues that early states located along the same latitude lines were uniquely suited to take advantage of similar climates, making it easier for crops, livestock, and farming techniques to spread. Crops such as wheat and barley were simple to grow and easy to harvest, and regions suitable for their cultivation saw high population densities and the growth of early cities. The ability to domesticate herd animals, which had no natural fear of humans, high birth rates, and an innate hierarchy, gave some civilizations the advantages of free labor, fertilizers, and war animals. The east–west orientation of Eurasia allowed for knowledge capital to spread quickly, and writing systems to keep track of advanced farming techniques gave people the ability to store and build upon a knowledge base across generations. Craftsmanship flourished as a surplus of food from farming allowed some groups the freedom to explore and create, which led to the development of metallurgy and advances in technology. While the advantageous geography helped to develop early societies, the close proximity in which humans and their animals lived led to the spread of disease across Eurasia. Over several centuries, rampant disease decimated populations, but ultimately led to disease resistant communities. Diamond suggests that these chains of causation led to European and Asian civilizations holding a dominant place in the world today.

Diamond uses the Spanish conquistadors&#x27; conquering of the Americas as a case study for his theory. He argues that the Europeans took advantage of their environment to build large and complex states complete with advanced technology and weapons. The Incans and other native groups were not as fortunate, suffering from a north–south orientation that prevented the flow of goods and knowledge across the continent. The Americas also lacked the animals, metals, and complex writing systems of Eurasia which prevented them from achieving the military or biological protections needed to fight off the European threat.

Diamond&#x27;s theory has not gone without criticism.
* It was notably attacked for not providing enough detail regarding causation of environmental variables, and for leaving logical gaps in reasoning. Geographer Andrew Sluyter argued that Diamond was just as ignorant as the racists of the 19th century. Sluyter challenged Diamond&#x27;s theory since it seemed to suggest that environmental conditions lead to gene selection, which then lead to wealth and power for certain civilizations. Sluyter also attacks environmental determinism by condemning it as a highly studied and popular field based entirely on Diamond&#x27;s &quot;quick and dirty&quot; combination of natural and social sciences.
* Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson similarly criticized Diamond&#x27;s work in their book &quot;Why Nations Fail&quot;. They contend that the theory is outdated and can not effectively explain differences in economic growth after 1500 or the reasons why states that are geographically close can exhibit vast differences in wealth. They instead favored an institutional approach in which a society&#x27;s success or failure is based on the underlying strength of its institutions. Writing in response to institutional arguments, Diamond agreed that institutions are an important cause, but argued that their development is often heavily influenced by geography, such as the clear regional pattern in Africa where the northern and southern countries are wealthier than those in the tropical regions.

=== Geography and pre-colonial African state-building ===

==== The effects of climate and land abundance on the development of state systems ====
In his book &quot;States and Power in Africa&quot;, political scientist Jeffrey Herbst argues that environmental conditions help explain why, in contrast to other parts of the world such as Europe, many pre-colonial societies in Africa did not develop into dense, settled, hierarchical societies with strong state control that competed with neighboring states for people and territory.

Herbst argues that the European state-building experience was highly idiosyncratic because it occurred under systemic geographic pressures that favored wars of conquest – namely, passable terrain, land scarcity, and high-population densities. Faced with the constant threat of war, political elites sent administrators and armed forces from the urban centers into rural hinterlands to raise taxes, recruit soldiers, and fortify buffer zones. European states consequently developed strong institutions and capital-periphery linkages.

By contrast, geographic and climatic factors in pre-colonial Africa made establishing absolute control over particular pieces of land prohibitively costly. For example, because African farmers relied on rain-fed agriculture and consequently invested little in particular pieces of land, they could easily flee rulers rather than fight.

Some early African empires, like the Ashanti Empire, successfully projected power over large distances by building roads. The largest pre-colonial polities arose in the Sudanian Savanna belt of West Africa because the horses and camels could transport armies over the terrain. In other areas, no centralized political organizations existed above the village level.

African states did not develop more responsive institutions under colonial rule or post-independence. Colonial powers had little incentive to develop state institutions to protect their colonies against invasion, having divided up Africa at the Berlin Conference. The colonizers instead focused on exploiting natural resources and exploitation colonialism.

==== The effect of disease environments ====
Dr. Marcella Alsan argues the prevalence of the tsetse fly hampered early state formation in Africa. Because the tsetse virus was lethal to cows and horses, communities afflicted by the insect could not rely on the agricultural benefits provided by livestock. African communities were prevented from stockpiling agricultural surplus, working the land, or eating meat. Because the disease environment hindered the formation of farming communities, early African societies resembled small hunter-gatherer groups and not centralized states.

The relative availability of livestock animals enabled European societies to form centralized institutions, develop advanced technologies, and create an agricultural network. They could rely on their livestock to reduce the need for manual labor. Livestock also diminished the comparative advantage of owning slaves. African societies relied on the use of rival tribesman as slave labor where the fly was prevalent, which impeded long-term societal cooperation.

Alsan argues that her findings support the view of Kenneth Sokoloff and Stanley Engerman that factor endowments shape state institutions.

=== Llamas, chuño and the Inca Empire ===

Carl Troll has argued that the development of the Inca state in the central Andes was aided by conditions that allow for the elaboration of the staple food chuño. Chuño, which can be stored for long times, is made of potato dried at freezing temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern Peruvian highlands. Contradicting the link between the Inca state and dried potato is that other crops such as maize can also be preserved with only sun. Troll also argued that llamas, the Incas&#x27; pack animal, can be found in their largest numbers in this very same region. It is worth considering that the maximum extent of the Inca Empire coincided with the greatest distribution of alpacas and llamas. As a third point Troll pointed out irrigation technology as advantageous to the Inca state-building. While Troll theorized environmental influences on the Inca Empire, he opposed environmental determinism, arguing that culture lay at the core of the Inca civilization.

== Effects of geography on political regimes ==

Numerous scholars have argued that geographic and environmental factors affect the types of political regime that societies develop, and shape paths towards democracy versus dictatorship.

=== The disease environment ===
Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson have achieved notoriety for demonstrating that diseases and terrain have helped shape tendencies towards democracy versus dictatorship, and through these economic growth and development. In their book &quot;Why Nations Fail&quot;, as well as a paper titled &quot;The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation&quot;, the authors show that the colonial disease environment shaped the tendency for Europeans to settle the territory or not, and whether they developed systems of agriculture and labor markets that were free and egalitarian versus exploitative and unequal. These choices of political and economic institutions, they argue, shaped tendencies to democracy or dictatorship over the following centuries.

=== Factor endowments ===
In order to understand the impact and creation of institutions during early state formation, economic historians Stanley Engerman and Kenneth Sokoloff examined the economic development of the Americas during colonization. They found that the beginnings of the success or failure of American colonies were based on the specific factor endowments available to each colony. These endowments included the climate, soil profitability, crop potential, and even native population density. Institutions formed to take advantage of these factor endowments. Those that were most successful developed an ability to change and adapt to new circumstances over time. For example, the development of economic institutions, such as plantations, was caused by the need for a large property and labor force to harvest sugar and tobacco, while smallholder farms thrived in areas where scale economies were absent. Though initially profitable, plantation colonies also suffered from large dependent populations over time as slaves and natives were given few rights, limiting the population available to drive future economic progress and technological development.

Factor endowments also influenced political institutions. This is demonstrated by the plantation owning elite using their power to secure long lasting government institutions and pass legislation that leads to the persistence of inequality in society. Engerman and Sokoloff found smallholder economies to be more equitable since they discouraged an elite class from forming, and distributed political power democratically to most land-owning males. These differences in political institutions were also highly influential in the development of schools, as more equitable societies demanded an educated population to make political decisions. Over time these institutional advantages had exponential effects, as colonies with educated and free populations were better suited to take advantage of technological change during the industrial revolution, granting country wide participation into the booming free-market economy.

Engerman and Sokoloff conclude that while institutions heavily influenced the success of each colony, no individual type of institution is the source of economic and state growth. Other variables such as factor endowments, technologies, and the creation of property rights are just as crucial in societal development. To encourage state success an institution must be adaptable and suited to find the most economical source of growth. The authors also argue that while not the only means for success, institutional development has long lasting-economic and social effects on the state.

Other prominent scholars contest the extent to which factor endowments determine economic and political institutions.

American economists William Easterly and Ross Levine argue that economic development does not solely depend on geographic endowments—like temperate climates, disease-resistant climates, or soil favorable to cash crops. They stress that there is no evidence that geographic endowments influence country incomes other than through institutions. They observe that states like Burundi are poor—despite favorable environmental conditions like abundant rainfall and fertile soil—because of the damage wrought by colonialism. Other states like Canada with fewer endowments are more stable and have higher per capita incomes.

Easterly and Levine further observe that studies of how the environment directly influences land and labor were tarred by racist theories of underdevelopment, but that does not mean that such theories can be automatically discredited. They argue that Diamond correctly stresses the importance of germs and crops in the very long-run of societal technological development. They find that regression results support the findings of Jared Diamond and David Landes that factor endowments influence GDP per capita. However, Easterly and Levine&#x27;s findings most support the view that long-lasting institutions most shape economic development outcomes. Relevant institutions include private property rights and the rule of law.

Jeffrey B. Nugent and James A. Robinson similarly challenge scholars like Barrington Moore who hold that certain factor endowments and agricultural preconditions necessarily lead to particular political and economic organizations. Nugent and Robinson show that coffee economies in South America pursued radically different paths of political and economic development during the nineteenth century.

Some coffee states, like Costa Rica and Colombia, passed laws like the Homestead Act of 1862. They favored smallholders, held elections, maintained small militaries, and fought fewer wars. Smallholder arrangements prompted widespread government investment in education. Other states like El Salvador and Guatemala produced coffee on plantations, where individuals were more disenfranchised. Whether a state became a smallholder or plantation state depended not on factor endowments but on norms established under colonialism—namely, legal statutes determining access to land, the background of the governing elites, and the degree of permitted political competition. Nugent and Robinson thereby conclude that factor endowments alone do not determine economic or political institutions.

== Direct effects of geography on economic development ==

=== Effects of terrain on trade and productivity ===
Historians have also noted population densities seem to concentrate on coastlines and that states with large coasts benefit from higher average incomes compared to those in landlocked countries. Coastal living has proven advantageous for centuries as civilizations relied on the coastline and waterways for trade, irrigation, and as a food source. Conversely, countries without coastlines or navigable waterways are often less urbanized and have less growth potential due to the slow movement of knowledge capital, technological advances, and people. They also have to rely on costly and time-consuming over-land trade, which usually results in lack of access to regional and international markets, further hindering growth. Additionally, interior locations tend to have both lower population densities and labor-productivity levels. However, factors including fertile soil, nearby rivers, and ecological systems suited for rice or wheat cultivation can give way to dense inland populations.

Nathan Nunn and Diego Puga note that though rugged terrain usually makes farming difficult, prevents travel, and limits societal growth, early African states used harsh terrain to their advantage. The authors used a terrain ruggedness index to quantify topographic heterogeneity across several regions of Africa, while simultaneously controlling for variables such as diamond availability and soil fertility. The results suggest that historically, ruggedness is strongly correlated with decreased income levels across the globe and has negatively impacted state growth over time. They note that harsh terrain limited the flow of trade goods and decreased crop availability, while isolating communities from developing knowledge capital. However, the study also demonstrated that the terrain had positive effects on some African communities by protecting them from the slave trade. Communities that were located in areas with rugged features could successfully hide from slave traders and protect their homes from being destroyed. The study found that in these areas rugged topography produced long-term economic benefits and aided post-colonial state formation.

=== Effects of climate on productivity ===
The impact that climate and water navigability have on economic growth and GDP per capita was studied by notable scholars including Paul Krugman, Jared Diamond, and Jeffrey Sachs. By using variables to measure environmental determinism, such as climate, land composition, latitude, and the presence of infectious disease, they account for trends in worldwide economic development on local, regional and global scales. To do so, they measure economic growth with GDP per capita adjusted to purchasing power parity (PPP), while also taking into consideration population density and labor productivity.

Economic historians have found that societies in the Northern Hemisphere experience higher standards of living, and that as latitude increases north or south from the equator, levels of real GDP per capita also increases. Climate is closely correlated with agricultural production since without ideal weather conditions, agriculture alone will not produce the surplus supply needed to build and maintain economies. Locations with hot tropical climates often suffer underdevelopment due to low fertility of soils, excessive plant transpiration, ecological conditions favoring infectious diseases, and unreliable water supply. These factors can cause tropical zones to suffer a 30% to 50% decrease in productivity relative to temperate climate zones. Tropical infectious diseases that thrive in hot and moist equatorial climates cause thousands of deaths each year. They are also an economic drain on society due to high medical costs, and the unwillingness of foreign capital to invest in a sickly state. Because infectious diseases like malaria often need a warm ecology for growth, states in the mid to high latitudes are naturally protected from the devastating effects of those diseases.

=== Climatic determinism and colonization ===
Climatic determinism, otherwise referred to as the &quot;equatorial paradox,&quot; is an aspect of economic geography. According to this theory, about 70% of a country&#x27;s economic development can be predicted by the distance between that country and the equator, and that the further from the equator a country is located, the more developed it tends to be. The theory is the central argument of Philip M. Parker&#x27;s &quot;Physioeconomics: The Basis for Long-Run Economic Growth&quot;, in which he argues that since humans originated as tropical mammals, those who relocated to colder climates attempt to restore their physiological homeostasis through wealth-creation. This act includes producing more food, better housing, heating, warm clothes, etc. Conversely, humans that remained in warmer climates are more physiologically comfortable simply due to temperature, and so have less incentive to work to increase their comfort levels. Therefore, according to Parker GDP is a direct product of the natural compensation of humans to their climate.

Political geographers have used climatic determinism ideology to attempt to predict and rationalize the history of civilization, as well as to explain existing or perceived social and cultural divides between peoples. Some argue that one of the first attempts geographers made to define the development of human geography across the globe was to relate a country&#x27;s climate to human development. Using this ideology, many geographers believed they were able &quot;to explain and predict the progress of human societies&quot;. This led to warmer climate zones being &quot;seen as producing less civilized, more degenerate peoples, in need of salvation by western colonial powers.&quot;

Ellsworth Huntington also travelled continental Europe in hopes of better understanding the connection between climate and state success, publishing his findings in &quot;The Pulse of Asia&quot;, and further elaborating in &quot;Civilization and Climate&quot;. Like the political geographers, a crucial component of his work was the belief that the climate of North-western Europe was ideal, with areas further north being too cold, and areas further south being too hot, resulting in lazy, laid-back populations. These ideas were powerful connections to colonialism, and may have played a role in the creation of the &#x27;other&#x27; and the literature that many used to justify taking advantage of less advanced nations. Huntington also argued that climate can lead to the demise of even advanced civilizations through drought, food insecurity, and damages to economic production.

<text>The American Basketball Association (ABA) was a men&#x27;s professional basketball major league from 1967 to 1976. The ABA merged into the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1976, resulting in four ABA teams joining the NBA and the introduction of the NBA 3-point shot in 1979.

== History ==
In 1965, Dennis Murphy, a marketing executive and sports fan, had come up with wanting to make a football team in Anaheim, California, which led to a group sponsoring a doubleheader game in the city with the American Football League. But the war that the AFL had with the National Football League soon would come to a close with a merger. Not wanting to waste the effort of people who had some money and liked sports, Murphy came up with the idea of making a second basketball league, as it happened to be his favorite sport.

Murphy soon talked with Bill Sharman, who had coached in the last &quot;second basketball league&quot; with the American Basketball League (1961-62) and they came up with the name of the league. While Sharman could not get involved with the ABA at the time due to coaching matters, he suggested talking to George Mikan along with suggesting the use of the three-point play (an ABL staple). The eventual meeting with Mikan led to interest along with the mention of other names interested in business. 

Eventually, an array of investors were lined up in several cities: Art Kim in Anaheim, Arthur J. Brown in New York, the DeVoe family in Indiana, Gabe Rubin in Pittsburgh, T. C. Morrow in Houston, Joe Gregory in Kentucky, Ken Davidson in Oakland, Charlie Smither in New Orleans, Robert Folsom in Dallas, and Larry Shields in Minnesota. Mikan agreed to be commissioner and spearheaded the use of a red-white-blue ball to go along with the three point play.

The ABA was conceived at a time stretching from 1960 through the mid-1970s when numerous upstart leagues were challenging, with varying degrees of success, the established major professional sports leagues in the United States. Basketball was seen as particularly vulnerable to a challenge; its major league, the National Basketball Association, was the youngest of the Big Four major leagues, having only played 21 seasons to that point, and was still fending off contemporary challenging leagues (it had been less than five years since the American Basketball League (ABL) shut down); the league, often considered third or fourth in coverage when compared to baseball or football, had just 12 teams at the time the ABA was founded. According to one of the owners of the Indiana Pacers, its goal was to force a merger with the more established league. Potential investors were told that they could get an ABA team for half of what it cost to get an NBA expansion team at the time. When the merger occurred, ABA officials said their investment would more than double.

The ABA distinguished itself from its older counterpart with a more wide-open, flashy style of offensive play, as well as differences in rules — a 30-second shot clock (as opposed to the NBA&#x27;s 24-second clock, though the ABA did switch to the 24 second shot clock for the 1975–76 season) and use of a three-point field goal arc, pioneered in the earlier ABL. Also, the ABA used a colorful red, white and blue ball, instead of the NBA&#x27;s traditional orange ball. The ABA also had several &quot;regional&quot; franchises, such as the Virginia Squires and Carolina Cougars, that played &quot;home&quot; games in several cities.

The league&#x27;s practice of luring players with money would spur a war with the NBA. Under the &quot;Dolgoff Plan&quot; (as first used by the Indiana Pacers), teams would pay a player a certain amount of money over a certain amount of years as an annuity (for example, Jim Ard signed a $1.4 million contract with the Nets that saw him paid $250,000 in total from 1970 to 1974 while the team would put $8,000 a year for ten years where Ard would receive $1.15 million paid to him over the course of 24 years, starting in 1989). Various players such as Dan Issel and Rick Mount would be paid in this manner, much to the consternation of jilted executives in the NBA, who even believed the league was paying off agents to help players agree to these contracts, which in select cases was correct. Both leagues went as far as spying to keep tabs on signings.

In the 1973–74 season, the ABA also adopted the no-disqualification foul rule: instead of fouling out after six infractions, when a player is charged with his seventh or succeeding fouls, the opposing team retains possession and the offended team attempts any free throw.

The ABA also went after four of the best referees in the NBA: Earl Strom, John Vanak, Norm Drucker and Joe Gushue, getting them to &quot;jump&quot; leagues by offering them far more in money and benefits. In Earl Strom&#x27;s memoir &quot;Calling the Shots&quot;, Strom conveys both the heady sense of being courted by a rival league with money to burn — and also the depression that set in the next year when he began refereeing in the ABA, with less prominent players performing in inadequate arenas, in front of very small crowds. Nevertheless, the emergence of the ABA boosted the salaries of referees just as it did the salaries of players.

However, ABA teams like the Nets, Colonels, Pacers, Spurs, Nuggets and Stars, especially in latest seasons, registered higher attendance on average than most NBA teams at that time (excluding the Lakers, Knicks, Celtics, SuperSonics and Bucks).

The freewheeling style of the ABA eventually caught on with fans, but the lack of a national television contract and protracted financial losses would spell doom for the ABA as an independent circuit. In 1976, its last year of existence, the ABA pioneered the now-popular slam dunk contest at its all-star game in Denver.
The league succeeded in forcing a merger with the NBA in the 1976 offseason. Four ABA teams were absorbed into the older league: the New York Nets, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs. As part of the merger agreement, the four teams were not permitted to participate in the 1976 NBA draft. The merger was particularly hard on the Nets; the New York Knicks were firmly established in their arena, Madison Square Garden, and would not permit the Nets to share dates there. For drawing audience away from the Knicks, the Nets were forced to pay $4.3M to the Knicks organization. The Nets offered league superstar Julius Erving instead but the Knicks declined. The Nets had to settle for an arena in Piscataway, New Jersey, and, to meet expenses, were forced to sell the contract of Erving to the Philadelphia 76ers.

Two other clubs, the Kentucky Colonels and the Spirits of St. Louis, were disbanded upon the merger, with each getting a buyout: the Colonels received a one-time buyout that owner John Y. Brown, Jr. used to purchase the NBA&#x27;s Buffalo Braves, while the Spirits owners negotiated a cut of the other ABA teams&#x27; television revenues in perpetuity. This deal netted the ownership group of the Spirits over $300M over nearly four decades due to a large increase in television revenues. In 2014, the NBA and the Spirits ownership agreed to phase out future payments in exchange for a one-time payment of $500M, making the total value for the deal over $800M. The seventh remaining team, the Virginia Squires, received nothing, as they had ceased operations shortly before the merger. The players from the Colonels, Spirits, and Squires were made available to NBA teams through a dispersal draft; the four teams absorbed by the NBA were allowed to choose players from this draft.

One of the more significant long-term contributions of the ABA to professional basketball was to tap into markets in the southeast that had been collegiate basketball hotbeds (including North Carolina, Virginia, and Kentucky). The NBA was focused on the urban areas of the Northeast, Midwest and West Coast. At the time, it showed no interest in placing a team south of Washington, D.C., other than the Atlanta metropolitan area where the NBA&#x27;s Hawks franchise relocated from St. Louis in 1968.

=== Commissioners ===
* George Mikan 1967–1969
* James Carson Gardner 1969 (interim)
* Jack Dolph 1969–1972
* Bob Carlson 1972–1973
* Mike Storen 1973–74
* Tedd Munchak 1974–75
* Dave DeBusschere 1975–76

NBA great George Mikan was the first commissioner of the ABA, where he introduced both the 3-point line and the league&#x27;s trademark red, white, and blue basketball. Mikan resigned in 1969. Dave DeBusschere, one of the stars of the New York Knicks championship teams, moved from his job as vice president and GM of the ABA&#x27;s New York Nets in 1975 to become the last commissioner of the ABA and facilitate the ABA–NBA merger in 1976.

=== Spencer Haywood Hardship Rule ===
One of the primary contributions of the ABA to modern NBA was the introduction of the Spencer Haywood Hardship Rule, which would later become the framework for the current NBA draft eligibility system that allows players to declare for the NBA after being one year removed from their high school graduation. The origin of the Hardship Rule was a result of the NBA prohibiting players from joining the league until they had completed their four years of college eligibility.

In 1969, Spencer Haywood left the University of Detroit as a sophomore and signed with the Denver Rockets. The ABA believed that in extenuating circumstances, such as a financial situation or familial needs, players should be able to leave for professional leagues early. While the NBA and NCAA initially contested the rule, after the courts ruled in favor of Haywood playing in the ABA, the NBA followed suit and relaxed the four year rule to allow players to enter the league if they qualified as a hardship on the basis of “financial condition…family, [or] academic record.” Haywood paved the way for other players to enter the ABA before they had completed their collegiate careers such as George McGinnis and Julius Erving. Today, the &quot;one-and-done&quot; rule in the NBA can be traced back to the ABA&#x27;s decision to allow players to leave college early and pursue a professional career before they had completed their collegiate careers.

=== Slam Dunk Contest ===

The ABA pioneered the advent of the now popular NBA slam dunk contest at the final ABA All-Star Game in 1976. The game was held in Denver, and the owners of the ABA teams wanted to ensure that the event would be entertaining for the sellout crowd of 15,021 people. The ABA and NBA had begun to discuss a possible merger, and the ABA owners wanted to establish the viability and success of their league. The Dunk Contest operated as a means of unique halftime entertainment that displayed the style and excitement that the ABA players brought to the game. The dunk contest was held at halftime of the All-Star game and the contestants were Artis Gilmore, George Gervin, David Thompson, Larry Kenon, and Julius Erving. The winner of the contest received $1,000 and a stereo system. Julius Erving went on to win the competition by completing the now famous free throw line dunk. The Slam Dunk Contest would make its way to the NBA in 1976–77 as a season-long competition for that season only, and on a permanent basis as a standalone event as part of the NBA All-Star Weekend in 1984.

==Teams==
Of the original 11 teams, only the Kentucky Colonels and Indiana Pacers remained for all nine seasons without relocating, changing team names, or folding. However, the Denver Larks/Rockets/Nuggets, a team that had been planned for Kansas City, Missouri, moved to Denver without playing a game in Kansas City due to the lack of a suitable arena. In addition to the four surviving ABA teams, eight current NBA markets have ABA heritage: Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, Memphis, Miami, Minnesota, New Orleans, and Utah all had an ABA team before their current NBA teams.

==Succession==
In 1999, a new league calling itself the ABA 2000 was established. The new league uses a similar red, white and blue basketball as the old ABA, but unlike the original ABA, it does not feature players of similar caliber to the NBA, nor does it play games in major arenas or on television as the original ABA did.

<doc id="72164" wikidata="Q5023" url="?curid=72164" title="Cook Strait">
<text>Cook Strait () is a strait that separates the North and South Islands of New Zealand. The strait connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast. It is wide at its narrowest point, and has been described as &quot;one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world&quot;. Regular ferry services run across the strait between Picton in the Marlborough Sounds and Wellington.

The strait is named after James Cook, the first European commander to sail through it, in 1770. In Māori it is named &quot;Te Moana-o-Raukawa&quot;, which means &quot;The Sea of Raukawa&quot;. Raukaua is a type of woody shrub native to New Zealand. The waters of Cook Strait are dominated by strong tidal flows. The tidal flow through Cook Strait is unusual in that the tidal elevation at the ends of the strait are almost exactly out of phase with one another, so high water on one side meets low water on the other. A number of ships have been wrecked in Cook Strait with significant loss of life, such as the &quot;Maria&quot; in 1851, the &quot;City of Dunedin&quot; in 1865, the &quot;St Vincent&quot; in 1869, the &quot;Lastingham&quot; in 1884, in 1909 and in 1968.

==History==
In Māori legend, Cook Strait was discovered by Kupe the navigator. Kupe followed in his canoe a monstrous octopus called Te Wheke-a-Muturangi across Cook Strait and destroyed it in Tory Channel or at Pātea.

When Dutch explorer Abel Tasman first saw New Zealand in 1642, he thought Cook Strait was a bight closed to the east. He named it &quot;Zeehaen&#x27;s Bight&quot;, after the &quot;Zeehaen&quot;, one of the two ships in his expedition. In 1769 James Cook established that it was a strait, which formed a navigable waterway.

Cook Strait attracted European settlers in the early 19th century. Because of its use as a whale migration route, whalers established bases in the Marlborough Sounds, based out of Tory Channel and Port Underwood, and also in the Kāpiti area. From the late 1820s until the mid-1960s Arapaoa Island was a base for whaling in the Sounds. Perano Head on the east coast of the island was the principal whaling station for the area from 1911. The houses built by the Perano family are now operated as tourist accommodation.

During the 1820s Te Rauparaha led a Māori migration to, and the conquest and settlement of, the Cook Strait region. In 1822 Ngāti Toa migrated to Cook Strait region, led by Te Rauparaha. 

From 1840 more permanent settlements sprang up, first at Wellington, then at Nelson and at Whanganui (Petre). At this period the settlers saw Cook Strait in a broader sense than today&#x27;s ferry-oriented New Zealanders: for them the strait stretched from Taranaki to Cape Campbell, so these early towns all clustered around &quot;Cook Strait&quot; (or &quot;Cook&#x27;s Strait&quot;, in the pre-Geographic Board usage of the times) as the central feature and central waterway of the new colony.
Between 1888 and 1912 a Risso&#x27;s dolphin named Pelorus Jack became famous for meeting and escorting ships around Cook Strait. Pelorus Jack was usually spotted in Admiralty Bay between Cape Francis and Collinet Point, near French Pass, a channel used by ships travelling between Wellington and Nelson. Pelorus Jack is also remembered after he was the subject of a failed assassination attempt. He was later protected by a 1904 New Zealand law.

At times when New Zealand feared invasion, various coastal fortifications were constructed to defend Cook Strait. During the Second World War, two gun installations were constructed on Wrights Hill behind Wellington. These guns could range across Cook Strait. In addition thirteen gun installations were constructed around Wellington, along the Mākara coast, and at entrances to the Marlborough Sounds. The remains of most of these fortifications can still be seen.

The Pencarrow Head Lighthouse at the entrance from Cook Strait to Wellington Harbour was the first permanent lighthouse built in New Zealand. Its first keeper, Mary Jane Bennett, was the only female lighthouse keeper in New Zealand&#x27;s history. The light was decommissioned in 1935 when it was replaced by the Baring Head Lighthouse.

== Geography ==

Approximately 18,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum when sea levels were over lower than present day levels, Cook Strait was a deep harbour of the Pacific Ocean, disconnected from the Tasman Sea by the vast coastal plains which formed at the South Taranaki Bight which connected the North and South islands. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, eventually separating the islands and linking Cook Strait to the Tasman Sea.

The strait runs in a general NW-SE direction, with the South Island on the west side and North Island on the east. At its narrowest point, separate Cape Terawhiti in the North Island from Perano Head on Arapaoa Island in the Marlborough Sounds. Perano Head is actually further north than Cape Terawhiti. In good weather one can see clearly across the strait.

The west (South Island) coast runs along Cloudy Bay and past the islands and entrances to the Marlborough Sounds. The east (North Island) coast runs along Palliser Bay, crosses the entrance to Wellington Harbour, past some Wellington suburbs and continues another to Mākara Beach.

The Brothers is a group of tiny islands in Cook Strait off the east coast of Arapaoa Island. North Brother island in this small chain is a sanctuary for the rare Brothers Island tuatara, while the largest of the islands is the site of the Brothers Island Lighthouse.The shores of Cook Strait on both sides are mostly composed of steep cliffs. The beaches of Cloudy Bay, Clifford Bay, and Palliser Bay shoal gently down to , where there is a more or less extensive submarine plateau. The rest of the bottom topography is complex. To the east is the Cook Strait Canyon with steep walls descending eastwards into the bathyal depths of the Hikurangi Trough. To the north-west lies the Narrows Basin, where water is deep. Fisherman&#x27;s Rock in the north end of the Narrows Basin rises to within a few metres of low tide, and is marked by waves breaking in rough weather. A relatively shallow submarine valley lies across the northern end of the Marlborough Sounds. The bottom topography is particularly irregular around the coast of the South Island where the presence of islands, underwater rocks, and the entrances to the sounds, create violent eddies. The strait has an average depth of .

In 1855 a severe earthquake occurred on both sides of Cook Strait. In 2013 two large earthquakes measuring 6.5 and 6.6 on the Richter Scale struck Cook Strait, causing significant damage in the town of Seddon, with minor to moderate damage in Wellington.

==Oceanography==

The waters of Cook Strait are dominated by strong tidal flows. The tidal flow through Cook Strait is unusual in that the tidal elevation at the ends of the strait are almost exactly out of phase with one another, so high water on one side meets low water on the other. This is because the main M2 lunar tide component that happens about twice per day (actually 12.42 hours) circulates anti-clockwise around New Zealand, and is out of phase at each end of the strait (see animation on the right). On the Pacific Ocean side the high tide occurs five hours before it occurs at the Tasman Sea side. On one side is high tide and on the other is low tide. The difference in sea level can drive tidal currents up to 2.5 metres per second (5 knots) across Cook Strait.

There are numerous computer models of the tidal flow through Cook Strait. While the tidal components are readily realizable, the residual flow is more difficult to model. Probably the most prolific oceanographer to research the strait was Ron Heath based at the N.Z. Oceanographic Institute. He produced a number of studies including analysis of tides which identified the presence of a &quot;virtual amphidrome&quot; in the region. Heath also quantified a best estimate for the time of the &quot;residual current&quot; (i.e. net current after averaging out the tidal influence) in the strait. This continues to be a topic of research with computer simulations combining with large datasets to refine the estimate.



Despite the strong currents, there is almost zero tidal height change in the centre of the strait. Instead of the tidal surge flowing in one direction for six hours and then in the reverse direction for six hours, a particular surge might last eight or ten hours with the reverse surge enfeebled. In especially boisterous weather conditions the reverse surge can be negated, and the flow can remain in the same direction through three surge periods and longer. This is indicated on marine charts for the region. Furthermore, the submarine ridges running off from the coast complicate the ocean flow and turbulence. The substantial levels of turbulence have been compared to that observed in the Straits of Gibraltar and Seymour Narrows in British Columbia.

Cook Strait is an important habitat for many cetacean species. Several dolphins (bottlenose, common, dusky) frequent the area along with killer whales and the endemic Hector&#x27;s dolphins. Long-finned pilot whales often strand en masse at Golden Bay. The famous Pelorus Jack was a Risso&#x27;s dolphin being observed escorting the ships between 1888 and 1912, though this species is not a common visitor to the New Zealand&#x27;s waters. Large migratory whales attracted many whalers to the area in the winter. Currently, an annual survey of counting humpback whales is taken by Department of Conservation and former whalers help DOC to spot animals by using several vantage points along the strait such as on Stephens Island. Other occasional visitors include southern right whales, blue whales, sei whales and sperm whales. Giant squid specimens have been washed ashore around Cook Strait or found in the stomachs of sperm whales off Kaikōura.

A colony of male fur seals has long been established near Pariwhero / Red Rocks on the south Wellington coast. Cook Strait offers good game fishing. Albacore tuna can be caught from January to May. Broadbill swordfish, bluenose, mako sharks and the occasional marlin and white shark can also be caught.

==Transport==
=== Ferry services ===

Regular ferry services run between Picton in the Marlborough Sounds and Wellington, operated by KiwiRail (the Interislander) and StraitNZ (Bluebridge). Both companies run services several times a day. Roughly half the crossing is in the strait, and the remainder within the Sounds. The journey covers and takes about three hours. The strait often experiences rough water and heavy swells from strong winds, especially from the south. New Zealand&#x27;s position directly athwart the roaring forties means that the strait funnels westerly winds and deflects them into northerlies. As a result, ferry sailings are often disrupted and Cook Strait is regarded as one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world. In 1962 the first ferry service to allow railway carriages, cars and trucks began with GMV &quot;Aramoana&quot;. In 1994 the first fast-ferry service began operation across Cook Strait.

=== Shipwrecks and major events ===

In 1851 the barque &quot;Maria&quot; wrecked on rocks at Cape Terawhiti, killing 28 people. In 1865 the paddle steamer &quot;City of Dunedin&quot; sank, killing 50 to 60 people. In 1869 &quot;St Vincent&quot; wrecked in Palliser Bay, killing 20 people. In 1884 &quot;Lastingham&quot; was wrecked at Cape Jackson, killing 18 people. In 1909 wrecked in Cook Strait, killing 75 people. In 1968, the , a Wellington–Lyttelton ferry of the Union Company, foundered at the entrance to Wellington Harbour and capsized. Of the 610 passengers and 123 crew on board, 53 died. On 16 February 1986 the cruise ship &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot; struck rocks at Cape Jackson at the northern tip of the Marlborough Sounds and sank in Port Gore, with one person killed. 

In 2006, waves resulted in the Interislander ferry DEV Aratere slewing violently and heeling to 50 degrees. Three passengers and a crew member were injured, five rail wagons were toppled and many trucks and cars were heavily damaged. Maritime NZ&#x27;s expert witness Gordon Wood claimed that if the ferry had capsized most passengers and crew would have been trapped inside and would have had no warning or time to put on lifejackets.

In 1990 Stephen Preest made the first crossing and double crossing by hovercraft.

In 2005, the retired frigate was sunk in Cook Strait off the south coast of Wellington as an artificial reef.

=== Air services ===

The first aeroplane flight across Cook Strait occurred in 1920, jet aeroplane in 1946, helicopter crossing in 1956, glider crossing in 1957, balloon crossing (by Roland Parsons and Rex Brereton) in 1975, microlight aircraft in 1982, autogyros in 1999, paraglider (by Matt Standford) in 2013. In 2021 the first electric aircraft flight across Cook Strait, from Omaka Aerodrome to Wellington Airport, by Gary Freedman in a Pipistrel Alpha Electro.

Air services began across Cook Strait in 1935. Air lines which operate or have operated flights across Cook Strait include Straits Air Freight Express, Air2there, CityJet and Sounds Air.

== Cables ==

In 1866, the first telegraph cable was laid in Cook Strait from Lyall Bay on Wellington’s south coast to Whites Bay, north of Blenheim, connecting the South Island telegraph system to Wellington. In 1879 the vessel &quot;Kangaroo&quot; laid a further telegraph cable across Cook Strait from Whanganui to Wakapuaka, near Nelson.

Electric power and communication cables link the North and South Islands across Cook Strait, operated by Transpower. In 1964 Cook Strait power cables laid. In 1991 five new power and communication cables were laid. In 2002 two further communications cables were laid.

Three submarine power cables cross Cook Strait between Oteranga Bay in the North Island and Fighting Bay in the South Island as part of the HVDC Inter-Island, which provides an electricity link between Benmore in the South island and Haywards in the North Island. Each cable operates at 350 kV, and can carry up to 500 MW, with Pole 2 of the link using one cable and Pole 3 using two cables. The link&#x27;s total capacity is 1200 MW (500MW for Pole 2 and 700MW for Pole 3). The cables are laid on the seabed within a legally defined zone called the cable protection zone (CPZ). The CPZ is about wide for most of its length, narrowing where it nears the terminals on each shore. Fishing activities and anchoring boats are prohibited within the CPZ.

Fibre optic cables carry telecommunications across Cook Strait, used by New Zealand&#x27;s main telecommunication companies for domestic and commercial traffic and by Transpower for control of the HVDC link.

==Tidal power==
The electrical power generated by tidal marine turbines varies as the cube of the tidal speed. Because the tidal speed doubles, eight times more tidal power is produced during spring tides than at neaps. Cook Strait has been identified as a potentially excellent source of tidal energy.

In April 2008, Neptune Power was granted a resource consent to install a $10 million experimental underwater tidal stream turbine capable of producing one megawatt. The turbine was designed in Britain, and was to be built in New Zealand and placed in of water, due south of Sinclair Head, in waters known as the &quot;Karori rip&quot;. The company claimed there is enough tidal movement in Cook Strait to generate 12 GW of power, more than one-and-a-half times New Zealand&#x27;s current requirements. In practice, only some of this energy could be harnessed. As of October 2016, this turbine had not been built and the Neptune Power website is a placeholder with no further announcements.

On the other side of the strait, Energy Pacifica applied for resource consent to install up to 10 marine turbines, each able to produce up to 1.2 MW, near the Cook Strait entrance to Tory Channel. The company claimed that Tory Channel was an optimal site with a tidal current speed of and the best combination of bathymetry and accessibility to the electricity network. However, despite being validated by computer modelling, no project was forthcoming.

==Swimming==
According to oral tradition, the first woman to swim Cook Strait was Hine Poupou. She swam from Kapiti Island to d&#x27;Urville Island with the help of a dolphin. Other Māori accounts tell of at least one swimmer who crossed the strait in 1831. In modern times, the strait was swum by Barrie Devenport in 1962. Lynne Cox was the first woman to swim it, in 1975. The most prolific swimmer of the strait is Philip Rush, who has crossed eight times, including two double crossings. Aditya Raut was the youngest swimmer at 11 years. Caitlin O&#x27;Reilly was the youngest female swimmer and youngest New Zealander at 12 years. Pam Dickson was the oldest swimmer at 55 years. John Coutts was the first person to swim the strait in both directions. By 2010, 74 single crossings had been made by 65 individuals, and three double crossings had been made by two individuals (Philip Rush and Meda McKenzie). In March 2016, Marilyn Korzekwa became the first Canadian and oldest woman, at 58 years old, to swim the strait.

Crossing times by swimmers are largely determined by the strong and sometimes unpredictable currents that operate in the strait. In 1980 the oceanographer Ron Heath published an analysis of currents in Cook Strait using the tracks of swimmers. This was from a time when detailed measurement of ocean currents was technologically difficult.

In 1984 Philip Rush swam the strait both ways. In 1984 Meda McKenzie became the first woman to swim the strait both ways.

<doc id="72165" wikidata="Q312398" url="?curid=72165" title="Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire">
<text>Thomas Boleyn, Earl of Wiltshire, 1st Earl of Ormond, 1st Viscount Rochford ( – 12 March 1539), of Hever Castle in Kent, was an English diplomat and politician who was the father of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII, and was thus the maternal grandfather of Queen Elizabeth I. By Henry VIII he was made a knight of the Garter in 1523 and was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Rochford in 1525 and in 1529 was further ennobled as Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond.

==Origins==
He was born in about 1477 at Hever Castle in Kent, the son of Sir William Boleyn (1451–1505) of Blickling (purchased by Sir William&#x27;s father Sir Geoffrey Boleyn, a wealthy mercer who served as Lord Mayor of London) by his wife Margaret Butler (1454–1539), a daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond.

==Marriage and issue==
He married Elizabeth Howard, eldest daughter of Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey by his wife Elizabeth Tilney. Five children are attested, only three of whom survived childhood: 

* Thomas Boleyn (1496 - 1506) died young of sweating sickness; 
* Mary Boleyn ( – 19 July 1543); Mary Carey (1520–1528); Mary Stafford (1534–1543); Mary&#x27;s second husband, William Stafford, was knighted in 1545 – two years after his wife&#x27;s death in 1543.
* Henry Boleyn (1500 - 1506) died young of sweating sickness;
* George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford (1504 - 17 May 1536), only surviving son and heir apparent who predeceased his father, having been executed in 1536 together with his sister the queen. From 1529 he used his father&#x27;s junior title of Viscount Rochford as a courtesy title.
* Anne Boleyn ( – 19 May 1536), Marchioness of Pembroke (1532–1536); later Queen Consort of England (1533–1536) 

==Diplomatic career==
In his youth, Thomas Boleyn was active in the court of Henry VII. He attended the wedding of Prince Arthur with Catherine of Aragon. In 1503, he was part of Princess Margaret Tudor’s escort, to Scotland, to marry King James IV. He was created a Knight of the Bath at the coronation of Henry VIII in 1509. In February 1511, Boleyn took part in the Westminster Tournament, held to celebrate the birth of Henry, Duke of Cornwall. He was paired with Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset in costumes featuring emblems of pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.

His appointment in 1512 as ambassador to the Low Countries brought him into contact with the regent Archduchess Margaret of Austria. Like Thomas, Margaret of Austria spoke French and Latin and they got along well enough for her to accept his daughter Anne as a maid of honour.

Through his ability and the connections of his extended family, Thomas Boleyn became one of Henry VIII&#x27;s leading diplomats. Known appointments and missions included:
*1511 and 1517: Sheriff of Kent.
*1512: One of a party of three envoys to the Netherlands.
*1518–1520: ambassador to France, where he was initially involved in arrangements for the &quot;Field of Cloth of Gold&quot; meeting between Henry and the new French King Francis I. He was replaced as ambassador however by Sir Richard Wingfield who took over the preparations for the meeting between the two kings in 1520.
*1521 and 1523: Envoy to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.
*1527: One of a large envoy to France.
*1529: Envoy to a meeting of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and Pope Clement VII, to seek support for the marriage annulment of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. This was followed by another envoy to France.

==Titles obtained==
Boleyn was invested as a Knight of the Garter in 1523.

Boleyn&#x27;s claim to his other titles derived from his mother, Margaret Butler who was the younger daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond. Thomas Butler, as an Irish peer, should only have sat in the Parliament of Ireland. However, as a personal friend of Henry VII he was summoned to the English parliament in November 1488 as &quot;Thomas Ormond de Rochford, &quot;chevaler&quot;&quot;. At this time, he was already 8th Earl of Carrick and 7th Earl of Ormond.

In English law, matrilineal descent is not considered valid for earldoms, and in Brehon law, then largely still in use in Ireland, new leaders were chosen by election. These customs were, in Boleyn&#x27;s case, outweighed by a more important consideration – he was the father of two daughters. Henry VIII had affairs first with Boleyn&#x27;s elder daughter Mary, then with his younger daughter, Anne. Boleyn&#x27;s ambition was so considerable that unsubstantiated rumours had it that he allowed his wife to have an affair with the king, but those rumours were intended to steer the king away from marrying Anne, and even suggested that she was his own daughter. When it was claimed that Henry had had an affair with both Anne&#x27;s sister and mother, the king replied to the rumours, &quot;Never with the mother.&quot;

In 1525, Henry VIII became enamoured of Anne and began pursuing her. Her father was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Rochford on 18 June 1525. The title referred to the &quot;barony&quot; of Rochford supposedly created in 1488 for his grandfather. The title had fallen into abeyance as Ormond had died without any male heir in 1515. Boleyn is often thought of as a power hungry, ambitious and scheming man who sacrificed his daughters for personal gain, but his biographer, Lauren Mackay, has argued that he enjoyed a highly successful career as an ambassador and courtier years before his daughters caught the King&#x27;s eye. As Henry&#x27;s passion for Anne intensified, so did her father&#x27;s titles, though these rewards were not solely due to Anne but also Boleyn&#x27;s own merit. Henry pressured the main claimant to the earldom of Ormond, Piers Butler, to renounce all his claims to the titles in 1529. Piers Butler was rewarded by being created Earl of Ossory five days later.

Boleyn&#x27;s claims to the Earldom of Wiltshire also depended upon his Irish relatives. This time, he had to go back to his maternal great-grandfather, James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond, to establish a claim. While James Butler was indeed the 1st Earl of Wiltshire (of the third creation), on 1 May 1461 he lost his titles and his life when he was executed by the victorious Yorkists. The title was subsequently revived (in fourth and fifth creations) and bestowed on people unrelated to the Butlers of Ormond. This did not prevent the creation of the earldom for the 6th time. On 8 December 1529 Thomas Boleyn, Viscount Rochford, was created Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond.

Also on 8 December 1529, the Earl of Wiltshire&#x27;s only surviving son, George, was granted the courtesy title of Viscount Rochford. His title of Viscount, although initially a courtesy title, ceased to be a mere courtesy title sometime before 13 July 1530. On 17 May 1536, Lord Rochford was executed for treason, and all his titles were forfeited. His widow, Jane, Viscountess Rochford, however, continued to use the title after her husband&#x27;s death. Lady Rochford was herself attainted for treason and beheaded at Tower Green (not Tower Hill) within the Tower of London on 13 February 1542 with Henry VIII&#x27;s fifth wife, Queen Catherine Howard.

Boleyn was appointed Lord Privy Seal in 1530. In 1532, his daughter Anne was granted a peerage, being created Marquess of Pembroke in her own right, before marrying Henry the following year and becoming queen consort. Boleyn acquiesced in Anne&#x27;s judicial execution and that of her brother Lord Rochford when Henry discarded her in favour of his third wife, Queen Jane Seymour.

At this point Boleyn was replaced as Lord Privy Seal and left in disgrace until his death a few years later. He suffered a final indignity when the claims of Piers Butler to the Earldom of Ormond were recognized and he again became Earl of Ormond from 22 January 1538. There were two earls of Ormond in the Kingdom until his death on 12 March 1539.

==Death and burial==
He died at Hever Castle on 12 March 1539 and was buried in St. Peter&#x27;s Church, Hever, where survives his elaborate monumental brass. He is depicted dressed in full robes wearing the insignia of a Knight of the Garter, with the Badge on his left breast and the Garter around his left knee. His head rests on a helm surmounted by a crest of &quot;a falcon displayed&quot; (his daughter&#x27;s heraldic badge) and his feet rest on a griffin. The inscription reads: &quot;&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Thomas Boleyn has been portrayed by Sir Michael Hordern in &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; (1969), by Benjamin Whitrow in &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, and by Jack Shepherd and Mark Rylance in the 2003 and 2008 film versions of &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot;, respectively. The 2007 Showtime series &quot;The Tudors&quot; has Nick Dunning in the role depicting him as ambitious, cunning and devious, constantly working to curry favour for his family against everyone else and always willing to &quot;motivate&quot; his daughter, Anne, lest Henry lose interest in her. David Robb played Boleyn as a constantly furious, irascible schemer in &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;.

<text>A work made for hire (work for hire or WFH), in copyright law in the United States, is a work that is subject to copyright and is created by employees as part of their job or some limited types of works for which all parties agree in writing to the WFH designation. &quot;Work for hire&quot; is a statutorily defined term () and so a work for hire is not created merely because parties to an agreement state that the work is a work for hire. It is an exception to the general rule that the person who actually creates a work is the legally-recognized author of that work. In the United States and certain other copyright jurisdictions, if a work is &quot;made for hire&quot;, the employer, not the employee, is considered the legal author. In some countries, this is known as corporate authorship. The entity serving as an employer may be a corporation or other legal entity, an organization, or an individual.

==Author accreditation in the US ==
Accreditation has no impact on work for hire in the US. The actual creator may or may not be publicly credited for the work, and this credit does not affect its legal status. States that are party to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works recognize separately copyrights and moral rights, with moral rights including the right of the actual creators to publicly identify themselves as such, and to maintain the integrity of their work.

For example, Microsoft hired many programmers to develop the Windows operating system, which is credited simply to Microsoft Corporation. By contrast, Adobe Systems lists many of the developers of Photoshop in its credits. In both cases, the software is the property of the employing company. In both cases, the actual creators have moral rights. Similarly, newspapers routinely credit news articles written by their staff, and publishers credit the writers and illustrators who produce comic books featuring characters such as Batman or Spider-Man, but the publishers hold copyrights to the work. However, articles published in academic journals, or work produced by freelancers for magazines, are not generally works created as a work for hire, which is why it is common for the publisher to require the copyright owner, the author, to sign a &quot;copyright transfer&quot;, a short legal document transferring specific author copyrights to the publisher. In this case the authors retain those copyrights in their work not granted to the publisher.

==Law in the United States==
The circumstances in which a work is considered a &quot;work made for hire&quot; is determined by the United States Copyright Act of 1976 as either

The first situation applies only when the work&#x27;s creator is an employee, not an independent contractor. The determination of whether an individual is an employee for the purposes of the work made for hire doctrine is determined under the common law of agency, in which a court looks to a multitude of factors to determine whether an employer-employee relationship exists. In the Supreme Court case affirming that the common law of agency should be used to distinguish employees from independent contractors in the work for hire context, &quot;Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid&quot;, the Court listed some of these factors: 
In determining whether a hired party is an employee under the general common law of agency, we consider the hiring party&#x27;s right to control the manner and means by which the product is accomplished. Among the other factors relevant to this inquiry are the skill required; the source of the instrumentalities and tools; the location of the work; the duration of the relationship between the parties; whether the hiring party has the right to assign additional projects to the hired party; the extent of the hired party&#x27;s discretion over when and how long to work; the method of payment; the hired party&#x27;s role in hiring and paying assistants; whether the hiring party is in business; the provision of employee benefits; and the tax treatment of the hired party. &quot;See&quot; Restatement § 220(2) (setting forth a non-exhaustive list of factors relevant to determining whether a hired party is an employee).
On the other hand, if the work is created by an independent contractor or freelancer, the work may be considered a work for hire &quot;only&quot; if all of the following conditions are met:
* the work must come within one of the nine limited categories of works listed in the definition above, namely (1) a contribution to a collective work, (2) a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, (3) a translation, (4) a supplementary work, (5) a compilation, (6) an instructional text, (7) a test, (8) answer material for a test, (9) an atlas;
* the work must be specially ordered or commissioned;
* there must be a written agreement between the parties specifying that the work is a work made for hire by use of the phrase &quot;work for hire&quot; or &quot;work made for hire.&quot;

In other words, mutual agreement that a work is a work for hire is not enough. Any agreement not meeting all of the above criteria is not a valid work for hire agreement and all rights to the work will remain with the creator. Further, courts have held that the agreement must be negotiated, though not signed, before the work begins. 

According to case law, retroactive contractual designation as a work for hire is not permitted. Furthermore, a valid work-made-for-hire agreement must be signed by &quot;both&quot; parties (the creator of the work and the commissioning party who is to be considered the author). 

When relying on agreements in which creators transfer rights to a hiring party (copyright transfer agreement), a hiring party often finds that it has only limited scope to alter, update, or transform the work. For example, a motion picture may hire dozens of creators of copyrightable works (e.g., music scores, scripts, sets, sound effects, costumes) any one of which would require repeated agreements with the creators if conditions for showing the film or creating derivatives of it changed. Failing to reach agreement with any one creator could prevent the showing of the film entirely. To avoid this scenario, producers of motion pictures and similar works require that all contributions by non-employees be works made for hire.

On the other hand, a work for hire agreement is less desirable for creators than a copyright transfer agreement. Under work for hire, the commissioning party owns all rights from the very start even if the contract is breached, whereas under a transfer of rights, the creator can hold back the rights until all terms of the contract are fulfilled. Holding back the rights can be a forceful tool when it is necessary to compel a commissioning party to fulfill its obligations.

An author has the inalienable right to terminate a copyright transfer 35 years after agreeing to permanently relinquish the copyright. However, according to the US Copyright Office, Circular 9 &quot;the termination provisions of the law do not apply to works made for hire.&quot; These restrictions, in both the work for hire doctrine and the right of termination, exist out of recognition that artists frequently face unequal bargaining power in their business dealings. Nonetheless, failure to secure a work-for-hire agreement by commissioning organizations can create difficult situations. One such example is the artist Raymond Kaskey&#x27;s 1985 statue &quot;Portlandia&quot;, an iconic symbol of the city of Portland, Oregon. Unlike most works of public art, Kaskey has put strong prohibitions on the use of images of the statue, located atop the main entrance to the famous Portland Building. He sued Paramount Pictures for including shots of the statue in the Madonna motion picture &quot;Body of Evidence&quot;. As a result, it is nearly impossible to film portions of one of downtown Portland&#x27;s most vibrant neighborhoods, and the city has lost out on the potential to create merchandise and souvenirs from one of its most iconic landmarks.

An author can grant his or her copyright (if any) to the hiring party. However, if not a work made for hire, the author or the author&#x27;s heirs may exercise their right to terminate the grant. Termination of a grant cannot be effective until 35 years after the execution of the grant or, if the grant covers the right of publication, no earlier than 40 years after the execution of the grant or 35 years after publication under the grant (whichever comes first).

The application of the law to materials such as lectures, textbooks, and academic articles produced by teachers is somewhat unclear. The near-universal practice in education has traditionally been to act on the assumption that they were &quot;not&quot; work for hire.

Where start-up technology companies are concerned, some courts have considered that the traditional factors for finding that an author is an &quot;employee&quot; can be less important than in more-established companies, for example if the employee works remotely and is not directly supervised, or if the employee is paid entirely in equity without benefits or tax withholding.

===Amendment covering sound recordings===
In 1999, a work for hire related amendment was inserted into the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999. It specified that sound recordings from musical artists could be categorized as works for hire from the recording studios.

===Employer–employee relationship under agency law===
If a work is created by an employee, part 1 of the copyright code&#x27;s definition of a work made for hire applies. To help determine who is an employee, the Supreme Court in
&quot;CCNV v. Reid&quot; identified certain factors that characterize an &quot;employer-employee&quot; relationship as defined by agency law:

# Control by the employer over the work (e.g., the employer may determine how the work is done, has the work done at the employer&#x27;s location, and provides equipment or other means to create work)
# Control by employer over the employee (e.g., the employer controls the employee&#x27;s schedule in creating work, has the right to have the employee perform other assignments, determines the method of payment, and/or has the right to hire the employee&#x27;s assistants)
# Status and conduct of employer (e.g., the employer is in business to produce such works, provides the employee with benefits, and/or withholds tax from the employee&#x27;s payment)

==Copyright duration==

===United States===
In the United States a &quot;work for hire&quot; (published after 1978) receives copyright protection until 120 years after creation or 95 years after publication, whichever comes first. This differs from the standard U.S. copyright term, life of the author plus 70 years, because the &quot;author&quot; of a work for hire is often not an actual person, in which case the standard term would be unlimited, which is unconstitutional. Works published prior to 1978 have no differentiation in copyright term between works made for hire and works with recognized individual creators.

===European Union===
In the European Union, even if a Member State provides for the possibility of a legal person to be the original rightholder, then the duration of protection is in general the same as the copyright term for a personal copyright: i.e., for a literary or artistic work, 70 years from the death of the human author, or in the case of works of joint authorship, 70 years from the death of the last surviving author. If the natural author or authors are not identified, nor become known subsequently, then the copyright term is the same as that for an anonymous or pseudonymous work, i.e. 70 years from publication for a literary or artistic work; or, if the work has not been published in that time, 70 years from creation. (Copyright durations for works created before 1993 may be subject to transitional arrangements.)

An exception is for scientific or critical editions of works in the public domain. Per article 70 of the German copyright law, editions as the result of scholarly or scientific analysis have a copyright length of 25 years. Therefore, the editor of an urtext score of an opera by Beethoven would only receive 25 years of protection,

<text>A time control is a mechanism in the tournament play of almost all two-player board games so that each round of the match can finish in a timely way and the tournament can proceed.

For turn-based games such as chess, shogi or go, time controls are typically enforced by means of a game clock, which counts time spent on each player&#x27;s turn separately. A player that spends more time than the time control allows is penalized, usually by the loss of the game. Time pressure (or time trouble or &quot;Zeitnot&quot;) is the situation where one player has very little time on their clock to complete their remaining moves.

==Classification==
The amount of time given to each player to complete their moves will vary from game to game. However, most games tend to change the classification of tournaments according to the length of time given to the players. 

In chess, various classification schemes are used. FIDE defines time controls based on the sum of the amount of time alloted to each player, plus the increment per move times 60. Any time control in which this sum is more than 60 minutes (120 minutes at the master level) is classical; any time control in which the sum is less than 60 but more than 10 minutes is rapid; any time control with a sum at or less than 10 minutes is blitz. However, both Lichess and Chess.com consider 10 minute games to be rapid rather than blitz. In addition, both sites have a separate bullet category for games in which less than 3 minutes are given to each player; Lichess additionally has hyperbullet (≤30s) and ultrabullet (≤15s) categories.
In Go, anything under twenty minutes could be considered &quot;blitz&quot;.

==Methodology==
The exact approach to using a game clock to regulate games varies considerably.

===Sudden death===
This is the simplest methodology. Each player is assigned a fixed amount of time for the whole game. If a player&#x27;s main time expires, they generally lose the game.

===Overtime formats===
Here the game time is separated into two basic domains: the main time and the overtime. To switch between the two requires some trigger event, often the expiration of the main time. In chess, reaching a fixed number of moves can trigger the gain of a fixed amount of extra time. This usually occurs in long games after the 40th move: e.g. 120 minutes to complete the first 40 moves, and another 30 minutes added to the leftover 120 minutes to complete the rest of the game.

===Penalty formats===
Such methods exact a points penalty, or fine, on the player who breaches their time limit. One example occurs in Go, where the Ing Rules enforce fines on breaches of main time and overtime periods. The rules may also provide for a sudden death time control in addition to the penalty. In tournament Scrabble, the time control is standardized to 25 minutes per side with a 10-point penalty for each minute or part thereof that is used in excess, so that overstepping the allotted time by 61 seconds carries a 20-point penalty; a player who oversteps by 10 minutes automatically loses; in this case, their opponent is given enough additional points to win by one point, if they were not already in the lead at that time.

===Hourglass===
Each player&#x27;s clock starts with a specified time (such as one minute or ten minutes). While one player is deciding a move, their clock time decreases and their opponent&#x27;s clock time increases. This is analogous to an hourglass: sand empties from one container and fills the other. The sum of both clocks always remains the same, and slow moves give extra time to the opponent. There is no maximum amount of time allotted for a game with this timing method; if both players play quickly enough, the game will continue until its natural end.

Use of this time control is uncommon.

== Game formats ==

=== Go ===

==== Byo-yomi ==== 
This timing method is also used in shogi. The word is borrowed from Japanese; the term literally means &quot;counting the seconds&quot;, or more generally, &quot;countdown&quot;.

After the main time is depleted, a player has a certain number of periods (for example five periods, each of thirty seconds). If a move is completed before the time expires, the time period resets and restarts the next turn. If a move is not completed within a time period, the time period will expire, and the next time period begins. This is written as + of . Using up the last period means that the player has &quot;lost on time&quot;. In some systems, such as certain Go title matches, there is no main time; instead, the time used is rounded &quot;up&quot; to the nearest whole increment, such as one minute, and the actual counting of time occurs toward the end of one player&#x27;s time.

A typical time control is &quot;60 minutes + 30 seconds byo-yomi&quot;, which means that each player may make as many or as few moves as they choose during their first 60 minutes of thinking time, but after the hour is exhausted, they must make each move in thirty seconds or less. To enforce byo-yomi, a third person or a game clock with a byo-yomi option is necessary.

In professional Go games and many amateur tournaments, a player has several byo-yomi periods, for example five periods of one minute each. If a player makes their move within a one-minute period, they retain all five periods for their future moves. If a player oversteps one minute, they start the following move in the second rather than the first byo-yomi period. In effect, the player has one minute per move plus four extra one-minute packets which may be used as needed, e.g. four moves of two minutes each, or one move of five minutes, or any other combination.

In higher-level tournaments, such as the Kisei tournament, the player&#x27;s time is often composed entirely of byo-yomi periods (for example, in an eight-hour game, the player may have 480 periods of one minute each), rather than having a main block of thinking time. In this case, the actual counting of time (verbally) begins once the player falls below a certain threshold of time, such as 10 minutes; when the time is being counted, the player is informed at intervals how much time they have used in their current period, and how many extra periods they have left. (For example, the time may be called at 10-second intervals, and when 55 and 58 seconds have been used; during a player&#x27;s final minute, the last 10 seconds are counted one by one.) Similarly, in the televised NHK Cup tournament, the player has 30 seconds per move plus 10 extra one-minute periods which may be used as needed.

When analog game clocks are used to enforce byo-yomi, it is more convenient to assign additional time for a block of moves, rather than for each move. In &quot;Canadian byo-yomi&quot;, a player typically gets 5 minutes for 10 to 20 moves. The IGS Go server uses a similar system, but the byo-yomi time is variable and always covers 25 moves. Thus the time control &quot;20 minutes + 15 minutes byoyomi&quot; on IGS means that after the initial 20 minutes of thinking time are over, a player is granted 15 additional minutes, which may be spent however they choose. If these minutes expire before they have made 25 more moves, they lose. If they make 25 more moves in less than 15 minutes, they are granted another 15 minutes of byo-yomi, and so on indefinitely.

Canadian byo-yomi imposes a certain average speed of play, but allows the player to spend more time to ponder on difficult moves. Several byo-yomi periods in one move per period variant (also known as &quot;Japanese byo-yomi&quot;) serve essentially the same purpose, albeit to a lesser extent.

Unused time during one byo-yomi period does not carry forward to future moves. This is in contrast to the Fischer clock often used in chess, with designations such as &quot;5 minutes + 12 seconds per move&quot;. Under this time control each player has twelve seconds added to their clock after every move, starting from the first move, regardless of how much time they spend on each move. Thus if a player thinks for eight seconds before making their first move, they will have five minutes and four seconds on their clock after making it.

==== Canadian overtime ====
After using all of their main time, a player must make a certain number of moves within a certain period of time — for example, twenty moves within five minutes. In Go, players stop the clock, and the player in overtime counts out the required number of stones and sets the remaining stones out of reach so as not to become confused, whilst the opponent sets the clock to the overtime period. If all the moves are made in time, then another period of overtime starts — another set of stones and the timer again reset to the overtime period. If all the moves are not made in time, the player has &quot;lost on time&quot;. This is written as + in . In Progressive Canadian Overtime the required rate of play alters in additional overtime periods — eg. 1 hour + 10 in 5, 20 in 5, 30 in 5, 40 in 5 etc.

===Chess===
==== Increment and delay methods ====
These are the timing methods most often used in chess.

In increment (also known as bonus and Fischer, after Bobby Fischer&#x27;s patent on it), a specified amount of time is added to the player&#x27;s main time after each move, unless the player&#x27;s main time ran out before they completed their move. For example, if the time control is &quot;G/90;inc30&quot; (90 minutes of main time per player, with a 30-second increment each move), each player gets an additional 30 seconds added to their main time after each move, unless the player&#x27;s main time ran out first. This is often notated as a &quot;90+30&quot; time control, with the first number indicating the minutes on the clock at the start of the game, followed by the number of seconds added to the clock per move.

Under FIDE and US Chess rules, each player gets the increment for the first move as well. For example, with &quot;G/3;inc2&quot;, each player starts with three minutes and two seconds on the first move. Not all digital chess clocks automatically give the increment for the first move; for those that don&#x27;t, the increment time has to be added manually.

==== Simple delay ====
In the simple delay (also known as the US delay), the clock waits for a fixed delay period during each move before the player&#x27;s main time starts counting down. For example, if the delay is ten seconds, the clock waits for ten seconds each move before the main time starts counting down.

==== Bronstein delay ====
The Bronstein delay (named after David Bronstein, its inventor), like increment, adds a fixed amount of time after each move, but no more than the amount of time spent to make the move. For example, if the delay is ten seconds and a player uses ten or more seconds for a move, ten seconds are added after they complete their move. If the player uses five seconds, only those five seconds are returned to the clock. This ensures that the main time left on the clock can never increase even if a player makes fast moves. As with increment, under FIDE and US Chess rules, the delay time is applied to the first move.

Bronstein delay and Simple delay are very similar, but not equal. In Bronstein delay the amount of time is added &quot;after&quot; the move has been made; this distinction may be crucial when a player is running out of time. The advantage of the Bronstein delay is that the player can easily see how much time is remaining without mentally adding the delay to the main clock. The advantage of the simple delay is that the player can always tell whether the delay time or the main time is counting down. The simple delay is the form of delay most often used in the United States, while the Bronstein delay is more often used in most other countries.

== Other uses ==
Time control has also been utilised in some game shows:

* &quot;Grand Slam&quot; uses the classic sudden death format for each round of questioning. Each duel between two players consists of four rounds, and each player is allotted one minute on their clock for each of the first three rounds. The winner of each round has their remaining time added to their clock in the final round, which also starts at one minute (or 30 seconds in the original British version).
* Likewise, the head-to-head round of &quot;Beat the Chasers&quot;, the primetime spin-off of &quot;The Chase&quot;, pits one minute for each of the player&#x27;s and the chasers&#x27; clocks. However, before the showdown, the player is presented with a list of choices about the number of chasers to face, with their respective cash prizes and time advantages (which would be subtracted from the chasers&#x27; clock).
* &quot;Family Game Night&quot; includes a mini-game based on the dexterity game &quot;Jenga&quot; in its last two seasons. The rules are similar to the normal counterpart, except each of the two participating teams (of two players each) has 2 minutes on their clock. On each team&#x27;s turn, a third member would draw out a number (from 0 to 3), and the two playing members must take turns pulling out and stacking as many blocks as required by the number, then stop the clock to end their turn by hitting a button. The first team to make the tower fall or run out of time loses. A rule violation applies a 5-second time penalty.

<doc id="72173" wikidata="Q314325" url="?curid=72173" title="Thomas Wyatt (poet)">
<text>Sir Thomas Wyatt (150311 October 1542) was a 16th-century English politician, ambassador, and lyric poet credited with introducing the sonnet to English literature. He was born at Allington Castle near Maidstone in Kent, though the family was originally from Yorkshire. His family adopted the Lancastrian side in the Wars of the Roses. His mother was Anne Skinner, and his father Henry, who had earlier been imprisoned and tortured by Richard III, had been a Privy Councillor of Henry VII and remained a trusted adviser when Henry VIII ascended the throne in 1509.

Thomas followed his father to court after his education at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Entering the King&#x27;s service, he was entrusted with many important diplomatic missions. In public life, his principal patron was Thomas Cromwell, after whose death he was recalled from abroad and imprisoned (1541). Though subsequently acquitted and released, shortly thereafter he died. His poems were circulated at court and may have been published anonymously in the anthology &quot;The Court of Venus&quot; (earliest edition c. 1537) during his lifetime, but were not published under his name until after his death; the first major book to feature and attribute his verse was &quot;Tottel&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; (1557), printed 15 years after his death.

==Early life==
Thomas Wyatt was born at Allington, Kent, in 1503, the son of Sir Henry Wyatt and Anne Skinner, the daughter of John Skinner of Reigate, Surrey. He had a brother Henry, assumed to have died an infant, and a sister, Margaret who married Sir Anthony Lee
(died 1549) and was the mother of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s champion, Sir Henry Lee.

===Education and diplomatic career===
Wyatt was over six feet tall, reportedly both handsome and physically strong. In 1515, Wyatt entered Henry&#x27;s service as &#x27;Sewer Extraordinary&#x27; and the same year he began studying at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. His father had been associated with Sir Thomas Boleyn as constable of Norwich Castle, and Wyatt was thus acquainted with Anne Boleyn.

Following a diplomatic mission to Spain, in 1526, he accompanied Sir John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, to Rome to help petition Pope Clement VII to annul Henry VIII&#x27;s marriage to Catherine of Aragon, in hopes of freeing him to marry Anne Boleyn. Russell being incapacitated, Wyatt was also sent to negotiate with the Republic of Venice. According to some, Wyatt was captured by the armies of Emperor Charles V when they captured Rome and imprisoned the pope in 1527, but he managed to escape and make it back to England.

From 1528 to 1530, Wyatt acted as high marshal at Calais. In the years following he continued in Henry&#x27;s service; he was, however, imprisoned in the Tower of London for a month in 1536, perhaps because Henry hoped he would incriminate the queen. He was knighted in 1535 and appointed High Sheriff of Kent for 1536. At this time, he was sent to Spain as ambassador to Charles V, who was offended by the declaration of Princess Mary&#x27;s illegitimacy; he was her cousin and they had once been briefly betrothed. Although Wyatt was unsuccessful in his endeavours, and was accused of disloyalty by some of his colleagues, he was protected by his relationship with Cromwell, at least during the latter&#x27;s lifetime.

Wyatt was elected knight of the shire (MP) for Kent in December 1541.

===Marriage and issue===
In 1520, Wyatt married Elizabeth Brooke (1503–1560). A year later, they had a son Thomas (1521–1554) who led Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion some 12 years after his father&#x27;s death. In 1524, Henry VIII assigned Wyatt to be an ambassador at home and abroad, and he separated from his wife soon after on grounds of adultery.

== Wyatt&#x27;s poetry and influence ==
Wyatt&#x27;s professed object was to experiment with the English language, to civilise it, to raise its powers to equal those of other European languages. His poetry may be considered as a part of the Petrarchism movement within Renaissance literature. A significant amount of his literary output consists of translations and imitations of sonnets by Italian poet Petrarch; he also wrote sonnets of his own. He took subject matter from Petrarch&#x27;s sonnets, but his rhyme schemes are significantly different. Petrarch&#x27;s sonnets consist of an &quot;octave&quot; rhyming &quot;abba abba&quot;, followed by a &quot;sestet&quot; with various rhyme schemes. Wyatt employs the Petrarchan octave, but his most common sestet scheme is &quot;cddc ee&quot;. Wyatt experimented in stanza forms including the rondeau, epigrams, terza rima, ottava rima songs, and satires, as well as with monorime, triplets with refrains, quatrains with different length of line and rhyme schemes, quatrains with codas, and the French forms of douzaine and treizaine. He introduced the &quot;poulter&#x27;s measure&quot; form, rhyming couplets composed of a 12-syllable iambic line (Alexandrine) followed by a 14-syllable iambic line (fourteener), and he is considered a master of the iambic tetrameter.

Wyatt&#x27;s poetry reflects classical and Italian models, but he also admired the work of Geoffrey Chaucer, and his vocabulary reflects that of Chaucer; for example, he uses Chaucer&#x27;s word &quot;newfangleness&quot;, meaning fickleness, in &quot;They Flee from Me&quot;. Many of his poems deal with the trials of romantic love and the devotion of the suitor to an unavailable or cruel mistress. Other poems are scathing, satirical indictments of the hypocrisies and pandering required of courtiers who are ambitious to advance at the Tudor court.

Wyatt&#x27;s poems are short but fairly numerous. His 96 love poems appeared posthumously (1557) in a compendium called &quot;Tottel&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;. The noteworthy are 31 sonnets, the first in English. Ten of them were translations from Petrarch, while all were written in the Petrarchan form, apart from the couplet ending which Wyatt introduced. Serious and reflective in tone, the sonnets show some stiffness of construction and a metrical uncertainty indicative of the difficulty Wyatt found in the new form. Yet their conciseness represents a great advance on the prolixity and uncouthness of much earlier poetry. Wyatt was also responsible for the important introduction of the personal note into English poetry, for although he followed his models closely, he wrote of his own experiences. His epigrams, songs, and rondeaux are lighter than the sonnets, and they reveal the care and the elegance typical of the new romanticism. His satires are composed in the Italian terza rima, again showing the direction of the innovating tendencies.

=== Attribution ===
The Egerton Manuscript is an album containing Wyatt&#x27;s personal selection of his poems and translations which preserves 123 texts, partly in his handwriting. Tottel&#x27;s Miscellany (1557) is the Elizabethan anthology which created Wyatt&#x27;s posthumous reputation; it ascribes 96 poems to him, 33 not in the Egerton Manuscript. These 156 poems can be ascribed to Wyatt with certainty on the basis of objective evidence. Another 129 poems have been ascribed to him purely on the basis of subjective editorial judgment. They are mostly derived from the Devonshire Manuscript Collection and the Blage manuscript. Rebholz comments in his preface to &quot;Sir Thomas Wyatt, The Complete Poems&quot;, &quot;The problem of determining which poems Wyatt wrote is as yet unsolved&quot;. However, a solution was already at hand and is now in place. Rebholz adopted the canon of 285 poems ascribed to Wyatt in his edition wholesale from the 1969 edition by Kenneth Muir and Patricia Thomson. This was the third edition of Wyatt issued by Muir (the first in 1949, the second in 1963), to each of which he added scores of poems derived principally from the several hundred anonymous poems included in the Devonshire Manuscript and then the newly discovered Blage Manuscript – poems ascribed to Wyatt on no other basis than Muir’s own judgment or whim. Already in the early 1970s Joost Daalder produced an edition (Oxford 1975) which attempts and partly succeeds in renovating the Wyatt canon to accord with documentary facts, and also in that year Richard Harrier published his magisterial philological study of the manuscript evidence, &quot;The Canon of Sir Thomas Wyatt’s Poetry&quot; (Harvard University Press 1975). On the basis of a meticulous scientific study of the documentary evidence Harrier establishes a fact-based canon of Wyatt’s poems. Later studies by other scholars (Helen Baron, 1989 and 1994, and Jason Powell, 2009) confirm the outlines and tenor of Harrier’s analysis. On the basis of Harrier’s analysis, 101 of the 285 poems included in Rebholz’s edition are demonstrated to be not Wyatt’s work. Harrier&#x27;s researches establish that another 33 poems from other sources (besides The Egerton Manuscript and Tottel&#x27;s) can be ascribed to Wyatt on the basis of solid documentary evidence and plausible editorial judgment. A new edition of Wyatt’s poetry reflecting these established facts is needed.

=== Assessment ===
Critical opinions have varied widely regarding Wyatt&#x27;s work. Eighteenth-century critic Thomas Warton considered Wyatt &quot;confessedly an inferior&quot; to his contemporary Henry Howard, and felt that Wyatt&#x27;s &quot;genius was of the moral and didactic species&quot; but deemed him &quot;the first polished English satirist&quot;. The 20th century saw an awakening in his popularity and a surge in critical attention. His poems were found praiseworthy by numerous poets, including Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, John Berryman, Yvor Winters, Basil Bunting, Louis Zukofsky and George Oppen. C. S. Lewis called him &quot;the father of the Drab Age&quot; (i.e. the unornate), from what he calls the &quot;golden&quot; age of the 16th century. Patricia Thomson describes Wyatt as &quot;the Father of English Poetry&quot;.

== Rumoured affair with Anne Boleyn ==

Many have conjectured that Wyatt fell in love with Anne Boleyn in the early- to mid-1520s. Their acquaintance is certain, but it is not certain whether the two shared a romantic relationship. George Gilfillan implies that Wyatt and Boleyn were romantically involved. In his verse, Wyatt calls his mistress Anna and might allude to events in her life:

&quot;&lt;poem&gt;And now I follow the coals that be quent,
From Dover to Calais against my mind&lt;/poem&gt;&quot;

Gilfillan argues that these lines could refer to Anne&#x27;s trip to France in 1532 prior to her marriage to Henry VIII and could imply that Wyatt was present, although his name is not included among those who accompanied the royal party to France. Wyatt&#x27;s sonnet &quot;Whoso List To Hunt&quot; may also allude to Anne&#x27;s relationship with the King:

&quot;&lt;poem&gt;Graven in diamonds with letters plain,
There is written her fair neck round about,
&quot;Noli me tangere [Do not touch me], for Caesar&#x27;s I am&quot;.&lt;/poem&gt;&quot;

In still plainer terms, Wyatt&#x27;s late sonnet &quot;If waker care&quot; describes his first &quot;love&quot; for &quot;Brunette that set our country in a roar&quot;—presumably Boleyn.

Wyatt&#x27;s grandson George Wyatt included in his &quot;Life of Queen Anne Boleigne&quot; a story that Thomas Wyatt obtained a jewel belonging to Anne, and that Henry VIII heard of this. The jewel was loose &quot;hanging by a lace out of her pocket&quot;, a &quot;tablet&quot; (a kind of locket) which Wyatt took to wear at his neck. Henry VIII recognised the jewel when he played bowls with Wyatt. Anne said that Wyatt had obtained the jewel without her permission. However, the details of the story seem incompatible with courtly behaviour and are unconvincing.

== Imprisonment on charges of adultery ==
In May 1536, Wyatt was imprisoned in the Tower of London for allegedly committing adultery with Anne Boleyn. He was released later that year thanks to his friendship or his father&#x27;s friendship with Thomas Cromwell, and he returned to his duties. During his stay in the Tower, he may have witnessed Anne Boleyn&#x27;s execution (which took place on 19 May 1536) from his cell window, as well as the executions of the five men with whom she was accused of adultery; he wrote a poem which might have been inspired by that experience.

Around 1537, Elizabeth Darrell was Thomas&#x27;s mistress, a former maid of honour to Catherine of Aragon. She bore Wyatt three sons. 

By 1540, he was again in the king&#x27;s favour, as he was granted the site and many of the manorial estates of the dissolved Boxley Abbey. However, he was charged once more with treason in 1541; the charges were again lifted, but only thanks to the intervention of Queen Catherine Howard and on the condition of reconciling with his wife. He was granted a full pardon and restored once again to his duties as ambassador. After the execution of Catherine Howard, there were rumours that Wyatt&#x27;s wife Elizabeth was a possibility to become Henry VIII&#x27;s next wife despite the fact that she was still married to Wyatt. He became ill not long after and died on 11 October 1542 around age 39. He is buried in Sherborne Abbey.

== Descendants and relatives ==
Long after Wyatt&#x27;s death, his only legitimate son Sir Thomas Wyatt the Younger led a thwarted rebellion against Henry&#x27;s daughter Mary I, for which he was executed. The rebellion&#x27;s aim was to set on the throne the Protestant-minded Elizabeth, the daughter of Anne Boleyn. Wyatt was an ancestor of Wallis Simpson, wife of the Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII. Thomas Wyatt&#x27;s great-grandson was Virginia Colony governor Sir Francis Wyatt.

<text>In grammar, the locative case ( ; abbreviated ) is a grammatical case which indicates a location. In languages using it, the locative case may perform a function which in English would be expressed with such prepositions as &quot;in&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;at&quot;, and &quot;by&quot;. The locative case belongs to the general local cases, together with the lative and ablative case.

The locative case exists in many language groups.

==Indo-European languages==
The Proto-Indo-European language had a locative case expressing &quot;place where&quot;, an adverbial function. The endings are reconstructed as follows:
In most later Indo-European languages, the locative case merged into other cases (often genitive or dative) in form and/or function, but some daughter languages retained it as a distinct case. It is found in:
* modern Balto-Slavic languages, except Bulgarian and Macedonian, although it is mostly used with prepositions in the other Slavic languages
* some classical Indo-European languages, particularly Sanskrit and Old Latin
* (Mostly uncommon, archaic or literary) use in certain modern Indic languages (such as Bangla and Marathi—in which, however, a separate ablative case has disappeared)

===Latin===
Old Latin still had a functioning locative singular, which descended from the Proto-Indo-European form. The locative plural was already identical to the dative and ablative plural. In Classical Latin, changes to the Old Latin diphthongs caused the originally-distinctive ending of the locative singular to become indistinguishable from the endings of some other cases.

Because the locative was already identical to the ablative (which had a &quot;location&quot; meaning as well) in the plural, the loss of distinction between the endings eventually caused the functions of the locative case to be absorbed by the ablative case in Classical Latin. The original locative singular ending, descended from the Old Latin form, remained in use for a few words. For first and second declension, it was identical to the genitive singular form. In archaic times, the locative singular of third declension nouns was still interchangeable between ablative and dative forms, but in the Augustan Period the use of the ablative form became fixed. Therefore, both forms and may be encountered.

The Latin locative case was only used for the names of cities, &quot;small&quot; islands and a few other isolated words. The Romans considered all Mediterranean islands to be small except for Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Crete, and Cyprus. Britannia was also considered to be a &quot;large island&quot;. There are a few nouns that use the locative instead of a preposition: becomes (at home), becomes (in the country), becomes (on the ground), becomes (in military service, in the field), and &quot;focus&quot; becomes &quot;focī&quot; (at the hearth; at the center of the community).

The first declension locative is by far the most common, because so many Roman place names were first declension, such as , Rome, and therefore use the same form as the genitive and dative: , at Rome, and , in Ireland. A few place-names were inherently plural, even though they are a single city, e.g. , Athens and , Cuma. These plural names also use the form similar to the dative and ablative: , at Athens, and , at Cumae. There are also a number of second declension names that could have locatives, e.g. , Brindisi; , York; with locatives , at Brindisi; , at York. The locative cannot express being located at multiple locations; plural forms only exist because certain proper names such as happen to be plural. &quot;He is at home&quot; can be expressed by &quot;&quot; using the locative, but &quot;They are at their (individual and separate) homes&quot; cannot be expressed by the locative.

===Greek===
In Ancient Greek, the locative merged with the Proto-Indo-European dative, so that the Greek dative represents the Proto-Indo-European dative, instrumental, and locative. The dative with the preposition ἐν &quot;en&quot; &quot;in&quot; and the dative of time (e.g., , , which means &quot;on the third day&quot;) are examples of locative datives. Some early texts, in particular Homer, retain the locative in some words (for example , – at dawn, &quot;Iliad&quot; 24.401).

=== Germanic languages ===
The locative case had merged with the dative in early Germanic times and was no longer distinct in Proto-Germanic or in any of its descendants. The dative, however, contrasts with the accusative case, which is used to indicate motion toward a place (it has an allative meaning). The difference in meaning between dative and accusative exists in all of the old Germanic languages and survives in all Germanic languages that retain a distinction between the two cases.

=== Sanskrit ===
The locative case in Sanskrit is usually known as the &quot;seventh case&quot; (). It is the last out of the main seven cases () in the language. Along with &quot;in&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;at&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, and &quot;by&quot;, the locative case is also generally used with &quot;among&quot; in Sanskrit.

===Slavic languages===
Among Slavic languages, the locative is mostly used after a fixed set of commonly used prepositions. Besides location, Slavic languages also employ locative as a way of expressing the method of doing an action, time when the action is to take place, as well as the topic or theme that something describes in more detail; as such it is subordinate to other cases. The locative is kept in all Slavic languages (except for Bulgarian and Macedonian), although Russian split it (in the singular of a group of masculine nouns) into locative and prepositional, and Serbo-Croatian uses almost the same set of endings (sometimes with different intonation) as for the dative. The ending depends on whether the word is a noun or an adjective (among other factors).

====Old Slavic====
In Old Church Slavonic, the locative is mostly used with a preposition. Some uses of independent locatives remain, mostly in expressions of time, such as &quot;in winter&quot;, &quot;at midnight&quot;. The locative also occurs as the complement of a handful of verbs, such as &quot;who touched my garments?&quot;. In Old East Slavic, moreover, place names are regularly used in the locative without a preposition.

====Czech====
The Czech language uses the locative case to denote location (, &#x27;in the Czech Republic&#x27;), but as in the Russian language, the locative case may be used after certain prepositions with meanings other than location (, &#x27;about Prague&#x27;, , &#x27;after the revolution&#x27;). Cases other than the locative may be used to denote location in Czech as well (, &#x27;at Robert&#x27;s house&#x27; -genitive, or , &#x27;above the table&#x27; -instrumental).

The locative case (commonly called the 6th case) is the only one of the 7 Czech cases which cannot be used without a preposition. It is used with these prepositions:
* ( = in the room, = in Prague). Using this preposition with the accusative case has a different meaning ( = to the forest) and is regarded as archaic
* ( = on the desk, = it depends on you). The use of this preposition with the accusative case has a different meaning ( = to the desk).
* (in different meanings: past, after, on, to, for, by). This preposition takes the accusative case in some meanings.
* (by, nearby, with)
* (about, of, on, for, at, during, by, with, over, against, using). This preposition with the accusative case has a different use and meaning ().

If the preposition uses both accusative and locative case, the accusative is used for direction (where to) while locative for pure location (where). In case of the preposition (about), this distinction can be very subtle and untranslatable, or depending on the controlling verb.

The locative form of substantives in the singular is mostly identical with the dative case (3rd case). Possible endings for locative case:
* -u (hard masculines: , hard neuters: )
* -i (soft masculines: , some neuters: , some feminines: )
* -ovi (animate masculines: )
* -e ()
* -ě ()
* -eti ()
* -í ()

For adjectives and adjectival substantives:
* -ém (-ým or -ym in Common Czech) for hard masculine and neuter adjectives ()
* -m for soft masculine and neuter adjectives ()
* -é (-ý or -ej in Common Czech) for hard feminine adjectives ()
* -í for soft feminine adjectives ()

The locative form in the plural typically has the ending &quot;-ch&quot; (), the dual has ending -ou ().

See Czech declension for declension patterns for all Czech grammatical cases, including the locative.

====Slovak====
The Slovak language uses the locative case to denote location (, &#x27;in Slovakia&#x27;), but as in the Russian language, the locative case may be used after certain prepositions with meanings other than location (, &#x27;about Bratislava, , &#x27;after the revolution&#x27;). Cases other than the locative may be used to denote location in Slovak as well (, &#x27;at Milan&#x27;s house&#x27; -genitive, or , &#x27;above the table&#x27; -instrumental). A preposition must always be used with this case.

There are several different locative endings in Slovak:
* -e Used for singular nouns of all genders (except masculine animate), e.g. .
* -u Used for:
** Masculine inanimate singular nouns ending in a velar consonant, e.g. , or a glottal consonant, e.g. 
** All neuter singular nouns ending in &quot;-kV, -chV, -iV, -uV&quot; (V being &quot;o&quot; or &quot;um&quot;), e.g. 
* -i Used for:
** Masculine inanimate nouns ending in a soft consonant (&quot;c, č, ď, dz, dž, j, ľ, ň, š, ť, ž&quot;), e.g. (&quot;remote&quot;) → (&quot;about the remote&quot;), 
** Feminine nouns ending in a soft consonant or a soft consonant followed by &quot;a&quot;, e.g. , (&quot;bone&quot;) → (&quot;about bone&quot;)
** Feminine nouns ending in -ia or -ea, e.g. 
** Neuter nouns ending in -e or -, e.g. 
* -í used for neuter nouns ending in -, e.g. 
* -ovi used for masculine animate nouns, e.g. 
* -om used for masculine and neuter singular adjectives: 
* -ej used for feminine singular adjectives and feminine nouns ending in -á: 
* -m used for masculine animate nouns following the kuli pattern (being most names in -i, -y etc.), e.g. 
* -och used for masculine nouns in plural, e.g. 
* -ách used for plural feminine and neuter nouns, e.g. (&quot;women&quot;) → (&quot;about women&quot;). There are variations:
** -ach used when the preceding vowel is long or a diphthong (&quot;ia, ie, iu, ô&quot;), e.g. 
** -iach used after soft consonants, e.g. 
* -ích / -ých Used for plural adjectives of all genders, e.g. (&quot;small shops&quot;) → (&quot;in small shops&quot;), with the variation:
** -ich / -ych when the preceding vowel is long: (&quot;fast cars&quot;) → (&quot;about fast cars&quot;)

See also Slovak declension for declension patterns for all Slovak grammatical cases, including locative.

====Polish====
There are several different locative endings in Polish:
* -ie Used for singular nouns of all genders, e.g. . In a few cases, the softening indicated by has led to consonant alternations:
** 
** 
For a complete list, see .
* -u Used for:
** Some masculine singular nouns, e.g. [* In a few cases, a vowel change may occur, e.g. ó → o, or a vowel may be dropped. ** Final consonants in Wrocław and Bytom used to be soft, which is still reflected in suffixed forms, hence -i-.]
** All neuter singular nouns ending in , e.g. 
** Some neuter singular nouns ending in , e.g. 
* -i Used for:
** Feminine nouns ending in , e.g. (&quot;Katie&quot;) → (&quot;about Katie&quot;), (&quot;in Austria&quot;)
** Feminine nouns ending in , e.g. (&quot;love&quot;) → (&quot;about love&quot;)
* -im / -ym Used for masculine and neuter singular adjectives, e.g. (&quot;Polish language&quot;) → (&quot;in the Polish language&quot;)
* -ej Used for feminine singular adjectives, e.g. (&quot;big cow&quot;) → (&quot;about a big cow&quot;)

In plural:
* -ach Used for plural nouns of all genders, e.g. (&quot;women&quot;) → (&quot;about women&quot;)
* -ich / -ych Used for plural adjectives of all genders, e.g. (&quot;small shops&quot;) → (&quot;in small shops&quot;)

====Russian====
In the Russian language, the locative case has largely lost its use as an independent case and become the prepositional case, which is used only after a preposition. The latter is not always used to indicate location, while other cases may also be used to specify location (e.g. the genitive case, as in , (&quot;by the window&quot;)). Statements such as , (&quot;in the library&quot;) or , (&quot;in Alaska&quot;), demonstrate the use of the prepositional case to indicate location. However, this case is also used after the preposition &quot;о&quot; (&quot;about&quot;) as in , (&quot;about the student&quot;).

Nevertheless, approximately retain a distinct form for the locative case, used only after &quot;в&quot; and &quot;на&quot;. These forms end in &quot;-у́&quot; or &quot;-ю́&quot;: , (to lie in the snow), but , (to think about snow). Other examples are , (paradise); &quot;в раю́&quot;, , (smoke); and , . As indicated by the accent marks, the stress is always on the last syllable, which is unlike the dative-case forms with the same spelling. A few feminine nouns that end with the soft sign, such as дверь and пыль, also have a locative form that differs from the prepositional in that the stress shifts to the final syllable: , (&quot;on the door&quot;), but , (&quot;by the door&quot;). These distinct feminine forms are sometimes referenced as &quot;second locative&quot; or &quot;new locative&quot;, because they developed independently from the true locative case, which existed in Old Russian.

With some words, such as , (house), the second locative form is used only in certain idiomatic expressions, while the prepositional is used elsewhere. For example, , (&quot;at the house&quot; or &quot;at home&quot;) would be used to describe activity that is performed at home, while (&quot;on the house&quot;) would be used to specify the location of the roof.

====Ukrainian====
The Ukrainian language uses the locative case to answer questions such as &quot;where?&quot; (indicating a location) or &quot;about what?&quot; (indicating a context). For example, &quot;I think about the book&quot; would be written as &quot;&quot; in the locative. Ukrainian locative and instrumental cases usually go with a preposition, unlike the other four cases in Ukrainian grammar, that may generally be employed without prepositions. The most common locative prepositions are , and ; usage of these four different variations of &quot;in&quot; depends on whether the next word starts with a consonant or vowel.

The locative is used to indicate static spatial relationships and to talk about thoughts, discussions and nuanced ideas. It is distinguished from dynamic spatial relationships, which indicate action or motion, and are expressed in the accusative case in Ukrainian and most other East Slavic languages. The adlative &quot;goal function&quot;, which in most East Slavic grammars is prescribed to be expressed in accusative (for example, ), may in Ukrainian sometimes be expressed in locative instead (; the difference in meaning cannot be translated into English), but it is only considered acceptable under certain circumstances.

Ukrainian, unlike Russian, still retains a fully functional locative case. However, during the Russification of Soviet Ukraine between the 1930s and the 1980s, several expressions in the Ukrainian language using the locative case, such as &quot;, were changed by Soviet linguistic policies, in this instance to a genitive case to &quot;, in order to conform to standard Russian &quot;&quot;. On the other hand, post-Soviet users of Surzhyk may mistakenly be employing the locative Russian form, instead of the instrumental Ukrainian form, in a sentence like &quot;The book is written in English&quot;:
* Standard 
* Surzhyk form: 
* Standard 

===Armenian===
In the Eastern standard of the Armenian language non-animate nouns take () for the locative. Animate nouns (referring to persons especially) do not take the locative.

==Turkic languages==
The Proto-Turkic language had a locative case, and most Turkic languages have retained it.

===Turkish===
The locative case exists in Turkish, as the suffix generally specified by &quot;-DA&quot;. For instance, in Turkish, means &#x27;the school&#x27;, and means &#x27;in the school&#x27;. The morpheme may exist in four different forms, depending on the preceding consonant and vowel. The first phoneme of the locative, &quot;D&quot;, changes according to the previous consonant: it is &quot;t&quot; after voiceless consonants, but &quot;d&quot; elsewhere. The vowel changes depending on the phonetic characteristics of the previous vowel: it is &quot;a&quot; after a preceding back vowel, and &quot;e&quot; after a preceding front vowel, congruent with the vowel harmony of the language. This gives four different versions of the morpheme:
* -ta, as in , &quot;in the book&quot;.
* -te, as in , &quot;in the city&quot;.
* -da, as in , &quot;in the room&quot;.
* -de, as in , &quot;in the house&quot;.

===Azerbaijani===
The locative case also exists in Azerbaijani. Similarly to Turkish, Azerbaijani employs a system of vowel harmony throughout the language. There are two simple Locative case endings:

* -da, as in , &quot;in the book&quot;.
* -də, as in , &quot;in the city&quot;.

===Kazakh===
The locative case also exists in Kazakh. Similarly to Turkish, Kazakh employs a system of vowel harmony throughout the language. There are four simple locative case endings:
* -та, as in , , &quot;in the book&quot;.
* -те, as in , , &quot;in the dictionary&quot;.
* -да, as in , , &quot;in the city&quot;.
* -де, as in , , &quot;in the room&quot;.

Furthermore, Kazakh nouns frequently utilize a possessive affix to indicate a relationship between the object and its owner. When forming the locative case of a noun in the presence of a possessive affix, there are two possible endings:
* -нда, as in , , &quot;in Erbol&#x27;s city&quot;.
* -нде, as in , , &quot;in Erbol&#x27;s dictionary&quot;.

===Uyghur===
The locative case exists in Uyghur, similarly to Turkish. This gives four different versions of the morpheme:
* &quot;-da&quot;, as in , &quot;in the square&quot;.
* &quot;-de&quot;, as in , &quot;in the house&quot;.
* &quot;-ta&quot;, as in , &quot;in the sunshine&quot;.
* &quot;-te&quot;, as in , &quot;in the lesson&quot;.

===Uzbek===
The locative case exists also in Uzbek. For example, in Uzbek, means &#x27;city&#x27;, and means &#x27;in the city&#x27;, so using &quot;-da&quot; suffix, the locative case is marked.

==Uralic languages==
Proto-Uralic has been reconstructed with a single &quot;state&quot; or &quot;stationary&quot; locative case, with the ending &quot;*-na&quot; or &quot;*-nä&quot; in accordance with vowel harmony. In many of its descendants, additional locative cases were created by combining these endings with others.

===Inari Sami===
In Inari Sami, the locative suffix is -st.
* , &#x27;in the language&#x27;
* , &#x27;in the hand&#x27;

===Hungarian===
In the Hungarian language, nine such cases exist, yet the name &#x27;locative case&#x27; refers to a form () used only in a few city/town names along with the inessive case or superessive case. It can also be observed in a few local adverbs and postpositions. It is no longer productive.

Examples:
* (also ), (also ), (also ), and (also ), (also )
* (here), (there), , (there yonder), (under), (over), (between/among), (behind) etc.

The town/city name suffixes are the inessive ones, and the are the superessive ones.

===Finnic languages===
In the Finnic languages, the original Proto-Uralic locative became the essive case, but is still found with a locative meaning in some fossilised expressions such as Finnish &quot;kotona&quot; &quot;at home&quot;. Two new locative cases were created from the old locative:
* The inessive case referring to internal location (being inside), with the reconstructed Proto-Finnic ending &quot;*-ssa&quot;/&quot;*-ssä&quot; (from earlier &quot;*-s-na&quot;/&quot;*-s-nä&quot;).
* The adessive case referring to external location (being on, at), with the reconstructed Proto-Finnic ending &quot;*-lla&quot;/&quot;*-llä&quot; (from earlier &quot;*-l-na&quot;/&quot;*-l-nä&quot;).

These endings still survive as such in several Finnic languages including Finnish, but have been reduced to &quot;-s&quot; and &quot;-l&quot; in Estonian and some others.

The Finnic languages, like some Indo-European languages (Latin, Russian, Irish), do not normally use the verb &quot;to have&quot; to show possession. The adessive case and the verb &quot;to be&quot; is used instead, so that the combination literally means &quot;on/at me is...&quot;. For example, &quot;I have a house&quot; in Estonian would be &quot;Mul on maja&quot; in which &quot;mul&quot; is in the adessive case, &quot;on&quot; is the third singular of &quot;to be&quot; (&quot;is&quot;), and &quot;maja&quot; is in nominative, not accusative. So &quot;maja&quot; is the subject, &quot;on&quot; is the verb and &quot;mul&quot; is the indirect object. This could be translated to English as &quot;At me is a house&quot; or &quot;A house is at me&quot; or &quot;There is a house at me&quot;.

==Etruscan==
The Etruscan language has a locative ending in -thi. E.g. , &quot;at Velznani&quot;, with reference to Volsinii.

==Algonquian languages==
Algonquian languages have a locative.

===Cree===
In Cree, the locative suffix is -ihk.
* (Saskatoon berry) → (at the Saskatoon berry) = &quot;[in] Saskatoon, SK&quot;
* (be many Saskatoon berries) → (at the place of many Saskatoon berries) = &quot;[in] Saskatoon, SK&quot;
* (berry) → (at the berry) = &quot;[in] Saskatoon, SK&quot;

===Innu-aimun===
In Innu-aimun, the locative suffix is -(i)t.
* (river) → (at the river)
* (school) → (at school)
* (my friend) → (at my friend&#x27;s house)
* (water) → (in the water)
* (town) → (in town)

<text>Joseph Mallord William Turner (23 April 177519 December 1851), known in his time as William Turner, was an English Romantic painter, printmaker and watercolourist. He is known for his expressive colouring, imaginative landscapes and turbulent, often violent marine paintings. He left behind more than 550 oil paintings, 2,000 watercolours, and 30,000 works on paper. He was championed by the leading English art critic John Ruskin from 1840, and is today regarded as having elevated landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting.

Turner was born in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, London, to a modest lower-middle-class family and retained his lower-class accent, while assiduously avoiding the trappings of success and fame. A child prodigy, Turner studied at the Royal Academy of Arts from 1789, enrolling when he was 14, and exhibited his first work there at 15. During this period, he also served as an architectural draftsman. He earned a steady income from commissions and sales, which he often only begrudgingly accepted owing to his troubled and contrary nature. He opened his own gallery in 1804 and became professor of perspective at the academy in 1807, where he lectured until 1828. He travelled around Europe from 1802, typically returning with voluminous sketchbooks.

Intensely private, eccentric, and reclusive, Turner was a controversial figure throughout his career. He did not marry, but fathered two daughters, Evelina (1801–1874) and Georgiana (1811–1843), by the widow Sarah Danby. He became more pessimistic and morose as he got older, especially after the death of his father in 1829; when his outlook deteriorated, his gallery fell into disrepair and neglect, and his art intensified. In 1841, Turner rowed a boat into the Thames so he could not be counted as present at any property in that year&#x27;s census. He lived in squalor and poor health from 1845, and died in London in 1851 aged 76. Turner is buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London.

== Biography ==
=== Childhood ===
Turner&#x27;s father William Turner (1745–1829) moved to London around 1770 from South Molton, Devon.

Joseph Mallord William Turner was born on 23 April 1775 and baptised on 14 May. He was born in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, in London. His father was a barber and wig maker. His mother, Mary Marshall, came from a family of butchers. A younger sister, Mary Ann, was born in September 1778 but died in August 1783.

Turner&#x27;s mother showed signs of mental disturbance from 1785 and was admitted to St Luke&#x27;s Hospital for Lunatics in Old Street in 1799. She was moved in 1800 to Bethlem Hospital, a mental asylum, where she died in 1804. Turner was sent to his maternal uncle, Joseph Mallord William Marshall, a butcher in Brentford, then a small town on the banks of the River Thames west of London, where Turner attended school. The earliest known artistic exercise by Turner is from this period—a series of simple colourings of engraved plates from Henry Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Picturesque View of the Antiquities of England and Wales&quot;.

Around 1786, Turner was sent to Margate on the north-east Kent coast. There he produced a series of drawings of the town and surrounding area that foreshadowed his later work. By this time, Turner&#x27;s drawings were being exhibited in his father&#x27;s shop window and sold for a few shillings. His father boasted to the artist Thomas Stothard that: &quot;My son, sir, is going to be a painter&quot;. In 1789, Turner again stayed with his uncle who had retired to Sunningwell (now part of Oxfordshire). A whole sketchbook of work from this time in Berkshire survives as well as a watercolour of Oxford. The use of pencil sketches on location, as the foundation for later finished paintings, formed the basis of Turner&#x27;s essential working style for his whole career.

Many early sketches by Turner were architectural studies or exercises in perspective, and it is known that, as a young man, he worked for several architects including Thomas Hardwick, James Wyatt and Joseph Bonomi the Elder. By the end of 1789, he had also begun to study under the topographical draughtsman Thomas Malton, who specialised in London views. Turner learned from him the basic tricks of the trade, copying and colouring outline prints of British castles and abbeys. He would later call Malton &quot;My real master&quot;. Topography was a thriving industry by which a young artist could pay for his studies.

=== Career ===
Turner entered the Royal Academy of Art in 1789, aged 14, and was accepted into the academy a year later by Sir Joshua Reynolds. He showed an early interest in architecture but was advised by Hardwick to focus on painting. His first watercolour, &quot;A View of the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace, Lambeth&quot;, was accepted for the Royal Academy summer exhibition of 1790 when Turner was 15.

As an academy probationer, Turner was taught drawing from plaster casts of antique sculptures. From July 1790 to October 1793, his name appears in the registry of the academy over a hundred times. In June 1792, he was admitted to the life class to learn to draw the human body from nude models. Turner exhibited watercolours each year at the academy while painting in the winter and travelling in the summer widely throughout Britain, particularly to Wales, where he produced a wide range of sketches for working up into studies and watercolours. These particularly focused on architectural work, which used his skills as a draughtsman. In 1793, he showed the watercolour titled &quot;The Rising Squall – Hot Wells from St Vincent&#x27;s Rock Bristol&quot; (now lost), which foreshadowed his later climatic effects. The British writer Peter Cunningham, in his obituary of Turner, wrote that it was: &quot;recognised by the wiser few as a noble attempt at lifting landscape art out of the tame insipidities ... [and] evinced for the first time that mastery of effect for which he is now justly celebrated&quot;.

In 1796, Turner exhibited &quot;Fishermen at Sea&quot;, his first oil painting for the academy, of a nocturnal moonlit scene of the Needles off the Isle of Wight, an image of boats in peril. Wilton said that the image was &quot;a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the 18th century&quot;. and shows strong influence by artists such as Claude Joseph Vernet, Philip James de Loutherbourg, Peter Monamy and Francis Swaine, who was admired for his moonlight marine paintings. The image was praised by contemporary critics and founded Turner&#x27;s reputation as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime scenes.

Turner travelled widely in Europe, starting with France and Switzerland in 1802 and studying in the Louvre in Paris in the same year. He made many visits to Venice. Important support for his work came from Walter Ramsden Fawkes of Farnley Hall, near Otley in Yorkshire, who became a close friend of the artist. Turner first visited Otley in 1797, aged 22, when commissioned to paint watercolours of the area. He was so attracted to Otley and the surrounding area that he returned to it throughout his career. The stormy backdrop of &quot;Snow Storm: Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps&quot; is reputed to have been inspired by a storm over the Chevin in Otley while he was staying at Farnley Hall.

Turner was a frequent guest of George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, at Petworth House in West Sussex, and painted scenes that Egremont funded taken from the grounds of the house and of the Sussex countryside, including a view of the Chichester Canal. Petworth House still displays a number of paintings.

=== Later life ===
As Turner grew older, he became more eccentric. He had few close friends except for his father, who lived with him for 30 years and worked as his studio assistant. His father&#x27;s death in 1829 had a profound effect on him, and thereafter he was subject to bouts of depression. He never married but had a relationship with an older widow, his housekeeper Sarah Danby. He is believed to have been the father of her two daughters Evelina Dupuis and Georgiana Thompson. Evelina married Joseph Dupuis on 31 October 1817. It was recorded that her mother, Sarah Danby, was a witness along with Charles Thompson.

Turner formed a relationship with Sophia Caroline Booth after her second husband died, and from 1846 he lived with her as &quot;Mr Booth&quot; or &quot;Admiral Booth&quot; in her house at 6 Davis&#x27;s Place (now Cheyne Walk) in Chelsea, until his death in December 1851.

Turner was a habitual user of snuff; in 1838, Louis Philippe I, King of the French, presented a gold snuff box to him. Of two other snuffboxes, an agate and silver example bears Turner&#x27;s name, and another, made of wood, was collected along with his spectacles, magnifying glass and card case by an associate housekeeper.

Turner formed a short but intense friendship with the artist Edward Thomas Daniell. The painter David Roberts wrote of him that, &quot;He adored Turner, when I and others doubted, and taught me to see &amp; to distinguish his beauties over that of others ... the old man really had a fond &amp; personal regard for this young clergyman, which I doubt he ever evinced for the other&quot;. Daniell may have supplied Turner with the spiritual comfort he needed after the deaths of his father and friends, and to &quot;ease the fears of a naturally reflective man approaching old age&quot;. After Daniell&#x27;s death in Lycia at the age of 38, he told Roberts he would never form such a friendship again.

Before leaving for the Middle East, Daniell commissioned Turner’s portrait from John Linnell. Turner had previously refused to sit for the artist, and it was difficult to get his agreement to be portrayed. Daniell positioned the two men opposite each other at dinner, so that Linnell could observe his subject carefully and portray his likeness from memory.Turner died of cholera at the home of Sophia Caroline Booth, in Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, on 19 December 1851. He is buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, where he lies near the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds. Apparently his last words were &quot;The Sun (or Son?) is God&quot;, though this may be apocryphal.
Turner&#x27;s friend, the architect Philip Hardwick, the son of his old tutor, was in charge of making the funeral arrangements and wrote to those who knew Turner to tell them at the time of his death that, &quot;I must inform you, we have lost him.&quot; Other executors were his cousin and chief mourner at the funeral, Henry Harpur IV (benefactor of Westminster – now Chelsea &amp; Westminster – Hospital), Revd. Henry Scott Trimmer, George Jones RA and Charles Turner ARA.

== Art ==
=== Style ===
Turner&#x27;s talent was recognised early in his life. Financial independence allowed Turner to innovate freely; his mature work is characterized by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint. According to David Piper&#x27;s &quot;The Illustrated History of Art&quot;, his later pictures were called &quot;fantastic puzzles&quot;. Turner was recognised as an artistic genius; the English art critic John Ruskin described him as the artist who could most &quot;stirringly and truthfully measure the moods of Nature&quot;.

Turner&#x27;s imagination was sparked by shipwrecks, fires (including the burning of Parliament in 1834, an event which Turner witnessed first-hand, and transcribed in a series of watercolour sketches), and natural phenomena such as sunlight, storm, rain, and fog. He was fascinated by the violent power of the sea, as seen at the 1840 Royal Academy of Arts exhibition, where &quot;The Slave Ship&quot; (1840), and &quot;Rockets and Blue Lights (Close at Hand) to Warn Steamboats of Shoal Water&quot; (1840) were first shown. A 2003 exhibition at the Clark Art Institute suggested these two paintings were pendants, due in part to their similar content and size.

Turner&#x27;s work drew criticism from contemporaries. An anonymous review of the 1840 Royal Academy exhibition, later identified as John Eagles, called the displayed paintings “absurd extravagances [that] disgrace the Exhibition”. Sir George Beaumont, a landscape painter and fellow member of the Royal Academy, described his paintings as &quot;blots&quot;.

Turner&#x27;s major venture into printmaking was the &quot;Liber Studiorum&quot; (Book of Studies), seventy prints that he worked on from 1806 to 1819. The &quot;Liber Studiorum&quot; was an expression of his intentions for landscape art. The idea was loosely based on Claude Lorrain&#x27;s &quot;Liber Veritatis&quot; (Book of Truth), where Claude had recorded his completed paintings; a series of print copies of these drawings, by then at Devonshire House, had been a huge publishing success. Turner&#x27;s plates were meant to be widely disseminated, and categorised the genre into six types: Marine, Mountainous, Pastoral, Historical, Architectural, and Elevated or Epic Pastoral. His printmaking was a major part of his output, and a museum is devoted to it, the Turner Museum in Sarasota, Florida, founded in 1974 by Douglass Montrose-Graem to house his collection of Turner prints.

His early works, such as &quot;Tintern Abbey&quot; (1795), stay true to the traditions of English landscape. In &quot;Hannibal Crossing the Alps&quot; (1812), an emphasis on the destructive power of nature has already come into play. His distinctive style of painting, in which he used watercolour technique with oil paints, created lightness, fluency, and ephemeral atmospheric effects.

In Turner&#x27;s later years, he used oils ever more transparently and turned to an evocation of almost pure light by use of shimmering colour. A prime example of his mature style can be seen in &quot;Rain, Steam and Speed – The Great Western Railway&quot;, where the objects are barely recognisable. The intensity of hue and interest in evanescent light not only placed Turner&#x27;s work in the vanguard of English painting but exerted an influence on art in France; the Impressionists, particularly Claude Monet, carefully studied his techniques. He is also generally regarded as a precursor of abstract painting.

High levels of volcanic ash (from the eruption of Mount Tambora) in the atmosphere during 1816, the &quot;Year Without a Summer&quot;, led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period, and were an inspiration for some of Turner&#x27;s work.

John Ruskin said that an early patron, Thomas Monro, Principal Physician of Bedlam, and a collector and amateur artist, was a significant influence on Turner&#x27;s style:

His true master was Dr Monro; to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study, in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by his friend Girtin, the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed; the greatness of the power itself, it is impossible to over-estimate.

Together with a number of young artists, Turner was able, in Monro&#x27;s London house, to copy works of the major topographical draughtsmen of his time and perfect his skills in drawing. But the curious atmospherical effects and illusions of John Robert Cozens&#x27;s watercolours, some of which were present in Monro&#x27;s house, went far further than the neat renderings of topography. The solemn grandeur of his Alpine views were an early revelation to the young Turner and showed him the true potential of the watercolour medium, conveying mood instead of information.

=== Materials ===
Turner experimented with a wide variety of pigments. He used formulations like carmine, despite knowing that they were not long-lasting, and against the advice of contemporary experts to use more durable pigments. As a result, many of his colours have now faded. Ruskin complained at how quickly his work decayed; Turner was indifferent to posterity and chose materials that looked good when freshly applied. By 1930, there was concern that both his oils and his watercolours were fading.

== Legacy ==
Turner left a small fortune, which he hoped would be used to support what he called &quot;decayed artists&quot;. He planned an almshouse at Twickenham in west London with a gallery for some of his works. His will was contested and in 1856, after a court battle, his first cousins, including Thomas Price Turner, received part of his fortune. Another portion went to the Royal Academy of Arts, which occasionally awards students the Turner Medal. His finished paintings were bequeathed to the British nation, and he intended that a special gallery would be built to house them. This did not happen because there was disagreement over the final site. Twenty-two years after his death, the British Parliament passed an act allowing his paintings to be lent to museums outside London, and so began the process of scattering the pictures which Turner had wanted to be kept together.

One of the greatest collectors of his work was Henry Vaughan, who when he died in 1899 owned more than one hundred watercolours and drawings by Turner and as many prints. His collection included examples of almost every type of work on paper the artist produced, from early topographical drawings and atmospheric landscape watercolours, to brilliant colour studies, literary vignette illustrations and spectacular exhibition pieces. It included nearly a hundred proofs of &quot;Liber Studiorum&quot; and twenty-three drawings connected with it. It was an unparalleled collection that comprehensively represented the diversity, imagination and technical inventiveness of Turner&#x27;s work throughout his sixty-year career. Vaughan bequeathed the most of his Turner collection to British and Irish public galleries and museums, stipulating that the collections of Turner&#x27;s watercolours should be &#x27;exhibited to the public all at one time, free of charge and only in January&#x27;, demonstrating an awareness of conservation which was unusual at the time.

In 1910, the main part of the Turner Bequest, which includes unfinished paintings and drawings, was rehoused in the Duveen Turner Wing at the National Gallery of British Art (now Tate Britain). In 1987, a new wing at the Tate, the Clore Gallery, was opened to house the Turner bequest, though some of the most important paintings remain in the National Gallery in contravention of Turner&#x27;s condition that they be kept and shown together. Increasingly paintings are lent abroad, ignoring Turner&#x27;s provision that they remain constantly and permanently in Turner&#x27;s Gallery.

St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Battersea, added a commemorative stained glass window for Turner, between 1976 and 1982. St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Royal Academy of Arts and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum all hold statues representing him. A portrait by Cornelius Varley with his patent graphic telescope (Sheffield Museums &amp; Galleries) was compared with his death mask (National Portrait Gallery, London) by Kelly Freeman at Dundee University 2009–10 to ascertain whether it really depicts Turner. The City of Westminster unveiled a memorial plaque at the site of his birthplace at 21 Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, on 2 June 1999.

Selby Whittingham founded The Turner Society at London and Manchester in 1975. After the society endorsed the Tate Gallery&#x27;s Clore Gallery wing (on the lines of the Duveen wing of 1910), as the solution to the controversy of what should be done with the Turner Bequest, Selby Whittingham resigned and founded the Independent Turner Society. The Tate created the prestigious annual Turner Prize art award in 1984, named in Turner&#x27;s honour, and 20 years later the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours founded the Winsor &amp; Newton Turner Watercolour Award. A major exhibition, &quot;Turner&#x27;s Britain&quot;, with material (including &quot;The Fighting Temeraire&quot;) on loan from around the globe, was held at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery from 7 November 2003 to 8 February 2004. In 2005, Turner&#x27;s &quot;The Fighting Temeraire&quot; was voted Britain&#x27;s &quot;greatest painting&quot; in a public poll organised by the BBC.

== Portrayal==
Leo McKern played Turner in &quot;The Sun Is God&quot;, a 1974 Thames Television production directed by Michael Darlow. The programme aired on 17 December 1974, during the Turner Bicentenary Exhibition in London.

British filmmaker Mike Leigh wrote and directed &quot;Mr. Turner&quot;, a biopic of Turner&#x27;s later years, released in 2014. The film stars Timothy Spall as Turner, Dorothy Atkinson, Marion Bailey and Paul Jesson, and premiered in competition for the at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, with Spall taking the award for Best Actor.

The Bank of England announced that a portrait of Turner, with a backdrop of &quot;The Fighting Temeraire&quot;, would appear on the £20 note beginning in 2020. It is the first £20 British banknote printed on polymer. The Turner £20 note entered circulation on Thursday, 20 February 2020.

<doc id="72188" wikidata="Q163936" url="?curid=72188" title="Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset">
<text>Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, 1st Earl of Hertford, 1st Viscount Beauchamp (150022 January 1552) was an English nobleman and politician who served as Lord Protector of England from 1547 to 1549 during the minority of his nephew King Edward VI. He was the eldest surviving brother of Queen Jane Seymour, the third wife of King Henry VIII.

Seymour grew rapidly in favour with Henry VIII following Jane&#x27;s marriage to the king in 1536, and was subsequently made Earl of Hertford. On Henry&#x27;s death in 1547, he was appointed protector by the Regency Council on the accession of the nine-year-old Edward VI. Rewarded with the title Duke of Somerset, Seymour became the effective ruler of England. Somerset continued Henry&#x27;s military campaign against the Scots and achieved a sound victory at the Battle of Pinkie, but ultimately he was unable to maintain his position in Scotland. Domestically, Somerset pursued further reforms as an extension of the English Reformation, and in 1549 imposed the first &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; through the Act of Uniformity, offering a compromise between Protestant and Roman Catholic teachings. The unpopularity of Somerset&#x27;s religious measures, along with agrarian grievances, resulted in unrest in England and provoked a series of uprisings (including the Prayer Book Rebellion and Kett&#x27;s Rebellion). Costly wars and economic mismanagement brought the Crown to financial ruin, further undermining his government.

In October 1549, Somerset was forced out of power and imprisoned in the Tower of London by John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, and a group of privy councillors. He was later released and reconciled with Warwick (now Duke of Northumberland), but in 1551 Northumberland accused him of treason, and he was executed in January 1552. Until the 1970s historians had a highly positive view of Somerset, seeing him as a champion of political liberty and the common people, but since then he has also often been portrayed as an arrogant and inept ruler of the Tudor state.

==Origins and early career==
Edward Seymour was born c. 1500, the son of Sir John Seymour (1474–1536), feudal baron of Hatch Beauchamp in Somerset, by his wife Margery Wentworth, eldest daughter of Sir Henry Wentworth of Nettlestead, Suffolk, and descended from Edward III. In 1514, aged about 14, he received an appointment in the household of Mary Tudor, Queen of France, and was &quot;enfant d&#x27;honneur&quot; at her marriage with Louis XII.

Seymour served in the Duke of Suffolk&#x27;s campaign in France in 1523, being knighted by the duke on 1 November, and accompanied Cardinal Wolsey on his embassy to France in 1527. Appointed Esquire of the Body to Henry VIII in 1529, he grew in favour with the king, who visited his manor at Elvetham in Hampshire in October 1535.

==Rise under Henry VIII==
When Seymour&#x27;s sister, Jane, married King Henry VIII in 1536, Edward was created Viscount Beauchamp on 5 June 1536, and Earl of Hertford on 15 October 1537. He became Warden of the Scottish Marches and continued in royal favour after his sister&#x27;s death on 24 October 1537.

In 1541, during Henry&#x27;s absence in the north, Hertford, Thomas Cranmer and Thomas Audley had the chief management of affairs in London. In September 1542 he was appointed Warden of the Scottish Marches, and a few months later Lord High Admiral, a post which he almost immediately relinquished in favour of John Dudley, the future duke of Northumberland. In March 1544 he was made lieutenant-general of the north and instructed to punish the Scots for their repudiation of the treaty of marriage between Prince Edward and the infant Mary, Queen of Scots. He landed at Leith on 3 May 1544, captured and pillaged Edinburgh, and returned by land burning villages and castles along the way.

In July 1544 he was appointed lieutenant of the realm under Catherine Parr, Henry&#x27;s sixth wife and regent, during Henry&#x27;s absence at Boulogne, but in August he joined the king and was present at the surrender of the town. In the autumn he was one of the commissioners sent to Flanders to keep Emperor Charles V to the terms of his treaty with England, and in January 1545 he was placed in command at Boulogne, where on the 26th he repelled an attempt of Marshal de Biez to recapture the town. In May he was once more appointed lieutenant-general in the north to avenge the Scottish victory at the Battle of Ancrum Moor; this he did by a savage foray into Scotland in September. He reported that on 16 September 1545 he had &quot;sent forth a good band to the number of 1500 light horsemen in the leading of me [and] Sir Robert Bowes, which from 5 a.m. till 3 p.m., forayed along the waters of Tyvyote and Rowle, 6 or 7 miles beyond Jedburgh, and burnt 14 or 15 towns and a great quantity of all kinds of corn&quot;.

In March 1546 he was sent back to Boulogne to supersede the Earl of Surrey, whose command had not been a success; and in June he was engaged in negotiations for peace with France and for the delimitation of the English conquests.

From October to the end of Henry&#x27;s reign he was in attendance on the king, engaged in the struggle for predominance which was to determine the complexion of the government during the coming minority. Personal, political and religious rivalry separated him and Baron Lisle from the Howards, and Surrey&#x27;s hasty temper precipitated his own ruin and that of his father, the duke of Norfolk. They could not acquiesce in the Imperial ambassador&#x27;s verdict that Hertford and Lisle were the only noblemen of fit age and capacity to carry on the government; and Surrey&#x27;s attempt to secure the predominance of his family led to his own execution and to his father&#x27;s imprisonment in the Tower of London.

==Seymour&#x27;s Protectorate==

===Council of Regency===

Upon the death of Henry VIII (28 January 1547), Seymour&#x27;s nephew became king as Edward VI. Henry VIII&#x27;s will named sixteen executors, who were to act as Edward&#x27;s Council until he reached the age of 18. These executors were supplemented by twelve men &quot;of counsail&quot; who would assist the executors when called on. The final state of Henry VIII&#x27;s will has occasioned controversy. Some historians suggest that those close to the king manipulated either him or the will itself to ensure a shareout of power to their benefit, both material and religious. In this reading, the composition of the Privy Chamber shifted towards the end of 1546 in favour of the Protestant faction. In addition, two leading conservative Privy Councillors were removed from the centre of power. Stephen Gardiner was refused access to Henry during his last months. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, found himself accused of treason; on 24–25 December, he offered his vast estates to the Crown making them available for redistribution, and he spent the whole of Edward&#x27;s reign in the Tower of London.

Other historians have argued that Gardiner&#x27;s exclusion had non-religious causes, that Norfolk was not noticeably conservative in religion, that conservatives remained on the council, and that the radicalism of men such as Sir Anthony Denny, who controlled the dry stamp that replicated the king&#x27;s signature, is debatable. Whatever the case, Henry&#x27;s death was followed by a lavish hand-out of lands and honours to the new power group. The will contained an &quot;unfulfilled gifts&quot; clause, added at the last minute, which allowed Henry&#x27;s executors to freely distribute lands and honours to themselves and the court, particularly to Seymour (then known as Earl of Hertford), who became the Lord Protector of the Realm and Governor of the King&#x27;s Person, and who created himself Duke of Somerset.

Henry VIII&#x27;s will did not provide for the appointment of a Protector. It entrusted the government of the realm during his son&#x27;s minority to a Regency Council that would rule collectively, by majority decision, with &quot;like and equal charge&quot;. Nevertheless, a few days after Henry&#x27;s death, on 4 February, the executors chose to invest almost regal power in Edward Seymour. Thirteen out of the sixteen (the others being absent) agreed to his appointment as Protector, which they justified as their joint decision &quot;by virtue of the authority&quot; of Henry&#x27;s will. Seymour may have done a deal with some of the executors, who almost all received hand-outs; he is known to have done so with William Paget, private secretary to Henry VIII, and to have secured the support of Sir Anthony Browne of the Privy Chamber.

Seymour&#x27;s appointment was in keeping with historical precedent, and his eligibility for the role was reinforced by his military successes in Scotland and France. He was senior to his ally Lisle in the peerage, and was the new king&#x27;s closest relative.

In March 1547, he secured letters patent from King Edward granting him the almost monarchical right to appoint members to the Privy Council himself and to consult them only when he wished. In the words of historian G. R. Elton, &quot;from that moment his autocratic system was complete&quot;. He proceeded to rule largely by proclamation, calling on the Privy Council to do little more than rubber-stamp his decisions.

Seymour&#x27;s takeover of power was smooth and efficient. The imperial ambassador Francis van der Delft reported that he &quot;governs everything absolutely&quot;, with Paget operating as his secretary, although he predicted trouble from John Dudley, Viscount Lisle, who had recently been raised to Earl of Warwick in the share-out of honours. In fact, in the early weeks of his Protectorate, Seymour met opposition only from the Lord Chancellor, Thomas Wriothesley, whom the Earldom of Southampton had evidently failed to buy off, and from his own brother. Wriothesley, a religious conservative, objected to Seymour&#x27;s assumption of monarchical power over the council. He then found himself abruptly dismissed from the chancellorship on charges of selling off some of his offices to delegates.

In his first parliament, which met in November 1547, Seymour procured the repeal of all the heresy laws and nearly all the treason laws passed since Edward III. He sought to win over the Scots by those promises of autonomy, free trade, and equal privileges with England. But the Scots were not to be won over yet, and would not be persuaded; the protector led another army into Scotland in September 1547, and won the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh on 10 September. He trusted the garrisons he established throughout the Lowlands to wear down Scottish opposition, but their pressure was soon weakened by troubles in England and abroad; and Mary, Queen of Scots, having been betrothed to Francis, heir to the French throne, was transported to France in 1548, where the two married ten years later.

To deal with the widespread social problems in England, Seymour introduced the Vagabonds Act 1547, which dictated that able-bodied men who were unemployed for three days or more should be sold into slavery for two years. This law was deeply unpopular and turned many people against him, particularly local officials who were blamed for enforcing the Act.

Seymour also attempted to bring uniformity to forms of worship, and in 1549 the first Act of Uniformity introduced a &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; that attempted to compromise between different teachings; it was replaced by a more severe form in 1552, after his fall. Prior to and during the Protectorate, the Book of Common Prayer was a central element of the emerging Protestant literature.

===Thomas Seymour===

Edward Seymour faced less manageable opposition from his younger brother Thomas, who has been described as a &quot;worm in the bud&quot;. As King Edward&#x27;s uncle, Thomas Seymour demanded the governorship of the king&#x27;s person and a greater share of power. Seymour tried to buy his brother off with a barony, an appointment to the Lord Admiralship, and a seat on the Privy Council—but Thomas was bent on scheming for power. He began smuggling pocket money to King Edward, telling him that the Duke of Somerset held the purse strings too tight, making him a &quot;beggarly king&quot;. He also urged him to throw off the Protector within two years and &quot;bear rule as other kings do&quot;; but Edward, schooled to defer to the council, failed to co-operate.

In April 1547, using King Edward&#x27;s support to circumvent his brother&#x27;s opposition, Thomas Seymour secretly married Henry VIII&#x27;s widow Catherine Parr, whose Protestant household included the 11-year-old Lady Jane Grey and the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth.

In summer 1548, a pregnant Catherine Parr discovered Thomas Seymour embracing Princess Elizabeth. As a result, Elizabeth was removed from Catherine Parr&#x27;s household and transferred to that of Sir Anthony Denny. In that September, Catherine Parr died in childbirth, and Thomas Seymour promptly resumed his attentions to Elizabeth by letter, planning to marry her. Elizabeth was receptive, but, like Edward, unready to agree to anything unless permitted by the council. In January 1549, the council had Thomas Seymour arrested on various charges, including embezzlement at the Bristol mint. King Edward himself testified about the pocket money. Most importantly, Thomas Seymour had sought to officially receive the governorship of King Edward, for no earlier Lord Protectors, unlike Edward Seymour, had ever held both functions. Lack of clear evidence for treason ruled out a trial, so Thomas was condemned instead by an Act of Attainder and beheaded on 20 March 1549.

===War===
Edward Seymour&#x27;s only undoubted skill was as a soldier, which he had proved on his expeditions to Scotland and in the defence of Boulogne in 1546. From the first, his main interest as Protector was the war against Scotland. After a crushing victory at the Battle of Pinkie in September 1547, he set up a network of garrisons in Scotland, stretching as far north as Dundee. His initial successes, however, were followed by a loss of direction. His aim of uniting the realms through conquest became increasingly unrealistic. The Scots allied with France, who sent reinforcements for the defence of Edinburgh in 1548, while Mary, Queen of Scots, was removed to France, where she was betrothed to the dauphin. The cost of maintaining the Protector&#x27;s massive armies and his permanent garrisons in Scotland also placed an unsustainable burden on the royal finances. A French attack on Boulogne in August 1549 at last forced Seymour to begin a withdrawal from Scotland.

===Rebellion===
During 1548, England was subject to social unrest. After April 1549, a series of armed revolts broke out, fuelled by various religious and agrarian grievances. The two most serious rebellions required major military intervention to put down: one was in Devon and Cornwall, the other in Norfolk. The first, called the Prayer Book Rebellion (and also known as the Western rebellion), arose mainly from the imposition of church services in English; the second, led by a tradesman called Robert Kett, mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground. A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protestors believed they were acting legitimately against enclosing landlords with the Protector&#x27;s support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers.

The same justification for outbreaks of unrest was voiced throughout the country, not only in Norfolk and the west. The origin of the popular view of Edward Seymour as sympathetic to the rebel cause lies partly in his series of sometimes liberal, often contradictory, proclamations. and partly in the uncoordinated activities of the commissions he sent out in 1548 and 1549 to investigate grievances about loss of tillage, encroachment of large sheep flocks on common land, and similar issues. Seymour&#x27;s commissions were led by the evangelical M.P. John Hales, whose socially liberal rhetoric linked the issue of enclosure with Reformation theology and the notion of a godly commonwealth. Local groups often assumed that the findings of these commissions entitled them to act against offending landlords themselves. King Edward wrote in his &quot;Chronicle&quot; that the 1549 risings began &quot;because certain commissions were sent down to pluck down enclosures&quot;.

Whatever the popular view of the Duke of Somerset, the disastrous events of 1549 were taken as evidence of a colossal failure of government, and the Council laid the responsibility at the Protector&#x27;s door. In July 1549, Paget wrote to Seymour: &quot;Every man of the council have misliked your proceedings ... would to God, that, at the first stir you had followed the matter hotly, and caused justice to be ministered in solemn fashion to the terror of others ...&quot;.

===Fall from power===
The sequence of events that led to Seymour&#x27;s removal from power has often been called a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. By 1 October 1549, Seymour had been alerted that his rule faced a serious threat. He issued a proclamation calling for assistance, took possession of the king&#x27;s person, and withdrew for safety to the fortified Windsor Castle, where Edward said, &quot;Methinks I am in prison&quot;.

By 7 October he was writing desperately to Sir Rowland Hill, Lord Mayor of London, and a fellow member of the Privy Council requesting 1000 troops to defend him and the King. By this point a meeting had already been had between Hill and London representatives with John Dudley, then Earl of Warwick at Ely Palace. That meeting moved decisively against Somerset.

Meanwhile, a united Council published details of Seymour&#x27;s mismanagement of government. They made clear that the Protector&#x27;s power came from them, not from Henry VIII&#x27;s will. On 11 October, the council had Seymour arrested and brought the king to Richmond. Edward summarised the charges against Somerset in his &quot;Chronicle&quot;: &quot;ambition, vainglory, entering into rash wars in mine youth, negligent looking on Newhaven, enriching himself of my treasure, following his own opinion, and doing all by his own authority, etc.&quot;

In February 1550, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, emerged as the leader of the Council and, in effect, as Seymour&#x27;s successor. Although Seymour was released from the Tower and restored to the council in early 1550, in October 1551 he was sent to the Tower on an exaggerated charge of treason. Instead, he was executed for felony (that of seeking a change of government) on 22 January 1552 after scheming to overthrow Dudley&#x27;s regime. Edward noted his uncle&#x27;s death in his &quot;Chronicle&quot;: &quot;the duke of Somerset had his head cut off upon Tower Hill between eight and nine o&#x27;clock in the morning&quot;. Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset was interred at St. Peter ad Vincula, Tower of London.

===Historiography===
Historians have contrasted the efficiency of Edward Seymour&#x27;s takeover of power in 1547 with the subsequent ineptitude of his rule. By autumn 1549, his costly wars had lost momentum, the crown faced financial ruin, and riots and rebellions had broken out around the country. Until recent decades, Seymour&#x27;s reputation with historians was high, in view of his many proclamations that appeared to back the common people against a rapacious landowning class. In the early 20th century this line was taken by the influential A. F. Pollard, and was echoed by Edward VI&#x27;s 1960s biographer W. K. Jordan. A more critical approach was initiated by M. L. Bush and Dale Hoak in the mid-1970s. Since that time the first Duke of Somerset has often been portrayed as an arrogant ruler, devoid of the political and administrative skills necessary for governing the Tudor state.

==Marriages and issue==
Edward Seymour married twice:
*Firstly by 1518, to Catherine Fillol (or Filliol) (d. ), a daughter and co-heiress of Sir William Fillol (1453–1527), of Fillol&#x27;s Hall, Essex and Woodlands, Horton, Dorset. Catherine bore two sons, whose paternity was questioned by her husband after it was discovered that she was &quot;apt to bestow her favours too liberally&quot;, which resulted in both being excluded in 1540 from their paternal and maternal inheritances, and all their claims to their father&#x27;s dignities being postponed to his children by his second wife. Ironically these two sons remained faithful to their father during his misfortunes and both were imprisoned with him in the Tower of London:
** John Seymour (1527 – 19 December 1552) was sent to the Tower where he died in December 1552, having survived his father by 11 months. He successfully petitioned Parliament for the restoration of his maternal inheritance, but as her lands had been sold, he was awarded compensation in the form of the estate of Maiden Bradley, an Augustinian priory in Wiltshire granted to his father at the Dissolution by Henry VIII, which had descended to his half-siblings. However, he did not live to enjoy the grant and bequeathed it with all his other lands and goods to his younger brother Lord Edward Seymour.
** Lord Edward Seymour (1529–1593) of Berry Pomeroy, Devon, Sheriff of Devon. He was sent to the Tower in 1551 but was later released, and became heir to his elder brother, from whom he inherited Maiden Bradley, where today Bradley House is the seat of his descendant, the present Duke of Somerset.

*Secondly, before 9 March 1535, to Anne Stanhope (c. 1510–1587), only child and sole heiress of Sir Edward Stanhope (1462–1511) by his wife Elizabeth Bourchier (c. 1473–1557), daughter of Fulk Bourchier, 10th Baron FitzWarin (1445–1479). Seymour&#x27;s suspicions about the fathering of Catherine Fillol&#x27;s sons led him to obtain an act of Parliament in 1540, entailing his estates away from the children of his first wife in favour of the children of Anne Stanhope. By Anne, he had ten children:
**Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp of Hache (12 October 15371539), known by the courtesy title of one of his father&#x27;s subsidiary titles. He died as a two-year-old infant and predeceased his father.
**Lady Anne Seymour (1538–1588), who married twice: firstly to John Dudley, 2nd Earl of Warwick; secondly to Sir Edward Unton, MP, by whom she had children.
**Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford (22 May 15391621), in 1559 created Earl of Hertford and Baron Beauchamp of Hatch by Queen Elizabeth I, the half-sister of King Edward VI. He married three times: firstly in November 1560, Lady Catherine Grey, by whom he had two sons; secondly in 1582 to Frances Howard, daughter of Baron Howard of Effingham; thirdly in 1601 to Frances Prannell.
**Lord Henry Seymour (1540–?), married Lady Joan Percy, daughter of Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland
**Lady Margaret Seymour (born 1540), a noted author
**Lady Jane Seymour (1541–1561), Maid of Honour to Queen Elizabeth I, also a noted author
**Lady Catherine Seymour

**Lady Mary Seymour (born 1542), who married three times:
*** Firstly to Francis Cosby
***Secondly, to Andrew Rogers (died c. 1599), MP, of Bryanstone, Dorset. They had no children. 
***Thirdly, to Sir Henry Peyton
**Lord Edward Seymour (1548–1574), died unmarried and childless
**Lady Elizabeth Seymour (1552 – 3 June 1602), who married Sir Richard Knightley, of Fawsley, Northamptonshire. Her portrait was painted by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger including the Seymour phoenix badge, and her monument with effigy survives in All Saints church, Norton, Northamptonshire.

The male line of Edward Seymour and Anne Stanhope died out with the seventh Duke of Somerset in 1750, when the descendants of Edward Seymour by his first wife, Catherine Fillol, inherited the Somerset dukedom in accordance with the private act of 1540. However, the female line continued, and Queen Elizabeth II was descended from Somerset through his grandchild by Catherine Grey.

<doc id="72191" wikidata="Q1380165" url="?curid=72191" title="Gymir (father of Gerðr)">
<text>Gymir (Old Norse: ) is a jötunn in Norse mythology. He is the spouse of Aurboða, and the father of the beautiful jötunn Gerðr, who married the god Freyr. &quot;Gymir&quot; may be the same figure as Ægir, a personification of the sea or ocean, or a separate figure who shares the same name.

==Name==
The meaning of the Old Norse name &quot;Gymir&quot; is unclear. Proposed translations include &#x27;the earthly&#x27; (from Old Norse &quot;gumi&quot;), &#x27;the wintry one&#x27; (from &quot;gemla&quot;), or &#x27;the protector&#x27;, the &#x27;engulfer&#x27; (from &quot;geyma&quot;).

In &quot;Lokasenna&quot; (Loki&#x27;s Flyting) and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (The Language of Poetry), Gymir is given by Snorri Sturluson as an alternative name for the divine personification of the sea Ægir. Rudolf Simek argues that it may be an erroneous interpretation of kennings in which different giant-names are used interchangeably.
==Attestations==
===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
In both &quot;Skírnismál&quot; (The Lay of Skírnir) and &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (The Beguiling of Gylfi), Gymir is portrayed as the spouse of Aurboða; and from their union was born Gerðr.
===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
A verse from the 9th-century skald Ref Gestsson is quoted in the later &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (The Language of Poetry).
According to John Lindow, &quot;the verse in question seems to say that the cold seeress of Gymir often transports the bear of twisted lines into the jaw of Ægir; that is, that the wave (Ægir’s daughters are the nine waves) often drives a ship deep into the water.&quot;

== Scholarly reception and interpretation ==
The name &quot;Gymir&quot; may indicate that Ægir was understood as the father of the beautiful jötunn Gerðr or indicate that two figures by the same name. Both the prose introduction to &quot;Lokasenna&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; state that Ægir is also known as Gymir, the father of the jötunn Gerðr. Rudolf Simek argues that, if understood to be two different entities, this may stem rom an erroneous interpretation of kennings in which different jötunn-names are used interchangeably.

Gymir has been seen as a chthonic deity, and Magnus Olsen argued that he was an earth giant from his interpretation of &quot;Skírnismál&quot; in light of the &quot;hieros gamos.&quot;

<text>In Norse mythology, the Hliðskjálf (literally meaning the high seat with an expansive view) allowed Odin to see into all realms as well as listen to them.

Although not explicit in any surviving source, there may be a connection between Hliðskjálf and the art of seiðr, a type of magic said to be practiced by Odin that was often performed from a high, raised platform called a seiðhjallr. The works of Rudolf Simek suggest that Hliðskjálf could be the model that actual seiðhjallr platforms attempted to emulate.

==&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;==
In &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, Odin and Frigg are both sitting in Hliðskjálf when they see their foster sons Agnarr and Geirröðr, one living in a cave with a giantess and the other a king. Frigg then made the accusation to her husband that Geirröðr was miserly and inhospitable toward guests, so after wagering with one another over the veracity of the statement, Odin set out to visit Geirröðr in order to settle the matter.

In &quot;Skírnismál&quot;, Freyr sneaks into Hliðskjálf when he looks into Jötunheimr and sees the beautiful giant maiden Gerðr, with whom he instantly falls in love.

==&quot;Prose Edda&quot;==
In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Snorri mentions the high seat on four occasions. In the first instance he seems to refer to it rather as a dwelling place:
&quot;There is one abode called Hliðskjálf, and when Allfather sat in the high seat there, he looked out over the whole world and saw every man&#x27;s acts, and knew all things which he saw.&quot;

However, later he explicitly refers to it as the high seat itself:
&quot;Another great abode is there, which is named Valaskjálf. Odin possesses that dwelling. The gods made it and thatched it with sheer silver, and in this hall is the Hliðskjálf, the high seat so called. Whenever Allfather sits in that seat, he surveys all lands.&quot;

The third mention made of Hliðskjálf is during Snorri&#x27;s recounting of the wooing of Gerd, quoted by him from &quot;Skírnismál&quot;. Lastly, Snorri relates how Odin used the high seat to find Loki after he fled from the scene of his murder of Baldr.

It is described to be inside the throne room of Valaskjálf Odin&#x27;s home. It said upon it that Odin looks upon his world.

<text>The Prose Edda, also known as the Younger Edda, Snorri&#x27;s Edda () or, historically, simply as Edda, is an Old Norse textbook written in Iceland during the early 13th century. The work is often considered to have been to some extent written, or at least compiled, by the Icelandic scholar, lawspeaker, and historian Snorri Sturluson 1220. It is considered the fullest and most detailed source for modern knowledge of Norse mythology, the body of myths of the North Germanic peoples, and draws from a wide variety of sources, including versions of poems that survive into today in a collection known as the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;.

The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; consists of four sections: The Prologue, a euhemerized account of the Norse gods; &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, which provides a question and answer format that details aspects of Norse mythology (consisting of approximately 20,000 words), &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, which continues this format before providing lists of kennings and &quot;heiti&quot; (approximately 50,000 words); and &quot;Háttatal&quot;, which discusses the composition of traditional skaldic poetry (approximately 20,000 words).

Dating from 1300 to 1600, seven manuscripts of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; differ from one another in notable ways, which provides researchers with independent textual value for analysis. The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; appears to have functioned similarly to a contemporary textbook, with the goal of assisting Icelandic poets and readers in understanding the subtleties of alliterative verse, and to grasp the meaning behind the many kennings used in skaldic poetry.

Originally known to scholars simply as &quot;Edda&quot;, the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; gained its contemporary name in order to differentiate it from the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. Early scholars of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; suspected that there once existed a collection of entire poems, a theory confirmed with the rediscovery of manuscripts of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;.

==Naming==
The etymology of &quot;Edda&quot; remains uncertain; there are many hypotheses about its meaning and development, yet little agreement. Some argue that the word derives from the name of Oddi, a town in the south of Iceland where Snorri was raised. Edda could therefore mean &quot;book of Oddi.&quot; However, this assumption is generally rejected. Anthony Faulkes in his English translation of the Prose Edda comments that this is &quot;unlikely, both in terms of linguistics and history&quot; since Snorri was no longer living at Oddi when he composed his work.

Another connection was made with the word &quot;óðr&quot;, which means &#x27;poetry or inspiration&#x27; in Old Norse. According to Faulkes, though such a connection is plausible semantically, it is unlikely that &quot;Edda&quot; could have been coined in the 13th century on the basis of &quot;óðr&quot;, because such a development &quot;would have had to have taken place gradually&quot;, and &quot;Edda&quot; in the sense of &#x27;poetics&#x27; is not likely to have existed in the preliterary period.

Edda also means &#x27;great-grandparent&#x27;, a word that appears in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, which occurs as the name of a figure in the eddic poem &quot;Rigsthula&quot; and in other medieval texts.

A final hypothesis is derived from the Latin &quot;edo&quot;, meaning &quot;I write&quot;. It relies on the fact that the word &quot;kredda&quot; (meaning &quot;belief&quot;) is certified and comes from the Latin &quot;credo&quot;, meaning &#x27;I believe&#x27;. &quot;Edda&quot; in this case could be translated as &quot;Poetic Art&quot;. This is the meaning that the word was then given in the medieval period.

The now uncommonly used name &quot;Sæmundar Edda&quot; was given by the Bishop Brynjólfur Sveinsson to the collection of poems contained in the Codex Regius, many of which are quoted by Snorri. Brynjólfur, along with many others of his time incorrectly believed that they were collected by Sæmundr fróði (therefore before the drafting of the Edda of Snorri), and so the Poetic Edda is also known as the Elder Edda.

== Manuscripts ==
Seven manuscripts of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; have survived into the present day: Six copies from the medieval period and another dating to the 1600s. No one manuscript is complete, and each has variations. In addition to three fragments, the four main manuscripts are Codex Regius, Codex Wormianus, Codex Trajectinus, and the Codex Upsaliensis:

The other three manuscripts are AM 748; AM 757 a 4to; and AM 738 II 4to, AM le ß fol. Although some scholars have doubted whether a sound stemma of the manuscripts can be created, due to the possibility of scribes drawing on multiple exemplars or from memory, recent work has found that the main sources of each manuscript can be fairly readily ascertained. The &quot;Prose Edda&quot;&#x27; remained fairly unknown outside of Iceland until the publication of the &quot;Edda Islandorum&quot; in 1665.

==Authorship==
The text is generally considered to have been written or at least compiled by Snorri Sturluson. This identification is largely based on the following paragraph from a portion of Codex Upsaliensis, an early 14th-century manuscript containing the &quot;Edda&quot;:

Scholars have noted that this attribution, along with that of other primary manuscripts, is not clear whether or not Snorri is more than the compiler of the work and the author of &quot;Háttatal&quot; or if he is the author of the entire &quot;Edda&quot;. Faulkes summarizes the matter of scholarly discourse around the authorship of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; as follows:
:Snorri&#x27;s authorship of the Prose Edda was upheld by the renaissance scholar Arngrímur Jónsson (1568–1648), and since his time it has generally been accepted without question. But the surviving manuscripts, which were all written more than half a century after Snorri&#x27;s death, differ from each other considerably and it is not likely that any of them preserves the work quite as he wrote it. A number of passages in Skáldskaparmál especially have been thought to be interpolations, and this section of the work has clearly been subject to various kinds of revision in most manuscripts. It has also been argued that the prologue and the first paragraph and part of the last paragraph of Gylfaginning are not by Snorri, at least in their surviving forms.

Whatever the case, the mention of Snorri in the manuscripts has been influential in a common acceptance of Snorri as the author or at least one of the authors of the &quot;Edda&quot;.

==Contents==
===Prologue===

The Prologue is the first section of four books of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, consisting of a euhemerized Christian account of the origins of Norse mythology: the Nordic gods are described as human Trojan warriors who left Troy after the fall of that city (an origin which parallels Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;).

===&quot;Gylfaginning&quot;===
&quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (Old Icelandic &#x27;the tricking of Gylfi&#x27;) follows the Prologue in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; deals with the creation and destruction of the world of the Nordic gods, and many other aspects of Norse mythology. The section is written in prose interspersed with quotes from eddic poetry.

===&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;===
&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (Old Icelandic &#x27;the language of poetry&#x27;) is the third section of &quot;Edda&quot;, and consists of a dialogue between Ægir, a jötunn who is one of various personifications of the sea, and Bragi, a skaldic god, in which both Norse mythology and discourse on the nature of poetry are intertwined. The origin of a number of kennings are given and Bragi then delivers a systematic list of kennings for various people, places, and things. Bragi then goes on to discuss poetic language in some detail, in particular &quot;heiti&quot;, the concept of poetical words which are non-periphrastic, for example &quot;steed&quot; for &quot;horse&quot;, and again systematises these. This section contains numerous quotes from skaldic poetry.

===&quot;Háttatal&quot;===

&quot;Háttatal&quot; (Old Icelandic &quot;list of verse-forms&quot;) is the last section of &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. The section is composed by the Icelandic poet, politician, and historian Snorri Sturluson. Primarily using his own compositions, it exemplifies the types of verse forms used in Old Norse poetry. Snorri took a prescriptive as well as descriptive approach; he has systematized the material, often noting that the older poets did not always follow his rules.

== Translations ==

The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; has been the subject of numerous translations. The most recent ones into English have been by Jesse Byock (2006), Anthony Faulkes (1987 / 2nd ed. 1995), Jean Young (1954), and Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur (1916). Many of these translations are abridged; the technical nature of the &quot;Háttatal&quot; means it is frequently excluded, and the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; often has its more Old Norse thesaurus aspects abridged as well.

<text>Nothing, no-thing, or no thing, is the complete absence of anything as the opposite of something and an antithesis of everything. The concept of nothing has been a matter of philosophical debate since at least the 5th century BC. Early Greek philosophers argued that it was impossible for &quot;nothing&quot; to exist. The atomists allowed &quot;nothing&quot; but only in the spaces between the invisibly small atoms. For them, all space was filled with atoms. Aristotle took the view that there exists matter and there exists space, a receptacle into which matter objects can be placed. This became the paradigm for classical scientists of the modern age like Newton. Nevertheless, some philosophers, like Descartes, continued to argue against the existence of empty space until the scientific discovery of a physical vacuum.

Existentialists like Sartre and Heidegger (as interpreted by Sartre) have associated &quot;nothing&quot; with consciousness. Some writers have made connections between Heidegger&#x27;s concept of &quot;nothing&quot; and the nirvana of Eastern religions.

Modern science does not equate &quot;vacuum&quot; with &quot;nothing&quot;. The vacuum in quantum field theory is filled with virtual particles. The quantum vacuum is often viewed as a modern version of an aether theory.

==Philosophy==
===Western===
Some would consider the study of &quot;nothing&quot; to be absurd. A typical response of this type is voiced by the Venetian Giacomo Casanova (1725–1798) in conversation with his landlord, one Dr. Gozzi, who also happens to be a priest:

&quot;Nothingness&quot; has been treated as a serious subject for a very long time. In philosophy, to avoid linguistic traps over the meaning of &quot;nothing&quot;, a phrase such as &quot;not-being&quot; is often employed to make clear what is being discussed.

====Parmenides====
One of the earliest Western philosophers to consider nothing as a concept was Parmenides (5th century BC), a Greek philosopher of the monist school. He argued that &quot;nothing&quot; cannot exist by the following line of reasoning: To speak of a thing, one has to speak of a thing that exists. If one can speak of a thing in the past, this thing must still exist (in some sense) now, and from this he concluded that there is no such thing as change. As a corollary, there can be no such things as &quot;coming-into-being&quot;, &quot;passing-out-of-being&quot;, or &quot;not-being&quot;.

Other philosophers, for instance, Socrates and Plato largely agreed with Parmenides&#x27;s reasoning on nothing. Aristotle differs with Parmenides&#x27;s conception of nothing and says, &quot;Although these opinions seem to follow logically in a dialectical discussion, yet to believe them seems next door to madness when one considers the facts.&quot;

In modern times, Albert Einstein&#x27;s concept of spacetime has led many scientists, including Einstein himself, to adopt a position remarkably similar to Parmenides. On the death of his friend Michele Besso, Einstein consoled his widow with the words, &quot;Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That signifies nothing. For those of us that believe in physics, the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.&quot;

====Leucippus====
Leucippus (early 5th century BC), one of the atomists, along with other philosophers of his time, made attempts to reconcile this monism with the everyday observation of motion and change. He accepted the monist position that there could be no motion without a void. The void is the opposite of being. It is &quot;not-being&quot;. On the other hand, there exists something known as an absolute , a space filled with matter, and there can be no motion in a plenum because it is completely full. But, there is not just one monolithic plenum, for existence consists of a multiplicity of plenums. These are the invisibly small &quot;atoms&quot; of Greek atomist theory, later expanded by Democritus (c. 460–370 BC), which allows the void to &quot;exist&quot; between them. In this scenario, macroscopic objects can &quot;come-into-being&quot;, move through space, and pass into &quot;not-being&quot; by means of the coming together and moving apart of their constituent atoms. The void must exist to allow this to happen, or else the &quot;frozen world&quot; of Parmenides must be accepted.

Bertrand Russell points out that this does not exactly defeat the argument of Parmenides but, rather, ignores it by taking the rather modern scientific position of starting with the observed data (motion, etc.) and constructing a theory based on the data, as opposed to Parmenides&#x27; attempts to work from pure logic. Russell also observes that both sides were mistaken in believing that there can be no motion in a plenum, but arguably motion cannot &quot;start&quot; in a plenum. Cyril Bailey notes that Leucippus is the first to say that a &quot;thing&quot; (the void) might be real without being a body and points out the irony that this comes from a materialistic atomist. Leucippus is therefore the first to say that &quot;nothing&quot; has a reality attached to it.

====Aristotle, Newton, Descartes====
Aristotle (384–322 BC) provided the classic escape from the logical problem posed by Parmenides by distinguishing things that are &quot;matter&quot; and things that are &quot;space&quot;. In this scenario, space is not &quot;nothing&quot; but, rather, a receptacle in which objects of matter can be placed. The true void (as &quot;nothing&quot;) is different from &quot;space&quot; and is removed from consideration. This characterization of space reached its pinnacle with Isaac Newton who asserted the existence of absolute space. René Descartes, on the other hand, returned to a Parmenides-like argument of denying the existence of space. For Descartes, there was matter, and there was extension of matter leaving no room for the existence of &quot;nothing&quot;.

The idea that space can actually be empty was generally still not accepted by philosophers who invoked arguments similar to the plenum reasoning. Although Descartes&#x27; views on this were challenged by Blaise Pascal, he declined to overturn the traditional belief, &quot;horror vacui&quot;, commonly stated as &quot;nature abhors a vacuum&quot;. This remained so until Evangelista Torricelli invented the barometer in 1643 and showed that an empty space appeared if the mercury tube was turned upside down. This phenomenon being known as the Torricelli vacuum and the unit of vacuum pressure, the torr, being named after him. Even Torricelli&#x27;s teacher, Galileo Galilei, had previously been unable to adequately explain the sucking action of a pump.

====John the Scot====
John the Scot, or Johannes Scotus Eriugena (c. 815–877) held many surprisingly heretical beliefs for the time he lived in for which no action appears ever to have been taken against him. His ideas mostly stem from, or are based on his work of translating pseudo-Dionysius. His beliefs are essentially pantheist and he classifies evil, amongst many other things, into &quot;not-being&quot;. This is done on the grounds that evil is the opposite of good, a quality of God, but God can have no opposite, since God is everything in the pantheist view of the world. Similarly, the idea that God created the world out of &quot;nothing&quot; is to be interpreted as meaning that the &quot;nothing&quot; here is synonymous with God.

====G. W. F. Hegel====
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) is the philosopher who brought the dialectical method to a new pinnacle of development. According to Hegel in &quot;Science of Logic&quot;, the dialectical methods consists of three steps. First, a thesis is given, which can be any proposition in logic. Second, the antithesis of the thesis is formed and, finally, a synthesis incorporating both thesis and antithesis. Hegel believed that no proposition taken by itself can be completely true. Only the whole can be true, and the dialectical synthesis was the means by which the whole could be examined in relation to a specific proposition. Truth consists of the whole process. Separating out thesis, antithesis, or synthesis as a stand-alone statement results in something that is in some way or other untrue. The concept of &quot;nothing&quot; arises in Hegel right at the beginning of his &quot;Logic&quot;. The whole is called by Hegel the &quot;Absolute&quot; and is to be viewed as something spiritual. Hegel then has:
* Thesis: the absolute is pure being
* Antithesis: the absolute is nothing
* Synthesis: the absolute is becoming

====Existentialists====
The most prominent figure among the existentialists is Jean-Paul Sartre, whose ideas in his book &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;être et le néant&quot;) are heavily influenced by &quot;Being and Time&quot; (&quot;Sein und Zeit&quot;) of Martin Heidegger, although Heidegger later stated that he was misunderstood by Sartre. Sartre defines two kinds of &quot;being&quot; (être). One kind is &quot;être-en-soi&quot;, the brute existence of things such as a tree. The other kind is &quot;être-pour-soi&quot; which is consciousness. Sartre claims that this second kind of being is &quot;nothing&quot; since consciousness cannot be an object of consciousness and can possess no essence. Sartre, and even more so, Jaques Lacan, use this conception of nothing as the foundation of their atheist philosophy. Equating nothingness with being leads to creation from nothing and hence God is no longer needed for there to be existence.

===Eastern===

The understanding of &quot;nothing&quot; varies widely between cultures, especially between Western and Eastern cultures and philosophical traditions. For instance, &quot;Śūnyatā&quot; (emptiness), unlike &quot;nothingness&quot;, is considered to be a state of mind in some forms of Buddhism (see Nirvana, mu, and Bodhi). Achieving &quot;nothing&quot; as a state of mind in this tradition allows one to be totally focused on a thought or activity at a level of intensity that they would not be able to achieve if they were consciously thinking. A classic example of this is an archer attempting to erase the mind and clear the thoughts to better focus on the shot. Some authors have pointed to similarities between the Buddhist conception of nothingness and the ideas of Martin Heidegger and existentialists like Sartre, although this connection has not been explicitly made by the philosophers themselves.

In some Eastern philosophies, the concept of &quot;nothingness&quot; is characterized by an egoless state of being in which one fully realizes one&#x27;s own small part in the cosmos.

The Kyoto School handles the concept of nothingness as well.

====Taoism====
Laozi and Zhuangzi were both conscious that language is powerless in the face of the ultimate. In Taoist philosophy, however real this world is, its main characteristic is impermanence, whereas the Tao has a permanence that cannot be described, predetermined, or named. In this way the Tao is different from any thing that can be named. It is nonexistence, in other words, nothing.

Taoists also have the related concept of &quot;wu wei&quot;.

== Science ==
Despite the proven existence of vacuum, scientists through the 17th to 19th centuries thought there must be a medium pervading all space that allowed the transmission of light or gravity. Thus, in this period, it was not accepted that complete &quot;nothing&quot; was possible. Theories describing such a medium are collectively known as aether theories, so named as an evocation of the aether, the classical element from Greek philosophy. In particular, the medium that is supposed to allow the transmission of light is called the luminiferous aether. This became the centre of attention after James Clerk Maxwell proposed that light was an electromagnetic wave in 1865.

Early aether theories include those of Robert Hooke (1665) and Christiaan Huygens (1690). Newton also had an aether theory, but to Newton, it was not the medium of transmission since he theorised light was composed of &quot;corpuscles&quot; which moved by simple mechanical motion. He needed the aether instead to explain refraction. Early theories generally proposed a mechanical medium of some sort, allowing the possibility of the same medium supporting both light and gravity. Proof that light has a wave nature, rather than Newton&#x27;s corpuscles, was provided by Thomas Young in his 1803 interference experiment, seemingly confirming the need for an aether. The most well known attempt to detect the existence of the aether was conducted by Albert A. Michelson in an experiment of 1881, later repeated with Edward W. Morley in 1887 with more precision. This failed to show the desired effect, but reluctant to abandon the aether theory, various attempts were made to modify it to account for the Michelson-Morley result. Finally, Albert Einstein, building on the work of Hendrik Lorentz, published his theory of special relativity in 1905 which dispenses entirely with the need for a luminiferous aether to explain the transmission of light.

Although a physical medium was no longer required, the concept of aether still did not entirely vanish. It remained necessary to assign properties to the vacuum for various purposes. In some respects &quot;vacuum&quot; and &quot;aether&quot; are treated as synonyms by science. In modern quantum field theory, a completely empty vacuum is not at zero-point energy, the lowest possible energy state. First proposed by Paul Dirac in 1927, the lowest energy state has constant random vacuum fluctuations which bring into existence short-lived virtual particles. This is somewhat reminiscent of early philosophical plenum ideas, and means that &quot;vacuum&quot; and &quot;nothing&quot; are certainly not synonyms.

== Mathematics ==

Perhaps the best-known usage of the term &quot;nothing&quot; in mathematics is the number 0, which is neither a positive nor negative number. It&#x27;s sometimes included in the set of natural numbers, denoted by formula_1, but it&#x27;s always included in the set of real numbers, denoted by formula_2. &quot;Nothing&quot; can also apply to empty sets, indicated by the symbol formula_3, whose size or cardinality is 0.
