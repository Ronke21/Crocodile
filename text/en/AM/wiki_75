<text>William, Prince of Wales (William Arthur Philip Louis; born 21 June 1982), is the heir apparent to the British throne. He is the elder son of King Charles III and Diana, Princess of Wales.

William was born during the reign of his paternal grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. He was educated at Wetherby School, Ludgrove School and Eton College. He earned a Master of Arts degree in geography at the University of St Andrews where he met his future wife, Catherine Middleton. They have three children: George, Charlotte and Louis. After university, William trained at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst prior to serving with the Blues and Royals regiment. In 2008 he graduated from the Royal Air Force College Cranwell, joining the RAF Search and Rescue Force in early 2009. He served as a full-time pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance for two years, starting in July 2015.

William performs official duties and engagements on behalf of the monarch. He is patron of multiple charitable and military organisations, including the Tusk Trust, Centrepoint, The Passage, Wales Air Ambulance and London&#x27;s Air Ambulance Charity. He undertakes projects through the Royal Foundation, with his charity work revolving around mental health, conservation, homelessness, and emergency workers. In 2020 William launched the Earthshot Prize, a £50 million initiative to incentivise environmental solutions over the next decade.

William was made Duke of Cambridge immediately before his wedding in April 2011. He became Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay upon his father&#x27;s accession to the throne on 8 September 2022. The following day he was made Prince of Wales.

==Early life==
Prince William was born at 21:03 BST on 21 June 1982 in St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London, as the first child of Charles, Prince of Wales (later King Charles III), and his first wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, during the reign of his paternal grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. Buckingham Palace announced his nameWilliam Arthur Philip Louison 28 June. William was christened in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, on 4 August, coinciding with the 82nd birthday of his paternal great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

William was the first child born to a Prince and Princess of Wales since Prince John was born to Prince George and Princess Mary (later King George V and Queen Mary) in July 1905. When he was nine months old, William accompanied his parents on their 1983 tour of Australia and New Zealand, as his first trip overseas. It also marked the first time that a royal baby was taken on an overseas tour. His younger brother, Prince Harry, was born in September 1984. Both of them were raised at Kensington Palace in London, and Highgrove House in Gloucestershire.

Known informally as &quot;Wills&quot; within his family, William was nicknamed &quot;Willy&quot; by his brother and &quot;Wombat&quot; by his mother. Diana wished her sons to obtain broader and more typical life experiences beyond royal upbringing, taking them to Walt Disney World, McDonald&#x27;s, AIDS clinics and shelters for the homeless. The biographer Robert Lacey asserts that William, described as a &quot;rambunctious&quot; and &quot;bratty&quot; child, became &quot;more reflective&quot; with a &quot;noticeably quiet character&quot; as he began boarding school. Diana was reported to have described William as &quot;my little wise old man&quot; on whom she started to rely as her confidant by his early teens.
William carried out his first public engagement while accompanying his parents on a visit to Llandaff on Saint David&#x27;s Day in 1991. He and Harry travelled to Canada on an official visit with their parents in 1991 and again with Charles in 1998. William&#x27;s parents divorced in 1996. Diana died in a car accident in the early hours of 31 August 1997. William, then aged 15, together with his 12-year-old brother and their father, was staying at Balmoral Castle at the time. The following morning, Charles informed William and Harry of their mother&#x27;s death. William was reportedly uncertain as to whether he should walk behind his mother&#x27;s coffin during the funeral procession. His grandfather Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, told him: &quot;If you don&#x27;t walk, I think you&#x27;ll regret it later. If I walk, will you walk with me?&quot;. At the funeral, William and Harry walked alongside their father, grandfather, and maternal uncle, Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, behind the funeral cortège from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey.

After his mother&#x27;s death, William stated that he was &quot;in a state of shock for many years&quot;. He and Harry inherited the majority of the £12.9 million left by their mother on their respective 30th birthdays, a figure that had grown to £10 million each by 2014. In 2014 the brothers inherited their mother&#x27;s wedding dress along with many other of her personal possessions including dresses, diamond tiaras, jewels, letters and paintings. They also received the original lyrics and score of &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; by Bernie Taupin and Elton John as performed by the latter at Diana&#x27;s funeral. In 2002 &quot;The Times&quot; reported that William and Harry would also share £4.9 million from trust funds established by their great-grandmother on their respective 21st birthdays, as well as £8 million upon their respective 40th birthdays.
==Education==
William was educated at private schools, starting at Jane Mynors&#x27; nursery school and the pre-preparatory Wetherby School, both in London. Following this, he attended Ludgrove School near Wokingham, Berkshire, and was privately tutored during summers by the academic Rory Stewart. At Ludgrove, he participated in football, swimming, basketball, clay pigeon shooting, and cross country running. He was subsequently admitted to Eton College, studying geography, biology, and history of art at A-Level. He obtained an &#x27;A&#x27; in geography, a &#x27;C&#x27; in biology, and a &#x27;B&#x27; in history of art. William was captain of the swimming team and his house football team at Eton, also taking up water polo.

The decision to place William at Eton went against the family tradition of sending royal children to Gordonstoun, which his father and grandfather both attended. Diana&#x27;s brother and father were both Eton students. The royal family and the tabloid press agreed that William would be allowed to study free from intrusion in exchange for regular updates about his life. John Wakeham, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, stated &quot;Prince William is not an institution; nor a soap star; nor a football hero. He is a boy: in the next few years, perhaps the most important and sometimes painful part of his life, he will grow up and become a man.&quot; While at Eton, he often had tea on weekends at the nearby Windsor Castle with his grandmother, discussing state boxes and constitutional duties meant to &quot;prepare [him] as future King.&quot;

In June 1991, William was admitted to the Royal Berkshire Hospital after being accidentally hit on the forehead by a fellow pupil wielding a golf club. He suffered a depressed fracture of the skull and was operated on at Great Ormond Street Hospital, resulting in a permanent scar. The incident received widespread media attention. In 1999 he underwent an operation on his left hand after he broke a finger. After completing his studies at Eton, William took a gap year, during which he took part in British Army training exercises in Belize, worked on English dairy farms, and visited Africa. As part of the Raleigh International programme in the town of Tortel in southern Chile, William worked for ten weeks on local construction projects and taught English. He lived with other young volunteers, sharing in the common household chores. His interest in African culture prompted him to teach himself Swahili.

In 2001 William enrolled at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. Similar to his time at Eton, the media agreed not to invade his privacy, and students were warned not to leak stories to the press. William embarked on a degree course in Art History but later changed his main subject to Geography. He focused his dissertation on the Indian Ocean&#x27;s Rodrigues coral reefs and graduated with an undergraduate Master of Arts (MA Hons) degree with upper second class honours in 2005. While at university, he represented the Scottish national universities water polo team at the Celtic Nations tournament in 2004. He was reportedly known as &quot;Steve&quot; by other students to avoid any journalists overhearing and realising his identity.

==Early appointments and duties==
At the age of 21, William was appointed a Counsellor of State; he first served in that capacity when the Queen attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the same year. In July 2005, he embarked on his first solo public engagements on an overseas tour of New Zealand, travelling to participate in World War II commemorations. According to the author Tina Brown, he had, like his father, expressed a desire to become Governor-General of Australia. In 2009 the Queen set up a private office for William and Harry with David Manning as their adviser. Manning accompanied William on his first official tour in January 2010 as the latter toured Auckland and Wellington; William opened the new building of the Supreme Court of New Zealand and was welcomed by a Māori chief. The visit spurred crowds of &quot;many thousands&quot;, with positive public reception compared to that of his mother&#x27;s 1983 tour. In March 2011, William visited Christchurch, New Zealand, shortly after the earthquake, and spoke at the memorial service at Hagley Park on behalf of his grandmother. He also travelled to Australia to visit areas affected by flooding in Queensland and Victoria.

Before attending Sandhurst, William did a three-week internship at several institutions, including the Bank of England, the London Stock Exchange and Lloyd&#x27;s of London. To prepare for his eventual management of the Duchy of Cornwall, in 2014, he entered St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge to undertake an executive agriculture management degree run by the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership (CPSL), of which his father is patron. In April 2019, Kensington Palace announced that William had completed a three-week internship at MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, during which he was tasked with monitoring extreme Islamist terror cells, identifying potential threats abroad, and observing code breaking technology.

===Military and air ambulance service===

Having decided on a military career, William was admitted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in January 2006; his admission was based on successfully completing a 44-week course as an Officer Cadet which led to his commission as a British Army officer. As &quot;Lieutenant Wales&quot;a name based on his father&#x27;s then title Prince of Waleshe followed his brother into the Blues and Royals in December that year as a second lieutenant after which he spent five months training for the post at Bovington Camp in Dorset.

Despite the Queen&#x27;s approval for William to serve on the frontline, his position as second-in-line to the throne at the time cast doubts on his chances of seeing combat. Plans by the Ministry of Defence to send William to Southern Iraq leaked and the government eventually decided against sending him as it would endanger both his life and the lives of people around him if he was targeted. William instead trained in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, obtaining his commission as a sub-lieutenant in the former and a flying officer in the latter, both broadly equivalent to the army rank of lieutenant. After completing his training, he undertook an attachment with the Royal Air Force at RAF Cranwell.

Upon completing the course he was presented with his RAF wings by his father, who had received his own wings after training at Cranwell. During this secondment, William flew to Afghanistan in a C-17 Globemaster that repatriated the body of Trooper Robert Pearson. William was then seconded to train with the Royal Navy. He then completed an accelerated Naval Officer training course at the Britannia Royal Naval College. Whilst serving on HMS &quot;Iron Duke&quot; in July 2008, William participated in a £40m drug seizure in the Atlantic, north-east of Barbados. He was part of the crew on the Lynx helicopter which helped seize 900 kg of cocaine from a speedboat.

In January 2009, William transferred his commission to the RAF and was promoted to Flight Lieutenant. He trained to become a helicopter pilot with the RAF&#x27;s Search and Rescue Force. As part of his training across all branches of the military in 2009, he spent up to six weeks with the Special Air Service, the Special Boat Service, and the Special Reconnaissance Regiment. In January 2010, he graduated from the Defence Helicopter Flying School at RAF Shawbury. In the same month, he transferred to the Search and Rescue Training Unit at RAF Valley, Anglesey, to receive training on the Sea King search and rescue helicopter; he graduated in September 2010. This made him the first member of the British royal family since Henry VII to live in Wales.

William&#x27;s first rescue mission as co-pilot of a RAF Sea King was in response to an emergency call from Liverpool Coastguard in October 2010. In November 2011, he participated in a search-and-rescue mission involving a cargo ship that was sinking in the Irish Sea; William, as a co-pilot, helped rescue two sailors. He was deployed to the Falkland Islands for a six-week tour with No. 1564 Flight from February to March 2012. The Argentine government condemned William&#x27;s deployment to the islands close to the 30th anniversary of the beginning of the Falklands War as a &quot;provocative act&quot;. In June 2012, he gained a qualification to be captain or pilot in command of a Sea King rather than a co-pilot. His active service as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot ended in September 2013. He conducted 156 search and rescue operations, which resulted in 149 people being rescued. He later became patron to the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.

In July 2015, William began working full-time as a pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance (EAAA) based at Cambridge Airport, which he felt was a natural progression from his previous search-and-rescue role. He donated his full salary to the EAAA charity. William required a civil pilot&#x27;s licence and further training before being permitted to begin his role. He underwent part of his training at Norwich Airport. William described working irregular shifts and dealing mostly with critical care cases. He also discussed the impact of witnessing intensive trauma and bereavement on his mental health and personal life. The BBC has written that William was &quot;exposed to the National Health Service in a way that no other senior royal has been or possibly ever will be.&quot;

William left his position with EAAA in July 2017 to assume full-time royal duties. After supporting an anniversary campaign for London&#x27;s Air Ambulance Charity in 2019, he became the charity&#x27;s official patron in March 2020. In May 2020, he granted permission to the charity to use Kensington Palace&#x27;s private lawn to refuel during the COVID-19 pandemic. To mark Air Ambulance Week 2020, he wrote a letter thanking air ambulance workers, stating his &quot;profound respect&quot; for the community, particularly during the &quot;immeasurably difficult&quot; outbreak. In February 2023, he became patron of the Wales Air Ambulance charity.

==Personal life==
===Relationship with Catherine Middleton===
In 2001 William met Catherine Middleton, while they were students in residence at St Salvator&#x27;s Hall, at the University of St Andrews, and they became close friends. She reportedly caught William&#x27;s attention at a charity fashion show at the university in 2002 when she appeared on the stage wearing a see-through lace dress. During their second year, William shared a flat with Middleton and two other friends. The couple began dating in 2003. From 2003 to 2005 they both resided at Balgove House on the Strathtyrum estate with two roommates. In 2004 the couple briefly split but reconciled soon afterwards.

The relationship was followed closely by the tabloid press. Media attention became so intense that William asked the press to keep their distance from Middleton. In December 2006, Middleton and her family attended William&#x27;s passing out parade at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. In April 2007, William and Middleton were reported to have split. Middleton and her family attended the Concert for Diana three months later; the couple were subsequently reported to have &quot;rekindled their relationship&quot;. She also attended the Order of the Garter procession at Windsor Castle in June 2008, where William was made a Royal Knight of the Garter. In June 2010, the couple moved into a cottage on the Bodorgan Estate in Anglesey, Wales, where they resided until 2014.

===Marriage and children===

The couple became engaged in October 2010, at a remote alpine cabin on Mount Kenya, during a 10-day trip to the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy to celebrate William&#x27;s passing the RAF helicopter search and rescue course. Clarence House announced their engagement on 16 November. William gave his fiancée his mother&#x27;s engagement ring. The wedding took place in Westminster Abbey on 29 April 2011. The global audience for the wedding ranged around 300 million, whereas 26 million watched the event live in Britain alone. William and Catherine used Nottingham Cottage as their London home until 2013, when £4.5 million renovations completed at Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace, which continues to be their official residence in the capital. The couple were given the country house Anmer Hall, on the Sandringham Estate, as a wedding gift from the Queen, where they lived from 2015 to 2017. Kensington Palace was the couple&#x27;s main residence until 2022, when the family moved to Adelaide Cottage in Windsor.

Catherine&#x27;s first pregnancy was announced in December 2012. She was admitted on 22 July 2013 to the Lindo Wing of St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London, where Prince William had been delivered. Later that day, she gave birth to Prince George. In September 2014, it was announced that Catherine was pregnant with her second child. She was admitted on 2 May 2015 to the same hospital where she gave birth to Princess Charlotte the same day. Catherine&#x27;s third pregnancy was announced in September 2017; Prince Louis was born on 23 April 2018. William and Catherine have owned two English Cocker Spaniels, named Lupo and Orla.

==Duke of Cambridge==

William was created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn, and Baron Carrickfergus on the day of his wedding in April 2011. He and Catherine toured Canada that summer. Nicholas Witchell, writing for BBC News, noted that the tour to Canada had been an &quot;unqualified success&quot; for the couple as they engaged in various activities from tree planting to street hockey, with their warm interactions and thoughtful gestures enhancing their popularity and reinforcing positive sentiments towards the monarchy in Canada. The couple served as ambassadors for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, during multiple sporting events throughout the games.

In September 2013, William and Catherine visited Singapore, Malaysia, Tuvalu, and the Solomon Islands as part of the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee celebrations. William hosted his first investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace in October that year. In April 2014, he and Catherine undertook a royal tour to New Zealand and Australia accompanied by their son George. In August that year, the couple along with Prince Harry represented the royal family at World War I commemorations in Belgium. In December, the couple visited New York and Washington DC, where William made a speech at the World Bank condemning the illegal trade in wildlife.

In 2015 and 2016 William embarked on various visits of Asian countries, including Japan, China, Bhutan and India; he was the first royal to visit mainland China in almost three decades, with the press referring to William&#x27;s diplomacy as &quot;deft&quot; and &quot;polished&quot;. In response to media allegations of being &quot;work-shy&quot;, he asserted his commitment to his duties, emphasising his dedication to fatherhood and his role in air ambulance work. Countries visited by William and Catherine in 2017 included France, Poland, Germany, and Belgium. In January 2018 the couple visited Sweden and Norway. The visits were, like others, requested by the Foreign Office, and interpreted to benefit UK-European relations post Brexit. In June 2018, William toured Jordan, Israel and Palestine.

William and Catherine toured Pakistan in October 2019, which was the royal family&#x27;s first visit to the country in 13 years. The tour was a success, helping promote diplomatic relations with Pakistan while also reflecting the couple&#x27;s personal interests in climate change and the significance of quality education. In November 2020, it was reported that William had tested positive for COVID-19 in April but decided not to alert the media to &#x27;avoid alarming the nation&#x27;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported he had been &quot;very ill&quot; and had isolated away from his family; other sources said that he had not been seriously ill, not bed-ridden and working for most of the time. In December that year, the couple embarked on a tour of England, Scotland, and Wales via the British royal train &quot;to pay tribute to the inspiring work&quot; of communities and charities in 2020. Boris Johnson expressed his support, while Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon criticised the tour, citing travel restrictions; local governments were consulted before planning the tour.

In William&#x27;s capacity as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, he and Catherine toured the country in May 2021. The couple attended the G7 summit for the first time in June 2021 in Cornwall. In March 2022, they embarked on a tour of Belize, the Bahamas and Jamaica as part of the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Reparations for slavery emerged as a major demand of public protesters during the couple&#x27;s visit. During the unveiling of the National Windrush Monument in London, William described the tour as &quot;an opportunity to reflect&quot; and condemned racism faced by both members of the Windrush generation and British minorities in 2022. In May 2022, he attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time as a counsellor of state, where his father delivered the Queen&#x27;s Speech on behalf of Elizabeth II.

==Prince of Wales==

Queen Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022, and William&#x27;s father succeeded as Charles III. William, now heir apparent, was created Prince of Wales by his father on 9 September. Controversy regarding the title became a topic of public debate in Wales. By 17 September, a petition calling for the end of the title had received more than 30,000 signatures, while a YouGov poll showed 66 per cent support for William to be given the title compared to 22 percent of respondents opposed. On 30 October, Senedd Llywydd Elin Jones noted that an investiture is not a constitutional requirement and suggested that contemporary Wales would deem it unnecessary. Kensington Palace also stated an investiture is &quot;not on the table&quot;. As the eldest son of the British monarch, William has inherited the Duchy of Cornwall, which brings him additional income. The duchy is &quot;a £760 million (about US$1.25 billion) entity established in 1337&quot; to provide a private income to the monarch&#x27;s eldest son.

William and Catherine visited Anglesey and Swansea on 27 September 2022, which marked their first visit to Wales since becoming Prince and Princess of Wales. He visited the Senedd in November 2022, meeting the Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford. In February 2023, William and Catherine visited Falmouth, marking their first visit to the region since becoming Duke and Duchess of Cornwall. In March 2023, he undertook a solo visit to Poland during which he visited Rzeszów to meet Polish and British troops and Ukrainian refugees, and had talks with Polish president Andrzej Duda at the Presidential Palace. In October 2023, William and Catherine condemned the Hamas-led attack on Israel. In February 2024, he visited the headquarters of the British Red Cross, where he met humanitarian aid workers supporting civilians during the Israel–Gaza conflict, and called for an end to the fighting in a statement approved by the UK government. Later that month, William pulled out at the last moment from the thanksgiving service of his godfather, Constantine II of Greece, due to an undisclosed &quot;personal matter&quot;. The same month, he visited Western Marble Arch Synagogue to acknowledge the increase in antisemitism and human suffering in the Middle East. In December 2024, William attended the official reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris after which he held a bilateral meeting with the President-elect of the United States Donald Trump at the ceremony and later held a private meeting with the latter to discuss the relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States.

==Charity work==
William became aware of HIV/AIDS in the mid-1990s when he accompanied his mother and brother on visits to shelters and clinics for patients. In January 2005, he and Harry volunteered at a British Red Cross aid distribution centre to pack emergency supplies for countries affected by the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. Later, in December 2005, William spent two weeks in North Wales with Mountain Rescue England and Wales (MREW). In May 2007, he became patron of MREW and president of the Royal Marsden Hospital, the latter of which was a role previously held by his mother. In January 2025, William was announced as the hospital&#x27;s joint royal patron alongside his wife, Catherine.

In July 2007, William and Harry organised the Concert for Diana, in memory of their mother, which benefitted the charities and patronages of Diana, William, and Harry. In October 2008, the brothers embarked on the 1,000 mile eight-day Enduro Africa motorbike ride across South Africa to raise money for Sentebale, UNICEF and the Nelson Mandela Children&#x27;s Fund. In 2010 William became a patron of 100 Women in Hedge Funds&#x27; philanthropic initiatives for the following three years until 2012. The same year, he succeeded Lord Attenborough as the fifth president of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. In March 2011, he and Catherine set up a gift fund held by The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry to allow well-wishers to donate money to charities supporting the armed forces, children, the elderly, art, sport and conservation in lieu of gifts. The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry is now known as The Royal Foundation of The Prince and Princess of Wales.

===Humanitarian causes===
In March 2020, William appeared in a video for the National Emergencies Trust, launching a fundraising appeal to help charities during the pandemic. The appeal raised £11 million in its first week, eventually totalling to £90 million, with the money going out to &quot;front line charities&quot; and to the UK Community Foundations to be distributed among &quot;local community foundations&quot;. In April 2020, he officially became patron of the organisation. Later that month, he made a surprise appearance on &quot;The Big Night In&quot;, a telethon held during the COVID-19 pandemic, in a skit which he held a video call with Stephen Fry, who reprised his role as (a descendant of) Lord Melchett, from the &quot;Blackadder&quot; series.

In December 2020, William and Catherine became joint patrons of NHS Charities Together. In February 2021, he visited a vaccination centre in King&#x27;s Lynn and later encouraged use of the vaccine, denouncing false information that could cause vaccine hesitancy. In May 2021, William got his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine by NHS staff at the Science Museum in London. In September 2021, it was reported that he had assisted in the evacuation of an Afghan officer, a Royal Military Academy Sandhurst graduate and aide to British troops, from Kabul airport, along with more than 10 of his family members, during the 2021 Taliban offensive. In March 2022 amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, William and Catherine made a donation to help the refugees. In February 2023, they donated to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) which was helping victims of the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake. In July 2023, William became patron of the appeal to launch The Fleming Centre, driving a new global movement to tackle antimicrobial resistance. In July 2024, he and Catherine made donations to help victims of Hurricane Beryl. In January 2025, William was announced as patron of the College of Paramedics.

===Conservation===
William became patron of the Tusk Trust in December 2005, a charity that works towards conserving wildlife and initiating community development across Africa. He carried out his first official duty with the Trust in launching a bike ride across the African continent in April 2008. Later, William helped with launching the Tusk Conservation Awards, which have been presented to selected environmental activists annually since 2013. In June 2010, he and his brother visited Botswana, Lesotho, and South Africa, undertaking projects relating to wildlife, sport, and young children. In 2013 he succeeded his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, as president of Fields in Trust and transitioned into the role of patron in 2024. He established the United for Wildlife Transport Taskforce in December 2014, with the goal of reducing global illegal wildlife trade. In 2014 Jane Goodall stated that William had expressed the view that all ivory in the royal collection needed to be destroyed. William has occasionally commented on the effects of overpopulation on the wildlife of Africa, but his remarks have been criticised in the media for not taking resource consumption and population density into consideration.

After two years of research, William launched the Earthshot Prize in October 2020, designed to provide funding and incentive for environmental solutions over the next decade. Following the launch, he gave a TED Talk on environmental protection and conservation as part of the TED Countdown climate change initiative. Later that month, William took over the patronages of Fauna and Flora International and the British Trust for Ornithology, passed on from his grandparents. In the same month, he appeared in an ITV documentary titled &quot;Prince William: A Planet For Us All&quot; to discuss environmental issues.

In 2021 William made a private donation to the Thin Green Line Foundation, which provides grants for the relatives of conservation park rangers that are killed every year while protecting wildlife. In July 2022, he condemned the murder of South African park ranger Anton Mzimba and asked for the responsible parties to &quot;be brought to justice&quot;. In August 2022, William voiced his support for the prison sentence given to a man in the United States responsible for trafficking rhinoceros horns and elephant ivory. He had previously called for harsher punishments and penalties for poachers and smugglers at the Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference in 2018.

===LGBT rights===

William has spoken out for LGBT rights as part of his work against cyberbullying, stating the importance of being &quot;proud of the person you are&quot; and discussing the effects of online abuse and discrimination. In 2016 he appeared in the July issue of &quot;Attitude&quot; and became the first member of the royal family to be featured on the cover of a gay magazine. He was recognised at the British LGBT Awards in May 2017. William hosted a commemorative Pride Month discussion with mental health charity volunteers at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in June 2023.

===Mental health===
Since 2009, William has been patron of Child Bereavement UK, which provides support to children and families who have lost a loved one. In 2016 the Royal Foundation launched multiple mental health initiatives, including Heads Together, a campaign led by William, Catherine and Harry to de-stigmatise mental health. Legacy programmes include Mental Health at Work, launched in September 2018 to change the approach to workplace mental health in the United Kingdom, as well as Heads Up, launched in May 2019 in partnership with the Football Association, utilising football to affect the conversation surrounding mental health in adults. Later that month, William and Catherine, together with William&#x27;s brother Harry and sister-in-law Meghan, launched Shout, the United Kingdom&#x27;s first 24/7 text messaging service for those who suffer from mental issues. William later volunteered on the crisis helpline during the COVID-19 lockdowns to provide support via text message. He attributes his interest in mental health to his experiences as an air ambulance pilot, his work with the homeless, veterans&#x27; welfare, and his wife&#x27;s anti-addiction advocacy.

In March 2020, William and Catherine began supporting a new mental health initiative by the Public Health England agency amidst the coronavirus pandemic. In April 2020, the couple announced Our Frontline, an initiative providing mental health support to emergency medical workers. In September 2020, William established the Emergency Responders Senior Leaders Board, commissioned by the foundation to research the mental health and wellbeing of emergency responders, in partnership with King&#x27;s College London and the Open University. In May 2021 and 2022, William and Catherine voiced the Mental Health Minute message, which was broadcast on every radio station in the United Kingdom on and asked people to help individuals around them that suffer from loneliness. In October 2022, to mark the World Mental Health Day, the couple took over &quot;Newsbeat&quot; and interviewed four guests on topics related to mental health. In September 2023, William unveiled two organizations that had partnered with the Duchy of Cornwall to raise better mental well-being and provide mental health services for all its tenants. In October 2023 and to mark World Mental Health Day, he and Catherine took part in a forum for young people in Birmingham, alongside BBC Radio 1 and charity called The Mix, called &quot;Exploring our Emotional Worlds&quot; continuing their longstanding work to promote mental well-being. In May 2024, he announced a three-year funding package for the charity We Are Farming Minds to provide mental health support for farmers on the Duchy of Cornwall lands. In December 2024, he and Catherine announced that they were jointly funding a pilot scheme with the charity Norfolk and Waveney Mind to offer extra support for rural and farming communities on the Sandringham estate.

===Homelessness===
In September 2005, William became patron of Centrepoint, a charity that assists the homeless. In December 2009, as part of a Centrepoint-organised event, the prince spent the night in a sleeping bag near Blackfriars Bridge to raise awareness of the experiences of homeless youth. He opened their new facility, Apprenticeship House, in November 2019 to mark their 50th anniversary.

William has been patron of homelessness charity The Passage since 2019 after first visiting the centre in 1993 with his mother. In October 2020, he wrote the introduction to the organisation&#x27;s 40th-anniversary fundraising cookbook, discussing the importance of helping victims of homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2020, William volunteered at the charity to help prepare donation bags for homeless residents in emergency hotel accommodations and spoke with residents about their experiences. In 2022 and 2023, he was spotted selling copies of &quot;The Big Issue&quot; on the streets, copies of which are usually sold by homeless and unemployed people to collect money.

In June 2023, William launched Homewards after two years of development, which aims to &quot;finally end homelessness&quot; in the United Kingdom. The five-year initiative aims to tackle homelessness in six pilot locations across the United Kingdom with an initial seed funding allocated for each area by the Royal Foundation, working with existing private sector and grassroots charity partners. The project focuses on early intervention and providing housing to families before other issues, such as abuse and joblessness, are addressed. In February 2024, William, in partnership with Cornish charity St Petrocs, announced plans for building 24 homes on Duchy of Cornwall land in Nansledan to provide temporary accommodation for people experiencing homelessness in the area. Future plans include building more than 400 social rented homes and a further 475 affordable dwellings in South East Faversham.

===Sport===

William often plays polo to raise money for charity. He is a fan of football, and supports the English club Aston Villa. He became president of England&#x27;s Football Association (FA) in May 2006 and vice-royal patron of the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) in February 2007, supporting the Queen as patron. The same year, the WRU&#x27;s decision to name the Prince William Cup drew criticism as some believed it would have been more appropriate to name it after Ray Gravell. William became patron of the WRU and the FA in 2016 and 2024, respectively.

In December 2010, William, alongside David Cameron, attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon at which Chung suggested a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England. The English delegation reported the suggestion to FIFA, considering it a violation of anti-collusion rules. In 2011 William, as president of the English FA, voted against Australia&#x27;s 2022 FIFA bid and instead voted for South Korea, despite being Australia&#x27;s future heir. In 2020 he voted against the joint Australia–New Zealand 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup bid and instead voted for Colombia.

In February 2021, following an investigation into racism directed at Marcus Rashford, William released a statement as president of the FA, denouncing the &quot;racist abuse... whether on the pitch, in the stands, or on social media&quot; as &quot;despicable&quot; and stating that &quot;we all have a responsibility&quot; to create an environment of tolerance and accountability. In April 2021, William criticised the planned breakaway competition The Super League, adding that he &quot;share[d] the concerns of fans about the proposed Super League and the damage it risks causing to the game we love.&quot; In July 2021, he condemned racist attacks against England football players following their loss at the UEFA Euro 2020 finale.

In May 2007, William became patron of the English Schools&#x27; Swimming Association. In 2012, together with his wife Catherine and brother Harry, William launched Coach Core. The program was set up following the 2012 Olympics and provides apprenticeship opportunities for people who desire to pursue a career as a professional coach. In May 2020, he appeared in a BBC One Documentary titled &quot;Football, Prince William and Our Mental Health&quot; as a part of a campaign to promote men to discuss their mental issues using football as a common medium.

Both William and Harry are enthusiastic motorcyclists; William owns a Ducati 1198 S Corse. In May 2014, William, like his father and grandfather, became president of the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC). He also took part in a bandy event in Stockholm in January 2018.

In November 2022, William was criticised by Welsh football followers and Welsh actor Michael Sheen for holding the Prince of Wales title whilst having affiliations with the England national football team, particularly after he presented jerseys to the squad in advance of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in which both Wales and England were placed in the same Group B. William commented that he had supported the England football team from a very young age, but happily supported Welsh rugby union, of which he is patron, over England. In August 2023, he was criticised in segments of the press and social media for not attending 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup final in Australia as president of the FA.

==Public image==

William has been one of the most popular members of the British royal family since his birth. Having lived a public life since birth, he was regarded as a &quot;heartthrob&quot; and eligible as a young adult, similar to his father. Ruth La Ferla of &quot;The New York Times&quot; contrasted William&#x27;s &quot;refined&quot; and &quot;polite&quot; appeal to Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s &quot;bad-boy&quot; popularity. Following his marriage, William&#x27;s public image assumed a more &quot;staid&quot; and fatherly demeanour, having &quot;settled into a stable domestic order&quot;.

The journalist Anne McElvoy has described William&#x27;s public personality as a &quot;genial presence&quot; with a &quot;tougher side&quot;, alongside his mother&#x27;s &quot;inimitable style&quot;. Much of his royal duties focus on &quot;big bet&quot; projects, rather than &quot;plaques and patronages&quot;. In 2016 William gave an interview stating his goal was &quot;how do I make the royal family relevant in the next 20 years ... that&#x27;s the challenge for me&quot;.

In April 2011, &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed him as one of the most influential people in the world alongside his then-newlywed wife Catherine. In August 2023, Gallup, Inc. named him as the most popular public figure in the US after conducting a survey that asked for people&#x27;s views on 15 prominent individuals. He was found to be the most popular member of the royal family by statistics and polling company YouGov in December 2022 and September 2023, and as the second most popular in April 2024. In December 2024, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; included William in its annual list of best-dressed celebrities.

==Privacy and the media==
The death of William&#x27;s mother while being chased by the paparazzi in August 1997 has since influenced his attitude towards the media. He and Catherine have often requested that, when off-duty, their privacy should be respected. In 2005 William spoke with ITV reporter Tom Bradby and concluded that it was likely that their voicemails were being accessed. An investigation under then Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke concluded that the compromised voice mail accounts belonged to William&#x27;s aides, including Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, and not the prince himself. However, Clive Goodman later stated that he had hacked William&#x27;s phone on 35 occasions. Andy Coulson, the editor of &quot;News of the World&quot; from 2003 to 2007, apologised to William and his brother for invading their privacy, accepting &quot;ultimate responsibility&quot; for the actions of Goodman. William later sued News Group Newspapers, publisher of &quot;News of the World&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot;, which resulted in an out-of-court settlement in 2020. He and his brother Harry brought a claim privately through their mutual attorneys, but Harry later pursued his case separately with a new solicitor.

In 2005, after his then-girlfriend Catherine Middleton was chased by the paparazzi on her way to a job interview, William consulted Middleton and her father and wrote a legal letter to newspapers requesting that they respect her privacy. As media attention increased around the time of Middleton&#x27;s 25th birthday in January 2007, he issued a public statement mentioning that &quot;the situation is proving unbearable for all those concerned.&quot; In October 2007, William issued a public statement via his press secretary complaining about the &quot;aggressive pursuit&quot; by &quot;photographers on motorcycles, in vehicles and on foot&quot; while the couple were leaving a London nightclub and later driving in his car. Following the statement, &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, and &quot;Daily Express&quot; all decided against using the paparazzi photos of the couple, but &quot;The Sun&quot; published photos taken before the couple&#x27;s car had left. The statement prompted the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) to issue a warning, asking editors not to publish photographs which were taken through harassment. In April 2009, William&#x27;s lawyers obtained an apology from &quot;The Daily Star&quot; after the tabloid had claimed he had &quot;wrecked&quot; a $2m plane during his pilot training.

In September 2012, the French edition of &quot;Closer&quot; and Italian gossip magazine &quot;Chi&quot; published photographs of Catherine sun-bathing topless while on holiday at the Château d&#x27;Autet in Provence. William and Catherine filed a criminal complaint with the French prosecution department and launched a claim for civil damages at the &quot;Tribunal de Grande Instance de Nanterre&quot;. The following day the courts granted an injunction against &quot;Closer&quot; prohibiting further publication of the photographs and announced that a criminal investigation would be initiated. In September 2017, &quot;Closer&quot; was fined €100,000 and its editor Laurence Pieau and owner Ernesto Mauri were each fined €45,000.

In October 2014, William and Catherine sent a legal letter to a freelance photographer who had put their son George and his nanny &quot;under surveillance&quot;, asking the individual to stop &quot;harassing and following&quot; them. In August 2015, Kensington Palace published a letter detailing what it stated were the &quot;dangerous&quot; and invasive efforts of the media to get paparazzi pictures of Prince George and Princess Charlotte.

In November 2016, William issued a statement supporting Prince Harry and his then-girlfriend, Meghan Markle, following their complaints about the press intrusion, stating that he &quot;understands the situation concerning privacy and supports the need for Prince Harry to support those closest to him.&quot; During a visit to the BBC studios in central London in November 2018, he publicly criticised the social media firms&#x27; approach to handling &quot;misinformation and conspiracy&quot; and added, &quot;Their self-image is so grounded in their positive power for good that they seem unable to engage in constructive discussion about the social problems they are creating&quot;.

In June 2022, a three-minute video of William confronting Terry Harris, a paparazzi photographer, was posted on Harris&#x27; YouTube channel. It was recorded by Harris in January 2021 and shows William arguing with Harris as the latter attempts to film William&#x27;s family on a bike ride near Anmer Hall. Kensington Palace described the video as a breach of the family&#x27;s privacy and asked for it to be removed from public websites. The couple&#x27;s lawyers also contacted the photographer, who claimed he was on public roads and had filmed the video after hearing about allegations that the couple had broken the &quot;rule of six&quot; as they toured a public attraction at Sandringham while William&#x27;s uncle and aunt, then Earl and Countess of Wessex, and their children happened to be in the same spot.

==Titles, styles, and honours==
===Titles and styles===
William has been a British prince since birth, and was known as &quot;Prince William of Wales&quot; until April 2011. He was created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus by his grandmother, Elizabeth II, on the day of his wedding. The letters patent granting these titles were issued on 26 May that year.

As the eldest son of the monarch, William automatically became Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland on the accession of his father on 8 September 2022. From 8 to 9 September, William was styled as &quot;His Royal Highness the Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge&quot;. On 9 September, Charles announced the creation of William as Prince of Wales, the traditional title for the male heir apparent to the British monarch. William has since been known as &quot;His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales&quot;, except in Scotland, where he is called &quot;His Royal Highness the Duke of Rothesay&quot; instead. The letters patent formally granting him this title and that of Earl of Chester were issued on 13 February 2023.

===Honours===
William is a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter (KG), an Extra Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle (KT), Great Master of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath (GCB), a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom (PC), and a Personal Aide-de-Camp (ADC) to the sovereign.

==Ancestry ==
William&#x27;s ancestry is royal and aristocratic. Patrilineally, he is a member of the House of Windsor and also descends from the House of Oldenburg, one of Europe&#x27;s oldest royal houses. More specifically, he descends from the cadet branch known as the House of Glücksburg.

Through his mother, William descends from the Earls Spencera cadet branch of the Spencer family descended from the Earls of Sunderland (the senior branch are now also Dukes of Marlborough); the Barons Fermoy; and more anciently from Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, and Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmondtwo illegitimate sons of King Charles II. As king, William would be the first monarch since the death of Anne in 1714 to undisputedly descend from Charles I and the first to descend from Charles II.
William descends matrilineally from Eliza Kewark, a housekeeper for his 18th-century ancestor Theodore Forbesa Scottish merchant who worked for the East India Company in Surat. She is variously described in contemporary documents as &quot;a dark-skinned native woman&quot;, &quot;an Armenian woman from Bombay&quot;, and &quot;Mrs. Forbesian&quot;. Genealogist William Addams Reitwiesner assumed Kewark was Armenian. In June 2013, it was reported that genealogical DNA tests on two of William&#x27;s distant matrilineal cousins confirm Kewark was matrilineally of Indian descent.

<text>Humphrey Richard Adeane Lyttelton (23 May 1921 – 25 April 2008), also known as Humph, was an English jazz musician and broadcaster from the Lyttelton family.

Having taught himself the trumpet at school, Lyttelton became a professional musician, leading his own eight-piece band, which recorded a hit single, &quot;Bad Penny Blues&quot;, in 1956. As a broadcaster, he presented BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;The Best of Jazz&quot; for forty years, and hosted the comedy panel game &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; on BBC Radio 4, becoming the UK&#x27;s oldest panel game host.

Lyttelton was also a cartoonist, collaborating on the long-running &quot;Flook&quot; series in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, and a calligrapher and president of The Society for Italic Handwriting.

==Early life and career==
Lyttelton was born at Eton College (then in Buckinghamshire), where his father, George William Lyttelton (second son of the 8th Viscount Cobham), was a house master. (As a male-line descendant of Charles Lyttelton, Lyttelton was in remainder to both the Viscountcy Cobham and the Barony of Lyttelton.) From Sunningdale Preparatory School, Lyttelton duly progressed to Eton College. He was a first cousin of the 10th Viscount Cobham and of Viola Grosvenor, Duchess of Westminster and a great-nephew of the politician and sportsman Alfred Lyttelton, the first man to represent England at both football and cricket, both of whom also attended Eton.

At Eton, Lyttelton fagged for Lord Carrington and formed his love of jazz. He was inspired by the trumpeters Louis Armstrong (who subsequently referred to Lyttelton as &quot;that cat in England who swings his ass off&quot;) and Nat Gonella. He taught himself the instrument, and formed a quartet at the school in 1936 that included the future journalist Ludovic Kennedy on drums.

After leaving school, Lyttelton spent some time at the Port Talbot steel plate works in South Wales, an experience which led to his becoming what he termed a &quot;romantic socialist&quot;. After being called up for war service, he was commissioned in the Grenadier Guards as a second lieutenant on 29 November 1941 alongside future politician Mark Bonham Carter, and saw action at Salerno, Italy, during Operation Avalanche, when he came ashore with his pistol in one hand, and his trumpet in the other.

On VE Day, 8 May or 9 May 1945, Lyttelton joined in the celebrations by playing his trumpet from a wheelbarrow, inadvertently giving his first broadcast performance; the BBC recording still survives. Following demobilisation after World War II, he attended Camberwell Art College for two years.

In 1949, he joined the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; as a cartoonist, where he remained until 1956. He was one of the collaborators with Wally Fawkes on the long-running cartoon strip &quot;Flook&quot;.

==The jazzman==

Lyttelton received a grant for further study. He went to Camberwell School of Art, where he met Wally Fawkes, a fellow jazz enthusiast and clarinet-player, also known as the cartoonist &quot;Trog&quot;. In 1949, Fawkes helped him to get a job with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; writing the words for &quot;Flook&quot;, Fawkes&#x27;s comic strip. They had both joined the George Webb Dixielanders in 1947. Webb was an important catalyst in the British postwar jazz boom.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s Lyttelton was prominent in the British revival of traditional jazz forms from New Orleans, recording with Sidney Bechet in 1949. To do so he had to break with the Musicians&#x27; Union restrictive practices which forbade working with jazz musicians from the United States. In 1956, he had his only pop chart hit, with the Joe Meek-produced recording of &quot;Bad Penny Blues&quot;, which was in the UK Singles Chart for six weeks.

Over time, Lyttelton gradually shifted to a more mainstream approach favoured by American musicians such as trumpeter Buck Clayton. By 1953 he had begun to add saxophonists to the lineup. On one occasion in that year, the development did not meet with the approval of his fans. At a Birmingham Town Hall concert at which alto saxophonist Bruce Turner debuted, a banner with the words &quot;Go Home Dirty Bopper!&quot; was prominently unfolded.

Occasionally, with the help of Eddie Harvey, he assembled a big band for BBC broadcasts and records. In 1957 and 1958 blues singer Jimmy Rushing toured England with the band, as did Clayton, Vic Dickenson and Big Joe Turner in 1965. Clayton recorded with Lyttelton in the early 1960s and toured with the band on numerous occasions. Clayton considered himself and Lyttelton to be brothers. He also recorded with visiting Americans Al Casey, Buddy Tate, and Kenny Davern.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1958, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre.

By now his repertoire had expanded, including not only lesser known Duke Ellington pieces, but even &quot;The Champ&quot; from Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s band book. The Lyttelton band — he saw himself primarily as a leader — helped develop the careers of many now prominent British musicians, including Tony Coe and Alan Barnes.

In 1983, Lyttelton formed Calligraph Records, which reissued some of his old recordings, all future recordings by his band, and recordings by band members.

On 11 March 2008, he announced that he would cease presenting BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Best of Jazz&quot;.

On 23 July 2008, Lyttelton was posthumously named BBC Radio 2 Jazz Artist of the Year, voted by radio listeners.

==Humphrey Lyttelton Band==

For several years during the postwar period at 100 Oxford Street his regular band included Wally Fawkes, the Christie brothers, Pat Hawes and Johnny Parker. From 1958, Lyttelton&#x27;s favoured line-up was an eight–piece band with three saxophones (alto, tenor and baritone), although this was reduced to seven occasionally to save money. But he would sometimes add the baritone again for broadcasts and recordings.

Lyttelton&#x27;s mainstream band usually included such established musicians as Jimmy Skidmore, Joe Temperley, Kathy Stobart, Jimmy Hastings, Mike McKenzie, John Barnes, Roy Williams and Pete Strange along with new talent such as Tony Coe, Alan Barnes, John Picard, Karen Sharpe, and Jo Fooks. Lyttelton regarded his band as a family, with some members returning to the fold after periods away and/or staying for long periods (Bruce Turner, Stan Greig, Adrian Macintosh, Stobart, Hastings).

The band maintained a busy schedule, frequently performing sold-out shows across the country. Performances occasionally included a guest singer, or a collaboration with another band. During the 1990s the band toured with Helen Shapiro in a series of &quot;Humph and Helen&quot; concerts. They also featured in several Giants of British Jazz tours with Acker Bilk and George Melly and John Chilton&#x27;s Feetwarmers.

Lyttelton had a long established professional relationship with UK singer Elkie Brooks. After working together in the early 1960s they rekindled their working partnership in early 2000 with a series of sold-out and well-received concert performances. In early 2000, the band played on the track &quot;Life in a Glasshouse&quot; on Radiohead&#x27;s album &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, released the following year. In 2003, they released the critically acclaimed album &quot;Trouble in Mind&quot; and continued to perform occasional concerts. Lyttelton introduced American vocalist Stacey Kent to British audiences.

Lyttelton&#x27;s last band featured, apart from himself on trumpet and clarinet: Ray Wordsworth on trombone; Jimmy Hastings on alto sax, clarinet and flute; Jo Fooks on tenor saxophone and flute; Rob Fowler on tenor sax, baritone sax and clarinet; Ted Beament on piano; John Rees-Jones on double bass and Adrian Macintosh on drums. His last formal recordings, one track each on trumpet and clarinet, appeared on his last CD &#x27;Cornucopia 3&#x27;, (CLG CD 46) all of which he supervised. Trumpet on the other tracks was played by Tony Fisher. He made some recordings as a vocalist.

After his death, part of Lyttelton&#x27;s appearance with his 2007 Band, (with Karen Sharpe instead of Robert Fowler), at the Brecon Jazz Festival, in which he was joined by American tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton was shown by BBCtv as a tribute, (&quot;Humph&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;). The band continues to give concerts performing his music. The trumpet part is played by Tony Fisher with occasional guest spots by singer Sue Richardson and ex–Lytteltonians such as Karen Sharp.

From 1967 until April 2007, Lyttelton presented &quot;The Best of Jazz&quot; on BBC Radio 2, a programme that featured his idiosyncratic mix of recordings from all periods of the music&#x27;s history, including current material. In 2007 he chose to cut his commitment to two quarterly seasons per year, in order to spend more time on other projects.

In 1972 Lyttelton was chosen to host the comedy panel game &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; (&quot;ISIHAC&quot;) on BBC Radio 4. The show was originally devised as a comedic antidote to traditional BBC panel games (both radio and television), which had come to be seen as dull and formulaic, and in keeping with the staid middle-class &quot;Auntie Beeb&quot; image. Lyttelton continued in this role until shortly before he died, and was known for both his deadpan, disgruntled, and occasionally bewildered style of chairmanship, and for his near-the-knuckle double entendres and innuendo which, despite always being open to an innocent interpretation, were, according to William Rushton, &quot;the filthiest thing on radio&quot;.

The programme&#x27;s success had considerable influence on the manner in which comedy was presented on radio, and Lyttelton&#x27;s persona was a significant part of that success: he was a straight man surrounded by mayhem. At the time of his death, Lyttelton was the oldest active panel game host in the UK, being two and a half years older than his closest rival, Nicholas Parsons.

As well as his other activities, Lyttelton was a keen calligrapher and President of The Society for Italic Handwriting. He named his own record label &quot;Calligraph&quot; after this extracurricular interest. This label, founded in the early 1980s, not only issues his own albums and those of associates, but also re-issues (on CD) his analogue recordings for the Parlophone label in the 1950s. He is reported to have turned down a knighthood in 1995.

==Personal life==

Lyttelton was married twice. His first wife was Patricia Mary Braithwaite (born 1929), whom he married on 19 August 1948. They had one daughter, Henrietta (born 1949). In 1952, following his divorce, he married (Elizabeth) Jill Richardson (1933–2006), with whom he had two sons and a daughter, Stephen (born 1955) and David (born 1958), and Georgina (born 1963).

Despite his celebrity, he was intensely private. He designed his house in Arkley, Barnet, Greater London, with blank walls on the outside and the windows opening onto an internal courtyard. He hated using the telephone and kept his number ex-directory, changing it if anybody else discovered it. Given his dislike of the telephone, he communicated by post, including letters hiring and firing members of his band.

He twice refused state honours which were offered to him. One occasion was in 1976, and in 1994 he declined the knighthood offered by Downing Street: his son Stephen later wrote that &quot;Accepting it was never an option but he still felt sick to the stomach. He kept it from all of us, especially my mother who would have exerted a lot of pressure on him to accept, seeing it as recognition for all his work.&quot;

==Illness and death==
On 18 April 2008, Jon Naismith, the producer of &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t A Clue&quot;, announced the cancellation of the spring series due to Lyttelton&#x27;s hospitalisation to repair an aortic aneurysm. Rob Brydon and others were asked to deputise for Lyttelton during the tour shows, but Lyttelton postponed his operation and managed to perform on all but the last night. A further email on 21 April 2008 reported that the BBC were &quot;unclear precisely how long Humph&#x27;s recovery period will be&quot; but Lyttelton was &quot;otherwise fine and in very good spirits&quot;.

On 22 April 2008, Lyttelton and the &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; team were booked to appear in the stage version of the programme at the Pavilion Theatre, Bournemouth. Because of his illness, his place was taken by Rob Brydon, but a pre-recorded message from Lyttelton was played to the audience (&quot;I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t be with you today as I am in hospital — I wish I&#x27;d thought of this sooner!&quot;). The panellists on that night were Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden, Barry Cryer and Jeremy Hardy.

Lyttelton died following his surgery on 25 April 2008, with his family around him. After his death was reported, members of the public began leaving flowers at Mornington Crescent station. BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 1995 episode of &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; as a tribute on Sunday 27 April, and a retrospective programme presented by Kenneth Clarke on Wednesday 30 April 2008. Radio 4 celebrated &quot;Humphrey Lyttelton Day&quot; on Sunday 15 June 2008, including a new profile of &quot;ISIHAC&quot; by Stephen Fry called &quot;Chairman Humph — A Tribute&quot;.

After his death, the controller of Radio 4, Mark Damazer, said: &quot;He&#x27;s just a colossally good broadcaster and possessed of this fantastic sense of timing. ... It&#x27;s a very, very sad day but we should celebrate and be very grateful for how much he did for Radio 4, really terrific.&quot;

Responding to news of Lyttelton&#x27;s death, Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood wrote on the band&#x27;s website: &quot;We were all sorry to hear of Humphrey Lyttelton&#x27;s death — he was an inspiring person to record with, and without his direction, we&#x27;d never have recorded/released &#x27;Life in a Glasshouse&#x27;. So go and find &#x27;Bad Penny Blues&#x27;, and celebrate his life with some hot jazz.&quot;

Lyttelton is survived by his four children: a daughter from his first marriage to Pat Braithwaite, and two sons and a daughter from his second marriage to Jill Richardson. Richardson, to whom he had been married since 1952, predeceased him in 2006. His Humanist funeral took place on 6 May 2008 at the St Marylebone Crematorium (which shares grounds with East Finchley Cemetery) in East Finchley, north London. Lyttelton regarded himself as a Humanist.

On 25 April 2010, two years after Lyttelton&#x27;s death, a celebratory concert entitled &quot;Humphrey Lyttelton — A Celebration Concert&quot; was held at the Hammersmith Apollo to celebrate his life, works and contribution to music. Singer Elkie Brooks and many prominent British jazz musicians appeared at the concert, along with panellists from &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;. The event was organised and hosted by his son Stephen Lyttelton, who is also the founder and Chairman of The Humph Trust, an organisation set up after his death to support young up and coming jazz musicians and to provide sponsorship and support.

The event was opened by the 2010 winner of the Humphrey Lyttelton Royal Academy of Music Jazz Award, Tom Walsh, who played Horace Silver&#x27;s &quot;Song for my Father&quot; with his quintet from the Royal Academy of Music.

The Lyttelton Arms pub, opposite Mornington Crescent station in Camden, is named after Lyttelton. It was formerly named The Southampton Arms.

<doc id="72204" wikidata="Q3062172" url="?curid=72204" title="Trillium chloropetalum">
<text>Trillium chloropetalum, also known as giant trillium, giant wakerobin, or common trillium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melanthiaceae. It is endemic to the western U.S. state of California, being especially frequent in and around the San Francisco Bay Area.

==Description==
&quot;Trillium chloropetalum&quot; is a perennial, clump-forming herbaceous plant with a thick underground rhizome. Like all trilliums, it has a whorl of three bracts (leaves) and a single trimerous flower with 3 sepals, 3 petals, two whorls of 3 stamens each, and 3 carpels fused into a single ovary with 3 stigmas. Since its flower has no stalk, &quot;T. chloropetalum&quot; belongs to subgenus &quot;Sessilia&quot;, the sessile-flowered trilliums. It is one of the largest of all &quot;Trillium&quot; species, with a scape (stem) from long. The bracts are broadly ovate, long and wide, usually with brownish mottling but sometimes unmottled. Petal color is highly variable, typically ranging from pale greenish yellow to greenish bronze (or purplish green) to dark purple. A variety that lacks yellow pigments has petal colors ranging from white to reddish-purple. The flower petals enclose purple stamens, long, and a purple ovary. Flowering occurs from late February to early April.

In the San Francisco Bay Area, a white-petaled form of &quot;T. chloropetalum&quot; is often confused with &quot;T. albidum&quot;, which also has white petals. The former is distinguished by the purple pigment in its anther connective tissue, a character lacking in &quot;T. albidum&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
In 1856, John Torrey described &quot;Trillium sessile&quot; var. &quot;chloropetalum&quot; based on a specimen collected by John Milton Bigelow two years earlier in the &quot;redwoods&quot; of California. At the time, Bigelow was exploring the valleys and tributaries of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, but the precise original location of his specimen remains unknown. In 1903, Thomas Jefferson Howell described the species &quot;Trillium chloropetalum&quot; based on Torrey&#x27;s variety. The epithet &quot;chloropetalum&quot; means &quot;green-petaled&quot;.

In 1975, John Daniel Freeman published an influential revision of subgenus &quot;Sessilia&quot; that included the description of a new species &quot;Trillium albidum&quot; and a completely new circumscription of &quot;Trillium chloropetalum&quot; . By separating out white-flowered &quot;T. albidum&quot;, Freeman was able to provide a rational circumscription of &quot;T. chloropetalum&quot; that includes the following taxa:

* &quot;Trillium chloropetalum&quot; var. &quot;chloropetalum&quot;
* &quot;Trillium chloropetalum&quot; var. &quot;giganteum&quot; 

The petals of &quot;T. chloropetalum&quot; var. &quot;chloropetalum&quot; always show yellow pigments but these are often masked by purple or other pigments. In contrast, the petals of &quot;T. chloropetalum&quot; var. &quot;giganteum&quot; lack yellow pigments altogether. The former is characterized by the green-petaled form described by Torrey while the latter includes a white-flowered form of &quot;T. chloropetalum&quot; distinguished from &quot;T. albidum&quot; by the presence of dark purple stamens and carpels.

Freeman&#x27;s treatment of &quot;Trillium chloropetalum&quot; is widely (if not universally) accepted. Some authorities consider &quot;Trillium chloropetalum&quot; var. &quot;giganteum&quot; to be a synonym for &quot;Trillium chloropetalum&quot;, but even those authorities cite Freeman.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Trillium chloropetalum&quot; is endemic to California. Some authorities claim the species ranges across ten California counties, from Monterey County on the central California coast to Lake County in the north central part of the state:

* Alameda, Contra Costa, Lake, Marin, Monterey, Napa, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Sonoma

Other authorities claim that &quot;T. chloropetalum&quot; has a broader range that extends northward to Siskiyou County or southward to Santa Barbara County.

&quot;T. chloropetalum&quot; is found at the edges of redwood forests and chaparral, usually on moist slopes, canyon banks, and alluvial soils.

==Uses==

The variety &quot;Trillium chloropetalum&quot; var. &quot;giganteum&quot;, with its deep maroon flower petals, gained the Award of Garden Merit (AGM) from the Royal Horticultural Society in 1993.

<doc id="72206" wikidata="Q309845" url="?curid=72206" title="Ricimer">
<text>Ricimer ( , ; – 19 August 472) was a Romanized Germanic general, who ruled the remaining territory of the Western Roman Empire from 456 after defeating Avitus, until his death in 472, with a brief interlude in which he contested power with Procopius Anthemius. Deriving his power from his position as &quot;magister militum&quot; of the Western Empire, Ricimer exercised political control through a series of puppet emperors. Ricimer&#x27;s death led to unrest across Italy and the establishment of a Germanic kingdom on the Italian Peninsula.

==Lineage==
The date of Ricimer&#x27;s birth is unknown. Some scholars have dated it as late as the early 430s, which would have made him unusually young when he rose to power. A birthdate of around 418 is more likely. The names of his parents are also unknown. In his panegyric to Anthemius, given in 468, the poet Sidonius Apollinaris claimed that Ricimer was Suevic on his father&#x27;s side and Visigothic on his mother&#x27;s, specifying that his maternal grandfather was Wallia, King of the Visigoths, who died in 418. It has been suggested that his Suevic father may have been a son of Hermeric, the king of the Suevi around 418, or else possibly Hermegarius, a Suevic war leader who died in 429. 

It has been surmised that Ricimer was the offspring of a marriage alliance between the ruling Suevic and Gothic houses and although Ricimer&#x27;s father was identified as a Sueve, his identity is more frequently attested as Gothic by ancient writers. Such an alliance has been suggested as occurring in the year 431, but a more likely date is anterior to Wallia&#x27;s death in 418. Wallia&#x27;s Visigothic successors were not his close relatives and may have been hostile toward the family members of the former king. 

As entry into the Western Empire&#x27;s military was a frequent option for &quot;losers of struggles for leadership among the barbarians&quot;, Ricimer&#x27;s family may have entered the service of Rome. Historian Peter Heather suggests that the lack of stability among the Visigoths themselves may have incentivized Ricimer&#x27;s pursuit of an &quot;entirely Roman career&quot;, despite being &quot;the grandson of the Visigothic king Wallia&quot;.

Like many Germanic figures of note, Ricimer had relational ties to other tribes, like the Burgundians. For instance, Gundobad, Ricimer&#x27;s &quot;subordinate and successor&quot;, was his nephew since his sister had married the Burgundian king Gondioc.

==Rise to power==
According to Sidonius Apollinaris, Ricimer served under the &quot;magister militum&quot; Flavius Aetius alongside the &quot;comes domesticorum&quot; Majorian, whom he befriended. Historian Penny MacGeorge writes, &quot;Majorian certainly, and Ricimer probably, had served under Aetius, and there may have been other elements to this connection, political, personal, and social, that would have brought them both close to the centers of political power.&quot;

Nonetheless, a power vacuum was created in the Western Empire after the events of 454 and 455, which saw the consecutive murders of Aetius and of the Western Emperor Valentinian III, who had been responsible for the &quot;magister militum&quot; assassination. After the assassinations, the Roman Senator Petronius Maximus proclaimed himself emperor. Petronius&#x27;s reign lasted less than three months, as shortly before the Vandal sacking of Rome in 455, he too was murdered. 

After Rome&#x27;s sack, the Visigothic King Theodoric II proclaimed Avitus as Emperor, the Roman military commander in Gaul. In return for Theodoric II&#x27;s support, Avitus agreed to allow the Visigoths to enter Suevi-controlled Hispania. After being proclaimed the new emperor in 456, Avitus mounted a campaign into Italy but was defeated in the Po Valley. In the interim, Avitus had named the Visigoth Remistus as &quot;magister militum&quot;. 

Following the arrival of Avitus in Rome, Majorian gave his support, albeit reluctantly, to the new emperor. Avitus is subsequently thought to have appointed Ricimer as &quot;comes&quot;, a prominent military position, but this remains unclear and it is possible that Ricimer was &quot;comes&quot; before the elevation of Avitus. At this point, however, the Western Empire encompassed only the Italian Peninsula and portions of southern Gaul, a mere fraction of the territory held by imperial Rome in previous centuries. Ricimer, nonetheless, raised an army and navy from the Germanic mercenaries available to him and commenced campaigns directed against &quot;barbarian&quot; tribes in conflict with the empire. Ricimer achieved his first important victory in 456, when he defeated the Vandals in the Battle of Agrigentum and the Battle of Corsica. Although Priscus writes that Avitus had sent him to Sicily to engage the Vandals, Hydatius states Ricimer defeated the Vandals near Corsica.

===The revolt against Avitus===
Vandal raids and civil disaffection—due in part to famine—proved problematic for Avitus. Not only was he never recognized as Emperor of the West by the eastern Emperor Marcian, Avitus found himself in an especially precarious position since disruptive events had hardly settled when Ricimer and Majorian rebelled against their former patron. The two led an army against Avitus&#x27;s imperial forces commanded by the &quot;magister militum&quot; Remistus, whom they defeated; Remistus was executed at Ravenna in September 456 under &quot;obscure circumstances&quot;. Avitus fled to Gaul to gather support from his Visigothic and Gallic followers but was defeated in the Battle of Placentia on 17 October 456. Avitus was captured, deposed, and forced to assume the bishopric of Piacenza, and finally executed—allegedly starved to death by Majorian and Ricimer.
===Majorian (457–461)===
As Ricimer gained influence over the Germanic peoples occupying Gaul, Hispania, and Northern Africa, the sources suggest he and Majorian were operating in concert to seize power; the latter would become the future emperor, while Ricimer would command the military. Since Ricimer was a Germanic tribesman of Arian religious disposition, he was ineligible for the imperial throne himself. Whether or not he wished to be emperor is unknown, but in many respects, Ricimer can be viewed as an &quot;heir of Stilicho&quot;, a barbarian general who served the Roman Empire faithfully. 

With the throne of the Western Empire vacant, the Alamanni invaded Italy. They moved from Raetia and managed to reach Lake Maggiore on the south side of the Alps. Majorian led his field army north to fight the Alamanni, and defeated them. Reaching an agreement with Ricimer, Majorian was proclaimed emperor on 1 April 457. Realizing Majorian&#x27;s potential as a puppet, Ricimer induced Leo to give his consent to this arrangement and on 28 December 457, Majorian&#x27;s elevation to Emperor in the West was officially recognized by Constantinople.

Leo may not have actually wanted to see Majorian on the throne, but he was in &quot;no position to object&quot; since Majorian had a coalition that included the palatinate at Ravenna, Ricimer&#x27;s Italian army, the Gallo-Roman general Aegidius, and Theodoric the Great. Leo also granted Ricimer the rank of . 

Majorian proved to be quite a capable ruler, to such a degree that historian Michael Grant claims he was &quot;the last competent emperor the west ever produced&quot;. The new emperor demonstrated his military skill via campaigns in Gaul and Hispania against the Vandals and the Visigoths—atop instituting diplomatic and economic reforms—which greatly increased Majorian&#x27;s standing among the senate and army, prompting Sidonius to produce a panegyric. Sometime in 458, Majorian staved off an Alamanni attack on Raetia and a Vandal assault on Campania. In 460, Majorian then prepared to lead a campaign by embarking from Spain against the Vandals of King Gaiseric. However, before the invasion was launched, the bulk of Majorian&#x27;s fleet was sunk in the harbor at Cartagena, resulting in a blow to Roman prestige and to Majorian&#x27;s reputation, which Ricimer exploited. 

During his absence, Ricimer convinced the senate to turn against the emperor, who soon disbanded his army and returned to Italy. Learning that the emperor was in Tortona, Ricimer led a detachment there and arrested him. With the Western throne vacant, the new Eastern Emperor, Leo I, appointed Ricimer to replace Majorian in his Italian command. Without a Western Emperor, Leo hoped to use Ricimer as his effective vice-regent in the West. Deposing Majorian on 3 August 461, Ricimer had the emperor tortured and finally beheaded.

===Libius Severus (461–465)===
Ricimer&#x27;s murder of Majorian did not sit well with some portions of the military establishment, especially the commanding general in Gaul, Aegidius, and the commanding general in Dalmatia, Marcellinus, who ruled their respective domains independent from imperial authority. These two generals entered into open hostilities with Ricimer and refused to recognize Ricimer&#x27;s position. Ricimer ruled the West without an emperor for three months. Facing pressure from the Senate and Italian aristocracy, Ricimer named the undistinguished Senator Libius Severus as Emperor on 19 November 461; Severus was recognized by the Senate in Rome, but the Eastern Emperor Leo I refused to acknowledge him as his Western counterpart. 

Although he faced open military opposition from Western generals, with the docile Severus as emperor, Ricimer was master of Rome and Italy. The principal problem facing Ricimer during Severus&#x27; reign was the lengthy war against the Vandals—who controlled Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, the Balearics, and Sicily, while also making incursions into mainland Greece and Italy—and political opposition from the Eastern Empire. 

In 461, Ricimer suborned the Huns under Marcellinus, who was compelled to abandon Sicily. Sometime in 463, Ricimer defeated a contingent of Visigoths at Orleans, formerly an Alan stronghold. Then in 464, Ricimer commanded an army that met an invading Alan host at the Battle of Bergamo, where he defeated the invaders and killed their king, Beorgor.

Due to diminished tax revenues and with the key armies of the West under opposition control, Ricimer needed assistance from the East to maintain order in the West. As such, Severus, despite his docile nature, represented an obstacle to Ricimer&#x27;s power and a hindrance to any reconciliation efforts with Leo or Geiseric. On 14 November 465, Libius Severus died. According to Cassiodorus, he was poisoned by Ricimer, but this reconstruction is doubted on the basis of Sidonius Apollinaris. Ricimer proceeded to rule the West for eighteen months without an emperor as he waited for Leo to name Severus&#x27; successor.

===Anthemius (467–472)===
For nearly two years, the throne in the West remained vacant, until 14 April 467, when Leo named the Greek aristocrat and son-in-law of Marcian, Anthemius, to the position. Leo&#x27;s motivation included pressure from the Vandals, and perhaps the removal of a potential rival at Constantinople. Meanwhile, Ricimer married Anthemius&#x27;s daughter Alypia, solidifying his connection to the emperor and providing the appearance of unity between the two-halves of the Empire. The marriage was an extravagant affair with much pomp and show, and the union appears to have garnered support from the Roman population. On this occasion, Sidonius composed a lengthy panegyric to Anthemius and within it praises Ricimer; he claims that a goddess representing Italy speaks to the river god of the Tiber thus:

Leo sent Anthemius to Italy with an army led by the commanding general of the Dalmatian Army, Marcellinus, a former rival of Ricimer. Ricimer must have initially viewed Anthemius&#x27; appointment as undermining his position, for unlike Libius Severus, Anthemius had a proven history of military success and had family ties to the Theodosian Dynasty. However, needing the support of the Eastern Empire, Ricimer was forced to accept him as the price for Leo&#x27;s good will and for &quot;eastern protection against the depredations of Geiseric&quot;. 

Soon after assuming the Western throne, Anthemius granted Marcellinus the rank of patrician in an effort to counterbalance the authority of Ricimer. Both Leo and Anthemius had seen the difficulty Western Emperors had in maintaining control over the Western military with the existence of a single unchallenged supreme commander. Despite these potential machinations, sources such as Ennodius attest to the power and influence of Ricimer, who once wrote that Ricimer was directing governmental affairs at this time and was &quot;second only to the Emperor Anthemius&quot;.

====Campaign in North Africa====
In 468, Leo organized a grand campaign against the Vandals in North Africa, to which the East and West would commit substantial forces. The commanding general of the Thracian army, Basiliscus, brother-in-law of Leo, assumed supreme command over the joint East-West assault, with Marcellinus commanding the Western forces. The plan called for a three-pronged attack led by Basiliscus, Marcellinus, and Heraclius of Edessa, the (military count) of Egypt. Basiliscus was to land at a distance from Carthage with the main army (transported by an armada of over 1,000 ships) and then link up with Heraclius, advancing from Tripolitania. Marcellinus was to invade Africa from Sicily. Ricimer, under the overall command of Marcellinus, commanded a large portion of the Western forces in the expedition, but their fleet never sailed—due to Ricimer&#x27;s veto—despite the West having agreed to contribute one-fourth of the total expedition&#x27;s costs. Despite the other prongs of the attack making good progress at the onset, at least half of the joint armada was destroyed by Geiseric&#x27;s fireships, causing Basilicus to abandon the attack against Carthage and withdraw back to Sicily. At this stage, Marcellinus was suddenly murdered while in Sicily, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer.

====Consequences of failure====
The failed joint expedition against the Vandals was a &quot;shock to Roman prestige&quot;. This combined military venture—known otherwise as the Battle of Cape Bon (468)—was an unequivocal disaster that reduced Roman military might and also nearly bankrupted the Western and Eastern Empires alike, certainly dooming the Western half &quot;to extinction&quot; according to historian Peter Heather. Upon hearing of the disastrous defeat, the Visigoths resumed their wars of expansion against the West and the Burgundians expanded their kingdom towards Arles. With Marcellinus dead, Geiseric recommenced his attacks upon Italy in 470, which forced Ricimer—as the sole commander in the West—to assume command of Italy&#x27;s defense against the Vandals. Marcellinus had been Anthemius&#x27; favorite of the two generals, and his death served to widen the divide between the emperor and Ricimer. The tipping point of their relationship was the trial of Romanus, the imperial chancellor () and supporter of Ricimer, whom Anthemius accused of treason and condemned to death in 470. Following the execution of Romanus by Anthemius, Ricimer moved north to Milan with a force of six thousand soldiers. Relations between the two deteriorated to the point that Epiphanius of Pavia, bishop of Milan, was asked to negotiate peace between them.

Despite the bishop&#x27;s efforts, the two were irreconcilable and began insulting one another; Anthemius called Ricimer a &quot;skin-clad Goth&quot;, while Ricimer referred to the emperor as &quot;an excitable Galatian&quot;. By 472, open warfare broke out between them, during which Ricimer marched on Rome itself, a siege that lasted many months. Four months into the assault on Rome, Ricimer named Olybrius (the brother-in-law of Geiseric) to the throne in a move of conciliation, since the Vandal king had been pressing for his elevation. After months of siege and suffering from starvation, Rome surrendered and Ricimer finally entered the city. Anthemius tried to escape by disguising himself as a beggar, but the emperor was caught attempting to flee the city at the Church of Santa Maria in Trastevere, where he was beheaded on 11 July 472.

==Death and legacy==
Ricimer&#x27;s rule lasted until his death of natural causes—apparently a hemorrhage on 19 August 472—six weeks after deposing Anthemius. His title of patrician and position as supreme commander were assumed by his nephew Gundobad. Nonetheless, Ricimer had been a figure of major significance and historians Stephen Williams and Gerard Friell put this into context with the following: 

Further contextualization that led to a barbarian generalissimo like Ricimer having so much influence on the Western Roman Empire is captured by historian James M. O&#x27;Flynn, who writes: 

Without a powerful figure to guide it, the Western Roman Empire experienced an even more rapid succession of emperors, none of whom was able to effectively consolidate power. The line of Western Roman Emperors ended arguably in either 476 (with Odoacer&#x27;s deposition of Romulus Augustus) or 480 (with Julius Nepos&#x27;s death), concentrating the remaining imperial power in far-off Constantinople. Historian J. B. Bury claims that Odoacer was more or less a constitutional successor to Ricimer.

==Appearances in opera==
Ricimer&#x27;s life was used as a subject of opera libretti in the 17th and 18th centuries, embellishing his biography with romantic and political intrigues. The earliest setting was Matteo Noris&#x27;s &quot;Ricimero re de&#x27; Vandali&quot; (set by Carlo Pallavicino, 1684), which focuses on the installation of Anthemius in Rome and the promise of marriage to his daughter Domizia. A better-known setting was Apostolo Zeno and Pietro Pariati&#x27;s libretto &quot;Flavio Anicio Olibrio&quot;, set by Francesco Gasparini (1708), Nicola Porpora (1711), Leonardo Vinci (1728), and Niccolò Jommelli (1740). This libretto is based on Ricimer&#x27;s siege of Rome and his relationship with Olybrius and their loves.

<doc id="72208" wikidata="Q935780" url="?curid=72208" title="Counterfactual history">
<text>Counterfactual history (also virtual history) is a form of historiography that attempts to answer the &quot;&quot; questions that arise from counterfactual conditions. Counterfactual history seeks by &quot;conjecturing on what did not happen, or what might have happened, in order to understand what did happen.&quot; It has produced a literary genre which is variously called alternate history, speculative history, allohistory, and hypothetical history.

==Development==
An early book of counterfactual histories is &quot;If It Had Happened Otherwise&quot; (1931) which features &quot;If Lee Had Not Won the Battle at Gettysburg&quot;, by Winston Churchill, about a fictional Confederate victory at the Battle of Gettysburg (1863). As a text of counterfactual histories written by historians, &quot;If It Had Happened Otherwise&quot; contains works of alternative history—fictional reinterpretations of historical events—because the narrative tone tends to whimsy, and offers neither historical analysis nor the logic behind such &quot;What if?&quot; scenarios.

In &quot;Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History&quot;, Robert Fogel applied quantitative methods to imagine the U.S. economy of 1890 had there been no railroads. That in the absence of the railroad in the U.S., the great system of canals would have been expanded and the roads would have been paved and improved into a reliable transport system; both improvements would have diminished the social and economic importance of the railroad, because “the level of per capita income achieved by January 1, 1890 would have been reached by March 31, 1890, if railroads had never been invented.”

Few further attempts to bring counterfactual history into the world of academia were made until the 1991 publication of &quot;Plausible Worlds: Possibility and Understanding in History and the Social Sciences&quot; by the Cambridge sociologist Geoffrey Hawthorn, who carefully explored three different counterfactual scenarios. This work helped inspire &quot;Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals&quot; (1997), a collection of essays exploring different scenarios by a number of historians, edited by the historian Niall Ferguson. Ferguson has become a significant advocate of counterfactual history, using counterfactual scenarios to illustrate his objections to deterministic theories of history such as Marxism, and to put forward a case for the importance of contingency in history, theorizing that a few key changes could result in a significantly different modern world. A series of &quot;What If?&quot; books edited by Robert Cowley presented dozens of essays by historians or prominent writers about &quot;how a slight turn of fate at a decisive moment could have changed the very annals of time.&quot;

Some scholars argue that a counterfactual is not as much a matter of what happened in the past but it is the disagreement about which past events were most significant. For example, William Thompson employs a sequence of counterfactuals for eight lead economies that have driven globalization processes for almost a thousand years. From Song dynasty in China to Genoa, Venice, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States, and claims that each actor in succession played an unusually critical role in creating a structure of leadership that became increasingly global in scope across time.

===Differences from alternate history===
Counterfactual history is neither historical revisionism nor alternate history.

Counterfactual history distinguishes itself through its interest in the very incident that is being negated by the counterfactual, thus seeking to evaluate the event&#x27;s relative historical importance. Historians produce arguments subsequent changes in history, outlining each in broad terms only, since the main focus is on the importance and impact of the negated event.

An alternate history writer, on the other hand, is interested precisely in the hypothetical scenarios that flow from the negated incident or event. A fiction writer is thus free to invent very specific events and characters in the imagined history.

An example of a counterfactual question would be: &quot;What if the Pearl Harbor attack did not happen?&quot;; whereas an alternate history writer would focus on a possible series of events arising therefrom.

The line is sometimes blurred as historians may invent more detailed timelines as illustrations of their ideas about the types of changes that might have occurred. But it is usually clear what general types of consequences the author thinks are reasonable to suppose would have been likely to occur, and what specific details are included in an imagined timeline only for illustrative purposes.

The line is further blurred by novelists such as Kim Stanley Robinson, whose alternate-history novel &quot;The Years of Rice and Salt&quot; has a character talking of historians&#x27; use of counterfactuals, within the novel&#x27;s alternate history. He dismisses this as &quot;a useless exercise&quot;.

==Criticism==
Most historians regard counterfactual history as perhaps entertaining, but not meeting the standards of mainstream historical research due to its speculative nature. Advocates of counterfactual history often respond that all statements about causality in history contain implicit counterfactual claims—for example, the claim that a certain military decision helped a country win a war presumes that if that decision had not been made, the war would have been less likely to be won, or would have been longer.

Richard Evans provides a systematic critique of the concept in his book &quot;Altered Pasts&quot;. In his view most counterfactuals are written by right wing historians engaging in wishful thinking either describing a hoped for present or to discredit left wing ideology. He claims that reducing outcomes to a single cause ignores the complexity of influences on outcomes. In contrast Christopher Prendergast believes that counterfactuals have the important role of testing explanations of historical causality by exploring the implication of alternatives. 

Aviezer Tucker has offered a range of criticism of this approach to the study of the past both in his review of Ferguson&#x27;s &quot;Virtual History in History and Theory&quot; and in his book &quot;Our Knowledge of the Past: A Philosophy of Historiography&quot;. Tucker rejected the use multi-causal counterfactuals stating that every counterfactual should be posed as &quot;ceteris paribus&quot;, everything else remaining the same.

<text>Children in the military, including state armed forces, non-state armed groups, and other military organizations, may be trained for combat, assigned to support roles, such as cooks, porters/couriers, or messengers, or used for tactical advantage such as for human shields, or for political advantage in propaganda. Children (defined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child as people under the age of 18) have been recruited for participation in military operations and campaigns throughout history and in many cultures.

Children are targeted for their susceptibility to influence, which renders them easier to recruit and control. While some are recruited by force, others choose to join up, often to escape poverty or because they expect military life to offer a rite of passage to maturity.

Child soldiers who survive armed conflict frequently develop psychiatric illness, poor literacy and numeracy, and behavioral problems such as heightened aggression, which together lead to an increased risk of unemployment and poverty in adulthood. Research in the United Kingdom has found that the enlistment and training of adolescent children, even when they are not sent to war, is often accompanied by a higher risk of suicide, stress-related mental disorders, alcohol abuse, and violent behavior.

Since the 1960s, a number of treaties have successfully reduced the recruitment and use of children worldwide. Nonetheless, around a quarter of armed forces worldwide, particularly those of third-world nations, still train adolescent children for military service, while elsewhere, the use of children in armed conflict and insurgencies has increased in recent years.

==History==

History is filled with children who have been trained and used for fighting, assigned to support roles such as porters or messengers, used as sex slaves, or recruited for tactical advantage as human shields or for political advantage in propaganda. In 1813 and 1814, for example, Napoleon conscripted many young French teenagers for his armies. Thousands of children participated on all sides of the First and Second World Wars. Children continued to be used throughout the 20th and early 21st century on every continent, with concentrations in parts of Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. Only since the turn of the millennium have international efforts begun to limit and reduce the military use of children.

==Current situation==

=== State armed forces ===
The adoption in 2000 of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC) committed states who ratified it to &quot;take all feasible measures&quot; to ensure that no child takes a direct part in hostilities and to cease recruitment below the age of 16. As most states have now opted into OPAC, the global trend has been towards reserving military recruitment to adulthood, known as the &quot;Straight-18&quot; standard.

Nonetheless, , children aged under 18 were still being recruited and trained for military purposes in 46 countries. Most of these states recruit from age 17, fewer than 20 recruit from age 16, and an unknown, smaller number, recruit younger children.

, the United Nations (UN) verified that nine state armed forces were using children in hostilities: Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Somalia, and South Sudan in Africa; Palestine, Syria and Yemen in Western Asia; Afghanistan in Central Asia; and Myanmar in South East Asia.

The United Nations (UN) Committee on the Rights of the Child and others have called for an end to the recruitment of children by state armed forces, arguing that military training, the military environment, and a binding contract of service are not compatible with children&#x27;s rights and jeopardize healthy development.

=== Non-state armed groups ===
These include non-state armed paramilitary organisations such as militias, insurgents, terrorist organizations, guerrilla movements, armed liberation movements, and other types of quasi-military organisation.

, the UN identified 12 countries where children were widely used by such groups: Colombia in South America; Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan in Africa; Lebanon and Palestine in the Middle East; Syria and Yemen in Western Asia; Afghanistan in Central Asia; and Myanmar in South East Asia.

Not all armed groups use children and approximately 60 have entered agreements to reduce or end the practice since 1999. For example, by 2017, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in the Philippines had released nearly 2,000 children from its ranks, and in 2016, the FARC-EP guerrilla movement in Colombia agreed to stop recruiting children. Other countries have seen the reverse trend, particularly Afghanistan and Syria, where Islamist militants and groups opposing them have intensified their recruitment, training, and use of children.

=== Global estimates ===
In 2003, one estimate calculated that child soldiers participated in about three-quarters of ongoing conflicts. In the same year, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) estimated that most of these children were aged over 15, although some were younger.

Due to the widespread military use of children in areas where armed conflict and insecurity prevent access by UN officials and other observers, it is difficult to estimate how many children are affected. 
* In 2003 UNICEF estimated that some 300,000 children are involved in more than 30 conflicts worldwide. 
* In 2017, Child Soldiers International estimated that several tens of thousands of children, possibly more than 100,000, were in state and non-state military organisations around the world, and in 2018 the organisation reported that children were being used to participate in at least 18 armed conflicts. 
* In 2023 the UN Secretary General report presented 7,622 verified cases of children being recruited and used in armed conflicts in 23 countries. More than 12,460 children formerly associated with armed forces or groups received protection or reintegration support during 2022.

It is estimated that girl soldiers make between 10% and 30%, 6 and 50%, or over 40% of the child soldier population. Of the verified cases presented in the 2023 UN Secretary General report, girls make 12.3% of all child soldiers recruited or used by armed groups.

==Driving factors==

Despite children&#x27;s physical and psychological underdevelopment relative to adults, there are many reasons why state and non-state military organisations seek them out, and why children themselves are often drawn to join of their own volition.

=== Psychological factors ===
Relative to adults, the neurological underdevelopment of children, including adolescent children, renders them more susceptible to recruitment and also more likely to make consequential decisions without due regard to the risks.

With these susceptibilities in mind, military marketing to adolescents has been criticised in Germany, the UK, and the US for glamorizing military life while omitting the risks and the loss of fundamental rights.

Research in the same three countries finds that recruiters disproportionately target children from poorer backgrounds. In the UK, for example, the army finds it easier to attract child recruits from age 16 than adults from age 18, particularly those from poorer backgrounds.

Once recruited, children are easier than adults to indoctrinate and control, and are more motivated than adults to fight for non-monetary incentives such as religion, honour, prestige, revenge, and duty.

=== Social factors ===
In many countries growing populations of young people relative to older generations have made children a cheap and accessible resource for military organisations. In a 2004 study of children in military organisations around the world, Rachel Brett and Irma Specht pointed to a complex of factors that incentivise children to join military organisations, particularly:
* Background poverty including a lack of civilian education or employment opportunities.
* The cultural normalization of war.
* Seeking new friends.
* Revenge (for example, after seeing friends and relatives killed).
* Expectations that a &quot;warrior&quot; role provides a rite of passage to maturity.

The following testimony from a child recruited by the Cambodian armed forces in the 1990s is typical of many children&#x27;s motivations for joining up:

=== Military factors ===
Some leaders of armed groups have claimed that children, despite their underdevelopment, bring their own qualities as combatants to a fighting unit, often being remarkably fearless, agile and hardy.

The global proliferation of light automatic weapons, which children can easily handle, has also made the use of children as direct combatants more viable.

== Impact on children ==

=== Armed conflict ===
Child soldiers who survive armed conflict face a markedly elevated risk of debilitating psychiatric illness, poor literacy and numeracy, and behavioural problems. Research in Palestine and Uganda, for example, has found that more than half of former child soldiers showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and nearly nine in ten in Uganda screened positive for depressed mood. Researchers in Palestine also found that children exposed to high levels of violence in armed conflict were substantially more likely than other children to exhibit aggression and anti-social behaviour. The combined impact of these effects typically includes a high risk of poverty and lasting unemployment in adulthood.

=== Detention ===
Further harm is caused when armed forces and groups detain child recruits. Children are often detained without sufficient food, medical care, or under other inhumane conditions, and some experience physical and sexual torture. Some are captured with their families, or detained due to one of their family members&#x27; activity. Lawyers and relatives are frequently banned from any court hearing.

=== Military training ===

While the use of children in armed conflict has attracted most attention, other research has found that military settings present several serious risks before child recruits are deployed to war zones, particularly during training.

Research from several countries finds that military enlistment, even before recruits are sent to war, is accompanied by a higher risk of attempted suicide in the US, higher risk of mental disorders in the US and the UK, higher risk of alcohol misuse and higher risk of violent behaviour, relative to recruits&#x27; pre-military experience.

Military academics in the US have characterized military training as &quot;intense indoctrination&quot; in conditions of sustained stress, the primary purpose of which is to establish the unconditional and immediate obedience of recruits. The research literature has found that adolescents are more vulnerable than adults to a high-stress environment, particularly those from a background of childhood adversity. It finds in particular that the prolonged stressors of military training are likely to aggravate pre-existing mental health problems and hamper healthy neurological development.

Military settings are characterized by elevated rates of bullying, particularly by instructors. In the UK between 2014 and 2020, for example, the army recorded 62 formal complaints of violence committed by staff against recruits at the military training centre for 16- and 17-year-old trainee soldiers, the Army Foundation College. Joe Turton, who joined up aged 17 in 2014, recalls bullying by staff throughout his training. For example:

Elevated rates of sexual harassment are characteristic of military settings, including the training environment. Between 2015 and 2020, for example, girls aged 16 or 17 in the British armed forces were twice as likely as their same-age civilian peers to report rape or other sexual assault.

==International law==

=== Recruitment and use of children ===

==== Definition of child ====
The Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child as any person under the age of 18. The Paris Principles define a child associated with an armed force or group as:

==== Children aged under 15 ====
The Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions (1977, Art. 77.2), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (2002) all forbid state armed forces and non-state armed groups from using children under the age of 15 directly in armed conflict (technically &quot;hostilities&quot;). This is now recognised as a war crime.

==== Children aged under 18 ====

Most states with armed forces are also bound by the higher standards of the widely ratified Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC) (2000) and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention (1999), which forbid the compulsory recruitment of those under the age of 18. OPAC also requires governments that still recruit children (from age 16) to &quot;take all feasible measures to ensure that persons below the age of 18 do not take a direct part in hostilities&quot;. In addition, OPAC forbids non-state armed groups from recruiting children under any circumstances, although the legal force of this is uncertain.

The highest standard in the world is set by the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, which forbids state armed forces from recruiting children under the age of 18 under any circumstances. Most African states have ratified the Charter.

None of the above treaties either explicitly forbids the &quot;indirect&quot; participation of children in &quot;hostilities&quot;, or from contributing to a military operation in a stand-off position (i.e. away from hostilities).

=== Standards for the release and reintegration of children ===
OPAC requires governments to demobilise children within their jurisdiction who have been recruited or used in hostilities and to provide assistance for their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration. Under war, civil unrest, armed conflict and other emergency situations, children and youths are also offered protection under the United Nations &quot;Declaration on the Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed Conflict&quot;. To accommodate the proper disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former members of armed groups, the United Nations started the Integrated DDR Standards in 2006.

===War crimes===

Opinion is currently divided over whether children should be prosecuted for war crimes. International law does not prohibit the prosecution of children who commit war crimes, but Article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child limits the punishment that a child can receive: &quot;Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offenses committed by persons below eighteen years of age.&quot;

==== Example: Sierra Leone ====

In the wake of the Sierra Leonean Civil War, the UN mandated the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) to try former combatants aged 15 and older for breaches of humanitarian law, including war crimes. However, the Paris Principles state that children who participate in armed conflict should be regarded first as victims, even if they may also be perpetrators:

This principle was reflected in the Court&#x27;s statute, which did not rule out prosecution but emphasised the need to rehabilitate and reintegrate former child soldiers. David Crane, the first Chief Prosecutor of the Sierra Leone tribunal, interpreted the statute in favour of prosecuting those who had recruited children, rather than the children themselves, no matter how heinous the crimes they had committed.

==== Example: Omar Khadr ====

In the US, prosecutors charged Omar Khadr, a Canadian, for offences they alleged he committed in Afghanistan while under the age of 16 and fighting for the Taliban against US forces. These crimes carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment under US law. In 2010, while under torture and duress, Khadr pleaded guilty to murder in violation of the laws of war, attempted murder in violation of the laws of war, conspiracy, two counts of providing material support for terrorism, and spying. The plea was offered as part of a plea bargain, which would see Khadr deported to Canada after one year of imprisonment to serve seven further years there. Omar Khadr remained in Guantanamo Bay and the Canadian government faced international criticism for delaying his repatriation. Khadr was eventually transferred to the Canadian prison system in September 2012 and was freed on bail by a judge in Alberta in May 2015. , Khadr was appealing his US conviction as a war criminal.

Before sentencing the Special Representative to the UN Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict wrote to the US military commission at Guantanamo appealing unsuccessfully for Khadr&#x27;s release into a rehabilitation program. In her letter she said that Khadr represented the &quot;classic child soldier narrative: recruited by unscrupulous groups to undertake actions at the bidding of adults to fight battles they barely understand&quot;.

==The role of the United Nations==

=== Background ===

Children&#x27;s rights advocates were left frustrated after the final text of the convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) did not prohibit the military recruitment of all children under the age of 18, and they began to call for a new treaty to achieve this goal. As a consequence the newly formed Committee on the Rights of the Child made two recommendations: first, to request a major UN study into the impact of armed conflict on children; and second, to establish a working group of the UN Commission on Human Rights to negotiate a supplementary protocol to the convention. Both proposals were accepted.

Responding to the committee on the Rights of the Child, the UN General Assembly acknowledged &quot;the grievous deterioration in the situation of children in many parts of the world as a result of armed conflicts&quot; and commissioned the human rights expert Graça Machel to conduct a major fact-finding study. Her report, &quot;Impact of Armed Conflict on Children&quot; (1996), was particularly concerned with the military use of younger children, which was killing, maiming, and psychiatrically injuring many thousands every year. It noted:

Meanwhile, the UN Commission on Human Rights established a working group to negotiate a treaty to raise the legal standard. After a global campaign and complex negotiations, the new treaty was agreed in 2000 as the Optional Protocol to the convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict. The treaty prohibited the direct participation of all children in armed conflict for the first time, while continuing to allow state armed forces (though not non-state armed groups) to recruit children from age 16. The protocol came into force on 12 February 2002.

=== Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict ===
The Machel Report led to a new mandate for a Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict (SRSG-CAAC). Among the tasks of the SRSG is to draft the Secretary-General&#x27;s annual report on children and armed conflict, which lists and describes the worst situations of child recruitment and use from around the world.

=== Security Council ===
The United Nations Security Council convenes regularly to debate, receive reports, and pass resolutions under the heading &quot;Children in armed conflict&quot;. The first resolution on the issue, Resolution 1261, was passed in 1999. In 2004 Resolution 1539 was passed unanimously, condemning the use of child soldiers and mandating the UN Secretary-General to establish a means of tracking and reporting on the practice, known as the Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism.

=== United Nations Secretary-General ===
The Secretary-General publishes an annual report on children and armed conflict. , his report identified 14 countries where children were widely used by armed groups during 2016 (Afghanistan, Colombia, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Mali, Myanmar, Nigeria, Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen) and six countries where state armed forces were using children in hostilities (Afghanistan, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, and Syria).

==Children in the military today—by region and country==
This section covers the use of children for military purposes today. For historical cases, see History of children in the military.

===Africa===
In 2003, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that up to half of children involved with state armed forces and non-state armed groups worldwide were in Africa. In 2004, Child Soldiers International estimated that 100,000 children were being used in state and non-state armed forces on the continent; and in 2008 an estimate put the total at 120,000 children, or 40 percent of the global total.

The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (1990), which most African states have ratified, prohibits all military recruitment of children aged under 18. Nonetheless, according to the UN, in 2016 children were being used by armed groups in seven African countries (Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan) and by state armed forces in three (Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan).

International efforts to reduce the number of children in military organisations in Africa began with the Cape Town Principles and Best Practices, developed in 1997. The Principles proposed that African governments commit to OPAC, which was being negotiated at the time, and raise the minimum age for military recruitment from 15 to 18. The Principles also defined a child soldier to include any person under the age of 18 who is &quot;part of any kind of regular or irregular armed force or group in any capacity ... including girls recruited for sexual purposes...&quot;

In 2007, the Free Children from War conference in Paris produced the Paris Principles, which refined and updated the Cape Town Principles, applied them globally, and outlined a practical approach to reintegrating current child soldiers.

====Central African Republic====
The use of children by armed groups in the Central African Republic has historically been common. Between 2012 and 2015 as many as 10,000 children were used by armed groups in the nationwide armed conflict and the problem persists nationwide with a most likely greater amount fighting now. The mainly Muslim &quot;Séléka&quot; coalition of armed groups and the predominantly Christian &quot;Anti-balaka&quot; militias have both used children in this way; some are as young as eight.

In May 2015 at the &quot;Forum de Bangui&quot; (a meeting of government, parliament, armed groups, civil society, and religious leaders), a number of armed groups agreed to demobilize thousands of children.

In 2016 a measure of stability returned to the Central African Republic and, according to the United Nations, 2,691 boys and 1,206 girls were officially separated from armed groups. Despite this, the recruitment and use of children for military purposes increased by approximately 50 percent over that year, mostly attributed to the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army.

====Democratic Republic of the Congo====
Thousands of children serve in the military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and various rebel militias. It has been estimated that more than 30,000 children were fighting with various parties to the conflict at the height of the Second Congo War. It was claimed in the film &quot;Kony 2012&quot; that the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army recruited this number.

Currently, the DRC has one of the highest proportions of child soldiers in the world. The international court has passed judgment on these practices during the war. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, one of the warlords in the DRC, has been sentenced to 14 years in prison because of his role in the recruitment of child soldiers between 2002 and 2003. Lubanga directed the Union of Congolese Patriots and its armed wing Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of Congo. The children were forced to fight in the armed conflict in Ituri.

====Somalia====

A report published by the Child Soldiers International in 2004 estimated that 200,000 children had been recruited into the country&#x27;s militias against their will since 1991. In 2017 UN Secretary-General António Guterres commented on a UN report which estimated that over 50 percent of Al-Shabaab&#x27;s membership in the country was under the age of 18, with some as young as nine being sent to fight. The report verified that 6,163 children had been recruited in Somalia between 1 April 2010 and 31 July 2016, of which 230 were girls. Al-Shabaab accounted for seventy percent of this recruitment, and the Somali National Army was also recruiting children.

====Sudan====
In 2004 approximately 17,000 children were being used by the state armed forces and non-state armed groups. As many as 5,000 children were part of the main armed opposition group at the time, the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army (SPLA). Some former child soldiers were sentenced to death for crimes committed while they were soldiers.

In 2006, children were also recruited from refugee camps in Chad, and thousands were used in the conflict in Darfur. In 2005 the government ratified the OPAC treaty and by 2008 the military use of children had reduced in the country, but both state armed forces and the SPLA continued to recruit and use them. The use of children has continued to diminish, but in 2017 the UN was still receiving reports of children as young as 12 in government forces.

====Uganda====
&quot;The LRA in Uganda became known mainly through the forced recruitment of thousands of children and adolescents who were trained as soldiers or forced to &#x27;marry&#x27; members of the rebel group. Unlike all other, or earlier, rebel groups in Uganda, the LRA made the violent abduction or enslavement of children (preferably aged between twelve and fourteen) its main method of recruitment and concentrated its activities on attacking the civilian population.&quot;

====Zimbabwe====
In 2003, the &quot;Guardian&quot; reported multiple human rights violations by the National Youth Service, a state-sponsored youth militia in Zimbabwe. Originally conceived as a patriotic youth organisation, it became a paramilitary group of youth aged between 10 and 30, and was used to suppress dissent in the country. The organisation was finally banned in January 2018.

===Americas===

====Bolivia====
In 2001 the government of Bolivia acknowledged that male children as young as 14 may have been forcibly conscripted into the armed forces during recruitment sweeps. About 40% of the Bolivian army was believed to be under the age of 18, with half of those below the age of 16. , Bolivia invites children to begin their adult conscription early, from age 17.

====Brazil====
In Brazil the local organized crime groups, such as Comando Vermelho, recruit children to sell drugs and commit homicides, as well as to fight with the police and other rival groups. Also the Brazilian militias recruit children to fight in the conflict against Comando Vermelho.

====Canada====
In Canada, people may join the reserve component of the Canadian Forces at age 16 with parental permission, and the regular component at 17 years of age, also with parental permission. They may not volunteer for a tour of duty until reaching age 18.

====Colombia====
In the Colombian armed conflict, from the mid-1960s to present, one-fourth of non-state combatants have been and still are under 18 years old. In 2004 Colombia ranked fourth in the world for the greatest use of child soldiers. There are currently 11,000–14,000 children in armed groups in the country. In negotiations with the government, armed groups have offered to stop the recruitment of minors as a bargaining chip, but they have not honoured these offers. Bjørkhaug argues that most child soldiers were recruited through some combination of voluntary participation and coercion.

In 1998 a Human Rights Watch press release indicated that 30 percent of some guerrilla units were made up of children and up to 85 percent of some of the militias, which are considered to serve as a &quot;training ground for future guerrilla fighters&quot;, had child soldiers In the same press release it was estimated that some of the government-linked paramilitary units consisted of up to 50 percent children, including some as young as eight years old.

In 2005 an estimated 11,000 children were involved with left- or right-wing paramilitaries in Colombia. &quot;Approximately 80 percent of child combatants in Colombia belong to one of the two left-wing guerrilla groups, the FARC or ELN. The remainder fight in paramilitary ranks, predominately the AUC.&quot; According to P. W. Singer the FARC attack on the Guatape hydroelectric facility in 1998 involved militants as young as eight years old and a 2001 FARC training video depicted boys as young as 11 working with missiles. The group has also taken in children from Venezuela, Panama, and Ecuador.

The Colombian government&#x27;s security forces do not officially recruit children as the legal age for both compulsory and voluntary recruitment has been set at 18. However, students were allowed to enroll as cadets in military secondary schools and 16- or 17-year-olds could enter air force or national army training programs, respectively. In addition, captured enemy child combatants were employed by the Colombian military for intelligence gathering purposes in potential violation of legal prohibitions.

The demobilization efforts targeted toward the FARC in 2016–2017 have provided hope that the conflict will come to an end, limiting the number of children involved in violence. However, other armed groups have yet to be demobilized, and conflict is not yet resolved.

====Cuba====
In Cuba, compulsory military service for both boys and girls starts at age 17. Male teenagers are allowed to join the Territorial Troops Militia prior to their compulsory service.

====Haiti====
In Haiti an unknown number of children participate in various loosely organised armed groups that are engaged in political violence.

====Mexico====
In Mexico an unknown number of children are used by criminal organizations like the Gulf Cartel in the Mexican drug war to fight the government and the other rival cartels. Also the Grupos de autodefensa comunitaria recruited some children to defend their villages from the violence of the local crime groups, one of the self-defense groups that recruit soldier children is Coordinadora Regional de Autoridades Comunitarias-Pueblos Fundadores (CRAC-PF) to fight with Los Ardillos, a criminal group split from the Beltrán Leyva Cartel. The battles between CRAC-PF and Los Ardillos caused 53 deaths.

====Paraguay====
The government of Paraguay accused the guerrilla groups EPP and the ACA of recruit child soldiers to fight the government in the ongoing insurgency in the northeastern part of the country.

====United States====
In the United States 17-year-olds may join the armed forces with the written agreement of parents. approximately 16,000 17-year-olds were being enlisted annually.

The US Army describes outreach to schools as the &#x27;cornerstone&#x27; of its approach to recruitment, and the No Child Left Behind Act gives recruiters the legal right of access to all school students&#x27; contact details. Children&#x27;s rights bodies have criticized the US&#x27; reliance on children to staff its armed forces. The committee on the Rights of the Child has recommended that the US raise the minimum age of enlistment to 18.

In negotiations on the OPAC treaty during the 1990s the US joined the UK in strongly opposing a global minimum enlistment age of 18. As a consequence the treaty specified a minimum age of 16. The US ratified the treaty in 2002 (but U.S. ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child has not happened).

Per OPAC, US military personnel are normally prohibited from direct participation in hostilities until the age of 18. Still, they are eligible for &#x27;forward deployment&#x27;, which means that they may be posted to a combat zone to perform support tasks. The committee on the Rights of the Child has called on the US to change this policy and ensure that no minor can be deployed to a forward operating area in a combat zone.

In 2003 and 2004 approximately 60 underage personnel were deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq in error. The Department of Defense subsequently stated that &quot;the situations were immediately rectified and action taken to prevent recurrence.&quot;

In 2008 President George W. Bush signed the Child Soldiers Protection Act into law. The law criminalizes leading a military force which recruits child soldiers. It also prohibits arms sales to countries where children are used for military purposes. The law&#x27;s definition of child soldiers includes &quot;any person under 18 years of age who takes a direct part in hostilities as a member of governmental armed forces.&quot; Waivers from the act were issued by both the Obama and Trump administrations.

===Asia===
In 2004 the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International) reported that in Asia thousands of children are involved in fighting forces in active conflict and ceasefire situations in Afghanistan, Myanmar, Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Government refusal of access to conflict zones has made it impossible to document the numbers involved. In 2004 Myanmar was unique in the region as the only country where government armed forces forcibly recruited and used children between the ages of 12 and 16. Johnny and Luther Htoo, twin brothers who jointly led the God&#x27;s Army guerrilla group, were estimated to have been around ten years old when they began leading the group in 1997.

====Afghanistan====
Militias recruited thousands of child soldiers during the Afghan civil war over three decades. Many are still fighting now for the Taliban. Some of those taken from Islamic religious schools or madrassas, are used as suicide bombers and gunmen. A propaganda video of boys marching in camouflage uniform and using slogans of martyrdom was issued in 2009 by the Afghan Taliban&#x27;s leadership. This included a eulogy to a 14-year-old Taliban fighter who allegedly killed an American soldier.

====Burma/Myanmar====
The State Peace and Development Council has asserted that all of its soldiers volunteered and that all of those accepted are 18 or over. According to Human Rights Watch as many as 70,000 boys serve in Burma/Myanmar&#x27;s national army, the Tatmadaw, with children as young as 11 being forcibly recruited off the streets. Desertion, the group reported, leads to punishments of three to five years in prison or even execution. The group has also stated that about 5,000–7,000 children serve with a range of different armed ethnic opposition groups, most notably in the United Wa State Army. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon released a report in June 2009 mentioning &quot;grave violations&quot; against children in the country by both the rebels and the government. The administration announced on 4August that they would send a team into Burma/Myanmar to press for more action.

====India====

====Iran====
Current Iranian law officially prohibits the recruitment of those under 16.

During the Iran–Iraq War, male children were drafted into the Basij army where, according to critics of the Iranian government, they &quot;were sent to the front as waves of human shields&quot;. Other sources have estimated the total number of all Iranian casualties to be in the 200,000–600,000 range. One source estimates that 3% of the Iran–Iraq War&#x27;s casualties were under the age of 14.

There were male Iranian children who left school and participated in the Iran–Iraq War without the knowledge of their parents, including Mohammad Hossein Fahmideh. Iraqi officers claimed that they sometimes captured Iranian child soldiers as young as eight years old.

 the Iranian government has been recruiting children from Iran and Afghanistan to fight in the Syrian Civil War on the side of forces loyal to the Assad government.

====Lebanon====
Many different sides in the Lebanese Civil War used child soldiers. A May 2008 Child Soldiers International report stated that Hezbollah trains children for military services. In 2017, the UN reported that armed groups, suspected to be Islamist militants, were recruiting children in the country.

====Nepal====
An estimated 6,000–9,000 children serve in the Communist Party of Nepal forces. , child soldiers of the CPN have since been demobilized.

====Palestine====
William O&#x27;Brien, a professor of Georgetown University, wrote about the active participation of Palestinian children in the First Intifada: &quot;It appears that a substantial number, if not the majority, of troops of the intifada are young people, including elementary schoolchildren. They are engaged in throwing stones and Molotov cocktails and other forms of violence.&quot; Arab journalist Huda Al-Hussein wrote in a London Arab newspaper on 27October 2000:

In 2002 a report by Jihad Shomaly for the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International) said that, &quot;while there are reports of children participating in hostilities, there is no evidence of systematic recruitment by armed groups&quot;. In 2004, however, the organisation reported that there were at least nine documented suicide attacks involving Palestinian minors between October 2000 and March 2004, stating:

In May 2008 a Child Soldiers International report highlighted Hamas and Islamic Jihad for having &quot;used children in military attacks and training&quot; in its Iranian section.

On 23 May 2005 Amnesty International reiterated its calls to Palestinian armed groups to put an immediate end to the use of children in armed activities: &quot;Palestinian armed groups must not use children under any circumstances to carry out armed attacks or to transport weapons or other material.&quot;

There is mounting evidence that Hamas and PIJ operate &quot;summer camps&quot; specifically dedicated to train children to be soldiers, and on occasion uses them for illegal military operations.

During the Israel-Hamas war, the IDF has gathered substantial evidence of Palestinian children undergoing military training.

====Philippines====
Islamist and communist armed groups fighting the government have routinely relied on child recruits. In 2001 Human Rights Watch reported that an estimated 13 percent of the 10,000 soldiers in the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) were children, and that some paramilitary forces linked to the government were also using children. In 2016 the MILF allowed 1,869 children to leave and committed not to recruit children any more. In the same year, however, the UN reported that other armed groups in the Philippines continue to recruit children, mainly between the ages of 13 and 17.

====Sri Lanka====
Militant use of children in Sri Lanka has been an internationally recognized problem since the inception of the Sri Lankan civil war in 1983. The primary recruiters of children are the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.

====Syria====
During the ongoing Syrian Civil War children have joined groups opposed to Bashar al Assad. In 2012 the UN received allegations of rebels using child soldiers, but said they were unable to verify these. In June 2014 a United Nations report said that the opposition had recruited children in military and support roles. While there seemed to be no policy of doing so, the report said, there were no age verification procedures. Human Rights Watch reported in 2014 that rebel factions have been using children in support and combatant roles, ranging from treating the wounded on battlefields, ferrying ammunition and other supplies to frontlines while fighting raged, to acting as snipers.

The Turkish government linked think tank SETA withdrew a report detailing the composition of the Syrian National Army as it revealed the use of child soldiers. The Syrian National Army is currently funded by Turkey, who signed the optional protocol to the convention on the rights of the child on the involvement of children in armed conflict 8 September 2000. It was reported that Turkey has deployed child soldiers in the Syrian National Army to Libya according to a report by Al-Monitor, citing sources on the ground. In July 2021, the United States of America added Turkey to the list of countries that implicated in the use of child soldiers, because it used them in Syria and Libya. The &quot;2023 Trafficking in Persons Report&quot; mentioned that factions of the Turkish backed Syrian National Army recruited and used Syrian children as child soldiers in Libya.
The 2021 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices mentioned the recruitment and use of child soldiers from Turkish-supported forces in Syria. 
The 2021, 2022 and 2023 Trafficking in Persons Reports mentioned that Turkey provided support to armed groups in Syria which recruit and use child soldiers.

Kurdish forces have also been accused of using this tactic. In 2015 Human Rights Watch claimed that 59 children, 10 of them under 15 years old, were recruited by or volunteered for the YPG or YPJ since July 2014 when the Kurdish militia leaders signed a Deed of Commitment with Geneva Call.

President Assad passed a law in 2013 prohibiting the use of child soldiers (anyone under 18), the breaking of which is punishable by 10–20 years of &#x27;penal labour.&#x27; Whether or not the law is actually enforced on government&#x27;s forces has not been confirmed, and there have been allegations of children being recruited to fight for the Syrian government against rebel forces.

Iranian government is recruiting children from Iran and Afghanistan to fight in the Syrian Civil War on the side of the government forces loyal to Assad.

====Turkey (PKK)====

During the Kurdish–Turkish conflict, the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK) has actively recruited and kidnapped children. The organization has been accused of abducting more than 2,000 children by Turkish Security Forces. The independent reports by the Human Rights Watch (HRW), the United Nations (UN) and the Amnesty International have confirmed the recruitment and use of child soldiers by the organization and its armed wings since the 90&#x27;s. In 2001, it was reported that the recruitment of the children by the organization has been systematic. Several reports have reported about the organization&#x27;s battalion, called &quot;Tabura Zaroken Sehit Agit&quot;, which has been formed mainly for the recruitment of children. It was also reported that the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) had recruited children.

According to the Turkish Security Forces, the PKK has abducted more than 983 children aged between 12 and 17. More than 400 children have fled from the organization and surrendered to the security forces. The United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund report, published in 2010, saw the recruitment of the children by the PKK concerning and dangerous.

In 2016, the Human Rights Watch, accused the PKK of committing war crimes by recruiting child soldiers in the Shingal region of Iraq and in neighboring countries.

Throughout the Syrian Civil War multiple media outlets including Human Rights Watch have confirmed that the YPG, an organization linked to the PKK, has been recruiting and deploying child soldiers. Despite a claim by the group that it would stop using children, which has been violation of international law, the group has continued the recruitment and use of children.

In 2018, the annual UN report on children in armed conflict found 224 cases of child recruitment by the People&#x27;s Defense Units and its women&#x27;s unit in 2017, an almost fivefold increase from the 2016. Seventy-two of the children, nearly one-third, were girls. The group was also reported to had abducted children to enlist them.

====Yemen====
U.N. Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict Radhika Coomaraswamy stated in January 2010 that &quot;large numbers&quot; of teenage boys are being recruited in Yemeni tribal fighting. NGO activist Abdul-Rahman al-Marwani has estimated that as many as 500–600 children are either killed or wounded through tribal combat every year in Yemen.

Saudi Arabia hired child soldiers from Sudan (especially from Darfur), and Yemen to fight against Houthis during the Yemeni Civil War (2015–present).

British SAS special forces are allegedly involved in training child soldiers in Yemen. Reportedly at least 40% of soldiers fighting for the Saudi-led coalition are children.

Saudi Arabia is also hiring Yemeni child soldiers to guard Saudi border against Houthis.

In June 2019, Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, blocked the inclusion of Saudi Arabia on the US list of countries that recruit child soldiers, dismissing his experts&#x27; findings that a Saudi-led coalition has been using children in Yemen&#x27;s civil war.

===Europe===
According to Child Soldiers International the trend in Europe has been towards recruiting only adults from age 18; most states only allow adult recruitment, and no armed groups were known to be using children. one country, the United Kingdom, was enlisting children from age 16, and five were enlisting from age 17 (Austria, Cyprus, France, Germany, and Netherlands). Of these, the UK recruits children in the greatest numbers; in 2016, approximately a quarter of new recruits to the British army were aged under 18.

All European states have ratified the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, and so child recruits are not typically used in hostilities until they reach adulthood. Children were used as combatants in the First Chechen War during the 1990s.

====Austria====
Austria invites male children to begin their adult compulsory military service one year early, at age 17, with the consent of their parents.

====Cyprus====
Cyprus invites children to begin their adult compulsory military service two years early, at age 16, with the consent of their parents.

====France====
France enlists military personnel from age 17 and 6 months, and students for military technical school from age 16; 3% of its armed forces&#x27; intake is aged under 18.

====Germany====
Germany enlists military personnel from age 17; in 2015 6% of its armed forces&#x27; intake was aged under 18.

====Netherlands====
The Netherlands enlists military personnel from age 17; in 2014 5% of its armed forces&#x27; intake was aged under 18.

====Ukraine====
During the armed conflict in Eastern Ukraine in 2014 Justice for Peace at Donbas documented 41 verified individual cases of child recruitment into armed formations. Of those 37 concerned the participation of children in armed formations on territory occupied by Russia and 4 on territory controlled by Ukraine. There were 31 further reports of child recruitment which could not be verified. Of the 37 verified cases on territory controlled by Russia, 33 were boys and 4 were girls; 57% were aged 16–17, 35% were under 15, and age could not be determined in 8% of cases.

In December 2022, Andrii Yusov, a representative of Ukraine&#x27;s Defence Intelligence, stated 17-year-olds have been drafted by the Russian military in occupied territories.

====United Kingdom====
The British armed forces enlist personnel from age 16 and accept applications from children aged 15 years, 7 months. Parental consent is required prior to enlistment.

, 23% of enlistees to the British armed forces were aged under 18. Most child recruits were enlisted for the army, where 30% of the intake in the year 2021-2022 was aged under 18; more new soldiers were 16 than any other age.

Army recruits aged between 16 and 17.5 train initially at the Army Foundation College, a military training centre dedicated to the age group.

As per the OPAC, the UK does not normally send child recruits to participate in hostilities, although it does not rule out doing so.

The UK inadvertently deployed 22 personnel aged under 18 to Iraq and Afghanistan between 2003 and 2010. The committee on the Rights of the Child has urged the UK to alter its policy so as to ensure that children cannot take part in hostilities under any circumstances.

In negotiations on the OPAC during the 1990s the UK joined the US in opposing a global minimum enlistment age of 18. Children&#x27;s rights bodies have criticised the UK&#x27;s continuing reliance on children to staff its armed forces.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
The Australian Defence Force allows personnel to enlist with parental consent from the age of 16. Personnel under the age of 18 cannot be deployed overseas or used in direct combat except in extreme circumstances where it is not possible to evacuate them.

====New Zealand====
, the minimum age for joining the New Zealand Defence Force was 17.

==Movement to end military use of children==
The military use of children has been common throughout history; only in recent decades has the practice met with informed criticism and concerted efforts to end it. Progress has been slow, partly because many armed forces have relied on children to fill their ranks, and partly because the behaviour of non-state armed groups is difficult to influence.

=== Recent history ===

==== 1970s–1980s ====
International efforts to limit children&#x27;s participation in armed conflict began with the Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, adopted in 1977 (Art. 77.2). The new Protocols prohibited the military recruitment of children aged under 15, but continued to allow state armed forces and non-state armed groups to recruit children from age 15 and use them in warfare.

Efforts were renewed during negotiations on the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), when Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) campaigned for the new treaty to outlaw child recruitment entirely. Some states, whose armed forces relied on recruiting below the age of 18, resisted this, so the final treaty text of 1989 only reflected the existing legal standard: the prohibition of the direct participation of children aged under 15 in hostilities.

==== 1990s ====
In the 1990s NGOs established the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International) to work with sympathetic governments on a campaign for a new treaty to correct the deficiencies they saw in the CRC. After a global campaign lasting six years, the treaty was adopted in 2000 as the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC). The treaty prohibits child conscription, ensures that military recruits are no younger than 16, and forbids the use of child recruits in hostilities. The treaty also forbids non-state armed groups from recruiting anyone under the age of 18 for any purpose. Although most states negotiating OPAC supported a ban on recruiting children, some states, led by the US in alliance with the UK, objected to this. As such, the treaty does not ban the recruitment of children aged 16 or 17, although it allows states to bind themselves to a higher standard in law.

==== 2000s–present ====

After the adoption of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, a campaign for global ratification made swift progress. OPAC had been ratified by 167 states. The campaign also successfully encouraged many states not to recruit children at all. In 2001 83 states only allowed adult enlistment. By 2016 this had increased to 126, which is 71 percent of countries with armed forces. Approximately 60 non-state armed groups have also entered agreements to stop or scale back their use of children, often brokered by the UN or the NGO Geneva Call.

Child Soldiers International reports that the success of the OPAC treaty, combined with the gradual decline in child recruitment by state armed forces, has led to a reduction of children in military organisations worldwide. the recruitment and use of children remains widespread. In particular, militant Islamist organisations such as ISIS and Boko Haram, as well as armed groups fighting them, have used children extensively. In addition, the three most populous states – China, India and the United States – still allow their armed forces to enlist children aged 16 or 17, as do five of the Group of Seven countries: Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, again.

=== Events ===
Red Hand Day (also known as the International Day Against the Use of Child Soldiers) on 12February is an annual commemoration day to draw public attention to the practice of using children as soldiers in wars and armed conflicts. The date reflects the entry into force of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict.

=== Countering the militarisation of childhood ===
Many states which do not allow their armed forces to recruit children have continued to draw criticism for marketing military life to children through the education system, in civic spaces and in popular entertainment such as films and videogames. Some commentators have argued that this marketing to children is manipulative and part of a military recruitment process and should therefore be evaluated ethically as such. This principle has led some groups to campaign for relations between military organisations and young people to be regulated, on the grounds of children&#x27;s rights and public health. Examples are the Countering the Militarization of Youth programme of War Resisters&#x27; International, the Stop Recruiting Kids campaign in the US, and the Military Out of Schools campaign in the UK. Similar concerns have been raised in Germany and Israel.

==Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers==

Child Soldiers International defines reintegration as: &quot;The process through which children formerly associated with armed forces/groups are supported to return to civilian life and play a valued role in their families and communities&quot; Programs that aim to rehabilitate and reintegrate child soldiers, such as those sponsored by UNICEF, often emphasise three components: family reunification/community network, psychological support, and education/economic opportunity. These efforts take a minimum commitment of 3 to 5 years in order for programs to be successfully implemented. Generally, reintegration efforts seek to return children to a safe environment, to create a sense of forgiveness on the behalf of the child&#x27;s family and community through religious and cultural ceremonies and rituals, and encourage the reunification of the child with his or her family.

Reintegration efforts can become challenging when the child in question has committed war crimes because in these cases stigma and resentment within the community can be exacerbated. In situations such as these, it is important that the child&#x27;s needs are balanced with a sense of community justice. These situations should be addressed immediately because if not, many children face the threat of re-enlistment. There are also two areas of reintegration that warrant special consideration: female child soldiers and drug use among child soldiers. Child soldiers under the influence of drugs or who have contracted sexually transmitted diseases require additional programmes specific to their needs.

<text>Before the popularization of the Internet in the 1990s, Internet slang defined a luser (sometimes expanded to local user; also luzer or luzzer) as a painfully annoying, stupid, or irritating computer user.
The word is a blend of &quot;loser&quot; and &quot;user&quot;. Among hackers, the word &quot;luser&quot; takes on a broad meaning, referring to any normal user (in other words, not a &quot;guru&quot;), with the implication the person is also a loser. The term is partially interchangeable with the hacker term &quot;lamer&quot;. 

The term can also signify a layman with only user account privileges, as opposed to a power user or administrator, who has knowledge of, and access to, superuser accounts; for example, an [[End-user (computer science)|end luser]] who cannot be trusted with a root account for system administration. It is popular with technical support staff who have to deal with lusers as part of their job, often metaphorically employing a LART (Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool, also known as a clue-by-four, cluestick, or cluebat), meaning turning off the user&#x27;s access to computer resources and the like.

==History==

The Jargon File states that the word was coined around 1975 at MIT, although LUSER is visible in CTSS source code circa 1969 in subroutines involving spying on and killing users and deleting their files and directories. Under ITS, when a user first walked up to a terminal at MIT and typed control-Z to get the computer&#x27;s attention, it printed out some status information, including how many people were already using the computer. A patch to the system was then written to print &quot;14 losers&quot; instead of &quot;14 users&quot;, as a joke. For a while, several hackers who disagreed on the appropriateness of the change struggled covertly, each changing the message behind the backs of the others; any time a user logged into the computer it was equally probable that a user would see, say, &quot;users&quot; or &quot;losers&quot;. Finally, someone tried the compromise &quot;lusers&quot;, and it stuck. Later, ITS also had the command &quot;luser&quot;, which attempted to summon assistance from a list of designated helpers.

Although ITS ceased to be used in the mid-1990s, use of the term continued to spread, partly because in Unix-style computer operating systems, &quot;user&quot; designates all unprivileged accounts, while the superuser, or root, is the special user account used for system administration. &quot;root&quot; is the conventional name of the user who has all rights or permissions (to all files and programs) in all modes (single- or multi-user). The usage lives on, however, and the term &quot;luser&quot; is often seen in program comments and on Usenet.

On IRC, codice_1 (which abbreviates &quot;list users&quot;) is a common command to get the number of users connected to a server or network.

<text>Plywood is a composite material manufactured from thin layers, or &quot;plies&quot;, of wood veneer that have been stacked and glued together. It is an engineered wood from the family of manufactured boards, which include plywood, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), oriented strand board (OSB), and particle board (or chipboard).

All plywoods bind resin and wood fibre sheets (cellulose cells are long, strong and thin) to form a composite material. The sheets of wood are stacked such that each layer has its grain set typically (see below) perpendicular to its adjacent layers. This alternation of the grain is called &quot;cross-graining&quot; and has several important benefits: it reduces the tendency of wood to split when nailed at the edges; it reduces thickness swelling and shrinkage, providing improved dimensional stability; and it makes the strength of the panel consistent across all directions. There is usually an odd number of plies, so that the sheet is balanced, that is, the surface layers have their grains set parallel to one another. This balance reduces warping. Because plywood is bonded with grains running against one another and with an odd number of composite parts, it has high stiffness perpendicular to the grain direction of the surface ply. 

Smaller, thinner, and lower-quality plywoods may only have their plies (layers) arranged at right angles to each other. Some better-quality plywood products by design have five plies in steps of 45 degrees (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees), giving strength in multiple axes.

The word &quot;ply&quot; derives from the French verb , &quot;to fold&quot;, from the Latin verb , from the ancient Greek verb .

==History==
The ancient Egyptians and Greeks cut wood thinly and glued it together in layers with the grain in perpendicular directions as fine wood was in short supply. This is believed to have been done purely for cosmetic and economical purposes but it turned out to be a great alternative to pure wood as it reduced flex, making it a versatile building material.

In 1797 Samuel Bentham applied for patents covering several machines to produce veneers. In his patent applications, he described the concept of laminating several layers of veneer with glue to form a thicker piece – the first description of what we now call plywood. Bentham was a British naval engineer with many shipbuilding inventions to his credit. Veneers at the time of Bentham were flat sawn, rift sawn or quarter sawn; i.e. cut along or across the log manually in different angles to the grain and thus limited in width and length.

About fifty years later Immanuel Nobel, father of Alfred Nobel, realized that several thinner layers of wood bonded together would be stronger than a single thick layer of wood. Understanding the industrial potential of laminated wood, he invented the rotary lathe.

There is little record of the early implementation of the rotary lathe and the subsequent commercialization of plywood as we know it today, but in its 1870 edition, the French dictionary &quot;Robert&quot; describes the process of rotary lathe veneer manufacturing in its entry &quot;Déroulage&quot;. One can thus presume that rotary lathe plywood manufacturing was an established process in France in the 1860s. Plywood was introduced into the United States in 1865 and industrial production there started shortly after. In 1928, the first standard-sized 4 ft by 8 ft (1.22 m by 2.44 m) plywood sheets were introduced in the United States for use as a general building material.

Artists use plywood as a support for easel paintings to replace traditional canvas or cardboard. Ready-made &quot;artist boards&quot; for oil painting in three-layered plywood (3-ply) were produced and sold in New York as early as 1880.

There were experiments with gluing plywood with phenolic resins, mostly in the form of an alcoholic solution or powder, which, however, did not provide sufficient accuracy of application. Around 1930 a dry process of gluing veneers to plywood with phenolic resin in form of a film has begun to spread in the production of waterproof plywood. 

==Structural characteristics==
A typical plywood panel has face veneers of a higher grade than the core veneers. The principal function of the core layers is to increase the separation between the outer layers where the bending stresses are highest, thus increasing the panel&#x27;s resistance to bending. As a result, thicker panels can span greater distances under the same loads. In bending, the maximum stress occurs in the outermost layers, one in tension, the other in compression. Bending stress decreases from the maximum at the face layers to nearly zero at the central layer. Shear stress, by contrast, is higher in the center of the panel, and at the outer fibres. Within Europe basic plywood can be divided into three main categories: birch plywood (density approx. ), mixed plywood (density approx. ) and conifer plywoods (density 460–).

==Types==


Different varieties of plywood exist for different applications:

===Softwood===
Softwood plywood is usually made either of cedar, Douglas fir or spruce, pine, and fir (collectively known as spruce-pine-fir or SPF) or redwood and is typically used for construction and industrial purposes.

The most common dimension is or the slightly larger imperial dimension of 4 feet × 8 feet. Plies vary in thickness from 1.4 mm to 4.3 mm. The number of plies—which is always odd—depends on the thickness and grade of the sheet. Roofing can use the thinner plywood. Subfloors are at least thick, the thickness depending on the distance between floor joists. Plywood for flooring applications is often tongue and groove (T&amp;G); This prevents one board from moving up or down relative to its neighbor, providing a solid-feeling floor when the joints do not lie over joists. T&amp;G plywood is usually found in the range. 

===Hardwood===
Hardwood plywood is made out of wood from dicot trees (oak, beech and mahogany) and used for demanding end uses. Hardwood plywood is characterized by its excellent strength, stiffness, durability and resistance to creep. It has a high planar shear strength and impact resistance, which make it especially suitable for heavy-duty floor and wall structures. Oriented plywood construction has a high wheel-carrying capacity. Hardwood plywood has excellent surface hardness, and damage- and wear-resistance.

=== Tropical===
Tropical plywood is made of mixed hardwood species of tropical timber. Originally from the Asian region, it is now also manufactured in African and South American countries. Tropical plywood is superior to softwood plywood due to its density, strength, evenness of layers, and high quality. It is usually sold at a premium in many markets if manufactured with high standards. Tropical plywood is widely used in the UK, Japan, United States, Taiwan, Korea, Dubai, and other countries worldwide. It is used for construction purposes in many regions due to its low cost. However, many countries&#x27; forests have been over-harvested, including the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia, largely due to the demand for plywood production and export.

===Aircraft===
High-strength plywood, also known as aircraft plywood, is made from mahogany, spruce and/or birch using adhesives with an increased resistance to heat and humidity. It was used in the construction of air assault gliders during World War II and also several fighter aircraft, most notably the multi-role British Mosquito. Nicknamed &quot;The Wooden Wonder&quot;, plywood was used for the wing surfaces, and also flat sections such as bulkheads and the webs of the wing spars. The fuselage had exceptional rigidity from the bonded ply-balsa-ply &#x27;sandwich&#x27; of its monocoque shell; elliptical in cross-section, it was formed in two separate mirror-image halves, using curved moulds.

Structural aircraft-grade plywood is most commonly manufactured from African mahogany, spruce or birch veneers that are bonded together in a hot press over hardwood cores of basswood or poplar or from European Birch veneers throughout. Basswood is another type of aviation-grade plywood that is lighter and more flexible than mahogany and birch plywood but has slightly less structural strength. Aviation-grade plywood is manufactured to a number of specifications including those outlined since 1931 in the Germanischer Lloyd Rules for Surveying and Testing of Plywood for Aircraft and MIL-P-607, the latter of which calls for shear testing after immersion in boiling water for three hours to verify the adhesive qualities between the plies meets specifications. Aircraft grade plywood is made from three or more plies of birch, as thin as thick in total, and is extremely strong and light. 

Howard Hughes&#x27; H-4 Hercules was constructed of plywood. The plane was built by the Hughes Aircraft Company employing a plywood-and-resin Duramold process. The specialized wood veneer was made by Roddis Manufacturing in Marshfield, Wisconsin.

===Decorative (overlaid)===
Usually faced with hardwood, including ash, oak, red oak, birch, maple, mahogany, shorea (often called lauan, meranti, or Philippine mahogany, though having no relation to true mahogany), rosewood, teak and a large number of other hardwoods.

===Flexible===
Flexible plywood is designed for making curved parts, a practice which dates back to the 1850s in furniture making. At thick, mahogany three-ply &quot;wiggle board&quot; or &quot;bendy board&quot; come in sheets with a very thin cross-grain central ply and two thicker exterior plies, either long grain on the sheet, or cross grain. Wiggle board is often glued together in two layers once it is formed into the desired curve, so that the final shape will be stiff and resist movement. Often, decorative wood veneers are added as a surface layer.

In the United Kingdom single-ply sheets of veneer were used to make stove pipe hats in Victorian times, so flexible modern plywood is sometimes known there as &quot;hatters ply&quot;, although the original material was not strictly plywood, but a single sheet of veneer.

===Marine===
Marine plywood is manufactured from durable face and core veneers, with few defects so it performs longer in both humid and wet conditions and resists delaminating and fungal attack. Its construction is such that it can be used in environments where it is exposed to moisture for long periods. Each wood veneer will be from tropical hardwoods and have negligible core gap, limiting the chance of trapping water in the plywood and hence providing a solid and stable glue bond. It uses an exterior Weather and Boil Proof (WBP) glue similar to most exterior plywoods.

Marine plywood can be graded as being compliant with BS 1088, which is a British Standard for marine plywood and IS:710 is Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) for marine grade plywood. There are few international standards for grading marine plywood and most of the standards are voluntary. Some marine plywood has a Lloyd&#x27;s of London stamp that certifies it to be BS 1088 compliant. Some plywood is also labeled based on the wood used to manufacture it. Examples of this are Okoumé or Meranti.

In the UK, one can find builders&#x27; merchants advertising a grade of ply as &quot;marine ply&quot; that does not conform to BS 1088 - generally online adverts for these products will include a caveat along the lines of &quot;not suitable for boat

In India,marine ply is popularly called &quot;Kitply&quot; after the brand which popularised the concept of water proof marine plywood in the 1980&quot;s.

===Other===
Other types of plywoods include fire-retardant, moisture-resistant, wire mesh, sign-grade, and pressure-treated. However, the plywood may be treated with various chemicals to improve the plywood&#x27;s fireproofing. Each of these products is designed to fill a need in industry.

Baltic Birch plywood is a product of an area around the Baltic Sea. Originally manufactured for European cabinet makers but now popular in the United States as well. It is very stable composed of an inner void-free core of cross-banded birch plys with an exterior grade adhesive. The face veneers are thicker than traditional cabinet grade

== Production ==

Plywood production requires a good log, called a peeler, which is generally straighter and larger in diameter than one required for processing into dimensioned lumber by a sawmill. The log is laid horizontally and rotated about its long axis while a long blade is pressed into it, causing a thin layer of wood to peel off (much as a continuous sheet of paper from a roll). An adjustable nosebar, which may be solid or a roller, is pressed against the log during rotation, to create a &quot;gap&quot; for veneer to pass through between the knife and the nosebar. The nosebar partly compresses the wood as it is peeled; it controls vibration of the peeling knife; and assists in keeping the veneer being peeled to an accurate thickness. In this way the log is peeled into sheets of veneer, which are then cut to the desired oversize dimensions, to allow it to shrink (depending on wood species) when dried. The sheets are then patched, graded, glued together and then baked in a press at a temperature of at least , and at a pressure of up to (but more commonly ) to form the plywood panel. The panel can then be patched, have minor surface defects such as splits or small knot holes filled, re-sized, sanded or otherwise refinished, depending on the market for which it is intended.
Plywood for indoor use generally uses the less expensive urea-formaldehyde glue, which has limited water resistance, while outdoor and marine-grade plywood are designed to withstand moisture, and use a water-resistant resorcinol-formaldehyde or phenol-formaldehyde glue to prevent delamination and to retain strength in high humidity.

The adhesives used in plywood have become a point of concern. Both urea formaldehyde and phenol formaldehyde are carcinogenic in very high concentrations. As a result, many manufacturers are turning to low formaldehyde-emitting glue systems, denoted by an &quot;E&quot; rating. Plywood produced to &quot;E0&quot; has effectively zero formaldehyde emissions.

In addition to the glues being brought to the forefront, the wood resources themselves are becoming the focus of manufacturers, due in part to energy conservation, as well as concern for natural resources. There are several certifications available to manufacturers who participate in these programs. Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), and Greenguard are all certification programs that ensure that production and construction practices are sustainable. Many of these programs offer tax benefits to both the manufacturer and the end user.

==Sizes==
The most commonly used thickness range is from . The sizes of the most commonly used plywood sheets are which was first used by the Portland Manufacturing Company, who developed modern veneer core plywood for the 1905 Portland World Fair. A common metric size for a sheet of plywood is 1200 × 2400 mm. is also a common European size for Baltic birch ply, and aircraft ply.

Sizes on specialised plywood for concrete-forming can range from , and a multitude of formats exist, though 15 ×  (19/32in × 2 ft-6in × 4 ft-11in) is very commonly used.

Aircraft plywood is available in thicknesses of (3-ply construction) and upwards; typically aircraft plywood uses veneers of 0.5 mm (approx 1/64 in) thickness although much thinner veneers such as 0.1 mm are also used in construction of some of the thinner panels.

== Grades ==
Grading rules differ according to the country of origin. The most popular standards are the British Standard (BS) and the American Standard (ASTM). Joyce (1970), however, list some general indication of grading rules:


== Applications ==
Plywood is used in many applications that need high-quality, high-strength sheet material. Quality in this context means resistance to cracking, breaking, shrinkage, twisting and warping.

Exterior glued plywood is suitable for outdoor use, but because moisture affects the strength of wood, optimal performance is achieved where the moisture content remains relatively low. Subzero conditions do not affect the dimensional or strength properties of plywood, making some special applications possible.

Plywood is also used as an engineering material for stressed-skin applications. It has been used for marine and aviation applications since WWII. Most notable is the British de Havilland Mosquito bomber, with a fuselage made of birch plywood sandwiching a balsa core, and using plywood extensively for the wings. Plywood was also used for the hulls in the hard-chine Motor Torpedo Boats (MTB) and Motor Gun Boats (MGB) built by the British Power Boat Company and Vosper&#x27;s, American PT boats, and the Higgins landing craft critical to the D-Day landings. The American designers Charles and Ray Eames are known for their plywood-based furniture, as is Finnish Architect Alvar Aalto and his firm Artek, while Phil Bolger has designed a wide range of boats built primarily of plywood. Jack Köper of Cape Town designed the plywood Dabchick sailing dinghy, which is still sailed by large numbers of teenagers.

Plywood is often used to create curved surfaces because it can easily bend with the grain. Skateboard ramps often utilize plywood as the top smooth surface over bent curves to create transition that can simulate the shapes of ocean waves.

===Softwood plywood===
Typical end uses of spruce plywood are:
*Floors, walls, and roofs in home constructions
*Wind bracing panels
*Vehicle internal body work
*Packages and boxes
*Fencing

There are coating solutions available that mask the prominent grain structure of spruce plywood. For these coated plywoods there are some end uses where reasonable strength is needed but the lightness of spruce is a benefit, e.g.:
*Concrete shuttering panels
*Ready-to-paint surfaces for constructions

===Hardwood plywood===
Phenolic resin film coated (Film Faced) hardwood plywood is typically used as a ready-to-install component e.g.:
*Panels in concrete form work systems
*Floors, walls and roofs in transport vehicles
*Container floors
*Floors subjected to heavy wear in various buildings and factories
*Scaffolding materials

::(&quot;Wire&quot; or other styles of imprinting available for better traction)

Birch plywood is used as a structural material in special applications e.g.:
*Wind turbine blades
*Insulation boxes for liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers

Smooth surface and accurate thickness combined with the durability of the material makes birch plywood a favorable material for many special end uses e.g.:
*High-end loud speakers
*Die-cutting boards
*Supporting structure for parquet
*Playground equipment
*Furniture
*Signs and fences for demanding outdoor advertising
*Musical instruments
*Sports equipment

===Tropical plywood===
Tropical plywood is widely available from the South-East Asia region, mainly from Malaysia and Indonesia.

*Common plywood
*Concrete panel
*Floor base
*Structure panel
*Container flooring
*Lamin board
*Laminated veneer lumber (LVL)

<doc id="72230" wikidata="Q332454" url="?curid=72230" title="Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook">
<text>William Maxwell Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook (25 May 1879 – 9 June 1964), was a Canadian-British newspaper publisher and backstage politician who was an influential figure in British media and politics of the first half of the 20th century. His base of power was the largest circulation newspaper in the world, the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, which appealed to the conservative working class with intensely patriotic news and editorials. During the Second World War, he played a major role in mobilising industrial resources as Winston Churchill&#x27;s Minister of Aircraft Production.

The young Max Aitken had a gift for making money and was a millionaire by the age of 30. His business ambitions quickly exceeded opportunities in Canada and he moved to Britain. There he befriended Andrew Bonar Law and with his support won a seat in the House of Commons at the December 1910 United Kingdom general election. A knighthood followed shortly after. During the First World War he ran the Canadian Records office in London, and played a role in the removal of H. H. Asquith as prime minister in 1916. The resulting coalition government (with David Lloyd George as prime minister and Bonar Law as Chancellor of the Exchequer) rewarded Aitken with a peerage and, briefly, a Cabinet post as Minister of Information.

After the war, the now Lord Beaverbrook concentrated on his business interests. He built the &quot;Daily Express&quot; into the most successful mass-circulation newspaper in the world, with sales of 2.25 million copies a day across Britain. He used it to pursue personal campaigns, most notably for tariff reform and for the British Empire to become a free trade bloc. Beaverbrook supported the governments of Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain throughout the 1930s and was persuaded by another long-standing political friend, Winston Churchill, to serve as his Minister of Aircraft Production from May 1940. Churchill later praised his &quot;vital and vibrant energy&quot;. He resigned due to ill-health in 1941 but later in the war was appointed Lord Privy Seal.

Beaverbrook spent his later life running his newspapers, which by then included the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;. He served as Chancellor of the University of New Brunswick and developed a reputation as a historian with his books on political and military history.

==Early life==
Aitken was born in Maple, Ontario, Canada, in 1879, one of the ten children of William Cuthbert Aitken, a Scottish-born Presbyterian minister, and Jane (Noble), the daughter of a prosperous local farmer and storekeeper Joseph Vaughan Noble. When he was a year old, the family moved to Newcastle, New Brunswick, which Aitken later considered to be his hometown. It was here, at the age of 13, that he set up a school newspaper, &quot;The Leader&quot;. Whilst at school, he delivered newspapers, sold newspaper subscriptions and was the local correspondent for the &quot;St John Daily Star&quot;.

Aitken took the entrance examinations for Dalhousie University, but because he had declined to sit the Greek and Latin papers he was refused entry. He registered at the King&#x27;s College Law School, but left after a short while. This was to be his only formal higher education. Aitken worked in a shop, then borrowed some money to move to Chatham, New Brunswick, where he worked as a local correspondent for the &quot;Montreal Star&quot;, sold life insurance and collected debts. Aitken attempted to train as a lawyer and worked for a short time in the law office of R. B. Bennett, a future prime minister of Canada. Aitken managed Bennett&#x27;s successful campaign for a place on Chatham town council. When Bennett left the law firm, Aitken moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, where he again sold life insurance before moving to Calgary where he helped to run Bennett&#x27;s campaign for a seat in the legislative assembly of the North-West Territories in the 1898 general election. After an unsuccessful attempt to establish a meat business, Aitken returned to Saint John and to selling insurance.

==Early business career==
In 1900, Aitken made his way to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where John F. Stairs, a member of the city&#x27;s dominant business family, gave him employment and trained him in the business of finance. In 1904, when Stairs launched the Royal Securities Corporation, Aitken became a minority shareholder and the firm&#x27;s general manager. Under the tutelage of Stairs, who would be his mentor and friend, Aitken engineered a number of successful business deals and was planning a series of bank mergers.

Stairs&#x27; unexpected early death in September 1904 led to Aitken acquiring control of the company and moving to Montreal, then the business capital of Canada. There he bought and sold companies, invested in stocks and shares and also developed business interests in both Cuba and Puerto Rico. He started a weekly magazine, the &quot;Canadian Century&quot; in 1910, invested in the &quot;Montreal Herald&quot; and almost acquired the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;. In 1907 he founded the Montreal Engineering Company. In 1909, also under the umbrella of his Royal Securities Company, Aitken founded the Calgary Power Company Limited, now the TransAlta Corporation, and oversaw the building of the Horseshoe Falls hydro station.

In 1910–1911 Aitken acquired a number of small regional cement plants in Canada, including Sir Sandford Fleming&#x27;s Western Canada Cement Co. plant at Exshaw, Alberta, and amalgamated them into Canada Cement, eventually controlling four-fifths of the cement production in Canada. Canada was booming economically at the time, and Aitken had close to a monopoly on the material. There were irregularities in the stock transfers leading to the conglomeration of the cement plants, resulting in much criticism of Aitken, as well as accusations of price-gouging and poor management of the cement plants under his company&#x27;s control. Aitken sold his shares, making a large amount of money.

Aitken had made his first visit to Britain in September 1908, and when he returned there in the spring of 1910, in an attempt to raise money to form a steel company, he decided to make the move permanent, but not before he led the underwriting, with a preponderance of British money, of an amalgamation of smaller units into the Steel Company of Canada. Very shortly later Aitken moved his family to the UK.

==Move to Britain==

In 1910, Aitken moved to Britain and he became friends with Bonar Law, a native of New Brunswick and the only Canadian to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The two men had a lot in common: they were both sons of the manse from Scottish-Canadian families and both were successful businessmen. Aitken persuaded Bonar Law to support him in standing for the Unionist Party in the December 1910 general election at Ashton-under-Lyne. Aitken was an excellent organiser and, with plenty of money for publicity, he won the seat by 196 votes. Aitken&#x27;s &quot;bumptious&quot; election campaign brought him some notoriety.

Aitken rarely spoke in the House of Commons, but he did promise substantial financial support to the Unionist Party, and in 1911 he was knighted by King George V. Aitken&#x27;s political influence grew when Bonar Law replaced A.J. Balfour as leader of the Unionist party late in 1911. Aitken&#x27;s demands for a protectionist bloc uniting the British empire made him into a disruptive force in the Conservative and Unionist ranks as the idea of a bloc would mean higher food prices, making the plan unpopular with many segments of the British people who disliked the &quot;food taxes&quot; and &quot;stomach taxes&quot;. The great dividing line in British politics were between the Whole Hoggers who were willing to accept higher food prices as the consequences of a protectionist bloc vs. the Free Fooders who were not. Aitken had a financial interest in the supporting the Whole Hoggers as in 1912 he purchased all of the grain terminals in Alberta in the expectation that an Imperial Preference tariffs would soon be enacted as law. Aitken had little to do as an MP, and set about seeking the acceptance of British elites. The British historian Neal Ascherson wrote: &quot;The first is that posh English society was no match for him. He was &#x27;vulgar&#x27;, but there was a charm in his self-promotion which made languid ladies and gentlemen want to be on his side and at his side. He was wildly rich even then, but knew how to use his wealth in hospitality and (discreetly) by rescuing grand friends from awkward debts. Above all, he was fun to be with.&quot;

In 1911, Aitken was strongly opposed to the reciprocity agreement with the United States signed by the Liberal prime minister of Canada, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, which he believed would lead to the American annexation of Canada. As such, Aitken temporarily returned to Canada to vigorously campaign for the Conservatives led by Sir Robert Borden. Aitken had his friend Rudyard Kipling intervene in the election on the behalf of the Conservatives. At the time the line between British and English-Canadian national identities was more blurred than today, and Aitken did not regard Kipling as a &quot;foreign&quot; figure. On 7 September 1911, the &quot;Montreal Daily Star&quot; (the most widely read newspaper in Canada at the time) published a front-page appeal to all Canadians by Kipling where he wrote: &quot;It is her own soul that Canada risks today. Once that soul is pawned for any consideration, Canada must inevitably conform to the commercial, legal, financial, social and ethical standards which will be imposed on her by the sheer admitted weight of the United States.&quot; Kipling&#x27;s article attracted much attention in Canada and was reprinted in every English-language Canadian newspaper over the following week, where it was credited with helping the Conservatives win the election.

Aitken bought Cherkley Court near Leatherhead in Surrey and entertained lavishly there. In 1913 the house was offered as a venue for negotiations between Bonar Law and the Prime Minister, H.H. Asquith, over Ulster and Irish home rule. Later in life Aitken wrote about his early political efforts:

Aitken continued to grow his business interests while in Parliament, and also began to build a British newspaper empire. After the death of Charles Rolls in 1910, Aitken bought his shares in Rolls-Royce Limited, and over the next two years gradually increased his holding in the company. However, Claude Johnson, Rolls-Royce&#x27;s Commercial managing director, resisted his attempt to gain control of the company, and in October 1913 Aitken sold his holding to James Buchanan Duke of the American Tobacco Company. In January 1911 Aitken secretly invested £25,000 in the failing &quot;Daily Express&quot;. An attempt to buy the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; failed, but he did gain control of another London evening paper, &quot;The Globe&quot;. In November 1916 a share deal worth £17,500, with Lawson Johnson, landed Aitken a controlling interest in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, but again he kept the deal secret.

==First World War==

Due to the outbreak of the First World War, Aitken was able to show off his great organisational skills. He was innovative in the employment of artists, photographers and film makers to record life on the Western Front. Aitken also established the Canadian War Memorials Fund, which evolved into a collection of art works by the premier artists and sculptors in Britain and Canada. In accordance with establishing these works, he was also instrumental in creating the Canadian War Records Office in London and arranged for stories about Canadian forces appearing in newspapers. His visits to the Western Front, with the honorary rank of colonel in the Canadian Army, resulted in his 1916 book &quot;Canada in Flanders&quot;, a three-volume collection that chronicled the achievements of Canadian soldiers on the battlefields. Aitken also wrote several books after the war, including &quot;Politicians and the Press&quot; in 1925 and &quot;Politicians and the War&quot; in 1928. At a time when censorship was extremely strict with British journalists being kept away from the Western Front, Aitken&#x27;s &#x27;Eyewitness&#x27; reports from the Western Front, which were published in the Canadian newspapers made him famous.

Aitken became increasingly hostile towards the British Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, whom he considered to be mismanaging the war effort. Aitken&#x27;s opinion of Asquith did not improve when he failed to get a post in the Cabinet reshuffle of May 1915. An attempt by Bonar Law to secure the Order of St Michael and St George for Aitken was also blocked by Asquith. After the failure of the Dardanelles campaign, Winston Churchill was sacked as the First Lord of the Admiralty, and Aitken went to see him to offer him his sympathy. Aitken wrote about Churchill: &quot;The charm, the imaginative sympathy of his hours of defeat, the self-confidence, the arrogance of his hours of power and prosperity&quot;. Later, when Churchill went to the Western Front, Aitken allowed him to stay as his guest at his house in Saint-Omer. Ascherson wrote: &quot;A momentous friendship began. In return for contacts and inside information, Aitken would give Churchill hope and energy, and Churchill – in spite of some volcanic quarrels over the next half-century – came to rely on him not only as a political and journalistic ally but as an unfailing source of optimism, gossip, reassurance and sheer fun.&quot;

Aitken was happy to play a small part, which he greatly exaggerated, as a go-between when Asquith was forced from office and replaced by David Lloyd George in December 1916. The man Aitken wanted to see replace Asquith was Bonar Law, not Lloyd George. Lloyd George offered to appoint Aitken as President of the Board of Trade. At that time, an MP taking a cabinet post for the first time had to resign and stand for re-election in a by-election. Aitken made arrangements for this, but then Lloyd George decided to appoint Albert Stanley instead. Aitken was a friend of Stanley and agreed to continue with the resignation, so that Stanley could take Aitken&#x27;s seat in Parliament and be eligible for ministerial office. In return, Aitken received a peerage on 23 January 1917 as the &quot;1st Baron Beaverbrook&quot;, the name &quot;Beaverbrook&quot; being adopted from a small community near his boyhood home. He had initially considered &quot;Lord Miramichi&quot;, but rejected it on the advice of Louise Manny as too difficult to pronounce. The name &quot;Beaverbrook&quot; also had the advantage of conveying a distinctive Canadian ring to the title.

Beaverbrook&#x27;s controlling stake in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; became public knowledge later in 1917, and he was criticised by parts of the Conservative Party for financing a publication they regarded as irresponsible and often unhelpful to the party.

On 10 February 1918, Beaverbrook became the first minister in the newly formed Ministry of Information, was also made Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and was sworn of the Privy Council. Beaverbrook became responsible for propaganda in Allied and neutral countries and Lord Northcliffe (owner of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;) became Director of Propaganda with control of propaganda in enemy countries. Beaverbrook established the British War Memorials Committee within the Ministry, on lines similar to the earlier Canadian war art scheme, but when he established a private charity that would receive income from BWMC exhibitions, it was regarded as a conflict of interest and he dropped the scheme. Beaverbrook had a number of clashes with the Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour over the use of intelligence material. He felt that intelligence should become part of his department, but Balfour disagreed. Eventually the intelligence committee was assigned to Beaverbrook but they then resigned &quot;en masse&quot; to be re-employed by the Foreign Office. In August 1918, Lloyd George became furious with Beaverbrook over a leader in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; threatening to withdraw support from the government over tariff reform. Beaverbrook increasingly came under attack from MPs who distrusted a press baron being employed by the state. He survived but became increasingly frustrated with his limited role and influence, and in October 1918 he resigned due to ill-health. A tooth had become infected with actinomycosis and the often fatal disease progressed into his throat; his English doctors were unable to provide a cure, and it was a Portuguese medic who cured him by administering iodine solution orally until the infection was arrested.

A. J. P. Taylor later wrote that Beaverbrook was a pathbreaker who &quot;invented all the methods of publicity&quot; used by Britain to promote the war, including the nation&#x27;s first war artists, the first war photographers, and the first makers of war films. He was especially effective in promoting the sales of war bonds to the general public. Nevertheless, he was widely disliked and distrusted by the political elite, who were suspicious of all they sneeringly called &quot;press lords&quot;.

==Press baron==

After the war, Beaverbrook concentrated on running the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. He turned the dull newspaper into a glittering and witty journal with an optimistic attitude, filled with an array of dramatic photo layouts. He hired first-rate writers such as Francis Williams and the cartoonist David Low. He embraced new technology and bought new presses to print the paper in Manchester. In 1919 the circulation of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; was under 40,000 a day; by 1937 it was 2,329,000 a day, making it the most successful of all British newspapers and generating huge profits for Beaverbrook whose wealth was already such that he never took a salary. After the Second World War, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; became the largest-selling newspaper in the world, with a circulation of 3,706,000. Beaverbrook launched the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; in December 1918, but it only established a significant readership after John Junor became its editor in 1954. In 1923, in a joint deal with Lord Rothermere, Beaverbrook bought the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. Beaverbrook acquired a controlling stake in the Glasgow &quot;Evening Citizen&quot;, and in 1928 he launched the &quot;Scottish Daily Express&quot;.

After the death of Lord Northcliffe in 1922, Beaverbrook, with Lords Rothermere, Camrose and Kemsley became one of the four so-called press barons that were the dominant figures in the inter-war press. By 1937 the four owned nearly one in every two national and local daily papers sold in Britain, as well as one in every three Sunday papers that were sold. The combined circulation of all their newspapers amounted to over thirteen million.

Beaverbrook purchased The Vineyard, Fulham, a &quot;tiny Tudor house in Hurlingham Road&quot; where ... &quot;far from the centre of London I was relieved of casual callers and comparatively free of long-winded visitors. I provided facilities by means of private telephone lines without any direct contact with the Telephone Exchanges. Thus the political conferences held there were safeguarded against interruption.&quot; Powerful friends and acquaintances such as Asquith, Lloyd George, Churchill, Frederick Edwin Smith, Philip Sassoon, Diana and Duff Cooper, Balfour and Tim Healy were guests at both Cherkley and the Vineyard. The circle included Valentine Castlerosse, H. G. Wells and Rudyard Kipling, who was godfather to Beaverbrook&#x27;s youngest son Peter, but this did nothing to repair the rift that developed between them when Beaverbrook endorsed Irish Home Rule.

Beaverbrook, the first baron of Fleet Street, was often denounced as excessively powerful because his newspapers supposedly could make or break almost anyone. Beaverbrook enjoyed using his papers to attack his opponents and to promote his friends. From 1919 to 1922 he attacked David Lloyd George and his government on several issues. A colorful character, the American historian Randall Woods described him as &quot;...a sharp, intense, unpredictable man. He was something of a firebrand, tending to overstatement and even irresponsibility in his editorials or public statements...Conspiracy was second nature to him...In conversation, Beaverbrook was constantly exaggerating and embellishing.&quot; Beaverbrook was considered to be likeable character full of charm and zest, but he was widely distrusted by the British elite as he was viewed as an unprincipled intriguer. A flamboyant, charismatic man full of dynamism and exuberance who stood out on the account of his Canadian Maritime accent, Beaverbrook was the subject of much fascination by the public. He was disliked by his employees as a demanding boss who had telephones installed in every room of his house so that he could always call his newspapers editors to give his orders about what story was interesting him at the moment without having to wait. Beaverbrook&#x27;s much vaunted principle of &quot;independence&quot; under which he felt free to attack his allies via his newspapers made him few friends.

Though a Conservative, Beaverbrook was opposed to British intervention in the Russian civil war and used his newspapers to argue that the question of who ruled Russia was no business of Britain&#x27;s. Beaverbrook had one of his periodic falling outs with Churchill at the time, and saw attacking intervention in the Russian civil war, which Churchill had strongly promoted, as a way of lashing out. For example, on 6 September 1919, Beaverbrook ran on the front page of &quot;The Daily Express&quot; a banner headline, &quot;ARCHANGEL SCANDAL EXPOSED: FAMOUS VC APPEALS TO THE NATION&quot; above an article attacking the intervention as pointless and singled Churchill as the author of an expedition that had gone horribly wrong. The subtitle of the article was &quot;DUPLICITY OF CHRUCHILL&#x27;S POLICY TOWARDS RUSSIA-THE PUBLIC HUMBUGGED&quot;. A linked article claimed that the British force in Arkhangelsk were poised to go deep into Russia with the aim of overthrowing the Bolshevik regime and Churchill had lied to the British people about the purpose of the expedition. In 1920, Beaverbrook opposed to British aid to Poland under the grounds that the Soviet-Polish war did not involve British interests.
Beaverbrook opposed Zionism and visited Palestine in 1923. There, he hired anti-Zionist writer Jacob Israël de Haan to be the &quot;Daily Express&quot; correspondent. De Haan wrote anonymously for his own safety, but was nevertheless identified and murdered by the Zionist Haganah the following year.

Beaverbrook began supporting independent Conservative candidates and campaigned for fifteen years to remove Stanley Baldwin from the leadership of the Conservative Party. In the 1924 election, he used the &quot;Daily Express&quot; to associate the Labour Party with the Soviet Union, writing in a leader: &quot;We are not fighting Mr. Ramsay MacDonald in his saner moments, but the Russian Bolshevists and the shade of Lenin.&quot; The &quot;Daily Express&quot; did not first publish the so-called Zinoviev letter, a probably forged letter in which Grigory Zinoviev, the chief of the Comintern, was alleged to order British Communists to infiltrate the Labour Party and the military, which was published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; instead. However, after the Zinoviev letter was published, Beaverbrook had the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in its coverage of 1924 election associate the Labour Party with Communism. The cartoons which the &quot;Daily Express&quot; published tended to depict Communists as alien, dirty, hairy, and unkempt, thereby associating them with popular stereotypes of the poor.

In foreign policy, Beaverbrook promoted a policy known as &quot;empire isolationism&quot;, namely that Britain should devote its interests to the British empire, but be otherwise disengaged from the rest of the world. A recurring theme of Beaverbrook&#x27;s newspapers was that Britain was not a European nation, and should have as little to do as possible with the affairs of Europe. Likewise, Beaverbrook was opposed to British membership in the League of Nations and in a 1923 leader advocated giving up the Palestine Mandate (modern Israel), which Britain held as the administering power for the League, under the grounds that Palestine was more of a debit than a credit for the British empire. A typical statement from Beaverbrook was: &quot;The British empire exists for the British race. It is our heritage. Let us cultivate it, defend it, cherish it, and make it great, rich and strong in righteousness, an example and object lesson for the rest of mankind&quot;. In 1925, Beaverbrook wrote: &quot;In the Empire and not in Europe our future lies and the &quot;Daily Express&quot; has never failed to preach the Imperial doctrine in good or bad times. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; believes that the British Empire is the greatest instrument for good the world has ever seen&quot;. Beaverbrook believed that protecting the greatness as he saw it of the empire could be best accomplished via &quot;splendid isolation&quot; as he consistently argued for an isolationist foreign policy. In 1925, Beaverbrook via the &quot;Daily Express&quot; was strongly opposed to the Treaty of Locarno under which Britain &quot;guaranteed&quot; the current borders of France, Belgium, and Germany along with the permanent demilitarized status of the Rhineland as involvement in European conflicts where no British interests were at stake.

Reflecting his origins, Beaverbrook always thought in terms of the British empire rather than of Britain, and he had an essentially Commonwealth perspective as he argued that the Dominions were just as important as Britain in holding the empire together. Beaverbrook believed that because Britain had more people than what British agriculture was capable of feeding while the Dominions produced more food than what their people needed that a symbiotic relationship would be possible with British industry supplying the manufactured goods for the Dominions while the Dominions would supply food and other raw materials to Britain. As such, Beaverbrook wanted to see the end of all trade barriers within the Commonwealth and a system of tariffs to keep non-Commonwealth products out of the Commonwealth to form what he called the Empire Free Trade zone. Taylor credited Beaverbrook&#x27;s Canadian origins for his beliefs about an &quot;Empire Free Trade zone&quot; as he wrote: &quot;At the bottom this was pure sentiment, a desire to be both British as well as Canadian, and a desire, also characteristic of a Canadian, that the British empire should maintain its independence from the United States&quot;.

Beaverbrook had long resented Baldwin&#x27;s leadership of the Conservative Party and the loss of his influence that had followed the resignation of Bonar Law in 1923. Beaverbrook had privately &quot;rejoiced&quot; when the Conservatives lost the 1929 election, seeing Labour&#x27;s victory as a chance to impose his views on the Conservative party, especially with regard to the Empire Free Trade zone. Through there was much discontent within the Conservative ranks over Baldwin&#x27;s leadership, Beaverbrook was regarded as an &quot;untouchable&quot; by the Conservative elite. In July 1929, Beaverbrook launched the Empire Crusade movement to campaign for the &quot;Empire Free Trade zone&quot;, which attracted support from various Tory backbencher MPs, peers and local riding associations.

He very shrewdly sold the majority of his share holdings before the 1929 crash and in the resulting depression launched a new political party to promote free trade within the British Empire. Empire Free Trade Crusade candidates had some success. An Independent Conservative who supported Empire Free Trade won the Twickenham by-election in 1929. In December 1929, Beaverbrook set up a central office to co-ordinate the Empire Crusade movement. However, Beaverbrook could not quite decide if the purpose of the Empire Crusade was to depose Baldwin or just merely have the Conservative party give him the respect he felt he deserved. In February 1930, the Empire Crusade movement was joined by Lord Rothermere, the proprietor of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. Beaverbrook and Rothermere founded that month the United Empire Party. The United Empire Party was intended to split the right-wing vote to such an extent that it would be impossible for the Conservatives to ever win a general vote again, and in this way Rothermre and Beaverbrook intended to impose their will on the Conservative party. However, Beaverbrook and Rothermere differed in their intentions. Rothermere made it very clear that he wanted to see Baldwin replaced with a puppet leader of his choosing. Likewise, Rothermere had doubts about the &quot;food taxes&quot; as the proposed tariffs on food were known and promoted a &quot;no-surrender line&quot; with regard to the Government of India act. The Empire Free Trade candidate won the South Paddington by-election in October 1930. In February 1931, Empire Free Trade lost the Islington East by-election and by splitting the vote with the Conservatives allowed Labour to hold a seat they had been expected to lose. Duff Cooper&#x27;s victory for the Conservatives in St George&#x27;s Westminster by-election in March 1931 marked the end of the movement as an electoral force.

On 17 March 1931, during the St George&#x27;s Westminster by-election, Stanley Baldwin described the media barons who owned British newspapers as having &quot;Power without responsibility – the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages.&quot;

==&quot;Empire Isolationism&quot; and appeasement==
In March 1933, he visited Germany where he wrote that it was his impression that &quot;the stories of Jewish persecution are exaggerated&quot;. His most enduring impressions of his German trip was he felt that SA could not march properly, and he seemed to regard the Nazis as something of a joke who were not capable of achieving much of anything. Beaverbrook frequently changed his views about Adolf Hitler, which caused the obituary writers that worked for him much anguish as they were forced to change their drafts of a Hitler obituary from positive to negative to positive again. After the Night of the Long Knives, Beaverbrook &quot;turned solidly, fanatically anti-Hitler&quot; as he compared Hitler to Al Capone and the Nazis to gangsters. Beaverbrook was to change his opinions about Hitler a number of times afterward.

In a guest opinion column published in April 1935 in the Hearst newspapers, Beaverbrook set out to explain &quot;the section of opinion to which I belong - the Isolationists&quot;. Beaverbrook advocated that: &quot;Britain should make no alliances except with the United States, that we should incur no obligations, no responsibilities, no liabilities outside of the Empire except in relation to the Anglo-Saxon race&quot;. He supported the &quot;limited liability&quot; rearmament under which the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy were built up at the expense of the British Army as the rearmament programme in best accord with his own foreign policy ideas. In 1935, Beaverbrook campaigned against the Peace Ballot, an unofficial referendum organised in 1935 by the League of Nations Union, as the &quot;Ballot of Blood&quot;. He was concerned that if Britain should be obliged to enforce the collective security policies of the League of Nations against aggression, it could involve Britain in wars where no British interests were at stake. In a leader in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, he wrote the collective security policy of the League &quot;will drag you and your children into a war&quot; caused by &quot;the ambitious and unscrupulous powers&quot; that were the other members of the League (Beaverbrook failed to mention that to activate collective security required the approval of the League Council, of which Britain was a veto-holding member). Beaverbrook stated that his readers should not take part in the Peace Ballot and wrote: &quot;Tear up the ballot paper. Throw the pieces in the waste paper basket. Turn away from Europe. Stand by the Empire and Splendid Isolation&quot;.

During the crisis caused by the Italian aggression against Ethiopia, Beaverbrook was opposed to the policy of imposing sanctions on Italy under the banner of the League of Nations as he argued that the Italo-Ethiopian war did not concern Britain. In a leader, he warned that the sanctions on Italy might cause a &quot;world race war&quot; as he stated that Ethiopia was not worth fighting for as it was an African nation. Likewise, when Germany remilitarized the Rhineland on 7 March 1936, violating both the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Locarno, Beaverbrook used his newspapers to argue against Britain taking action to enforce the treaties it had signed. Beaverbrook maintained good relations with Ivan Maisky, the Soviet ambassador in London, writing to him in 1936 about his &quot;...friendly attitude towards your Great Leader&quot; and he was &quot;determined that nothing shall be said or done by any newspaper controlled by me which is likely to disturb your tenure in office&quot;. Beaverbrook concluded &quot;while I am free, and my newspapers in the attitude I take to the Russian leader, I must say I admire and praise his conduct of government&quot;. In 1936, at the invitation of Joachim von Ribbentrop, the new German ambassador to the Court of St. James, Beaverbrook attended the opening of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, but quickly became bored with the Third Reich and soon returned to Britain.&quot;

In the 1930s, while personally attempting to dissuade King Edward VIII from continuing his affair with American divorcee, Wallis Simpson, Beaverbrook&#x27;s newspapers published every titbit of the affair, especially allegations about pro-Nazi sympathies. Reflecting his &quot;empire isolationism&quot;, Beaverbrook used the &quot;Daily Express&quot; to promote British neutrality as he wrote a leader which compared supporting the Spanish Republic as alike to supporting the Whites in the Russian civil war as he declared that British intervention in the Russian civil war &quot;cost us some thousands of British soldiers&#x27; lives, £100,000,000 in cash, and the bitter enmity of the Russian government for the next ten years...and the intervention failed anyway. Britain had backed a loser. It is the mark of a mug to go on backing the same loser&quot;. In 1936, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; published an opinion piece by Lloyd George who had just returned from meeting Hitler at the Nuremberg Party Rally in which he called &quot;der Führer&quot; &quot;the George Washington of Germany&quot;. Beaverbrook published the piece, but told Lloyd George that he was embarrassed by it as he disliked &quot;the regimentation of opinion&quot; in Germany. In regards to the Sino-Japanese war, Beaverbrook was entirely concerned about a possible Japanese threat to the British empire and used the &quot;Daily Express&quot; to sound his fears that the Japanese might try to seize the British colonies in Asia. In a 1938 leader, Beaverbrook warned: &quot;Too many people would be interested in checking Japan if that country really MEANT trouble against white people...The British public seem to have sensed what the British ministers have not - that Japan is dynamiting her way not only through the Chinese empire, but dangerously near other empires. Get out your map!&quot; Along the leader was a map that showed the proximity of Japanese troops to Hong Kong. Beaverbrook supported the Munich Agreement and hoped the newly named Duke of Windsor would seek a peace deal with Germany.

Testifying before a Parliamentary inquiry in 1947, former &quot;Express&quot; employee and future MP Michael Foot alleged that Beaverbrook kept a blacklist of notable public figures who were to be denied any publicity in his papers because of personal disputes. Foot said they included Sir Thomas Beecham, Paul Robeson, Haile Selassie and Noël Coward. Beaverbrook himself gave evidence before the inquiry and vehemently denied the allegations; Express Newspapers general manager E. J. Robertson denied that Robeson had been blacklisted, but did admit that Coward had been &quot;boycotted&quot; because he had enraged Beaverbrook with his film &quot;In Which We Serve&quot;, for in the opening sequence Coward included an ironic shot showing a copy of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; floating in the dockside rubbish bearing the headline &quot;No War This Year&quot;.

In the late 1930s, Beaverbrook used his newspapers to promote the appeasement policies of the Chamberlain government. The slogan &#x27;There will be no war&#x27; was used by the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. At the time of the Sudetenland crisis, Beaverbrook wrote in a leader: &quot;... do not get caught up in quarrels over foreign boundaries that do not concern you.&quot; Beaverbrook was strongly opposed to the famous &quot;guarantee&quot; offered by Chamberlain for Poland in the House of Commons on 31 March 1939 under his usual grounds that Britain had no interests in Poland, and no reason to go to war for Poland. Beaverbrook told Maisky: &quot;I want the empire to remain intact, but I don&#x27;t understand why for the sake of this we must wage a three-year war to crush &quot;Hitlerism&quot;...Poland, Czechoslovakia? What are they to do with us? Cursed be the day when Chamberlain gave our guarantees to Poland!&quot; On 4 August 1939, a leader in &quot;The Daily Express&quot; questioned the need for British commitments to Poland as it was declared: &quot;while there are some reasons in favour of an alliance with France...our alliances in Eastern Europe are another matter&quot;.&quot; On 7 August 1939, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; ran a banner headline saying &quot;No War This Year&quot; as it predicated the Danzig crisis would be settled peacefully. In a memo dated 3 March 1943, Beaverbrook was unapologetic about the &quot;no war&quot; headlines as he wrote: &quot;The prophecy proved wrong. The policy, had it been pursued more vigorously might have proved it right&quot;. The British historian Daniel Hucker wrote that Beaverbrook was out of touch with the readers of his newspapers in the summer of 1939.

==Second World War==

Though Beaverbrook did not welcome the British declaration of war on the &quot;Reich&quot; on 3 September 1939, he had his newspapers take an ultra-patriotic line in supporting the war effort, not least because he knew the vast majority of his readers supported the war. During the Second World War, in May 1940, his friend Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, appointed Beaverbrook as Minister of Aircraft Production. Beaverbrook was given almost dictatorial powers over all aspects of aircraft production. In June 1940, Beaverbrook went with Churchill in a desperate mission to Tours to meet the French government with the aim of keeping France in the war. The French Premier, Paul Reynaud, was against an armistice with Germany and in favor of continuing the war from Algeria, but the strongest voice in the French cabinet was that of Marshal Philippe Pétain, the revered &quot;Victor of Verdun&quot;, who argued for an immediate armistice. Churchill devised a scheme for an Anglo-French Union as a way to keep France in the war, which Beaverbrook was strongly opposed to. Unlike Churchill, Beaverbrook did not see any particular importance of keeping France in the war, and was much more indifferent to the prospect of France being defeated than was the prime minister, arguing that Britain still had the Commonwealth and the empire. Churchill&#x27;s viewpoint that if France were occupied, it would shorten the flying time of the Luftwaffe to bomb Britain from hours to minutes and allow the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; to use the French Atlantic ports to attack shipping in the Western Approaches made no impression on Beaverbrook. The plans for an Anglo-French union fell flat when Pétain - who regarded the plan for a union as a way for the British to seize France&#x27;s colonial empire - persuaded the French cabinet to reject it.

With Churchill&#x27;s blessing, Beaverbrook overhauled all aspects of war-time aircraft production. He increased production targets by 15% across the board, took control of aircraft repairs and RAF storage units, replaced the management of plants that were underperforming, and released German Jewish engineers from internment to work in the factories. He seized materials and equipment destined for other departments and was perpetually at odds with the Air Ministry. Beaverbrook did not tolerate the arguments that supply &quot;bottlenecks&quot; were hindering aircraft production and required that aircraft manufacturers submit to him a daily list of &quot;bottlenecks&quot; which he made his mission to resolve. One of Beaverbrook&#x27;s first acts as minister of aircraft production was to order the &quot;cannibalization&quot; of all wrecked aircraft which totalled about 2,000 aeroplanes. For every two wrecked planes, it was possible to fashion a new plane. His appeal for pots and pans &quot;to make Spitfires&quot; was afterwards revealed by his son Sir Max Aitken to have been nothing more than a propaganda exercise. Still, a &quot;Time Magazine&quot; cover story declared, &quot;Even if Britain goes down this fall, it will not be Lord Beaverbrook&#x27;s fault. If she holds out, it will be his triumph. This war is a war of machines. It will be won on the assembly line.&quot;

Under Beaverbrook, fighter and bomber production increased so much so that Churchill declared: &quot;His personal force and genius made this Aitken&#x27;s finest hour.&quot; Beaverbrook&#x27;s impact on wartime production has been much debated but he certainly energized production at a time when it was desperately needed. The biography by Anthony Furze of Wilfrid Freeman, a senior official in the Ministry of Aircraft Production, discusses the Beaverbrook myth &#x27;Magic is nine tenth&#x27;s illusion&#x27; describing how Freeman had to limit the worst side-effects of Beaverbrook&#x27;s short-term thinking (Spellmount Press, 2000). The Royal Marine General Leslie Hollis who worked as the Senior Assistant Secretary to the War Cabinet recalled in an interview: &quot;For all Beaverbrook&#x27;s tremendous achievement in producing aeroplanes, there was little to praise in the way he rode roughshod over everyone. He never carried an oil can. He did as he liked, when he liked. He once promoted an Air Commodore to Air Vice-Marshal-over the heads of fifty more senior Air Commodores. This sort of behavior did not make for happiness, but it was the way he worked, and the end justified the means&quot;. Hollis stated that for Beaverbrook all that mattered was if someone was efficient or not, and he was very ruthless about sacking those he viewed as inefficient. However, it has been argued that aircraft production was already rising when Beaverbrook took charge and that he was fortunate to inherit a system which was just beginning to bear fruit. Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding, Head of Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain wrote that &quot;We had the organization, we had the men, we had the spirit which could bring us victory in the air but we had not the supply of machines necessary to withstand the drain of continuous battle. Lord Beaverbrook gave us those machines, and I do not believe that I exaggerate when I say that no other man in England could have done so.&quot; Hollis recalled in an interview: &quot;Beaverbrook&#x27;s ruthless, cut-throat, steam-roller approach to every problem made him feared as well as respected. You either got on with him or you did not; and in the latter case it was better and safer to give him a wide berth. Nevertheless, he was a staunch and faithful friend to me, and immensely kind.&quot; Beaverbrook increasingly came into conflict with Ernest Bevin over a number of issues such as whose ministry would be responsible for safety training in aircraft factories, and the two ministers spent much time feuding. Hollis recalled: &quot;Their hostility grew to such an extent that it embarrassed Mr. Churchill, and caused a great deal of unhappiness in the government. It seemed astonishing that, at such a time, two men of such stature and ability should be so eager to score points off each other. I was especially grieved at this because I admired both men very much&quot;. Hollis also recalled that Beaverbrook&#x27;s relations with Churchill would vary dramatically as he stated: &quot;Beaverbrook&#x27;s friendship with Churchill was of very long standing and to my mind, quite stormy. They would fight and argue every Monday and Tuesday; part on Wednesday and Thursday; and then make it up again on Friday and Saturday&quot;.

Beaverbrook resigned on 30 April 1941 and, after a month as Minister of State, Churchill appointed him to the post of Minister of Supply. Here Beaverbrook clashed with Ernest Bevin who, as Minister of Labour and National Service, refused to let Beaverbrook take over any of his responsibilities. On 10 May 1941, Rudolf Hess made his flight to Scotland to contact the Duke of Hamilton about opening talks for an Anglo-German peace. Instead he was taken into custody by local police constables. Beaverbrook was sent to interview Hess with orders to find out just what had motivated the deputy Führer to fly to Scotland. Hess spoke fluent English and it was in that language that the interview was conducted. Beaverbrook reported to Churchill that Hess was an exceedingly eccentric and strange man who believed that the war between Germany and Britain was a grave mistake. Beaverbrook further stated that the best he could discern for Hess&#x27;s motives was that he had told him that Germany was going to be invading the Soviet Union in the very near-future and now was the ideal time for the two &quot;Nordic&quot; nations to stop their pointless &quot;fratricidal&quot; war and join forces against the Soviet Union, whom Hess insisted was the common enemy of both nations.

Early on the morning of 22 June 1941, Hess&#x27;s predications about the coming invasion of the Soviet Union came true when Operation Barbarossa, the largest invasion in history was launched with 3 million German soldiers organized into three army groups invaded the Soviet Union. In September 1941, Beaverbrook headed the British delegation to Moscow with his American counterpart Averell Harriman (Moscow Conference (1941)). This made Beaverbrook the first senior British politician to meet Soviet leader Joseph Stalin since Adolf Hitler&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union. Harriman said of Beaverbrook&#x27;s role in the mission: &#x27;has been a great salesman...His genius never worked more effectively.&#x27; Beaverbrook met Stalin at the Kremlin and developed a liking for the Soviet leader, finding him to be a man like himself who regarded committees as time-wasting and preferred action over meetings.

Beaverbrook was one of the few close associates to Churchill to be present at his meetings with President Roosevelt on board HMS Prince of Wales and USS Augusta in the North Atlantic off the coast of Newfoundland over the period from 9 to 12 August 1941. Much impressed by Stalin and the sacrifice of the Soviet people, he returned to London determined to persuade Churchill to launch a second front in Europe to help draw German resources away from the Eastern Front to aid the Soviets. In a memo to Churchill on 19 October 1941, Beaverbrook wrote the involvement of the Soviet Union in the war offered a chance to win decisively far sooner than expected. In February 1942, Beaverbrook became Minister of War Production and again clashed with Bevin, this time over shipbuilding. In the face of Bevin&#x27;s refusal to work with him, Beaverbrook resigned after only twelve days in the post. In September 1943 he was appointed Lord Privy Seal, outside of the Cabinet, and held that post until the end of the war. After leaving the War Cabinet, Beaverbrook made himself the main spokesman for the &quot;Second Front Now&quot; campaign, calling for an Anglo-American invasion of France. This put him at odds with Churchill who favored the &quot;peripheral strategy&quot; of winning the war via strategical bombing of Germany; maintaining command of the sea; and the &quot;Mediterranean strategy&quot; of engaging the Wehrmacht in North Africa and Italy. Despite their disagreement over the second front, Beaverbrook remained a close confidant of Churchill throughout the war, and could regularly be found with Churchill until the early hours of the morning. Clement Attlee commented that &quot;Churchill often listened to Beaverbrook&#x27;s advice but was too sensible to take it.&quot;

In addition to his ministerial roles, Beaverbrook headed the Anglo-American Combined Raw Materials Board from 1942 to 1945 and accompanied Churchill to several wartime meetings with President Roosevelt. He was able to relate to Roosevelt in a different way than Churchill and became close to Roosevelt during these visits. This friendship sometimes irritated Churchill who felt that Beaverbrook was distracting Roosevelt from concentrating on the war effort. For his part Roosevelt seems to have enjoyed the distraction.

==Later life==
Beaverbrook devoted himself to Churchill&#x27;s 1945 general election campaign, but a &quot;Daily Express&quot; headline warning that a Labour victory would amount to the &#x27;Gestapo in Britain&#x27; (adapted from a passage in a radio election speech by Churchill on 4 June) was a huge mistake and completely misjudged the public mood. Beaverbrook renounced his British citizenship and left the Conservative Party in 1951, but remained an Empire loyalist throughout his life. In 1947, Beaverbrook was vehemently opposed to the plans to end the Raj with the colony of India to be granted independence and partitioned into the new nations of India and Pakistan. Through the decision to end the Raj was taken by the Labour prime minister, Clement Attlee, Beaverbrook directed his ire against the last Viceroy, Admiral Louis Mountbatten, who Beaverbrook believed could have somehow defied the government and not granted independence if he had wanted to. In a leader, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; wrote that &quot;in all the world we have few more dangerous enemies&quot; than Mountbatten and Jawaharlal Nehru. Beaverbrook never forgave Mountbatten and for the rest of his life used the &quot;Daily Express&quot; to blacken his reputation and always presented Mountbatten in the worst possible light.
Beaverbrook took a typically idiosyncratic line with regard to the Cold War, holding out hopes in the editorial line of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; until 1948 that the wartime &quot;Big Three&quot; alliance of the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Kingdom should continue after the war. It was only after the Berlin blockade began in 1948 that Beaverbrook had the &quot;Daily Express&quot; take an anti-Soviet line, but even then he continued to hold out hopes that the Cold War would not be permanent and it might be possible to revive the &quot;Big Three&quot; alliance. Beaverbrook had Wilfred Burchett, an Australian journalist of extreme left-wing views based in East Berlin to run a column in &quot;The Daily Express&quot; entitled &quot;The Russian Window&quot; starting in October 1948. The nature of Burchett&#x27;s &quot;Russian Window&quot; reports about life behind the Iron Curtain such as his claims that there was a surplus of luxury goods on sale in shops in Moscow led to accusations that he was engaged in propaganda for the Soviet Union, a nation that Burchett clearly admired. When Beaverbrook asked the editor of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, Arthur Christiansen about Burchett after reading several of his &quot;Russian Window&quot; columns, he was told: &quot;He is, I think, a fellow traveler, but nevertheless an able chap&quot;. Even after the &quot;Russian Window&quot; column was terminated, Burchett continued to work as a free-lancer for &quot;The Daily Express&quot; based in Budapest, where he denied in one article that Cardinal József Mindszenty had confessed at his show trial under the influence of &quot;truth drugs&quot;. In 1950, Christiansen turned down a chance to publish photographs of South Korean policemen engaged in a mass execution of suspected Communists because to do so would have &quot;given our enemies a chance to say we are playing the Communist game and did the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; propaganda for them&quot;. The photographs were later published in &quot;The Daily Worker&quot; which presented the executions as typical of justice in South Korea, and led to Beaverbrook to complain that it was a shame that &quot;The Daily Express&quot; did not have those &quot;real fine pictures&quot;.

Beaverbrook used his newspapers to campaign against Mountbatten being appointed First Sea Lord under the grounds that he &quot;gave away&quot; India in 1947. When Mountbatten was appointed First Sea Lord, the Beaverbrook newspapers went out of their way to portray the Royal Navy under Mountbatten&#x27;s leadership in a negative light. As part of his campaign against Mountbatten, Beaverbrook used his newspapers to make allegations to the effect that Mountbatten had deliberately launched the Dieppe raid of 19 August 1942 - in which the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division had taken heavy losses – in the full knowledge that it would fail to prevent a second front from being opened in 1942. Beaverbrook angrily told Mountbatten at a dinner party hosted by Harriman in London: &quot;You murdered my Canadians to wreck my Second Front campaign!&quot; Tom Driberg, the Labour MP who also worked as the gossip columnist for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; detailed these allegations in a manuscript of a biography of Beaverbrook he wrote in the mid-1950s, but the threats of a libel suit from Mountbatten led the allegations being removed from the published book. The British historian Adrien Smith argued that the real reason for Beaverbrook&#x27;s feud with Mountbatten was because one of his various mistresses, Jean Norton, had shared her affections with Mountbatten. Beaverbrook was frequently unfaithful towards his wife, but he was possessive of his mistresses.

In 1956, Beaverbrook used the &quot;Daily Express&quot; to clamor for war against Egypt after President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the partly British-owned &quot;Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez&quot;, an act that Beaverbrook considered to be intolerable. When the invasion of Egypt began in October 1956, Beaverbrook had the &quot;Daily Express&quot; support the war as a justified assertion of British national interests. Beaverbrook regarded the end of the Suez crisis with Britain being forced to withdraw under strong American-Soviet pressure to be a national humiliation, and much of the anti-Americanism he was to express in his last years related to bitterness over the Suez crisis. Beaverbrook likewise favored a hawkish line on the Cyprus Emergency as he used his newspapers to support keeping Cyprus a British colony and regarded the decision to grant Cyprus independence in 1960 again as a national humiliation.

Aitken continued to live lavishly. Ascherson noted: &quot;His life became a progress like a medieval king&#x27;s, cruising on Atlantic liners and luxurious yachts with a great retinue of servants, cronies, henchmen, useful politicians and pretty women. But the Beaver did not forget old comrades. The ageing Churchill was free to stay and paint in the sun at La Capponcina whenever he pleased, and their friendship grew closer until Beaverbrook&#x27;s death in 1964. He used his money and connections quietly to rescue many other lesser figures in trouble. A.J.P. Taylor justly called him &quot;a foul-weather friend&quot;.

He opposed both Britain&#x27;s acceptance of post-war loans from America and Britain&#x27;s application to join the European Economic Community in 1961. In 1953 he became chancellor-for-life of the University of New Brunswick through an Act of the local legislature. In 1960, the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan decided to have the United Kingdom join the European Economic Community (EEC) as the European Union was then called, but he waited until July 1961 to formally make the application at least in part out of the fear over the reaction of the Beaverbrook newspapers. Beaverbrook was strongly opposed to the application and used his newspapers to offer ferocious criticism of Macmillan&#x27;s application to join the EEC, accusing him of a betrayal of the Commonwealth whom Beaverbrook continued to insist were Britain&#x27;s natural allies. In 1960, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; was selling 4,300,000 copies per day, making it into Britain&#x27;s most popular newspaper.

He became the university&#x27;s greatest benefactor, fulfilling the same role for the city of Fredericton and the province as a whole. He would provide additional buildings for the university, scholarship funds, the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, the Beaverbrook Skating Rink, the Lord Beaverbrook Hotel, with profits donated to charity, the Playhouse, Louise Manny&#x27;s early folklore work, and numerous other projects. He bought the archive papers of both Bonar Law and David Lloyd George and placed them in the Beaverbrook Library within the Daily Express Building. Beaverbrook was always proud of his New Brunswick roots, and liked to claim in his last years that four of the most outstanding men of his generation were from New Brunswick, by which he meant Bonar Law, R.B. Bennett, Sir James Hamet Dunn and himself.

==Personal life==

On 29 January 1906, in Halifax, Aitken married Gladys Henderson Drury, daughter of Major-General Charles William Drury CB (a first cousin of Admiral Sir Charles Carter Drury) and Mary Louise Drury (née Henderson). They had three children before her death on 1 December 1927. Their son Max Aitken Jr. became a fighter pilot with 601 Squadron, rising to Wing Commander with 16 victories in World War II. Their daughter Janet Gladys Aitken was married to Ian Campbell, who later became the 11th Duke of Argyll. Together they had one daughter, Lady Jeanne Campbell.

Beaverbrook remained a widower for many years until 1963 when he married Marcia Anastasia Christoforides (1910–1994), the widow of his friend Sir James Dunn. Beaverbrook was rarely a faithful husband, and even in old age was often accused of treating women with disrespect. In Britain he established the then-married Jean Norton as his mistress at Cherkley. Aitken left Norton for a Jewish ballet dancer named Lily Ernst whom he had rescued from pre-war Austria.

==Historian==
After the First World War, Beaverbrook had written &quot;Politicians and the Press&quot; in 1925, and &quot;Politicians and the War&quot; in two volumes, the first in 1928 and the second in 1932, republished in one volume in 1960. Upon their original publication, the books were largely ignored by professional historians and the only favourable reviews were in Beaverbrook&#x27;s own newspapers. However, when the combined edition of &quot;Politicians and the War&quot; came out, the reviews were more positive. A. J. P. Taylor said it was &quot;Tacitus and Aubrey rolled into one&quot;.

Later Taylor said: &quot;The enduring merits of the book are really beyond cavil. It provides essential testimony for events during a great political crisis...It contains character sketches worthy of Aubrey. On a wider canvas, it displays the behaviour of political leaders in wartime. The narrative is carried along by rare zest and wit, yet with the detached impartiality of the true scholar&quot;. Sir John Elliot in 1981 said the work &quot;will remain, despite all carping, the authoritative narrative; nor does the story want in the telling thereof&quot;.

&quot;Men and Power 1917–1918&quot; was published in 1956. It is not a coherent narrative, but is divided by separate episodes centred on one man, such as Carson, Robertson, Rothermere and others. The reviews were favourable, with Taylor&#x27;s review in &quot;The Observer&quot; greatly pleasing Beaverbrook. The book sold over 23,000 copies.

When &quot;The Decline and Fall of Lloyd George&quot; was published in 1963, favourable reviewers included Clement Attlee, Roy Jenkins, Robert Blake, Lord Longford, Sir C. P. Snow, Lady Violet Bonham Carter, Richard Crossman and Denis Brogan. Kenneth Young said the book was &quot;the finest of all his writing&quot;.

Beaverbrook was both admired and despised in Britain, sometimes at the same time: in his 1956 autobiography, David Low quotes H.G. Wells as saying of Beaverbrook: &quot;If ever Max ever gets to Heaven, he won&#x27;t last long. He will be chucked out for trying to pull off a merger between Heaven and Hell after having secured a controlling interest in key subsidiary companies in both places, of course.&quot;

Beaverbrook was of an imperialist mindset, with the quote, &quot;There are countries so underdeveloped today that the gift of independence is like the gift of a razor to a child&quot; attributed to him in a panel discussion on Canadian TV.

==Death==
Lord Beaverbrook died in Leatherhead in 1964, aged 85. He had recently attended a birthday banquet organized by fellow Canadian press baron, Lord Thomson of Fleet, where he was determined to be seen on his usual good form, despite suffering from cancer.

A bust of him by Oscar Nemon stands in the park in the town square of Newcastle, New Brunswick, not far from where he sold newspapers as a young boy. His ashes are in the plinth of the bust.

The Beaverbrook Foundation continues his philanthropic interests. In 1957, a bronze statue of Lord Beaverbrook was erected at the centre of Officers&#x27; Square in Fredericton, New Brunswick, paid for by money raised by children throughout the province.

==Legacy==
Beaverbrook and his wife Lady Beaverbrook left a considerable legacy to both New Brunswick and the United Kingdom. In 2014, he was named a National Historic Person on the advice of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. He is particularly cherished at the University of New Brunswick, to which he devoted most of his later largesse and at which he situated his extensive archival collection of British public life in the first half of the 20th century. Among other gifts over three years from 1946 he tripled the size of the library at UNB, and bestowed the Old Manse Library in Newcastle Miramichi. He endowed the Lord Beaverbrook Overseas Scholarships to send UNB undergraduates for a spell at the University of London. His legacy, and memorials, includes the following buildings:

==In popular culture==

For a period of time Beaverbrook employed novelist Evelyn Waugh in London and abroad. Waugh later lampooned his employer by portraying him as Lord Copper in &quot;Scoop&quot; and as Lord Monomark in both &quot;Put Out More Flags&quot; and &quot;Vile Bodies&quot;.

The Kinks recorded &quot;Mr Churchill Says&quot; for their 1969 album &quot;Arthur&quot;, which contains the lines: &quot;Mr Beaverbrook says: &#x27;We&#x27;ve gotta save our tin/And all the garden gates and empty cans are gonna make us win...&#x27;.&quot;

Beaverbrook was one of eight notable Britons cited in Bjørge Lillelien&#x27;s famous &quot;Your boys took a hell of a beating&quot; commentary at the end of an English football team defeat to Norway in 1981, mentioned alongside British Prime Ministers Churchill, Thatcher and Attlee.

<doc id="72232" wikidata="Q110453750" url="?curid=72232" title="Earth shelter">
<text>An earth shelter, also called an earth house, earth-bermed house, earth-sheltered house, earth-covered house, or underground house, is a structure (usually a house) with earth (soil) against the walls and/or on the roof, or that is entirely buried underground. 

Earth acts as thermal mass, making it easier to maintain a steady indoor air temperature and therefore reduces energy costs for heating or cooling.
Earth sheltering became relatively popular after the mid-1970s, especially among environmentalists. However, the practice has been around for nearly as long as humans have been constructing their own shelters.
==Definition==
* &quot;Earth-sheltering is [...] a generic term with the general meaning: building design in which soil plays an integral part.&quot; This definition is problematic however, since earth structures (e.g. rammed earth or cob) are not usually considered as earth shelters as they are above ground.
* &quot;A building can be described as earth-sheltered when it has a thermally significant amount of soil or substrate in contact with its external envelope, where “thermally significant” means making a functional contribution to the thermal effectiveness of the building in question.
* &quot;Structures built with the use of earth mass against building walls as external thermal mass, which reduces heat loss and maintains a steady indoor air temperature throughout the seasons.&quot;
* &quot;A residence with an earth covering for its roof or walls.&quot;
* &quot;Homes that have been built underground, either partially or completely.&quot;
* &quot;The use of earth cover to moderate and improve living conditions in buildings.&quot;

==History==

===Early history===

Earth sheltering is one of the oldest forms of building. It is thought that from about 15,000 BC migratory hunters in Europe were using turf and earth to insulate simple round huts that were also sunk into the ground. The use of some form of earth sheltered construction is found across many cultures in history, distributed widely across the world. Normally these examples of cultures using earth sheltered buildings occur without any knowledge of the construction method elsewhere. These structures have many different forms and are referred to by many different names. General terms include pit-house and dugout.

One of the oldest examples of berming, dating back some 5,000 years, can be found at Skara Brae in the Orkney Islands off northern Scotland. Another historical example of in-hill earth shelters would be Mesa Verde, in southwest USA. These building are constructed directly onto the ledges and caves on the face of the cliffs. The front wall is built up with local stone and earth to enclose the structure.

In North America, almost every native American group used earth sheltered structures to some extent. These structures have been called &#x27;earth lodges&#x27; (see also: Barabara). When Europeans colonized North America, sod houses (&quot;soddies&quot;) were common on the Great Plains.

In China, man-made cave dwellings have been used as a shelter since 2,000 BC. In certain areas of northern China, like the provinces of Shaanxi and Shanxi, since the loess earth is structurally uniform and compacted, providing easy access to good quality building material with stable structure, earth-sheltered homes have been in use for centuries.

===1970s–1980s heyday===
The 1973 Oil Crisis saw the price of oil dramatically increase, which influenced vast social, economic and political changes worldwide. Combined with growing interest in alternative lifestyles and the back-to-the-land movement, the public of the US and elsewhere were becoming more interested in saving energy and protecting the environment.

As early as the 1960s in the US, some innovators were designing contemporary earth shelters. After the oil crisis and until the early 1980s there was a new resurgence in interest earth shelter/underground home construction, which has been termed the first wave of earth-covered dwellings. Architect Arthur Quarmby finished an earth sheltered building in Holme, England in 1975. Named &quot;Underhill,&quot; It is recorded in the Guinness World Records as the &quot;first underground house&quot; in the UK.

The majority of publications about earth sheltering date to this period, with dozens of books dedicated to the topic being published in the years leading up to 1983. The first International Conference on Earth-Sheltered Buildings was hosted in Sydney, Australia in 1983. A second conference was planned for 1986 in Minneapolis, USA.

Other notable proponents of earth sheltering active in this era include Mike Oehler, Rob Roy, John Hait, Malcolm Wells, Peter Vetsch, Ken Kern and others.

===Modern times===

Since the late 1980s, earth-sheltered homes have become increasingly popular. The technique is more common in Russia, China and Japan. It is possible that Northern China has more earth shelters than any other region. As of 1987, approximately 10 million people live in underground homes in the region.
Some claim that thousands of people live underground in Europe and America. Notable European examples are the &quot;Earth Houses&quot; of Swiss architect Peter Vetsch. There are about 50 such earth shelters in Switzerland, including a residential estate of nine earth shelters (Lättenstrasse in Dietikon). In other parts of Europe, such as the UK, earth sheltering is more uncommon. Possibly the most well known examples of modern earth sheltering in the English-speaking world are Earthships, the brand of passive solar earth shelters sold by Earthship Biotecture. Earthships are concentrated in New Mexico, US.
Overall earth shelter construction is often viewed by architects, engineers, and the public as an unconventional method of building. Techniques of earth sheltering have not become common knowledge, and much of society is unaware of this type of building construction. Generally speaking, the cost of excavation, increased need for damp-proofing and the requirement for the structure to withstand greater weight relative to above grade houses means that earth sheltering remains relatively rare. In this respect, the Passive House (PassivHaus) energy performance standard applied to above grade airtight, superinsulated low carbon or zero carbon buildings has had much wider uptake in modern times. Over 20,000 buildings certified to PassivHaus standards have been constructed across Northern Europe. Some postulate that over time the reducing availability of building space, and the increasing need and interest for environmentally friendly housing will make earth shelters more common.

There are an estimated 30-40 million Chinese living in such earth homes today still, mostly along the Yellow River in Northern China. There are mainly two kinds of earth homes in the area. The first type is pit cave dwellings. Usually, people dig a sunken courtyard, which is a rectangular underground pit about 10 meters deep, then arrange rooms dug off the main courtyard. The second type is dwelling space carved out of earth cliffs which are often south-facing, and the facades are sometimes faced with bricks or stone. They usually come with larger courtyards since it doesn&#x27;t bother to excavate.

==Types==
Three main types of earth shelter are described. There is also great variation in the approach to earth sheltering in terms of materials used and expenditure. The &quot;low tech&quot; approach might involve natural building techniques, wooden posts and shed style roofs, recycling of materials, owner labor, hand excavation, etc. The relatively more high tech approach would be larger, using concrete and steel. While typically more energy efficient post construction, the high tech approach has higher embodied energy and significantly more costs.

===Bermed===
In the earth bermed (also termed &quot;bunded&quot;) type, earth is banked against the exterior walls, sloping down away from the building. The berm can be partial or total. The polar facing wall may be bermed, leaving the equator-facing wall un-bermed (in temperate regions). Usually this type of earth shelter is built on, or only slightly below the original grade. Due to the building being above the original ground level, fewer moisture problems are associated with earth berming in comparison to underground/fully-recessed construction, and it costs less to construct. According to one report, earth berming provided 90-95% of the energy advantage as a completely below grade structure.

===In-hill===
The in-hill (also termed &quot;earth covered&quot;, or &quot;elevational&quot;) construction is where the earth shelter is set into a slope or hillside, and earth covers the roof in addition to the walls. The most practical application is using a hill facing towards the equator (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere), towards the aphelion (north) in the Tropics, or east just outside the Tropics. There is only one exposed wall in this type of earth sheltering, the wall facing out of the hill, all other walls are embedded within the earth/hill. This is the most popular and energy efficient form of earth shelter in cold and temperate climates.

===Underground===

The true underground (also termed &quot;chambered&quot; or &quot;subterranean&quot;) earth shelter describes a house where the ground is excavated, and the house is set in below grade. They can feature an atrium or courtyard constructed in the middle of the shelter to provide adequate light and ventilation. The atrium is not always fully enclosed by raised ground, sometimes a U-shaped atrium is used, which is open on one side.

With an atrium earth shelter, the living spaces tend to be located around the atrium. The atrium arrangement provides a much less compact plan than that of the one or two-story bermed/in hill design; therefore it is commonly less energy efficient, in terms of heating needs. Therefore, atrium designs are found mainly in warmer climates. However, the atrium does tend to trap air within it which is then heated by the sun and helps reduce heat loss. Atrium designs are well suited to flat sites, and are fairly common.

===Other types===
Depending on what definition of earth sheltering is used, other types are sometimes included. In culvert homes (&quot;Cut and Cover&quot;), precast concrete containers and large diameter pipes are arranged into a connecting design to form a living space and then backfilled with earth. An experimental construction design from the 1980s of Japan, coined &#x27;Alice City&#x27;, proposed to use a wide and deep cylindrical shaft sunk into the earth, with a domed skylight roof. Artificial caves can be constructed by making a tunnel into the earth. Building greenhouses underground has also been speculated about. Schools, commercial centres, government buildings and other buildings could be built underground.

==Applications==
===Active and passive solar===
Earth sheltering is often combined with solar heating systems. Most commonly, the utilization of passive solar design techniques is used in earth shelters. In most of the Northern Hemisphere, a south-facing structure with the north, east, and west sides covered with earth is the most effective application for passive solar systems. A large double glazed window, triple glazed, spanning most of the length of the south wall is critical for solar heat gain. It is helpful to accompany the window with insulated drapes to protect against heat loss at night. Also, during the summer months, providing an overhang, or some sort of shading device, is used to block out an excess solar gain.

===Passive annual heat storage===
Passive annual heat storage is a building concept theorized to create a year-round constant temperature in an earth shelter by means of direct gain passive solar heating and a thermal battery effect lasting several months. It is claimed that an earth shelter designed according to these principles would store the sun&#x27;s heat in the summer and release it slowly over the winter months without need for other forms of heating. This method was first described by inventor and physicist John Hait in his 1983 book. The main component of it is an insulated and waterproof &quot;umbrella&quot; which extends out from the earth shelter for several meters in all directions. Hence the term &quot;umbrella house&quot;. The earth under this umbrella is kept warm and dry relative to surrounding earth, which is subject to constant daily and seasonal temperature changes. This creates a large heat storage area of earth, effectively a huge thermal mass. Heat is gained via passive solar in the earth shelter and transferred to the surrounding earth by conduction. Thus, when the temperature in the earth shelter dips below the temperature in the surrounding earth, heat will return to the earth shelter. After a time, a stable temperature is reached which is an average of annual heat changes in the external environment. Some criticize the technique (along with the earth sheltering technique as a whole), stating concerns including difficulty and expense of construction, moisture and lack of evidence.

===Annualized geo solar===
Another design aimed at passive seasonal energy storage, annualized geo solar is sometimes applied to earth shelters.

===Earth tube ventilation===
Passive cooling which pulls air with a fan or convection from a nearly constant temperature air into buried Earth cooling tubes and then into the house living space. This also provides fresh air to occupants and the air exchange required by ASHRAE.

==Comparison with standard housing==
===Advantages===
In 1981, Oehler promoted his low-budget building design (a simple hole in the ground with walls of wooden planks backed by plastic sheeting) by claiming it needed no foundation, used less building material and labour, had less maintenance, was aesthetically pleasing, had a lower taxation rate in the US at the time, cost less to regulate temperature, was less affected by stormy weather, had pipes which wouldn&#x27;t freeze where they entered the house, were &quot;ecologically sound&quot;, relatively fireproof, soundproof and had an increased garden space as compared to regular house on a similarly sized plot of land.

He also claimed the view from a window below the ground was better than that from other windows, and that the flooring he used in his an underground home (plastic sheeting over bare dirt) was &quot;superior&quot; to what is elsewhere available.

He claimed he would provide a built-in greenhouse in the design.

He claimed his homes could be used as fallout shelters in case of nuclear wars and also claimed that, in the case of complete societal collapse, his design would be more defensible than a regular house in the case of random attacks, as well as being better concealed from potential hostiles (without a map and unfamiliar with the area). He believed that underground, inhabitants would be better protected from &quot;atmospheric radiation&quot; (fallout). Because his design was not waterproofed, one would be &quot;closer to a source of water&quot;, and could potentially simply dig a well in the middle of the room.

He furthermore claimed anyone could build one of his designs irrespective of skill or ability for only $50.

====Passive heating and cooling====

Due to its density, compacted earth acts as thermal mass, meaning that it stores heat and releases it again slowly. Compacted soil is more of a conductor of heat than an insulator. Soil is stated as having an R-value of about 0.65-R per centimeter (0.08-R per 1 inch), or 0.25-R per 1 inch. Variations in R-value of soil may be attributed to different soil moisture levels, with lower R values as moisture level increases. The most superficial layer of earth typically is less dense and contains the root systems of many different plants, thereby acting more like thermal insulation, meaning, it reduces the rate of temperature flowing through it.

Approximately 50% of the heat from the Sun is absorbed at the surface. Consequently, the temperature at the surface may vary considerably according to the day / night cycle, according to weather and particularly according to season. Underground, these temperature changes are blunted and delayed, termed thermal lag. The thermal properties of earth therefore mean that in winter the temperature below the surface will be higher than the surface air temperature, and conversely in summer the earth temperature will be lower than the surface air temperature.

Indeed, at a deep enough point underground, the temperature remains constant year round, and this temperature is approximately the mean of summer and winter temperatures. Sources vary in their stated values for this deep earth constant temperature (also termed amplitude correction factor). Reported values include , , , for dry soil, and for wet soil. Below this level the temperature increases on average every due to heat rising from the interior of the Earth.

Diurnal temperature changes between maximum and minimum temperatures can be modelled as a wave, as can seasonal temperature changes (see diagram). In architecture, the relationship between the maximum fluctuations of external temperature compared to internal temperature is termed amplitude dampening (or temperature amplitude factor). Phase shifting is the time taken for the minimum external temperature to reach the interior.

Partially covering a building with earth adds to the thermal mass of the structure. Combined with insulation, this results in both amplitude dampening and phase shifting. In other terms, earth sheltered structures receive both a degree of cooling in summer and heating in winter. This reduces need for other measures of heating and cooling, saving energy. A potential disadvantage of a thermally massive building in cooler climates is that after a prolonged period of cold, when the external temperature increases again, the structures internal temperature tends to lag behind and take longer to warm up (assuming no other form of heating).

The reduction of air infiltration within an earth shelter can be advantageous. Because three walls of the structure are mainly surrounded by earth, very little surface area is exposed to the outside air. This alleviates the problem of warm air escaping the house through gaps around windows and door. Furthermore, the earth walls protect against cold winter winds which might otherwise penetrate these gaps. However, this can also become a potential indoor air quality problem. Healthy air circulation is key.

As a result of the increased thermal mass of the structure, the thermal lag of the earth, the protection against unwanted air infiltration and the combined use of passive solar techniques, the need for extra heating and cooling is minimal. Therefore, there is a drastic reduction in energy consumption required for the home compared to homes of typical construction.

====Wind protection====
The unique architecture of earth houses protects them against severe windstorms. They cannot be torn away or tipped over by strong winds. Structural engineering and, above all, the lack of corners and exposed parts (roof), eliminate vulnerable surfaces which would otherwise suffer from storm damage.

====Natural resource saving====
Compared with the material needs of standard buildings, earth-sheltered homes can greatly reduce the number of natural resources. Traditional wood structure home requires lumber for framing and interior finishes, which is quite a big demand. Soil as the main building material and blending in with the landscape, earth-sheltered houses drastically reduce the demand for lumber.

====Biological effects====
Earth homes organically embrace animals and poultry as well as water, soil, and plants. Arcology studies the relationship between animals and plants and man-made buildings during ecological development. For example, raising poultry and domesticated animals is an important part of the traditional Chinese rural human settlements and these elements create a stable and sustainable ecological cycle that benefits the environment.

====Landscape protection and land use====
Compared to conventional buildings, earth houses can fit into their surroundings. The soil-covered roofs hide the building within the landscape.

Some claim that the construction method is advantageous to the nitrogen-fixation of the soil on the roof, because it would otherwise be covered by the foundation of a traditional house. Contrary to conventional roofs, earth-house roofs allow plants to grow semi-naturally on them.

Such houses can also be built as terraced structures on a slope in hilly terrain.

====Fire protection====
Compared to other building materials, such as wood, earth houses feature efficient fire protection owing both to the use of concrete and the insulation provided by the roof. Taking the example of Earthships, there is a reported case where the structure survived fire better compared to other types of buildings.

====Earthquake protection====
While residents of earth sheltered homes report noticing more minor earthquakes, the homes are resilient against large earthquakes, as their subterranean nature allows them to move with the earth. Picture a small twig house sitting on top of a tub of dirt: Shake the dirt, and the house will dance and stress. But if you bury the house in the dirt, you can shake the tub without stressing the house as much.

====Roof planting====
Roof covering is done using the excavated material, in which plants can be planted.

====Nuclear bomb survivability====
Due to the mass of the earth between the living area of an earth house and the surface grade, an earth home offers significant protection from impact/blast damage, or fallout associated with a nuclear bomb.

====Soundproof====
Earth shelters may provide privacy from neighbors, as well as soundproofing. The ground provides acoustic protection against outside noise. This can be a major benefit in urban areas or near highways.

====Architectural aesthetics====
Earth sheltered dwelling express itself with the color harmony of soil and earth. Meanwhile, the material properties of soil and earth give earth homes the simplicity of geomatic masses. Also, earth homes blend in perfectly with the landscape and highlight the beauty of the surroundings, which is a significant basis of the arcology concept. For example, yaodong and pit cave dwellings in Northern China hide themselves underground and blend in perfectly within the Loess plateau environment. Salt Cathedral in a halite mountain near the city of Zipaquirá, Colombia hugs the contour and highlights the natural features.

===Disadvantages===
====Financial cost====
Three main factors influence overall cost of home construction, namely, design complexity, materials used, and whether the owner(s) carries out some or all of the construction or pays others to do it. Custom houses with complex designs tend to be more expensive and take longer to build than stock houses. Houses which use expensive materials will be more expensive than houses which use low cost materials. Owner labor can dramatically cut construction costs.

Both earth sheltered projects and construction of regular houses have significant variability in the design, materials and labor involved. As such it is difficult to make a precise comparison of cost between the two, however in general an earth shelter is much more expensive.

A small &quot;underground home&quot; built in the style of Oehler, as only a simple, non-waterproofed hole in ground with simple planks and a plastic sheet to a wall, despite using free labour (ignoring the opportunity costs of not having time to go to work) and recycled materials, e.g. windows and planks for the wall, is estimated to be 30% cheaper to construct when compared to paying a contractor to build a regular house using new construction materials at standard prices, although Oehler&#x27;s design will quickly rot and collapse after a few years.

A particular factor that strongly influences the cost of an earth shelter is the amount of earth that covers it. The more earth covering the structure, the greater the expense is needed in having a structure capable of withstanding the load (see also: Roof). Another important cost factor that tends to be unique to earth shelters is site excavation and backfilling. The amount of waterproofing is also more costly. On the other hand, earth shelters should have lower maintenance costs since they are mostly covered with little exposed exterior.

Many financial institutions outright exclude financing on earth-sheltered homes, or require this type of property to be common for the area.

====Design complexity====
Overall it is more technically challenging to design an earth shelter compared to a regular home. Because of the unorthodox design and construction of earth-sheltered homes, local building codes and ordinances may need to be researched and/or navigated. Many construction companies have limited or no experience with earth-sheltered construction, potentially compromising the physical construction of even the best designs. The specific architecture of earth houses usually leads to non-righted, round-shaped walls, which can cause problems concerning the interior decoration, especially regarding furniture and large paintings.

Repairs to the walls are very difficult to service; and may require re-evaluating and rebuilding the house from scratch.

An earth shelter cannot be enlarged with an extra room - this will require breaking the waterproofing sealant cladding the concrete walls of the building.

====Sustainability====
In &quot;green building&quot;, four &quot;lifetime&quot; phases of a building are described, namely material sources, construction, in use, and deconstruction (life-cycle assessment). Terms carbon zero and negative carbon buildings refer to the net greenhouse gas emissions over these four phases. Questions therefore arise as to whether certain structures are truly environmentally friendly. For example, raw materials must be extracted from the earth, transported and then manufactured into building materials and transported again to be sold and finally transported to the build site. A lot of fossil fuels may be used during each of these stages.

Earth sheltering often requires heavier construction materials to resist the weight of the earth against the walls and/or roof. Reinforced concrete in particular needs to be used in much larger quantities per building. The manufacture of concrete is a major source of greenhouse gases.

The materials involved tend to be non-biodegradable substances. Because the materials must keep water out, they are often made of plastics. The excavation of a site is also drastically time- and labor-consuming. Overall, the construction is comparable to conventional construction, because the building requires minimal finishing and significantly less maintenance.

====Moisture and indoor air quality====
Problems of water seepage, internal condensation, bad acoustics, and poor indoor air quality can occur if an earth shelter has not been properly designed and ventilated. Very high humidity levels can allow mold or mildew growth, associated with a musty smell and potentially with health problems. The below-ground orientation of many earth-sheltered homes can allow accumulation of radon gas (which is known to increase the risk of lung cancer) or other undesirable materials (e.g. off gassing from construction materials).

The threat of water seepage occurs around areas where the waterproofing layers have been penetrated. Earth usually settles gradually. Vents and ducts emerging from the roof can cause specific problems due to the possibility of movement. Precast concrete slabs can have a deflection of 1/2 inch or more when the earth/soil is layered on top of them. If the vents or ducts are held rigidly in place during this deflection, the result is usually the failure of the waterproofing layer. To avoid this difficulty, vents can be placed on other sides of the building (besides the roof), or separate segments of pipes can be installed. A narrower pipe in the roof that fits snugly into a larger segment of the building can also be used. The threat of water seepage, condensation, and poor indoor air quality can all be overcome with proper waterproofing and ventilation.

====Limited natural light====
Despite large windows (usually facing south in the Northern Hemisphere), many earth-sheltered homes have dark areas in the areas opposite the windows. All natural light coming from one side of the home can give a &quot;tunnel or cave effect&quot;.

====Risk of collapse====
Reports of collapse seem to be rare. In one case, an author and proponent of earth sheltering died when an earth roof he designed collapsed on him.

====Limited escape routes====
Compared to above ground house, earth-shelters may have limited escape routes in case of emergency, which can fail egress and fenestration building codes.

====Legal issues====
An earth shelter may not be able to be adapted to existing local building codes, and may not legally be lived in.

==Design and construction==
===Design===
Earth sheltered homes are often constructed with energy conservation and savings in mind. Specific designs of earth shelters allow for maximum savings. For bermed or in-hill construction, a common plan is to place all the living spaces on the side of the house facing the equator (or north or east, depending on latitude). This provides maximum solar radiation to bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchen spaces. Rooms that do not require natural daylight and extensive heating such as the bathroom, storage, and utility room are typically located on the opposite (or in-hill) side of the shelter. This type of layout can also be transposed to a double level house design with both levels completely underground. This plan has the highest energy efficiency of earth sheltered homes because of the compact configuration as well as the structure being submerged deeper in the earth. This gives it a greater ratio of earth cover to an exposed wall than a one-story shelter would.

The soil type is one of the essential factors during site planning. The soil needs to provide adequate bearing capacity and drainage, and help to retain heat. With respects to drainage, the most suitable type of soil for earth sheltering is a mixture of sand and gravel. Well graded gravels have a large bearing capacity (about 8,000 pounds per square foot), excellent drainage and a low frost heave potential. Sand and clay can be susceptible to erosion. Clay soils, while least susceptible to erosion, often do not allow for proper drainage, and have a higher potential for frost heaves. Clay soils are more susceptible to thermal shrinking and expanding. Being aware of the moisture content of the soil and the fluctuation of that content throughout the year will help prevent potential heating problems. Frost heaves can also be problematic in some soil. Fine grain soils retain moisture the best and are most susceptible to heaving. A few ways to protect against capillary action responsible for frost heaves are placing foundations below the freezing zone or insulating ground surface around shallow footings, replacement of frost-sensitive soils with granular material, and interrupting capillary draw of moisture by putting a drainage layer of coarser material in the existing soil.

Water can damage earthen shelters if it ponds around them. Avoiding sites with a high water table is crucial. Drainage, both surface and subsurface, must be properly dealt with. Waterproofing applied to the building is essential.

Atrium designs have an increased risk of flooding, so the surrounding land should slope away from the structure on all sides. A drain pipe at the perimeter of the roof edge can help collect and remove additional water. For bermed homes, an interceptor drain at the crest of the berm along the rooftop&#x27;s edge is recommended. An interceptor drainage swale in the middle of the berm is also helpful or the back of the berm can be terraced with retaining walls. On sloping sites, runoff may cause problems. A drainage swale or gully can be built to divert water around the house, or a gravel-filled trench with a drain tile can be installed along with footing drains.

Soil stability should also be considered, especially when evaluating a sloping site. These slopes may be inherently stable when left alone, but cutting into them can greatly compromise their structural stability. Retaining walls and backfills may have to be constructed to hold up the slope prior to shelter construction.

On land that is relatively flat, a fully recessed house with an open courtyard is the most appropriate design. On a sloping site, the house is set right into the hill. The slope will determine the location of the window wall; the most practical orientation in moderate to cold climates is a south-facing exposed wall in the Northern hemisphere (and north-facing in the Southern hemisphere) due to solar benefits. The most practical orientation in the Tropics nearest the equator is north-facing toward the aphelion (or perhaps northeast) to moderate the temperature extremes. Just &quot;outside&quot; the Tropics, the most practical way to avoid afternoon heat excess may be an east-facing house or, if near a west coast, exposure of the east end and the west end, with the two &quot;long&quot; sides embedded in the earth.

Depending on the region and site selected for earth-sheltered construction, the benefits and objectives of the earth shelter construction vary. For cool and temperate climates, objectives consist of retaining winter heat, avoiding infiltration, receiving winter sun, using thermal mass, shading and ventilating during the summer, and avoiding winter winds and cold pockets. For hot, arid climates objectives include maximizing humidity, providing summer shade, maximizing summer air movement, and retaining winter heat. For hot, humid climates objectives include avoiding summer humidity, providing summer ventilation, and retaining winter heat.

Regions with extreme daily and seasonal temperatures emphasize the value of earth as a thermal mass. Earth sheltering is most effective in regions with high cooling and heating needs and high-temperature differentials. In regions such as the southeastern United States, earth sheltering may need additional care in maintenance and construction due to condensation problems in regard to the high humidity. The ground temperature of the region may be too high to permit earth cooling if temperatures fluctuate only slightly from day to night. Preferably, there should be adequate winter solar radiation and sufficient means for natural ventilation. Wind is a critical aspect to evaluate during site planning, for reasons regarding wind chill and heat loss, as well as shelter ventilation. In the Northern Hemisphere, south facing slopes tend to avoid cold winter winds typically blown in from the north. Fully recessed shelters also offer adequate protection against these harsh winds. However, atria within the structure can cause minor turbulence depending on the size. It is helpful to take advantage of the prevailing winds in the summer. Because of the limited window arrangement in most earth shelters, and the resistance to air infiltration, the air within a structure can become stagnant if proper ventilation is not provided. By making use of the wind, natural ventilation can occur without the use of fans or other active systems. Knowing the direction, and intensity, of seasonal winds, is vital in promoting cross ventilation. Vents are commonly placed in the roof of bermed or fully recessed shelters to achieve this effect.

===Building materials===
The selection of construction materials should consider the type of structure, site characteristics, climate, soil type, and design. Stronger, longer-lasting building materials are required for structures that are buried deeply. Waterproof and insulated materials should also be utilized to withstand the pressure and moisture of the surrounding ground. For instance, concrete and reinforced masonry, wood, and steel are all viable materials. Concrete is the most common choice for earth-sheltered buildings due to its strength, durability, and fire resistance. Cast-in-place concrete is employed for non-critical structural elements such as concrete foundations, floor slabs, and exterior walls with less than of earth cover. In contrast, precast reinforced concrete can be used for floors, walls, and roofs. Concrete masonry units should be or greater, with the use of “A” or “H” facilitating unit placement around vertical reinforcing bars, depending on the required structural integrity. It is typically advised to use Type S mortar, grout with a minimum strength of , and a concrete slab with a minimum strength of and thickness. Brick or stone masonry reinforced with steel bars can be utilized for walls that will be subjected to lateral or vertical pressure from earth cover. Masonry generally costs less than cast-in-place concrete. Wood can be widely employed in earth-sheltered buildings for structural and internal work, including floors, roofs, and exterior walls. However, wooden frame walls, which must endure lateral pressure, are limited to a burial depth of one story when used as a structural material. Beyond this depth, the cost will rapidly increase while using wood as a structural material. Although wood can be less expensive than other materials, it lacks steel&#x27;s strength, therefore it might not be the ideal option for structural material in some earth-sheltered dwellings, especially in moist soil type. Steel is used for beams, columns, bar joists, and masonry reinforcement. The advantage is that steel has high tensional and compressional strength, while the disadvantage is that it must be protected from corrosion if it is exposed to air, water, or other chemicals. It must be used effectively because it is also expensive.

===Excavation===
In earth-sheltered construction, there is often extensive excavation done on the building site. An excavation several feet larger than the walls&#x27; planned perimeter is made to allow for access to the outside of the wall for waterproofing and insulation.

===Foundations===
Once the site is prepared and the utility lines installed, a foundation of reinforced concrete is poured. The walls are then installed. Usually, they are either poured in place or formed either on or off-site and then moved into place. Reinforced concrete is the most common choice. The process is repeated for the roof structure. If the walls, floor, and roof are all to be poured in place, it is possible to make them with a single pour. This can reduce the likelihood of there being cracks or leaks at the joints where the concrete has cured at different times. The foundation of the buildings designed by Vetsch are built conventionally.

===Walls===
Several different methods of external (load-bearing) wall construction in earth shelters have been used successfully. These include concrete block (either conventionally mortared or surface-bonded), stone masonry, cordwood masonry, poured concrete, and pressure-treated wood. Earthships classically use rammed earth tire walls, which are labor-intensive but recycle used tires.

Oehler prescribed a very low budget method he termed &quot;post, shoring and polyethylene&quot;. This involves buried wooden posts to act as a frame, shored up with planks, and with a waterproofing barrier of polyethylene sheet between the planks and the backfill, but no foundation and nothing on the floor except a plastic sheet and carpeting.

Untreated wood in direct contact with earth rots within five years of use in earth shelter construction, but can be used for structural support construction in a well-insulated and water/moisture-proofed home. Reinforced concrete is the most commonly used structural material in earth shelter construction. It is strong and readily available. Steel can be used but needs to be encased by concrete to keep it from direct contact with the soil which corrodes the metal. Bricks and concrete masonry units are also possible options in earth shelter construction but must be reinforced to keep them from shifting under vertical pressure unless the building is constructed with arches and vaults.

Unfortunately, reinforced concrete is not the most environmentally sustainable material. The concrete industry is working to develop products that are more environmentally friendly in response to consumer demands. Products like Grancrete and Hycrete are becoming more readily available. They claim to be environmentally friendly and either reduce or eliminate the need for additional waterproofing. However, these have not been extensively used in earth shelter construction yet.

===Roof===

The roof of an earth shelter may not be covered by earth (earth berm only), or the roof may support a green roof with only a minimal thickness of earth. Alternatively a larger mass of earth might cover the roof. Such roofs must deal with significantly greater dead load and live load (e.g. increased weight of water in the earth after rain, or snow). This requires stronger and more substantial roof support structure. Some advise to have just enough thickness of earth on the roof to maintain a green roof (approximately 6 inches / 15 cm), since this means less load on the structure. Increasing the amount of earth on the roof past this gives only modest increases in the benefits while increasing costs significantly.

Despite being underground, drainage of water is still important. Therefore, earth shelters do not tend to have flat roofs. A flat roof is also less resistant to the weight of the earth. It is common for earth shelter designs to have arches and shallow domed roofs since this form resists vertical load well. One method uses finely meshed metal bent into the intended shape and welded to the supporting armature. Onto this mesh concrete is sprayed forming a roof. Terra-Dome (USA) is a company specializing in construction of earth-sheltered houses and sells a modular system of concrete domes intended to be covered by earth. Others advise the use of timber framed, gable roofs of pitch at least 1:12 to promote drainage. The roofs of Earthships tend to be mono-pitched, classically using vigas.

===Waterproofing===
On the outside of the concrete, a waterproofing system is applied. The most frequently used waterproofing system includes a layer of liquid asphalt onto which a heavy grade waterproof membrane is affixed, followed by a final liquid water sealant which may be sprayed on. It is very important to make sure that all of the seams are carefully sealed. It is very difficult to locate and repair leaks in the waterproofing system after the building is completed. Several layers are used for waterproofing in earth shelter construction. The first layer is meant to seal any cracks or pores in the structural materials, also working as an adhesive for the waterproof membrane. The membrane layer is often a thick flexible polyethylene sheeting called EPDM rubber. EPDM is the material usually used in a water garden, pond and swimming pool construction. This material also prevents roots from burrowing through the waterproofing. EPDM is very heavy to work with and can be chewed through by some common insects like fire ants. It is also made from petrochemicals, making it environmentally unsustainable.

There are various cement-like coatings that can be used as waterproofing. The product is sprayed directly onto the unprotected surface. It dries and acts like a huge ceramic layer between the wall and earth. The problem with this method is, if the wall or foundation shifts in any way, it cracks and water is able to penetrate through it easily.

Bituthene (registered name) is very similar to the three coat layering process only in one step. It comes already layered in sheets and has a self-adhesive backing. Applying it manually is the same as with the layering method, in addition, it is sun sensitive and must be covered very soon after application.

Eco-Flex is an environmentally friendly waterproofing membrane that seems to work very well on foundations, but not much is known about its effectiveness in earth sheltering. It is among a group of liquid paint-on waterproofing products. The main challenge with these products are they must be carefully applied, making sure that every area is covered to the right thickness, and that every crack or gap is tightly sealed.

Bentonite clay is an alternative that the most environmentally friendly. It is naturally occurring and self-healing. The drawback to this material is that it is very heavy, difficult for the owner/builder to install, and subject to termite damage.

Bi-membranes have been used extensively throughout Australia where 2 membranes are paired together—typically 2 coats of water-based epoxy as a &#x27;sealer&#x27; and stop the internal vapor pressure of the moist concrete exploding bubbles of vapor up underneath the membrane when exposed to hot sun. The bond strength of epoxy to concrete is stronger than the internal bond strength of concrete so the membranes won&#x27;t &#x27;blow&#x27; off the wall in the sun. Epoxies are very brittle so they are paired up with an overcoat of a high-build flexible water-based acrylic membrane in multiple coats of different colors to ensure film coverage—this is reinforced with non-woven polypropylene textile in corners and changes in direction.

===Insulation===
One or more insulation board or foam layers are added outside the waterproofing. If the insulation chosen is porous, a top layer of waterproofing is added. Unlike the conventional building, earth shelters require the insulation on the exterior of the building rather than inside the wall. One reason for this is that it protects the waterproof membrane against freeze damage, another is that the earth shelter is able to better retain its desired temperature. There are two types of insulation used in earth shelter construction. The first is close-celled extruded polystyrene sheets. Two to three inches glued to the outside of the waterproofing is generally sufficient. The second type of insulation is a spray on foam (e.g. polyurethane solid foam insulation). This works very well where the structure&#x27;s shape is unconventional, rounded or difficult to get to. Foam insulation requires an additional protective top coat such as foil or fleece filter to help it resist water penetration.

In some low budget earth shelters, insulation may not be applied to the walls. These methods rely on the earth&#x27;s U factor or thermal heat storage capacity below the frost layer. These designs are the exception however and risk frost heave damage in colder climates. The theory behind no insulation designs relies on using the earth&#x27;s thermal mass to store heat, rather than relying on a heavy masonry or cement inner structures that exist in a typical passive solar house. This is the exception to the rule and cold temperatures may extend down into the earth above the frost line making insulation necessary for higher efficiencies.

===Backfilling===
After previous construction stages are complete, the earth is backfilled against the external walls to create the berm. Depending on the drainage characteristics of the earth may not be suitable to place in direct contact with the external wall. Some advise that topsoil and turf (sod) be put aside from the initial excavation and be used for the grass roof and to place as the topmost layer on the berm.

===Finishings===
In the earth houses designed by Vetsch, interior walls are furnished using loam rendering, providing superior humidity compensation. The loam rendering is finally coated with lime-white cement paint.

<text>Krasnoyarsk is the largest city and administrative center of Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia. It is situated along the Yenisey River, and is the second-largest city in Siberia after Novosibirsk, with a population of over 1.1 million. Krasnoyarsk is an important junction of the renowned Trans-Siberian Railway, and is one of the largest producers of aluminum in the country. The city is known for its natural landscape; author Anton Chekhov judged Krasnoyarsk to be the most beautiful city in Siberia. The Stolby Nature Sanctuary is located 10 km south of the city. Krasnoyarsk is a major educational centre in Siberia, and hosts the Siberian Federal University. In 2019, Krasnoyarsk was the host city of the 2019 Winter Universiade, the third hosted in Russia.

==Etymology==
The predecessor fort was named Krasny Yar () after the Yarin (a dialect of Khakas) name of the place where it was built, &quot;Kyzyl Char&quot; (&#x27;red steep-riverbank&#x27;), which was translated as Krasny (Red) Yar.

==History==
The city was founded on August 19, 1628 as a Russian border fort when a group of service class people from Yeniseysk led by Andrey Dubenskiy arrived at the confluence of the Kacha and Yenisei Rivers and constructed fortifications intended to protect the frontier from attacks of native peoples who lived along the Yenisei and its tributaries. Along with Kansk to the east, it represented the southern limit of Russian expansion in the Yenisei basin during the seventeenth century. In a letter to Tsar Michael I the Cossacks reported:
:&quot;...The town of trunks (log buildings) we have constructed and around the place of fort, we the servants of thee, our Lord, have embedded posts and fastened them with double bindings and the place of fort have strengthened mightily...&quot;

The settlement was granted town status in 1690. An intensive growth of Krasnoyarsk began with the arrival of the Siberian Route (the road &quot;M53&quot; nowadays) in 1735 to 1741 which connected the nearby towns of Achinsk and Kansk with Krasnoyarsk and with the rest of Russia.

In 1749, a meteorite with a mass of about was found south of Krasnoyarsk. It was excavated by Peter Simon Pallas in 1772 and transported to Krasnoyarsk and subsequently to Saint Petersburg. The Krasnoyarsk meteorite is important because it was the first pallasite ever studied and the first meteorite ever etched.

In 1822 Krasnoyarsk became the administrative center of Yeniseysk Governorate. By the end of the 19th century, Krasnoyarsk had several manufacturing facilities and railroad workshops and an engine house. Growth continued with the discovery of gold and the arrival of a railroad in 1895.

In the Russian Empire, Krasnoyarsk was one of the places to which political exiles were banished. For example, eight Decembrists were deported from St. Petersburg to Krasnoyarsk after the failure of the revolt.
In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917, during the Russian Civil War, Siberia east of Omsk was controlled by white forces under Alexander Kolchak, who in December 1919 retreated east to Irkutsk and the Bolsheviks took control of the city. On a plateau 7 km outside of town was a prisoner of war camp with 13,000 German and Austrian troops. Elsa Brändström of the Swedish Red Cross spent almost a year there from July 1919 until May 1920.

During the periods of centralized planning (Five Year Plans) numerous large plants and factories were constructed in Krasnoyarsk: Sibtyazhmash, the dock yard, the paper factory, the hydroelectric power station (now the fifth largest in the world and the second in Russia), and the river port.

In 1934, Krasnoyarsk Krai was formed, with Krasnoyarsk as its administrative center.

During Stalinist times, Krasnoyarsk was a major center of the gulag system. The most important labor camp was the Kraslag or &quot;Krasnoyarsky ITL&quot; (1938-) with the two units located in Kansk and Reshyoty. In the city of Krasnoyarsk itself, the Yeniseylag or &quot;Yeniseysky ITL&quot; labor camp was prominent as well during World War II (–41).

During World War II, dozens of factories were evacuated from Ukraine and Western Russia to Krasnoyarsk and nearby towns, stimulating the industrial growth of the city. After the war, additional large plants were constructed: the aluminum plant, the metallurgic plant, the plant of base metals and many others.

In the late 1970s, the Soviet Union began constructing a phased array radar station at Abalakova, near Krasnoyarsk, which violated the ABM Treaty. Beginning in 1983, the United States demanded its removal, until the Soviet Union admitted the radar station was a violation in 1989. Equipment was slowly removed from the site and by 1992 it was officially declared to be dismantled, though the equipment from the site was likely relocated to a new site near Komsomolsk-on-Amur. Krasnoyarsk was also home to Krasnoyarsk Northeast air base, which was turned into living blocks after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and beginning of privatization, many large plants and factories, such as the Krasnoyarsk Aluminum Plant, became owned by alleged criminal authorities and oligarchs, while others were declared bankrupt. The economic transition resulted in a dramatic rise in unemployment and numerous strikes.

The best known financial scandal of the second half of the 1990s happened when ownership of the Krasnoyarsk Aluminum Plant by a known Krasnoyarsk businessman Anatoliy Bykov had been canceled after he was accused of murdering his partner, Vilor Struganov. The accusation eventually turned out to be false. The Krasnoyarsk plant&#x27;s ownership problems continue through the early 21st century since nearly all of them are owned either by monopolistic financial groups or by oligarchs.

Since the election of Pyotr Pimashkov as the mayor of Krasnoyarsk in 1996, the appearance of the city gradually improved: the old historical buildings were restored, the asphalt walkways were replaced with paving-stone, and numerous squares and recreation areas with fountains were either restored or constructed from scratch. Now the majority of the city keeps only a few traces of its former, drab, post-collapse look.

==Geography==


The total area of the city, including suburbs and the river, is .

The river Yenisei flows from west to east through the city. Due to the Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric dam upstream, the Yenisei never freezes in winter and never exceeds in summer through the city. Near the city center, its elevation is above sea level. There are several islands in the river, the largest of which are Tatyshev and Otdyha Isles, used mainly for recreation.

To the south and west, Krasnoyarsk is surrounded by forested mountains averaging in height above river level. The most prominent of them are Nikolayevskaya Sopka (notable for its ski jumping tracks), Karaulnaya Gora, and Chornaya Sopka, the latter being an extinct volcano. The gigantic rock cliffs of the Stolby Nature Reserve rise from the mountains of the southern bank of the Yenisei, the western hills from the Gremyachaya Griva crest extending westwards up to the Sobakina River, the north is generally plain, except for the Drokinskaya Sopka hill, with forests to the northwest and agricultural fields to the north and east.

The major rivers in and near Krasnoyarsk are the Yenisei, Mana, Bazaikha, and Kacha Rivers, the latter flowing throughout the historical center of the city. Due to the nature of the terrain, a few natural lakes exist in the vicinity of Krasnoyarsk.

The forests close to the city are mostly pine and birch; further afield, aspen becomes dominant in many areas. The moss-covered fir and Siberian pine replaces other wood in the mountains westward of the Karaulnaya River, in about to the west from the city, the forests to the south are mostly pine, fir and aspen.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Krasnoyarsk is the administrative center of the krai. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one rural locality (the village of Peschanka) incorporated as the &quot;krai city of Krasnoyarsk&quot;an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the krai city of Krasnoyarsk is incorporated as &quot;Krasnoyarsk Urban Okrug&quot;.

===City divisions===
For administrative purposes, Krasnoyarsk is divided into seven city districts:

* Kirovsky
* Leninsky
* Oktyabrsky
* Sovetsky
* Sverdlovsky
* Tsentralny
* Zheleznodorozhny
==Coat of arms==
The first version was approved on March 12, 1804. The coat of arms was divided horizontally into two parts, the upper part containing the coat of arms of Tomsk Governorate, and the lower part picturing the Krasny Yar cliff on a silver background. A revised coat of arms, approved on November 23, 1851, had the golden figure of a lion placed on a red heraldic shield with a spade in the right fore paw and a sickle in the left fore paw, both made of the same metal. The shield was topped with the golden crown of the Russian Empire. The current coat of arms (as depicted here) was approved on November 28, 2004. It contains the same red shield as in 1851 but with a slightly changed figure of the lion in the officially approved image. The shield is topped with a form of the mural crown, which is the golden five-tower coronet of rank of a federal subject administrative center.

==Climate==
Krasnoyarsk experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) bordering on a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;) in mountain part of city. Its climate is very similar to that of Fort McMurray and Winnipeg in Canada, the latter of which is a good deal further south geographically. Compared to Thompson, Manitoba, or Labrador City at similar latitudes, Krasnoyarsk&#x27;s winters are relatively mild. Compared to European cities on a similar latitude, Krasnoyarsk has much warmer summers, but much colder and longer winters (for example, Aalborg, Denmark). The summer is also on average warmer than similar inland latitudes of Scandinavia, owing to Siberia&#x27;s greater continentality. Krasnoyarsk has high differentials between summer and winter temperatures.

==Demographics==

Population count by districts (2010 Census):
* Kirovsky: 114,715
* Leninsky: 145,530
* Oktyabrsky: 153,112
* Sovetsky: 281,284
* Sverdlovsky: 130,596
* Tsentralny: 55,060
* Zheleznodorozhny: 93,529

The population of Krasnoyarsk includes a number of peoples, the most numerous are Russians, followed by Tajiks, Kyrgyz and other Central Asian and Caucasian peoples, whose number has grown extensively because of the vast, often illegal immigration in search for work.
Another populous immigrant group is the Chinese who, unlike other foreign workers, are employed in much more lucrative areas and often form business partnerships with local companies. Many Chinese trade at the bazaars, and a special large Chinese bazaar named &quot;Sodruzhestvo&quot; (Russian for &quot;fellowship&quot;), and the &quot;Chinese Trading Town&quot; (known in Russian as Китайский торговый город) or colloquially &quot;Kitai-gorod&quot; on Strelka.

As of the 2021 Census, the ethnic composition of Krasnoyarsk was:
==Architecture==
There are a number of historical buildings in Krasnoyarsk, the oldest of them being the Intercession Cathedral (, 1785 to 1795, restored in 1977 to 1978). Other locally significant samples of Russian Orthodox architecture are the Annunciation Cathedral (, 1802–12), the Holy Trinity Cathedral (, 1802–12), John the Baptist Church (, 1899, former episcopal residence), and the new Michael the Archangel Church (, 1998 to 2003).

On the top of the Karaulnaya Hill, originally a pagan shrine, later occupied by the Krasnoyarsk fort watchtower, the Paraskeva Pyatnitsa Chapel (1804, rebuilt 1854–55) still stands. The chapel, displayed on the 10-ruble note, is one of the iconic images of the city. The chapel was abandoned and fell into disrepair during the Soviet era and only when Perestroyka came was it regained by the Yenisei bishopric.
Another unofficial symbol of Krasnoyarsk is the incomplete 24-story tower located at Strelka. Construction of the tower had been started just before Perestroyka and then frozen due to the administrative crisis. The outline of the tower is clearly seen from many places in the city.

A bridge near Krasnoyarsk carries the Trans-Siberian Railway across the Yenisei. The original structure, one of the longest at the time, was constructed between 1893 and 1896 to an award-winning design by Lavr Proskuryakov. In 2003 it was rejected for emergency inscription on the World Heritage List. It was described at the time by ICOMOS &quot;an early representation of a typical parabolic polygonal truss bridge in Russia&quot; which became &quot;a testing ground for the application of engineering theories and the development of new innovative solutions, which had numerous successors&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHC-03/27COM/INF.8A ADD&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge was dismantled between 2002 and 2007.

Among other notable buildings are the mansions of the merchant Nikolay Gadalov (beginning of the 20th century), the Roman Catholic Transfiguration Chapel (, 1911, also known as the Krasnoyarsk Organ Hall), the Krasnoyarsk Krai Museum stylized as an Ancient Egyptian temple, the Krasnoyarsk Cultural/Historical Center and the triumphal arch at the Spit (2003), the regional administration building flanked with two towers known as the &quot;Donkey Ears&quot;.

There are a number of two-story wooden houses in the city built mostly in the middle of the 20th century as temporary habitations. Many urbanized villages located inside the city keep the remnants of the traditional Russian village architecture: wooden houses with backyards, many somewhat dilapidated now but still inhabited.

==Culture==

There are a number of local holidays celebrated annually in Krasnoyarsk. The most significant holiday is the Day of the City celebrated in June, usually with a carnival. Other holidays and cultural events are the Mana Festival (. The celebrations take place on the outside of town, on the bank of river Mana) usually held on the last weekend in June with the traditional bard contest, the International Museum Biennale traditionally held in the Krasnoyarsk Cultural/Historical Center, the avant-garde &quot;Museum Night&quot; festival dedicated to the International Museum Day (May 18), the Jazz on Yenisey festival, the Stolbist Day held many times a year celebrating the traditions of mountain climbing in the Stolby national reserve, and the Bikers&#x27; Rally.

Krasnoyarsk has a number of local television companies and the highly developed telecommunications, many districts of the city have LAN-based broadband Internet access.

The city is also home to the Krasnoyarsk Children&#x27;s Choir, a world-renowned choir that tours in many countries as The Little Eagles of Siberia.

==Education and science==
Next to Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk is a prominent scientific and educational center of Siberia, with over 30 higher education facilities, many of which are the branches of the Russian Academy of Science, and about 200 high schools. The most notable higher education institutes are:
* Siberian Federal University (Russian abbreviation is SFU), founded on November 4, 2006. The institution integrated four large higher education institutions (Krasnoyarsk State University, Krasnoyarsk State Academy of Architecture and Civil Construction, Krasnoyarsk State Technical University, State University of Non-Ferrous Metals and Gold)
* Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University (Russian abbreviation is KGPU), founded in 1932
* Siberian State Technological University (Russian abbreviation is SibGTU), the oldest in the city, founded in 1930 as the Siberian Institute of Forest
* Siberian State Aerospace University (Russian abbreviation is SibGAU), founded in 1960
* Krasnoyarsk State Medical University (Russian abbreviation is KrasGMU), founded in 1942
* Krasnoyarsk State Agrarian University (Russian abbreviation is Krasnoyarsk GAU), founded in 1952
Like Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk has a special city district called Akademgorodok (&quot;Academic Town&quot;), where several scientific research institutes are located. Krasnoyarsk&#x27;s Institute of Biophysics is known for a 1973–1985 experiment on ecological isolation of human beings (the &quot;Bios Experiment&quot;). Sukachev Institute of Forest, founded in 1944 at Moscow and relocated to Krasnoyarsk in 1959.
There are several museums in Krasnoyarsk. One is the Krasnoyarsk Regional Museum, containing historical items and exhibits of the region, including ancient history, native Siberians, and woolly rhinos.

The Krasnoyarsk zoo is also a major attraction for residents and tourists.

==Transportation==
=== Public transportation ===
The transit system is dominated by buses, but there also are several trolleybus and tram routes.

An underground metro system (three lines) has been in planning and construction phases in Krasnoyarsk for decades. Subway construction was terminated in 2008.
===Railway===

Krasnoyarsk lies on the Yenisei River and historically has been an important junction on the Trans-Siberian Railway. Krasnoyarsk-Passazhirsky (, lit. Krasnoyarsk-Passenger) is the main railway station of Krasnoyarsk. Long-range trains of the Trans-Siberian Railway stop at this station. There are some stations served by Elektrichka and there is Krasnoyarsk-East goods station 26.3 km east of Krasnoyarsk-Passazhirsky.

===Airports===
Krasnoyarsk was served by two airports: Yemelyanovo Airport is the main airport and handles both medium and long-haul domestic as well as international flights, and is northwest of the city. The secondary Cheremshanka Airport handled short-haul flights. Cheremshanka has lost its eminent role as the main base airport for an extensive network of local air services (MVL) in Krasnoyarsk Krai formerly served by the local Aeroflot Krasnoyarsk Directorate. In December 2011 a fire broke out at the Cheremshanka airport which destroyed the terminal building and the air traffic control tower.

==Tourism==
The most popular place of attraction for tourists visiting Krasnoyarsk is the huge national nature reserve Stolby (&quot;pillars&quot;), which covers an area of with numerous giant granite rocks formations up to 100 meters high, many of very extraordinary shapes. Stolby is also a major rock climbing location. Many local climbers intentionally do not use any belaying equipment and call their extreme sport &quot;stolbizm&quot;, known elsewhere as solo climbing.

Other popular showplaces include the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Power Station dam, the Karaulnaya Gora hill with the Paraskeva Pyatnitsa Chapel, museums, theaters, etc.

==Sports==
Krasnoyarsk is a center of Siberian sports. Areas, where Krasnoyarsk excels compared to other Russian cities, include rugby union, bandy, and freestyle wrestling.

Yenisey was the Soviet bandy champions every year in the 1980s as well as in 1991. The first Russian title came in 2001. In 2014 they became champions of the Bandy Super League and had the highest average attendance, 5 747. In 2015 the league title was won again as well as in 2016. At the 2019 Winter Universiade, bandy was due to feature as a demonstration sport for the first time and tournaments for both men and women were planned. An indoor stadium will be built for the occasion. It is planned to be ready for use by the end of 2018. The complexity of the construction is considered unique.

The city is considered a stronghold of rugby union in Russia, to the extent that the Rugby Union of Russia was headquartered locally for many years. Two Krasnoyarsk clubs, Krasny Yar and Enisey-STM, participate in the national Professional Rugby League, and European Rugby Challenge Cup, the second-tier pan-European club competition. Matches take precedence in the local media, and the city derby match can attract crowds of about 3000–5000. Many players of the Russian national rugby team hail from the area. Some of Russia&#x27;s international rugby matches are played at the Central Stadium.

Former Carolina Hurricanes left winger Alexander Semin is from Krasnoyarsk.

Host of the international wrestling tournament named after Ivan Yarygin.

<doc id="72237" wikidata="Q1542701" url="?curid=72237" title="Grand Prix Legends">
<text>Grand Prix Legends is a computer racing simulator developed by Papyrus Design Group and published in 1998 by Sierra On-Line under the Sierra Sports banner. It is inspired by the 1967 Formula One season and includes the teams Brabham, BRM, Eagle, Ferrari and Lotus. Two fictional teams called &quot;Murasama&quot; and &quot;Coventry&quot; replaced Honda and Cooper within the game.

==Gameplay==

The game offers several modes in which the player can race alone or against AI opponents. The game also features multiplayer via LAN. Many parameters affecting the skill and aggressiveness of the AI drivers can be specified.

==Development==
The game was in development for three years with a team of 25 to 30 people. Inspired by the 1966 film &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, the developers chose to base the game on the 1967 Formula 1 Grand Prix season because during that period tracks were narrow and lined with trees, houses, and other elements that in a video game can serve as backgrounds to enhance the sensation of speed. In addition, the more primitive suspension of cars of the time meant that the car physics could be more visually dramatic.

However, the amount of time that has passed since the 1967 Grand Prix season meant that some of the tracks the designers wanted to recreate no longer existed in their original form. The team visited town halls to get blueprints for defunct tracks. Papyrus co-founder Dave Kaemmer commented that the licensing for the game was difficult, but they had people who helped them during the development.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. &quot;GameSpot&quot; said that &quot;Grand Prix Legends&quot; has the most intense racing experience ever seen on a personal computer. &quot;Next Generation&quot; highly praised the graphics, gameplay, the recreation of 1967 Grand Prix season (in addition to its cars and tracks of its era), artificial intelligence and realistic driving model physics. The magazine ranked it at #47 in its list of the Fifty Best Games of All Time.

===Sales===
The game was a commercial failure; Andy Mahood of &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; described its sales as &quot;abysmally poor&quot;. In 2003, writer Mark H. Walker reported that &quot;the game sold only a few thousand copies&quot; in the United States, which he attributed to the general unpopularity of Formula One racing in the country. He noted that its &quot;steep learning curve kept many fans away&quot; in European markets. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Gord Goble attributed its performance to the &quot;combination of treacherous gameplay, sometimes glacial frame rates, and esoteric subject matter&quot;. It ultimately totalled 200,000 sales by 2004.

===Awards===
The game was the runner-up for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1998 &quot;Best Driving&quot; award, and for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s 1998 &quot;Driving Game of the Year&quot; award, both of which ultimately went to &quot;Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit&quot;. The staff of the former commented that &quot;Grand Prix Legends&quot; was the most ambitious and realistic driving simulation game of 1998, and the toughest to play.

The game won &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot;″ 1998 &quot;Sports Game of the Year&quot; award. The staff wrote that a few racing games could come close to &quot;Grand Prix Racing&quot;″s level of sophistication and uncompromising detail. It also won the Best Racing Game award at the 1998 &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot; Awards.

<text>Energy-efficient landscaping is a type of landscaping designed for the purpose of conserving energy. There is a distinction between the embedded energy of materials and constructing the landscape, and the energy consumed by the maintenance and operations of a landscape.

== Terminology and definition ==
Landscaping often refers to the practice of landscape design and gardening, which traditionally concern with designing sites with vegetation and craft for aesthetic, cultural, social, and religious purposes.

Landscape architecture and landscape engineering, on the other hand, are multi-disciplinary and interdisciplinary professions that integrate technical considerations, such as geography, ecology, biology, and engineering, into the design of landscape and the actualization of it.

Energy-efficient landscaping falls into the categories of the latter, and it stresses the energy conservation in site operation or the creation of the site. Among its various term usage, energy-efficient landscaping can refer to the reduction of energy usage in maintenance and operation of the landscape narrowly for the user/owner of the site, or broadly for the energy conservation of the global environment, such as mitigating urban heat island effect with reflective surface (increase albedo) or reducing the need of water treatment and sewage by using pervious pavement. Common methods of energy-efficient landscaping include reducing heat or cooling load of a building through shade, wind-blocking, and insulation; management of water; and using plants or construction material that cost less energy.

== Methods and techniques==

Design techniques include:

=== Shade with trees===
Planting trees for the purpose of providing shade, which reduces cooling costs. The mature height of the trees and their canopy shape need to be well studied. The locations of the trees should be chosen based on their height and the height of the building. Also, when trees are planted closer to the windows or walls, they will provide shade for a greater portion of the day as the Sun keep changing its relative position to the window and the trees. Planting the trees too close to the building, however, is also not desirable, as it might create the danger of touching above-ground or underground utility lines.

The type of leaves of the trees is also important. Broad-leaf evergreens like Southern magnolia can be used to provide dense year-round shade. However, needle-leaf evergreens like pines and cedars can provide more air circulation though their shade is sparser and more open.

Not only can tree shade be used to reduce the cooling load in building, it can also be used in parking lot, driveways, and playgrounds.

=== Windbreak ===

Planting or building windbreaks to slow winds near buildings, which reduces heat loss. Homes loses heat through infiltration in the Winter. Windbreaks should be designed to intercept and redirect the Winter winds before they reach the house and outdoor areas with playgrounds or sensitive plants. The windbreak in the Winter should also be designed so that they would not block the sunlight in the Winder or block the wind in the Summer.

=== Wall sheltering with shrubbery or vines ===

Planting shrubs near the wall creates an insulating air space around the wall. This is a similar idea to the use of a tree windbreak. Shrubs should be planted at least from the wall to prevent moisture and insect problems.

=== Taking advantage of natural landform ===

Earth sheltering is an example of using natural landform and geological condition to save energy in building a structure. It is believed to save energy in multiple ways: by using the rock or strong 

soil as wall and ground as the floor, construction cost is greatly reduced, because the structure will need less load bearing material and there is no need for excavation and foundation construction; the wall and the floor made of natural material likely will have better insulation than artificial wall and floors; Natural walls and floors can also reduce fire hazard, because they are hard to be ignited thus reduce the need for flame retardants.

In a study of simulating a structure with varying depth submerged in the ground to understand the insulating effect of natural wall and ground in cold climate, it was found that the thermal transmittance of the earth-sheltered walls and floor is 16% - 45% lower than that of the structure totally above ground.

Other than Earth Sheltering, a simpler way of taking advantage of natural landform is using geology, such as mountains, for shade.

=== Green roofs ===

Often, landscape design and architecture refers to the design in ground surface; in many contexts, specifically, the design guidance and topics are for a typical residential landscape in suburban housing, where there is a yard (garden), a driveway, and a house. In the crowded urban area, however, there is not abundant ground surface for landscape design. Green roofs, then, become an appealing option to add some aesthetics and green to the crowded cities. Not limited to the cities, green roofs can be applied to wherever it will fit. Most of times, actually, the decision to build Green roofs is based on local climate and policy. It is because other than its aesthetics, green roofs are used often for their ability to conserve energy, such as increasing insulation of the building roof, retaining and infiltrating rainwater, and potentially reducing urban heat island effect when it was installed to a certain scale. In Germany, for example, partly because of EU&#x27;s regulation, 17% of the new roof construction are green roofs. In Washington DC, green roofs are used as an alternative storm-water retention technique.
==== Benefits ====
Reducing building energy consumption by increasing the roof insulation: In total energy consumption reduction, green roof would have the best performance relative to a bare roof in a colder climate, which require nighttime heating. The reduction in heating load of the building increase as the soil depth of the green roof increase, though an increased soil depth would mean heavier roof. On the other hand, if a building is cooling-dominated, leaf area index is more important. In peak energy consumption reduction, green roof also has a notable effect, and the leaf area index and soil depth are both positively related to its performance.

Rainwater retention and evapotranspiration: 3-4 inches of soil can retain about 1 inch of rainwater. That is about 75% of precipitation in most areas in United States. By retaining the rainwater in soil, the water would not become runoff, instead they would result in evapotranspiration.

==== Controversies ====
Water runoff quality: When green roof is not able to hold the amount of the precipitation, the excessive rainwater will become runoff. In a field experiment where contaminated water is dripped into a green roof section to mimic rainfall in the green roof, the exfiltrate water was studied and analyzed. It was found that since the average level of suspended solid, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations in Green roof water outflow is significantly higher than that in conventional roof outflow, extensive green roofs will become a source of nutrient contamination in urban water environment.

Fire Hazard: Green roofs can be more easily ignited than conventional roofs; it is a concern that when the green roof caught fire, the high temperature would damage the roof structure itself. Not only the idea of damaging the roof is contradictory to energy conservation and sustainability, the fire and the roof damage could cause safety issue to the residents. It remains a matter of debate as to whether a green roof will exacerbate or mitigate the effects of a fire. Some argue that, because vegetation is about 95% water, the green roof actually reduces chances of a fire. On the other hand, some argue that during autumn and winter, when the vegetation is dry, fire hazard is increased. A recent study has found, through mathematical modelling, that when the vegetation itself caught fire, heat does penetrate downward (rather slowly as the thermal conductivity of soil is low), eventually damaging the roof itself. Thus the key to whether ignited vegetation will damage the roof or not depends on the thickness of the soil. The study also found that by installing a gypsum layer beneath the soil layer, the possibility of damaging the roof can be greatly reduced.

Additional structural load: Most old buildings were not designed for the extra roof dead load of the green roofs. If more energy is consumed in building the additional load bearing structure for the green roofs than the energy saved through insulation enhancement and water retention, it would be contradictory to the idea of energy conservation. By study, common green roofs types in the market would increase the load on the rood by 1.2 to 2.43 kilo-newton per square meter.

=== Pervious (porous/permeable) paving ===

A lot pavement in urban and suburban areas is impervious, this likely would result the contaminated stormwater runoff. In pre-development area, averagely 50% of storm-water would result in evapotranspiration, 5% in runoff, and 45% in infiltration, whereas in post-development area, only 35% storm-water result in evapotranspiration, and 50% in runoff, and 15% in infiltration. This change has caused various problem, such as flooding, infrastructural damage due to rapid movement of water, and water contamination.

By using pervious paving, however, the amount of infiltrated storm-water will be increased in post-development area, and the pollutants in the filtrated water can be reduced; thus the problem can be mitigated. In Low Impact Development 2008 Conference, ASCE performed two bench-scale study to examine the effectiveness of permeable interlocking concrete pavement in terms of water flow rate and the role of microbial colonies in pollutant removal in the micro-environment of porous pavement. The experiment shows 84% relative total suspended solids (TSS) removal on average, yet the increased relative removal over time suggests there is potentially solid buildup, and that may result system clogging and system failure. The evidence in pollutant removal proved the conclusion of the previous study that the annual pollutant runoff from the driveways was 86% lower for pervious driveways than impervious driveways.

Types of Pervious pavement include:

==== Porous asphalt ====
Advantage: Relatively low cost; Easy access to the material; Workers are experienced with it

Disadvantage: Susceptible to water damage; Usually used for short-term only; Low relative strength

==== Pervious concrete ====
Advantage: High structural strength; Easy access to the material

Disadvantage: Slow construction process; High initial cost

==== Permeable interlocking concrete paver ====
Advantage: Ease of Construction, Aesthetics, Ease of maintenance and repair

Disadvantage: High Cost; Only can be used for low speed road way 
==== Grid pavement ====
Advantage: Wide variety of products; Relatively inexpensive; Ease of maintenance and repair

Disadvantage: Typically limited to parking areas

The decision among different permeable pavement types depends on the need of the project, available material and equipment, and budget.

=== Effective and smart lighting ===
Site lighting with full cut off fixtures, light level sensors, and high efficiency fixtures.

=== Structure orientation ===
The sun rises from the East, moves South, and sets in the West. Thus, a rule of thumb for design is to avoid south-facing windows when trying to decrease cooling load of the building and increase south-facing windows when trying to decrease heating load of the building. The reality, however, is more complicated. The sun rises from East and sets in West perfectly only on the autumnal and vernal equinoxes, and during the vast majority of the year, Sun travels slightly southward and eastward depending on whether it is summer or winter and on whether the observer is in the Northern Hemisphere or the Southern Hemisphere.

To design for the best performance of the site, the designer needs to well understand the local climate and the site&#x27;s location relative to equator.

=== More to include ===
Energy-efficient landscaping techniques include using local materials, on-site composting and chipping to reduce green waste hauling, hand tools instead of gasoline-powered, and also may involve using drought-resistant plantings in arid areas, buying stock from local growers to avoid energy in transportation, and similar techniques.

== Example ==
In agreement with the city to build a resilient and sustainable landscape, Massachusetts Institute of Technology has initiated several energy efficiency upgrade projects, these projects include:

* Planting trees and using the tree canopy to provide shade for pedestrians, which also would give students more incentive to walk
* Landscape filters are added to (partly) treat rain water 
* Storm-water storage are installed to mitigate flood
* Lighter color pavement for reducing heat island effect

<doc id="72241" wikidata="Q313445" url="?curid=72241" title="Reginald Pole">
<text>Reginald Pole (12 March 1500 – 17 November 1558) was an English cardinal and the last Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury, holding the office from 1556 to 1558 during the Counter-Reformation.

== Early life ==
Pole was born at Stourton Castle, Staffordshire, on 12 March 1500, the third son of Sir Richard Pole and Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury. He was named after the now beatified Reginald of Orleans, O.P. His maternal grandparents were George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, and Isabel Neville, Duchess of Clarence; thus he was a great-nephew of kings Edward IV and Richard III and a great-grandson of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick.

Accounts vary as to where Pole received his early education: either Sheen Priory, Christchurch or Canterbury. Shortly thereafter, he matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1512. At Oxford he was taught by William Latimer, his principal tutor, and Thomas Linacre, who taught him at some point between 1518 and 1520. In 1512, Henry VIII had paid him a pension of £12, renewed the following year; intended to go towards his education. Pole graduated with a BA degree on 27 June 1515. In February 1518, King Henry granted him the deanery of Wimborne Minster, Dorset. He went on to be Prebendary of Salisbury, and Dean of Exeter in 1527. On 19 March 1518 he was appointed prebend of &quot;Ruscombe Southbury, Salisbury&quot;, only to exchange that on 10 April 1519 for &quot;Yetminster secunda&quot;. He was also a canon in York, and had several other livings, albeit not yet ordained a priest. Assisted by Bishop Edward Foxe, he represented Henry VIII in Paris in 1529, probing general opinion among theologians of the Sorbonne on the annulment of Henry&#x27;s marriage with Catherine of Aragon.

In 1521, with a £100 stipend from King Henry VIII, Pole went to the University of Padua. It was here that he met leading Renaissance figures, including Pietro Bembo, Gianmatteo Giberti (formerly Pope Leo X&#x27;s datary and chief minister), Jacopo Sadoleto, Gianpietro Carafa (the future Pope Paul IV), Rodolfo Pio, Otto Truchsess, Stanislaus Hosius, Cristoforo Madruzzo, Giovanni Morone, Pier Paolo Vergerio the younger, Peter Martyr Vermigli and Vettor Soranzo. The last three were eventually to be condemned as heretics by the Catholic Church. As a protestant theologian widely known, Vermigli contributed significantly to the Reformation in Pole&#x27;s native England.

Pole&#x27;s studies in Padua were partly financed by his election as a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. More than half of the cost was met by Henry VIII himself, on 14 February 1523. This allowed him to study abroad for three years.

While in Padua, Reginald&#x27;s brother, Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu, presented to him the living of South Harting, Sussex on 10 April 1526. Three months later, Pole returned home, arriving from France escorted by Thomas Lupset. He was appointed prebend of Knaresborough in York Minster on 22 April 1527. On 25 July 1527, Pole was presented a canonry in Exeter Cathedral, to be declared Dean just four days later. Pole was sent to Paris in October 1529, but returned home in the summer of 1530. For some of his time in England he lived in John Colet&#x27;s former house at Sheen.

== Pole and Henry VIII ==
Pole had most probably arrived back in England in 1527, but whatever political influence he had acquired was not documented until November 1528. By the following October, his being sent to Paris had been expressly to liberate from the university doctors an agreeable opinion on Henry VIII’s annulment. It is possible that Pole started learning Hebrew from Robert Wakefield after he returned home from France, which would suggest that Henry might have wanted to deploy Pole in the annulment project. Henry offered him the Archbishopric of York or the Diocese of Winchester if he would support the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. It is likely that in May or June 1531 Pole furnished Henry with an analysis of the political difficulties with regard to a divorce, particularly the dangers this would bring to the succession. Pole withheld his support and went into self-imposed exile in France and Italy in 1532, where he continued his studies in Padua and Paris. After his return, he held the benefice of vicar of Piddletown, Dorset, between 20 December 1532 and sometime around January 1536.

In May 1536, Reginald Pole finally and decisively broke with the King. Five years earlier, he had warned of the dangers of the Boleyn marriage; he had returned to Padua in 1532 and received a last English benefice that December. Eustace Chapuys, the imperial ambassador to England, had suggested to Emperor Charles V that Pole marry Henry&#x27;s daughter Mary and combine their dynastic claims; Chapuys also communicated with Reginald through his brother Geoffrey. At this time Pole was not definitively in Holy Orders.

The final break between Pole and Henry followed upon Thomas Cromwell, Cuthbert Tunstall, Thomas Starkey and others addressing questions to Pole on behalf of Henry. He answered by sending the King a copy of his published treatise &quot;Pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione&quot;, which, besides being a theological reply to the questions, was a strong denunciation of the King&#x27;s policies, refuting Henry&#x27;s position on marrying his brother Arthur&#x27;s widow and denying the royal supremacy. Pole also urged the princes of Europe to depose Henry immediately. Henry wrote to Pole&#x27;s mother, the Countess of Salisbury, who in turn sent her son a letter reproving him for his &quot;folly&quot;.

== Cardinal Pole ==

On 22 December 1536, Pole, already a deacon, was created a cardinal over Pole&#x27;s own objections. He was the fourth of the five English cardinals of the first half of the sixteenth century. He also became papal legate to England in February 1536/1537. Pope Paul III put him in charge of organising assistance for the Pilgrimage of Grace (and related movements), an effort to organise a march on London to demand Henry replace his ‘reformist’ advisers with more traditional, Catholic minds; neither Francis I of France nor the Emperor supported this effort, and the English government tried to have Pole assassinated. In 1539, Pole was sent to the Emperor to organise an embargo against England – the sort of countermeasure he had himself warned Henry was possible.

The King, with Pole himself out of his reach, took revenge on Pole&#x27;s family for engaging in treason by word against the King. This later became known as the Exeter Conspiracy. The leading members were arrested, and all their properties seized. This destroyed the Pole family. Sir Geoffrey Pole was arrested in August 1538; he had been corresponding with Reginald. The investigation of Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter (Henry VIII&#x27;s first cousin and the Countess of Salisbury&#x27;s first cousin once removed) had turned up his name. Sir Geoffrey appealed to Thomas Cromwell, who had him arrested and interrogated. Under interrogation, Sir Geoffrey admitted that Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu, and Exeter had both been parties to his correspondence with Reginald. Montagu, Exeter, and Lady Salisbury were arrested in November 1538, together with Henry Pole and other family members, on charges of treason. This was despite Cromwell having previously written that they had &quot;little offended save that he [Reginald Pole] is of their kin&quot;. They were committed to the Tower of London and, apart from Geoffrey Pole, they were all eventually executed.

In January 1539, Sir Geoffrey was pardoned. Montagu and Exeter were tried and executed for treason. Reginald Pole was attainted &quot;in absentia&quot;. In May 1539, Montagu, Exeter, Lady Salisbury, and others were also attainted, as her father had been; this meant that they lost their lands – mostly in the South of England, conveniently located (alleged the crown) to assist any invasion – and titles. Those still alive in the Tower were also sentenced to death, and so could be executed at the King&#x27;s will. As part of the evidence given in support of the Bill of Attainder, Cromwell produced a tunic bearing the Five Wounds of Christ, purported to show Lady Salisbury&#x27;s support of traditional Catholicism. This, supposedly, came to light six months after her house and effects had already been searched when she was arrested. It is likely to have been planted there.

Margaret Pole was held in the Tower of London for two and a half years under severe conditions; she, her grandson (Montagu&#x27;s son), and Exeter&#x27;s son were held together on orders of the King. In 1540, Cromwell himself fell from favour and was himself attainted and executed. Margaret was finally executed in 1541, protesting her innocence until the last – a highly publicised case considered a grave miscarriage of justice both at the time and later. Her execution was gruesome, botched by an inexperienced executioner, who delivered nearly a dozen blows before she was finally killed. Pole is known to have said that he would &quot;never fear to call himself the son of a martyr&quot;. Some 350 years later, in 1886, Margaret was beatified by Pope Leo XIII. Aside from the hostile treatise &quot;Pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione&quot;, another contribution fuelling King Henry&#x27;s brutality towards the Pole family might have been that Pole&#x27;s mother, Margaret, was one of the last surviving members of the House of Plantagenet. Under some circumstances, that line of descent could have made Reginald – until he definitely entered the clergy – a possible contender for the throne itself.

In 1542 Reginald Pole was appointed as one of the three papal legates to preside over the Council of Trent. In the papal conclave of 1549–50 which followed the death of Pope Paul III in 1549, Pole, at one point, had 26 out of the 28 votes he needed to become pope himself. His personal belief in justification by faith alone over works had caused him problems at Trent and accusations of heretical crypto-Lutheranism at the conclave. Thomas Hoby, visiting Rome so as to be present in the city during the conclave, recorded that Pole failed to be elected &quot;by the Cardinall of Ferrara his meanes the voice of manie cardinalls of the French partie, persuading them that Cardinall Pole was both Imperiall and also a verie Lutheran&quot;.

== Later years ==

The death of Edward VI on 6 July 1553 and the accession of Mary I to the throne of England hastened Pole&#x27;s return from exile, as a papal legate to England (which he remained until 1557) with a view to receiving the kingdom back into the Catholic fold. However, Queen Mary I and Emperor Charles V delayed his arrival in the country until 20 November 1554, due to concerns that Pole might oppose Mary&#x27;s forthcoming marriage to Charles&#x27;s son, Philip of Spain. It was only after the marriage was safely out of the way, that the English parliament finally set about repealing his attainder on November 22, 1554. Pole opened his papal commission and presented his legatine credentials before Philip &amp; Mary and the assembled members of Parliament at the Palace of Whitehall on November 27, 1554, delivering a notable oration before them. Among the dignitaries in attendance was Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor of England, the most prominent Catholic minister in England, who would steer the restoration of Catholicism through parliament in January 1555.

As papal legate, Pole negotiated a papal dispensation allowing the new owners of confiscated former monastic lands to retain these. In return for this concession, Parliament then enabled the Revival of the Heresy Acts in January 1555. This revived former measures against heresy: the letters patent of 1382 of Richard II, the Suppression of Heresy Act 1400 (2 Hen. 4. c. 15) of Henry IV, and the Suppression of Heresy Act 1414 (2 Hen. 5. Stat. 1. c. 7) of Henry V. All of these had been repealed under Henry VIII and Edward VI. On 13 November 1555, Thomas Cranmer was officially deprived of the See of Canterbury. The Pope promoted Pole to the rank of cardinal-priest and made him administrator of the See of Canterbury on 11 December 1555.

Pole was finally ordained a priest on 20 March 1556 and consecrated a bishop two days later, becoming archbishop of Canterbury. an office he would hold until his death. In 1555 and 1555/1556 respectively he also became chancellor of both Oxford and Cambridge universities. As well as his religious duties, he was in effect the Queen&#x27;s chief minister and adviser. Many former enemies, including Cranmer, signed recantations affirming their religious belief in transubstantiation and papal supremacy. Despite this, which should have absolved them under Mary&#x27;s own Revival of the Heresy Acts, the Queen could not forget their responsibility for the annulment of her mother&#x27;s marriage.

In 1555, Queen Mary began permitting the burning of Protestants for heresy, and some 220 men and 60 women were executed before her death in 1558. In the view of some historians, these so-called Marian persecutions contributed to the ultimate victory of the English Reformation, though Pole&#x27;s involvement in these heresy trials is disputed. Pole was in failing health during the worst period of persecution, and there is some evidence that he favoured a more lenient approach: &quot;Three condemned heretics from Bonner&#x27;s diocese were pardoned on an appeal to him; he merely enjoined a penance and gave them absolution.&quot; As the reign wore on, an increasing number of people turned against Mary and her government, and some people who had been indifferent to the English Reformation began turning against Catholicism. Writings such as John Foxe&#x27;s 1568 &quot;Book of Martyrs&quot;, which emphasised the sufferings of the reformers under Mary, helped shape popular opinion against Catholicism in England for generations.

Despite being a lifelong devout Catholic, Pole had a long-running dispute with Pope Paul IV, dating from before the latter&#x27;s election as Pope. Elected in 1555, Paul IV had a distaste for Catholic humanism and men like Pole who pushed a softer version of Catholicism to win over Protestants, as well as being fiercely anti-Spanish and against Mary&#x27;s marriage to Philip II of Spain and heavily against Pole&#x27;s support for it. Because of this disagreement Paul first cancelled Pole&#x27;s legatine authority, and then sought to recall Pole to Rome to face investigation for heresy in his early writings. Mary refused to send Pole to Rome, yet accepted his suspension from office. In the will of Sir Robert Acton dated 24 September 1558 he is named as one of the Executors, despite the fact that Sir Robert expressed himself in terms consistent with his dying in the Protestant faith.
Pole died in London, during an influenza epidemic, on 17 November 1558, at about 7:00 pm, nearly 12 hours after Queen Mary&#x27;s death. He was buried on the north side of the Corona at Canterbury Cathedral.

== Author ==
Pole was the author of &quot;De Concilio&quot;, of a treatise on the authority of the pope and of a set of measures introduced by him to restore Catholic practice in England. He was also the author of many important letters, full of interest for the history of the time, edited by Angelo Maria Quirini.

Pole is known for his strong condemnation of Machiavelli&#x27;s book &quot;The Prince&quot;, which he read in Italy, and on which he commented: &quot;I found this type of book to be written by an enemy of the human race. It explains every means whereby religion, justice and any inclination toward virtue could be destroyed&quot;.

<text>A surname, family name, or last name is the mostly hereditary portion of one&#x27;s personal name that indicates one&#x27;s family. It is typically combined with a given name to form the full name of a person, although several given names and surnames are possible in the full name. In modern times most surnames are hereditary, although in most countries a person has a right to change their name.

Depending on culture, the surname may be placed either at the start of a person&#x27;s name, or at the end. The number of surnames given to an individual also varies: in most cases it is just one, but in Portuguese-speaking countries and many Spanish-speaking countries, two surnames (one inherited from the mother and another from the father) are used for legal purposes. Depending on culture, not all members of a family unit are required to have identical surnames. In some countries, surnames are modified depending on gender and family membership status of a person. Compound surnames can be composed of separate names.

The use of names has been documented in even the oldest historical records. Examples of surnames are documented in the 11th century by the barons in England. English surnames began to be formed with reference to a certain aspect of that individual, such as their trade, father&#x27;s name, location of birth, or physical features, and were not necessarily inherited. By 1400 most English families, and those from Lowland Scotland, had adopted the use of hereditary surnames.

The study of proper names (in family names, personal names, or places) is called onomastics.

==History==
===Origin===
While the use of given names to identify individuals is attested in the oldest historical records, the advent of surnames is relatively recent. Many cultures have used and continue to use additional descriptive terms in identifying individuals. These terms may indicate personal attributes, location of origin, occupation, parentage, patronage, adoption, or clan affiliation.

In China, according to legend, family names started with Emperor Fu Xi in 2000 BC. His administration standardised the naming system to facilitate census-taking, and the use of census information. Originally, Chinese surnames were derived matrilineally, although by the time of the Shang dynasty (1600 to 1046 BC) they had become patrilineal. Chinese women do not change their names upon marriage. In China, surnames have been the norm since at least the 2nd century BC. 

In the early Islamic period (640–900 AD) and the Arab world, the use of patronymics is well attested. The famous scholar Rhazes () is referred to as &quot;al-Razi&quot; (lit. the one from Ray) due to his origins from the city of Ray, Iran. In the Levant, surnames were in use as early as the High Middle Ages and it was common for people to derive their surname from a distant ancestor, and historically the surname would be often preceded with &#x27;ibn&#x27; or &#x27;son of&#x27;. Arab family names often denote either one&#x27;s tribe, profession, a famous ancestor, or the place of origin; but they were not universal. For example, Hunayn ibn Ishaq (fl. 850 AD) was known by the nisbah &quot;al-&#x27;Ibadi&quot;, a federation of Arab Christian tribes that lived in Mesopotamia prior to the advent of Islam.

In Ancient Greece, as far back as the Archaic Period clan names and patronymics (&quot;son of&quot;) were also common, as in Aristides as Λῡσῐμᾰ́χου – a genitive singular form meaning son of Lysimachus. For example, Alexander the Great was known as &quot;Heracleides&quot;, as a supposed descendant of Heracles, and by the dynastic name &quot;Karanos&quot;/&quot;Caranus&quot;, which referred to the founder of the dynasty to which he belonged. These patronymics are already attested for many characters in the works of Homer. At other times formal identification commonly included the place of origin.

Over the course of the Roman Republic and the later Empire, naming conventions went through multiple changes. (&quot;See Roman naming conventions.&quot;) The &quot;nomen&quot;, the name of the gens (tribe) inherited patrilineally, is thought to have already been in use by 650 BC. The &quot;nomen&quot; was to identify group kinship, while the &quot;praenomen&quot; (forename; plural &quot;praenomina&quot;) was used to distinguish individuals within the group. Female &quot;praenomina&quot; were less common, as women had reduced public influence, and were commonly known by the feminine form of the &quot;nomen&quot; alone.

===Medieval era and beyond===
Later with the gradual influence of Greek and Christian culture throughout the Empire, Christian religious names were sometimes put in front of traditional &quot;cognomina&quot;, but eventually people reverted to single names. By the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, family names were uncommon in the Eastern Roman Empire. In Western Europe, where Germanic culture dominated the aristocracy, family names were almost non-existent. They would not significantly reappear again in Eastern Roman society until the 10th century, apparently influenced by the familial affiliations of the Armenian military aristocracy. The practice of using family names spread through the Eastern Roman Empire, however it was not until the 11th century that surnames came to be used in West Europe.

Medieval Spain used a patronymic system. For example, Álvaro, a son of Rodrigo, would be named Álvaro Rodríguez. His son, Juan, would not be named Juan Rodríguez, but Juan Álvarez. Over time, many of these patronymics became family names, and they are some of the most common names in the Spanish-speaking world today. Other sources of surnames are personal appearance or habit, e.g. Delgado (&quot;thin&quot;) and Moreno (&quot;dark&quot;); geographic location or ethnicity, e.g. Alemán (&quot;German&quot;); and occupations, e.g. Molinero (&quot;miller&quot;), Zapatero (&quot;shoe-maker&quot;) and Guerrero (&quot;warrior&quot;), although occupational names are much more often found in a shortened form referring to the trade itself, e.g. Molina (&quot;mill&quot;), Guerra (&quot;war&quot;), or Zapata (archaic form of &quot;zapato&quot;, &quot;shoe&quot;).

In England the introduction of family names is generally attributed to the preparation of the Domesday Book in 1086, following the Norman Conquest. Evidence indicates that surnames were first adopted among the feudal nobility and gentry, and slowly spread to other parts of society. Some of the early Norman nobility who arrived in England during the Norman conquest differentiated themselves by affixing &#x27;de&#x27; (of) before the name of their village in France. This is what is known as a territorial surname, a consequence of feudal landownership. By the 14th century, most English and most Scottish people used surnames and in Wales following unification under Henry VIII in 1536.

A four-year study led by the University of the West of England, which concluded in 2016, analysed sources dating from the 11th to the 19th century to explain the origins of the surnames in the British Isles. The study found that over 90% of the 45,602 surnames in the dictionary are native to Britain and Ireland, with the most common in the UK being Smith, Jones, Williams, Brown, Taylor, Davies, and Wilson. The findings have been published in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland&quot;, with project leader Richard Coates calling the study &quot;more detailed and accurate&quot; than those before. He elaborated on the origins: &quot;Some surnames have origins that are occupational – obvious examples are Smith and Baker. Other names can be linked to a place, for example, Hill or Green, which relates to a village green. Surnames that are &#x27;patronymic&#x27; are those which originally enshrined the father&#x27;s name – such as Jackson, or Jenkinson. There are also names where the origin describes the original bearer such as Brown, Short, or Thin – though Short may in fact be an ironic &#x27;nickname&#x27; surname for a tall person.&quot;

In the modern era, governments have enacted laws to require people to adopt surnames. This served the purpose of uniquely identifying subjects for taxation purposes or for inheritance. In the late Middle Ages in England, mandatory surnames were resisted as they were associated with taxes.

===Modern era===
During the modern era many cultures around the world adopted family names, particularly for administrative reasons, especially during the age of European expansion and particularly since 1600. The Napoleonic Code, adopted in various parts of Europe, stipulated that people should be known by both their given name(s) and a family name that would not change across generations. Other notable examples include the Netherlands (1795–1811), Japan (1870s), Thailand (1920), and Turkey (1934). The structure of the Japanese name was formalized by the government as &quot;family name&quot; + &quot;given name&quot; in 1868. 

In Breslau Prussia enacted the Hoym Ordinance in 1790, mandating the adoption of Jewish surnames. Napoleon also insisted on Jews adopting fixed names in a decree issued in 1808.

Names can sometimes be changed to protect individual privacy (such as in witness protection), or in cases where groups of people are escaping persecution. After arriving in the United States, European Jews who fled Nazi persecution sometimes anglicized their surnames to avoid discrimination. Governments can also forcibly change people&#x27;s names, as when the National Socialist government of Germany assigned German names to European people in the territories they conquered. In the 1980s, the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria forcibly changed the first and last names of its Turkish citizens to Bulgarian names.

== Origins of particular surnames ==

===Patronymic and matronymic surnames=== 

These are the oldest and most common type of surname. They may be a first name such as &quot;Wilhelm&quot;, a patronymic such as &quot;Andersen&quot;, a matronymic such as &quot;Beaton&quot;, or a clan name such as &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Multiple surnames may be derived from a single given name: e.g. there are thought to be over 90 Italian surnames based on the given name &quot;Giovanni&quot;. 

====Examples====
* Patronal from patronage (&quot;Hickman&quot; meaning Hick&#x27;s man, where Hick is a pet form of the name Richard) or strong ties of religion &quot;Kilpatrick&quot; (follower of Patrick) or &quot;Kilbride&quot; (follower of Saint Brigid of Kildare).
* Patronymics, matronymics or ancestral, often from a person&#x27;s given name. e.g., from male name: &quot;Richardson&quot;, &quot;Stephenson&quot;, &quot;Jones&quot; (Welsh for Johnson), &quot;Williams&quot;, &quot;Jackson&quot;, &quot;Wilson&quot;, &quot;Thompson&quot;, &quot;Benson&quot;, &quot;Johnson&quot;, &quot;Harris&quot;, &quot;Evans&quot;, &quot;Simpson&quot;, &quot;Willis&quot;, &quot;Davies&quot;, &quot;Reynolds&quot;, &quot;Adams&quot;, &quot;Dawson&quot;, &quot;Lewis&quot;, &quot;Rogers&quot;, &quot;Murphy&quot;, &quot;Morrow&quot;, &quot;Nicholson&quot;, &quot;Robinson&quot;, &quot;Powell&quot;, &quot;Ferguson&quot;, &quot;Davis&quot;, &quot;Edwards&quot;, &quot;Hudson&quot;, &quot;Roberts&quot;, &quot;Harrison&quot;, &quot;Watson&quot;, or female names &quot;Molson&quot; (from Moll for Mary), &quot;Madison&quot; (from Maud), &quot;Emmott&quot; (from Emma), &quot;Marriott&quot; (from Mary) or from a clan name (for those of Scottish origin, e.g., &quot;MacDonald&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;Henderson&quot;, &quot;Armstrong&quot;, &quot;Grant&quot;, &quot;Cameron&quot;, &quot;Stewart&quot;, &quot;Douglas&quot;, &quot;Crawford&quot;, &quot;Campbell&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;) with &quot;Mac&quot; Gaelic for son.

===Cognominal surnames===
This is the broadest class of surnames, originating from nicknames, encompassing many types of origin. These include names based on appearance such as &quot;Schwartzkopf&quot;, &quot;Short&quot;, and possibly &quot;Caesar&quot;, and names based on temperament and personality such as &quot;Daft&quot;, &quot;Gutman&quot;, and &quot;Maiden&quot;, which, according to a number of sources, was an English nickname meaning &quot;effeminate&quot;. 

A group of nicknames look like occupational ones: King, Bishop, Abbot, Sheriff, Knight, etc. but it is rather unlikely that a person with surname King was a king or descended from a king. Bernard Deacon suggests that the first nickname/surname bearer may have acted like a king or bishop, or was as corpulent as a bishop. etc.

A considerable group of surname-producing nicknames may be found among ethnonymic surnames.

===Ornamental/artificial surnames===
Ornamental surnames (also known as artificial surnames) are not specific to any attribute (place, parentage, occupation, caste) of the first person to acquire the name. They were generally acquired later in history and generally when those without surnames needed them. In 1526, King Frederik I of Denmark-Norway ordered that noble families must take up fixed surnames, and many of them took as their name some element of their coat of arms; for example, the Rosenkrantz (&quot;rose wreath&quot;) family took their surname from a wreath of roses forming the torse of their arms, and the Gyldenstierne (&quot;golden star&quot;) family took theirs from a 7-pointed gold star on their shield. Subsequently, many middle-class Scandinavian families desired names similar to those of the nobles and adopted &quot;ornamental&quot; surnames as well.

Most other naming traditions refer to them as &quot;acquired&quot;. They might be given to people newly immigrated, conquered, or converted, as well as those with unknown parentage, formerly enslaved, or from parentage without a surname tradition.

Ornamental surnames are more common in communities that adopted (or were forced to adopt) surnames in the 18th and 19th centuries. They occur commonly in Scandinavia, and among Sinti and Roma and Eastern Ashkenazi Jews in Germany and Austria.

===Acquired/assigned surnames===
During the era of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade many Africans were given new names by their masters. Many of the family names of many African-Americans have their origins in slavery (&quot;i.e.&quot; slave name). Some freed slaves later created family names themselves.

Another category of acquired names is foundlings&#x27; names. Historically, children born to unwed parents or extremely poor parents would be abandoned in a public place or anonymously placed in a foundling wheel. Such abandoned children might be claimed and named by religious figures, the community leaders, or adoptive parents. Some such children were given surnames that reflected their condition, like (Italian) Esposito, Innocenti, Della Casagrande, Trovato, Abbandonata, or (Dutch) Vondeling, Verlaeten, Bijstand. Other children were named for the street/place they were found (Union, Liquorpond (street), di Palermo, Baan, Bijdam, van den Eyngel (shop name), van der Stoep, von Trapp), the date they were found (Monday, Septembre, Spring, di Gennaio), or festival/feast day they found or christened (Easter, SanJosé). Some foundlings were given the name of whoever found them.

===Occupational surnames === 

Occupational names include &quot;Smith&quot;, &quot;Miller&quot;, &quot;Farmer&quot;, &quot;Thatcher&quot;, &quot;Shepherd&quot;, &quot;Potter&quot;, and so on, and analogous names in many other languages, see, e.g., . There are also more complicated names based on occupational titles. In England it was common for servants to take a modified version of their employer&#x27;s occupation or first name as their last name, adding the letter &quot;s&quot; to the word, although this formation could also be a patronymic. For instance, the surname &quot;Vickers&quot; is thought to have arisen as an occupational name adopted by the servant of a vicar, while &quot;Roberts&quot; could have been adopted by either the son or the servant of a man named Robert. A subset of occupational names in English are names thought to be derived from the medieval mystery plays. The participants would often play the same roles for life, passing the part down to their oldest sons. Names derived from this may include &quot;King&quot;, &quot;Lord&quot; and &quot;Virgin&quot;. &quot;A Dictionary of English Surnames&quot; says that &quot;surnames of office, such as Abbot, Bishop, Cardinal and King, are often nicknames&quot;. The original meaning of names based on medieval occupations may no longer be obvious in modern English.

===Toponymic surnames===

Location (toponymic, habitation) names derive from the inhabited location associated with the person given that name. Such locations can be any type of settlement, such as homesteads, farms, enclosures, villages, hamlets, strongholds, or cottages. One element of a habitation name may describe the type of settlement. Examples of Old English elements are frequently found in the second element of habitational names. The habitative elements in such names can differ in meaning, according to different periods, different locations, or with being used with certain other elements. For example, the Old English element &quot;tūn&quot; may have originally meant &quot;enclosure&quot; in one name, but can have meant &quot;farmstead&quot;, &quot;village&quot;, &quot;manor&quot;, or &quot;estate&quot; in other names.

Location names, or habitation names, may be as generic as &quot;Monte&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;mountain&quot;), &quot;Górski&quot; (Polish for &quot;hill&quot;), or &quot;Pitt&quot; (variant of &quot;pit&quot;), but may also refer to specific locations. &quot;Washington&quot;, for instance, is thought to mean &quot;the homestead of the family of Wassa&quot;, while &quot;Lucci&quot; means &quot;resident of Lucca&quot;. Although some surnames, such as &quot;London&quot;, &quot;Lisboa&quot;, or &quot;Białystok&quot; are derived from large cities, more people reflect the names of smaller communities, as in Ó Creachmhaoil, derived from a village in County Galway. This is thought to be due to the tendency in Europe during the Middle Ages for migration to chiefly be from smaller communities to the cities and the need for new arrivals to choose a defining surname.

In Portuguese-speaking countries, it is uncommon, but not unprecedented, to find surnames derived from names of countries, such as Portugal, França, Brasil, Holanda. Surnames derived from country names are also found in English, such as &quot;England&quot;, &quot;Wales&quot;, &quot;Spain&quot;.

Some Japanese surnames derive from geographical features; for example, Ishikawa (石川) means &quot;stone river&quot; (and is also the name of one of Japan&#x27;s prefectures), Yamamoto (山本) means &quot;the base of the mountain&quot;, and Inoue (井上) means &quot;above the well&quot;.

Arabic names sometimes contain surnames that denote the city of origin. For example, in cases of Saddam Hussein al Tikriti, meaning Saddam Hussein originated from Tikrit, a city in Iraq. This component of the name is called a &quot;nisbah&quot;.

====Examples====
* Estate names For those descended from land-owners, the name of their holdings, castle, manor or estate, e.g. Ernle, Windsor, Staunton
* Habitation (place) names e.g., Burton, Flint, Hamilton, London, Laughton, Leighton, Murray, Sutton, Tremblay
* Topographic surnames (geographical features) e.g., Bridge or Bridges, Brook or Brooks, Bush, Camp, Hill, Lake, Lee or Leigh, Wood, Grove, Holmes, Forest, Underwood, Hall, Field, Stone, Morley, Moore, Perry

===Other===
The meanings of some names are unknown or unclear. The most common European name in this category may be the Irish name Ryan, which means &#x27;little king&#x27; in Irish. Also, Celtic origin of the name Arthur, meaning &#x27;bear&#x27;. Other surnames may have arisen from more than one source: the name De Luca, for instance, likely arose either in or near Lucania or in the family of someone named Lucas or Lucius; in some instances, however, the name may have arisen from Lucca, with the spelling and pronunciation changing over time and with emigration. The same name may appear in different cultures by coincidence or romanization; the surname Lee is used in English culture, but is also a romanization of the Chinese surname &quot;Li&quot;. In the Russian Empire, illegitimate children were sometimes given artificial surnames rather than the surnames of their adoptive parents.

== Order of names ==
In many cultures (particularly in European and European-influenced cultures in the Americas, Oceania, etc., as well as West Asia/North Africa, South Asia, and most Sub-Saharan African cultures), the surname or family name (&quot;last name&quot;) is placed after the personal, forename (in Europe) or given name (&quot;first name&quot;). In other cultures the surname is placed first, followed by the given name or names. The latter is often called the Eastern naming order because Europeans are most familiar with the examples from the East Asian cultural sphere, specifically, Greater China, Korea (both North and South), Japan, and Vietnam. This is also the case in Cambodia and among the Hmong of Laos and Thailand. The Telugu people of south India also place surname before personal name. There are some parts of Europe, in particular Hungary, where the surname is placed before the personal name.

Since family names are normally written last in European societies, the terms last name or surname are commonly used for the family name, while in Japan (with vertical writing) the family name may be referred to as &quot;upper name&quot; ().

When people from areas using Eastern naming order write their personal name in the Latin alphabet, it is common to reverse the order of the given and family names for the convenience of Westerners, so that they know which name is the family name for official/formal purposes. Reversing the order of names for the same reason is also customary for the Baltic Finnic peoples and the Hungarians, but other Uralic peoples traditionally did not have surnames, perhaps because of the clan structure of their societies. The Samis, depending on the circumstances of their names, either saw no change or did see a transformation of their name. For example: Sire in some cases became Siri, and Hætta Jáhkoš Ásslat became Aslak Jacobsen Hætta – as was the norm. Recently, integration into the EU and increased communications with foreigners prompted many Samis to reverse the order of their full name to given name followed by surname, to avoid their given name being mistaken for and used as a surname.

Indian surnames may often denote village, profession, and/or caste and are invariably mentioned along with the personal/first names. However, hereditary last names are not universal. In Telugu-speaking families in south India, surname is placed before personal / first name and in most cases it is only shown as an initial (for example &#x27;S.&#x27; for Suryapeth).

In English and other languages, although the usual order of names is &quot;first middle last&quot;, for the purpose of cataloging in libraries and in citing the names of authors in scholarly papers, the order is changed to &quot;last, first middle,&quot; with the last and first names separated by a comma, and items are alphabetized by the last name. In France, Italy, Spain, Belgium and Latin America, administrative usage is to put the surname before the first on official documents.

==Gender-specific versions of surname==
In most Balto-Slavic languages (such as Latvian, Lithuanian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, Polish, Slovak, Czech, etc.) as well as in Greek, Irish, Icelandic, and Azerbaijani, some surnames change form depending on the gender of the bearer.

In Slavic languages, substantivized adjective surnames have commonly symmetrical adjective variants for males and females (/ in Polish, / in Czech or Slovak, etc.). In the case of nominative and quasi-nominative surnames, the female variant is derived from the male variant by a possessive suffix (Novák/Nováková, Hromada/Hromadová). In Czech and Slovak, the pure possessive would be , , but the surname evolved to a more adjectivized form , , to suppress the historical possessivity. Some rare types of surnames are universal and gender-neutral: examples in Czech are , , , . These are the archaic form of the possessive, related to the plural name of the family. Such rare surnames are also often used for transgender persons during transition because most common surnames are gender-specific.

The informal dialectal female form in Polish and Czech dialects was also (, ). With the exception of the / suffix, most feminine forms of surnames are seldom observed in Polish.

Generally, inflected languages use names and surnames as living words, not as static identifiers. Thus, the pair or the family can be named by a plural form which can differ from the singular male and female form. For instance, when the male form is Novák and the female form Nováková, the family name is in Czech and in Slovak. When the male form is Hrubý and the female form is Hrubá, the plural family name is Hrubí (or &quot;rodina Hrubých&quot;).

In Greece, if a man called Papadopoulos has a daughter or wife, she will likely be named Papadopoulou, the genitive form, as if the daughter/wife is &quot;of&quot; a man named Papadopoulos. Likewise, the surnames of daughters and wives of males with surnames ending in -as will end in -a, and those of daughters and wives of males with the -is suffix will have the -i suffix.

Latvian, like Lithuanian, uses strictly feminized surnames for women, even in the case of foreign names. The function of the suffix is purely grammatical. Male surnames ending or need not be modified for women. Exceptions are:
* The female surnames which correspond to nouns in the sixth declension with the ending &quot;&quot; – &quot;Iron&quot;, (&quot;iron&quot;), &quot;rock&quot;
* Surnames of both genders, which are written in the same nominative case form because they correspond to nouns in the third declension ending in &quot; (&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
* Surnames based on an adjective have indefinite suffixes typical of adjectives: &quot;, &quot; (&quot;, &quot;) or the specified endings &quot;, &quot; (&quot;, &quot;) (&quot;diligent&quot;).

In Iceland, surnames have a gender-specific suffix (-dóttir = daughter, -son = son). This was also the case in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, until they were abolished by law in 1856, 1923, and 1966 respectively.

Finnish used gender-specific suffixes up to 1929 when the Marriage Act forced women to use the husband&#x27;s form of the surname. In 1985, this clause was removed from the act.

Until at least 1850, women&#x27;s surnames were suffixed with an -in in Tyrol.

===Indication of family membership status===

Some Slavic cultures originally distinguished the surnames of married and unmarried women by different suffixes, but this distinction is no longer widely observed. Some Czech dialects (Southwest-Bohemian) use the form &quot;&quot; as informal for both genders. In the culture of the Sorbs (a.k.a. Wends or Lusatians), Sorbian used different female forms for unmarried daughters (, , , ), and for wives (, , , ). In Polish, typical surnames for unmarried women ended , , or , while the surnames of married women used the possessive suffixes or . In Serbia, unmarried women&#x27;s surnames ended in -eva, while married women&#x27;s surnames ended in -ka. In Lithuania, if the husband is named Vilkas, his wife will be named Vilkienė and his unmarried daughter will be named Vilkaitė. Male surnames have suffixes -as, -is, -ius, or -us, unmarried girl surnames aitė, -ytė, -iūtė or -utė, wife surnames -ienė. These suffixes are also used for foreign names, exclusively for grammar; Welby, the surname of the present Archbishop of Canterbury for example, becomes in Lithuanian, while his wife is &quot;Velbienė&quot;, and his unmarried daughter, &quot;Velbaitė&quot;.

Many surnames include prefixes that may or may not be separated by a space or punctuation from the main part of the surname. These are usually not considered true compound names, rather single surnames are made up of more than one word. These prefixes often give hints about the type or origin of the surname (patronymic, toponymic, notable lineage) and include words that mean from [a place or lineage], and son of/daughter of/child of.

The common Celtic prefixes &quot; or &quot; (descendant of) and &quot; or &quot; (son of) can be spelled with the prefix as a separate word, yielding &quot; or &quot; as well as the anglicized &quot; and &quot; or &quot;&quot;. Other Irish prefixes include , (daughter of the son of), , and (wife of the son of).

A surname with the prefix &quot;Fitz&quot; can be spelled with the prefix as a separate word, as in &quot;Fitz William&quot;, as well as &quot;FitzWilliam&quot; or &quot;Fitzwilliam&quot; (like, for example, Robert FitzRoy). &quot;Fitz&quot; comes from French () thus making these surnames a form of patronymic.

== Surname law ==

A family name is typically a part of a person&#x27;s personal name and, according to law or custom, is passed or given to children from at least one of their parents&#x27; family names. The use of family names is common in most cultures around the world, but each culture has its own rules as to how the names are formed, passed, and used. However, the style of having both a family name (surname) and a given name (forename) is far from universal (see §History below). In many cultures, it is common for people to have one name or mononym, with some cultures not using family names. Issues of family name arise especially on the passing of a name to a newborn child, the adoption of a common family name on marriage, the renunciation of a family name, and the changing of a family name.

Surname laws vary around the world. Traditionally in many European countries for the past few hundred years, it was the custom or the law for a woman, upon marriage, to use her husband&#x27;s surname and for any children born to bear the father&#x27;s surname. If a child&#x27;s paternity was not known, or if the putative father denied paternity, the newborn child would have the surname of the mother. That is still the custom or law in many countries. The surname for children of married parents is usually inherited from the father. In recent years, there has been a trend towards equality of treatment in relation to family names, with women being not automatically required, expected or, in some places, even forbidden, to take the husband&#x27;s surname on marriage, with the children not automatically being given the father&#x27;s surname. In this article, both family name and surname mean the patrilineal surname, which is handed down from or inherited from the father, unless it is explicitly stated otherwise. Thus, the term &quot;maternal surname&quot; means the &quot;patrilineal&quot; surname that one&#x27;s mother inherited from either or both of her parents. For a discussion of &quot;matrilineal&quot; (&#x27;mother-line&#x27;) surnames, passing from mothers to daughters, see matrilineal surname.

==Surname of women==
King Henry VIII of England (reigned 1509–1547) ordered that marital births be recorded under the surname of the father. In England and cultures derived from there, there has long been a tradition for a woman to change her surname upon marriage from her birth name to her husband&#x27;s family name. (See Maiden and married names.)

In the Middle Ages, when a man from a lower-status family married an only daughter from a higher-status family, he would often adopt the wife&#x27;s family name. In the 18th and 19th centuries in Britain, bequests were sometimes made contingent upon a man&#x27;s changing (or hyphenating) his family name, so that the name of the testator continued.

The United States followed the naming customs and practices of English common law and traditions until recent times. The first known instance in the United States of a woman insisting on the use of her birth name was that of Lucy Stone in 1855, and there has been a general increase in the rate of women using their birth name. Beginning in the latter half of the 20th century, traditional naming practices (writes one commentator) were recognized as &quot;com[ing] into conflict with current sensitivities about children&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rights&quot;. Those changes accelerated a shift away from the interests of the parents to a focus on the best interests of the child. The law in this area continues to evolve today mainly in the context of paternity and custody actions.

Naming conventions in the US have gone through periods of flux, however, and the 1990s saw a decline in the percentage of name retention among women. As of 2006, more than 80% of American women adopted the husband&#x27;s family name after marriage.

It is rare but not unknown for an English-speaking man to take his wife&#x27;s family name, whether for personal reasons or as a matter of tradition (such as among matrilineal Canadian aboriginal groups, such as the Haida and Gitxsan). Upon marriage to a woman, men in the United States can change their surnames to that of their wives, or adopt a combination of both names with the federal government, through the Social Security Administration. Men may face difficulty doing so on the state level in some states.

It is exceedingly rare but does occur in the United States, where a married couple may choose an entirely new last name by going through a legal change of name. As an alternative, both spouses may adopt a double-barrelled name. For instance, when John Smith and Mary Jones marry each other, they may become known as &quot;John Smith-Jones&quot; and &quot;Mary Smith-Jones&quot;. A spouse may also opt to use their birth name as a middle name, and e.g. become known as &quot;Mary Jones Smith&quot;. An additional option, although rarely practiced, is the adoption of the last name derived from a blend of the prior names, such as &quot;Simones&quot;, which also requires a legal name change. Some couples keep their own last names but give their children hyphenated or combined surnames.

In 1979, the United Nations adopted the &quot;Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women&quot; (&quot;CEDAW&quot;), which declared in effect that women and men, and specifically wife and husband, shall have the same rights to choose a &quot;family name&quot;, as well as a profession and an occupation.

In some places, civil rights lawsuits or constitutional amendments changed the law so that men could also easily change their married names (e.g., in British Columbia and California). Québec law permits neither spouse to change surnames.

In France, until 1 January 2005, children were required by law to take the surname of their father. Article 311-21 of the French Civil code now permits parents to give their children the family name of either their father, mother, or hyphenation of both – although no more than two names can be hyphenated. In cases of disagreement, both names are used in alphabetical order. This brought France into line with a 1978 declaration by the Council of Europe requiring member governments to take measures to adopt equality of rights in the transmission of family names, a measure that was echoed by the United Nations in 1979.

Similar measures were adopted by West Germany (1976), Sweden (1982), Denmark (1983), Finland (1985) and Spain (1999). The European Community has been active in eliminating gender discrimination. Several cases concerning discrimination in family names have reached the courts. &quot;Burghartz v. Switzerland&quot; challenged the lack of an option for husbands to add the wife&#x27;s surname to his surname, which they had chosen as the family name when this option was available for women. &quot;Losonci Rose and Rose v. Switzerland&quot; challenged a prohibition on foreign men married to Swiss women keeping their surname if this option was provided in their national law, an option available to women. &quot;Ünal Tekeli v. Turkey&quot; challenged prohibitions on women using their surname as the family name, an option only available to men. The Court found all these laws to be in violation of the convention.

From 1945 to 2021 in the Czech Republic women by law had to use family names with the ending -ová after the name of their father or husband (so-called &quot;přechýlení&quot;). This was seen as discriminatory by a part of the public. Since 1 January 2022, Czech women can decide for themselves whether they want to use the feminine or neutral form of their family name.

==Compound surnames==

While in many countries surnames are usually one word, in others a surname may contain two words or more, as described below.

=== English ===

Compound surnames in English and several other European cultures feature two (or occasionally more) words, often joined by a hyphen or hyphens. However, it is not unusual for compound surnames to be composed of separate words not linked by a hyphen, for example Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of the British Conservative Party, whose surname is &quot;Duncan Smith&quot;.

=== Chinese ===

Some Chinese surnames use more than one character.

== Multiple surnames ==
=== Spanish-speaking countries ===

In Spain and in most Spanish-speaking countries, the custom is for people to have two surnames, with the first surname coming from the father and the second from the mother; the opposite order is now legally allowed in Spain but still unusual. In informal situations typically only the first one is used, although both are needed for legal purposes. A child&#x27;s first surname will usually be their father&#x27;s first surname, while the child&#x27;s second surname will usually be their mother&#x27;s first surname. For example, if José García Torres and María Acosta Gómez had a child named Pablo, then his full name would be Pablo García Acosta. One family member&#x27;s relationship to another can often be identified by the various combinations and permutations of surnames.


In some instances, when an individual&#x27;s first surname is very common, such as for example in José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the second surname tends to gain preeminence over the first one in informal use. Rodríguez Zapatero, therefore is more often called just &quot;Zapatero&quot; and almost never &quot;Rodríguez&quot; only; in other cases, such as in writer Mario Vargas Llosa, a person becomes usually called by both surnames. This changes from person to person and stems merely from habit.

In Spain, feminist activism pushed for a law approved in 1999 that allows an adult to change the order of his/her family names, and parents can also change the order of their children&#x27;s family names if they (and the child, if over 12) agree, although this order must be the same for all their children.

In Spain, especially Catalonia, the paternal and maternal surnames are often combined using the conjunction &quot;y&quot; (&quot;and&quot; in Spanish) or &quot;i&quot; (&quot;and&quot; in Catalan), see for example the economist Xavier Sala-i-Martin or painter Salvador Dalí i Domènech.

In Spain, a woman does not generally change her legal surname when she marries. In some Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, a woman may, on her marriage, drop her mother&#x27;s surname and add her husband&#x27;s surname to her father&#x27;s surname using the preposition &quot;de&quot; (&quot;of&quot;), &quot;del&quot; (&quot;of the&quot;, when the following word is masculine) or &quot;de la&quot; (&quot;of the&quot;, when the following word is feminine). For example, if &quot;Clara Reyes Alba&quot; were to marry &quot;Alberto Gómez Rodríguez&quot;, the wife could use &quot;Clara Reyes &quot;de&quot; Gómez&quot; as her name (or &quot;Clara Reyes Gómez&quot;, or, rarely, &quot;Clara Gómez Reyes&quot;. She can be addressed as &quot;Sra. de Gómez&quot; corresponding to &quot;Mrs Gómez&quot;). Feminist activists have criticized this custom as they consider it sexist. In some countries, this form may be mainly social and not an official name change, i.e. her name would still legally be her birth name. This custom, begun in medieval times, is decaying and only has legal validity in Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, Peru, Panama, and to a certain extent in Mexico (where it is optional but becoming obsolete), but is frowned upon by people in Spain, Cuba, and elsewhere. In Peru and the Dominican Republic, women normally conserve all family names after getting married. For example, if &quot;Rosa María Pérez Martínez&quot; marries &quot;Juan Martín De la Cruz Gómez&quot;, she will be called &quot;Rosa María Pérez Martínez de De la Cruz&quot;, and if the husband dies, she will be called &quot;Rosa María Pérez Martínez Vda. de De la Cruz&quot; (Vda. being the abbreviation for &quot;viuda&quot;, &quot;widow&quot; in Spanish). The law in Peru changed some years ago, and all married women can keep their maiden last name if they wish with no alteration.

Historically, sometimes a father transmitted his combined family names, thus creating a new one e.g., the paternal surname of the son of &quot;Javier&quot; (given name) &quot;Reyes&quot; (paternal family name) &quot;de la Barrera&quot; (maternal surname) may have become the new paternal surname &quot;Reyes de la Barrera&quot;. For example, Uruguayan politician Guido Manini Rios has inherited a compound surname constructed from the patrilineal and matrilineal surnames of a recent ancestor. &quot;De&quot; is also the nobiliary particle used with Spanish surnames. This can not be chosen by the person, as it is part of the surname, for example, &quot;Puente&quot; and &quot;Del Puente&quot; are not the same surname.

Sometimes, for single mothers or when the father would or could not recognize the child, the mother&#x27;s surname has been used twice: for example, &quot;Ana Reyes Reyes&quot;. In Spain, however, children with just one parent receive both surnames of that parent, although the order may also be changed. In 1973 in Chile, the law was changed to avoid stigmatizing illegitimate children with the maternal surname repeated.

Some Hispanic people, after leaving their country, drop their maternal surname, even if not formally, so as to better fit into the non-Hispanic society they live or work in. Similarly, foreigners with just one surname may be asked to provide a second surname on official documents in Spanish-speaking countries. When none (such as the mother&#x27;s maiden name) is provided, the last name may simply be repeated.

A new trend in the United States for Hispanics is to hyphenate their father&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s last names. This is done because American-born English-speakers are not aware of the Hispanic custom of using two last names and thus mistake the first last name of the individual for a middle name. In doing so they would, for example, mistakenly refer to Esteban Álvarez Cobos as Esteban A. Cobos. Such confusion can be particularly troublesome in official matters. To avoid such mistakes, Esteban Álvarez Cobos, would become Esteban Álvarez-Cobos, to clarify that both are last names.

In some churches, such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where the family structure is emphasized, as well as a legal marriage, the wife is referred to as &quot;hermana&quot; [sister] plus the surname of her husband. And most records of the church follow that structure as well.

==== Informal traditional names ====
In many places, such as villages in Catalonia, Galicia, and Asturias and in Cuba, people are often informally known by the name of their dwelling or collective family nickname rather than by their surnames. For example, Remei Pujol i Serra who lives at Ca l&#x27;Elvira would be referred to as &quot;Remei de Ca l&#x27;Elvira&quot;; and Adela Barreira López who is part of the &quot;Provisores&quot; family would be known as &quot;Adela dos Provisores&quot;.

Also in many places, such as Cantabria, the family&#x27;s nickname is used instead of the surname: if one family is known as &quot;Ñecos&quot; because of an ancestor who was known as &quot;Ñecu&quot;, they would be &quot;José el de Ñecu&quot; or &quot;Ana la de Ñecu&quot; (collective: the Ñeco&#x27;s). Some common nicknames are &quot;Rubiu&quot; (blond or red hair), &quot;Roju&quot; (reddish, referring to their red hair), &quot;Chiqui&quot; (small), &quot;Jinchu&quot; (big), and a bunch of names about certain characteristics, family relationship or geographical origin (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ).

==== Compound surnames ====
Beyond the seemingly &quot;compound&quot; surname system in the Spanish-speaking world, there are also true compound surnames. These true compound surnames are passed on and inherited as compounds. For instance, former chairman of the Supreme Military Junta of Ecuador, General Luis Telmo Paz y Miño Estrella, has Luis as his first given name, Telmo as his middle name, the true compound surname Paz y Miño as his first (i.e. paternal) surname, and Estrella as his second (i.e. maternal) surname. Luis Telmo Paz y Miño Estrella is also known more casually as Luis Paz y Miño, Telmo Paz y Miño, or Luis Telmo Paz y Miño. He would never be regarded as Luis Estrella, Telmo Estrella, or Luis Telmo Estrella, nor as Luis Paz, Telmo Paz, or Luis Telmo Paz. This is because &quot;Paz&quot; alone is not his surname (although other people use the &quot;Paz&quot; surname on its own). In this case, Paz y Miño is in fact the paternal surname, being a true compound surname. His children, therefore, would inherit the compound surname &quot;Paz y Miño&quot; as their paternal surname, while Estrella would be lost, since the mother&#x27;s paternal surname becomes the children&#x27;s second surname (as their own maternal surname). &quot;Paz&quot; alone would not be passed on, nor would &quot;Miño&quot; alone.

To avoid ambiguity, one might often informally see these true compound surnames hyphenated, for instance, as Paz-y-Miño. This is true especially in the English-speaking world, but also sometimes even in the Hispanic world, since many Hispanics are unfamiliar with this and other compound surnames, &quot;Paz y Miño&quot; might be inadvertently mistaken as &quot;Paz&quot; for the paternal surname and &quot;Miño&quot; for the maternal surname. Although Miño did start off as the maternal surname in this compound surname, it was many generations ago, around five centuries, that it became compounded, and henceforth inherited and passed on as a compound.

Other surnames which started off as compounds of two or more surnames, but which merged into one single word, also exist. An example would be the surname Pazmiño, whose members are related to the Paz y Miño, as both descend from the &quot;Paz Miño&quot; family of five centuries ago.

Álava, Spain is known for its incidence of true compound surnames, characterized for having the first portion of the surname as a patronymic, normally a Spanish patronymic or more unusually a Basque patronymic, followed by the preposition &quot;de&quot;, with the second part of the surname being a placename from Álava.

=== Portuguese-speaking countries ===
In Portuguese naming customs, the main surname (the one used in alpha sorting, indexing, abbreviations, and greetings), appears last.

Each person usually has two family names: though the law specifies no order, the first one is usually the maternal family name and the last one is commonly the paternal family name. In Portugal, a person&#x27;s full name has a minimum legal length of two names (one given name and one family name from either parent) and a maximum of six names (two first names and four surnames – he or she may have up to four surnames in any order desired picked up from the total of his/her parents and grandparents&#x27; surnames). The use of any surname outside this lot, or of more than six names, is legally possible, but it requires dealing with bureaucracy. Parents or the person him/herself must explain the claims they have to bear that surname (a family nickname, a rare surname lost in past generations, or any other reason one may find suitable). In Brazil, there is no limit of surnames used.

In the Portuguese tradition, the mother&#x27;s surname usually comes first, followed by the father&#x27;s surname. A woman may adopt her husband&#x27;s , but nevertheless, she usually keeps her birth name or at least the last one. Since 1977 in Portugal and 2012 in Brazil, a husband can also adopt his wife&#x27;s surname. When this happens, usually both spouses change their name after marriage.

The custom of a woman changing her name upon marriage is recent. It spread in the late 19th century in the upper classes, under French influence, and in the 20th century, particularly during the 1930s and 1940, it became socially almost obligatory. Nowadays, fewer women adopt, even officially, their husbands&#x27; names, and among those who do so officially, it is quite common not to use it either in their professional or informal life.

The children usually bear only the last surnames of the parents (i.e., the paternal surname of each of their parents). For example, &quot;Carlos da Silva Gonçalves&quot; and &quot;Ana Luísa de Albuquerque Pereira (Gonçalves)&quot; (in case she adopted her husband&#x27;s name after marriage) would have a child named &quot;Lucas Pereira Gonçalves&quot;. However, the child may have any other combination of the parents&#x27; surnames, according to euphony, social significance, or other reasons. For example, is not uncommon for the firstborn male to be given the father&#x27;s full name followed by &quot;Júnior&quot; or &quot;Filho&quot; (son), and the next generation&#x27;s firstborn male to be given the grandfather&#x27;s name followed by &quot;Neto&quot; (grandson). Hence &quot;Carlos da Silva Gonçalves&quot; might choose to name his first born son &quot;Carlos da Silva Gonçalves Júnior&quot;, who in turn might name his first born son &quot;Carlos da Silva Gonçalves Neto&quot;, in which case none of the mother&#x27;s family names are passed on.



In ancient times a patronymic was commonly used – surnames like &quot;Gonçalves&quot; (&quot;son of &quot;Gonçalo&quot;&quot;), &quot;Fernandes&quot; (&quot;son of &quot;Fernando&quot;&quot;), &quot;Nunes&quot; (&quot;son of &quot;Nuno&quot;&quot;), &quot;Soares&quot; (&quot;son of &quot;Soeiro&quot;&quot;), &quot;Sanches&quot; (&quot;son of &quot;Sancho&quot;&quot;), &quot;Henriques&quot; (&quot;son of &quot;Henrique&quot;&quot;), &quot;Rodrigues&quot; (&quot;son of &quot;Rodrigo&quot;&quot;) which along with many others are still in regular use as very prevalent family names.

In medieval times, Portuguese nobility started to use one of their estates&#x27; names or the name of the town or village they ruled as their surname, just after their patronymic. Soeiro Mendes da Maia bore a name &quot;Soeiro&quot;, a patronymic &quot;Mendes&quot; (&quot;son of Hermenegildo – shortened to Mendo&quot;) and the name of the town he ruled &quot;Maia&quot;. He was often referred to in 12th-century documents as &quot;Soeiro Mendes, senhor da Maia&quot;, Soeiro Mendes, lord of Maia. Noblewomen also bore patronymics and surnames in the same manner and never bore their husband&#x27;s surnames. First-born males bore their father&#x27;s surname, other children bore either both or only one of them at their will.

Only during the Early Modern Age, lower-class males started to use at least one surname; married lower-class women usually took up their spouse&#x27;s surname, since they rarely ever used one beforehand. After the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, Portuguese authorities realized the benefits of enforcing the use and registry of surnames. Henceforth, they became mandatory, although the rules for their use were very liberal.

Until the end of the 19th century, it was common for women, especially those from a very poor background, not to have a surname and so to be known only by their first names. A woman would then adopt her husband&#x27;s full surname after marriage. With the advent of republicanism in Brazil and Portugal, along with the institution of civil registries, all children now have surnames.
During the mid-20th century, under French influence and among upper classes, women started to take up their husbands&#x27; . From the 1960s onwards, this usage spread to the common people, again under French influence, this time, however, due to the forceful legal adoption of their husbands&#x27; surname which was imposed onto Portuguese immigrant women in France.

From the 1974 Carnation Revolution onwards the adoption of their husbands&#x27; receded again, and today both the adoption and non-adoption occur, with non-adoption being chosen in the majority of cases in recent years (60%). Also, it is legally possible for the husband to adopt his wife&#x27;s , but this practice is rare.
== Prevalence ==

In the United States, 1,712 surnames cover 50% of the population, and about 1% of the population has the surname Smith, the most common American name. 

According to some estimates, 85% of China&#x27;s population shares just 100 surnames. The names Wang (王), Zhang (张), and Li (李) are the most frequent.

<doc id="72245" wikidata="Q241806" url="?curid=72245" title="Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury">
<text>Margaret Plantagenet, Countess of Salisbury (14 August 1473 – 27 May 1541), was the only surviving daughter of George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence (a brother of Kings Edward IV and Richard III) and his wife Isabel Neville. As a result of Margaret&#x27;s marriage to Richard Pole, she was also known as Margaret Pole. She was one of just two women in 16th-century England to be a peeress in her own right (&quot;suo jure&quot;) without a husband in the House of Lords.

One of the few members of the House of Plantagenet to have survived the Wars of the Roses, Margaret was executed in 1541 at the command of King Henry VIII, the second monarch of the House of Tudor, who was the son of her first cousin, Elizabeth of York. Pope Leo XIII beatified her as a martyr for the Catholic Church on 29 December 1886. One of her sons, Reginald Pole, was the last Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury.

==Early life==

Margaret was born at Farleigh Castle in Somerset. She was the only surviving daughter of George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence, and his wife Isabel Neville. George was a son of Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, and a brother of both Edward IV and Richard III. Isabel was the elder daughter and coheiress of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (&quot;Warwick the Kingmaker&quot;) and his wife Anne Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick. 

Warwick was killed fighting against Margaret&#x27;s uncles at the Battle of Barnet. Her father, already Duke of Clarence, was then created Earl of Salisbury and of Warwick. Edward IV declared that Margaret&#x27;s younger brother, Edward, should be known as Earl of Warwick, but only as a courtesy title and no peerage was ever created for him. Margaret would have had a claim to the Earldom of Warwick, but the earldom was forfeited on the attainder of her brother Edward. She was most likely named for her paternal aunt Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy. 

Isabel died suddenly on 22 December 1476, when Margaret was only three years old. Two months earlier she had given birth to a son, Richard (who would only outlive her by a year). The death of his wife led Clarence to believe that her lady-in-waiting and midwife, Ankarette Twynyho, and a servant, had poisoned her and his son with a &quot;venomous drink of ale&quot;. He had them brought to trial, found guilty and executed on very slim evidence by a rigged court in April 1477. His grief over his wife&#x27;s death, and the midwife having been a distant cousin of the Woodvilles, suggested by his sister-in-law Elizabeth Woodville, made him distance himself from his brother, Edward IV.

The Duke of Clarence plotted against Edward IV, and in February 1478 was attainted and executed for treason. His lands and titles were thereby forfeited. Edward IV died in 1483 when Margaret was ten. The following year, the late King&#x27;s marriage was declared invalid by the statute &quot;Titulus Regius&quot;, making his children illegitimate. As Margaret and her brother, Edward, were debarred from the throne by their father&#x27;s attainder, their uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, became King Richard III in 1483. He reinforced young Margaret and Edward’s exclusion from the line of succession, and married Anne Neville, Margaret’s maternal aunt. In 1484, Margaret and her brother were residing in the King&#x27;s Northern estates in the care of their aunt. Pole learned how to play the virginals as a child.

In 1485, Richard III was defeated and killed at the Battle of Bosworth by Henry Tudor, who succeeded him as Henry VII. The new King married Margaret&#x27;s cousin, Elizabeth of York, Edward IV&#x27;s eldest daughter. Margaret and her brother were taken into their care as wards of the crown. They lived with the King&#x27;s mother, Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond, and Margaret is recorded as attending the christening of the King and Queens first child, Arthur Tudor, Prince of Wales, in Winchester during September 1486. 

The new Tudor King suspected anyone with blood ties to the Plantagenets as coveting the throne, and as young Edward was the last male Plantagenet and a potential House of York claimant, he was moved to the Tower of London in 1485. Edward was briefly displayed in public at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in 1487 in response to the presentation of the impostor Lambert Simnel as the &quot;Earl of Warwick&quot; to the Irish lords. When Perkin Warbeck impersonated Edward IV&#x27;s presumed-dead son, Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York, in 1499, Margaret&#x27;s brother Edward was attainted and executed. His lands and titles were confiscated.

== Marriage ==
Margaret remained dynastically important to the new Tudor dynasty due to her Yorkist lineage and unquestionably noble blood. When she was 14 years old, Henry VII arranged her marriage to his favoured cousin and loyal servant, Richard Pole, who was 11 years her senior and from a gentry family. Whilst Richard&#x27;s mother Edith St. John was an older half-sister of the King&#x27;s mother, Margaret Beaufort, making him from a Lancastrian supporting family, he was of a lower status compared to his new wife. It has been argued by historians such as Tracy Borman that this was intended to undermine her status, weaken her claim to the English throne and ensure that she was married to a loyal supporter. Horace Walpole later reflected in his correspondence that &quot;Henry had married her to the insignificant Sir Richard Pole who is called a Welsh Knight&quot;. Nevertheless, the King and Queen attended the marriage ceremony. Historians debate the date of the marriage; it may have taken place in 1487 or 1491. 

After the marriage, Margaret lived at her husband&#x27;s manor of Bockmer, Buckinghamshire and gave birth to five children. She was in attendance at court for important events such as at the Feast of St George in April 1488.

Margaret&#x27;s husband Richard prospered under the Tudor regime and held various offices in Henry VII&#x27;s government. He was appointed as a Knight of the Garter in 1499, and he was entrusted with the prestigious role of Chamberlain for Arthur, Prince of Wales, the heir apparent to the throne. Around the time when Richard was appointed Arthur&#x27;s Chamberlain, Margaret received a generous gift of £20 from Henry VII.

When the Prince of Wales married the Spanish Infanta Catherine of Aragon in 1501, they established an independent household at Ludlow Castle. Margaret was appointed as one of Catherine&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting. Despite a ten year difference in age, she and the Princess became loyal friends. The friendship lasted throughout their whole lives and they exchanged frequent correspondence. Margaret held her position until Catherine&#x27;s entourage was dissolved, after Arthur died on 2 April 1502.

== Widowhood ==
Richard Pole died of an illness in 1505, leaving Margaret a widow with five young children. She borrowed £40 from Henry VII to pay for Pole&#x27;s funeral, with Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester, standing in surety for the loan. She had a small estate of land inherited from her husband but her jointure provided little income or means of supporting herself and her children.

She took lodgings at Syon Abbey, on the banks of the River Thames, along with her daughter Ursula and youngest son Geoffrey, as guests of the Bridgettine nuns. To ease the difficult financial situation, her eldest sons were likely sent to other noble households. She devoted her third son, Reginald Pole, to the Church, relinquishing all financial responsibility for him and sending him to the Carthusian Monastery at Sheen to be educated with the monks of the Charterhouse. Margaret was also supported by monthly payments from the King&#x27;s Mother from May 1505 until May 1509. She remained at Syon Abbey until Henry VIII came to the throne in 1509, and her fortunes improved.

==Countess of Salisbury==
Henry VIII married Catherine of Aragon in 1509, and Margaret was once again appointed as one of Catherine&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting. She attended to the new Queen during the coronation. Her son Henry was also immediately given a place in the King&#x27;s household.

In July 1509, the King granted Margaret an annuity of £100 a year. Then on 4 February 1512, after Margaret&#x27;s petition to the King, her brother&#x27;s attainder was reversed and an Act of Parliament restored the Earldom of Salisbury to her. It included some of her brother&#x27;s former land. Henry VII had controlled these lands while Margaret&#x27;s brother was a minor and then during his imprisonment; he confiscated them after Edward&#x27;s trial. She paid 5,000 marks (the mark had a value of ⅔ of a pound, thus £2,667) for the restoration of her lands, . These terms were generous when compared to the amounts other peers were made to pay for restoration of land. 

Edward&#x27;s Warwick and Spencer [Despencer] estates remained in the hands of the Crown, but Margaret now owned property in Calais, estates in Wales and 17 English counties, and the London palace &quot;Le Herber&quot;. In 1517, Margaret commissioned the building of Warblington Castle, Hampshire, which would become her principal seat. It was built in brick, was sumptuously furnished and had a moat. The King and Queen are known to have visited for extended periods and Henry VIII reportedly enjoyed the hunting there. She had many church livings under her control. She also commissioned a chantry at Christchurch Priory.

As Countess of Salisbury, she played an active role in administering her estates. By 1538 she was the fifth-richest peer in England and ranked among the most powerful tenants in-chief during Henry VIII’s reign. She was a patron of the New Learning, like many Renaissance noblewomen. Gentian Hervet translated Erasmus&#x27; &quot;de immensa misericordia Dei&quot; (&quot;The Great Mercy of God&quot;) into English for her.

Margaret’s lineage was continued through her five children, Henry, Ursula, Arthur, Reginald, and Geoffrey, who all rose to prominence. Her first son, Henry Pole, was created Baron Montagu in 1514, another of the Neville titles in its first creation, speaking for the family on Margaret&#x27;s behalf in the House of Lords. His mother negotiated his marriage to the coheiress Jane Neville, daughter of Lord Bergavenny. 

Her second son, Arthur Pole, had a successful career as a courtier, becoming one of the six Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber and one of the noblemen who accompanied the king&#x27;s sister Mary Tudor to France for her marriage to King Louis XII in 1514. Arthur suffered a setback when his patron Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, was convicted of treason in 1521 but was soon restored to favour. He died young (about 1526), having married Jane Pickering, the heiress of Roger Lewknor. Margaret and her son Henry pressed Arthur&#x27;s widow to take a vow of perpetual chastity to preserve her inheritance for the Pole children. 

Margaret&#x27;s daughter Ursula married Henry Stafford, the only son of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Lady Alianore Percy, in 1519. She was about 15 years old, and he was not yet 18 at the time of the marriage. After the Duke of Buckingham was beheaded for treason and posthumously attainted by an Act of Parliament in 1521, the couple were given only fragments of his estates. Ursula&#x27;s husband was created 1st Baron Stafford by King Henry&#x27;s son and successor, Edward VI in 1547. They had a total of seven sons and seven daughters.

Margaret&#x27;s third son, Reginald Pole, was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, and studied abroad at the University of Padua in Italy, with a £100 stipend from the king. He was Dean of Exeter and Wimborne Minster, Dorset, and a canon of York. He had several other livings, although he had not been ordained a priest. In 1529, he represented Henry VIII in Paris, persuading the theologians of the Sorbonne to support Henry&#x27;s divorce from Catherine of Aragon. He was the last Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury and Primate of All England.

Margaret&#x27;s youngest son, Geoffrey Pole, married Constance, daughter of Edmund Pakenham, and inherited the estate of Lordington in Sussex.

Margaret&#x27;s own favour at Court in these years varied. She received a New Years gift from the King valued at forty shillings, which was equal to the value of gifts given to the Duke&#x27;s of Buckingham and Norfolk. She also had a dispute over land with Henry VIII in 1518 when he awarded contested lands to the Dukedom of Somerset, which had been held by his Beaufort great-grandfather, and was then in the possession of the Crown.

== Governess to Mary Tudor ==
In 1516, Margaret became godmother of the King and Queen&#x27;s daughter Mary and stood sponsor for her confirmation. In 1520 she was also was appointed as Lady governess to Mary, a position of great honour and prestige that solidified her as a powerful force for patronage. In July 1521, when her sons were caught up in the Duke of Buckingham&#x27;s treason conviction, she was dismissed from her appointment. It had been restored to her by 1525, when Margaret was reappointed governess to the Princess at Ludlow Castle in Shropshire. Margaret and the Princess spent the Christmases of 1529 and 1530 at court. During her time as governess, Margaret became like &quot;a second mother&quot; to Mary. 

Margaret was initially amongst a group of high ranking noblewomen who openly opposed the King&#x27;s divorce from Catherine of Aragon. Others were Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk and the King&#x27;s sister; Elizabeth Howard, Duchess of Norfolk; Gertrude Courtenay, Marchioness of Exeter; and Anne Grey, Baroness Hussey. This soured Margaret&#x27;s relationship with Henry.

When Mary was declared illegitimate in 1533, Margaret refused to give Mary&#x27;s gold plate and jewels back to the King. Mary&#x27;s Chamberlain John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford, wrote to Thomas Cromwell that “in no wyse she wyll as yete deliyver to Mistress Frances the jewells for anything that I can say or doo onlesse that yt may please you to obteyne the kings letters unto hyr in that behalf.”

Mary&#x27;s household was broken up at the end of 1533 and Margaret asked if she could serve Mary at her own cost, but this was not permitted. When the Imperial Ambassador, Eustace Chapuys, suggested two years later that Mary be handed over to Margaret, Henry refused, calling Margaret &quot;a fool, of no experience&quot;. She was also unwell for several months during this time, in her sickbed at Bisham. She eventually capitulated and accepted the King&#x27;s annulment, the Act of Supremacy, and the Act of Succession, and her household were instructed to comply.

==Fall==

In 1531, Margaret&#x27;s son Reginald had warned of the risks if Henry should divorce Queen Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn. Chapuys suggested to Emperor Charles V that Reginald should marry Henry VIII&#x27;s daughter Mary and combine their dynastic claims. Chapuys also communicated with Reginald through his brother, Geoffrey.

In June 1536, Reginald definitively broke with the King. He replied to a letter that he had received from Henry VIII with a copy of his own pamphlet, &quot;pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione,&quot; commonly known &quot;as De unitate.&quot; The pamphlet denied both royal supremacy and Henry&#x27;s position on marriage to a brother&#x27;s wife, and referred to him as &quot;a robber, murderer and greater enemy to Christianity than the Turk&quot;. This was a great offence to the King. Reginald also urged the princes of Europe to invade England and depose Henry immediately.

Margaret was summoned to the King&#x27;s presence where he personally informed her of Reginald&#x27;s treasonable actions. She consulted with her son Henry then wrote directly to Reginald, saying that she could not bear the King&#x27;s wrath, strongly reproving him for his &quot;folly&quot;, and advising him to &quot;take another way and serve our master as thy bounden duty is to do unless thou wilt be the confusion of thy mother&quot;. She sent a copy of the letter to the King&#x27;s council and retired from court. After Anne Boleyn was arrested and executed, Margaret was permitted to return to court, albeit briefly, to serve the new Queen Jane Seymour.

In 1537, Reginald was made a Cardinal, despite not being ordained a priest. Pope Paul III put him in charge of organising assistance for the Pilgrimage of Grace. The English government tried to assassinate him. 

Margaret&#x27;s son Geoffrey was arrested in August 1538. He had been corresponding with his brother Reginald and the investigation of Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter and the so-called Exeter Conspiracy implicated him. Under interrogation, Geoffrey&#x27;s nerve broke. He said that Exeter had been party to his correspondence with Reginald and he shared details about Henry, Lord Montagu&#x27;s dislike of the King and his policies. Montagu, Exeter, and Margaret were all arrested in November 1538 as the entire Pole family became implicated in the treason. Margaret wrote of Geoffrey that, &quot;I trow he is not so unhappy that he will hurt his mother, and yet I care neither for him, nor for any other, for I am true to my Prince.&quot;

Margaret was nevertheless accused of abetting her sons and of having “comytted and p[er]petrated div[er]se and sundry other detestable and abominable treasons.” She was interrogated for three days by William FitzWilliam, Earl of Southampton, and Thomas Thirlby, Bishop of Ely, while imprisoned at Cowdray House, Midhurst, West Sussex, which was Fitzwilliam’s home. She defended herself against their accusations, and her interrogators reported to Cromwell that &quot;We assure your lordship we have dealed with such a one as men have not dealed withal tofore [i.e. before] us; we may call her rather a strong and constant man, than a woman. For in all behaviour, howsoever we have used her, she hath showed herself so earnest, vehement, and precise that more could not be.&quot; She also denied receiving any treasonous letters from her sons, with the reports to Cromwell also stating that &quot;..[either] her sons have not made her privy ne participant of the bottom and pit [of] their stomachs, or else is she the [most] arrant traitoress that ever [lived].&quot; Lady Fitzwilliam refused to be in the home while Margaret was there, and Fitzwilliam himself pleaded with Cromwell to remove her from his custody. He wrote to him: &quot;I beg you to rid me of her company, for she is both chargeable and troubles my mind.&quot;

In January 1539, Geoffrey was pardoned, but Montagu and Exeter were executed for treason after trial. The King convinced himself that he had escaped death by a narrow margin and informed Emperor Charles V that for ten years Exeter and Montagu had planned to murder him.

In May 1539, Margaret was attainted, as her father had been. The attainder meant that her titles and lands were forfeit, her Earldom was confiscated and she was demoted her to the title of Lady Margaret Pole. Her estate, including Warblington Castle, was temporarily awarded to Sir Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton and the king&#x27;s personal secretary.

As part of the evidence for the bill of attainder, Cromwell produced an embroidered tunic bearing the Five Wounds of Christ, and heraldic symbols supposedly symbolising Margaret&#x27;s support for the Church of Rome and the rule of her son Reginald with the King&#x27;s Catholic daughter Mary. This had allegedly been found in her coffers at Warblington Castle, Hampshire.

Margaret was sentenced to death, but was held in the Tower of London for two and a half years with her grandson, Henry, and Exeter&#x27;s son. The King paid adequate sums for her maintenance including for wages waiting woman. In March 1541, the King ordered warm gowns and footwear for her to wear. In 1540, Cromwell had also fell from favour and was himself attainted and executed.

== Execution ==
The following poem was found carved on the wall of Margaret&#x27;s cell:
On the morning of 27 May 1541, Margaret was told she would die within the hour. She answered that no crime had been attributed to her. Nevertheless, she was taken from her cell to the precincts of the Tower where a low wooden block had been prepared instead of the customary scaffold.

Two written eyewitness reports survived her execution: one by Charles de Marillac, the French ambassador, and the other by Chapuys, ambassador to the Holy Roman Emperor. The accounts differ somewhat. Marillac&#x27;s report, dispatched two days afterwards, recorded that the execution took place with so few people present that, in the evening, news of her execution was doubted. Chapuys wrote two weeks after the execution that one hundred and fifty witnesses were present for the execution, including the Lord Mayor of London.

Chapuys wrote: &quot;At first, when the sentence of death was made known to her, she found the thing very strange, not knowing of what crime she was accused, nor how she had been sentenced&quot;. Because the chief executioner had been sent north to deal with rebels, the execution was performed by &quot;a wretched and blundering youth who hacked her head and shoulders to pieces in the most pitiful manner&quot;. It took eleven strokes of an axe for the executioner to remove her head. The first blow missed its mark, gashing her shoulder.

A third account in Burke&#x27;s &quot;Peerage&quot; described the appalling circumstances of the execution. It states that Margaret refused to lay her head on the block, declaiming: &quot;So should traitors do, and I am none&quot;. According to the account, she turned her head &quot;every which way&quot;, instructing the executioner that, if he wanted her head, he should take it as he could.

Margaret was buried in the Chapel Royale of St Peter ad Vincula within the Tower of London. Her remains were rediscovered when the chapel was renovated in 1876.

==Descendants==
When not at Court, Margaret lived chiefly at Warblington Castle in Hampshire and Bisham Manor in Berkshire. 

She and her husband were parents to five children:
* Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu (c. 14929 January 1539), notable as one of the peers in the trial of Anne Boleyn. He married Jane Neville, daughter and coheiress of George Nevill, 5th Baron Bergavenny, and Joan Fitzalan, and they had four children. He was beheaded by order of Henry VIII. A great-grandson of Henry Pole was Sir John Bourchier, one of the regicides of Charles I of England, who was a great-great-grandnephew of Henry VIII.
* Arthur Pole (before 1499before 1532), Lord of the Manor of Broadhurst in Sussex. He married Jane Lewkenor, daughter of Sir Roger Lewkenor and Eleanor Tuchet, daughter of the John Tuchet, 6th Baron Audley and Anne Echingham. They had four children.
* Ursula Pole (c. 150212 August 1570), married Henry Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford, and had thirteen children. Her daughter Dorothy Stafford served Queen Elizabeth as Mistress of the Robes, and her son Thomas Stafford was executed for treason against Queen Mary.
* Reginald Pole (c. 150217 November 1558), cardinal, papal legate in various regions, including England, and the last Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury.
* Geoffrey Pole (c. 1504–1558), Lord of the Manor of Lordington in Sussex, suspected of treason by King Henry VIII and accused of conspiring with Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. He lived in exile in Europe and married Constance Pakenham, granddaughter and heiress of Sir John Pakenham. John Pakenham was an ancestor to Sir Edward Pakenham, the brother-in-law to the Duke of Wellington. They had 11 children and Geoffrey&#x27;s eldest son and heir, Arthur Pole, was a conspirator and aspirant to the crown, supported by two of his brothers. He attempted to persuade France and Spain to support his claim, as he was a Catholic and could claim a line of descent from King Edward III free from the &quot;illegitimacy&quot; of Elizabeth I. He was found guilty of treason and was imprisoned in the Beauchamp Tower where he died on 12 August 1570.

== Legacy ==

Her son, Reginald Pole, said that &quot;I am now the son of a martyr whom the King of England has bought to the scaffold although she was seventy years old and his own near relation, for her perseverance in the Catholic faith.&quot; Margaret was later regarded by Catholic Church as a martyr. She was beatified on 29 December 1886 by Pope Leo XIII, and is known in the Roman Catholic Calendar as the Blessed Margaret Pole. 

Panel paintings of Margaret can be found in the following English churches:

* English Martyrs Church, Preston (she is on the right.)
* St Joseph&#x27;s Church in Sale, Cheshire
* St. Marie&#x27;s Church in New Bilton, Rugby, Warwickshire

* Our Lady of Lourdes in Harpenden, Hertfordshire.
* St. Osmund&#x27;s Church in Salisbury, Wiltshire
* St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church in Bridge Gate, Derby, Derbyshire
* Our Lady and the English Martyrs&#x27; church in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire (and another one from the right)
* Shrewsbury Cathedral, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, she is in the fourth window in front of John Fisher.
She is commemorated in the dedication of the Church of Our Lady Queen of Peace &amp; Blessed Margaret Pole in Southbourne, Bournemouth.

<doc id="72249" wikidata="Q89383" url="?curid=72249" title="Otto Skorzeny">
<text>Otto Johann Anton Skorzeny (12 June 1908 – 5 July 1975) was an Austrian-born German SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; (lieutenant colonel) in the Waffen-SS during World War II. During the war, he was involved in a number of operations, including the removal from power of Hungarian Regent Miklós Horthy and the Gran Sasso raid which rescued Benito Mussolini from captivity. Skorzeny led Operation Greif in which German soldiers infiltrated Allied lines wearing their enemies&#x27; uniforms. As a result, he was charged in 1947 at the Dachau Military Tribunal with breaching the 1907 Hague Convention, but was acquitted.

Skorzeny escaped from an internment camp in 1948, hiding out on a Bavarian farm as well as in Salzburg and Paris before eventually settling in Spain. In 1953, he served as a military advisor to the Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. He was allegedly an advisor to Argentinian president Juan Perón. Skorzeny acted as an agent of Mossad, allegedly assisting with the execution of actions such as Operation Diamond. He died of lung cancer on 5 July 1975 in Madrid at the age of 67.

==Early life==
Otto Skorzeny was born in Vienna into a middle-class Austrian family which had a long history of military service. His surname is of Polish origin, and Skorzeny&#x27;s distant ancestors came from Skorzęcin in the Greater Poland region, eventually immigrating to East Prussia.

In addition to his native German, he spoke excellent French and was proficient in English. In his teens, Skorzeny once complained to his father about the austere lifestyle the family was enduring; his father replied, &quot;There is no harm in doing without things. It might even be good for you not to get used to a soft life.&quot;

He was a noted fencer as a member of a German-national Burschenschaft while studying at the Technical University of Vienna. He engaged in fifteen personal combats. The tenth resulted in a wound that left a dramatic duelling scar—known in academic fencing as a &quot;Schmiss&quot; (German for &quot;smite&quot; or &quot;hit&quot;)—on his cheek.

In May 1932, Skorzeny joined the Austrian Nazi organization and soon became a member of the Austrian branch of the Nazi Sturmabteilung (SA) in February 1934. A charismatic figure, Skorzeny played a minor role in the Anschluss on 12 March 1938 when, according to his own account, he saved the Austrian President Wilhelm Miklas from being shot by Austrian Nazis.

==Eastern Front==
After the 1939 Invasion of Poland, Skorzeny, then working as a civil engineer, volunteered for service in the German Air Force (the Luftwaffe), but was turned down because he was considered too tall at and too old (31 years in 1939) for aircrew training. He then joined the Waffen-SS, training with Hitler&#x27;s bodyguard regiment, the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH).

Skorzeny took part in the invasion of the Soviet Union with the SS Division Das Reich and subsequently fought in several battles on the Eastern Front. In October 1941, he was in charge of a &quot;technical section&quot; of German forces during the Battle of Moscow. His mission was to seize important buildings of the Communist Party, including the NKVD headquarters at Lubyanka, and the central telegraph office and other high priority facilities, before they could be destroyed. He was also ordered to capture the sluices of the Moscow-Volga Canal because Hitler wanted to turn Moscow into a huge artificial lake by opening them. The missions were cancelled since German forces had failed to capture the Soviet capital.

In January 1942, Skorzeny was hit in the back of the head by shrapnel; he was evacuated to the rear for treatment. He had previously been awarded the Iron Cross, Second Class while fighting in the Yelnya bridgehead. Recuperating from his injuries he was given a staff role in Berlin, where he developed his ideas on unconventional commando warfare. 

Strategically and tactically, Skorzeny&#x27;s proposals were to develop units specialized in such warfare, including partisan-like fighting deep behind enemy lines, fighting in enemy uniform, sabotage attacks, etc. In April 1943 Skorzeny&#x27;s name was put forward by Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the new head of the RSHA, and Skorzeny met with Walter Schellenberg, head of Amt VI, Ausland-SD (the SS foreign intelligence service department of the RSHA); Schellenberg charged Skorzeny with command of the schools organized to train operatives in sabotage, espionage, and paramilitary techniques. Skorzeny was appointed commander of the recently created &quot;Waffen SS Sonderverband z.b.V. Friedenthal&quot; stationed near Berlin (the unit was later renamed SS Jagdverband 502, and in November 1944 again to SS Combat Unit &quot;Centre&quot;, expanding ultimately to five battalions).

The unit&#x27;s first mission was Operation François in mid-1943. Skorzeny sent a group by parachute into Iran to make contact with the dissident mountain tribes to encourage them to sabotage Allied shipments to the Soviet Union via the Trans-Iranian Railway. However, commitment among the rebel tribes was suspect, and Operation François was deemed a failure.

==Operations by Skorzeny==
* Operation François – Co-ordination of guerrilla operations in Iran.
* Operation Oak (&quot;Unternehmen Eiche&quot;, September 1943) – rescue of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.
* Operation Long Jump – A planned operation to assassinate the &quot;Big Three&quot; (Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt) during the 1943 Tehran Conference. The plot was uncovered before its inception. Skorzeny denied that this operation had ever existed.
* Operation Knight&#x27;s Leap (&quot;Unternehmen Rösselsprung&quot;, May 1944) – An attempt to capture Josip Broz Tito alive.
* Operation Armoured Fist (&quot;Unternehmen Panzerfaust&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Unternehmen Eisenfaust&quot;, October 1944) – kidnapping of Miklós Horthy Jr. to force his father, Admiral Miklós Horthy, to resign as Regent of Hungary in favor of Ferenc Szálasi, the pro-Nazi leader of the Arrow Cross Party.
* Operation Griffin (&quot;Unternehmen Greif&quot;, December 1944) – A false flag operation to spread disinformation during the Battle of the Bulge.
* Werwolf SS – A planned Nazi underground resistance movement in Allied-occupied Europe.

===Liberation of Mussolini===


On the night between 24 and 25 July 1943, a few weeks after the Allied invasion of Sicily and bombing of Rome, the Italian Grand Council of Fascism voted a motion of no confidence (&quot;Ordine del Giorno&quot; Grandi) against Mussolini. On the same day, the king replaced him with Marshal Pietro Badoglio and had him arrested.

Hitler ordered military operations to liberate Mussolini, and, as was his common procedure, he issued similar orders to competing organisations within the German military. So he ordered Skorzeny to track Mussolini, and simultaneously ordered the paratroop General Kurt Student to execute the liberation.

Mussolini was being transported around Italy by his captors (first to Ponza, then to La Maddalena, both small islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea). Intercepting a coded Italian radio message, Skorzeny used the reconnaissance provided by &quot;SS-Obersturmbannführer&quot; Herbert Kappler&#x27;s network of agents and informants (helped with counterfeit British bank notes with a face value of £100,000, forged under Operation Bernhard). It was determined that Mussolini was being imprisoned at Campo Imperatore Hotel, a ski resort at Campo Imperatore in Italy&#x27;s Gran Sasso massif, high in the Apennine Mountains.

On 12 September 1943, Skorzeny and 16 SS troopers joined the &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; to rescue Mussolini in a high-risk glider mission. Ten DFS 230 gliders, each carrying nine soldiers and a pilot, towed by Henschel Hs 126 planes started between 13:05 and 13:10 from the Pratica di Mare Air Base near Rome. The leader of the airborne operation, paratrooper-Oberleutnant Georg Freiherr von Berlepsch, entered the first glider, Skorzeny and his SS troopers sat in the fourth and fifth glider. To gain height before crossing the close by Alban Hills the leading three glider-towing plane units flew an additional loop. All following units considered this manoeuvre unnecessary and preferred not to endanger the given time of arrival at the target. This led to the situation that Skorzeny&#x27;s two units arrived first over the target. Meanwhile, the valley station of the funicular railway leading to the Campo Imperatore was captured at 14:00 in a ground attack by two paratrooper companies led by Major Otto-Harald Mors, who was commander-in-chief of the whole raid. They also cut all telephone lines. At 14:05 the airborne commandos landed their ten DFS 230 gliders on the mountain near the hotel; only one crashed, causing injuries. The &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; and Skorzeny&#x27;s special troopers overwhelmed Mussolini&#x27;s captors (200 well-equipped &quot;Carabinieri&quot; guards) without a single shot being fired; this was also due to the fact that General Fernando Soleti of the &quot;Polizia dell&#x27; Africa Italiana&quot;, who flew in with Skorzeny, told them to stand down. Skorzeny attacked the radio operator and his equipment and stormed into the hotel, being followed by his SS troopers and the paratroopers. Ten minutes after the beginning of the raid, Mussolini left the hotel, accompanied by the German soldiers. At 14:45 Major Mors accessed the Hotel via the funicular railway and introduced himself to Mussolini.

Subsequently, Mussolini was to be flown out by a Fieseler Fi 156 STOL plane. Although under the given circumstances the small plane was overloaded, Skorzeny insisted on accompanying Mussolini, thus endangering the success of the mission. After an extremely dangerous but successful lift-off, they flew to Pratica di Mare. There they continued immediately, flying in a Heinkel He 111 to Vienna, where Mussolini stayed overnight at the Hotel Imperial. The next day he was flown to Munich and on 14 September he met Hitler at the Wolf&#x27;s Lair Führer Headquarters near Rastenburg.

The landing at Campo Imperatore was in fact led by First Lieutenant Georg Freiherr von Berlepsch, commanded by Major Otto-Harald Mors and under orders from General Kurt Student, all &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; (German air force paratroop) officers; but Skorzeny stewarded the Italian leader right in front of the cameras. After a pro-SS propaganda coup at the behest of &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler and propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, Skorzeny and his special forces (&quot;SS-Sonderverband z. b. V. &quot;Friedenthal&quot;&quot;) of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; were granted the majority of the credit for the operation.

===Operation Long Jump===

&quot;Operation Long Jump&quot; was the alleged code name given to a plot to assassinate the &quot;Big Three&quot; (Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill, and Franklin Roosevelt) at the 1943 Tehran Conference. Hitler supposedly gave the command of the operation to Ernst Kaltenbrunner, chief of the RSHA, who, in turn, ceded the mission to Skorzeny. Knowledge of the whole scheme was presented to the Western Allies by Stalin&#x27;s NKVD at the Tehran Conference. The Soviets said they had learned about its existence from counter-espionage activities against German intelligence. Their agents had found out the Nazis knew the time and place of this meeting because they had cracked a US naval code. According to the NKVD, the assassination plot was foiled after they identified the German spies in Iran forcing Skorzeny to call off the mission due to inadequate intelligence.

Following Tehran, the story was treated with incredulity by the British and Americans who dismissed it as Soviet propaganda. Skorzeny supported this view by stating in his post-war memoirs that no such operation ever existed. He said the story about the plans being leaked to Soviet spy Nikolai Kuznetsov by an SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; named Hans Ulrich von Ortel was a Soviet invention; Hans Ulrich von Ortel never existed. Skorzeny claimed his name was used only to add credibility to the story because the NKVD knew his renowned record as an SS commando would make the existence of such an operation more plausible.

===Raid on Drvar===

In early 1944, &quot;Sonderverband z.b.V. Friedenthal&quot; was re-designated SS-Jäger-Bataillon 502 with Skorzeny staying on as commander. They were assigned to &quot;Operation Rösselsprung&quot;, known subsequently as the Raid on Drvar. &quot;Rösselsprung&quot; was a commando operation meant to capture the Yugoslav commander-in-chief, Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had also recently been recognized by the Allies as the Yugoslav prime minister. Marshal Tito led the Yugoslav Partisan resistance army from his headquarters near the Bosnian town of Drvar, in the centre of a large area held by the Partisans.

Hitler knew Tito was receiving Allied support and was aware that either British or American troops might land in Dalmatia along the Adriatic coastline with support from the Partisans. Killing or capturing Tito would not only hinder this, it would give a badly needed boost to the morale of Axis forces engaged in occupied Yugoslavia. Skorzeny was involved in planning &quot;Rösselsprung&quot; and was intended to command it. However, he argued against implementation after he visited Zagreb and discovered that the operation had been compromised through the carelessness of German agents in the Nazi-affiliated Independent State of Croatia in occupied Yugoslav territory.

&quot;Rösselsprung&quot; was put into action nonetheless, but it was a complete disaster. The first wave of paratroopers, following heavy bombardment by the Luftwaffe, jumped between Tito&#x27;s hideout in a cave and the town of Drvar; they landed on open ground and many were promptly shot by members of the Tito Escort Battalion, a unit numbering fewer than a hundred soldiers. The second wave of paratroopers missed their target and landed several miles out of town. Tito was long gone before paratroopers reached the cave; a trail at the back of the cave led to the railway tracks where Tito boarded a train that took him safely to Jajce. In the meantime, the Partisan 1st Brigade, from the 6th &quot;Lika&quot; Partisan Division, arrived after a twelve-mile (nineteen-kilometre) forced march and attacked the Waffen-SS paratroopers, inflicting heavy casualties.

===Hungary and Operation Panzerfaust===

In October 1944, Hitler sent Skorzeny to Hungary after receiving word that the Regent of Hungary, Admiral Miklós Horthy, was secretly negotiating with the Red Army. The surrender of Hungary would have cut off the million German troops still fighting in the Balkans.

Skorzeny, in a daring &quot;snatch&quot; codenamed Operation Panzerfaust (known as &quot;Operation Eisenfaust&quot; in Germany), kidnapped Horthy&#x27;s son Miklós Horthy Jr. and forced his father to resign as head of state. A pro-Nazi government under dictator Ferenc Szálasi was then installed in Hungary. In April 1945, after German and Hungarian forces were driven out of Hungary, Szálasi and his Arrow Cross Party-based forces continued the fight in Austria and Slovakia. The success of the operation earned Skorzeny promotion to Obersturmbannführer.

===Operation Greif and the German defeat===

As part of the German Ardennes offensive in late 1944 (Battle of the Bulge), Skorzeny&#x27;s English-speaking troops were charged with infiltrating American lines disguised in American uniforms in order to produce confusion to support the German attack. For the campaign, Skorzeny was the commander of a composite unit, the 150th SS Panzer Brigade. As planned by Skorzeny, Operation Greif involved about two dozen German soldiers, most of them in captured American Jeeps and disguised in American uniforms, who would penetrate American lines in the early hours of the Battle of the Bulge to cause disorder and confusion. Skorzeny was well aware that under the Hague Convention of 1907, any of his men captured while wearing American uniforms would be executed as spies and this possibility caused much discussion with Generaloberst Alfred Jodl and Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt.

A handful of his men were captured and spread a rumour that Skorzeny personally was leading a raid on Paris to kill or capture General Eisenhower, who was not amused by having to spend Christmas 1944 isolated for security reasons. Eisenhower retaliated by ordering an all-out manhunt for Skorzeny, with &quot;Wanted&quot; posters distributed throughout Allied-controlled territories featuring a detailed description and a photograph. In all, twenty-three of Skorzeny&#x27;s men were captured behind American lines and sixteen were executed as spies for contravening the rules of war by wearing enemy uniforms.

Skorzeny spent February 1945 as an acting major general commanding about 5,000 troops, only some of which were his SS commandos and paratroopers, during the defense of the Schwedt Bridgehead on the River Oder. On 17 March, he received orders to sabotage the last remaining intact bridge across the Rhine at Remagen following its capture by the Allies, but the bridge collapsed that same day, and the naval demolitions squad that had been preparing its destruction instead unsuccessfully attacked a nearby Allied pontoon bridge between Kripp and Linz. Hitler awarded him one of Germany&#x27;s highest military honours, the Oak Leaves to the Knight&#x27;s Cross.

==Postwar==
===Dachau trials===
Skorzeny was interned for two years before being tried as a war criminal at the Dachau trials in 1947 for allegedly violating the laws of war during the Battle of the Bulge. He and nine officers of the Panzerbrigade 150 were tried before an American military tribunal in Dachau on 18 August 1947. They faced charges of improper use of American military insignia, theft of American uniforms, and theft of Red Cross parcels from American POWs. The trial lasted over three weeks. The charge of stealing Red Cross parcels was dropped for lack of evidence. Skorzeny admitted to ordering his men to wear American uniforms, but his defence argued that as long as enemy uniforms were discarded before combat started, such a tactic was a legitimate &quot;ruse de guerre&quot;.

On the final day of the trial, 9 September, F. F. E. Yeo-Thomas, a former British SOE agent, testified in defence of Skorzeny and his operatives wearing American uniforms behind enemy lines, claiming that the Western Allies had actively contemplated carrying out exactly the same kind of &quot;false flag&quot; operations; the Tribunal subsequently acquitted the ten defendants. The Tribunal drew a distinction between using enemy uniforms during combat and for other purposes including deception and were unable to prove that Skorzeny had given any orders to actually fight in American uniforms.

=== Escape from prison ===
Skorzeny was detained in an internment camp at Darmstadt awaiting the decision of a denazification court. On 27 July 1948, he escaped from the camp with the help of three former SS officers dressed in American military police uniforms who entered the camp and claimed that they had been ordered to take Skorzeny to Nuremberg for a legal hearing. Skorzeny afterwards maintained that American authorities had aided his escape and had supplied the uniforms.

Skorzeny hid out at a farm in Bavaria which had been rented by Countess Ilse Lüthje, the niece of Hjalmar Schacht (Hitler&#x27;s former finance minister), for around 18 months, during which time he was in contact with Reinhard Gehlen, and together with Hartmann Lauterbacher (former deputy head of the Hitler Youth) recruited for the Gehlen Organization. Skorzeny was photographed at a café on the Champs Elysées in Paris on 13 February 1950. The photo appeared in the French press the next day, causing him to move to Salzburg, where he met up with German veterans and also filed for divorce so that he could marry Lüthje.

Shortly afterwards, with the help of a Nansen passport issued by the Spanish government, he moved to Madrid, where he set up a small engineering business. In April 1950, the publication of Skorzeny&#x27;s memoirs by the French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; caused 1,500 communists to riot outside the journal&#x27;s headquarters.

=== Military advisor ===
In 1952, when Egypt was taken over by General Mohammed Naguib, Skorzeny was sent to Egypt the following year by former General Reinhard Gehlen (who was now working indirectly for the CIA) to act as Naguib&#x27;s military adviser. Skorzeny recruited a staff made up of former SS and Wehrmacht officers to train the Egyptian army. Among these officers were former Wehrmacht generals Wilhelm Fahrmbacher and Oskar Munzel; the head of the Gestapo Department for Jewish Affairs in occupied Poland Leopold Gleim; and Joachim Daemling, former chief of the Gestapo in Düsseldorf. In addition to training the army, Skorzeny also trained Arab volunteers in commando tactics for possible use against British troops stationed in the Suez Canal zone. Several Palestinian refugees also received commando training, and Skorzeny planned their raids into Israel via the Gaza Strip in 1953–1954. One of these Palestinians was Yasser Arafat. He stayed on to serve as an adviser to Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.

According to some authors, he traveled between Spain and Argentina, where he acted as an advisor to President Juan Perón and as a bodyguard for Eva Perón, while fostering an ambition for the &quot;Fourth Reich&quot; to be centred in Latin America.

=== Recruitment by Mossad ===
The Israeli security and intelligence magazine &quot;Matara&quot; published an article in 1989 claiming that Skorzeny had been recruited by Mossad in 1963 to obtain information on German scientists who were working on an Egyptian project to develop rockets to be used against Israel. Reporting on the &quot;Matara&quot; story, the major Israeli daily &quot;Yedioth Ahronot&quot; said that it had confirmed the story from their own senior Mossad source. Former Mossad head Isser Harel confirmed the story that former Nazis were recruited to provide intelligence on Arab countries.

Ian Black and Benny Morris wrote in 1991 that Skorzeny may not have known for whom he was working, but in 2010, Tom Segev published in his biography of Simon Wiesenthal that Skorzeny had offered to help only if Wiesenthal removed him from his list of wanted war criminals. Wiesenthal refused, but Skorzeny finally agreed to help anyway. Segev gave as his main source the senior Mossad agent Rafi Meidan to whom Segev attributes the primary role in the recruitment of Skorzeny.

Further details of the story were published by Yossi Melman and Dan Raviv in 2016. According to their information, a Mossad team had started to develop a plan to kill Skorzeny, but chief Isser Harel decided to attempt to recruit him instead, as a man on the inside would greatly enhance their ability to target Nazis who were providing military assistance to Egypt. He allegedly was recruited and conducted operations for Mossad from 1964, working with Avraham Ahituv and Rafi Eitan.

Other unnamed sources asserted that Skorzeny was recruited after Mossad visited his home in Spain, where he expected that he would be assassinated. After undergoing instruction and training in Mossad&#x27;s facilities in Israel, the rumoured work for Mossad included assassinating German rocket scientist Heinz Krug who was working for the Egyptian government and posting a letter bomb which killed five Egyptians at the Egyptian military rocket site &quot;Factory 333&quot;. He also allegedly supplied the names and addresses of German scientists working for Egypt and the names of European front companies supplying military hardware to Egypt.

No confirmed source can explain Skorzeny&#x27;s motives for working with Israel, but he may have craved adventure and intrigue and feared assassination by Mossad. An article featured in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; on 22 January 2018 raised doubts as to the involvement of Skorzeny in Krug&#x27;s death, stating that Mossad boss Isser Harel ordered the murder.

===Other activities===
Like thousands of other former Nazis, Skorzeny was declared (denazified) &quot;in absentia&quot; in 1952 by a West German government arbitration board, which meant that he could now travel from Spain into other Western countries, on a special Nansen passport for stateless persons with which he visited Ireland in 1957 and 1958. In late 1958, he qualified for an Austrian passport and in 1959, he purchased Martinstown House (), a farm near The Curragh in County Kildare, Ireland. Although Skorzeny could not be refused entry without due cause, he was refused a residency visa by the Irish government and had to limit his stays to six weeks at a time, and he was monitored by G2. He rarely visited after 1963 and sold Martinstown House in 1971. At 6 ft 4 in (193 cm) and weighing , along with his scar, he was easily recognizable and caused speculation among the English and Irish press as to why he was in Ireland. One Kildare resident recalled Skorzeny as someone who &quot;wasn&#x27;t particularly friendly and [who] didn&#x27;t really mix with local people&quot;. Skorzeny also owned property on Majorca.

In the 1960s, Skorzeny set up the Paladin Group, which he envisioned as &quot;an international directorship of strategic assault personnel [that would] straddle the watershed between paramilitary operations carried out by troops in uniform and the political warfare which is conducted by civilian agents&quot;. Based near Alicante, Spain, the Paladin Group specialized in arming and training guerrillas. Some of its operatives were recruited by the Spanish Interior Ministry to wage a clandestine war against the terrorist group ETA. Skorzeny was a founder and an advisor to the leadership of the Spanish neo-Nazi group CEDADE, established in 1966.

On Feb 24, 1975, as he left the studios of French television in Paris, he was whipped by a former officer of the French Army, who was unarmed but threatened to kill him on the spot. The killing was prevented, however, by French police. The story appeared on Le Monde two days later. (https://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1975/02/26/l-ancien-colonel-ss-cravache-par-un-ancien-deporte_2599221_1819218.html)

It was rumoured that under the cover names Robert Steinbacher and Otto Steinbauer and supported by either Nazi funds or (according to some sources) by Austrian intelligence, Skorzeny set up a secret organization named Die Spinne (English: &quot;The Spider&quot;), which helped as many as 600 former SS men escape from Germany to Spain, Argentina, and from there to other countries.

==Death==
In 1970, a cancerous tumour was discovered on Skorzeny&#x27;s spine. Two tumours were later removed while he was staying at a hospital in Hamburg, leaving him temporarily paralyzed. Skorzeny died of lung cancer on 5 July 1975 in Madrid. He was 67 years old. Skorzeny never denounced Nazism.

He was given a Catholic funeral in Madrid on 7 August 1975. His body was then cremated and his ashes were later taken to Vienna to be interred in the Skorzeny family plot at Döblinger Friedhof. His funerals in Madrid and Vienna were attended by former SS colleagues who gave the Hitler salute, and also sang some of Hitler&#x27;s favourite songs.

==In fiction==
Like many other prominent World War II figures, Skorzeny has been portrayed in several works of fiction, such as the &quot;Worldwar tetralogy&quot; by Harry Turtledove and &quot;1945&quot; by Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen. In &quot;The Eagle has Landed&quot; by Jack Higgins, Skorzeny&#x27;s rescue of Mussolini inspires a plan to kidnap Winston Churchill.

Skorzeny was portrayed in the television drama series &quot;&quot; and &quot;Mussolini and I&quot;, and the drama film &quot;Walking with the Enemy&quot; (2014). The Spanish drama-series &quot;Jaguar&quot; is inspired by Skorzeny.

<doc id="72255" wikidata="Q380513" url="?curid=72255" title="Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley">
<text>Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley, KG, PC (20 March 1549) was a brother of Jane Seymour, the third wife of King Henry VIII. With his brother, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector of England, he vied for control of their nephew, the young King Edward VI (). In 1547, Seymour married Catherine Parr, the widow of Henry VIII. During his marriage to Catherine, Seymour involved the future Queen Elizabeth I (then 14 years old), who resided in his household, in flirtatious and possibly sexual behaviour.

==Family and royal connections==
Thomas Seymour was the son of Sir John Seymour and Margaret Wentworth. He was the fourth of their six sons; his elder brother Edward (1500–1552) would become 1st Duke of Somerset. He grew up at Wulfhall, the Seymour family home in Wiltshire. The Seymours were a family of country gentry, who, like most holders of manorial rights, traced their ancestry to a Norman origin.

Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn, did not have a son although Henry hoped for a male heir. His interests turned elsewhere, to Seymour&#x27;s sister Jane, one of Anne&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting. Henry married Jane eleven days after Anne&#x27;s execution in May 1536, and the Seymour brothers saw their fortunes rise: in that year, Thomas became a gentleman of the privy chamber.

In October of the following year, Queen Jane gave birth to a son, Edward Tudor, who would become King Edward VI. Her two brothers, Edward and Thomas, were, therefore, uncles to the baby Edward, heir to the throne. Less than two weeks later, Jane died from complications related to childbirth.

Thomas Seymour&#x27;s other royal connection was with Catherine Parr, Henry VIII&#x27;s sixth wife, whom Seymour would later marry, after Henry&#x27;s death. In 1543, Parr established herself as part of Princess Mary&#x27;s household, where she caught the attention of the King. Although she had already begun a romantic relationship with Seymour, she saw it as her duty to accept Henry&#x27;s proposal.

==Foreign affairs==
In 1538, Seymour was sent to the embassy at the French court. He was one of those appointed to meet Anne of Cleves, King Henry&#x27;s fourth wife, at Calais on 13 December 1539. A few weeks later he was sent to King Ferdinand I of Hungary, brother of Emperor Charles V, to enlist support for Henry against France and Scotland. In May 1543, he was appointed ambassador to the Habsburg court in Brussels. He was given this posting to remove him from King Henry&#x27;s court, in view of the King&#x27;s marriage to Catherine Parr.

When war broke out between England and France, Seymour was made marshal of the English army in the Netherlands on 26 June 1543, being second in command to Sir John Wallop. On 24 July, with a strong detachment, he captured and destroyed the castles of Rinquecen and Arbrittayne near the French port of Boulogne. For a short time, he held the chief command during Wallop&#x27;s illness. Due to his position of privilege as a royal uncle and as a reward for his services, Seymour was made Master-General of the Ordnance in 1544 and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1545, both senior military positions.

==Regency Council and marriage to Catherine Parr==

Seymour returned to court just before Henry VIII died in January 1547, leaving Catherine one of the wealthiest women in England. According to the King&#x27;s will, a regency council was constituted to rule on behalf of the nine-year-old orphaned King Edward. Thomas Seymour became 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley, and his older brother Edward became Duke of Somerset, and is often, therefore, referred to as &quot;Somerset&quot;. In addition, Thomas Seymour saw his brother rise, amid the contentious and dangerous politics of the English Reformation, to the position of chief councillor with an approved title of &quot;Protector&quot; regent, referred to unofficially as Lord Protector of England, in effect, ruler of the realm as regent for his nephew, the king. Thomas began to resent his brother and the relationship between them began to dissolve. Although Thomas was named Lord High Admiral as a concession, he was consumed by jealousy of his brother&#x27;s power and influence and worked to unseat and replace his brother as Lord Protector.

Thomas Seymour sought to overturn his brother&#x27;s position on the regency council by his personal influence over the young king, and also possibly by making a royal marriage. Although his name had been linked to Mary Howard, Duchess of Richmond, he was still unmarried at the time of Henry VIII&#x27;s death. He had previously shown some interest in marrying either of Henry&#x27;s daughters, Elizabeth or Mary; however, within weeks of Henry&#x27;s death, Thomas Seymour had rekindled the affair with Catherine Parr, and they were secretly married in April or May 1547, too soon after the king&#x27;s death to suit many. Anne Stanhope, Somerset&#x27;s proud wife, disliked Catherine and Thomas and began to turn many people in court against them.

==Relationship with Elizabeth==

Upon their marriage, Seymour moved into his wife&#x27;s house, at Chelsea Manor in London, where she lived with her step-daughter, the 14-year-old Elizabeth. Seymour was the uncle of Elizabeth&#x27;s half-brother, and the newly-wed husband of her stepmother. Now, living under the same roof as Elizabeth, Thomas Seymour began to show affection toward Elizabeth, tickling her, and slapping her on her behind as she lay in her bed, or coming into her room in his nightclothes. Her governess, Kat Ashley, thought this scandalous, and reported it to Catherine. Indignant, Seymour retorted, &quot;By God&#x27;s precious soul, I mean no evil, and I will not leave it!&quot; At first, Catherine dismissed the behaviour as innocent fun, and even joined in the behaviour on a few occasions. Elizabeth&#x27;s feelings regarding this behaviour are unknown, but it was said that she bore Thomas some degree of affection; and though her governess &quot;bade him go away in shame,&quot; she found him more amusing than dangerous. Given Elizabeth&#x27;s relatively young age, the fact she was Catherine&#x27;s step-daughter and also second in the line of succession of the English throne plus Seymour was married to the dowager queen, his behaviour was considered to be highly inappropriate, shocking, and immoral. When Catherine was pregnant in the spring of 1548, she had become concerned enough about her husband&#x27;s flirtatious relationship with Elizabeth that she sent Elizabeth away to live with Anthony Denny and his wife, Joan Champernowne (Kat Ashley&#x27;s sister), in Hertfordshire.


In June 1548, Catherine and Thomas Seymour moved their household from London to Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire, the property granted to Seymour when he became Baron Seymour of Sudeley. In September 1548, Catherine gave birth to a daughter, Mary Seymour. In the following days, she became uncharacteristically hostile and delusional. Thomas lay in bed with her to quiet her, but she did not get better, and died of childbirth complications, just before Elizabeth&#x27;s 15th birthday. Upon her death, Catherine bequeathed all of her possessions to Thomas, making him one of the wealthiest men in England. He said he was &quot;amazed&quot; at her death; yet it opened up new opportunities for him, as his eye returned to Elizabeth. She avoided him, returning with her governess to her childhood home, Hatfield House in Hertfordshire.

==Relationship with Edward VI==

Despite his great wealth and high position, Thomas Seymour could not come to terms with his brother&#x27;s appointment as protector; and in his struggle with Somerset, he tried to ingratiate himself with the king, who was merely a child. He sought the 9-year-old Edward to write a letter on his behalf in support of his marriage to the dowager queen, Catherine Parr. The letter was obviously dictated by Thomas for Edward&#x27;s signature and only enraged Somerset. He began to visit Edward frequently, secretly giving him an extravagant allowance of coins, so that Edward might be satisfied in feeling more grown-up and more king-like, giving gifts to his servants, teachers, and friends. Even though he lived in sumptuous splendour and wanting for nothing, no provisions had been made for Edward&#x27;s pocket money; he became accustomed to these regular payments and began to ask Seymour freely for his allowance.

Thomas continued his manipulation of the king. In trying to get a bill through Parliament making him Edward&#x27;s personal governor, Seymour requested Edward&#x27;s royal signature on the bill. But Edward was uncertain and reluctant to go behind the back of the protector, Somerset, and of the regency council, and he would not sign it. Seymour persistently pressured Edward, until Edward felt threatened. But Seymour did not give up. He tried to persuade Edward that he did not need a protector, getting Edward to admit that it might be better for Somerset to die. It is not known what the king meant by this, but it was probably uttered innocently. Seymour intended that the king&#x27;s royal signature and personal support would destabilize Somerset&#x27;s position as protector, and as a member of the regency council. In his frustration and inability to gain any significant influence over the king, Thomas Seymour began to think in terms of open rebellion.

==Downfall==
In the summer of 1547, Somerset invaded Scotland. During his absence from the court, his brother, Thomas, fomented opposition to his authority, voicing open disapproval of his brother&#x27;s administrative skills. Because his activities seemed suspicious, several members of the nobility advised him to be content with his position, but he would not listen. As Lord High Admiral, he was able to control the English navy, and he openly asked for support in case of a rebellion. Although it was his duty to suppress piracy, he entered into relations with pirates on the western coasts, with a view to securing their support. Thomas seems also to have hoped to finance a rebellion through crooked dealings with the vice-treasurer of the Bristol Mint, Sir William Sharington.
By 1548, the regency council was becoming aware of Thomas&#x27;s bid for power. Somerset tried to save his brother from ruin, calling a council meeting so that Thomas might explain himself. However, Thomas did not appear. On the night of 16 January 1549, for reasons that are not clear (perhaps to take the young king away in his own custody), Seymour was caught trying to break into the King&#x27;s apartments at Hampton Court Palace. He entered the privy garden and woke one of the King&#x27;s pet spaniels. In response to the dog&#x27;s barking, he shot and killed it. The next day, he was arrested and sent to the Tower of London. The incident, being caught outside the king&#x27;s bedroom, at night, with a loaded pistol, was interpreted in the most menacing light, even casting suspicion on Elizabeth&#x27;s involvement with Thomas. On 18 January, the council sent agents to question everyone associated with Thomas, including Elizabeth. On 22 February, the council officially accused him of thirty-three charges of treason. He was attainted of treason, condemned to death and executed on 20 March 1549. Catherine&#x27;s brother William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton, inherited Sudeley Castle.
Seymour was a &quot;trusty friend&quot; of Sir Rowland Hill, who would publish the Geneva Bible, and was given land at Hoxten for life under his will. It was said that Hill &quot;knew much of the intent and purpose&quot; of Sir Thomas Seymour.

==Aftermath==
When he was arrested for treason, Seymour&#x27;s associates were also cast under suspicion, including 15-year-old Elizabeth. She did not realize her own danger until her servants, including her governess Kat Ashley, were also arrested. Upon realizing that Thomas would probably be executed, she was noticeably disconsolate, trying to free herself and her servants from suspicion. The regency council was sure of her complicity with Thomas and she was interrogated for weeks. But the council found itself in a sharply defined game of wits with Elizabeth, who proved to be a master of logic, defiance, and shrewdness. The embarrassing details of Seymour&#x27;s improper behaviour towards her came to light but there was no evidence that Elizabeth had conspired with him.

After his execution, all of Seymour&#x27;s property was seized by the Crown. His attainder was reversed by Parliament in 1550, although the property was not returned to Mary Seymour, his only child; she is believed to have died at about the age of two, possibly while in the care of Katherine Brandon, Duchess of Suffolk.

To his contemporaries, he appeared forceful and reckless, and also attractive to women. Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, a boyhood friend of King Edward, described Thomas Seymour as &quot;hardy, wise and liberal ... fierce in courage, courtly in fashion, in personage stately, in voice magnificent, but somewhat empty of matter&quot;.

==In popular culture==

=== Film ===

* In the 1953 film &quot;Young Bess&quot; (based on the novel of the same title by Margaret Irwin), Stewart Granger was cast as Seymour. The plot, largely a romance between him and Princess Elizabeth (played by 24-year-old Jean Simmons), had little historical accuracy.
*In the 2023 film &quot;Firebrand&quot;, Sam Riley portrayed Thomas Seymour.

=== Television ===

* In the 1970 television series &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; and the 1971 television series &quot;Elizabeth R&quot;, John Ronane portrays Seymour.
* In the 2007 television show &quot;The Tudors&quot;, Andrew McNair portrays Seymour. He appears in series three and four.
* In the 2022 series &quot;Becoming Elizabeth&quot;, Tom Cullen plays Seymour.
* Dominic Cooper portrayed Seymour in the 2024 series My Lady Jane.

=== Literature ===

* He is a character in the C. J. Sansom novel Revelation, featuring Sansom&#x27;s fictional lawyer/detective Matthew Shardlake. He is portrayed as a hot-headed military man, with designs on Catherine Parr, in the months before the latter&#x27;s marriage to Henry VIII. He reappears as a secondary character in the next two novels in the series, Heartstone and Lamentation.

* Norah Lofts, in her biography of Walter Raleigh &quot;Here Was a Man&quot;, suggests that Elizabeth was attracted to Raleigh because he reminded her of Seymour.

<text>Sir Henry Percy (20 May 1364 – 21 July 1403), nicknamed Hotspur or Harry Hotspur, was an English knight who fought in several campaigns against the Scots in the northern border and against the French during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The nickname &quot;Hotspur&quot; was given to him by the Scots as a tribute to his speed in advance and readiness to attack. The heir to a leading noble family in northern England, Hotspur was one of the earliest and prime movers behind the deposition of King Richard II in favour of Henry Bolingbroke in 1399. He later fell out with the new regime and rebelled, and was slain at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403 at the height of his fame.

== Career ==

Henry Percy was born 20 May 1364 at either Alnwick Castle or Warkworth Castle in Northumberland, the eldest son of Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, and Margaret Neville, daughter of Ralph de Neville, 2nd Lord Neville of Raby, and Alice de Audley. He was knighted by King Edward III in April 1377, together with the future kings Richard II and Henry IV. In 1380, he was in Ireland with the Earl of March, and in 1383, he travelled in Prussia. He was appointed Warden of the East March either on 30 July 1384 or in May 1385, and in 1385 accompanied Richard II on an expedition into Scotland. &quot;As a tribute to his speed in advance and readiness to attack&quot; on the Scottish borders, the Scots bestowed on him the name &#x27;Haatspore&#x27;. In April 1386, he was sent to France to reinforce the garrison at Calais and led raids into Picardy. Between August and October 1387, he was in command of a naval force in an attempt to relieve the siege of Brest. In appreciation of these military endeavours, at the age of 24 he was made a Knight of the Garter in 1388. Reappointed as Warden of the East March, he commanded the English forces against James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Douglas, at the Battle of Otterburn on 10 August 1388, where he was captured, but soon ransomed for 7000 marks.

During the next few years Percy&#x27;s reputation continued to grow. Although not 30, he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Cyprus in June 1393 and appointed Lieutenant of the Duchy of Aquitaine (1394–98) on behalf of John of Gaunt, Duke of Aquitaine. He returned to England in January 1395, taking part in Richard II&#x27;s expedition to Ireland, and was back in Aquitaine the following autumn. In the summer of 1396, he was again in Calais.

Percy&#x27;s military and diplomatic service brought him substantial marks of royal favour in the form of grants and appointments, but despite this, the Percy family decided to support Henry Bolingbroke, the future Henry IV, in his rebellion against Richard II. On Henry&#x27;s return from exile in June 1399, Percy and his father joined his forces at Doncaster and marched south with them. After King Richard&#x27;s deposition, Percy and his father were &quot;lavishly rewarded&quot; with lands and offices.

Under the new king, Percy had extensive civil and military responsibility in both the East March towards Wales, where he was appointed High Sheriff of Flintshire in 1399, and in the north toward Scotland. In north Wales, he was under increasing pressure as a result of the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr. In March 1402, Henry IV appointed Percy royal lieutenant in north Wales, and on 14 September 1402, Percy, his father, and the Earl of Dunbar and March defeated a Scottish force at the Battle of Homildon Hill. Among others, they made a prisoner of Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas.

== Rebellion, death and exhumation ==
In spite of the favour that Henry IV showed the Percys in many respects, they became increasingly discontented with him. Among their grievances were:
* The king&#x27;s failure to pay the wages due them for defending the Scottish border
* The king&#x27;s favour towards Dunbar
* The king&#x27;s demand that the Percys hand over their Scottish prisoners
* The king&#x27;s failure to put an end to Owain Glyndŵr&#x27;s rebellion through a negotiated settlement
* The king&#x27;s increasing promotion of his son&#x27;s (Prince Henry) military authority in Wales
* The king&#x27;s failure to ransom Henry Percy&#x27;s brother-in-law, Sir Edmund Mortimer, whom the Welsh had captured in June 1402

Spurred by these grievances, the Percys rebelled in the summer of 1403 and took up arms against the king. According to J. M. W. Bean, it is clear that the Percys were in collusion with Glyndŵr. On his return to England shortly after the victory at Homildon Hill, Henry Percy issued proclamations in Cheshire accusing the king of &#x27;tyrannical government&#x27;.

Joined by his uncle, Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester, Percy marched to Shrewsbury, where he intended to do battle against a force there under the command of the Prince of Wales. The army of his father, however, was slow to move south, and it was without the assistance of his father that Henry Percy and Worcester arrived at Shrewsbury on 21 July 1403, where they encountered the king with a large army. The ensuing Battle of Shrewsbury was fierce, with heavy casualties on both sides but, when Henry Percy himself was struck down and killed, his own forces fled.

The circumstances of Percy&#x27;s death differ in accounts. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham stated in his &quot;Historia Anglicana&quot; that &quot;while he led his men in the fight rashly penetrating the enemy host, [Hotspur] was unexpectedly cut down, by whose hand is not known&quot;. Another account states that Percy was struck in the face by an arrow when he opened his visor for a better view. This is the view taken by Alnwick Castle, home of Hotspur&#x27;s descendants and place where a statue of him is exhibited. The legend that he was killed by the Prince of Wales seems to have been given currency by William Shakespeare, writing at the end of the following century. The Earl of Worcester was executed two days later.

King Henry, upon being brought Percy&#x27;s body after the battle, is said to have wept. The body was taken by Thomas Neville, 5th Baron Furnivall, to Whitchurch, Shropshire, for burial. However, when rumours circulated that Percy was still alive, the king &quot;had the corpse exhumed and displayed it, propped upright between two millstones, in the market place at Shrewsbury&quot;. That being done, Percy was subjected to posthumous execution. The king dispatched Percy&#x27;s head to York, where it was impaled on the Micklegate Bar (one of the city&#x27;s gates). His four-quarters were separately displayed in London, Newcastle upon Tyne, Bristol, and Chester before they were finally delivered to his widow. She had the body buried in York Minster in November of that year. In January 1404, Percy was posthumously attainted, declared guilty of high treason, and his titles and lands were declared forfeit to the Crown.

== Marriage and issue ==
Henry Percy married Elizabeth Mortimer, the eldest daughter of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March, and his wife, Philippa, the only child of Lionel, 1st Duke of Clarence, and Elizabeth de Burgh, Countess of Ulster. By her he had two children:


Sometime after 3 June 1406, Elizabeth Mortimer married, as her second husband, Thomas de Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys, by whom she had a son, Sir Roger Camoys. Thomas Camoys distinguished himself as a soldier in command of the rearguard of the English army at the Battle of Agincourt on 25 October 1415.

== Legacy ==

Henry Percy, &#x27;Hotspur&#x27;, is one of Shakespeare&#x27;s best-known characters. In &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, Percy is portrayed as the same age as his rival, Prince Hal, by whom he is slain in single combat. In fact, he was 23 years older than Prince Hal, the future King Henry V, who was a youth of 16 at the date of the Battle of Shrewsbury.

One of England&#x27;s football clubs, Tottenham Hotspur, is named after Hotspur, who lived in the region and whose descendants owned land in the neighbourhood of the club&#x27;s first ground in the Tottenham Marshes. He was also well known for having a highly favoured enjoyment of watching cockfighting, hence the club&#x27;s badge symbol.

A statue of Henry Percy was unveiled in Alnwick by the Duke of Northumberland in 2010.

The protagonist of the video game &quot;Shadows of the Damned&quot; is named Garcia Hotspur.

Tom Glynn-Carney portrayed Hotspur in &quot;The King&quot; (2019).

Joe Armstrong portrayed Hotspur in &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot; (2013).

Sean Connery portrayed Hotspur with Robert Hardy as Prince Hal. The 1960 production was part of a BBC series &quot;An Age of Kings&quot;, a synthesis of Shakespeare&#x27;s histories, with the episodes (3 &amp; 4) featuring Hotspur first broadcast in summer 1960.

<text>The family Scarabaeidae, as currently defined, consists of over 35,000 species of beetles worldwide; they are often called scarabs or scarab beetles. The classification of this family has undergone significant change. Several groups formerly treated as subfamilies have been elevated to family rank (e.g., Bolboceratidae, Geotrupidae, Glaresidae, Glaphyridae, Hybosoridae, Ochodaeidae, and Pleocomidae), and some reduced to lower ranks. The subfamilies listed in this article are in accordance with those in Catalog of Life (2023).

== Description ==
Scarabs are stout-bodied beetles, many with bright metallic colours, measuring between . They have distinctive, clubbed antennae composed of plates called lamellae that can be compressed into a ball or fanned out like leaves to sense odours. Many species are fossorial, with legs adapted for digging. In some groups males (and sometimes females) have prominent horns on the head and/or pronotum to fight over mates or resources. The largest fossil scarabaeid was &quot;Oryctoantiquus borealis&quot; with a length of . 

The C-shaped larvae, called grubs, are pale yellow or white. Most adult beetles are nocturnal, although the flower chafers (Cetoniinae) and many leaf chafers (Rutelinae) are active during the day. The grubs mostly live underground or under debris, so are not exposed to sunlight. Many scarabs are scavengers that recycle dung, carrion, or decaying plant material. Others, such as the Japanese beetle, are plant-eaters, wreaking havoc on various crops and vegetation.

Some of the well-known beetles from the Scarabaeidae are Japanese beetles, dung beetles, June beetles, rose chafers (Australian, European, and North American), rhinoceros beetles, Hercules beetles and Goliath beetles.

Several members of this family have structurally coloured shells which act as left-handed circular polarisers; this was the first-discovered example of circular polarization in nature.

== Ancient Egypt ==
In Ancient Egypt, the dung beetle now known as &quot;Scarabaeus sacer&quot; (formerly &quot;Ateuchus sacer&quot;) was revered as sacred. Egyptian amulets representing the sacred scarab beetles were traded throughout the Mediterranean world.

<text>The Háttatal (Old Norse: &#x27;Tally of Metres&#x27;; c. 20,000 words; Old Norse: , Modern Icelandic: ) is the last section of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; composed by the Icelandic poet, politician, and historian Snorri Sturluson. Using, for the most part, his own compositions, it exemplifies the types of verse forms used in Old Norse poetry. Snorri took a prescriptive as well as descriptive approach; he has systematized the material, and often notes that &quot;the older poets did not always&quot; follow his rules.

Most of the forms depend on number of syllables per line, as well as assonance, consonance, and alliteration. Although end rhyme is represented, it does not function in the ways most modern English speakers expect (forms include AAAAAAAA, and AAAABBBB), and plays a very minor role. Understanding this work will be much easier if the First Grammatical Treatise is also available to hand.

Many scholars have suggested that the form of &quot;Háttatal&quot; suggests a classical influence deriving from the traditions of Christian learning to which Snorri was doubtlessly exposed. Others have argued that this is a result of using a logical approach, within the framework of a dialog, and that some aspects of the work prove that it was not directly influenced by classical writings.

<text>In Norse cosmology, Vanaheimr (Old Norse for &#x27;home of the Vanir&#x27;) is a location associated with the Vanir, a group of gods themselves associated with fertility, wisdom, and the ability to see the future.

Vanaheimr is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;; compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and (in euhemerized form) &quot;Heimskringla&quot;; both written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Vanaheimr is described as the location where the god Njörðr was raised.

==Attestations==
Vanaheimr is mentioned a single time in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;; in a stanza of the poem &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;. In &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, Gagnráðr (the god Odin in disguise) engages in a game of wits with the jötunn Vafþrúðnir. Gagnráðr asks Vafþrúðnir whence the Van god Njörðr came, for, though he rules over many hofs and hörgrs, Njörðr was not raised among the Æsir. Vafþrúðnir responds that Njörðr was created in Vanaheimr by &quot;wise powers&quot; and references that Njörðr was exchanged as a hostage during the Æsir-Vanir War. In addition, Vafþrúðnir comments that, when the world ends (Ragnarök), Njörðr will return to the &quot;wise Vanir&quot; (Bellows here anglicizes &quot;Vanir&quot; to &quot;Wanes&quot;):


In chapter 23 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the enthroned figure of High says that Njörðr was raised in Vanaheimr, but was later sent as a hostage to the Æsir. 

The &quot;Heimskringla&quot; book &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; records an euhemerized account of the origins of Norse mythology. In chapter 1, &quot;Van Home or the Home of the Vanir&quot; is described as located around the Don River (which Snorri writes was once called &quot;Tana Fork&quot; or &quot;Vana Fork&quot;). Chapter 4 describes the Æsir-Vanir War, noting that during a hostage exchange, the Æsir sent the god Hœnir to Vanaheim and there he was immediately made chieftain. In chapter 15, the king Sveigðir is recorded as having married a woman named Vana in &quot;Vanaland&quot;, located in Sweden. The two produced a child, who they named Vanlandi (meaning &quot;Man from the Land of the Vanir&quot;).

==Theories==

The existence of Nine Worlds receive mention in some Old Norse texts. These worlds are nowhere specifically listed in sequence, but are generally assumed to include Vanaheimr. Henry Adams Bellows considers the other eight to be Asgard, Álfheimr, Midgard, Jötunheimr, Svartálfaheimr, Niflheim, Múspellsheimr and Helheim.

Hilda Ellis Davidson comments that exactly where Vanaheimr fall among the Nine Worlds isn&#x27;t clear, since &quot;the chief gods Freyr and Njord with a number of others, are represented along with the Æsir in Asgard, but it seems probable that it was in the underworld.&quot; Davidson notes a connection between the Vanir and &quot;the land-spirits who dwelt in mounds and hills and in water [...].

Rudolf Simek claims that Snorri &quot;unquestionably&quot; invented the name &quot;Vanaheimr&quot; as a Vanir counterpart to Asgard, but does not mention the &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot; reference.

<doc id="72293" wikidata="Q358494" url="?curid=72293" title="Mao Dun">
<text>Shen Dehong (Shen Yanbing; 4 July 1896 – 27 March 1981), best known by the pen name of Mao Dun, was a Chinese novelist, essayist, journalist, playwright, literary and cultural critic. He was highly celebrated for his realist novels, including &quot;Midnight&quot;, which depicts life in cosmopolitan Shanghai. Mao was one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party and participated in a number of left-wing cultural movements during the 1920s and 1930s. He was the editor-in-chief of &quot;Fiction Monthly&quot; and helped lead the League of Left-Wing Writers. He formed a strong friendship with fellow left-wing Chinese author Lu Xun. From 1949 to 1965, Mao served as the first Minister of Culture in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In addition to novels, Mao Dun published a number of essays, scripts, theories, short stories, and novellas. He was well known for translating Western literature, as he had gained academic knowledge of European literature from his studies at Peking University. Additionally, although he was not the first person in China to translate the works of Scottish historical novelist Walter Scott, he is considered to be the first person to popularize Walter Scott&#x27;s work in China through his &quot;Critical Biography&quot;.

He adopted the pen name &quot;Mao Dun&quot; () to express the tension in the conflicting revolutionary ideology within China in the 1920s. The name means &quot;contradiction&quot;, as Mao means spears and Dun means shields. His friend Ye Shengtao changed the first character from to , which literally means &quot;thatch&quot;.

==Early life==
His father, Shen Yongxi () taught and designed the curriculum for his son, but he died when Mao Dun was ten. Mao Dun&#x27;s mother Chen Aizhu () then became his teacher. He mentions in his memoirs that &quot;my first instructor is my mother&quot;. Through learning from his parents, Mao Dun developed great interest in writing as well as reading during his childhood.

Mao Dun had already started to develop his writing skills when he was still in primary school. In one examination the examiner commented on Mao Dun&#x27;s script: &#x27;12 year old young child, can make this language, not says motherland nobody&#x27;. There were other similar comments which indicate that Mao Dun had been a brilliant writer since his youth.

While Mao Dun was studying in secondary school in Hangzhou, extensive reading and strict writing skills training filled his life. He read the &quot;Wen Xuan&quot;, &quot;Shishuo Xinyu&quot;, and a large number of classical novels, which influenced his writing style.

Mao Dun entered the three-year foundation school offered by Peking University in 1913, in which he studied Chinese and Western literature. Due to financial difficulties, he had to quit in the summer of 1916, before his graduation. After quitting from university, he immediately got married with the daughter of Kong family, Kong Dezhi (孔德沚).

The trainings in Chinese and English as well as knowledge of Chinese and Western literature provided by the fifteen years of education Mao Dun received had prepared him to show up in the limelight of the Chinese journalistic and literary arena.

==Journalistic career==
After graduation, Mao Dun soon got his first job in the English editing and translation sections of the Commercial Press, Shanghai branch. At the age of 21, he was invited to be the assistant editor of &quot;Xuesheng Zazhi&quot; () under the Commercial Press, which had published many articles about the new ideologies that had emerged in China at that time.

Apart from editing, Mao Dun also started to write about his social thoughts and criticisms. To some extent, he was inspired by the famous magazine &quot;New Youth&quot;. Like in 1917 and 1918, he wrote two editorials for &quot;Xuesheng Zazhi&quot;: &quot;Students and Society&quot; (學生與社會) and &quot;The Students of 1918&quot;, those were significant in stimulating political consciousness among the young educated Chinese.

At 24 years of age, Mao Dun was already renowned as a novelist by the community in general, and in 1920, he and a group of young writers took over the magazine &quot;Fiction Monthly&quot;, to publish literature by western authors, such as Tolstoy, Chekhov, Balzac, Flaubert, Zola, Byron, Keats, and Shaw, and make new theories of literature better known. Despite the fact that he was a naturalistic novelist, he admired writers like Leo Tolstoy for their great artistic style.

In 1920, he was invited to edit a new column: &quot;The Fiction-New-Waves&quot; () in &quot;Fiction Monthly&quot;. He even took up the post of Chief Editor of the Monthly in the same year and was obliged to reform it thoroughly, in response to the May Fourth Movement. His young writer friends in Beijing supported him by submitting their creative writings, translating Western literature and their views on new literature theories and techniques to the magazines. Literary Study Group () was formed partly because of this. The reformed Monthly was proved to be a success. It had facilitated the continuation of the New Culture Movement by selling ten thousand copies a month and more importantly by introducing Literature for life, a brand new realistic approach to Chinese literature. In this period, Mao Dun had become a leading figure of the movement in the southern part of China.

On the notion of content reformation, both the innovative and conservative parties in the Commercial Press could not make a compromise. Mao Dun resigned from the Chief Editor of Fiction Monthly in 1923, but in 1927 he became the chief columnist of the &quot;Minguo yuebao&quot; (民国月报). He wrote more than 30 editorials for this newspaper to criticize Chiang Kai-shek, and to support revolutions.

==Political life==
Inspired by the October Revolution of 1917 in Russia, Mao Dun took part in the May Fourth Movement in China. In 1920, he joined the Shanghai Communist Team, and helped to establish the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1921. At first, he worked as a liaison for the party. He also wrote for the party magazine &quot;The Communist Party&quot;.

At the time, the CCP was allied with the Kuomintang in the First United Front. Mao Dun participated in Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Northern Expedition to reunite the country. He quit, however, when Chiang&#x27;s Kuomintang broke with the Communists in 1927. In July 1928, he went to Japan in order to take refuge. As he returned to China in 1930, he joined the League of Left-Wing Writers. Later, China went to war with Japan and he actively engaged in resisting the Japanese attack in 1937. In 1949, the communist government took over and he was responsible for working as Mao Zedong&#x27;s secretary and Culture Minister until 1965.

==Literary career==
As a literary man, Mao Dun had a great number of achievements. His reforms at &quot;Fiction Monthly&quot; were his first contribution to Chinese literature. The magazine then became a place where &quot;New Literature&quot; circulated. Many famous writers like Lu Xun, Xu Dishan, Bing Xin, Ye Shengtao, had their works published through it. Mao Dun supported movements such as &quot;New Literature&quot; and &quot;New Thinking&quot;. He believed that Chinese literature should have a place in the world.

The experience of political conflict broadened his horizon in literature, therefore the theme of his later writing was mostly based on this. He helped to found the League of Left-Wing Writers in 1930. After that, he worked together with Lu Xun to fight for the right of the society and the revolutionary movement in literature. The harvest period of Mao Dun&#x27;s writing is considered to have been from 1927 to 1937.

&quot;Shi&quot; (蚀), also translated in English as &quot;The Eclipse&quot;, was Mao&#x27;s first novel. It was published in three volumes: &quot;Disillusions&quot; (幻灭, 1927), &quot;Wavering&quot; (动摇, 1928), and &quot;Pursuits&quot; (追求, 1928). It tells the story of a generation of young intellectuals caught up in the world of revolutionary fervor without a true understanding of the nature of social change. His next major work was &quot;Rainbow&quot; (虹, 1929), which became famous for having no less than 70 main characters and numerous plot twists and turns. In 1933 came his next work, &quot;Midnight&quot;, which gained great popularity, to a point that it was also published in French and English, and it allowed to develop a sense of revolutionary realism. It is a naturalistic novel exploring the commercial world of Shanghai in detail. In addition, his fiction offered a sympathetic portrayal of working-class life and praise of revolution. He left a work unfinished, the trilogy &quot;Shuangye Hongsi Eryuehua&quot; (霜叶红似二月花, 1942).

The League of Left-Wing Writers was dissolved in a quarrel in 1936. After the initiation of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Mao traveled to many places and started a literary magazine in Wuhan. He edited the periodical &quot;Literary Front&quot; and the literary page of the newspaper &quot;Libao&quot; in Hong Kong and worked as a teacher. After 1943 Mao Dun did not produce any major works, but still wrote some articles and essays. In 1946 he visited the Soviet Union.

When the People&#x27;s Republic of China was established in 1949, he became active in several committees and he worked as the Secretary and then the Minister of Culture for Mao Zedong until 1965. He started the monthly literary journal Chinese Literature, which became the most popular for western readers. He was dismissed from his position as minister in 1964 due to the ideological upheavals. Despite this fact, Mao Dun survived the Cultural Revolution and was afterwards rehabilitated. In the 1970s he became an editor of a children&#x27;s magazine, and began working on his memoirs, which were serialized in the Party publication, the quarterly &quot;Historical Materials on New literature&quot; (), but he died on 27 March 1981, before he could finish it. His influence on Chinese literature continues to the present day because he used his savings to set up a fund called the Mao Dun Literature Scholarship to promote an atmosphere for writing fiction.

Mao Dun&#x27;s achievements in literature were also seen at his 50th birthday, which was also the 25th anniversary of his literary life. More than five hundred guests came to celebrate with him. Russian and American friends also joined the celebration. Wong Roufei wrote an essay as congratulations on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. Mao Dun&#x27;s influence and achievements in the literary field were witnessed. On the other hand, he was twice elected as the chairman and then once elected as the vice-chairman of the China Literary Arts Representative Assembly. His status in the literary field has been highly recognized. Although he suffered great pain from illness in his old age, he still kept writing his memoirs, called &quot;The Road I Walked&quot; ().

Besides his achievements, Mao Dun also had great influence on Chinese literature. The Mao Dun Literature Prize was created due to Mao Dun&#x27;s wish that outstanding novels should be encouraged and communist literature should be promoted. It is one of the most honorable literature awards in China. Many famous modern Chinese literary authors like Wei Wei and Zhou Keqin have received the prize.

== Marriage and personal life ==
Mao Dun had a typical traditional Chinese marriage. His family got him engaged to the Kong family when he was five years old and he married the daughter of Kong family after he quit from university. After their marriage, the daughter of Kong family had been renamed as Kong Dezhi (孔德沚), and she would go on to assist Mao Dun with his literary and political career during their marriage. However, Mao had had a two-year long affair with Qin Dejun (秦德君) during his marriage, which is also believed to have effects on his novel &quot;Rainbow&quot;. In the end, Mao Dun ended the affair and returned to his own family.

== Transition of female characters ==
The 1930s is a turning point of the female characters&#x27; identity in Mao Dun&#x27;s works. Between the 1920s and the 1930s, which was also the early period of Mao Dun&#x27;s writing career, the female characters occurring in his works mostly were in identity of &quot;New Woman&quot;, for instance, Mrs. Gui (桂阿姨) and Qionghua (琼华) in &quot;Wild Rose&quot; (野蔷薇, 1929), Ms. Mei (梅小姐) in &quot;Rainbow&quot; (虹, 1930).

However, from the 1930s, the &quot;New Woman&quot; characters in Mao Dun&#x27;s works started to be replaced by the females who were living in traditional Chinese family. Furthermore, female characters even started to lose their own names. As in one of Mao Dun&#x27;s short novels, which was released in the 1930s, Shui zaoxing (水藻行), the only female character did not even have an actual name but only be called as &quot;Xiusheng (one of the two main male characters)&#x27;s wife (秀生妻)&quot; in the novel.

<text>Peking University (PKU) is a public university in Haidian, Beijing, China. It is affiliated with and funded by the Ministry of Education of China. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction. It is also a member in the C9 League.

Established as the Imperial University of Peking in 1898 by a royal charter from the Guangxu Emperor, it is the second oldest university in China after Tianjin University (established in 1895). In May 1912, the government of the Republic of China ordered the Imperial University of Peking to be renamed Peking University. Peking University merged with Yenching University after the nationwide restructuring of schools and departments in 1952. In April 2000, the former Beijing Medical University merged into the Peking University.

Peking University has six faculties, namely Humanities, Social Sciences, Economics and Management, Science, Information Technology and Engineering, as well as Health Science. It consists of 55 schools and departments, 60 research entities, and ten affiliated hospitals. By 2017, Peking University&#x27;s staff include 76 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19 members of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and 25 members of the World Academy of Sciences.

== History ==


=== Establishment ===
Following China&#x27;s defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, intellectuals – including Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, and Yan Fu – called for reforms to the country&#x27;s education system. In June 1896, Minister Li Duanfen proposed to create a university in the capital. On 11 June 1898, the Guangxu Emperor, as part of the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform, authorised the creation of the Imperial University of Peking (). The Imperial University was formally established on 3 July 1898 when the emperor approved the royal charter written by Liang. Minister Sun Jianai was charged with the implementation. IUP served as the country&#x27;s foremost institute for higher learning, but also as its highest educational authority. William Alexander Parsons Martin was appointed as the first president. Most of the reforms were abolished when the conservative Empress Dowager Cixi seized power on 21 September. The university survived with altered objectives and reduced scope. It opened on 31 December with 160 students, instead of the planned 500.

Following the Xinhai Revolution, the Imperial University of Peking was renamed &quot;Government University of Peking&quot; in 1912 and then &quot;National University of Peking&quot; in 1919 ().

=== Early Republic of China period (1916–1927) ===
The noted scholar Cai Yuanpei was appointed president on 4 January 1917, and helped transform Peking University into the country&#x27;s largest institution of higher learning, with 14 departments and an enrollment of more than 2,000 students. President Cai, inspired by the German model of academic freedom, introduced faculty governance and democratic management to the university. Cai recruited an intellectually diverse faculty that included some of the most prominent figures in the progressive New Culture Movement, including Hu Shih, Liu Bannong, Ma Yinchu, Li Dazhao, Chen Duxiu, Lu Xun and Liang Shuming. Meanwhile, leading conservatives Gu Hongming and Huang Kan also taught at the university. A firm supporter for freedom of thought, Cai advocated for educational independence and resigned several times protesting the government&#x27;s policy and interference.

On 1 May 1919, some students of Peking University learned that the Treaty of Versailles would allow Japan to receive Germany&#x27;s colonising rights in Shandong province. An assembly at Peking University that included these students and representatives from other universities in Beijing was quickly organised. On 4 May, students from thirteen universities marched to Tiananmen to protest the terms of Treaty of Versailles, demanded the Beiyang government to refuse to sign the treaty. Demonstrators also demanded the immediate resignation of three officials: Cao Rulin, Minister of the Ministry of Transportation, Zhang Zongxiang, China&#x27;s Ambassador to Japan and Lu Zongyu, Minister of Currency, who they believed were in cooperation with Japanese. The protest ended up with some protesters being beaten and arrested, and Cao Rulin&#x27;s house burned by protesters. Following the protest on 4 May, students, workers and merchants from nearly all China&#x27;s major cities went on strike and boycotted Japanese goods in China. The Beiyang government eventually agreed to release the arrested students and fired the three officials under intense public pressure, China&#x27;s representatives in Paris refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles.During the Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius campaign of 1973 to 1976, critique groups formed at Peking University and Tsinghua University disseminated commentaries under the pseudonym of &quot;Liang Xiao.&quot; The pseudonym sounds like a person&#x27;s name but is a homophone for &quot;two schools.&quot;

=== 21st century (2000–present) ===
In October 2015, Peking University alumni Professor Tu Youyou was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her discovery of artemisinin. Having saved millions of lives, artemisinin has made significant contributions to global health in regard to the fight against malaria.

On 20 February 2017, the university officially signed a contract with the British Open University to establish the Oxford Campus of Peking University HSBC Business School, Peking University Oxford Center and Shenzhen Oxford Innovation Center.

On 29 June 2020, the Sino-Russian Mathematics Center was established. The Sino-Russian Mathematics Center is led by Peking University and Moscow State University, and jointly constructed by relevant domestic units and other Russian universities and research institutes such as St. Petersburg University, relying on the &quot;Double First-class&quot; construction alliance in mathematics.

On 2 April 2021, Peking University Nanchang Innovation Research Institute was inaugurated.

On 15 July 2021, Peking University School of Integrated Circuitswas inaugurated.

In October, Peking University officially announced the establishment of Peking University School of Computer Science, which means the computer major of Peking University was officially upgraded from a department to a school. Yang Fuqing, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, served as the honorary president.

In 2022, Peking University and Lancet established a commission on healthy aging in China. The Commission&#x27;s purpose is to re-focus the debate on aging not just on the risks of China&#x27;s aging population but on opportunities by &quot;unleashing the intellectual and vocational capacities of the older population and the whole of Chinese society.&quot;

In June 2022, the International University Sports Federation (FISU) released the first series of &quot;Healthy Campus&quot; list. Peking University, as the only Chinese university that has obtained platinum certification from the International University Sports Federation, participated in 4 projects and became the only representative from China among 130 projects worldwide.

== Campus ==

American architect and art historian Talbot Hamlin designed some of the university&#x27;s buildings constructed during the 1919 to 1922 period. There are several gates that lead into campus — East, West and South gates, with the West Gate being the most well known for the painted murals on its ceiling. Weiming Lake is in the north of the campus and is surrounded by walking paths and small gardens. The university hosts many museums, such as the Museum of University History and the Arthur M. Sackler Museum of Art and Archaeology. Notable items in these museums include funerary objects that were excavated in Beijing and date back thousands of years from the graves of royals of the Warring States period. There are ritual pottery vessels as well as elaborate pieces of jewelry on display. There are also human bones set up in the traditional burial style of that period.

Beyond its main campus, Peking University Health Science Center (PKUHSC) is on Xueyuan Road where the country&#x27;s most distinguished colleges are, and is a fitting site for academics and research.

During the Third Front construction, Peking University opened a branch in Hanzhong, Shaanxi.

In 2001, Peking University&#x27;s Shenzhen campus, the Shenzhen Graduate School, opened its doors. The campus is located in the northwest part of Shenzhen City.

== Academics ==

Peking University consists of 30 schools and 12 departments, with 125 majors for undergraduates, 2 majors for the second bachelor&#x27;s degree, 282 programs for Master&#x27;s degree candidates and 258 programs for doctoral candidates. In addition to basic research, the university also conducts applied research.

At present, Peking University has 216 research institutions and research centres, including 2 national engineering research centers, 81 key national disciplines, and 12 national key laboratories. With 8 million holdings, the university library is the largest of its kind in Asia.

Peking University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Emory University jointly administer the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering.

Over the past century, some Peking University alumni have become presidents of other major Chinese universities, including former Tsinghua President Luo Jialun, Renmin University President Yuan Baohua, Zhejiang University President Qian Sanqiang, Fudan University President Zhang Zhirang, Nankai University President Teng Weizao, Chinese University of Science and Technology President Guan Weiyan and many others.

=== International cooperation ===

Every year, there are approximately 7,000 international students studying at Peking University.

Peking University offers dual degree programs at the bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral levels with the renowned Waseda University (早稲田大学) in Northeast Asia. It is one of the most engaged partners with Waseda, having established a strong cooperative relationship of the highest level. This partnership began with an academic agreement in 1982, enhancing dual degree programs and joint research initiatives since 2003. Under the PKU-Waseda project, each year, the university selects undergraduates to spend their third year studying at Waseda University in Japan, and then they return to Peking University for their fourth year. Simultaneously, Waseda University sends numerous students to Peking University as exchange students. Upon graduation, students receive two bachelor&#x27;s degrees, one from each university. Additionally, joint master&#x27;s student training programs and dual doctoral degree programs with Waseda University are also in operation. The comprehensive collaboration of offering dual degrees at all bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral levels, as seen in the Peking-Waseda partnership, is rare on a global scale.

The dormitories for international students at the main campus are located at &quot;Shaoyuan Garden&quot; (勺园) and &quot;Zhongguanyuan Global Village&quot; (中关新园). Its international students are made up of students from most countries in the world including most of Western Europe, North America, and South America, Asia, Australia and many countries in Africa. In 2005, Peking University and Cornell University signed an agreement formally establishing the China and Asia-Pacific Studies major at Cornell, which requires students to spend a semester studying at Peking University while working at internships. In 2006, PKU launched a joint undergraduate program with Yale University in which students will spend a semester overseas, living and studying together with the host institute&#x27;s students. PKU&#x27;s School of International Studies also launched joint degree programs with London School of Economics, Paris School of International Affairs, Seoul National University, and the University of Tokyo. PKU also has a longstanding relationship with Stanford University which operates a joint research center and base for Stanford students and scholars at the Stanford Center at Peking University, located in the Lee Jung Sen Building. The Peking University HSBC Business School has joint degree programs with University of Hong Kong and Chinese University of Hong Kong. The university has maintained a partnership with the Freie Universität Berlin since 1981 and the Higher School of Economics since 2015, and in 2019, became a partner of Washington University in St. Louis through the McDonnell International Scholars Academy.

<text> (, &quot;living space&quot;) is a German concept of expansionism and &quot;Völkisch&quot; nationalism, the philosophy and policies of which were common to German politics from the 1890s to the 1940s. First popularized around 1901, became a geopolitical goal of Imperial Germany in World War I (1914–1918), as the core element of the of territorial expansion.&lt;ref name=&quot;E/N301&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The most extreme form of this ideology was supported by the Nazi Party and Nazi Germany, the ultimate goal of which was to establish a Greater German Reich. was a leading motivation of Nazi Germany to initiate World War II, and it would continue this policy until the end of the conflict.

Following Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, became an ideological principle of Nazism and provided justification for the German territorial expansion into Central and Eastern Europe. The Nazi policy () was based on its tenets. It stipulated that Germany required a &quot;&quot; necessary for its survival and that most of the populations of Central and Eastern Europe would have to be removed permanently (either through mass deportation to Siberia, extermination, or enslavement), including Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Czech, and other Slavic nations considered non-Aryan. The Nazi government aimed at repopulating these lands with Germanic colonists in the name of during and following World War II. Entire populations were ravaged by starvation; any agricultural surplus was used to feed Germany. The Jewish population was to be exterminated outright.

Hitler&#x27;s strategic program for Greater Germany was based on the belief in the power of , especially when pursued by a racially superior society. People deemed to be part of non-Aryan races, within the territory of expansion, were subjected to expulsion or destruction. The eugenics of assumed it to be the right of the German Aryan master race () to remove the indigenous people in the name of their own living space. They took inspiration for this concept from outside Germany. Hitler and Nazi officials took a particular interest in manifest destiny, and attempted to replicate it in occupied Europe. Nazi Germany also supported other Axis Powers&#x27; expansionist ideologies such as Fascist Italy&#x27;s and Imperial Japan&#x27;s .

==Origins==

In the 19th century, the term was used by the German geographer and biologist Oscar Peschel in his 1860 review of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origins of Species&quot; (1859). In 1897, the geographer and ethnographer Friedrich Ratzel in his book applied the word (&quot;living space&quot;) to describe physical geography as a factor that influences human activities in developing into a society. In 1901, Ratzel extended his thesis in his essay titled &quot;&quot;. Ratzel pointed to historical precedent in the Middle Ages, when the social and economic pressures of rapid population growth in the German states had led to a steady colonization of Germanic peoples in Eastern Europe.

During the First World War, the Allied naval blockade of the Central Powers caused food shortages in Germany, and resources from German colonies in Africa were unable to slip past the blockade; this caused support to rise during the war for a that would expand Germany eastward into Russia to gain control of their resources to prevent such a situation from occurring in the future. In the period between the First and the Second World Wars, German nationalists adopted the term in their political demands for the re-establishment of the German colonial empire, which had been dismembered by the Allies at Versailles. Ratzel said that the development of a people into a society was primarily influenced by their geographic situation (habitat) and that a society that successfully adapted to one geographic territory would naturally and logically expand the boundaries of their nation into another territory. Yet, to resolve German overpopulation, Ratzel pointed out that Imperial Germany (1871–1918) required overseas colonies to which surplus Germans ought to emigrate.

===Geopolitics===
Friedrich Ratzel&#x27;s metaphoric concept of society as an organism—which grows and shrinks in logical relation to its (habitat)—proved especially influential upon the Swedish political scientist and conservative politician Johan Rudolf Kjellén (1864–1922), who interpreted that biological metaphor as a geopolitical natural-law. In the political monograph (1917; &quot;Sweden&quot;), Kjellén coined the terms (the conditions and problems of a state that arise from its geographic territory), (the economic factors that affect the power of the state), and (the social problems that arise from the racial composition of the state) to explain the political particulars to be considered for the successful administration and governing of a state. Moreover, he had a great intellectual influence upon the politics of Imperial Germany, especially with (1916; &quot;The State as a Life-form&quot;), an earlier political-science book read by the society of Imperial Germany, for whom the concept of acquired an ideological definition unlike the original, human-geography definition.

Kjellén&#x27;s geopolitical interpretation of the concept was adopted, expanded, and adapted to the politics of Germany by publicists of imperialism such as the militarist General Friedrich von Bernhardi (1849–1930) and the political geographer and proponent of geopolitics Karl Haushofer (1869–1946). In (1911; &quot;Germany and the Next War&quot;), General von Bernhardi developed Friedrich Ratzel&#x27;s concept as a racial struggle for living space, explicitly identified Eastern Europe as the source of a new, national habitat for the German people, and said that the next war would be expressly for acquiring —all in fulfillment of the &quot;biological necessity&quot; to protect German racial supremacy. Vanquishing the Slavic and the Latin races was deemed necessary because &quot;without war, inferior or decaying races would easily choke the growth of healthy, budding elements&quot; of the German race—thus, the war for was a necessary means of defending Germany against cultural stagnation and the racial degeneracy of miscegenation.

===Racial ideology===

In the national politics of Weimar Germany, the geopolitical usage of is credited to Karl Ernst Haushofer and his Institute of Geopolitics, in Munich, especially the ultra-nationalist interpretation of it, which was used as a justification for the desire to avenge Germany&#x27;s military defeat at the end of the First World War (1914–18) and the desire to reverse the dictates of the Treaty of Versailles (1919), which reduced Germany geographically, economically, and militarily. Hitler said that the Nazi geopolitics of &quot;inevitable expansion&quot; would reverse overpopulation, provide natural resources, and uphold German national honor. In (1925; &quot;My Struggle&quot;), Hitler presented his conception of as the philosophic basis for the Greater Germanic Reich that was destined to colonize Eastern Europe—especially Ukraine in the Soviet Union—and so resolve the problems of overpopulation, and that the European states had to accede to his geopolitical demands.

The Nazi Party&#x27;s usages of the term were explicitly racial, to justify the mystical right of the racially superior Germanic peoples () to fulfill their cultural destiny at the expense of racially inferior peoples (), such as the Slavs of Poland, Russia, Ukraine, and the other non–Germanic peoples of &quot;the East&quot;. Based upon Johan Rudolf Kjellén&#x27;s geopolitical interpretation of Friedrich Ratzel&#x27;s human-geography term, the Nazi regime (1933–45) established as the racist rationale of the foreign policy by which they began the Second World War, on 1 September 1939, in an effort to realise the Greater Germanic Reich at the expense of the societies of Eastern Europe.

=== Prussian policy ===
Some Prussian politicians were increasingly thinking in terms of &quot;Lebensraum&quot; by 1907. In 1902, the Prussian government had already allocated 200,000,000 ℳ︁ for purposes of German colonization of Polish portions of eastern Prussia. These funds were intended to support the creation of settlements by acquiring Polish estates. By 1907, Prussian Chancellor Bülow was promoting bills that explicitly called for the forced sale of Polish estates. A bill in late 1907 asked for another $100,000,000 for expropriations.

In 1903, the Prussian authorities tried a Polish countess for &quot;presenting a false heir&quot; for an estate near Wróblewo. The case, tried in Berlin, generated crowds of people and police. Observers expressed concern that Prussian &quot;race partiality&quot; would result in a guilty verdict.

==First World War nationalist premise==

In September 1914, when the German victory in the First World War appeared feasible, the German government introduced the as an official war aim (), which was secretly ordered by Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg (1909–17), whereby, upon achieving battlefield victory, Germany would annex territories from western Poland to form the Polish Border Strip (, ). would be realised by way of ethnic cleansing, the forcible removal of the native Slavic and Jewish populations, and the subsequent repopulation of the border strip with ethnic-German colonists; likewise, the colonisations of Lithuania and Ukraine. However, military over-extension lost the war for Imperial Germany, and the went unrealised.

In April 1915, Chancellor von Bethmann Hollweg authorised the Polish Border Strip plans in order to take advantage of the extensive territories in Eastern Europe that Germany had conquered and held since early in the war. The decisive campaigns of Imperial Germany almost realised in the East, especially when Bolshevik Russia unilaterally withdrew as a combatant in the &quot;Great War&quot; among the European great powers—the Triple Entente (the Russian Empire, the French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom) and the Central Powers (the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and the Kingdom of Bulgaria).

In March 1918, in an effort to reform and modernise the Russian Empire (1721–1917) into a soviet republic, the Bolshevik government agreed to the strategically onerous territorial cessions stipulated in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (33% of arable land, 30% of industry, and 90% of the coal mines of Russia). As a result, Russia yielded to Germany much of the arable land of European Russia, the Baltic governorates, Belarus, Ukraine, and the Caucasus region. Despite such an extensive geopolitical victory, tactical defeat in the Western Front, strategic over-extension, and factional division in government compelled Imperial Germany to abandon the Eastern European gained with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in favour of the peace-terms of the Treaty of Versailles (1919), and yielded those Russian lands to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine.

As a for the conquest and colonisation of Polish territories as living-space and defensive-border for Imperial Germany, the derived from a foreign policy initially proposed by General Erich Ludendorff in 1914. Twenty-five years later, Nazi foreign policy resumed the cultural goal of the pursuit and realisation of German living-space at the expense of non-German peoples in Eastern Europe with the September Campaign (1 September – 6 October 1939) that began the Second World War in Europe. In &quot;Germany and the Two World Wars&quot;, the German historian Andreas Hillgruber said that the territorial gains of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (1918) were the imperial prototype for Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Greater German Empire in Eastern Europe:

The (1914) documents &quot; in the East&quot; as philosophically integral to Germanic culture throughout the history of Germany; and that is not a racialist philosophy particular to the 20th century. As military strategy, the was unsuccessful due to its infeasibility, with too few soldiers to realise the plans during a two-front war. Politically, the allowed the Imperial Government to learn the opinions of the nationalist, economic, and military elites of the German ruling class who financed and facilitated geopolitics. Nationally, the annexation and ethnic cleansing of Poland for German was an official and a popular subject of &quot;nationalism-as-national-security&quot; endorsed by German society, including the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SDP). In &quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot;, the British historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote:

==Interwar propaganda==
In the national politics of the Weimar Republic (1919–33), the German eugenicists took up the nationalist political slogan of , and matched it with the racial slogan (a People without Youth), a cultural proposition that ignored the declining German birth rate (since the 1880s) and contradicted the popular belief that the &quot;German race&quot; was a vigorous and growing people. Despite each slogan (political and racial) being contradicted by the reality of such demographic facts, the nationalists&#x27; demands for proved to be ideologically valid politics in Weimar Germany.

In the lead-up to (1938) and the invasion of Poland (1939), the propaganda of the Nazi Party in Germany used popular feelings of wounded national identity aroused in the aftermath of the First World War to promote policies of . Studies of the homeland focused on the lost colonies after the establishment of the Second Polish Republic, which was ratified by the Treaty of Versailles (), as well as the &quot;eternal Jewish threat&quot; (, 1937). Emphasis was put on the need for rearmament and the pseudoscience of superior races in the pursuit of &quot;blood and soil&quot; ().

During the twenty-one-year inter-war period between the First (1914–18) and the Second (1939–45) World War, for Germany was the principal tenet of the extremist nationalism that characterised German party politics. The Nazis, led by Adolf Hitler, demanded not only the geographic reversion of Germany&#x27;s post-war borders (to recuperate territory lost by the Treaty of Versailles), but also the German conquest and colonisation of Eastern Europe (whether or not those lands were German before 1918). To that end, Hitler said that flouting the Treaty of Versailles was required for Germany to obtain needed in Eastern Europe. During the 1920s, Heinrich Himmler—as a member of the Artaman League, an anti-Slav, anti-urban, and anti-Semitic organisation of &quot;blood and soil&quot; ideology—developed the ideas that advocated , for the realisation of which he said that the:

== Hitlerite doctrine of ==
In (1925), Hitler dedicated a full chapter—titled &quot;Eastern Orientation or Eastern Policy&quot;—to outlining the need for the new &quot;living space&quot; for Germany. He claimed that achieving required political will, and that the Nazi movement ought to strive to expand population area for the German people and acquire new sources of food.

 became the principal foreign-policy goal of the Nazi Party and the government of Nazi Germany (1933–45). Hitler rejected the restoration of the pre-war borders of Germany as an inadequate half-measure towards reducing purported national overpopulation. From that perspective, he opined that the nature of national borders is always unfinished and momentary, and that their redrawing must continue as Germany&#x27;s political goal. Identifying the conquest of as a major ideological goal of his party, Hitler wrote in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;:

The ideologies found at the root of Hitler&#x27;s implementation of modeled that of German colonialism of the New Imperialism period as well as the American ideology of manifest destiny. Hitler had great admiration for the United States&#x27; territorial expansion and saw the destruction of Native American peoples and their cultures that took place during the United States&#x27; westward expansion as a template for German expansion. He believed that in order to transform the German nation into a world superpower, Germany had to expand their geopolitical presence and act only in the interest of the German people. Hitler had also viewed with dismay the German reliance on food imports by sea during the First World War, believing it to be a contributing factor to Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war. He believed that only through could Germany shift &quot;its dependence for food... to its own imperial hinterland&quot;.

Hitler&#x27;s bio-geo-political doctrine of &quot;Lebensraum&quot; consisted of two components existing in tension: the materialist endeavour to expand Germanic territories and the mystical quest to revive what the Nazis viewed as the &quot;idealized German medieval past&quot;. The explicit embrace of these contradictions was evident in the promulgation of Nazi slogans such as &quot;&quot;Blut und Boden&quot; (blood and soil). National Socialism was presented by its ideologues as an organic world-view (&quot;Weltanschauung&quot;&quot;) that subordinated all aspects of life—physical bodies, soul, mind, culture, government, religion, education, economy, etc.—into an &quot;organic totality&quot; existing within &quot;Lebensraum&quot;. Defining Nazism as a &quot;Weltanschauung&quot; during his speech at the 1933 Nuremberg rally, Hitler stated: &quot;Already in the word &quot;&#x27;Weltanschauung&quot;&#x27; lies the solemn proclamation of a decision that all acts are based upon a certain point of view and a visible tendency. Such a view can be true or false: it is the starting point for every opinion on the appearance and events of life, and is therefore a binding and obligating law for every act. The more such an opinion covers the natural law of organic life, the better its conscious utility can be applied for the sake of the people&#x27;s life.&quot;

=== sequel, 1928 ===
In the unpublished sequel to (), the &quot;Zweites Buch&quot; (1928, &quot;Second Book&quot;), Hitler further presents the ideology of Nazi , in accordance with the then-future foreign policy of the Nazi Party. To further German population growth, Hitler rejected the ideas of birth control and emigration, arguing that such practices weakened the people and culture of Germany, and that military conquest was the only means for obtaining :

Therefore, the non-Germanic peoples of the annexed foreign territories would never be Germanised:

=== Foreign-policy prime directive ===
The conquest of living space for Germany was the foremost foreign-policy goal of the Nazis towards establishing the Greater Germanic Reich that was to last a thousand years. On 3 February 1933, at his initial meeting with the generals and admirals of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler said that the conquest of in Eastern Europe and its &quot;ruthless Germanisation&quot; were the ultimate geopolitical objectives of Reich foreign policy. The USSR was the country to provide sufficient for the Germans, because it possessed much agricultural land, and was inhabited by Slavic ruled by Jewish Bolshevism. The racism of Hitler&#x27;s philosophy allowed only the Germanisation of the soil and the land, but not of the native peoples, who were to be destroyed, by slave labour and starvation.

=== Ideological motives ===
Anti-Slavism was a central component of the NSDAP&#x27;s racist ideology, and a driving force behind Nazi Germany&#x27;s irredentist schemes to seize &quot;Lebensraum&quot; through the eastward expansion of German territories. In the worldview of Adolf Hitler, the idea of restoring the 1914 borders of the German (Imperial Germany, 1871–1918) was absurd, because those national borders did not provide sufficient for the German population; only a foreign policy for the geopolitical conquest of the proper amount of would justify the necessary sacrifices entailed by war. 

Hitler thought that history was dominated by a merciless struggle for survival among the different races of mankind; and that the races who possessed a great national territory were innately stronger than those races who possessed a small national territory—which the Germanic Aryan race could take by what he viewed as their natural right. Such official racist perspectives for the establishment of German allowed the Nazis to unilaterally launch a war of aggression () against the countries of Eastern Europe, ideologically justified as historical recuperation of the Oium (lands) that the Slavs had conquered from the native Ostrogoths.

Nazi propaganda depicted Eastern Europe as historically Germanic territories, promoting the myth that these regions were stolen from Aryan races by Hunnic and Avar tribes. Hitler viewed Slavs as primitive subhumans, and he detested the German empire&#x27;s alliance with Austria-Hungary during World War I. In his works such as &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and &quot;Zweites Buch&quot;, Hitler viewed the Slavs as lacking the capability to form a state. Although Hitler openly spoke about the need for living space in the 1920s, he never publicly spoke about it during his first years in power. It was not until 1937, with the German rearmament program well under way, that he began again to publicly speak about the need for living space.

== in practice: the Second World War ==


The bio-geo-political nature of Nazi &quot;Weltanschauung&quot; was the core ideological force that instigated Nazi Germany to launch its violent project in pursuit of a new global order. This scheme aimed to dissolve the contradictions between the Nazi conceptualizations of &quot;race&quot; and &quot;space&quot; through the creation of a Germanic &quot;Lebensraum&quot; and achievement of world domination by the Nordic people. This combination of biopolitical and geo-political agenda of the Nazi Reich became the basis for its Germanization policies, the mission of what it regarded as the &quot;purification of the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;&quot;, as well as its state-sponsored genocidal apparatus.

On 6 October 1939, Hitler told the Reichstag that after the fall of Poland the most important matter was &quot;a new order of ethnographic relations, that is to say, resettlement of nationalities&quot;. On 20 October 1939, Hitler told General Wilhelm Keitel that the war would be a difficult &quot;racial struggle&quot; and that the General Government was to &quot;purify the Reich territory from Jews and Polacks, too.&quot; Likewise, in October 1939, Nazi propaganda instructed Germans to view Poles, Jews, and Gypsies as .

Nazi Germany&#x27;s pursuit of its bio-geo-political ambitions was carried out through fanatical perpetration of a racist war of annihilation (&quot;Vernichtungskrieg&quot;) which inflicted industrial-scale terrorism against entire populations. These policies resulted in the genocide of numerous ethnic groups in German-occupied territories, including the Jews, Poles, Russians, Romani people, etc. and also contributed to the failure of German war aims. Nazi policies in German-occupied territories were marked by spontaneous adaptation, on-the-fly modifications, and bureaucratic competition, underscoring the impulsive nature of Hitlerism.

In 1941, in a speech to the Eastern Front Battle Group Nord, Himmler said that the war against the Soviet Union was a war of ideologies and races, between Nazism and Jewish Bolshevism and between the Germanic (Nordic) peoples and the peoples of the East. Moreover, in one of the secret Posen speeches to the at Posen, Himmler said: &quot;the mixed race of the Slavs is based on a sub-race with a few drops of our blood, the blood of a leading race; the Slav is unable to control himself and create order.&quot; In that vein, Himmler published the pamphlet , which featured photographs of ideal racial types, Aryans, contrasted with the barbarian races, descended from Attila the Hun and Genghis Khan, to the massacres committed in the Soviet Union dominated by Jewish Bolshevism.

With the Polish decrees (8 March 1940), the Nazis ensured that the racial inferiority of the Poles was legally recognized in the German Reich, and regulated the working and living conditions of Polish laborers (). The Polish decrees also established that any Pole &quot;who has sexual relations with a German man or woman, or approaches them in any other improper manner, will be punished by death.&quot; The were vigilant of sexual relations between Germans and Poles, and pursued anyone suspected of race defilement (); likewise, there were proscriptions of sexual relations between Germans and other ethnic groups brought in from Eastern Europe.

As official policy, Heinrich Himmler said that no drop of German blood would be lost or left behind to mingle with any alien races; and that the Germanisation of Eastern Europe would be complete when &quot;in the East dwell only men with truly German [and] Germanic blood&quot;. In the secret memorandum &quot;Reflections on the Treatment of Peoples of Alien Races in the East&quot; (25 May 1940), Himmler outlined the future of the Eastern European peoples: (i) division of native ethnic groups found in the new living-space; (ii) limited, formal education of four years of elementary school (to teach them only how to write their names and to count to five hundred); and (iii) obedience of the orders of Germans.

Despite Nazi Germany&#x27;s official racism, the extermination of Eastern European native populations was not always necessary because the racial policy of Nazi Germany regarded some Eastern European peoples as being of Aryan-Nordic stock, especially the local leaders. On March 4, 1941, Himmler introduced the German People&#x27;s List (), which intended to segregate the inhabitants of German-occupied territories into categories of desirability according to criteria. In the same memorandum, Himmler advocated the kidnapping of children who appeared to be Nordic because it would &quot;remove the danger that this subhuman people () of the East through such children might acquire a leader class from such people of good blood, which would be dangerous for us because they would be our equals.&quot; According to Himmler, the destruction of the Soviet Union would have led to the exploitation of millions of peoples as slave labor in the occupied territories and the eventual re-population of the areas with Germans.

Nazi Germany&#x27;s initiation of Operation Barbarossa was motivated by the racial theories and bio-political doctrines of the NSDAP, which were fervently anti-Slavic, anti-communist and anti-semitic. The Nazi party&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;Lebensraum&quot; was central to its programme of waging a racial war against Russia, a geopolitical agenda advanced by Hitler since the 1920s. 

During the final months of the Second World War, Nazi Germany intensified its anti-Semitic, anti-Slavic, and anti-communist propaganda. Hitler fanatically reiterated the core ideological tenets of Nazism, such as his goal of expanding German territories eastwards in pursuit of &quot;Lebensraum&quot;. He continued to advocate the Germanic settler-colonial project in Eastern Europe, including his desire to exterminate a significant portion of the Slavic populations. In his letter to German field marshal Wilhelm Keitel written on 29 April 1945, Hitler stated: “Our goal must still be the capture of living space in the East for the German nation.”

===Classification under the laws in the annexed territories===
The Deutsche Volksliste was split into four categories. Men in the first two categories were required to enlist for compulsory military service. Membership in the (SS) was reserved for men from Category I only:
Hitler, who was born in the ethnically diverse Austrian-Hungarian Empire, avowed in (1926) that Germanising Austrian Slavs by language during the Age of Partitions could not have turned them into fully fledged Germans, because no &quot;Negro&quot; nor a &quot;Chinaman&quot; would ever &quot;become German&quot; just because he has learned to speak German. He believed that no visible differences between peoples could be bridged by the use of a common language. Any such attempts would lead to the &quot;bastardization&quot; of the German element, he said. Likewise, Hitler criticized the previous attempts at Germanisation of the Poles in the Prussian Partition as an erroneous idea, based on the same false reasoning. The Polish people could not possibly be Germanised by being compelled to speak German because they belonged to a different race, he said; &quot;the result would have been fatal&quot; for the purity of the German nation because the foreigners would &quot;compromise&quot; by their inferiority &quot;the dignity and nobility&quot; of the German nation. During the war, Hitler remarked in his &quot;Table Talk&quot; that people should only be Germanised if they were to improve the German blood line:

Informed by the blood and soil beliefs of ethnic identity—a philosophic basis of —Nazi policy required destroying the USSR for the lands of Russia to become the granary of Germany. The Germanisation of Russia required the destruction of its cities, in an effort to vanquish Russianness, Communism, and Jewish Bolshevism. To that effect, Hitler ordered the Siege of Leningrad (September 1941 – January 1944), to raze the city and destroy the native Russian population. Geopolitically, the establishment of German in the east of Europe would thwart blockades, like those that occurred during the First World War, which starved the people of Germany. Moreover, using Eastern Europe to feed Germany also was intended to exterminate millions of Slavs, by slave labour and starvation. When deprived of producers, a workforce, and customers, native industry would cease and disappear from the Germanised region, which then became agricultural land for settlers from Nazi Germany.

The Germanised lands of Eastern Europe would be settled by the , a soldier–peasant who was to maintain a fortified line of defence, which would prevent any non–German civilisation from arising to threaten the Greater Germanic Reich. At a conference in 1941, Hitler stated:

Plans for the Germanisation of western Europe were less severe, as the Nazis needed the collaboration of the local political and business establishments, especially that of local industry and their skilled workers. Moreover, Nazi racial policies considered the populations of western Europe more racially acceptable to Aryan standards of racial purity. In practice, the number and assortment of Nazi racial categories indicated that &quot;East is bad and West is acceptable&quot;; thus, a person&#x27;s &quot;race&quot; was a matter of life or death in countries under Nazi occupation.

The racist ideology of also comprised the North German racial stock of the northern-European peoples of Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, Sweden); and the continental-European peoples of Alsace and Lorraine, Belgium and northern France; whilst the United Kingdom would either be annexed or be made a puppet state. Moreover, the poor military performance of the Italian armed forces forced Fascist Italy&#x27;s withdrawal from the war in 1943, which then made northern Italy a territory to be annexed to the Greater Germanic Reich.

;Collaborationism
For political expediency, the Nazis continually modified their racist politics towards non–Germanic peoples—and so continually redefined the ideological meaning of —in order to collaborate with other peoples, in service of the Reich&#x27;s foreign policy. Early in his career as leader of the Nazis, Adolf Hitler said he would accept friendly relations with the USSR, on condition that the Soviet government re-establish the disadvantageous borders of European Russia, which were demarcated in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (1918). This made possible the restoration of Russo–German diplomatic relations.

In 1921–22, Hitler said that German might be achieved with a smaller USSR, created by sponsoring anti-communist Russians in deposing the Communist government of the Bolsheviks; however, by the end of 1922, Hitler changed his opinion when there arose the possibility of an Anglo–German geopolitical alliance to destroy the USSR. However, following the invasion of the USSR in Operation Barbarossa (1941), the strategic stance of the Nazi régime towards a smaller, independent Russia was affected by political pressure from the German Army, who asked Hitler to endorse the creation of the anti–Communist Russian Liberation Army (ROA) and its integration into the Wehrmacht operations in Russia. The ROA was an organization of defectors, led by General Andrey Vlasov, who meant to depose the régime of Joseph Stalin and the Russian Communist Party.

Initially, Hitler rejected the idea of collaborating with the peoples in the East. However, Nazis such as Joseph Goebbels and Alfred Rosenberg were in favor of collaboration against Bolshevism and offering some independence to the peoples of the East. In 1940, Himmler opened up membership for people he regarded as being of &quot;related stock&quot;, which resulted in a number of right-wing Scandinavians signing up to fight in the Waffen-SS. When the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, further volunteers from France, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, and Croatia signed up to fight for the Nazi cause. After 1942, when the war turned decisively against Nazi Germany, further recruits from the occupied territories signed up to fight for the Nazis. Hitler was worried about the foreign legions on the Eastern Front; he remarked that &quot;One mustn&#x27;t forget that, unless he is convinced of his racial membership of the Germanic , the foreign legionary is bound to feel that he&#x27;s betraying his country.&quot;

After further losses of manpower, the Nazis tried to persuade the forced foreign laborers in the Reich to fight against Bolshevism. Martin Bormann issued a memorandum on 5 May 1943:
In 1944, as the German army continually lost battles and territory to the Red Army, the leaders of Nazi Germany, especially Heinrich Himmler, recognized the political, ideological, and military value of the collaborationist ROA in fighting Bolshevism. Secretly, Himmler in his Posen speeches remarked: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have had any objections, if we had hired Mr. Vlasov and every other Slavic subject wearing a Russian general&#x27;s uniform, to make propaganda against the Russians. I wouldn&#x27;t have any objections at all. Wonderful.&quot;

===Implementation===


Nazi policies in German-occupied territories were marked by spontaneous adaptation, on-the-fly modifications, and bureaucratic competition, underscoring the impulsive nature of Hitlerism. Nazi Germany&#x27;s pursuit of its bio-geo-political ambitions was carried out through fanatical perpetration of a racist war of annihilation (&quot;Vernichtungskrieg&quot;) which inflicted industrial-scale terrorism against entire populations. These policies resulted in the genocide of numerous ethnic groups in German-occupied territories, including the Jews, Poles, Russians, Romani people, etc. and also contributed to the failure of German war aims.

The Polish Campaign was Nazi Germany&#x27;s first implementation of policy, beginning with the Occupation of Poland (1939–1945). In October 1939, Heinrich Himmler became the Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood, tasked with returning all ethnic Germans () to the , preventing harmful foreign influences upon the German people, and creating new settlement areas (especially for returning ).

From mid–1940, the ethnic cleansing (forcible removal) of Poles from the initially occurred across the border, to the General Government (a colonial political entity ostensibly autonomous of the Reich); then, after the invasion of the USSR, the displaced Polish populations were jailed in (Pole-storage camps) in Silesia and sent to villages designated as ghettoes. In four years of Germanisation (1940–44), the Nazis forcibly removed some 50,000 ethnic Poles from the Polish territories annexed to the Greater German , notably some 18,000–20,000 ethnic Poles from Żywiec County, in Polish Silesia, effected in Action Saybusch.

The Nazi invasion of Poland consisted of atrocities committed against Polish men, women, and children. The German population&#x27;s psychological acceptance of the atrocities was achieved with Nazi propaganda (print, radio, cinema), a key factor behind the manufactured consent that justified German brutality towards civilians; by continually manipulating the national psychology, the Nazis convinced the German people to believe that Slavs and Jews were &quot;Untermenschen&quot;. For example, leaders of the Hitler Youth were issued pamphlets (such as &quot;On the German People and its Territory&quot;) meant to influence the rank-and-file Hitler Youth about the necessity of Nazi racist practices in obtaining for the German people. Likewise, in the proper, schoolchildren were given propaganda pamphlets (such as &quot;You and Your People&quot;) explaining the importance of for the future of Germany and the German people.

On 21 June 1941, Himmler commissioned the drafting of &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot; (GPO), which was to be the blue-print of German expansionist and extermination policies in Eastern Europe. The draft, which was based on the proposals of Nazi agronomist Konrad Meyer, were forwarded to Hitler for approval. On 16 July 1941, Hitler appointed Alfred Rosenburg as Reich Minister for Occupied Eastern Territories, giving him directives to monitor SS activities. GPO was approved by Hitler&#x27;s orders in May 1942 and became the official occupation program of Nazi Germany in July 1942. The program launched the genocide of millions of Slavs, Jews, Romani people, etc. through various methods like mass-killings, forced starvations, extermination through slave labour, etc. Ethnic cleansing was initiated to forcibly displace remaining non-Germanic inhabitants eastwards. Under the objectives of &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;, the evacuated territories were to be colonized by over 10 million German settlers and establish the blueprint for a Greater Germanic Reich. Germanization campaigns were extolled in Nazi propaganda as the modern adaptation of what it portrayed as &quot;civilizing missions&quot; of the Teutonic Order.

===East–West frontier===
Concerning the geographic extent of the Greater Germanic , Adolf Hitler rejected the Ural Mountains as an adequate eastern border for Germany, arguing that such mid-sized mountains would not suffice as the boundary between the &quot;European and Asiatic worlds&quot;, and that only a living wall of racially pure Aryans would suffice as a border. He also advocated that permanent war in the East would &quot;preserve the vitality of the race&quot;:

In 1941, the Reich decided that within two decades, by the year 1961, Poland would have been emptied of Poles and re-populated with ethnic-German colonists from Bukovina, Eastern Galicia, and Volhynia. The ruthless Germanisation that Hitler enacted for was attested in the reports of (soldier–peasant) colonists assigned to ethnically-cleansed Poland—of finding half-eaten meals on the table and unmade beds in the houses given them by the Nazis. Baltic Germans from Estonia and Latvia were evaluated for racial purity; those classified to the highest category, , were resettled in the Eastern Wall.

Moreover, the Germanisation of Russia which began with Operation Barbarossa (June–September 1941) meant to conquer and colonise European Russia as the granary of Germany. For those Slavic lands, the Nazi theorist and ideologue Alfred Rosenberg proposed administrative organisation by the —countries consolidated into colonial realms ruled by a commissar:

In 1943, in the secret Posen speeches, Heinrich Himmler spoke of the Ural Mountains as the eastern border of the Greater Germanic Reich. He asserted that the Germanic race would gradually expand to that eastern border, so that, in several generations&#x27; time, the German , as the leading people of Europe, would be ready to &quot;resume the battles of destiny against Asia&quot;, which were &quot;sure to break out again&quot;; and that the defeat of Europe would mean &quot;the destruction of the creative power of the Earth&quot;. Nonetheless, the Ural Mountains were a secondary objective of the secret (Master Plan East) for the colonisation of Eastern Europe.

The never-established &quot;Reichskommissariat Turkestan&quot; would have been the closest territory to Imperial Japan&#x27;s north-westernmost extents of its own Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, as a &quot;living wall&quot; said to be defending the easternmost lands. It also would have elevated higher-social-class Chinese and nearly all Japanese-ethnicity populations as &quot;honorary Aryans&quot;, partly to Hitler&#x27;s own stated respect in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; towards those specific East Asian ethnicities.

The early stages of ( in the East) featured the ethnic cleansing of Russians and other Slavs (Galicians, Karelians, Ukrainians, et al.) from their lands, and the consolidation of their countries into the administration that extended to the Ural Mountains, the geographic frontier of Europe and Asia. To manage the ethnic, racial, and political populations of the USSR, the German Army promptly organized collaborationist, anti-Communist, puppet governments in the (1941–45) and the (1941–44). Nonetheless, despite the initial strategic successes of Operation Barbarossa, the Red Army&#x27;s counterattack victories against the German Army at the Battle of Stalingrad (August 1942 – February 1943) and at the Battle of Kursk (July–August 1943) in Russia, plus the Allied Operation Husky (July–August 1943) in Sicily, thwarted the full implementation of Nazi in Eastern Europe.

==Historical retrospective==
===Scale===
The scope of the enterprise and the scale of the territories invaded and conquered for Germanisation by the Nazis indicated two ideological purposes for , and their relation to the geopolitical purposes of the Nazis: (i) a program of global conquest, begun in Central Europe; and (ii) a program of continental European conquest, limited to Eastern Europe. From the strategic perspectives of the (&quot;Plan in Stages&quot;), the global- and continental-interpretations of Nazi are feasible, and neither exclusive of each other, nor counter to Hitler&#x27;s foreign-policy goals for Germany.

Within the Reich régime proper, the Nazis held different definitions of , such as the idyllic, agrarian society that required much arable land, advocated by the blood-and-soil ideologist Richard Walther Darré and Heinrich Himmler; and the urban, industrial state, that required raw materials and slaves, advocated by Adolf Hitler. Operation Barbarossa—the invasion of the Soviet Union in summer 1941—required a compromise of concept, purpose, and execution to realise Hitler&#x27;s conception of in the Slavic lands of Eastern Europe.

During the Posen speeches, Himmler spoke about the deaths of millions of Soviet prisoners of war and foreign labourers:

===Ideology===
Racism usually is not a concept integral to the ideology of territorial expansionism; nor to the original meaning of the term (&quot;biological habitat&quot;), as defined by the ethnographer and geographer Friedrich Ratzel. Nonetheless, Nazism, the ideology of the Nazi Party, established racism as a philosophic basis of -as-geopolitics; which Adolf Hitler presented as Nazi racist ideology in his political autobiography (1926–28). Moreover, the geopolitical interpretations of national living-space by the academic Karl Haushofer (a teacher of Rudolf Hess, Hitler&#x27;s deputy) provided Adolf Hitler with the intellectual, academic, and scientific rationalisations that justified the territorial expansion of Germany—by the natural right of the German Aryan race—to expand into, occupy, and exploit the lands of other countries, regardless of the native populations. In , Hitler explained the living-space &quot;required&quot; by Nazi Germany:

=== Factor that played a role in Germany&#x27;s defeat ===
Several historians have evaluated the Nazi pursuit of &quot;Lebensraum&quot; as a reckless endeavor that played a role in Germany&#x27;s military defeat during the Second World War. As the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; began capturing vast swathes of territories in Eastern Europe during the early phase of the war, the bio-geo-political program of &quot;Lebensraum&quot; led to the intensification of self-destructive policies by Nazi military forces, culminating in the genocide of Jews, Romanis, Slavs, etc., and eventually, the collapse of Nazi Germany itself. Elucidating the self-destructive characteristics of Nazi practices, historian Vejas Liulevicius wrote:
==Contemporary usages==
Since the end of World War II, the term has been used in relation to different countries, including China, Egypt, Israel, Turkey, Poland, and the United States.

<text>Tam Lin, also known as Tamas-Lin, Tamlane, Tamlene, Tamlin, Tambling, Tomlin, Tam-Lien, Tam-a-Line, Tam-Lyn or Tam-Lane, is a character in the legendary ballad originating from the Scottish Borders.

==History==
The story of Tam Lin [təm˧˧:ləŋ˧˧] revolves around the rescue of Tam Lin by his true love from the Queen of the Fairies. The motif of winning a person by holding him through all forms of transformation is found throughout Europe in folktales.

The story has been adapted into numerous stories, songs and films. It is also associated with a reel of the same name, which is also known as the &quot;Glasgow Reel&quot;.

Tam Lin is listed as the 39th Child Ballad and number 35 in the Roud Folk Song Index.
===Synopsis===
Most variants begin with the warning that Tam Lin collects either a possession or the virginity of any maiden who passes through the forest of Carterhaugh. When a young woman, usually called Janet or Margaret, goes to Carterhaugh and plucks a double rose, Tam appears and asks her why she has come without his leave and taken what is his. She states that she owns Carterhaugh because her father has given it to her.

In most variants, Janet then goes home and discovers that she is pregnant; some variants pick up the story at this point. When asked about her condition, she declares that her baby&#x27;s father is an elf whom she will not forsake. In some versions, she is informed of a herb that will induce abortion; in all the variants, when she returns to Carterhaugh and picks a plant, either the same roses as on her earlier visit or the herb, Tam reappears and challenges her action.

She asks him whether he was ever human, either after that reappearance or, in some versions, immediately after their first meeting resulted in her pregnancy. Tam Lin reveals that, though he was once a mortal man, he was imprisoned in Carterhaugh by the Queen of Faeries after she kidnapped him by catching him when he fell from his horse. He goes on to tell Janet that the fairies give one of their people as a teind (tithe) to Hell at midnight on every seventh Hallowe&#x27;en. He asks Janet for her help in freeing him, and receives her agreement; he then instructs her to come to the forest at the time of the tithe, during which he&#x27;ll be in the company of numerous faerie knights -- he tells her that she&#x27;ll recognize him by his white horse. Janet must pull him down from his horse, thus making her the one to &quot;catch&quot; him this time, and hold him tightly: he warns her that the fairies will attempt to make her drop him by turning him into all manner of beasts (see Proteus), but states that none of these forms will actually cause her harm. Tam Lin will eventually take the shape of burning coal; when this occurs, Janet is to throw him into a well, whereupon he will reappear as a naked mortal man whom Janet must hide. She does as she is asked and wins her knight; though her success angers the Queen of Faeries, the latter accepts her defeat.

In different variations, Tam Lin is reportedly the grandson of the Laird of Roxburgh, the Laird of Foulis, the Earl of Forbes, or the Earl of Murray. His name also varies between versions (Tam Lin being the most common) as Tom Line, Tomlin, Young Tambling, Tam-a-line and Tamlane.
===Early versions===
The ballad dates to at least as early as 1549 (the publication date of &quot;The Complaynt of Scotland&quot; that mentions &quot;The Tayl of the Ȝong Tamlene&quot; (&#x27;The Tale of the Young Tamelene&#x27;) among a long list of medieval romances). Michael Drayton&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;Nimphidia&quot; (1627) includes a character called Tomalin who is a vassal and kinsman of Oberon, King of the Fairies. Robert Burns wrote a version of Tam Lin based on older versions of the ballad, which was printed in James Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Scots Musical Museum&quot; (1796).

The story featured in several nineteenth century books of fairy tales under different titles :
* &quot;Elphin Irving, the Fairies&#x27; Cupbearer&quot; in &quot;Traditional Tales of the English and Scottish Peasantry&quot; by Allan Cunningham (1822)
* &quot;Wild Robin&quot; in &quot;Little Prudy&#x27;s Fairy Book&quot; by Sophie May (1866).
* &quot;Tamlane&quot; in &quot;More English Fairy Tales&quot; by Joseph Jacobs (1893).

Francis James Child collected fourteen traditional variants in &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads&quot; in the nineteenth century. (Another Child ballad, &quot;Burd Ellen and Young Tamlane&quot;, has no connection with this ballad except for the similarity of the heroes&#x27; names.)

===Motifs===
Child took the threat to take out Tam Lin&#x27;s eyes as a common folklore precaution against mortals who could see fairies, in the tales of fairy ointment. Joseph Jacobs interpreted it as rather a reversal of the usual practice; the Queen of Faeries would have kept him from seeing the human woman who rescued him.

In some variants, &quot;Hind Etin&quot; has verses identical to this for the first meeting between the hero and the heroine.

==Influences==
===Field recordings===
The ballad has been recorded several times from Scottish and Northern Irish people who learned it in the oral tradition. Eddie Butcher of Magilligan, County Londonderry knew a fragment of the ballad which can be heard via the Irish Traditional Music Archive, and Paddy Tunney of Mollybreen, County Fermanagh sang a version to Hugh Shields in 1968. In Scotland, Duncan Williamson of Auchtermuchty, Fifeshire, William Whyte of Aberdeen and Betsy Johnston of Glasgow all had traditional versions recorded, the latter two by Hamish Henderson.

===Popular recordings of the ballad===

Following are some of the notable recordings of the ballad, including their artists, titles, albums, and years:
Benjamin Zephaniah was awarded Best Original Song in the Hancocks 2008, Talkawhile Awards for Folk Music (as voted by members of Talkawhile.co.uk) for &quot;Tam Lyn Retold&quot;. He collected the award at The Cambridge Folk Festival on 2 August 2008.
