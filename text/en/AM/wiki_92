<text>Look Back is a 1967 American documentary film directed by D. A. Pennebaker that covers Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1965 concert tour in England.

In 1998, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In a 2014 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll, film critics voted &quot;Dont Look Back&quot; the joint ninth best documentary film of all time.

==Synopsis==
The opening scene of the film has Bob Dylan displaying and discarding a series of cue cards bearing selected words and phrases from the lyrics to his 1965 song &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; (including intentional misspellings and puns). This was the first single from his most recent album, &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;, and a top ten hit in the UK when he filmed it there (a fact discussed in the film). Allen Ginsberg appears in the background having a discussion with Bob Neuwirth.

The film features Joan Baez, Donovan and Alan Price (who had just left the Animals), Dylan&#x27;s manager Albert Grossman and his road manager Neuwirth. Marianne Faithfull, John Mayall, Ginger Baker and Allen Ginsberg may also be glimpsed in the background. Notable scenes include:

*Dylan and Baez singing Hank Williams songs in a hotel room, as well as Baez singing the first few verses of &quot;Sally Go &#x27;Round the Roses&quot;, &quot;Percy&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word&quot; (which was still apparently unfinished at the time, as Baez later tells Dylan, &quot;If you finish it I&#x27;ll sing it on a record&quot;; she would record it on &quot;Any Day Now&quot; in 1968).
*Dylan&#x27;s pre-concert philosophical jousting with a &quot;science student&quot; (Terry Ellis, who later co-founded Chrysalis Records).
*Grossman negotiating with former bebop dance band leader and music agent Tito Burns.
*Dylan singing &quot;Only a Pawn in Their Game&quot; on July 6, 1963, at a Voters&#x27; Registration Rally in Greenwood, Mississippi (shot by artist and experimental filmmaker Ed Emshwiller).
*Dylan&#x27;s interrupting Alan Price&#x27;s backstage performance of &quot;Little Things&quot; to ask Price why he left the Animals.
*Dylan&#x27;s extended taunting of &quot;Time&quot;″s London arts and science correspondent Horace Freeland Judson who was subjected to what he believes to be a contrived tirade of abuse from Dylan. Dylan claims both that he is not a folk singer, and not a pop singer.
*A selection of songs from Dylan&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall performance.
*Dylan regaling the room with &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot; at Donovan&#x27;s request after proclaiming &quot;Hey, that&#x27;s a good song, man!&quot; during Donovan&#x27;s performance of &quot;To Sing for You&quot;.

==Title==

The original title of this film is &quot;Dont Look Back&quot;, without an apostrophe in the first word. D. A. Pennebaker, the film&#x27;s writer director, decided to punctuate the title this way because &quot;It was my attempt to simplify the language&quot;. Many sources, however, have assumed this to be a typographical error and have &quot;corrected&quot; the title to &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;. In the commentary track to the DVD release, Pennebaker said that the title came from the Satchel Paige quote, &quot;Don&#x27;t look back. Something might be gaining on you,&quot; and that Dylan shared this view.

==Production==
&quot;Dont Look Back&quot; was shot in black-and-white with a handheld 16mm-film camera and utilized direct sound, thus creating the template for the &quot;rockumentary&quot; film genre. Production began when Dylan arrived in England on April 26, 1965, and ended shortly after his final UK concert at the Royal Albert Hall on May 10. Pennebaker has stated that the famous &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; music video that is shown at the beginning of the film was actually shot at the very end of filming. Pennebaker decided during editing to place it at the beginning of the film as a &quot;stage&quot; for Dylan to begin the film.

==Release==
The film was first shown publicly May 17, 1967, at the Presidio Theater in San Francisco, and opened that September at the 34th Street East Theater in New York.

A transcript of the film, with photographs, was published in 1968 by Ballantine Books.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Dont Look Back&quot; has been very well received by critics. It has a rating of 91% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 55 reviews. The websites critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Dont [sic] Look Back&quot; leaves the mysteries of Dylan largely intact while offering a gripping verite-style account of a pivotal moment in his incredible career.&quot; The film received a 5-star review from AllMovie and has a Metacritic score of 84, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. In August 1967, a &quot;Newsweek&quot; reviewer wrote, &quot;&quot;Dont Look Back&quot; is really about fame and how it menaces art, about the press and how it categorizes, bowdlerizes, sterilizes, universalizes or conventionalizes an original like Dylan into something it can dimly understand&quot;.

Kurt Cobain identified it as the only &quot;good documentary about rock and roll&quot; in a 1991 interview with his Nirvana bandmates, a sentiment with which Dave Grohl concurred.

The film has been parodied and paid homage to by many other films and television shows including &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, &quot;Bob Roberts&quot;, and &quot;Documentary Now!&quot;. The opening sequence featuring &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; has likewise inspired many music videos, including INXS&#x27; &quot;Mediate&quot;, MC Evidence&#x27;s &quot;The Far Left,&quot; &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s &quot;Bob&quot; and Hozier&#x27;s &quot;Almost (Sweet Music),&quot; and was cited by journalist Roger Friedman as &quot;the most copied, most revered, music video of all time&quot;.

===Home media===
&quot;Dont Look Back&quot; has been released and re-released on home video in many formats, from VHS to Blu-ray, over the decades. A digitally remastered deluxe DVD edition was released on February 27, 2007. The two-disc edition contained the remastered film, five additional audio tracks, commentary by filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker and Tour Road Manager Bob Neuwirth, an alternative version of the video for &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;, the original companion book edited by D. A. Pennebaker to coincide with the film&#x27;s release in 1968, a flip-book for a section of the &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; video, and a brand new documentary by D. A. Pennebaker and edited by Walker Lamond called &quot;65 Revisited&quot;. The DVD packaging was also given new artwork.

On November 24, 2015, The Criterion Collection released a newly restored 4K transfer of the film on Blu-ray and DVD. The Criterion version contained new special features.

<doc id="73438" wikidata="Q478209" url="?curid=73438" title="Double Indemnity">
<text>Double Indemnity is a 1944 American film noir directed by Billy Wilder and produced by Buddy DeSylva and Joseph Sistrom. Wilder and Raymond Chandler adapted the screenplay from James M. Cain&#x27;s novel of the same name, which ran as an eight-part serial in &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine in 1936.

The film stars Fred MacMurray as insurance salesman Walter Neff, who plots with a woman (Barbara Stanwyck) to kill her husband in order to claim a life insurance payment, arousing the suspicion of claims manager Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). The title refers to a &quot;double indemnity&quot; clause which doubles life insurance payouts when death occurs in a statistically rare manner.

The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards. Widely regarded as a classic, it is often cited as having set the standard for film noir and as one of the greatest films of all time.

==Plot==

Wounded from a gunshot, insurance salesman Walter Neff stumbles into his Los Angeles office. He records a dictaphone confession for claims manager Barton Keyes.

One year earlier, Neff flirts with Phyllis Dietrichson during a house call about her husband&#x27;s automobile insurance. Phyllis asks about getting a policy on Mr. Dietrichson&#x27;s life without his knowledge; deducing that she is contemplating murder, Neff wants no part of it but is fascinated with her. Later, Phyllis visits his apartment, where he concocts a plan to make Dietrichson sign a life insurance policy without realizing it, murder him, and frame it as an accident in order to trigger the policy&#x27;s double indemnity clause.

Neff has Dietrichson sign the policy by convincing him that it is a copy of his automotive insurance renewal. Dietrichson unexpectedly breaks his leg before the murder can take place, delaying the scheme. Neff hides in the back seat of Phyllis&#x27; car while she drives Dietrichson to a train station. Neff breaks Dietrichson neck, leaving the dead body in the car with Phyllis, while he boards the train posing as the crippled Dietrichson. He jumps off the back of the train at a pre-arranged spot, where Phyllis helps him pose Dietrichson&#x27;s body on the tracks.

Neff&#x27;s boss believes the death was a suicide. Keyes scoffs at the idea, which he considers statistically implausible, but does find it strange that Dietrichson did not file a claim after breaking his leg. He begins to suspect that Phyllis and an accomplice had him murdered. Reasoning that Dietrichson was not aware of the policy due to his not filing a claim on the broken leg, the company refuses to pay out. Meanwhile, Phyllis&#x27; stepdaughter Lola befriends Neff. She tells him that she saw Phyllis trying on mourning clothes several days before Dietrichson&#x27;s death, and that she also suspects that Phyllis had killed her mother in order to marry Dietrichson. She now fears that Phyllis plans to kill her next.

Keyes finds a witness who says that the man he saw on the train was not Dietrichson. Neff warns Phyllis that pursuing the insurance claim in court risks exposing the murder, and insists that they should not see each other until the investigation ends. Neff learns that Nino, Lola&#x27;s ex-boyfriend, has been visiting Phyllis every night since the murder, and that Keyes suspects Nino of being her accomplice. Fearing for Lola&#x27;s life, Neff goes to confront Phyllis.

Neff tells Phyllis that he suspects her plan was to manipulate Nino into murdering Lola, and threatens to kill her. Phyllis shoots Neff, but when he comes closer and dares her to shoot again, she does not. She says that she never loved him &quot;until a minute ago, when I couldn&#x27;t fire that second shot.&quot; As they embrace, Neff shoots her twice with her gun. As Neff leaves, he sees Nino walking up to the house. Neff convinces Nino to call Lola and make up with her.

Neff finishes recording his confession and looks up to see Keyes watching him. Telling Keyes that he plans to flee to Mexico, he walks out of the office but collapses in the doorway. Keyes calls for an ambulance and the police, and the two wait for them to arrive.

===Background===
James M. Cain based his novella &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; on a 1927 murder perpetrated by Ruth Snyder, married to Albert Snyder, and her lover Henry Judd Gray, who colluded with an insurance agent to obtain a $45,000 policy with a double-indemnity clause without Albert&#x27;s knowledge and then have him murdered.

Cain had become a popular crime novelist following the publication of &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; in 1934, and &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; began making the rounds in Hollywood shortly after it was serialized in &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine in 1936. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Warner Bros., Paramount, 20th Century-Fox, and Columbia competed over the rights to adapt &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, but the fervor ended when Hays Office censor Joseph Breen warned in a letter to the studios:

The general low tone and sordid flavor of this story makes it, in our judgment, thoroughly unacceptable for screen presentation before mixed audiences in the theater. I am sure you will agree that it is most important...to avoid what the code calls &quot;the hardening of audiences,&quot; especially those who are young and impressionable, to the thought and fact of crime.

In 1943, Cain&#x27;s novella was anthologized with two others in &quot;Three of a Kind&quot;. Paramount&#x27;s Joseph Sistrom bought the rights for $15,000, envisioning Billy Wilder as the director of an adaptation. Paramount resubmitted the novella to the Hays Office and got an identical response as seven years earlier; Paramount then submitted a partial screenplay to the Hays Office. It was approved with three objections about portraying the disposal of a corpse, the gas chamber execution scene, and the skimpiness of the towel worn by the female lead.

Cain felt Joseph Breen owed him $10,000 for vetoing the purchase of the property for $25,000 in 1936.

===Writing===

The restrictions imposed by the Hays Code made adapting &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; a challenge. Wilder&#x27;s writing partner Charles Brackett helped with the treatment before bowing out. Wilder characterized their time apart: &quot;1944 was &#x27;The Year of Infidelities&#x27;...Charlie produced &quot;The Uninvited&quot;...I don&#x27;t think he ever forgave me. He always thought I cheated on him with Raymond Chandler.&quot;

Cain was Wilder&#x27;s first choice as a replacement for Brackett; Since Cain was working at 20th Century Fox, he was never asked to work on the film. Sistrom suggested Raymond Chandler, whose 1939 novel &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; he had admired.

New to Hollywood, Chandler demanded $1,000 and at least one week to complete the screenplay, not realizing he would be paid $750 per week and that it would take fourteen. Wilder characterized Chandler&#x27;s first draft as &quot;useless camera instruction&quot;; to teach Chandler screenwriting, Wilder gave him a copy of his script for &quot;Hold Back the Dawn&quot;. They did not get along during the next four months. Chandler quit once, submitting a long list of grievances about Wilder to Paramount. Chandler did agree to appear in the film, glancing up from a magazine as Neff walks outside Keyes&#x27; office; this is the only professional footage of him.

Chandler and Wilder made considerable changes to Cain&#x27;s story. Because the Hays Code demanded criminals pay onscreen for their transgressions, the double suicide at the end of the novella was not permissible. The solution was to have the two protagonists mortally wound each other. The character of Barton Keyes was changed from a fairly clueless colleague into a mentor and antagonist to Neff.

Chandler felt that Cain&#x27;s dialogue would not play well onscreen, but Wilder disagreed; after he hired contract players to read passages of Cain&#x27;s text aloud, he conceded to Chandler. Chandler also scouted for locations including Jerry&#x27;s Market on Melrose Avenue, where Phyllis and Walter discreetly meet to plan and discuss the murder.

Chandler was a recovering alcoholic. Wilder said that &quot;He was in Alcoholics Anonymous...I drove him back into drinking.&quot; An embittered Chandler wrote in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in November 1945 that &quot;The first picture I worked on was nominated for an Academy Award...but I was not even invited to the press review held right in the studio.&quot; Wilder responded, &quot;How could we? He was under the table drunk...&quot; Wilder&#x27;s experience with Chandler drew him to adapt Charles R. Jackson&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot;, about an alcoholic writer, as his next film; Wilder wanted the film &quot;to explain Chandler to himself.&quot; Library of America included the &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; screenplay in its second volume of Chandler&#x27;s work, &quot;Later Novels and Other Writings&quot; (1995).

Cain was impressed with the screenplay, calling it &quot;the only picture I ever saw made from my books that had things in it I wish I had thought of. Wilder&#x27;s ending was much better than my ending, and his device for letting the guy tell the story by taking out the office dictating machine – I would have done it if I had thought of it.&quot;

===Casting===
Sistrom and Wilder wanted Barbara Stanwyck to play Phyllis Dietrichson. She was the highest-paid woman in America. Stanwyck was reluctant to play a femme fatale, fearing it would have an adverse effect on her career. She recalled being &quot;a little afraid after all these years of playing heroines to go into an out-and-out killer.&quot; Wilder asked, &quot;Well, are you a mouse or an actress?&quot; She was grateful for his encouragement.

Alan Ladd, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Gregory Peck, and Fredric March all passed on the role of Neff. Wilder scraped &quot;the bottom of the barrel&quot; and approached George Raft. Since Raft did not read scripts, Wilder described the plot. Raft interrupted, &quot;Let&#x27;s get to the lapel bit...when the guy flashes his lapel, you see his badge, you know he&#x27;s a detective.&quot; Since Neff was not a cop, Raft turned the part down. This was the last in a series of films Raft declined which turned out to be classics. Wilder realized the part needed someone who could play a cynic and a nice guy simultaneously.

Fred MacMurray was accustomed to playing &quot;happy-go-lucky good guys&quot; in light comedies. In 1943, he was the highest-paid actor in Hollywood. When Wilder approached him about the role, MacMurray said, &quot;You&#x27;re making the mistake of your life!&quot; He felt he lacked the skill for a serious part, but Wilder pestered the actor until he relented. MacMurray felt Paramount would never let him play a &quot;wrong&quot; role, because the studio carefully crafted his image. Paramount let him take the unsavory role, hoping to teach him a lesson during negotiations for his contract renewal. MacMurray&#x27;s success in the role came as a surprise to both him and Paramount; he later recalled that he &quot;never dreamed it would be the best picture [he] ever made.&quot;

Edward G. Robinson was reluctant to step down to third billing as Barton Keyes, reflecting that &quot;At my age, it was time to begin thinking of character roles, to slide into middle and old age with the same grace as that marvelous actor Lewis Stone&quot;. Robinson agreed to take the role in part because he would receive the same salary as the two leads for fewer shooting days.

For Jean Heather as Lola it was her credited first film role, for Byron Barr as Nino it was his first film role ever, and for Tom Powers as Mr. Dietrichson it was his first film role since 1917.

===Filming===
Filming ran from September 27 to November 24, 1943. John F. Seitz was the premier director of photography at Paramount, having worked since the silent era. Seitz was nominated for an Academy Award for Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Five Graves to Cairo&quot; (1943). The director praised Seitz&#x27;s willingness to experiment. They gave the film a look reminiscent of German expressionist cinema, with dramatic deployment of light and shadows. Wilder recalled, &quot;Sometimes the rushes were so dark that you couldn&#x27;t see anything. He went to the limits of what could be done.&quot; Bright Southern California exteriors contrasted with gloomy interiors to suggest what lurked beneath the facade. The effect was heightened by dirtying up the set with overturned ashtrays and blowing aluminum particles into the air to simulate dust.

Seitz used &quot;Venetian blind&quot; lighting to simulate prison bars trapping the characters. Barbara Stanwyck reflected that &quot;the way those sets were lit, the house, Walter&#x27;s apartment, those dark shadows, those slices of harsh light at strange angles – all that helped my performance. The way Billy staged it and John Seitz lit it, it was all one sensational mood.&quot;

For Neff&#x27;s office at Pacific All Risk, Wilder and set designer Hal Pereira copied the Paramount headquarters in New York City as an inside joke at the studio&#x27;s expense.

Stanwyck wears a blonde wig &quot;to complement her anklet...and to make her look as sleazy as possible.&quot; Paramount production head Buddy DeSylva did not approve of the wig, remarking that &quot;We hired Barbara Stanwyck, and here we get George Washington.&quot; In response, Wilder insisted that the wig was &quot;meant to show that she&#x27;s a phony character and that all of her emotions are fraudulent&quot;. A week into filming, Wilder came to consider the wig a mistake, but too much of the film had been shot to remove it; he later referred to the use of the wig as the biggest mistake of his career.

Edith Head designed Barbara Stanwyck&#x27;s costumes. Her designs focus on bias-cut gowns, blouses with wide sleeves, and the waistline. Shoulder pads were the style of the 1940s, but they also accentuated the femme fatale&#x27;s power. In Stanwyck&#x27;s death scene, her wig and white jumpsuit contrast with Neff&#x27;s dark suit, creating a chiaroscuro effect.

When Phyllis and Walter dump the corpse on the tracks, they were supposed to get in their car and drive away. The crew shot the scene as written. As Wilder left the exterior location, however, his car would not start. He ordered the crew back and reshot the scene with Phyllis struggling to start her car. Wilder insisted MacMurray turn the ignition so slowly that the actor protested.

Wilder managed to bring the whole production in under budget at $927,262 despite $370,000 in salaries for just four people: $100,000 each for MacMurray, Stanwyck, and Robinson; $44,000 for Wilder&#x27;s writing plus $26,000 for his directing. Wilder considered &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; his best film because it had so few scripting and shooting errors. He marked Cain&#x27;s praise for &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; and Agatha Christie&#x27;s praise for his adaptation of &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; as two high points in his career.

===Original ending===
The screenplay ends with Keyes watching Neff&#x27;s execution in the gas chamber. Wilder shot the scene from Neff&#x27;s perspective, looking out of the gas chamber at Keyes. Wilder shot for five days and spent $150,000 on the scene, which he felt was one of the best he ever directed. Production stills of this scene exist, and the footage may still be in Paramount&#x27;s vaults.

However, the director ultimately decided to end the film with Keyes and Neff in their office, because &quot;You couldn&#x27;t have a more meaningful scene between two men...The story was between the two guys.&quot; Chandler objected to the change. Joseph Breen felt the execution was &quot;unduly gruesome&quot;, and its removal settled his office&#x27;s last issue with the film.

===Music===

Wilder liked Miklós Rózsa&#x27;s work on &quot;Five Graves to Cairo&quot; and hired him to score &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;. Wilder suggested a restless string figure to reflect the conspiratorial activities of Walter and Phyllis. He had in mind the opening of Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished Symphony&quot;, which is heard onscreen in the scene at the Hollywood Bowl. Rózsa liked the idea, and Wilder was enthusiastic about the score as it took shape.

Paramount&#x27;s music director Louis Lipstone reprimanded Rózsa for writing &quot;Carnegie Hall music&quot;; Rózsa mistook this as a compliment. Lipstone suggested he watch &quot;Madame Curie&quot; to learn how to properly score a film. He felt Rózsa&#x27;s music was more appropriate for &quot;The Battle of Russia&quot;. He expected Paramount&#x27;s artistic director Buddy DeSylva to agree, but when DeSylva heard the music, his only note was that there should be more of it. The score was nominated for an Academy Award, and the success brought Rózsa more studio work.

===Locations===
Exterior shots of the Dietrichson house in the film were shot at a Spanish Colonial Revival house on 6301 Quebec Drive in Beachwood Canyon. The production team copied the interior of the house, including the spiral staircase, on a Paramount soundstage.

The Southern Pacific Railroad station in Burbank was used in the film with a prop sign for Glendale; the site now hosts the Burbank Metrolink station. Walter Neff&#x27;s apartment building was located at 1825 North Kingsley Drive in Hollywood, and the Hollywood &amp; Western Building also appears in the film.

==Release==
&quot;Double Indemnity&quot;″s first theatrical engagement was at the Keith&#x27;s in Baltimore on July 3, 1944; the film opened nationwide three days later. It was an immediate hit with audiences despite a campaign against the film by singer Kate Smith. James M. Cain recalled that &quot;there was a little trouble caused by this fat girl, Kate Smith, who carried on a propaganda asking people to stay away from the picture. Her advertisement probably put a million dollars on its gross.&quot;

When &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; was released, David O. Selznick was promoting &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; with trade magazine ads that claimed its title had become &quot;the four most important words uttered in motion picture history since &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.&quot; Wilder riposted with an ad of his own claiming that &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; were the two most important words uttered in motion picture history since &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot;. Selznick was not amused, and threatened to stop advertising in any of the trades if they continued to run Wilder&#x27;s ads.

==Reception==
===Reviews===
Contemporary reviews of the film were largely positive, though its content made some uncomfortable. While some critics found the story implausible and disturbing, others praised it as an original thriller. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther called the picture &quot;Steadily diverting, despite its monotonous pace and length.&quot; He complained that the two lead characters &quot;lack the attractiveness to render their fate of emotional consequence&quot;, but also felt the movie possessed a &quot;realism reminiscent of the bite of past French films&quot;.

Film critic and author &quot;James Agee&quot; reviewed it in 1944: &quot;In many ways &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; is really quite a gratifying and even a good movie, essentially cheap I will grant, but smart and crisp and cruel...&quot; &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;″s Howard Barnes wrote it was &quot;one of the most vital and arresting films of the year&quot;, praising Wilder&#x27;s &quot;magnificent direction and a whale of a script&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; felt it &quot;sets a new standard for screen treatment in its category&quot;.

Radio host and Hearst paper columnist Louella Parsons said, &quot;&quot;Double Indemnity&quot; is the finest picture of its kind ever made, and I make that flat statement without any fear of getting indigestion later from eating my words.&quot;

The &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; was highly complimentary, &quot;Besides MacMurray, who shows up as a top flight dramatic actor in a role that is a new type for him, and Miss Stanwyck, who has never given a more striking performance, &#x27;Double Indemnity&#x27; has a third standout star, Edward G. Robinson, in his best role in many a film...By the way, there&#x27;s no need to warn the teenagers away from this one; they wouldn&#x27;t skip it in any case, and besides, &#x27;Double Indemnity&#x27; makes it beautifully clear that murder doesn&#x27;t pay—and certainly the insurance company doesn&#x27;t, without sharp investigation.&quot;

In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Philip K. Scheur ranked it with &quot;The Human Comedy&quot;, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; as Hollywood trailblazers. Alfred Hitchcock wrote to Wilder saying, &quot;Since &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, the two most important words in motion pictures are &#x27;Billy&#x27; and &#x27;Wilder&#x27;.&quot;

The film&#x27;s critical reputation has only grown over the years. In 1977, Leslie Halliwell raved, &quot;Brilliantly filmed and incisively written, perfectly capturing the decayed Los Angeles atmosphere of a Chandler novel, but using a simpler story and more substantial characters.&quot; In a 1998 review for his &quot;Great Films&quot; series, Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;The photography by John F. Seitz helped develop the noir style of sharp-edged shadows and shots, strange angles and lonely Edward Hopper settings.&quot; Film critic &quot;Pauline Kael&quot;: &quot;...this shrewd, smoothly tawdry thriller is one of the high points of 40s films.&quot;

In &quot;Empire&quot;, Rob Fraser enthused, &quot;Film noir at its finest, a template of the genre, etc. Billy Wilder in full swing, Barbara Stanwyck&#x27;s finest hour, and Fred MacMurray makes a great chump.&quot;

The film holds a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 105 reviews. It scores 95/100 based on 18 reviews on Metacritic.

===Accolades===
Filmed and released during the dark days of World War II, the film was not popular with the Academy. Wilder went to the awards ceremony expecting to win. The studio had been backing its other big hit of the year, Leo McCarey&#x27;s &quot;Going My Way&quot;, and their employees were expected to vote for the studio favorite. As &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; kept losing during the awards show, it became evident that there would be a &quot;Going My Way&quot; sweep. When McCarey was named Best Director, a bitter Wilder tripped him on his way to accept the award. After the ceremony, Wilder yelled so everyone could hear him, &quot;What the hell does the Academy Award mean, for God&#x27;s sake? After all – Luise Rainer won it two times. Luise Rainer!&quot;

===Legacy===
The U.S. Library of Congress selected &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1992.

==Film noir==
&quot;Double Indemnity&quot; is a seminal example of film noir. It is often compared with Wilder&#x27;s other acclaimed film noir &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950). Film scholar Robert Sklar explains, &quot;[T]he unusual juxtaposition of temporalities gives the spectator a premonition of what will occur/has occurred in the flashback story...Besides &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; and &quot;Detour&quot;, voice-over is a key aspect of &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, &quot;Gilda&quot;, &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot;, and &quot;Out of the Past&quot;...as well as many others.&quot; Critic and writer Wendy Lesser notes that the narrator of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; is dead before he begins narrating, but in &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, &quot;the voice-over has a different meaning. It is not the voice of a dead man...it is...the voice of an already doomed man.&quot;

Wilder claimed that &quot;I never heard that expression film noir when I made &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;...I just made pictures I would have liked to see. When I was lucky, it coincided with the taste of the audience. With &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, I was lucky.&quot;

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot; twice adapted &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; as a radio drama. Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck reprised their roles in the first broadcast on March 5, 1945. Stanwyck appeared again on the February 16, 1950 version, this time opposite Robert Taylor.

On October 15, 1948, &quot;Ford Theatre&quot; produced another radio adaptation with Burt Lancaster and Joan Bennett. &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; broadcast one with MacMurray and Stanwyck on October 30, 1950.

The movie was remade as a television film, with direction by Jack Smight and a teleplay adapted by Steven Bochco. It aired on ABC on October 13, 1973.

&quot;Double Indemnity&quot; is parodied in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Instinct&quot;. The hero&#x27;s wife conspires to have him shot on a moving train and fall into a lake so that she can collect on his insurance, which has a &quot;triple indemnity&quot; rider. Carol Burnett parodied the film as &quot;Double Calamity&quot; on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;.

==Imitators==
After the success of &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, imitators were rampant. In 1945, Producers Releasing Corporation, one of the B movie studios of Hollywood&#x27;s Poverty Row, financed &quot;Single Indemnity&quot; starring Ann Savage and Hugh Beaumont. Marketed as &quot;Apology for Murder&quot;, Paramount was not fooled by the title change and obtained an injunction against the film&#x27;s release that still remains in effect.

So many imitations flooded the market that Cain believed he deserved credit and remuneration. Cain was also disaffected about the extortionate practices of the film studios which could pay writers thousands of dollars for a copyright and earn millions from the resulting movie. He led a movement within the Screen Writers Guild to create the American Author&#x27;s Authority, a union that would own its members&#x27; works, negotiate better subsidiary deals, and protect against copyright infringement. The AAA never got off the ground, partially due to the growing momentum of the Red Scare.

<text>Duck Amuck is an American animated surreal comedy short film directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese. The short was released on February 28, 1953, as part of the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series, and stars Daffy Duck.

In the cartoon, Daffy Duck is tormented by an unseen, mischievous animator, who constantly changes Daffy&#x27;s locations, clothing, voice, physical appearance, and even shape, much to Daffy&#x27;s aggravation, embarrassment, and finally rage. Pandemonium reigns throughout the cartoon as Daffy attempts to steer the action back to some kind of normality, only for the animator to either ignore him or, more frequently, to over-literally interpret his increasingly frantic demands. In the end, the tormenting animator is revealed to be Bugs Bunny.

In 1994, it was voted #2 of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field, behind only &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot;, also directed by Jones and written by Maltese. In 1999, &quot;Duck Amuck&quot; was added to the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

The short inspired the 2007 Nintendo DS game &quot;Looney Tunes: Duck Amuck&quot;.

== Plot ==
The cartoon&#x27;s title sequence and opening scene suggest Daffy Duck is to star as a musketeer, and he appears, boldly engaging in an action scene with a fencing foil. As he thrusts the foil and advances, the background abruptly disappears, leaving a plain white screen. Confused by this, Daffy turns to the animator and asks them to complete the scenery. However, the animator fills in a new background that has nothing to do with the previous scene. Daffy returns and starts to repeat his opening scene, but quickly notices the different background and leaves, returning in a different costume and altering his performance to match the new scene. The animator substitutes several different unrelated backgrounds, each time prompting Daffy to change costumes until the background finally disappears completely again.

While Daffy tries to reason with the animator, he becomes completely erased and, upon asking where he is, he gets redrawn as a cowboy with a guitar. Daffy tries to play it, but there is only silence. Using a sign (&quot;sound please&quot;), he requests sound and is granted various non-guitar sound effects. Daffy also finds himself generating random sound effects when he tries to speak, and finally regains his voice when he becomes enraged and shouts angrily at the animator.

Regaining his composure, Daffy demands some new scenery and is given an amateurish line-art cityscape background in pencil. Daffy unpleasantly asks for color, prompting the animator to slap various colors and patterns all over him, for which he harshly scolds the animator. All but Daffy&#x27;s eyes and beak is erased and, upon asking where the rest of him has gone, he is redrawn as a bizarre mismatched creature. As Daffy walks off, he becomes aware of not feeling quite like himself; the animator creates a mirror and, upon seeing his hideous self, Daffy shrieks in alarm before scolding the animator again. Everything is erased and Daffy is redrawn this time in a sailor suit. Daffy seems to be pleased with this and begins to sing &quot;The Song of the Marines&quot; as the animator draws an ocean scene with an island in the background, but draws nothing under Daffy, resulting in him falling into the ocean and surfacing on the island. When he requests a close-up, the screen contracts around him, at which he says that is not a close-up and screams for a proper close-up; the camera zooms up uncomfortably close to his angry bloodshot eyes. He walks away muttering a sarcastic thanks to the animator.

As Daffy tries once again to negotiate with the animator to have an understanding, a black curtain falls on him. After failing to keep the curtain up with a stick (and trying to push the curtain up), Daffy goes ballistic and rips it apart. Now at the end of his rope, Daffy demands for the cartoon to resume, only to become even more frustrated when the animator attempts to end it. Daffy suggests that he and the animator go their separate ways and, hoping against hope that nothing further will happen, begins a dance routine which is quickly interrupted when the film runs out of alignment, resulting in two Daffys on the screen. They argue with each other and almost start a fight, but one Daffy is quickly erased just before the other attempts to get physical.

Daffy is then drawn into an airplane, which he excitedly flies around in until a mountain is drawn in his path. The plane crashes into it (off-screen), leaving Daffy with nothing but the plane&#x27;s steering wheel and windshield. He jumps out of the plane&#x27;s remains and floats downward with his parachute, which is replaced with an anvil. Crashing to the ground, a disoriented Daffy hammers the anvil while dizzily reciting &quot;The Village Blacksmith&quot;. The animator changes the anvil into an artillery shell, which explodes after a few more hammer strikes. Daffy finally snaps and angrily demands to know who is responsible and who the animator is, only to have the animator draw a door which closes on Daffy. The camera pulls back and the animator is revealed to be Bugs Bunny at a drawing table, who turns around and says to the audience, &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a stinker?&quot;.

== Voice cast and additional crew ==

== History ==

&quot;Duck Amuck&quot; is included in the compilation film &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie,&quot; along with other Chuck Jones cartoons including &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot;

Mel Blanc performed the voices. It was directed by Chuck Jones with a story by Michael Maltese. The film contains many examples of self-referential humor, breaking the fourth wall. The cartoon&#x27;s plot was essentially replicated in one of Jones&#x27; later cartoons, &quot;Rabbit Rampage&quot; (1955), in which Bugs Bunny turns out to be the victim of the sadistic animator (Elmer Fudd).

The 1980 television special &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Easter Egg-citement&quot; (notably directed &amp; co-produced by Friz Freleng rather than Jones) features similar interactions between Daffy and an unseen animator in the opening credits and bridging sequences. A similar plot was also included in the episode &quot;Duck&#x27;s Reflucks&quot; of &quot;Baby Looney Tunes,&quot; in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. It is done once again with Daffy tormenting Bugs in the &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot; episode &quot;One Carroter in Search of an Artist&quot; (for this reason, this version has garnered the alternative name &quot;Rabbit Rampage II&quot; among series fans) with the technology updated and the pencil and paintbrush replaced by a digital pen, the victim is Bugs Bunny and the animator is Daffy Duck. The ending of the &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot; short &quot;Rage Rover&quot;, is a reference to the ending of &quot;Duck Amuck&quot;.

In issue #94 of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; comic, Bugs Bunny gets back at Daffy Duck by making him the victim, in switching various movie roles, from Duck Twacy in &quot;Who Killed Daffy Duck&quot;,&quot; a video game character, and a talk show host, and they always wind up with Daffy starring in &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (the story&#x27;s running gag). After this, Bugs comments, &quot;Eh, dis guy needs a new agent.&quot;

A Nintendo DS game was published based upon the short, where the player takes the role of the animator and is tasked with finding ways to anger Daffy. The game&#x27;s ending, triggered once the player sufficiently enrages Daffy enough, reveals that the animator is another Daffy.

A 2021 segment of the &quot;Animaniacs&quot; revival series titled &quot;Yakko Amakko&quot; parodies the plot of &quot;Duck Amuck&quot;, with Yakko Warner explicitly referencing the original 1953 cartoon.

== Reception ==
In 1999 the film was deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. This was the second of three animated shorts by Jones to receive this honor; the others are &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; (1957) and &quot;One Froggy Evening&quot; (1955).

Animation historian Greg Ford writes, &quot;The duck glowers directly at the camera, the eye contact always implicating us, the viewers, in the cartoon&#x27;s gleeful sadism. While Mel Blanc&#x27;s voice acting is masterful, writer Michael Maltese&#x27;s gags are great, Maurice Noble&#x27;s mismatched backgrounds are hilarious, and the Disney-derived yet highly defined &#x27;stop and start&#x27; animation executed by Ken Harris is extra crispy here, the film belongs to Chuck Jones. It&#x27;s as if the misadventures that Jones customarily plunged Daffy into throughout the decade have all converged in &quot;Duck Amuck&quot;.&quot;

== Home media ==
The short was included on Disc 2 of the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1&quot; DVD box set (with optional audio commentary by historian Michael Barrier), &quot;The Essential Daffy Duck&quot; DVD box set, and the &quot;Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 1&quot; Blu-ray box set.

<doc id="73440" wikidata="Q1125566" url="?curid=73440" title="Duck Soup (1933 film)">
<text>Duck Soup is a 1933 American pre-Code musical black comedy film written by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby (with additional dialogue by Arthur Sheekman and Nat Perrin) and directed by Leo McCarey. Released by Paramount Pictures on November 17, 1933, it stars the four Marx Brothers (Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo in his final film appearance) and also features Margaret Dumont, Louis Calhern, Raquel Torres and Edgar Kennedy. &quot;Duck Soup&quot; was the last of the five Marx Brothers films released by Paramount Pictures. In the film, Groucho portrays the newly installed president of the fictional country of Freedonia. Zeppo is his secretary, while Chico and Harpo are spies for the neighboring country of Sylvania. Relations between Firefly and the Sylvanian ambassador (Calhern) deteriorate during the film, eventually leading the two countries to war.

Compared to the Marx Brothers&#x27; previous films, &quot;Duck Soup&quot; was a financial disappointment, though not an outright box-office failure as is sometimes reported. The film opened to mixed reviews, although this by itself did not end the group&#x27;s association with Paramount. Bitter contract disputes, including a threat by the Marxes to leave and found their own production company, soured their negotiations with the studio just as &quot;Duck Soup&quot; went into production. After the film fulfilled their contractual obligations to Paramount, the Marxes and the studio agreed to part ways.

While contemporaneous critics of &quot;Duck Soup&quot; felt it did not quite rise to the level of its predecessors, critical and popular opinion has evolved and the film has since achieved the status of a classic. &quot;Duck Soup&quot; is now widely considered to be a masterpiece of comedy and the Marx Brothers&#x27; finest film.

In 1990, the United States Library of Congress deemed &quot;Duck Soup&quot; &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==Plot==
Wealthy widow Gloria Teasdale is asked to give twenty million dollars to the small, financially struggling nation of Freedonia; she agrees on the condition that Rufus T. Firefly is appointed the country&#x27;s leader. Meanwhile, Ambassador Trentino of neighboring Sylvania is scheming to provoke a revolution in Freedonia in order to annex it. He sends two spies, Chicolini and Pinky, to Freedonia to find out information about Firefly. To his disappointment, Chicolini and Pinky end up spying on the wrong man, but he agrees to give them another chance.

To collect information on Firefly, Chicolini and Pinky pose as peanut vendors and station their food cart outside of Firefly&#x27;s office. Firefly hires Chicolini as Freedonia&#x27;s Secretary of War. A short time later, Firefly&#x27;s secretary, Bob Roland, warns Firefly of this scheme. Roland advises Firefly to insult Trentino, hoping that he will slap Firefly in response; this would give Firefly an excuse to ban Trentino from the country. Firefly agrees to the plan, but after a series of personal insults exchanged with Trentino, the plan goes awry when Firefly slaps Trentino instead. The incident brings the two countries to the brink of war. Meanwhile, Firefly and Trentino both attempt to woo Mrs. Teasdale in the hopes of getting their respective hands on her late husband&#x27;s wealth.

Trentino learns from Sylvanian spy Vera Marcal that Freedonia&#x27;s plans of war are in Mrs. Teasdale&#x27;s possession, and tells Vera to assist Chicolini and Pinky in stealing the plans. Chicolini is eventually caught by Firefly and put on trial, during which Firefly again slaps Trentino. This causes Trentino to declare war on Freedonia; overcome with excitement, everyone at the trial then begins singing and dancing. Chicolini and Pinky join Firefly and Roland in the anarchic battle that follows.

Some time later, Freedonia is losing the war and army morale is breaking down amidst a series of violent mishaps. Firefly, Chicolini, Pinky, Roland, and Teasdale take refuge in Teasdale&#x27;s hideout, which is soon overrun by Sylvanian troops accompanied by Trentino. When the Freedonians recognize him, they pin him in a makeshift pillory and throw fruit at him. Trentino surrenders, but Firefly tells him that he will stay in the pillory &quot;till the fruit runs out&quot;. When Mrs. Teasdale victoriously begins singing the Freedonian national anthem, the four men start throwing fruit at her instead.

===Cast notes===
Comparing the original scripts with the finished film, most of the characters&#x27; initial scripted names were later changed. Only the names of Chicolini and Mrs. Teasdale were kept. Groucho&#x27;s character—originally named &quot;Rufus T. &quot;Firestone&quot;&quot;—eventually became Rufus T. Firefly, while the name of Harpo&#x27;s character—named Pinky in the final product—was given in the Paramount pressbook as &quot;Brownie&quot;. &quot;Ambassador Frankenstein of Amnesia&quot; was quickly changed to Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania. Zeppo&#x27;s character remained Firefly&#x27;s son until very late in production, finally becoming Bob Roland, his secretary; also, Mrs. Teasdale&#x27;s niece &quot;June Parker&quot; transformed into Vera Marcal, first introduced as Trentino&#x27;s &quot;niece&quot; before ultimately becoming his companion.

==Production notes==
===Development===
The Marx Brothers&#x27; previous film, &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;, had been Paramount&#x27;s highest-grossing film of 1932. Encouraged by this success, the studio suggested on August 2, 1932, that they rush out a follow-up. Already at this early stage, the story (provisionally entitled &quot;Oo La La&quot;) was set in a mythical kingdom. On August 11, 1932, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that production would commence in five weeks with the famed Ernst Lubitsch directing.

This was a turbulent time in the Marx Brothers&#x27; career. The Great Depression was raging and Paramount Pictures was attempting to stave off bankruptcy. A reorganization of the studio brought fears that money due the Marxes would never be paid; as a result, the Brothers threatened to leave Paramount and form their own company, Marx Bros., Inc. Their first planned independent production was a film adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway musical &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot;, with Norman McLeod leaving Paramount to direct. During late 1932 and early 1933, Groucho and Chico were also working on &quot;Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel&quot;, a radio show written by Nat Perrin and Arthur Sheekman; there was even, at one time, talk of casting the two as their radio characters for the new film, an idea that was eventually used by Perrin in the 1941 Marx Brothers film &quot;The Big Store&quot;.

By October 4, 1932, Arthur Sheekman, Harry Ruby, and Bert Kalmar began writing the screenplay for the next Paramount film, which was now called &quot;Firecrackers&quot;. Herman Mankiewicz was to supervise production, beginning in January 1933. By December 1932, &quot;Firecrackers&quot; had become &quot;Cracked Ice&quot;. Grover Jones was also reported to have contributed to the first draft by Ruby and Kalmar. In &quot;The Marx Brothers Encyclopedia&quot;, Glenn Mitchell says that &quot;the first script&#x27;s content is difficult to determine&quot;.

On January 18, 1933, Harry Ruby, Bert Kalmar and Grover Jones submitted to Paramount their &quot;Second Temporary Script&quot; for &quot;Cracked Ice&quot;, and Paramount announced that shooting would commence on February 15. This script shows that the basic plot of &quot;Duck Soup&quot; was in place. In February, Paramount announced that the title had been changed to &quot;Grasshoppers&quot; (&quot;because animal stories are so popular&quot;), and that filming was set back to February 20.

However, on May 11, 1933, the Marx Brothers&#x27; father Sam &quot;Frenchie&quot; Marx died in Los Angeles, and shortly afterward the contract dispute with Paramount was settled. The &quot;New York Post&quot; reported on May 17 that the Brothers would make a new comedy for Paramount, called &quot;Duck Soup&quot;. Leo McCarey was set for direction of the film. Three days later &quot;The New York Sun&quot; reported that &quot;Duck Soup&quot; would start filming in June. &quot;Duck Soup&quot;″s script was completed by July 11. The script was a continuation of Ruby and Kalmar&#x27;s &quot;Firecrackers&quot;/&quot;Cracked Ice&quot; drafts, but contained more elements. Many of the film&#x27;s clever gags and routines were lifted from &quot;Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel&quot;, giving Perrin and Sheekman an &quot;additional dialogue&quot; credit.

===Title===
Director McCarey reportedly came up with the title for the film, having previously used it for an earlier directorial effort with Laurel and Hardy. This continued the &quot;animal&quot; titles of the Brothers&#x27; previous three films, &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;, &quot;Monkey Business&quot; and &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;.

&quot;Duck soup&quot; was American English slang referring to something easy to do. Conversely, &quot;to duck something&quot; meant to avoid it. When Groucho was asked for an explanation of the title, he quipped, &quot;Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together. After one taste, you&#x27;ll duck soup for the rest of your life.&quot;

McCarey also thought up &quot;the very Laurel &amp; Hardy-like sequence in which Harpo and Chico stage a break-in at Mrs Teasdale&#x27;s house.&quot; Another McCarey contribution was the &quot;mirror scene&quot;, a revival of an old Marx Brothers vaudeville act.

===Mirror scene===
In the &quot;mirror scene&quot;, Pinky, dressed as Firefly, pretends to be Firefly&#x27;s reflection in a missing mirror, matching his every move—including absurd ones that begin out of sight—to near perfection. At one point, the two men swap positions, introducing the question of which is the reflection. Eventually, Chicolini, also disguised as Firefly, enters the frame and collides with both of them.

Although its appearance in &quot;Duck Soup&quot; is the best known instance, the concept of the mirror scene did not originate in this film. Harold Lloyd used essentially the same routine in his short &quot;The Marathon&quot; (1919). Max Linder included it in &quot;Seven Years Bad Luck&quot; (1921), where a man&#x27;s servants have accidentally broken a mirror and attempt to hide the fact by imitating his actions in the mirror&#x27;s frame. Charlie Chaplin used a similar joke in &quot;The Floorwalker&quot; (1916), though it did not involve a mirror.

This scene has been imitated many times; for instance, in the Bugs Bunny cartoon &quot;Hare Tonic&quot;, the Mickey Mouse cartoon &quot;Lonesome Ghosts&quot;, &quot;The Square Peg&quot; (1959), &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (1963), the Tom and Jerry cartoon &quot;Cat and Dupli-cat&quot; (1967), &quot;Big Business&quot; (1988), the &quot;X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Dreamland&quot; (1998), &quot;&quot; (2006) and the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Road to Germany&quot;. Harpo himself did a reprise of this scene, dressed in his usual costume, with Lucille Ball also donning the fright wig and trench coat, in the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episode &quot;Lucy and Harpo Marx&quot;.

===Other scenes and jokes===
The climactic production number ridicules war by comparing nationalism to a minstrel show. One segment is a variant on the old Negro spiritual &quot;All God&#x27;s Chillun Got Wings&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;They got guns,
We got guns,
All God&#x27;s chillun got guns!
I&#x27;m gonna walk all over the battlefield,
&#x27;Cause all God&#x27;s chillun got guns!&lt;/poem&gt;
(The song makes a reprise in the 1937 Marx Brothers film &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; as &quot;All God&#x27;s Chillun Got Rhythm&quot; in the Lindy Hop production number.)

Another repeated gag involved Harpo, who drives a motorcycle with a sidecar, as a chauffeur, to transport Groucho. Twice, after Groucho gives the orders to Harpo, Harpo rides his motorcycle away, leaving Groucho stranded in the sidecar. Later, Groucho has Harpo sit in the sidecar, while Groucho gets on the motorcycle, the sidecar, with Harpo in it, rides off away, again, leaving Groucho stranded.

Shortly after, during the final battle scenes, &quot;rightfully [...] called the funniest of all of cinema&quot;, Firefly can be seen wearing a different costume in almost every sequence until the end of the film, including American Civil War uniforms (first Union and then Confederate), a British palace guard uniform, a Boy Scout Scoutmaster&#x27;s uniform, and even a Davy Crockett coonskin cap. Meanwhile, the exterior view of the building they are occupying changes appearance from a bunker to an old fort, etc. One of Firefly&#x27;s generals assures him that he has &quot;a man combing the countryside for volunteers.&quot; Sure enough, Pinky is wandering out on the front lines wearing a sandwich board sign reading, &quot;Join the Army and see the Navy.&quot; Later, Chicolini volunteers Pinky to carry a message through enemy lines; Firefly tells him, &quot;[...] and remember, while you&#x27;re out there risking life and limb through shot and shell, we&#x27;ll be in here thinking what a sucker &quot;you&quot; are.&quot; Thomas Doherty has described this line as &quot;sum[ming] up the Great War cynicism towards all things patriotic&quot;.

The melodramatic exclamation &quot;This means war!&quot; certainly did not originate with &quot;Duck Soup&quot;, but it is used several times in the film—at least twice by Trentino and once by Firefly—and was repeated by Groucho in &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; and &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;. Variations of this phrase later became a frequently used catch-phrase for Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny in Warner Bros. cartoons.

In another scene, the film pokes fun at the Hays Code. Due to the code, a man and woman could not be shown in bed together. The camera begins the scene in a woman&#x27;s bedroom, panning across the foot of the bed. A pair of men&#x27;s shoes are shown on the floor, then a pair of women&#x27;s shoes and then four horseshoes. The camera cuts to a shot of the entire room: Pinky is sleeping in one bed with the horse, while the woman is in another bed.

The film&#x27;s writers recycled a joke used in &quot;Horse Feathers&quot; in this dialogue with Chico:
Prosecutor: Chicolini, isn&#x27;t it true you sold Freedonia&#x27;s secret war code and plans?Chicolini: Sure! I sold a code and two pairs o&#x27; plans!

The street vendor confrontations are also well-crafted pieces of physical comedy: Chico and Harpo harass a lemonade seller (comedy film veteran Edgar Kennedy), egged on by his irritation that they have stolen his pitch.

First, there is a scene involving the knocking off, dropping, picking up and exchanging of hats. Later, Kennedy (a much larger man) steals bags of Harpo&#x27;s peanuts, and Harpo responds by burning Kennedy&#x27;s new straw boater hat; in return, Kennedy pushes over their peanut wagon. Harpo responds by stepping knee-deep into Kennedy&#x27;s lemonade tank, where he imitates a stereotypical Italian grape-crushing peasant; this drives off Kennedy&#x27;s waiting line of customers.

Just before the Mirror Scene is the Radio Scene. Harpo tries the combination to the safe on a box which proves to be a radio, and it starts blaring the break-up strain of John Philip Sousa&#x27;s &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;. The music continues despite frantic efforts to silence, and finally destroy, the radio, by throwing it out the window, shattering the glass.

Harpo often doffed his hat on-screen, but Chico very rarely removed his Tyrolean hat, even when indoors. For a few seconds on-screen in the earlier scene, Chico&#x27;s head is uncovered, revealing a wavy wig. Chico had already started going bald when the brothers appeared in their first Broadway production, &quot;I&#x27;ll Say She Is&quot;, in 1924. All of the Brothers&#x27; natural receding-hairline patterns were similar, but Harpo and Chico covered theirs with wigs (Groucho later sported an obvious toupee in the films &quot;At The Circus&quot; and &quot;Go West&quot;).

==Soundtrack==
Breaking with their usual pattern, neither Harpo&#x27;s harp nor Chico&#x27;s piano is used in the film, although Harpo briefly pretends to play harp on the strings of a piano.

The musical introduction to Groucho&#x27;s character is similar to those in &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; and &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;, but it did not become closely associated with him as did &quot;Hooray for Captain Spaulding&quot; from &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;.

Zeppo, playing according to James Agee &quot;a peerlessly cheesy improvement on the traditional straight man&quot;, sings with the group, including soloing the first few lines of the first song, &quot;When the Clock on the Wall Strikes 10&quot;. He also sings with the others in &quot;Freedonia&#x27;s Going to War&quot;, filling out the four-cornered symmetry as the Brothers sing and dance in pairs during the number.

===Original songs by Kalmar and Ruby===
The &quot;Freedonia National Anthem&quot; is used frequently throughout the film, both as vocal and instrumental; the entire song seems to consist of &quot;Hail, Hail, Freedonia, land of the brave and free&quot;, contrasting with the final line of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. The &quot;Sylvania theme&quot;, which sounds vaguely like &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;, is also used several times. &quot;When The Clock On The Wall Strikes 10&quot;, the first musical number in the film, is part of the same scene as &quot;Just Wait &#x27;Til I Get Through With It&quot;, Groucho&#x27;s song about the laws of his administration. &quot;This Country&#x27;s Going To War&quot; is the final musical ensemble in the film. Technically it is the only musical number in the Marx Brothers&#x27; films to feature all four of the brothers. However, in &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, Chico briefly bangs on the piano while the other three play saxophones while eluding their pursuers on an ocean liner.

The introductory scene, showing ducks swimming in a kettle and quacking merrily, is scored with an instrumental medley of the aforementioned songs, and it is also the only scene in the film that has to do with ducks and soup.

===Non-original music===
* &quot;Military Polonaise&quot; (Chopin) – played over newspaper headline of Firefly&#x27;s appointment as president of Freedonia
* &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Hornpipe&quot;; &quot;Dixie&quot; – short segments embedded in &quot;These Are the Laws of My Administration&quot;
* &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf&quot; – music box, accompanied by Harpo on (simulated) harp, briefly; a few minutes later, in another scene, Groucho says &quot;I&#x27;ll huff and I&#x27;ll puff and I&#x27;ll blow your door in&quot; after he is locked in a closet. Walt Disney filed a lawsuit against Paramount Pictures, for using the song without permission, resulting in Disney winning the financial damages in a settlement.
* &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; (Sousa) – on radio, turned on (loudly) by Harpo, who mistakes it for a safe
* &quot;American Patrol&quot; (Frank W. Meacham) – three of the Brothers playing soldiers&#x27; helmets like a xylophone as they march by, while Harpo clips off the decorative tassels (part of a running gag in the film)
* &quot;All God&#x27;s Chillun Got Guns&quot; (parody of &quot;All God&#x27;s Chillun Got Wings&quot;); &quot;Oh Freedonia&quot; (parody of &quot;Oh! Susanna&quot;); &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; (instrumental) – embedded in &quot;Freedonia&#x27;s Going to War&quot;
* &quot;Light Cavalry Overture&quot; (Franz von Suppé) – Harpo galloping on horseback a la Paul Revere
* &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Sweet&quot; (Milton Ager/Jack Yellen) – Harpo watching girl in window
* &quot;Goodnight, Sweetheart&quot; (Ray Noble) – Harpo and same girl (Edgar Kennedy&#x27;s character&#x27;s wife)
*Generic cavalry charge – Harpo with horn, in bathtub with Edgar Kennedy
* &quot;One Hour With You&quot; (Oscar Straus/Richard A. Whiting) – Harpo with another girl and his horse — segué into a bit of &quot;The Old Gray Mare&quot;
* &quot;El manisero&quot; (Moisés Simons) – half-sung, half-muttered by Groucho to himself at various points

==Reception==
Although &quot;Duck Soup&quot; did not perform as well as &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;, it was the sixth-highest-grossing film of 1933, according to Glenn Mitchell in &quot;The Marx Brothers Encyclopedia&quot; and Simon Louvish in &quot;Monkey Business&quot;. However, the film was a box office disappointment for Paramount.

One possible reason for the film&#x27;s lukewarm reception is that it was released during the depths of the Great Depression. Audiences were taken aback by its cynicism at a time of economic and political crisis. According to Leonard Maltin in &quot;The Great Movie Comedians&quot;:
As wonderful as &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;, and &quot;Duck Soup&quot; seem today, some critics and moviegoers found them unpleasant and longed for the more orderly world of &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; with its musical banalities. [...] Many right-thinkers laughed themselves silly in 1933—but a large number didn&#x27;t. [...] The unrelieved assault of Marxian comedy was simply too much for some people.

Years later, Groucho&#x27;s son Arthur Marx described Irving Thalberg&#x27;s assessment of the film&#x27;s purported failure during a National Public Radio interview:
[Thalberg] said the trouble with &quot;Duck Soup&quot; is you&#x27;ve got funny gags in it, but there&#x27;s no story and there&#x27;s nothing to root for. You can&#x27;t root for the Marx Brothers because they&#x27;re a bunch of zany kooks. [Thalberg] says, &quot;You gotta put a love story in your movie so there&#x27;ll be something to root for, and you have to help the lovers get together.&quot;

Most critics at the time disliked &quot;Duck Soup&quot; because of its &quot;dated&quot; look at politics. Christopher Null believes that &quot;the send-up of Mussolini-types doesn&#x27;t quite pan out. Take the comedy, leave the story.&quot;

Groucho did not initially think highly of the film. When asked the significance of the film&#x27;s politics, Groucho only shrugged and said: &quot;What significance? We were just four Jews trying to get a laugh.&quot; Nevertheless, the Brothers were ecstatic when Mussolini took the film as a personal insult and banned it in Italy. Residents of Fredonia, New York, also protested the film because they feared that the similar-sounding nation would hurt their city&#x27;s reputation. The Marx Brothers quipped in response, telling them to change the name of their town to keep from hurting their movie.

Despite the tepid critical and commercial response at the time, &quot;Duck Soup&quot; is now seen as a classic political farce. Film critic Danel Griffin believes that &quot;Duck Soup&quot; is &quot;on par with other war comedies like Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; and Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, only slightly more unnerving in that &quot;Duck Soup&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to realize it is anything more than innocent fluff.&quot; Fellow film critic Roger Ebert believed, &quot;The Marx Brothers created a body of work in which individual films are like slices from the whole, but &quot;Duck Soup&quot; is probably the best.&quot; British film critic Barry Norman considered &quot;Duck Soup&quot; the Marx Brothers&#x27; best work, and included it in his list of the 100 best films of the 20th century.

Revived interest in the film during the 1960s and &#x27;70s dovetailed with the counterculture of the era. American literary critic Harold Bloom considers the end of &quot;Duck Soup&quot; one of the greatest works of American art produced in the 20th century.

In 1990, &quot;Duck Soup&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2000, readers of &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine voted &quot;Duck Soup&quot; the 29th greatest comedy film of all time. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 91% rating based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 9.2/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Fueled by inspired silliness and blessed with some of the Marx brothers&#x27; most brilliant work, &quot;Duck Soup&quot; is one of its – or any – era&#x27;s finest comedies&quot;. It is also one of the earliest films to appear on Roger Ebert&#x27;s list of &quot;The Great Movies&quot;.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movies – #85
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Laughs – #5
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – #60

===Influence===
The United States Library of Congress has added &quot;Duck Soup&quot; to the National Film Registry, and the film was included in both the original (1998) broadcast of AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movies and the 2007 update.

Another testament to &quot;Duck Soup&quot;″s legacy is its influence on Woody Allen&#x27;s films. Near the end of Allen&#x27;s &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986), a chance screening of &quot;Duck Soup&quot; convinces Allen&#x27;s character that life is still worth living, and he abandons his suicidal impulses. His earlier &quot;Bananas&quot; (1971), a film chronicling the humorous rise of an unlikely dictator, has been dubbed a &quot;spiritual sequel to &quot;Duck Soup&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Duck Soup&quot; is also frequently cited as a major influence on the comedic side of The Beatles, and The Beatles themselves admitted that it was an inspiration for their film &quot;Help!&quot;

The film has influenced animation as well, with homages appearing in various animated television series. It was spoofed in &quot;Animaniacs&quot; as the full-episode sketch &quot;King Yakko&quot;. One specific gag from the original, the constant singing of the Freedonian national anthem, was spoofed in particular with a Perry Como caricature. Groucho&#x27;s entrance in the film was borrowed in another &quot;Animaniacs&quot; cartoon, &quot;The Three Muska-Warners&quot;.

The film also inspired parts of Sacha Baron Cohen&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;The Dictator&quot;. A critic for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; noted that &quot;Admiral General Aladeen and Rufus T. Firefly share the same bloodline, representing a more generalized contempt for world leaders of any stripe, whether they don a &#x27;supreme beard&#x27; or a greasepaint moustache.&quot; The &quot;Nashville Scene&quot; considered the film to be &quot;an echo here of that funniest of xenophobe-baiting funnies, &quot;Duck Soup&quot;.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; claimed that Baron Cohen&#x27;s film &quot;dodges soothing convention and ultimately merits comparisons to The Marx Brothers&#x27; &quot;Duck Soup&quot; and Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;.&quot;

The company FASA, which publishes role-playing games, derives its name from an imaginary Freedonian version of NASA, the &quot;Freedonian Aeronautics and Space Administration&quot;.

==Home media==
Universal Home Video released &quot;Duck Soup&quot; on DVD, unrestored but uncut, as part of a two-disc box set &quot;The Marx Brothers: Silver Screen Collection&quot;, which includes also the Brothers&#x27; other Paramount films, &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot;, &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;, &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, and &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;. Reviewing the set, film critic Mark Bourne writes:

<doc id="73441" wikidata="Q11621" url="?curid=73441" title="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial">
<text>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (or simply E.T.) is a 1982 American science fiction film produced and directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Melissa Mathison. It tells the story of Elliott, a boy who befriends an extraterrestrial he names E.T. who has been stranded on Earth. Along with his friends and family, Elliott must find a way to help E.T. find his way home. The film stars Dee Wallace, Henry Thomas, Peter Coyote, Robert MacNaughton, and Drew Barrymore.

The film&#x27;s concept was based on an imaginary friend that Spielberg created after his parents&#x27; divorce. In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison and developed a new story from the unrealized project &quot;Night Skies&quot;. In less than two months, Mathison wrote the first draft of the script, titled &quot;E.T. and Me&quot;, which went through two rewrites. The project was rejected by Columbia Pictures, who doubted its commercial potential. Universal Pictures eventually purchased the script for $1 million. Filming took place from September to December 1981 on a budget of $10.5 million. Unlike most films, &quot;E.T.&quot; was shot in rough chronological order to facilitate convincing emotional performances from the young cast. The animatronics for the film were designed by Carlo Rambaldi.

&quot;E.T.&quot; premiered as the closing film of the Cannes Film Festival on May 26, 1982, and was released in the United States on June 11, 1982. The film was a smash hit at the box office, surpassing &quot;Star Wars&quot; to become the highest-grossing film of all time, a record it held for eleven years until Spielberg&#x27;s own &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; surpassed it in 1993. &quot;E.T.&quot; was near–universally acclaimed by critics, and is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. It received nine nominations at the 55th Academy Awards, winning Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, and Best Sound Editing in addition to being nominated for Best Picture and Best Director. It also won five Saturn Awards and two Golden Globe Awards. The film was re-released in 1985 and again in 2002 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, with altered shots, visual effects, and additional scenes. It was also re-released in IMAX on August 12, 2022, to celebrate its 40th anniversary. In 1994, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, who deemed it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

== Plot ==

A race of diminutive aliens visit Earth at night to gather plant specimens in a California forest. One alien, fascinated by the distant lights of a neighborhood, separates from the group, before U.S. government agents arrive and chase the startled creature. The aliens are forced to depart before the agents can find them, leaving their lone member behind. While the agents search the forest, the creature takes shelter in a shed belonging to the family of ten-year-old Elliott Taylor. Initially scared by the creature, who runs away, Elliott spends the following day leaving a trail of Reese&#x27;s Pieces to lure the alien back to the Taylor&#x27;s home, where he hides the creature in his room.

The following morning, Elliott feigns illness to stay off school and play with the creature, whom he dubs E.T. Elliott eventually introduces E.T. to his older brother, Michael, and five-year-old sister Gertie, who agree to keep E.T. hidden from their hardworking, single mother, Mary. When the children ask about his origins, E.T. displays telekinetic abilities by levitating several balls to represent his planetary system, and later demonstrates other extraordinary abilities by reviving a dead chrysanthemum and instantly healing a cut on Elliott&#x27;s finger. As Elliott and the creature begin to bond, they start to share thoughts and emotions, the two being simultaneously startled when E.T. accidentally opens an umbrella in a different room.

At school, Elliott becomes intoxicated because, at home, E.T. is drinking beer and watching television. Sensing E.T.&#x27;s desire to be rescued, Elliott impulsively frees the frogs about to be vivisected in his biology class, inspiring the other children to follow his lead, and romantically kisses a girl he likes because E.T. is watching John Wayne kiss Maureen O&#x27;Hara in &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952); Elliott is sent to the principal&#x27;s office for his disruptive behavior. Inspired by a Buck Rogers comic strip, depicting the character calling for help with a communication device, E.T. is inspired to build a makeshift device to &quot;phone home&quot;, using various parts around the Taylor home. E.T. also learns to speak English, and requests the children&#x27;s help to build the device. They agree to help find the missing components, unaware that the agents have become suspicious they are harboring the alien.

On Halloween, the children disguise E.T. as a ghost and Elliott sneaks E.T. into the forest, where they set up the device to call E.T.&#x27;s people. Elliott begs E.T. to stay on Earth with him, before falling asleep and waking alone in the forest the following morning. He returns home to his worried family, while Michael searches for E.T., finding him pale and weakened in a culvert. He takes E.T. home, where Elliott is also growing weaker, and reveal the creature to Mary just before government agents invade and quarantine the house. The lead agent, Keys, asks for Elliott&#x27;s help to save E.T., stating that meeting aliens was his childhood dream and he considers E.T&#x27;s arrival a genuine miracle. However, E.T. dies while Elliott rapidly recovers. Left alone to say goodbye, Elliott tells E.T. that he loves him, but E.T.&#x27;s heart begins to glow and he is revived and restored to health. E.T. tells Elliott that his people are returning for him.

Elliott and Michael flee with E.T. on their bikes, flanked by Michael&#x27;s friends who help them evade the pursuing authorities. Heading towards a roadblock, E.T. levitates the boys to safety and lands them in the forest. E.T.&#x27;s ship arrives, and he says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, who gifts him the chrysanthemum he previously revived. Elliott tearfully asks E.T. to stay, but E.T. places his glowing finger on Elliott&#x27;s head and tells him that he will always be there. The children, Mary, and Keys observe as the ship blasts off into space, leaving a rainbow in the sky.

==Production==
===Development===
After his parents&#x27; divorce in 1960, Spielberg filled the void with an imaginary alien companion that he later recalled as &quot;a friend who could be the brother [he] never had and a father that [he] didn&#x27;t feel [he] had anymore&quot;. In 1978, he announced that he would shoot a film entitled &quot;Growing Up&quot;, which he would film in four weeks. However, the project was set aside due to delays on &quot;1941&quot;, but the concept of making a small autobiographical film about childhood would stay with him. He also thought about a follow-up to &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, and began to develop a darker project he had planned with John Sayles called &quot;Night Skies&quot;, in which malevolent aliens terrorize a family.

Filming &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; in Tunisia caused a sense of loneliness in Spielberg, far from his family and friends, and made memories of his childhood creation resurface. He told screenwriter Melissa Mathison about &quot;Night Skies&quot;, and developed a subplot from the failed project in which Buddy, the only friendly alien, befriends an autistic child. Buddy&#x27;s abandonment on Earth in the script&#x27;s final scene inspired the concept of &quot;E.T.&quot; Mathison wrote a first draft titled &quot;E.T. and Me&quot; in eight weeks, which Spielberg considered perfect. The script went through two more drafts, one by Matthew Robbins which deleted an &quot;Eddie Haskell&quot;–esque friend of Elliott&#x27;s, named Lance. Robbins helped create the chase sequence and he suggested the scene where E.T. got drunk.

In mid-1981, while &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; was being promoted, Columbia Pictures met with Spielberg to discuss the script, after having to develop &quot;Night Skies&quot; with the director as the intended sequel to &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. However, Marvin Atonowsky, the head of Columbia Pictures&#x27; marketing and research development, concluded that it had limited commercial potential, believing that it would appeal to mostly young children. John Veitch, president of Columbia&#x27;s worldwide productions, also felt that the script was not good or scary enough to be financially viable. On the advice of Atonowsky and Veitch, Columbia CEO Frank Price, who had already funneled nearly $1 million into the film’s development (mostly on creature designer Rick Baker’s alien models), was now calling it &quot;a wimpy Walt Disney movie&quot;. He informed Spielberg that the project was officially being put into turnaround; Spielberg took the project to Sid Sheinberg, president of MCA, then the parent company of Universal Pictures. Spielberg told Sheinberg to acquire the E.T. script from Columbia Pictures, which he did for $1million and struck a deal with Price in which Columbia would retain 5% of the film&#x27;s net profits. Veitch later recalled that &quot;I think [in 1982] we made more on that picture than we did on any of &quot;our&quot; films.&quot;

===Pre-production===
Carlo Rambaldi, who designed the aliens for &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, was hired to design the animatronics for &quot;E.T.&quot; Rambaldi&#x27;s own painting &quot;Women of Delta&quot; led him to give the creature a unique, extendable neck. Its face was inspired by those of Carl Sandburg, Albert Einstein and Ernest Hemingway. Producer Kathleen Kennedy visited the Jules Stein Eye Institute to study real and glass eyes. She hired Institute staffers to create E.T.&#x27;s eyes, which she felt were particularly important in engaging the audience. Four heads were created for filming, one as the main animatronic and the others for facial expressions, as well as a costume. A team of puppeteers controlled E.T.&#x27;s face with animatronics. Two little people, Tamara De Treaux and Pat Bilon, as well as 12-year-old Matthew DeMeritt, who was born without legs, took turns wearing the costume, depending on what scene was being filmed. DeMeritt actually walked on his hands and played all scenes where E.T. walked awkwardly or fell over. The head was placed above that of the actors, and the actors could see through slits in its chest. Caprice Roth, a professional mime, filled prosthetics to play E.T.&#x27;s hands. The puppet was created in three months at the cost of $1.5million. Spielberg declared that it was &quot;something that only a mother could love&quot;.

Mars, Incorporated refused to allow M&amp;M&#x27;s to be used in the film, believing that E.T. would frighten children. The Hershey Company was asked if Reese&#x27;s Pieces could be used, and it agreed. This product placement resulted in a large increase in Reese&#x27;s Pieces sales. Science and technology educator Henry Feinberg created E.T.&#x27;s communicator device.

===Casting===

Having worked with Cary Guffey on &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, Spielberg felt confident in working with a cast composed mostly of child actors. For the role of Elliott, he auditioned hundreds of boys, including Keith Coogan; before Jack Fisk suggested Henry Thomas for the role because Henry had played the part of Harry in the film &quot;Raggedy Man&quot;, which Fisk had directed. Thomas, who auditioned in an Indiana Jones costume, did not perform well in the formal testing, but got the filmmakers&#x27; attention in an improvised scene. Thoughts of his dead dog inspired his convincing tears. Robert MacNaughton auditioned eight times to play Michael, sometimes with boys auditioning for Elliott. Spielberg felt that Drew Barrymore had the right imagination for the mischievous Gertie after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band. He enjoyed working with the children, and he later said that the experience made him feel ready to be a father. Ralph Macchio was considered for the role of Tyler, before it went to his eventual &quot;The Outsiders&quot; co-star C. Thomas Howell.

The major voice work of E.T. for the film was performed by Pat Welsh. She smoked two packs of cigarettes a day, which gave her voice a quality that sound effects creator Ben Burtt liked. She spent nine-and-a-half hours recording her part, and was paid $380 by Burtt for her services. He also recorded 16 other people and various animals to create E.T.&#x27;s &quot;voice&quot;. These included Spielberg, actress Debra Winger, his sleeping wife sick with a cold, a burp from his University of Southern California film professor, raccoons, otters, and horses.

Doctors working at the USC Medical Center were recruited to play the ones who try to save E.T. after government agents take over Elliott&#x27;s house. Spielberg felt that actors in the roles, performing lines of technical medical dialogue, would come across as unnatural. During post-production, he decided to cut a scene featuring Harrison Ford as the principal at Elliott&#x27;s school. It featured his character reprimanding Elliott for his behavior in biology class and warning of the dangers of underage drinking. He is then taken aback as Elliott&#x27;s chair rises from the floor, while E.T. is levitating his &quot;phone&quot; equipment up the stairs with Gertie. Ford&#x27;s face is never seen. The footage of this scene was included on the film&#x27;s 1996 LaserDisc release as a bonus feature. It was not included on the DVD and Blu-ray releases that followed.

===Filming===
Principal photography began in neighborhoods in Los Angeles County and in the San Fernando Valley on September 8, 1981. The project was filmed under the cover name &quot;A Boy&#x27;s Life&quot;, as Spielberg did not want anyone to discover and plagiarize the plot. The actors had to read the script behind closed doors, and everyone on set had to wear an ID card. The shoot began with two days at Culver City High School, and the crew spent the next 11 days moving between locations at Northridge and Tujunga. The next 42 days were spent at Laird International Studios in Culver City for the interiors of Elliott&#x27;s home. The crew shot at a redwood forest near Crescent City in Northern California for the production&#x27;s last six days. The exterior Halloween scene and the &quot;flying bicycle&quot; chase scenes were filmed in Porter Ranch.

Spielberg shot the film in roughly chronological order to achieve convincing emotional performances from his cast; it was also done to help the child actors with the workload. Spielberg calculated that the film would hit home harder if the children were really saying goodbye to E.T. at the end. In the scene in which Michael first encounters E.T., his appearance caused MacNaughton to jump back and knock down the shelves behind him. The chronological shoot gave the young actors an emotional experience as they bonded with E.T., making the quarantine sequences more moving. Spielberg ensured that the puppeteers were kept away from the set to maintain the illusion of a real alien. For the first time in his career, Spielberg did not storyboard most of the film, in order to facilitate spontaneity in the performances. The film was shot so adults, except for Dee Wallace, are never seen from the waist up in its first half, as a tribute to the cartoons of Tex Avery. According to Spielberg, the scene in which E.T. disguises himself as a stuffed toy in Elliott&#x27;s closet was suggested by fellow director Robert Zemeckis after he read a draft of the screenplay that Spielberg had sent him. In between takes, the young actors spent time doing activities such as riding bicycles around the sound stages, playing &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, the game that Elliott, Michael, Steve, Tyler and Greg play in a scene early in the film, and attending school lessons. The shoot was completed in 61 days, four ahead of schedule.

In a 2022 interview, Sean Frye, who played Steve, revealed how the visual effect close-up shots for the climax of the &quot;flying bicycle&quot; chase scene were filmed and reflected on the experience, saying: &quot;We were on these rigs ... They&#x27;re pulling the trees backwards, past us on tracks, so it looks like we&#x27;re going through and up and through and over to create this illusion that we&#x27;re going forward when we&#x27;re going nowhere. Then the pushing and pulling of the things so that the bike is up and down, and we can get the &#x27;Whoaaaa&#x27; effects. That was great.&quot; BMX riders Robert Cardoza, Greg Maes, and David Lee served as stunt doubles for the scene.

===Music===
Spielberg&#x27;s regular collaborator John Williams described the challenge of creating a score that would generate sympathy for such an odd-looking creature. As with their previous collaborations, Spielberg liked every theme Williams composed and had it included. Spielberg loved the music for the final chase so much that he edited the sequence to suit it. Williams took a modernist approach, especially with his use of polytonality, which refers to the sound of two different keys played simultaneously. The Lydian mode can also be used in a polytonal way. Williams combined polytonality and the Lydian mode to express a mystic, dreamlike and heroic quality. His theme, emphasizing coloristic instruments such as the harp, piano, celesta, and other keyboards, as well as percussion, suggests E.T.&#x27;s childlike nature and his &quot;machine&quot;. The soundtrack album was first released on June 11, 1982, the same day as the film. An audiobook companion album featuring Williams&#x27;s score, produced by Quincy Jones and narrated by Michael Jackson, was released on November 15, 1982, exactly two weeks prior to Jackson&#x27;s acclaimed sixth studio album &quot;Thriller&quot;.

==Themes==
Spielberg drew the story of the film from his parents&#x27; divorce. Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;essentially a spiritual autobiography, a portrait of the filmmaker as a typical suburban kid set apart by an uncommonly fervent, mystical imagination.&quot; References to Spielberg&#x27;s childhood occur throughout: Elliott fakes illness by holding a thermometer to the bulb in his lamp while covering his face with a heating pad, a trick frequently employed by the young Spielberg. Michael picking on Elliott echoes Spielberg&#x27;s teasing of his younger sisters, and Michael&#x27;s evolution from tormentor to protector reflects how Spielberg had to take care of his sisters after their father left.

Critics have focused on the parallels between the lives of E.T. and Elliott, who is &quot;alienated&quot; by the loss of his father. Pauline Kael noted that &quot;Elliot (his name begins with an &#x27;E&#x27; and ends with a T.&#x27;) is a dutiful, too sober boy who never takes off his invisible thinking cap; the telepathic communication he develops with E.T. eases his cautious, locked-up worries, and he begins to act on his impulses.&quot; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that while E.T. &quot;is the more obvious and desperate foundling,&quot; Elliott &quot;suffers in his own way from the want of a home.&quot; At the film&#x27;s heart is the theme of growing up. Some critics have suggested that Spielberg&#x27;s portrayal of suburbia is very dark, contrary to popular belief. According to A.O. Scott, &quot;the suburban milieu, with its unsupervised children and unhappy parents, its broken toys and brand-name junk food, could have come out of a Raymond Carver story.&quot; Charles Taylor of Salon.com wrote that &quot;Spielberg&#x27;s movies, despite the way they&#x27;re often characterized, are not Hollywood idealizations of families and the suburbs. The homes here bear what the cultural critic Karal Ann Marling called &#x27;the marks of hard use&#x27;.&quot; Relatedly, scholarship has emerged on the film regarding its subversion of the nuclear family dynamic, in which Elliott is growing up with a physically absent father and an emotionally absent mother; this aspect of the movie offers an exploration of upbringing within a nontraditional family structure.

Other critics found religious parallels between E.T. and Jesus. Andrew Nigels described E.T.&#x27;s story as &quot;crucifixion by military science&quot; and &quot;resurrection by love and faith.&quot; According to Spielberg biographer Joseph McBride, Universal Pictures appealed directly to the Christian market, with a poster reminiscent of Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;The Creation of Adam&quot; (more specifically the &quot;fingers touching&quot; detail) and a logo reading &quot;Peace&quot;. Spielberg answered that he did not intend the film to be a religious parable, joking, &quot;If I ever went to my mother and said, &#x27;Mom, I&#x27;ve made this movie that&#x27;s a Christian parable,&#x27; what do you think she&#x27;d say? She has a Kosher restaurant on Pico and Doheny in Los Angeles.&quot;

Several writers have seen the movie as a modern fairy tale. Critic Henry Sheehan described the film as a retelling of Peter Pan from the perspective of a Lost Boy (Elliott): E.T. cannot survive physically on Earth, as Pan could not survive emotionally in Neverland; government scientists take the place of Neverland&#x27;s pirates. Furthering the parallels, there is a scene in the film where Mary reads &quot;Peter Pan&quot; to Gertie. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; similarly observed that the film &quot;freely recycles elements from&quot; &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Kael writes that &quot;from the opening in the dense, vernal woodland that adjoins Elliot&#x27;s suburb (it&#x27;s where we first hear E.T.&#x27;s frightened sounds), the film has the soft, mysterious inexorability of the classic tale of enchantment. The little shed in the back of the house where Elliott tosses in a ball and E.T. sends it back is part of a dreamscape.&quot;

Producer Kathleen Kennedy noted that an important theme of the film is tolerance, which would be central to future Spielberg films such as &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. Having been a loner as a teenager, Spielberg described it as &quot;a minority story&quot;. Spielberg&#x27;s characteristic theme of communication is partnered with the ideal of mutual understanding; he has suggested that the story&#x27;s central alien-human friendship is an analogy for how real-world adversaries can learn to overcome their differences.

==Reception==
===Release and sales===
&quot;E.T.&quot; was previewed in Houston, Texas, and premiered at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s closing gala on May 26, 1982, and was released in the United States on June 11, 1982. It opened at number one at the US box office with a gross of $11million, and stayed at the top of the box office for six weeks; it then fluctuated between the first and second positions until October, before returning to the top spot for the final time in December during a brief holiday season re-release. In its second weekend, it recorded the highest-grossing second weekend of all time, surpassing the record of $10,765,687 set by &quot;Superman II&quot; in 1981. In its fourth weekend, it recorded the highest-grossing weekend of all time, surpassing the record of $16,706,592 set earlier that year by &quot;Rocky III&quot;. It had a record eight weekends with a gross of over $10 million, a feat not matched until &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990), and set a record for being at number one for 16 weeks in total.

The film began its international rollout in Australia on November 26, 1982, and grossed $839,992 in its first 10 days from nine theatres, setting five weekly house records and 43 daily records. In South Africa, it opened in late November and grossed $724,340 in eight days from 14 screens, setting 13 weekly highs. In France, it opened on December 1, and had 930,000 admission in its first five days on 250 screens, setting an all-time record in Paris for most daily admissions (Saturday, December 4). In Japan, it opened on December 4, and grossed $1,757,527 in two days from 35 theatres in 11 cities, setting 10 house records on Saturday and 14 on Sunday. In the United Kingdom, it opened on December 9 after a charity performance in London and grossed a record £1 million in its opening weekend. The film added another 138 screens in Japan on December 11, with advance sales of 1.3 million tickets. It later opened in the Philippines in January 1983. In Finland, Norway, and Sweden, the film had minimum age ratings of 8, 12, and 11, respectively, while Denmark had no minimum age limit. There were Swedish people who were opposed to the age limit.

In 1983, &quot;E.T.&quot; surpassed &quot;Star Wars&quot; to become the highest-grossing film of all time; by the end of its theatrical run, it had grossed $359million in the United States and Canada and $619million worldwide. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 120million tickets in its initial U.S. theatrical run. Spielberg earned $500,000 a day from his share of the profits, while The Hershey Company&#x27;s profits rose 65% due to the film&#x27;s prominent placement of Reese&#x27;s Pieces. The &quot;Official E.T. Fan Club&quot; offered photographs, a newsletter that let readers &quot;relive the film&#x27;s unforgettable moments [and] favorite scenes&quot;, and a vinyl record with &quot;phone home&quot; and other sound clips.

The film was also a merchandising success, with dolls selling units by September 1982 and becoming the best-selling toy that Christmas season. &quot;E.T.&quot; went on to generate over in merchandise sales by 1998. Following the success of the film, Kuwahara, the company that created the BMX bikes featured in the film, began producing red and white &quot;E.T.&quot; models in three price and quality levels. Kuwahara reissued the E.T. model in 2002, as part of the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary, and again in 2022 as part of the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

The film was re-released in 1985 and 2002, earning another $60million and $68million respectively, for a worldwide total of $792million with $435million from the United States and Canada. It held the global record until it was surpassed by &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, another Spielberg film, in 1993, although it managed to hold on to the United States and Canada record for a further four years, until the release of the Special Edition of &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

It was re-released in IMAX on August 12, 2022, in the United States and Canada, to commemorate the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary, alongside an IMAX and RealD 3D reissue of another Spielberg film &quot;Jaws&quot; scheduled for September 2. Jim Orr, Universal&#x27;s president of distribution remarked &quot;No filmmaker, it&#x27;s fair to say, has had a greater or more enduring impact on American cinema or has created more indelible cinematic memories for tens of billions of people worldwide. We couldn&#x27;t think of a more perfect way to celebrate the anniversary of &quot;E.T.&quot; and the first Universal-Spielberg summer blockbuster, &quot;Jaws&quot;, than to allow audiences to experience these films in a way they&#x27;ve never been able to before.&quot; The IMAX release grossed $490,000 on its first day from 389 theaters, for a three-day total of $1.07 million and a $438million running total.

The film would remain one of Universal&#x27;s top three highest-grossing films of all time in North America, behind &quot;Jurassic World&quot; (2015) and &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; (2023), until 2024 with the release of &quot;Wicked&quot;, the first installment of the musical&#x27;s two-part film adaptation. As of 2025, the film remains the studio&#x27;s fifteenth highest-grossing film of all time worldwide.

===Home media===
&quot;E.T.&quot; was eventually released on VHS and LaserDisc on October 27, 1988. The videos were priced with a recommended retail price of $24.95, the lowest initial price at the time for a major movie compared to the normal price of $89.95. To combat piracy, the tapeguards and tape hubs on the videocassettes were colored green, and the tape itself was affixed with a small, holographic sticker of the 1963 Universal logo (much like the holograms on a credit card), and encoded with Macrovision. The film doubled the record pre-orders of &quot;Cinderella&quot; released the same month and went on to sell over 15million VHS units in the United States, and grossed over in video sales revenue. The VHS cassette was also rented over six million times during its first two weeks in 1988, a record it held until the VHS release of &quot;Batman&quot; the following year. Conservative Christians who were still angry about Universal&#x27;s release of &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; earlier in the year called for a boycott of this release. Initial orders internationally exceeded $30 million despite the film often being sold at full price, setting records in the United Kingdom with over 81,000 units and Australia with 35,500 units. It initially shipped 152,000 units in Japan and 87,000 in Germany. In 1991, Sears began selling &quot;E.T.&quot; videocassettes exclusively at their stores as part of a holiday promotion. It was reissued on VHS and LaserDisc again in 1996, with the latter including a 90-minute documentary produced and directed by Laurent Bouzereau; it included interviews with Spielberg, producer Kathleen Kennedy, composer John Williams, and other cast and crew members, as well as two theatrical trailers, an isolated music score, deleted scenes, and still galleries. The VHS included a 10-minute version of the same documentary from the LaserDisc. Both 1996 home video releases of the film were also THX certified as well. The 2012 release of &quot;E.T.&quot; on DVD and Blu-ray grossed in sales revenue in the United States.

===Critical response===
Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, &quot;It works as science fiction, it&#x27;s sometimes as scary as a monster movie, and at the end, when the lights go up, there&#x27;s not a dry eye in the house.&quot; He later added it to his canon of &quot;Great Movies&quot;, structuring the essay as a letter to his grandchildren about watching it with them. Of the scene with the flying bicycles, he writes: &quot;I remember when I saw the movie at Cannes: Even the audience there, people who had seen thousands of movies, let out a whoop at that moment.&quot; Michael Sragow of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called Spielberg &quot;a space age Jean Renoir... for the first time, [he] has put his breathtaking technical skills at the service of his deepest feelings&quot;. Derek Malcolm of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;E.T.&quot; is a superlative piece of popular cinema [...] a dream of childhood, brilliantly orchestrated to involve not only children but anyone able to remember being one&quot;. Leonard Maltin included it in his list of &quot;100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century&quot; as one of only two movies from the 1980s. Political commentator George Will was one of few to pan the film, feeling it spread subversive notions about childhood and science.

The film holds a 99% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 146 reviews, and an average rating of 9.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Playing as both an exciting sci-fi adventure and a remarkable portrait of childhood, Steven Spielberg&#x27;s touching tale of a homesick alien remains a piece of movie magic for young and old.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 92/100 based on 30 reviews. In addition to the film&#x27;s wide acclaim, President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan were moved by it after a screening at the White House on June 27, 1982. Princess Diana was in tears after watching it. On September 17, 1982, it was screened at the United Nations, and Spielberg received a UN Peace Medal. CinemaScore reported that audiences polled during the opening weekend gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade, the first film to earn that grade.

==Accolades==
The film was nominated for nine Oscars at the 55th Academy Awards, including Best Picture. &quot;Gandhi&quot; won that award, but its director, Richard Attenborough, said, &quot;I was certain that not only would &quot;E.T.&quot; win, but that it should win. It was inventive, powerful, wonderful. I make more mundane movies.&quot; &quot;E.T.&quot; won four Academy Awards: Best Original Score, Best Sound (Robert Knudson, Robert Glass, Don Digirolamo, and Gene Cantamessa), Best Sound Effects Editing (Charles L. Campbell and Ben Burtt), and Best Visual Effects (Carlo Rambaldi, Dennis Muren, and Kenneth F. Smith). At the 40th Golden Globe Awards, the film won Best Picture in the Drama category and Best Original Score; it was also nominated for Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best New Male Star for Henry Thomas. The Los Angeles Film Critics Association awarded the film Best Picture, Best Director, and a &quot;New Generation Award&quot; for Melissa Mathison. The film won Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Writing, Best Special Effects, Best Music, and Best Poster Art, while Henry Thomas, Robert McNaughton, and Drew Barrymore won Young Artist Awards. In addition to his Academy, Golden Globe and Saturn, composer John Williams won two Grammy Awards and a BAFTA for the score. The film&#x27;s audiobook album also won the Grammy Award for Best Recording for Children at the 26th Annual Grammy Awards in 1984.
==Legacy==
In American Film Institute polls, the film has been voted the 24th greatest film of all time, the 44th most heart-pounding, and the sixth most inspiring. Other AFI polls rated it as having the 14th greatest music score and as the third greatest science-fiction one. The line &quot;E.T. phone home&quot; was ranked 15th on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes list, and 48th on &quot;Premiere&quot; top movie quote list. In 2005, it topped a Channel 4 poll in the UK of the 100 greatest family films, and was listed by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 best movies ever made.

In 2003, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the film the eighth most &quot;tear-jerking&quot;; in 2007, in a survey of both films and television series, the magazine declared it the seventh greatest work of science-fiction media in the past 25 years. &quot;The Times&quot; also named it as their ninth favorite alien in a film, calling it &quot;one of the best-loved non-humans in popular culture&quot;. It is among the top ten in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14. In 1994, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2011, ABC aired &quot;Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time&quot;, revealing the results of a poll of fans conducted by ABC and &quot;People&quot; magazine: It was selected as the fifth best film of all time and the second best science fiction film. On October 22, 2012, Madame Tussauds unveiled wax likenesses of E.T. at six of its international locations.

A species of sponge, &quot;Advhena magnifica&quot;, was given the common name &quot;E.T. sponge&quot; due to its resemblance of the creature.

In 2023, actress Rita Moreno, who starred in Spielberg&#x27;s 2021 film adaptation of the musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;, named &quot;E.T.&quot; as one of her top five favorite films, saying &quot;Number one, it has superb child actors, which can really only happen because of Steven Spielberg. He is just great with children because he’s like a child himself. It’s a very interesting phenomenon.&quot;

Elements of the film, particularly the story, iconography and musical score, would go on to influence or be referenced in other media, including the films &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985), &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (1988), &quot;Super 8&quot; (2011), &quot;Arrival&quot; (2016), and &quot;Nope&quot; (2022), as well as the Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot; (2016–2025).

===20th anniversary version===

An extended version of the film, dubbed the &quot;Special Edition&quot; (currently out of circulation), including altered dialogue and visual effects, premiered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on March 16, 2002; it was released on home media six days later. Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as he did not have enough time to perfect the animatronics. Computer-generated imagery (CGI), provided by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship&#x27;s design was also altered to include more lights. The first flying sequence where Elliott and E.T. fly on their bicycle through the forest now had the cape of Elliott&#x27;s Halloween costume flap in the wind as it appeared to have originally been intended to be, a change done to have the sequence, particularly the iconic shot of them flying past the Moon, match the film&#x27;s poster and the logo of Spielberg&#x27;s production company Amblin Entertainment.

Scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Mary&#x27;s dialogue, during the offscreen argument with Michael about his Halloween costume, was altered to replace the word &quot;terrorist&quot; with &quot;hippie&quot; in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with walkie-talkies. Spielberg later admitted that he regretted editing out the guns from the film, stating that the film should be left untouched to represent the culture of its time.

At the premiere, John Williams conducted a live performance of the score. The new release grossed $68million in total, with $35million coming from Canada and the United States. The changes to it, particularly the escape scene, were criticized as political correctness. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wondered &quot;Remember those guns the feds carried? Thanks to the miracle of digital, they&#x27;re now brandishing walkie-talkies... Is this what two decades have done to free speech?&quot; Chris Hewitt of &quot;Empire&quot; wrote, &quot;The changes are surprisingly low-key... while ILM&#x27;s CGI E.T. is used sparingly as a complement to Carlo Rambaldi&#x27;s extraordinary puppet.&quot; &quot;South Park&quot; ridiculed many of the changes in the 2002 episode &quot;Free Hat&quot;.

The two-disc DVD release which followed on October 22, 2002, contained the original theatrical and 20th Anniversary extended versions of the film. The features on disc one included deleted scenes, an introduction with Spielberg, a &quot;Reunion&quot; featurette and a &quot;Look Back&quot; featurette. Disc two included a 24-minute documentary about the 20th Anniversary edition changes, a 20th Anniversary premiere featurette, John Williams&#x27; performance at the 2002 premiere, a Space Exploration game, a trailer, cast and filmmaker bios, production notes, and the still galleries ported from the 1996 LaserDisc set. The two-disc edition, as well as a three-disc collector&#x27;s edition containing a &quot;making of&quot; book, a certificate of authenticity, a film cell, and special features that were unavailable on the two-disc edition, were placed in moratorium on December 31, 2002. Later, it was re-released on DVD as a single-disc re-issue in 2005, featuring only the 20th Anniversary version.

In a June 2011, interview, Spielberg said,

[In the future,] ... There&#x27;s going to be no more digital enhancements or digital additions to anything based on any film I direct... When people ask me which &quot;E.T.&quot; they should look at, I always tell them to look at the original 1982 &quot;E.T.&quot; If you notice, when we did put out &quot;E.T.&quot; we put out two &quot;E.T.&quot;s. We put out the digitally enhanced version with the additional scenes and for no extra money, in the same package, we put out the original &#x27;82 version. I always tell people to go back to the &#x27;82 version.

For the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary release on Blu-ray in 2012 and for its 35th anniversary release on Ultra HD Blu-ray in 2017, as well as its corresponding digital releases, only the original theatrical edition was released, with the 20th anniversary edition now out of circulation.

==Other portrayals==

Atari, Inc. produced a video game based on the film for the Atari 2600 and hired Howard Scott Warshaw to program the game. The game was rushed in five weeks to release within the 1982 holiday season. Released in Christmas 1982, the game was critically panned, with nearly every aspect of the game facing heavy criticism. It has since been considered to be one of the worst video games ever made. It was also a commercial failure. It has been cited as a major contributing factor to the video game industry crash of 1983, and has been frequently referenced and mocked in popular culture as a cautionary tale about the dangers of rushed game development and studio interference. In what was initially deemed an urban legend, reports from 1983 stated that as a result of overproduction and returns, millions of unsold cartridges were secretly buried in an Alamogordo, New Mexico landfill and covered with a layer of concrete. In April 2014, diggers hired to investigate the claim confirmed that the Alamogordo landfill contained many E.T. cartridges, among other games.

William Kotzwinkle, author of the film&#x27;s novelization, wrote a sequel, &quot;E.T.: The Book of the Green Planet&quot;, which was published in 1985. In the novel, E.T. returns home to the planet Brodo Asogi, but is subsequently demoted and sent into exile. He attempts to return to Earth by effectively breaking all of Brodo Asogi&#x27;s laws.

E.T. Adventure, a theme park ride based on the film and drawing inspiration from &quot;The Book of the Green Planet&quot;, debuted at Universal Studios Florida on June 7, 1990. The $40million attraction features the title character saying goodbye to visitors by name, along with his home planet. In 1998, E.T. was licensed to appear in television public service announcements produced by the Progressive Corporation. The announcements featured his voice reminding drivers to &quot;buckle up&quot; their seat belts. Traffic signs depicting a stylized E.T. wearing one were installed on selected roads around the United States. The following year, British Telecommunications launched the &quot;Stay in Touch&quot; campaign, with him as the star of various advertisements. The campaign&#x27;s slogan was &quot;B.T. has E.T.&quot;, with &quot;E.T.&quot; also taken to mean &quot;extra technology&quot;.

At Spielberg&#x27;s suggestion, George Lucas included members of E.T.&#x27;s species as background characters in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. &quot;E.T.&quot; was one of the franchises featured in the 2015 crossover game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;. E.T. appears as one of the playable characters, and a world based on the film where players can receive side quests from the characters is available. During E.T.&#x27;s trailer in the sketch for the series known as &quot;Meet that Hero!&quot;, Supergirl explains his backstory and how they have many things in common, including being aliens that crashed down to Earth and how they both have superpowers that they use to help other people. In 2017, video game developer Zen Studios released a pinball adaptation as part of the Universal Classics add-on pack for the virtual pinball game &quot;Pinball FX 3&quot;. It features 3-D animated figures of Elliot, E.T. and his spacecraft.

==Sequels==
=== Cancelled sequel ===
In July 1982, during the film&#x27;s first theatrical run, Spielberg and Mathison wrote a treatment for a sequel to be titled &quot;E.T. II: Nocturnal Fears&quot;, which would have shown Elliott and his friends getting kidnapped by evil aliens, and attempting to contact E.T. for help. Spielberg decided against pursuing it, feeling it &quot;would do nothing but rob the original of its virginity. &quot;E.T.&quot; is not about going back to the planet&quot;. Spielberg also revealed in a January 2025 interview with Indiewire that he briefly considered adapting &quot;E.T.: The Book of the Green Planet&quot; into a film. He ultimately decided against it, beliving that &quot;it was better as a novel than I think it would have been as a film.&quot; In 2022, Henry Thomas said that he hopes a feature-length sequel never gets made, but added &quot;I guarantee you, there are a few men in a very big room now salivating and using their Abacus and slide rules to come up with some really, really big numbers.&quot;

=== Short film sequel ===

On November 28, 2019, during NBC&#x27;s broadcast of the 93rd Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, Xfinity released a four-minute commercial directed by Lance Acord, calling it a &quot;short film sequel&quot; to the original film, titled &quot;A Holiday Reunion&quot;. The commercial stars Henry Thomas, reprising his role as Elliott, now an adult with a family of his own. Julianne Hoyak played his wife, Grace, while Zebastin Borjeau and Alivia Drews played their children, Elliott Jr. and Maggie. The story follows E.T. as he returns to Earth for the holiday season, and focuses on the importance of bringing family together. References and nods to the original film are featured, such as a photo of the Taylors&#x27; family dog Harvey on the kitchen fridge and a replica of the makeshift Speak &amp; Spell communication device.

The commercial utilizes a practical puppet for E.T. himself. In an interview with &quot;Deadline&quot;, Acord said that he went this route in order to elicit more realistic performances from the actors, the same way Spielberg did on the original film. John Williams&#x27; score from the original film is mixed into the commercial. Spielberg was consulted by Comcast (parent company of NBCUniversal, which itself owns Universal Pictures) before production on the commercial began.

Peter Intermaggio, SVP for Marketing Communications for Comcast remarked on the making of the commercial: &quot;Our goal is to show how Xfinity and Sky technology connects family, friends and loved ones, which is so important during the holidays ... The classic friendship between E.T. and Elliott resonates around the world.&quot; Before the commercial was released, Thomas assured that viewers would &quot;get everything they want out of a sequel without the messy bits that could destroy the beauty of the original and the special place it has in people&#x27;s minds and hearts ... Looking at the storyboards, I could see exactly why Steven was really behind it, because the integrity of the story isn&#x27;t lost in this retelling.&quot;

The full commercial also played on Syfy and theatrically during cinema pre-shows through January 5, 2020, and a two–minute version was edited for Comcast&#x27;s British subsidiary, Sky UK.

<text>In computing and telecommunications, a character is the internal representation of a character (symbol) used within a computer or system.

Examples of characters include letters, numerical digits, punctuation marks (such as &quot;.&quot; or &quot;-&quot;), and whitespace. The concept also includes control characters, which do not correspond to visible symbols but rather to instructions to format or process the text. Examples of control characters include carriage return and tab as well as other instructions to printers or other devices that display or otherwise process text.

Characters are typically combined into &quot;strings&quot;.

Historically, the term &quot;character&quot; was used to denote a specific number of contiguous bits. While a character is most commonly assumed to refer to 8 bits (one byte) today, other options like the 6-bit character code were once popular, and the 5-bit Baudot code has been used in the past as well. The term has even been applied to 4 bits with only 16 possible values. All modern systems use a varying-size sequence of these fixed-sized pieces, for instance UTF-8 uses a varying number of 8-bit code units to define a &quot;code point&quot; and Unicode uses varying number of &quot;those&quot; to define a &quot;character&quot;.

==Encoding==

Computers and communication equipment represent characters using a character encoding that assigns each character to something an integer quantity represented by a sequence of digits, typically that can be stored or transmitted through a network. Two examples of usual encodings are ASCII and the UTF-8 encoding for Unicode. While most character encodings map characters to numbers and/or bit sequences, Morse code instead represents characters using a series of electrical impulses of varying length.

==Terminology==
The dictionary Merriam-Webster defines a &quot;character&quot;, in the relevant sense, as &quot;a symbol (such as a letter or number) that represents information; &quot;also&quot;: a representation of such a symbol that may be accepted by a computer&quot;.

Historically, the term &quot;character&quot; has been widely used by industry professionals to refer to an &quot;encoded character&quot;, often as defined by the programming language or API. Likewise, &quot;character set&quot; has been widely used to refer to a specific repertoire of characters that have been mapped to specific bit sequences or numerical codes. The term glyph is used to describe a particular visual appearance of a character. Many computer fonts consist of glyphs that are indexed by the numerical code of the corresponding character.

With the advent and widespread acceptance of Unicode and bit-agnostic &quot;coded character sets&quot;, a character is increasingly being seen as a unit of information, independent of any particular visual manifestation. The ISO/IEC 10646 (Unicode) International Standard defines &quot;character&quot;, or &quot;abstract character&quot; as &quot;a member of a set of elements used for the organization, control, or representation of data&quot;. Unicode&#x27;s definition supplements this with explanatory notes that encourage the reader to differentiate between characters, graphemes, and glyphs, among other things. Such differentiation is an instance of the wider theme of the separation of presentation and content.

For example, the Hebrew letter aleph (&quot;א&quot;) is often used by mathematicians to denote certain kinds of infinity (ℵ), but it is also used in ordinary Hebrew text. In Unicode, these two uses are considered different characters, and have two different Unicode numerical identifiers (&quot;code points&quot;), though they may be rendered identically. Conversely, the Chinese logogram for water (&quot;水&quot;) may have a slightly different appearance in Japanese texts than it does in Chinese texts, and local typefaces may reflect this. But nonetheless in Unicode they are considered the same character, and share the same code point.

The Unicode standard also differentiates between these abstract characters and &quot;coded characters&quot; or &quot;encoded characters&quot; that have been paired with numeric codes that facilitate their representation in computers.

===Combining character===
The combining character is also addressed by Unicode. For instance, Unicode allocates a code point to each of

* &#x27;i &#x27; (U+0069),
* the combining diaeresis (U+0308), and
* &#x27;ï&#x27; (U+00EF).

This makes it possible to code the middle character of the word &#x27;naïve&#x27; either as a single character &#x27;ï&#x27; or as a combination of the character with the combining diaeresis: (U+0069 LATIN SMALL LETTER I + U+0308 COMBINING DIAERESIS); this is also rendered as .

These are considered canonically equivalent by the Unicode standard.

==char==

A &quot;char&quot; in the C programming language is a data type with the size of exactly one byte, which in turn is defined to be large enough to contain any member of the &quot;basic execution character set&quot;. The exact number of bits can be checked via macro. By far the most common size is 8 bits, and the POSIX standard &quot;requires&quot; it to be 8 bits. In newer C standards &quot;char&quot; is required to hold UTF-8 code units which requires a minimum size of 8 bits.

A Unicode code point may require as many as 21 bits. This will not fit in a &quot;char&quot; on most systems, so more than one is used for some of them, as in the variable-length encoding UTF-8 where each code point takes 1 to 4 bytes. Furthermore, a &quot;character&quot; may require more than one code point (for instance with combining characters), depending on what is meant by the word &quot;character&quot;.

The fact that a character was historically stored in a single byte led to the two terms (&quot;char&quot; and &quot;character&quot;) being used interchangeably in most documentation. This often makes the documentation confusing or misleading when multibyte encodings such as UTF-8 are used, and has led to inefficient and incorrect implementations of string manipulation functions (such as computing the &quot;length&quot; of a string as a count of code units rather than bytes). Modern POSIX documentation attempts to fix this, defining &quot;character&quot; as a sequence of one or more bytes representing a single graphic symbol or control code, and attempts to use &quot;byte&quot; when referring to char data. However it still contains errors such as defining an array of &quot;char&quot; as a &quot;character array&quot; (rather than a &quot;byte array&quot;).

Unicode can also be stored in strings made up of code units that are larger than &quot;char&quot;. These are called &quot;wide characters&quot;. The original C type was called &quot;&quot;. Due to some platforms defining &quot;wchar_t&quot; as 16 bits and others defining it as 32 bits, recent versions have added &quot;char16_t&quot;, &quot;char32_t&quot;. Even then the objects being stored might not be characters, for instance the variable-length UTF-16 is often stored in arrays of &quot;char16_t&quot;.

Other languages also have a &quot;char&quot; type. Some such as C++ use at least 8 bits like C. Others such as Java use 16 bits for &quot;char&quot; in order to represent UTF-16 values.

<text>Easy Rider is a 1969 American road drama film written by Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and Terry Southern, produced by Fonda, and directed by Hopper. Fonda and Hopper play two bikers who travel through the American Southwest and South, carrying the proceeds from a cocaine deal. Other actors in the film include Jack Nicholson, Karen Black and Toni Basil. The success of &quot;Easy Rider&quot; helped spark the New Hollywood era of filmmaking during the early 1970s.

A landmark counterculture film, and a &quot;touchstone for a generation&quot; that &quot;captured the national imagination,&quot; &quot;Easy Rider&quot; explores the societal landscape, issues, and tensions towards adolescents in the United States during the 1960s, such as the rise of the hippie movement, drug use, and communal lifestyle. Real drugs were used in scenes showing the use of marijuana and other substances.

An independent production, the film was released by Columbia Pictures on July 14, 1969, and earned $60 million worldwide compared to a modest filming budget of $400,000. Critics have praised the performances, directing, writing, soundtrack, and visuals. It received two Academy Awards nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Jack Nicholson).

In 1998, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

Wyatt and Billy are freewheeling motorcyclists. After smuggling cocaine from Mexico to Los Angeles, they sell their haul and receive a large sum of money. With the cash stuffed into a plastic tube hidden inside the Stars &amp; Stripes-painted fuel tank of Wyatt&#x27;s California-style chopper, they ride eastward aiming to reach New Orleans, Louisiana, in time for the Mardi Gras festival.

During their trip, Wyatt and Billy stop to repair a flat tire on Wyatt&#x27;s bike at a farmstead in Arizona and have a meal with the farmer and his family. Later, Wyatt picks up a hippie hitch-hiker, and he invites them to visit his commune, where they stay for the rest of the day. The notion of &quot;free love&quot; appears to be practiced, with two of the women, Lisa and Sarah, seemingly sharing the affections of the hitch-hiking commune member before turning their attention to Wyatt and Billy. As the bikers leave, the hitch-hiker gives Wyatt some LSD for him to share with &quot;the right people, at the right time&quot;.

Later, while riding along with a parade in New Mexico, the pair are arrested for &quot;parading without a permit&quot; and thrown in jail. There, they befriend lawyer George Hanson, who has spent the night in jail after overindulging in alcohol. After the mention of having done work for the ACLU along with other conversation, George helps them get out of jail and decides to travel with Wyatt and Billy to New Orleans. As they camp that night, Wyatt and Billy introduce George to marijuana. As an alcoholic and a &quot;square&quot;, George is reluctant to try it due to his fear of becoming &quot;hooked&quot; and it leading to worse drugs but quickly relents.

Stopping to eat at a small-town Louisiana diner, the trio attracts the attention of the locals. The girls in the restaurant think they are exciting, but the local men and a police officer make denigrating comments and taunts. Wyatt, Billy, and George decide to leave without any fuss. They make camp outside town. In the middle of the night, a group of locals attack the sleeping trio, beating them with clubs. Billy screams and brandishes a knife, and the attackers leave. Wyatt and Billy suffer minor injuries, but George has been bludgeoned to death. Wyatt and Billy wrap George&#x27;s body in his sleeping bag, gather his belongings, and vow to return the items to his family.

They continue to New Orleans and find a brothel George had told them about earlier in the film. Taking prostitutes Karen and Mary with them, Wyatt and Billy wander the parade-filled streets of the Mardi Gras celebration. They end up in a French Quarter cemetery, where all four ingest the LSD the hitch-hiker had given to Wyatt. Later at their campsite, while Billy enthusiastically recounts their travels, Wyatt melancholically muses that they &quot;blew it&quot; in their quest.

The next morning, as they are overtaken on a two-lane country road by two local men in an older pickup truck, the passenger in the truck reaches for a shotgun, saying he will scare them. As they pass Billy, the passenger fires, and Billy has a lowside crash. The truck passes Wyatt who has stopped, and Wyatt rides back to Billy, finding him lying flat on the side of the road and covered in blood. Wyatt tells Billy he&#x27;s going to get help and covers Billy&#x27;s wound with his own leather jacket. Wyatt then rides down the road toward the pickup as it makes a U-turn. Passing in the opposite direction, the passenger fires the shotgun again, this time through the driver&#x27;s-side window. Wyatt&#x27;s riderless motorcycle flies through the air and comes apart before landing and becoming engulfed in flames.

===Writing===
Hopper and Fonda&#x27;s first collaboration was in &quot;The Trip&quot; (1967), written by Jack Nicholson, which had themes and characters similar to those of &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. Peter Fonda had become &quot;an icon of the counterculture&quot; in &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; (1966), where he established &quot;a persona he would develop further in &quot;The Trip&quot; and &quot;Easy Rider&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Trip&quot; also popularised LSD, while &quot;Easy Rider&quot; went on to &quot;celebrate &#x27;60s counterculture&quot; but does so &quot;stripped of its innocence.&quot; Author Katie Mills wrote that &quot;The Trip&quot; is a way point along the &quot;metamorphosis of the rebel road story from a Beat relic into its hippie reincarnation as &quot;Easy Rider&quot;&quot;, and connected Peter Fonda&#x27;s characters in those two films, along with his character in &quot;The Wild Angels&quot;, deviating from the &quot;formulaic biker&quot; persona and critiquing &quot;commodity-oriented filmmakers appropriating avant-garde film techniques.&quot; It was also a step in the transition from independent film into Hollywood&#x27;s mainstream, and while &quot;The Trip&quot; was criticized as a faux, popularized underground film made by Hollywood insiders, &quot;Easy Rider&quot; &quot;interrogates&quot; the attitude that underground film must &quot;remain strictly segregated from Hollywood.&quot; Mills also wrote that the famous acid trip scene in &quot;Easy Rider&quot; &quot;clearly derives from their first tentative explorations as filmmakers in &quot;The Trip&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Trip&quot; and &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; had been low-budget films released by American International Pictures and were both successful. When Fonda took &quot;Easy Rider&quot; to AIP, however, as it was Hopper&#x27;s first film as director, they wanted to be able to replace him if the film went overbudget, so Fonda took the film to Bert Schneider of Raybert Productions and Columbia Pictures instead.

When seeing a still of himself and Bruce Dern in &quot;The Wild Angels&quot;, Peter Fonda had the idea of a modern Western, involving two bikers travelling around the country and eventually getting shot by hillbillies. He called Dennis Hopper, and the two decided to turn that into a movie, &quot;The Loners&quot;, with Hopper directing, Fonda producing, and both starring and writing. They brought in screenwriter Terry Southern, who came up with the title &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. The film was mostly shot without a screenplay, with ad-libbed lines, and production started with only the outline and the names of the protagonists. Keeping the Western theme, Wyatt was named after Wyatt Earp and Billy after Billy the Kid. However, Southern disputed that Hopper wrote much of the script. In an interview published in 2016 [Southern died in 1995] he said, &quot;You know if Den Hopper improvises a dozen lines and six of them survive the cutting room floor he&#x27;ll put in for screenplay credit. Now it would be almost impossible to exaggerate his contribution to the film—but, by George, he manages to do it every time.&quot; According to Southern, Fonda was under contract to produce a motorcycle film with A.I.P., which Fonda had agreed to allow Hopper to direct. According to Southern, Fonda and Hopper didn&#x27;t seek screenplay credit until after the first screenings of the film, which required Southern&#x27;s agreement due to writers guild policies. Southern says he agreed out of a sense of camaraderie, and that Hopper later took credit for the entire script.

According to Terry Southern&#x27;s biographer, Lee Hill, the part of George Hanson had been written for Southern&#x27;s friend, actor Rip Torn. When Torn met with Hopper and Fonda at a New York restaurant in early 1968 to discuss the role, Hopper began ranting about the &quot;rednecks&quot; he had encountered on his scouting trip to the South. Torn, a Texan, took exception to some of Hopper&#x27;s remarks, and the two almost came to blows, as a result of which Torn withdrew from the project. Torn was replaced by Jack Nicholson. In 1994, Jay Leno interviewed Hopper about &quot;Easy Rider &quot;on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and during the interview, Hopper falsely claimed that Torn had pulled a knife on him during the altercation when it was actually the other way around. This infuriated Torn, so he sued Hopper for defamation seeking punitive damages. Torn ultimately prevailed against Hopper on all counts.

===Filming===

The filming budget of &quot;Easy Rider&quot; was $360,000 to $400,000. Peter Fonda said that on top of this, he personally paid for the costs of travel and lodging for the crew, saying, &quot;Everybody was taking my credit cards and would pay for all the hotels, the food, the gas, everything with Diner&#x27;s Club&quot;. Cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs said that an additional $1 million, &quot;about three times the budget for shooting the rest of the film&quot; was spent on the licensed music tracks that were added during the editing. He already had made two outlaw biker films and suggested that a 1968 Chevy Impala convertible be purchased to carry his camera smoothly, with speeds not exceeding 25 mph.

According to associate producer Bill Heyward in interviews included as part of the bonus DVD feature, &quot;Shaking the Cage&quot;, Hopper was difficult on set. During test shooting on location in New Orleans, with documentary filmmaker Baird Bryant on camera, Hopper fought with the production&#x27;s ad hoc crew for control. At one point, a paranoid Hopper demanded camera operator Barry Feinstein hand over the footage he shot that day so he could keep it safe with him in his hotel room. Enraged, Feinstein hurled the film cans at Hopper and the two got into a physical confrontation. After this turmoil, Hopper and Fonda decided to assemble a proper crew for the rest of the film. Consequently, the rest of the film was shot on 35mm film, while the New Orleans sequences were shot on 16mm film.

The hippie commune was recreated from pictures and shot at a site overlooking Malibu Canyon on Piuma Canyon Road, since the New Buffalo commune in Arroyo Hondo near Taos, New Mexico, did not permit shooting there. Among the extras who appear in the sequence are actors Dan Haggerty and Carrie Snodgress, musician Jim Sullivan, and Fonda&#x27;s daughter Bridget.

A short clip near the beginning of the film shows Wyatt and Billy on Route 66 in Flagstaff, Arizona, passing a large figure of a lumberjack. That lumberjack statue — once situated in front of the Lumberjack Café — remains in Flagstaff, but now stands inside the J. Lawrence Walkup Skydome on the campus of Northern Arizona University. A second, very similar statue was also moved from the Lumberjack Café to the exterior of the Skydome.

Most of the film is shot outside with natural lighting. Hopper said all the outdoor shooting was an intentional choice on his part, because &quot;God is a great gaffer.&quot; Besides the camera car, the production used two five-ton trucks, one for the equipment and pulling an 750 Amp generator trailer, and one for the up to four motorcycles, with the cast and crew in a motor home. One of the locations was Monument Valley.

The restaurant scenes with Fonda, Hopper, and Nicholson were shot in Morganza, Louisiana. The men and girls in that scene were all Morganza locals. In order to inspire more vitriolic commentary from the local men, Hopper told them the characters of Billy, Wyatt, and George had raped and killed a girl outside of town. The scene in which Billy and Wyatt were shot was filmed on Louisiana Highway 105 North, just outside Krotz Springs, and the two men in the pickup truck—Johnny David and D.C. Billodeau—were Krotz Springs locals.

While shooting the cemetery scene, Hopper tried to convince Fonda to talk to the statue of the Madonna as though it were Fonda&#x27;s mother, who had committed suicide when he was 10 years old, and ask her why she left him. Although Fonda was reluctant, he eventually complied. Later Fonda used the inclusion of this scene, along with the concluding scene, as leverage to persuade Bob Dylan to allow the use of Roger McGuinn&#x27;s cover of &quot;It&#x27;s Alright, Ma (I&#x27;m Only Bleeding)&quot;.

===Post-production===
Despite being filmed in the first half of 1968, roughly between Mardi Gras and the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, with production starting on February 22, the film did not have a U.S. premiere until July 1969, after having won an award at the Cannes film festival in May. The delay was partially due to a protracted editing process. Inspired by &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; one of Hopper&#x27;s proposed cuts was 220 minutes long, including extensive use of the &quot;flash-forward&quot; narrative device, wherein scenes from later in the movie are inserted into the current scene. Only one flash-forward survives in the final edit: when Wyatt in the New Orleans brothel has a premonition of the final scene. At the request of Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider, Henry Jaglom was brought in to edit the film into its current form, while Schneider purchased a trip to Taos for Hopper so he wouldn&#x27;t interfere with the recut. Upon seeing the final cut, Hopper was originally displeased, saying that his movie was &quot;turned into a TV show,&quot; but he eventually accepted, claiming that Jaglom had crafted the film the way Hopper had originally intended. Despite the large part he played in shaping the film, Jaglom only received credit as an &quot;Editorial Consultant.&quot;

It is unclear what the exact running time of original rough cut of the movie was: four hours, four and a half hours, or five hours. In 1992, the film&#x27;s producers, Schneider and Rafelson, sued Columbia Pictures over missing negatives, edit footage and damaged prints, holding them negligent concerning these assets. Some of the scenes which were in the original cut but were deleted are:
* The original opening showing Wyatt and Billy performing in a Los Angeles stunt show (their real jobs).
* Wyatt and Billy being ripped off by the promoter.
* Wyatt and Billy getting in a biker fight.
* Wyatt and Billy picking up women at a drive-in.
* Wyatt and Billy cruising to and escaping from Mexico to score the cocaine they sell.
* An elaborate police and helicopter chase that took place at the beginning after the dope deal with police chasing Wyatt and Billy over mountains and across the Mexican border.
* The road trip out of L.A. edited to the full length of Steppenwolf&#x27;s &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; with billboards along the way offering wry commentary.
* Wyatt and Billy being pulled over by a cop while riding their motorcycles across a highway.
* Wyatt and Billy encountering a black motorcycle gang.
* Ten additional minutes for the volatile café scene in Louisiana where George deftly keeps the peace.
* Wyatt and Billy checking into a hotel before going over to Madam Tinkertoy&#x27;s.
* An extended and much longer Madam Tinkertoy sequence.
* Extended versions of all the campfire scenes, including the enigmatic finale in which Wyatt says, &quot;We blew it, Billy.&quot;.

&quot;Easy Rider&quot;&#x27;s style — the jump cuts, time shifts, flash forwards, flashbacks, jerky hand-held cameras, fractured narrative and improvised acting — can be seen as a cinematic translation of the psychedelic experience. Peter Biskind, author of &quot;Easy Riders, Raging Bulls&quot; wrote: &quot;LSD did create a frame of mind that fractured experience and that LSD experience had an effect on films like &quot;Easy Rider&quot;.&quot;

==Motorcycles==


While &quot;Easy Rider&quot; is famous for the Harley-Davidson choppers, the movie actually begins with the characters riding two European-made dirt bikes, Fonda on a red Bultaco Pursang, Hopper on Norton P11 Ranger. In total, two dirt bikes, and four former police bikes were used in the film. The 1949, 1950 and 1952 Harley-Davidson FL &quot;Hydra-Glide&quot; bikes were purchased at an auction for $500, equivalent to about $ in 2025. Each bike had a backup to make sure that shooting could continue in case one of the old machines failed or got wrecked accidentally. The main motorcycles for the film, based on hardtail frames and panhead engines, were designed and built by two African American chopper builders — Cliff Vaughs and Ben Hardy — reflecting chopper designs popular among Black motorcyclists at the time, and following ideas of Peter Fonda, and were handled by Tex Hall and Dan Haggerty during shooting. Cliff Vaughs and Ben Hardy were not mentioned in the movie credits.

One &quot;Captain America&quot; was demolished in the final scene, while the other three were stolen and probably taken apart before their significance as movie props became known. The demolished bike was rebuilt by Dan Haggerty and offered for auction in October 2014 by Profiles in History, a Calabasas, California-based auction house with an estimated value of $1–1.2 million. The provenance of existing Captain America motorcycles is unclear, and has been the subject of much litigation. The EMP Museum in Seattle identified a Captain America chopper displayed there as a rebuilt original movie prop. Many replicas have been made since the film&#x27;s release, including examples at the Deutsches Zweirad- und NSU-Museum (Germany), National Motorcycle Museum (Iowa), Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum (Alabama), and Harley-Davidson Museum (Milwaukee).

Hopper and Fonda hosted a wrap party for the movie and then realized they had not yet shot the final campfire scene. Thus, it was shot after the bikes had already been stolen, which is why they are not visible in the background as in the other campfire scenes.

==Reception and legacy==
===Critical reception===
The film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;pretty but lower case cinema&quot; despite the &quot;upper case&quot; &quot;pious statement about our society which is sick&quot;. He was mildly impressed by the photography, rock score and Nicholson&#x27;s performance. Penelope Gilliatt in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said that it &quot;speaks tersely and aptly for this American age, that is both the best of times and the worst of times.&quot;

Roger Ebert added &quot;Easy Rider&quot; to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list in 2004. &quot;Easy Rider&quot; holds an 84% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 7.70/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Edgy and seminal, &quot;Easy Rider&quot; encapsulates the dreams, hopes, and hopelessness of 1960s counterculture.&quot;

===Box office===
The film opened on July 14, 1969, at the Beekman theater in New York City, and grossed a house record of $40,422 in its first week. It grossed even more the following week with $46,609. In its fourteenth week of release, it was the number one film at the U.S. box office and remained there for three weeks. It was the fourth highest-grossing film of 1969, with a worldwide gross of $60 million, including $41.7 million domestically in the U.S. and Canada.

===Accolades===
In 1998, &quot;Easy Rider&quot; was added to the United States National Film Registry, having been deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

In April 2019, a restored version of the film was selected to be shown in the Cannes Classics section at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.

===Significance===

Along with &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; and &quot;The Graduate&quot;, &quot;Easy Rider&quot; helped kick-start the New Hollywood era during the late 1960s and 1970s. The major studios realized that money could be made from low-budget films made by avant-garde directors. Heavily influenced by the French New Wave, the films of the so-called &quot;post-classical Hollywood&quot; came to represent a counterculture generation increasingly disillusioned with its government as well as the government&#x27;s effects on the world at large and the establishment in general. Although Jack Nicholson appears only as a supporting actor and in the last half of the film, the standout performance signaled his arrival as a movie star, along with his subsequent film &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; in which he had the lead role. Vice President Spiro Agnew criticized &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, along with the band Jefferson Airplane, as examples of the permissiveness of the 1960s counterculture.

The film&#x27;s success, and the new era of Hollywood that it helped usher in, gave Hopper the chance to direct again with complete artistic control. The result was 1971&#x27;s &quot;The Last Movie&quot;, which was a notable box office and critical failure, effectively ending Hopper&#x27;s career as a director for well over a decade.

It also gave Fonda the chance to direct with &quot;The Hired Hand&quot;, although he rarely produced again.

==Music==

The movie was financed with money made from the Monkees, and features a cameo of record producer Phil Spector in the opening scenes, but neither provided any music. The &quot;groundbreaking&quot; soundtrack featured popular rock artists including the Band, the Byrds, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and Steppenwolf. Editor and negative cutter Donn Cambern used various music from his own record collection to make watching up to 80 hours of bike footage more interesting during editing. Most of Cambern&#x27;s music was used, with licensing costs of $1 million, triple the film&#x27;s budget. The film&#x27;s extensive use of pop and rock music for the soundtrack was similar to what had recently been used for 1967&#x27;s &quot;The Graduate&quot;, including songs been used more than once, or being adapted for the movie.

Bob Dylan was asked to contribute music, but was reluctant to use his own recording of &quot;It&#x27;s Alright, Ma (I&#x27;m Only Bleeding)&quot;, so a version performed by Byrds frontman Roger McGuinn was used instead. Also, instead of writing an entirely new song for the film, Dylan simply wrote out the first verse of &quot;Ballad of Easy Rider&quot; and told the filmmakers, &quot;Give this to McGuinn, he&#x27;ll know what to do with it.&quot; McGuinn completed the song and performed it in the film.

Originally, Peter Fonda had intended the band Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young to write an entirely original soundtrack for the film, but this failed to materialize for two reasons. For one, Cambern edited the footage much more closely to what were only meant as temporary tracks than was customary at the time, which led to everyone involved finding them much more suited to the material than they had originally thought. Also, upon watching a screening of the film with Cambern&#x27;s edits, the group felt they could not improve on the music that was used. On the other hand, Hopper increasingly got control over every aspect over the course of the project and decided to throw CSNY out behind Fonda&#x27;s back, telling the band as an excuse, &quot;Look, you guys are really good musicians, but honestly, anybody who rides in a limo can&#x27;t comprehend my movie, so I&#x27;m gonna have to say no to this, and if you guys try to get in the studio again, I may have to cause you some bodily harm.&quot;

Inspired by the movie, Hendrix later wrote a song &quot;Ezy Ryder&quot;, with lyrics reflecting the film&#x27;s themes, while Iron Butterfly wrote &quot;Easy Rider (Let the Wind Pay the Way)&quot;.

==Home media==
The film was first released to DVD on December 7, 1999, as a Special Edition from Columbia Pictures. Special features included an audio commentary track with Dennis Hopper; the documentary &quot;Easy Rider: Shaking the Cage&quot; (1999); production notes; and new interviews with Peter Fonda and Hopper. It received a Blu-ray release on October 20, 2009.

In November 2010, the film was digitally remastered and released by The Criterion Collection as part of the box set &quot;America Lost and Found: The BBS Story&quot;. It included features from previous DVD releases; the documentary &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; (1995); television excerpts showing Hopper and Fonda at the Cannes Film Festival; and a new video interview with BBS co-founder Stephen Blauner. On November 23, 2014, a Blu-ray SteelBook was released. On May 3, 2016, Criterion re-released &quot;Easy Rider&quot; as a 2-disc collection.

== Sequel ==
In 2012, a sequel to the movie was released, titled &quot;Easy Rider: The Ride Back&quot; and directed by Dustin Rikert. The film is about the family of Wyatt &quot;Captain America&quot; Williams from the 1940s to the present day. No members of the original cast or crew were involved with the film, which was produced and written by amateur filmmaker Phil Pitzer, who had purchased the sequel rights to &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. Pitzer also pursued legal action against Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider in order to block them from reclaiming the rights to the film.

<text>Eaux d&#x27;artifice (1953) is a short experimental film by Kenneth Anger.

==Summary==
The film consists entirely of a woman dressed in eighteenth-century clothes who wanders amidst the garden fountains of the Villa d&#x27;Este (&quot;a Hide and Seek in a night-time labyrinth&quot;) to the sounds of Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;Four Seasons&quot;, until she steps into a fountain and momentarily disappears.

==Production==
The film was shot in the Villa d&#x27;Este in Tivoli, Italy. The actress, Carmilla Salvatorelli (not &quot;Carmello&quot;), was &quot;a little midget&quot; Anger had met through Federico Fellini. Anger used a short actress to suggest a different sense of scale, whereby the monuments seemed bigger (a technique he said was inspired by etchings of the gardens in the Villa d&#x27;Este by Giovanni Battista Piranesi).

==Inspiration==
The title, a play on words, is meant to suggest &quot;Feux d&#x27;artifice&quot; (&quot;Fireworks&quot;), in obvious reference to Anger&#x27;s earlier 1947 work. Film critic Scott MacDonald has suggested that &quot;Fireworks&quot; was a film about the repression of (the film-maker&#x27;s) homosexuality in the United States, whereas &quot;Eaux d&#x27;Artifice&quot; &quot;suggests an explosion of pleasure and freedom.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 1993, this short film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<doc id="73448" wikidata="Q19756" url="?curid=73448" title="Mangrove">
<text>A mangrove is a shrub or tree that grows mainly in coastal saline or brackish water. Mangroves grow in an equatorial climate, typically along coastlines and tidal rivers. They have particular adaptations to take in extra oxygen and remove salt, allowing them to tolerate conditions that kill most plants. The term is also used for tropical coastal vegetation consisting of such species. Mangroves are taxonomically diverse due to convergent evolution in several plant families. They occur worldwide in the tropics and subtropics and even some temperate coastal areas, mainly between latitudes 30° N and 30° S, with the greatest mangrove area within 5° of the equator. Mangrove plant families first appeared during the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene epochs and became widely distributed in part due to the movement of tectonic plates. The oldest known fossils of mangrove palm date to 75 million years ago.

Mangroves are salt-tolerant (halophytic) and are adapted to live in harsh coastal conditions. They contain a complex salt filtration system and a complex root system to cope with saltwater immersion and wave action. They are adapted to the low-oxygen conditions of waterlogged mud, but are most likely to thrive in the upper half of the intertidal zone.

The mangrove biome, often called the mangrove forest or mangal, is a distinct saline woodland or shrubland habitat characterized by depositional coastal environments, where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high-energy wave action. Mangrove forests serve as vital habitats for a diverse array of aquatic species, offering a unique ecosystem that supports the intricate interplay of marine life and terrestrial vegetation. The saline conditions tolerated by various mangrove species range from brackish water, through pure seawater (3 to 4% salinity), to water concentrated by evaporation to over twice the salinity of ocean seawater (up to 9% salinity).

Beginning in 2010, remote sensing technologies and global data have been used to assess areas, conditions and deforestation rates of mangroves around the world. In 2018, the Global Mangrove Watch Initiative released a new global baseline which estimates the total mangrove forest area of the world as of 2010 at , spanning 118 countries and territories. A 2022 study on losses and gains of tidal wetlands estimates a net decrease in global mangrove extent from 1999 to 2019. Mangrove loss continues due to human activity, with a global annual deforestation rate estimated at 0.16%, and per-country rates as high as 0.70%. Degradation in quality of remaining mangroves is also an important concern.

There is interest in mangrove restoration for several reasons. Mangroves support sustainable coastal and marine ecosystems. They protect nearby areas from tsunamis and extreme weather events. Mangrove forests are also effective at carbon sequestration and storage. The success of mangrove restoration may depend heavily on engagement with local stakeholders, and on careful assessment to ensure that growing conditions will be suitable for the species chosen.

The International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem is celebrated every year on 26 July.

== Etymology ==
Etymology of the English term &quot;&quot; can only be speculative and is disputed. 
The term may have come to English from the Portuguese &quot; or the Spanish
&quot;. Further back, it may be traced to South America and Cariban and Arawakan languages such as Taíno. Other possibilities include the Malay language 
The English usage may reflect a corruption via folk etymology of the words &quot;mangrow&quot; and &quot;grove&quot;.

The word &quot;mangrove&quot; is used in at least three senses:
* Most broadly to refer to the habitat and entire plant assemblage or &quot;mangal&quot;, for which the terms &quot;mangrove forest biome&quot; and &quot;mangrove swamp&quot; are also used;
* To refer to all trees and large shrubs in a mangrove swamp; and
* Narrowly to refer only to mangrove trees of the genus &quot;Rhizophora&quot; of the family Rhizophoraceae.

==Biology==
According to Hogarth (2015), among the recognized mangrove species there are about 70 species in 20 genera from 16 families that constitute the &quot;true mangroves&quot; – species that occur almost exclusively in mangrove habitats. Demonstrating convergent evolution, many of these species found similar solutions to the tropical conditions of variable salinity, tidal range (inundation), anaerobic soils, and intense sunlight. Plant biodiversity is generally low in a given mangrove. The greatest biodiversity of mangroves occurs in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Indonesian archipelago.

===Adaptations to low oxygen===
The red mangrove (&quot;Rhizophora mangle&quot;) survives in the most inundated areas, props itself above the water level with stilt or prop roots and then absorbs air through lenticels in its bark.
The black mangrove (&quot;Avicennia germinans&quot;) lives on higher ground and develops many specialized root-like structures called pneumatophores, which stick up out of the soil like straws for breathing.
These &quot;breathing tubes&quot; typically reach heights of up to , and in some species, over . The roots also contain wide aerenchyma to facilitate transport within the plants.

===Nutrient uptake===
Because the soil is perpetually waterlogged, little free oxygen is available. Anaerobic bacteria liberate nitrogen gas, soluble ferrum (iron), inorganic phosphates, sulfides, and methane, which make the soil much less nutritious. Pneumatophores (aerial roots) allow mangroves to absorb gases directly from the atmosphere, and other nutrients such as iron, from the inhospitable soil. Mangroves store gases directly inside the roots, processing them even when the roots are submerged during high tide.

===Limiting salt intake===

Red mangroves exclude salt by having significantly impermeable roots that are highly suberised (impregnated with suberin), acting as an ultrafiltration mechanism to exclude sodium salts from the rest of the plant. One study found that roots of the Indian mangrove &quot;Avicennia officinalis&quot; exclude 90% to 95% of the salt in water taken up by the plant, depositing the excluded salt in the cortex of the root. An increase in the production of suberin and in the activity of a gene regulating cytochrome P450 were observed in correlation with an increase in the salinity of the water to which the plant was exposed. In a frequently cited concept that has become known as the &quot;sacrificial leaf&quot;, salt which does accumulate in the shoot (sprout) then concentrates in old leaves, which the plant then sheds. However, recent research on the Red mangrove &quot;Rhizophora mangle&quot; suggests that the older, yellowing leaves have no more measurable salt content than the other, greener leaves.


===Limiting water loss===
Because of the limited fresh water available in salty intertidal soils, mangroves limit the amount of water they lose through their leaves. They can restrict the opening of their stomata (pores on the leaf surfaces, which exchange carbon dioxide gas and water vapor during photosynthesis). They also vary the orientation of their leaves to avoid the harsh midday sun and so reduce evaporation from the leaves. A captive red mangrove grows only if its leaves are misted with fresh water several times a week, simulating frequent tropical rainstorms.

===Filtration of seawater===
A 2016 study by Kim &quot;et al.&quot; investigated the biophysical characteristics of sea water filtration in the roots of the mangrove &quot;Rhizophora stylosa&quot; from a plant hydrodynamic point of view. &quot;R. stylosa&quot; can grow even in saline water and the salt level in its roots is regulated within a certain threshold value through filtration. The root possesses a hierarchical, triple layered pore structure in the epidermis and most Na+ ions are filtered at the first sublayer of the outermost layer. The high blockage of Na+ ions is attributed to the high surface zeta potential of the first layer. The second layer, which is composed of macroporous structures, also facilitates Na+ ion filtration. The study provides insights into the mechanism underlying water filtration through halophyte roots and could serve as a basis for the development of a bio-inspired method of desalination.

Uptake of Na+ ions is desirable for halophytes to build up osmotic potential, absorb water and sustain turgor pressure. However, excess Na+ ions may work on toxic element. Therefore, halophytes try to adjust salinity delicately between growth and survival strategies. In this point of view, a novel sustainable desalination method can be derived from halophytes, which are in contact with saline water through their roots. Halophytes exclude salt through their roots, secrete the accumulated salt through their aerial parts and sequester salt in senescent leaves and/or the bark. Mangroves are facultative halophytes and &quot;Bruguiera&quot; is known for its special ultrafiltration system that can filter approximately 90% of Na+ions from the surrounding seawater through the roots. The species also exhibits a high rate of salt rejection. The water-filtering process in mangrove roots has received considerable attention for several decades. Morphological structures of plants and their functions have been evolved through a long history to survive against harsh environmental conditions.
===Increasing survival of offspring===
In this harsh environment, mangroves have evolved a special mechanism to help their offspring survive. Mangrove seeds are buoyant and are therefore suited to water dispersal. Unlike most plants, whose seeds germinate in soil, many mangroves (e.g. red mangrove) are viviparous, meaning their seeds germinate while still attached to the parent tree. Once germinated, the seedling grows either within the fruit (e.g. &quot;Aegialitis&quot;, &quot;Avicennia&quot; and &quot;Aegiceras&quot;), or out through the fruit (e.g. &quot;Rhizophora&quot;, &quot;Ceriops&quot;, &quot;Bruguiera&quot; and &quot;Nypa&quot;) to form a propagule (a ready-to-go seedling) which can produce its own food via photosynthesis.

The mature propagule then drops into the water, which can transport it great distances. Propagules can survive desiccation and remain dormant for over a year before arriving in a suitable environment. Once a propagule is ready to root, its density changes so that the elongated shape now floats vertically rather than horizontally. In this position, it is more likely to lodge in the mud and root. If it does not root, it can alter its density and drift again in search of more favorable conditions.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The following listings, based on Tomlinson, 2016, give the mangrove species in each listed plant genus and family. Mangrove environments in the Eastern Hemisphere harbor six times as many species of trees and shrubs as do mangroves in the New World. Genetic divergence of mangrove lineages from terrestrial relatives, in combination with fossil evidence, suggests mangrove diversity is limited by evolutionary transition into the stressful marine environment, and the number of mangrove lineages has increased steadily over the Tertiary with little global extinction.

=== True mangroves ===
=== Other mangroves ===
==Species distribution==

Mangroves are a type of tropical vegetation with some outliers established in subtropical latitudes, notably in South Florida and southern Japan, as well as South Africa, New Zealand and Victoria (Australia). These outliers result either from unbroken coastlines and island chains or from reliable supplies of propagules floating on warm ocean currents from rich mangrove regions.



&quot;At the limits of distribution, the formation is represented by scrubby, usually monotypic &quot;Avicennia&quot;-dominated vegetation, as at Westonport Bay and Corner Inlet, Victoria, Australia. The latter locality is the highest latitude (38° 45&#x27;S) at which mangroves occur naturally. The mangroves in New Zealand, which extend as far south as 37°, are of the same type; they start as low forest in the northern part of the North Island but become low scrub toward their southern limit. In both instances, the species is referred to as &quot;Avicennia marina&quot; var. &quot;australis&quot;, although genetic comparison is clearly needed. In Western Australia, &quot;A. marina &quot; extends as far south as Bunbury (33° 19&#x27;S). In the northern hemisphere, scrubby &quot;Avicennia gerrninans&quot; in Florida occurs as far north as St. Augustine on the east coast and Cedar Point on the west. There are records of &quot;A. germinans&quot; and &quot;Rhizophora&quot; mangle for Bermuda, presumably supplied by the Gulf Stream. In southern Japan, &quot;Kandelia obovata&quot; occurs to about 31 °N (Tagawa in Hosakawa et al., 1977, but initially referred to as &quot;K. candel&quot;).&quot;

==Mangrove forests==

Mangrove forests, also called &quot;mangrove swamps&quot; or &quot;mangals&quot;, are found in tropical and subtropical tidal areas. Areas where mangroves occur include estuaries and marine shorelines.

The intertidal existence to which these trees are adapted represents the major limitation to the number of species able to thrive in their habitat. High tide brings in salt water, and when the tide recedes, solar evaporation of the seawater in the soil leads to further increases in salinity. The return of tide can flush out these soils, bringing them back to salinity levels comparable to that of seawater.

At low tide, organisms are also exposed to increases in temperature and reduced moisture before being then cooled and flooded by the tide. Thus, for a plant to survive in this environment, it must tolerate broad ranges of salinity, temperature, and moisture, as well as several other key environmental factors—thus only a select few species make up the mangrove tree community.

About 110 species are considered mangroves, in the sense of being trees that grow in such a saline swamp, though only a few are from the mangrove plant genus, &quot;Rhizophora&quot;. However, a given mangrove swamp typically features only a small number of tree species. It is not uncommon for a mangrove forest in the Caribbean to feature only three or four tree species. For comparison, the tropical rainforest biome contains thousands of tree species, but this is not to say mangrove forests lack diversity. Though the trees themselves are few in species, the ecosystem that these trees create provides a home (habitat) for a great variety of other species, including as many as 174 species of marine megafauna.
Mangrove plants require a number of physiological adaptations to overcome the problems of low environmental oxygen levels, high salinity, and frequent tidal flooding. Each species has its own solutions to these problems; this may be the primary reason why, on some shorelines, mangrove tree species show distinct zonation. Small environmental variations within a mangal may lead to greatly differing methods for coping with the environment. Therefore, the mix of species is partly determined by the tolerances of individual species to physical conditions, such as tidal flooding and salinity, but may also be influenced by other factors, such as crabs preying on plant seedlings.
Once established, mangrove roots provide an oyster habitat and slow water flow, thereby enhancing sediment deposition in areas where it is already occurring. The fine, anoxic sediments under mangroves act as sinks for a variety of heavy (trace) metals which colloidal particles in the sediments have concentrated from the water. Mangrove removal disturbs these underlying sediments, often creating problems of trace metal contamination of seawater and organisms of the area.

Mangrove swamps protect coastal areas from erosion, storm surge (especially during tropical cyclones), and tsunamis. They limit high-energy wave erosion mainly during events such as storm surges and tsunamis.
The mangroves&#x27; massive root systems are efficient at dissipating wave energy. Likewise, they slow down tidal water so that its sediment is deposited as the tide comes in, leaving all except fine particles when the tide ebbs. In this way, mangroves build their environments. Because of the uniqueness of mangrove ecosystems and the protection against erosion they provide, they are often the object of conservation programs, including national biodiversity action plans.

The unique ecosystem found in the intricate mesh of mangrove roots offers a quiet marine habitat for young organisms. In areas where roots are permanently submerged, the organisms they host include algae, barnacles, oysters, sponges, and bryozoans, which all require a hard surface for anchoring while they filter-feed. Shrimps and mud lobsters use the muddy bottoms as their home. Mangrove crabs eat the mangrove leaves, adding nutrients to the mangal mud for other bottom feeders. In at least some cases, the export of carbon fixed in mangroves is important in coastal food webs.

Mangrove forests contribute significantly to coastal ecosystems by fostering complex and diverse food webs. The intricate root systems of mangroves create a habitat conducive to the proliferation of microorganisms, crustaceans, and small fish, forming the foundational tiers of the food chain. This abundance of organisms serves as a critical food source for larger predators like birds, reptiles, and mammals within the ecosystem. Additionally, mangrove forests function as essential nurseries for many commercially important fish species, providing a sheltered environment rich in nutrients during their early life stages. The decomposition of leaves and organic matter in the water further enhances the nutrient content, supporting overall ecosystem productivity. In summary, mangrove forests play a crucial and unbiased role in sustaining biodiversity and ecological balance within coastal food webs.

Larger marine organisms benefit from the habitat as a nursery for their offspring. Lemon sharks depend on mangrove creeks to give birth to their pups. The ecosystem provides little competition and minimizes threats of predation to juvenile lemon sharks as they use the cover of mangroves to practice hunting before entering the food web of the ocean.

Mangrove plantations in Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, and India host several commercially important species of fish and crustaceans.

The mangrove food chain extends beyond the marine ecosystem. Coastal bird species inhabit the tidal ecosystems feeding off small marine organisms and wetland insects. Common bird families found in mangroves around the world are egrets, kingfishers, herons, and hornbills, among many others dependent on ecological range. Bird predation plays a key role in maintaining prey species along coastlines and within mangrove ecosystems.

Mangrove forests can decay into peat deposits because of fungal and bacterial processes as well as by the action of termites. It becomes peat in good geochemical, sedimentary, and tectonic conditions. The nature of these deposits depends on the environment and the types of mangroves involved. In Puerto Rico, the red, white, and black mangroves occupy different ecological niches and have slightly different chemical compositions, so the carbon content varies between the species, as well between the different tissues of the plant (e.g., leaf matter versus roots).

In Puerto Rico, there is a clear succession of these three trees from the lower elevations, which are dominated by red mangroves, to farther inland with a higher concentration of white mangroves. Mangrove forests are an important part of the cycling and storage of carbon in tropical coastal ecosystems. Knowing this, scientists seek to reconstruct the environment and investigate changes to the coastal ecosystem over thousands of years using sediment cores. However, an additional complication is the imported marine organic matter that also gets deposited in the sediment due to the tidal flushing of mangrove forests. Termites play an important role in the formation of peat from mangrove materials. They process fallen leaf litter, root systems and wood from mangroves into peat to build their nests, and stabilise the chemistry of this peat that represents approximately 2% of above ground carbon storage in mangroves. As the nests are buried over time this carbon is stored in the sediment and the carbon cycle continues.

Mangroves are an important source of blue carbon. Globally, mangroves stored of carbon in 2012. Two percent of global mangrove carbon was lost between 2000 and 2012, equivalent to a maximum potential of of emissions of carbon dioxide in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

Globally, mangroves have been shown to provide measurable economic protections to coastal communities affected by tropical storms.

==Mangrove microbiome==
Plant microbiomes play crucial roles in the health and productivity of mangroves. Many researchers have successfully applied knowledge acquired about plant microbiomes to produce specific for crop protection. Such inocula can stimulate plant growth by releasing phytohormones and enhancing uptake of some mineral nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen). However, most of the plant microbiome studies have focused on the model plant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; and economically important crop plants, such as rice, barley, wheat, maize and soybean. There is less information on the microbiomes of tree species. Plant microbiomes are determined by plant-related factors (e.g., genotype, organ, species, and health status) and environmental factors (e.g., land use, climate, and nutrient availability). Two of the plant-related factors, plant species and genotypes, have been shown to play significant roles in shaping rhizosphere and plant microbiomes, as tree genotypes and species are associated with specific microbial communities. Different plant organs also have specific microbial communities depending on plant-associated factors (plant genotype, available nutrients, and organ-specific physicochemical conditions) and environmental conditions (associated with aboveground and underground surfaces and disturbances).

===Root microbiome===

Mangrove roots harbour a repertoire of microbial taxa that contribute to important ecological functions in mangrove ecosystems. Like typical terrestrial plants, mangroves depend upon mutually beneficial interactions with microbial communities. In particular, microbes residing in developed roots could help mangroves transform nutrients into usable forms before plant assimilation. These microbes also provide mangroves phytohormones for suppressing phytopathogens or helping mangroves withstand heat and salinity. In turn, root-associated microbes receive carbon metabolites from the plant via root exudates, thus close associations between the plant and microbes are established for their mutual benefits.

The taxonomic class level shows that most Proteobacteria were reported to come from Gammaproteobacteria, followed by Deltaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria. The diverse function and the phylogenic variation of Gammaproteobacteria, which consisted of orders such as Alteromonadales and Vibrionales, are found in marine and coastal regions and are high in abundance in mangrove sediments functioning as nutrient recyclers. Members of Deltaproteobacteria found in mangrove soil are mostly sulfur-related, consisting of Desulfobacterales, Desulfuromonadales, Desulfovibrionales, and Desulfarculales among others.
Highly diverse microbial communities (mainly bacteria and fungi) have been found to inhabit and function in mangrove roots. For example, diazotrophic bacteria in the vicinity of mangrove roots could perform biological nitrogen fixation, which provides 40–60% of the total nitrogen required by mangroves; the soil attached to mangrove roots lacks oxygen but is rich in organic matter, providing an optimal microenvironment for sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogens, ligninolytic, cellulolytic, and amylolytic fungi are prevalent in the mangrove root environment; rhizosphere fungi could help mangroves survive in waterlogged and nutrient-restricted environments. These studies have provided increasing evidence to support the importance of root-associated bacteria and fungi for mangrove growth and health.

Recent studies have investigated the detailed structure of root-associated microbial communities at a continuous fine-scale in other plants, where a microhabitat was divided into four root compartments: endosphere, episphere, rhizosphere, and nonrhizosphere or bulk soil. Moreover, the microbial communities in each compartment have been reported to have unique characteristics. Root exudates selectively enrich adapted microbial populations; however, these exudates were found to exert only marginal impacts on microbes in the bulk soil outside the rhizosphere . Furthermore, it was noted that the root episphere, rather than the rhizosphere, was primarily responsible for controlling the entry of specific microbial populations into the root, resulting in the selective enrichment of Proteobacteria in the endosphere. These findings provide new insights into the niche differentiation of root-associated microbial communities, Nevertheless, amplicon-based community profiling may not provide the functional characteristics of root-associated microbial communities in plant growth and biogeochemical cycling. Unraveling functional patterns across the four root compartments holds a great potential for understanding functional mechanisms responsible for mediating root–microbe interactions in support of enhancing mangrove ecosystem functioning.

The diversity of bacteria in disturbed mangroves is reported to be higher than in
well-preserved mangroves Studies comparing mangroves in different conservation states show that bacterial composition in disturbed mangrove sediment alters its structure, leading to a functional equilibrium, where the dynamics of chemicals in mangrove soils lead to the remodeling of its microbial structure.

===Suggestions for future mangrove microbial diversity research===
Despite many research advancements in mangrove sediment bacterial metagenomics
diversity in various conditions over the past few years, bridging the research gap and
expanding our knowledge towards the relationship between microbes mainly constituted of bacteria and its nutrient cycles in the mangrove sediment and direct and indirect impacts on mangrove growth and stand-structures as coastal barriers and other ecological service providers. Thus, based on studies by Lai et al.&#x27;s systematic review, here they suggest sampling improvements and a fundamental environmental index for future reference.

===Mangrove virome===

Mangrove forests are one of the most carbon-rich biomes, accounting for 11% of the total input of terrestrial carbon into oceans. Viruses are thought to significantly influence local and global biogeochemical cycles, though as of 2019, little information was available about the community structure, genetic diversity, and ecological roles of viruses in mangrove ecosystems.

Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on earth, present in virtually all ecosystems. By lysing their hosts, that is, by rupturing their cell membranes, viruses control host abundance and affect the structure of host communities. Viruses also influence their host diversity and evolution through horizontal gene transfer, selection for resistance and manipulation of bacterial metabolisms. Importantly, marine viruses affect local and global biogeochemical cycles through the release of substantial amounts of organic carbon and nutrients from hosts and assist microbes in driving biogeochemical cycles with auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs).

It is presumed that AMGs augment viral-infected host metabolism and facilitate the production of new viruses. AMGs have been extensively explored in marine cyanophages and include genes involved in photosynthesis, carbon turnover, phosphate uptake and stress response. Cultivation-independent metagenomic analysis of viral communities has identified additional AMGs that are involved in motility, central carbon metabolism, photosystem I, energy metabolism, iron–sulphur clusters, anti-oxidation and sulphur and nitrogen cycling. Interestingly, a recent analysis of Pacific Ocean Virome data identified niche-specialised AMGs that contribute to depth-stratified host adaptations. Given that microbes drive global biogeochemical cycles, and viruses infect a large fraction of microbes at any given time, viral-encoded AMGs must play important roles in global biogeochemistry and microbial metabolic evolution.

Mangrove forests are the only woody halophytes that live in salt water along the world&#x27;s subtropical and tropical coastlines. Mangroves are one of the most productive and ecologically important ecosystems on earth. The rates of primary production of mangroves equal those of tropical humid evergreen forests and coral reefs. As a globally relevant component of the carbon cycle, mangroves sequester approximately 24 million metric tons of carbon each year. Most mangrove carbon is stored in soil and sizable belowground pools of dead roots, aiding in the conservation and recycling of nutrients beneath forests. Although mangroves cover only 0.5% of the earth&#x27;s coastal area, they account for 10–15% of the coastal sediment carbon storage and 10–11% of the total input of terrestrial carbon into oceans. The disproportionate contribution of mangroves to carbon sequestration is now perceived as an important means to counterbalance greenhouse gas emissions.

Despite the ecological importance of the mangrove ecosystem, knowledge of mangrove biodiversity is notably limited. Previous reports mainly investigated the biodiversity of mangrove fauna, flora, and bacterial communities. Particularly, little information is available about viral communities and their roles in mangrove soil ecosystems. In view of the importance of viruses in structuring and regulating host communities and mediating element biogeochemical cycles, exploring viral communities in mangrove ecosystems is essential. Additionally, the intermittent flooding of sea water and resulting sharp transition of mangrove environments may result in substantially different genetic and functional diversity of bacterial and viral communities in mangrove soils compared with those of other systems.

<text>El Norte (English: &quot;The North&quot;) is a 1983 independent drama film, directed by Gregory Nava. The screenplay was written by Gregory Nava and Anna Thomas, based on Nava&#x27;s story. The movie was first presented at the Telluride Film Festival in 1983, and its wide release was in January 1984.

The drama features Zaide Silvia Gutiérrez and David Villalpando, in their first film roles, as two indigenous youths who flee Guatemala due to the ethnic and political persecution of the Guatemalan Civil War. They head north and travel through Mexico to the United States, arriving in Los Angeles, California, after an arduous journey.

The picture was partly funded by the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), a non-profit public broadcasting television service in the United States.

&quot;El Norte&quot; received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay in 1985. In 1995, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
The writing team of Nava and Thomas split the story into three parts:

=== &quot;Arturo Xuncax&quot; ===
The first part takes place in a small rural Guatemalan village called San Pedro and introduces the Xuncax family, a group of indigenous Mayans. Arturo is a coffee picker and his wife a homemaker. Arturo explains his worldview to his son Enrique and how the &quot;indio&quot; fares in Guatemalan life, noting that, &quot;to the rich, the peasant is just a pair of strong arms&quot;. Arturo and his family then discuss the possibility of going to the United States where &quot;all the people, even the poor, have their own cars&quot;.

Because of his attempts to form a labor union among the workers, Arturo and the other organizers are attacked and murdered by government troops when a co-worker is bribed to betray them—Arturo&#x27;s severed head is seen hanging from a tree. When Enrique attempts to climb the tree that displays his father&#x27;s head, a soldier attacks him. Enrique fights back and kills the attacker, then escapes with his sister Rosa and hides in a safe house until morning. Enrique and Rosa thus escape capture, only to learn that many of their fellow villagers have been rounded up by soldiers. The children&#x27;s mother too &quot;disappears&quot;: abducted by soldiers. So, using money given to them by their godmother, Enrique and Rosa decide to flee Guatemala, the land of their birth, and head north.

=== &quot;Coyote&quot; ===
During the second part of the film, the two teenagers flee Guatemala, travel through Mexico, and meet a Mexican coyote who guides them across the border. This section includes various comic scenes relating to mutual stereotyping among different ethnic groups; the two attempt to pass themselves off as indigenous Mexicans, failing to convince one Mexican truck driver after naming the wrong destination, but later succeeding in convincing a U.S. Border Patrol officer by copiously peppering their responses with the Mexican word for &quot;fuck&quot;, which a neighbor had suggested was how all Mexicans speak.

Thus, Enrique and Rosa are only deported to a border town in Mexico and not to Guatemala, giving them a base for a second attempt to cross the border. After their first failed attempt to cross the &quot;frontera&quot;, in which a man posing as a coyote deceives and attempts to rob them, they have a horrific experience when they finally cross the U.S.-Mexico border through a sewer pipe laden with rats; critic Roger Ebert noted:

=== &quot;El Norte&quot; ===
In the final part of the film, Rosa and Enrique discover the difficulties of living in the U.S. without official documentation. The brother and sister find work and a place to live and initially feel good about their decision. However, Rosa is nearly caught up in an immigration raid and must find a new job. Working as a domestic, she is puzzled when her Anglo employer shows her a washing machine. Enrique becomes a busboy and, as his English classes begin to improve his command of the language, is promoted to a position as a waiter&#x27;s assistant. He is later approached by a businesswoman who has a better-paying job for him in Chicago as a foreman, which he initially declines; he too encounters problems when a jealous Chicano co-worker reports him to immigration, causing him to flee the restaurant and seek out the businesswoman.

When Enrique finally decides to take the position, Rosa becomes gravely ill with typhus contracted from the rat bites she received during their border crossing. When this happens, Enrique must make the tough decision of missing the flight to Chicago to be by her side, and thus loses the position. As Enrique sits by her bedside in the hospital, a dying Rosa laments that she will not live to enjoy the fruits of their harrowing journey to the U.S. Rosa sums up the film&#x27;s major theme when she says to Enrique:

After Rosa dies, Enrique is shown once again waiting with the other day-labor hopefuls in a parking lot, offering his services to a man looking for &quot;strong arms&quot;; reviewer Renee Scolaro Rathke observes: &quot;It is a bitter realization that Arturo&#x27;s words about the poor being nothing but arms for the rich holds true even in El Norte.&quot;

Although Enrique is temporarily employed once again, he is distracted by haunting daydreams about his sister&#x27;s lost desires for a better life. The final shot in the film again shows a severed head hanging from a rope, which may be the same image used in Part I of the film; one critic has commented that a hanging, severed head is &quot;a symbolic device used in some Latin films to signify that the character has committed suicide&quot;.

==Cast==
==Background==
The origins of &quot;El Norte&quot; are the director&#x27;s experiences in San Diego, California, where he grew up. Nava came from a border family and has relatives on the other side in Tijuana, Baja California. As a youth, he crossed the border several times a week, often wondering who lived in all those cardboard shacks on the Mexican side.

For research the producers of &quot;El Norte&quot; learned about the plight of indigenous Guatemalans from years of research, much of it conducted among exiles living in Southern California. Nava said &quot;There are hundreds of thousands of refugees from Central America in Los Angeles alone. Nobody knows the exact number, but a recent television inquiry estimated 300,000 to 400,000. In our own research, we came across a community of Mayans from Guatemala—5,000 from one village—now in Los Angeles. The original village, which is now dead, had 15,000.&quot;

Annette Insdorf of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Nava discussed the singular nature of the US-Mexico border. Nava said:

The border is unique—the only place in the world where an industrialized first-world nation shares the border with a third-world country. In California, it&#x27;s just a fence: on one side are the Tijuana slums, on the other side—San Diego. It&#x27;s so graphic! This was the germ of the story.

The movie has become a staple of high school Spanish language and Human Geography classes throughout the United States and multiculturalism studies in college.

===Financing===
Nava and Anna Thomas spent two years raising money for &quot;El Norte&quot; but they did not pursue film studios or television networks because much of what makes &quot;El Norte&quot; special would have been jeopardized if a major studio had been involved in the filmmaking process.

Financing for the film was provided by PBS&#x27;s American Playhouse (50%) and the rest in pre-sales. One such pre-sale was made to the United Kingdom&#x27;s Channel 4.

==Themes==

===Magical realism===
Parts of &quot;El Norte&quot; provide an example of how Latin American magical realism, primarily found in novels, has been depicted in a theatrical film. Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;El Norte&quot; was seminal, both for its graceful blend of classical narrative and magic realism, and the power with which it brought an otherwise invisible world to life.&quot;

===Indigenous view and bigotry===
&quot;El Norte&quot; portrays an Amerindian point-of-view and this is exemplified by the religion they follow. An example is when Rosa Xuncax sings the eulogy at the funeral of her father and its Native American-Maya religious theme. A traditional Maya belief is that life has a cyclical nature. Rosa sings in her Maya language:

Throughout &quot;El Norte&quot; young Rosa and Enrique and their family are subjected to many epithets, hatred, and bigotry due to their indigenous heritage. When the father Arturo inadvertently kills a soldier, for example, a ladino screams:

And, when Rosa and Enrique reach their destination in Mexico, a passenger screams at the timid Maya youngsters:

===Guatemalan exodus===
David Villalpando, the actor who played Enrique Xuncax, gave an interview to &quot;Lear Media&quot; about what the film meant to him and why he believes the film is important. Villalpando said:

==Production==
When Nava and his production crew were, more or less, kicked out of Mexico during the film shoot, he had to re-create a Mexican village in California. Nava said &quot;We were filming in Mexico during the end of the López Portillo presidency, one of the last of the old-fashioned caciques to rule Mexico. One day, men with machine guns took over the set. I had guns pointed at my head. We were forced to shut down production, bribe our way out of the country, fight to get our costumes back, and start shooting again in California. Ironically, in the United States our extras were real Mayan refugees. They were the people the movie was about.&quot;

Nava tells the story that, at one point, Mexican police kidnapped their accountant and held him for ransom, and at the same time, his parents had to pose as tourists in order to smuggle exposed film out of the country in their suitcases.

===Filming locations===
The film was shot in Mexico and California. In Mexico, the locations were Chiapas, Morelos, México, D.F., and Tijuana. In California, the locations were San Diego and Los Angeles.

==Distribution==
The film was released in Scotland on October 11, 1983. On December 11, 1983, the movie opened in New York City and on January 27, 1984, it opened in wide release.

It was screened in the &quot;&quot; section at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival.

A director&#x27;s cut was re-released in May 2000.

The film was re-released theatrically by Fathom Events in association with Lionsgate on September 15, 2019, followed by a digital release two days later, to commemorate its 35th anniversary, and featured new interviews with director Gregory Nava and the film&#x27;s two stars, Zaide Silvia Gutierrez and David Villalpando. The film was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2017.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
When released, the staff at &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as the &quot;first United American independent epic.&quot;

In his four-star review, film critic Roger Ebert was pleased with Nava and Thomas&#x27;s work and likened it to a classic film of yesteryear, writing: &quot;&quot;El Norte&quot; (1983) tells their story with astonishing visual beauty, with unashamed melodrama, with anger leavened by hope. It is a &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; for our time.&quot;

In a scene where the characters cross into California by means of a rat-infested sewer tunnel and emerge to a view of San Diego, &quot;Commonweal&quot; critic Tom O&#x27;Brien wrote: &quot;...the scene sums up its rare strength&quot;.

Film critics Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat of the website &quot;Spirituality and Practice&quot; were touched by Nava and Thomas&#x27; story and the attention they give to the character&#x27;s native roots, and wrote: &quot;Nava&#x27;s attention to details, particularly the aesthetic and religious beauty of Indian culture, and his sympathy for the protagonists&#x27; inner lives lift this story above its melodramatic moments and make the tale a memorable one.&quot;

Some film reviewers objected to what they considered the film&#x27;s overly sad end as Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote: &quot;Until its arbitrarily tragic ending, &quot;El Norte&quot; seems about to make one of the most boldly original and satirical social-political statements ever to be found in a film about the United States as a land of power as well as opportunity.&quot; However, Canby did find the acting top-rate and noted the realism they bring to their tasks. He added: &quot;Mr. Nava does not patronize his &#x27;little people.&#x27; This has something to do with the straight, unactorly quality of the performances, especially by Zaide Silvia Gutierrez as Rosa and David Villalpando as Enrique, two splendid Mexican actors.&quot;

Rotten Tomatoes reported that 92% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 60 reviews.

<doc id="73452" wikidata="Q2488744" url="?curid=73452" title="The Emperor Jones">
<text>The Emperor Jones is a 1920 tragic play by American dramatist Eugene O&#x27;Neill that tells the tale of Brutus Jones, a resourceful, self-assured African American and a former Pullman porter, who kills another black man in a dice game, is jailed, and later escapes to a small, backward Caribbean island where he sets himself up as emperor. The play recounts his story in flashbacks as Brutus makes his way through the jungle in an attempt to escape former subjects who have rebelled against him.

Originally called &quot;The Silver Bullet&quot;, the play is one of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s major experimental works, mixing expressionism and realism, and the use of an unreliable narrator and multiple points of view. It was also an oblique commentary on the U.S. occupation of Haiti after bloody rebellions there, an act of imperialism that was much condemned in O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s radical political circles in New York. &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; draws on O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s own hallucinatory experience hacking through the jungle while prospecting for gold in Honduras in 1909, as well as the brief, brutal presidency of Haiti&#x27;s Vilbrun Guillaume Sam.

&quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; was O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s first big box-office hit. It established him as a successful playwright, after he won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for his first play, the much less well-known &quot;Beyond the Horizon&quot; (1920). &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; was included in Burns Mantle&#x27;s &quot;The Best Plays of 1920–1921&quot;.

==Synopsis==

&quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; is about Brutus Jones, a Black American Pullman porter who escapes to an island in the West Indies. In two years, Jones makes himself &quot;Emperor&quot; of the place. A native tried to shoot Jones, but the gun misfired; thereupon Jones announced that he was protected by a charm and that only silver bullets could harm him. 

When the play begins, he has been Emperor long enough to amass a fortune by imposing heavy taxes on the islanders and carrying on all sorts of large-scale corruption. Rebellion is brewing. The islanders are whipping up their courage to a fighting point by calling on the local gods and demons of the forest. From the deep of the jungle, the steady beat of a big drum sounded by them is heard, increasing its tempo towards the end of the play and showing the rebels&#x27; presence dreaded by the Emperor. It is the equivalent of the heart-beat which assumes a higher and higher pitch; while coming closer it denotes the premonition of approaching punishment and the climactic recoil of internal guilt of the hero; he wanders and falters in the jungle, present throughout the play with its primeval terror and blackness.

The play is virtually a monologue for its leading character, Jones, in a Shakespearean range from regal power to the depths of terror and insanity, comparable to Lear or Macbeth. Scenes 2 to 7 are from the point of view of Jones, and no other character speaks. The first and last scenes are essentially a framing device with a character named Smithers, a white trader who appears to be part of illegal activities. In the first scene, Smithers is told about the rebellion by an old woman, and then has a lengthy conversation with Jones. In the last scene, Smithers converses with Lem, the leader of the rebellion. Smithers has mixed feelings about Jones, though he generally has more respect for Jones than for the rebels. During the final scene, Jones is killed by a silver bullet, which was the only way that the rebels believed Jones could be killed, and the way in which Jones planned to kill himself if he was captured.

==Characters==

* Smithers, a Cockney Trader
* An Old Native Woman
* Lem, a Native Chief
* Soldiers, Adherents of Lem

The Little Formless Fears; Jeff; The Negro Convicts; The Prison Guard; The Planters; The Auctioneer; The Slaves; The Congo Witch-Doctor; The Crocodile God

== Inspiration ==
The expansive personality and style of speech seen in Brutus Jones was modeled on Adam Scott, an African-American and close friend of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s. Scott tended bar at O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s favorite tavern, at the rear of Holt&#x27;s Grocery on Main Street, in his hometown of New London, Connecticut. In their biography of O&#x27;Neill, Arthur and Barbara Gelb report that, Scott&#x27;s imperious personality so impressed O&#x27;Neill that he later borrowed it for &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot;. While the play was also derived from other sources, it was Scott&#x27;s bravado, his superstition and his religious convictions that imbued the character of Brutus Jones.

==Productions==

===1920 premiere===
&quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; was first staged on November 1, 1920, by the Provincetown Players at the Provincetown Playhouse in New York City. Charles Sidney Gilpin, a respected leading man from the all-black Lafayette Players of Harlem, was the first actor to play the role of Brutus Jones on stage. There was some conflict over Gilpin&#x27;s tendency to change O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s use of the word &quot;nigger&quot; to Negro and colored during the play. This production was O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s first real smash hit. The Players&#x27; small theater was too small to cope with audience demand for tickets, and the play was transferred to another theater. It ran for 204 performances and was hugely popular, touring in the States with this cast for the next two years.
===1925 revival===
Although Gilpin continued to perform the role of Brutus Jones in the US tour that followed the Broadway closing of the play, he eventually had a falling out with O&#x27;Neill. Gilpin wanted O&#x27;Neill to remove the word &quot;nigger,&quot; which occurred frequently in the play, but the playwright felt its use was consistent with his dramatic intentions. Further, O&#x27;Neill defended the language as consistent with the behavior and speech of Adam Scott, the character&#x27;s inspiration. When they could not come to a reconciliation, O&#x27;Neill replaced Gilpin with the young and then unknown Paul Robeson, who previously had only performed on the concert stage. Robeson starred in the title role in the 1925 New York revival (28 performances) and later in the London production.

Robeson starred in the summer production in 1941 at the Ivoryton Playhouse, Ivoryton, Ct.

===1926 revival===
The show was again revived in 1926 at the Mayfair Theatre in Manhattan, with Gilpin again starring as Jones and also co-directing the show with James Light. The production, which ran for 61 performances, is noted for the acting debut of a young Moss Hart as Smithers.

===Federal Theatre Project===

The Federal Theatre Project of the Works Progress Administration launched several productions of the play in cities across the United States, including a production with marionettes in Los Angeles in 1938.

===Recent productions===
In 1980 Richard Negri directed a production at the Royal Exchange, Manchester with Pete Postlethwaite and Albie Woodington.

The Wooster Group started to develop a production of the play in 1992 through a series of work in progress showings. The finished piece opened in 1993 at The Performing Garage. As part of its postdramatic aesthetics, this staging was notable for having an actor play the part of Jones who was female, white, and performed in blackface (Kate Valk). Blackface had been a suggestion for the original production, which O&#x27;Neill vetoed.

In 2005 Thea Sharrock directed the play, with Paterson Joseph in the title role, for the Bush Theatre in London. The audience looked down into a sand-filled pit. The claustrophic effect was admired by Michael Billington among others. The production transferred to the Olivier auditorium at The National Theatre, London, in 2007.

New York&#x27;s Irish Repertory Theatre staged a 2009 revival, which received positive reviews. John Douglas Thompson portrayed Jones.

==Adaptations==
The play was adapted for a 1933 feature film starring Paul Robeson and directed by Dudley Murphy, an avant-garde filmmaker of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s Greenwich Village circle who pursued the reluctant playwright for a decade before getting the rights from him.

Louis Gruenberg wrote an opera based on the play, which was premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in 1933. Baritone Lawrence Tibbett sang the title role, performing in blackface. Paul Robeson&#x27;s 1936 film &quot;Song of Freedom&quot; features a scene from the opera with Robeson singing the role of Jones. This has sometimes resulted in a confusion that the 1933 film of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play is a film of the opera.

In the UK, BBC Television produced an adaptation in 1938, starring Robert Adams, and another in 1953, starring Gordon Heath.

Several revivals were made in the 1950s when Robeson himself was blacklisted, denied his passport by the State Department and his films — including the 1933 film — recordings and performances were banned in the United States; these new productions were implicitly in defiance of the persecution and suppression of this great star by McCarthyism and the FBI from 1950 until 1958, and part of a worldwide effort of artists to lift the ban.

First, the legendary New York actor Ossie Davis starred in a television adaptation for the &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot; in 1955 — this at a time when black faces were rarely seen on American television sets.

In 1956 Heitor Villa-Lobos wrote a ballet based on the play that was commissioned by The Empire Music Festival of New York, and danced by José Limón&#x27;s company, most of them in blackface — Limón himself a revered teacher at Juilliard and breakthrough performer of color.

A live British television production by ABC Television for the first season of its &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; series was seen on UK television on March 30, 1958. It features African-American singer Kenneth Spencer, and was directed by the Canadian director Ted Kotcheff and adapted by the American &quot;beat&quot; novelist Terry Southern in his first screenwriting job. Unlike other British television versions, it still exists, and has been released on DVD.

It was adapted for Australian television in 1960.

An experimental video by Christopher Kondek and Elizabeth LeCompte showcases the production of the play by the New York-based performance troupe The Wooster Group, starring Kate Valk and Willem Dafoe.

<doc id="73453" wikidata="Q11841" url="?curid=73453" title="Cinderella">
<text>&quot;Cinderella&quot;, or &quot;The Little Glass Slipper&quot;, is a folk tale with thousands of variants that are told throughout the world. The protagonist is a young girl living in forsaken circumstances who is suddenly blessed by remarkable fortune, with her ascension to the throne via marriage. The story of Rhodopis, recounted by the Greek geographer Strabo sometime between 7 BC and AD 23, about a Greek slave girl who marries the king of Egypt, is usually considered to be the earliest known variant of the Cinderella story.

The first literary European version of the story was published in Italy by Giambattista Basile in his &quot;Pentamerone&quot; in 1634; the version that is now most widely known in the English-speaking world was published in French by Charles Perrault in &quot;Histoires ou contes du temps passé&quot; in 1697 as &quot;Cendrillon&quot; and was anglicized as &quot;Cinderella&quot;. Another version was later published as &quot;Aschenputtel&quot; by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot; in 1812.

Although the story&#x27;s title and main character&#x27;s name change in different languages, in English-language folklore Cinderella is an archetypal name. The word Cinderella has, by analogy, come to mean someone whose attributes are unrecognized, or someone who unexpectedly achieves recognition or success after a period of obscurity and neglect. In the world of sports, &quot;a Cinderella&quot; is used for an underrated team or club winning over stronger and more favored competitors. The still-popular story of Cinderella continues to influence popular culture internationally, lending plot elements, allusions, and tropes to a wide variety of media.

==Ancient versions==
===European===

The oldest known oral version of the Cinderella story is the ancient Greek story of Rhodopis, a Greek courtesan living in the colony of Naucratis in Egypt, whose name means &quot;Rosy-Cheeks&quot;. The story is first recorded by the Greek geographer Strabo in his &quot;Geographica&quot; (book 17, 33): &quot;They [the Egyptians] tell the fabulous story that, when she was bathing, an eagle snatched one of her sandals from her maid and carried it to Memphis; and while the king was administering justice in the open air, the eagle, when it arrived above his head, flung the sandal into his lap; and the king, stirred both by the beautiful shape of the sandal and by the strangeness of the occurrence, sent men in all directions into the country in quest of the woman who wore the sandal; and when she was found in the city of Naucratis, she was brought up to Memphis, and became the wife of the king.&quot;

The same story is also later reported by the Roman orator Aelian ( – ) in his &quot;Miscellaneous History&quot;, which was written entirely in Greek. Aelian&#x27;s story closely resembles the story told by Strabo, but adds that the name of the pharaoh in question was Psammetichus. Aelian&#x27;s account indicates that the story of Rhodopis remained popular throughout antiquity.

Herodotus, some five centuries before Strabo, records a popular legend about a possibly related courtesan named Rhodopis in his &quot;Histories&quot;, claiming that she came from Thrace, was the slave of Iadmon of Samos and a fellow-slave of the story-teller Aesop, was taken to Egypt in the time of Pharaoh Amasis, and freed there for a large sum by Charaxus of Mytilene, brother of Sappho the lyric poet.

The resemblance of the shoe-testing of Rhodopis with Cinderella&#x27;s slipper has already been noted in the 19th century, by Edgar Taylor and Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould.

====Aspasia of Phocaea====

A second predecessor for the Cinderella character, hailing from late Antiquity, may be Aspasia of Phocaea. Her story is told in Aelian&#x27;s &quot;Varia Storia&quot;: lost her mother in early childhood and raised by her father, Aspasia, despite living in poverty, has dreamt of meeting a noble man. As she dozes off, the girl has a vision of a dove transforming into a woman, who instructs her on how to remove a physical imperfection and restore her own beauty. In another episode, she and other courtesans are made to attend a feast hosted by Persian regent Cyrus the Younger. During the banquet, the Persian King sets his sights on Aspasia herself and ignores the other women.

====&quot;Le Fresne&quot;====

The twelfth-century of (&quot;The Ash-Tree Girl&quot;), retold by Marie de France, is a variant of the &quot;Cinderella&quot; story in which a wealthy noblewoman abandons her infant daughter at the base of an ash tree outside a nunnery with a ring and brocade as tokens of her identity because she is one of twin sisters—the mother fears that she will be accused of infidelity (according to popular belief, twins were evidence of two different fathers). The infant is discovered by the porter, who names her , meaning &quot;Ash Tree&quot;, and she is raised by the nuns. After she has attained maturity, a young nobleman sees her and becomes her lover. The nobleman, however, is forced to marry a woman of noble birth. Fresne accepts that she will never marry her beloved but waits in the wedding chamber as a handmaiden. She covers the bed with her own brocade but, unknown to her, her beloved&#x27;s bride is actually her twin sister, and her mother recognizes the brocade as the same one she had given to the daughter she had abandoned so many years before. Fresne&#x27;s true parentage is revealed and, as a result of her noble birth, she is allowed to marry her beloved, while her twin sister is married to a different nobleman.

==== from Malta====
The Maltese Cinderella is named . She is portrayed as an orphaned child in her early childhood. Before his death, her father gave her three magical objects: a chestnut, a nut and an almond. She used to work as a servant in the King&#x27;s palace. Nobody ever took notice of the poor girl. One day she heard of a big ball and with the help of a magical spell turned herself into a beautiful princess. The prince fell in love with her and gave her a ring. On the following night the Prince gave her a diamond and on the third night he gave her a ring with a large gem on it. By the end of the ball would run away hiding herself in the cellars of the Palace. She knew that the Prince was very sad about her disappearance so one day she made some krustini (typical Maltese biscuits) for him and hid the three gifts in each of them. When the Prince ate the biscuits he found the gifts he had given to the mysterious Princess and soon realized the huge mistake he had made of ignoring because of her poor looks. They soon made marriage arrangements and she became his wife.

===Outside Europe===
The tale of Ye Xian first appeared in &quot;Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang&quot; written by Duan Chengshi around 860. In this version, Ye Xian is the daughter of the local tribal leader whose mother died when she was young. Because her mother died early, she is now under the care of her father&#x27;s second wife, who abused her. She befriends a fish, which is the reincarnation of her deceased mother. Her stepmother and half-sister kill the fish, but Ye Xian finds the bones, which are magical, and they help her dress appropriately for a local Festival, including a very light golden shoe. Her stepfamily recognizes her at the festival, causing her to flee and accidentally lose the shoe. Afterwards, the king of another island obtains the shoe and is curious about it as no one has feet that can fit the shoe. The King searches everywhere and finally reaches Ye&#x27;s house, where she tries on the shoe. The king realises she is the one and takes her back to his kingdom. Her cruel stepmother and half-sister are killed by flying rocks. Variants of the story are also found in many ethnic groups in China.

====&quot; and &quot;====
&quot;The Story of and&quot;, from Vietnam, is similar to the Chinese version. The heroine Tấm also had a fish that was killed by the stepmother and the half-sister, and its bones also give her clothes. Later after marrying the king, Tấm was killed by her stepmother and sister, and reincarnated several times in form of a bird, a loom and a gold apple. She finally reunited with the king and lived happily ever after. Cam asked her about her beauty secret. Tam lead her to a hole and told her to jump inside. She then commanded the royal guards to pour boiling water on Cam. Her corpse was used to make a fermented sauce, to which she sent to the stepmother. The stepmother ate it with every single meal. After she reached the bottom of the jar, she looked down only to see her daughter&#x27;s skull. She died of shock.

There are many variations for the ending of this story, with the family friendly version one usually ending with the stepmother and Cam being exiled, and then struck by lightning, killing them both. Other versions either have a different ending for the story or simply omit the revenge part entirely.

==== &quot;Kongjwi and Patjwi&quot; ====
Originating from Korea, Kongjwi and Patjwi is a tale similar to Disney&#x27;s Cinderella, with two distinguishing characteristics: the degree of violence and the plot&#x27;s continuance past the marriage to the prince charming. The protagonist, Kongjwi, loses her mother when she was a child and her father remarries a widow. The widow also has a daughter, named Patjwi. After her father passes, the stepmother and Patjwi abuse Kongjwi by starving, beating, and working her brutally. Kongjwi is aided by animals and supernatural helpers, like a cow, a toad, a flock of birds, and a fairy. These helpers aid Kongjwi in attending a dance in honor of a magistrate. On her way back from the dance, Kongjwi loses one of her shoes, and the magistrate searches the towns to find the one who can fit the shoe. When he finds Kongjwi, he marries her.

Where Disney&#x27;s Cinderella ends, Kongjwi&#x27;s hardships continue into the marriage. Patjwi, envious of this marriage, pretends to ask for Kongjwi&#x27;s forgiveness and then drowns Kongjwi in a pond. Patjwi then pretends to be Kongjwi and marries the magistrate. Kongjwi is then reincarnated into a lotus flower, burned by Patjwi, and reincarnated once more into a marble. With help from additional characters, Kongjwi is able to inform her husband of Patjwi&#x27;s doings. As punishment, Patjwi is ripped apart alive, her body made into jeotgal, and sent to her mother. She eats it in ignorance, and when told that it is Patjwi&#x27;s flesh, she dies out of shock. There are 17 variants of this tale known in South Korea.

A notable difference from Disney&#x27;s Cinderella is that Kongjwi is not a helpless maiden who relies on a man of greater power to solve her problems. Kongjwi avenges her death with her own determination and willpower. Unlike Perrault&#x27;s version of Cinderella, named Cendrillon, who forgives her stepfamily when they plead for forgiveness, Kongjwi takes ownership of the principle of () and accomplishes her vengeance herself. The violent degree of the punishments stems from the increased violence (starvation, beating, betrayal, and ultimately murder) that Kongjwi suffered compared to the abuses Disney&#x27;s Cinderella went through.

====Other Asian versions====
There exists a Cambodian version (called &quot;Khmer&quot; by the collectors) with the name &quot;Néang Kantoc&quot;. Its collectors compared it to the Vietnamese story of &quot;Tam and Cam&quot;.

Another version was collected from the Cham people of Southeast Asia, with the name (&quot;The Golden Sandal&quot;) or (&quot;The tale of the ladies Hulek and Kjong&quot;).

In Indonesian and Malay folklore there is a similar story with the name &quot;Bawang Merah dan Bawang Putih&quot; (&quot;The tale of Shallot and Garlic&quot;).

20th century folktale collector Kenichi Mizusawa published an analysis of Japanese variants of Cinderella, separating them into two types: &quot;Nukabuku, Komebuku&quot; (about rival step-sisters) and &quot;Ubagawa&quot; (about the heroine&#x27;s disguise).

====West Asian versions====

The Iranian version of the story is called Moon-Forehead or in Persian, Mahpishooni (). The story is very similar to the German version but the girl is described as having been born with a shining moon on her forehead and after losing her natural mother, was forced to live under the ashes, to block her shining moon that could overshadow the two daughters of her stepmother. The contrast between the shining moon and ash denotes potential, similar to fire under the ashes. The location of the shine on the forehead could be a reference to superior knowledge or personality.

German scholar listed the Iranian variants of &quot;Cinderella&quot; under tale type *510A, &quot;Aschenputtel&quot;, and noted that, in Iranian tradition, the type only exists in combination with type 480, .

====&quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;====
Several different variants of the story appear in the medieval &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, also known as the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, including &quot;The Second Shaykh&#x27;s Story&quot;, &quot;The Eldest Lady&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;Abdallah ibn Fadil and His Brothers&quot;, all dealing with the theme of a younger sibling harassed by two jealous elders. In some of these, the siblings are female, while in others, they are male. One of the tales, &quot;Judar and His Brethren&quot;, departs from the happy endings of previous variants and reworks the plot to give it a tragic ending instead, with the younger brother being poisoned by his elder brothers.

==Literary versions==

The first European version written in prose was published in Naples, Italy, by Giambattista Basile, in his &quot;Pentamerone&quot; (1634). The story itself was set in the Kingdom of Naples, at that time the most important political and cultural center of Southern Italy and among the most influential capitals in Europe, and written in the Neapolitan dialect. It was later retold, along with other Basile tales, by Charles Perrault in &quot;Histoires ou contes du temps passé&quot; (1697), and by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot; (1812).

The name &quot;Cenerentola&quot; derives from the Italian word &quot;cenere&quot; &quot;ash, cinder,&quot; an allusion to the fact that servants and s of the time were usually soiled with ash, partly as a result of their cleaning duties and partly because they lived in cold basements and so tended to huddle close to fireplaces for warmth.

===&quot;La gatta Cenerentola&quot;, by Basile===
Giambattista Basile, a writer, soldier and government official, assembled a set of oral folk tales into a written collection titled &quot;Lo cunto de li cunti&quot; (&quot;The Story of Stories&quot;), or &quot;Pentamerone&quot;. It included the tale of Cenerentola, which features a wicked stepmother and evil stepsisters, magical transformations, a missing slipper, and a hunt by a monarch for the owner of the slipper. It was published posthumously in 1634.

Plot:
:A prince has a daughter, Zezolla (tonnie) (the Cinderella figure), who is tended by a beloved governess. The governess, with Zezolla&#x27;s help, persuades the prince to marry her. The governess then brings forward six daughters of her own, who abuse Zezolla (tonnie) and send her into the kitchen to work as a servant. The prince goes to the island of Sinia, meets a fairy who gives presents to his daughter, and brings back for her: a golden spade, a golden bucket, a silken napkin, and a date seedling. The girl cultivates the tree, and when the king hosts a ball, Zezolla appears dressed richly by a fairy living in the date tree. The king falls in love with her, but Zezolla runs away before he can find out who she is. Twice Zezolla escapes the king and his servants. The third time, the king&#x27;s servant captures one of her pattens. The king invites all of the maidens in the land to a ball with a patten-test, identifies Zezolla (tonnie) after the patten jumps from his hand to her foot, and eventually marries her.

===&quot;Cendrillon ou la petite pantoufle de verre&quot;, by Perrault===

One of the most popular versions of Cinderella was written in French by Charles Perrault in 1697, under the name &quot;Cendrillon ou la petite pantoufle de verre&quot;. The popularity of his tale was due to his additions to the story, including the pumpkin, the fairy-godmother and the introduction of &quot;glass&quot; slippers.

Plot:
A wealthy widower marries a proud and haughty woman as his second wife. She has two daughters, who are equally vain and selfish. But the man also has a beautiful young daughter from his first wife, a girl of unparalleled kindness and sweet temper. The stepmother, jealous of the young girl because her good graces show up her own two daughters&#x27; faults, forces her into servitude, where the girl is made to work day and night doing menial chores. After her chores are done for the day, she curls up near the fireplace in an effort to stay warm. She often arises covered in ashes, giving rise to the mocking nickname &quot;Cendrillon&quot; (Cinderella) by her stepsisters. Cinderella bears the abuse patiently and does not tell her father, who would have scolded her.

One day, the prince invites all the people in the land to a royal ball. The two stepsisters gleefully plan their wardrobes for the ball, and taunt Cinderella by telling her that maids are not invited to the ball.

As the two stepsisters and the stepmother depart to the ball, Cinderella cries in despair. Her fairy godmother magically appears and immediately begins to transform Cinderella from house servant to the young lady she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to the ball. She turns a pumpkin into a golden carriage, mice into horses, a rat into a coachman, and lizards into footmen. She then turns Cinderella&#x27;s rags into a beautiful jeweled gown, complete with a delicate pair of glass slippers. The Fairy Godmother tells her to enjoy the ball, but warns her that she must return before midnight, when the spells will be broken.

At the ball, the entire court is entranced by Cinderella, especially the Prince. At this first ball, Cinderella remembers to leave before midnight. Back home, Cinderella graciously thanks her Fairy Godmother. She then innocently greets the two stepsisters, who had not recognized her earlier, and talk of nothing but the beautiful girl at the ball.

Another ball is held the next evening, and Cinderella again attends with her Fairy Godmother&#x27;s help. The prince has become even more infatuated with the mysterious woman at the ball, and Cinderella in turn becomes so enchanted by him she loses track of time and leaves only at the final stroke of midnight, losing one of her glass slippers on the steps of the palace in her haste. The Prince chases her, but outside the palace, the guards see only a simple country girl leave. The prince pockets the slipper and vows to find and marry the girl to whom it belongs. Meanwhile, Cinderella keeps the other slipper, which does not disappear when the spell is broken.

The prince&#x27;s herald tries the slipper on all the women in the kingdom. When the herald arrives at Cinderella&#x27;s home, the two stepsisters try in vain to win him over. Cinderella asks if she may try, but the two stepsisters taunt her. Naturally, the slipper fits perfectly, and Cinderella produces the other slipper for good measure. Cinderella&#x27;s stepfamily pleads for forgiveness, and Cinderella agrees. Cinderella had hoped her step-family would love her always. Cinderella marries the prince and forgives her two stepsisters, then marrying them off to two wealthy noblemen of the court. They all lived happily ever after.

The first moral of the story is that beauty is a treasure, but graciousness is priceless. Without it, nothing is possible; with it, one can do anything.

However, the second moral of the story mitigates the first one and reveals the criticism that Perrault is aiming at: That &quot;without doubt it is a great advantage to have intelligence, courage, good breeding, and common sense. These, and similar talents come only from heaven, and it is good to have them. However, even these may fail to bring you success, without the blessing of a godfather or a godmother.&quot;

===&quot;Aschenputtel&quot;, by the Brothers Grimm===
Another well-known version was recorded by the German brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in the 19th century. The tale is called &quot;Aschenputtel&quot; or &quot;Ashputtle&quot; or &quot;Ashputtel&quot; [&quot;The Little Ash Girl&quot;] (or &quot;Cinderella&quot; in English translations). This version is much more violent than that of Charles Perrault and Disney, in that Cinderella&#x27;s father has not died and the two stepsisters mutilate their feet to fit in the golden slipper. There is no fairy godmother in this version of the Brothers Grimm, but rather help comes from a wishing tree, which the heroine had planted on her deceased mother&#x27;s grave, when she recites a certain chant. In the second edition of their collection (1819), the Brothers Grimm supplemented the original 1812 version with a coda in which the two stepsisters suffer a terrible punishment by the princess Cinderella for their cruelty. A fairy tale very similar to the Grimm one, &quot;Aschenbrödel&quot;, was published by Ludwig Bechstein in 1845 in &quot;Deutsches Märchenbuch&quot;.

====Summary====
A wealthy gentleman&#x27;s wife falls gravely ill, and as she lies on her deathbed, she calls for her only daughter, and tells her to remain good and kind, as God would protect her. She then dies and is buried. The child visits her mother&#x27;s grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl&#x27;s fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname &quot;Aschenputtel&quot; (&quot;Ashfool&quot;). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother&#x27;s grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.

One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The elder one asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother&#x27;s grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.

The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters&#x27; chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.
The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, claiming her as his dance partner whenever a gentleman asks for her hand, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside the estate&#x27;s pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped from the back, to the graveyard to the hazel tree to return her fine clothes. The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth, and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch. The prince picks the slipper and proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.

The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel&#x27;s house and tries the slipper on the elder stepsister. Since she will have no more need to go on foot when she will be queen, the sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king&#x27;s castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that his dead wife left a &quot;dirty little Cinderella&quot; in the house, omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and hands, and when she puts on the slipper, which fitted her like a glove, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival, even before trying it. To the horror of the stepmother and the two limping sisters, their merely servant-girl had won without any subterfuge. The prince put Aschenputtel before him on his horse and rode off to the palace. While passing the hazel tree the two magic doves from heaven declare Aschenputtel as the true bride of the prince, and remained on her shoulders, one on the left and the other on the right.

In a coda added in the second edition of 1819, during Aschenputtel&#x27;s royal wedding, the stepsisters had hoped to worm their way into her favour as the future queen. As she walks down the aisle with her stepsisters as her bridesmaids, Aschenputtel&#x27;s doves strike the two stepsisters&#x27; eyes, one in the left and the other in the right. It is their last chance of redemption, but since they are desperate to win the new princess&#x27; affections, they don&#x27;t give up and go through the ceremony, so when the wedding comes to an end, and Aschenputtel and her beloved prince march out of the church, her doves fly again, promptly striking the remaining eyes of the two evil stepsisters blind, a truly awful comeuppance they have to endure.

==== 1812 version ====
In addition to the absence of the punishment of the stepsisters, there are other minor differences in the first edition of 1812, some of which are reminiscent of Perrault&#x27;s version. In the first edition, Cinderella&#x27;s mother herself tells her to plant a tree on her grave. No bird perches on the tree but the tree itself gives the girl what she wants. The birds appear only when they help Cinderella collect lentils, a task that is assigned to her by her stepsisters rather than her stepmother, and they are not a flock but just two pigeons. On the evening of the first ball, Cinderella does not participate but she watches her stepsisters dance with the prince from the pigeon coop. Later Cinderella tells the sisters she saw them dancing, and they destroy the pigeon coop out of jealousy. In the 1812 version the tree also gives Cinderella a carriage with six horses to go to the ball and the pigeons tell her to return before midnight. The episodes in which Cinderella hides in the pigeon coop and on the pear tree were added in the 1819 version. Furthermore, not knowing Cinderella&#x27;s home, the prince makes other girls in the kingdom try on the slipper before her.

==Plot variations and alternative tellings==

Folklorists have long studied variants on this tale across cultures. In 1893, Marian Roalfe Cox, commissioned by the Folklore Society of Britain, produced &quot;Cinderella: Three Hundred and Forty-Five Variants of Cinderella, Catskin and, Cap o&#x27;Rushes, Abstracted and Tabulated with a Discussion of Medieval Analogues and Notes.&quot; Further morphology studies have continued on this seminal work.

Joseph Jacobs has attempted to reconstruct the original tale as &quot;The Cinder Maid&quot; by comparing the common features among hundreds of variants collected across Europe. The Aarne–Thompson–Uther system classifies &quot;Cinderella&quot; as type 510A, &quot;Persecuted Heroine&quot;. Others of this type include &quot;The Sharp Grey Sheep&quot;; &quot;The Golden Slipper&quot;; &quot;The Story of Tam and Cam&quot;; &quot;Rushen Coatie&quot;; &quot;The Wonderful Birch&quot;; &quot;Fair, Brown and Trembling&quot;; and &quot;Katie Woodencloak&quot;.

===The magical help===
International versions lack the fairy godmother present in the famous Perrault&#x27;s tale. Instead, the donor is her mother, incarnated into an animal (if she is dead) or transformed into a cow (if alive). In other versions, the helper is an animal, such as a cow, a bull, a pike, or a saint or angel. The bovine helper appears in some Greek versions, in &quot;the Balkan-Slavonic tradition of the tale&quot;, and in some Central Asian variants. The mother-as-cow is killed by the heroine&#x27;s sisters, her bones gathered and from her grave the heroine gets the wonderful dresses.

Africanist Sigrid Schmidt stated that &quot;a typical scene&quot; in Kapmalaien (Cape Malays) tales is the mother becoming a fish, being eaten in fish form, the daughter burying her bones and a tree sprouting from her grave.

Professor Gražina Skabeikytė-Kazlauskienė recognizes that the fish, the cow, even a female dog (in other variants), these animals represent &quot;the [heroine&#x27;s] mother&#x27;s legacy&quot;. Jack Zipes, commenting on a Sicilian variant, concluded much the same: Cinderella is helped by her mother &quot;in the guise of doves, fairies, and godmothers&quot;. In his notes to his own reconstruction, Joseph Jacobs acknowledged that the heroine&#x27;s animal helper (e.g., cow or sheep) was &quot;clearly identified with her mother&quot;, as well as the tree on Cinderella&#x27;s mother&#x27;s grave was connected to her.

===Villains===
Although many variants of Cinderella feature the wicked stepmother, the defining trait of type 510A is a female persecutor: in &quot;Fair, Brown and Trembling&quot; and &quot;Finette Cendron&quot;, the stepmother does not appear at all, and it is the older sisters who confine her to the kitchen. In other fairy tales featuring the ball, she was driven from home by the persecutions of her father, usually because he wished to marry her. Of this type (510B) are &quot;Cap O&#x27; Rushes&quot;, &quot;Catskin&quot;, and &quot;Allerleirauh&quot; (or &quot;All-Kinds-of-Fur&quot;), and she slaves in the kitchen because she found a job there. In &quot;Katie Woodencloak&quot;, the stepmother drives her from home, and she likewise finds such a job.

In &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;, Gioachino Rossini inverted the sex roles: Cenerentola is mistreated by her stepfather. (This makes the opera Aarne-Thompson type 510B.) He also made the economic basis for such hostility unusually clear, in that Don Magnifico wishes to make his own daughters&#x27; dowries larger, to attract a grander match, which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry. Folklorists often interpret the hostility between the stepmother and stepdaughter as just such a competition for resources, but seldom does the tale make it clear.

In some retellings, at least one stepsister is somewhat kind to Cinderella and second guesses the Stepmother&#x27;s treatment. This is seen in &quot;Ever After&quot;, the two direct-to-video sequels to Walt Disney&#x27;s 1950 film, and the 2013 Broadway musical.

===Ball, ballgown, and curfew===
The number of balls varies, sometimes one, sometimes two, and sometimes three, and neither does the event have to be a ball, with some heroines going to church instead. The fairy godmother is Perrault&#x27;s own addition to the tale. The person who aided Cinderella (Aschenputtel) in the Grimms&#x27;s version is her dead mother. Aschenputtel requests her aid by praying at her grave, on which a tree is growing. Helpful doves roosting in the tree shake down the clothing she needs for the ball. This motif is found in other variants of the tale as well, such as in the Finnish &quot;The Wonderful Birch&quot;. Playwright James Lapine incorporated this motif into the Cinderella plotline of the musical &quot;Into the Woods&quot;. Giambattista Basile&#x27;s &quot;La gatta Cenerentola&quot; combined them; the Cinderella figure, Zezolla, asks her father to commend her to the Dove of Fairies and ask her to send her something, and she receives a tree that will provide her clothing. Other variants have her helped by talking animals, as in &quot;Katie Woodencloak&quot;, &quot;Rushen Coatie&quot;, &quot;Bawang Putih Bawang Merah&quot;, &quot;The Story of Tam and Cam&quot;, or &quot;The Sharp Grey Sheep&quot;—these animals often having some connection with her dead mother; in &quot;The Golden Slipper&quot;, a fish aids her after she puts it in water. In &quot;The Anklet&quot;, it&#x27;s a magical alabaster pot the girl purchased with her own money that brings her the gowns and the anklets she wears to the ball. Gioachino Rossini, having agreed to do an opera based on &quot;Cinderella&quot; if he could omit all magical elements, wrote &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;, in which she was aided by Alidoro, a philosopher and formerly the Prince&#x27;s tutor.

The midnight curfew is also absent in many versions; Cinderella leaves the ball to get home before her stepmother and stepsisters, or she is simply tired. In the Grimms&#x27; version, Aschenputtel slips away when she is tired, hiding on her father&#x27;s estate in a tree, and then the pigeon coop, to elude her pursuers; her father tries to catch her by chopping them down, but she escapes.

===Identifying item===

The glass slipper is unique to Charles Perrault&#x27;s version and its derivatives; in other versions of the tale it may be made of other materials (in the version recorded by the Brothers Grimm, German: &quot;Aschenbroedel&quot; and &quot;Aschenputtel&quot;, for instance, it is gold) and in still other tellings, it is not a slipper but an anklet, a ring, or a bracelet that gives the prince the key to Cinderella&#x27;s identity. What matters to the story is that the identifying item will fit only one woman.

In Rossini&#x27;s opera &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; (&quot;Cinderella&quot;), the slipper is replaced by twin bracelets to prove her identity. In the Finnish variant &quot;The Wonderful Birch&quot;, the prince uses tar to gain something every ball, and so has a ring, a circlet, and a pair of slippers. Some interpreters, perhaps troubled by sartorial impracticalities, have suggested that Perrault&#x27;s &quot;glass slipper&quot; (&quot;pantoufle de verre&quot;) had been a &quot;squirrel fur slipper&quot; (&quot;pantoufle de vair&quot;) in some unidentified earlier version of the tale, and that Perrault or one of his sources confused the words. However, most scholars believe the glass slipper was a deliberate piece of poetic invention on Perrault&#x27;s part. Nabokov has Professor Timofey Pnin assert as fact that &quot;Cendrillon&#x27;s shoes were not made of glass but of Russian squirrel fur – &quot;vair&quot;, in French&quot;.

The 1950 Disney adaptation takes advantage of the slipper being made of glass to add a twist whereby the slipper is shattered by the spiteful stepmother just before Cinderella has the chance to try it on. Earlier in the film the Duke warns that the slipper could fit any number of women, but Cinderella then produces the beautiful matching slipper, proving beyond all doubt that she is the one from the ball.

===Revelation===
In many variants of the tale, the prince is told that Cinderella can not possibly be the one, as she is too dirty and ragged. Often, this is said by the stepmother or stepsisters. In the Grimms&#x27; version, both the stepmother and the father urge it. The prince nevertheless insists on her trying. Cinderella arrives and proves her identity by fitting into the slipper or other item (in some cases she has kept the other).

===Conclusion===
According to Korean scholarship, East Asian versions of &quot;Cinderella&quot; &quot;typically&quot; continue as the heroine&#x27;s stepmother replaces the Cinderella-like character for her own daughter, while the heroine goes through a cycle of transformations. Such tales continue the fairy tale into what is in effect a second episode.

In &quot;The Thousand Nights and A Night&quot;, in a tale called &quot;The Anklet&quot;, the stepsisters make a comeback by using twelve magical hairpins to turn the bride into a dove on her wedding night. In &quot;The Wonderful Birch&quot;, the stepmother, a witch, manages to substitute her daughter for the true bride after she has given birth.

===Theatre===

In 1804, &quot;Cinderella&quot; was presented at Drury Lane Theatre, London, described as &quot;A new Grand Allegorical Pantomimic Spectacle&quot;, though it was very far in style and content from the modern pantomime. However, it included notable clown Joseph Grimaldi playing the part of a servant called Pedro, the antecedent of today&#x27;s character Buttons. In 1820 &quot;Harlequin and Cinderella&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden had much of the modern story (taken from the opera La Cenerentola) by Rossini, but was a Harlequinade, again featuring Grimaldi. In 1830, Rophino Lacy used Rossini&#x27;s music, but with spoken dialogue in a comic opera with many of the main characters: the Baron, the two stepsisters and Pedro the servant all as comic characters, plus a Fairy Queen instead of a magician. However, it was the conversion of this via burlesque and rhyming couplets by Henry Byron that led to what was effectively the modern pantomime in both story and style at the Royal Strand Theatre in 1860: &quot;Cinderella! Or the Lover, the Lackey, and the Little Glass Slipper&quot;.

In the traditional pantomime version, the opening scene takes place in a forest with a hunt in progress; here, Cinderella first meets Prince Charming and his &quot;right-hand man&quot; Dandini, whose name and character come from Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s opera (&quot;La Cenerentola&quot;). Cinderella mistakes Dandini for the Prince, and the Prince for Dandini. Her father, Baron Hardup, is under the thumb of his two stepdaughters, the Ugly sisters, and has a servant, Cinderella&#x27;s friend Buttons. Throughout the pantomime, the Baron is continually harassed by the Broker&#x27;s Men (often named after current politicians) for outstanding rent. The Fairy Godmother must magically create a coach (from a pumpkin), footmen (from mice), a coach driver (from a frog), and a beautiful dress (from rags) for Cinderella to go to the ball. However, she must return by midnight, as it is then that the spell ceases.

===Musicals===
*&quot;Cinderella&quot; by Rodgers and Hammerstein was produced for television three times and staged live in various productions. A version ran in 1958 at the London Coliseum with a cast including Tommy Steele, Yana, Jimmy Edwards, Kenneth Williams and Betty Marsden. This version was augmented with several other Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s songs, plus one written by Steele, &quot;You and Me&quot;. In 2013, a Broadway production opened, with a new book by Douglas Carter Beane, and ran for 770 performances. In the acclaimed 2022 VTT production of &quot;Cinderella&quot;, Naomi Infeld will be playing Anastasia.
*&quot;Mr. Cinders&quot;, a musical, opened at the Adelphi Theatre, London in 1929 and was adapted as a film version in 1934.
*&quot;Cindy&quot;, a 1964 Off-Broadway musical, was composed by Johnny Brandon and has had many revivals.
*&quot;La Gatta Cenerentola&quot;, a 1976 Italian musical in Neapolitan language with music and lyrics by Roberto De Simone, based on Giambattista Basile&#x27;s version of the story.

It opened on Broadway in 1987, and has won many awards, such as Best Score and Book of a Musical in the 1988 Tony Awards. Throughout the show, Cinderella interacts with many other fairytale characters, such as Little Red Riding Hood and Jack and the Beanstalk.
*&quot;Cinderella&quot; is a musical composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber that premiered in the West End on August 18, 2021 and closed on June 12, 2022. It later opened on Broadway with the new title &quot;Bad Cinderella&quot;. The show closed after 85 performances, marking the end of a continuous 44-year period in which one or more of Lloyd Webber&#x27;s shows played on Broadway.
*&quot;Cinderella&#x27;s Castle&quot;, an upcoming musical by Team Starkid was announced in March 2024, and set to showcase in the summer of 2024. The book is by Nick &amp; Matt Lang, with music and lyrics by Jeff Blim.

<text>The Exploits of Elaine is a 1914 American film serial in the damsel in distress genre of &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; (1914).

&quot;The Exploits of Elaine&quot; tells the story of a young woman named Elaine who, with the help of a detective, tries to find the man, known only as &quot;The Clutching Hand&quot;, who murdered her father. The Clutching Hand was the first mystery villain to appear in a film serial. The concept was widely used for the remainder of the format&#x27;s existence.

The serial stars Pearl White (who also starred in &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot;), Arnold Daly, Sheldon Lewis, Creighton Hale, and Riley Hatch. Lionel Barrymore had a small role. The serial was written by Arthur B. Reeve (novel), Charles W. Goddard, and George B. Seitz, and directed by Louis J. Gasnier, Seitz, and Leopold Wharton. The film was produced by the Wharton Studio of Ithaca, New York, and distributed by Pathé Exchange, the American distribution branch of the French company Pathé at that time. Pathé was the largest film equipment and production company in the world during the first part of the 20th century.

The film was followed in 1915 by &quot;The New Exploits of Elaine&quot;.

The serial, which is extant, was named to the United States National Film Registry in 1994 for its cultural and historic importance.

==Cast==
* Pearl White - Elaine Dodge
* Arnold Daly - Detective Craig Kennedy
* Creighton Hale - Walter Jameson (Ep. 1, 2, 3)
* Raymond Owens - Walter Jameson (Ep. 4–14)
* Sheldon Lewis - Perry Bennett / The Clutching Hand. Sheldon Lewis, as the handsome attorney Perry Bennett and The Clutching Hand, was &quot;the first in the serial genre&#x27;s long parade of unknown menaces.&quot;
* Edwin Arden - Wu Fang
* Leroy Baker - The Butler
* Bessie Wharton - Aunt Josephine, Mrs. Dodge
* Riley Hatch - President Dodge (as William Riley Hatch)

* Robin H. Townley - Limpy Red
* Floyd Buckley - Michael
* Lionel Barrymore - Undetermined Role
* M.W. Rale - Wong Lang Sin, a Yellow Peril character, who wants the Clutching Hand&#x27;s treasure map. He became just an agent of Wu Fang in the sequel. Wu Fang appeared in several Pearl White serials.

==Production==
&quot;The Exploits of Elaine&quot; was based on a book in the &quot;Craig Kennedy, Scientific Detective&quot; series by Arthur B. Reeve. It was a prototype for the scientific mystery serials but has less interest for later audiences. A lot of the technology and science demonstrated in the serial soon became out of date or considered mundane. For example, the serial has to explain the concept of fingerprinting in dramatic fashion. Nevertheless, the serial was a success on its release and led to two sequels, &quot;The New Exploits of Elaine&quot; (1915) and &quot;The Romance of Elaine&quot; (1915).

==Cliffhangers==
Similar to other film serials, each chapter typically closed with a cliffhanger with Elaine in some physical peril or confronted with a shocking revelation. For example, at the close of Chapter 10 Elaine actually dies. She is then brought back to life in the next chapter by Craig Kennedy.

==Critical reception==
In the opinion of film critic Stedman, this serial is an improvement on &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot;, with better acting, script, and direction.

==Chapter titles==
# &quot;The Clutching Hand&quot;
# &quot;The Twilight Sleep&quot;
# &quot;The Vanishing Jewels&quot;
# &quot;The Frozen Safe&quot;
# &quot;The Poisoned Room&quot;
# &quot;The Vampire&quot;
# &quot;The Double Trap&quot;
# &quot;The Hidden Voice&quot;
# &quot;The Death Ray&quot;
# &quot;The Life Current&quot;
# &quot;The Hour of Three&quot;
# &quot;The Blood Crystals&quot;
# &quot;The Devil Worshippers&quot;
# &quot;The Reckoning&quot;

<text>Lake Saint-Louis (, ) is a lake in southwestern Quebec, Canada, at the confluence of the Saint Lawrence and Ottawa rivers. The Saint Lawrence Seaway passes through the lake.

Lake St. Louis is a widening of the St. Lawrence River in the Hochelaga Archipelago. It is also fed by the Ottawa River via the Lake of Two Mountains at Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, the Beauharnois Canal, the Soulanges Canal, the Saint-Louis River, and the Châteauguay River.

The lake is bounded to the north and the east by the Island of Montreal, by Beauharnois-Salaberry, Roussillon, and Vaudreuil-Soulanges. The town of Beauharnois with its power-dam and canal lie to the south.

The West Island shore is mostly built up with private houses, but it includes some parks and clubs such as the Pointe-Claire Canoe Club, and the Pointe-Claire Yacht Club. Islands in the lake include Dorval and Dowker Islands. Lake St. Louis is the second of three fluvial lakes on the St. Lawrence River; upstream of it is Lake Saint Francis, and downstream is Lake Saint Pierre. Lake St. Louis has an average flow of .

The lake has many species of fish, including yellow perch.

A small map by Samuel Champlain of 1611 names the lake. The same year, Champlain reported that a young man named Louys was drowned in what is now known as the Lachine Rapids, and in 1870 Charles-Honoré Laverdière stated that the rapids, and later the lake, were named in honour of the drowned man. A 1656 Jesuit account describes a crossing «Lac Saint Louys».

In 2014 there was a report of fecal coliform flowing into the lake from a Beaconsfield creek, and of PCBs flowing into it from a Pointe-Claire industrial site.

<text>The Fall of the House of Usher (1928) is a short silent horror film adaptation of the 1839 short story &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe. The movie was co-directed by James Sibley Watson and Melville Webber, and starred Herbert Stern, Hildegarde Watson, and Melville Webber (who also wrote the screenplay). It tells the story of a brother and sister who live under a family curse. An avant-garde experimental film running only 13 minutes, the visual element predominates, including shots through prisms to create optical distortion. There is no dialogue in the film, though one sequence features letters written in the air moving across the screen.

A music score was written in 1959 for the film by the directors&#x27; friend, composer Alec Wilder. His 1959 score was his second attempt (after the score for winds, brass and percussion which he did for them originally in 1929), and he composed it for a recording of the New York Woodwind Quintet and a percussionist, conducted by Leon Barzin. The film and the 1959 score were later synched together by James Sibley Watson, and this was the version that was placed in the National Film Registry in 2000. Various new scores have been composed to accompany the film, including one by new wave musician Tom Verlaine and guitarist Jimmy Rip, and another by American composer Jean Hasse&#x27;s version (2010) for the UK ensemble Counterpoise (violin, trumpet, saxophone, piano), this version available to view on YouTube.

==Plot==

A traveller arrives at the desolate Usher mansion to find that the sibling inhabitants, Roderick and Madeline Usher, are living under a mysterious family curse: Roderick&#x27;s senses have become painfully acute, while Madeline continues to get weaker with time. When Madeline apparently dies, Roderick has her buried in the family vault, not realizing she is merely in a catatonic state. Madeline awakens in her tomb, and realizing she has been buried alive, descends into madness as she escapes her coffin and seeks revenge.

==Cast==
* Herbert Stern as Roderick Usher
* Hildegarde Watson as Madeline Usher
* Melville Webber
* Friedrich Haak
* Dorothea House

==Criticism==
Film historian Troy Howarth comments: &quot;The use of superimpositions, canted angles and tracking shots combine to create a sense of delirium...(the film) jettisons any pretense of plot and character and focuses instead on the presentation of Expressionistic visual effects. The actors have little opportunity to make much of an impression, and ultimately the film is a minor footnote in the canon of Edgar Allan Poe.&quot;

==Influence==
In 2000, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant film&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

<text>The Ottawa River (, ) is a river in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. It is named after the Algonquin word &quot;to trade&quot;, as it was the major trade route of Eastern Canada at the time. For most of its length, it defines the border between these two provinces. It is a major tributary of the St. Lawrence River and the longest river in Quebec.

==Geography==
The river rises at Lac des Outaouais, north of the Laurentian Mountains of central Quebec, and flows west to Lake Timiskaming. From there its route has been used to define the interprovincial border with Ontario. 

From Lake Timiskaming, the river flows southeast to Ottawa and Gatineau, where it tumbles over Chaudière Falls and further takes in the Rideau and Gatineau rivers.

The Ottawa River drains into the Lake of Two Mountains and the St. Lawrence River at Montreal. The river is long; it drains an area of , 65 per cent in Quebec and the rest in Ontario, with a mean discharge of . It has a maximum depth of at the Carillon Reservoir and is wide at its widest part.

The average annual mean waterflow measured at Carillon dam, near the Lake of Two Mountains, is , with average annual extremes of . Record historic levels since 1964 are a low of in 2010 and a high of in 2017.

The river flows through large areas of deciduous and coniferous forest formed over thousands of years as trees recolonized the Ottawa Valley after the ice age. Generally, the coniferous forests and blueberry bogs occur on old sand plains left by retreating glaciers, or in wetter areas with clay substrate. The deciduous forests, dominated by birch, maple, beech, oak and ash occur in more mesic areas with better soil, generally around the boundary with the La Varendrye Park. These primeval forests were occasionally affected by natural fire, mostly started by lightning, which led to increased reproduction by pine and oak, as well as fire barrens and their associated species. The vast areas of pine were exploited by early loggers. Later generations of logging removed hemlock for use in tanning leather, leaving a permanent deficit of hemlock in most forests. Associated with the logging and early settlement were vast wild fires which not only removed the forests, but led to soil erosion. Consequently, nearly all the forests show varying degrees of human disturbance. Tracts of older forest are uncommon, and hence they are considered of considerable importance for conservation.

The Ottawa River has large areas of wetlands. Some of the more biologically important wetland areas include (going downstream from Pembroke), the Westmeath sand dune/wetland complex, Mississippi Snye, Breckenridge Nature Reserve, Shirleys Bay, Ottawa Beach/Andrew Haydon Park, Petrie Island, the Duck Islands and Greens Creek. The Westmeath sand dune/wetland complex is significant for its relatively pristine sand dunes, few of which remain along the Ottawa River, and the many associated rare plants. Shirleys Bay has a biologically diverse shoreline alvar, as well as one of the largest silver maple swamps along the river. Like all wetlands, these depend upon the seasonal fluctuations in the water level. High water levels help create and maintain silver maple swamps, while low water periods allow many rare wetland plants to grow on the emerged sand and clay flats. There are five principal wetland vegetation types. One is swamp, mostly silver maple. There are four herbaceous vegetation types, named for the dominant plant species in them: &quot;Scirpus&quot;, &quot;Eleocharis&quot;, &quot;Sparganium&quot; and &quot;Typha&quot;. Which type occurs in a particular location depends upon factors such as substrate type, water depth, ice-scour and fertility. Inland, and mostly south of the river, older river channels, which date back to the end of the ice age, and no longer have flowing water, have sometimes filled with a different wetland type, peat bog. Examples include Mer Bleue and Alfred Bog.

==Geology==

The Ottawa River lies in the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben, which is a Mesozoic rift valley that formed 175 million years ago. Much of the river flows through the Canadian Shield, although lower areas flow through limestone plains and glacial deposits.

As the glacial ice sheet began to retreat at the end of the last ice age, the Ottawa River valley, which, along with the St. Lawrence River valley and Lake Champlain, had been depressed to below sea level by the glacier&#x27;s weight, filled with sea water. The resulting arm of the ocean is known as the Champlain Sea. Fossil remains of marine life dating 12 to 10 thousand years ago have been found in marine clay throughout the region. Sand deposits from this era have produced vast plains, often dominated by pine forests, as well as localized areas of sand dunes, such as Westmeath and Constance Bay. Clay deposits from this period have resulted in areas of poor drainage, large swamps, and peat bogs in some ancient channels of this river. Hence, the distribution of forests and wetlands is very much a product of these past glacial events.
Large deposits of a material commonly known as Leda clay also formed. These deposits become highly unstable after heavy rains. Numerous landslides have occurred as a result. The former site of the town of Lemieux, Ontario collapsed into the South Nation River in 1993. The town&#x27;s residents had previously been relocated because of the suspected instability of the earth in that location.

As the land gradually rose again the sea coast retreated and the fresh water courses of today took shape. Following the demise of the Champlain Sea the Ottawa River Valley continued to drain the waters of the emerging Upper Great Lakes basin through Lake Nipissing and the Mattawa River. Owing to the ongoing uplift of the land, the eastward flow became blocked around 4000 years ago. Thereafter Lake Nipissing drained westward, through the French River which later became a link in the historic canoe route to the West.

== History ==

As it does to this day, the river played a vital role in life of the Algonquin people, who lived throughout its watershed at contact. The river is called &quot;Kichisìpi&quot;, meaning &quot;Great River&quot; in Anicinàbemowin, the Algonquin language. The Algonquin define themselves in terms of their position on the river, referring to themselves as the Omàmiwinini, &#x27;down-river people&#x27;. Although a majority of the Algonquin First Nation lives in Quebec, the entire Ottawa Valley is Algonquin traditional territory. Present settlement is a result of adaptations made as a result of settler pressures.

Some early European explorers, possibly considering the Ottawa River to be more significant than the Upper St. Lawrence River, applied the name &quot;River Canada&quot; to the Ottawa River and the St. Lawrence River below the confluence at Montreal. As the extent of the Great Lakes became clear and the river began to be regarded as a tributary, it was variously known as the &quot;Grand River&quot;, &quot;Great River&quot; or &quot;Grand River of the Algonquins&quot; before the present name was settled upon. This name change resulted from the Ottawa peoples&#x27; control of the river circa 1685. However, only one band of Ottawa, the Kinouncherpirini or Keinouch, ever inhabited the Ottawa Valley.

In 1615, Samuel de Champlain and Étienne Brûlé, assisted by Algonquin guides, were the first Europeans to travel up the Ottawa River and follow the water route west along the Mattawa and French Rivers to the Great Lakes. See Canadian Canoe Routes (early). For the following two centuries, this route was used by French fur traders, voyageurs and coureurs des bois to Canada&#x27;s interior. The river posed serious hazards to these travellers. The section near Deux Rivières used to have spectacular and wild rapids, namely the &quot;Rapide de la Veillée&quot;, the &quot;Trou&quot;, the &quot;Rapide des Deux Rivières&quot;, and the &quot;Rapide de la Roche Capitaine&quot;. (These rapids are now submerged under the reservoir of Holden Lake.) In 1800, explorer Daniel Harmon reported 14 crosses marking the deaths of voyageurs who had drowned in the dangerous waters along this section of the Ottawa.

The main trading posts along the river were: Lachine, Fort Coulonge, Lac des Allumettes, Mattawa House, where west-bound canoes left the river and Fort Témiscamingue. From Lake Timiskaming a portage led north to the Abitibi River and James Bay.

In the early 19th century, the Ottawa River and its tributaries were used to gain access to large virgin forests of white pine. A booming trade in timber developed, and large rafts of logs were floated down the river. A scattering of small subsistence farming communities developed along the shores of the river to provide manpower for the lumber camps in winter. In 1832, following the War of 1812, the Ottawa River gained strategic importance when the Carillon Canal was completed. Together with the Rideau Canal, the Carillon Canal was constructed to provide an alternate military supply route to Kingston and Lake Ontario, bypassing the route along the Saint Lawrence River.

==Power generation==
A pulp and paper mill (at Témiscaming) and several hydroelectric dams have been constructed on the river. In 1950, the dam at Rapides-des-Joachims was built, forming Holden Lake behind it and thereby submerging the rapids and portages at Deux Rivières. These hydro dams have had negative effects upon shoreline and wetland ecosystems, and are thought to also be responsible for the near extermination of American eels, which were once an abundant species in the river, but which are now uncommon. As an economic route, its importance was eclipsed by railroad and highways in the 20th century. It is no longer used for log driving, however, it is still extensively used for recreational boating. Some 20,000 pleasure boaters visit the Carillon Canal annually.

Today, Outaouais Herald Emeritus at the Canadian Heraldic Authority is named after the river.

=== Hydroelectric installations ===

Hydroelectric installations on the Upper Ottawa (in downstream order):
Lower Ottawa (in downstream order):

* Ontario Power Generation operates generators 2, 3, 4, and 5 with a capacity of 96 MW; and Hydro-Québec operates generators 6, 7, 8, and 9 with a capacity of 89 MW.

==Protected areas==
Numerous non-contiguous areas of the Ottawa River and its shores are protected in a variety of provincial parks, conservation areas, and municipal parks.

In Quebec, there are 3 national parks directly along the Ottawa River (Oka National Park, Plaisance National Park, and Opémican National Park), as well as one major nature reserve through which the river runs (La Vérendrye Wildlife Reserve). Several ZECs (zone d&#x27;exploitation contrôlée) also line the Ottawa River.

Ontario has 7 provincial parks along the banks of the Ottawa River: Voyageur Provincial Park, Fitzroy Provincial Park, Ottawa River Provincial Park, Westmeath Provincial Park, Petawawa Terrace Provincial Park, Driftwood Provincial Park, and Alexander Lake Forest Provincial Park).

===Ottawa River Provincial Park===
The Ottawa River Provincial Park is in the Township of Whitewater Region, Ontario, protecting a series of pristine islands and a small undeveloped section of shoreline along the Ontario side of the Ottawa River. This section of the Ottawa River is known for its whitewater, and is used by a number of commercial rafting companies and many recreational kayakers and canoeists.

The park is a non-operating park, meaning that there are no services and facilities for visitors. The park can be used for backcountry camping, whitewater canoeing, swimming, hunting, and fishing.

Some of the islands included in the park are Big, Butternut, Cedar, Hazelton, and Lorne Islands, in addition to many unnamed islands. They consists of marble bedrock or low-lying alluvial sands and silts. A total of sixteen regionally significant plant species, such as little bluestem (&quot;Andropogon scoparius&quot;), cordgrass (&quot;Spartina pectinata&quot;) and Indiangrass (&quot;Sorghastrum nutans&quot;) have been found in the park, as well as the nationally significant lake cress (&quot;Rorippa aquatica&quot;).

<text>The Yupik (; ) are a group of Indigenous or Aboriginal peoples of western, southwestern, and southcentral Alaska and the Russian Far East. They are related to the Inuit and Iñupiat. Yupik peoples include the following:

* Alutiiq, or Sugpiaq, of the Alaska Peninsula and coastal and island areas of southcentral Alaska.
* Yupʼik or Central Alaskan Yupʼik of the Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta, the Kuskokwim River, and along the northern coast of Bristol Bay as far east as Nushagak Bay and the northern Alaska Peninsula at Naknek River and Egegik Bay in Alaska.
* Siberian Yupik, including Naukan, Chaplino, and—in a linguistic capacity—the Sirenik of the Russian Far East and St. Lawrence Island in western Alaska.

==Population==
The Yupʼik people are by far the most numerous of the various Alaska Native groups. They speak the Central Alaskan Yupʼik language, a member of the Eskaleut family of languages.

As of the 2002 United States Census, the Yupik population in the United States numbered more than 24,000, of whom more than 22,000 lived in Alaska, the vast majority in the seventy or so communities in the traditional Yupʼik territory of western and southwestern Alaska. United States census data for Yupik include 2,355 Sugpiat; there are also 1,700 Yupik living in Russia. According to 2019-based United States Census Bureau data, there are 700 Alaskan Natives in Seattle, many of whom are Inuit and Yupik, and almost 7,000 in the state of Washington.

==Etymology of name==
&quot;Yupʼik&quot; (plural &quot;Yupiit&quot;) comes from the Yupik word &quot;yuk&quot; meaning &quot;person&quot; plus the post-base &quot;-pik&quot; meaning &quot;real&quot; or &quot;genuine&quot;. Thus, it literally means &quot;real people.&quot; The ethnographic literature sometimes refers to the Yupʼik people or their language as &quot;Yuk&quot; or &quot;Yuit&quot;. In the Hooper Bay-Chevak and Nunivak dialects of Yupʼik, both the language and the people are known as &quot;Cupʼik&quot;.

The use of an apostrophe in the name &quot;Yupʼik&quot;, compared to Siberian &quot;Yupik&quot;, exemplifies the Central Alaskan Yupʼik&#x27;s orthography, where &quot;the apostrophe represents gemination [or lengthening] of the ‘pʼ sound&quot;.

The &quot;person/people&quot; (human being) in the Yupik and Inuit languages:

==Origins==
The common ancestors of the Indigenous and Aleut (as well as various Paleo-Siberian groups) are believed by anthropologists to have their origin in eastern Siberia, arriving in the Bering Sea area approximately 10,000 years ago. Research on blood types, supported by later linguistic and DNA findings, suggests that the ancestors of other indigenous peoples of the Americas reached North America before the ancestors of the Indigenous and Aleut. There appear to have been several waves of migration from Siberia to the Americas by way of the Bering land bridge, which became exposed between 20,000 and 8,000 years ago during periods of glaciation. By about 3,000 years ago, the progenitors of the Yupiit had settled along the coastal areas of what would become western Alaska, with migrations up the coastal rivers— notably the Yukon and Kuskokwim— around 1400 AD, eventually reaching as far upriver as Paimiut on the Yukon and Crow Village on the Kuskokwim.

The Siberian Yupik may represent a back-migration of the Indigenous people to Siberia from Alaska.

== Culture ==
Traditionally, families spent the spring and summer at fish camp, then joined others at village sites for the winter. Many families still harvest the traditional subsistence resources, especially Pacific salmon and seal.

The men&#x27;s communal house, the &quot;qasgiq&quot;, was the community center for ceremonies and festivals that included singing, dancing, and storytelling. The qasgiq was used mainly during the winter months because people would travel in family groups following food sources throughout the spring, summer, and fall months. Aside from ceremonies and festivals, the qasgiq was also where the men taught the young boys survival and hunting skills, as well as other life lessons. The young boys were also taught how to make tools and &quot;qayaq&quot; (kayaks) during the winter months in the qasgiq. The ceremonies involve a shaman.

The women&#x27;s house, the &quot;ena&quot;, was traditionally right next door. In some areas, the two communal houses were connected by a tunnel. Women taught the young girls how to tan hides and sew, process and cook game and fish, and weave. Boys would live with their mothers until they were approximately five years old, then they would join the men in the qasgiq.

For a period varying between three and six weeks, the boys and girls would switch cultural educational situations, with the men teaching the girls survival, hunting skills, and toolmaking, and the women teaching the boys the skills they taught to the girls.

In Yupʼik group dances, individuals often remain stationary while moving their upper body and arms rhythmically, their gestures accentuated by handheld dance fans, very similar in design to Cherokee dance fans. The limited motion by no means limits the expressiveness of the dances, which can be gracefully flowing, bursting with energy, or wryly humorous.

The Yupʼik are unique among native peoples of the Americas in that they name children after the most recent person in the community to have died.

The &quot;kuspuk&quot; (&quot;qaspeq&quot;) is a traditional Yupʼik garment worn by both genders. In Alaska, it is worn in both casual and formal settings.

The seal-oil lamp &quot;(naniq)&quot; was an important piece of furniture.

== Languages ==
Five Yupik languages (related to Inuktitut) are still very widely spoken; Yupʼik is the most spoken Native language in Alaska by both population and speakers. This makes Yupʼik the second most spoken indigenous language in the US, after Navajo.

Like the Alaskan Iñupiat, the Alaskan and Siberian Yupik adopted the system of writing developed by Moravian Church missionaries during the 1760s in Greenland. Late 19th-century Moravian missionaries to the Yupik in southwestern Alaska used Yupik in church services and translated the scriptures into the people&#x27;s language.

Russian explorers in the 1800s erroneously identified the Yupik people bordering the territory of the somewhat unrelated Aleut as also Aleut, or &quot;Alutiiq&quot;, in Yupik. By tradition, this term has remained in use, as well as &quot;Sugpiaq&quot;, both of which refer to the Yupik of Southcentral Alaska and Kodiak.

<doc id="73460" wikidata="Q943192" url="?curid=73460" title="Fantasia (1940 film)">
<text>Fantasia is a 1940 American animated musical anthology film produced by Walt Disney Productions, with story direction by Joe Grant and Dick Huemer and production supervision by Walt Disney and Ben Sharpsteen. It consists of eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski, seven of which are performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra. Music critic and composer Deems Taylor acts as the film&#x27;s Master of Ceremonies who introduces each segment in live action.

Disney settled on the film&#x27;s concept in 1938 as work neared completion on &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, originally an elaborate &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; cartoon designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse, who had declined in popularity. As production costs surpassed what the short could earn, Disney decided to include it in a feature-length film of multiple segments set to classical pieces with Stokowski and Taylor as collaborators. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound system developed by Disney and RCA that made &quot;Fantasia&quot; the first commercial film shown in stereo and a precursor to surround sound.

&quot;Fantasia&quot; was first released as a theatrical roadshow that was held in 13 cities across the U.S. between 1940 and 1941 by RKO Radio Pictures; the first began at the Broadway Theatre in New York City on November 13, 1940. While acclaimed by critics, it failed to make a profit owing to World War II&#x27;s cutting off distribution to the European market, the film&#x27;s high production costs, and the expense of building Fantasound equipment and leasing theatres for the roadshow presentations. Since 1942, the film has been reissued multiple times by RKO Radio Pictures and Buena Vista Distribution with its original footage and audio being deleted, modified, or restored in each version. When adjusted for inflation, &quot;Fantasia&quot; is the 23rd highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S.

The &quot;Fantasia&quot; franchise has grown to include video games, Disneyland attractions, and a live concert series. A sequel, &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;, co-produced by Walt&#x27;s nephew Roy E. Disney, was released in 1999. &quot;Fantasia&quot; has grown in reputation over the years and is now widely acclaimed as one of the greatest animated films of all time; in 1998, the American Film Institute ranked it as the 58th greatest American film in their 100 Years...100 Movies and the fifth greatest animated film in their 10 Top 10 list. In 1990, &quot;Fantasia&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

== Plot ==

&quot;Fantasia&quot; opens with live-action scenes of members of an orchestra gathering against a blue background and tuning their instruments in half-light, half-shadow. Master of ceremonies Deems Taylor enters the stage (also in half-light, half-shadow) and introduces the program.
* Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach. Live-action shots of the orchestra illuminated in blue and gold, backed by superimposed shadows, fade into abstract patterns. Animated lines, shapes and cloud formations reflect the sound and rhythms of the music.
* &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot; by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Selections from the 1892 ballet suite underscore scenes depicting the changing of the seasons from summer to autumn to winter. A variety of dances are presented with fairies, fish, flowers, mushrooms, and leaves, including &quot;Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy&quot;, &quot;Chinese Dance&quot;, &quot;Arabian Dance&quot;, &quot;Russian Dance&quot;, &quot;Dance of the Flutes&quot; and &quot;Waltz of the Flowers&quot;.
* &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; by Paul Dukas. Based on Goethe&#x27;s 1797 poem &quot;Der Zauberlehrling&quot;. Mickey Mouse, the young apprentice of the sorcerer Yen Sid, attempts some of his master&#x27;s magic tricks but does not know how to control them.
* &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; by Igor Stravinsky. A visual history of the Earth&#x27;s beginnings is depicted to selected sections of the ballet score. The sequence progresses from the planet&#x27;s formation to the first living creatures, followed by the reign and extinction of the dinosaurs.
* Intermission/&quot;Meet the Soundtrack&quot;: The orchestra musicians depart and the &quot;Fantasia&quot; title card is revealed. After the intermission there is a brief jam session of jazz music led by a clarinettist as the orchestra members return. Then a humorously stylized demonstration of how sound is rendered on film is shown. An animated sound track &quot;character&quot;, initially a straight white line, changes into different shapes and colors based on the sounds played.
* &quot;The Pastoral Symphony&quot; by Ludwig van Beethoven. A mythical Greco–Roman world of colorful centaurs and &quot;centaurettes&quot;, cupids, fauns and other figures from classical mythology is portrayed to Beethoven&#x27;s music. A gathering for a festival to honor Bacchus, the god of wine, is interrupted by Zeus, who creates a storm and directs Vulcan to forge lightning bolts for him to throw at the attendees.
* &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot; by Amilcare Ponchielli. A comic ballet in four sections: Madame Upanova and her ostriches (Morning); Hyacinth Hippo and her servants (Afternoon); Elephanchine and her bubble-blowing elephant troupe (Evening); and Ben Ali Gator and his troop of alligators (Night). The finale finds all of the characters dancing together until their palace collapses.
* &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; by Modest Mussorgsky and &quot;Ave Maria&quot; by Franz Schubert. On Walpurgis Night, the giant devil Chernabog awakes and summons evil spirits and restless souls from their graves to Bald Mountain. The spirits dance and fly through the air until driven back by the sound of an Angelus bell as night fades into dawn. A chorus is heard singing &quot;Ave Maria&quot; as a line of robed monks is depicted walking with lighted torches through a forest and into the ruins of a cathedral.

=== Development ===
====&quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; and expansion to feature film====

In 1936, Walt Disney felt that his cartoon studio&#x27;s star character Mickey Mouse needed a boost in popularity as newcomers Donald Duck and Goofy had become a new favourite amongst audiences. He decided to star Mickey in &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, a deluxe cartoon short based on Goethe&#x27;s poem of the same name and set to the orchestral piece by Paul Dukas also inspired by the original tale. Although Disney had explored the concept of matching animation to classical music since 1928 with his &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; cartoons, he wanted to go beyond the usual slapstick in those shorts and produce ones where &quot;sheer fantasy unfolds&quot;. Upon receiving the rights to use the Dukas piece in July 1937, Disney considered using a well-known conductor to record the music for added prestige. He happened to meet Leopold Stokowski, then the conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, at Chasen&#x27;s restaurant in Hollywood and talked about his plans for the short. An enthusiastic Stokowski informed Disney that he liked the piece and offered to conduct for free.

Disney&#x27;s New York representative met Stokowski on a subsequent train journey, and reported the conductor was serious in his offer and &quot;had some very interesting ideas on instrumental coloring, which would be perfect for an animation medium.&quot; Disney felt &quot;all steamed up over the idea&quot; and thought the partnership &quot;would be the means of a success and should lead to a new style of motion picture presentation.&quot; He had already begun working on a story outline and wished to use &quot;the finest men ... from color ... down to animators&quot; on the new short that was to be promoted as a special and unique film, outside of the Mickey Mouse cartoon series. On December 16, 1937, Stokowski signed a contract with Disney that allowed him to &quot;select and employ a complete symphony orchestra&quot; for the recording of &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, and was paid $5,000 for his services. The three-hour recording session began at midnight on January 9, 1938 at Culver Studios in California, with 85 Hollywood musicians. When production costs surpassed $125,000, as much as four times greater than the average &quot;Silly Symphony&quot;, Disney and his brother Roy, who managed the studio&#x27;s finances, realised that the short could never earn such a sum back on its own. Roy urged his brother to keep additional costs to a minimum &quot;because of its very experimental and unprecedented nature ... we have no idea what can be expected from such a production.&quot; Ben Sharpsteen, a production supervisor on &quot;Fantasia&quot;, recalled that Disney &quot;saw this trouble in the form of an opportunity. This was the birth of a new concept, a group of separate numbers—regardless of their running time—put together in a single presentation. It turned out to be a concert—something novel and of high quality.&quot;

Ideas to expand &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; and produce a full-length feature film began in February 1938, when inquiries were made to extend Stokowski&#x27;s contract with the studio. In August, Disney asked Stokowski to return to the studios to help select musical pieces for the new film, which was initially titled &quot;The Concert Feature&quot;. Disney agreed to pay Stokowski $80,000 plus royalties for his services. The pair further thought of presenting the film with an on-screen host to introduce each number in the program. Both had heard composer and music critic Deems Taylor provide intermission commentary during radio broadcasts of the New York Philharmonic and agreed that he would be most suitable for the role. Disney did contact Taylor about the project and invited him to collaborate with Stokowski and himself, but by then work on &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Bambi&quot;, and development on his new Burbank studio kept him too busy to work on the new feature. In a change of plans, Taylor was asked during a call on September 3, 1938, to come to the studios as soon as possible. He was paid $1,440 per week during his one month visit.

==== Story meetings and program selection ====

The program for &quot;The Concert Feature&quot; was assembled in a series of meetings in September 1938. Disney made story writers Joe Grant and Dick Huemer gather a preliminary selection of music and along with Stokowski, Taylor, and the heads of various departments, discussed their ideas. Each meeting was recorded verbatim by stenographers with participants being given a copy of the entire conversation for review. As selections were considered, a recording of the piece was played back at the next gathering. Disney did not contribute much to early discussions; he admitted that his knowledge of music was instinctive and untrained. In one meeting, he inquired about a piece &quot;on which we might build something of a prehistoric theme ... with animals&quot;. The group was considering &quot;The Firebird&quot; by Igor Stravinsky, but Taylor noted that his &quot;&quot;Le Sacre du printemps&quot; would be something on that order&quot;, to which Disney replied upon hearing a recording, &quot;This is marvelous! It would be perfect for prehistoric animals. There would be something terrific in dinosaurs, flying lizards, and prehistoric monsters. There could be beauty in the settings.&quot;

Numerous choices were discarded as talks continued, including &quot;Moto Perpetuo&quot; by Niccolò Paganini with &quot;shots of dynamos, cogs, pistons&quot; and &quot;whirling wheels&quot; to show the production of a collar button. Other deleted material included &quot;Prelude in G minor&quot; and &quot;Troika&quot; by Sergei Rachmaninoff, and a rendition of &quot;The Song of the Flea&quot; by Mussorgsky, which was to be sung by Lawrence Tibbett. On September 29, 1938, around sixty of Disney&#x27;s artists gathered for a two-and-a-half hour piano concert while he provided a running commentary about the new musical feature. A rough version of &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; was also shown that, according to one attendee, had the crowd applauding and cheering &quot;until their hands were red&quot;. The final pieces were chosen the following morning, which included Toccata and Fugue in D minor, &quot;Cydalise et le Chèvre-pied&quot; by Gabriel Pierné, &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot;, &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;, &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot;, &quot;Clair de Lune&quot; by Claude Debussy, &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; and &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;. Disney had already begun working out the details for the segments, and showed greater enthusiasm and eagerness as opposed to his anxiety while starting on the problematic &quot;Pinocchio&quot;.

&quot;Clair de Lune&quot; was soon removed from the program, and Disney and his writers encountered problems of setting a concrete story to &quot;Cydalise&quot;. Its opening march, &quot;The Entry of the Little Fauns&quot;, attracted Disney to the piece which at first provided suitable depictions of fauns he wanted. On January 5, 1939, following a search for a stronger piece to fit the mythological theme, the piece was replaced with sections of Beethoven&#x27;s sixth symphony. Stokowski disagreed with the switch, believing that Disney&#x27;s &quot;idea of mythology ... is not quite what this symphony is about&quot;. He was also concerned about the reception from classical music enthusiasts who would criticize Disney for venturing too far from the composer&#x27;s intent. Taylor on the other hand welcomed the change, describing it as &quot;a stunning one&quot;, and saw &quot;no possible objection to it&quot;.

The new feature continued to be known as &quot;The Concert Feature&quot; or &quot;Musical Feature&quot; as late as November 1938. Hal Horne, a publicist for Disney&#x27;s film distributor RKO Radio Pictures, wished for a different title, and gave the suggestion &quot;Filmharmonic Concert&quot;. Stuart Buchanan then held a contest at the studio for a title that produced almost 1,800 suggestions, but the favorite among the film&#x27;s supervisors was &quot;Fantasia&quot;, an early working title. Horne said: &quot;It isn&#x27;t the word alone but the meaning we read into it.&quot; From the beginning of its development, Disney expressed the greater importance of music in &quot;Fantasia&quot; compared to his past work: &quot;In our ordinary stuff, our music is always under action, but on this ... we&#x27;re supposed to be picturing this music—not the music fitting our story.&quot; Disney had hoped that the film would bring classical music to people who, like himself, had previously &quot;walked out on this kind of stuff&quot;.

=== Segments ===
More than 1,000 artists and technicians were used in the making of &quot;Fantasia&quot;, which features more than 500 animated characters. Segments were color-keyed scene by scene so the colors in a single shot would harmonize between preceding and following ones. Before a segment&#x27;s narrative pattern was complete, an overall color scheme was designed to the general mood of the music, and patterned to correspond with the development of the subject matter. The studio&#x27;s character model department sculpted three-dimensional clay models so the animators could view their subject from all angles. The live action scenes were filmed using the three-strip Technicolor process, while the animated segments were shot in successive yellow, cyan and magenta-exposed frames. The different pieces of film were then spliced together to form a complete print. A multiplane camera that could handle seven levels, three more than the studio&#x27;s original model, was built specifically for the film. &quot;Fantasia&quot; has of multiplane footage, more than &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and &quot;Pinocchio&quot; combined.

====Toccata and Fugue in D Minor====
Disney had been interested in producing abstract animation since he saw &quot;A Colour Box&quot; by Len Lye from 1935. He explained the work done in the &quot;Toccata and Fugue&quot; was &quot;no sudden idea ... they were something we had nursed along several years but we never had a chance to try.&quot; Preliminary designs included those from effects animator Cy Young, who produced drawings influenced by the patterns on the edge of a piece of sound film. In late 1938, Disney hired Oskar Fischinger, a German artist who had produced numerous abstract animated films, including some with classical music, to work with Young. Upon review of three leica reels produced by the two, Disney rejected all three. According to Huemer all Fishinger &quot;did was little triangles and designs ... it didn&#x27;t come off at all. Too dinky, Walt said.&quot; Fischinger, like Disney, was used to having full control over his work and not used to working in a group. Feeling his designs were too abstract for a mass audience, Fishinger left the studio in apparent despair, before the segment was completed, in October 1939. Disney had plans to make the &quot;Toccata and Fugue&quot; an experimental three-dimensional film, with audiences being given cardboard stereoscopic frames with their souvenir programs, but this idea was abandoned.

====&quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot;====
In &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot;, animator Art Babbitt is said to have credited The Three Stooges as a guide for animating the dancing mushrooms in the &quot;Chinese Dance&quot; routine. He drew with a music score pinned to his desk to work out the choreography so he could relate the action to the melody and the counterpoint, &quot;those nasty little notes underneath ... so something has to be related to that&quot;. The studio filmed professional dancers Joyce Coles and Marjorie Belcher wearing ballet skirts that resembled shapes of blossoms that were to sit above water for &quot;Dance of the Flutes&quot;. An Arabian dancer was also brought in to study the movements for the goldfish in &quot;Arab Dance&quot;. Jules Engel also worked on the choreography and color-keying for this sequence. To avoid hard ink outlines, new techniques like transparent paint was used on the cels. The snowflakes used in the snowflake fairies sequence was difficult to draw by hand, so a man named Leonard Pickley, from the Special Effects Department, came up with the idea of using stop-motion animation. Diagrams of real snowflakes were traced by the Ink and Paint Department, who used a material a little heavier than regular cels, and painted them in translucent white. They were then cut out and placed on revolving spools attached to small steel rails. The mechanics was hidden under black velvet as the snowflakes were moved one frame at a time. The hand-drawn animation was added later.

====&quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;====

Animation on &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; began on January 21, 1938, when James Algar, the director of the segment, assigned animator Preston Blair to work on the scene when Mickey Mouse wakes from his dream. Each of the seven hundred members of staff at the time received a synopsis of Goethe&#x27;s 1797 poem &quot;Der Zauberlehrling&quot;, and were encouraged to complete a twenty-question form that requested their ideas on what action might take place. Early on Disney considered using Dopey from &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; as the apprentice, but he did not want to dilute the impact of his debut feature and chose Mickey Mouse (who was redesigned for the film). Stokowski suggested the cartoon could star &quot;an entirely new personality&quot; that represented &quot;in the mind and heart of everyone seeing the film their own personality, so that they would enter into all the drama and emotional changes of the film in a most intense manner&quot;; Disney rejected this also. In its original form the segment opened with an overture followed by live action shots of Stokowski conducting in silhouette, filming for which took place in January 1938 with cinematographer James Wong Howe.

Layout artist Tom Codrick created what Dick Huemer described as &quot;brilliantly colored thumbnails&quot; from preliminary storyboard sketches using gouache paints, which featured bolder use of color and lighting than any previous Disney short. Mickey was redesigned by animator Fred Moore who added pupils to his eyes for the first time to achieve greater ranges of expression. Most of the segment was shot in live action, including a scene where a UCLA athlete was asked to run and jump across one of the studio&#x27;s sound stages with barrels in the way, which was used for reference when Mickey traverses through water. English silent film actor Nigel De Brulier was hired to portray Yen Sid for the camera for the animators to use for reference. A sorcerer&#x27;s robe and hat was bought from a costume rental shop and decorated with stars and crescent moons.

====&quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;====
An early concept for &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; was to extend the story to the age of mammals and the first humans and the discovery of fire and man&#x27;s triumph. John Hubley, the segment&#x27;s art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans. To gain a better understanding of the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History; English biologist Julian Huxley; paleontologist Barnum Brown; and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. The viewpoint was kept low throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.

====&quot;The Pastoral Symphony&quot;====
According to Ward Kimball, the animators were &quot;extremely specific on touchy issues&quot;. The female centaurs were originally drawn bare-breasted, but the Hays office enforcing the Motion Picture Production Code insisted that they discreetly hung garlands around the necks. The male centaurs were also toned down to appear less intimidating to the audience. Originally, the segment included a pair of black centaurs who tended to the others, but these were cut from the film in later releases due to their implications of racism. (see ).

====&quot;Dance of the Hours&quot;====
&quot;Dance of the Hours&quot; was directed by Norman Ferguson and Thornton Hee and was completed by eleven animators. Most of the story was outlined in a meeting in October 1938, including the creation of the main alligator character, Ben Ali Gator. Its story, direction, layout, and animation underwent several rewrites, yet Disney wanted to present animals perform a legitimate caricature ballet sequence with comedic &quot;slips&quot;. The design of the elephants and alligators were based on those by German illustrator Heinrich Kley, while the hippos and ostriches were based on those by cartoonist T. S. Sullivant. To gain a better idea on the animals&#x27; movements, the crew visited Griffith Park Zoo in Los Angeles. Animator John Hench was assigned to work on the segment, but resisted as he knew little about ballet. Disney then gave Hench season tickets to the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo with backstage access so he could learn more about it.

The studio filmed several people in live action to help with the animation of the characters. The lead ostrich, Madmoiselle Upanova, is based on Irina Baronova. Hyacinth Hippo, the prima ballerina, was inspired by dancers Marge Champion and Tatiana Riabouchinska and actress Hattie Noel who weighed over , the animators studying the &quot;least quiver of her flesh, noticing those parts of her anatomy that were subjected to the greatest stress and strain&quot;. Riabouchinska&#x27;s husband David Lichine was used for Ben Ali Gator&#x27;s movements.

====&quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; and &quot;Ave Maria&quot;====
&quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; was directed by Wilfred Jackson. Its story closely follows the descriptions that Mussorgsky had written on his original score of the tone poem. Chernabog was animated by Vladimir &quot;Bill&quot; Tytla, his design inspired from a pencil sketch by Swiss artist Albert Hurter of a demon sitting atop a mountain unfolding its wings. Despite Hurter never producing animation for Disney, the studio temporarily hired him to produce pencil sketches for the animators to gain inspiration from. Chernabog and parts of the segment were developed further by Danish-born illustrator Kay Nielsen. Tytla conducted research on all the characters he had animated and being Ukrainian, was familiar with the folklore that the story detailed. Actor Béla Lugosi, best known for his role in &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931), was brought in to provide reference poses for Chernabog, but Tytla disliked the results. He then got Jackson to pose shirtless which gave him the images he needed. At one point in its development, the idea of using black cats to represent evil was considered, but Disney rejected it as he thought cats had always been used.

The film&#x27;s program reads that &quot;Ave Maria&quot; provides &quot;an emotional relief to audiences tense from the shock&quot; of &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;. Disney did not want much animated movement, but wanted the segment to bring the background artwork to the forefront which became a showcase for the multiplane camera. An early story outline had the segment end with a Madonna presented on the screen with the clouds, but Disney decided against this as he did not want to suggest overly religious imagery. There were ideas of releasing scents throughout the theater during &quot;Fantasia&quot;, including the smell of incense during &quot;Ave Maria&quot;.

The final shot, beginning with a black foreground and a shining white light in the background, measured of film; according to Disney historian John Culhane, this was likely the longest continuous scene in animation history to date. Ed Gershman, who worked on the segment, described how the animation of the procession figures was so closely drawn, &quot;a difference in the width of a pencil line was more than enough to cause jitters, not only to the animation, but to everyone connected with the sequence.&quot; The jittering created on the first shoot led Disney to order a time-consuming and expensive redo. The studio had no camera that moved slowly and continuously enough to film the segment as Disney wanted, so a custom horizontal camera crane was built that accommodated glass panes wide, with the artwork painted on them, so they could be shifted out of the way as the camera tracked through. Workers shot continuously for six days and nights, but following processing they discovered the camera was fitted with the wrong type of lens and had photographed the track, stands, and themselves. Three days into the third reshoot, a minor earthquake rocked the wooden stands and panels that kept the glass panes in place. Rather than carry on with the risk of jittered footage, they started over for a fourth time and completed one day before the film&#x27;s premiere. The finished film was rushed to New York on a charter plane and spliced into place with four hours to spare.

====Live action====
The live action scenes were the first to be filmed inside Stage 1, a 11,000 sq ft production sound stage built at Disney&#x27;s Burbank studios in 1940. It was subsequently dedicated to the film. The on-screen musicians were not the Philadelphia Orchestra but in fact local players, with Disney sound effects artist Jimmy MacDonald on timpani and composer Paul Smith on violin. Taylor&#x27;s introductions were filmed in August 1940, with Howe returning as cinematographer. Howe adds visual energy with brief flashes of colour projected onto some instruments as the musicians tune up, and changes the hues of the side lighting for each introduction for variety. The jam session during the intermission includes a theme from &quot;The Pastoral Symphony&quot; and &quot;Bach Goes to Town&quot;, a jazz tune popularised by Benny Goodman. David Butler points out the significance of the brief interlude, demonstrating to the audience that &quot;these musicians aren&#x27;t serious all the time&quot; and that jazz is seen as an &quot;antidote to serious music.&quot;

In 1940, Ub Iwerks was re-hired at the Disney studios as a technical supervisor for special visual effects. Among his first assignments was the handshake scene with Mickey Mouse and Stokowski. The scene was produced by filming Stokowski shaking hands in thin air, after which the animators placed drawing paper on top of the photographic print and matched Mickey&#x27;s actions with his. The animation was photographed with the Stokowski film inside the camera to create a single negative that combined both sequences.

=== Soundtrack ===
==== Recording ====
Disney wanted to experiment in more sophisticated sound recording and reproduction techniques for &quot;Fantasia&quot;. He said: &quot;Music emerging from one speaker behind the screen sounds thin, tinkly and strainy. We wanted to reproduce such beautiful masterpieces ... so that audiences would feel as though they were standing at the podium with Stokowski&quot;. &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; was recorded in a three-hour session that began at midnight at the Culver Studios on January 9, 1938. The venue was chosen as the sound stage at the Disney studio at Hyperion Avenue was too small. Stokowski picked the 85 musicians himself, and felt they would be more alert by working at such a late hour. The session involved a single rehearsal. Engineers at Disney collaborated with RCA Corporation that involved recording with multiple audio channels to allow any desired dynamic balance to be achieved upon playback. The stage was altered acoustically with double plywood semi-circular partitions that separated the orchestra into five sections and acted as a baffle wall to increase reverberation. Chief Disney sound engineer William Garity was &quot;very disappointed&quot; with the overall results and was unable to have a full complete rehearsal and record the orchestra in separate sections as scheduled, but Stokowski insisted the recording was satisfactory.
On January 18, 1939, Stokowski signed an eighteen-month contract with Disney to conduct the remaining pieces with the Philadelphia Orchestra. The main recording sessions took place on April 6, 8, and 12, each three hours in length, at the Academy of Music, the orchestra&#x27;s home which was chosen for its favourable acoustics. The 90-piece orchestra included some students at the Curtis Institute of Music, and each musician was paid a flat fee of $10 per hour with principal players receiving as much as $400. &quot;Ave Maria&quot; features the Westminster Choir College under the supervision of Charles E. Henderson, and college affiliate Julietta Novis as the soprano solo. Disney commissioned American author Rachel Field to produce a set of original lyrics in English specifically for &quot;Fantasia&quot;, of which just one verse is sung in the film. The two sound effects heard in the film are used in &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot;—a thump when an ostrich ballerina falls to the ground and the crash of the palace doors at the very end. Disney paid almost $18,000 towards the musician&#x27;s wages, stage personnel, a music librarian, and the orchestra&#x27;s manager.

Disney and RCA decided to abandon the multi-channel setup used on &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; and devised a more sophisticated one for the Academy sessions. Thirty-three microphones were placed around the orchestra that captured the music onto eight optical sound recording machines placed in the hall&#x27;s basement, where engineers followed the music in real time and muted microphones when their assigned section was not playing. Each one represented an audio channel that focused on a different section of instruments: cellos and basses, violins, brass, violas, and woodwinds and tympani. The seventh channel was a combination of the first six while the eighth provided an overall sound of the orchestra at a distance. A ninth channel provided a click track function for the animators to time their drawings to the music. The film stock had to be stored in a truck parked outside the Academy as the highly flammable material posed a fire risk for the wooden basement. When the finished recordings arrived at the studio, a meeting was held on July 14, 1939, to allow the artists working on each segment to listen to Stokowski&#x27;s arrangements, and suggest alterations in the sound to work more effectively with their designs. Some solo parts were subsequently re-recorded in California, but still under Stokowski&#x27;s direction. In the 42 days it took to record, edit, and produce the final mix of film was used in the process.

==== Fantasound ====

The Disney brothers contacted David Sarnoff of RCA regarding the manufacture of a new system that would &quot;create the illusion that the actual symphony orchestra is playing in the theater.&quot; Sarnoff backed out at first for financial reasons, but agreed in July 1939 to make the equipment so long as the Disneys could hold down the estimated $200,000 in costs (equivalent to about $million in ). Though it was not exactly known how to achieve their goal, engineers at Disney and RCA investigated many ideas and tests made with various equipment setups. The collaboration led to the development of Fantasound, a pioneering stereophonic surround sound system which innovated some processes widely used today, including simultaneous multitrack recording, overdubbing, and noise reduction.

Fantasound, developed in part by Garity, employed two projectors running at the same time. With one containing the picture film with a mono soundtrack for backup purposes, the other ran a sound film that was mixed from the nine tracks recorded at the Academy to four: three of which contained the audio for the left, center, and right stage speakers respectively, while the fourth became a control track with amplitude and frequency tones that drove variable-gain amplifiers to control the volume of the three audio tracks. In addition were three &quot;house&quot; speakers placed on the left, right, and center of the auditorium that derived from the left and right stage channels which acted as surround channels. As the original recording was captured at almost peak modulation to increase signal-to-noise ratio, the control track was used to restore the dynamics to where Stokowski thought they should be. For this, a tone-operated gain-adjusting device was built to control the levels of each of the three audio tracks through the amplifiers.

The illusion of sound traveling across the speakers was achieved with a device named the &quot;pan pot&quot;, which directed the predetermined movement of each audio channel with the control track. Mixing of the soundtrack required six people to operate the various pan pots in real time, while Stokowski directed each level and pan change which was marked on his musical score. To monitor recording levels, Disney used oscilloscopes with color differentiation to minimize eye fatigue. To test recording equipment and speaker systems, Disney ordered eight electronic oscillators from the newly established Hewlett-Packard company. Between the individual takes, prints, and remakes, approximately three million feet of sound film was used in the production of &quot;Fantasia&quot;. Almost a fifth of the film&#x27;s budget was spent on its recording techniques.

=== Theatrical runs ===

==== 1940–1941 roadshows with Fantasound ====

RKO balked at the idea of distributing &quot;Fantasia&quot;, which it described as a &quot;longhair musical&quot;, and believed its duration of two hours and five minutes plus intermission was too long for a general release. It relaxed its exclusive distribution contract with Disney, who wanted a more prestigious exhibit in the form of a limited-run roadshow attraction. A total of thirteen roadshows were held across the United States; each involving two daily screenings with seat reservations booked in advance at higher prices and a fifteen-minute intermission. Disney hired film salesman Irving Ludwig to manage the first eleven engagements, who was given specific instructions regarding each aspect of the film&#x27;s presentation, including the setup of outside theater marquees and curtain and lighting cues. Patrons were taken to their seats by staff hired and trained by Disney, and were given a program booklet illustrated by Gyo Fujikawa.

The first roadshow opened at the Broadway Theatre in New York City on November 13, 1940. The Disneys had secured a year&#x27;s lease with the venue that was fully equipped with Fantasound, which took personnel a week working around the clock to install. Proceeds made on the night went to the British War Relief Society following the Battle of Britain. Ticket demand was so great that eight telephone operators were employed to handle the extra calls while the adjoining store was rented out to cater the box office bookings. &quot;Fantasia&quot; ran at the Broadway for forty-nine consecutive weeks, the longest run achieved by a film at the time. Its run continued for a total of fifty-seven weeks until February 28, 1942.

The remaining twelve roadshows were held throughout 1941, which included a 39-week run at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles from January 29. &quot;Fantasia&quot; broke the long-run record at the venue in its twenty-eighth week; a record previously held by &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Its eight-week run at the Fulton Theatre in Pittsburgh attracted over 50,000 people with reservations being made from cities located one hundred miles from the venue. Engagements were also held at the Geary Theatre in San Francisco for eight months, the Hanna Theatre in Cleveland for nine weeks, the Majestic Theatre in Boston, the Apollo Theater in Chicago, and also in Philadelphia, Detroit, Buffalo, Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.

&quot;Fantasia&quot; grossed over $300,000 in the first sixteen weeks in New York; over $20,000 in the opening five weeks in San Francisco; and almost the same amount in the first ten weeks both in Los Angeles and Boston. The first eleven roadshows earned a total of $1.3 million by April 1941, but the $85,000 in production and installation costs of a single Fantasound setup, along with theatres having to be leased, forced Disney to exceed their loan limits. The onset of the Second World War prevented plans for a potential release in Europe, normally the source of as much as forty-five per cent of the studio&#x27;s income. Up to eighty-eight engagements were outlined across five years, but wartime demands for material limited the number of Fantasound prints to sixteen. All but one of the Fantasound setups were dismantled and given to the war effort. Upon acquiring the film&#x27;s distribution rights in April 1941, RKO initially continued the roadshow booking policy but presented the film in mono, which was easier to exhibit. The combined average receipts from each roadshow was around $325,000, which placed &quot;Fantasia&quot; at an even greater loss than &quot;Pinocchio&quot;.

==== 1942–1963 runs ====
Disney allowed RKO to handle the general release of &quot;Fantasia&quot;, but fought their decision to have the film cut. He gave in as the studio needed as much income as possible to remedy its finances, but refused to cut it himself, &quot;You can get anybody you want to edit it ... I can&#x27;t do it.&quot; With no input from Disney, musical director Ed Plumb and Ben Sharpsteen reduced &quot;Fantasia&quot; to one hour and forty minutes at first, then to one hour and twenty minutes by removing most of Taylor&#x27;s commentary and the &quot;Toccata and Fugue&quot;. &quot;Fantasia&quot; was re-released in January 1942 at more popular prices with a mono soundtrack, and was placed on the lower half of double bills with the Western film &quot;Valley of the Sun&quot;.

RKO reissued &quot;Fantasia&quot; once more on September 1, 1946, with the animated sequences complete and the scenes of Taylor, Stokowski, and the orchestra restored but shortened. Its running time was restored to one hour and fifty-five minutes. This edit would be the standard form for subsequent re-releases, and was the basis for the 1990 restoration.

By 1955, the original sound negatives began to deteriorate, though a four-track copy had survived in good condition. Using the remaining Fantasound system at the studio, a three-track stereo copy was transferred across noise-free telephone wires onto magnetic film at an RCA facility in Hollywood. This copy was used when &quot;Fantasia&quot; was reissued in stereo by Buena Vista Distribution in SuperScope, a derivative of the anamorphic widescreen CinemaScope format, on February 7, 1956. The projector featured an automatic control mechanism designed by Disney engineers that was coupled to a variable anamorphic lens, which allowed the picture to switch between its Academy standard aspect ratio of 1.33:1 to the wide ratio of 2.35:1 in twenty seconds without a break in the film. This was achieved by placing the cues that controlled the mechanism on a separate track in addition to the three audio channels. Only selected parts of the animation were stretched, while all live action scenes remained unchanged. This reissue garnered some criticism from viewers, as the widescreen format led to the cropping and reframing of the images.

On February 20, 1963, &quot;Fantasia&quot; was re-released in both standard and SuperScope versions with stereo sound, though existing records are unclear. Its running time was 56 seconds longer than the previous issue which is unexplained. This was the final release that occurred before Disney&#x27;s (and Taylor&#x27;s) death in 1966.

==== 1969–1990 runs ====
&quot;Fantasia&quot; began to make a profit from its $2.28 million budget after its return to theaters on December 17, 1969. The film was promoted with a psychedelic-styled advertising campaign, and it became popular among teenagers and college students who reportedly appreciated it as a psychedelic experience. Animator Ollie Johnston recalled that young people &quot;thought we were on a trip when we made it ... every time we&#x27;d go to talk to a school or something, they&#x27;d ask us what we were on.&quot; The release is also noted for the removal of four scenes from &quot;The Pastoral Symphony&quot; over racial stereotyping. &quot;Fantasia&quot; was issued on a regular basis, typically for exhibition in art houses in college towns, until the mid-1970s.

The film was reissued nationwide once more on April 15, 1977 (the same year as Stokowski&#x27;s death), this time with simulated stereo sound. This edit featured the RKO distribution logo being replaced with that of Buena Vista Distribution, since RKO had not been part of a release since 1946. It had not been removed earlier as the credit sequence would have required to be re-shot. A two-and-a-half-minute reduction in the film&#x27;s running time in this version remains unclear in existing records.

In 1980, the studio shipped a damaged segment of &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot; to various film restoration companies; each advised that the sound recording could not be upgraded to a quality suitable for theatre screenings. In late 1981, Disney executives decided to replace the Stokowski soundtrack with a new, digital recording in Dolby Stereo with conductor Irwin Kostal; president and CEO Ron W. Miller said that the original had degraded and &quot;no longer matched the extraordinary visuals.&quot; Kostal directed a hand-picked 121-piece orchestra and 50-voice choir for the recording that took place across 18, three-hour sessions in January 1982 at CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles, costing almost $1.4 million to produce. Five musicians who took part in the 1940 recording performed on the new one. Kostal had the difficult task of pacing his conducting to match Stokowski&#x27;s, but chose Mussorgsky&#x27;s orchestration of &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; instead of the arrangement Stokowski had used which was based on Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s version. The new recording also corrected a two-frame lag in projection caused by the recording techniques used at the time the film was made. The Kostal soundtrack was prepared for the film&#x27;s reissue from April 2, 1982, which had Taylor&#x27;s scenes replaced with briefer voiceover narration from Hugh Douglas as the studio felt audiences by now had become &quot;more sophisticated and knowledgeable about music.&quot; Mickey Mouse and Stokowski&#x27;s voices in the handshake scene were also redubbed, the former by Wayne Allwine, who would do so again in &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;″s version of the same scene.

The 1982 version was reissued from February 1985, which kicked off with a run at the Plitt Century Plaza Theatre in Los Angeles that was fitted with the HPS-4000 digital speaker system. This allowed the digital stereo recording of the Kostal soundtrack to be presented for the first time, and made &quot;Fantasia&quot; the first theatrical feature film presented in digital stereo sound. The standard recording was used for the film&#x27;s wide release to around 400 theaters. This time, actor Tim Matheson provided the narration.

For its fiftieth anniversary reissue, &quot;Fantasia&quot; underwent a two-year restoration process that began with a six-month search to locate the original negatives, which had been in storage since 1946, and piece them together. This was the first time since then that a print of the film had been prepared using the original negative and not a copy. A new print was formed that was identical to the 1946 version with Taylor&#x27;s introductions restored but with a new end credits sequence added. As the original opening shots of &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; could not be found, footage from the Disney educational film &quot;A World is Born&quot;, which used footage from the segment, was used instead. This was also the case for a sequence in &quot;The Pastoral Symphony&quot;, so a duplicate was used. Each of the 535,680 frames were restored by hand with an untouched print from 1951 used for guidance on the correct colors and tone. Theaters that agreed to screen the film were required to install specific stereo sound equipment and present it in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The 1990 reissue also had the Stokowski soundtrack restored, which underwent digital remastering by Terry Porter who worked with the 1955 magnetic soundtrack. He estimated 3,000 pops and hisses were removed from the recording. Released on October 5, 1990, the reissue grossed $25 million domestically.

==== Audio ====
Disney considered releasing the film&#x27;s soundtrack around the time of the film&#x27;s roadshow release, but this idea was not realized. The soundtrack was first released as a mono three LP set in sixteen countries by Disneyland and Buena Vista Records in 1957, containing the musical pieces without the narration. A stereo edition LP was issued by Buena Vista Records in 1961. Disney was required to obtain permission from Stokowski, who initially rejected its sale unless the Philadelphia Orchestra Association received a share of the royalties.

The Kostal recording was released on two CDs, two LPs and two audio cassettes by Buena Vista Records, in 1982.

In September 1990, the remastered Stokowski soundtrack was released on CD and audio cassette by Buena Vista Records., and was later re-released in 2006. In the United States, it debuted the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number 190, its peak position, for the week of November 17, 1990. Two months after its release, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for 500,000 copies sold in the United States. In January 1993, it was certified platinum for sales in excess of one million copies.

For the film&#x27;s 75th anniversary in 2015, the Stokowski and Kostal recordings were released by Walt Disney Records on a four-disc album as the fifth volume of &quot;The Legacy Collection&quot;. The set includes Stokowski&#x27;s recording of the deleted &quot;Clair de Lune&quot; segment, and a recording of &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; and &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; (from &quot;Make Mine Music&quot;) with added narration by Sterling Holloway; he himself narrated the latter originally.

==== Video ====
&quot;Fantasia&quot; has received four home video releases. The first, featuring the 1990 restored theatrical version, was released on VHS, Betamax and LaserDisc on November 1, 1991, as part of the Walt Disney Classics line. The original soundtrack returned when Fantasound was also recreated in Dolby Stereo for the film&#x27;s 1990 theatrical release. The result, named &quot;Fantasound 90,&quot; was used as a basis of the audio for these releases. The release was limited to just 50 days, prompting 9.25 million advance orders for cassettes and a record 200,000 for discs, doubling the figure of the previous record. The &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; package included the film, a &quot;making of&quot; feature, a commemorative lithograph, a 16-page booklet, a two-disc soundtrack of the Stokowski score, and a certificate of authenticity signed by Roy E. Disney, the nephew of Walt. In 1992, &quot;Fantasia&quot; became the biggest-selling sell-through cassette of all time in the US with 14.2 million copies being purchased. The record was surpassed later that year by &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. It was also the UK&#x27;s top selling video at the time, with sales of 3 million. By October 1994, 21.7 million copies of the video had been sold worldwide.

In November 2000, &quot;Fantasia&quot; was released on video for the second time, this time along with &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;, on DVD with 5.1 surround sound. The films were issued both separately and in a three-disc set called &quot;The Fantasia Anthology&quot;. A variety of bonus features were included in the bonus disc, &quot;The Fantasia Legacy&quot;. This edition attempted to follow as closely as possible the runtime and format of the original roadshow version, and included additional restored live action footage of Taylor and the orchestra, including the bookends to the film&#x27;s intermission. In addition to these changes, this DVD release would be THX certified. Since the 2000 release, Taylor&#x27;s voice was re-recorded throughout by Corey Burton because most of the audio tracks to Taylor&#x27;s restored scenes had deteriorated to the point that they could no longer be used. Oddly, the UK DVD still uses the 1990 theatrical version for its video content, albeit with the new audio restoration from the US version.

Both films were reissued again by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in November 2010 separately, as a two-disc DVD/Blu-ray set and a combined DVD and Blu-ray four-disc set (named the &quot;Fantasia 2 Movie Collection&quot;) that featured 1080p high-definition video and 7.1 surround sound. The 2010 version of &quot;Fantasia&quot; featured a new restoration by Reliance MediaWorks and a new sound restoration, but was editorially identical to the 2000 version. This also marked the first time in Europe, where it was originally denied a release due to the war, that the roadshow version was released. &quot;Fantasia&quot; was withdrawn from release and returned to the &quot;Disney Vault&quot; moratorium on April 30, 2011.

In 2021, both films, along with the 2018 compilation &quot;Celebrating Mickey&quot;, a collection of 13 Mickey Mouse shorts, were reissued on DVD, Blu-ray, and digitally as part of the U.S. Disney Movie Club exclusive &quot;The Best of Mickey Collection&quot;. They were also released for the first time on multiple U.S. purchased streaming platforms, including Movies Anywhere and its retailers.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
==== Early reviews ====

&quot;Fantasia&quot; garnered significant critical acclaim at the time of release and was seen by some critics as a masterpiece. The West Coast premiere at the Carthay Circle Theatre was a grand affair, attracting some 5000 people, including Shirley Temple, Cecil B. DeMille, Forrest Tucker, James Cagney, Robert Montgomery, James Murphy, Edgar Bergen, and many other notables in the film industry. Among those at the film&#x27;s premiere was film critic Edwin Schallert of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; who considered the film to be a magnificent achievement in film which would go down in cinematic history as a landmark film, noting the rapturous applause the film received by the audience during the various interludes. He stated that &quot;Fantasia&quot; was &quot;caviar to the general, ambrosia and nectar for the intelligentsia&quot; and considered the film to be &quot;courageous beyond belief&quot;. Isabel Morse Jones, the newspaper&#x27;s music critic, had high praise for the soundtrack to the film, describing it as a &quot;dream of a symphony concert&quot;, and an &quot;enormously varied concert of pictorial ideas, of abstract music by acknowledged composers, of performers Leopold Stokowski and orchestra players of Hollywood and Philadelphia, and, for the vast majority, new and wonderful sound effects&quot;. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, also at the premiere, noted that &quot;motion-picture history was made last night ... &quot;Fantasia&quot; dumps conventional formulas overboard and reveals the scope of films for imaginative excursion ... &quot;Fantasia&quot; ... is simply terrific.&quot; Peyton Boswell, an editor at &quot;Art Digest&quot;, called it &quot;an aesthetic experience never to be forgotten&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine described the premiere as &quot;stranger and more wonderful than any of Hollywood&#x27;s&quot; and the experience of Fantasound &quot;as if the hearer were in the midst of the music. As the music sweeps to a climax, it froths over the proscenium arch, boils into the rear of the theatre, all but prances up and down the aisles.&quot; &quot;Dance Magazine&quot; devoted its lead story to the film, saying that &quot;the most extraordinary thing about &quot;Fantasia&quot; is, to a dancer or balletomane, not the miraculous musical recording, the range of color, or the fountainous integrity of the Disney collaborators, but quite simply the perfection of its dancing&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; also hailed &quot;Fantasia&quot;, calling it &quot;a successful experiment to lift the relationship from the plane of popular, mass entertainment to the higher strata of appeal to lovers of classical music&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; assigned three writers to cover the film&#x27;s Chicago premiere: society columnist Harriet Pribble; film critic Mae Tinee; and music critic Edward Barry. Pribble left amazed at the &quot;brilliantly-attired audience&quot;, while Tinee felt the film was &quot;beautiful ... but it is also bewildering. It is stupendous. It is colossal. It is an overwhelmingly ambitious orgy of color, sound, and imagination.&quot; Barry was pleased with the &quot;program of good music well performed ... and beautifully recorded&quot; and felt &quot;pleasantly distracted&quot; from the music to what was shown on the screen. In a breakdown of reviews from both film and music critics, Disney author Paul Anderson found 33% to be &quot;very positive&quot;, 22% both &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;positive and negative&quot;, and 11% negative.

Those who adopted a more negative view at the time of the film&#x27;s release came mostly from the classical music community. Many found fault with Stokowski&#x27;s rearrangements and abridgements of the music. Igor Stravinsky, the only living composer whose music was featured in the film, expressed displeasure at how in Stokowski&#x27;s arrangement of &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, &quot;the order of the pieces had been shuffled, and the most difficult of them eliminated&quot;, and criticized the orchestra&#x27;s performance, observing that the simplification of the score &quot;did not save the musical performance, which was execrable&quot;. Other composers and music critics leveled criticism at the premise of the film itself, arguing that presenting classical music with visual images would rob the musical pieces of their integrity. Composer and music critic Virgil Thomson praised Fantasound which he thought offered &quot;good transmission of music&quot;, but disliked the &quot;musical taste&quot; of Stokowski, with exception to &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; and &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;. Olin Downes of &quot;The New York Times&quot; too hailed the quality of sound that Fantasound presented, but said, &quot;much of &quot;Fantasia&quot; distracted from or directly injured the scores&quot;. Film critic Pauline Kael dismissed parts of &quot;Fantasia&quot; as &quot;grotesquely kitschy&quot;. Some parents resisted paying the higher roadshow prices for their children, and several complained that the &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; segment had frightened them. There were also a few negative reactions that were more political in nature, especially since the film&#x27;s release happened at a time when Nazi Germany reigned supreme in Europe. One review of the film in this manner, written by Dorothy Thompson for &quot;The New York Herald Tribune&quot; on November 25, 1940, was especially harsh. Thompson claimed that she &quot;left the theater in a condition bordering on nervous breakdown&quot;, because the film was a &quot;remarkable nightmare&quot;. Thompson went on to compare the film to rampant Nazism, which she described as &quot;the abuse of power&quot; and &quot;the perverted betrayal of the best instincts&quot;. Thompson also claimed that the film depicted nature as being &quot;titanic&quot; while man was only &quot;a moving lichen on the stone of time&quot;. She concluded that the film was &quot;cruel&quot;, &quot;brutal and brutalizing&quot;, and a negative &quot;caricature of the Decline of the West&quot;. In fact, Thompson claimed that she was so distraught by the film that she even walked out of it before she saw the two last segments, &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; and &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, because she did not want to be subject to any more of the film&#x27;s &quot;brutalization&quot;.

==== Later reviews ====
 &quot;TV Guide&quot; awarded the film four stars, calling it &quot;the most ambitious animated feature ever to come out of the Disney studios&quot;, noting how the film &quot;integrates famous works of classical music with wildly uneven but extraordinarily imaginative visuals that run the gamut from dancing hippos to the purely abstract&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; rated the film four stars out of four, and noted that throughout &quot;Fantasia&quot;, &quot;Disney pushes the edges of the envelope&quot;. However, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine only rated it 2 stars out of 5 (poor), concluding &quot;this is a very patchy affair – while some of the animated pieces work, others come across as downright insane&quot;. Remarks have also been made about &quot;Fantasia&quot; not being a children&#x27;s film. Religion writer Mark I. Pinsky considers &quot;Fantasia&quot; to be one of the more problematic of Disney&#x27;s animated features in that it was intended as much as for adults as children and not what people had come to expect.

=== Awards and honors ===
&quot;Fantasia&quot; was ranked fifth at the 1940 National Board of Review Awards in the Top Ten Films category. Disney and Stokowski won a Special Award for the film at the 1940 New York Film Critics Circle Awards. &quot;Fantasia&quot; was the subject of two Academy Honorary Awards on February 26, 1942—one for Disney, William Garity, John N. A. Hawkins, and the RCA Manufacturing Company for their &quot;outstanding contribution to the advancement of the use of sound in motion pictures through the production of &quot;Fantasia&quot;&quot;, and the other to Stokowski &quot;and his associates for their unique achievement in the creation of a new form of visualized music in Walt Disney&#x27;s production &quot;Fantasia&quot;, thereby widening the scope of the motion picture as entertainment and as an art form&quot;.

In 1990, &quot;Fantasia&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. On the 100th anniversary of cinema in 1995, the Vatican included &quot;Fantasia&quot; in its list of 45 &quot;great films&quot; made under the Art category (the other categories being Religion and Values). &quot;Fantasia&quot; is featured in three lists that rank the greatest American films as determined by the American Film Institute. The film ranked number 58 in 100 Years... 100 Movies in 1998, before it was dropped from its ranking in the 10th Anniversary revision in 2007, though it was nominated for inclusion. The 10 Top 10 list formed in 2008 placed &quot;Fantasia&quot; fifth under Animation.

=== Controversies ===
In April 1939, Philadelphia advertising agent Mark S. Tutelman filed an injunction suit in an attempt to prevent the film being made. Tutelman claimed the film originated from an idea of synchronizing animation with classical music which he first described to Stokowski in 1937, had prepared scenarios and orchestral arrangements at Stokowski&#x27;s request without acknowledgement or credit, and demanded a cut of the film&#x27;s proceeds. In April 1940, Tutelman&#x27;s case was dismissed. In 1942, Tutelman filed a $25,000 damage suit against Stokowski, charging the conductor of a misappropriation of ideas without credit.

In April 1942, the Irish Film Censor insisted the film cut Taylor&#x27;s scientific introduction to &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; due to its &quot;materialistic portrayal of the origins of life&quot;.

In the 1960s, four shots from &quot;The Pastoral Symphony&quot; were removed that depicted two characters in a racially stereotyped manner. A black centaurette called Sunflower was depicted polishing the hooves of a white centaurette, and a second named Otika appeared briefly during the procession scenes with Bacchus and his followers. The characters were initially removed for a 1963 re-run of the &quot;Disneyland&quot; episode &quot;Magic and Music&quot;, which originally aired uncut in 1958. Disney himself approved of the changes. The episode aired uncut on television once again in 1966, before the edits were incorporated into the film&#x27;s 1969 theatrical reissue and has remained on all releases since. John Carnochan, the editor of the 1991 video release, said: &quot;It&#x27;s sort of appalling to me that these stereotypes were ever put in&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert commented on the edit: &quot;While the original film should, of course, be preserved for historical purposes, there is no need for the general release version to perpetrate racist stereotypes in a film designed primarily for children.&quot;

In May 1992, the Philadelphia Orchestra Association filed a lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company and Buena Vista Home Video. The orchestra maintained that as a co-creator of &quot;Fantasia&quot;, the group was entitled to half of the estimated $120 million in profits from video and laser disc sales. The orchestra dropped its case in 1994 when the two parties reached an undisclosed settlement out of court. British music publisher Boosey &amp; Hawkes filed a further lawsuit in 1993, contending that Disney did not have the rights to distribute &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; in the 1991 video releases because the permission granted to Disney by Stravinsky in 1940 was only in the context of a film to be shown in theaters. A federal district court backed Boosey &amp; Hawkes&#x27;s case in 1996, but the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling in 1998, stating that Disney&#x27;s original &quot;license for motion picture rights extends to video format distribution&quot;.

== Additional material ==
Disney had wanted &quot;Fantasia&quot; to be an ongoing project, with a new edition being released every few years. His plan was to replace one of the original segments with a new one as it was completed, so audiences would always see a new version of the film. From January to August 1941, story material was developed based on additional musical works, including &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; by Richard Wagner, &quot;The Swan of Tuonela&quot; by Jean Sibelius, &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot; by Carl Maria von Weber, the Polka and Fugue from &quot;Schwanda the Bagpiper&quot; by Jaromír Weinberger, a &quot;baby ballet&quot; set to &quot;Berceuse&quot; by Frédéric Chopin and a &quot;bug ballet&quot; set to &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot; by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, which was later adapted into the &quot;Bumble Boogie&quot; segment in &quot;Melody Time&quot; (1948). The film&#x27;s disappointing initial box office performance and the USA&#x27;s entry into World War II brought an end to these plans. Deems Taylor prepared introductions for &quot;The Firebird&quot; by Stravinsky, &quot;La Mer&quot; by Claude Debussy, &quot;Adventures in a Perambulator&quot; by John Alden Carpenter, &quot;Don Quixote&quot; by Richard Strauss, and &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; by Mussorgsky &quot;to have them for the future in case we decided to make any one of them&quot;.

Another segment, Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Clair de lune&quot;, was developed as part of the film&#x27;s original program. After being completely animated, it was cut out of the final film to shorten its lengthy running time. The animation depicted two Great white herons flying through the Florida Everglades on a moonlit night, with more focus towards the segment&#x27;s background art than story and animation. The sequence was later edited and re-scored for the &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; segment in &quot;Make Mine Music&quot; (1946). In 1992, a workprint of the original was discovered and &quot;Clair de Lune&quot; was restored, complete with the original soundtrack of Stokowski with the Philadelphia Orchestra. It was included as a bonus feature in &quot;The Fantasia Anthology&quot; DVD in 2000.

&quot;Destino&quot;, a collaboration between Walt Disney and surrealist artist Salvador Dalí, was also considered for inclusion as a future &quot;Fantasia&quot; segment, but was shelved until it was re-discovered during production of &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;. In her host sequence for &quot;The Steadfast Tin Soldier&quot; in that film, Bette Midler mentions several cancelled sequences, specifically &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot;, &quot;Destino&quot;, &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot;, &quot;Berceuse&quot; and the Polka and Fugue.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Fantasia&quot; will enter the American public domain on January 1, 2036.

=== Sequel ===
In 1980, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Wolfgang Reitherman and Mel Shaw had begun work on &quot;Musicana&quot;, &quot;an ambitious concept mixing jazz, classical music, myths, modern art and more, following the old &quot;Fantasia&quot; format&quot;. Animation historian Charles Solomon wrote that development took place between 1982 and 1983, which combined &quot;ethnic tales from around the world with the music of the various countries&quot;. Proposed segments for the film included a battle between an ice god and a sun goddess set to &quot;Finlandia&quot; by Sibelius, one set in the Andes to the songs of Yma Sumac, another featuring caricatures of Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald and an adaptation of The Emperor&#x27;s Nightingale which would have featured Mickey as the nightingale&#x27;s owner, similar to his role in &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;. The project was shelved in favor of &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, though the artwork made for The Emperor&#x27;s Nightingale would later be used for a book adaptation by Teddy Slater in 1992.

Roy E. Disney, the nephew of Walt, co-produced &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; which entered production in 1990 and features seven new segments performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra with conductor James Levine. &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; is the only segment retained from the original film. &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; premiered at Carnegie Hall on December 17, 1999, as part of a five-city live concert tour, followed by a four-month engagement in IMAX cinemas and a wide release in regular theatres, in 2000.

Early development for a third film began in 2002, with a working title of &quot;Fantasia 2006&quot;. The proposed segments included &quot;The Little Matchgirl&quot; by Roger Allers, &quot;One by One&quot; by Pixote Hunt, &quot;Lorenzo&quot; by Mike Gabriel, and &quot;Destino&quot; by Dominique Monféry. The project was shelved in 2004, with the proposed segments released as individual short films.

===Live-action adaptations===
* &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; segment was adapted by Jerry Bruckheimer into the feature-length movie, &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (2010).
* &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot; segment serves as a partial inspiration for the feature-length movie, &quot;The Nutcracker and the Four Realms&quot; (2018), which itself contains several references to &quot;Fantasia&quot;.
* The &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; segment was reported in 2015 as being in development by Disney Productions for a feature-length live-action film with a treatment written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. In 2021, it was reported that the project had been scrapped.

=== Parodies and spin-offs ===
&quot;Fantasia&quot; is parodied in &quot;A Corny Concerto&quot;, a Warner Bros. cartoon from 1943 of the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series directed by Bob Clampett. The short features Elmer Fudd in the role of Taylor, wearing his styled glasses, who introduces two segments set to pieces by Johann Strauss (&quot;Tales from the Vienna Woods&quot; and the &quot;Blue Danube Waltz&quot;, the former featuring Porky and Bugs and the latter featuring Daffy). In 1976, Italian animator Bruno Bozzetto produced &quot;Allegro Non Troppo&quot;, a feature-length parody of &quot;Fantasia&quot;.

The animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; references &quot;Fantasia&quot; in a few episodes. Matt Groening, the creator of the series, expressed a wish to make a parody film named &quot;Simpstasia&quot;; it was never produced, partly because it would have been too difficult to write a feature-length script. In &quot;Treehouse of Horror IV&quot;, director David Silverman had admired the animation in &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;, and made the first appearance of Devil Flanders resemble Chernabog. The episode &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land&quot; references &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; in a snippet titled &quot;Scratchtasia&quot;, which features the music and several shots parodying it exactly.

In 2014, BBC Music created a music education scheme similar to &quot;Fantasia&quot; called &quot;Ten Pieces&quot;, intended to introduce children to classical music. Spanning two films (in 2014 and 2015), several pieces featured in the &quot;Fantasia&quot; films are also included.

The 2018 film &quot;Teen Titans Go! To the Movies&quot; references &quot;Fantasia&quot; during the musical sequence &quot;My Superhero Movie&quot;.

=== Theme parks ===
From 2001 to 2015, the Sorcerer&#x27;s Hat was the icon of Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, one of the four theme parks located at Walt Disney World Resort. The structure was of the magic hat from &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;. Also located at the resort is Fantasia Gardens, a miniature golf course that integrates characters and objects from the film in each hole. The fireworks and water show &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; features scenes from &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; and other &quot;Fantasia&quot; segments on water projection screens, and involves the plot of Mickey as the apprentice doing magic whilst also battling the Disney Villains.

For the 20th anniversary of Disneyland Paris, Mickey was depicted in a special version of his Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice outfit with his friends wearing similar outfits. The &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; segment is featured in the Storybook Land Canal Boats attraction at Disneyland Park in Paris along with the Fantasia Gelati ice cream shop in Fantasyland which is also inspired by the film.

Mickey&#x27;s outfit, water buckets, and Yen Sid&#x27;s spell book and chair are on display as props from &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; segment in the queue of the Mickey &amp; Minnie&#x27;s Runaway Railway attraction at Disneyland.

=== Video games ===
In 1983, Atari released a game called &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; for the Atari 2600, based on that segment of &quot;Fantasia&quot;. The player, as Mickey Mouse, must collect falling stars and comets which will prevent the marching brooms from flooding Yen Sid&#x27;s cavern.

In 1991, a side-scrolling &quot;Fantasia&quot; video game developed by Infogrames was released for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis system. The player controls Mickey Mouse, who must find missing musical notes scattered across four elemental worlds based upon the film&#x27;s segments.

There are several film reel levels based on some of the movie&#x27;s segments such as &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; and &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; that appear in the &quot;Epic Mickey&quot; games. Yen Sid and Chernabog also make cameo appearances in the games (Yen Sid the sorcerer from &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; narrates the openings and endings of the two games and served as the creator of the Wasteland. Chernabog the demon from the &quot;Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria&quot; segment appears as a painting in the first game and appears in the Night on Bald Mountain film reel levels in the second).

The Disney/Square Enix crossover game series &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; features Chernabog as a boss in the first installment. The &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; piece is played during the fight. Yen Sid appears frequently in the series beginning with &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, voiced in English by Corey Burton. Symphony of Sorcery, a world based on the movie, appears in &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot;. Like the Timeless River world in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, it is featured as a period of Mickey Mouse&#x27;s past.

&quot;&quot;, a music game, was developed by Harmonix in association with Disney Interactive for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles. The game utilizes the Kinect device to put players in control of music in a manner similar to Harmonix&#x27; previous rhythm games, affecting the virtual environment and interactive objects within it. The game features licensed contemporary rock music such as Queen and Bruno Mars.

Mickey, in his Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice guise, appears as a playable character in &quot;Disney Infinity&quot;.

=== Concert ===
A live concert presentation of the film named &quot;Disney Fantasia: Live in Concert&quot;, showcases various segments from both &quot;Fantasia&quot; and &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;. The concert version features a live symphony orchestra and piano soloist accompanying projected high definition video segments. The &quot;Fantasia&quot; concert was still touring throughout the world as late as 2022.

===Television===
Several elements from the film appear in television series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;. The hat from &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; appears in the fourth season episode &quot;A Tale of Two Sisters&quot;. As the series progressed, the hat was shown to have the ability to absorb others, and those it absorbed would appear as a star on the hat. The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice himself makes an appearance, where he is an old man who guards the hat in the Enchanted Forest.

Chernabog from &quot;Night On Bald Mountain&quot; also makes an appearance in the episode &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot;.

<doc id="73462" wikidata="Q32432" url="?curid=73462" title="Amadeo I of Spain">
<text>Amadeo I (; 30 May 184518 January 1890), also known as Amadeus, was an Italian prince who reigned as King of Spain from 1870 to 1873. The only king of Spain to come from the House of Savoy, he was the second son of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and was known for most of his life as the Duke of Aosta, the usual title for a second son in the Savoyard dynasty.

He was elected by the Cortes Generales as Spain&#x27;s monarch in 1870, following the deposition of Isabel II, and was sworn in the following year. Amadeo&#x27;s reign was fraught with growing republicanism, Carlist rebellions in the north, and the Cuban independence movement. After three tumultuous years on the throne, he abdicated and returned to Italy in 1873, and the First Spanish Republic was declared as a result.

He founded the Aosta branch of Italy&#x27;s royal House of Savoy, which is junior in agnatic descent to the branch descended from King Umberto I that reigned in Italy until 1946, but senior to the branch of the dukes of Genoa.

==Early life and first marriage==
Prince Amadeo of Savoy was born in Turin, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. He was the third child and second son of King Victor Emmanuel II, who would later become the first King of a unified Italy, and of Archduchess Adelaide of Austria. He was granted the hereditary title of Duke of Aosta from birth.

Entering the Royal Sardinian Army as captain in 1859, he fought through the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866 with the rank of major-general. He led his brigade into action at the Battle of Custoza and was wounded at Monte Croce. In 1868, after his marriage, he was made vice admiral of the Italian Royal Navy, but the position ended when he ascended the Spanish throne.

In 1867, his father yielded to the entreaties of the parliamentary deputy Francesco Cassins, and on 30 May of that year, Amedeo was married to Donna Maria Vittoria dal Pozzo. The King initially opposed the match on the grounds that her family was of insufficient rank and that he hoped for his son to marry a German princess. Despite her princely title, Donna Maria Vittoria was not of royal birth and belonged rather to the Piedmontese nobility. She was, however, the sole heir to her father&#x27;s vast fortune, which subsequent Dukes of Aosta inherited, thereby obtaining wealth independent of their dynastic appanage and allowances from Italy&#x27;s kings. The wedding day of Prince Amedeo and Donna Maria Vittoria was marred by the death of a station master, who was crushed under the wheels of the honeymoon train.

In March 1870, Maria Vittoria appealed to the King to remonstrate with her husband for marital infidelities, which caused her hurt and embarrassment. However, the King wrote in reply that he understood her feelings, but he considered that she had no right to dictate her husband&#x27;s behaviour, and her jealousy was unbecoming.

==King of Spain==
After the Glorious Revolution deposed Isabella II in September 1868, the new &quot;Cortes&quot; began the task of searching for a suitable liberal-leaning candidate from a new dynasty to replace her. Eventually the Duke of Aosta was taken into consideration. His father was a descendant of King Philip II of Spain through his daughter Infanta Catalina Micaela of Spain and her son Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano, while his mother was a descendant of King Charles III of Spain through his daughter Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain. The Savoyard prince was elected king as Amadeo I on 16 November 1870 and swore to uphold the Constitution in Madrid on 2 January 1871. While the new king was on his way to Spain, General Juan Prim, his chief supporter, was assassinated and Amadeo took the oath in the presence of Prim&#x27;s corpse.

Amadeo then had to deal with difficult situations, with unstable Spanish politics, republican conspiracies, Carlist uprisings, a pro-independence war in Cuba, interparty disputes, fugitive governments and assassination attempts. Amadeo could count on the support of only the Progressive Party, whose leaders traded off in the government by its parliamentary majority and electoral fraud. The progressives were divided into monarchists and constitutionalists, which worsened the country&#x27;s instability, and in 1872 a violent outburst of interparty conflicts hit a peak. There was a Carlist uprising in the Basque and Catalan regions, and republican uprisings later occurred in cities across the country. The artillery corps of the army went on strike, and the government instructed Amadeo to discipline them.

Though warned of a plot against his life on 18 August 1872, he refused to take precautions. While returning from Buen Retiro Park to Madrid in company with the queen, he was repeatedly shot at in Vía Avenal. The royal carriage was struck by several revolver and rifle bullets. The horses were wounded, but its occupants escaped unhurt. A period of calm followed that event.

With the possibility of reigning without popular support, Amadeo issued an order against the artillery corps and then immediately abdicated from the Spanish throne on 11 February 1873. At ten o&#x27;clock the same night, the First Spanish Republic was proclaimed, and Amadeo made an appearance before the Cortes and proclaimed the Spanish people to be ungovernable.

==Later life==

Completely disgusted, the ex-monarch left Spain and returned to Italy, where he resumed the title of Duke of Aosta. The First Spanish Republic lasted less than two years, and in November 1874 Alfonso XII, the son of Isabella II, was proclaimed king, with Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, Spanish intermittent prime minister from 1873 until his assassination in 1897, briefly serving as regent.

Amadeo&#x27;s first wife died in 1876. In 1888 he married his French niece, Princess Maria Letizia Bonaparte, Duchess of Aosta (20 November 186625 October 1926), daughter of his sister Maria Clotilde and of Prince Napoléon Bonaparte, a nephew of Napoleon I. They had one child, Umberto (1889–1918), who died of the Spanish flu during the First World War.

Amadeo remained in Turin, Italy until his death on 18 January 1890. His friend Puccini composed the famous elegy for string quartet &quot;Crisantemi&quot; in his memory.

==Legacy==

The municipality of Amadeo, in the province of Cavite, in the Philippines, which was a colony of Spain, was named after Amadeo I when it was established on 15 July 1872, during his reign.

A large salt lake, Lake Amadeus, and the subsequently-named Amadeus Basin, where it lies in central Australia, is also named after Amadeo I by the explorer Ernest Giles, who was the first European to encounter the lake, in 1872.

<text>Fatty&#x27;s Tintype Tangle is a 1915 comedy short film (2 reel). A man (Fatty), tired of his mother-in-law&#x27;s henpecking, leaves home in anger and sits on a park bench, where a photographer takes a picture of him sitting next to a married woman, whose husband is not pleased. Conflict ensues.

The movie stars Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle (who also directed), Louise Fazenda, Edgar Kennedy, Minta Durfee and Frank Hayes. Arbuckle performs several feats of dexterity in the first few minutes and, near the end, runs and bounces on 17 closely spaced apparent telephone wires over 20 feet (6 m) above the ground.

In 1995, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; It has often been shown on Turner Classic Movies.

<text>Five Easy Pieces is a 1970 American road drama film directed by Bob Rafelson, written by Rafelson and Carole Eastman (as Adrien Joyce), and starring Jack Nicholson, Karen Black, Susan Anspach, Lois Smith, and Ralph Waite. The film tells the story of surly oil rig worker Bobby Dupea (Nicholson), whose rootless blue-collar existence belies his privileged youth as a piano prodigy. When Bobby learns that his father is dying, he travels to his family home in Washington to visit him, taking along his uncouth girlfriend (Black).

The film was nominated for four Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards, and was inducted into the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2000, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Bobby Dupea works in an oil field in Kern County, California. He spends most of his time with his girlfriend Rayette, a waitress who has dreams of singing country music, or with fellow oil worker Elton, with whom he bowls, gets drunk, and philanders.

When Bobby gets Rayette pregnant and Elton is arrested, Bobby quits his job and goes to Los Angeles, where his sister Partita is making a classical piano recording. She tells Bobby, who was once also a pianist, that their father has suffered two strokes, and urges him to reconcile with the family at their home in Washington.

Rayette threatens to kill herself if Bobby leaves her, so he reluctantly asks her along. Driving north, they pick up Terry and Palm, two stranded women headed for Alaska. The latter launches into a monologue about the evils of consumerism. The four are thrown out of a diner after Bobby argues with an obstinate waitress over his order. Bobby drops off Terry and Palm when they get to Washington.

Ashamed to introduce Rayette to his upper-class family, Bobby registers her in a motel before driving alone to the family home on an island in Puget Sound. He finds Partita giving their father a haircut; the old man seems completely oblivious to him. At dinner, Bobby meets Catherine Van Oost, a young pianist studying under and engaged to his amiable brother Carl, a violinist. Despite personality differences, Catherine and Bobby are immediately attracted to each other. Learning that Bobby was once a pianist, she asks him to play for her. She is moved by his rendition of Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Prelude, Op. 28, No. 4, but Bobby dismisses her, insisting that he played with &quot;no inner feeling&quot;. Angered by Bobby&#x27;s rejection, she leaves, but he follows after her and they have sex in her room.

Rayette runs out of money at the motel and comes to the Dupea estate unannounced. Her presence creates an awkward situation, but when intellectual family friend Samia Glavia ridicules her, Bobby comes to her defense. Storming out of the room in search of Catherine, he discovers his father&#x27;s male nurse giving Partita a sensual massage. He picks a fight with the nurse, who easily subdues him.

Bobby tries to persuade Catherine to go away with him, but she declines, telling him he cannot ask for love when he does not love himself, or anything at all. After tearfully confessing his regrets to his unresponsive father, Bobby leaves for California with Rayette. Shortly into the trip, they stop for gas and coffee; while Rayette&#x27;s view is obstructed, Bobby hitches a ride on a truck headed north.

== Production ==
While the film&#x27;s earlier scenes were shot in California, the majority was filmed in the Pacific Northwest. Filming primarily occurred on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, with additional photography occurring in Florence and Portland, Oregon. The diner sequence, in which Robert pesters an obstinate waitress, was filmed at a Denny&#x27;s along Interstate 5 near Eugene, Oregon.&lt;ref name=&quot;katu/nicholson-booth&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oregonconfluence/nicholson-80&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Screenwriter Carole Eastman based the scene on a real incident she witnessed at Pupi&#x27;s Bakery and Sidewalk Café in Los Angeles,&lt;ref name=&quot;cigaraficionado/6022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;malibutimes/3633ff30&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo/1985/06/14/12635918&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;waterandpower/Hollywood-1920+&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where an aggrieved Jack Nicholson pushed all the plates and cups off of a table, and on Rafelson frequently asking for substitutions at restaurants.

To prepare for his role, Jack Nicholson undertook piano lessons from Polish concert pianist Josef Pacholczyk.

In 2022, Sally Struthers revealed that director Bob Rafelson coerced her into appearing nude on set against her stated wishes, and made a false promise that she would not appear nude in the final cut.

<doc id="73469" wikidata="Q156317" url="?curid=73469" title="Yucca">
<text>Yucca is a genus of perennial shrubs and trees in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Agavoideae. Its 40–50 species are notable for their rosettes of evergreen, tough, sword-shaped leaves and large terminal panicles of white or whitish flowers. They are native to the Americas and the Caribbean in a wide range of habitats, from humid rainforest and wet subtropical ecosystems to the hot and dry (arid) deserts and savanna.

Early reports of the species were confused with the cassava (&quot;Manihot esculenta&quot;). Consequently, Linnaeus mistakenly derived the generic name from the Taíno word for the latter, &quot;yuca&quot;. The Aztecs living in Mexico since before the Spanish arrival, in Nahuatl, call the local yucca species (&quot;Yucca gigantea&quot;) , which gave the Spanish . is also used for &quot;Yucca filifera&quot;.

==Distribution==

The natural distribution range of the genus &quot;Yucca&quot; (49 species and 24 subspecies) covers a vast area of the Americas. The genus is represented throughout Mexico and extends into Guatemala (&quot;Yucca guatemalensis&quot;). It also extends to the north through Baja California in the west, northwards into the southwestern United States, through the drier central states as far north as southern Alberta in Canada (&quot;Yucca glauca&quot; ssp. &quot;albertana&quot;).

Yucca is also native northward to the coastal lowlands and dry beach scrub of the coastal areas of the southeastern United States, along the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic States from coastal Texas to Maryland.

Yuccas have adapted to an equally vast range of climatic and ecological conditions. They are found in rocky deserts and badlands, in prairies and grassland, in mountainous regions, woodlands, in coastal sands (&quot;Yucca filamentosa&quot;), and even in subtropical and semitemperate zones. Several species occur in humid tropical zones (&quot;Yucca lacandonica&quot;) but most species occur in arid conditions, with the deserts of North America being regarded as the center of diversity for the genus.

==Ecology==
Yuccas have a very specialized, mutualistic pollination system; being pollinated by yucca moths (family Prodoxidae); the insect transfers the pollen from the stamens of one plant to the stigma of another, and at the same time lays an egg in the flower; the moth larva then feeds on some of the developing seeds, always leaving enough seed to perpetuate the species. Certain species of the yucca moth have evolved antagonistic features against the plant. They do not assist in the plant&#x27;s pollination efforts while continuing to lay their eggs in the plant for protection.

Yucca species are the host plants for the caterpillars of the yucca giant-skipper (&quot;Megathymus yuccae&quot;), ursine giant-skipper (&quot;Megathymus ursus&quot;), and Strecker&#x27;s giant-skipper (&quot;Megathymus streckeri&quot;).

 Beetle herbivores include yucca weevils, in the Curculionidae.

==Uses==
Yuccas are widely grown as ornamental plants in gardens. Many species also bear edible parts, including fruits, seeds, flowers, flowering stems, and (more rarely) roots. References to yucca root as food often arise from confusion with the similarly pronounced, but botanically unrelated, yuca, also called cassava or manioc (&quot;Manihot esculenta&quot;). Roots of soaptree yucca (&quot;Yucca elata&quot;) are high in saponins and are used as a shampoo in Native American rituals. Dried yucca leaves and trunk fibers have a low ignition temperature, making the plant desirable for use in starting fires via friction. The stem (when dried) that sports the flowers is often used in conjunction with a sturdy piece of cedar for fire-making.
In rural Appalachian areas, species such as &quot;Yucca filamentosa&quot; are referred to as &quot;meat hangers&quot;. With their sharp-spined tips, the tough, fibrous leaves were used to puncture meat and knotted to form a loop with which to hang meat for salt curing or in smokehouses. The fibers can be used to make domestic items
or for manufacturing cordage,
be it sewing-thread or rope.
Yucca extract is also used as a foaming agent in some beverages such as root beer and soda.
Yucca powder and sap are derived from the logs of the plant; such extracts can be produced by mechanical squeezing and subsequent evaporation of the sap, and are widely used in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals

The flower petals are commonly eaten in Central America, but the plant&#x27;s reproductive organs (the anthers and ovaries) are first removed because of their bitterness. The petals are blanched for 5 minutes, and then cooked &quot;a la mexicana&quot; (with tomato, onion, chili) or in &quot;tortitas con salsa&quot; (egg-battered patties with green or red sauce). In Guatemala, they are boiled and eaten with lemon juice.

In El Salvador, the tender tips of stems are eaten and known locally as &quot;cogollo de izote&quot;.

==Cultivation==
The most common houseplant yucca is &quot;Yucca gigantea&quot;.

Yuccas are widely grown as architectural plants providing a dramatic accent to landscape design. They tolerate a range of conditions but are best grown in full sun in subtropical or mild temperate areas. In gardening centres and horticultural catalogues, they are usually grouped with other architectural plants such as cordylines and phormiums.

Several species of yucca can be grown outdoors in temperate climates, including:-

* &quot;Yucca filamentosa&quot;
* &quot;Yucca flaccida&quot;
* &quot;Yucca glauca&quot;
* &quot;Yucca gloriosa&quot; 
* &quot;Yucca recurvifolia&quot;
* &quot;Yucca rostrata&quot;
==Symbolism==
The yucca flower is the state flower of New Mexico in the southwest United States. No species name is given in the citation; however, the New Mexico Centennial Blue Book from 2012 references the soaptree yucca (&quot;Yucca elata&quot;) as one of the more widespread species in New Mexico.

The Yucca flower is also the national flower of El Salvador, where it is known as .

== Species ==
, the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families recognizes 49 species of &quot;Yucca&quot; and several hybrids:
A number of other species previously classified in &quot;Yucca&quot; are now classified in the genera &quot;Dasylirion&quot;, &quot;Furcraea&quot;, &quot;Hesperaloe&quot;, &quot;Hesperoyucca&quot;, and &quot;Nolina&quot;.

==Cultivars==
From 1897 to 1907, Carl Ludwig Sprenger created and named 122 &quot;Yucca&quot; hybrids.

<doc id="73471" wikidata="Q2667789" url="?curid=73471" title="Flash Gordon (serial)">
<text>Flash Gordon is a 1936 superhero serial film. Presented in 13 chapters, it is the first screen adventure for Flash Gordon, the comic-strip character created by Alex Raymond in 1934. It presents the story of Gordon&#x27;s visit to the planet Mongo and his encounters with the evil Emperor Ming the Merciless. Buster Crabbe, Jean Rogers, Charles Middleton, Priscilla Lawson and Frank Shannon portray the film&#x27;s central characters. In 1996, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Cast==

* Buster Crabbe as Flash Gordon
* Charles B. Middleton as Ming the Merciless
* Jean Rogers as Dale Arden
* Priscilla Lawson as Princess Aura
* Frank Shannon as Dr. Alexis Zarkov
* Richard Alexander as Prince Barin
* Jack Lipson as King Vultan
* Theodore Lorch as Second High Priest
* James Pierce as Prince Thun
* Duke York as King Kala
* Earl Askam as Officer Torch
* Lon Poff as First High Priest &quot;(uncredited)&quot;
* Richard Tucker as Professor Gordon
* George Cleveland as Professor Hensley
* Muriel Goodspeed as Zona
Cast notes:
* Eddie Parker served as a stand-in and stunt double for Buster Crabbe.
* Crash Corrigan, who would later star in other serials, wore a modified gorilla suit to portray the &quot;orangopoid&quot; seen in chapters 8 and 9.
* Glenn Strange in uncredited roles wore the &quot;Gocko&quot; lobster-clawed dragon costume and also appears as one of Ming&#x27;s soldiers.
* Richard Alexander helped to design his own costume, which included a leather chest plate painted gold.
* Early film fan historians claimed that actor Lon Poff, playing the first of Ming&#x27;s two high priests, died shortly after production began and was replaced by Theodore Lorch. In fact, however, only Poff&#x27;s character died, or rather was killed by Ming in an act of fury and replaced by Lorch&#x27;s High Priest, but the scene was cut from the final print. Poff did not die until 1952.

==Production==
* According to Harmon and Glut, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; had a budget of over a million dollars. Stedman, however, writes that it was &quot;reportedly&quot; US$350,000 (equivalent to $ million in ).
* Many props and other elements in the film were recycled from earlier Universal productions. The watchtower sets used in &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931) appear again as several interiors within Ming&#x27;s palace. One of the large Egyptian statues seen in &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1932) is the idol of the Great God Tao. The laboratory set and a shot of the Moon rushing past Zarkov&#x27;s returning rocket ship from space are from &quot;The Invisible Ray&quot; (1936). Zarkov&#x27;s rocket ship and scenes of dancers swarming over a gigantic idol were reused from &quot;Just Imagine&quot; (1930). Ming&#x27;s attack on Earth is footage from old silent newsreels, and an entire dance segment is from &quot;The Midnight Sun&quot; (1927), while some of the laboratory equipment came from &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935). The music was also recycled from several other films, notably &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Bombay Mail&quot;, &quot;The Black Cat&quot; (both 1934), &quot;Werewolf of London&quot; (1935), and &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1933). 
* Crabbe had his hair dyed blond to appear more like the comic-strip Flash Gordon. He was reportedly very self-conscious about this and kept his hat on in public at all times, even with women present. He did not like men whistling at him. Jean Rogers also had her hair dyed blonde prior to production, &quot;apparently to capitalize on the popularity of Jean Harlow&quot;. Brunette was actually the natural hair color for both actors.
* According to the reference &quot;The Great Movie Serials: Their Sound and Fury&quot; (1973) by Jim Harmon and Donald Glut, Ming&#x27;s makeup and costuming were designed to resemble Fu Manchu, a fictional &quot;supervillain&quot; popularized in earlier Hollywood films and in a series of novels first published in England in 1913.
* Exterior shots, such as the Earth crew&#x27;s first steps on Mongo, were filmed at Bronson Canyon.
* The musical score was built around the symphonic poem Les Preludes by the nineteenth century composer and pianist Franz Liszt (1811-1886).

==Release and reception==
Universal hoped to regain an adult audience for serials with the release of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; and by presenting it in many of the top or &quot;A-level&quot; theaters in large cities across the United States. Multiple newspapers in 1936, including some not even carrying the Flash Gordon comic strip, featured half- and three-quarter-page stories about the film as well as copies of Raymond&#x27;s drawings and publicity stills that highlighted characters and chapter settings.

The film was the first outright science-fiction serial, although earlier serials had contained science-fiction elements such as gadgets. Six of the fourteen serials released within five years of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; were science fiction.

For syndication to TV in the 1950s, the serial was renamed &quot;Space Soldiers&quot;, so as not to be confused with the newly made, also syndicated TV series, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;.

The serial film was also edited into a 72-minute feature version in 1936, which was only exhibited abroad, until being released in the US as 1949 as Rocket Ship by Sherman S. Krellberg&#x27;s Filmcraft Pictures.

A different feature version of the serial, at 90 minutes, was sold directly to television in 1966 under the title &quot;Spaceship to the Unknown&quot;.

&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; was Universal&#x27;s second-highest-grossing film of 1936, after &quot;Three Smart Girls&quot;, a musical starring Deanna Durbin. The Hays Office, however, objected to the revealing costumes worn by Dale, Aura and the other female characters. In response to those objections, Universal designed more modest outfits for the female performers in the film&#x27;s two sequels.

In his review of the film in the 2015 reference &quot;Radio Times Guide to Films&quot;, Alan Jones describes &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; as &quot;non-stop thrill-a-minute stuff as Flash battles one adversary after another&quot;, and he states that it is &quot;the best of the Crabbe trilogy of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; films&quot;.

==Sequels==
Two sequels to &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, also in serial form and starring Buster Crabbe, followed the popular 1936 production: &quot;Flash Gordon&#x27;s Trip to Mars&quot; (15 chapters) in 1938 and &quot;Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe&quot; (12 chapters) in 1940. Between the releases of those two later productions, Crabbe starred in an entirely separate but similarly structured Universal science-fiction serial portraying Buck Rogers, another popular character also featured in magazines, comic strips, and on radio in the late 1920s and 1930s.

<doc id="73473" wikidata="Q534459" url="?curid=73473" title="Footlight Parade">
<text>Footlight Parade is a 1933 American musical film directed by Lloyd Bacon, with songs written by Harry Warren (music), Al Dubin (lyrics), Sammy Fain (music) and Irving Kahal (lyrics). The film&#x27;s numbers were staged and choreographed by Busby Berkeley. It starred James Cagney, Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, with featured appearances by Frank McHugh, Guy Kibbee, Hugh Herbert, and Ruth Donnelly.

The film&#x27;s screenplay was written by Manuel Seff and James Seymour, based on a story by Robert Lord and Peter Milne.

In 1992, &quot;Footlight Parade&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Chester Kent (James Cagney) replaces his failing career as a director of Broadway musicals with a new one as the creator of musical numbers called &quot;prologues&quot;, short live stage productions presented in movie theaters before the main feature is shown. He faces pressure from his business partners to continuously create a large number of marketable prologues to service theaters throughout the country, but his job is made harder by a rival who is stealing his ideas, probably with assistance from someone working inside his own company. Kent is so overwhelmed with work that he doesn&#x27;t realize that his secretary Nan (Joan Blondell) has fallen in love with him and is doing her best to protect him as well as his interests.

Kent&#x27;s business partners announce that they have a big deal pending with the Apolinaris theater circuit, but getting the contract depends on Kent impressing Mr. Apolinaris (Paul Porcasi) with three spectacular prologues, presented on the same night, one after another at three different theaters. Kent locks himself and his staff in the offices to prevent espionage leaks while they choreograph and rehearse the three production numbers. Kent then stages &quot;Honeymoon Hotel&quot;, &quot;By a Waterfall&quot; (featuring the famous &quot;Human Waterfall&quot;) and &quot;Shanghai Lil&quot;, featuring Cagney and Ruby Keeler dancing together.

==Cast==
*James Cagney as Chester Kent, creator of musical prologues
*Joan Blondell as Nan Prescott, Chester&#x27;s secretary
*Ruby Keeler as Bea Thorn, dancer turned secretary turned dancer
*Dick Powell as Scott &quot;Scotty&quot; Blair, juvenile lead who is Mrs. Gould&#x27;s &quot;protégé&quot;
*Frank McHugh as Francis, the dance director
*Ruth Donnelly as Harriet Gould, the producer&#x27;s spoiled and nepotistic wife
*Guy Kibbee as Silas &quot;Si&quot; Gould, producer
*Hugh Herbert as Charlie Bowers, Mrs. Gould&#x27;s brother and the censor of Kent&#x27;s programs
*Claire Dodd as Vivian Rich, Nan&#x27;s gold-digging friend who sets her sights on Chester
*Gordon Westcott as Harry Thompson, Kent&#x27;s assistant
*Arthur Hohl as Al Frazer, the other producer
*Renee Whitney as Cynthia Kent, Chester&#x27;s greedy estranged wife
*Paul Porcasi as George Apolinaris, owner of a chain of movie theaters
*Barbara Rogers as Gracie, the spy among Chester&#x27;s dancers
*Philip Faversham as Joe Barrington, another juvenile lead and &quot;protégé&quot; of Mrs. Gould
*Herman Bing as Fralick, the music director
*Billy Barty as &quot;Mouse&quot; and &quot;Little Boy&quot;
*Hobart Cavanaugh as Title-Thinker-upper
*George Chandler as druggist

Cast notes:
*Dorothy Lamour, Victoria Vinton, Ann Sothern and Lynn Browning were among the many chorus girls in the film. It was Lamour&#x27;s film debut.
* It is sometimes written that John Garfield made his (uncredited) film debut in the &quot;Shanghai Lil&quot; routine in a (5/6ths of a second) shot. Turner Classic Movies perpetuates the mistake in an Article on TCM.com and debunks it in the Notes section of the same entry. The 2003 Turner Classic Movies documentary &quot;The John Garfield Story&quot; also refutes this, as do several John Garfield biographies that give timelines where he is in New York and then on tour in Chicago with the revival of the play &quot;Counsellor-at-Law&quot; in 1933. 
* The movie briefly shown in the theater early in the film is &quot;The Telegraph Trail&quot;, starring a young John Wayne and, coincidentally or not, Frank McHugh.

==Musical numbers==
*&quot;Honeymoon Hotel&quot; – by Harry Warren (music) and Al Dubin (lyrics)
*&quot;Shanghai Lil&quot; – by Harry Warren (music) and Al Dubin (lyrics)
*&quot;By a Waterfall&quot; – by Sammy Fain (music) and Irving Kahal (lyrics)
*&quot;My Shadow&quot; – by Sammy Fain (music) and Irving Kahal (lyrics)
*&quot;Ah, the Moon Is Here&quot; – by Sammy Fain (music) and Irving Kahal (lyrics)
*&quot;Sitting on a Backyard Fence&quot; – by Sammy Fain (music) and Irving Kahal (lyrics)

==Production==
Looking for a role different from the gangster films such as &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; that catapulted him to fame, Cagney actively campaigned for the lead role of Chester Kent, based on well-known impresario Chester Hale of the prologue production company Fanchon and Marco. Cagney had gotten his start in vaudeville and Broadway before going into film work; the film became his first on-screen appearance as a dancer. Cagney had only fallen into his gangster persona when he and Edward Woods switched roles three days into the shooting of 1931&#x27;s &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;. That role catapulted Cagney into stardom and a series of gangster films, which throughout his career, Cagney found to be as much a straitjacket as a benefit.

While Powell&#x27;s role was written specifically for him, he was replaced by Stanley Smith when he fell ill. When he recovered, Smith&#x27;s scenes were reshot with Powell. The film became the third pairing of Powell and Ruby Keeler after &quot;42nd Street&quot; (1933) and &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot;, the first two Warner Bros. Busby Berkeley musicals. Similarly, Dorothy Tennant was initially cast as Harriet Gould, but replaced by Ruth Donnelly. Other actors considered for various roles included Eugene Pallette, George Dobbs and Patricia Ellis.

Warner Bros. initially signed for Larry Ceballos to choreograph the film when Berkely was unavailable. However, when Berkeley was able to make changes to his schedule, the studio let Ceballos go. Ceballos subsequently sued Berkeley and the studio for $100,000 for breach of contract.

Production took place at the Warner Bros. studio in Burbank, California between June and September 1933, costing an estimated $703,000 to make (equivalent to approximately $ in ). It premiered on September 30, 1933, with a general release on October 21.

===Pre-Code era scenes and promotion===
The film was made during the pre-Code era, and its humor is sometimes quite risqué, with multiple references to prostitution and suggestions of profanity largely unseen again in studio films until the 1960s, when the Production Code collapsed. For example, Dick Powell&#x27;s character is being &quot;kept&quot; by Mrs. Gould until he falls in love with another girl.

Joan Blondell&#x27;s character of Nan Prescott is the center of several lines and moments. She introduces her roommate, Vivian Rich, as &quot;Miss Bi... Rich&quot;; and later, when Vivian tries to take advantage of an intoxicated Chester, Nan kicks her out of their apartment, claiming Vivian will have a job &quot;as long as there are sidewalks.&quot; In the Shanghai Lil number, it is clear that Lil and all the other girls are prostitutes working the waterfront bars along with scenes of an opium den. A character played by Hugh Herbert acts as the censor for Kent&#x27;s productions, constantly telling Kent certain parts of his production numbers have to be changed. His character is portrayed as buffoonish and comical, saying disagreeable lines to Kent such as &quot;You must put brassieres on those dolls...&quot; (referring to actual toy dolls) &quot;...uh uh, you know Connecticut.&quot;

As with many other pre-Code films, including musicals, promotional materials featured scantily clad women on movie release posters, lobby cards and promotional photographs, as seen of Joan Blondell.

==Reception==
The film made $1,601,000 in the United States, and an additional $815,000 internationally. Warner Bros. reported the film made a profit of $819,080, making it one of the most successful films of the year.

<doc id="73475" wikidata="Q766089" url="?curid=73475" title="Force of Evil">
<text>Force of Evil is a 1948 American film noir starring John Garfield and Beatrice Pearson and directed by Abraham Polonsky. It was adapted by Polonsky and Ira Wolfert from Wolfert&#x27;s novel &quot;Tucker&#x27;s People&quot;. Polonsky had been a screenwriter for the boxing film &quot;Body and Soul&quot; (1947), in which Garfield had also played the male lead.

In 1994, &quot;Force of Evil&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Lawyer Joe Morse works for a powerful gangster, Tucker, who wishes to consolidate and control the numbers racket in New York City. This requires absorbing many smaller outfits, one of which is run by Morse&#x27;s older brother, Leo. One relishes his life in the underworld, the other is disgusted by it and seeks to minimize its impact. Even when seeking to soften things for Leo, things go wrong for Joe, and tragedy befalls both.

==Cast==
* John Garfield as Joe Morse
* Beatrice Pearson as Doris Lowry
* Thomas Gomez as Leo Morse
* Marie Windsor as Edna Tucker
* Howland Chamberlain as Frederick &quot;Freddie&quot; Bauer
* Roy Roberts as Ben Tucker
* Paul Fix as Bill Ficco
* Stanley Prager as Wally
* Barry Kelley as Det. Egan

==Reception==
===Critical response===
When the film was released, the staff at &quot;Variety&quot; magazine gave the film a mixed review, praising its production values but panning its focus and &quot;intrusively&quot; flowery language:

Bosley Crowther, the film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, liked the film, and wrote, &quot;But for all its unpleasant nature, it must be said that this film is a dynamic crime-and-punishment drama, brilliantly and broadly realized. Out of material and ideas that have been worked over time after time, so that they&#x27;ve long since become stale and hackneyed, it gathers suspense and dread, a genuine feeling of the bleakness of crime and a terrible sense of doom. And it catches in eloquent tatters of on-the-wing dialogue moving intimations of the pathos of hopeful lives gone wrong.&quot;

Wrote film historian Andrew Sarris in 1968, &quot;&quot;Force of Evil&quot; stands up under repeated viewings as one of the great films of the modern American cinema and Garfield&#x27;s taxicab scene with Beatrice Pearson takes away some of the luster Kazan&#x27;s Brando-Steiger &quot;tour de force&quot; in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;.&quot;

In the decades since its release &quot;Force of Evil&quot; has been recognized by some as a high point of the film noir genre, powerful in its poetic images and language, by such film critics and historians such as William S. Pechter and Andrew Dickos. Its influence has been acknowledged many times by Martin Scorsese in the making of his crime dramas.

===Box-office===
According to MGM records the film earned $948,000 in the US and $217,000 overseas.

<text>The Forgotten Frontier is a 1931 American documentary film about the Frontier Nursing Service, nurses on horseback, who traveled the back roads of the Appalachian Mountains of eastern Kentucky. It was directed by Mary Marvin Breckinridge, and featured her cousin, Mary Breckinridge, who was a nurse-midwife and founded the Frontier Nursing Service. Also featured are the people of Leslie County, Kentucky, many of whom reenacted their stories.

The film was shot with a hand-cranked camera, often in extreme climate. Stills created during the film&#x27;s production are available at the Library of Congress.

A soundtrack was added in the 1990s by the Library of Congress.

In 1996, this film has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant films&quot;.

Footage from the film was used in the 1984 documentary &quot;Frontier Nursing Service&quot;.

<doc id="73488" wikidata="Q546829" url="?curid=73488" title="Frankenstein (1931 film)">
<text>Frankenstein is a 1931 American gothic pre-Code science fiction horror film directed by James Whale, produced by Carl Laemmle Jr., and adapted from a 1927 play by Peggy Webling, which in turn was based on Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1818 novel &quot;Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus&quot;. The Webling play was adapted by John L. Balderston and the screenplay written by Francis Edward Faragoh and Garrett Fort, with uncredited contributions from Robert Florey and John Russell.

&quot;Frankenstein&quot; stars Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein (Victor Frankenstein in the novel), an obsessed scientist who digs up corpses with his assistant in order to assemble a living being from body parts. The resulting creature, often known as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, is portrayed by Boris Karloff. The makeup for the monster was provided by Jack Pierce. Alongside Clive and Karloff, the film&#x27;s cast also includes Mae Clarke, John Boles, Dwight Frye, and Edward Van Sloan.

Produced and distributed by Universal Pictures, the film was a commercial success upon release, and was generally well received by both critics and audiences. It spawned a number of sequels and spin-offs, and has had a significant impact on popular culture: the imagery of a maniacal &quot;mad&quot; scientist with a hunchbacked assistant and the film&#x27;s depiction of Frankenstein&#x27;s monster have since become iconic. In 1991, the United States Library of Congress selected &quot;Frankenstein&quot; for preservation in the National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In a village of the Bavarian Alps, Henry Frankenstein and his assistant Fritz, a hunchback, piece together a human body. Some of the parts are from freshly buried bodies, and some from the bodies of recently hanged criminals. In a laboratory he&#x27;s built inside a watchtower, Henry desires to create a human, giving this body life through electrical devices. He still needs a brain for his creation. At a nearby school, Henry&#x27;s former teacher Dr. Waldman shows his class the brain of an average human being and the corrupted brain of a criminal for comparison. Henry sends Fritz to steal the healthy brain from Waldman&#x27;s class. Fritz accidentally damages it, and so brings Henry the corrupt brain.

Henry&#x27;s fiancée Elizabeth Lavenza speaks with their friend Victor about the scientist&#x27;s peculiar actions and his seclusion. Elizabeth and Victor ask Waldman for help understanding Henry&#x27;s behavior, and Waldman reveals he is aware Henry wishes to create life. Concerned for Henry, they arrive at the lab just as he makes his final preparations, the lifeless body on an operating table. As a storm rages, Henry invites Elizabeth and the others to watch. Henry and Fritz raise the operating table toward an opening at the top of the tower. The creature and Henry&#x27;s equipment are exposed to the lightning storm and empowered, bringing the creature to life. Henry is ecstatic at the sight of the creature moving and has to be restrained by Victor and Waldman. Henry proclaims he now knows what it feels like to be God.

Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster, despite its grotesque form, seems to be an innocent, childlike creation. Henry welcomes it into his laboratory and asks it to sit, which it does. He opens up the roof, causing the Monster to reach out towards the sunlight. Fritz enters with a flaming torch, which frightens the Monster. Its fright is mistaken by Henry and Waldman for an attempt to attack them, and it is chained in the dungeon, where Fritz antagonizes it with a torch. Hearing Fritz screaming in the dungeon, Henry and Waldman run down, finding that the Monster has forcefully hanged Fritz. The Monster lunges at the two but they lock the Monster inside. Realizing the Monster must be destroyed, Henry prepares an injection of a powerful drug and the two conspire to release the Monster and inject it as it attacks. When the door is unlocked the Monster lunges at Henry as Waldman injects the drug into the Monster&#x27;s back. The Monster falls to the floor unconscious.

Henry collapses from exhaustion, and Elizabeth and Henry&#x27;s father take him home. Henry is worried about the Monster, but Waldman reassures him that he will destroy it. While Henry is at home, recovered and preparing for his wedding, Waldman examines the Monster. As he prepares to vivisect it, the Monster strangles him. It escapes from the tower and wanders through the landscape, encountering a farmer&#x27;s young daughter, Maria. She asks him to play a game with her in which they toss flowers onto a lake. The Monster enjoys the game, but when he runs out of flowers, he throws Maria into the lake, inadvertently drowning her.

With preparations for the wedding completed, Henry is happy with Elizabeth. They are to marry as soon as Waldman arrives. Victor rushes in, saying that Waldman has been found strangled. Henry suspects the Monster. The Monster enters Elizabeth&#x27;s room, causing her to scream. When the searchers arrive, they find Elizabeth in shock, then unconscious. The Monster has escaped.

Maria&#x27;s father arrives, carrying his drowned daughter&#x27;s body. He says she was murdered, and the villagers form a lynch mob to capture the Monster. During the search, Henry is attacked by the Monster. The Monster knocks Henry unconscious and carries him to an old windmill. The peasants hear the creature carrying Henry and find it climbing to the top, dragging Henry with it. The Monster hurls the scientist to the ground. His fall is broken by the wooden blades of the windmill, saving his life. Some of the villagers bring him home while the rest of the mob set the windmill ablaze, with the Monster trapped inside with nowhere to escape.

At Castle Frankenstein, Henry&#x27;s father celebrates the wedding of his recovered son with a toast to a future grandchild.

==Production==
In 1930, Universal Studios had lost $2.2 million in revenues. Within 48 hours of its opening at New York&#x27;s Roxy Theatre on February 12, 1931, &quot;Dracula&quot; starring Bela Lugosi had sold 50,000 tickets, building a momentum that culminated in a $700,000 profit, the largest of Universal&#x27;s 1931 releases. As a result, the head of production, Carl Laemmle Jr., announced immediate plans for more horror films. It purchased the film rights to John L. Balderston&#x27;s planned stage adaptation of Peggy Webling&#x27;s British stage adaptation of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley&#x27;s original novel.

Immediately following his success in &quot;Dracula&quot;, Lugosi had hoped to play Henry Frankenstein in Universal&#x27;s original film concept. However, the actor was expected by producer Carl Laemmle Jr. to play the Monster (a common move for a contract player in a film studio at the time) to keep his famous name on the bill.

&quot;Frankenstein&quot; was also inspired by &quot;The Golem&quot;, a surreal novel based on Jewish folklore, and its film adaptation, a silent horror film where the Golem is a literal being rather than the ambiguous existence it was in the novel.

Although this is often regarded as one of the worst decisions in any actor&#x27;s career, in actuality, the part that Lugosi was offered was not the same character that Karloff eventually played. The initial director was Robert Florey, who had re-characterized the Monster as a simple killing machine, without a touch of human interest or pathos, unlike in the original Shelley novel. This reportedly caused Lugosi to complain, &quot;I was a star in my country and I will not be a scarecrow over here!&quot; Florey later wrote that &quot;the Hungarian actor didn&#x27;t show himself very enthusiastic for the role and didn&#x27;t want to play it&quot;. However, the decision may not have been Lugosi&#x27;s in any case, since recent evidence suggests that he was kicked off the project, along with director Robert Florey, when the newly arrived James Whale asked for the property and later cast Karloff, who resembled Whale.
Actors who worked on the project either were, or shortly became familiar to the fans of the Universal horror films. These included Frederick Kerr as the old Baron Frankenstein, Henry&#x27;s father; Lionel Belmore as Herr Vogel, the Bürgermeister; Marilyn Harris as Little Maria, the girl the Monster accidentally kills; Dwight Frye as Frankenstein&#x27;s hunchbacked assistant, Fritz; and Michael Mark as Ludwig, Maria&#x27;s father.

Kenneth Strickfaden designed the electrical effects that were used in the &quot;creation scene&quot;. They were so successful that such effects came to be considered an essential part of every subsequent Universal film involving Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster. Accordingly, the equipment used to produce them has come to be referred to in fan circles as &quot;Strickfadens&quot;. It appears that Strickfaden managed to secure the use of at least one Tesla Coil built by the inventor Nikola Tesla himself.

The film opened in New York City at the Mayfair Theatre on December 4, 1931, and grossed $53,000 in one week.

Florey and Lugosi were given the &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; (1932) project as a consolation. Lugosi would later go on to play Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster in &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man&quot; a decade later, when his career was in decline (in the original shooting script the Monster spoke, cancelling Lugosi&#x27;s initial objection to the part, but his filmed dialogue sequences were cut prior to release, along with the premise that the Monster was blind, which was the way Lugosi had played it).

==Pre-Code era scenes and censorship history==

The scene in which the Monster throws Maria, the little girl, into the lake and accidentally drowns her has long been controversial. Upon its original 1931 release, the second part of this scene was cut by state censorship boards in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New York. Those states also objected to a line they considered blasphemous that occurred during Frankenstein&#x27;s exuberance when he first learns that his creature is alive. The original relevant passage was:
VICTOR: &quot;Henry, in the name of God!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
HENRY: &quot;In the name of God? Now I know what it feels like to BE God!&quot;
Kansas requested the cutting of 32 scenes which, if they had been removed, would have cut half of the film. Jason Joy of the Studio Relations Committee sent censor representative Joseph Breen to urge them to reconsider. Eventually, an edited version was released in Kansas.

As with many pre-Code films that were reissued after strict enforcement of the Production Code in 1934, Universal made cuts from the original camera negative, and thus most of the excised footage is often lost. However, the scene of the girl being thrown into the lake was rediscovered during the early 1980s in the collection of the British National Film Archive, and it has been restored to modern prints of the film.

In the Irish Free State, the film was banned on February 5, 1932, for being demoralizing and unsuitable for children or &quot;nervous people&quot; – age-restricted certificates were not introduced in the country until 1965. The decision was overturned by the Appeal Board on March 8, and the film was passed uncut on March 9. The film was successfully banned in Northern Ireland, Quebec, Sweden, Italy, and Czechoslovakia.

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Mordaunt Hall gave &quot;Frankenstein&quot; a very positive review. He said that the film &quot;aroused so much excitement at the Mayfair yesterday that many in the audience laughed to cover their true feelings. [T]here is no denying that it is far and away the most effective thing of its kind. Beside it &quot;Dracula&quot; is tame and, incidentally, &quot;Dracula&quot; was produced by the same firm&quot;.

&quot;Film Daily&quot; also lauded the picture, calling it a &quot;gruesome, chill-producing and exciting drama&quot; that was &quot;produced intelligently and lavishly and with a grade of photography that is superb&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; reported that it &quot;looks like a &quot;Dracula&quot; plus, touching a new peak in horror plays&quot;, and described Karloff&#x27;s performance as &quot;a fascinating acting bit of mesmerism&quot;. Its review also singled out the look of the film as uniquely praiseworthy, calling the photography &quot;splendid&quot; and the lighting &quot;the last word in ingenuity, since much of the footage calls for dim or night effect and the manipulation of shadows to intensify the ghostly atmosphere&quot;.

John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was less enthused, calling the film only a &quot;moderate success&quot; and writing that &quot;the makeup department has a triumph to its credit in the monster and there lie the thrills of the picture, but the general fantasy lacks the vitality which that little Mrs. P.B. Shelley was able to give her book&quot;.

The film was banned in China due to falling under the category of &quot;superstitious films&quot; as a result of its &quot;strangeness&quot; and unscientific elements.

&quot;Frankenstein&quot; has continued to receive acclaim from critics and is widely regarded as one of the best films of 1931, as well as one of the greatest movies of all time. 

In 1991, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its &quot;Best 1000 Movies Ever&quot; list.

&quot;Frankenstein&quot; also received recognition from the American Film Institute. It was named the 87th greatest movie of all time on &quot;100 Years... 100 Movies&quot;. The line &quot;It&#x27;s alive! It&#x27;s alive!&quot; was ranked as the 49th greatest movie quote in American cinema. The film was on the ballot for several of AFI&#x27;s &quot;100 series&quot; lists, including AFI&#x27;s &quot;10 Top 10&quot; for the sci-fi category, &quot;100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)&quot;, and twice on &quot;100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains&quot; for both Henry Frankenstein and the Monster in the villains category.

The film was ranked number 56 on AFI&#x27;s &quot;100 Years... 100 Thrills&quot;, a list of America&#x27;s most heart-pounding movies. It was also ranked number 27 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot;. Additionally, the Chicago Film Critics Association named it the 14th scariest film ever made.

===Box office===
The film was a commercial success. In June 1932, the film had earned reported rentals of $1.4 million. In 1943, Universal reported it had earned a profit of $708,871. By 1953, all the Frankenstein re-releases earned an estimated profit of $12 million.

==Home media==
In 1986, MCA Home Video released &quot;Frankenstein&quot; on LaserDisc. This release restored all the cut footage, as well as most of Frankenstein&#x27;s &quot;In the name of God!&quot; line. In the 1990s, MCA/Universal Home Video released the film on VHS as part of the &quot;Universal Monsters Classic Collection&quot;, a series of releases of Universal Classic Monsters films.

In 1999, Universal released &quot;Frankenstein&quot; on VHS and DVD as part of the &quot;Classic Monster Collection&quot;; this release restored the rest of the censored material. In April 2004, Universal released &quot;Frankenstein: The Legacy Collection&quot; on DVD as part of the &quot;Universal Legacy Collection&quot;. This two-disc release includes &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;The Ghost of Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;The House of Frankenstein&quot;. In September 2006, Universal released &quot;Frankenstein&quot; on DVD as a two-disc &quot;75th Anniversary Edition&quot;, as part of the &quot;Universal Legacy Series&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; was released on Blu-ray as part of the &quot;Universal Classic Monsters: The Essential Collection&quot; box set, which also includes a total of nine films from the Universal Classic Monsters series. In September 2013, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; received a standalone Blu-ray release. That same year, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; was included as part of the six-film Blu-ray set &quot;Universal Classic Monsters Collection&quot;, which also includes &quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&quot;, &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, and &quot;The Wolf Man&quot;. The next year, Universal released &quot;Frankenstein: Complete Legacy Collection&quot; on DVD. This set contains eight films: &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Ghost of Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man&quot;, &quot;The House of Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;House of Dracula&quot;, and &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot;. In 2015, the six-film &quot;Universal Classic Monsters Collection&quot; was released on DVD. In 2016, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; received a Walmart-exclusive Blu-ray release featuring a glow-in-the-dark cover. That same year, the &quot;Complete Legacy Collection&quot; was released on Blu-ray. In September 2017, the film received a Best Buy-exclusive SteelBook Blu-ray release with cover artwork by Alex Ross.

&quot;Frankenstein&quot; and its sequels were included in the &quot;Universal Classic Monsters: Complete 30-Film Collection&quot; Blu-ray box set in August 2018. This box set also received a DVD release. Later in October, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; was included as part of a limited edition Best Buy-exclusive Blu-ray set titled &quot;Universal Classic Monsters: The Essential Collection&quot;, which features artwork by Alex Ross. Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released the film on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 5, 2021.

==Sequels==



&quot;Frankenstein&quot; was followed by a string of sequels, beginning with &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935), in which Elsa Lanchester plays the Monster&#x27;s bride.

The next sequel, &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot; (1939), was made, like all those that followed, without Whale or Clive (the latter of whom had died in 1937). This film featured Karloff&#x27;s last full film performance as the Monster. &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot; presented Basil Rathbone as Baron Wolf von Frankenstein, Bela Lugosi as bearded hunchback Ygor, and Lionel Atwill as Inspector Krogh.

&quot;The Ghost of Frankenstein&quot; was released in 1942. The film features Lon Chaney Jr. as the Monster, taking over from Boris Karloff, who played the role in the first three films of the series, and Bela Lugosi in his second appearance as the demented Ygor.

The fifth installment, &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man,&quot; was released in 1943, directed by Roy William Neill and starring Bela Lugosi as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster. This is also the sequel to &quot;The Wolf Man&quot;, with Lon Chaney Jr. returning as the Wolf Man.

In the follow-up, &quot;House of Frankenstein&quot; (1944), Karloff returned to the series, but not to reprise his role as the monster but as the Mad Doctor; the monster was this time portrayed by Glenn Strange. Chaney Jr. returned as the Wolf Man. Dracula was also featured in the film, played by John Carradine.

Its sequel, &quot;House of Dracula&quot; (1945), featured the same three monsters—Dracula, Frankenstein&#x27;s monster and the Wolf Man—with the same cast in their portrayals.

Many of the subsequent films which featured Frankenstein&#x27;s monster demote the creature to a robotic henchman in someone else&#x27;s plots, such as in its final Universal film appearance in the deliberately farcical &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot; (1948) as well as the aforementioned &quot;House of Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;House of Dracula&quot;.

==Other adaptations==

* Karloff would return to the wearing of the makeup and to the role of the monster one last time in a 1962 episode of the television show &quot;Route 66&quot;.
* The popular 1960s television sitcom, &quot;The Munsters&quot;, depicts the family&#x27;s father Herman as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, who married Count Dracula&#x27;s daughter. The makeup for Herman is based on the makeup of Boris Karloff.
* Frankenstein appears in &quot;Mad Monster Party?&quot; (1967), a Rankin/Bass Productions Halloween special, where Dr. Boris von Frankenstein (voiced by Karloff) invites various classic monsters to a reunion at his castle with intentions to announce his retirement and to name his successor.
* Mel Brooks&#x27; comedy &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; (1974) parodied elements of the first three Universal &quot;Frankenstein&quot; films, while also using the original props built for the 1935 film, provided by their designer Kenneth Strickfaden. Brooks also recreated the movie into a 2007 Broadway musical of the same name.
* A live-action parody short film, &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; (1984), depicting Victor Frankenstein as a modern American boy and his deceased pet dog as the monster, was made by Tim Burton in 1984. Burton remade it as a full-length animated film in 2012.

===Frankenstein&#x27;s assistant===
Although Frankenstein&#x27;s hunchbacked assistant is often referred to as &quot;Igor&quot; in descriptions of the films, he is not so called in the earliest films. In both &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, Frankenstein has an assistant, who is played both times by Dwight Frye, who is disabled. In the original 1931 film the character is named &quot;Fritz&quot;; he is hunchbacked and walks with the aid of a small cane. Fritz did not originate from the &quot;Frankenstein&quot; novel, and instead originated from the earliest recorded play adaptation, &quot;Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein&quot;, where he was played by Robert Keeley.

In &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, Frye plays &quot;Karl&quot;, a murderer who stands upright but has a lumbering metal brace on both legs that can be heard clicking loudly with every step. Both characters would be killed by Karloff&#x27;s monster in their respective films. Frye also appears in later films in the series, such as in &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man&quot; (1943).

The genesis of the scene in which Frankenstein&#x27;s assistant Fritz drops a jar labeled &quot;normal brain&quot; and replaces it with a brain in a jar labeled &quot;abnormal brain&quot; is believed to be based on the fate of Walt Whitman&#x27;s brain at the American Anthropometric Society. Whitman had donated his brain after his death to the society for analysis to correlate intelligence with brain size. A 1907 paper by Edward Anthony Spitzka on the society&#x27;s brain collection caused a minor sensation when it revealed that Whitman&#x27;s brain had been accidentally destroyed when a &quot;careless assistant&quot; dropped the jar it was stored in. This story element was not present in the original 1818 Mary Shelley novel.

It was not until &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot; (1939) that a character called &quot;Ygor&quot; first appears, here played by Bela Lugosi and revived by Lugosi in &quot;The Ghost of Frankenstein&quot; (1942) after his apparent murder in the earlier film. This character – a deranged blacksmith whose neck was broken and twisted due to a botched hanging – befriends the monster and later helps Dr. Wolf Frankenstein, leading to the &quot;hunchbacked assistant&quot; called &quot;Igor&quot; commonly associated with &quot;Frankenstein&quot; in popular culture. Regarding &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot;, the film&#x27;s director Rowland V. Lee said his crew let Lugosi &quot;work on the characterization; the interpretation he gave us was imaginative and totally unexpected ... when we finished shooting, there was no doubt in anyone&#x27;s mind that he stole the show. Karloff&#x27;s monster was weak by comparison&quot;.

==Reboot==
In June 2017, producer/director Alex Kurtzman revealed that Universal Studios was developing a new version of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; as an installment in its shared universe of classic movie monsters, to be known as the &quot;Dark Universe&quot;. Javier Bardem was cast to portray the titular character. Although the idea of a shared universe was later shelved, following the failure of 2017&#x27;s &quot;The Mummy&quot; at the box-office, Universal continued to move forward with reboots of its classic horror films. By November 2019, James Wan was announced to serve as producer on a reboot of the &quot;Frankenstein&quot; film series. Jason Blum expressed interest in joining the production in a producing role. In March 2020, Robbie Thompson was hired to serve as screenwriter, with the plot revolving around a group of teenagers who discover that a neighbor is creating a monster in their basement. The project will be a joint production between Universal Pictures and Wan&#x27;s Atomic Monster.

<doc id="73490" wikidata="Q7309216" url="?curid=73490" title="Regional handwriting variation">
<text>Although people in many parts of the world share common alphabets and numeral systems (versions of the Latin writing system are used throughout the Americas, Australia, and much of Europe and Africa; the Arabic numerals are nearly universal), styles of handwritten letterforms vary between individuals, and sometimes also vary systematically between regions.

== Arabic numerals ==
The handwritten numerals used in Western countries have two common forms:

* &quot;In-line&quot; or &quot;full-height&quot; form is similar to that used on typewriters and is taught in North America; in this form all numerals have the same height as the majuscule alphabet (&quot;i.e.&quot; the capital letters).
* In &quot;old style&quot; text figures, numerals &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; are x-height; numerals &quot;6&quot; and &quot;8&quot; have bowls within x-height, plus ascenders; numerals &quot;3&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;7&quot; and &quot;9&quot; have descenders from x-height, with &quot;3&quot; resembling ; and the numeral &quot;4&quot; extends a short distance both up and down from x-height. Old-style numerals are often used by British presses.

Aside from these two main forms, other regional variations abound.

The numeral 0: Some writers put a diagonal slash through the numeral 0 (zero), a practice that was used on some early, low-resolution computer terminals which displayed a slashed &quot;zero&quot; glyph to distinguish it from the capital letter &quot;O&quot;. This practice conflicts with the use of the letter &quot;Ø&quot; in the Danish and Norwegian languages. Forms that avoid this confusion include: 
* a dot placed in the centre of zero
* the use of a tick, that is, a slash that does not cross the entire bowl of the figure, but lies completely in the upper right
* a form found in Germany with a vertical slash
* a form with a slash from upper left to lower right.

Confusion between the numeral 0 and the letter O can also be resolved by using a script letter O (with a loop at the top).
The numeral 1: This numeral is sometimes written with a serif at the top extending downward and to the left. People in some parts of Europe extend this stroke nearly the whole distance to the baseline. It is sometimes written with a horizontal serif at the base; without the serif it can resemble the shape of the numeral &quot;7&quot;, which has a near-vertical stroke without a crossbar, and a shorter horizontal top stroke. This numeral is often written as a plain vertical line without an ear at the top; this form is easily confused with a capital I, a lower-case L, and a vertical bar |.

The numeral 2: In the U.S., Germany and Austria, a curly version used to be taught and is still used by many in handwriting. This too can be confused with a capital script Q, or the letter Z. It appears as ੨.

The numeral 3: This numeral is sometimes written with a flat top, similar to the character Ʒ (ezh). This form is sometimes used to prevent people from fraudulently changing a three into an eight (but introduces the potential for confusion with ezh or with cursive Z).
The numeral 4: Some people leave the top &quot;open&quot;: all the lines are either vertical or horizontal, as in a seven-segment display. This makes it easier to distinguish from the numeral &quot;9&quot;. Whether the horizontal bar terminates at or crosses the right vertical bar is insignificant in the West, but to be distinguished from certain Chinese characters (particularly ), it must cross.

The numeral 5: In Taiwan, the left vertical bar is extended upwards as a long stem. If this is slanted, the overall figure may more closely resemble an uppercase &quot;Y&quot;. If casually written it can be confused with the letter S.

The numeral 6: Can be confused with a letter capital &quot;G&quot;, or the lowercase &quot;b&quot;, or the nine if inverted. In situations where the number 6 may appear at various angles (such as on billiard balls, some styles of playing cards and dice), it can be underlined (appearing as &quot;6&quot;) or followed by a full stop (appearing as &quot;6.&quot;) to indicate the proper viewing angle to disambiguate between &quot;6&quot; and &quot;9&quot;; a &quot;9&quot; may or may not appear with similar underlining or full stop (as &quot;9&quot; or &quot;9.&quot;). It can also be written with a straight line rather than a right-curling ascender on top, appearing as &quot;b&quot;.

The numeral 7: The traditional form found in copperplate penmanship begins with a serif at the upper left and has a wavy horizontal stroke (like a swash). In East Asian countries (Korea, China and Japan), this numeral is commonly written with such a serif, but no swash and no crossbar through the middle. It is usually written with just two strokes, the top horizontal and the (usually angled) vertical. A short horizontal bar is sometimes used to cross the vertical in the middle, to distinguish the seven from a numeral one, especially in cultures (such as French) that write &quot;1&quot; with a very long upstroke. This form is used commonly throughout continental Europe, parts of the United States and frequently in Australia. In Taiwan two horizontal bars are sometimes used, although an extra-long serif is the feature which most clearly distinguishes &quot;7&quot; from &quot;1&quot;. When the cross is added in the center it can cause confusion with a script capital &quot;F&quot;.

The numeral 8: Some people write this numeral like two circles. Other people write this numeral in one continuous motion, which makes it look like two tear drops or a sideways lemniscate.

The numeral 9: In parts of Europe, this numeral is written with the vertical ending in a hook at the bottom. This version resembles how the lowercase codice_1 is commonly written (). Elsewhere the usual shape is to draw the vertical straight to the baseline. A nine may or may not appear with underlining or full stop (as &quot;9&quot; or &quot;9.&quot;) in order to avoid confusion with &quot;6&quot;. In China, southern Taiwan, and South Korea, the nine is sometimes written with the loop to the right of the stick, resembling a capital &quot;P&quot; or Greek lowercase letter ρ.

==The Latin writing system==
The lowercase letter a: This letter is often handwritten as the single-storey &quot;ɑ&quot; (a circle and a vertical line adjacent to the right of the circle) instead of the double-storey &quot;a&quot; found in many fonts. (See: A#Typographic variants)

The lowercase letter g: In Polish, this letter is often rendered with a straight descender without a hook or loop. This effectively means that a handwritten g looks much like a q in other writing traditions. The letter q, which is only used in foreign words and is extremely rare, is then disambiguated from g by adding a serif (often undulated) extending to the right from the bottom tip of the descender.

The lowercase letter p: The French way of writing this character has a half-way ascender as the vertical extension of the descender, which also does not complete the bowl at the bottom. In early Finnish writing, the curve to the bottom was omitted, thus the resulting letter resembled an &quot;n&quot; with a descender (like ꞃ).

The lowercase letter q: In block letters, some Europeans like to cross the descender to prevent confusion with the numeral &quot;9&quot;, which also can be written with a straight stem. In North America the descender often ends with a hook curving up to the right (). In Polish, the lowercase q is disambiguated from &quot;g&quot; by a serif extending from the bottom tip of the descender to the right.

The lowercase letter s: See long s.

The lowercase letters u and v: These letters have a common origin and were once written according to the location in the word rather than the sound. The v came first; the u originally had a loop extending to the left and was only used to start words. All other locations for either u or v were written with the latter. In Germany (especially southern Germany), Austria and Switzerland, lowercase u is often written with a horizontal stroke or swish over it (&quot;ŭ&quot;, &quot;ū&quot;, &quot;ũ&quot;), to distinguish it from n. (cf. German orthography#handwritten umlauts)

The uppercase letter I: This letter is often written with one stroke on the top of the letter and one on the bottom. This distinguishes it from the lowercase letter l, and the numeral 1, which is often written as a straight line without the ear.

The uppercase letter J: In Germany, this letter is often written with a long stroke to the left at the top. This is to distinguish it from the capital letter &quot;I&quot;.

The uppercase letter S: In Japan, this letter is often written with a single serif added to the end of the stroke.

The uppercase letter Z: This letter is usually written with three strokes. In parts of Europe such as Italy, Germany and Spain, it is commonly written with a short horizontal crossbar added through the middle. This version is sometimes preferred in mathematics to help distinguish it from the numeral &quot;2&quot;. In Polish, the character Ƶ is used as an allographic variant of the letter Ż. In Japan it is often written with a short diagonal crossbar through the middle (). In France, it is often written with a loop at the bottom.

The lowercase letter z: In the cursive style used in the United States and most Australian states (excluding South Australia), this letter is written as an ezh (ʒ).
The parts of Europe that add a crossbar to the uppercase may also use it the lowercase version.

== and script==
German and its modernized 20th-century school version , the form of handwriting taught in schools and generally used in Germany and Austria until it was banned by the Nazis in 1941, was very different from that used in other European countries. However, it was generally only used for German words. Any foreign words included in the text would usually be written in the &quot;normal&quot; script, which was called the (Latin script) in German.

==Slant==

Slant is the predominant angle of the downward stroke in handwriting based on Latin script. The slant of a sample of writing is a feature of many regional handwriting variations, and also a reflection of the copybook that is taught.

<doc id="73494" wikidata="Q1133723" url="?curid=73494" title="Freaks (1932 film)">
<text>Freaks (also re-released as The Monster Story, Forbidden Love, and Nature&#x27;s Mistakes) is a 1932 American pre-Code drama horror film produced and directed by Tod Browning, starring Wallace Ford, Leila Hyams, Olga Baclanova, and Roscoe Ates.

&quot;Freaks&quot;, originally intended as a vehicle for Lon Chaney, is set amongst the backdrop of a travelling French circus and follows a conniving trapeze artist who joins a group of carnival sideshow performers with a plan to seduce and murder a midget in the troupe to gain his inheritance. However, her plot proves to have dangerous consequences. The film is based on elements from the short story &quot;Spurs&quot; by Tod Robbins, first published in &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in February 1923, with the rights being purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Cedric Gibbons, a childhood friend of Robbins and MGM art department chief, was responsible for the purchase.

Filmed in Los Angeles in the fall of 1931, some employees at MGM were discomforted by the presence of the actors portraying the &quot;freaks&quot; on set, and, other than the so-called more normal looking &quot;freaks&quot;, the Siamese twins and the Earles, the performers were not allowed to be on the studio lot, relegated instead to a specially-built tent. The film had test screenings in January 1932, with many members of the audience reacting negatively, finding the film too grotesque. In response to this, MGM executive Irving Thalberg, without consent of director Browning, edited the original 90-minute feature, which was significantly cut, with additional alternate footage incorporated to help increase the running time. The final abridged cut of the film, released in February 1932, was 64 minutes; the original version no longer exists.
&quot;Freaks&quot; made its world premiere at the Fox Theatre in San Diego, shown in full, without the subsequent cuts from January 28 and had a successful run. The theatre advertised the fact that it was the only place where the movie could be seen in the &quot;original uncensored version&quot;.

Despite the cuts made to the film, &quot;Freaks&quot; still garnered notice for the portrayal of its eponymous characters by people who worked as sideshow performers and had real disabilities. These cast members included midget siblings Harry and Daisy Earles; Johnny Eck, who had sacral agenesis; the conjoined twin sisters Daisy and Violet Hilton; and Schlitzie, a man with microcephaly. Because of its controversial content, the film was banned in the United Kingdom for over 30 years, and was labelled as &quot;brutal and grotesque&quot; in Canada.

Though it received critical backlash and was a box-office failure upon initial release, &quot;Freaks&quot; was subject to public and critical reappraisal in the 1960s, as a long forgotten Hollywood classic, particularly in Europe, and was screened at the 1962 Venice Film Festival. In retrospect, numerous film critics have suggested that the film presents a starkly sympathetic portrait of its sideshow characters rather than an exploitative one, with Andrew Sarris declaring &quot;Freaks&quot; one of the &quot;most compassionate&quot; films ever made. Nonetheless, critics have continued to take note of the film&#x27;s horror elements; in 2009, Joe Morgenstern proclaimed that &quot;Freaks&quot; contains some of the most terrifying scenes in film history. Film scholars have interpreted the film as a metaphor for class conflict, reflecting the Great Depression, and it has been studied for its portrayal of people with disabilities, with theorists arguing that it presents an anti-eugenics message. The film has been highly influential, has become a cult classic, and, in 1994, was selected for preservation by the United States National Film Registry, which seeks to preserve films that are &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
A beautiful and conniving trapeze artist named Cleopatra seduces a carnival sideshow dwarf named Hans after learning of his large inheritance. This is much to the chagrin of Frieda, his fiancée, also a dwarf. Cleopatra also conspires with circus strongman Hercules to kill Hans so she will inherit his wealth. Meanwhile, other romances flourish among the sideshow performers: the Bearded Lady, who is in love with the Human Skeleton, gives birth to their daughter. The news is spread among the friends by the Stork Woman. Additionally, Violet, a conjoined twin whose sister Daisy is married to Roscoe, the stuttering circus clown, becomes engaged to the circus&#x27;s owner.

Hans, enamored of Cleopatra, ultimately marries her. At their wedding, Cleopatra begins poisoning Hans&#x27;s wine but drunkenly kisses Hercules in front of Hans, revealing her affair. Oblivious, the other &quot;freaks&quot; announce that they accept Cleopatra in spite of her being a &quot;normal&quot; outsider; they hold an initiation ceremony in which they pass a loving cup around the table while chanting, &quot;We accept her, one of us. We accept her, one of us. Gooble-gobble, gooble-gobble.&quot; However, Cleopatra&#x27;s mean-spirited amusement at this ceremony soon turns into fear and anger after Hercules jokes that the rest of the entertainers plan to turn her into one of them. She mocks them, tosses the wine in their faces and drives them away before berating Hans and drunkenly parading him around on her shoulders like a child. The humiliated Hans realizes that he has been played for a fool and rejects Cleopatra&#x27;s attempts to apologize, but then he falls ill from the poison. While bedridden, Hans &quot;apologizes&quot; to Cleopatra and also &quot;takes&quot; the poisoned medicine that she is giving him, but he secretly plots with the other entertainers to strike back at Cleopatra and Hercules.

In the film&#x27;s climax, Hans confronts Cleopatra with three of the entertainers as backup thugs. However, Hans&#x27;s circus wagon is overturned in a storm, giving Cleopatra the chance to escape into the forest, closely pursued by them. At the same time Hercules goes to kill sea lion trainer Venus for knowing about the plot. Venus&#x27;s boyfriend, Phroso the clown, attempts to stop Hercules but is nearly killed before the rest of them intervene and injure Hercules, saving Phroso. They all pursue an injured Hercules.

The freaks then capture Cleopatra and sometime later, she is shown to be a grotesque, squawking &quot;human duck&quot; on display for carnival patrons; her tongue has been removed, one eye has been gouged out, the flesh of her hands has been melted and deformed to look like duck feet, her legs have been cut off, and what is left of her torso has been permanently tarred and feathered. In the original version of the film, it is revealed that after the freaks caught Hercules, they made him into a castrato singer.

While some versions end on Cleopatra as the human duck, another ending shows Hans, now living in a mansion from his inheritance and still humiliated, visited by Phroso, Venus and Frieda. Frieda tells Hans she knows he just wanted to demand the bottle of poison from Cleopatra, not to mutilate her, and not to blame himself for what happened; and that she still loves him. The two then share a heartwarming hug.

==Analysis and themes==
===Class conflict===
Film critic Melvin Matthews has interpreted &quot;Freaks&quot; within the context of the Great Depression, writing that it &quot;is essentially a story of the little people (average Americans) versus the big people (the rich and businessmen). The film makes it clear that the big people, personified by Cleopatra and Hercules, scorn the Freaks. Such a disdainful attitude was reflected in the real-life social outlook of some business tycoons during the Depression.&quot; Film studies academic Jennifer Peterson similarly identifies &quot;Freaks&quot; as an example of an &quot;outsider film&quot;. Historian Jane Nicholas suggests that the film&#x27;s conclusion, in which the circus performers mutilate Cleopatra whilst chanting &quot;one of us&quot;, is reinforcing the freaks&#x27; social currency: &quot;It is interesting that a statement that reads as one of inclusion is often cited as one that embodies horror in the film. What does it mean to be &#x27;one of us&#x27;? The chilling horror of the chant &#x27;one of us&#x27; reveals why the freak show persists.&quot;

In the book &quot;Midnight Movies&quot; (1991), critics J. Hoberman and Jonathan Rosenbaum compare &quot;Freaks&quot; to &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot;, writing that the former is &quot;almost literally dealing with the same thing [class disparity]... but more directly—because the end product isn&#x27;t just putting on a show, but slaves breaking their chains and triumphing over their masters. &quot;Freaks&quot; is asking a Depression audience to identify not with the Beautiful People, but with sideshow mutations, a total underclass.&quot;

John Stanley, longtime publisher of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, describes the film as &quot;A Classic of the Grotesque&quot; in &quot;Creature Features&quot;.

===Disability and eugenics===

The film&#x27;s depiction of people with disabilities has been a significant point of analysis amongst film critics and scholars. In his book &quot;Subversive Horror Cinema: Countercultural Messages of Films from Frankenstein to the Present&quot; (2014), critic Jon Towlson proposes that &quot;Freaks&quot; exemplifies an anti-eugenics sentiment. In presenting this idea, Towlson cites vignette sequences that make up the beginning of the film, largely consisting of the freaks in the context of their sideshow, before Browning &quot;begins to undercut the voyeuristic aspects of the traditional freakshow by showing the freaks engaged in the activities of everyday life, dispelling the initial shock and revulsion, and encouraging the viewer to see the freaks as individuals who have overcome their disabilities.&quot;

Towlson also notes that the freaks&#x27; everyday interactions with the able-bodied sideshow performers, such as Phroso, Roscoe, and Venus, who treat the freaks as equals and friends, further blurs the distinction between the able-bodied and disabled members of the circus, and that the physically beautiful characters—such as trapeze artist Cleopatra—are the ones who are vindictive, supremacist, and immoral. He further argues that the implied sexuality in the film—such as the implication that the conjoined twin sisters (played by Daisy and Violet Hilton) carry on their own separate sex lives—is an affront to the eugenic stance against reproduction and sexual activity among the &quot;physically unfit.&quot; Towlson ultimately concludes that this subversion of character exemplifies a stark opposition to the core belief of eugenics, which is that physical appearance is equated with internal worth.

Angela Smith, a scholar of film and disability, similarly notes that &quot;Freaks&quot; presents numerous scenes in which the freaks engage in routine and ordinary domestic behavior. Among them, Smith cites the freaks&#x27; celebration of the birth of the Bearded Lady&#x27;s baby, and the film&#x27;s key dinner party sequence in which Cleopatra grows enraged when the freaks sing &quot;We accept her, we accept her, one of us, one of us&quot; as a welcoming song. Film scholars Martin Norden and Madeleine Cahill, however, question Browning&#x27;s intention of the film&#x27;s final revenge sequence, in which the freaks mutilate the able-bodied, morally cruel Cleopatra. &quot;The implications of the violence against [Cleopatra] are far from clear,&quot; they write. &quot;Members of a traditionally disempowered minority use their collective force to disempower a majority member—turn her into one of them, in effect—leading us to wonder if she is truly disempowered or empowered in a new way. Browning&#x27;s ambiguity on this point only enhances the film&#x27;s unsettling properties.&quot;

===Status as a horror film===
Some critics, such as John Thomas and Raymond Durgnat, have noted that &quot;Freaks&quot; does not fully embody the genre. Thomas wrote in &quot;Film Quarterly&quot; that &quot;Freaks&quot; would &quot;disappoint no one but the mindless children who consume most horror films... Certainly it is macabre... But the point is that &quot;Freaks&quot; is not really a horror film at all, though it contains some horrifying sequences.&quot; Durgnat made a similar observation, writing that, like the films of Luis Buñuel, its shock value &quot;mingles with moments which seem shallow, but by the end of the film one begins to catch their mood, a calm, cold combination of guignol and eerily matter-of-fact.&quot;

Film-studies scholar Joan Hawkins describes the evolution of how the film&#x27;s genre was perceived, noting that it &quot;started as a mainstream horror film that migrated into the exploitation arena before finally being recuperated as an avant-garde or art project.&quot; Hawkins notes that Browning inverts the audience&#x27;s expectations, demonstrating that it is &quot;the ordinary, the apparently normal, the beautiful which horrify—the monstrous and distorted which compel our respect, our sympathy, ultimately our affection.&quot; Smith writes that the inclusion of &quot;Freaks&quot; within the horror genre &quot;forces our reconsideration of the genre&#x27;s status [and] challenges readings in which all horror movies are seen to use monstrous bodies to the same effects.&quot; Film theorist Eugenie Brinkema suggests that &quot;Freaks&quot; functions as a horror film &quot;not because Cleo is mutilated and Hercules killed, all lightning and dark shadows—no, &quot;Freaks&quot; is a horror film because the gaze itself is horrific, because locating the gaze is a work in terror.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) had purchased the rights to Tod Robbins&#x27;s short story &quot;Spurs&quot; in the mid-1920s at Tod Browning&#x27;s urging for a reported $8,000. Harry Earles, a dwarf who had appeared in Browning&#x27;s &quot;The Unholy Three&quot; (1925)—and who would ultimately star as Hans in &quot;Freaks&quot;—had originally proposed the idea of making a film version of &quot;Spurs&quot; to Browning. The studio agreed to hire Browning to direct the project based on his past success at Universal Pictures with &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931) and for his collaborations with Lon Chaney.

In June 1931, MGM production supervisor Irving Thalberg offered Browning the opportunity to direct &quot;Arsène Lupin&quot; with John Barrymore. Browning declined, preferring to develop &quot;Freaks&quot;, a project he had started as early as 1927; Browning had worked with a traveling carnival prior to becoming a filmmaker. Screenwriters Willis Goldbeck and Elliott Clawson were assigned to the project at Browning&#x27;s request. Leon Gordon, Edgar Allan Woolf, Al Boasberg and an uncredited Charles MacArthur would also contribute to the script. The script was shaped over five months. Little of the original story was retained beyond the marriage between a dwarf and an average-sized woman and their wedding feast, and the setting—originally France—was relocated to the United States. Both Thalberg and Harry Rapf served as uncredited co-producers on the film.

===Casting===

Victor McLaglen was considered for the role of Hercules, while Myrna Loy was initially slated to star as Cleopatra, with Jean Harlow as Venus. Ultimately, Thalberg decided not to cast any major stars in the picture. Instead, Russian actress Olga Baclanova was cast as Cleopatra, based on her success in a Los Angeles-produced stage production of &quot;The Silent Witness&quot;.

Harry Earles was cast as Hans, the carnival sideshow performer whom Cleopatra attempts to murder for his estate. Earles&#x27; real-life sister, Daisy, portrayed his dwarf love interest, Frieda.

Among the supporting characters featured as &quot;freaks&quot;, casting agent Ben Piazza scoured the East Coast for over a month and put out advertisements for photographs and screen tests, scouting carnivals and sideshows for Browning; amongst others, a girl with &quot;Elephant skin&quot;, &quot;a boy with dog legs&quot;, &quot;a giant&quot;, &quot;a bunch of pygmies&quot; and the legendary dwarf performer &quot;Mega Mite&quot; didn&#x27;t make the cut. The cast that would included Peter Robinson (&quot;The Human Skeleton&quot;); Olga Roderick (&quot;The Bearded Lady&quot;); Frances O&#x27;Connor and Martha Morris (&quot;armless wonders&quot;); and the conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton. Among the microcephalic characters who appear in the film (and are referred to as &quot;pinheads&quot; throughout) were Zip and Pip (Elvira and Jenny Lee Snow) and Schlitzie, a man named Simon Metz who wore a dress.

Also featured were the intersex Josephine Joseph, with her left-right divided gender; Johnny Eck, the legless man, who was scouted for the role while performing in Montreal; the completely limbless Prince Randian (also known as The Human Torso and miscredited as &quot;Rardion&quot;); Elizabeth Green the Stork Woman; and Koo-Koo the Bird Girl, who had Virchow–Seckel syndrome or bird-headed dwarfism and is most remembered for the scene wherein she dances on the table.

===Filming===
&quot;Freaks&quot; began principal photography in November 1931, with a 24-day shooting schedule. At the time of the production&#x27;s beginning, the film had a budget of approximately $209,000, though it would eventually expand to more than $300,000. The film was shot on the MGM studio lot in Culver City, California. Baclanova recalled her time first meeting her co-stars on the set:

During the shoot, the film had already begun to draw disgusted reactions, resulting in MGM segregating the film&#x27;s cast and crew to a separate cafeteria so that &quot;people could get to eat in the commissary without throwing up.&quot; Filming was completed on December 16, 1931, and Browning began retakes on December 23.

==Release==
===Censorship===
In January 1932, MGM held test screenings of the film, which proved disastrous: Art director Merrill Pye recalled that &quot;Halfway through the preview, a lot of people got up and ran out. They didn&#x27;t walk out. They &quot;ran&quot; out.&quot; Others reportedly became ill, or fainted; one woman who attended the screening threatened to sue MGM, claiming the film had caused her to suffer a miscarriage. Due to the extremely unfavorable response, the studio cut the picture down from its original 90-minute running time to just over an hour. Much of the sequence of the circus entertainers attacking Cleopatra as she lies under a lightning-struck tree was removed, as well as a sequence showing Hercules being castrated and made into a castrato, a number of comedy sequences, and most of the film&#x27;s original epilogue, which included Hercules singing in a falsetto (a reference to his castration) with Cleopatra quacking along. These excised sequences are considered lost. In order to pad the running time after these cuts, a new prologue featuring a carnival barker was added, as was the alternate epilogue featuring the reconciliation of the dwarf lovers.

The truncated version—now only 64 minutes long—had its premiere at the Fox Criterion in Los Angeles on February 12, 1932. It subsequently opened in New York City that summer, premiering on July 8, 1932. Regionally, the film attracted controversy upon its theatrical release, and was pulled from screenings in Atlanta. In the United Kingdom, the film was banned by the British censors, and remained as so for more than 30 years before being passed with an X rating in August 1963.

===Box office===

&quot;Freaks&quot; was a box-office bomb, recording a total loss of $164,000. It grossed $289,000 in the United States, and $52,000 internationally. Though not a financial success, the film had greater earnings in smaller cities such as Cincinnati, Boston, and Saint Paul than it did in larger metropolitan cities such as Los Angeles or Chicago.

===Critical response===
====Contemporaneous====
Despite the extensive cuts, the film was still negatively received by moviegoers, and remained an object of extreme controversy amongst the public upon initial release. Critics&#x27; responses were also divided. MGM attempted to address criticisms of exploitation by promoting the film as one compassionate toward its subjects, with tagline such as &quot;What about abnormal people? They have their lives, too!&quot; At the time of its release, the film was regarded by numerous critics as marking the end of Browning&#x27;s career. &quot;Freaks&quot; became the only MGM film ever to be pulled from release before completing its domestic engagements, and it was pulled from distribution after its New York engagements concluded in the summer of 1932. Disillusioned by the backlash the film received, MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer sold the distribution rights to Dwain Esper for a 25-year period for $50,000.

A number of reviews were not only highly critical of the film, but expressed outrage and revulsion. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote that &quot;Any one who considers this entertainment should be placed in the pathological ward in some hospital.&quot; In &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot;, John C. Moffitt wrote, &quot;There is no excuse for this picture. It took a weak mind to produce it and it takes a strong stomach to look at it.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called the film an &quot;outrageous onslaught upon the feelings, the senses, the brains and the stomachs of an audience.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; also published an unfavorable review, writing that the film was &quot;sumptuously produced, admirably directed, and no cost was spared, but Metro heads failed to realize that even with a different sort of offering the story is still important. Here the story is not sufficiently strong to get and hold the interest, partly because interest cannot easily be gained for too fantastic a romance.&quot; The review went on to state that the story &quot;does not thrill and at the same time does not please, since it is impossible for the normal man or woman to sympathize with the aspiring dwarf. And only in such a case will the story appeal.&quot;

While a significant number of reviews were unfavorable, the film was well-received by some: &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;excellent at times and horrible, in the strict meaning of the word, at others&quot; as well as &quot;a picture not to be easily forgotten.&quot; The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; wrote that it was &quot;obviously an unhealthy and generally disagreeable work,&quot; but that &quot;in some strange way, the picture is not only exciting, but even occasionally touching.&quot; Columnist Louella Parsons wrote an enthusiastic report on the film, noting that &quot;for pure sensationalism, &quot;Freaks&quot; tops any pictures yet produced...  In &quot;Freaks&quot; there are monstrosities such as never before have been known. If you are normal go and see them for yourself, if not, well, use your own judgment.&quot;

John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote a favorable review, calling it &quot;a little gem&quot; that &quot;stands in a class by itself, and probably won&#x27;t be forgotten in a hurry by those who see it.&quot; He found its &quot;perfectly plausible story&quot; a key to the effectiveness of its horror, writing that &quot;It&#x27;s a chilling notion to imagine these weird beings, with their own lives and vanities and passions, all allied in a bitter enmity against us.&quot; Addressing the controversial subject matter, Mosher stated: &quot;if the poor things themselves can be displayed in the basement of Madison Square Garden, pictures of them might as well be shown in the Rialto. They may hereafter even be regarded in the flesh with a new dread bordering on respect.&quot;

====Retrospective====

In the mid/late 20th century, &quot;Freaks&quot; began to garner critical reassessment after developing a cult following in Europe, and was subject to renewed praise by critics and audiences. The film&#x27;s growing popularity abroad led to a renewed interest in it among American audiences, and it was subject of a retrospective review in &quot;Film Quarterly&quot; by John Thomas in 1964, in which he deemed it &quot;a minor masterpiece.&quot;

Critic Kim Newman suggests that the film&#x27;s warmer reception amongst mid/late-20th-century audiences was partly due to the term &quot;freak&quot; having taken on a more positive connotation, as something to be celebrated rather than reviled; Newman also adds that the film &quot;shows obvious fondness for its carny cast.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″s Mark Chalon Smith declared in a 1995 retrospective review: &quot;&quot;Freaks&quot; is a wild ride, but it&#x27;s not the monster-trip some say it is. It is macabre and disturbing, but Browning chose to humanize the deformed characters at the movie&#x27;s shadowy center, not to demonize them.&quot; Nonetheless, the film has still been noted for its stark horror imagery in the 21st century, with Joe Morgenstern writing in 2009 that it boasts &quot;some of the most terrifying scenes ever consigned to film.&quot; Jamie Russell of the BBC similarly observed in 2002: &quot;It&#x27;s easy to see why reactions to the film have been so strong—it&#x27;s a catalogue of the abnormal, the bizarre, and the grotesque that&#x27;s still as unsettling today as it was 70 years ago.&quot;

Film critic Mark Kermode awarded the film four out of five stars in a 2015 review, noting that, &quot;today, Browning&#x27;s sympathies are clear; if there are &#x27;freaks&#x27; on display here, they are not the versatile performers to whom the title seems to allude.&quot; Film theorist and critic Andrew Sarris echoed this sentiment, proclaiming &quot;Freaks&quot; &quot;one of the most compassionate films ever made.&quot; Ed Gonzalez of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; wrote in a 2003 retrospective that the film&#x27;s moral significance has often been obscured by critical attention to its more shocking elements, noting that this &quot;seriously underplay[s] the film&#x27;s blistering humanity and the audacious aesthetic and philosophical lengths to which Browning goes to challenge the way we define beauty and abnormality.&quot;

, &quot;Freaks&quot; holds an approval rating of 94% on the internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 53 reviews, and boasts an average rating of 8.48/10. Its consensus reads, &quot;Time has been kind to this horror legend: &quot;Freaks&quot; manages to frighten, shock, and even touch viewers in ways that contemporary viewers missed.&quot;

===Home media===
&quot;Freaks&quot; was first issued on Beta, VHS, and LaserDisc by MGM/UA Home Video in 1986, and was rereleased on VHS by MGM/UA Home Video in 1990. MGM/UA then issued a remastered LaserDisc in 1993. David J. Skal, a documentary entitled Freaks: The Sideshow Cinema, and a shorter documentary on the film’s various alternate endings. This disc went out of print in 2016. Interviews include film sideshow performers and film historians Todd Robbins and Johnny Meah, and sideshow performer Jennifer Miller and actors Mark Povinelli and Jerry Maren

Films Around The World (FAT-W) released &quot;Freaks&quot; on DVD in 2016, and Frolic Pictures released Freaks on a double feature DVD with Browning’s 1931 film &quot;Dracula&quot; in 2018. However, neither of these discs were authorized releases of either film.

In 2023, The Criterion Collection announced the release of Tod Browning’s &quot;Sideshow Shockers&quot;, a set which contains new 2K restorations of &quot;Freaks&quot;, &quot;The Unknown&quot; and &quot;The Mystic&quot;. It was released on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2023. David J. Skal recorded a new commentary for this release of &quot;Freaks&quot;. The Criterion release features all of the extras included in the original Warner DVD Home Video release, in addition to an audio recording of David J. Skal reading Tod Robbins&#x27; &quot;Spurs,&quot; film stills, a segment called &quot;One of Us: Portraits From Freaks,&quot; an episode from critic Kristen Lopez&#x27;s podcast on the film&#x27;s disability representation, and a booklet containing photos, credits, and critical essays.

==Legacy==
&quot;Freaks&quot; is now widely considered among director Browning&#x27;s best films. The film&#x27;s growing esteem among critics traces back to the early 1960s, when it was rediscovered as a counterculture cult film, particularly among European audiences. It was screened at the 1962 Venice Film Festival, and shortly after was shown for the first time in the United Kingdom, having been banned there since 1932. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the film was regularly shown at midnight movie screenings in the United States. It also enjoyed a critical reappraisal in France during this period, as, according to Hawkins, Browning had achieved a &quot;certain Poe-esque stature among French intellectuals.&quot; Critic Derek Malcolm noted in 1999 that the film is &quot;one of the masterpieces of baroque cinema,&quot; and a &quot;damning antidote to the cult of physical perfection and an extraordinary tribute to the community of so-called freaks who made up its cast.&quot;

In 1994, &quot;Freaks&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, which preserves &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; films. Film scholar Jennifer Peterson cites &quot;Freaks&quot; as one of the 50 most important American films ever made. In a 2018 retrospective on Browning&#x27;s career, Martyn Conterio of the British Film Institute assesses the film as &quot;best approached with a fuller understanding of Browning&#x27;s work, specifically, the director&#x27;s emotionally complicated interest in human abnormality and the severely disabled,&quot; and considers it among Browning&#x27;s films that &quot;are pioneering and boundary-pushing, amounting to repeat attacks on Hollywood&#x27;s standardised images of beauty and glamour.&quot; It is also listed in the film reference book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;, which says &quot;No mere plot summary can do justice to this alarming yet profound movie, which truly must be seen to be believed. It is a supreme oddity (freak?) of world cinema considered by many to be the most remarkable film in the career of a director whose credits include the original version of &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931).&quot;

Several sequences in the film have been noted for their lasting cultural impact, particularly the freaks&#x27; climactic revenge sequence, which was ranked 15th on Bravo TV&#x27;s list of the 100 Scariest Movie Moments. The banquet sequence in which the freaks chant &quot;We accept her, we accept her, one of us&quot; has also been noted, with Mike D&#x27;Angelo of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; describing it as &quot;the film&#x27;s greatest cultural legacy...  &quot;One of us, one of us, one of us&quot; reliably gets trotted out in situations involving an individual being forced to conform by the masses—I can recall seeing homages on both &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;South Park&quot;, and there are probably dozens of others out there.&quot;

&quot;Freaks&quot; has inspired two unofficial remakes: &quot;She Freak&quot; (1967) and &quot;Freakshow&quot; (2007). It also served as a major inspiration for the fourth season of the television series &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, titled &quot;Freak Show&quot; (2014–2015). &quot;Freaks&quot; was adapted into a 1992 comic book series, published by Fantagraphics, written by Jim Woodring and illustrated by Francisco Solano Lopez.

== In popular culture ==
Browning and the film are mentioned in the 1974 David Bowie song &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;.

The song &quot;Pinhead&quot; (1977) by the punk-rock band Ramones was inspired by &quot;Freaks&quot;, which the band saw in Cleveland, Ohio, after their gig was cancelled. Joey Ramone&#x27;s brother Mickey Leigh said that the line &quot;Gabba Gabba, we accept you, we accept you one of us&quot; was specifically taken from the scene in which &quot;the midget groom does a dance on the banquet table and sings &#x27;Gooble gobble, we accept you, one of us&#x27; to his bride.&quot; The song is an audience participation song, and during live performances, Leigh used to run out on stage with a big sign that bore the text &quot;Gabba Gabba, Hey&quot; and pass it to Joey who&#x27;d hold it up urging the crowd to join in. The song was featured on their album &quot;Leave Home&quot;.

The song &quot;Separated Out&quot; (2001) from the album Anoraknophobia by the UK band Marillion features several samples from the movie.

In &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;, Jordan Belfort and associates chant &#x27;Gooble gobble, we accept you, one of us&#x27; while making plans for a darts tournament that involves throwing little people at a target.

The film was mentioned in the third season episode of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;University,&quot; when the character Caitlin expresses disgust at her classmates&#x27; callous reaction to characters in the film.

<text>From the Manger to the Cross or Jesus of Nazareth (often shortened to simply From the Manger to the Cross) is a 1912 American drama film directed by Sidney Olcott, written by Gene Gauntier (who also portrays Virgin Mary), and starring Robert Henderson-Bland as Jesus of Nazareth. Filmed on location in Egypt and in Palestine, it tells the story of Jesus&#x27;s life, interspersed with verses from &quot;The Bible&quot;.

Kalem released the film in October 1912 to critical acclaim. It saw a re-release in February 1919 following Vitagraph Studios&#x27; acquisition of Kalem.

==Production background==
Herbert Reynolds has shown how Olcott used James Tissot&#x27;s illustrations for his &quot;The Life of our Saviour Jesus Christ&quot; (1896-1897) as the basis for numerous shots in the film. The head of Kalem, Frank J. Marion, presented a copy to the troupe as they departed for the Middle East.

According to Turner Classic Movies, the film cost $35,000 to produce (roughly between $ and $ adjusted to dollars); another source says that Olcott spent $100,000 of his own money on the project. Although the film&#x27;s profits eventually amounted to almost $1 million (roughly $ to $), the Kalem directors refused to increase Olcott&#x27;s basic salary, and he resigned.

In later years, Louis B. Mayer, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, would say this was the premiere film for his movie theater in Haverhill, Massachusetts and a major boost for him in the movie business. However, most sources place the release date of this film as 1912, long after the opening of Mayer&#x27;s theater.

At around 5,000 feet it was one of the longest films to be released to date, although the Kinemacolor documentary &quot;With Our King and Queen Through India&quot; released in February 1912 ran to 16,000 feet; and another religious film &quot;The Miracle&quot; (the first full-colour feature film) - was released in the UK at 7,000 feet in December 1912.

==Reception in Britain==
The five-reel film showed at the Queen&#x27;s Hall, London, for eight months (a relatively lengthy run for the time). A statement by Israel Zangwill (founder of the Jewish Territorialist Organization) hailing it as &quot;An artistic triumph — the kinema put to its true end&quot; appeared on advertising bills outside the Queen&#x27;s Hall.

&quot;From the Manger to the Cross&quot; gained considerable publicity from an outcry in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;: &quot;Is nothing sacred to the film maker?&quot; it demanded, and waxed indignant about the profits for its American investors. Although the clergy were invited and found little to be affronted by, the controversy resulted in the voluntary creation of the British Board of Film Censors, which began operating on 1 January 1913.

==Rediscovery==
The film disappeared from cinema screens for a number of years until Reverend Brian Hession, vicar of Holy Trinity Church in Walton, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, went on a quest to the US to find a copy of the film for re-issue in Britain. Although initially disappointed, he eventually discovered a set of negatives after searching in the vaults and cellars of old film concerns. Hession added a musical sound track and spoken commentary, and &quot;From the Manger to the Cross&quot; was re-released in 1938.

==Critical reception==
TCM host Robert Osborne and the National Film Preservation Foundation consider this film to be the most important silent film to deal with the life of Christ. In 1998, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

A history of cinemas and film-making published in 1947 had this to say: &quot;To-day it appears to be somewhat overacted, and the camera work is stilted, the camera being merely a recording instrument and not part of the pattern of the exposition of the story itself. Its pace is slow by modern standards, doubtless an attempt to obtain dignity, and Bland&#x27;s performance is so sedately remote as to be not so much an acting performance at all but a series of dignified poses.&quot;

<doc id="73498" wikidata="Q884223" url="?curid=73498" title="Fury (1936 film)">
<text>Fury is a 1936 American crime film directed by Fritz Lang that tells the story of an innocent man (Spencer Tracy) who narrowly escapes being burned to death by a lynch mob and the revenge he then seeks. It was Lang&#x27;s first American film.

Released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the movie stars Sylvia Sidney and Tracy, with a supporting cast featuring Walter Abel, Bruce Cabot, Edward Ellis and Walter Brennan. Loosely based on the events surrounding the Brooke Hart murder in San Jose, California, the film was adapted by Bartlett Cormack and Lang from the story &quot;Mob Rule&quot; by Norman Krasna.

In 1995, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; 

==Plot summary==
En route to meet his fiancée Katherine Grant, gas-station owner Joe Wilson is arrested on flimsy circumstantial evidence for the kidnapping of a child. Gossip soon travels around the small town, growing more distorted through each retelling, until a mob gathers at the jail. When the resolute sheriff refuses to give up his prisoner, the enraged townspeople burn down the building, throwing dynamite into the flames as they flee the scene. Unknown to anyone else there, the blast frees Joe but kills his little dog Rainbow, who had run in to comfort him in the cell.

The district attorney brings the main perpetrators to trial for murder, but nobody is willing to identify the guilty, and several provide false alibis. The case seems hopeless, but then the prosecutor produces hard evidence: newsreel footage of 22 people caught in the act.

Katherine discovers that Joe escaped the fire and that his brothers are helping him take revenge by concealing his survival and framing the defendants for his murder. She goes to see Joe and pleads with him to stop the charade, but he is determined to make his would-be killers pay. His conscience begins to weigh on him and, just as the verdicts are being read, he walks into the courtroom and sets things straight.

The part of Wilson&#x27;s dog Rainbow was played by Terry, the same Cairn Terrier who played Toto in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

==Development==
Norman Krasna was inspired to write the story after reading about a lynching in &quot;The Nation&quot;. He pitched the idea to Samuel Marx and Joseph L. Mankiewicz at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who were attracted to it. Krasna claimed that he did not write a script; he verbally pitched it to Mankiewicz, who then dictated it. Multiple changes were made from Krasna&#x27;s story to the final script.

&quot;Fury&quot; was Lang&#x27;s first American film, and is considered by critics to have been compromised by the studio, which forced Lang to tack on a reconciliation between Tracy&#x27;s character and his girlfriend at the end. The film was a departure for MGM, known for its lavish musicals and glitzy dramas; the expensive production features expansive and stylized sets to create its gritty world, and its style is in keeping with the social-issue films often associated with Warner Bros., such as &quot;I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang&quot;.

Lang originally wanted to make a film about a black victim of a lynching, but the idea was rejected by MGM. The kiss scene at the end, a typical Hollywood &quot;happy ending,&quot; was appended because the production manager insisted. Lang, who credited himself with changing the protagonist from a lawyer to a mechanic, also said that he wanted to reveal that the protagonist had committed the murder.

==Reception==
The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing, Original Story. Frank Nugent, in a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised it as &quot;[a] mature, sober and penetrating investigation of a national blight.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1936, Graham Greene strongly praised the film, describing it as &quot;the only film I know to which I have wanted to attach the epithet of &#x27;great&#x27;.&quot; Expressing his view that the film completely conveyed the &quot;sense of spiritual integrity ... by sound and image better than by any other medium,&quot; Greene drew particular attention to the contributions of Sylvia Sidney: &quot;[S]he has never more deeply conveyed the pain and inarticulacy of tenderness ... no other director has got so completely the measure of his medium, is so consistently awake to the counterpoint of sound and image.&quot;

In 1995, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; It was released on Blu-ray disc in the North American region by Warner Bros. in their Archive Collection in 2021.

The film earned domestic rentals of $685,000 and $617,000 overseas. According to MGM records, the final profit was $248,000.

In the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy, Thrawn returns from the unknown and leads Imperial remnants in a campaign against the New Republic, facing off against classic &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Lando Calrissian, before seemingly being resurrected in the &quot;Hand of Thrawn&quot; duology (1997–1998), with his backstory explored in various other novels, short stories, comics, and video games in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe. In 2014, these stories were rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; by Lucasfilm and rendered non-canon.

Thrawn reentered official canon in the 3D animated TV series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; from 2016 to 2018, voiced by Lars Mikkelsen. Zahn published a new &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy (2017–2019) and then the &quot;Thrawn Ascendancy&quot; trilogy (2020–2021), reinventing Thrawn as an anti-villain and double agent who infiltrates the Empire&#x27;s ranks on behalf of his own people and the galactic government of the Unknown Regions, the Chiss Ascendancy. He intends to use Imperial resources to engage in open warfare with the extragalactic fanatics, the Grysk, before they can invade the galaxy, in the meantime opposing the Rebel Alliance on Palpatine&#x27;s behalf before being forcibly sent to another galaxy by and alongside Ezra Bridger. Thrawn made his live-action debut in the Disney+ series &quot;Ahsoka&quot; (2023), with Mikkelsen reprising his role. Mikkelsen later reprised the voice role in the animated anthology series &quot;Tales of the Empire&quot; (2024).

Thrawn has been called one of the most significant and popular characters in the &quot;Legends&quot; continuity. Several &quot;Star Wars&quot; action figures and other merchandise have been produced of the character.
==Character==
Thrawn first appeared in the 1991 Timothy Zahn novel &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;, the first installment of what became known as the first &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy. He is a Grand Admiral in the Imperial Navy, and categorically &quot;the most brilliant of the Emperor&#x27;s minions&quot;. A member of the alien Chiss species, native language Cheunh, Thrawn is described as a tall, solidly built humanoid with blue skin and glowing red eyes who wears the white uniform befitting his rank. He has risen in power thanks to his &quot;tactical brilliance and cunning&quot;, and has been described as &quot;one of the most threatening antagonists&quot; in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe. He is an unparalleled military strategist and tactical genius who has made extensive study of military intelligence and the artwork of other cultures, and the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy finds him commanding the remnants of the Imperial Fleet in a series of stunning victories against the New Republic. His full name was given as Mitth&#x27;raw&#x27;nuruodo.

&quot;IGN&quot; described the character as &quot;diabolical, brilliant and ruthless&quot;. Zahn describes Thrawn&#x27;s command style as considerably different from that of Darth Vader and other typical Imperial commanders; instead of punishing failure and dissent, Thrawn promotes creativity among his crew and accepts ideas from subordinates. Zahn said in 2017:

Referencing Zahn&#x27;s annotations in the 20th Anniversary Edition of &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;, John Booth wrote in &quot;Wired&quot; that Zahn &quot;created and developed Thrawn as a character [by] deliberately establishing the Grand Admiral as a villain who leads not by coercion and fear but through valuing strategy and loyalty&quot;. Zahn explained in 2008 that Thrawn&#x27;s version of the Empire is different from that of Palpatine because Thrawn does not have Palpatine&#x27;s and xenophobia. Calling Thrawn and Mara Jade his favorite of the characters he created, Zahn noted in 2006 that writing the Grand Admiral &quot;provides the intellectual challenge of trying to come up with new, clever, and (hopefully) workable tactics and strategies.&quot; Zahn has also stated that Thrawn&#x27;s entire motivation, both serving in the Empire and the Ascendancy, is to protect the Chiss people and &quot;everything else flows from that.&quot;

===Portrayal===
Thrawn is voiced by Tris King in the 1994 computer game &quot;Star Wars: TIE Fighter&quot;, and by Tim Russell in the 1997 audio drama &quot;Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire&quot;. In seasons three and four of &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, Thrawn is voiced by Lars Mikkelsen. Mikkelsen reprised his role as Thrawn from &quot;Rebels&quot; in live-action in the 2023 Disney+ series &quot;Ahsoka&quot;.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Legends&quot; works===

According to Zahn, Lou Aronica of Bantam Spectra had negotiated a book deal with Lucasfilm in 1989, and the publisher put Zahn&#x27;s name at the top of their list of possible authors. He said, &quot;My original instructions from LucasArts consisted of exactly two rules: the books were to start 3–5 years after &quot;Return of the Jedi,&quot; and I couldn&#x27;t use anyone who&#x27;d been explicitly killed off in the movies.&quot; Zahn used information from the original film trilogy as his primary source, but supplemented that with details from the many sourcebooks created for West End Games&#x27; &quot;Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game&quot;, saying that they &quot;saved me from having to reinvent the wheel many times&quot;. In turn, each novel in the trilogy had its role-playing game sourcebook created for it by West End Games.

Introduced in the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy (1991–93), Thrawn became a fan favorite and subsequently appeared in multiple works in what became known as the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe, including novels, comics and video games, through 2006. He is often cited as one of the most popular characters in the franchise. &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; executive producer Dave Filoni said of the character in 2016, &quot;You couldn&#x27;t have grown up a &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan without encountering Thrawn in &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;. It was a dark time when there weren&#x27;t any more movies, and it blew our minds that there could be more.&quot; The &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy itself is widely credited with reviving interest in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. In 2010, &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; creator Filoni expressed interest in using Thrawn in that series. Some fans of Zahn&#x27;s &quot;Thrawn&quot; series had long hoped the books would be adapted, and after the 2012 announcement that The Walt Disney Company had acquired Lucasfilm and planned to produce film sequels to &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Zahn commented that if material from the expanded universe were used in the films, &quot;we&#x27;d all be thrilled to death&quot;.

With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by Disney, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; were rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014. Though Lucasfilm made it clear that new media would &quot;not tell the same story told in the post-&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; Expanded Universe&quot;, it was also established that &quot;creators of new &quot;Star Wars&quot; entertainment have full access to the rich content of the Expanded Universe.&quot; Acknowledging that Thrawn had long been considered by Lucasfilm when developing projects, Filoni later said in 2016 that in particular the character had been on his list of potential villains when developing &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;.

====&quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy (1991–1993)====

The Thrawn&quot; trilogy, also known as the Heir to the Empire&quot; trilogy, was written by Timothy Zahn between 1991 and 1993. Approximately five years after the events depicted in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, the Rebel Alliance, now known as the New Republic, has driven out the remnants of the old Imperial Starfleet to a distant corner of the galaxy and is attempting to set up a functional government. Princess Leia and Han Solo are married and expecting twins. Luke Skywalker has become the first in a long-awaited new line of Jedi Knights. Thousands of light years away, Grand Admiral Thrawn, the last and most brilliant of the 12 grand admirals, has taken command of the shattered Imperial Fleet and prepared it to attack the New Republic. Thrawn is searching for a Dark Jedi to join his side and is confident he can restore the Empire.

In Heir to the Empire (1991), Thrawn plots to destroy the New Republic despite their numerical advantage over the remaining Imperial forces. He sets his sights on the Wayland storehouse of the late Emperor Palpatine, which contains a massive array of Spaarti cloning cylinders and a practical cloaking shield. To this end, Thrawn and his subordinate Gilad Pellaeon, captain of the Star Destroyer &quot;Chimaera&quot;, enlist the help of smuggler Talon Karrde and his second-in-command Mara Jade to obtain several salamander-like creatures called ysalamiri. Thrawn uses the ysalamiri, which possess the natural ability to disrupt the Force, to subdue the storehouse&#x27;s guardian Joruus C&#x27;baoth, a twisted clone of a Jedi Master whom the Grand Admiral had killed years before. C&#x27;baoth offers his allegiance in exchange for two acolytes to bend to his will: Darth Vader&#x27;s twin children, Luke and Leia. Thrawn sends some of his Noghri killers to capture Luke and a pregnant Leia, but their attempts repeatedly fail. Leia defends herself from one attack and is surprised when the Noghri suddenly surrenders. Thrawn launches his first offensive, a series of hit-and-run attacks into New Republic territory, and then steals a complement of mole miners from Lando Calrissian&#x27;s mining operations on Nkllon. In need of warships, and with his previous tactics having forced over 100 lightly crewed ships to be stationed at the Sluis Van shipyards as he planned, Thrawn invades. His stormtroopers use the stolen miners to board and hijack the ships, but they are thwarted when Lando seizes control of the miners remotely. The Grand Admiral withdraws his forces, but thanks to Thrawn&#x27;s plotting, his New Republic nemesis Admiral Ackbar is soon arrested for treason.

Dark Force Rising (1992) reveals that before the Clone Wars, the Old Republic had constructed a fleet of highly automated heavy cruisers, known as the &quot;Katana&quot; fleet. A virus infected the crews of the entire fleet and drove them insane. The fleet was not seen again until smuggler Talon Karrde discovered it (several years before the events of the first book). With access to Palpatine&#x27;s private storehouse on the planet Wayland, Thrawn presses his advantage to marshal more forces for the battle against the New Republic. Mara Jade, in an attempt to exonerate the Empire&#x27;s warrant for Karrde&#x27;s arrest, goes to Thrawn and offers to reveal the location of the &quot;Katana&quot; fleet. Instead, he has her followed and Karrde is captured. Luke and Mara rescue Karrde from Thrawn&#x27;s Star Destroyer as Thrawn attempts to capture another man who knows about the &quot;Katana&quot; fleet. Meanwhile, Leia learns that the Noghri serve the Empire because they revere her late father, Darth Vader, who they believe saved their planet Honoghr from ecological disaster. Leia convinces them that they have been deceived and effectively enslaved by the Empire, and they switch sides. With Ackbar temporarily neutralized as a tactical opponent, Thrawn leads an army of clones to claim the so-called &quot;&quot;Katana&quot; fleet&quot;, outmaneuvering Luke, Lando, and Han Solo.

In The Last Command (1993), set about a month after the previous book, Thrawn uses the &quot;Katana&quot; fleet, crewed with clones, to mount a successful offensive against the New Republic. Seizing one planet after the other, the Grand Admiral soon immobilizes the galactic capital world, Coruscant. He has placed multiple cloaked asteroids around the planet, and through a ruse, he has led the New Republic leadership to believe that Coruscant is surrounded with them. Learning of the deception, the Republic fleet attacks the Imperial shipyards at Bilbringi to capture a device that can find the cloaked asteroids, but Thrawn&#x27;s forces intercept and surround them. Meanwhile, Luke and Leia lead a group to destroy the cloning facility on Wayland, killing C&#x27;baoth and destroying the cloning cylinders. Just as Thrawn and Pellaeon learn that the Noghri aided in the attack on Wayland, Thrawn&#x27;s Noghri bodyguard, Rukh, kills the Grand Admiral—whose last words are, &quot;But ... it was so artistically done.&quot; The tide of battle at Bilbringi turns, and with the hope of victory dashed by Thrawn&#x27;s death, Pellaeon orders the Imperial forces to retreat.

====&quot;The Hand of Thrawn&quot; duology (1997–1998)====
Zahn&#x27;s Specter of the Past (1997) finds Thrawn seemingly resurrected ten years after his death when he reappears to lead the decimated Imperial forces against the unstable New Republic. A record surfaces called the Caamasi Document, which indicates that a small group of Bothans were perpetrators in the tragic destruction of the planet Caamas and causes more than a hundred alien warships to gather in orbit over the Bothans&#x27; homeworld, which the Empire hopes to use to its benefit.

In Vision of the Future (1998), Admiral Gilad Pellaeon admits that the Empire, down to only a few sectors, is now fighting a losing battle, and initiates peace talks with Princess Leia. However, Moff Disra hires a con artist, Flim, to impersonate the deceased Grand Admiral Thrawn to motivate the Imperial forces. Major Grodin Tierce, the clone of a former stormtrooper imbued with Thrawn&#x27;s tactical intellect by the grand admiral himself, strategizes that the false Thrawn could also rally support for the Empire and intimidate the New Republic. The tactic is successful until Pellaeon and Talon Karrde—on opposing sides but both desiring peace—expose Flim. Meanwhile, at a fortress called the Hand of Thrawn, Luke and Mara discover a gestating and near-complete clone of Thrawn, which is killed during their escape. An expedition by Thrawn to the galaxy&#x27;s Unknown Regions is also mentioned. Finally, a peace treaty is signed by Pellaeon and the New Republic&#x27;s president.

====Other works====
=====Novels=====
Thrawn appears as a captain in the 1997 William C. Dietz novella &quot;Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire&quot;. A younger Thrawn, ranked Captain, makes a cameo appearance in the 1998 young reader&#x27;s book &quot;Galaxy of Fear: The Swarm&quot; by John Whitman, set between &quot;A New Hope&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. In the novel, Tash and Zack Arranda and their uncle Hoole, natives of Alderaan who are fugitives from the Empire, have a chance encounter with Thrawn on the planet of the S&#x27;krrr species. Though suspicious, Thrawn is cordial and later reluctantly aids them in stopping the drog beetles from overrunning the planet.

Before the theatrical release of &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, Lucasfilm suggested that Zahn write a prequel-era book. Zahn decided to have his 2004 novel &quot;Survivor&#x27;s Quest&quot; (the sequel to &quot;The Hand of Thrawn&quot; duology) cover the end of the Outbound Flight story arc before exploring its beginning in his prequel novel. In &quot;Survivor&#x27;s Quest&quot;, Luke and Mara journey to investigate the wreckage of Outbound Flight, a Jedi expedition destroyed by Thrawn years before. Newly discovered by the Chiss, the remains turn out to be the lure in a trap laid by the bloodthirsty Vagaari to avenge themselves on the Chiss.

Zahn&#x27;s 2006 novel Outbound Flight is set fifty years before &quot;Survivor&#x27;s Quest&quot;. It follows the story of the doomed titular expedition, led by Jedi Master Jorus C&#x27;baoth, that is attacked by a young Chiss commander named Mitth&#x27;raw&#x27;nuruodo—informally known as Thrawn. In the story, a Republic fleet comes across the Chiss for the first time. The alien commander, Thrawn, can handily defeat the Republic ships despite inferior weapons and numbers. Darth Sidious, Palpatine&#x27;s alter-ego, seeks to destroy the &quot;Outbound Flight&quot;, and he and his agent Kinman Doriana convince Thrawn that the ship and its Jedi pose a threat to the peaceful future of the galaxy. Thrawn agrees, hoping to get C&#x27;baoth to turn back before taking more drastic action. The Jedi refuses and Thrawn fires on the ship, but Doriana launches an assault that kills every Jedi and sends the &quot;Outbound Flight&quot; careening to its destruction on a nearby planet. Thrawn&#x27;s brother Thrass and Lorana, the sole surviving Jedi, sacrifice their lives to save what survivors they can. Thrawn is reprimanded by his Chiss superiors for his hostile behavior, and summoned back to his home planet Csilla. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called Thrawn the &quot;true star&quot; of the novel, noting that his attack on the ship, secretly influenced by Palpatine&#x27;s agents, &quot;insures his own eventual exile from his race and sets other sinister wheels in motion&quot;. Zahn said of writing the novel, &quot;as always, it was immensely fun to play tactics with Thrawn&quot;. Though StarWars.com suggests that in &quot;Outbound Flight&quot;, Thrawn is &quot;too smart and basically decent to become the servant of Palpatine that he later becomes&quot;, Zahn explains:
Set between &quot;Star Wars: A New Hope&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Zahn&#x27;s &quot;Choices of One&quot; (2011) pits Thrawn against the alien warlord Nuso Esva, his nemesis from the Unknown Regions.

=====Short stories=====
Thrawn, exiled by the Chiss to an inhospitable planet, is found by the Imperial Captain Voss Parck in &quot;Mist Encounter&quot; a short story by Zahn that was originally published in &quot;Star Wars Adventure Journal&quot; #7 (August 1995). Parck realizes Thrawn&#x27;s value as a strategist and decides to bring him to the Emperor. A edited Version of the story was published in the Paperback edition of &quot;Outbound Flight&quot;. In &quot;Command Decision&quot;, a November 1996 short story by Zahn published in &quot;Star Wars Adventure Journal&quot; #11, Thrawn is an admiral in the Imperial Navy with Parck as his subordinate. Thrawn orchestrates a plan to locate a Rebel base in &quot;Side Trip&quot; by Zahn and Michael A. Stackpole, published in &quot;Star Wars Adventure Journal&quot; #12 (February 1997) and #13 (May 1997), and reprinted in the November 1997 anthology &quot;Tales from the Empire&quot;. The success of this mission earns him the command of Darth Vader&#x27;s Noghri commandos. Zahn&#x27;s novella &quot;Crisis of Faith&quot;, published with the 20th Anniversary Edition of &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; on September 6, 2011, is set immediately before &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; and finds Thrawn finally able to defeat Nuso Esva.

Fel understands that such reliance on an alien undercuts the xenophobic foundation of the Empire, and Thrawn goes unrewarded after the successful mission.

=====Video games=====
In the &quot;Tour of Duty III&quot; segment of the 1994 space flight simulator/combat computer game &quot;Star Wars: TIE Fighter&quot;, then-Vice Admiral Thrawn establishes order in a &quot;wild&quot; system at the frontiers of the Empire. The game expansion packs &quot;Defender of the Empire&quot; and &quot;Enemies of the Empire&quot; follow the story of how Thrawn thwarts the efforts of the traitorous Grand Admiral Zaarin to depose the Emperor, and Thrawn is promoted to Grand Admiral in his place.

Thrawn cameos in &quot;Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron&quot; as a &quot;Leader&quot; character for the Galactic Empire in Galactic Conquest, earned by conquering all planets in the Northern Quadrant of the map and allows an army to move twice in one turn if the first move is begun within said quadrant. This power is shared with Admiral Ackbar for the Rebel Alliance. He is also a collectible character in the 2015 mobile collectible Role-playing video game, &quot;Galaxy of Heroes&quot;.

====&quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; (2016–2018)====
In April 2014, with the sequel film &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; in production, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced since the 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; were declared non-canon to the franchise. However, &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; executive producer Dave Filoni announced at the London &quot;Star Wars&quot; Celebration in July 2016 that Thrawn would be reintroduced into the franchise in the third season of the &quot;Rebels&quot; series. The character debuted in the season 3 premiere, &quot;Steps Into Shadow&quot;, which aired on September 24, 2016.

Though in &quot;Legends&quot; works Thrawn was mostly used in post-&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; storylines, &quot;Rebels&quot; takes place within the five years before the events of the original 1977 film. After seeing an advanced clip from the series, Zahn told StarWars.com, &quot;even that short bit was awesome, and just a bit surrealistic. Authors don&#x27;t get to see our creations come to life very often, and it was a real treat to see a walking, talking Grand Admiral Thrawn&quot;.

Acknowledging that Thrawn had long been considered by Lucasfilm when developing projects, Filoni said that in particular, the character had been on his list of potential villains when developing &quot;Rebels&quot;. He explained that unlike how the character Ahsoka Tano has been a foil for Darth Vader in previous seasons of &quot;Rebels&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s no one to defend [the Rebels] against Thrawn. We want to treat him like a big-time villain, as much as Darth Vader, but on the strategic, military side of things.&quot;

====Storylines====
In &quot;Steps into Shadow&quot;, Thrawn is the commander of the Seventh Fleet, recently promoted to Grand Admiral for crushing a rebel insurgency on Batonn without regard for civilian casualties. He is brought in by Imperial Governor Arihnda Pryce to help destroy the series&#x27; eponymous rebel cell. A patient tactician, Thrawn allows the rebels to escape, intending to manipulate them into orchestrating the complete downfall of their rebellion. In &quot;Hera&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, he takes command of the Imperial occupation of Ryloth, home planet of Hera Syndulla, and has his first face-to-face contact with the rebels. He reappears in &quot;Iron Squadron&quot;, where he orders the incompetent Admiral Konstantine to deal with rebels and rebel sympathizers in the Mykapo system; after Konstantine&#x27;s ship is disabled, Thrawn arrives in his personal Star Destroyer, the &quot;Chimaera&quot;, and is revealed to have previously encountered rebel Commander Jun Sato. &quot;An Inside Man&quot; reveals Thrawn now in charge of the Imperial occupation of the planet Lothal, overseeing the factory where the new TIE Defender and various other pieces of equipment are manufactured. He puts an end to rebel acts of sabotage by enforcing a policy of the workers testing their creations and is also shown to be studying pieces of artwork that grant insight into each member of the &quot;Ghost&quot; crew. He also determines that there is a rebel spy within the Imperial ranks, but intends to use this to his advantage. In &quot;Warhead&quot;, Thrawn uses probe droids to determine that Sato&#x27;s hidden rebel base is located on one of less than a hundred planets. Thrawn is shown to be skilled in hand-to-hand combat in &quot;Through Imperial Eyes&quot;, and learns that Agent Kallus is the rebel spy. In &quot;Secret Cargo&quot;, Thrawn and Pryce pursue Senator Mon Mothma, who is being transported to safety by the rebels after speaking out publicly against Palpatine. In &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, Thrawn confronts Kallus about being Fulcrum, and executes his carefully planned attack on the rebel base on Atollon. He is thwarted by the ingenuity of the rebels and the assistance of Bendu, who cryptically warns Thrawn of his impending defeat, &quot;like many arms surrounding you in a cold embrace&quot;. In the series finale &quot;Family Reunion – and Farewell&quot;, Thrawn&#x27;s Star Destroyer is attacked by purrgil while hovering over Lothal. Ensnared in the creatures&#x27; tentacles while simultaneously being confronted by the Force-wielding Ezra Bridger, who brought the purrgil to defend Lothal, the Star Destroyer is dragged by them into hyperspace, leaving both Thrawn&#x27;s and Bridger&#x27;s fates unknown.

====&quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy (2017–2019)====
In a prerecorded video also presented at the July 2016 London &quot;Star Wars&quot; Celebration, Zahn announced that he was writing a new novel titled &quot;Star Wars: Thrawn&quot;, which was released by Del Rey Books in April 2017. According to Zahn, it was &quot;very exciting&quot; to write the character again, and he noted that &quot;with this book I&#x27;ll be visiting a part of his life that I never before had a chance to explore&quot;. Zahn later said, &quot;I get to show how he&#x27;s treated by his fellow officers and shipmates on his way up the military ladder, particularly when he&#x27;s not in a command position over them.&quot;

Although in &quot;Legends&quot; works Thrawn was mostly placed in post-&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; storylines, &quot;Thrawn&quot; is set before the events of the original 1977 film. It covers several years between Thrawn&#x27;s &quot;first encounter&quot; with the Empire and the events of the third season of &quot;Rebels&quot;, chronicling his rise to power. In the novel, seemingly exiled Chiss warrior Thrawn is rescued by Imperial soldiers, and soon proves a valuable asset to the Empire. His cunning and expertise as a tactician soon attract the attention of Emperor Palpatine, though Thrawn&#x27;s renegade tactics ignite the ire of his superiors. As he rises in rank, Thrawn trains his &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; Ensign Eli Vanto in the ways of war, and finds himself in an uneasy alliance with ruthless administrator Arihnda Pryce while in search of rebel leader Nightswan. Ultimately, Thrawn reveals himself to Nightswan as a double agent for the Chiss Ascendancy, his exile having been faked in order to assist with his infiltration.

A six issue comic book miniseries adaptation of the first novel by Marvel Comics began in early 2018, and ended in June of that year.

A sequel to the novel, titled &quot;&quot;, was released on July 24, 2018. This novel is set during the reign of the Empire. The main story line follows Grand Admiral Thrawn a &quot;brilliant strategist&quot; and the &quot;ruthless enforcer&quot; Darth Vader on a mission to investigate a threat to the Empire on a planet called Batuu, which resides at the edges of the Unknown Regions. This is the same planet that many years previously Thrawn, then an officer of the Chiss Ascendancy, crossed paths with General Anakin Skywalker, flashbacks to this encounter tells of their &quot;uneasy alliance&quot; while facing several dangers.

A third novel, &quot;&quot;, was released on July 23, 2019. Set before the finale of &quot;Rebels&quot;, &quot;Thrawn: Treason&quot; features Grand Admiral Thrawn crossing paths with Director Krennic as well as the return of Eli Vanto. Chronologically, &quot;Thrawn: Treason&quot; is set between the &quot;Rebels&quot; episodes &quot;Rebel Assault&quot; and &quot;Family Reunion – and Farewell.&quot;

====&quot;Thrawn: Ascendancy&quot; trilogy (2020–2021)====

At the 2019 New York Comic Con, a new trilogy from Timothy Zahn was announced, to be entitled &quot;Thrawn: The Ascendency Trilogy&quot;, or simply the &quot;Thrawn Ascendancy&quot; trilogy, to launch with &quot;Book I: Chaos Rising&quot; in May 2020. After being delayed twice, the first novel was ultimately released on September 1, 2020. In the novel, it was revealed that Thrawn was born as Kivu&#x27;raw&#x27;nuru (core name Vurawn) before being adopted by the Mitth family, changing his name to Mitth&#x27;raw&#x27;nuru (core name Thrawn). The novel also covered more of Thrawn&#x27;s backstory alongside other Chiss characters, such as Ar&#x27;alani, that also appeared in &quot;&quot;, the previous novel by publication order.

A sequel to &quot;Chaos Rising&quot;, titled &quot;Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good&quot;, was released on April 27, 2021.

The third book of the trilogy called &quot;Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil&quot;, was released on November 16, 2021.

====&quot;Ahsoka&quot; (2023)====

Grand Admiral Thrawn is mentioned by Ahsoka Tano in the Disney+ series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; in &quot;Chapter 13: The Jedi&quot; (2020) as the master to Morgan Elsbeth, the Magistrate of Corvus. He is mentioned again in &quot;Chapter 23: The Spies&quot; (2023) during a meeting between Moff Gideon and the Shadow Council, a group of remnant Imperial warlords, who debate his rumored return and the delivery of Project Necromancer.

Thrawn made his live-action debut in the 2023 Disney+ series &quot;Ahsoka&quot; in &quot;Part Six: Far, Far Away&quot;. It is revealed that the purrgil took Thrawn and Ezra to the planet Peridea, homeworld of the Dathomir witches, and located outside the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy. While Ezra managed to get away from him, Thrawn woke the local Nightsisters and allied with their Great Mothers, and is served by Stormtrooper Captain Enoch. Dark Jedi Baylan Skoll, his apprentice Shin Hati and a liberated Morgan Elsbeth locate Thrawn to bring him out of his exile to lead the remnants of the Galactic Empire. &quot;Part Eight: The Jedi, the Witch, and the Warlord&quot; culminates with Thrawn&#x27;s return to the galaxy. Thrawn&#x27;s Star Destroyer, the &quot;Chimaera&quot;, is depicted approaching the planet Dathomir, docked to the hyperspace ring ship &quot;Eye of Sion&quot;, following his escape from Peridea. Unbeknownst to him, Ezra stowed away onboard his ship and returned to the Republic.

====&quot;Tales of the Empire&quot; (2024)====

Thrawn appears in the second season of &quot;Star Wars: Tales&quot;, titled &quot;Tales of the Empire&quot;, with Lars Mikkelsen returning to voice the character. The series focuses on the start of his partnership with Morgan Elsbeth, when Thrawn was an Admiral in the Empire.

====Other works====
Thrawn is mentioned in the 2017 Chuck Wendig novel &quot;Star Wars: Aftermath: Empire&#x27;s End&quot; as the source of the information about the Unknown Regions which Palpatine uses in his Contingency plan. This plan results in the creation of the First Order.

====Video games====
Thrawn appears as a playable character in the 2017 real-time strategy mobile game &quot;Star Wars: Force Arena&quot;, and was later introduced to &quot;Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes&quot;, a turn-based role-playing game, that summer, as both a special event boss and playable character. He is a bonus playable character in &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga&quot;, available in the &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; character pack sold as downloadable content.

==Reception==
In 2016, Anthony Breznican of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called Thrawn a &quot;fan favorite&quot; and &quot;one of the most significant characters to ever emerge from the Expanded Universe&quot;, and Brian Truitt of &quot;USA Today&quot; named the character &quot;one of &quot;Star Wars&quot; fandom&#x27;s favorite villains&quot;. Comicbook.com called Thrawn &quot;arguably the most popular character in the &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; universe&quot; in 2017, and Linda Hansen-Raj wrote that the character &quot;carries a lasting legacy as one of &quot;Star Wars&quot;″ greatest and most complex antagonists.&quot; In 2014, &quot;GamesRadar&quot;&#x27;s Sam Ashurst called Thrawn &quot;hugely popular amongst fans, partly because of his tactical genius, partly because of his progressive attitude to his employees but mainly due to the fact he&#x27;s got a blue face&quot; and &quot;easily the coolest villain in the &quot;Expanded Universe&quot;&quot;, noting Thrawn&#x27;s loss as one of the major consequences of Lucasfilm&#x27;s abandonment of the old expanded universe for &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;. Emmet Asher-Perrin of &quot;Tor.com&quot; noted in 2016 that as &quot;one of the most popular Expanded Universe villains&quot; and &quot;one of the most threatening antagonists that the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe had on hand&quot;, the character&#x27;s removal from canon continuity &quot;had many fans crying foul&quot;.

In 2008, Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; credited Thrawn and the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy with &quot;kickstarting&quot; the &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe&quot;, and in 2015 &quot;Empire&quot; suggested that Thrawn&#x27;s character helped &quot;revitalize and legitimise&quot; the expanded universe when it was failing. Eric Goldman wrote for &quot;IGN&quot; in 2008, &quot;Diabolical, brilliant and ruthless, Thrawn was an excellent &quot;Star Wars&quot; villain, following in the footsteps of the likes of Grand Moff Tarkin,&quot; adding that &quot;his status as the highest ranking non-human in the Empire was a very interesting aspect&quot;. In 2006, Zahn called Thrawn and Mara Jade his favorite of the characters he created. Zahn said in July 2016, &quot;A writer never knows which characters are going to click with the readers, and it was highly gratifying to me that Thrawn captured the imaginations of so many people over the past quarter century.&quot;

The character has been on many &quot;top&quot; lists of &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters, praising his villainy and character. In a list of fifteen &quot;Star Wars&quot; villains, Schedeen placed Thrawn as second best, beaten by Darth Vader, focusing on his greatness as a commander and tactician. In 2008, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked him as the tenth best overall &quot;Star Wars&quot; character, noting his influence in the expanded universe, and UGO listed him as the third greatest expanded universe character the same year. &quot;Empire&quot; listed Thrawn fifth in their list of the 25 best of the more obscure &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters in 2015.

In November 2016, Lars Mikkelsen was nominated for a 2017 Annie Award for Outstanding Achievement, Voice Acting in an Animated Feature Production for his portrayal of Thrawn on &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;. For his live-action debut in &quot;Ahsoka&quot;, Mikkelsen was nominated for a Critics&#x27; Choice Super Award for Best Villain in a Series in 2024.

==Merchandising==
An Admiral Thrawn 3 inch action figure was produced by Kenner/Hasbro as part of their 1998 &quot;Power of the Force 2&quot; Expanded Universe line.

<text>The T–V distinction is the contextual use of different pronouns that exists in some languages and serves to convey formality or familiarity. Its name comes from the Latin pronouns &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. The distinction takes a number of forms and indicates varying levels of politeness, familiarity, courtesy, age or even insult toward the addressee. The field that studies and describes this phenomenon is sociolinguistics.

Many languages lack this type of distinction, instead relying on other morphological or discourse features to convey formality. English historically contained the distinction, using the pronouns &quot;thou&quot; and &quot;you&quot;, but the familiar &quot;thou&quot; largely disappeared from the era of Early Modern English onward, with the exception of a few dialects. Additionally, British commoners historically spoke to nobility and royalty using the third person rather than the second person, a practice that has fallen out of favour. English speakers today often employ semantic analogues to convey the mentioned attitudes towards the addressee, such as whether to address someone by given name or surname or whether to use &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;madam&quot;. Under a broader classification, &quot;T&quot; and &quot;V&quot; forms are examples of honorifics.

The T–V distinction is expressed in a variety of forms; two particularly common means are:
* addressing a single individual using the second-person plural forms in the language, instead of the singular (e.g. in French);
* addressing individuals with another pronoun with its own verb conjugations (e.g. in Spanish).

== Origin and development ==
The terms &quot;T&quot; and &quot;V&quot;, based on the Latin pronouns and , were first used in a paper by the social psychologist Roger Brown and the Shakespearean scholar Albert Gilman. This was a historical and contemporary survey of the uses of pronouns of address, seen as semantic markers of social relationships between individuals. The study considered mainly French, Italian, Spanish and German. The paper was highly influential and, with few exceptions, the terms &quot;T&quot; and &quot;V&quot; have been used in subsequent studies.

The status of the single second-person pronoun &quot;you&quot; in English is controversial among linguistic scholars. For some, the English &quot;you&quot; keeps everybody at a distance, although not to the same extent as V pronouns in other languages. For others, &quot;you&quot; is a default neutral pronoun that fulfils the functions of both T and V without being
the equivalent of either, so an N-V-T framework is needed, where N indicates neutrality.

== History and usage in language ==
In classical Latin, was originally the singular, and the plural, with no distinction for honorific or familiar. According to Brown and Gilman, the Roman emperors began to be addressed as &quot;vos&quot; in the 4th century AD. They mention the possibility that this was because there were two emperors at that time (in Constantinople and in Rome), but also mention that &quot;plurality is a very old and ubiquitous metaphor for power.&quot; This usage was extended to other powerful figures, such as Pope Gregory I (590–604). However, Brown and Gilman note that it was only between the 12th and 14th centuries that the norms for the use of T- and V-forms crystallized. Less commonly, the use of the plural may be extended to other grammatical persons, such as the &quot;royal &quot;we&quot;&quot; (majestic plural) in English.

Brown and Gilman argued that the choice of form is governed by either relationships of &quot;power&quot; or &quot;solidarity&quot;, depending on the culture of the speakers, showing that &quot;power&quot; had been the dominant predictor of form in Europe until the 20th century. Thus, it was quite normal for a powerful person to use a &quot;T&quot;-form but expect a &quot;V&quot;-form in return. However, in the 20th century the dynamic shifted in favour of solidarity, so that people would use &quot;T&quot;-forms with those they knew, and &quot;V&quot;-forms in service encounters, with reciprocal usage being the norm in both cases.

=== Early history: the power semantic ===
In the Early Middle Ages (the 5th century to the 10th century), the pronoun was used to address the most exalted figures, emperors and popes, who would use the pronoun to address a subject. This use was progressively extended to other states and societies, and down the social hierarchy as a mark of respect to individuals of higher rank, religious authority, greater wealth, or seniority within a family. The development was slow and erratic, but a consistent pattern of use is estimated to have been reached in different European societies by the period 1100 to 1500. Use of &quot;V&quot; spread to upper-class individuals of equal rank, but not to lower class individuals. This may be represented in Brown and Gilman&#x27;s notation:
=== Modification: the solidarity semantic ===
Speakers developed greater flexibility of pronoun use by redefining relationships between individuals. Instead of defining the father–son relationship as one of power, it could be seen as a shared family relationship. Brown and Gilman term this the semantics of solidarity. Thus a speaker might have a choice of pronoun, depending on how they perceived the relationship with the person addressed. Thus a speaker with superior power might choose &quot;V&quot; to express fellow feeling with a subordinate. For example, a restaurant customer might use &quot;V&quot; to their favourite waiter. Similarly, a subordinate with a friendly relationship of long standing might use &quot;T&quot;. For example, a child might use &quot;T&quot; to express affection for their parent.

This may be represented as:

These choices were available not only to reflect permanent relationships, but to express momentary changes of attitude. This allowed playwrights such as Racine, Molière, Ben Jonson, Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare to express a character&#x27;s inner changes of mood through outward changes of pronoun.

For centuries, it was the more powerful individual who chose to address a subordinate either with &quot;T&quot; or with &quot;V&quot;, or to allow the subordinate to choose. For this reason, the pronouns were traditionally defined as the &quot;pronoun of either condescension or intimacy&quot; (&quot;T&quot;) and &quot;the pronoun of reverence or formality&quot; (&quot;V&quot;). Brown and Gilman argue that modern usage no longer supports these definitions.

=== Modern history ===
Developments from the 19th century have seen the solidarity semantic applied more consistently. It has become less acceptable for a more powerful individual to exercise the choice of pronoun. Officers in most armies are not permitted to address a soldier as &quot;T&quot;. Most European parents cannot oblige their children to use &quot;V&quot;. The relationships illustrated above have changed in the direction of the following norms:

The tendency to promote the solidarity semantic may lead to the abolition of any choice of address pronoun. During the French Revolution, attempts were made to abolish &quot;V&quot;. In 17th century England, the Society of Friends obliged its members to use only &quot;T&quot; to everyone, and some continue to use &quot;T&quot; (&quot;thee&quot;) to one another. In most Modern English dialects, the use of &quot;T&quot; is archaic and no longer exists outside of poetry or dialect.

=== Changes in progress ===
It was reported in 2012 that use of the French and the Spanish are in decline in social media. An explanation offered was that such online communications favour the philosophy of social equality, regardless of usual formal distinctions. Similar tendencies were observed in German, Persian, Chinese, Italian and Estonian.

=== History of use in individual languages ===
==== English ====
The Old English and Early Middle English second person pronouns and (with variants) were used for singular and plural reference respectively with no &quot;T–V&quot; distinction. The earliest entry in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; for &quot;ye&quot; as a &quot;V&quot; pronoun in place of the singular &quot;thou&quot; exists in a Middle English text of 1225 composed in 1200. The usage may have started among the Norman French nobility in imitation of Old French. It made noticeable advances during the second half of the 13th century. During the 16th century, the distinction between the subject form &quot;ye&quot; and the object form &quot;you&quot; was largely lost, leaving &quot;you&quot; as the usual &quot;V&quot; pronoun (and plural pronoun). After 1600, the use of &quot;ye&quot; in standard English outside of regional dialects was confined to literary and religious contexts or as a consciously archaic usage.

David Crystal summarises Early Modern English usage thus:

&quot;V&quot; would normally be used
* by people of lower social status to those above them
* by the upper classes when talking to each other, even if they were closely related
* as a sign of a change (contrasting with &quot;thou&quot;) in the emotional temperature of an interaction

&quot;T&quot; would normally be used
* by people of higher social status to those below them
* by the lower classes when talking to each other
* in addressing God or Jesus
* in talking to ghosts, witches, and other supernatural beings
* in an imaginary address to someone who was absent
* as a sign of a change (contrasting with &quot;you&quot;) in the emotional temperature of an interaction

The &quot;T–V&quot; distinction was still well preserved when Shakespeare began writing at the end of the 16th century. However, other playwrights of the time made less use of &quot;T–V&quot; contrasts than Shakespeare. The infrequent use of &quot;T&quot; in popular writing earlier in the century such as the Paston Letters suggest that the distinction was already disappearing from gentle speech. In the first half of the 17th century, &quot;thou&quot; disappeared from Standard English, although the &quot;T–V&quot; distinction was preserved in many regional dialects. When the Quakers began using &quot;thou&quot; again in the middle of the century, many people were still aware of the old &quot;T–V&quot; distinction and responded with derision and physical violence.

In the 19th century, one aspect of the &quot;T–V&quot; distinction was restored to some English dialects in the form of a pronoun that expressed friendly solidarity, written as &quot;y&#x27;all&quot;. Unlike earlier &quot;thou&quot;, it was used primarily for plural address, and in some dialects for singular address as well. The pronoun was first observed in the southern states of the US, although its precise origin is obscure. The pronoun spread rapidly throughout the southern states, and (to a lesser extent) other regions of the US and beyond. This pronoun is not universally accepted, and may be regarded as either nonstandard or a regionalism.

&quot;Yous(e)&quot; (pron. , ) as a plural is found mainly in (Northern) England, Scotland, parts of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, northern Nova Scotia and parts of Ontario in Canada and parts of the northeastern United States (especially areas where there was historically Irish or Italian immigration), including in Boston, Philadelphia, New York, and scattered throughout working class communities in the American Rust Belt.

==== French ====
In Old French texts, the pronouns and are often used interchangeably to address an individual, sometimes in the same sentence. However, some emerging pattern of use has been detected by recent scholars. Between characters equal in age or rank, was more common than as a singular address. However, was sometimes used to put a young man in his place, or to express temporary anger. There may also have been variation between Parisian use and that of other regions.

In the Middle French period, a relatively stable &quot;T–V&quot; distinction emerged. &quot;Vous&quot; was the &quot;V&quot; form used by upper-class speakers to address one another, while was the &quot;T&quot; form used among lower class speakers. Upper-class speakers could choose to use either &quot;T&quot; or &quot;V&quot; when addressing an inferior. Inferiors would normally use &quot;V&quot; to a superior. However, there was much variation; in 1596, Étienne Pasquier observed in his comprehensive survey that the French sometimes used to inferiors as well as to superiors &quot;&quot; (&quot;according to our natural tendencies&quot;). In poetry, was often used to address kings or to speak to God.

==== German ====
In German, &quot;Du&quot; is only used as an informal pronoun. It is only addressed to persons that one knows well, like family members and friends. It is also most commonly used among peers as a sign of equality, especially among young people. In formal situations with strangers and acquaintances, &quot;Sie&quot; is used instead. &quot;Ihr&quot; was also used in formal situations; this was once the abundant usage, but it has completely fallen out of use. In the plural form, &quot;ihr&quot; is used as the &quot;T&quot; pronoun and &quot;Sie&quot; is used as the &quot;V&quot; pronoun; &quot;Ihr&quot; and &quot;Sie&quot; are capitalized when they are used as the &quot;V&quot; pronoun.

==== Scandinavian languages ====

A &quot;T–V&quot; distinction was once widespread in the North Germanic languages but its use began rapidly declining in the second half of the 20th century, coinciding with the 1960s youth rebellion. The &quot;V&quot; variant has in practice completely disappeared from regular speech in Swedish spoken in Sweden, Norwegian and Icelandic. In Faroese and Finland Swedish, however, it is still occasionally used.

The use of the &quot;V&quot; variant in Danish has declined dramatically, but as of 2023 not completely disappeared. In Danish the &quot;T&quot; variant is &quot;du&quot; and the &quot;V&quot; variant is a capitalized &quot;De&quot;.

Swedish both had a &quot;V&quot;-variant of &quot;you&quot; and an even more formal manner of addressing people, which was to address them in the third person (&quot;Could I ask Mr. Johnson to...&quot;).

==== Hindi-Urdu ====
Hindi-Urdu (Hindustani) have three levels of formality distinction. The pronoun तू تو (tū) is the informal (intimate) pronoun, तुम تم (tum) is the familiar pronoun and आप آپ (āp) is the formal pronoun. Tū is only used in certain contexts in Urdu, as in normal conversation, the use of tū is considered very rude. The pronoun तू تو (tū) is grammatically singular while the pronouns तुम تم (tum) and आप آپ (āp) are grammatically plural. However, the plural pronouns are more commonly used as singular pronouns and to explicitly mark the plurality, words such as लोग لوگ (log) [people], सब سب (sab) [all], दोनों دونوں (donõ) [both], तीनों تینوں (tīnõ) [all three] etc. are added after the plural pronouns.

In the Western Hindi dialects, a fourth level of formality (semi-formal), which is intermediate between आप آپ (āp) and तुम تم (tum), is created when the pronoun आप آپ (āp) is used with the conjugations of तुम تم (tum). However, this form is strictly dialectal and is not used in standard versions of Urdu and Hindi.

=== Use of names ===
The boundaries between formal and informal language differ from language to language, as well as within social groups of the speakers of a given language. In some circumstances, it is not unusual to call other people by first name and the respectful form, or last name and familiar form. For example, German teachers used to use the former construct with upper-secondary students, while Italian teachers typically use the latter (switching to a full V-form with university students). This can lead to constructions denoting an intermediate level of formality in T–V-distinct languages that sound awkward to English-speakers. In Italian, can be addressed with the (familiar) form or the (formal) one, but complete addresses range from (peer to peer or family) and (teacher to high-school student, as stated above) to (live-in servant to master or master&#x27;s son) and (senior staff member to junior) and (among peers and to seniors).

== Usage in language ==
=== Singular, plural and other ways of distinction ===
In many languages, the respectful singular pronoun derives from a plural form. Some Romance languages have familiar forms derived from the Latin singular and respectful forms derived from Latin plural , sometimes via a circuitous route. Sometimes, a singular V-form derives from a third-person pronoun; in German and some Nordic languages, it is the third-person plural. Some languages have separate &quot;T&quot; and &quot;V&quot; forms for both singular and plural, others have the same form and others have a &quot;T–V&quot; distinction only in the singular.

Different languages distinguish pronoun uses in different ways. Even within languages, there are differences between groups (older people and people of higher status tending both to use and to expect more respectful language) and between various aspects of one language. For example, in Dutch, the &quot;V&quot; form is slowly falling into disuse in the plural and so one could sometimes address a group as &quot;T&quot; form , which clearly expresses the plural when one would address each member individually as , which has the disadvantage of being ambiguous. In Latin American Spanish, the opposite change has occurred—having lost the &quot;T&quot; form , Latin Americans address all groups as , even if the group is composed of friends whom they would call or (both &quot;T&quot; forms). In Standard Peninsular Spanish, however, (literally &quot;you others&quot;) is still regularly used in informal conversation. In some cases, the &quot;V&quot;-form is likely to be capitalized when it is written.

==== Nominative case ====
The following is a table of the nominative case of the singular and plural second person in many languages, including their respectful variants (if any):


== Related verbs, nouns and pronouns ==
Some languages have a verb to describe the fact of using either a &quot;T&quot; or a &quot;V&quot; form. Some also have a related noun or pronoun. The English words are used to refer only to English usage in the past, not to usage in other languages. The analogous distinction may be expressed as &quot;to use first names&quot; or &quot;to be on familiar terms (with someone)&quot;.
