<text>A sanctuary, in its original meaning, is a sacred place, such as a shrine, protected by ecclesiastical immunity. By the use of such places as a haven, by extension the term has come to be used for any place of safety. This secondary use can be categorized into human sanctuary, a safe place for people, such as a political sanctuary; and non-human sanctuary, such as an animal or plant sanctuary.

== Religious sanctuary ==
&quot;Sanctuary&quot; is a word derived from the Latin , which is, like most words ending in , a container for keeping something in—in this case holy things or perhaps cherished people (/). The meaning was extended to places of holiness or safety. Its origin is the principle of independence and immunity of religious orders from &quot;temporal&quot; powers.

In many religious buildings &quot;sanctuary&quot; has a specific meaning, covering part of the interior. 

===Sanctuary as area around the altar===

In many Western Christian traditions including Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, and Anglican churches, the area around the altar is called the sanctuary; it is also considered holy because of the belief in the physical presence of God in the Eucharist, both during the Mass and in the church tabernacle at other times.

In many churches the architectural term &quot;chancel&quot; covers the same area as the sanctuary, and either term may be used. In some Protestant churches, the term &quot;sanctuary&quot; denotes the entire worship space while the term &quot;chancel&quot; refers only to the area around the communion table.

In many Western traditions, altar rails and sometimes steps would demarcate the sanctuary or chancel from the rest of the building. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Eastern Catholic Churches of Syro-Malabar Church, Byzantine rite and Coptic Orthodox Churches, the sanctuary is separated from the nave (where worshippers pray) by an iconostasis, literally a wall of icons, with three doors in it. In other Oriental Orthodox traditions, a sanctuary curtain is used.

The terminology that applies the word &quot;sanctuary&quot; to the area around the altar does not apply to Christian churches alone: King Solomon&#x27;s temple, built in about 950 BC, had a sanctuary (&quot;Holy of Holies&quot;) where the Ark of the Covenant was, and the term applies to the corresponding part of any house of worship. In most modern synagogues, the main room for prayer is known as the sanctuary, to contrast it with smaller rooms dedicated to various other services and functions.

In synagogues there is a raised bimah in the sanctuary, from which services are conducted, which is where the ark holding the Torah may reside; some synagogues, however, have a separate bimah and ark-platform.

=== Sanctuary as a sacred place ===

In Europe, Christian churches were sometimes built on land considered to be a particularly holy spot. Often these there were legends associated with these locations regarding miracles or martyrdom believed to have taken place or where a holy person was buried. Examples are St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome and St. Albans Cathedral in England, which commemorate the martyrdom of Saint Peter (the first Pope) and Saint Alban (the first Christian martyr in Britain), respectively. Such locations were also often the sites of religious importance to the community before Christianity arrived.

The place and the church built there were considered to have been sanctified (made holy) by what happened there. In modern times, the Catholic Church has continued this practice by placing in the altar of each church, when it is consecrated for use, a box (the &quot;sepulcrum&quot;) containing relics of one or more saints, usually martyrs. This relic box is removed when the church is deconsecrated as a holy space. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the antimension on the altar serves a similar function. It is a cloth icon of Christ&#x27;s body taken down from the cross, and typically has the relics of a saint sewn into it. In addition, it is signed by the parish&#x27;s bishop, and represents his authorization and blessing for the Eucharist to be celebrated on that altar.

== Human sanctuary ==
=== Traditions of Sanctuary ===
Although the word &quot;sanctuary&quot; is often traced back only as far as the Greek and Roman empires, the concept itself has likely been part of human cultures for thousands of years. The idea that persecuted persons should be given a place of refuge is ancient, perhaps even primordial, deriving itself from basic features of human altruism. In studying the concept across many cultures and times, anthropologists have found sanctuary to be a highly universal notion, one which appears in almost all major religious traditions and in a variety of diverse geographies. &quot;Cities of refuge&quot; as described by the Book of Numbers and Deuteronomy in the Old Testament, as well as the Bedouin idea of , or the &quot;taking of refuge&quot;, indicate a strong tradition of sanctuary in the Middle East and Northern Africa. In the Americas, many native tribes shared similar practices, particularly in the face of invading European powers. Despite tensions between groups, many tribes still offered and received sanctuary, taking in those who had fled their tribal lands or feared persecution by the Spanish, English, and French.

=== Legal sanctuary ===
Some (but not all) temples offered sanctuary to criminals or runaway slaves. When referring to prosecution of crimes, sanctuary can mean one of the following:
====Church sanctuary====

A sacred place, such as a church, in which fugitives formerly were immune to arrest (recognized by English law from the fourth to the seventeenth century). While the practice of churches offering sanctuary is still observed in the modern era, it no longer has any legal effect and is respected solely for the sake of tradition.

The term &#x27;sanctuary&#x27; is also used to denote the part of the church which contains the main, or &quot;high altar&quot;.

====Political sanctuary====
Immunity to arrest afforded by a sovereign authority. The United Nations has expanded the definition of &quot;political&quot; to include race, nationality, religion, political opinions and membership or participation in any particular social group or social activities. People seeking political sanctuary typically do so by asking a sovereign authority for asylum.

====Right of asylum====
Many ancient peoples recognized a religious right of asylum, protecting those accused of a crime from legal action and from exile to some extent. This principle was adopted by the early Christian church, and various rules developed for what the person had to do to qualify for protection and just how much protection it was.

Based on an account by Gregory of Tours in late 6th century France, sanctuary was already practiced, but was not all the time respected. In England, King Æthelberht made the first laws regulating sanctuary in about AD 600, though Geoffrey of Monmouth in his &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (c. 1136) says that the legendary pre-Saxon king Dunvallo Molmutius (4th/5th century BC) enacted sanctuary laws in the Molmutine Laws as recorded by Gildas (c. 500–570). By Norman times, there had come to be two kinds of the sanctuary: churches licensed by the king had a broader version, while other churches had a lower level. The medieval system of asylum was finally abolished entirely in England by James I in 1623.

====Political asylum====
During the Wars of the Roses of the 15th century when the Lancastrians or Yorkists would suddenly gain the upper hand by winning a battle, some adherents of the losing side might find themselves surrounded by adherents of the winning side and unable to return to their own side, so they would rush to sanctuary at the nearest church until it was safe to leave it. A prime example is Queen Elizabeth Woodville, consort of Edward IV of England.

In 1470, when the Lancastrians briefly restored Henry VI to the throne, Edward&#x27;s queen was living in London with several young daughters. She moved with them into Westminster Abbey for sanctuary, living there in royal comfort until Edward was restored to the throne in 1471 and giving birth to their first son Edward during that time. When King Edward IV died in 1483, Elizabeth (who was highly unpopular with even the Yorkists and probably did need protection) took her five daughters and youngest son (Richard, Duke of York; Prince Edward had his own household by then) and again moved into sanctuary at Westminster Abbey. She had all the comforts of home; she brought so much furniture and so many chests that the workmen had to break holes in some of the walls to move everything in fast enough to suit her.

In the 20th century, during World War I, all of Russia&#x27;s Allies made the controversial decision in 1917 to deny political sanctuary to Tsar Nicholas II Romanov and his immediate family when he was overthrown in that year&#x27;s February Revolution part of the Russian Revolution because of his abuses of power and forced to abdicate in March in favor of Alexander Kerensky&#x27;s Russian Provisional Government. Nicholas and his family and remaining household were sent to Tobolsk, Siberia that summer while Kerensky kept Russia in the war when it couldn&#x27;t win, enabling Lenin and his Bolsheviks to gain the Russian people&#x27;s support in overthrowing Kerensky in that year&#x27;s October Revolution. The Russian Civil War started that November and in July, 1918, with Lenin losing the civil war, Nicholas and his family were executed on Lenin&#x27;s orders while confined to the Ipatiev House in Yekaterenburg.

In 1939, months before World War II began, 937 Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany on board the MS St. Louis met the same fate, first by Cuba—their original destination—and afterwards by the United States and Canada. As a result, 620 of them were forced back to Europe, where many of them died in Nazi concentration camps during the war. This incident was the subject of Gordon Thomas&#x27; and Max Morgan-Witts&#x27; 1974 novel, &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; and its 1976 movie adaptation.

In 1970, Simonas Kudirka was denied U.S. sanctuary when he attempted to defect from the then-Soviet Union by jumping from his &quot;mother ship&quot;, &#x27;Sovetskaya Litva&#x27;, onto the USCGC Vigilant when it was sailing from New Bedford while Kudirka&#x27;s ship was anchored at Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Kudrika was accused of stealing 3,000 roubles from Sovetskaya Litva&#x27;s safe and when the U.S. State Department didn&#x27;t help him, Kudrika was sent back to the Soviet Union, where he was convicted of treason and sentenced to ten years of hard labor. Because Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother, he was allowed to return to the United States in 1974. His plight was the subject of Algis Ruksenas&#x27; 1973 book &quot;Day of Shame: The Truth About The Murderous Happenings Aboard the Cutter Vigilant During the Russian-American Confrontation off Martha&#x27;s Vineyard&quot; and the 1978 TV movie &quot;The Defection of Simas Kudirka&quot;, starring Alan Arkin.

Ten years later, Ukrainian youth, Walter Polovchak, became a cause célèbre in the 1980s because of his request in 1980 at age 12 to remain in the United States permanently after announcing that he didn&#x27;t want to return with his parents to what was then Soviet Ukraine, and was the subject of a five-year struggle between U.S. and Soviet courts over his fate, which was decided in his favor in 1985 when Walter turned 18 that October 3 and was no longer a juvenile and thus no longer required to return to the Soviet Union if he didn&#x27;t want to.

Also in the 1980s, Estonian national and alleged Nazi war criminal, Karl Linnas, was the target of several sanctuary denials outside the United States before he was finally returned in 1987 to the then-USSR to face a highly likely death penalty for alleged war crimes that he was convicted of in 1962 (see Holocaust trials in Soviet Estonia). Linnas died of a heart attack in a Leningrad prison hospital on July 2, 1987, while waiting for a possible retrial in Gorbachev&#x27;s courts, 25 years after Khrushchev&#x27;s courts convicted him in absentia.

==== Sanctuary versus asylum ====
The concepts of sanctuary and asylum are defined very similarly at their most basic level. Both terms involve the granting of safety or protection from some type of danger, often implied to be a persecuting, oppressive power. The divergence between these terms stems primarily from their societal associations and legal standing; while asylum understood in its political sense implies legally-binding protection on the part of a state entity, sanctuary often takes the form of moral and ethical activism that calls into question decisions made by the institutions in power.

In many instances, the sanctuary is not incorporated into the law but operated in defiance of it. Efforts to create a sanctuary for the persecuted or oppressed are often undertaken by organizations, religious or otherwise, who work outside of mainstream avenues to ameliorate what they see as deficiencies in the existing policy. Though these attempts to provide sanctuary have no legal standing, they can be effective in catalyzing change at community, local, and even regional levels. Sanctuary can also be integrated into these levels of government through &quot;Sanctuary bills&quot;, which designate cities and sometimes states as safe spaces for immigrants deemed illegal by the federal government. These bills work to limit the cooperation of local and regional governments with the national government&#x27;s efforts to enforce immigration law. In recognition of their progressiveness and boldness in the face of perceived injustice, &quot;Sanctuary bills&quot; are commonly referred to as &quot;activist law&quot;.

=== Sanctuary in contemporary society ===
For the last few centuries, it has become less common to invoke sanctuary as a means of protecting persecuted peoples. Yet, the 1980s saw a massive resurgence of cases as part of the U.S.-Central American sanctuary movement. This resurgence was part of a broader anti-war movement that emerged to protest U.S. foreign policy in Central America. The movement grew out of the sanctuary practices of political and religious organizations in both the United States and Central America. It was initially sparked by immigrant rights organizations in well-established Central American communities. These organizations first opposed U.S. foreign policy in Central America and then shifted towards aiding an ever-increasing number of Central Americans refugees. Working in tandem, immigrant rights organizations and churches created many new organizations that provided housing and legal services for newly arrived immigrants. These organizations also advocated for the creation of sanctuary spaces for those fleeing war and oppression in their home countries. By 1987, 440 cities in the United States had been declared &quot;sanctuary cities&quot; open to migrants from civil wars in Central America.

The immigrant-religious organization partnerships of the sanctuary movement remain active, providing essential services to immigrant populations. Particularly notable in recent years is their legal and advocacy work. By providing legal representation to asylum seekers who may not be able to afford it, these organizations give their clients a better chance of winning their respective cases. As of 2008, detained asylum seekers with legal representation were six times more likely to win their cases for asylum, and non-detained asylum seekers with representation were almost three times more likely to win asylum compared with those without it. The pro bono legal services provided by these organizations also work to alleviate stress on an adjudication system that is already overloaded with cases—a 2014 study of the system showed that about 250 asylum officers at any one time are tasked with interviewing an average of 28,000 asylum seekers. These sanctuary-based organizations also engage in larger-scale advocacy work that allows them to reach immigrant populations beyond the communities they work in. According to a study done by the &quot;New Sanctuary Movement&quot; organization, at least 600,000 people in the United States have at least one family member in danger of deportation. Legislative and judicial advocacy work at the regional and even national level allows organizations to support this group of people by influencing policy.

From the 1980s continuing into the 2000s, there also have been instances of immigrant rights organizations and churches providing &quot;sanctuary&quot; for short periods to migrants facing deportation in Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Australia and Canada, among other nations. In 2007, Iranian refugee Shahla Valadi was granted asylum in Norway after spending seven years in church sanctuary after the initial denial of asylum. From 1983 to 2003 Canada experienced 36 sanctuary incidents. In 2016, an Icelandic church declared that they would harbor two failed asylum seekers who violated the Dublin Regulation, and police removed them for deportation, as ecclesiastical immunity has no legal standing.

== Other uses ==
When referring to a shelter from danger or hardship, sanctuary can mean one of the following:
;Shelter sanctuary
:A place offering protection and safety; a shelter, typically used by displaced persons, refugees, and homeless people.
;Humanitarian sanctuary
:A source of help, relief, or comfort in times of trouble typically used by victims of war and disaster.
;Institutional sanctuary
:An institution for the care of people, especially those with physical or mental impairments, who require organized supervision or assistance.
;Work Sanctuary
:A place where an individual can work safely and in a natural environment 
The term &quot;sanctuary&quot; has further come to be applied to any space set aside for private use in which others are not supposed to intrude, such as a &quot;man cave&quot;.

== Non-human sanctuary ==

=== Animal sanctuary ===

An animal sanctuary is a facility where animals are brought to live and be protected for the rest of their lives. Unlike animal shelters, sanctuaries maintain each animal until its natural death, instead of providing temporary shelter until the animal is placed with individuals or groups.

=== Plant sanctuary ===

Plant sanctuaries are areas set aside to maintain functioning natural ecosystems, to act as refuges for species and to maintain ecological processes that cannot survive in most intensely managed landscapes and seascapes. Protected areas act as benchmarks against which we understand human interactions with the natural world.

<text>This is a list of Bishops and Prince-Bishops of the Diocese of Warmia (, , ), which was elevated to the Archdiocese of Warmia in 1992.

The Bishopric was founded in 1243 as the Bishopric of Ermland, one of four bishoprics of Teutonic Prussia. In 1356 it became an Imperial Prince-Bishopric under Emperor Charles IV, and from 1512 until 1930 it was an exempt diocese. From 1947 to 1972 the episcopal see was left vacant following the expulsion of the German population and the Bishop of Ermland from Prussia. The cathedral capitular canons elected capitular vicars for the time sede vacante, recognised by the Holy See.

In 1972 the Holy See installed a new Polish diocese, which in 1992 was elevated to an archdiocese.

<text>A programmable logic device (PLD) is an electronic component used to build reconfigurable digital circuits. Unlike digital logic constructed using discrete logic gates with fixed functions, the function of a PLD is undefined at the time of manufacture. Before the PLD can be used in a circuit it must be programmed to implement the desired function. Compared to fixed logic devices, programmable logic devices simplify the design of complex logic and may offer superior performance. Unlike for microprocessors, programming a PLD changes the connections made between the gates in the device.

PLDs can broadly be categorised into, in increasing order of complexity, simple programmable logic devices (SPLDs), comprising programmable array logic, programmable logic array and generic array logic; complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs); and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

== History ==
In 1969, Motorola offered the XC157, a mask-programmed gate array with 12 gates and 30 uncommitted input/output pins.

In 1970, Texas Instruments developed a mask-programmable IC based on the IBM read-only associative memory or ROAM. This device, the TMS2000, was programmed by altering the metal layer during the production of the IC. The TMS2000 had up to 17 inputs and 18 outputs with 8 JK flip-flops for memory. TI coined the term &quot;programmable logic array&quot; (PLA) for this device.

In 1971, General Electric Company (GE) was developing a programmable logic device based on the new programmable read-only memory (PROM) technology. This experimental device improved on IBM&#x27;s ROAM by allowing multilevel logic. Intel had just introduced the floating-gate UV EPROM so the researcher at GE incorporated that technology. The GE device was the first erasable PLD ever developed, predating the Altera EPLD by over a decade. GE obtained several early patents on programmable logic devices.

In 1973 National Semiconductor introduced a mask-programmable PLA device (DM7575) with 14 inputs and 8 outputs with no memory registers. This was more popular than the TI part but the cost of making the metal mask limited its use. The device is significant because it was the basis for the field programmable logic array produced by Signetics in 1975, the 82S100. (Intersil actually beat Signetics to market but poor yield doomed their part.)

In 1974 GE entered into an agreement with Monolithic Memories (MMI) to develop a mask-programmable logic device incorporating the GE innovations. The device was named &quot;programmable associative logic array&quot; or PALA. The MMI 5760 was completed in 1976 and could implement multilevel or sequential circuits of over 100 gates. The device was supported by a GE design environment where Boolean equations would be converted to mask patterns for configuring the device. The part was never brought to market.

== PLA ==
In 1970, Texas Instruments developed a mask-programmable IC based on the IBM read-only associative memory or ROAM. This device, the TMS2000, was programmed by altering the metal layer during the production of the IC. The TMS2000 had up to 17 inputs and 18 outputs with 8 JK flip-flops for memory. TI coined the term programmable logic array for this device.

A programmable logic array (PLA) has a programmable AND gate array, which links to a programmable OR gate array, which can then be conditionally complemented to produce an output. A PLA is similar to a ROM concept, however a PLA does not provide full decoding of a variable and does not generate all the minterms as in a ROM.

==PAL==
PAL devices have arrays of transistor cells arranged in a &quot;fixed-OR, programmable-AND&quot; plane used to implement &quot;sum-of-products&quot; binary logic equations for each of the outputs in terms of the inputs and either synchronous or asynchronous feedback from the outputs.

MMI introduced a breakthrough device in 1978, the programmable array logic or PAL. The architecture was simpler than that of Signetics&#x27; FPLA because it omitted the programmable OR array. This made the parts faster, smaller and cheaper. They were available in 20-pin 300-mil DIP packages, while the FPLAs came in 28-pin 600-mil packages. The PAL Handbook demystified the design process. The PALASM design software (PAL assembler) converted the engineers&#x27; Boolean equations into the fuse pattern required to program the part. The PAL devices were soon second-sourced by National Semiconductor, Texas Instruments and AMD.

After MMI succeeded with the 20-pin PAL parts, AMD introduced the 24-pin 22V10 PAL with additional features. After buying out MMI (1987), AMD spun off a consolidated operation as Vantis, and that business was acquired by Lattice Semiconductor in 1999.

== GALs ==

An improvement on the PAL was the generic array logic device, or GAL, invented by Lattice Semiconductor in 1985. This device has the same logical properties as the PAL but can be erased and reprogrammed. The GAL is very useful in the prototyping stage of a design when any bugs in the logic can be corrected by reprogramming. GALs are programmed and reprogrammed using a PAL programmer, or, in the case of chips that support it, by using the in-circuit programming technique.

Lattice GALs combine CMOS and electrically erasable (E2) floating gate technology for a high-speed, low-power logic device. A similar device called a PEEL (programmable electrically erasable logic) was introduced by the International CMOS Technology (ICT) corporation.

Sometimes GAL chips are referred as simple programmable logic device (SPLD), analogous to complex programmable logic device (CPLD) below.

== CPLDs ==
PALs and GALs are available only in small sizes, equivalent to a few hundred logic gates. For bigger logic circuits, complex PLDs or CPLDs can be used. These contain the equivalent of several PALs linked by programmable interconnections, all in one integrated circuit. CPLDs can replace thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of logic gates.

Some CPLDs are programmed using a PAL programmer, but this method becomes inconvenient for devices with hundreds of pins. A second method of programming is to solder the device to its printed circuit board, then feed it with a serial data stream from a personal computer. The CPLD contains a circuit that decodes the data stream and configures the CPLD to perform its specified logic function. Some manufacturers, such as Altera and Atmel (now Microchip), use JTAG to program CPLDs in-circuit from .JAM files.

== FPGAs ==
While PALs were being developed into GALs and CPLDs (all discussed above), a separate stream of development was happening. This type of device is based on gate array technology and is called the field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Early examples of FPGAs are the 82S100 array, and 82S105 sequencer, by Signetics, introduced in the late 1970s. The 82S100 was an array of AND terms. The 82S105 also had flip-flop functions.

(Remark: 82S100 and similar ICs from Signetics have PLA structure, AND-plane + OR-plane.)

FPGAs use a grid of logic gates, and once stored, the data doesn&#x27;t change, similar to that of an ordinary gate array. The term &quot;field-programmable&quot; means the device is programmed by the customer, not the manufacturer. FPGAs and gate arrays are similar but gate arrays can only be configured at the factory during fabrication. 

FPGAs are usually programmed after being soldered down to the circuit board, in a manner similar to that of larger CPLDs. In most larger FPGAs, the configuration is volatile and must be re-loaded into the device whenever power is applied or different functionality is required. Configuration is typically stored in a configuration PROM, EEPROM or flash memory. EEPROM versions may be in-system programmable (typically via JTAG).

The difference between FPGAs and CPLDs is that FPGAs are internally based on look-up tables (LUTs), whereas CPLDs form the logic functions with sea-of-gates (e.g. sum of products). CPLDs are meant for simpler designs while FPGAs are meant for more complex designs. In general, CPLDs are a good choice for wide combinational logic applications, whereas FPGAs are more suitable for large state machines such as microprocessors.

==EPLDs==

Using the same technology as EPROMs, EPLDs have a quartz window in the package that allows them to be erased on exposure to UV light.

Using the same technology as EEPROMs, EEPLDs can be erased electrically.

An erasable programmable logic device (EPLD) is an integrated circuit that comprises an array of PLDs that do not come pre-connected; the connections are programmed electrically by the user. Most GAL and FPGA devices are examples of EPLDs.
== Other variants ==
These are microprocessor circuits that contain some fixed functions and other functions that can be altered by code running on the processor. Designing self-altering systems requires that engineers learn new methods and that new software tools be developed.

PLDs are being sold now that contain a microprocessor with a fixed function (the so-called &quot;core&quot;) surrounded by programmable logic. These devices let designers concentrate on adding new features to designs without having to worry about making the microprocessor work. Also, the fixed-function microprocessor takes less space on the chip than a part of the programmable gate array implementing the same processor, leaving more space for the programmable gate array to contain the designer&#x27;s specialized circuits.

== How PLDs retain their configuration ==
A PLD is a combination of a logic device and a memory device. The memory is used to store the pattern that was given to the chip during programming. Most of the methods for storing data in an integrated circuit have been adapted for use in PLDs. These include:

*Silicon antifuses
*SRAM
*EPROM or EEPROM memory cells
*Flash memory

Silicon antifuses are connections that are made by applying a voltage across a modified area of silicon inside the chip. They are called &quot;antifuses&quot; because they work in the opposite way to normal fuses, which begin life as connections until they are broken by an electric current.

SRAM, or static RAM, is a volatile type of memory, meaning that its contents are lost each time the power is switched off. SRAM-based PLDs therefore have to be programmed every time the circuit is switched on. This is usually done automatically by another part of the circuit.

An EPROM memory cell is a MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOS transistor) that can be switched on by trapping an electric charge permanently on its gate electrode. This is done by a PAL programmer. The charge remains for many years and can only be removed by exposing the chip to strong ultraviolet light in a device called an EPROM eraser.

Flash memory is non-volatile, retaining its contents even when the power is switched off. It is stored on floating-gate MOSFET memory cells, and can be erased and reprogrammed as required. This makes it useful in PLDs that may be reprogrammed frequently, such as PLDs used in prototypes. Flash memory is a kind of EEPROM that holds information using trapped electric charges similar to EPROM. Consequently, flash memory can hold information for years, but possibly not as many years as EPROM.

As of 2005, most CPLDs are electrically programmable and erasable, and non-volatile. This is because they are too small to justify the inconvenience of programming internal SRAM cells every time they start up, and EPROM cells are more expensive due to their ceramic package with a quartz window.

== PLD programming languages ==
Many PAL programming devices accept input in a standard file format, commonly referred to as &#x27;JEDEC files&#x27;. They are analogous to software compilers. The languages used as source code for logic compilers are called hardware description languages, or HDLs.

PALASM, ABEL and CUPL are frequently used for low-complexity devices, while Verilog and VHDL are popular higher-level description languages for more complex devices. The more limited ABEL is often used for historical reasons, but for new designs, VHDL is more popular, even for low-complexity designs.

For modern PLD programming languages, design flows, and tools, see FPGA and reconfigurable computing.

== PLD programming devices ==
A device programmer is used to transfer the Boolean logic pattern into the programmable device. In the early days of programmable logic, every PLD manufacturer also produced a specialized device programmer for its family of logic devices. Later, universal device programmers came onto the market that supported several logic device families from different manufacturers. Today&#x27;s device programmers usually can program common PLDs (mostly PAL/GAL equivalents) from all existing manufacturers. Common file formats used to store the Boolean logic pattern (fuses) are JEDEC, Altera POF (programmable object file), or Xilinx BITstream.

<text>Aktien-Gesellschaft &quot;Weser&quot; (abbreviated A.G. &quot;Weser&quot;) was one of the major German shipbuilding companies, located at the Weser River in Bremen. Founded in 1872 it was finally closed in 1983. All together, A.G. „Weser&quot; built about 1,400 ships of different types, including many warships. A.G. „Weser&quot; was the leading company in the Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau AG, a cooperation of eight German shipbuilding companies between 1926 and 1945.

==History==

=== Founding of A.G. &quot;Weser&quot; ===
Aktien-Gesellschaft &quot;Weser&quot; - short A.G. &quot;Weser&quot; - was founded as a successor of the 1843 founded Eisengiesserei &amp; Maschinenbau-Anstalt Waltjen und Leonhard. This company with its premises was situated on an area called &quot;Stephanikirchenweide&quot; at the periphery of the ancient town of Bremen. It was an iron-foundry and machine factory with a wide-ranging production volume of iron-made parts as bridges, cranes, floodgates, steam boiler, steam engines etc. In 1846 Mr. Leonhard left the company and the company&#x27;s name was changed to C. Waltjen &amp; Co. In the same year the first vessel was built. First greater ship was 1847 the 346 GRT paddle-steamer &quot;Roland&quot;, used as tug- and passenger boat. Almost 50 years this ship was in service on the river Weser. More shipbuilding activities followed including three torpedo-boats for the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial German Navy) in 1871.

Because of the increasing importance of the shipbuilding industry some influential Bremen merchants, bankers and politicians decided in 1872 to establish a new and greater company on shares. The production program of this new company named Actien-Gesellschaft &quot;Weser&quot; was &quot;construction of ships of all kind and marine engineering&quot;.

The company Waltjen &amp; Co. was bought and the owner Mr. Carsten Waltjen himself became a member of the new company&#x27;s board.

The new shipyard started shipbuilding with some smaller vessels. The first important order came from the Kaiserliche Marine when several gunboats were built. Besides these warships the construction of ships at A.G. „Weser” was mainly for civil use in the following years.

Because of the growing incoming orders and the enlarged dimensions of ships it soon became necessary to enlarge the yard facilities and mainly the slipways. In 1901 the company started to lease some terrain at the entrance to the new Bremen ports some miles downstream the Weser at the Bremen suburb &quot;Gröpelingen&quot;. Production and personnel then were gradually shifted from the old yard to the new premises. For the first four slipways and one floating dock, workshops, magazines etc. were established at the new terrain, capable to construct ships of all dimensions and categories. But when it soon became necessary to enlarge the shipyard additional terrain was bought in the following years.

Between the founding of the company in 1872 and 1916 about 125 units of the so-called &quot;Self-Powered Vessels&quot; were constructed on the wharf, including passenger- and merchant ships, tug boats etc. Besides this many small units without propulsion were built as barges, pontoons, floating docks etc. as well as four sailing ships 1875/77. For DDG Hansa of Bremen, the company built the three largest freight steamers constructed up to that time, the 8,315 GRT &quot;Frankenfels&quot;, &quot;Schwarzenfels&quot; and &quot;Falkenfels&quot;; these were also the last civilian ships it delivered before World War I.

=== Deschimag Period ===
After WW I A.G. &quot;Weser&quot; continued very soon in shipbuilding. In 1926, when shipbuilding became extremely difficult, A.G. &quot;Weser&quot; merged with seven other German shipyards to form Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau AG (Deschimag), wherein the now named Deschimag A.G. &quot;Weser&quot; took the leading position. Most of the shipyards joining Deschimag were closed, sold or went bankrupt in the following years. Only A.G. &quot;Weser&quot; and Seebeckwerft in Bremerhaven, which was taken over in 1928, survived.

In 1929 the passenger-liner Bremen was put into service, built for the shipping company Norddeutscher Lloyd. It was the most famous liner ever built by A.G. &quot;Weser&quot; and one of the most famous German civilian ships. After delivery of the &quot;Bremen&quot; more than 5,000 of altogether about 12,000 coworkers of the shipyard were set free because of lack of new orders. After the last ship was delivered 1931, for about three years no ship-newbuilding followed, only some repair of ships and construction of engines and marine equipment was done. The first new launched ship was in 1933 the carrier &quot;Cairo&quot; for the company &quot;Norddeutscher Lloyd&quot;. Shortly after that the situation improved with several new orders received, including an increasing amount of warships.

=== Naval Shipbuilding ===
A.G. &quot;Weser&quot; was one of the great German manufacturers of warships, besides Blohm &amp; Voss, the imperial shipyards in Kiel, Danzig and Wilhelmshaven, which later became Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven, and Schichau Shipyard Danzig. This was contrary to the second great Bremen shipyard Bremer Vulkan, which with exception of both World Wars, only produced civilian ships and started warship-building except war-times only in the early 1980s.

A first important warship-order came from the &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;, between 1875 and 1884 altogether 29 gunboats were built. By this A.G. &quot;Weser&quot; started its career as an important constructor of war ships for the Imperial German Navy (1871 – 1918) first and the Kriegsmarine in the Third Reich (1933 – 1945). Altogether A.G. „Weser” built 146 units for the Imperial Navy and 196 units for the Kriegsmarine (Source: Pamphlet 125th anniversary of AG Weser, 1986). After WW II A.G. &quot;Weser&quot; only built a single warship for the German Navy, in 1979/81 the F122-type frigate &quot;Niedersachsen&quot; in collaboration with frigate general contractor &quot;Bremer Vulkan&quot;.

The share of warships from all delivered new constructions came to about 50% in 1909/10 and increased to nearly 100% in 1916 during World War I. After 1936 it was again about 66% with an increasing share to about 80% in 1938. Construction of warships started in 1936 with the artillery training ship &quot;Brummer&quot; for the Kriegsmarine, followed by destroyers and U-boats. The last civilian ships built in 1939 were the merchant ships &quot;Neidenfels&quot; for the German company &quot;D.D.G. Hansa&quot; and &quot;Java&quot; for a shipping company in the Netherlands. The latter was the last civilian ship for many years. After that only warships were constructed, mainly U-boats and some destroyers.

The first U-boats constructed were UB I series. Later also UC I, UB II and UC II series were constructed at AG &quot;Weser&quot;. By 1917 most of the work went into the construction of the UB III. Later three UC III were ordered. but were never finished. During World War I, AG &quot;Weser&quot; launched a total of 96 U-boats.

Because of intensive construction of warships, A.G. &quot;Weser&quot; was often the target of Allied air-raids during the Bombing of Bremen in World War II, mainly in 1944 and 1945. But despite many buildings, workshops, magazines, slipways and docks as well as ships and U-boats under construction were damaged, in most cases production could be continued within some weeks. The estimated reduction of construction capacity at the end of war seemed only less than 30%.

In March 1944 the building of the bunker &quot;Hornisse&quot; (Eng. Hornet) was started near the shipyard. Well-protected from air attacks, it was intended to produce U-boat sections in. These prefabricated sections were then shipped to the U-boat pen Valentin about 30 km downstream the river Weser. Together with parts from Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven and under management of &quot;Bremer Vulkan&quot; beginning end of 1945 monthly 3 U-boats would be completed there. Both bunkers had never been finished and U-boats had never been built there. The bunker &quot;Valentin&quot; is still existing today and partly used as a memorial to the many prisoners and forced labourers who worked and died there.

=== After WW II ===
The Deschimag was dissolved in 1945 after World War II and the company was renamed to the former Aktien-Gesellschaft &quot;Weser&quot;. With the exception of Seebeckwerft, the dismantling of confiscated production facilities for USSR happened from 1945 to 1948. Most of the production equipment was shipped to Russia and together with the damaged facilities from bombing attacks during the war and the following blasting of the slipways the shipyard was more or less useless after that. Only a restricted production-permission was still possible and allowed by the US military government. While Seebeckwerft received the permission to construct ship&#x27;s newbuilding in 1949, A.G. „Weser” received this permission finally some years later in 1951. The first new built unit was completed in 1952, the 2,650 GRT carrier &quot;Werratal&quot;.

A fundamental modernization program was started in 1963. In 1970 the shipyard presented itself in a new modern shape with giant cranes of 500 and 780 tons capacity, which span two slipways for the construction of ships up to 500,000 tons deadweight. Spacious prefabrications workshops with automation equipment and cranes of all sizes were in operation. Ship and engine repairs as well as machinery production and general engineering was performed in well-equipped drydocks and workshops. At this time A.G. &quot;Weser&quot; in Bremen and the affiliated Seebeckwerft in Bremerhaven employed about 8,000 workers and office staff.

The Bremen shipyard A.G. &quot;Weser&quot; concentrated their manufacturing program on all kinds of ships up to approx. 400,000 dwt., the Bremerhaven shipyard Seebeckwerft up to approx. 20,000 dwt. Besides ship-newbuilding, ship repairs and conversion as well as construction of engines and industrial equipment was also carried out.

In the 1970s A.G. &quot;Weser&quot; concentrated their activities on the building of tankers. But this one-sided orientation led to problems when the tanker-boom came to end. Many tanker-orders were cancelled and the lack of orders for other types of ships caused severe financial problems. A closer cooperation between the Bremen shipyards A.G. &quot;Weser&quot; and Bremer Vulkan and the Bremerhaven shipyards &quot;Seebeckwerft&quot;, Lloydwerft and Schichau-Werft, including a reduction of shipbuilding capacities, could not be realized. As a consequence the shipyard A.G. &quot;Weser&quot; closed on December 31, 1983.

<text>A Vicious Circle (1996) is a novel by Amanda Craig which dissects and satirizes contemporary British society. In particular, it describes the world of publishing—its aspiring young authors, busy agents and opportunist literary critics. However, &quot;A Vicious Circle&quot; is also about falling in and out of love, marriage, bringing up children, class consciousness, poverty, and the sad state of hospitals and the medical profession in Britain.

==Plot summary==

The novel chronicles the life of Amelia, the only daughter of newspaper tycoon Max de Monde who, after having spoiled Amelia beyond hope while she was still young, abandons her when she becomes pregnant. Amelia decides to marry Mark Crawley, the father of her child, an ambitious young critic intent on shaking off his humble background. Suddenly, the young couple find themselves in desperate need of money and, at first, accommodations. While she stays at home raising their daughter Rose, Amelia metamorphoses from spoiled brat to mature and responsible mother, whereas her husband loses all interest in the housewife he now realizes he has married. Amelia is encouraged to stay on her chosen path by Grace, her cleaning woman—who is also her niece (without either of the women being aware of this), and by Tom Viner, a young doctor who becomes their lodger.

&quot;A Vicious Circle&quot; also follows the life of Mary Quinn. An Irish girl lacking a university education, Mary has a natural writing talent and rises to become a prominent reviewer of new fiction after having been left by her lover of many years, Mark Crawley. Mary makes friends with Adam Sands, a yet unpublished author who keeps his homosexuality a secret from almost everyone including his own mother. When he is dying of an AIDS-related disease, Mary is the only person who remembers and eventually takes care of him.

When the recession of the 1990s hits the country everyone seems to be affected by it. Max de Monde, who has even plundered his daughter&#x27;s trust fund, spectacularly commits suicide by crashing his helicopter against the ground. Amelia leaves Mark and is planning to raise her daughter as a single parent.

== Reception ==
The novel became, according to &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;a literary sensation before it was even published&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a vicious roman a clef&quot;, and Craig has described how her ex-boyfriend, literary critic David Sexton, believed himself to be &quot;unflatteringly depicted&quot; in the novel. Sexton threatened to sue, and as a result the book’s publication was cancelled by Hamish Hamilton. A rewritten version was later published by Fourth Estate. On publication of the book, several people from the literary world also &quot;happily proffered themselves as candidates&quot; for some of the other characters.

<doc id="73218" wikidata="Q11157129" url="?curid=73218" title="Surface weather analysis">
<text>Surface weather analysis is a special type of weather map that provides a view of weather elements over a geographical area at a specified time based on information from ground-based weather stations.

Weather maps are created by plotting or tracing the values of relevant quantities such as sea level pressure, temperature, and cloud cover onto a geographical map to help find synoptic scale features such as weather fronts.

The first weather maps in the 19th century were drawn well after the fact to help devise a theory on storm systems. After the advent of the telegraph, simultaneous surface weather observations became possible for the first time, and beginning in the late 1840s, the Smithsonian Institution became the first organization to draw real-time surface analyses. Use of surface analyses began first in the United States, spreading worldwide during the 1870s. Use of the Norwegian cyclone model for frontal analysis began in the late 1910s across Europe, with its use finally spreading to the United States during World War II.

Surface weather analyses have special symbols that show frontal systems, cloud cover, precipitation, or other important information. For example, an &quot;H&quot; may represent high pressure, implying clear skies and relatively warm weather. An &quot;L&quot;, on the other hand, may represent low pressure, which frequently accompanies precipitation. Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations on the weather map. Areas of precipitation help determine the frontal type and location.

== History of surface analysis ==

The use of weather charts in a modern sense began in the middle portion of the 19th century in order to devise a theory on storm systems. The development of a telegraph network by 1845 made it possible to gather weather information from multiple distant locations quickly enough to preserve its value for real-time applications. The Smithsonian Institution developed its network of observers over much of the central and eastern United States between the 1840s and 1860s. The U.S. Army Signal Corps inherited this network between 1870 and 1874 by an act of Congress, and expanded it to the west coast soon afterwards.

The weather data was at first less useful as a result of the different times at which weather observations were made. The first attempts at time standardization took hold in Great Britain by 1855. The entire United States did not finally come under the influence of time zones until 1905, when Detroit finally established standard time. Other countries followed the lead of the United States in taking simultaneous weather observations, starting in 1873. Other countries then began preparing surface analyses. The use of frontal zones on weather maps did not appear until the introduction of the Norwegian cyclone model in the late 1910s, despite Loomis&#x27; earlier attempt at a similar notion in 1841. Since the leading edge of air mass changes bore resemblance to the military fronts of World War I, the term &quot;front&quot; came into use to represent these lines.

Despite the introduction of the Norwegian cyclone model just after World War I, the United States did not formally analyze fronts on surface analyses until late 1942, when the WBAN Analysis Center opened in downtown Washington, D.C. The effort to automate map plotting began in the United States in 1969, with the process complete in the 1970s. Hong Kong completed their process of automated surface plotting by 1987. By 1999, computer systems and software had finally become sophisticated enough to allow for the ability to underlay on the same workstation satellite imagery, radar imagery, and model-derived fields such as atmospheric thickness and frontogenesis in combination with surface observations to make for the best possible surface analysis. In the United States, this development was achieved when Intergraph workstations were replaced by n-AWIPS workstations. By 2001, the various surface analyses done within the National Weather Service were combined into the Unified Surface Analysis, which is issued every six hours and combines the analyses of four different centers. Recent advances in both the fields of meteorology and geographic information systems have made it possible to devise finely tailored weather maps. Weather information can quickly be matched to relevant geographical detail. For instance, icing conditions can be mapped onto the road network. This will likely continue to lead to changes in the way surface analyses are created and displayed over the next several years.

== Station model used on weather maps ==

When analyzing a weather map, a station model is plotted at each point of observation. Within the station model, the temperature, dewpoint, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, pressure tendency, and ongoing weather are plotted. The circle in the middle represents cloud cover; fraction it is filled in represents the degree of overcast. Outside the United States, temperature and dewpoint are plotted in degrees Celsius. The wind barb points in the direction from which the wind is coming. Each full flag on the wind barb represents of wind, each half flag represents . When winds reach , a filled in triangle is used for each of wind. In the United States, rainfall plotted in the corner of the station model are in inches. The international standard rainfall measurement unit is the millimeter. Once a map has a field of station models plotted, the analyzing isobars (lines of equal pressure), isallobars (lines of equal pressure change), isotherms (lines of equal temperature), and isotachs (lines of equal wind speed) are drawn. The abstract weather symbols were devised to take up the least room possible on weather maps.

== Synoptic scale features ==

A synoptic scale feature is one whose dimensions are large in scale, more than several hundred kilometers in length. Migratory pressure systems and frontal zones exist on this scale.

=== Pressure centers ===
Centers of surface high- and low-pressure areas that are found within closed isobars on a surface weather analysis are the absolute maxima and minima in the pressure field, and can tell a user in a glance what the general weather is in their vicinity. Weather maps in English-speaking countries will depict their highs as Hs and lows as Ls, while Spanish-speaking countries will depict their highs as As and lows as Bs.

==== Low pressure ====
Low-pressure systems, also known as cyclones, are located in minima in the pressure field. Rotation is inward at the surface and counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere as opposed to inward and clockwise in the southern hemisphere due to the Coriolis force. Weather is normally unsettled in the vicinity of a cyclone, with increased cloudiness, increased winds, increased temperatures, and upward motion in the atmosphere, which leads to an increased chance of precipitation. Polar lows can form over relatively mild ocean waters when cold air sweeps in from the ice cap. The relatively warmer water leads to upward convection, causing a low to form, and precipitation usually in the form of snow. Tropical cyclones and winter storms are intense varieties of low pressure. Over land, thermal lows are indicative of hot weather during the summer.

==== High pressure ====
High-pressure systems, also known as anticyclones, rotate outward at the surface and clockwise in the northern hemisphere as opposed to outward and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Under surface highs, sinking of the atmosphere slightly warms the air by compression, leading to clearer skies, winds that are lighter, and a reduced chance of precipitation. The descending air is dry, hence less energy is required to raise its temperature. If high pressure persists, air pollution will build up due to pollutants trapped near the surface caused by the subsiding motion associated with the high.

=== Fronts ===

Fronts in meteorology are boundaries between air masses that have different density, air temperature, and humidity. Strictly speaking, the front is marked at the warmer edge of a &quot;frontal zone&quot; where the gradient is very large. When a front passes over a point, it is marked by changes in temperature, moisture, wind speed and direction, a minimum of atmospheric pressure, and a change in the cloud pattern, sometimes with precipitation. Cold fronts develop where the cold air mass is advancing, warm fronts where the warm air is advancing, and a stationary front is not moving. Fronts classically wrap around low pressure centers as indicated in the image here depicted for the northern hemisphere. On a larger scale, the Earth&#x27;s polar front is a sharpening of the general equator-to-pole temperature gradient, underlying a high-altitude jet stream for reasons of thermal wind balance. Fronts usually travel from west to east, although they can move in a north-south direction or even east to west (a &quot;backdoor&quot; front) as airflow wraps around a low pressure center. Frontal zones can be distorted by such geographic features as mountains and large bodies of water.

==== Cold front ====

A cold front is located at the leading edge of a sharp temperature gradient on an isotherm analysis, often marked by a sharp surface pressure trough. Cold fronts can move up to twice as quickly as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts as well as pushes the warmer air. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of clouds, showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with a blue line of triangles (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, at the leading edge of the cooler air mass.

==== Warm front ====

Warm fronts mark the position on the Earth&#x27;s surface where a relatively warm body of air is advancing into colder air. The front is marked on the warm edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lies within a low pressure trough that tends to be broader and weaker than that of a cold front. Warm fronts move more slowly than cold fronts because cold air is denser, and is only pushed along (not lifted from) the Earth&#x27;s surface. The warm air mass overrides the cold air mass, so temperature and cloud changes occur at higher altitudes before those at the surface. Clouds ahead of the warm front are mostly stratiform with precipitation that increases gradually as the front approaches. Ahead of a warm front, descending cloud bases will often begin with cirrus and cirrostratus (high-level), then altostratus (mid-level) clouds, and eventually lower in the atmosphere as the front passes through. Fog can precede a warm front when precipitation falls into areas of colder air, but increasing surface temperatures and wind tend to dissipate it after a warm front passes through. Cases with environmental instability can be conducive to thunderstorm development. On weather maps, the surface location of a warm front is marked with a red line of half circles pointing in the direction of travel.

==== Occluded front ====
The classical view of an occluded front is that they are formed when a cold front overtakes a warm front. A more modern view suggests that they form directly during the wrap-up of the baroclinic zone during cyclogenesis, and lengthen due to flow deformation and rotation around the cyclone.

Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel: that is, with a mixture of warm and cold frontal colors and symbols. Occlusions can be divided into warm vs. cold types. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel.

Occluded fronts usually form around low pressure systems in the mature or late stages of their life cycle, but some continue to deepen after occlusion, and some do not form occluded fronts at all. The weather associated with an occluded front includes a variety of cloud and precipitation patterns, including dry slots and banded precipitation. Cold, warm and occluded fronts often meet at the point of occlusion or triple point. 

==== Stationary fronts and shearlines ====

A stationary front is a non-moving boundary between two different air masses. They tend to remain in the same area for long periods of time, sometimes undulating in waves. Often a less-steep temperature gradient continues behind (on the cool side of) the sharp frontal zone with more widely spaced isotherms. A wide variety of weather can be found along a stationary front, characterized more by its prolonged presence than by a specific type. Stationary fronts may dissipate after several days, but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change, driving one air mass toward the other. Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.

As airmass temperatures equalize, stationary fronts may become smaller in scale, degenerating to a narrow zone where wind direction changes over a short distance, known as a shear line, depicted as a blue line of single alternating dots and dashes.

== Mesoscale features ==

Mesoscale features are smaller than synoptic scale systems like fronts, but larger than storm-scale systems like thunderstorms. Horizontal dimensions generally range from over ten kilometres to several hundred kilometres.

=== Dry line ===
The dry line is the boundary between dry and moist air masses east of mountain ranges with similar orientation to the Rockies, depicted at the leading edge of the dew point, or moisture, gradient. Near the surface, warm moist air that is denser than warmer, dryer air wedges under the drier air in a manner similar to that of a cold front wedging under warmer air. When the warm moist air wedged under the drier mass heats up, it becomes less dense and rises and sometimes forms thunderstorms. At higher altitudes, the warm moist air is less dense than the cooler, drier air and the boundary slope reverses. In the vicinity of the reversal aloft, severe weather is possible, especially when a triple point is formed with a cold front.

During daylight hours, drier air from aloft drifts down to the surface, causing an apparent movement of the dryline eastward. At night, the boundary reverts to the west as there is no longer any solar heating to help mix the lower atmosphere. If enough moisture converges upon the dryline, it can be the focus of afternoon and evening thunderstorms. A dry line is depicted on United States surface analyses as a brown line with scallops, or bumps, facing into the moist sector. Dry lines are one of the few surface fronts where the special shapes along the drawn boundary do not necessarily reflect the boundary&#x27;s direction of motion.

=== Outflow boundaries and squall lines ===
Organized areas of thunderstorm activity not only reinforce pre-existing frontal zones, but they can outrun cold fronts. This outrunning occurs in a pattern where the upper level jet splits into two streams. The resultant mesoscale convective system (MCS) forms at the point of the upper level split in the wind pattern at the area of the best low-level inflow. The convection then moves east and equatorward into the warm sector, parallel to low-level thickness lines. When the convection is strong and linear or curved, the MCS is called a squall line, with the feature placed at the leading edge where the significant wind shifts and pressure rises. Even weaker and less organized areas of thunderstorms will lead to locally cooler air and higher pressures, and outflow boundaries exist ahead of this type of activity, &quot;SQLN&quot; or &quot;SQUALL LINE&quot;, while outflow boundaries are depicted as troughs with a label of &quot;OUTFLOW BOUNDARY&quot; or &quot;OUTFLOW BNDRY&quot;.

=== Sea and land breeze fronts ===
Sea breeze fronts occur on sunny days when the landmass warms the air above it to a temperature above the water temperature. Similar boundaries form downwind on lakes and rivers during the day, as well as offshore landmasses at night. Since the specific heat of water is so high, there is little diurnal temperature change in bodies of water, even on the sunniest days. The water temperature varies less than . By contrast, the land, with a lower specific heat, can vary several degrees in a matter of hours.

During the afternoon, air pressure decreases over the land as the warmer air rises. The relatively cooler air over the sea rushes in to replace it. The result is a relatively cool onshore wind. This process usually reverses at night where the water temperature is higher relative to the landmass, leading to an offshore land breeze. However, if water temperatures are colder than the land at night, the sea breeze may continue, only somewhat abated. This is typically the case along the California coast, for example.

If enough moisture exists, thunderstorms can form along sea breeze fronts that then can send out outflow boundaries. This causes chaotic wind/pressure regimes if the steering flow is weak. Like all other surface features, sea breeze fronts lie inside troughs of low pressure.

=== Descending reflectivity core ===

A descending reflectivity core (DRC) is a meteorological phenomenon observed in supercell thunderstorms, characterized by a localized, small-scale area of enhanced radar reflectivity that descends from the echo overhang into the lower levels of the storm.

<doc id="73222" wikidata="Q8329" url="?curid=73222" title="Parakeet">
<text>A parakeet is any one of many small- to medium-sized species of parrot, in multiple genera, that generally has long tail feathers.

== Etymology and naming ==
The name &quot;parakeet&quot; is derived from the French word &quot;perroquet&quot;, which is reflected in some older spellings that are still sometimes encountered, including paroquet or paraquet. However, in modern French, &quot;perruche&quot; is used to refer to parakeets and similar-sized parrots.

In American English, the word &quot;parakeet&quot; usually refers to the budgerigar, which is one species of parakeet.

== Summary ==

Parakeets comprise about 115 species of birds that are seed-eating parrots of small size, slender build, and long, tapering tails. The Australian budgerigar, also known as &quot;budgie&quot;, &quot;Melopsittacus undulatus&quot;, is probably the most common parakeet. It was first described by zoologists in 1891. It is the most popular species of parakeet kept as a pet in North America and Europe. 
The term &quot;grass parakeet&quot; (or &quot;grasskeet&quot;) refers to many small Australian parakeets native to grasslands such as the genus &quot;Neophema&quot; and the princess parrot. The Australian rosellas are also parakeets. Many of the smaller, long-tailed species of lories may be referred to as &quot;lorikeets&quot;. The vernacular name ring-necked parakeet (not to be confused with the Australian ringneck) refers to a species of the genus &quot;Psittacula&quot; native to Africa and Asia that is popular as a pet and has become feral in many cities outside its natural range.

In aviculture, the term &quot;conure&quot; is used for small to medium-sized parakeets of the genera &quot;Aratinga&quot;, &quot;Pyrrhura&quot;, and a few other genera of the tribe Arini, which are mainly endemic to South America. As they are not all from one genus, taxonomists tend to avoid the term. Other South American species commonly called parakeets include the genus &quot;Brotogeris&quot; parakeets, the monk parakeet, and lineolated parakeets, although lineolateds have short tails.

A larger species may be referred to as &quot;parrot&quot; or &quot;parakeet&quot; interchangeably. For example, &quot;Alexandrine parrot&quot; and &quot;Alexandrine parakeet&quot; are two common names for the same species, &quot;Psittacula eupatria&quot;, which is one of the largest species normally referred to as a parakeet.

Many different species of parakeets are bred and sold commercially as pets, the budgerigar being the third most popular pet in the world, after cats and dogs.

== Breeding ==
Parakeets often breed more readily in groups; however, there can be conflicts between breeding pairs and individuals especially if space is limited. The presence of other parakeets encourages a pair to breed, which is why breeding in a group is better. Despite this, many breeders choose to breed in pairs to both avoid conflicts and know offspring&#x27;s parentage with certainty. Budgerigars lay an average of 4-6 eggs, while other parakeet species may lay an average of 4-6 eggs.

== American population ==
There is a growing population of monk parakeets in Brooklyn and Queens, although the species have been reported in all five boroughs of New York City. 
== European population ==
=== Belgian population ===
, an estimated 10,000 parakeets lived in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. The total made them one of the most populous birds in the city, behind only pigeons and sparrows.

=== Spain&#x27;s parakeet control measures ===
According to a 2018 report, Spanish authorities drew up plans to curb the ever-growing population of parakeets, which reached 30,000 in locations such as Malaga.

=== United Kingdom ===

In December 2019, Steven Le Comber, of Queen Mary University in London, UK, published an analysis in the &quot;Journal of Zoology&quot; based on geographic profiling methods. It concluded that the thriving rose-ringed parakeet population in the United Kingdom had grown from numerous small-scale accidental and intentional pet releases. Previous theories had included a pair released by Jimi Hendrix on Carnaby Street and an arrival in 1951 when Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn visited London with various animals to film &quot;The African Queen,&quot; set in the equatorial swamps of east Africa.

<text>Hatfield House is a Grade I listed country house set in a large park, the Great Park, on the eastern side of the town of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England. The present Jacobean house, a leading example of the prodigy house, was built in 1611 by Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury and Chief Minister to King James I. It is a prime example of Jacobean architecture. The estate includes extensive grounds and surviving parts of an earlier palace. Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Oak is said to be the place where Elizabeth I was informed she had become queen. The house is currently the home of Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury. It is open to the public.

== History ==

An earlier building on the site was the Royal Palace of Hatfield. Only part of this still exists a short distance from the present house. That palace was the childhood home and favourite residence of Queen Elizabeth I. Built in 1497 by the Archbishop of Canterbury (formerly Bishop of Ely), King Henry VII&#x27;s minister, John Cardinal Morton, it comprised four wings in a square surrounding a central courtyard. The palace was seized by Henry VIII with other church properties. The nearby parish church of St Etheldreda&#x27;s in Old Hatfield once served the bishop&#x27;s palace as well as the village.
Henry VIII&#x27;s children, King Edward VI and the future Queen Elizabeth I, spent their youth at Hatfield Palace. His eldest daughter, who later reigned as Queen Mary I, lived there between 1533 and 1536, when she was sent to wait on the then Princess Elizabeth as punishment for refusing to recognise Henry&#x27;s marriage to Anne Boleyn and his religious reforms.
In 1548, when she was only 15 years old, Elizabeth was under suspicion of having illegally agreed to marry Thomas Seymour. The house and her servants were seized by Edward VI&#x27;s agent, Robert Tyrwhit, and she was interrogated there. She successfully defended her conduct with wit and defiance. Seymour was executed in 1549 for numerous other crimes against the crown. After her two months of imprisonment in the Tower of London by her sister, Queen Mary, Elizabeth returned to Hatfield. The Queen Elizabeth Oak on the grounds of the estate is said to be the location where Elizabeth was told she was queen following Mary&#x27;s death, but is considered unlikely as Mary died in November. In November 1558, Elizabeth held her first Council of State in the Great Hall.

Hatfield House is a popular tourist attraction because it has so many objects associated with Queen Elizabeth I, including gloves and a pair of silk stockings that are believed to have been the first in England. The library displays a long illuminated parchment roll showing the pedigree of the queen with ancestors back to Adam and Eve. The Marble Hall holds the &quot;Rainbow Portrait&quot; of Elizabeth.
Elizabeth&#x27;s successor, King James I, did not like the palace. It was included in the jointure estate of his wife Anne of Denmark. In 1607, King James gave it to his chief minister, Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, in exchange for Theobalds, which was the Cecils&#x27; family home on the current site of Cedars Park, Broxbourne. Cecil, who liked building, tore down three wings of the royal palace (the back and sides of the square) in 1608 and used the bricks to build the present structure. The richly carved wooden Grand Staircase and the rare stained glass window in the private chapel are among the house&#x27;s original Jacobean features. Cecil employed Robert Lemynge to supervise the construction, with input from the royal surveyor Simon Basil, and Inigo Jones who visited in October 1609.

During World War II, Hatfield House was the location of the first Civil Resettlement Unit and acted as headquarters for the scheme. CRUs were created to help repatriated British prisoners of war transition back to civilian life and the luxurious setting of Hatfield was considered very beneficial to these men. On 12 July 1945, the king and queen visited the CRU at Hatfield, which generated significant news coverage.

== Gardens ==
The gardens, covering , date from the early 17th century and were laid out by John Tradescant the elder. Tradescant visited Europe and brought back trees and plants that had never previously been grown in England. The gardens included orchards, fountains, scented plants, water parterres, terraces, herb gardens and a foot maze. They were neglected in the 18th century, but restoration began in Victorian times and continues under the present Dowager Marchioness of Salisbury.

During World War I, the grounds were used to test the first British tanks. An area was dug with trenches and craters and covered with barbed-wire to represent no man&#x27;s land and German trench lines on the Western Front. To commemorate this, the only surviving Mark I tank was sited at Hatfield from 1919 to 1970 before being moved to The Tank Museum, Bovington.

The Rhodesian Light Infantry Regimental Association has placed its &#x27;Troopie&#x27; memorial statue on the grounds of Hatfield House due to the long association of the Cecil family with Southern Rhodesia. Around its base is a roll of regimental members (&#x27;troopies&#x27;) who fell in the Rhodesian Bush War and several inscriptions, including &#x27;In reconciliation and hope for future peace in Zimbabwe&#x27;.

== Tours ==
The State Rooms can be seen in the midweek guided tours and visitors can look around in their own time at weekends. On Friday, the Garden Connoisseur&#x27;s Day, the house is open for guided tours and pre-booked specialist groups. There are five miles of marked trails.

<doc id="73227" wikidata="Q383994" url="?curid=73227" title="J (programming language)">
<text>The J programming language, developed in the early 1990s by Kenneth E. Iverson and Roger Hui, is an array programming language based primarily on APL (also by Iverson).

To avoid repeating the APL special-character problem, J uses only the basic ASCII character set, resorting to the use of the dot and colon as &quot;inflections&quot; to form short words similar to &quot;digraphs&quot;. Most such &quot;primary&quot; (or &quot;primitive&quot;) J words serve as mathematical symbols, with the dot or colon extending the meaning of the basic characters available. Also, many characters which in other languages often must be paired (such as codice_1 or codice_2) are treated by J as stand-alone words or, when inflected, as single-character roots of multi-character words.

J is a very terse array programming language, and is most suited to mathematical and statistical programming, especially when performing operations on matrices. It has also been used in extreme programming and network performance analysis.

Like John Backus&#x27;s languages FP and FL, J supports function-level programming via its &quot;tacit programming&quot; features.

Unlike most languages that support object-oriented programming, J&#x27;s flexible hierarchical namespace scheme (where every name exists in a specific &quot;locale&quot;) can be effectively used as a framework for both class-based and prototype-based object-oriented programming.

Since March 2011, J is free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3). One may also purchase source under a negotiated license.

==Examples==
J permits point-free style and function composition. Thus, its programs can be very terse and are considered difficult to read by some programmers.

The &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program in J is:

&#x27;Hello, World!&#x27;
This implementation of hello world reflects the traditional use of J – programs are entered into a J interpreter session, and the results of expressions are displayed. It&#x27;s also possible to arrange for J scripts to be executed as standalone programs. Here&#x27;s how this might look on a Unix system:

#!/bin/jc
echo &#x27;Hello, world!&#x27;
exit &quot;
(Note that current j implementations install either codice_3 or (because jconsole is used by java), codice_4 and likely install this to /usr/bin or some other directory (perhaps the Application directory on OSX). So, there&#x27;s a system dependency here which the user would have to solve.)

Historically, APL used codice_5 to indicate the fold, so codice_6 was equivalent to codice_7. Meanwhile, division was represented with the mathematical division symbol ().

Because ASCII does not include a division symbol &quot;per se&quot;, J uses % to represent division, as a visual approximation or reminder. (This illustrates something of the mnemonic character of J&#x27;s tokens, and some of the quandaries imposed by the use of ASCII.)

Defining a J function named codice_8 to calculate the average of a list of numbers yields:

* codice_9sums the items of the array.
* codice_10counts the number of items in the array.
* codice_11divides the sum by the number of items.

This is a test execution of the function:
 2.5

Above, &quot;avg&quot; is defined using a train of three verbs (codice_12, codice_13, and codice_14) termed a &quot;fork&quot;. Specifically, codice_15 is the same as codice_16 which shows some of the power of J. (Here V0, V1, and V2 denote verbs and Ny denotes a noun.) 

Some examples of using codice_8:

 NB. a random vector
 46 55 79 52 54 39 60 57 60 94 46 78 13 18 51 92 78 60 90 62
 59.2

 NB. moving average on periods of size 4
 58 60 56 51.25 52.5 54 67.75 64.25 69.5 57.75 38.75 40 43.5 59.75 70.25 80 72.5

 NB. a random matrix
 46 5 29 2 4
 39 10 7 10 44
 46 28 13 18 1
 42 28 10 40 12

 NB. apply avg to each rank 1 subarray (each row) of m
 17.2 22 21.2 26.4

Rank is a crucial concept in J. Its significance in J is similar to the significance of codice_18 in SQL and of codice_19 in C.

Implementing quicksort, from the J Dictionary yields:

 sel=: adverb def &#x27;u # [&#x27;
 quicksort=: verb define
 if. 1 &gt;: #y do. y
 else.
 (quicksort y &lt;sel e),(y =sel e),quicksort y &gt;sel e=.y{~?#y
 end.


The following is an implementation of quicksort demonstrating tacit programming. The latter involves composing functions together and not referring explicitly to any variables. J&#x27;s support for &quot;forks&quot; and &quot;hooks&quot; dictates rules on how arguments applied to this function will be applied to its component functions.
 quicksort=: (($:@(&lt;#[), (=#[), $:@(&gt;#[)) ({~ ?@#)) ^: (1&lt;#)
Sorting in J is usually accomplished using the built-in (primitive) verbs codice_20 (sort up) and codice_21 (sort down). User-defined sorts such as quicksort, above, typically are for illustration only.

The following example demonstrates the usage of the self-reference verb codice_22 to recursively calculate fibonacci numbers:
1:`($:@-&amp;2+$:@&lt;:)@.(&gt;&amp;2)
This recursion can also be accomplished by referring to the verb by name, although this is of course only possible if the verb is named:
fibonacci=:1:`(fibonacci@-&amp;2+fibonacci@&lt;:)@.(&gt;&amp;2)
The following expression exhibits pi with n digits and demonstrates the extended precision abilities of J:

 NB. set n as the number of digits required
 NB. extended precision 10 to the nth * pi
 314159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510

==Verbs and Modifiers==
A program or routine - something that takes data as input and produces data as output - is called a &quot;verb&quot;. J has a rich set of predefined verbs, all of which work on multiple data types automatically: for example, the verb searches within arrays of any size to find matches:
 3 1 4 1 5 9 i. 3 1 NB. find the index of the first occurrence of 3, and of 1
0 1
 3 1 4 1 5 9 i: 3 1 NB. find the index of the last occurrence of 3, and of 1
0 3
User programs can be named and used wherever primitives are allowed.

The power of J comes largely from its &quot;modifiers&quot;: symbols that take nouns and verbs as operands and apply the operands in a specified way. For example, the modifier takes one operand, a verb to its left, and produces a verb that applies that verb between each item of its argument. That is, is a verb, defined as &#x27;apply between the items of your argument&#x27; Thus, the sentence
 +/ 1 2 3 4 5
produces the effect of
 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5

 +/ 1 2 3 4 5
15
J has roughly two dozen of these modifiers. All of them can apply to any verb, even a user-written verb, and users may write their own modifiers. While modifiers are powerful individually, allowing
* repeated execution, i. e. &quot;do-while&quot;
* conditional execution, i. e. &quot;if&quot;
* execution of regular or irregular subsets of arguments
some of the modifiers control the order in which components are executed, allowing modifiers to be combined in any order to produce the unlimited variety of operations needed for practical programming.

==Data types and structures==
J supports three simple types:

* Numeric
* Literal (Character)
* Boxed

Of these, numeric has the most variants.

One of J&#x27;s numeric types is the &quot;bit&quot;. There are two bit values: &quot;0&quot;, and &quot;1&quot;. Also, bits can be formed into lists. For example, codice_23 is a list of eight bits. Syntactically, the J parser treats that as one word. (The space character is recognized as a word-forming character between what would otherwise be numeric words.) Lists of arbitrary length are supported.

Further, J supports all the usual binary operations on these lists, such as &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;exclusive or&quot;, &quot;rotate&quot;, &quot;shift&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, etc. For example,

 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 +. 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 NB. or
 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0

 3 |. 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 NB. rotate
 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1

J also supports higher order arrays of bits. They can be formed into two-dimensional, three-dimensional, etc. arrays. The above operations perform equally well on these arrays.

Other numeric types include integer (e.g., 3, 42), floating point (3.14, 8.8e22), complex (0j1, 2.5j3e88), extended precision integer (12345678901234567890x), and (extended precision) rational fraction (1r2, 3r4). As with bits, these can be formed into lists or arbitrarily dimensioned arrays. As with bits, operations are performed on all numbers in an array.

Lists of bits can be converted to integer using the codice_24 verb. Integers can be converted to lists of bits using the codice_25 verb. (When parsing J, codice_26 (period) and codice_27 (colon) are word-forming characters. They are never tokens alone, unless preceded by whitespace characters.)

J also supports the literal (character) type. Literals are enclosed in quotes, for example, codice_28 or codice_29. Lists of literals are also supported using the usual convention of putting multiple characters in quotes, such as codice_30. Typically, individual literals are 8-bits wide (ASCII), but J also supports other literals (Unicode). Numeric and Boolean operations are not supported on literals, but collection-oriented operations (such as rotate) are supported.

Finally, there is a boxed data type. Typically, data is put in a box using the codice_31 operation (with no left argument; if there&#x27;s a left argument, this would be the &quot;less than&quot; operation). This is analogous to C&#x27;s codice_32 operation (with no left argument). However, where the result of C&#x27;s codice_32 has reference semantics, the result of J&#x27;s codice_31 has value semantics. In other words, codice_31 is a function and it produces a result. The result has 0 dimensions, regardless of the structure of the contained data. From the viewpoint of a J programmer, codice_31 &quot;puts the data into a box&quot; and allows working with an array of boxes (it can be assembled with other boxes or more copies can be made of the box).

 &lt;1 0 0 1 0
 |1 0 0 1 0|

The only collection type offered by J is the arbitrarily dimensioned array. Most algorithms can be expressed very concisely using operations on these arrays.

J&#x27;s arrays are homogeneously typed, for example the list codice_37 is a list of integers despite codice_38 being a bit. For the most part, these sorts of type issues are transparent to programmers. Only certain specialized operations reveal differences in type. For example, the list codice_39 would be treated exactly the same, by most operations, as the list codice_40.

J also supports sparse numeric arrays where non-zero values are stored with their indices. This is an efficient mechanism where relatively few values are non-zero.

J also supports objects and classes, but these are an artifact of the way things are named, and are not data types. Instead, boxed literals are used to refer to objects (and classes). J data has value semantics, but objects and classes need reference semantics.

Another pseudo-type—associated with name, rather than value—is the memory mapped file.

==Debugging==
J has the usual facilities for stopping on error or at specified places within verbs. It also has a unique visual debugger, called &quot;Dissect&quot;, that gives a 2-D interactive display of the execution of a single J sentence. Because a single sentence of J performs as much computation as an entire subroutine in lower-level languages, the visual display is quite helpful.

==Documentation==
J&#x27;s documentation includes a dictionary, with words in J identified as nouns, verbs, modifiers, and so on. Primary words are listed in the vocabulary, in which their respective parts of speech are indicated using markup. Note that verbs have two forms: monadic (arguments only on the right) and dyadic (arguments on the left and on the right). For example, in &#x27;codice_41&#x27; the hyphen is a monadic verb, and in &#x27;codice_42&#x27; the hyphen is a dyadic verb. The monadic definition is mostly independent of the dyadic definition, regardless of whether the verb is a primitive verb or a derived verb.

==Control structures==
J provides control structures (details here) similar to other procedural languages. Prominent control words in each category include:
* codice_43
* codice_44
* codice_45
* codice_46
* codice_47
* codice_48
* codice_49
* codice_50
* codice_51
* codice_52
* codice_53

<text>Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. People have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century.

Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere, land, and ocean and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change at a given place. Once calculated manually based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky conditions or cloud cover, weather forecasting now relies on computer-based models that take many atmospheric factors into account. Human input is still required to pick the best possible model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases.

The inaccuracy of forecasting is due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere; the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the land, and the ocean; the error involved in measuring the initial conditions; and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric and related processes. Hence, forecasts become less accurate as the difference between the current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the &quot;range&quot; of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus helps narrow the error and provide confidence in the forecast.

There is a vast variety of end uses for weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important because they are used to protect lives and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, many people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them.

Weather forecasting is a part of the economy. For example, in 2009, the US spent approximately $5.8 billion on it, producing benefits estimated at six times as much.

== History ==
===Ancient forecasting===
In 650 BC, the Babylonians predicted the weather from cloud patterns as well as astrology. In about 350 BC, Aristotle described weather patterns in &quot;Meteorologica&quot;. Later, Theophrastus compiled a book on weather forecasting, called the &quot;Book of Signs&quot;. Chinese weather prediction lore extends at least as far back as 300 BC, which was also around the same time ancient Indian astronomers developed weather-prediction methods. In the New Testament, Jesus is quoted as referring to deciphering and understanding local weather patterns, by saying, &quot;When evening comes, you say, &#x27;It will be fair weather, for the sky is red&#x27;, and in the morning, &#x27;Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.&#x27; You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.&quot;

In 904 AD, Ibn Wahshiyya&#x27;s &quot;Nabatean Agriculture&quot;, translated into Arabic from an earlier Aramaic work, discussed the weather forecasting of atmospheric changes and signs from the planetary astral alterations; signs of rain based on observation of the lunar phases; and weather forecasts based on the movement of winds.

Ancient weather forecasting methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition. For example, it was observed that if the sunset was particularly red, the following day often brought fair weather. This experience accumulated over the generations to produce weather lore. However, not all of these predictions prove reliable, and many of them have since been found not to stand up to rigorous statistical testing.

===Modern methods===

It was not until the invention of the electric telegraph in 1835 that the modern age of weather forecasting began. Before that, the fastest that distant weather reports could travel was around 160 kilometres per day (100 mi/d), but was more typically 60–120 kilometres per day (40–75 mi/day) (whether by land or by sea). By the late 1840s, the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously, allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of weather conditions further upwind.

The two men credited with the birth of forecasting as a science were an officer of the Royal Navy Francis Beaufort and his protégé Robert FitzRoy. Both were influential men in British naval and governmental circles, and though ridiculed in the press at the time, their work gained scientific credence, was accepted by the Royal Navy, and formed the basis for all of today&#x27;s weather forecasting knowledge.

Beaufort developed the Wind Force Scale and Weather Notation coding, which he was to use in his journals for the remainder of his life. He also promoted the development of reliable tide tables around British shores, and with his friend William Whewell, expanded weather record-keeping at 200 British coast guard stations.

Robert FitzRoy was appointed in 1854 as chief of a new department within the Board of Trade to deal with the collection of weather data at sea as a service to mariners. This was the forerunner of the modern Meteorological Office. All ship captains were tasked with collating data on the weather and computing it, with the use of tested instruments that were loaned for this purpose.
A storm in October 1859 that caused the loss of the &quot;Royal Charter&quot; inspired FitzRoy to develop charts to allow predictions to be made, which he called &quot;forecasting the weather&quot;, thus coining the term &quot;weather forecast&quot;. Fifteen land stations were established to use the telegraph to transmit to him daily reports of weather at set times leading to the first gale warning service. His warning service for shipping was initiated in February 1861, with the use of telegraph communications. The first daily weather forecasts were published in &quot;The Times&quot; in 1861. In the following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at the principal ports when a gale was expected. The &quot;Weather Book&quot; which FitzRoy published in 1863 was far in advance of the scientific opinion of the time.

As the electric telegraph network expanded, allowing for the more rapid dissemination of warnings, a national observational network was developed, which could then be used to provide synoptic analyses. To shorten detailed weather reports into more affordable telegrams, senders encoded weather information in telegraphic code, such as the one developed by the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Instruments to continuously record variations in meteorological parameters using photography were supplied to the observing stations from Kew Observatory – these cameras had been invented by Francis Ronalds in 1845 and his barograph had earlier been used by FitzRoy.

To convey accurate information, it soon became necessary to have a standard vocabulary describing clouds; this was achieved by means of a series of classifications first achieved by Luke Howard in 1802, and standardized in the &quot;International Cloud Atlas&quot; of 1896.

===Numerical prediction===
It was not until the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction. In 1922, English scientist Lewis Fry Richardson published &quot;Weather Prediction By Numerical Process&quot;, after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in World War I. He described therein how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations governing atmospheric flow could be neglected, and a finite differencing scheme in time and space could be devised, to allow numerical prediction solutions to be found.

Richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations and passing them to others. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers, and the size of the grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems. It was later found, through numerical analysis, that this was due to numerical instability. The first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Duncan Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and ENIAC programmer Klara Dan von Neumann. Practical use of numerical weather prediction began in 1955, spurred by the development of programmable electronic computers.

===Broadcasts===
The first ever daily weather forecasts were published in &quot;The Times&quot; on August 1, 1861, and the first weather maps were produced later in the same year. In 1911, the Met Office began issuing the first marine weather forecasts via radio transmission. These included gale and storm warnings for areas around Great Britain. In the United States, the first public radio forecasts were made in 1925 by Edward B. &quot;E.B.&quot; Rideout, on WEEI, the Edison Electric Illuminating station in Boston. Rideout came from the U.S. Weather Bureau, as did WBZ weather forecaster G. Harold Noyes in 1931.

The world&#x27;s first televised weather forecasts, including the use of weather maps, were experimentally broadcast by the BBC in November 1936. This was brought into practice in 1949, after World War II. George Cowling gave the first weather forecast while being televised in front of the map in 1954. In America, experimental television forecasts were made by James C. Fidler in Cincinnati in either 1940 or 1947 on the DuMont Television Network. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, John Coleman, the first weatherman for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC)&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, pioneered the use of on-screen weather satellite data and computer graphics for television forecasts. In 1982, Coleman partnered with Landmark Communications CEO Frank Batten to launch The Weather Channel (TWC), a 24-hour cable network devoted to national and local weather reports. Some weather channels have started broadcasting on live streaming platforms such as YouTube and Periscope to reach more viewers.

== Numerical weather prediction ==

The basic idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time and use the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future. The main inputs from country-based weather services are surface observations from automated weather stations at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea. The World Meteorological Organization acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide. Stations either report hourly in METAR reports, or every six hours in SYNOP reports. Sites launch radiosondes, which rise through the depth of the troposphere and well into the stratosphere. Data from weather satellites are used in areas where traditional data sources are not available. Compared with similar data from radiosondes, the satellite data has the advantage of global coverage, but at a lower accuracy and resolution. Meteorological radar provide information on precipitation location and intensity, which can be used to estimate precipitation accumulations over time. Additionally, if a pulse Doppler weather radar is used then wind speed and direction can be determined. These methods, however, leave an in-situ observational gap in the lower atmosphere (from 100 m to 6 km above ground level). To reduce this gap, in the late 1990s weather drones started to be considered for obtaining data from those altitudes. Research has been growing significantly since the 2010s, and weather-drone data may in future be added to numerical weather models.
Commerce provides pilot reports along aircraft routes, and ship reports along shipping routes. Research flights using reconnaissance aircraft fly in and around weather systems of interest such as tropical cyclones. Reconnaissance aircraft are also flown over the open oceans during the cold season into systems that cause significant uncertainty in forecast guidance, or are expected to be of high impact three–seven days into the future over the downstream continent.

Models are &quot;initialized&quot; using this observed data. The irregularly spaced observations are processed by data assimilation and objective analysis methods, which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model&#x27;s mathematical algorithms (usually an evenly spaced grid). The data are then used in the model as the starting point for a forecast. Commonly, the set of equations used to predict the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere are called primitive equations. These are initialized from the analysis data and rates of change are determined. The rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future. The equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new rates of change, which predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future. This &quot;time stepping&quot; procedure is continually repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time.

The length of the time step chosen within the model is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain numerical stability. Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes, while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes. The global models are run at varying times into the future. The Met Office&#x27;s Unified Model is run six days into the future, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model is run out to 10 days into the future, while the Global Forecast System model run by the Environmental Modeling Center is run 16 days into the future. The visual output produced by a model solution is known as a prognostic chart, or &quot;prog&quot;. The raw output is often modified before being presented as the forecast. This can be in the form of statistical techniques to remove known biases in the model, or of adjustment to take into account consensus among other numerical weather forecasts. MOS or model output statistics is a technique used to interpret numerical model output and produce site-specific guidance. This guidance is presented in coded numerical form, and can be obtained for nearly all National Weather Service reporting stations in the United States. As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963, long range forecasts, those made at a range of two weeks or more cannot definitively predict the state of the atmosphere, owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved. In numerical models, extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity.

Essentially, a model is a computer program that produces meteorological information for future times at given locations and altitudes. Within any modern model is a set of equations, known as the primitive equations, used to predict the future state of the atmosphere. These equations—along with the ideal gas law—are used to evolve the density, pressure, and potential temperature scalar fields and the velocity vector field of the atmosphere through time. Additional transport equations for pollutants and other aerosols are included in some primitive-equation mesoscale models as well. The equations used are nonlinear partial differential equations, which are impossible to solve exactly through analytical methods, with the exception of a few idealized cases. Therefore, numerical methods obtain approximate solutions. Different models use different solution methods: some global models use spectral methods for the horizontal dimensions and finite difference methods for the vertical dimension, while regional and other global models usually use finite-difference methods in all three dimensions.

==Techniques==
===Persistence===
The simplest method of forecasting the weather, persistence, relies upon today&#x27;s conditions to forecast tomorrow&#x27;s. This can be valid when the weather achieves a steady state, such as during the summer season in the tropics. This method strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern. Therefore, when in a fluctuating pattern, it becomes inaccurate. It can be useful in both short- and long-range forecast|long range forecasts.

===Barometer===
Measurements of barometric pressure and the pressure tendency (the change of pressure over time) have been used in forecasting since the late 19th century. The larger the change in pressure, especially if more than , the larger the change in weather can be expected. If the pressure drop is rapid, a low pressure system is approaching, and there is a greater chance of rain. Rapid pressure rises are associated with improving weather conditions, such as clearing skies.

===Observation===

Along with pressure tendency, the condition of the sky is one of the more important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. High thin cirrostratus clouds can create halos around the sun or moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.

===Nowcasting===

The forecasting of the weather for the following six hours is often referred to as nowcasting. In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model. A human given the latest radar, satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours. However, there are now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation, including evolution of those features in time. Accuweather is known for a Minute-Cast, which is a minute-by-minute precipitation forecast for the next two hours.

===Atmospheric model===
In the past, human forecasters were responsible for generating the weather forecast based upon available observations. Today, human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters, such as model biases and performance. Using a consensus of forecast models, as well as ensemble members of the various models, can help reduce forecast error. However, regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system, large errors within any particular piece of guidance are still possible on any given model run. Humans are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the end user. Humans can use knowledge of local effects that may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to the forecast. While increasing accuracy of forecasting models implies that humans may no longer be needed in the forecasting process at some point in the future, there is currently still a need for human intervention.

===Analog ===
The analog technique is a complex way of making a forecast, requiring the forecaster to remember a previous weather event that is expected to be mimicked by an upcoming event. What makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future. Some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition. It remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data voids such as oceans, as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future. A similar technique is used in medium range forecasting, which is known as teleconnections, when systems in other locations are used to help pin down the location of another system within the surrounding regime. An example of teleconnections are by using El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related phenomena.

=== Artificial intelligence ===
Initial attempts to use artificial intelligence began in the 2010s. Huawei&#x27;s Pangu-Weather model, Google&#x27;s GraphCast, WindBorne&#x27;s WeatherMesh model, Nvidia&#x27;s FourCastNet, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts&#x27; Artificial Intelligence/Integrated Forecasting System, or AIFS all appeared in 2022–2023. In 2024, AIFS started to publish real-time forecasts, showing specific skill at predicting hurricane tracks, but lower-performing on the intensity changes of such storms relative to physics-based models.

Such models use no physics-based atmosphere modeling or large language models. Instead, they learn purely from data such as the ECMWF re-analysis ERA5. These models typically require far less compute than physics-based models.

Microsoft&#x27;s Aurora system offers global 10-day weather and 5-day air pollution (, NO, , , , and particulates) forecasts with claimed accuracy similar to physics-based models, but at orders-of-magnitude lower cost. Aurora was trained on more than a million hours of data from six weather/climate models.

In 2024, a group of researchers at Google&#x27;s DeepMind AI research laboratories published a paper in Nature to describe their machine-learning model, called GenCast, that is expected to produce more accurate forecasts than the best traditional weather forecasting systems.

==Communicating forecasts to the public==

Most end users of forecasts are members of the general public. Thunderstorms can create strong winds and dangerous lightning strikes that can lead to deaths, power outages, and widespread hail damage. Heavy snow or rain can bring transportation and commerce to a stand-still, as well as cause flooding in low-lying areas. Excessive heat or cold waves can sicken or kill those with inadequate utilities, and droughts can impact water usage and destroy vegetation.

Several countries employ government agencies to provide forecasts and watches/warnings/advisories to the public to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests. Knowledge of what the end user needs from a weather forecast must be taken into account to present the information in a useful and understandable way. Examples include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s National Weather Service (NWS) and Environment Canada&#x27;s Meteorological Service (MSC). Traditionally, newspaper, television, and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public. In addition, some cities had weather beacons. Increasingly, the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found. In all cases, these outlets update their forecasts on a regular basis.

===Severe weather alerts and advisories===
A major part of modern weather forecasting is the severe weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected. This is done to protect life and property. Some of the most commonly known of severe weather advisories are the severe thunderstorm and tornado warning, as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch. Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.

===Low temperature forecast===
The low temperature forecast for the current day is calculated using the lowest temperature found between 7pm that evening through 7am the following morning. So, in short, today&#x27;s forecasted low is most likely tomorrow&#x27;s low temperature.

== Specialist forecasting ==
There are a number of sectors with their own specific needs for weather forecasts and specialist services are provided to these users as given below:

=== Air traffic ===
Because the aviation industry is especially sensitive to the weather, accurate weather forecasting is essential. Fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off. Turbulence and icing are also significant in-flight hazards. Thunderstorms are a problem for all aircraft because of severe turbulence due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries, icing due to the heavy precipitation, as well as large hail, strong winds, and lightning, all of which can cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight. Volcanic ash is also a significant problem for aviation, as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds. On a day-to-day basis airliners are routed to take advantage of the jet stream tailwind to improve fuel efficiency. Aircrews are briefed prior to takeoff on the conditions to expect en route and at their destination. Additionally, airports often change which runway is being used to take advantage of a headwind. This reduces the distance required for takeoff, and eliminates potential crosswinds.

===Marine===

Commercial and recreational use of waterways can be limited significantly by wind direction and speed, wave periodicity and heights, tides, and precipitation. These factors can each influence the safety of marine transit. Consequently, a variety of codes have been established to efficiently transmit detailed marine weather forecasts to vessel pilots via radio, for example the MAFOR (marine forecast). Typical weather forecasts can be received at sea through the use of RTTY, Navtex and Radiofax.

===Agriculture===
Farmers rely on weather forecasts to decide what work to do on any particular day. For example, drying hay is only feasible in dry weather. Prolonged periods of dryness can ruin cotton, wheat, and corn crops. While corn crops can be ruined by drought, their dried remains can be used as a cattle feed substitute in the form of silage. Frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall. For example, peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze. Orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes, regardless of their timing.

=== Forestry ===

Forecasting of wind, precipitation and humidity is essential for preventing and controlling wildfires. Indices such as the &quot;Forest fire weather index&quot; and the &quot;Haines Index&quot;, have been developed to predict the areas more at risk of fire from natural or human causes. Conditions for the development of harmful insects can also be predicted by forecasting the weather.

===Utility companies===
Electricity and gas companies rely on weather forecasts to anticipate demand, which can be strongly affected by the weather. They use the quantity termed the degree day to determine how strong of a use there will be for heating (heating degree day) or cooling (cooling degree day). These quantities are based on a daily average temperature of . Cooler temperatures force heating degree days (one per degree Fahrenheit), while warmer temperatures force cooling degree days. In winter, severe cold weather can cause a surge in demand as people turn up their heating. Similarly, in summer a surge in demand can be linked with the increased use of air conditioning systems in hot weather. By anticipating a surge in demand, utility companies can purchase additional supplies of power or natural gas before the price increases, or in some circumstances, supplies are restricted through the use of brownouts and blackouts.

===Other commercial companies===
Increasingly, private companies pay for weather forecasts tailored to their needs so that they can increase their profits or avoid large losses. For example, supermarket chains may change the stocks on their shelves in anticipation of different consumer spending habits in different weather conditions. Weather forecasts can be used to invest in the commodity market, such as futures in oranges, corn, soybeans, and oil.

===Military applications===

====United Kingdom====
The British Royal Navy, working with the Met Office, has its own specialist branch of weather observers and forecasters, as part of the Hydrographic and Meteorological (HM) specialisation, who monitor and forecast operational conditions across the globe, to provide accurate and timely weather and oceanographic information to submarines, ships and Fleet Air Arm aircraft.

A mobile unit in the Royal Air Force, working with the Met Office, forecasts the weather for regions in which British and allied armed forces are deployed. A group based at Camp Bastion used to provide forecasts for the British armed forces in Afghanistan.

====United States====

Similar to the private sector, military weather forecasters present weather conditions to the war fighter community. Military weather forecasters provide pre-flight and in-flight weather briefs to pilots and provide real time resource protection services for military installations.

Naval forecasters cover the waters and ship weather forecasts. The United States Navy provides a special service for itself and the rest of the federal government by issuing forecasts for tropical cyclones across the Pacific and Indian Oceans through its Joint Typhoon Warning Center.

Within the United States, the 557th Weather Wing provides weather forecasting for the Air Force and the Army. Air Force forecasters cover air operations in both wartime and peacetime and provide Army support; United States Coast Guard marine science technicians provide ship forecasts for ice breakers and various other operations within their realm; and Marine forecasters provide support for ground- and air-based United States Marine Corps operations. All four of the mentioned military branches have their initial enlisted meteorology technical training at Keesler Air Force Base. Military and civilian forecasters actively cooperate in analyzing, creating and critiquing weather forecast products.

<text>Operation Torch (8–16 November 1942) was an Allied invasion of French North Africa during the Second World War. Torch was a compromise operation that met the British objective of securing victory in North Africa while allowing American armed forces the opportunity to begin their fight against Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy on a limited scale.

The French colonies were aligned with Germany via Vichy France but the loyalties of the population were mixed. Reports indicated that they might support the Allies. The American General Dwight D. Eisenhower, supreme commander of the Allied forces in Mediterranean theater of the war, approved plans for a three-pronged attack on Casablanca (Western), Oran (Centre) and Algiers (Eastern), then a rapid move on Tunis to catch Axis forces in North Africa from the west in conjunction with the British advance from Egypt.

The Western Task Force encountered unexpected resistance and bad weather but Casablanca, the principal French Atlantic naval base, was captured after a short siege. The Centre Task Force suffered some damage to its ships when trying to land in shallow water; Oran surrendered after bombardment by British battleships. The Eastern Task Force met less opposition and were able to push inland and compel surrender on the first day.

The success of Torch caused Admiral François Darlan, commander of the Vichy French forces, who was in Algiers, to order co-operation with the Allies, in return for being installed as High Commissioner, with many other Vichy officials keeping their jobs. Darlan was assassinated by a monarchist six weeks later and the Free French gradually came to dominate the government.

==Background==
=== Allied strategy ===

When the United States entered the Second World War in December 7, British and Americans met at the Arcadia Conference to discuss future strategy. The principle of Europe first was agreed upon, but British and Americans had different views on how to implement it. Americans favoured a direct approach with first a limited landing in 1942 (Operation Sledgehammer), and then a follow-up main thrust in 1943 (Operation Roundup). The British pressed for a less ambitious plan. They realized the build-up of American forces (Operation Bolero) would take time, and there was not enough shipping available for large operations. Winston Churchill proposed to invade North Africa. The head of the United States Army, General George Marshall and the head of the US Navy, Admiral Ernest King strongly opposed that plan, and were inclined to abandon the Germany first strategy if Churchill persisted. But President Franklin D. Roosevelt wanted to support the Russians and as any Pacific operation would be of no help to them, he agreed to the North-African operation. On 14 August 1942 Lt. General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed as Commander in Chief Allied expeditionary Force, and he set up his headquarters in London.

Planners identified Oran, Algiers and Casablanca as key targets. Ideally there would also be a landing at Tunis to secure Tunisia and facilitate the rapid interdiction of supplies travelling via Tripoli to Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps forces in Italian Libya. A compromise would be to land at Bône in eastern Algeria, some closer to Tunis than Algiers. Limited resources dictated that the Allies could only make three landings and Eisenhower, who believed that any plan must include landings at Oran and Algiers, had two main options: either the western option, to land at Casablanca, Oran and Algiers and then make as rapid a move as possible to Tunis some east of Algiers once the Vichy opposition was suppressed; or the eastern option, to land at Oran, Algiers and Bône and then advance overland to Casablanca some west of Oran. He favoured the eastern option because of the advantages it gave to an early capture of Tunis and also because the Atlantic swells off Casablanca presented considerably greater risks to an amphibious landing there than would be encountered in the Mediterranean. The Combined Chiefs of Staff, however, were concerned that should Operation Torch precipitate Spain to abandon neutrality and join the Axis, the Straits of Gibraltar could be closed cutting the entire Allied force&#x27;s lines of communication. They therefore chose the Casablanca option as the less risky since the forces in Algeria and Tunisia could be supplied overland from Casablanca in the event of closure of the straits.

The Morocco landings ruled out the early occupation of Tunisia. But with British forces advancing from Egypt, this would allow the Allies to carry out a pincer operation against Axis forces in North Africa by mid-January 1943

===Intrigues with Vichy commanders===

The Allies believed that the Vichy French Armistice Army would not fight, partly because of information supplied by the American Consul Robert Daniel Murphy in Algiers. The French were former members of the Allies and the American troops were instructed not to fire unless they were fired upon. The Vichy French Navy were expected to be very hostile after the British Attack on Mers-el-Kébir in June 1940, and the Syria–Lebanon campaign in 1941.

Allied military strategists needed to consider the political situation in North Africa. The Americans had recognised Pétain and the Vichy government in 1940, whereas the British did not and had recognised General Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s French National Committee as a government-in-exile instead. After his backing of British operations against the Vichy French in Dakar and Syria, De Gaulle did not have many supporters in North Africa. Hence the Allies decided to keep De Gaulle and his Free French Forces entirely out of the operation.

To gauge the feeling of the Vichy French forces, Murphy was appointed to the American consulate in Algeria. His covert mission was to determine the mood of the French forces and to make contact with elements that might support an Allied invasion. He succeeded in contacting several French officers, including General Charles Mast, the French commander-in-chief in Algiers. These officers were willing to support the Allies but asked for a clandestine conference with a senior Allied General in Algeria. Major General Mark W. Clark, one of Eisenhower&#x27;s senior commanders, was secretly dispatched to Cherchell in Algeria aboard the British submarine and met with these Vichy French officers on 21 October 1942. Due to the need to maintain secrecy, the French officers were left in the dark about concrete plans, but they gave Clark detailed information about the military situation in Algiers. These officers also asked French General Henri Giraud be moved out of Vichy France to take the lead of the operation.

Eventually the Allies succeeded in slipping Giraud out of Vichy France on HMS &quot;Seraph&quot; to Gibraltar, where Eisenhower had his headquarters, intending to offer him the post of commander in chief of French forces in North Africa after the invasion. However, Giraud would take no position lower than commander in chief of all the invading forces. When he was refused, he decided to remain &quot;a spectator in this affair&quot;.

== Forces ==

=== Allied Forces ===
The Allies organised three amphibious task forces to simultaneously seize the key ports and airports in Morocco and Algeria, targeting Casablanca, Oran and Algiers. 

A Western Task Force (aimed at Casablanca) was composed of American units, with Major General George S. Patton in command and Rear Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt heading the naval operations. This Western Task Force consisted of the U.S. 3rd and 9th Infantry Divisions, and two battalions from the U.S. 2nd Armored Division, 35,000 troops in a convoy of over 100 ships. They were transported directly from the United States in the first of a new series of UG convoys providing logistic support for the North African campaign.

The Centre Task Force, aimed at Oran, included the U.S. 2nd Battalion 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, and the U.S. 1st Armored Division, a total of 18,500 troops. They sailed from the United Kingdom and were commanded by Major General Lloyd Fredendall, the naval forces being commanded by Commodore Thomas Troubridge.

Torch was, for propaganda purposes, a landing by U.S. forces, supported by British warships and aircraft, under the belief that this would be more palatable to French public opinion, than an Anglo-American invasion. For the same reason, Churchill suggested that British soldiers might wear U.S. Army uniforms, and No.6 Commando did so. (Fleet Air Arm aircraft did carry US &quot;star&quot; roundels during the operation, and two British destroyers flew the Stars and Stripes.) In reality, the Eastern Task Force, aimed at Algiers, was commanded by Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson and consisted of a brigade from the British 78th and the U.S. 34th Infantry Divisions, along with two British commando units (No. 1 and No. 6 Commandos), together with the RAF Regiment providing 5 squadrons of infantry and 5 Light anti-aircraft flights, totalling 20,000 troops. During the landing phase, ground forces were to be commanded by U.S. Major General Charles W. Ryder, Commanding General (CG) of the 34th Division and naval forces were commanded by Royal Navy Vice-Admiral Sir Harold Burrough.

Aerial operations were split into two commands, with Royal Air Force aircraft under Air Marshal Sir William Welsh operating east of Cape Tenez in Algeria, and all United States Army Air Forces aircraft under Major General Jimmy Doolittle, who was under the direct command of Major General Patton, operating west of Cape Tenez.

=== Vichy-French Forces ===
The Vichy French had around 125,000 soldiers in the territories as well as coastal artillery, 210 operational but out-of-date tanks and about 500 aircraft, of which 173 were modern Dewoitine D.520 fighters. These forces included 60,000 troops in Morocco, 15,000 in Tunisia, and 50,000 in Algeria. The bulk of the Vichy French Navy was stationed outside North Africa : three battleships and seven cruisers at Toulon and one battleship and three cruisers at Dakar. In North Africa, at Casablanca the incomplete battleship was used as a coastal battery and there was one cruiser, seven destroyers and eight submarines. At Oran there was a force of four destroyers and nine submarines.

== Battle ==
===Eastern task force===
In the early hours of 8 November, French Resistance fighters staged a coup in the city of Algiers. They seized control of the city, but when no American troops appeared in the morning, they lost quickly control to Vichy French forces. Meanwhile, the American consul Robert Murphy attempted to persuade General Alphonse Juin, the senior French Army officer in North Africa, to side with the Allies and place himself under the command of General Giraud. Murphy was treated to a surprise: Admiral François Darlan, the commander of all French forces, was also in Algiers on a private visit, and Juin insisted on contacting Darlan at once. Murphy was unable to persuade them to side with the Allies right away and Darlan contacted Pétain who instructed him to resist.

The invasion commenced with landings on three beaches, two west of Algiers and one east. The landing forces were under the overall command of Major-General Charles W. Ryder, commanding general of the U.S. 34th Infantry Division. The 11th Brigade Group from the British 78th Infantry Division landed on the right hand beach; the US 168th Regimental Combat Team, from the 34th Infantry Division, supported by 6 Commando and most of 1 Commando, landed on the middle beach; and the US 39th Regimental Combat Team, from the US 9th Infantry Division, supported by the remaining 5 troops from 1 Commando, landed on the left hand beach. The 36th Brigade Group from the British 78th Infantry Division stood by in floating reserve. Though some landings went to the wrong beaches, this was immaterial because of the lack of French opposition. Only at Cape Matifou a coastal battery opened fire, and in the forenoon some resistance was offered at the fortresses of Cape Matifou, Duperre and L&#x27;Empereur. At 06:00 the airfield at Maison Blanche was captured and at 10:00 Hawker Hurricanes and Spitfires from Gibraltar started to flow in at the airfield. A second airfield at Blida surrendered the same day to a British plane landing on the airfield.The only fierce fighting took place in the port of Algiers, where in Operation Terminal, the British destroyers and attempted to land a party of US Army Rangers directly onto the dock, to prevent the French destroying the port facilities and scuttling their ships. Heavy artillery fire hit &quot;Malcolm&quot; and forced her to abandon the operation, but &quot;Broke&quot; was able to disembark which secured the power station and oil installations. At 9:15 however she too had to recall the Rangers and abandon the operation due to the heavy artillery fire. As a result of the damage received, &quot;Broke&quot; foundered the next day in bad weather.

By 16:00 the US troops had surrounded Algiers and held the coastal batteries defending the harbour. At 18:40 Juin made an agreement with Ryder to stop the fighting. The next day on 9 November a local cease-fire was negociated and Darlan authorized the Eastern Task Force to use the harbor of Algiers, but in Oran and Morocco the fighting continued. Giraud arrived the same day in Algiers and at noon on 10 November after negotiations with General Clark, Darlan ordered all hostilities to end and to observe neutrality. On secret orders from Pétain, on 11 November he ordered the forces in Tunisia to resist a German invasion.

=== Western task force ===
The Western Task Force landed before daybreak on 8 November 1942, at three points in Morocco: In the South at Safi (Operation Blackstone), in the North at Mehdiya-Port Lyautey (Operation Goalpost) and the main thrust was at the centre in Fedala, close to Casablanca, (Operation Brushwood). Just like in Algiers, there was a failed attempt to neutralize Vichy French command in the morning of 8 November: General Béthouart was unable to convince Admiral Michelier nor General Noguès to side with the Allies. Instead they ordered the Army and Navy to oppose the invasion. 
At Safi the objective was to capture the port facilities intact and to land the Western Task Force&#x27;s medium Sherman tanks, which would be used to reinforce the assault on Casablanca. Two old destroyers, the and USS Bernadou, were to land an assault party in the harbor, whilst troops landed on the beaches would quickly move to the town. The landings were begun without covering fire, in the hope that the French would not resist at all. However, once French coastal batteries opened fire, Allied warships returned fire. Most of the landings occurred behind schedule, but met no opposition on the beaches. Under cover from fire of the battleship and cruiser , &quot;Cole&quot; and &quot;Bernadou&quot; landed their troops and the harbor was captured intact. Safi surrendered on the afternoon of 8 November. By 10 November, the landed troops moved northwards to join the siege of Casablanca.

At Port-Lyautey, the objective was to secure the port and the airfield, so that aircraft could be flown in from Gibraltar and from aircraft carriers. The landings were delayed because of navigational problems and the slow disembarkment of the troops in their landing ships. The first three waves of troops were landed unopposed on five beaches. The cruiser bombarded coastal batteries at Kasbah Mahdiyya. The next waves came under fire from coastal batteries and Vichy-French aircraft. A first attempt by the old destroyer to bring a raiding party inshore on the Sebou River to the airfield, failed on 8 November. Vichy-French reinforcements coming from Rabat were bombarded by the battleship and the cruiser &quot;Savannah&quot;. A second attempt on 10 November to take the airfield was successful and over the next two days, the escort carrier sent 77 Curtiss P-40 Warhawk to the airfield. With the support of aircraft from the escort carrier , the Kasbah battery was taken and ships could come closer to shore to unload supplies. On 11 November The cease-fire ordered by Darlan halted all hostilities.

At Fedala, a small port with a large beach from Casablanca, weather was good but landings were delayed because troopships were not disembarking troops on schedule. The first wave reached shore unopposed at 05:00. Many landing craft were wrecked in the heavy surf or on rocks. At dawn the Vichy-French shore batteries opened fire. By 07:30 fire from the cruisers and with their supporting destroyers, had silenced the shore batteries. At 08:00 when Vichy-French aircraft appeared and attacked, one battery reopened fire. Two Vichy-French destroyers arrived from Casablanca at 08:25 and attacked the American destroyers. By 09:05 the Vichy-French destroyers had been driven away, but all available Vichy-French ships sortied from Casablanca and at 10:00 renewed the attack on the American ships at Fedala. By 11:00 the battle was over, the two American cruisers had either sunk or driven ashore the light cruiser &quot;Primauget&quot;, two flottila leaders and four destroyers. Only one destroyer escaped back to Casablanca. Fedala surrendered at 14:30 and transport ships could move closer to shore to speed up the unloading. Meanwhile the American Covering force with the battleship had appeared before Casablanca and when coastal batteries opened fire at 07:00, the American ships responded at once and damaged the Vichy-French battleship &quot;Jean Bart&quot; with five hits, putting its one operational turret out of action. Of the eleven submarines in port, three were destroyed but the other eight took up attack positions. These submarines attacked &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, the aircraft carrier and the cruisers and , but all their torpedoes missed and six submarines were sunk.

On 9 November the small port of Fedala was in use and troops advanced on Casablanca. Despite having lost 55 aircraft the previous day, attacks by Vichy-French aircraft continued all day. On 10 November, the &quot;Jean Bart&quot; was repaired, but when she opened fire, she was attacked by dive-bombers from the aircraft carrier &quot;Ranger&quot; and heavily damaged by two bomb hits. The Americans surrounded the port of Casablanca by 10 November but waited for the arrival of the tanks from Safi to start an all-out attack planned for 11 November at 07:15. Orders from Darlan, broadcast on 10 November, to cease resistance were ignored until 11 November 06:00, the city surrendered an hour before the final assault was due to take place.

===Center task force===

The Centre Task Force was split between three beaches, two west of Oran and one east. Landings at the westernmost beach were delayed because of a French convoy which appeared while the minesweepers were clearing a path. Some delay and confusion, and damage to landing ships, was caused by the unexpected shallowness of water and sandbars. On all beaches the landings met no resistance. An airborne assault by the 2nd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, which flew all the way from England, over Spain, to Oran, to capture the airfields at Tafraoui and La Sénia failed. Aircraft from three British carriers attacked these airfields in the morning and destroyed seventy airplanes which were armed and ready to take off to attack. In the afternoon the Tafraoui airfield was captured by the quickly advancing troops from the beachheads, and immediately Spitfires were flown in from Gibraltar. The U.S. 1st Ranger Battalion landed east of Oran and quickly captured the shore battery at Arzew.

At the same time of the landings, in the early morning of 8 November, an attempt was made to land U.S. infantry by the sloops and HMS Hartland at the harbor of Oran, in order to prevent destruction of the port facilities and scuttling of ships. But both sloops were sunk by Vichy-French destroyers in the harbour and the operation failed. The Vichy French naval fleet consisting of one flotilla leader, three destroyers, one minesweeper, six submarines and some smaller vessels, broke out from the harbor and attacked the Allied invasion fleet. Over the next two days all these ships were either sunk or driven ashore, only one submarine escaped to Toulon, after an unsuccessful attack on the cruiser . French batteries and the invasion fleet exchanged fire throughout 8–9 November, with French troops defending Oran and the surrounding area stubbornly; bombardment by the British battleship brought about Oran&#x27;s surrender on 10 November.
=== Axis reaction ===
In the central and eastern Atlantic, U-boats had been drawn away to attack trade convoy SL 125, and troop convoys between the UK and North Africa went largely unnoticed. A Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor detected on 31 October a task force of aircraft carriers and cruisers, and on 2 November a returning U-boat reported a troop ship convoy.

On 4 November the Germans became aware of an impeding big operation, they anticipated another convoy run to Malta or an amphibious landing in Libya or at Bougie Bay. Seven U-boats of the Atlantic force were ordered to break through the Strait of Gibraltar and go to the North African coast. Nine Mediterranean U-boats were also deployed to the same region. A total of nineteen U-boats was stationed between the Balearic Islands and Algiers, whilst the Italian Navy deployed twenty-one submarines East of Algiers. On 7 November five German submarines made contact with the British invasion forces but all their attacks missed their target. On 8 November most of these U-boats were operating near Bougie and missed the landings at Algiers. When receiving news of the landings, Dönitz ordered twenty-five of the Atlantic U-boats to move towards the Morocco area and Gibraltar, leaving only ten U-Boats in the North Atlantic and bringing the U-boat main offensive against the convoy lanes to the UK to a virtual standstill. The first wave of nine U-boats to arrive off Morocco ran into a well-prepared defense and achieved little. Only sank three large transport on the anchorage of Fedala, forcing the port to close and ships to divert to Casablanca. The second wave of fourteen U-boats was sent to the area West of Gibraltar, trying to block all traffic in and out the Straits. They sank the escort carrier and the destroyer tender with heavy loss of life. In both theatres of operation, the Mediterranean and Atlantic, the Germans lost eight U-boats, and the Italians two.

Between 8 and 14 November German bomber and torpedo aircraft attacked ships along the North African coast. They sank the troop transport Cathay and Awatea, one landing ship, two transport ships and the sloop . The aircraft carrier and the monitor were damaged by bombs.

==Aftermath==

===Political results===
It quickly became clear that Giraud lacked the authority to take command of the French forces. He preferred to wait in Gibraltar for the results of the landing. However, Darlan in Algiers had such authority. Eisenhower, with the support of Roosevelt and Churchill, made an agreement with Darlan, recognising him as French &quot;High Commissioner&quot; in North Africa. In return, Darlan ordered all French forces in North Africa to cease resistance to the Allies and to cooperate instead. The deal was made on 10 November, and French resistance ceased almost at once. The French troops in North Africa who were not already captured submitted to and eventually joined the Allied forces. Men from French North Africa would see much combat under the Allied banner as part of the French Expeditionary Corps (consisting of 112,000 troops in April 1944) in the Italian campaign, where Maghrebis (mostly Moroccans) made up over 60% of the unit&#x27;s soldiers.

The American press protested, immediately dubbing it the &quot;Darlan Deal&quot;, pointing out that Roosevelt had made a brazen bargain with Hitler&#x27;s puppets in France. If a main goal of Torch had originally been the liberation of North Africa, with this deal that had been jettisoned in favour of safe passage through North Africa. When Adolf Hitler learned of Darlan&#x27;s deal with the Allies, he immediately ordered the occupation of Vichy France.

The Eisenhower/Darlan agreement meant that the officials appointed by the Vichy regime would remain in power in North Africa. No role was provided for Free France, which deeply offended De Gaulle. It also offended much of the British and American public, who regarded all Vichy French as Nazi collaborators. Eisenhower insisted that he had no real choice if his forces were to move on against the Axis in Tunisia, rather than fight the French in Algeria and Morocco. On 24 December, Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle, a French resistance fighter and anti-fascist monarchist, assassinated Darlan. Giraud succeeded Darlan but, like him, replaced few of the Vichy officials. Under pressure from the Allies and De Gaulle&#x27;s supporters, the French régime shifted, with Vichy officials gradually replaced and its more offensive decrees rescinded.
===Military consequences===
====Toulon====
Darlan ordered cease fire in North Africa on 10 November, and the next day the Germans and the Italians invaded Vichy France. One of their goals was to seize the French fleet in Toulon. Darlan invited the French commander of the fleet in Toulon, Jean de Laborde to join the Allies, but instead the French commander ordered the fleet scuttled on 27 November when the Germans entered Toulon.
====Tunisia====
After the German and Italian occupation of Vichy France, the French sided with the Allies, providing a third corps (XIX Corps) for the First Army under the command of Anderson. On 9 November, Axis forces started to build up in French Tunisia, unopposed by the local French forces. After consolidating in Algeria, the Allies began the Tunisia Campaign. Elements of the First Army came to within of Tunis before a counterattack at Djedeida thrust them back. Meanwhile, after their victory at El-Alamein, the Eighth Army under Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery was pushing German and Italian troops under Erwin Rommel steadily towards Tunisia from the East. In January 1943 they reached South Tunisia where Axis troops made a stand at the Mareth Line. In the west, the US II Corps suffered defeats at the Battle of Sidi Bou Zid on 14–15 February and the Battle of Kasserine Pass on 19 February, but Allied reinforcements halted the Axis advance on 22 February. Fredendall was sacked and replaced by George Patton. General Sir Harold Alexander arrived in Tunisia in late February as commander of the new 18th Army Group, which had been created to command the Eighth Army and the Allied forces fighting in Tunisia. The Axis forces attacked eastward at the Battle of Medenine on 6 March but were easily repulsed by the Eighth Army. On 9 March, Rommel left Tunisia to be replaced by Jürgen von Arnim. The First and Eighth Armies attacked again in April. On 6 May the British took Tunis and American forces reached Bizerte on 7 May. By 13 May, all Axis forces in Tunisia had surrendered.

== Later influence ==
Despite Operation Torch&#x27;s role in the war and logistical success, it has been largely overlooked in many popular histories of the war and in general cultural influence.&quot;The Economist&quot; speculated that this was because French forces were the initial enemies of the landing, making for a difficult fit into the war&#x27;s overall narrative in general histories. The operation was America&#x27;s first armed deployment in the Arab world since the Barbary Wars and, according to &quot;The Economist&quot;, laid the foundations for America&#x27;s postwar Middle East policy.

<text>Holyrood Abbey is a ruined abbey of the Canons Regular in Edinburgh, Scotland. The abbey was founded in 1128 by David I of Scotland. During the 15th century, the abbey guesthouse was developed into a royal residence, and after the Scottish Reformation the Palace of Holyroodhouse was expanded further. The abbey church was used as a parish church until the 17th century, and has been ruined since the 18th century. The remaining walls of the abbey lie adjacent to the palace, at the eastern end of Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Mile. The site of the abbey is protected as a scheduled monument.

==Etymology of name==
Rood is a word for the cross on which Jesus Christ was crucified; thus the name Holyrood is equivalent to &quot;Holy Cross&quot;.

==History==
Legend relates that in 1127, while King David I was hunting in the forests to the east of Edinburgh during the Feast of the Cross, he was thrown from his horse after it had been startled by a hart. According to variations of the story, the king was saved from being gored by the charging animal when it was startled either by the miraculous appearance of a holy cross descending from the skies, or by sunlight reflected from a crucifix which suddenly appeared between the hart&#x27;s antlers while the king attempted to grasp them in self-defence. As an act of thanksgiving for his escape, David I founded Holyrood Abbey on the site in 1128.

In the church was preserved, in a golden reliquary, an object said to be a fragment of the True Cross brought by David&#x27;s mother, St. Margaret, from Waltham Abbey, and known thereafter as the Black Rood of Scotland (the Holyrood (cross)). At the battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross, in 1346, this precious relic fell into the hands of the English, and it was placed in Durham Cathedral, from where it disappeared at the Reformation.
The abbey was originally served by a community of Augustinian Canons Regular from Merton Priory. The layout of the original church at Holyrood, now known only from excavations, probably came from the 1125 church at the priory. In 1177 the papal legate Vivian held council here. In 1189 the nobles and prelates of Scotland met here to discuss raising a ransom for William the Lion.
The original abbey church of Holyrood was largely reconstructed between 1195 and 1230. The completed building consisted of a six-bay aisled choir, three-bay transepts with a central tower above, and an eight-bay aisled nave with twin towers at its west front. Some scholars believe the high vaults to be sexpartite (though this is not clearly supported by the 17th century illustrations of the interior). Such a design was probably archaic in that period, and difficult to execute or maintain. Evidence of the construction qualities of the stonemasons has remained on the S aisle vaults, which are set on an almost square plan of 4.4 m (14 feet), but built relatively roughly, with thin flagstones and not much attention to keeping the vertices straight. They were probably plastered, with exposed thin ribs.

Among the chief benefactors of Holyrood during the four centuries of its existence as a religious house were Kings David I and II; Robert, Bishop of St. Andrews; and Fergus, Lord of Galloway.

Around the abbey was a five-mile area of sanctuary, taking in much of Holyrood Park, where debtors and those accused of crimes could appeal to the Bailie of Holyroodhouse for protection. Brass sanctuary stones mark the boundary of the sanctuary on the Royal Mile. Those granted sanctuary would be given lodgings in the buildings around the abbey and obtained the nickname &#x27;Abbey Lairds&#x27;.

The Parliament of Scotland met at the abbey in 1256, 1285, 1327, 1366, 1384, 1389 and 1410. In 1326, Robert the Bruce held parliament here, and there is evidence that Holyrood was being used as a royal residence by 1329. The Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton (1328), which ended the First War of Scottish Independence, was signed by Robert I in the &quot;King&#x27;s Chamber&quot; at Holyrood in March 1328. The abbey&#x27;s position close to Edinburgh Castle meant that it was often visited by Scotland&#x27;s kings, who were lodged in the guest house situated to the west of the abbey cloister.
In the mid-15th century, with the emergence of Edinburgh as the main seat of the royal court and the chief city in the kingdom, the Kings of Scots increasingly used the accommodation at Holyrood for secular purposes. James II and his twin brother Alexander, Duke of Rothesay, were born there in October 1430. James was also crowned at Holyrood in 1437 and building works were carried out before his marriage there in 1449.

Between 1498 and 1501, James IV constructed a royal palace at Holyrood, adjacent to the abbey cloister. The Abbey refectory was converted into a Great Hall for the Palace, and a new refectory was built to the east for the community . In 1507 and 1508 the dances, masques, and banquets concluding the tournaments of the Wild Knight and the Black Lady were held in the converted refectory.

A corps of guards were instituted at the end of the 15th century to guard the monarch and enforce law and order within the precincts of the palace and Abbey Sanctuary called the High Constables and Guard of Honour of the Palace of Holyroodhouse.

===16th century onwards===
Royal influence over the abbey further increased when in 1538 Robert Stewart, the infant, illegitimate son of James V, was appointed as commendator of Holyrood.

During the War of the Rough Wooing, the invading English armies of the Earl of Hertford inflicted structural damage on Holyrood Abbey in 1544 and 1547. Lead was stripped from the roof, the bells were removed, and the contents of the abbey were plundered. In 1559, during the Scottish Reformation, the abbey suffered further damage when a mob destroyed the altars and looted the rest of the church. With the reformation and the end of monastic services, the east end of the abbey church became redundant. In 1569, Adam Bothwell, the commendator of Holyrood, informed the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland that the east end was in such a state of disrepair that the choir and transept should be demolished. This was done the following year, retaining only the nave, which by then was serving as the parish church of the burgh of Canongate. Between 1570 and 1573 an east gable was erected, closing the east end of the former nave, all but two of the windows in the nave were blocked up, the royal tombs were removed to a new royal burial vault in the south aisle and the old east end was demolished.

The abbey was extensively remodelled in 1633 for the coronation of Charles I which was undertaken with full Anglican rites.
In 1686, James VII established a Jesuit college within Holyrood Palace. The following year, the Protestant congregation was moved to the new Kirk of the Canongate, and the abbey was converted into a Roman Catholic Chapel Royal and the chapel of the Order of the Thistle. The abbey church was remodelled according to the plans of James Smith, and was fitted with elaborate thrones and stalls for the individual Knights of the Thistle, carved by Grinling Gibbons. However, in 1688, following the Glorious Revolution, the Edinburgh mob broke into the abbey, entered the Chapel Royal and desecrated the royal tombs.

The association of the church with these events and the absence of a royal court left the building out of public interest. James Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton commissioned the architect John Douglas and the stonemason James McPherson to replace the ageing timber roof trusses by stone vaults and outer stone slabs, the work being carried out between 1758 and 1760. However, this proved to be a disastrous change. The excessive weight of the stone could not be supported by the walls. The strength of stone vaults depends on the containment of their thrusts, which the decayed flying buttresses could not contain any more, and a small movement (less than 1/30 of the span) can cause severe deformation and collapse. It took six years for the deformation to become alarming. This forced the Barons of the Exchequer (the administrators of the Palace) to close the church on safety grounds in 1766, following inspection by William Mylne.

On 2 December 1768 the roof collapsed in two stages, leaving the abbey as it currently stands, a roofless ruin.
The restoration of the abbey has been proposed several times since the 18th century – in 1835 by the architect James Gillespie Graham as a meeting place for the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and, in 1906, as a chapel for the Knights of the Thistle – but both proposals were rejected.

In July 1829, the ruins of the Holyrood Chapel were visited by Felix Mendelssohn. Holyrood, as Mendelssohn related to his family in a letter, served as inspiration for his &quot;Scottish Symphony&quot;.

==In art==
The abbey ruins are depicted in the 19th-century painting &quot;The Ruins of Holyrood Chapel&quot; by the French artist Louis Daguerre.

==In literature==
In March 1825, a moonlit scene entitled &#x27;Ruins of Holyrood Chapel&#x27; was put into the Diorama, Regent&#x27;s Park, London, inspiring the poem &#x27;Holyrood&#x27; by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, printed in The London Literary Gazette. Although the article in the Gazette does not say so specifically, this is presumably the display mentioned in the article on the work by Louis Daguerre above.

<text>Mitchell David Kapor ( ; born November 1, 1950) is an American entrepreneur best known for his work as an application developer in the early days of the personal computer software industry, later founding Lotus, where he was instrumental in developing the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet. He left Lotus in 1986. In 1990 with John Perry Barlow and John Gilmore, he co-founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and served as its chairman until 1994. In 2003, he became the founding chair of the Mozilla Foundation, creator of the open source web browser Firefox. Kapor has been an investor in the personal computing industry, and supporter of social causes via Kapor Capital and the Kapor Center. He serves on the board of SMASH, a non-profit founded by his wife, Freada Kapor Klein, to help underrepresented scholars hone their STEM knowledge while building personal networks and skills for careers in tech and the sciences.

==Early life and education==
Kapor was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Freeport, New York on Long Island, where he graduated from high school in 1967. He received a B.A. from Yale College in 1971 and studied psychology, linguistics, and computer science in an interdisciplinary major, also attending the Boston-based Beacon College, which had a satellite campus in Washington, D.C. at the time. He began but did not complete a master&#x27;s degree at the MIT Sloan School of Management but later served on the faculty of the MIT Media Lab and the University of California, Berkeley School of Information.

==Career==
===Lotus===
Kapor and his business partner Jonathan Sachs founded Lotus in 1982 with backing from Ben Rosen. Lotus&#x27; first product was presentation software for the Apple II known as Lotus Executive Briefing System. Kapor founded Lotus after leaving his post as head of development at VisiCorp, the distributors of the VisiCalc spreadsheet, and selling all his rights to VisiPlot and VisiTrend to VisiCorp.

Shortly after Kapor left VisiCorp, he and Sachs produced an integrated spreadsheet and graphics program. Even though IBM and VisiCorp had a collaboration agreement whereby VisiCalc was being shipped simultaneously with the PC, Lotus had a clearly superior product. Lotus released Lotus 1-2-3 on January 26, 1983. Its name referred to the three ways the product could be used: as a spreadsheet, graphics package, and database manager. In practice, the latter two functions were less often used, but 1-2-3 was the most powerful spreadsheet program available.

Lotus was almost immediately successful, becoming the world&#x27;s third-largest microcomputer software company in 1983 with $53 million in sales in its first year, compared to its business plan forecast of $1 million. Jerome Want says:

Under founder and CEO Mitch Kapor, Lotus was a company with few rules and fewer internal bureaucratic barriers... Kapor decided that he was no longer suited to running a company, and [in 1986] he replaced himself with Jim Manzi.

===Digital rights activism===
Kapor co-founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation in 1990 and was its chairman until 1994. EFF defends civil liberties in the digital world and works to ensure that rights and freedoms are enhanced and protected as the use of technology grows.

Kapor attended the first Wikimania in 2005.

===Investments===
Kapor was the founding investor in UUNET, one of the first, and the largest among, early Internet service providers; in RealNetworks, the Internet&#x27;s first streaming media company; and in Linden Lab, maker of the first successful virtual world, &quot;Second Life&quot;. He was also founding chair of the Commercial Internet eXchange (CIX).

In 2003, he became the founding chair of the Mozilla Foundation, creator of the open source web browser Firefox.

He serves on the advisory board of the Sunlight Foundation. In May 2009, after founder Susan P. Crawford joined the Obama administration, Kapor took over chairmanship of OneWebDay—the &quot;Earth Day for the internet&quot;. In 1996, the Computer History Museum named him a Museum Fellow &quot;for his development of Lotus 1-2-3, the first major software application for the IBM PC&quot;. He founded the Mitchell Kapor Foundation to support his philanthropic interests in environmental health.

As an active angel investor, Kapor participated in the initial rounds of Dropcam, Twilio, Asana, Cleanify and Uber.

===Kapor Center and Kapor Capital===
Kapor founded the Kapor Center in 2000 as an institution focused on tech inclusion and social impact. The institution&#x27;s mission is to invest in social and financial capital in vital non-profit organizations.

A part of the Kapor Center, Kapor Capital is its venture capital arm, and has operated since 2011. As of 2018, it has made over 160 investments, primarily in information technology seed-stage startups, with a particular focus on diversity.

Since 2016, the Kapor Center for Social Impact, Kapor Capital, and &quot;SMASH&quot; have been located in the Uptown neighborhood of Oakland, CA.

===Diversity in technology===
In August 2015, Mitch and Freada Kapor announced they would invest $40 million over three years to accelerate their work to make the tech ecosystem more inclusive.

In addition to his roles at Kapor Capital and Kapor Center, Mitch currently serves on the board of SMASH, whose mission is to enhance equal opportunity in education and the workplace, and sits on the advisory board of Generation Investment Management, a firm whose vision is to embed sustainability into the mainstream capital markets.

==Personal life==
Kapor is married to Freada Kapor Klein and resides in Oakland and Healdsburg, California. Both served on the board of trustees of the Summer Science Program from 2004 to 2006. He was a student of the program in 1966.

<text>In probability theory, the birthday problem asks for the probability that, in a set of randomly chosen people, at least two will share the same birthday. The birthday paradox is the counterintuitive fact that only 23 people are needed for that probability to exceed 50%.

The birthday paradox is a veridical paradox: it seems wrong at first glance but is, in fact, true. While it may seem surprising that only 23 individuals are required to reach a 50% probability of a shared birthday, this result is made more intuitive by considering that the birthday comparisons will be made between every possible pair of individuals. With 23 individuals, there are  = 253 pairs to consider, more than half the number of days in a year.

Real-world applications for the birthday problem include a cryptographic attack called the birthday attack, which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function, as well as calculating the approximate risk of a hash collision existing within the hashes of a given size of population.

The problem is generally attributed to Harold Davenport in about 1927, though he did not publish it at the time. Davenport did not claim to be its discoverer &quot;because he could not believe that it had not been stated earlier&quot;. The first publication of a version of the birthday problem was by Richard von Mises in 1939.

==Calculating the probability==
From a permutations perspective, let the event be the probability of finding a group of 23 people without any repeated birthdays. Where the event is the probability of finding a group of 23 people with at least two people sharing same birthday, . This is such that is the ratio of the total number of birthdays, formula_1, without repetitions and order matters (e.g. for a group of 2 people, mm/dd birthday format, one possible outcome is formula_2) divided by the total number of birthdays with repetition and order matters, formula_3, as it is the total space of outcomes from the experiment (e.g. 2 people, one possible outcome is formula_4). Therefore formula_1 and formula_3 are permutations.

:formula_7

Another way the birthday problem can be solved is by asking for an approximate probability that in a group of people at least two have the same birthday. For simplicity, leap years, twins, selection bias, and seasonal and weekly variations in birth rates are generally disregarded, and instead it is assumed that there are 365 possible birthdays, and that each person&#x27;s birthday is equally likely to be any of these days, independent of the other people in the group.

For independent birthdays, a uniform distribution of birthdays minimizes the probability of two people in a group having the same birthday. Any unevenness increases the likelihood of two people sharing a birthday. However real-world birthdays are not sufficiently uneven to make much change: the real-world group size necessary to have a greater than 50% chance of a shared birthday is 23, as in the theoretical uniform distribution.

The goal is to compute , the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate , the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because and are the only two possibilities and are also mutually exclusive, 

Here is the calculation of for 23 people. Let the 23 people be numbered 1 to 23. The event that all 23 people have different birthdays is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22. Let these events be called Event 2, Event 3, and so on. Event 1 is the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using conditional probability: the probability of Event 2 is , as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1. Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is , as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2. This continues until finally the probability of Event 23 given that all preceding events occurred is . Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that is equal to the product of these individual probabilities:
The terms of equation () can be collected to arrive at:
Evaluating equation () gives 

Therefore,  (50.7297%).

This process can be generalized to a group of people, where is the probability of at least two of the people sharing a birthday. It is easier to first calculate the probability that all birthdays are &quot;different&quot;. According to the pigeonhole principle, is zero when . When :

:formula_8

where is the factorial operator, is the binomial coefficient and denotes permutation.

The equation expresses the fact that the first person has no one to share a birthday, the second person cannot have the same birthday as the first , the third cannot have the same birthday as either of the first two , and in general the th birthday cannot be the same as any of the preceding birthdays.

The event of at least two of the persons having the same birthday is complementary to all birthdays being different. Therefore, its probability is

:formula_9

The following table shows the probability for some other values of (for this table, the existence of leap years is ignored, and each birthday is assumed to be equally likely):


==Approximations==
The Taylor series expansion of the exponential function (the constant )

:formula_10

provides a first-order approximation for for formula_11:

:formula_12

To apply this approximation to the first expression derived for , set . Thus,
:formula_13

Then, replace with non-negative integers for each term in the formula of until , for example, when ,
: formula_14

The first expression derived for can be approximated as

:formula_15

Therefore,

:formula_16

An even coarser approximation is given by

:formula_17

which, as the graph illustrates, is still fairly accurate.

According to the approximation, the same approach can be applied to any number of &quot;people&quot; and &quot;days&quot;. If rather than 365 days there are , if there are persons, and if , then using the same approach as above we achieve the result that if is the probability that at least two out of people share the same birthday from a set of available days, then:

:formula_18

===Simple exponentiation===
The probability of any two people not having the same birthday is . In a room containing &quot;n&quot; people, there are pairs of people, i.e. events. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be approximated by assuming that these events are independent and hence by multiplying their probability together. Being independent would be equivalent to picking with replacement, any pair of people in the world, not just in a room. In short can be multiplied by itself times, which gives us

:formula_19

Since this is the probability of no one having the same birthday, then the probability of someone sharing a birthday is

:formula_20

And for the group of 23 people, the probability of sharing is

:formula_21

===Poisson approximation===
Applying the Poisson approximation for the binomial on the group of 23 people,

:formula_22

so

:formula_23

The result is over 50% as previous descriptions. This approximation is the same as the one above based on the Taylor expansion that uses .

===Square approximation===
A good rule of thumb which can be used for mental calculation is the relation

:formula_24

which can also be written as

:formula_25

which works well for probabilities less than or equal to . In these equations, is the number of days in a year.

For instance, to estimate the number of people required for a chance of a shared birthday, we get

:formula_26

Which is not too far from the correct answer of 23.

===Approximation of number of people===
This can also be approximated using the following formula for the &quot;number&quot; of people necessary to have at least a chance of matching:
:formula_27
This is a result of the good approximation that an event with probability will have a chance of occurring at least once if it is repeated times.

===Probability table===
:

The lighter fields in this table show the number of hashes needed to achieve the given probability of collision (column) given a hash space of a certain size in bits (row). Using the birthday analogy: the &quot;hash space size&quot; resembles the &quot;available days&quot;, the &quot;probability of collision&quot; resembles the &quot;probability of shared birthday&quot;, and the &quot;required number of hashed elements&quot; resembles the &quot;required number of people in a group&quot;. One could also use this chart to determine the minimum hash size required (given upper bounds on the hashes and probability of error), or the probability of collision (for fixed number of hashes and probability of error).

For comparison, to is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk. In theory, 128-bit hash functions, such as MD5, should stay within that range until about documents, even if its possible outputs are many more.

==An upper bound on the probability and a lower bound on the number of people==
The argument below is adapted from an argument of Paul Halmos.

As stated above, the probability that no two birthdays coincide is

:formula_28

As in earlier paragraphs, interest lies in the smallest such that ; or equivalently, the smallest such that .

Using the inequality in the above expression we replace with . This yields

:formula_29

Therefore, the expression above is not only an approximation, but also an upper bound of . The inequality

:formula_30

implies . Solving for gives

:formula_31

Now, is approximately 505.997, which is barely below 506, the value of attained when . Therefore, 23 people suffice. Incidentally, solving for &quot;n&quot; gives the approximate formula of Frank H. Mathis cited above.

This derivation only shows that &quot;at most&quot; 23 people are needed to ensure the chances of a birthday match are at least even; it leaves open the possibility that is 22 or less could also work.

==Generalizations==

===Arbitrary number of days===
Given a year with days, the generalized birthday problem asks for the minimal number such that, in a set of randomly chosen people, the probability of a birthday coincidence is at least 50%. In other words, is the minimal integer such that

:formula_32

The classical birthday problem thus corresponds to determining . The first 99 values of are given here :

A similar calculation shows that = 23 when is in the range 341–372.

A number of bounds and formulas for have been published.
For any , the number satisfies

:formula_33

These bounds are optimal in the sense that the sequence 
gets arbitrarily close to
:formula_34
while it has
:formula_35
as its maximum, taken for .

The bounds are sufficiently tight to give the exact value of in most of the cases. For example, for 365 these bounds imply that and 23 is the only integer in that range. In general, it follows from these bounds that always equals either
:formula_36
where denotes the ceiling function.
The formula

:formula_37

holds for 73% of all integers . The formula

:formula_38

holds for almost all , i.e., for a set of integers with asymptotic density 1.

The formula

:formula_39

holds for all , but it is conjectured that there are infinitely many counterexamples to this formula.

The formula

:formula_40

holds for all , and it is conjectured that this formula holds for all .

===More than two people sharing a birthday===
It is possible to extend the problem to ask how many people in a group are necessary for there to be a greater than 50% probability that at least 3, 4, 5, etc. of the group share the same birthday.

The first few values are as follows: &gt;50% probability of 3 people sharing a birthday - 88 people; &gt;50% probability of 4 people sharing a birthday - 187 people .

===Everyone shares a birthday===
The strong birthday problem asks for the number of people that need to be gathered together before there is a 50% chance that &quot;everyone&quot; in the gathering shares their birthday with at least one other person. For d=365 days the answer is 3,064 people.

The number of people needed for arbitrary number of days is given by 

===Probability of a shared birthday (collision)===
The birthday problem can be generalized as follows:
:Given random integers drawn from a discrete uniform distribution with range , what is the probability that at least two numbers are the same? ( gives the usual birthday problem.)

The generic results can be derived using the same arguments given above.
:formula_41

Conversely, if denotes the number of random integers drawn from to obtain a probability that at least two numbers are the same, then
:formula_42

The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions: the expected number of -bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not , but rather only . This is exploited by birthday attacks on cryptographic hash functions and is the reason why a small number of collisions in a hash table are, for all practical purposes, inevitable.

The theory behind the birthday problem was used by Zoe Schnabel under the name of capture-recapture statistics to estimate the size of fish population in lakes. The birthday problem and its generalizations are also useful tools for modelling coincidences.

====Probability of a unique collision====

The classic birthday problem allows for more than two people to share a particular birthday or for there to be matches on multiple days. The probability that among people there is exactly one pair of individuals with a matching birthday given possible days is

: formula_43

Unlike the standard birthday problem, as increases the probability reaches a maximum value before decreasing. For example, for , the probability of a unique match has a maximum value of 0.3864 occurring when .

====Generalization to multiple types of people====

The basic problem considers all trials to be of one &quot;type&quot;. The birthday problem has been generalized to consider an arbitrary number of types. In the simplest extension there are two types of people, say men and women, and the problem becomes characterizing the probability of a shared birthday between at least one man and one woman. (Shared birthdays between two men or two women do not count.) The probability of no shared birthdays here is

:formula_44

where and are Stirling numbers of the second kind. Consequently, the desired probability is .

This variation of the birthday problem is interesting because there is not a unique solution for the total number of people . For example, the usual 50% probability value is realized for both a 32-member group of 16 men and 16 women and a 49-member group of 43 women and 6 men.

==Other birthday problems==

===First match===
A related question is, as people enter a room one at a time, which one is most likely to be the first to have the same birthday as someone already in the room? That is, for what is maximum? The answer is 20—if there is a prize for first match, the best position in line is 20th.

===Same birthday as you===

In the birthday problem, neither of the two people is chosen in advance. By contrast, the probability that &quot;at least one other person&quot; in a room of other people has the same birthday as a &quot;particular&quot; person (for example, you) is given by

: formula_45
and for general by
: formula_46

In the standard case of , substituting gives about 6.1%, which is less than 1 chance in 16. For a greater than 50% chance that &quot;at least&quot; one other person in a roomful of people has the same birthday as &quot;you&quot;, would need to be at least 253. This number is significantly higher than : the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among the other people in the room.

=== Number of people with a shared birthday ===
For any one person in a group of &quot;n&quot; people the probability that he or she shares his birthday with someone else is formula_47, as explained above. The expected number of people with a shared (non-unique) birthday can now be calculated easily by multiplying that probability by the number of people (&quot;n&quot;), so it is:
: formula_48 
(This multiplication can be done this way because of the linearity of the expected value of indicator variables). This implies that the expected number of people with a non-shared (unique) birthday is:
: formula_49 
Similar formulas can be derived for the expected number of people who share with three, four, etc. other people.

=== Number of people until every birthday is achieved ===
The expected number of people needed until every birthday is achieved is called the Coupon collector&#x27;s problem. It can be calculated by , where is the th harmonic number. For 365 possible dates (the birthday problem), the answer is 2365.

===Near matches===
Another generalization is to ask for the probability of finding at least one pair in a group of people with birthdays within calendar days of each other, if there are equally likely birthdays.

:formula_50

The number of people required so that the probability that some pair will have a birthday separated by days or fewer will be higher than 50% is given in the following table:

Thus in a group of just seven random people, it is more likely than not that two of them will have a birthday within a week of each other.

=== Number of days with a certain number of birthdays ===

==== Number of days with at least one birthday ====
The expected number of different birthdays, i.e. the number of days that are at least one person&#x27;s birthday, is:
:formula_51
This follows from the expected number of days that are no one&#x27;s birthday:
:formula_52
which follows from the probability that a particular day is no one&#x27;s birthday, , easily summed because of the linearity of the expected value.

For instance, with , you should expect about 21 different birthdays when there are 22 people, or 46 different birthdays when there are 50 people. When there are 1000 people, there will be around 341 different birthdays (24 unclaimed birthdays).

==== Number of days with at least two birthdays ====
The above can be generalized from the distribution of the number of people with their birthday on any particular day, which is a Binomial distribution with probability . Multiplying the relevant probability by will then give the expected number of days. For example, the expected number of days which are shared; i.e. which are at least two (i.e. not zero and not one) people&#x27;s birthday is:

formula_53

===Number of people who repeat a birthday===
The probability that the th integer randomly chosen from will repeat at least one previous choice equals above. The expected total number of times a selection will repeat a previous selection as such integers are chosen equals

:formula_54
This can be seen to equal the number of people minus the expected number of different birthdays.

===Average number of people to get at least one shared birthday===
In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the &quot;average&quot; number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[ people have at least one shared birthday], this &quot;average&quot; is determining the mean of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation, which asks for the median. The problem is relevant to several hashing algorithms analyzed by Donald Knuth in his book &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;. It may be shown that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size , the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of &quot;some&quot; individual has expected value , where

: formula_55

The function

: formula_56

has been studied by Srinivasa Ramanujan and has asymptotic expansion:

: formula_57

With days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is , somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required

An analysis using indicator random variables can provide a simpler but approximate analysis of this problem. For each pair (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;) for k people in a room, we define the indicator random variable &quot;Xij&quot;, for formula_58, by

formula_59

formula_60

Let &quot;X&quot; be a random variable counting the pairs of individuals with the same birthday.

formula_61

formula_62

For , if , the expected number of pairs of individuals with the same birthday is  ≈ 1.0356. Therefore, we can expect at least one matching pair with at least 28 people.

In the 2014 FIFA World Cup, each of the 32 squads had 23 players. An analysis of the official squad lists suggested that 16 squads had pairs of players sharing birthdays, and of these 5 squads had two pairs: Argentina, France, Iran, South Korea and Switzerland each had two pairs, and Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Spain and USA each with one pair.

Voracek, Tran and Formann showed that the majority of people markedly overestimate the number of people that is necessary to achieve a given probability of people having the same birthday, and markedly underestimate the probability of people having the same birthday when a specific sample size is given. Further results showed that psychology students and women did better on the task than casino visitors/personnel or men, but were less confident about their estimates.

===Reverse problem===
The reverse problem is to find, for a fixed probability ,
the greatest for which the probability is smaller than the given , or the smallest for which the probability is greater than the given .

Taking the above formula for , one has

:formula_63

The following table gives some sample calculations.
Some values falling outside the bounds have been colored to show that the approximation is not always exact.

==Partition problem==
A related problem is the partition problem, a variant of the knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one tonne). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible?

Often, people&#x27;s intuition is that the answer is above . Most people&#x27;s intuition is that it is in the thousands or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23.

The reason is that the correct comparison is to the number of partitions of the weights into left and right. There are different partitions for weights, and the left sum minus the right sum can be thought of as a new random quantity for each partition. The distribution of the sum of weights is approximately Gaussian, with a peak at and width , so that when is approximately equal to the transition occurs. 223 − 1 is about 4 million, while the width of the distribution is only 5 million.

==In fiction==
Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s 1961 novel &quot;A Fall of Moondust&quot; contains a section where the main characters, trapped underground for an indefinite amount of time, are celebrating a birthday and find themselves discussing the validity of the birthday problem. As stated by a physicist passenger: &quot;If you have a group of more than twenty-four people, the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday.&quot; Eventually, out of 22 present, it is revealed that two characters share the same birthday, May 23.

<text>The Dark Knight Returns (alternatively titled Batman: The Dark Knight Returns but originally titled Batman: The Dark Knight) is a 1986 four-issue comic book miniseries starring Batman, written by Frank Miller, illustrated by Miller and Klaus Janson, with color by Lynn Varley, and published by DC Comics. It tells an alternative story of Bruce Wayne who, at 55 years old, returns from a decade of retirement to fight crime while facing opposition from the Gotham City police force and the United States government. The story also features the return of classic foes Two-Face and the Joker, and culminates in a confrontation with Superman, who is now a pawn of the government.

When originally published, the series was simply titled Batman: The Dark Knight, with a different title for each issue (&quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight Triumphant&quot;, &quot;Hunt the Dark Knight&quot;, and &quot;The Dark Knight Falls&quot;), but when the series was collected into a single volume, the title of the first issue was applied to the entire series. Some of the earliest collected editions also bore the shorter series title. The story introduces Carrie Kelley as the new Robin and the hyper-violent street gang known as the Mutants. In the Pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; DC Multiverse, the events of &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; and its associated titles were designated to occur on Earth-31.

The miniseries has since been followed by a number of sequels: &quot;The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight III: The Master Race&quot;, and &quot;Dark Knight Returns: The Golden Child&quot;. A one-shot prequel, &quot;Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade&quot;, takes place ten years before the original series. Both &quot;&quot; and &quot;All Star Batman &amp; Robin, the Boy Wonder&quot;, are considered by Miller to be canon. Likewise, &quot;&quot; takes place in the &quot;Dark Knight&quot; universe.

&quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential Batman stories ever made, as well as one of the greatest works of comic art in general, and has been noted for helping reintroduce a darker and more mature-oriented version of the character (and superheroes in general) to pop culture during the 1980s. Various elements of the series have since been incorporated into depictions of Batman in other media, while a direct animated adaptation of the story, , was released as a two-part film across 2012 and 2013.

==Plot==
===Part 1: The Dark Knight Returns===
In a dystopian version of 1986, Bruce Wayne, aged 55, has given up the mantle of Batman after the death of Jason Todd 10 years prior. Crime is running rampant throughout Gotham City, much of which is being committed by a gang of juvenile delinquents called &quot;The Mutants&quot;. After watching news reports about the Mutants&#x27; crimes, Wayne decides to return to his role as a vigilante. He stops multiple assaults – including one on two young girls, Carrie Kelley and her friend Michelle – and targets the Mutants. Batman&#x27;s return is reported on the news and stimulates his archenemy, the Joker, to awaken from catatonia at Arkham Asylum.

While foiling an armed robbery, Batman learns that the criminals are working for Harvey Dent. Previously known as Two-Face, Dent underwent extensive therapy and plastic surgery to reenter society before disappearing. Batman informs close-to-retirement Commissioner James &quot;Jim&quot; Gordon that Dent may be planning a larger scheme. Soon after, Dent announces his intention to hold Gotham ransom with a bomb. After Batman defeats Dent and his goons, he discovers that Dent&#x27;s mind has completely warped into his Two-Face persona.

===Part 2: The Dark Knight Triumphant===
At the White House, Superman and President Ronald Reagan discuss Batman&#x27;s actions, with the latter suggesting he may have to be arrested. At Gotham, Kelley, inspired by Batman, buys an imitation Robin costume and searches for him. Batman attacks the Mutants at the city dump with the Batmobile, but the Mutant Leader goads him into a hand-to-hand fight. Batman, due to his age and a decade of physical inactivity, is beaten and almost killed. Kelley creates a diversion that allows her and Batman to return to the Batcave, where Wayne&#x27;s butler Alfred Pennyworth tends to his wounds. Impressed with her bravery, Wayne decides to make Kelley his new protegee. Batman strategically defeats the Mutant Leader in a fight surrounded by the Mutants. Seeing Batman defeat their leader, most of the Mutants disband into smaller gangs. One of these gangs renames itself the &quot;Sons of the Batman&quot;, using excessive violence against criminals.

===Part 3: Hunt the Dark Knight===
Clark Kent talks with Wayne and is then deployed by Washington to the Latin American country of Corto Maltese, where he fights Soviet combat forces in a conflict that may escalate into World War III.

Gordon&#x27;s successor as commissioner, Captain Ellen Yindel, declares Batman a wanted criminal for his vigilantism. Meanwhile, Joker manipulates his caretakers to allow him onto a television talk show, where he murders everyone with his trademark toxin and escapes. Batman and Robin (Kelley) track him to a county fair while evading a Gotham police pursuit. Batman fights Joker, vowing to stop him permanently, feeling responsible for every murder the villain has committed. Batman paralyzes Joker but is unable to take his life. Disappointed with Batman&#x27;s refusal to kill him, Joker breaks his own neck and dies.

===Part 4: The Dark Knight Falls===
A citywide manhunt for Batman begins. Elsewhere, Superman diverts a Soviet nuclear warhead which detonates in a desert, nearly killing him in the process, and survives only by absorbing the sun&#x27;s energy from the plants in a nearby jungle. The United States is hit by an electromagnetic pulse as a result and descends into chaos during the following blackout. In Gotham, Batman and Robin turn the remaining Mutants and Sons of the Batman into a non-lethal vigilante gang, making Gotham the safest city in the country. The U.S. government orders Superman to take Batman into custody. Superman demands to meet Batman, and Wayne chooses Crime Alley.

Superman tries to reason with Batman, but Batman uses his technological inventions to fight him on equal ground. During the battle, Superman compromises Batman&#x27;s exoframe. However, an aging Oliver Queen manages to shoot Superman with a kryptonite-tipped arrow to weaken him. Standing over the defeated Superman, Batman has a sudden heart attack, apparently dying. Alfred destroys the Batcave and Wayne Manor before suffering a fatal stroke, exposing Batman as Bruce Wayne, whose fortune has disappeared. After Wayne&#x27;s funeral, it is revealed that his death was staged using an antiarrhythmic agent that suspended his vital life signs. Clark attends the funeral and winks at the disguised Carrie after hearing Wayne&#x27;s heartbeat. Some time afterward, Bruce Wayne leads Robin, Queen, and the rest of his followers into the caverns beyond the Batcave and prepares to continue his war on crime.

==Background and creation==
Since the 1950s, when the Comics Code Authority was established, the character of Batman had drifted from his darker, more serious roots. It was not until the 1970s when the character began to feature in darker stories once again; however, Batman was still commonly associated with the campy theme of the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; TV series, and was regarded more as a father figure to Robin rather than as his original identity as a vigilante.

In the early 1980s, DC Comics promoted Batman group editor Dick Giordano to editorial director for the company. Writer-artist Frank Miller was recruited to create &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. Giordano said he worked with Miller on the story&#x27;s plot, and said, &quot;[t]he version that was finally done was about his fourth or fifth draft. The basic storyline was the same but there were a lot of detours along the way.&quot;

&quot;With Batman, you&#x27;ve got a character that you can describe in just a few seconds: His parents were murdered by criminals; he&#x27;s warring on crime for the rest of his life,&quot; Miller explained in the documentary &quot;Comic Book Confidential.&quot; &quot;He was created in 1938, and the character was just ruthless in his methods, terrifying to criminals. Over the years, that got softened and softened, because people started thinking that comics had to be just for kids... and Batman had to be made much nicer. And eventually, no kid could relate to him anymore.&quot;

During the creation of the series, fellow comics writer/artist John Byrne told Miller, &quot;Robin must be a girl&quot;, and Miller agreed. Miller said that the comic series&#x27; plot was inspired by Dirty Harry, specifically the 1983 film &quot;Sudden Impact&quot;, in which Dirty Harry returns to crime-fighting after a lengthy convalescence. The series employed a 16-panel grid for its pages. Each page was composed of either a combination of 16 panels, or anywhere between sixteen and one panel per page. Giordano left the project halfway through because of disagreements over production deadlines. Comics historian Les Daniels wrote that Miller&#x27;s idea of ignoring deadlines was &quot;the culmination of the quest towards artistic independence&quot;.

While the comic&#x27;s ending features Batman faking his death and leading up the Sons of Batman to continue with his crusade against crime, symbolizing that Bruce Wayne dies but Batman lives on, this wasn&#x27;t the original intention. During the MCM London Comic Con 2018, Miller revealed that in his original plans for the ending of &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, Batman was going to be gunned down by the police while fighting them, but the story got away from him and changed his mind.

The issues of &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; were presented in packaging that included extra pages, square binding, and glossy paper to highlight the watercolor paintings by colorist Lynn Varley.

== Reception ==
Despite the cost of the single-issue packaging, &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; sold well. Pricing it at $2.95 an issue, DC Comics promoted &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; as a &quot;thought-provoking action story&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; said the series&#x27; depiction of a &quot;semi-retired Batman [who] is unsure about his crime-fighting abilities&quot; was an example of trying to appeal to &quot;today&#x27;s skeptical readers&quot;. More than one million comics were printed.

Retrospectively, the series is today widely considered one of the greatest works in the comic medium. IGN Comics ranked &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; first on a list of the 25 greatest Batman graphic novels and called &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; &quot;a true masterpiece of storytelling&quot; with &quot;[s]cene after unforgettable scene.&quot; In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; chose the collected edition as one of the 10 best English language graphic novels ever written. Forbidden Planet placed the collected issue at number one on its &quot;50 Best of the Best Graphic Novels&quot; list. Writer Matthew K. Manning in the &quot;1980s&quot; chapter of &quot;DC Comics: Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle&quot; (2010) called the series &quot;arguably the best Batman story of all time.&quot; It was placed second in a poll among comic book academics conducted by the Sequart Organization.

The series also garnered some negative reviews. In April 2010, Nicolas Slayton from Comics Bulletin ranked &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; second in his Tuesday Top Ten feature&#x27;s Top 10 Overrated Comic Books behind &quot;Watchmen&quot;. Slayton wrote, &quot;[t]here is no central plot to the comic, leaving only a forced fight scene between Superman and Batman as an out of place climax to the story.&quot; &quot;Gone are the traits that define Batman,&quot; he said, also citing &quot;misuse of the central character.&quot;

==Influence==
The immense popularity of &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; served both to return the character of Batman to a central role in pop culture, but also (along with &quot;Watchmen&quot;) started the era known as the Dark Age of Comic Books (also known as the Modern Age and the Iron Age). The grim, seedy versions of Gotham and Batman updated the character&#x27;s identity from the campy Adam West version from the 1960s Batman TV series, and proved critically and commercially successful enough that a new wave of &quot;dark&quot; superheroes were either created or re-popularized, and preexisting heroes were redesigned or retooled to fit this new trend.

&quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; was one of the two comic books, alongside &quot;Watchmen&quot;, that inspired designer Vincent Connare when he created the Comic Sans font.

In 2022, Heritage Auctions sold the original cover art for the first issue of Miller&#x27;s &quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns&quot; for $2.4 million, making it the most expensive mainstream American comic book cover art sold publicly.

But a terrifying evil has returned to Gotham City, and Lara and Carrie must team up to stop this growing threat—and they have a secret weapon. Young Jonathan Kent, &quot;The Golden Child,&quot; has a power inside of him unlike anything the world has ever seen.

According to Miller, the unfinished series &quot;All Star Batman &amp; Robin, the Boy Wonder&quot; can be considered a prequel.

In 1994, this version of Batman appeared in the &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time&quot; crossover event playing a small role. In March 2018, he appeared in a brief cameo in the sixth and final issue of the &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot; event.

In 2018, it was announced that this version of Robin, Carrie Kelley, would receive a spin-off in the form of a young adult graphic novel to be written by Miller with art from Ben Caldwell. In November 2021, when Miller said &quot;[The Carrie Kelley book] is shaping up great; Ben is just a powder keg of talent. It&#x27;d probably be out now but it just keeps growing, due to his enthusiasm and output. I&#x27;m already kind of tugging at his sleeve about doing something else after this.&quot;

In 2023, Miller&#x27;s Batman appeared in Batman #135, which marked the milestone of the 900th issue. He joined forces with various versions of Batman from different media across the multiverse.

==In other media==
===Television===
====Live-action====
* Stephen Amell appears as an older Oliver Queen in the &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; episode &quot;Star City 2046&quot;, with a grey goatee and missing his left arm, a nod to the portrayal of the character in &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. This version of Oliver appears again in the crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; which designates the events of &quot;Star City 2046&quot; not just as an alternate timeline but taking place on Earth-16.
* In the episode &quot;The Gentle Art of Making Enemies&quot; of &quot;Gotham&quot;, the show&#x27;s first Proto-Joker, Jerome Valeska (played by Cameron Monaghan), confronts Bruce Wayne in a house of mirrors after the GCPD raid Jerome&#x27;s carnival populated by his cult followers, which pays homage to Batman and Joker&#x27;s final confrontation in &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. In addition, Monaghan&#x27;s performance as the second Proto-Joker, Jeremiah Valeska, took some influence from the Joker in the comic.
* In the &quot;Batwoman&quot; episode of the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; crossover, Kevin Conroy appears as Bruce Wayne from Earth-99. This version is more violent to the point of killing, as Joker is dead. While confronting Supergirl, Bruce quotes the comic while talking about how Clark always said &quot;yes&quot; to anyone with a badge or a flag, giving them too much power. Bruce says &quot;Life only makes sense if you force it to&quot; before attacking Supergirl with Kryptonite.
* In the &quot;Gotham Knights&quot; TV series, Carrie Kelly plays a prominent role as one of the main characters. In the episode &quot;Under Pressure&quot;, Carrie defeats the Mutant gang leader who is given the name of Vernon Wagner, stoking conflict between the Mutant gang against the GCPD. In the same episode, Carrie relates the circumstances of her first meeting with Batman, which seemingly involve Batman being tossed by the Mutant gang into her fire escape outside her window, a description that is identical to the comic&#x27;s depiction.

====Animation====
* In the episode &quot;Legends of the Dark Knight&quot; of &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;, a scene is directly based on both of Batman&#x27;s fights with the Mutant leader, who was voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. Michael Ironside voiced &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; version of Batman.
* The first episode of &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, &quot;Rebirth&quot;, depicts a similarly aged Bruce Wayne repeat the book&#x27;s line &quot;never again&quot; upon deciding to give up the Batman mantle.
* Two members of the Mutant gang are shown throwing snowballs at an older Beast Boy in a cage in the episode &quot;How Long Is Forever?&quot; of &quot;Teen Titans&quot;.
* &quot;The Batman&quot; episode &quot;Artifacts&quot;, set in a future Gotham, mostly references Miller&#x27;s work, with the future Batman depicted as similarly tall and muscular and Mr. Freeze going so far as speaking the sentence &quot;The Dark Knight returns&quot; upon meeting his nemesis.
* There are some references in &quot;&quot;. In the season 1 episode &quot;Legends of the Dark Mite!&quot;, Bat-Mite transforms Batman into alternate versions of himself, one of which has his look from &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. In the season 2 episode &quot;The Knights of Tomorrow!&quot;, the Mutant gang is seen robbing a bank in a future where Bruce Wayne&#x27;s son, Damian, is the new Batman. The battle between Batman and Superman is featured in the season 3 episode &quot;Battle of the Super-Heroes!&quot;, where Batman wears a similar armored suit as well as some moments of the fight taken straight out of the comic.
* In the episode &quot;Play Date&quot;, from &quot;Justice League Action&quot;, Batman&#x27;s entrance uses the iconic cover pose.

===Film===
====Live action====
* Along with &quot;&quot;, Tim Burton has mentioned that &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; influenced his film adaptation of &quot;Batman&quot;.
* In the 1995 film &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, director Joel Schumacher uses some elements of the comic: when Bruce remembers falling into the cave as a child, and in a deleted scene when GNN News gives Batman a bad reputation after his fight with Two-Face in the Gotham Subway and when he follows Two-Face in a helicopter.
*According to Schumacher, he proposed a film adaptation of &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; when Warner Bros. commissioned him and writer Akiva Goldsman to create a sequel to &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, but the idea was shelved in favor of &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;. After the cancellation of &quot;Batman Unchained&quot;, Schumacher proposed an adaptation of &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, which Warner considered during their attempts to revamp the character. Michael Keaton (who portrayed Batman in &quot;Batman&quot; and in &quot;Batman Returns&quot;) and Clint Eastwood were considered to play Batman while singer David Bowie was considered again to play the Joker. However, the project was finally canceled in favor of the also shelved &quot;Batman: DarKnight&quot;.
* The Tumbler in &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005) was inspired by the Batmobile in &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. Both Batmobiles are designed as large, military vehicles built for special purposes.
* In the 2012 film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, director Christopher Nolan used a number of stories including &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; as influence for the film. After the death of Rachel Dawes, Bruce Wayne retires from Batman and spends the next eight years in a depressed state caused by his experiences as a vigilante. Bruce decides to return as Batman when he realizes that The League of Shadows has returned to Gotham; Bruce uses a special brace for his leg to compensate for his frail physicality, similar to the comics, in which he uses a brace to support his damaged arm; During a police chase, two officers witness Batman&#x27;s unexpected return and the older officer comments to his younger partner, &quot;You&#x27;re in for a show, kid&quot;, a line from a similar scene in the comic. After Harvey Dent dies in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, Batman is falsely accused for his death and becomes a fugitive, as in the comic. In both works, Bruce fakes his death at the end; to fight crime secretly in the comic and to have a normal life with Selina Kyle in the film.
* Director Zack Snyder stated that although the 2016 film &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; features an original premise, the film does borrow some elements from &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. In both, Batman is older and hardened, in his mid-50s in the comic and in his 40s in the film. Similarly, Robin has died, although his identity is never stated in the film, with Snyder intending for him to be Dick Grayson and a behind-the-scenes video as well as the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood stating it was Jason Todd. Batman is also less averse to using lethal force to the point of using guns to dispatch enemies. Further, Batman has a fateful confrontation with Superman, who is coerced to fight him, although by Lex Luthor instead of the U.S. government as in the comics. The Batsuit and the armored suit also both closely resemble the ones shown in the comic. There are also a few shots in the film directly taken from the pages of Miller&#x27;s work.
* The talk show host David Endochrine from &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; served as inspiration for the character Murray Franklin in the 2019 film &quot;Joker&quot;, played by Robert De Niro. Joker is interviewed on a talk show, similar to the comic. In both portrayals, the interview ends with the Joker committing murder on the set. The elderly sex therapist from the book, Dr. Ruth Weisenheimer, who Joker forcefully kisses during the interview also appears in the film, named Dr. Sally instead.
* The 2021 film &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot; featured a version of the Batmobile similar to the one from &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. In the film&#x27;s epilogue, Batman is seen standing on a Batmobile (as it is seen in Miller&#x27;s miniseries) after apprehending the Mutants.
* In an interview with the &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Zack Snyder expressed interest in returning to DC Films if he were to direct a live action adaptation of &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; as a &quot;true representation of the graphic novel&quot;&quot;.&quot;

====Animation====
* DC Entertainment produced , starring Peter Weller as the voice of Batman. Part 1 was released on DVD/Blu-ray on September 25, 2012, and Part 2 on January 29, 2013.
* The 2018 animated film &quot;Teen Titans Go! To the Movies&quot; had Robin dream up a sequence which seems to parody &quot;The Lion King&quot;, where he is lifted up by the Batman from &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; continuity. Later on, Robin appears in a musical sequence where he parodies the iconic &quot;Dark Knight Returns&quot; cover where Robin poses against a lightning effect with the title: &quot;Robin: The Dark Hero Returns&quot;

===Comic books===
* Carrie makes her first canonical appearance in the mainstream DC Universe in &quot;The New 52&quot;″s &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; (vol. 2) #19 (titled &quot;Batman and Red Robin&quot;). She is a college student and the late Damian Wayne&#x27;s drama instructor. As a homage to &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, she wears an imitation Robin costume as a Halloween costume in her first appearance.
*Batman/Bruce Wayne and Carrie Kelley/Robin appear in a one-page article in &quot;Comics Collector&quot; #8 (Krause Publications, summer 1985), predating their first comic book appearance.

===Merchandise===
In 1996, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the graphic novel, DC released a new hardcover and a later softcover release. These included original rough script text for issue #4 with some sketches by Miller. There was also a limited edition slipcased hardcover that included mini poster prints, collected media reviews, and a sketchbook by Miller. DC Direct released a limited edition statue of Batman and Robin designed by Miller. It was released in full size and then later as a mini-sized statue. DC Direct released a series of Batman action figures based on &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; in 2004. It included figures of Batman, Robin, Superman, and The Joker. Later, a Batman and Joker Gift Set was released, including both characters with new color schemes to reflect earlier points in the story, and a 48-page prestige format reprint of &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; #1 was also released. An action figure of Batman as he appears in &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; was released by Mattel in 2013, as part of their &quot;Batman Unlimited&quot; line of action figures.

In 2022, Cryptozoic Entertainment released a &quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns&quot; board game designed specifically for solitaire play. The game uses extensive amounts of art from the graphic novel and follows the story of The Dark Knight Returns, including 4 games mirroring the books as a campaign.

===Miscellaneous===
* In the episode &quot;Girl Meets the New Teacher&quot; of &quot;Girl Meets World&quot;, the new English teacher Harper Burgess gives out copies for her class to study, which creates controversy with the principal who disapproves of the comic.
* In the &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; season 6 episode &quot;Solaricks&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; is mentioned by the original version of Jerry Smith as one of the books he read at a Barnes &amp; Noble to overcome the grief of losing his family.

<text>The Battle of Dunkirk () was fought around the French port of Dunkirk (Dunkerque) during the Second World War, between the Allies and Nazi Germany. As the Allies were losing the Battle of France on the Western Front, the Battle of Dunkirk was the defence and evacuation of British and other Allied forces to Britain from 26 May to 4 June 1940.

After the Phoney War, the Battle of France began in earnest on 10 May 1940. To the east, the German Army Group B invaded the Netherlands and advanced westward. In response, the Supreme Allied Commander, French General Maurice Gamelin, initiated &quot;Plan D&quot; and British and French troops entered Belgium to engage the Germans in the Netherlands. French planning for war relied on the Maginot Line fortifications along the German–French border protecting the region of Lorraine but the line did not cover the Belgian border. German forces had already crossed most of the Netherlands before the French forces had arrived. Gamelin instead committed the forces under his command – three mechanised forces, the French First and Seventh Armies and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) – to the River Dyle. On 14 May, German Army Group A burst through the Ardennes and advanced rapidly westward toward Sedan, turning northward to the English Channel, using Erich von Manstein&#x27;s plan (under the German strategy ), effectively flanking the Allied forces.

A series of Allied counter-attacks, including the Battle of Arras, failed to sever the German spearhead, which reached the coast on 20 May, separating the BEF near Armentières, the French First Army, and the Belgian Army further to the north from the majority of French troops south of the German penetration. After reaching the Channel, the German forces swung north along the coast, threatening to capture the ports and trap the British and French forces.

In one of the most debated decisions of the war, the Germans halted their advance on Dunkirk. What became known as the &quot;Halt Order&quot; did not originate with Adolf Hitler. (Colonel-General) Gerd von Rundstedt and Generaloberst Günther von Kluge suggested that the German forces around the Dunkirk pocket should cease their advance on the port and consolidate to avoid an Allied breakout. Hitler sanctioned the order on 24 May with the support of the (German high command). The army was to halt for three days, which gave the Allies sufficient time to organise the Dunkirk evacuation and build a defensive line. While more than 330,000 Allied troops were rescued, the British and French sustained heavy casualties and were forced to abandon nearly all their equipment; around 16,000 French and 1,000 British soldiers died during the evacuation. The British Expeditionary Force alone lost some 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign.

==Prelude==

On 10 May 1940, Winston Churchill became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. By 26 May, the BEF and the French 1st Army were bottled up in a corridor to the sea, about deep and wide. Most of the British forces were still around Lille, over from Dunkirk, with the French farther south. Two massive German armies flanked them. General Fedor von Bock&#x27;s Army Group B was to the east, and General Gerd von Rundstedt&#x27;s Army Group A to the west. Both officers were later promoted to field marshal.

==Halt order==


On 24 May, Hitler visited General von Rundstedt&#x27;s headquarters at Charleville. The terrain around Dunkirk was thought unsuitable for armour. Von Rundstedt advised him the infantry should attack the British forces at Arras, where the British had proved capable of significant action, while Kleist&#x27;s armour held the line west and south of Dunkirk to pounce on the Allied forces retreating before Army Group B. Hitler, who was familiar with Flanders&#x27; marshes from the First World War, agreed. This order allowed the Germans to consolidate their gains and prepare for a southward advance against the remaining French forces.

 commander Hermann Göring asked for the chance to destroy the forces in Dunkirk. The Allied forces&#x27; destruction was thus initially assigned to the air force while the German infantry organised in Army Group B. Von Rundstedt later called this &quot;one of the great turning points of the war&quot;.

The true reason for the decision to halt the German armour on 24 May is still debated. One theory is that Von Rundstedt and Hitler agreed to conserve the armour for (&quot;Case Red&quot;), an operation to the south. It is possible that the &#x27;s closer ties than the army&#x27;s to the Nazi Party contributed to Hitler&#x27;s approval of Göring&#x27;s request. Another theory—which few historians have given credence—is that Hitler was still trying to establish diplomatic peace with Britain before Operation Barbarossa (the invasion of the Soviet Union). Although von Rundstedt after the war stated his suspicions that Hitler wanted &quot;to help the British&quot;, based on alleged praise of the British Empire during a visit to his headquarters, little evidence that Hitler wanted to let the Allies escape exists apart from a self-exculpatory statement by Hitler himself in 1945. The historian Brian Bond wrote:

Whatever the reasons for Hitler&#x27;s decision, the Germans confidently believed the Allied troops were doomed. American journalist William Shirer reported on 25 May, &quot;German military circles here tonight put it flatly. They said the fate of the great Allied army bottled up in Flanders is sealed.&quot; BEF commander General Lord Gort , commander-in-chief (C-in-C) of the BEF, agreed, writing to Anthony Eden, &quot;I must not conceal from you that a great part of the BEF and its equipment will inevitably be lost in the best of circumstances&quot;.

Hitler did not rescind the Halt Order until the evening of 26 May. The three days thus gained gave a vital breathing space to the Royal Navy to arrange the evacuation of the British and Allied troops. About 338,000 men were rescued in about 11 days. Of these some 215,000 were British and 123,000 were French, of whom 102,250 escaped in British ships.

==Battle==

===&quot;Fight back to the west&quot;===

On 26 May, Anthony Eden told Gort that he might need to &quot;fight back to the west&quot;, and ordered him to prepare plans for the evacuation, but without telling the French or the Belgians. Gort had foreseen the order and preliminary plans were already in hand. The first such plan, for a defence along the Lys Canal, could not be carried out because of German advances on 26 May, with the 2nd and 50th Divisions pinned down, and the 1st, 5th and 48th Divisions under heavy attack. The 2nd Division took heavy casualties trying to keep a corridor open, being reduced to brigade strength, but they succeeded; the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 42nd Divisions escaped along the corridor that day, as did about one-third of the French First Army. As the Allies fell back, they disabled their artillery and vehicles and destroyed their stores.

On 27 May, the British fought back to the Dunkirk perimeter line. The Le Paradis massacre took place that day, when the 3rd SS Division &quot;Totenkopf&quot; machine-gunned 97 British and French prisoners near the La Bassée Canal. The British prisoners were from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment, part of the 4th Brigade of the 2nd Division. The SS men lined them up against the wall of a barn and shot them all; only two survived. Meanwhile, the Luftwaffe dropped bombs and leaflets on the Allied armies. The leaflets showed a map of the situation. They read, in English and French: &quot;British soldiers! Look at the map: it gives your true situation! Your troops are entirely surrounded—stop fighting! Put down your arms!&quot; To the land- and air-minded Germans, the sea seemed an impassable barrier, so they believed the Allies were surrounded; but the British saw the sea as a route to safety.

Besides the Luftwaffe″s bombs, German heavy artillery (which had just come within range) also fired high-explosive shells into Dunkirk. By this time, over 1,000 civilians in the town had been killed. This bombardment continued until the evacuation was over.

===Battle of Wytschaete===

Gort had sent Lieutenant General Ronald Adam, commanding III Corps, ahead to build the defensive perimeter around Dunkirk; his corps command passed to Lieutenant General Sydney Rigby Wason from the GHQ staff. Lieutenant General Alan Brooke, commanding II Corps, was to conduct a holding action with the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 50th Divisions along the Ypres-Comines canal as far as Yser, while the rest of the BEF fell back. The battle of Wytschaete, over the border in Belgium, was the toughest action Brooke faced in this role.

On 26 May, the Germans made a reconnaissance in force against the British position. At mid-day on 27 May, they launched a full-scale attack with three divisions south of Ypres. A confused battle followed, where visibility was low because of forested or urban terrain and communications were poor because the British at that time used no radios below battalion level and the telephone wires had been cut. The Germans used infiltration tactics to get among the British, who were beaten back.

The heaviest fighting was in the 5th Division&#x27;s sector. Still on 27 May, Brooke ordered the 3rd Division commander, Major-General Bernard Montgomery, to extend his division&#x27;s line to the left, thereby freeing the 10th and 11th Brigades, both of the 4th Division, to join the 5th Division at Messines Ridge. The 10th Brigade arrived first, to find the enemy had advanced so far they were closing on the British field artillery. Between them, the 10th and 11th Brigades cleared the ridge of Germans, and by 28 May they were securely dug in east of Wytschaete.

That day, Brooke ordered a counterattack. This was to be spearheaded by two battalions, the 3rd Grenadier Guards and 2nd North Staffordshire Regiment, both of Major-General Harold Alexander&#x27;s 1st Division. The North Staffords advanced as far as the Kortekeer River, while the Grenadiers reached the canal itself, but could not hold it. The counterattack disrupted the Germans, holding them back a little longer while the BEF retreated.

===Action at Poperinge===
The route back from Brooke&#x27;s position to Dunkirk passed through the town of Poperinge (known to most British sources as &quot;Poperinghe&quot;), where there was a bottleneck at a bridge over the Yser canal. Most of the main roads in the area converged on that bridge. On 27 May, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombed the resulting traffic jam thoroughly for two hours, destroying or immobilising about 80 percent of the vehicles. Another &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; raid, on the night of 28–29 May, was illuminated by flares as well as the light from burning vehicles. The British 44th Division in particular had to abandon many guns and lorries, losing almost all of them between Poperinge and the Mont.

The German 6th Panzer Division could probably have destroyed the 44th Division at Poperinge on 29 May, thereby cutting off the 3rd and 50th Divisions as well. The historian and author Julian Thompson calls it &quot;astonishing&quot; that they did not, but they were distracted, investing the nearby town of Cassel.

===Belgian surrender===
Gort had ordered Lieutenant General Adam, commanding III Corps, and French General Fagalde to prepare a perimeter defence of Dunkirk. The perimeter was semicircular, with French troops manning the western sector and British troops the eastern. It ran along the Belgian coastline from Nieuwpoort in the east via Veurne, Bulskamp and Bergues to Gravelines in the west. The line was made as strong as possible under the circumstances. On 28 May the Belgian army fighting on the Lys river under the command of King Leopold III surrendered. This left a gap in Gort&#x27;s eastern flank between the British and the sea. The British were surprised by the Belgian capitulation, despite King Leopold warning them in advance. As a constitutional monarch, Leopold&#x27;s decision to surrender without consulting the Belgian government led to his condemnation by the Belgian and French Prime Ministers, Hubert Pierlot and Paul Reynaud. Gort sent the battle-worn 3rd, 4th and 50th Divisions into the line to fill the space the Belgians had held.

===Defence of the perimeter===

While they were still moving into position, they ran headlong into the German 256th Division, who were trying to outflank Gort. Armoured cars of the 12th Royal Lancers stopped the Germans at Nieuwpoort itself. A confused battle raged all along the perimeter throughout 28 May. Command and control on the British side disintegrated, and the perimeter was driven slowly inwards toward Dunkirk.

Meanwhile, Erwin Rommel had surrounded five divisions of the French First Army near Lille. Although completely cut off and heavily outnumbered, the French fought on for four days under General Molinié in the Siege of Lille, thereby keeping seven German divisions from the assault on Dunkirk and saving an estimated 100,000 Allied troops. In recognition of the garrison&#x27;s stubborn defence, German general Kurt Waeger granted them the honours of war, saluting the French troops as they marched past in parade formation with rifles shouldered.

The defence of the Dunkirk perimeter held throughout 29–30 May, with the Allies falling back by degrees. On 31 May, the Germans nearly broke through at Nieuwpoort. The situation grew so desperate that two British battalion commanders manned a Bren gun, with one colonel firing and the other loading. A few hours later, the 2nd Battalion, Coldstream Guards of the 3rd Division, rushed to reinforce the line near Furnes, where the British troops had been routed. The Guards restored order by shooting some of the fleeing troops and turning others around at bayonet point. The British troops returned to the line and the German assault was beaten back.

In the afternoon, the Germans breached the perimeter near the canal at Bulskamp, but the boggy ground on the far side of the canal and sporadic fire from the Durham Light Infantry halted them. As night fell, the Germans massed for another attack at Nieuwpoort. Eighteen RAF bombers found the Germans while they were still assembling and scattered them with an accurate bombing run.

===Retreat to Dunkirk===

Also on 31 May, General von Küchler assumed command of all the German forces at Dunkirk. His plan was simple: launch an all-out attack across the whole front at 11:00 on 1 June. Strangely, von Küchler ignored a radio intercept telling him the British were abandoning the eastern end of the line to fall back to Dunkirk itself. During the night of 31 May to 1 June, Marcus Ervine-Andrews won the Victoria Cross in the battle when he defended of territory.

The morning of 1 June was clear—good flying weather, in contrast to the bad weather that had hindered air operations on 30 and 31 May (there were only two-and-a-half good flying days in the whole operation) Although Churchill had promised the French that the British would cover their escape, on the ground it was the British and mostly the French who held the line whilst the last remaining British and then French soldiers were evacuated. Enduring concentrated German artillery fire and strafing and bombs, the outnumbered French and British stood their ground. On 2 June (the day the last of the British units embarked onto the ships), the French began to fall back slowly, and by 3 June the Germans were about from Dunkirk. The night of 3 June was the last night of evacuations. At 10:20 on 4 June, the Germans hoisted the swastika over the docks from which so many British and French troops had escaped.

The resistance of Allied forces, especially the French forces, including the French 12th Motorised Infantry Division from the Fort des Dunes, had bought time for the evacuation of the bulk of the troops. The Wehrmacht captured some 35,000 soldiers, almost all of them French. These men had protected the evacuation until the last moment and were unable to embark. The same fate was reserved for the survivors of the French 12th Motorised Infantry Division (composed in particular of the French 150th Infantry Regiment); they were taken prisoner on the morning of 4 June on the beach of Malo-les-Bains. The flag of this regiment was burnt so as not to fall into enemy hands.

==Evacuation==
The War Office made the decision to evacuate British forces on 25 May. In the nine days from 27 May to 4 June 338,226 men escaped, including 139,997 French, Polish, and Belgian troops, together with a small number of Dutch soldiers, aboard 861 vessels (of which 243 were sunk during the operation). B. H. Liddell Hart wrote that Fighter Command lost 106 aircraft over Dunkirk and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; lost about 135, some of which were shot down by the French Navy and the Royal Navy. MacDonald wrote in 1986 that the British losses were 177 aircraft and German losses 240.

The docks at Dunkirk were too badly damaged to be used, but the east and west moles (sea walls protecting the harbour entrance) were intact. Captain William Tennant—in charge of the evacuation—decided to use the beaches and the east mole to land the ships. This highly successful idea hugely increased the number of troops that could be embarked each day, and on 31 May, over 68,000 men were embarked.

The last of the British Army left on 3 June, and at 10:50, Tennant signalled Ramsay to say &quot;Operation completed. Returning to Dover&quot;. Churchill insisted on going back for the French, and the Royal Navy returned on 4 June to rescue as many as possible of the French rearguard. Over 26,000 French soldiers were evacuated on that last day, but between 30,000 and 40,000 more were left behind and captured by the Germans. Around 16,000 French soldiers and 1,000 British soldiers died during the evacuation. 90% of Dunkirk was destroyed during the battle.

==Aftermath==
Following the events at Dunkirk, the German forces regrouped before commencing operation &quot;Fall Rot&quot;, a renewed assault southward, starting on 5 June. Although the French soldiers who had been evacuated at Dunkirk returned to France a few hours later to stop the German advance and two fresh British divisions had begun moving to France in an attempt to form a Second BEF, the decision was taken on 14 June to withdraw all the remaining British troops, an evacuation called Operation Aerial. By 25 June, almost 192,000 Allied personnel, 144,000 of them British, had been evacuated through various French ports. Although the French Army fought on, German troops entered Paris on 14 June. The French government was forced to negotiate an armistice at Compiègne on 22 June.

The loss of materiel on the beaches was enormous. The British Army left enough equipment behind to fit out about eight to ten divisions. Discarded in France were, among other things, huge supplies of ammunition, 880 field guns, 310 guns of large calibre, some 500 anti-aircraft guns, about 850 anti-tank guns, 11,000 machine guns, nearly 700 tanks, 20,000 motorcycles and 45,000 motor cars and lorries. Army equipment available at home was only just sufficient to equip two divisions. The British Army needed months to re-supply properly, and some planned introductions of new equipment were halted while industrial resources concentrated on making good the losses. Officers told troops falling back from Dunkirk to burn or otherwise disable their trucks (so as not to let them benefit the advancing German forces). The shortage of army vehicles after Dunkirk was so severe that the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) was reduced to retrieving and refurbishing obsolete buses and coaches from British scrapyards to press them into use as troop transports. Some of these antique workhorses were still in use as late as the North African campaign of 1942.

On 2 June, the Dean of St Paul&#x27;s, Walter Matthews, was the first to call the evacuation the &quot;Miracle of Dunkirk&quot;.

A marble memorial to the battle stands at Dunkirk. The French inscription is translated as: &quot;To the glorious memory of the pilots, mariners, and soldiers of the French and Allied armies who sacrificed themselves in the Battle of Dunkirk, May–June 1940.&quot; The missing dead of the BEF are commemorated on the Dunkirk Memorial.

A considerable number of British troops remained in France after Dunkirk to the south of the River Somme. These numbered some 140,000 men, mostly logistic support and lines-of-communications troops, but also including the 51st (Highland) Division and the remnants of the 1st Armoured Division. On 2 June, Lieutenant General Brooke was ordered back to France to form a Second BEF together with two further infantry divisions to follow, a project which Brooke believed was doomed to failure. After learning that most of the 51st Division had surrendered, having been cut off at St Valery-en-Caux on the Channel coast, Brooke spoke to Churchill by telephone on 14 June and persuaded him to allow the evacuation of all the remaining British forces in France. In Operation Aerial, 144,171 British, 18,246 French, 24,352 Polish and 1,939 Czech troops were embarked in ships at several major ports along the west coast of France and returned to England, along with much of their equipment. The only major mishap was the sinking of the with the loss of perhaps 6,000 men. The last British troops left France on 25 June, the day the French Armistice came into force.

== &quot;Dunkirk Spirit&quot;==

British press later exploited the successful evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, and particularly the role of the &quot;Dunkirk little ships&quot;, very effectively. Many of them were private vessels such as fishing boats and pleasure cruisers, but commercial vessels such as ferries also contributed to the force, including a number from as far away as the Isle of Man and Glasgow. These smaller vessels—guided by naval craft across the Channel from the Thames Estuary and from Dover—assisted in the official evacuation. Being able to move closer into the beachfront shallows than larger craft, the &quot;little ships&quot; acted as shuttles to and from the larger ships, lifting troops who were queuing in the water, many waiting shoulder-deep in water for hours. The term &quot;Dunkirk Spirit&quot; refers to the solidarity of the British people in times of adversity.

==Dunkirk Medal==

A commemorative medal was established in 1960 by the French National Association of Veterans of the Fortified Sector of Flanders and Dunkirk on behalf of the town of Dunkirk. The medal was initially awarded only to the French defenders of Dunkirk, but in 1970 the qualification was expanded to include British forces who served in the Dunkirk sector and their rescue forces, including the civilians who volunteered to man the &quot;little ships&quot;.

The design of the bronze medal included the arms of the town of Dunkirk on one side, and &quot;Dunkerque 1940&quot; on the reverse side.

<text>Cuba is an island nation in the Caribbean Sea. It comprises an archipelago of islands centred upon the geographic coordinates 21°3N, 80°00W. Cuba is the principal island, surrounded by four main archipelagos: the Colorados, the Sabana-Camagüey, the Jardines de la Reina and the Canarreos. Cuba&#x27;s area is including coastal and territorial waters with a land area of , which makes it the eighth-largest island country in the world. The main island (Cuba) has of coastline and of land borders—all figures including the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. Its official area is .

Cuba lies west of the North Atlantic Ocean, east of the Gulf of Mexico, south of the Straits of Florida, northwest of the Windward Passage, and northeast of the Yucatán Channel. The main island (Cuba), at , makes up most of the land area and is the 17th-largest island in the world by land area.

The island is long and across its widest points and across its narrowest points. The largest island outside the main island is the Isla de la Juventud is (Isle of Youth) in the southwest, with an area of .

The main island consists mostly of flat to rolling plains. At the southeastern end is the Sierra Maestra, a range of steep mountains whose highest point is the Pico Turquino at .

Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Better-known smaller towns include Baracoa, which was the first Spanish settlement on Cuba, Trinidad, a UNESCO world heritage site, and Bayamo.

==Physical geography==

Cuba is located west of Haiti across the Windward Passage, south of The Bahamas (Cay Lobos), south of the United States (Key West, Florida), east of Mexico, and north of Jamaica. It was made in three stages.

Cuba is the largest country by land area in the Caribbean. Its main island is the 17th-largest island in the world by land area. The island rises between the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean. It is bordered on the north by the Straits of Florida, on the northeast by Nicholas Channel and the Old Bahama Channel. The southern part is bounded by the Windward Passage and the Cayman Trench, while the southwest lies in the Caribbean Sea. To the west, it reaches to the Yucatán Channel, and the northwest is open to the Gulf of Mexico.

About 4,195 islands, islets and cays make up the country. The southern coast includes such archipelagos as Jardines de la Reina and the Canarreos. The northeastern shore is lined by the Sabana-Camagüey Archipelago, which includes Jardines del Rey and is composed of approximately 2,517 cays and islands. The Colorados Archipelago is developed on the northwestern coast.
===Terrain===
Cuba&#x27;s terrain is mostly flat or rolling plains, with rugged hills and mountains in the southeast. The lowest point is the Caribbean Sea at 0 m (sea level) and the highest point is Pico Turquino at , part of the Sierra Maestra mountain range, located in the southeast of the island.

Other mountain ranges are Sierra Cristal in the southeast, Escambray Mountains in the center of the island, and Sierra del Rosario in the northwest. White sand beaches (most notably in Varadero), as well as mangroves and marshes can be found in the coastal area. The largest is the Zapata Swamp, with over . A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 675 km2 of tidal flats in Cuba, making it the 38th-ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.

Cuba has negligible inland water area. The largest natural water mirror is Laguna de Leche at , while the man-made Zaza Reservoir, at , is the largest inland water surface by area in the country.

=== Geology ===
===Climate===

Most of Cuba has a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot; according to the Köppen climate classification), although areas on the windward slopes of the Sierra Maestra and Sierra del Rosario have either a tropical monsoon climate or a trade-wind tropical rainforest climate, whilst a hot semi-arid climate occurs in the Guantánamo Bay area because of a rain shadow from the Sierra Maestra. In most areas, the dry season lasts from November to April and the rainy season from May to October.

The climate is tropical, though moderated by trade winds. In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October. The average temperature is in January and in July.

Cuba lies in the path of hurricanes, and these destructive storms are most common in September and October. Tornadoes are somewhat rare in Cuba; however, on the evening of 27 January 2019, a very rare strong F4 tornado struck the eastern side of Havana, Cuba&#x27;s capital city. The tornado caused extensive damage, destroying at least 90 homes, killing four people and injuring 195. By 4 February, the death toll had increased to six, with 11 people still in critical condition.



=== Maritime claims ===
Cuba makes maritime claims that include a territorial sea of and an exclusive economic zone of with .

===Extreme points===

Extreme points in Cuba are:

==Natural resources==

Natural resources include cobalt, nickel, iron ore, copper, salt, timber, silica, oil and petroleum. At one time the whole island was covered with forests, and there are still many cedar (&quot;Cedrela odorata&quot;), chechem (&quot;Metopium brownei&quot;), mahogany (&quot;Swietenia mahagoni&quot;), and other valuable trees. Large areas were cleared to grow more sugarcane, and so few trees remained that timber had to be imported.

The most important Cuban mineral economic resource is nickel. Cuba has the second-largest nickel reserves in the world after Russia. Sherritt International, a Canadian energy company, operates a large nickel mining facility in Moa, Cuba. Another leading mineral resource is cobalt, a byproduct of nickel mining operations. Cuba ranks as the fifth-largest producer of refined cobalt in the world.

Cuba has historically been dependent on oil imports. As of 2011, Cuba had proven reserves of a mere of crude oil and 2.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and mostly used oil for power generation. In 2010, Cuba produced 51,000 barrels of crude oil a day (Kb/d) in 2010 in onshore or shallow near-shore development, &quot;mostly heavy, sour (sulfur-rich) crude that requires advanced refining capacity to process.&quot; Offshore exploration in the North Cuba Basin had revealed the possibility of an additional of technically recoverable crude oil, 0.9 billion barrels of natural gas liquids, and 9.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. As of 2011, Cuba had six offshore petroleum development projects with foreign oil companies Petrovietnam (Vietnam), Petronas (Malaysia), PDVSA (Venezuela), Sonangol (Angola), ONGC (India), Repsol (Spain), and Statoil (Norway).

Sugarcane was historically the most important part of the Cuban economy, and large areas are still dedicated to its cultivation; in 2018, Cuba produced an estimated 1.1–1.3 million tonnes of raw sugar. The importance of the sugar harvest has declined, with tourism, tobacco, nickel, and pharmaceuticals surpassing sugar in economic importance.

Extensive irrigation systems are developed in the south of Sancti Spíritus Province. Tobacco, used for some of the world&#x27;s cigars, is grown especially in the Pinar del Río Province.

==Administrative subdivisions==
Cuba is divided into 15 provinces and one special municipality. Provinces are further subdivided into 168 municipalities.

<doc id="73248" wikidata="Q2477946" url="?curid=73248" title="Demographics of Cuba">
<text>The demographic characteristics of Cuba are known through census which have been conducted and analyzed by different bureaus since 1774. The National Office of Statistics of and Information of Cuba (ONEI) is doing it since 1953. The most recent census was conducted in September 2012. The population of Cuba at the 2012 census was nearly 11.2 million. 

Nevertheless, in July 2024, Juan Carlos Alfonso Fraga, deputy head of the ONEI, presented data on Cuba&#x27;s effective population to the deputies. According to ONEI data, as of December 31, 2023, the effective Cuban population was 10,055,968 people.

According to the 2012 census, the population density at that time was 101 inhabitants per square kilometer, and the overall life expectancy in Cuba was 78.0 years. The population has always increased from one census to the next in the 20th century, with the exception of the 2012 census, when the count decreased by 10,000. The 2024 data by ONEI seems to corroborate that trend.

Since 1740, Cuba&#x27;s birth rate has surpassed its death rate; the natural growth rate of the country is positive. Cuba is in the fourth stage of demographic transition. In terms of age structure, the population is dominated (71.1%) by the 15- to 64-year-old segment. The median age of the population is 39.5, making it the oldest in the Americas, and the gender ratio of the total population is 0.99 males per female.

==Population size and structure==
According to the 2002 census, Cuba&#x27;s population was 11,177,743, whereas the 2012 census numbered the population at 11,167,325. There was a drop between the 2002 and 2012 censuses which was the first drop in Cuba&#x27;s population since Cuba&#x27;s war of independence. This drop was due to low fertility and emigration, as during this time (fiscal years 2003 to 2012), 42,028 Cubans received legal permanent residence in the United States. Consequently, Cuba is also the oldest country in the Americas in terms of median age, due to a high amount of emigration by younger Cubans to the U.S. In the last few years before the end of the wet feet, dry feet policy on January 12, 2017, the number of Cubans moving to the United States significantly outnumbered the natural increase during those years.

==Racial groups==



===Ancestral origins===
According to the previous censuses, the Chinese were counted as white.
The ancestry of Cubans comes from many sources:

* Spanish

During the 18th, 19th and early part of the 20th century, large waves of Spanish immigrants from Canary Islands, Catalonia, Andalusia, Galicia, and Asturias emigrated to Cuba. Between 1820 and 1898, a total of 508,455 people left Spain, and more than 750,000 Spanish immigrants left for Cuba between 1899 and 1930, with many returning to Spain. There are 139,851 Spanish citizens living in Cuba as of 1 January 2018.

* Canary Islanders
* Catalans
* Andalusians
* Galicians
* Asturians

The Slave trade brought Africans to Cuba during its early history:
Between 1842 and 1873, 221,000 African slaves entered Cuba.

* Africans

People of the Americas:
* Haitians
* Jamaicans

Other European people that have contributed include:

* Germans
* French
* Portuguese
* Italians
* Russians

People from Asia:
* Chinese
* Koreans
* Filipino
* Lebanese, Syrian, Egyptian, Palestinian (Arab Cubans)
Between 1842 and 1873, 124,800 Chinese arrived.

===Genetics===

An autosomal study from 2014 has found out the genetic average ancestry in Cuba to be 72% European, 20% African and 8% Native American with different proportions depending on the self-reported ancestry (White, Mulatto or Mestizo, and Black):

A 1995 study done on the population of Pinar del Rio, found that 50% of the Mt-DNA lineages (female lineages) could be traced back to Europeans, 46% to Africans and 4% to Native Americans. This figure is consistent with both the historical background of the region, and the current demographics of it.

According to another study in 2008, the Native American contribution to present-day Cubans accounted for 33% of the maternal lineages, whereas Africa and Eurasia contributed 45% and 22% of the lineages, respectively. Haplogroup A2 is the main Native American haplogroup in Cuba (21.9% of the total sample), accounting for 67% of the Native American mtDNA gene pool. Regarding Y-chromosome haplogroups (male lineages), 78.8% of the sequences found in Cubans are of West Eurasian origin, 19.7% of African origin and 1.5% of East Asian origin. Among the West Eurasian fraction, the vast majority of individuals belong to West European haplogroup R1b. The African lineages found in Cubans have a Western (haplogroups E1, E2, E1b1a) and Northern (E1b1b-M81) African origin. The &quot;Berber&quot; haplogroup E1b1b1b (E-M81), is found at a frequency of 6.1%.

According to Fregel et al. (2009), the fact that autochthonous male North African E-M81 and female U6 lineages from the Canaries have been detected in Cuba and Iberoamerica, demonstrates that Canary Islanders with indigenous ancestors actively participated in the American colonization.

== Language ==

Spanish is the official language of Cuba. Of all the regional variations of Spanish, Cuban Spanish is most similar to, and originates largely from, the dialect spoken in the Canary Islands. This is a consequence of Canarian migration, which in the 19th and early 20th century was heavy and continuous. There were also migrations of Galicians and Asturians as well, but they did not impact Cuban Spanish to the same degree.

Much of the typical Cuban replacements for standard Spanish vocabulary stems from Canarian lexicon. For example, &#x27; (bus) differs from standard Spanish &#x27; the former originated in the Canaries and is an onomatopoeia stemming from the sound of a Klaxon horn (wah-wah!). An example of Canarian usage for a Spanish word is the verb (&quot;to fight&quot;). In standard Spanish the verb would be &quot;&quot;, while &quot;fajar&quot; exists as a non-reflexive verb related to the hemming of a skirt.

The second most spoken language of Cuba is Haitian Creole, used mainly by Haitian immigrants and its descendants going back since the late 18th century, of whom fled the Haitian Revolution.

Other languages of Cuba are Cuban Sign Language, and English is commonly studied as a foreign language.

There are also reports of Lucumi, &quot;Lengua Conga&quot; (Kongo-based liturgical language of the Palo religion) and Bozal Spanish (an &quot;African&quot; socio-dialect of Spanish; now used only in folk religion). Historically, the Ciboney and Classic dialects of Taino and the unattested Guanahatabey were spoken.

==Religion==

Cuba has a multitude of faiths reflecting the island&#x27;s diverse cultural elements. Catholicism, which was brought to the island by Spanish colonialists at the beginning of the 16th century, is the most prevalent professed faith. After the revolution, Cuba became an officially atheistic state and restricted religious practice. Since the Fourth Cuban Communist Party Congress in 1991, restrictions have been eased and, according to the National Catholic Observer, direct challenges by state institutions to the right to religion have all but disappeared, though the Church still faces restrictions of written and electronic communication, and can only accept donations from state-approved funding sources. The Roman Catholic Church is made up of the Cuban Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference (COCC), led by Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino, Cardinal Archbishop of Havana. It has eleven dioceses, 56 orders of nuns and 24 orders of priests. In January 1998, Pope John Paul II paid a historic visit to the island, invited by the Cuban government and Catholic Church.

Afro-Cuban religions, a blend of native African religions and Roman Catholicism, are widely practiced in Cuba. This diversity derives from West and Central Africans who were transported to Cuba, and in effect reinvented their African religions. They did so by combining them with elements of the Catholic belief system, with a result very similar to Brazil. One of these Afro-Cuban religions is Santeria.

Protestantism, introduced from the United States in the 18th century, has seen a steady increase in popularity. 300,000 Cubans belong to the island&#x27;s 54 Protestant denominations. Pentecostalism has grown rapidly in recent years, and the Assemblies of God alone claims a membership of over 167 000 people. The Episcopal Church of Cuba claims 10,000 adherents. Cuba has small communities of Jews, Muslims, Buddhists and members of the Baháʼí Faith.

<text>Cuba has had a socialist political system since 1961 based on the &quot;one state – one party&quot; principle. Cuba is constitutionally defined as a single party Marxist–Leninist socialist republic with semi-presidential powers. The present Constitution of Cuba, which was passed in a 2019 referendum, also describes the role of the Communist Party of Cuba to be the &quot;leading force of society and of the state&quot; and as having the capability of setting national policy, and the First Secretary of the Communist Party is the most powerful position in Cuba. The 2019 Constitution of Cuba identifies the ideals represented by Cuban independence hero José Martí and revolutionary leader Fidel Castro as the primary foundation of Cuba&#x27;s political system, while also stressing the importance of the influence of the ideas of Marx, Engels, and Lenin.

The president of Cuba is Miguel Díaz-Canel, who succeeded Raúl Castro as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in 2021. Díaz-Canel is the first president of Communist Cuba to not hail from the family of Fidel or Raúl Castro. Executive power is exercised by the government, which is represented by the Council of Ministers, headed by the prime minister of Cuba. Legislative power is exercised through the unicameral National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power, which is constituted as the maximum authority of the state. With effect from 10 October 2019, Miguel Díaz-Canel is the president and Manuel Marrero is the prime minister of Cuba. The previous president of the State Council was Raúl Castro, brother of former leader Fidel Castro; Raúl Castro remained First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, and commander-in-chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces until 19 April 2021. Fidel Castro ruled from 1959 to 2006, before illness forced him to hand power to his brother. Esteban Lazo Hernández is the president of the National Assembly.

Political scientists characterize the political system of Cuba as a single-party authoritarian regime where political opposition is not permitted. There are elections in Cuba, but they are not considered democratic. According to the V-Dem Democracy Indices, Cuba is the second least democratic country in Latin America. Censorship of information (including limits to internet access) is extensive, and independent journalism is repressed in Cuba; Reporters Without Borders has characterized Cuba as one of the worst countries in the world for press freedom.

== Executive ==
Executive power in the Cuban government is exercised by the Council of Ministers. From February 1959 until February 2008, Cuba was led by revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, who was head of state, head of government, First Secretary of the Communist Party, and commander-in-chief of the Cuban armed forces. The Ministry of Interior is the principal organ of state security and control.

According to the Constitution of Cuba, Article 94, the First Vice President of the Council of State assumes presidential duties upon the illness or death of the President. On July 31, 2006, during the 2006 Cuban transfer of duties, Fidel Castro delegated his duties as president of the Council of state, first secretary of the Cuban Communist Party and the post of commander in chief of the armed forces to first Vice President Raúl Castro. Since 2019, the President of Cuba is also limited to two five year terms.

== Legislature ==
Cuba has an elected national legislature, the National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power (&quot;Asamblea Nacional del Poder Popular&quot;), which has 612 members, elected every 5 years and holds brief sessions to ratify decisions by the executive branch. The National Assembly convenes twice a year in ordinary periods of sessions. However, it has permanent commissions to look after issues of legislative interest. Among its permanent or temporary commissions are those in charge of issues concerning the economy, sugar industry, industries, transportation and communications, constructions, foreign affairs, public health, defense and interior order. The National Assembly also has permanent departments that oversee the work of the Commissions, Local Assemblies of the People&#x27;s Power, International Relations, Judicial Affairs and the Administration.

Article 88(h) of the Constitution of Cuba, adopted in 1976, provides for citizen proposals of law, prerequisite that the proposal be made by at least 10,000 citizens who are eligible to vote. In 2002 supporters of a movement known as the Varela Project submitted a citizen proposal of law with 11,000 signatures calling for a national referendum on political and economic reforms. The Government response was to collect 8.1 million signatures to request that Cuba&#x27;s National Assembly enact a constitutional amendment making socialism an unalterable feature of Cuban government.

== Committees for the Defense of the Revolution ==

The Committees for the Defense of the Revolution is a network of neighborhood organizations across Cuba of which most Cubans are members. The organizations are designed to put medical, educational or other campaigns into national effect, and to report &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; activity. It is the duty of the CDR officials to know the political activities of each person in their respective blocks.

== Political parties and elections ==
Suffrage is automatically afforded to Cuban citizens who have resided in Cuba for at least two years and are at least sixteen years old. Those legally declared &quot;mentally handicapped&quot; or who are serving time in prison cannot exercise this right. Cubans who live abroad for personal reasons for more than 24 consecutive months lose their right to vote. The national elections for the 470 members of the National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power are held according to this system and the precepts of the 1976 Constitution.

General elections consist of two phases: municipal elections and elections to ANPP (National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power, or Parliament). They are usually called in July and are held every five years. After elections are called, Council of State designates members of CEN (National Electoral Commission). The CEN oversees elections, but does not participate in them. It is responsible for surveying and inspecting the election procedure and ensure it conforms with the Constitution and electoral law. The CEN appoints CEP (Provincial Electoral Commission), which in turn appoints CEM (Municipal Electoral Commission). The latter lead formation of electoral commissions at the grassroots. There are roughly 1450 people in each of these &quot;circunscripcións&quot;.

For the purpose of Municipal elections, each &quot;circunscripción&quot; is further divided into two to eight areas with the goal of allowing nomination meetings to be very compressed and based on the grassroots. The number of nomination areas is determined by the population in the &quot;circunscripción&quot;. In rural areas, extension of territory is also taken into consideration. People have the right to participate, nominate and vote only in the area in which they live. Nomination area assembly meetings are normally held in public areas at eight o&#x27;clock in the evening on weekdays or during the day on the weekend. Each assembly is presided over by the local electoral commission. Individuals have the right to propose anyone who lives in their &quot;circunscripción&quot; as long as the person has indicated they are willing to be nominated. The person nominating must provide a reason for nomination. Others have the right to argue against a nomination. When this is done, a show-of-hands vote is taken and counted by the electoral commission. The person with the most votes becomes the candidate for that nomination area. In order to ensure the law is being followed, members of CEP make surprise visits to nomination meetings.

Once candidates have been nominated, the local electoral commission obtains a short biographical profile and a photo from them. These are posted in local public spaces for easy access to voters. This is the only publicity permitted under the electoral law. Voters are expected to read the profiles in order to make their choice. Campaigning is not permitted. Duharte Díaz, professor at University of Havana, is of the opinion that posting profiles is insufficient and that more should be done to present the candidates.

Municipal elections are usually held in October. On the day of the vote, held always on a Sunday, voters confirm their voting eligibility by presenting their identification cards and are then handed a ballot with names of candidates nominated in their &quot;circunscripción&quot;. Voting is secret. To win, a candidate must receive at least 50% plus one of the vote. If this does not happen, the candidate who placed last is eliminated and voting is repeated with remaining candidates.

Candidates elected in municipal elections carry out their functions on a voluntary basis after their regular work hours. Once municipal assemblies are constituted, they elect their presidents and vice-presidents from among themselves. These individuals are the only ones who are full-time, earning the same salary as they received at their place of work.

Second phase, elections to ANPP (Parliament), is different from municipal elections. Up to half of the members of parliament are nominated from individuals elected in municipal election. The rest are nominated by mass organisations. These are Workers&#x27; Central Union of Cuba, Federation of Cuban Women, National Association of Small Farmers, Federation of University Students, Federation of Pre-University Students and Committees for the Defense of the Revolution. To propose candidates for elections each of the six mass organisations assembles at all three levels in plenary sessions to propose candidates from the population. The goal is to obtain a pool of potential candidates representing a wide cross-section of the population. Because of this, each of the mass organisations at all three levels (municipal, provincial, national) has the right to propose at least three times the number of candidates needed for each municipality to be represented in the parliament. The proposals are sent to CCN (National Candidacies Commission) which then reduces the list down to the number of seats.

Before elections (that usually happen in January), meetings between candidates and workers are held in places of work and in the neighbourhoods. Similarly to municipal elections, the only publicity allowed is a short biography and a photo. Elections happen on a Sunday. Voters are given a ballot with the names of candidates chosen by the CCN to represent their municipality. They can choose to vote for all, some or none of the candidates. To be elected, a candidate must receive at least 50% plus one of the valid votes. If they do not, a new candidate is chosen for the seat and voting repeated.

== Foreign relations ==

Cuba&#x27;s foreign policy has been scaled back and redirected as a result of economic hardship after the collapse of the Soviet bloc. Without massive Soviet subsidies and its primary trading partner Cuba was comparatively isolated in the 1990s, but has since entered bilateral co-operation with several South American countries, most notably Venezuela and Bolivia. Cuba has normal diplomatic and economic relations with every country in the Western hemisphere except the United States.
The United States continues an embargo &quot;so long as [Cuba] continues to refuse to move toward democratization and greater respect for human rights.&quot;
The European Union accuses Cuba of &quot;continuing flagrant violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms&quot;, but also &quot;Reiterates its condemnation of the US embargo on Cuba, and calls for it to be lifted forthwith, as the UN General Assembly has repeatedly demanded.&quot;

Cuba has developed a growing relationship with the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Russia. In all, Cuba continues to have formal relations with 160 nations, and provided civilian assistance workers – principally medical – in more than 20 nations. More than two million exiles have escaped to foreign countries. Cuba&#x27;s present Minister of Foreign Affairs is Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla.

== Authoritarianism ==

Some political scientists characterize the political system of Cuba as non-democratic and authoritarian., while others challenge this characterization. It is a single-party state where political opposition is not permitted. The function of the party is different to that in liberal democracies. It does not propose candidates and is not allowed to influence elections. Candidates are instead nominated directly by citizens with a show of hands in &quot;circunscripciones&quot; (very small districts). Critics challenge whether this is democratic. Censorship of information (including limits to internet access) is extensive, and independent journalism is repressed in Cuba; Reporters Without Borders has characterized Cuba as one of the worst countries in the world for press freedom.

Officially, Cuba frames itself as a &quot;people&#x27;s democracy&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;liberal democracy&quot; of Western states. Cuba thus rejects criticism of its political system as a lack of appreciation for different forms of democracy other than those in capitalist states. It alludes to the grass roots elements in the nomination of candidates at neighborhood level (in the so-called &quot;circunscripciónes&quot;).

Opposition groups inside and outside the country as well as a summary published by Human Rights Watch and certain foreign governments have described the Cuban political system as undemocratic. On the other hand, Cuba is a member of organisations ALBA and CELAC, that consider themselves democratic. The United States Government has initiated various policy measures ostensibly designed to urge Cuba to undertake political change towards a multi-party electoral system. These plans have been condemned by the Cuban Government, who accuses the United States of meddling in Cuba&#x27;s affairs.

== Human rights ==
According to Human Rights Watch, Castro constructed a &quot;repressive machinery&quot; that continues to deprive Cubans of their basic rights. The Cuban government has been accused of numerous human rights abuses, including torture, arbitrary imprisonment, unfair trials, and extrajudicial executions (a.k.a. &quot;El Paredón&quot;). Human Rights Watch reports that the government represses nearly all forms of political dissent.

The country&#x27;s first ever transgender municipal delegate was elected in the province of Villa Clara in early 2013. Adela Hernández is a resident of the town of Caibarién and works as a nurse electrocardiogram specialist. In Cuba, delegates are not professional politicians and, therefore, do not receive a government salary.

In 2022, the Family Code constitutional amendment passed. This followed hundreds of painstaking assembly discussions within communities and institutions across the island. This Code ensures the protection of rights of adoption, surrogacy, transgender-affirmation, same-sex marriages and the legitimacy of intergenerational households.

== Corruption ==
The 2012 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index ranked Cuba 58th out of 176 countries, tied with Jordan and Namibia. and has lower levels than most of the other countries in the Caribbean and Central America. In 2006, it was ranked in 112th place, tied with India.

<text>Telecommunications in [[Cuba]] consists mainly of NTSC analog television, analog radio, telephony, AMPS, D-AMPS, and GSM mobile telephony, and the Internet. Telephone service is provided through ETECSA (Telecommunications Company of Cuba), mobile telephone service is provided through the Cellular Telephone Company of Cuba (CUBACEL) and, previously, Caribbean Cellular (&quot;Celulares del Caribe&quot;, C-COM - no longer operating). Cuba&#x27;s main international telecommunications links are through Intersputnik, with limited effectiveness of undersea telephone cables to the Americas, Spain, and possibly Italy due to underdevelopment.

==Telephone==

Country code: +53

International call prefix: 00

(https://it.granma.cu/cuba/2019-04-26/etecsa-installera-il-codice-daccesso-00)

Telephones – main lines in use:
1.2 million, 72nd in the world, less than 10 per 100 inhabitants (2009).

Telephones – mobile cellular: One million mobile phones at the end of 2010 (9 per 100 inhabitants), up from 621,000 in 2009 and 330,000 in 2008, when all Cubans were allowed to buy and use them for the first time. Mobile-cellular telephone service is expensive, which limits subscribership. By the end of 2020, Etecsa announced that they had 6.661 million mobile telephone users of whom 4.421 million had Internet.

Telephone system:
95% of telephone switches were digitized by end of 2006. The principal trunk system is coaxial cable; fiber-optic distribution is used in Havana and on Isla de la Juventud; two microwave radio relay installations (one is old, US-built; the other newer, Soviet-built); both analog and digital mobile cellular service established; one international satellite earth station, Intersputnik (Atlantic Ocean region).

New fiber-optic link:
A new undersea fiber-optic link with Venezuela was scheduled for 2011. In May 2012 there were reports that the cable was operational, but with use restricted to Cuban and Venezuelan government entities. Internet access by the general public still used the slower and more expensive satellite links, until January 2013 when Internet speeds increased.

==Radio==
Radio broadcast stations:
6 national radio networks, an international station, and many local radio stations. All state-owned and operated by the Cuban Radio and Television Corporation (ICRT), which manages Radio Rebelde, the largest AM network, and the SW service Radio Habana Cuba. Radio Marti, based in Miami, Florida, and financed by the United States government, transmits Spanish-language radio broadcasts to Cuba.

Radios:
3.9 million, 64th out of 188 in the world (1997)

==Television==

Television broadcast stations:

Four national TV networks and many local TV stations. All state-owned and operated by the Cuban Radio and Television Corporation (ICRT). TV Marti, based in Miami, Florida, and financed by the United States government, transmits Spanish language TV broadcasts to Cuba. The American Forces Network (AFN) has a station intended for U.S. military personnel at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.

Televisions:

2.64 million, 54th out of 185 in the world (1997)

==Internet==

Internet users: total: 6,353,020 percent of population: 57.15% (July 2018 est.) Ranking 76th in the world for total users.

Internet service providers (ISPs): Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba S.A (ETECSA)

Top-level domain: .cu

Access to the Internet was heavily controlled, and all e-mails are closely monitored.

The Cuban authorities have called the Internet &quot;the great disease of 21st century&quot; due to &#x27;counter-revolutionary&#x27; information being available on a number of websites, some of which are official news sites. As a result of computer ownership bans, computer ownership rates were among the world&#x27;s lowest. However, since buying a computer was legalized in 2007, the ownership of computers in Cuba soared, dramatically increasing the number of Internet users. But, the rates still remained quite low, partially due to the high costs of systems and Internet usage per hour in contrast to the average monthly wage.

In 2019, ETECSA began offering Internet connection via Cubacel mobile telephones which was increased with 4G. In March 2021, they announced that 4G had reached every municipality in the country.

<text>The Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (; FAR) are the military forces of Cuba. They include Revolutionary Army, Revolutionary Navy, Revolutionary Air and Air Defense Force, and other paramilitary bodies including the Territorial Troops Militia ( – MTT), Youth Labor Army ( – EJT), and the Defense and Production Brigades ( – BPD), plus the Civil Defense Organization ( – DCC) and the National Reserves Institution ( – INRE). All these groups are subordinated to the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces ( – MINFAR).

The armed forces have long been the most powerful institution in Cuba. The military manages many enterprises in key economic sectors representing about 4% of the Cuban economy. The military has also served as former Cuban Communist Party First Secretary, as well as former President of Cuba, Raúl Castro&#x27;s base. In numerous speeches, Raúl Castro emphasized the military&#x27;s role as a &quot;people&#x27;s partner&quot;.

==History==
The Cuban Army in its original form was first established in 1868 by Cuban revolutionaries during the Ten Years&#x27; War. It joined the Allies in the World War I in April 1917 and supplied sugar to several countries, mainly the United States of America. Was involved in the Battle of the Caribbean during World War II when it was part of the Allies supported by the United States. After the Cuban Revolution had overthrown Fulgencio Batista&#x27;s government, the Cuban Rebel Army under Fidel Castro&#x27;s leadership was reorganized into the current armed forces of Cuba.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union granted both military and financial aid to Cuba. From 1966 until the late 1980s, Soviet Government military assistance enabled Cuba to upgrade its military capabilities to number one in Latin America and project power abroad. The first Cuban military mission in Africa was established in Ghana in 1961. Cuba&#x27;s military forces appeared in Algeria, in 1963, when a military medical brigade came to support the government. In 1966 and 1967 little forces of Cuba landed in Venezuelan coast to support leftist guerilla of the FALN. Since the 1960s, Cuba sent military forces to African and Arab countries – Syria in 1973, Ethiopia in 1978, Angola from 1975 to 1989, and Nicaragua, El Salvador and reportedly Afghanistan during the 1980s. The tonnage of Soviet military deliveries to Cuba throughout most of the 1980s exceeded deliveries in any year since the military build-up during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. According to an Afghan Army defector and the Mujahideen, Cuban forces were present in 1981 during the Soviet–Afghan War and were described as &quot;big and black and shout very loudly when they fight. Unlike the Russians, they were not afraid to attack us in the open.&quot;

In 1989, the government instituted a clean-up of the armed forces and the Ministry of Interior, convicting army Major General and Hero of the Republic of Cuba Arnaldo Ochoa, Ministry of Interior Colonel Antonio de la Guardia (Tony la Guardia), and Ministry of Interior Brigadier General Patricio de la Guardia on charges of corruption and drug trafficking. This judgment is known in Cuba as &quot;Causa 1&quot; (Cause 1). Ochoa and Antonio de la Guardia were executed. Following the executions, the Army was drastically downsized, the Ministry of Interior was moved under the informal control of Revolutionary Armed Forces chief General Raúl Castro (Fidel Castro&#x27;s brother), and large numbers of army officers were moved into the Ministry of Interior.

The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency reported in 1998 that the country&#x27;s paramilitary organizations, the Territorial Militia Troops, the Youth Labor Army, and the Naval Militia had suffered considerable morale and training degradation over the previous seven years but still retained the potential to &quot;make an enemy invasion costly.&quot; Cuba also adopted a &quot;war of the people&quot; strategy that highlights the defensive nature of its capabilities.

Cuban military power was sharply reduced by the loss of Soviet subsidies following the end of the Cold War, and today the Revolutionary Armed Forces number 39,000 regular troops.

In April 2021, longtime Chief of Staff Álvaro López Miera took over as the Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces.

;First Deputy Minister, Chief of General Staff
==Revolutionary Army==
The Central Intelligence Agency wrote in May 1979 that when &quot;the economy took a downturn in 1970, the Castro regime, partly at Soviet urging, reduced its forces by some 60 per cent, eventually freeing more than 150,000 people for full-time civilian employment. All branches of the armed services except the Air Force were affected noticeably. The Air Defence Force shrank from six brigades and 24 occupied SA-2 surface-to-air missile sites to three brigades and 18 sites, leaving eastern Cuba unprotected by surface-to-air missiles. The Navy lost a number of radar surveillance posts, again to the detriment of eastern Cuba. The Army was more than halved in size and reorganised.&quot; (PA79-10173D)

In 1984, according to &quot;Jane&#x27;s Military Review&quot;, there were three major geographical commands, Western, Central, and Eastern. There were a reported 130,000 all ranks, and each command was garrisoned by an army comprising a single armored division, a mechanized division, and a corps of three infantry divisions, though the Eastern Command had two corps totaling six divisions. There was also an independent military region, with a single infantry division, which garrisoned the Isle of Youth.

A U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessment in the first half of 1998 said that the army&#x27;s armor and artillery units were at low readiness levels due to &#x27;severely reduced&#x27; training, generally incapable of mounting effective operations above the battalion level, and that equipment was mostly in storage and unavailable at short notice. The same report said that Cuban special operations forces continue to train but on a smaller scale than beforehand, and that while the lack of replacement parts for its existing equipment and the current severe shortage of fuel were increasingly affecting operational capabilities, Cuba remained able to offer considerable resistance to any regional power.

==Revolutionary Air and Air Defence Force==
The Cuban Revolutionary Air and Air Defence Force (DAAFAR) was used in the 1980s with the help of the Soviet Union to be able to project power abroad, especially in Africa. During that time Cuba sent jet fighters and transports for deployment in conflict zones such as Angola and Ethiopia.

In 1990, Cuba&#x27;s Air Force was the best equipped in Latin America. In all, the modern Cuban Air Force had approximately 230 fixed-wing aircraft. Although there is no exact figure available, Western analysts estimate that at least 130 (with only 25 operational) of these planes are still in service spread out among the thirteen military airbases on the island.

In 1996, fighters from the DAAFAR shot down two Cessna aircraft based in Florida which were incorrectly suspected of dropping leaflets into Cuban airspace. The air force was criticised for not giving the pilots of the aircraft options other than being shot down. One aircraft escaped.

In 1998, according to the same DIA report mentioned above, the air force had &quot;fewer than 24 operational Mikoyan-Gurevich (MiG) fighters; pilot training barely adequate to maintain proficiency; a declining number of fighter sorties, surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft guns to respond to attacking air forces.&quot;

By 2007 the International Institute for Strategic Studies assessed the force as 8,000 strong with 41 combat capable aircraft and a further 188 stored. DAAFAR is known now to have acquired another MiG-29 and a few MiG-23s, giving it 58 combat aircraft in active service. These are listed as 6 MiG-29s, 40 MiG-23s, and 12 MiG-21s. IISS also estimated DAAFAR had 12 operational transport aircraft, plus trainers which include 8 L-39C, and helicopters, mainly Mil Mi-8, Mil Mi-17, and Mil Mi-24 Hind. Raúl Castro ordered in 2010 that all MiG-29 pilots had to have full training, they now have from 200–250 hours of flight annually together with real dogfight training and exercises. Up to 20 MiG-23 units also have this kind of training but the other 16 MiG-23 units spend more time in simulators than real flight. MiG-21 units have limited time in these training exercises and spend more time in simulators and maintain their skills flying with Aerogaviota, the commercial brand of the air force.

==Revolutionary Navy==

In 1988, the Cuban Navy boasted 12,000 men, three submarines, two modern guided-missile frigates, one intelligence vessel, and a large number of patrol craft and minesweepers. However, most of the Soviet-made vessels have been decommissioned or sunk to make reefs. By 2007, the Cuban Navy was assessed as being 3,000 strong (including up to 550+ Navy Infantry) by the IISS with six Osa-II missile boats and one . The Cuban Navy also includes a small marine battalion called the &quot;Desembarco de Granma&quot;. It once numbered 550 men, though its present size is not known.

After the old Soviet submarines were put out of service, Cuba searched for help from North Korea&#x27;s experience in midget submarines. North Korean defectors claimed to have seen Cubans in mid to late 1990s in a secret submarine base. Years later, a single picture became public of a small black native submarine in Havana harbor. It is rumored to be called &#x27;Delfin&#x27; and is to be armed with two torpedoes. Only a single boat is in service and the design appears original, even if influenced both by North Korea and Soviet designs.

The Cuban Navy rebuilt one, large ex-Spanish &quot;Rio Damuji&quot; fishing boat. &quot;BP-390&quot; is now armed with two C-201W missiles, one twin 57 mm gun mount, two twin 25 mm gun mounts and on 14.5 mm machine gun. This vessel is larger than the , and it is used as a helicopter carrier patrol vessel. A second unit (&quot;BP-391&quot;) was converted and entered service in 2016.

The Cuban Navy today operates its own missile systems, the made-in-Cuba Bandera (a copy of the dated Styx Soviet missiles) and Remulgadas anti-ship missile systems, as well as the nationally produced Frontera self-propelled coastal defence multiple rocket launcher. The navy&#x27;s principal threats are drug smuggling and illegal immigration. The country&#x27;s geographical position and limited naval presence has enabled traffickers to utilise Cuban territorial waters and airspace.

The Cuban Navy&#x27;s air wing is an ASW helicopter operator only and is equipped with 2 Mi-14 Haze helicopters.

== Special Forces ==

The (), also known formally as the Mobile Brigade of Special Troops (BMTE) is a special forces unit in the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces. It is often identified as Military Unit 4895
Desembarco de Granma is a small marine battalion with Marines like role.

== Paramilitary forces ==

=== Territorial Troops Militia ===
The Territorial Troops Militia is composed exclusively of civilian volunteers, under the command of MINFAR. It reinforced the notion of the popular will to defend the Revolution. In general, the militia is a part-time force with only light arms that are issued only on occasion.

=== Youth Labor Army ===
The Youth Labor Army ( – EJT) is, by law, a paramilitary organization under the direct control of MINFAR. It was formally established on 3 August 1973 by combining the Centennial Youth Column (CJC) and the Permanent Infantry Divisions (DIP). Cuba&#x27;s compulsory service laws require all male citizens to serve for three years in the EJT. The formation of the EJT allowed the army to devote itself full time to military matters. The EJT served as a reserve force in its first 20 years. In 1993, it was assigned the responsibility of managing the state farms.

=== Border Troops ===
The Border Troops of the Republic of Cuba () is a branch that ensures the protection of the state borders and territorial waters. They are subordinate to the Interior Ministry (MININT). The official date of the establishment of this service was on September 23, 1970. In the second half of the 1970s, several agreements were signed, according to which some changes were made to border protection, including a 1976 agreement was signed between Cuba and Mexico on the delimitation of the exclusive economic zone in the sector of the Cuban-Mexican maritime border and a 1977 agreement was signed on the maritime border between Cuba and Haiti. The Border Troops are de facto both a border guard and a coast guard force, and all new officers are commissioned from the Granma Naval Academy.

<doc id="73252" wikidata="Q207676" url="?curid=73252" title="Frank Miller">
<text>Frank Miller (born January 27, 1957) is an American comic book artist, comic book writer, and screenwriter known for his comic book stories and graphic novels such as his run on &quot;Daredevil&quot;, for which he created the character Elektra, and subsequent &quot;Daredevil: Born Again&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Sin City&quot;, &quot;Ronin&quot;, and &quot;300&quot;.

Miller is noted for combining film noir and manga influences in his comic art creations. He said: &quot;I realized when I started &quot;Sin City&quot; that I found American and English comics be too wordy, too constipated, and Japanese comics to be too empty. So I was attempting to do a hybrid.&quot; Miller has received every major comic book industry award, and in 2015 he was inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame.

Miller&#x27;s feature film work includes writing the scripts for the 1990s science fiction films &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; and &quot;RoboCop 3&quot;, sharing directing duties with Robert Rodriguez on &quot;Sin City&quot; and &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot;, producing the film &quot;300&quot;, and directing the film adaptation of &quot;The Spirit&quot;. &quot;Sin City&quot; earned a Palme d&#x27;Or nomination.

==Early life==
Miller was born in Olney, Maryland, on January 27, 1957, and raised in Montpelier, Vermont, the fifth of seven children of a nurse mother and a carpenter/electrician father. His family was Irish Catholic.

==Career==
Miller grew up a comics fan; a letter he wrote to Marvel Comics was published in &quot;The Cat&quot; #3 (April 1973). His first published work was at Western Publishing&#x27;s Gold Key Comics imprint, received at the recommendation of comics artist Neal Adams, to whom a fledgling Miller, after moving to New York City, had shown samples and received much critique and occasional informal lessons. Though no published credits appear, he is tentatively credited with the three-page story &quot;Royal Feast&quot; in the licensed TV series comic book &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; #84 (June 1978), by an unknown writer, and is credited with the five-page &quot;Endless Cloud&quot;, also by an unknown writer, in the following issue (July 1978). By the time of the latter, Miller had his first confirmed credit in writer Wyatt Gwyon&#x27;s six-page &quot;Deliver Me From D-Day&quot;, inked by Danny Bulanadi, in &quot;Weird War Tales&quot; #64 (June 1978).

Former Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter recalled Miller going to DC Comics after having broken in with &quot;a small job from Western Publishing, I think. Thus emboldened, he went to DC, and after getting savaged by Joe Orlando, got in to see art director Vinnie Colletta, who recognized talent and arranged for him to get a one-page war-comic job.&quot; The Grand Comics Database does not list this job; there may have been a one-page DC story, or Shooter may have misremembered the page count or have been referring to the two-page story, by writer Roger McKenzie, as &quot;Slowly, painfully, you dig your way from the cold, choking debris&quot; in &quot;Weird War Tales&quot; #68 (October 1978). Other fledgling work at DC included the six-page &quot;The Greatest Story Never Told&quot;, by writer Paul Kupperberg, in that same issue, and the five-page &quot;The Edge of History&quot;, written by Elliot S. Maggin, in &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot; #219 (September 1978). His first work for Marvel Comics was penciling the 17-page story &quot;The Master Assassin of Mars, Part 3&quot; in &quot;John Carter, Warlord of Mars&quot; #18 (November 1978).

At Marvel, Miller settled in as a regular fill-in and cover artist, working on a variety of titles. One of these jobs was drawing &quot;Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #27–28 (February–March 1979), which guest-starred Daredevil. At the time, sales of the &quot;Daredevil&quot; title were poor but Miller saw potential in &quot;a blind protagonist in a purely visual medium&quot;, as he recalled in 2000. Miller went to writer and staffer Jo Duffy (a mentor-figure whom he called his &quot;guardian angel&quot; at Marvel) and she passed on his interest to editor-in-chief Jim Shooter to get Miller work on Daredevil&#x27;s regular title. Shooter agreed and made Miller the new penciller on the title. As Miller recalled in 2008: 

===&quot;Daredevil&quot; and the early 1980s===
&quot;Daredevil&quot; #158 (May 1979), Miller&#x27;s debut on that title, was the finale of an ongoing story written by Roger McKenzie and inked by Klaus Janson. After this issue, Miller became one of Marvel&#x27;s rising stars. However, sales on &quot;Daredevil&quot; did not improve, Marvel&#x27;s management continued to discuss cancellation, and Miller himself almost quit the series, as he disliked McKenzie&#x27;s scripts. Miller&#x27;s fortunes changed with the arrival of Denny O&#x27;Neil as editor. Realizing Miller&#x27;s unhappiness with the series, and impressed by a backup story Miller had written, O&#x27;Neil moved McKenzie to another project so that Miller could try writing the series himself. Miller and O&#x27;Neil maintained a friendly working relationship throughout his run on the series. With issue #168 (Jan. 1981), Miller took over full duties as writer and penciller. Sales rose so swiftly that Marvel once again began publishing &quot;Daredevil&quot; monthly rather than bimonthly just three issues after Miller became its writer.

Issue #168 saw the first full appearance of the ninja mercenary Elektra—who became a popular character and star in a 2005 motion picture—although her first cover appearance was four months earlier on Miller&#x27;s cover of &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; #58. Miller later wrote and drew a solo Elektra story in &quot;Bizarre Adventures&quot; #28 (Oct. 1981). He added a martial arts aspect to Daredevil&#x27;s fighting skills, and introduced previously unseen characters who had played a major part in the character&#x27;s youth: Stick, leader of the ninja clan the Chaste, who had been Murdock&#x27;s sensei after he was blinded and a rival clan called the Hand.

Unable to handle both writing and penciling &quot;Daredevil&quot; on the new monthly schedule, Miller began increasingly relying on Janson for the artwork, sending him looser and looser pencils beginning with #173. By issue #185, Miller had virtually relinquished his role as Daredevil&#x27;s artist, and he was providing only rough layouts for Janson to both pencil and ink, allowing Miller to focus on the writing.

Miller&#x27;s work on Daredevil was characterized by darker themes and stories. This peaked when in #181 (April 1982) he had the assassin Bullseye kill Elektra, and Daredevil subsequently attempt to kill him. Miller finished his &quot;Daredevil&quot; run with issue #191 (February 1983), which he cited in a winter 1983 interview as the issue he is most proud of; by this time, he had transformed a second-tier character into one of Marvel&#x27;s most popular. Additionally, Miller drew a short Batman Christmas story, &quot;Wanted: Santa Claus – Dead or Alive&quot;, written by Dennis O&#x27;Neil for &quot;DC Special Series&quot; #21 (Spring 1980). This was his first professional experience with a character with which, like Daredevil, he became closely associated. At Marvel, O&#x27;Neil and Miller collaborated on two issues of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot;. The 1980 Annual featured a team-up with Doctor Strange while the 1981 Annual showcased a meeting with the Punisher.

As penciller and co-plotter, Miller, together with writer Chris Claremont, produced the miniseries &quot;Wolverine&quot; #1–4 (Sept.-Dec. 1982), inked by Josef Rubinstein and spinning off from the popular &quot;X-Men&quot; title. Miller used this miniseries to expand on Wolverine&#x27;s character. The series was a critical success and further cemented Miller&#x27;s place as an industry star. His first creator-owned title was DC Comics&#x27; six-issue miniseries &quot;Ronin&quot; (1983–1984). In 1985, DC Comics named Miller as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th-anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;.

Miller was involved in a few unpublished projects in the early 1980s. A house advertisement for &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; appeared in Marvel Comics cover-dated February 1981. It stated &quot;Watch for the new adventures of Earth&#x27;s Sorcerer Supreme—as mystically conjured by Roger Stern and Frank Miller!&quot;. Miller&#x27;s only contribution to the series was the cover for &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; #46 (April 1981). Other commitments prevented him from working on the series. Miller and Steve Gerber made a proposal to revamp DC&#x27;s three biggest characters: Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, under a line called &quot;Metropolis&quot; and comics titled &quot;Man of Steel&quot; or &quot;The Man of Steel&quot;, &quot;Dark Knight&quot; and &quot;Amazon&quot;. However, this proposal was not accepted.

===&quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns&quot; and the late 1980s===
In 1986, DC Comics released the writer–penciller Miller&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, a four-issue miniseries printed in what the publisher called &quot;prestige format&quot;—squarebound, rather than stapled; on heavy-stock paper rather than newsprint, and with cardstock rather than glossy-paper covers. It was inked by Klaus Janson and colored by Lynn Varley. The story tells how Batman retired after the death of the second Robin (Jason Todd) and, at age 55, returns to fight crime in a dark and violent future. Miller created a tough, gritty Batman, referring to him as &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; based upon his being called the &quot;Darknight Detective&quot; in some 1970s portrayals, although the nickname &quot;Dark Knight&quot; for Batman dates back to 1940. Released the same year as Alan Moore&#x27;s and Dave Gibbons&#x27; DC miniseries &quot;Watchmen&quot;, it showcased a new form of more adult-oriented storytelling to both comics fans and a crossover mainstream audience. &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; influenced the comic-book industry by heralding a new wave of darker characters. The trade paperback collection proved to be a big seller for DC and remains in print.

By this time, Miller had returned as the writer of &quot;Daredevil&quot;. Following his self-contained story &quot;Badlands&quot;, penciled by John Buscema, in #219 (June 1985), he co-wrote #226 (Jan. 1986) with departing writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil. Then, with artist David Mazzucchelli, he crafted a seven-issue story arc that, like &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, similarly redefined and reinvigorated its main character. The storyline, &quot;Daredevil: Born Again&quot;, in #227–233 (February–August 1986) chronicled the hero&#x27;s Catholic background and the destruction and rebirth of his real-life identity, Manhattan attorney Matt Murdock, at the hands of Daredevil&#x27;s nemesis, the crime lord Wilson Fisk, also known as the Kingpin. After completing the &quot;Born Again&quot; arc, Frank Miller intended to produce a two-part story with artist Walt Simonson but it was never completed and remains unpublished.

Miller and artist Bill Sienkiewicz produced the graphic novel &quot;Daredevil: Love and War&quot; in 1986. Featuring the character of the Kingpin, it indirectly bridges Miller&#x27;s first run on &quot;Daredevil&quot; and &quot;Born Again&quot; by explaining the change in the Kingpin&#x27;s attitude toward Daredevil. Miller and Sienkiewicz also produced the eight-issue miniseries &quot;&quot; for Epic Comics. Set outside regular Marvel continuity, it featured a wild tale of cyborgs and ninjas, while expanding further on Elektra&#x27;s background. Both of these projects were critically well received. &quot;Elektra: Assassin&quot; was praised for its bold storytelling, but neither it nor &quot;Daredevil: Love and War&quot; had the influence or reached as many readers as &quot;Dark Knight Returns&quot; or &quot;Born Again&quot;.

Miller&#x27;s final major story in this period was in &quot;Batman&quot; issues 404–407 in 1987, another collaboration with Mazzucchelli. Titled &quot;&quot;, this was Miller&#x27;s version of the origin of Batman in which he retconned many details and adapted the story to fit his &quot;Dark Knight&quot; continuity. Proving to be hugely popular, this was as influential as Miller&#x27;s previous work. A trade paperback released in 1988 remains in print, and is one of DC&#x27;s best selling books. The story was adapted as an in 2011.

Miller illustrated the covers for the first twelve issues of First Comics&#x27; English-language reprints of Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima&#x27;s &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;. This helped bring Japanese manga to a wider Western audience. During this time, Miller (along with Marv Wolfman, Alan Moore, and Howard Chaykin) had been in dispute with DC Comics over a proposed ratings system for comics. Disagreeing with what he saw as censorship, Miller refused to do any further work for DC, and he took his future projects to the independent publisher Dark Horse Comics. From then on Miller was a major supporter of creator rights and became a major voice against censorship in comics.

===The 1990s: &quot;Sin City&quot; and &quot;300&quot;===
After announcing he intended to release his work only via the independent publisher Dark Horse Comics, Miller completed one final project for Epic Comics, the mature-audience imprint of Marvel Comics. &quot;Elektra Lives Again&quot; was a fully painted graphic novel written and drawn by Miller and colored by longtime partner Lynn Varley. Telling the story of the resurrection of Elektra from the dead and Daredevil&#x27;s quest to find her, as well as showing Miller&#x27;s will to experiment with new story-telling techniques.

1990 saw Miller and artist Geof Darrow start work on &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;, a three-issue miniseries. The title, a mix of violence and satire, was praised for Darrow&#x27;s highly detailed art and Miller&#x27;s writing. At the same time, Miller and artist Dave Gibbons produced &quot;Give Me Liberty&quot;, a four-issue miniseries for Dark Horse. &quot;Give Me Liberty&quot; was followed by sequel miniseries and specials expanding on the story of protagonist Martha Washington, an African-American woman in modern and near-future North America, all of which were written by Miller and drawn by Gibbons.

Miller wrote the scripts for the science fiction films &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; and &quot;RoboCop 3&quot;, about a police cyborg. Neither was critically well received. In 2007, Miller stated that &quot;There was a lot of interference in the writing process. It wasn&#x27;t ideal. After working on the two Robocop movies, I really thought that was it for me in the business of film.&quot; Miller came into contact with the fictional cyborg once more, writing the comic-book miniseries &quot;RoboCop Versus The Terminator&quot;, with art by Walter Simonson. In 2003, Miller&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; was adapted by Steven Grant for Avatar Press&#x27;s Pulsaar imprint. Illustrated by Juan Jose Ryp, the series is called &quot;Frank Miller&#x27;s RoboCop&quot; and contains plot elements that were divided between &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; and &quot;RoboCop 3&quot;.

In 1991, Miller started work on his first &quot;Sin City&quot; story. Serialized in &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; #51–62, it proved to be another success, and the story was released in a trade paperback. This first Sin City &quot;yarn&quot; was rereleased in 1995 under the name &quot;The Hard Goodbye&quot;. &quot;Sin City&quot; proved to be Miller&#x27;s main project for much of the remainder of the decade, as Miller told more Sin City stories within this noir world of his creation, in the process helping to revitalize the crime comics genre. &quot;Sin City&quot; proved artistically auspicious for Miller and again brought his work to a wider audience without comics. Miller lived in Los Angeles, California in the 1990s, which influenced &quot;Sin City&quot;. He later lived in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood of New York City, which was also an influence.

&quot;&quot; was a five issue miniseries published by Marvel Comics in 1993. In this story, Miller and artist John Romita Jr. told Daredevil&#x27;s origins differently from in the previous comics, and they provided additional detail to his beginnings. Miller also returned to superheroes by writing issue #11 of Todd McFarlane&#x27;s &quot;Spawn&quot;, as well as the &quot;Spawn/Batman&quot; crossover for Image Comics.

In 1994, Miller became one of the founding members of the comic imprint Legend, under which many of his Sin City works were released via Dark Horse Comics. In 1995, Miller and Darrow collaborated again on &quot;Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot&quot;, published as a two-part miniseries by Dark Horse. In 1999, it became an animated series on &quot;Fox Kids&quot;.

Written and illustrated by Miller with painted colors by Varley, &quot;300&quot; was a 1998 comic-book miniseries, released as a hardcover collection in 1999, retelling the Battle of Thermopylae and the events leading up to it from the perspective of Leonidas of Sparta. &quot;300&quot; was particularly inspired by the 1962 film &quot;The 300 Spartans&quot;, a movie that Miller watched as a young boy.
===&quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot; and 2000–2019===
He was one of the artists on the &quot;Superman and Batman: World&#x27;s Funnest&quot; one-shot written by Evan Dorkin published in 2000. Miller moved back to Hell&#x27;s Kitchen by 2001 and was creating &quot;&quot; as the 9/11 terrorist attacks occurred about four miles from that neighborhood. His differences with DC Comics put aside, he saw the sequel initially released as a three-issue miniseries, and though it sold well, it received a mixed to negative reception. Miller also returned to writing Batman in 2005, taking on the writing duties of &quot;All Star Batman &amp; Robin, the Boy Wonder&quot;, a series set inside of what Miller describes as the &quot;Dark Knight Universe,&quot; and drawn by Jim Lee. &quot;All Star Batman &amp; Robin, the Boy Wonder&quot; also received largely negative reviews.

Miller&#x27;s previous attitude towards movie adaptations was to change after Robert Rodriguez made a short film based on a story from Miller&#x27;s &quot;Sin City&quot; entitled &quot;The Customer is Always Right&quot;. Miller was pleased with the result, leading to him and Rodriguez directing a full-length film, &quot;Sin City&quot; using Miller&#x27;s original comics panels as storyboards. The film was released in the U.S. on April 1, 2005. The film&#x27;s success brought renewed attention to Miller&#x27;s &quot;Sin City&quot; projects. Similarly, a 2006 film adaptation of &quot;300&quot;, directed by Zack Snyder, brought new attention to Miller&#x27;s original comic book work. A sequel to the film, &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot;, based on Miller&#x27;s second &quot;Sin City&quot; series and co-directed by Miller and Robert Rodriguez, was released in theaters on August 22, 2014.
In July 2011, while at San Diego Comic-Con promoting his upcoming graphic novel &quot;Holy Terror&quot;, in which the protagonist hero fights Al-Qaeda terrorists, Miller made a remark about Islamic terrorism and Islam, saying, &quot;I was raised Catholic and I could tell you a lot about the Spanish Inquisition, but the mysteries of the Catholic Church elude me. And I could tell you a lot about Al-Qaeda, but the mysteries of Islam elude me too.&quot;

In November 2011, Miller posted remarks pertaining to the Occupy Wall Street movement on his blog, calling it &quot;nothing but a pack of louts, thieves, and rapists, fed by Woodstock-era nostalgia and putrid false righteousness.&quot; He said of the movement, &quot;Wake up, pond scum. America is at war against a ruthless enemy. Maybe, between bouts of self-pity and all the other tasty tidbits of narcissism you&#x27;ve been served up in your sheltered, comfy little worlds, you&#x27;ve heard terms like al-Qaeda and Islamicism.&quot; Miller&#x27;s statement was criticised by fellow comic writer Alan Moore. In a 2018 interview, Miller backed away from his comments saying that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t thinking clearly&quot; when he made them and alluded to a very dark time in his life during which they were made.

On July 10, 2015, at San Diego Comic-Con, Miller was inducted into the Eisner Awards Hall of Fame. From 2015 to 2017, DC released a nine-issue, bimonthly sequel to &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot;, titled &quot;The Dark Knight III: The Master Race&quot;. Miller co-wrote it with Brian Azzarello, and Andy Kubert and Klaus Janson were the artists. Issue one was the top-selling comic of November 2015, moving an estimated 440,234 copies. In 2016, Miller and Azzarello also co-wrote the graphic novel, &quot;The Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade&quot; with art by John Romita Jr. and Peter Steigerwald. From April to August 2018, Dark Horse Comics published monthly Miller&#x27;s five-issue miniseries sequel to &quot;300&quot;, &quot;&quot;, which marked his first work as both writer and artist comics creation since &quot;Holy Terror&quot;.

In 2017 Miller announced he was writing a &quot;Superman: Year One&quot; project with artwork by John Romita Jr. The three-issue series was released by DC Black Label from June to October 2019 and received mixed reviews. Simon &amp; Schuster Children&#x27;s Publishing published his and author Tom Wheeler&#x27;s young-adult novel &quot;Cursed&quot;, about the King Arthur legend from the point of view of the Lady of the Lake in October 2019. In December 2019, DC released &quot;Dark Knight Returns: The Golden Child&quot;, the fifth series in &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; universe to mixed reviews. It is written by Miller with artwork by Rafael Grampa.

===The 2020s===
In July 2020, Netflix released a 10-episode series based on &quot;Cursed&quot; with Miller and Wheeler serving as both creators and executive producers.

====Frank Miller Presents====
On April 28, 2022, it was reported that Miller was launching an American comic book publishing company titled Frank Miller Presents (FMP). Miller will act as the company&#x27;s president and editor-in-chief, working alongside Dan DiDio as publisher and chief operating officer Silenn Thomas. FMP expects to produce between two and four titles per year, with Miller&#x27;s initial contributions to include &quot;Sin City 1858&quot; and &quot;Ronin Book Two&quot;. As of November 2023, FMP was focusing its efforts on the &quot;Ronin&quot; sequel and &quot;Pandora&quot;, a fantasy adventure series produced together with The Kubert School that Miller described as &quot;look[ing] like a children&#x27;s book, but it&#x27;s also a dark fairytale&quot;.

==== &quot;Frank Miller: American Genius&quot; ====
The documentary film &quot;Frank Miller: American Genius&quot; premiered on June 6, 2024, at the Angelika Film Center in New York City. The event featured a live introduction with Miller, moderated by author Neil Gaiman. On June 10, the film screened in Cinemark theaters across the U.S for one day only.

==Legal issues==
In October 2012, Joanna Gallardo-Mills, who began working for Miller as an executive coordinator in November 2008, filed suit against Miller in Manhattan for discrimination and &quot;mental anguish&quot;, stating that Miller&#x27;s former girlfriend, Kimberly Cox, created a hostile work environment for Gallardo-Mills in Miller and Cox&#x27;s Hell&#x27;s Kitchen living and work space.

In July 2020, producer Stephen L&#x27;Heureux, who worked on &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot;, filed a $25 million defamation and economic interference lawsuit against Miller and fellow producer Silenn Thomas. L&#x27;Heureux alleged the pair had repeatedly made, &quot;false, misleading and defamatory statements&quot; about L&#x27;Heureux&#x27;s ownership of the developmental rights of &quot;Sin City&quot; and &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; to Skydance Media CEO David Ellison and other Skydance executives and prevented the creation of a film adaptation of &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; and a TV series based on &quot;Sin City&quot;. Miller&#x27;s attorney Allen Grodsky denied the allegation stating, &quot;The claims asserted in Mr. L&#x27;Heureux&#x27;s lawsuit are baseless, and we will be aggressively defending this lawsuit.&quot;

==Personal life==
Miller was married to colorist Lynn Varley from 1986 to 2005. She colored many of his most acclaimed works (from &quot;Ronin&quot; in 1984 through &quot;300&quot; in 1998) and the backgrounds to the 2006 movie &quot;300&quot;. Miller has been romantically linked to Kimberly Halliburton Cox, who had a cameo in &quot;The Spirit&quot; (2008).

In response to claims that his comics are conservative, Miller said, &quot;I&#x27;m not a conservative. I&#x27;m a libertarian.&quot;

Miller is a recovering alcoholic, and states that he used alcohol heavily in his early career to free him from inhibitions and increase his creative output.

Miller has described himself as an atheist.

==Style and influence==

Although still conforming to traditional comic book styles, Miller infused his first issue of &quot;Daredevil&quot; with his own film noir style. Miller sketched the roofs of New York in an attempt to give his &quot;Daredevil&quot; art an authentic feel not commonly seen in superhero comics at the time. One journalist commented:

&quot;Ronin&quot; shows some of the strongest influences of manga and bande dessinée on Miller&#x27;s style, both in the artwork and narrative style. &quot;Sin City&quot; was drawn in black and white to emphasize its film noir origins. Miller has said he opposes naturalism in comic art: &quot;People are attempting to bring a superficial reality to superheroes which is rather stupid. They work best as the flamboyant fantasies they are. I mean, these are characters that are broad and big. I don&#x27;t need to see sweat patches under Superman&#x27;s arms. I want to see him fly.&quot;

Miller considers the Argentinian comic book artist Alberto Breccia as one of his personal mentors, even declaring that (regarding modernity in comics), &quot;It all started with Breccia&quot;. In that same regard, Miller&#x27;s work in &quot;Sin City&quot; has been analyzed by South American writers and artists –as well as European critics like Yexus– as being based or inspired in Breccia&#x27;s groundbreaking style, especially regarding the latter&#x27;s chiaroscuros and strong use of stark black-and-white technique.

===Appraisal===
&quot;Daredevil: Born Again&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; were both critical successes and influential on subsequent generations of creators to the point of being considered classics of the medium. &quot;&quot; was also met with praise for its gritty style, while comics including &quot;Ronin&quot;, &quot;300&quot; and &quot;Sin City&quot; were also successful, cementing Miller&#x27;s place as a legend of comic books. However, later material such as &quot;&quot; received mixed reviews. In particular, &quot;All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder&quot; was widely considered a sign of Miller&#x27;s creative decline.

Fellow comic book writer Alan Moore has described Miller&#x27;s work from &quot;Sin City&quot;-onward as homophobic and misogynistic, despite praising his early &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Daredevil&quot; material. Moore previously penned a flattering introduction to an early collected edition of &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, and the two have remained friends. Moore has praised Miller&#x27;s realistic use of minimal dialogue in fight scenes, which &quot;move very fast, flowing from image to image with the speed of a real-life conflict, unimpeded by the reader having to stop to read a lot of accompanying text&quot;.

Miller&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Holy Terror&quot; was accused of being anti-Islamic. Miller later said that he regretted &quot;Holy Terror&quot;, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to wipe out chapters of my own biography. But I&#x27;m not capable of that book again.&quot;

Miller&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Sin City&quot; was well received by audiences and critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 77% based on 254 reviews, with an average rating of 7.50/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Visually groundbreaking and terrifically violent, &quot;Sin City&quot; brings the dark world of Frank Miller&#x27;s graphic novel to vivid life.&quot; His 2008 adaptation of &quot;The Spirit&quot; received generally negative reviews.

<text>Top 10 is a superhero comic book limited series published by the America&#x27;s Best Comics imprint of Wildstorm, itself an imprint of DC Comics. Written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Gene Ha and Zander Cannon, the series details the lives and work of the police force of Neopolis, a city in which almost everyone, from the police and criminals to civilians, children and even pets, has super powers and/or colourful costumes. It won the Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series in 2001.

The series led to the production of several spin-offs; &quot;Smax&quot;, which was set directly after the series&#x27; conclusion; &quot;Top 10: The Forty-Niners&quot;, which is set in 1949; &quot;Top Ten: Beyond the Farthest Precinct&quot;, which is set five years after the series&#x27; conclusion; and &quot;Top Ten Season Two&quot;, penned by Zander Cannon.

==Overview==
The story revolves around the day-to-day lives of the police officers at the 10th Precinct Police Station and is similar in tone to classic television police dramas like &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, which Moore has described as an influence. The book also addresses a wide range of prejudices and issues, but with a science-fiction twist; monsters, robots and fantasy creatures often face the bigotry and problems faced by real-world human minorities.

The series includes several comic-book references and visual &quot;sight gags&quot; relating to the genre. For example, a caped street-corner watch-vendor uses a cardboard sign advertising &quot;signal watches&quot;, and a hot-dog vendor cooks his wares with heat vision. One plotline involves a boy-band called &quot;Sidekix&quot; whose hit single is &quot;Holy Broken Hearts&quot; (a reference to the catchphrase format of DC Comics&#x27; Robin). Likewise, most advertising, signage and graffiti in the Top 10 universe contains references to the world of comic books and superpowers (for example, a clothing store called The Phonebooth, a reference to how Superman in early comics changed his clothes in a phonebooth) and crowd scenes usually feature many characters from sci-fi and comic books.

The primary &quot;Top 10&quot; series was a 12-issue series between 2000 and 2001. Follow-ups included 2003&#x27;s 5-issue mini-spinoff &quot;Smax&quot; and 2005&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Top 10: The Forty-Niners&quot;. 2005 also saw the publication of &quot;Top 10: Beyond the Farthest Precinct&quot;, a 5-issue mini-series, written by Paul Di Filippo and illustrated by Jerry Ordway. Another 4-issue series, &quot;Top 10: Season Two&quot;, was published in 2008–09. It was written by Zander Cannon, Kevin Cannon, and Shadi Petosky, with art by Gene Ha. A single issue &quot;Special&quot;, set two weeks later, was also produced.

===Season One===
====Book 1 (issues #1–7)====

Fresh from the academy, Robyn &quot;Toybox&quot; Slinger is headed for her first day on the job at Precinct 10, home of Neopolis&#x27; finest. Despite a cold reception from her new partner Jeff Smax, Robyn quickly helps with investigating the scene of a homicide in the robot ghetto, Tin Town. The dead man, Stefan &quot;Saddles&quot; Graczik, leads the police to a known drug factory, headed by none other than Professor Gromolko, an original architect of the city. When a telepath is brought in to interrogate the evil scientist, the drug peddler shoots himself with Dust Devil&#x27;s pistol.

The next day, Shock-headed Pete and Dust Devil discover the body of a local prostitute with her head severed, indicating the horrific &quot;Libra&quot; killer is back. Elsewhere, Detective Synaesthesia gets the idea to use zen taxi driver Blindshot to track down Marta &quot;Boots&quot; Wesson, girlfriend and associate of Saddles. Boots reveals that Gromolko had a special delivery for a unique client. At the museum hideout where Boots and Saddles had been staying, a metal canister is found containing some unknown, radioactive drug.

Back at the station, Hyperdog and Peregrine interview Annette &quot;Neural &#x27;Nette&quot; Duvalle, a prostitute who was able to survive an encounter with Libra. She leads Hyperdog and Peregrine, along with Dust Devil, Shock-headed Pete and Jack Phantom, to the sewers near where she encountered her attacker. The police are able to arrest Libra, who is revealed to be former &quot;science hero&quot; M&#x27;rrgla Qualtz, an alien shapeshifter who assumed her natural form to feed during her metamorphic period.

====Book 2 (issues #8–12)====

After Qualtz&#x27;s arrest, several of her former Seven Sentinels teammates come to give her their support, as well as political and legal aid. Even as she professes her innocence, Qualtz continues to use her telepathic powers to try and trick officers into freeing her from captivity. Meanwhile, King Peacock travels to Grand Central, a parallel dimension where the Roman Empire never fell and is filled with countless Roman myth-based creatures. It was here that Saddles was to deliver the drug, but before Peacock can investigate anything, he is drafted into an inter-precinct gladiatorial contest due to a seeming bureaucratic oversight. Though he is victorious, King Peacock despairs that he had to assault and even kill fellow law officers.

Smax and Toybox are called to the scene of an apparent suicide, only to discover the victim, a sidekick boy band star, was murdered. Back at headquarters, the precinct welcomes Commissioner Ultima, visiting from Grand Central for an inspection. Detective James special senses reveal that Ultima was involved in the drug dealings, likely having King Peacock placed in the competition to keep him from investigating. Ultima goes berserk in resisting arrest, killing Girl One, M&#x27;rrgla Qualtz and injuring Toybox before she can be brought down by forcibly giving her the drug and causing her to overdose.

In the aftermath of the commissioner&#x27;s attack, Joe Pi from Precinct 9 is transferred to replace Girl One. Despite the antagonism against Pi, both for the place he occupies and his &quot;Ferro-American&quot; heritage, he quickly establishes himself as a capable policeman. After some digging, Peregrine and Jack Phantom discover that Glenn &quot;Bluejay&quot; Garland, the murdered pop star, was connected to the Seven Sentinels. He was about to sell his life story just before being killed, and investigation into his and M&#x27;rrgla&#x27;s past with the Seven Sentinels reveals the dark secret behind the group: the Seven Sentinels are not a superhero group, but a pedophile ring, having faked all of their famous battles and used the Young Sentinels (sidekicks) as sexual slaves. M&#x27;rrgla&#x27;s old newsreels even contain clips of Sentinels being &quot;serviced&quot;.

The precinct moves to swiftly arrest all the Sentinels, but their leader, Atoman, is tipped off. Locking himself in his Impregnium shielded lair, Atoman seems to be out of the reach of the law, and Irma Geddon laments that even if he were to be convicted, Atoman&#x27;s long lifespan would allow him to walk free, even with consecutive murder charges. Joe Pi then talks to Atoman through an intercom and subtly convinces him to kill himself, rather than face trial, be stripped of his powers, and go to prison with revenge-seeking supervillains. As the events of the past few weeks wind down, Smax visits Toybox in the hospital, asking her to accompany him to his home dimension in order to attend a funeral; Hyperdog starts a relationship with Neural &#x27;Nette; and Captain Traynor returns home to his loving partner, former Skyshark pilot, Wulf.

===&quot;Beyond the Farthest Precinct&quot;===
Five years after the events of the &quot;Smax&quot; mini-series, Precinct 10 is celebrating another year of hard work at their annual labor day picnic. The festivities are broken up by the appearance of a large avatar in the sky, nicknamed the Hell Ditch Pilgrim (after the supernatural crevice it appeared above). The next day, as new officers are paired with veterans, Toybox goes looking for the Rumor, anxious to thank him for rescuing her from Ultima years ago. She however cannot find him, but new officer Hoodoo Priest informs he knows of the Rumor and alludes to his divine role.

Officer Joe Pi is reconfigured as a lesser form to investigate a new strain of robot drug that seems connected to the Hell Ditch Pilgrim. After giving Joe Pi his new assignment, Captain Traynor is called to the mayor&#x27;s office, where he is summarily fired and replaced with the more hawkish Sean Cindercott. Cindercott soon initiates a number of sweeping reforms, instituting radio check-ins every quarter-hour, less focus on street-level crime in favor of &quot;rooting out subversive elements&quot;, no non-essential visitors at the station (meaning loved ones), mandatory overtime with base pay, no contact with the media, and ceasing of routine maintenance of officer&#x27;s personal equipment. Finally, all officers are asked to sign a ten-page &quot;loyalty oath&quot;. The officers are polarized by these decisions, with a large number signing a letter of resignation, until Hyperdog convinces them all to stay.

Joe Pi reports back, after accidentally having experienced the effects of the dark energy capsules firsthand. The &quot;darkshots&quot; create a direct mental connection between any cybernetic intelligence and an extra-dimensional entity. The drugs are being created in a federal lab called Project JOOTS, where Irmageddon&#x27;s husband works. Irma&#x27;s husband, Ron, explains the basic goal: the scientists are investigating &quot;superspace&quot;, the underlying region that seems to bind all timelines in the multiverse. In superspace, dark energy is the force that holds the multiverse together, as well as having other properties. A robot worker, named Rikby-2001, has been using dark energy to create and distribute the drug, but he purposefully overdoses and transcends this plane rather than talk.

After the precinct thwarts a minor attack by a group of anarchic &quot;derridadaists&quot;, they have to deal with the Hell Ditch Pilgrim spreading his influence and destructive insanity through all the entities in Neopolis, including fellow officers. While Cindercott wishes to make a beeline for city hall to protect the mayor, the officers know they have to attack the problem at its source: superspace. But without any means to breach superspace, they cannot fight the Hell Ditch Pilgrim, until the Rumor shows up. He informs Top 10 that Andy &quot;Airbag&quot; Soames, who five years ago contracted S.T.O.R.M.S. (Sexually Transmitted Organic Rapid Mutation Syndrome), was so radically altered by the disease as to become a creature capable of entering and controlling superspace. The Rumor says that Toybox is the only one that can harm Soames, because she carries her mother&#x27;s gift: Pandora&#x27;s Box. The Rumor helps the officers bridge the gap left by Project JOOTS technology and send Toybox into superspace. When Toybox faces Andy alone, she unleashes all of her toys to protect herself, and then reveals the final thing left in Pandora&#x27;s Box that can heal Andy Soames desperate mind: Hope. Smax rushes through the makeshift portal to grab his partner, escaping just before the effects backlash throughout superspace.

A few months after the events of the Hell Ditch Pilgrim case, Hyperdog is Traynor&#x27;s replacement as Captain of Precinct 10, Robyn Slinger is no longer Toybox, and the fascist Mayor Famaille and Major Cindercott are out of power, casualties of the reality warping by Andy Soames, who now peacefully overlooks Top 10 as they once again celebrate survival and hopeful perseverance in a crazy and confusing beautiful world.

===Season Two===
A new officer, Slipstream Phoenix, joins as well as Girl Two, who replaces Girl One. The new commissioner, David Moon Gilbert, enforces stricter regulations to the dismay of some officers. Irma Wornow is suspended for breaking the new regulations. Shock-headed Pete is dismissed after he destroys Joe Pi&#x27;s body while attacking Slipstream Phoenix.

This season was originally intended to include eight issues and two specials. It was canceled in 2009 after four issues and one special, leaving the continuing plotlines unresolved.

<doc id="73257" wikidata="Q103411" url="?curid=73257" title="V for Vendetta">
<text>V for Vendetta is a British graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd (with additional art by Tony Weare). Initially published between 1982 and 1985 in black and white as an ongoing serial in the British anthology &quot;Warrior&quot;, its serialisation was completed in 1988–89 in a ten-issue colour limited series published by DC Comics in the United States. Subsequent collected editions were typically published under DC&#x27;s specialised imprint, Vertigo, until that label was shut down in 2018. Since then it has been transferred to DC Black Label. The story depicts a dystopian and post-apocalyptic near-future history version of the United Kingdom in the 1990s, preceded by a nuclear war in the 1980s that devastated most of the rest of the world. The Nordic supremacist, neo-fascist, outwardly Christofascistic, and homophobic fictional &quot;Norsefire&quot; political party has exterminated its opponents in concentration camps, and now rules the country as a police state.

The comics follow the story&#x27;s title character and protagonist, V, an anarchist revolutionary dressed in a Guy Fawkes mask, as he begins an elaborate and theatrical revolutionist campaign to kill his former captors, bring down the fascist state, and convince the people to abandon fascism in favour of anarchy, while inspiring a young woman, Evey Hammond, to be his protégée.

DC Comics had sold more than 500,000 copies of the graphic novel in the United States by 2006. Warner Bros. released a film adaptation of the same name, written and co-produced by the Wachowskis, in 2005. Following the first and second season premieres of &quot;Gotham&quot; prequel television series &quot;Pennyworth&quot; in 2019 and 2020, showrunners Danny Cannon and Bruno Heller confirmed the series would also serve as a prequel to &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, with the series&#x27; British Civil War eventually giving way to the Norsefire government and rise of V, and the third season featuring predecessors to V wearing Guy Fawkes masks.

==Publication history==

The first episodes of &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; appeared in black-and-white between 1982 and 1985, in &quot;Warrior&quot;, a British anthology comic published by Quality Communications. Editor/publisher Dez Skinn fearing about the appeal of the strip remarked, &quot;If I&#x27;d have given each character their own title, the failures would have certainly outweighed the successes, with the uncompromising &#x27;V for Vendetta&#x27; probably being an early casualty. But with five or six strips an issue, regular [readers] only needed two or three favorites to justify their buying the title.&quot;

When the publishers cancelled &quot;Warrior&quot; in 1985 (with two completed issues unpublished due to the cancellation), several companies attempted to convince Moore and Lloyd to let them publish and complete the story. In 1988, DC Comics published a ten-issue series that reprinted the &quot;Warrior&quot; stories in colour, then continued the series to completion. The first new material appeared in issue No. 7, which included the unpublished episodes that would have appeared in &quot;Warrior&quot; No. 27 and No. 28. Tony Weare drew one chapter (&quot;Vincent&quot;) and contributed additional art to two others (&quot;Valerie&quot; and &quot;The Vacation&quot;); Steve Whitaker and Siobhan Dodds worked as colourists on the entire series.

===Collected editions===
The entire series has appeared collected in paperback () and hardback () form, including Moore&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Painted Smile&quot; essay and two &quot;interludes&quot; outside the central continuity. Later collections include reissued paperbacks, published in the US by DC&#x27;s Vertigo imprint () and in the UK by Titan Books (). A new hardback edition was published in 2005 featuring improved printing and colouring. In August 2009 DC published a slipcased Absolute Edition (); this includes newly coloured &quot;silent art&quot; pages (full-page panels containing no dialogue) from the series&#x27; original run, which have not previously appeared in any previous collected edition.

===Background===
David Lloyd&#x27;s paintings for &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; in &quot;Warrior&quot; first appeared in black and white.

In writing &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, Moore drew upon a comic strip idea submission that the DC Thomson scriptwriting competition rejected in 1975: &quot;The Doll&quot;, which involved a transgender terrorist in white face makeup, who fought a totalitarian state during the 1980s.

Years later, Skinn reportedly invited Moore to create a dark mystery strip with artist David Lloyd. &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; was intended to recreate something similar to their popular Marvel UK Night Raven strip in a 1930s noir. They chose against doing historical research and instead set the story in the near future rather than the recent past.

Then &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; emerged, putting the emphasis on &quot;V&quot; rather than &quot;Vendetta&quot;. David Lloyd developed the idea of dressing V as Guy Fawkes after previous designs followed the conventional superhero look. During the preparation of the story, Moore made a list of what he wanted to bring into the plot, which he reproduced in &quot;Behind the Painted Smile&quot;:

Orwell. Huxley. Thomas Disch. &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;. Harlan Ellison&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Repent, Harlequin!&quot; Said the Ticktockman&quot;, &quot;Catman&quot; and &quot;The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World&quot; by the same author. Vincent Price&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Phibes&quot; and &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot;. David Bowie. &quot;The Shadow&quot;. &quot;Night Raven&quot;. &quot;Batman&quot;. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;. The writings of the New Worlds school of science fiction. Max Ernst&#x27;s painting &quot;Europe After the Rain&quot;. Thomas Pynchon. The atmosphere of British Second World War films. &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. Robin Hood. Dick Turpin...

The influence of such a wide number of references has been thoroughly demonstrated in academic studies, above which dystopian elements stand out, especially the similarity with George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; in several stages of the plot.

The political climate of Britain in the early 1980s also influenced the work, with Moore positing that Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative government would &quot;obviously lose the 1983 elections&quot;, and that an incoming Michael Foot-led Labour government, committed to complete nuclear disarmament, would allow the United Kingdom to escape relatively unscathed after a limited nuclear war. However, Moore felt that fascists would quickly subvert a post-nuclear holocaust Britain. V, an anarchist, initially tortures and murders members of the fascist government, but as the story develops, Moore deliberately made V&#x27;s actions &quot;very, very morally ambiguous&quot; with the aim that &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to tell people what to think, I just wanted to tell people to think.&quot; The Guy Fawkes analogy was deliberate, with Moore pointing out in a 2012 interview that Britain has a history of &quot;making heroes out of criminals or people who in other centuries might have been regarded as terrorists&quot;, desiring a similar ambiguity for a protagonist reviled as a villain by the Britain of his fictional 1990s. 

Moore&#x27;s scenario remains untested. Addressing historical developments when DC reissued the work, he noted:

Naïveté can also be detected in my supposition that it would take something as melodramatic as a near-miss nuclear conflict to nudge Britain towards fascism... The simple fact that much of the historical background of the story proceeds from a predicted Conservative defeat in the 1983 General Election should tell you how reliable we were in our roles as Cassandras.

==Plot==
===Book 1: Europe After the Reign===
On Guy Fawkes Night in London in 1997, a financially desperate 16-year-old, Evey Hammond, sexually solicits men who are actually members of the state secret police, called &quot;The Finger&quot;. Preparing to rape and kill her, the Fingermen are dispatched by V, a cloaked anarchist wearing a mask, who later remotely detonates explosives at the Palace of Westminster before bringing Evey to his contraband-filled underground lair, the &quot;Shadow Gallery.&quot; Evey tells V her life story, which reveals her own past and England&#x27;s recent history. During a dispute over Poland in the late 1980s, the Soviet Union and the United States, under the presidency of Ted Kennedy, entered a global nuclear war which left continental Europe and Africa uninhabitable. Although Britain itself was not bombed due to the Labour government&#x27;s decision to remove American nuclear missiles, it faced environmental devastation and famine due to the nuclear winter. After a period of lawlessness in which Evey&#x27;s mother died, the remaining corporations and fascist groups took over England and formed a new totalitarian government, Norsefire. Evey&#x27;s father, a former socialist, was arrested by the regime.

Meanwhile, Eric Finch, a veteran detective in charge of the regular police force (&quot;The Nose&quot;), begins investigating V&#x27;s terrorist activities. Finch often communicates with the other top government officials, collectively known as &quot;The Head.&quot; These individuals include Derek Almond, who supervises the Finger, and Adam Susan, the reclusive Leader of Norsefire, who obsessively oversees the government&#x27;s &quot;Fate&quot; computer system. Finch&#x27;s case thickens when V kidnaps Lewis Prothero, a propaganda-broadcasting radio personality, and drives him into a mental breakdown by forcing him to relive his actions as the commander of a &quot;resettlement&quot; camp near Larkhill with his treasured doll collection as inmates. Evey agrees to help V with his next assassination by disguising herself as a child prostitute to infiltrate the home of Bishop Anthony Lilliman, a paedophile priest, whom V forces to commit suicide by eating a poisoned communion wafer. He prepares to murder Dr. Delia Surridge, a medical researcher who once had a romance with Finch. Finch suddenly discovers the connection among V&#x27;s three targets: they all used to work at Larkhill. That night, V kills both Almond and Surridge. Surridge leaves a diary revealing that V—a former inmate and victim of Surridge&#x27;s cruel medical experiments—destroyed and fled the camp and is now eliminating the camp&#x27;s former officers for what they did. Finch reports these findings to Susan, and suspects that this vendetta may actually be a cover for V, who, he worries, may be plotting an even bigger terrorist attack.

===Book 2: This Vicious Cabaret===
Four months later, V breaks into Jordan Tower, the home of Norsefire&#x27;s propaganda department, &quot;the Mouth&quot;—led by Roger Dascombe—to broadcast a speech that calls on the people to resist the government. V escapes using an elaborate diversion that results in Dascombe&#x27;s death. Finch is soon introduced to Peter Creedy, the Finger&#x27;s new head, who provokes Finch to strike him and thus get sent on a forced vacation. Evey takes shelter at the house of a man named Gordon, who found her on the street. While originally platonic, they eventually build a romantic relationship. Evey and Gordon unknowingly cross paths with Rose Almond, the widow of the recently killed Derek. After Derek&#x27;s death, Rose had reluctantly begun a relationship with Dascombe. With both of her lovers murdered, she is forced to perform demoralising burlesque work, increasing her hatred of the unsupportive government.

When a Scottish gangster named Ally Harper murders Gordon, a vengeful Evey interrupts a meeting between Harper and Creedy, the latter of whom is buying the support of Harper&#x27;s thugs in preparation for a coup d&#x27;état. Evey attempts to shoot Harper but is suddenly abducted and then imprisoned. Amidst interrogation and torture, Evey finds an old letter hidden in her cell by an inmate named Valerie Page, a film actress who was imprisoned and executed for being a lesbian and documented her experiences in the letter.

Evey&#x27;s interrogator finally gives her a choice of collaboration or death; inspired by Valerie&#x27;s letter, Evey refuses to collaborate and, expecting to be executed, is instead told that she is free. Stunned, Evey learns that her supposed imprisonment is a hoax constructed by V so that she could experience an ordeal similar to the one that shaped him at Larkhill. He reveals that Valerie was a real Larkhill prisoner who died in the cell next to his and that the letter is not a fake. Evey forgives V, who has hacked into the government&#x27;s &quot;Fate&quot; computer system and started emotionally manipulating Adam Susan with mind games. Consequently, Susan, who has formed a bizarre romantic attachment to the computer, begins to descend into madness.

===Book 3: The Land of Do-As-You-Please===
The following 5 November (1998), V blows up the Post Office Tower and Jordan Tower, killing &quot;the Ear&quot; leader Brian Etheridge, in addition to effectively shutting down three government agencies: the Eye, the Ear, and the Mouth. Creedy&#x27;s men and Harper&#x27;s associated street gangs violently suppress the subsequent wave of revolutionary fervor from the public. V notes to Evey that he has not yet achieved what he calls the &quot;Land of Do-as-You-Please,&quot; meaning a functional anarchistic society, and considers the current chaotic situation an interim period of &quot;Land of Take-What-You-Want.&quot; Finch has been mysteriously absent, and his young assistant, Dominic Stone, one day realises that V has been influencing the &quot;Fate&quot; computer all along, which explained V&#x27;s consistent foresight. All the while, Finch has been travelling to the abandoned site of Larkhill, where he takes LSD to conjure up memories of his own devastating past and to put his mind in the role of a prisoner of Larkhill, like V, to help give him an intuitive understanding of V&#x27;s experiences. Returning to London, Finch suddenly deduces that V&#x27;s lair is inside the abandoned Victoria Station, which he enters.

V takes Finch by surprise, resulting in a scuffle that sees Finch shoot V, and V wounds Finch with a knife. V claims that he cannot be killed since he is only an idea and that &quot;ideas are bulletproof&quot;; regardless, V is indeed mortally wounded and returns to the Shadow Gallery deeper within, dying in Evey&#x27;s arms. Evey considers unmasking V but decides not to, realising that V is not an identity but a symbol. She then assumes V&#x27;s identity, donning one of his spare costumes. Finch sees the large amount of blood that V has left in his wake and deduces that he has mortally wounded V. Occurring concurrently to this, Creedy has been pressuring Susan to appear in public, hoping to leave him exposed. Sure enough, as Susan stops to shake hands with Rose during a parade, she shoots him in the head in vengeance for the death of her husband and the life she has had to lead since then. Following Rose&#x27;s arrest, Creedy assumes emergency leadership of the country, and Finch emerges from the subway proclaiming V&#x27;s death.

Due to his LSD-induced epiphany, Finch leaves his position within &quot;the Nose.&quot; The power struggle between the remaining leaders results in all of their deaths: Harper betrays and kills Creedy at the behest of Helen Heyer (wife of &quot;the Eye&quot; leader Conrad Heyer, who had outbid Creedy for Harper&#x27;s loyalty), and Harper and Conrad Heyer kill each other during a fight precipitated by Heyer&#x27;s discovery that his wife Helen had had an affair with Harper.

With the fate of the top government officials unknown to the public, Stone acts as leader of the police forces deployed to ensure that the riots are contained should V remain alive and make his promised public announcement. Evey appears to a crowd, dressed as V, announcing the destruction of 10 Downing Street the following day and telling the crowd they must &quot;...choose what comes next. Lives of your own, or a return to chains&quot;, whereupon a general insurrection begins. Evey destroys 10 Downing Street by blowing up an Underground train containing V&#x27;s body, in the style of an explosive Viking funeral. She abducts Stone, apparently to train him as her successor to make sure people like Susan will never hold power ever again. The comic ends with Finch quietly observing the chaos raging in the city and walking down an abandoned motorway whose lights have all gone out.

===Norsefire government===

The highest-level officials in the Norsefire government form a council known as &quot;The Head.&quot; The five individual departments are named after sensory organs or appendages that reference their functions.

;Notes
==Themes and motifs==
The two conflicting political viewpoints of anarchism and fascism dominate the story.

Moore stated in an interview that V is designed as an enigma, as Moore &quot;didn&#x27;t want to tell people what to think&quot; but wanted them to consider some extreme events that have recurred throughout history.

==Adaptations==
===Film===

In December 2005 Warner Bros. released a feature-film adaptation of &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, directed by James McTeigue from a screenplay by the Wachowskis, with Natalie Portman starring as Evey Hammond and Hugo Weaving appearing as V.

Alan Moore distanced himself from the film, as he has with other screen adaptations of his works. He ended co-operation with his publisher, DC Comics, after its corporate parent, Warner Bros., failed to retract statements about Moore&#x27;s supposed endorsement of the movie.

After reading the script, Moore remarked:

He later added that if the Wachowskis had wanted to protest about what was going on in the United States, then they should have used a political narrative that directly addressed such issues, similar to what Moore had done before with Britain. The film arguably changes the original message by having removed any reference to actual anarchism in the revolutionary actions of V. An interview with producer Joel Silver reveals that he identifies the V of the comics as a clear-cut &quot;superhero... a masked avenger who pretty much saves the world&quot;, a simplification that goes against Moore&#x27;s own statements about V&#x27;s role in the story.

Co-author and illustrator David Lloyd, by contrast, embraced the adaptation. In an interview with &quot;Newsarama&quot; he states:

Steve Moore (no relation to Alan Moore) wrote a novelisation of the film&#x27;s screenplay, published in 2006.

===Television===

On 4 October 2017, it was announced that Channel 4 was developing a television series based on the &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; comic book, which ultimately entered development hell. On 29 July 2019, the day following the series premiere of &quot;Pennyworth&quot;, previously presented ostensibly as solely a direct prequel to Fox series &quot;Gotham&quot; (2014–2019), series co-showrunner Danny Cannon confirmed that &quot;Pennyworth&quot; would also serve as a loose prequel to &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, with the British Civil War depicted in the series&#x27; first season eventually leading to the formation of the Norsefire government of &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, a sentiment echoed by co-showrunner Bruno Heller on 11 December 2020, on the day of the second season premiere, and again on 5 February 2021, in the lead-up to the mid-season premiere. Characters wearing V&#x27;s Guy Fawkes mask were later introduced in the series&#x27; 2022 third season, set five years after the first two seasons.

==Legacy==
The February 1999 issue of &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; ran a poll on &quot;The Top 100 (English-Language) Comics of the Century&quot;: &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; reached 83rd place.

On 5 November 2019, the BBC News listed &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

==Cultural impact==
Since the film adaptation, hundreds of thousands of Guy Fawkes masks from the books and film have been sold every year since the film&#x27;s release in 2005. Time Warner owns the rights to the image and is paid a fee with the sale of each official mask.

Anonymous, an online group associated with computer hacking, popularised the mask as a symbol for rebellion by wearing it at protests against governments. It prominently featured in the 2008 Project Chanology protests against the Church of Scientology. Moore described being pleased by the Fawkes mask&#x27;s appearance at the protests.

According to &quot;Time&quot; in 2011, the protesters&#x27; adoption of the mask led to it becoming the top-selling mask on Amazon, selling hundreds of thousands a year.

The film allegedly inspired some of the Egyptian youth before and during the 2011 Egyptian revolution.

On 23 May 2009, protesters dressed up as V and set off a fake barrel of gunpowder outside Parliament while protesting over the issue of British MPs&#x27; expenses.

During the Occupy Wall Street and other Occupy protests, the mask appeared internationally as a symbol of popular revolution. Artist David Lloyd stated: &quot;The Guy Fawkes mask has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny—and I&#x27;m happy with people using it, it seems quite unique, an icon of popular culture being used this way.&quot;

On 17 November 2012, police officials in Dubai warned against wearing Guy Fawkes masks painted with the colours of the UAE flag during any celebration associated with the UAE National Day (2 December), declaring such use an illegal act after masks went on sale in online shops for 50 DHS.

Guy Fawkes masks also made an appearance in the 2014 Hong Kong protests and also in 2019.

<doc id="73259" wikidata="Q215248" url="?curid=73259" title="Order of the Garter">
<text>The Most Noble Order of the Garter is an order of chivalry founded by Edward III of England in 1348. The most senior order of knighthood in the British honours system, it is outranked in precedence only by the decorations of the Victoria Cross and the George Cross. The Order of the Garter is dedicated to the image and arms of Saint George, England&#x27;s patron saint.

Appointments are at the Sovereign&#x27;s sole discretion, typically made in recognition of national contribution, service to the Crown, or for distinguished personal service to the Monarch. Membership of the order is limited to the sovereign, the Prince of Wales, and no more than 24 living members, or Companions. The order also includes Knights and Ladies (e.g., members of the British royal family and foreign monarchs).

The order&#x27;s emblem is a garter circlet with the motto (Anglo-Norman for &#x27;Shame on him who thinks evil of it&#x27;) in gold script. Members of the order wear it on ceremonial occasions.

==History==
King Edward III founded the Order of the Garter around the time of his claim to the French throne. The traditional year of foundation is usually given as 1348 (when it was formally proclaimed). However, &quot;The Complete Peerage&quot;, under &quot;The Founders of the Order of the Garter&quot;, states the order was first instituted on 23 April 1344, listing each founding member as knighted in 1344. The list includes Sir Sanchet D&#x27;Abrichecourt, of whom the latest notice (according to the book) is 20 October 1345. Other dates from 1344 to 1351 have also been proposed. The King&#x27;s wardrobe account shows Garter habits first issued in the autumn of 1348. Also, its original statutes required that each member of the Order already be a knight (what would now be referred to as a knight bachelor) and some of the initial members listed were only knighted that year. Its foundation is likely to have been inspired by the Castilian Order of the Band, established in about 1330.

===List of Founder Knights===
At the time of its foundation, the Order consisted of King Edward III, together with 25 Founder Knights, listed in ascending order of stall number in St George&#x27;s Chapel:
* King Edward III (1312–77)
* Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales (1330–76)
* Henry of Grosmont, 4th Earl of Lancaster (–61)
* Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick (1313–69)
* Jean de Grailly, III Captal de Buch (d. 1376)
* Ralph de Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford (1301–72)
* William de Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury (1328–97)
* Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March (1328–60)
* John, 2nd Baron Lisle (1318–55)
* Bartholomew, 2nd Baron Burghersh (c. 1329–69)
* John, 1st Baron Beauchamp (d. 1360)
* John, 2nd Baron Mohun (–76)
* Sir Hugh de Courtenay (1327–49)
* Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent (1314–60)
* John, 1st Baron Grey de Rotherfield (1300–59)
* Sir Richard Fitz-Simon (1295–1348/49)
* Sir Miles Stapleton of Bedale (c. 1320–64)
* Sir Thomas Wale (1303–52)
* Sir Hugh Wrottesley (d. 1381)
* Sir Nele Loring (1320–86)
* Sir John Chandos (c. 1320–69)
* Sir James Audley (c. 1318–69)
* Sir Otho Holand (c. 1316–59)
* Sir Henry Eam (d. before 1360)
* Sir Sanchet D&#x27;Abrichecourt (c. 1330–59)
* Sir Walter Paveley (1319–75)

They are all depicted by individual portraits in the Bruges Garter Book compiled , and now in the British Library.

===Legendary origins===
Various legends account for the origin of the Order. The most popular involves the &quot;Countess of Salisbury&quot;, whose garter is said to have slipped from her leg while she was dancing at a court ball at Calais. When the surrounding courtiers snickered, the King picked it up and returned it to her, exclaiming, &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Shame on him who thinks ill of it!&#x27;), which phrase has become the Order&#x27;s motto. However, the earliest written version of this story dates from the 1460s, and it seems to have been conceived as a retrospective explanation for the adoption of what was then seen as an item of female underclothing as the symbol of a band of knights. In fact, at the time of the Order&#x27;s establishment in the mid-14th century, garters were predominantly an item of male attire.

According to another legend, King Richard I was inspired in the 12th century by St George the Martyr while fighting in the Crusades to tie garters around the legs of his knights, who subsequently won the battle. King Edward supposedly recalled the event in the 14th century when he founded the Order. This story is recounted in a letter to the Annual Register in 1774:

The motto in fact refers to Edward&#x27;s claim to the French throne, and the Order of the Garter was created to help pursue this claim. The use of the garter as an emblem may have derived from straps used to fasten armour, and may have been chosen because it held overtones of a tight-knit &quot;band&quot; or &quot;bond&quot; of knightly &quot;supporters&quot; of Edward&#x27;s cause.

There is a connection between the Order of the Garter and the Middle English poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; (late 14th century).
The motto is inscribed, as &quot;hony soyt qui mal pence&quot;, at the end of the text in the sole surviving manuscript in the British Library, albeit in a later hand. In the poem, a girdle, very similar in its erotic undertones to the garter, plays a prominent role. A rough equivalent of the Order&#x27;s motto has been identified in Gawain&#x27;s exclamation &quot;corsed worth cowarddyse and couetyse boþe&quot; (&#x27;cursed be both cowardice and coveting&#x27;, v. 2374). While the author of that poem remains disputed, there seems to be a connection between two of the top candidates and the Order of the Garter, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, and Enguerrand de Coucy, seventh Sire de Coucy. De Coucy was married to King Edward III&#x27;s daughter, Isabella, and was given admittance to the Order of the Garter on their wedding day.&quot;

===Ladies of the Garter===
Soon after the founding of the order, women were appointed &quot;Ladies of the Garter&quot;, but some historians argue that they were not appointed companions, as they were not knights. Queen Philippa was the first lady to be appointed in 1358. King Henry VII discontinued the practice in 1488; his mother, Margaret Beaufort, was the last Lady of the Garter before Queen Alexandra.

Except for female sovereigns, the next Lady of the Garter named was Queen Alexandra, by her husband King Edward VII. King George V also made his consort, Queen Mary, a Lady of the Garter and King George VI subsequently did the same for his wife, Queen Elizabeth, and his daughter Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II). Throughout the 20th century, women continued to be associated with the Order, but save for foreign female monarchs, they were not made Companions.

In 1987, by a statute of Queen Elizabeth II, the installation of &quot;Ladies Companion of the Garter&quot; became possible. Unlike previous queens consort, Queen Camilla was named a Royal Lady of the Garter by her mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, when she was still the Duchess of Cornwall.

In 2022, Valerie Amos, Baroness Amos, became the first Black Lady Companion of the Order since its foundation. Eliza Manningham-Buller, Baroness Manningham-Buller, became the first Lady Companion to be appointed chancellor of the Order, on 18 June 2024.

==Composition==

===Members===
Membership in the Order is strictly limited and includes the Monarch, the Prince of Wales, not more than 24 Companion members, and various members. The monarch alone decides who is appointed. The monarch is known as the &quot;Sovereign of the Garter&quot;, and the Prince of Wales is known as a &quot;Royal Knight Companion of the Garter&quot;.

Male members of the Order are titled &quot;Knights Companion&quot; and female members are called &quot;Ladies Companion&quot;. Formerly, the sovereign filled vacancies upon the nomination of the members. Each member would nominate nine candidates, of whom three had to have the rank of earl or higher, three the rank of baron or higher, and three the rank of knight or higher. The sovereign would choose as many nominees as were necessary to fill any vacancies in the order. They were not obliged to choose those who received the most nominations. Candidates were last nominated in 1860, and appointments have since been made by the sovereign acting alone, with no prior nominations. The statutes prescribing the former procedure were not amended, however, until 1953.

From the 18th century, the sovereign made their choices on the advice of the government. In 1946, with the agreement of Prime Minister Clement Attlee and Opposition Leader Winston Churchill, membership of Great Britain&#x27;s highest ranking orders of chivalry (the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle and the dormant Order of St Patrick) became a personal gift of the Sovereign once again. Thus, the sovereign personally selects Knights and Ladies Companion of the Garter, without political influence. Appointments are typically announced on Saint George&#x27;s Day (23 April).

===Supernumerary members===

The Order includes members, whose number do not count towards the limit of 24 companions. Several supernumerary members, known as &quot;Royal Knights and Ladies of the Garter&quot;, belong to the royal family. These titles were introduced in 1786 by King George III so that his many sons would not curtail the number of non-royal companions. He created the statute of supernumerary members in 1805 so that any descendant of King George II could be installed as such a member. In 1831, this statute was extended again to include all descendants of King George I.

With the installation of Emperor Alexander I of Russia in 1813, supernumerary membership was extended to foreign monarchs, who are known as &quot;Stranger Knights and Ladies of the Garter&quot;. Each such installation originally required the enactment of a statute; however, a 1954 statute authorises the regular admission of Stranger Knights or Ladies without further special enactments.

===Degradation of members===
The sovereign may &quot;degrade&quot; members who have taken up arms against the Crown. From the late 15th century, there was a formal ceremony of degradation, in which Garter King of Arms, accompanied by the rest of the Heralds, processed to St George&#x27;s Chapel. While the Garter King read aloud the Instrument of Degradation, a Herald climbed up a ladder and removed the former Knight&#x27;s banner, crest, helm, and sword, throwing them down into the quire. Then the rest of the Heralds kicked them down the length of the chapel, out of the doors, and into the castle ditch. The last such formal degradation was that of James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde, in 1716.

During the First World War, two Royal Knights and six Stranger Knights, all monarchs or princes of enemy nations and including Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, were struck off the roll of the order, their appointments being annulled in 1915. The banner of King Victor Emmanuel III was removed from the chapel after Italy entered World War II against the United Kingdom and its allies in 1940. The banner of Emperor Hirohito was removed from St George&#x27;s Chapel when Japan entered World War II in 1941, but that banner and his knighthood were restored by Elizabeth II in 1971, when Hirohito made a state visit to the United Kingdom. The Emperor was particularly pleased by the restoration to the Garter.

===Officers===

The Order has six officers: the Prelate, the Chancellor, the Register, the Garter Principal King of Arms, the Usher, and the Secretary. The offices of Prelate, Register, and Usher were created on the order&#x27;s establishment; those of Garter Principal King of Arms and Chancellor, in the 15th century; and that of Secretary, in the 20th century.

William of Edington, Bishop of Winchester, was the first Prelate of the Order, and that office has since been held by his successors at Winchester, traditionally a senior bishopric of the Church of England.

The office of Chancellor is now held by one of the companions of the order. For most of its existence, the Bishop of Salisbury has held the office, although laymen held it from 1553 to 1671. In 1837, after boundary changes made Windsor Castle fall in the diocese of Oxford, the Chancellorship was transferred to the Bishop of Oxford. A century later, the Bishop of Salisbury challenged this transfer, on the grounds that the Chancellorship had been attached to his office regardless of the diocese in which the chapel of the order lay; and that, in any event, St George&#x27;s Chapel, as a Royal Peculiar, was not under diocesan jurisdiction. The office of Chancellor was removed from the Bishop of Oxford (the outgoing bishop, Thomas Strong, had been outspoken in the Edward VIII abdication crisis), and so it was withheld from his successor, Kenneth Kirk, and has since been held by one of the Knights and Ladies Companion.

The office of Register has been held by the Dean of Windsor since 1558. The Garter Principal King of Arms is &quot;ex officio&quot; the senior officer of the College of Arms (the heraldic authority of England), and is usually appointed from among the other officers of arms at the College. As the title suggests, Garter Principal King of Arms has specific duties as the Order&#x27;s officer of arms, attending to the companions&#x27; coats of arms and banners of arms, which are exhibited in the chapel. The Secretary, who acts as deputy to Garter in the ceremonial aspects of the Order, has since 1952 typically also been selected from the other officers of the College of Arms. The office of Usher is held by the Usher of the Black Rod, who is also the Serjeant-at-Arms of the House of Lords.

==Military Knights of Windsor==

At the founding of the Order of the Garter, 26 &quot;poor knights&quot; were appointed and attached to the Order and its chapel. This number was not always maintained, and by the 17th century, there were only thirteen such knights. King Charles II increased the number to 18 (in large part because of funds allocated from Sir Francis Crane&#x27;s will) after his coronation in 1660. After the knights objected to being termed &quot;poor&quot;, King William IV redesignated them in the 19th century as the Military Knights of Windsor.

The poor knights were impoverished military veterans, required to pray daily for the Knights Companion. In return, they received a salary and lodging in Windsor Castle. The knights are no longer necessarily poor, but are still military pensioners. They participate in the Order&#x27;s processions, escorting the members, and in the chapel services. However, they are not considered members of the Order.

The poor knights originally wore red mantles, each of which bore St George&#x27;s Cross, but did not depict the Garter. Queen Elizabeth I replaced the mantles in the 16th and 17th centuries with blue and purple gowns, but the red mantles returned in the 17th century under King Charles I. When the knights were renamed, the mantles were abandoned. The military knights now wear the old military uniform of an &quot;army officer on the unattached list&quot;: black trousers with red stripe, a red double-breasted swallow-tailed coat, gold epaulets and brushes, a cocked hat with a plume, and a sword on a white baldric.

==Robes and insignia==
===Members===

====Order&#x27;s ceremonial occasions====

For the Order&#x27;s ceremonial occasions, such as the annual Garter Day, the members wear elaborate vestments and accoutrements, which include:
*The &quot;mantle&quot; is a vestment or robe worn by members since the 15th century. Once made of wool, by the 16th century it was made of velvet. The mantle was originally purple, but varied during the 17th and 18th centuries between celestial blue, pale blue, royal blue, dark blue, violet, and ultramarine. Mantles are now dark blue and lined with white taffeta. The mantles of the Sovereign, the Prince of Wales, and Royal Knights and Ladies end in trains. The heraldic shield of St George&#x27;s Cross encircled by the Garter is sewn onto the left shoulder of the mantle, but the Sovereign&#x27;s mantle instead has the star of the Order. Attached to the mantle over the right shoulder are a dark red velvet hood and surcoat, which have lost all function over time and appear to the modern observer simply as a splash of colour.
*The &quot;hat&quot; is a Tudor bonnet of black velvet with a plume of white ostrich and black heron feathers.
*The &quot;collar&quot; is worn around the neck, over the mantle and is secured with white ribbons tied in bows on the shoulders. Like the mantle, it was introduced in the 15th and 16th centuries. Made of pure gold, it weighs . The collar is composed of gold heraldic knots alternating with enamelled medallions, each showing a rose encircled by the Garter. During the reign of Henry VII (1485–1509), commencing at the termination of the Wars of the Roses, each garter surrounded two roses – one red for the House of Lancaster and one white for the House of York – but he changed the design to encircle the Tudor rose alone, a combination of both forms. Today one of the most visible representations of the collar forms part of the monarch&#x27;s heraldic achievement on the gates of Buckingham Palace.
*The &quot;Great George&quot;, which is worn suspended from the collar, is a colourfully enamelled (sometimes jewelled) three-dimensional figure of St George the Martyr on horseback slaying a dragon.

*The &quot;Garter&quot; is worn on ceremonial occasions around the left calf by knights and around the left arm by ladies, and is depicted on several insignia. The Garter is a buckled dark-blue (originally light-blue) velvet strap, and bears the motto in gold letters. The garters of Stranger Knights and Ladies were once set with several jewels. Two styles have been used: one is a working garter where the end slips through the buckle, passed behind, and then is tucked down through the formed loop, as it is shown in the arms of the order, and the other style is a &#x27;pre-made&#x27; one that has the buckled and tucked end pre-fashioned and is fastened with a clip attachment.

Up until the middle part of the 20th century, it was customary to wear Tudor style under-dress, consisting of white silk embroidered doublet, breeches, full hose, white doeskin pumps with satin bows and a sword belt with sword, under the robes. Nowadays, morning dress or a lounge suit is worn, except for coronations when Tudor under-dress is worn by the canopy-bearers.

====Other occasions====
On other occasions when decorations are worn, the members wear simpler insignia:
*The &quot;collar&quot; is worn on designated collar days over military uniform or morning dress by members attending formal events. The collar is fastened to the shoulders with silk ribbons (or gold safety pins when worn with morning dress). Since the collar signifies the Order of the Garter, members can then wear the riband of any other order to which they belong.
*The &quot;star&quot;, which is worn pinned to the left breast, was introduced in the 17th century by King Charles I and is a colourfully enamelled depiction of the heraldic shield of St George&#x27;s Cross, encircled by the Garter, which is itself encircled by an eight-point silver badge. Each point is depicted as a cluster of rays, with the four points of the cardinal directions longer than the intermediate ones. The stars of Stranger Knights and Ladies were once set with several jewels. Since the Order of the Garter is the senior order of the United Kingdom, a member will wear its star above the others (up to three) that they hold. There are examples in the Royal Collection of the stars of foreign orders given to George V surrounded with the Garter, e.g. the Prussian Order of the Black Eagle given to George V when Prince of Wales.
*The &quot;riband&quot; is a -wide sash worn over the left shoulder, or pinned beneath it, to the right hip, and was introduced in the 17th century by King Charles I. The riband&#x27;s colour has varied over the years: it was originally light blue, but was a dark shade under the Hanoverian monarchs. In 1950, the colour was fixed as &quot;kingfisher blue&quot;. A member will wear only one riband, even if they belong to several orders.
*The &quot;badge&quot; is worn suspended from a small gold link from the riband at the right hip, and is sometimes known as &quot;the Lesser George&quot;. Like the Great George, the badge shows St George the Martyr on horseback slaying a dragon, but it is flatter and gold. In earlier times, the badge was worn from a ribbon tied around the neck.

On the death of a member, the Lesser George and breast star are returned personally to the sovereign by the former member&#x27;s nearest male relative, and the other insignia to the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, save the riband, mantle and hat.

===Officers===
For ceremonial occasions of the Order, the officers wear the following garments and accessories:
*The mantles for the prelate and chancellor are dark blue like those of the members (as a member, the chancellor wears a member&#x27;s mantle), but the mantles for the other officers are dark red. All mantles are embroidered with a heraldic shield of St George&#x27;s Cross. For Garter ceremonies, Garter Principal King of Arms wears this red mantle rather than the tabard of the royal arms worn for other State ceremonial occasions.
*Officers wear badges of office suspended from a chain worn around the neck. The badge for the prelate shows the Lesser George encircled by the Garter, which is surmounted by a bishop&#x27;s mitre. The badge for the chancellor is a rose encircled by the Garter. The badge for the register is two crossed quills over a book encircled by the Garter surmounted by a crown. The badge for Garter Principal King of Arms is the royal arms impaled with St George&#x27;s Cross encircled by the Garter and surmounted by a crown. The badge for the usher is a knot (like those on the collars of the companions of the order) encircled by the Garter and surmounted by a crown. The badge for the secretary shows two crossed quills in front of a rose and encircled by the Garter surmounted by a crown.

The chancellor carries a purse, which is embroidered with the royal arms impaled by the Cross of St George. The purse contains the seal of the Order. Garter Principal King of Arms carries his baton of office. The usher carries their staff of office, the Black Rod.

==Chapel==
St George&#x27;s Chapel in Windsor is the mother church of the Order of the Garter and the location of special services in relation to the Order.

During their lifetime, all members of the Order of the Garter are entitled to display their heraldic crests and banners in St George&#x27;s Chapel. While the Garter stall plates stay in the chapel permanently, the crests and banners of deceased knights are, following presentation at the High Altar, removed from the chapel. Sometimes they are then given to institutions that were connected with the late knight, or kept privately depending on family wishes. Originally after a knight&#x27;s death, the crests became the property of Garter King of Arms, and these crests have been the subject of occasional exhibitions in the Earl Marshal&#x27;s Court at the College of Arms.

Garter stall plates are small enamelled and engraved brass plates located in St George&#x27;s Chapel as memorials to Knights of the Garter.

==Investiture and installation==
Each June, on Garter Day, the members of the Order, wearing their habits and garter insignia, meet at Windsor Castle. When any new Knights and/or Ladies of the Garter are due for installation, an investiture ceremony is held in the Throne Room of Windsor Castle on the morning of Garter Day. This ceremony is attended by all available Knights and Ladies Companion of the Order, wearing the ceremonial habits and garter insignia, and also by their spouses. The wording of the oath sworn by the new knights at this ceremony and of the Admonitions addressed to them in turn by the prelate and chancellor of the order when the several items of insignia are placed upon them are extremely similar to the traditions of the past.

At the investiture ceremony, two senior knights or ladies of the order assist the Sovereign by placing the garter around the left leg of the new knight, or left arm of the new lady, and in the fastening of the riband and Lesser George about the body of the new knight or lady, and in the adjustment of the mantle and the collar. After the investiture ceremony at Windsor is concluded, a state luncheon is held in the Banqueting Room. This is attended by the royal family, by all the Companions of the Order and their spouses, and by the Officers of the Order. After the banquet all the knights and ladies of the order, together with the prelate, chancellor and other officers of the order, in their mantles and ceremonial robes, led by the Military Knights of Windsor, move in procession, watched by a great crowd of spectators, through the castle, down the hill, which is lined with soldiers, to Saint George&#x27;s Chapel for a worship service, before which the formal installation of the new knights takes place.

While (then just) knights continued to be invested with their ensigns, the formal installation of knights at St George&#x27;s Chapel ceased in 1805. Installation, along with the annual Garter service, returned in 1948; on the occasion of the order&#x27;s 600th anniversary.

==Privileges==
=== Precedence ===
Members are assigned positions in the order of precedence, coming before all others of knightly rank, and above baronets. The wives, sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of Knights Companion are also assigned precedence. Relatives of Ladies Companion are not, however, assigned any special positions. (Generally, individuals can derive precedence from their fathers or husbands, but not from their wives.) The Chancellor is also assigned precedence, but since 1837 the office has been held by a diocesan bishop of the Church of England or a peer, which have a higher precedence than that bestowed by the Chancellorship.

Knights Companion prefix &quot;Sir&quot; and Ladies Companion prefix &quot;Lady&quot; to their forenames. Wives of Knights Companion may prefix &quot;Lady&quot; to their surnames, but no corresponding privilege exists for husbands of Ladies Companion. Such forms are not used by royalty, peers, peeresses, or Anglican clergymen, who instead use only the post-nominal letters.

Knights and Ladies Companion use the post-nominal letters &quot;KG&quot; and &quot;LG&quot; respectively. When an individual is entitled to use multiple post-nominal letters, those of the Order of the Garter appear before all others, except &quot;Bt&quot; or &quot;Bart&quot; (Baronet), &quot;VC&quot; (Victoria Cross) and &quot;GC&quot; (George Cross).

=== Heraldry ===
In their heraldic achievements, members of the Order of the Garter may encircle their escutcheon with the Garter. Knights and Ladies Companion are also entitled to receive heraldic supporters, a privilege granted to few other private individuals. While some families claim supporters by ancient use, and others have been granted them as a special reward, only members of the Royal Family, peers, Knights and Ladies Companion of the Garter, Knights and Ladies of the Thistle, and Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the junior orders of chivalry are automatically entitled to them.

<text>The Apple IIe (styled as Apple //e) is the third model in the Apple II series of personal computers produced by Apple Computer. It was released in January 1983 as the successor to the Apple II Plus. The &quot;e&quot; in the name stands for &quot;enhanced&quot;. It is the first Apple II with built-in lowercase and 80-column text support, as well as 64K RAM, while reducing the total chip count from previous models by approximately 75%.

Improved expandability combined with the new features made for an attractive general-purpose machine to first-time computer shoppers. As the last surviving model of the Apple II computer line before discontinuation, and having been manufactured and sold for nearly 11 years with relatively few changes, the IIe was the longest-lived computer in Apple&#x27;s history.

==History==

Apple Computer planned to discontinue the Apple II series after the introduction of the Apple III in 1980; the company intended to clearly establish market segmentation by designing the Apple III to appeal to the business market, leaving the Apple II for home and education users. Management believed that &quot;once the Apple III was out, the Apple II would stop selling in six months&quot;, cofounder Steve Wozniak later said.

By the time IBM released the rival IBM PC in 1981, the Apple II&#x27;s technology was already four years old. In September 1981 &quot;InfoWorld&quot; reported—below the PC&#x27;s announcement—that Apple was secretly developing three new computers &quot;to be ready for release within a year&quot;: Lisa, Macintosh, and &quot;Diana&quot;. Describing the last as a software-compatible Apple II replacement—&quot;A 6502 machine using custom LSI&quot; and a simpler motherboard—it said that Diana &quot;was ready for release months ago&quot; but decided to improve the design to better compete with the Xerox 820. &quot;Now it appears that when Diana is ready for release, it will offer features and a price that will make the Apple II uncompetitive&quot;, the magazine wrote.

&quot;Apple&#x27;s plans to phase out the Apple II have also been delayed by complications in the design of the Apple III&quot;, the article also said. &quot;BYTE&quot; reported in October 1982 a rumor that the next Apple II would be called the IIe. After the Apple III sold poorly, management decided in 1981 that the further continuation of the Apple II was in the company&#x27;s best interest. After years of the Apple II Plus, essentially at a standstill, came the introduction of a new Apple II model — the Apple IIe (codenamed &quot;Diana&quot; and &quot;Super II&quot;). The Apple IIe was released in January 1983, the successor to the Apple II Plus. The Apple IIe was the first Apple computer with a custom ASIC chip, which reduced much of the old discrete IC-based circuitry to a single chip. This change resulted in reducing the cost and size of the motherboard. Some of the hardware features of the Apple III (e.g. bank-switched memory) were borrowed in the design of the Apple IIe, and some from incorporating the Apple II Plus Language card. The culmination of these changes led to increased sales and greater market share of home, education, and small business use.

==New features==


One of the most notable improvements of the Apple IIe is the addition of a ASCII-equivalent printable character set and keyboard. The most important addition is the ability to input and display lower-case letters. Other keyboard improvements include four-way cursor control and standard editing keys ( and ), two special Apple modifier keys (Open and Solid Apple), and a safe off-to-side relocation of the key. The auto-repeat function (any key held down to repeat same character continuously) is now automatic, no longer requiring the key found on the keyboards of previous models.

The machine came standard with 64 KB RAM, with the equivalent of a built-in Apple Language Card in its circuitry, and had a new special &quot;Auxiliary slot&quot; (replacing slot 0, though electronically mapped to slot 3 for compatibility with earlier third-party 80-column cards) for adding more memory via bank-switching RAM cards. Through this slot it also includes built-in support for an 80-column text display on monitors (with the addition of a plug-in 1K memory card, via bank-switching of 40 columns) and could be easily doubled to 128 KB RAM by alternatively plugging in Apple&#x27;s Extended 80-Column Text Card. As time progressed, even more memory could be added through third-party cards using the same bank-switching slot or, alternatively, general-purpose slot cards that addressed memory 1 byte at a time (i.e. Slinky RAM cards). A new ROM diagnostic routine could be invoked to test the motherboard for faults and also test its main bank of memory.

The Apple IIe lowered production costs and improved reliability by merging the function of several off-the-shelf ICs into single custom chips, reducing total chip count to 31 (previous models used 120 chips). The IIe also switched to using newer single-voltage 64x1 DRAM chips instead of the triple-voltage 16x1 DRAM in the II/II+. For this reason the motherboard design is much cleaner and runs cooler as well, with enough room to add a pin-connector for an (optional) external numeric keypad. Also added was a backport-accessible DE-9 joystick connector, making it far easier for users to add and remove game and input devices (previous models requiring plugging the joystick/paddles directly into a 16-pin DIP socket on the motherboard; the IIe retained this connector for backwards compatibility). Also improved were port openings for expansion cards. Rather than cutout V-shaped slot openings as in the Apple II and II Plus, the IIe has a variety of different-sized openings, with thumb-screw holes, to accommodate mounting interface cards with DB-xx and DE-xx connectors (removable plastic covers filled the cutouts if not used).

Although the lower IC count improved reliability over previous Apple II models, Apple still retained the practice of socketing all ICs so that servicing and replacement could be performed more easily. Later-production IIe models had the RAM soldered to the system board rather than socketed.

Despite the hardware changes, the IIe maintained a high degree of backwards compatibility with the previous models, allowing most hardware and software from those systems to be used. Apple provided technical information on the IIe to hundreds of developers before its release, and claimed that, as a result, 85 to 90% of Apple II software worked with it.

==Reception==
&quot;BYTE&quot; wrote in February 1983 that the IIe was &quot;like having an Apple II with all the extras built in ... with a variety of exciting new features and capabilities&quot; for about the same price as the Apple II. It found the computer to be highly compatible with the Apple II and praised the quality of the documentation for developers and beginners. The review concluded, &quot;Congratulations, Apple Computer, you&#x27;ve produced another winner&quot;. &quot;InfoWorld&quot;″s reviewers, Apple II Plus owners for four years, wished that the IIe&#x27;s price were lower but stated that it &quot;does give you more for your money, however&quot;. They also found compatibility to be very high, and concluded that &quot;we are generally pleased with the changes Apple has provided with the IIe&quot;. &quot;Creative Computing&quot; said in December 1984 that the IIe and IIc were the best home computers with prices above $500, with the IIe better for those wanting expansion cards, color graphics, and educational and entertainment software. The magazine also chose the IIe as the best educational computer above $1000, citing Apple&#x27;s strong early commitment to the market and large number of third-party education-related peripherals.

;Notes
==Revisions==
In production from January 1983 to November 1993, the Apple IIe remained relatively unchanged through the years. However, there was one significant motherboard update, a major firmware update and two cosmetically revised machines. These revisions are detailed below.

===Revision A motherboard===
At the time of the Apple IIe&#x27;s introduction, and well into the first few months of production, this motherboard shipped with all units. Graphics modes supported are identical to, and limited to, those of the Apple II Plus before it (Double-Low/Double-High resolution is not supported). This revision logic board is also incompatible with a small number of newer plug-in expansion slot cards. Under a free service upgrade program, Apple advised owners of the revision A to have authorized dealers replace it with the revision B motherboard.

===Revision B motherboard===
Shortly after the &quot;Revision A&quot; motherboard&#x27;s release in 1983, engineers discovered that the bank-switching feature (which used a paralleled 64 KB of RAM on the Extended 80-Column Card or 1 KB to produce 80 columns using bank-switching) could also be used to produce a new graphics mode, Double-High-Resolution, which doubles the horizontal resolution and increases the number of colors from the 6 of standard High-Resolution to 16. In order to support this, some modifications had to be made to the motherboard, which became the Revision B. In addition to supporting Double-High-Resolution and a rarely used Double-Low-Resolution mode (see specifications above) it also added a special video signal accessible in slot 7.

Apple upgraded the motherboard free of charge. In later years Apple labeled newer IIe motherboards with a &quot;-A&quot; suffix once again, although in terms of functionality they were Revision B motherboards.

===New case and keyboard===
In 1984, Apple revised the case and keyboard. The original IIe uses a case very similar to the Apple II Plus, painted and with Velcro-type clips to secure the lid with a strip of metal mesh along the edge to eliminate radio frequency interference. The new case is made of dyed plastic mold in a slightly darker beige with a simplified snap-case lid. The other noticeable change is a new keyboard, with more-professional-looking print on darker keycaps (small black lettering, versus large white print). This was the first cosmetic change.

===Enhanced IIe===
In March 1985, the company replaced the original machine with a new revision called the Enhanced IIe. It is completely identical to the previous machine except for four chips changed on the motherboard (and a small &quot;&quot;Enhanced&quot; or &quot;65C02&quot;&quot; sticker placed over the keyboard power indicator). The purpose of the update was to make the Apple IIe more compatible with the Apple IIc (released the previous year) and, to a smaller degree, the Apple II Plus. This change involved a new processor, the CMOS-based 65C02 CPU, a new character ROM for the text modes, and two new ROM firmware chips. The 65C02 added more CPU instructions, the new character ROM added 32 special &quot;MouseText&quot; characters (which allowed the creation of a GUI-like display in text mode, similar to IBM code page 437), and the new ROM firmware fixed problems and speed issues with 80-column text, introduced the ability to use lowercase in Applesoft BASIC and Monitor, and contained some other smaller improvements (and fixes) in the latter two (including the return of the Mini-Assembler—which had vanished with the introduction of the II Plus firmware).

Although it affected compatibility with a small number of software titles (particularly those that did not follow Apple programming guidelines and rules, used illegal opcodes that were no longer available in the new CMOS-based CPU, or used the alternate 80-column character set that MouseText now occupied) a fair bit of newer software — mostly productivity applications and utilities — required the Enhanced chipset to run at all. An official upgrade kit, consisting of the four replacement chips and an &quot;Enhanced&quot; sticker badge, was made available for purchase to owners of the original Apple IIe. An alternative at the time, which some users chose as a cost-cutting measure, was to simply purchase their own 65C02 CPU and create (unlicensed and illegal) duplicates of the updated ROMs using re-rewritable EPROM chips. When Apple phased out the Enhancement kit in the early 1990s, this became the only available method for users looking to upgrade their IIe, and remains so right up until the present day. An Enhanced machine identifies itself with the name &quot;Apple //e&quot; on its start-up splash screen (as opposed to the less-specific &quot;Apple ][&quot;).

===Platinum IIe===
In January 1987 came the final revision of the Apple IIe, often referred to as the Platinum IIe, due to the color change of its case to the light-grey color scheme that Apple dubbed &quot;Platinum&quot;. Changes to this revision were mostly cosmetic to modernize the look of the machine. Besides the color change, there was a new keyboard layout with built-in numeric keypad. The keyboard was changed to match the layout of the Apple IIGS, with the reset key moved above the ESC and &#x27;1&#x27; keys, the Open and Solid Apple modifier keys replaced by Command and Option and the power LED relocated above the numeric keypad. Gone were the recessed metal ID badges (showing the Apple logo and name, with &quot;//e&quot; beside it) replaced with a simpler &quot;Apple IIe&quot; silk screened on the case lid in the Apple Garamond font. A smaller Apple logo badge remained, which was moved to the right side of the case.

Internally, a (reduced in size) Extended 80-Column Card was factory-installed, making the Platinum IIe come standard with 128 KB RAM and Double-Hi-Res graphics enabled. The motherboard has a reduced chip count by merging the two system ROM chips into one and using higher-density memory chips so its 64 KB RAM can be made up of two (64 Kbx4) chips rather than eight (64 Kbx1) chips, bringing the count down to a total of 24 chips. A solder pad location on the motherboard, present since the original IIe, for (optionally) making presses of the &quot;Shift&quot; keys detectable in software, is now shorted by default so that the feature is always active. Next, in a move to reduce radio frequency interference when a joystick plugs into the motherboard&#x27;s game I/O socket, filtering capacitors were added. While this made no difference to the average user, it had the negative effect of lowering the available bandwidth to the socket, which is often used by specialized devices for such purposes as measuring temperature, controlling a robotic device, or even simplistic networking for data transfer to another computer. In such cases, the specialized devices were rendered useless on the Platinum IIe unless the user removed the capacitors from the board.

There were no firmware changes present, and functionally the motherboard was otherwise identical to the Enhanced IIe. This final model of the Apple IIe (which was not sold in Europe) was quietly discontinued on November 15, 1993, which (following the discontinuation of the Apple II a year earlier) effectively marked the end of the Apple II family line.

==Apple IIe Card for Macintosh==
In March 1991, shortly after the release of the Macintosh LC series, Apple released the PDS slot-based Apple IIe Card for the Macintosh. By plugging this card into a Macintosh LC (and later models incorporating an LC PDS slot), through hardware and (some) software emulation, the Macintosh can run most software written for the 8-bit Apple IIe computer. This miniaturized computer on a card was made possible by a chip called the Gemini, which is heavily based on the Mega II, first used in the Apple IIGS computer to emulate the Apple IIe. The Gemini duplicates most of the functions of a standard Apple IIe, minus RAM, ROM, video generation and CPU.

Many of the built-in Macintosh peripherals can be &quot;borrowed&quot; by the card when in Apple II mode (i.e. extra RAM, 3-inch floppy, AppleTalk networking, clock, hard disk). It can run at either standard 1 MHz speed or an accelerated 1.9 MHz. As video is emulated using Macintosh QuickDraw routines, it is sometimes unable to keep up with the speed of a real Apple IIe, especially in the case of slower host machines. With a specialized Y-cable, the card can use an actual Apple 5.25, Apple UniDisk 3.5 and Apple II joystick or paddles. The Apple IIe Card is thought of as an Apple II compatibility solution or emulator rather than as an extension of the Apple II line.

==International versions==

===Regional differences===

The Apple IIe keyboard differed depending on what region of the world it was sold in. Sometimes the differences were very minor, such as extra local language characters and symbols printed on certain keycaps (e.g. French accented characters on the Canadian IIe such as &quot;à&quot;, &quot;é&quot;, &quot;ç&quot;, etc., or the British Pound &quot;£&quot; symbol on the UK IIe) while other times the layout and shape of keys greatly differed (e.g. a European IIe). In order to access the local character set and keyboard layout, a user-accessible switch is found on the underside of the keyboard — flipping it will instantly switch the video output and keyboard input from the US character set to the local set. To support this, special double-capacity video and keyboard ROMs are used; in early motherboards they had to reside on a tiny circuit card that plugged into the socket. In some countries these localized IIes also support 50 Hz PAL video instead of the standard 60 Hz NTSC video and the different 220/240 volt power of that region. An equivalent of the &quot;PAL color card&quot; for the earlier Apple II Europlus model was integrated into the motherboard of these IIes, so that color graphics are available without the addition of a slot card.

Another difference with the European IIe, is the Auxiliary slot physically moved in location so it is in line and in front of slot 3, preventing both slots from being used simultaneously for full-sized cards. A few third-party cards are affected by this; some European cards plug into both slots simultaneously and are thus unusable on American IIes, and some American cards do not fit into the case of European IIes because the European location of the Auxiliary slot leaves less room for them.

===European Platinum IIe (hybrid)===
During approximately the same time period that the Platinum IIe was being produced (1987), Apple released an alternative machine for the European market. It reused the original Apple IIe case mold and keyboard, but both were redyed in the platinum color scheme—including the metal ID badges which were recolored from dark brown to platinum, blending them into the case lid. Additionally, the sticker over the keyboard power indicator was labeled &quot;65C02&quot; rather than &quot;Enhanced&quot;. Internally it used the same (newer) motherboard found in the Platinum IIe with reduced chip count. Notably absent is the numeric keypad and standardized keyboard layout found on the Platinum IIe.

This cosmetic reissue of the classic IIe, with new motherboard and new coloring scheme, was only available in Europe, and therefore also had regional differences mentioned above. It has been rumored that a small number of these machines were made available in the Canadian and US markets, using the standard North American keyboard and motherboard (photographic evidence of this North American variant can be found in some period Apple II magazines). This hybrid platinum model is somewhat rare.

==Upgrades==

===Apple IIGS upgrade kit===

When the Apple IIGS computer was introduced in September 1986, Apple announced it would be making an upgrade kit for the IIe. The upgrade cost US$500, plus the trade-in of the user&#x27;s existing Apple IIe motherboard and baseplate.

Users would bring their Apple IIe machines in to an authorized dealership, where the 65C02-based IIe motherboard and lower baseboard of the case were swapped for a 65C816-based Apple II motherboard with a new baseboard. New metal sticker ID badges replaced those on the front of the Apple IIe, rebranding the machine. Retained were the upper half of the IIe case, the keyboard, speaker, and power supply. Original II motherboards (those produced between 1986 and mid-1989) had electrical connections for the IIe power supply and keyboard present, although only about half of the units produced had the physical plug connectors factory-soldered in.

The upgrade kit proved unpopular as it did not include a mouse; the keyboard did not mimic all the features of the Apple Desktop Bus keyboard; and some cards designed for the Apple II did not fit in the Apple IIe&#x27;s slanted case. In the end, most users found they were not saving much, once they had to purchase a 3.5-inch floppy drive, analog RGB monitor, and mouse.

For a time, the Western Design Center (the company that designed the 16-bit 65C816 processor used in the Apple II) also sold a 16-bit 65C802 processor that was a drop-in, pin-compatible replacement for the 65C02 that made the full 16-bit 65C816 instruction set available to the IIe, but using the same 8-bit data bus as the 65C02; however, this upgrade was insufficient, by itself, to allow II software to run, as II software additionally required the II&#x27;s firmware and specialized hardware.

<doc id="73266" wikidata="Q223274" url="?curid=73266" title="Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi">
<text>Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi ( , ; 2 August 1834 – 4 October 1904) was a French sculptor and painter. He is best known for designing &quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;, commonly known as the Statue of Liberty.

==Early life and education==

Bartholdi was born in Colmar, France, on . He was born to a family of Alsatian Protestant heritage, with his family name adopted from Barthold. His parents were Jean Charles Bartholdi (1791–1836) and Augusta Charlotte Bartholdi (; 1801–1891). Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi was the youngest of their four children, and one of only two to survive infancy, along with the oldest brother, Jean-Charles, who became a lawyer and editor.

Bartholdi&#x27;s father, a property owner and counselor to the prefecture, died when Bartholdi was two years old. Afterwards, Bartholdi moved with his mother and his older brother Jean-Charles to Paris, where another branch of their family resided. With the family often returning to spend long periods of time in Colmar, the family maintained ownership and visited their house in Alsace, which later became the Bartholdi Museum in 1922. While in Colmar, Bartholdi took drawing lessons from Martin Rossbach. In Paris, he studied sculpture with Antoine Étex. He also studied architecture under Henri Labrouste and Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc.

Bartholdi attended the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris and received a baccalauréat in 1852. He then went on to study architecture at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts as well as painting under Ary Scheffer in his studio in the Rue Chaptal, now the Musée de la Vie Romantique. Later, Bartholdi turned his attention to sculpture, which afterward exclusively occupied him and his life.

== Career ==
=== Early sculptures and work in Colmar ===

In 1853, Bartholdi submitted a Good Samaritan-themed sculptural group to the Paris Salon of 1853. The statue was later recreated in bronze. Within two years of his Salon debut, Bartholdi was commissioned by his hometown of Colmar to sculpt a bronze memorial of Jean Rapp, a Napoleonic General. In 1855 and 1856, Bartholdi traveled in Yemen and Egypt with travel companions such as Jean-Léon Gérôme and other &quot;orientalist&quot; painters. The trip sparked Bartholdi&#x27;s interest in colossal sculpture.

In 1869, Bartholdi returned to Egypt to propose a new lighthouse to be built at the entrance of the Suez Canal, which was newly completed. The lighthouse, which was to be called &quot;Egypt Carrying the Light to Asia&quot; and shaped as a massive, draped figure holding a torch, was not commissioned. Both the khedive and Lesseps declined the proposed statue from Bartholdi, citing the high cost. The Port Said Lighthouse was built instead, by François Coignet in 1869.

=== The war and Statue of Liberty ===

Bartholdi served in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 as a squadron leader of the National Guard, and as a liaison officer to Italian General Giuseppe Garibaldi, representing the French government and the Army of the Vosges. As an officer, he took part in the defense of Colmar from Germany. Distraught over his region&#x27;s defeat, over the following years he constructed a number of monuments celebrating French heroism in the defense against Germany. Among these projects was the &quot;Lion of Belfort&quot;, which he started working on in 1871, not finishing the massive sandstone statue until 1880.

In 1871, he made his first trip to the United States, where he pitched the idea of a massive statue gifted from the French to the Americans in honor of the centennial of American independence. The idea, which had first been broached to him in 1865 by his friend Édouard René de Laboulaye, resulted in the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. After years of work and fundraising, the statue was inaugurated in 1886. During this period, Bartholdi also sculpted monuments for other American cities, such as the Bartholdi Fountain in Washington, D.C., completed in 1878.

=== Later years ===
In 1875, he joined the Freemasons Lodge Alsace-Lorraine in Paris. In 1876, Bartholdi was one of the French commissioners in 1876 to the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. There he exhibited bronze statues of &quot;The Young Vine-Grower&quot;, &quot;Génie Funèbre&quot;, &quot;Peace&quot; and &quot;Genius in the Grasp of Misery&quot;, receiving a bronze medal for the latter. His 1878 statue &quot;Gribeauval&quot; became the property of the French state.

A prolific creator of statues, monuments, and portraits, Bartholdi exhibited at the Paris Salons until the year of his death in 1904. He also remained active with diverse mediums, including oil painting, watercolor, photography, and drawing, and received the rank of Commander of the Legion of Honor in 1886. Bartholdi died of tuberculosis at age 70 in Paris on .

==Personal life==
In 1876, he married Jeanne-Emile Baheux in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1893, Bartholdi and his wife visited the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, where his &quot;Washington and Lafayette&quot; sculptural group was exhibited. Throughout his life Bartholdi maintained his childhood family home in Colmar; in 1922, it was made into the Musée Bartholdi.

==Major projects==
===The Statue of Liberty (&quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;)===
The work for which Bartholdi is most famous is &quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;, better known as the Statue of Liberty. Soon after the establishment of the French Third Republic, the project of building some suitable memorial to show the fraternal feeling existing between the republics of the United States and France was suggested, and in 1874 the Union Franco-Américaine (Franco-American Union) was established by Edouard de Laboulaye.

Bartholdi&#x27;s hometown in Alsace had just passed into German control in the Franco-Prussian War. These troubles in his ancestral home of Alsace are purported to have further influenced Bartholdi&#x27;s own great interest in independence, liberty, and self-determination. Bartholdi subsequently joined the Union Franco-Américaine, among whose members were Laboulaye, Paul de Rémusat, William Waddington, Henri Martin, Ferdinand Marie de Lesseps, Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, Oscar Gilbert Lafayette, François Charles Lorraine, and Louis François Lorraine.

Bartholdi broached the idea of a massive statue and once its design was approved, the Union Franco-Américaine raised more than 1 million francs throughout France for its building. In 1879, Bartholdi was awarded design patent for the Statue of Liberty. On , the statue was formally delivered to the American minister in Paris, the event being celebrated by a great banquet. In , the structure was officially presented as the joint gift of the French and American people, and installed on Bedloe&#x27;s Island in New York Harbor. It was rumored in France that the face of the Statue of Liberty was modeled after Bartholdi&#x27;s mother. The statue is , and the top of the torch is at an elevation of from mean low-water mark. It was the largest work of its kind that had been completed up to that time.

===Works in Colmar===
Bartholdi&#x27;s hometown Colmar (modern political administrative region of Grand Est) has a number of statues and monuments by the sculptor, as well as a museum founded in 1922 in the house in which he was born, at 30 Rue des Marchands.

* &quot;Monument du Général Rapp&quot; – 1856 (first shown 1855 in Paris. Bartholdi&#x27;s earliest major work)
* &quot;Fontaine Schongauer&quot; – 1863 (in front of the Unterlinden Museum)
* &quot;Fontaine de l&#x27;Amiral Bruat&quot; – 1864
* &quot;Fontaine Roeselmann&quot; – 1888
* &quot;Monument Hirn&quot; – 1894
* &quot;Fontaine Schwendi&quot;, depicting Lazarus von Schwendi – 1898
* &quot;Les grands soutiens du monde&quot; − 1902 (statue in the courtyard of the museum)

===Other major works===

Bartholdi&#x27;s other major works include a variety of statues at Clermont-Ferrand; in Paris, and in other places. Notable works include:

* 1852: &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot;
* 1870: &quot;Le Vigneron&quot;
* 1876 (plaster version in 1874) : Frieze and four angelic trumpeters on the tower of Brattle Square Church, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.
* 1876: &quot;Marquis de Lafayette&quot; (or &quot;Lafayette Arriving in America&quot;), executed 1872, cast 1873 in Union Square, New York City, United States.
* 1878: The Bartholdi Fountain in Bartholdi Park, the United States Botanic Garden, Washington, D.C., United States.

<text>The Scheldt ( ; ; ) is a river that flows through northern France, western Belgium, and the southwestern part of the Netherlands, with its mouth at the North Sea. Its name is derived from an adjective corresponding to Old English (&quot;shallow&quot;), Modern English &quot;shoal&quot;, Low German , West Frisian , and obsolete Swedish (&quot;thin&quot;).

==Course==
The headwaters of the Scheldt are in Gouy, in the Aisne department of northern France. It flows north through Cambrai and Valenciennes, and enters Belgium near Tournai. Ghent developed at the confluence of the Lys, one of its main tributaries, and the Scheldt, which then turns east. Near Antwerp, the largest city on its banks, the Scheldt flows west into the Netherlands toward the North Sea.

Originally there were two branches from that point: the Oosterschelde (Eastern Scheldt); and the Westerschelde (Western Scheldt). In the 19th century, however, the Dutch built a dyke that cuts the river off from its eastern (northern) branch and connects Zuid-Beveland with the mainland (North Brabant). Today the river continues into the Westerschelde estuary only, passing Terneuzen to reach the North Sea between Breskens in Zeelandic Flanders and Vlissingen (Flushing) on Walcheren.

The Scheldt is an important waterway, and has been made navigable from its mouth up to Cambrai. Above Cambrai, the Canal de Saint-Quentin follows its course. The port of Antwerp, the second-largest in Europe, developed on its banks. Several canals (including the Scheldt-Rhine Canal connecting Antwerp to Rotterdam, the Albert Canal connecting it to Liège and the Brussel-Scheldt, Brussels and Brussels-Charleroi canals connecting it to Charleroi via Brussels) connect the Scheldt with the basins of the Rhine, Meuse, and Seine rivers, and with the industrial areas around Brussels, Liège, Lille, Dunkirk, and Mons.

The Scheldt flows through the following departments of France, provinces of Belgium, provinces of the Netherlands, and towns:

* Aisne (F): Gouy
* Nord (F): Cambrai, Denain, Valenciennes
* Hainaut (B): Tournai
* West Flanders (B): Avelgem
* East Flanders (B): Oudenaarde, Ghent, Dendermonde, Temse
* Antwerp (B): Antwerp
* Zeeland (NL): Hulst, Terneuzen, Sluis, Vlissingen

==History==
 
The Scheldt estuary has always had considerable commercial and strategic importance. Called &quot;Scaldis&quot; in Roman times, it was important for the shipping lanes to Roman Britain. Nehalennia was venerated at its mouth. The Franks took control over the region about the year 260 and at first interfered with the Roman supply routes as pirates. Later they became allies of the Romans. With the various divisions of the Frankish Empire in the 9th century, the Scheldt eventually became the border between the Western and Eastern parts of the Empire, which later became France and the Holy Roman Empire.

This status quo remained intact, at least on paper, until 1528, but by then, both the County of Flanders on the western bank and Zeeland and the Duchy of Brabant on the east were part of the Habsburg possessions of the Seventeen Provinces. Antwerp was the most prominent harbour in Western Europe. After this city fell back under Spanish control in 1585, the Dutch Republic took control of Zeelandic Flanders, a strip of land on the left bank, and closed the Scheldt for shipping. That shifted the trade to the ports of Amsterdam and Middelburg and seriously crippled Antwerp, an important and traumatic element in the history of relations between the Netherlands and what was to become Belgium.

Access to the river was the subject of the brief Kettle War of 1784, and during the French Revolution shortly afterwards, the river was reopened in 1792. Once Belgium had claimed its independence from the Netherlands in 1830, the treaty of the Scheldt determined that the river should remain accessible to ships heading for Belgian ports. Nevertheless, the Dutch government would demand a toll from passing vessels until 16 July 1863.

&quot;The Question of the Scheldt&quot;, a study providing &quot;a history of the international legal arrangements governing the Western Scheldt&quot;, was prepared for the use of British negotiators at the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.

In the Second World War, the Scheldt estuary once again became a contested area. Despite Allied control of Antwerp, German forces still occupied fortified positions in September 1944 throughout the Scheldt estuary west and north, preventing any Allied shipping from reaching the port. In the Battle of the Scheldt, the Canadian First Army successfully cleared the area, allowing supply convoys direct access to the port of Antwerp by November 1944.

== Navigation ==

Canalisation from Cambrai down to Valenciennes was completed in 1788. Napoleon saw the benefits of linking Paris to Belgium and accelerated completion of the Canal de Saint-Quentin to the south. The locks were deepened and doubled, as coal became the essential commodity of the industrial revolution. Upgrading downstream from Bouchain was started in the 1960s in both France and Flanders, but the waterway is still not fully compliant with European standards. All the locks on the high-capacity section are being doubled by European Class Vb size locks, , as part of the overall European Seine-Scheldt waterway project. The Pont des Trous, a listed fortified bridge in Tournai that has already been substantially modified, will again be raised to provide the necessary dimensions, including an air draught of .

The 13 km section between Cambrai (connection with Canal de Saint-Quentin) and Hordain (connection with Canal de la Sensée) is only navigable for small ships (péniche) and has 5 locks.

<doc id="73273" wikidata="Q639408" url="?curid=73273" title="Waterloo, Ontario">
<text>Waterloo is a city in the Canadian province of Ontario. It is one of three cities in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo (formerly Waterloo County). Waterloo is situated about west-southwest of Toronto, but it is not considered to be part of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Due to the close proximity of the city of Kitchener to Waterloo, the two together are often referred to as &quot;Kitchener–Waterloo&quot;, &quot;K-W&quot;, or &quot;The Twin Cities&quot;.

While several unsuccessful attempts to combine the municipalities of Kitchener and Waterloo have been made, following the 1973 establishment of the Region of Waterloo, less motivation to do so existed, and as a result, Waterloo remains an independent city. At the time of the 2021 census, the population of Waterloo was 121,436.

==History==
=== Indigenous peoples and settlement ===
Indigenous peoples such as the Iroquois, Anishinaabe and Chonnonton lived in the area.

After the end of the American Revolution, Joseph Brant, a Mohawk war chief, wanted Frederick Haldimand to give the Mohawk and Six Nations a tract of land surrounding the Grand River, in return for their loyalty to the British in the war. Haldimand&#x27;s 1784 &quot;Haldimand Proclamation&quot; granted the land &quot;six miles deep from either side of the [Grand River] beginning at Lake Erie and extending in that proportion to the very head of the said river.&quot; Haldimand, who had previously ordered for potential mill sites to be identified in the region, decreed in 1788 that mill sites would be included in the grant (which would not have been included otherwise). In 1796, Richard Beasley purchased Block Number 2 of the grant from Joseph Brant (on behalf of the Six Nations) with a mortgage held by the Six Nations. Block 2, 94,012 acres in size, was situated in the District of Gore. To meet his mortgage obligations, Beasley had to sell portions of the land to settlers. This was counter to the original mortgage agreement, but subsequent changes to the agreement were made to permit land sales.

Mennonites from Pennsylvania counties Lancaster and Montgomery were the first wave of immigrants to the area. In the year 1800 alone, Beasley sold over 14,000 acres to Mennonite settlers. A group of 26 Mennonites from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, pooled their resources into the German Company of Pennsylvania, which was then represented by Daniel Erb and Samuel Bricker. The company purchased all the unsold land from Beasley in 1803, resulting in a discharge of the mortgage held by the Six Nations. This discharge allowed Beasley to clear his obligation with the Six Nations, and allowed the settlers to have deeds to their purchased land. The payment to Beasley, in cash, arrived from Pennsylvania in kegs, carried in a wagon surrounded by armed guards.

Many of the pioneers who arrived from Pennsylvania after November 1803 bought land in a 60,000-acre tract of Block 2 from the German Company of Pennsylvania. The tract included almost two-thirds of Block 2. Many of the first farms were least 400 acres in size.

=== Development (19th century) ===
The Mennonites divided the land into smaller lots; two lots owned by Abraham Erb—who is often called the founder of the Village of Waterloo—became the central core of Waterloo. Erb had come to the area in 1806 from Pennsylvania. He had bought from the German Company Tract and settled where there was enough water power to operate mills. He founded a sawmill in 1808 and grist mill in 1816; they saw business flourish. Other early settlers of what would become Waterloo included Samuel and Elia Schneider, who arrived in 1816. Until about 1820, settlements such as this were quite small. Erb also built what is now known as the Erb-Kumpf House in c. 1812, making it likely one of the oldest homes in Waterloo.

The first school in what is now the City of Waterloo was built on land donated by Erb; the log building was constructed in 1820. A larger school house of stone was built in 1842 and was replaced with a brick school building in 1852. Over the decades, the log building was moved, eventually to Waterloo Park, where it still stands. The German spoken in Waterloo County is based upon the 18th century Pennsylvania Dutch dialect. In turn, the Pennsylvania Dutch dialect is based upon the dialect of German spoken in southwestern Germany.

In 1816, the new Waterloo Township was officially incorporated while being named after Waterloo, Belgium, the site of the Battle of Waterloo (1815), which had ended the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. After that war, the new township became a popular destination for German immigrants. By the 1840s, German settlers had overtaken the Mennonites as the dominant segment of the population. Many Germans settled in the small hamlet to the southeast of Waterloo. In their honour, the village was named Berlin in 1833 (renamed to Kitchener in 1916). The first Catholic family to arrive were the Spetz family from Alsace who came in 1828.

By 1831, Waterloo had a small post office in the King and Erb Street area, operated by Daniel Snyder, some 11 years before one would open in neighbouring Berlin. The &quot;Smith&#x27;s Canadian Gazetteer&quot; of 1846 states that the Township of Waterloo (smaller than Waterloo County) consisted primarily of Pennsylvanian Mennonites and immigrants directly from Germany who had brought money with them. At the time, many did not speak English. There were eight grist and twenty sawmills in the township. In 1841, the population count was 4424. In 1846 the village of Waterloo had a population of 200, &quot;mostly Germans&quot;. There was a grist mill and a sawmill and some tradesmen. By comparison, Berlin (Kitchener) had a population of about 400, also &quot;mostly German&quot;, and more tradesmen than the village of Waterloo.

Berlin was chosen as the site of the seat for the County of Waterloo in 1853. By 1869, the population was 2000. Waterloo was incorporated as a village in 1857 and became the Town of Waterloo in 1876. The Kitchener Public Utilities Commission began providing streetcar service in the region in 1888. In the 19th century, Waterloo was dominated by people of German origin with 76% of Waterloo residents in the 1911 census listing their family origins as being in Germany.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
The Galt, Preston and Hespeler electric railway (later called the Grand River Railway) connected to Waterloo in 1911 and ended service in 1931. The Kitchener Public Utilities Commission stopped providing streetcar service in 1947, and were replaced by electric trolley coaches. Waterloo was incorporated as the City of Waterloo in 1948. The trolley coaches ended service in 1973. In 1911, a plan was mooted to pave King street. William Snider who owned the town square, did not want to pay the higher taxes, which would refused from paving King Street. Snider offered to deed the town square to town, which instead demanded he pay the higher taxes. Snider sold the town square to the Molson Bank, which up a Beaux Arts style bank on the site of the town square in 1914. In 1929, the H.V. McKay company of Australia proposed to open a factory for &quot;one, man, self-propelled combine harvesters&quot;. The town provided the land for the factory from the Canada Barrels and Kegs and fixed the tax assessment at $25, 000 per year for the next 10 years in exchange for the factory being built.&gt; In 1911, Waterloo Lutheran seminary, which later became Wilfrid Laurier University, was opened. On 5 May 1916, a group of soldiers sacked the German Acadian Club in Waterloo. In October 1918, Spanish flu reached Waterloo. Over 2, 000 people were &quot;down with the malady&quot;. By November 1918, the Waterloo Chronicle reported that &quot;twice as many had died from the influenza as had been killed in action in four years of war&quot;.

The presence of the University of Waterloo in the city caused technological and innovative companies to base in Waterloo, especially companies specializing in computing and software. For example, Research in Motion (now BlackBerry Limited), which developed BlackBerry, was started by Mike Lazaridis and Doug Fregin in 1984. In 1965, the University of Waterloo was the second-largest private sector employer. The construction of the buildings for the University of Waterloo made the unemployment rate very low in the 1960s. By 1971, the population of Waterloo had grown 424% since 1945. Kitchener was a working class city while Waterloo was a middle class city. In 1981, the average annual household income in Kitchener was $26, 279 and in Waterloo was $31, 224. In 1950, Waterloo had 55 factories that employed 2, 572 people, in 1970 had 79 factories that employed $5, 483 workers, and in 1980 132 factories that employed 7, 314 workers. The founding of the universities led to the north-eastern area becoming developed as the new housing subdivisions were built while the area around Weber declined. The architecture of Waterloo changed from a more traditional Victorian architecture style to favouring a more streamlined look, incorporating elements from architectural styles such as Postmodern architecture, which ultimately led to a movement to preserve Waterloo&#x27;s historical core. A 1994 issue of the &quot;Financial Post&quot; mentioned Waterloo-based companies MKS, WATCOM, and Open Text in a list of the top 100 independent software companies in Canada. In 1960, a study revealed 50% of the buying by Waterloo consumers was done in Kitchener, leading to the city to develop a retail district.

In the 1980s, Waterloo came to have the character of a &quot;post-industrial city&quot;. Mennonite farmers continued to come to Waterloo in their horse-powered buggies for shopping while the middle class people drove out to eat and drink at the numerous pubs and hotels out in the countryside.

In June 2011, the Waterloo Region council approved the Ion: a light rail transit line connecting Conestoga Mall in north Waterloo and Fairview Park Mall in south Kitchener. Construction on the Ion began in August 2014. In 2016, two sections of a corduroy road were unearthed. One was in the King Street area of the business district and the second was discovered near the Conestoga Mall. The road was probably built by Mennonites using technology acquired in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, between the late 1790s and 1816. The log road was buried in about 1840 and a new road built on top of it. A historian explained that the road had been built for access to the mill but was also &quot;one of the first roads cut through (the woods) so people could start settling the area&quot;. Ion service began in 2019 and experienced a daily ridership of 25,000 in November 2020.

==Geography==
Waterloo&#x27;s city centre is near the intersection of King and Erb streets. The city centre was once along Albert Street, near the Marsland Centre and the Waterloo Public Library. The town hall, fire hall, and farmers&#x27; market were located there. Amidst some controversy, all were demolished between 1965 and 1969.

Historically, Waterloo&#x27;s swamp land near where the village was first developed caused problems for development. To mitigate these issues, sand was taken from nearby areas to raise the land; buildings were built on foundations of oak planks; and King Street was originally built as a corduroy road.

===Waterways===

The Grand River flows southward along the city&#x27;s east side. Its most significant tributary within the city is Laurel Creek, whose source lies just to the west of the city limits and its mouth just to the east, and crosses much of the city&#x27;s central areas, including the University of Waterloo lands and Waterloo Park; it flows under the uptown area in a culvert. In the city&#x27;s west end, the Waterloo Moraine provides over 300,000 people in the region with drinking water. Much of the gently hilly Waterloo Moraine underlies existing developed areas. Ongoing urban growth, mostly low-density residential suburbs (in accordance with requests by land developers), will cover increasing amounts of the remaining undeveloped portions of the Waterloo Moraine.

===Climate===
Waterloo has a humid continental climate of the warm summer subtype (&quot;Dfb&quot; under the Köppen climate classification) with warm, humid summers and cold winters. Compared to other parts of Canada, Waterloo has fairly moderate weather. Winter temperatures usually occur between mid-December and mid-March, while summer temperatures generally occur between mid-May and late September. It is not uncommon for temperatures to exceed 30 °C (86 °F) several times each summer. Waterloo has approximately 140 frost-free days per year.

=== Distilling and brewing ===
Breweries and distilleries had been a significant industry in the Waterloo area until 1993 when a Labatt-owned brewery was shut down. The Brick Brewing Company operated in Waterloo but is now based in Kitchener. Waterloo was the original home of distiller Seagram (also the home town of many descendants of J.P. Seagram), which closed its Waterloo plant in 1992. Of the remaining Seagram buildings, one became home of the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), while others were converted into condominiums.

== Recreation ==

Waterloo&#x27;s parks and recreation facilities mainly comprise Waterloo Park, Bechtel Park, Laurel Creek Conservation Area, the Waterloo Memorial Recreation Complex, RIM Park, and over of mixed-use trails.

=== Parks ===

Created in 1890, Waterloo Park is an urban park in Uptown Waterloo which includes an animal farm, sports fields, and a splash pad. It is the oldest park in the city; the mixed-use Laurel Trail and the rapid transit Ion line both run through the park. Bechtel Park is located in eastern Waterloo, and houses a dog park, three soccer fields, a field house, and more. Laurel Creek Conservation Area is in western Waterloo—north-west of University of Waterloo&#x27;s Environmental Reserve—and houses 122 campsites, of trails, and facilities for canoeing, swimming, windsurfing, cycling, and sailing.
The Waterloo Memorial Recreation Complex, then described as the &quot;largest and most expensive project in the city&#x27;s history&quot;, opened in 1993. It includes an arena seating 3,500, swimming and banquet facilities, and an indoor track. RIM Park, originally called Millennium Park, opened in September 2001. Its features include outdoor soccer fields, ice rinks, baseball diamonds, basketball courts, meeting rooms and more. RIM Park is in proximity to the Walter Bean Grand River Trail, Grey Silo Golf Course, and Waterloo Public Library&#x27;s Eastside Branch. There are a number of small playgrounds, woodlots, and recreation facilities around Waterloo which are not mentioned above due to their size.

=== Mixed-use trails ===

Trails for walking, hiking, and biking play an important part in Waterloo&#x27;s recreational infrastructure. Waterloo had of trails by 2007, as compared to of trails in 1987. The Iron Horse Trail, connecting Waterloo and Kitchener, opened in 1997. Then-mayor Joan McKinnon brought upon the connection of the Trans Canada Trail into the Waterloo Region, which ran from the Iron Horse Trail to Waterloo&#x27;s northern boundary.

The Walter Bean Grand River Trail, announced in 1999, served to create an accessible trail along the Grand River. &quot;Waterloo: An Illustrated History, 1857–2007&quot; states, &quot;[the trail] was particularly needed in Waterloo as the river&#x27;s geographic location on the edge of the city meant that, unlike so many other Canadian cities, the river had not historically played a central role in the community.&quot;

=== Sports ===
In July 2002, Waterloo, along with Kitchener, hosted the Ontario Summer Games. The following sports teams are based in Waterloo: Waterloo Wildfire (National Ringette League), Waterloo Siskins (Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League), Waterloo United (League One Ontario), Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks, and Waterloo Warriors.

==Government==

Waterloo was part of Waterloo County until 1973 when a restructuring created the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, which consists of the cities of Waterloo, Kitchener, and Cambridge, and the townships of Woolwich, Wilmot, Wellesley, and North Dumfries. The Region handles many services, including paramedic services, policing, waste management, recreation, planning, roads and social services. The Waterloo Award, established in 1997, is the highest civic honour a person can receive from the City of Waterloo.

Waterloo City Council consists of a mayor and seven councillors, each representing a ward. The number of wards was increased from five to seven in the November 2006 elections. As of 2022, the mayor of Waterloo is Dorothy McCabe, elected in October 2022. The current Waterloo councillors are as follows, as of 2022, listed by ascending ward number: Sandra Hanmer (Southwest Ward), Royce Bodaly (Northwest Ward), Hans Roach (Lakeshore Ward), Diane Freeman (Northeast Ward), Jen Vasic (Southeast Ward), Mary Lou Roe (Central-Columbia Ward), and Julie Wright (Uptown Ward).

In politics, Waterloo is within the federal electoral district of Waterloo, and within the provincial electoral district also named Waterloo.


== Transportation ==
=== Roads ===

The controlled-access Highway 85, part of the larger Conestoga Parkway, is the only provincial highway that runs through Waterloo. To the north, the divided freeway ends at the city limit, and the road becomes Waterloo Regional Road 85, which accesses St. Jacobs and Elmira, before ending in Elmira. To the south, Highway 85 becomes Highway 7 within Kitchener, before diverging into eastbound Highway 8 (to Cambridge, Highway 401 interchange, and Hamilton) and westbound Highway 7/8 (to New Hamburg, Stratford, and Goderich). Highway 85 has 5 interchanges within Waterloo, from north to south, with the regional road number in brackets: King Street (15), Northfield Drive (50), King Street (15), University Avenue (57), and Bridgeport Road (9).

=== Public transport ===
Public transport throughout the Waterloo Region is provided by Grand River Transit (GRT), which provides service for various bus routes and the Ion rapid transit line. The Ion is a light rail line providing service to 19 stations, from Conestoga station (Conestoga Mall in Waterloo) to Fairway station (Fairview Park Mall in Kitchener). The line connects downtown Kitchener and uptown Waterloo. GRT operates local and express bus routes within Waterloo, with connections to Kitchener. Waterloo is served by GO buses which stop at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University, with destinations of Square One City Centre Terminal, Milton GO Station, and York University.

=== Intercity rail ===

Waterloo is not currently served by any regularly scheduled passenger rail service. The nearby Kitchener station is accessible from Waterloo through buses or a transfer from Ion&#x27;s Kitchener Central Station. Kitchener station is serviced by the Kitchener line and the Corridor, operated by GO Transit and Via Rail respectively. Both services are infrequent. On weekdays, the commuter rail GO trains run eastbound (to Toronto) nine times per day, and westbound eight times per day. No Kitchener line trains are run on the weekends. Including weekends, Via Rail operates one train per day, both westbound and eastbound.

The non-profit tourist railway Waterloo Central Railway is a revival of the Waterloo-St. Jacobs Railway. It departs from the St. Jacobs Farmers Market and runs trains at 10 am, 12 pm, and 2 pm from April to November. The Waterloo Station continues to operate as a Visitor &amp; Heritage Information Centre.

=== Air ===
The Region of Waterloo International Airport in nearby Breslau serves Waterloo and the surrounding region, although it is not heavily served by scheduled airlines. Most air travellers use Toronto&#x27;s Lester B. Pearson International Airport or John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport. As of 2022, the Region of Waterloo International Airport has year round flights to Calgary, Cancun, Charlottetown, Deer Lake, Edmonton, Halifax, Kelowna, Vancouver, and Winnipeg. The airport has seasonal flights to Montreal and Ottawa. As of 2022, the airport&#x27;s airlines are Flair Airlines, Pivot Airlines, and WestJet.

== Services ==

===Health care===
There are no hospitals in Waterloo, but neighbouring Kitchener has Grand River Hospital (which has a secondary site, the Freeport Campus) and St. Mary&#x27;s General Hospital. Both were ranked highly for safety in a national comparison study in 2017–2018, but would benefit from reduced wait times. Long-term care beds are provided at numerous facilities. Grand River Hospital has a capacity of 574-beds; the Freeport location was merged into it in April 1995. St. Mary&#x27;s General Hospital is a 150-bed adult acute-care facility and includes the Regional Cardiac Care Centre with two cardiovascular operating rooms, an eight-bed cardiovascular intensive care unit and 45 inpatient beds.

Region of Waterloo Paramedic Services and Waterloo Fire Rescue respond to medical emergencies within the city of Waterloo. Region of Waterloo Paramedic Services may transport patients to either Grand River Hospital or St. Mary&#x27;s General Hospital emergency departments, depending on proximity, anticipated wait times and the type of emergency.

Family doctors are often in short supply and a source of great concern among residents. Recruiting efforts over the previous 15 years achieved some success as of September 2018, but needed to be continued.

===Libraries===
The Waterloo Public Library was founded in 1888. As of 2022, the library has 4 branches (in order of opening): the Main Branch, the Albert McCormick Branch, the John M. Harper Branch and the Eastside Branch. The Eastside Branch, opened May 7, 2022, is the newest branch built. The $10-million library is built into the existing RIM Park Manulife Sportsplex and has around 35,000 books.

===Fire protection===
Fire protection and rescue services are provided by Waterloo Fire Rescue, a service of the City of Waterloo. As of 2020, there are four active fire stations in Waterloo. Waterloo Fire Rescue responds to fires, medical emergencies, car accidents and chemical incidents. (Region of Waterloo Paramedic Services also responds to medical emergencies.) When the two-tier regional government system was implemented in the early 1970s, police service was moved to the regional government, but fire service remained at the local municipality (city or township) level. From time to time, the media and interested parties raise the question of whether this service should remain at the city level, or whether there might be cost savings or service improvements if the various fire services were merged into regional fire service. A 2019 newspaper article stated that &quot;there would likely be no cost savings, but service would improve under [a] regionalized system,&quot; in the view of some former fire chiefs.

===Policing===
Waterloo Regional Police Service, the seventh-largest police service in the province of Ontario, provides general police service in the city of Waterloo. The Waterloo Regional Police North Division is located at 45 Columbia Street East, Waterloo. Waterloo Regional Police also serve the municipalities of Kitchener and Cambridge and the Townships of Wellesley, Wilmot, Woolwich and North Dumfries. City of Waterloo bylaws controlling matters such as parking, weeds and noise are enforced by city bylaw enforcement officers. The two universities each have special constables who are first responders to all emergencies at their respective university campuses. Special Constables may lay charges and/or make arrests under the same legal authority as police officers. As of 2019, University of Waterloo Police Service had twenty-four Special Constables. Wilfrid Laurier University also has a Special Constable Service.
The Ontario Provincial Police patrols provincial highways. Two homicides were reported in the Waterloo Region in 2021, neither of which was in the city of Waterloo.

==Education==
The Waterloo Region District School Board is the region&#x27;s public school board. As of 2022, in Waterloo, they run 21 elementary schools (see List of Waterloo Region, Ontario schools) and three secondary schools, which are Bluevale Collegiate Institute, Laurel Heights Secondary School, and Waterloo Collegiate Institute. The Waterloo Catholic District School Board is the region&#x27;s catholic school board. As of 2022, in Waterloo, they run 8 elementary schools and one secondary school, which is St. David Catholic Secondary School.

<text>The University of Waterloo (UWaterloo, UW, or Waterloo) is a public research university with a main campus in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. The main campus is on of land adjacent to uptown Waterloo and Waterloo Park. The university also operates three satellite campuses and four affiliated university colleges. The university offers academic programs administered by six faculties and thirteen faculty-based schools. Waterloo operates the largest post-secondary co-operative education program in the world, with over 20,000 undergraduate students enrolled in the university&#x27;s co-op program. Waterloo is a member of the U15, a group of research-intensive universities in Canada.

The institution originates from the Waterloo College Associate Faculties, established on 4 April 1956; a semi-autonomous entity of Waterloo College, which was an affiliate of the University of Western Ontario. This entity formally separated from Waterloo College and was incorporated as a university with the passage of the &quot;University of Waterloo Act&quot; by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1959. It was established to fill the need to train engineers and technicians for Canada&#x27;s growing postwar economy. It grew substantially over the next decade, adding a faculty of arts in 1960, and the College of Optometry of Ontario (now the School of Optometry and Vision Science), which moved from Toronto in 1967.

The university is a co-educational institution, with approximately 36,000 undergraduate and 6,200 postgraduate students enrolled there in 2020. Alumni and former students of the university can be found across Canada and in over 150 countries; with a number of award winners, government officials, and business leaders having been associated with Waterloo. Waterloo&#x27;s varsity teams, known as the Waterloo Warriors, compete in the Ontario University Athletics conference of the U Sports.

== History ==

=== Twentieth century ===
The University of Waterloo traces its origins to Waterloo College (present-day Wilfrid Laurier University), the academic outgrowth of Waterloo Lutheran Seminary, which was affiliated with the University of Western Ontario since 1925. When Gerald Hagey assumed the presidency of Waterloo College in 1953, he made it his priority to procure the funds necessary to expand the institution. While the main source of income for higher education in Ontario at the time was the provincial government, the Ontario government made it clear it would not contribute to denominational colleges and universities.

Hagey soon became aware of the steps undertaken by McMaster University to make itself eligible for some provincial funding by establishing Hamilton College as a separate, non-denominational college affiliated with the university. Following that method, Waterloo College established the Waterloo College Associate Faculties on 4 April 1956, as a non-denominational board affiliated with the college. The academic structure of the Associated Faculties was originally focused on co-operative education in the applied sciences—largely built around the proposals of Ira Needles. Needles proposed a different approach towards education, including both studies in the classroom and training in industry that would eventually become the basis of the university&#x27;s co-operative education program. While the plan was initially opposed by the Engineering Institute of Canada and other Canadian universities, notably the University of Western Ontario, the Associated Faculties admitted its first students in July 1957.

On 25 January 1958, the Associated Faculties announced the purchase of over of land west of Waterloo College. By the end of the same year, the Associated Faculties opened its first building on the site, the Chemical Engineering Building.
In 1959, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed an act that formally split the Associated Faculties from Waterloo College, and re-established it as the University of Waterloo. The governance was modeled on the University of Toronto Act of 1906, which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate, responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to act as the institution&#x27;s chief executive officer and act as a liaison between the two groups.

The legislative act was the result of a great deal of negotiation between Waterloo College, Waterloo College Associated Faculties, and St. Jerome&#x27;s College, another denominational college in the City of Waterloo. While the agreements sought to safeguard the two denominational colleges, they also aimed at federating them with the newly established University of Waterloo. Due to disagreements with Waterloo College, the college was not formally federated with the new university. The dispute centred on a controversially worded section of the &quot;University of Waterloo Act, 1959&quot;, in which the college interpreted certain sections as a guarantee it would become the Faculty of Art for the new university. This was something the Associated Faculties were not prepared to accept. As a result of the controversy, Waterloo College&#x27;s entire Department of Mathematics broke from the college to join the newly established University of Waterloo, later joined by professors from the Economic, German, Modern Languages, and Russian departments. Despite this controversy, until 1960 Hagey hoped for a last-minute compromise between Waterloo College and the university. Ultimately, however, the university created its own Faculty of Arts in 1960. It later established the first Faculty of Mathematics in North America on 1 January 1967. In 1967, the world&#x27;s first department of kinesiology was created. The present legislative act which defines how the university should be governed, the &quot;University of Waterloo Act, 1972&quot; was passed on 10 May 1972.

A coat of arms has been in use by the university since 1961. The coat of arms was officially registered with the Lord Lyon King of Arms in 1987 and with the Canadian Heraldic Authority in 2001.

In February 1995, the former president of the university, James Downey, signed the Tri-University Group (TUG) agreement between Wilfrid Laurier University, and the University of Guelph. Signed in a period of fiscal constraint, and when ageing library systems required replacing, the TUG agreement sought to integrate the library collections and services of the three universities.

=== Twenty-first century ===
In 2001, the university announced it would develop the Waterloo Research and Technology Park in the north campus. The park was planned to house many of the high-tech industries in the area, and is supported by the university, the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, the provincial and federal governments, and Canada&#x27;s Technology Triangle. The aim was to provide businesses with access to the university&#x27;s faculty, co-operative education students, and alumni, as well as the university&#x27;s infrastructure and resources. Groundbreaking was on 25 June 2002, with the first completed building, the Sybase campus building, opening on 26 November 2004. In 2010, the Waterloo Research and Tech Park was renamed as the David Johnston Research and Technology Park, after David Johnston, the 28th Governor General of Canada and former president of the university.

From 2009 to 2012, the university managed four undergraduate programs in Dubai. The university worked in partnership with the Higher Colleges of Technology, the largest post-secondary institution in the United Arab Emirates. Discussions regarding the partnership emerged in 2004, and the Dubai campus was officially opened in September 2009. Through the partnership, the university offered undergraduate degrees in chemical engineering, civil engineering, financial analysis and risk management, and information technology management. The programs offered in Dubai took place in facilities provided by the Higher Colleges of Technology. On 30 October 2012, the university&#x27;s Board of Governors decided to close the university&#x27;s extension in Dubai.

One 29 June 2023, one professor and two students of UW were stabbed during a gender studies class. The perpetrator, a UW graduate, was charged with three counts of aggravated assault; four counts of assault with a weapon; two counts of possessing a weapon for a dangerous purpose; and mischief under $5,000. Investigators of the Waterloo Regional Police service believe it was a hate-motivated incident related to gender expression and gender identity. The perpetrator pleaded guilty to four counts on June 3, 2024: two counts of aggravated assault and one each of assault causing bodily harm and assault with a weapon.

== Campus ==

The university&#x27;s main campus lies within the city of Waterloo, Ontario. It sits on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishnaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples that is part of the Haldimand Tract, land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. It is bordered by Waterloo Park to the south, Wilfrid Laurier University to the southeast, residential neighbourhoods to the northeast, east and west, and the Laurel Creek Conservation Area to the northwest. Three numbered roads also intersect the main campus: University Avenue West, Columbia Street West, and Westmount Road North. While the main campus is , the majority of the teaching facilities are centred on a ring road in its southern portion.

The oldest building on campus is the Graduate House, originally a farmhouse dating back to the 19th century. The oldest building which was erected for the university is the Douglas Wright Engineering Building, which was erected in 1958. A large majority of the university&#x27;s buildings, and its ring road, were constructed during the 1960s. The university&#x27;s main campus is divided into three major areas: South Campus, North Campus and Northwest Campus. South Campus is the academic core of the university, while North Campus holds the Research and Technology Park. Northwest Campus is the least developed area of the main campus, made up primarily of farm fields and an environmental reserve, which divides it from North Campus.

In addition, the university owns several other properties in Cambridge, Huntsville, Kitchener, and Stratford, Ontario. The Ion rapid transit system provides a transit connection between the main campus, and several off-campus facilities, including the university&#x27;s start-up incubator program in Kitchener. 
=== Libraries and museums ===

The university has four libraries housing more than 1.4 million books, as well as electronic resources including e-books, serial titles, and databases. Three libraries are on campus: the Dana Porter Library, housing material relating to arts, humanities and social science, the Davis Centre Library, housing material for engineering, mathematics and science, and the Witer Learning Resource Centre, housing material for the School of Optometry and Vision Science. The fourth library, the Musagetes Architecture Library, is in Cambridge, alongside the university&#x27;s School of Architecture. The libraries of the university&#x27;s affiliated colleges are also considered a part of the university&#x27;s library system. Doris E. Lewis was the first University Librarian. The university&#x27;s library system is also a member of the TriUniversity Group, a partnership between the University of Guelph, the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University. The group provides students and researchers at all three universities with access to all of the collections and services. The group also operates the TUG Annex, a repository for less-used library resources from the three universities.

University of Waterloo also operates the Earth Sciences Museum, on campus in the Centre for Environmental Information Technology. It is mainly used as an earth-science teaching museum for local schools and natural-science interest groups in southern Ontario. The main exhibits cover the Great Lakes, rocks and minerals, dinosaurs and ice age mammals. The museum&#x27;s fossil exhibit includes a complete cast of an &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; and an authentic skeleton of a Cave bear. The museum also houses an interactive, simulation mining tunnel which aims to teach sustainable mining practices. Also owned and operated by the university is the Museum of Vision Science, which is at the university&#x27;s School of Optometry building. The university had previously operated the Elliott Avedon Museum and Archive of Games, created by the Department of Recreation and Leisure Studies and previously managed by the university&#x27;s Faculty of Applied Health Sciences. Due to a lack of specific academic interest, in 2009, the decision was made to close the museum and transfer the collection elsewhere.

=== Housing and student facilities ===

The university has eight student residences: the Minota Hagey Residence, UW Place, Village 1 (the university&#x27;s first residence), Ron Eydt Village, Mackenzie King Village, Columbia Lake North and South, and Claudette Millar Hall. In addition to the eight main campus residences, students may also apply to live at any of the university&#x27;s affiliated college residences. The first residence built was Village 1, completed in 1966. Ron Eydt Village was still known as Village 2 in 1995 but had been renamed by 2000. The largest residential village at the university is UW Place, which houses 1,300 first-year students and 350 upper-year students, while the smallest residence is the Minota Hagey Residence, which houses 70 students and is almost exclusively for upper-year students. In September 2010, 24.9 percent of the undergraduate population lived on campus, including 71.1 percent of first-year students. Residents are represented by two residential councils at the university, South Council which represents the students at UW Place, and North Council which represents the remaining residential villages. Each council organizes their own events and has their own executive, budget, and meetings. However, the overall mission of both councils is to act as the official representatives for all residents living at the university&#x27;s residences.

The Student Life Centre is the centre of student governance and student directed social, cultural, entertainment and recreational activities, open seven days a week, year-round. The Student Life Centre contains the offices of a number of student organizations, including the Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA), Student Housing Office, a number of retail and food services, and a variety of club space and study rooms. In 2017 ground broke on a joint 63,000 square foot expansion of the Student Life Centre and Physical Activities Complex. Built to the west of Burt Matthews Hall Green the expansion will connect all three floors with the Red North corner of the PAC providing social, fitness, study, multi-faith, dining, and bookable spaces for students. The project was initially projected to complete in Fall 2018; although has not been completed as of 2021.

The WUSA also operates an information desk in the Student Life Centre called the Turnkey Desk. It is open 24/7 365, and it is where students go to book out study spaces within the SLC, as well as where they go for information on campus events, directions, and any questions students have. The Turnkey Desk also sells a variety of tickets including GO Transit tickets and various local transit tickets and movie theatre tickets. It is staffed almost entirely by university students or recent graduates, and is a salaried job on the campus.

The idea for a student centre emerged during the 1960s, and to raise the necessary funds for the building students began to levy a $10 fee. Construction began in July 1966 and was completed in 1968. Tensions between the university and the student community surfaced over the management and ownership of the Student Life Centre. The conflict was not resolved until 1969, when Professor Johnson resigned his position as chairman of the Campus Centre Board, along with his colleague Pim Fitzgerald.

=== Off-campus facilities ===

The university has several satellite campuses and facilities throughout Southern Ontario. The closest off-campus facilities are adjacent to the campus, with the university acquiring land and five buildings from BlackBerry Ltd in December 2013. As of February 2014, the university uses three of the buildings, and leases the other two to BlackBerry Ltd.

The Centre for Extended Learning in Kitchener, Ontario is a facility owned and managed by the university. The centre provides pre-university courses, part-time studies, online learning and professional development courses. In addition to the Centre for Extended Learning, Kitchener also holds the university&#x27;s School of Pharmacy. The pharmacy building was designed by Siamak Hariri, and was completed in December 2008. While the School of Pharmacy acts as the anchor institution of this campus, other students and faculty of the university&#x27;s Faculty of Applied Health Sciences also use the facilities. The campus includes a primary care teaching clinic which will integrate clinical care and teaching in pharmacy and optometry. Two other universities also make use of the Health Science and Pharmacy campus. McMaster University&#x27;s medical school makes use of the campus as its base for its Waterloo Regional Campus, with 56 of the medical school&#x27;s students admitted at the regional campus in 2012. Wilfrid Laurier University&#x27;s School of Social Work also uses some of the facilities available on the campus.

The university also operates the Stratford School of Interaction Design and Business in Stratford, Ontario. The focus for the Stratford campus is on education in digital arts and media. The idea for the Stratford campus first took shape when the City of Stratford and the university signed a memorandum in October 2006. It officially opened in September 2010. In November 2009, the university also signed a memorandum of understanding with the University of Western Ontario regarding academic initiatives at the Stratford Campus. The campus also hosted the first four Canada 3.0 forums, before its move to Toronto in 2012.

The university&#x27;s School of Architecture uses a campus in Cambridge, Ontario, on the west bank of the Grand River. The architecture campus was the idea of the Cambridge Consortium, a group of Cambridge business owners, who spearheaded the school&#x27;s fundraising drive to cover a portion of the $27 million cost of creating the new campus. The school, along with its faculty and students, was moved to the new campus in September 2004. Since 1979, the School of Architecture has also operated an architecture studio in Rome, Italy in the Trastevere neighbourhood. The opportunity to work at the Trastevere studio is offered to fourth-year architecture students.

Another facility which is owned and managed by the university is the Waterloo Summit Centre for the Environment, in Huntsville, Ontario. It is a year-round research and teaching centre, which regularly hosts post-secondary student field courses and professional development programs, and also serves as a university outreach facility for the whole region. Close to Algonquin and Arrowhead Provincial Park, the centre&#x27;s facilities are used for research in ecological restoration and conservation.

=== Sustainability ===
Sustainability initiatives are divided between several departmental offices at the university, with the university&#x27;s plant operations charged with their implementation. Prior to 2005, the management of sustainability efforts was conducted by the university&#x27;s waste management coordinator. The university&#x27;s sustainability initiatives are solely institution-specific, as it has not signed any national or international sustainability declaration. However, the university, along with the other members from the Council of Ontario Universities, signed a pledge in 2009 known as &quot;Ontario Universities Committed to a Greener World&quot;, with the objective of transforming its campus into a model of environmental responsibility.

The university&#x27;s School of Environment, Enterprise and Development placed first in Canada in the Corporate Knights 2011 ranking for undergraduate business programs incorporating sustainability. The university campus received a C+ grade from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card for 2011. In 2021, the University of Waterloo was ranked 99th in the world, and 15th in Canada in &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; University Impact Rankings, a ranking that evaluated 1,115 universities from 94 countries/regions against the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. A dramatic drop from 2020&#x27;s ranking of 16th in the world.

Waterloo&#x27;s Institute for Nanotechnology is Canada&#x27;s largest nanotechnology institute committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

== Administration ==
The university operates under a bicameral system of a board of governors and a senate, as legislated by the University of Waterloo Act, 1972. The Board of Governors has responsibility for the university&#x27;s properties, affairs, and income. The University of Waterloo Act calls for only 36 members, each of whom must hold Canadian citizenship. However, the number of members in the board for the 2013–2014 academic year is 40. The Board has five &quot;ex officio&quot; members, including the university&#x27;s chancellor and president, and the mayors of Kitchener and Waterloo. The other 32 members of the board are either elected or appointed by the various members of the university community, including alumni, faculty, and student body.

The senate establishes the educational policies of the university and makes recommendations to the board of governors in the management of the institution. The senate has 24 &quot;ex officio&quot; positions, including the university&#x27;s president and chancellor, the vice-presidents, the senior dean of each faculty, the presidents of the undergraduate, graduate, and faculty associations, and the presidents and principals of the university&#x27;s associated colleges. The senate&#x27;s 61 other members are appointed or elected by various communities of the university including the faculty of the university, its associated colleges, the student body, and alumni.

The president, appointed by the board of governors, acts as the university&#x27;s chief executive officer with the senate&#x27;s approval, administers the affairs of the university, and acts on behalf of the board with respect to the operational management and control of the university. The president is the chair of the senate and a member of the board. The president also holds the position of vice-chancellor, assuming the duties of the chancellor during his absences or a temporary vacancy in the office. The chancellor is elected by the members of the senate for a three-year term, although eligible for renewal. The chancellor&#x27;s primary duty is to preside at all convocations and present candidates for honorary degrees to the senate. Jagdeep Singh Bachher has been the chancellor since 1 July 2024. He succeeded Dominic Barton, who held the position since 27 October 2018. In March 2011, Feridun Hamdullahpur was announced as the sixth president of the university, having been interim president since October 2010.

On November 17, 2020, Vivek Goel was announced as the seventh president of the university. His five-year term began on July 1, 2021.

=== Affiliated institutions ===

The university also includes three semi-autonomous affiliated colleges and a federated university. Conrad Grebel University College is a Mennonite university college that was chartered in 1961 and is religiously affiliated with the Mennonite Church Eastern Canada. Renison University College is an Anglican university college chartered in 1959; it entered an affiliation with the University of Waterloo in 1960 and is religiously affiliated with the Anglican Church of Canada. St. Jerome&#x27;s University is a Roman Catholic university, founded in 1865, which entered into a federation with the University of Waterloo shortly after the provincial government granted it university status in 1959. United College is a university college founded by members of the United Church of Canada in 1962. However, United now operates independently from the United Church, without any formal or legal relationship.

The three colleges and federated university are all within the University of Waterloo&#x27;s main campus and operate their own residences. Students of these affiliated colleges and federated university are also academically integrated with the University of Waterloo. Students who study at any of them are also considered registered students of the University of Waterloo; with students from the federated universities able to enrol in classes and faculties, and graduate as a student from the University of Waterloo. Regardless of the affiliated colleges and federated university&#x27;s religious affiliations, enrolment is not restricted based on the student&#x27;s religious beliefs.

=== Finances ===
The university completed the 2014–2015 academic year with revenues of $936.240 million and expenses of $906.730 million, yielding a surplus of $29.510 million. Grants and contracts make up the largest source of revenue for the university, totaling $392.357 million, followed by academic fees at $357.889 million. Salaries make up nearly half of the university&#x27;s expenses, at $439.973 million. As of 30 April 2015, the university&#x27;s endowment is valued at $335.731 million.

== Academics ==
Waterloo is a publicly funded research university, and a member of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. It functions on a term-based system, with fall, winter and spring terms. Undergraduate programs comprise the majority of the school&#x27;s enrolment, made up of 24,377 full-time and part-time undergraduate students. The university conferred 5,741 bachelor&#x27;s degrees and first professional degrees, 1,605 master&#x27;s degrees, 332 doctoral degrees, during the 2016–2017 academic school year. The university is organized into six faculties, which operate a combined total of thirteen schools and over fifty academic departments.
Financial aid available to students includes the Ontario Student Assistance Program and Canada Student Loans and Grants through the federal and provincial governments. The financial aid provided may come in the form of loans, grants, bursaries, scholarships, fellowships, debt reduction, interest relief, and work programs.

The university has also partnered with other institutions for the purposes of jointly operating a graduate program. The Balsillie School of International Affairs (BSIA) is a graduate school and research centre operated in partnership with the Centre for International Governance Innovation and Wilfrid Laurier University. The Perimeter&#x27;s Scholar International program is another graduate program operated in partnership with the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, in which its graduates receive a Master of Science from the University of Waterloo. The university also offers its students the opportunity to earn credits towards their degree while studying abroad through student exchange and international internship programs. The university has exchange agreements with over 100 institutions outside Canada.

=== Co-operative education ===
The university operates the largest post-secondary co-operative education (co-op) program in the world with over 20,000 undergraduate students. For co-op students, each term acts as either a study term or a work term depending on their co-op sequencing, typically for the entire length of their degree. Co-op work terms are mandatory for all undergraduate engineering programs, as well as several arts and mathematics programs. Engineering students are required to complete five out their six scheduled work terms to graduate from their program, while students from other faculties typically need to complete four work terms. Engineering students alternate between school and work terms, completing a total of eight study terms and six work terms in the span of four and two-thirds years. However, some programs have unique co-op streams where consecutive school and work terms are scheduled near the end of the program, giving the students the opportunity to apply for eight-month positions.

Students are responsible for securing their work placement for each of their co-op terms. This includes applying for positions and attending interviews during their study terms. Scheduling conflicts between interviews and exams are actively avoided but still possible, in which case one or the other are rescheduled, with the examination taking precedence. In order for the student to receive their co-op credit, their work term must meet a number of conditions. This includes being full-time, that it is related to the student&#x27;s field of study, that it lasts for the full 16-week duration, and that it is compensated with at least the minimum wage in the location of work. Exceptions can be made for some of these conditions; for example, first work terms often do not have to be related to the student&#x27;s field of study, especially if the student has had difficulty securing a position.

At the end of the work term, the employer submits a performance evaluation for the student which is presented to the student&#x27;s future employers during their next application stage. the university reports that its co-op students earn an average of per work term when working in Canada. However, co-op earnings vary greatly depending on field of study, how many work terms the student has already completed, and where the work term takes place. The university&#x27;s highest earning undergraduate co-op students in 2018 were mathematics undergraduates (including computer science and computing and financial management) on their sixth work term and were working in the United States, who made an average of US$28,600 (C$38,000) per four-month work term. Several programs where co-op is mandatory report high levels of employment from their graduation, with 98 percent of graduates from the Accounting and Financial Management, Math/CPA, Biotech/CPA, and Master of Accounting programs reporting that they found employment within six months after graduating. In the same year, the graduates of the university&#x27;s Master of Taxation co-op program reported that 100 percent of its students secured full-time employment prior to graduating.

The William M. Tatham Centre is the home of the Centre for Career Action office, where resources such as resume critiques, mock interviews, and networking advice are available.

WaterlooWorks is the university&#x27;s official job board, on which over 7000 employers post available positions. Most positions on WaterlooWorks are in Canada, although international job listings from employers based in the United States, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and other countries have also been placed on WaterlooWorks. The United States is the most common destination for international work terms. In addition to using WaterlooWorks, students may pursue their own external job search, or found their own company, to receive their co-op credit.

=== Rankings and reputation ===
The 2024 QS World University Rankings ranked the university 115th in the world and fifth in Canada.

In 2014, a study from Riviera Partners found that the University of Waterloo had the third-most hired undergraduate candidates in Silicon Valley. In 2016, Startup Compass found that University of Waterloo alumni were the second-most frequently hired in small and medium-sized companies in Silicon Valley. Dr. Steven Woods, engineering director at Google in Canada, said in 2013 that &quot;the University of Waterloo is one of Google&#x27;s largest three or four recruiting universities year-over-year [worldwide], along with MIT and Carnegie Mellon.&quot; In 2014, &quot;Business Insider&quot; found via LinkedIn data that the University of Waterloo has the fourth-most alumni working at Facebook, and the third-most alumni working at Amazon.

=== Research ===

The University of Waterloo is a member of the U15, a group that represents 15 Canadian research universities. In 2018, Research Infosource ranked Waterloo 12th on their list of top 50 Canadian research universities, with a sponsored research income (external sources of funding) of $189.333 million in 2017. In the same year, the university&#x27;s faculty averaged a sponsored research income of $163,100, while graduate students averaged a sponsored research income of $34,700. Research funds comes from private, and public sources. In 2019, the university has received over C$15 million in research funding from Huawei.

Waterloo&#x27;s research performance has been noted several bibliometric university rankings, which uses citation analysis to evaluates the impact a university has on academic publications. In 2019, the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities ranked Waterloo 242nd in the world, and 10th in Canada. The University Ranking by Academic Performance 2018–19 rankings placed the university 191st in the world, and 10th in Canada.The university operates and manages 41 research centres and institutes, including the Centre for Applied Cryptographic Research, the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, the Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing, the Institute for Quantum Computing, and the Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience. Official recognition and designation of all centres and institutes requires the approval of the university&#x27;s Senate. On 6 April 2018, the University of Waterloo announced the launching of its Artificial Intelligence Institute.

The university has undertaken several research partnerships with other institutions. In 2007, the Balsillie School of International Affairs (BSIA) was established as a graduate school and research centre in partnership with the University of Waterloo. BSIA operates three research centres relating to public governance and public policy. In 2016, Facebook hardware development division announced a partnership with Waterloo, along with 16 other post-secondary institutions, as Facebook explores new revenue streams in virtual reality, cybersecurity, and other areas of research. In 2019, Microsoft announced a partnership with Waterloo&#x27;s Artificial Intelligence Institute worth $115 million over five years as part of Microsoft&#x27;s broader AI For Good Initiative. Waterloo&#x27;s Artificial Intelligence Institute is an interdisciplinary initiative involving the researchers from faculties of arts, engineering, mathematics, and computer science.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers at the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology worked in collaboration with SiO2 Innovation Labs to develop a coating that kills the virus upon impact. The antiviral coating could be applied to all personal protective equipment and high-touch surfaces. This research was supported by both the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and Mitacs. The school also received a $499,935 grant from the Public Health Agency of Canada&#x27;s Immunization Partnership Fund to engage health care professionals and community leaders to combat COVID-19 misinformation and increase acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.

=== Admission ===
The requirements for admission differ between students from Ontario, students from other provinces in Canada, and international students, due to the lack of uniformity in marking schemes. The minimum averages required for these programs are determined each year based on the number and qualification of applicants and the number of available spaces. As of 2021, the secondary school average for first year, full-time students at the University of Waterloo was at 92.7 percent. In 2023, 65 percent of new students at Waterloo had a high school average equal to or greater than 90 percent, and 33.2 percent had an average equal to or greater than 95 percent. However, this proportion varies greatly between programs at the university.

In the case of admission into the Engineering and Math faculties, there is a large weighting given to the applicant&#x27;s supplementary application, extracurricular involvement, adjustment factors for individual high schools, and an admissions video interview. Thus, it is possible to receive an offer with an average much lower than the mean admission average. The retention rate of the university&#x27;s first-time, full-time first-year students in 2022 was 93.6 percent.
== Student life ==
=== Organizations ===
The university&#x27;s two main student unions are the Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA) for undergraduate students, and the Graduate Student Association (GSA) for graduate students. Founded in 1967 as the Federation of Students, WUSA operates four businesses, twelve student services, oversees over 200 accredited student clubs; in addition to operating other student programs and events. Among the WUSA student groups is the Glow Centre for Sexual and Gender Diversity, Canada&#x27;s oldest, continually running university-based 2SLGBTQ+ group.

Each of the university&#x27;s faculties has a student society which represent and provide services for the students in their respective faculties. Services include online exam banks, resume critiques, and technical skills workshops. Some student societies also operate a student deal discount program and one to two shops selling coffee and food at low prices. Each faculty also operates a student-run endowment fund, which fund student design teams, laboratory upgrades, and services for their respective student societies.

=== Greek Life ===
As of January 2015, neither the university administration nor the two main student unions recognize fraternities or sororities. Fraternities and Sororities at the University of Waterloo, though not formally sanctioned by the institution, constitute a facet of campus life. This Greek life community receives promotional support from the UWaterloo Greek Council, a club within the Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA).

The University of Waterloo is home to the first collegiate fraternity and Greek life organization in the Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge region, Sigma Chi, whose University of Waterloo&#x27;s Theta Psi chapter has been active since 1987. Sigma Chi, Zeta Psi, and Alpha Epsilon Pi operate as non-accredited off-campus fraternities, while Kappa Kappa Gamma, Delta Phi Nu, Alpha Omicron Pi and Sigma Lambda Gamma operate as non-accredited off-campus sororities.

=== Journalism ===
The three main student publications on campus are &quot;Imprint&quot;, the university&#x27;s official student newspaper, &quot;mathNEWS&quot;, the Math Society&#x27;s free-form publication, and &quot;The Iron Warrior&quot;, the Engineering Society&#x27;s newspaper. &quot;Imprint&quot; replaced &quot;The Chevron&quot; as the official student newspaper in 1979, and publishes a monthly print magazine along with regular online content. &quot;mathNEWS&quot; and &quot;The Iron Warrior&quot; publish biweekly in print and online throughout the year.

The university formerly included a student-funded campus radio station, CKMS-FM. The student union withdrew financial support for the stations&#x27; operations in 2008 following several referendums, and CKMS transitioned to a community radio model.

====mathNEWS====
&quot;mathNEWS&quot; is the freeform student publication of the undergraduate mathematics students of the University of Waterloo as represented by MathSoc (the Mathematics Society of the University of Waterloo). Labeling itself as &quot;Waterloo&#x27;s Bastion of Erudite Thought&quot;, mathNEWS is published biweekly, with occasional deviations and special editions. The paper is varied in its content, with think pieces, local updates, and exercises in creative writing, usually through a humorous lens. Though it has a cult following, the paper gained worldwide attention in February 2024 after publishing an article exposing the usage of facial recognition in on-campus vending machines.

&quot;mathNEWS&quot; has been in publication since January 25, 1973, when it was published on a weekly basis, and was technically a club under MathSoc. On February 14, 1975, it switched to a biweekly publication schedule, which it maintains as of April 1, 2024.

On February 16, 2024, mathNEWS published an article titled &quot;THE M&amp;M’S MACHINES ARE WATCHING YOU&quot;, written by regular contributor River Stanley under the pseudonym molasses. The article discussed a Reddit post by user u/SquidKid47, who had discovered a system malfunction for an app titled &quot;Invenda.Vending.FacialRecognitionApp.exe&quot; on the on-campus Invenda vending machines selling Mars Inc products. The article was picked up by multiple well known publications, such as Business Insider, CBC, The Guardian, The Verge, and WIRED. In March 2024, the university removed the 29 vending machines on campus.

=== Athletics ===
The university&#x27;s sports teams are known as the Waterloo Warriors. They participate in the Canadian Interuniversity Sports&#x27; Ontario University Athletics conference for most varsity sports. Varsity teams include badminton, baseball, basketball, cross country, curling, field hockey, figure skating, Canadian football, golf, hockey, Nordic skiing, rugby, soccer, squash, swimming, track and field, tennis and volleyball. The athletics program at the university dates back to 1957, when students of Waterloo College Associate Faculties participated in the sports program of Waterloo College. The university had its own independent team when the Associate Faculties officially became the University of Waterloo. The university&#x27;s varsity teams and the university&#x27;s recreational sports programs are operated and managed by the Department of Athletics and Recreational Activity.

The university has a number of athletic facilities open to varsity teams and other students. Seating 5,400 people, Warrior Field is the university&#x27;s largest stadium by seating capacity; and is used as the home field for the varsity field hockey and football teams, and hosts the university&#x27;s recreational flag football and soccer activities. Prior to the completion of Warrior Field in 2008, the university&#x27;s varsity teams used Seagram Stadium as their home stadium. Seagram Stadium was built by the university&#x27;s predecessor, Waterloo College Associate Faculties, and remained under the ownership of the university until 1974, when it was sold to the City of Waterloo. However, the university continued to use Seagram Stadium until 2008.

Other facilities include the Physical Activity Complex, which houses two gymnasiums, beach volleyball courts, squash rooms, and a swimming pool, and is also home to the university&#x27;s varsity badminton, basketball, squash, swimming and volleyball teams. The Columbia Ice Field was constructed in 1983 and houses the university&#x27;s hockey team home rink, with a seating capacity of 700. The Ice Field has been expanded twice, in 1990 and 2003, and now includes three gyms and a number of fitness centres. Including the football field, the university manages seven outdoor playing fields, with Fields 1 and 2 reserved for the varsity soccer and rugby teams, while portions of Field 3 are used as a baseball field. The rest of the fields are used by the university&#x27;s recreational sports programs.

=== Entrepreneurship ===
The University of Waterloo operates a startup incubator for its students, faculty, and alumni called the Velocity program. With no fees or equity, it is the largest free startup incubator in the world. It offers office space for up to 120 startup companies, as well as a wet laboratory, assembly space, workshop, and prototyping lab. The program also provides business mentorship to its resident companies and to Waterloo students as well as partnerships with researchers at the university&#x27;s main campus. Velocity provides some students and startups with grants, previously valued from C$5,000 to C$25,000. As of 2019, the $25,000 grant was removed and companies in Velocity may now pitch their ideas to instead receive C$50,000 in funding, with equity stakes from investors. Companies that emerged from the Velocity program include Maluuba.

In addition to the resources provided by Velocity, alumni regularly receive funding for their startups from United States accelerators. Companies Waterloo alumni have founded with the aid of Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator include Pebble and Bufferbox. Y Combinator founder Paul Graham and president Sam Altman have both noted the University of Waterloo has stood out to them more than any other school during Y Combinator applications.

In 2017, &quot;Pitchbook Data&quot; ranked the University of Waterloo&#x27;s undergraduate program fourth for schools that have the greatest number of alumni who have founded unicorn startups. As of the same year, Waterloo students and alumni have raised a cumulative US$3.662 billion in venture capital. The current unicorn startups from Waterloo are Wish, Instacart, Kik Messenger, Pivotal Software, and Storm8.

=== Traditions ===
Some traditions at the University of Waterloo include the University of Waterloo Aphrodite Project, an annual student-run matchmaking event where thousands of students complete a psychology questionnaire and get matched with their most ideal date on campus.

The University of Waterloo&#x27;s coat of arms has been used as a symbol of the institution since 1961, with the coat of arms also being used in the logo of the university, and its academic faculties and departments. The university&#x27;s colours are black, gold, and white, and may be found on the university&#x27;s coat of arms.

The school also maintains official colours to represent the academic faculties of the university. Other objects have also been used to represent the faculties of the university. Mathematics students have used pink ties to represent their faculty since 1968, when a pink tie was placed on the exterior of the Mathematics &amp; Computer Building during the building&#x27;s opening. A copy of the statue of &quot;Porcellino&quot; at the university&#x27;s Modern Languages Building is also used as a mascot for the Faculty of Arts. The statue was donated to the university in 1978, and was placed at the Modern Languages Building.

=== Coat of arms ===
The university&#x27;s coat of arms was first used by the university in October 1961, but was only officially granted by the Lord Lyon King of Arms in August 1987. It was not registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority until 15 February 2001. Four variations of the coat of arms existed. The first was used from 1961 to 1996, when the second bright-yellow shield using slightly different shaped lions was introduced. The yellow background was dulled in 2000, and finally, the original lions were reintroduced in 2010 in conjunction with the attempt to replace the use of the coat of arms with a futuristic &quot;W&quot; logo. The new logo was eventually rejected after student opposition.

The red-on-gold lions on the university&#x27;s arms were adopted from those of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, who defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. The City of Waterloo was named after an area just south of Brussels, Belgium, where the battle occurred. The chevron on the arms was taken from the arms of Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener, Field Marshal with the British Army during World War I. The black and white pattern used on the chevron was based on the colours of Prussia, as homage to the German heritage of the area. The City of Kitchener was originally known as Berlin, but was renamed after Earl Kitchener in 1916 during World War I.

=== Motto and songs ===
The university&#x27;s Latin motto is &quot;Concordia cum veritate&quot;, translated as &quot;In Harmony with Truth&quot;. It was introduced along with the university coat of arms in October 1961.
A number of songs are commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement, convocation, and athletic contests. The main song of the university is known as the &quot;Black and White and Gold&quot;. The words were written by K. D. Fryer and H. F. Davis, while the music was composed by Alfred Kunz.

== Notable alumni and faculty ==
Over 221,000 people have graduated from the university, and now reside in over 150 countries. Waterloo graduates have accumulated a number of awards, such as George Elliott Clarke, recipient of the Governor General&#x27;s Award; William Reeves, recipient of an Academy Award, and a number of Rhodes Scholarships. Two members of the university have received the Nobel Prize. In 1999, Robert Mundell was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his work in monetary dynamics and optimum currency areas. In 2018, university faculty member Donna Strickland was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for her work in laser physics. Other notable awards and positions bestowed on people affiliated with the university includes two Canada Excellence Research Chair laureates, five Killam Prize winners, 74 Canada Research Chairs, and 83 Fellows to the Royal Society of Canada.

A number of business leaders have worked or studied at Waterloo. Examples include David I. McKay, president and CEO of the Royal Bank of Canada, Kevin O’Leary, founder of SoftKey, John Baker, founder of Desire2Learn, David Cheriton, co-founder and chief scientist of Arista Networks, Mike Lazaridis, co-founder and former co-CEO of Research in Motion (now BlackBerry Ltd), Prem Watsa, chairman of Fairfax Financial and a former chancellor of the university, Steven Woods, co-founder of NeoEdge Networks and Quack.com and co-founders of Waterloo Maple, Keith Geddes and Gaston Gonnet. Gonnet was also the co-founder of OpenText Corporation. Several faculty members and students have also gained local and national prominence in government. David Johnston, the former president of Waterloo, served as the 28th Governor General of Canada from 2010 to 2017.

A number of the university&#x27;s faculty and students have also gained prominence in the field of computing sciences. Examples include QNX operating systems co-creators Gordon Bell and Dan Dodge, Rasmus Lerdorf, the creator of the PHP scripting language, Matei Zaharia, the creator of Apache Spark, Gordon Cormack, the co-creator of the Dynamic Markov compression algorithm, Ric Holt, co-creator of several programming languages, most notably Turing, Jack Edmonds, a computer scientist, and developer of the Blossom algorithm, and the Edmonds&#x27; algorithm, Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, and William Thomas Tutte, a World War II codebreaker who cracked the Nazi high command&#x27;s Lorenz Cypher.

Graduates from the university have also risen to prominence in other fields. Heather Moyse, a graduate from the kinesiology program, is a prominent Canadian athlete and two-time Olympic bobsleigh gold medalist. Moyse has represented Canada in international bobsleigh, rugby and track cycling competitions. Graduate of the Rhetoric and Professional Writing program, Rupi Kaur is a Canadian poet, writer, illustrator. Her book of poetry, Milk and Honey, has spent over a year on &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; bestsellers list, reaching No. 1 in January 2017. George Elliott Clarke, who served as the Poet Laureate of Toronto from 2012 to 2015 and as the 2016–2017 Canadian Parliamentary Poet Laureate, graduated with an English degree.

On 2 October 2018, Donna Strickland, an associate professor at the Physics and Astronomy Department, was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics. Strickland is the third woman to have ever been awarded the prize in physics. This was the first Nobel prize for a member of the university&#x27;s faculty. Strickland was honoured for being half of the team to discover chirped pulse amplification, a technique that underpins today&#x27;s short-pulse, high-intensity lasers. &quot;Scientific American&quot; explained the practical aspects of the invention as it applies in the most noteworthy application: it allows for &quot;ultrabrief, ultrasharp beams can be used to make extremely precise cuts, so their technique is now used in laser machining and enables doctors to perform millions of corrective&quot; laser eye surgeries.

<text>The Island of Montreal (, ) is an island in southwestern Quebec, Canada, which is the site of a number of municipalities, including most of the city of Montreal, and is the most populous island in Canada. It is the main island of the Hochelaga Archipelago at the confluence of the Saint Lawrence and Ottawa rivers.

== Name ==

The first French name for the island was &quot;l&#x27;ille de Vilmenon&quot;, noted by Samuel de Champlain in a 1616 map, and derived from the sieur de Vilmenon, a patron of the founders of Quebec at the court of Louis XIII. However, by 1632 Champlain referred to the &quot;Isle de Mont-real&quot; in another map. The island derived its name from Mount Royal (French &quot;Mont Royal&quot;, then pronounced ), and gradually spread its name to the town, which had originally been called Ville-Marie.

In Kanien’kéha, the island is called Tiohtià:ke tsi ionhwéntsare (&#x27;broken in two&#x27;, referring to the Lachine Rapids to the island&#x27;s southwest) or Otsirà:ke (meaning &#x27;on the fire&#x27;). In Anishninaabemowin, the land is called Mooniyaang, named for the first stop in the great Anishinaabe migration from Dawnland (the Maritimes) to the Great Lakes.

==Physical geography==
The island is approximately long and wide at its widest point, and has a shoreline of . It is the second largest island in the Saint Lawrence River, after Anticosti Island in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The Island of Montreal is the largest island in the Hochelaga Archipelago, which is formed by the confluence of the Ottawa and St. Lawrence rivers.
Near the Ottawa shore at the western end of island, the Ottawa River widens into Lac des Deux-Montagnes. A natural watercourse there, between the island and Île Perrot, has been improved by the island&#x27;s Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue Canal. These waterways, connecting Lac des Deux-Montagnes with Lake Saint-Louis, constitute one of the places where the Ottawa flows into the St. Lawrence.

North of the island&#x27;s western end, Lac des Deux-Montagnes flows into Rivière des Prairies, still part of the Ottawa. The Prairies separates the island from the other major part of the Hochelaga Archipelago including Île Bizard and Île Jésus. After coursing about , the Prairie, at the northeastern tip of the island, joins the St. Lawrence.

The St. Lawrence coast of the island faces a variable waterway. In the southwest, the St. Lawrence River widens into Lake Saint-Louis as it approaches the island. Around a southern point near the center of the island, the St. Lawrence narrows into the Lachine Rapids, then widens into the Bassin de La Prairie past that southern point, and narrows again at the Montreal neighborhood of Cite Du Havre before flowing towards Quebec City and the Atlantic Ocean. The Lachine Canal on the island bypasses this complex part of the river. Neighboring islands in the St. Lawrence include Saint Helen&#x27;s Island, Notre Dame Island, and Nuns&#x27; Island.
The topography of the island has been significantly altered by human activity, as evidenced by historical maps that name a lake St. Pierre in the island. This lake, and several other watercourses, have been drained or covered over as the city developed, while areas on the island&#x27;s shores have been reclaimed and extended. The southwest of the island is separated by the Lachine Canal between Lachine and Montreal&#x27;s Old Port; this portion of the island is partially divided further by the Canal de l&#x27;Aqueduc, running roughly parallel to the Lachine Canal, beginning in the borough of LaSalle and continuing between the boroughs of Le Sud-Ouest and Verdun.

Most of the bedrock of the island consists of Chazy limestone, with some Utica shale. At the centre of the island stand the three peaks of Mount Royal, a volcanic intrusion (not an extinct volcano, contrary to popular belief). This short mountain (elevation is a member of, and gives its name to, the Monteregian Hills.

==Human geography==
The island of Montreal is the major component of the territory of the city of Montreal, along with Île Bizard, Saint Helen&#x27;s Island, Notre Dame Island, Nuns&#x27; Island, and some 69 smaller islands. With a population of 2,014,221 inhabitants (22% of the population of Québec), it is by far the most populous island in Canada. It is also the 6th most populous island of the Americas and the 37th most populated island on Earth. In addition, it is the world&#x27;s most populous island surrounded by fresh water. Montreal and the other municipalities on the island compose the administrative region of Montréal. The area of the Urban agglomeration of Montreal, which includes the Island of Montreal and several other smaller islands, is .).

The crossings which connect the island to its surroundings are some of the busiest bridges in the country and the world. The Champlain Bridge and the Jacques Cartier Bridge together accommodate 101 million vehicle crossings a year.

== Transportation ==

The island of Montreal is a hub for the Québec autoroute system, and is served by Québec autoroutes A-10 (known as the Bonaventure Expressway on the island of Montreal), A-15 (aka the Decarie Expressway south of the A-40 and the Laurentian autoroute to the north of it), A-13 (aka autoroute Chomedey), A-20, A-25, A-40 (part of the Trans-Canada Highway system, and known as &quot;The Metropolitan&quot; or simply &quot;The Met&quot; in its elevated mid-town section), A-520, and R-136 (aka the Ville-Marie autoroute). Many of these autoroutes are frequently congested at rush hour. However, in recent years, the government has acknowledged this problem and is working on long-term solutions to alleviate the congestion. One such example is the extension of Quebec Autoroute 30 on Montreal&#x27;s south shore, which will serve as a bypass. Today&#x27;s existing highways have been planned in the 1960s as part of a grid like transport system.

Notably, turning right on red on the island is prohibited, and signage at entry points to the island indicates as such.

<text>Post-surrealism is a movement that arose in Southern California in 1934 when Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson wrote a manifesto explaining their desire to use art to convey the relationship between the perceptual and the conceptual.

Sometimes this term is used to refer to art movement related to or influenced by surrealism, which occurred after a so-called period of &quot;historical surrealism&quot;. According to an article on the website &quot;acearchive.org&quot;, some surrealists have claimed that the term is unnecessary, because surrealism continues to the present day.
Modern-day surrealist activity is sometimes called &quot;post surrealism&quot; by advocates of the idea that surrealism is &quot;dead&quot;.

==History==
Both Lundeberg and Feitelson participated in a showing of art for the Los Angeles Art Association on Wilshire Boulevard in 1954. Along with Stephen Longstreet and Elise Cavanna, the artists whose paintings were presented were known collectively as &quot;Functionists West&quot;. Feitelson and Cavanna showed only non-objective works. Both artists employed flat-colored and near geometrical shapes.

Post-Surrealism was an American spin on the European-born art movement of the 20th Century. Beginning in the 1930s, artists searched for a style that would differentiate themselves from the dreamlike surrealism of Europe and more sub-conscious, earlier movements of Romanticism and Modernism. This new form of &quot;Americana Dream&quot; art began in Los Angeles, California. The cities&#x27; fanciful, other-worldly architecture and extravagant city-scape provided ample inspiration for burgeoning artists. Other cities such as San Francisco, New York, and Dallas became hotbeds for these creators.

While exhibiting in California in 1934, Lorser Feitelson and Helen Lundberg displayed their work under the name post-surrealism. For the first time, artists were able to separate themselves through their own name, and even formed a Surrealism group which boasted such great artists as Philip Guston, Reuben Kadish, Knud Merrild, and Grace Clements.

As a social movement as well as art, the works being created at this time reflected the prevalent issues throughout the country. Undoubtedly, the war was a major factor in the surrealism movement. Although the works which focused on these events were surrealist, they are now classified as Social-surrealism. Dalí influenced many social surrealists, including O. Louis Guglielmi, James Guy, Walter Quirt and David Smith, whose techniques can be seen in all of the aforementioned artists&#x27; works.

<text>Steve Cokely (June 17, 1952 – April 11, 2012) was an American political researcher and lecturer who lectured nationally on political and economic issues, especially to the Black American community.

==Overview==
Cokely lectured at many college campuses nationally, and was also known for his conspiracy theories involving a Black Male elite organization known as the Sigma Pi Phi and, along with Mauricelm-Lei Millere, the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. by the hands of Rev. Jesse Jackson and the CIA.

==Chicago and anti-semitism charges==
Cokely was assistant to the special committee on rules under Chicago Mayor Harold Washington. He gained notoriety when he served as special assistant to Eugene Sawyer, who became mayor after Washington&#x27;s death in 1987.

Cokely was criticized for teaching that Jewish doctors were using the AIDS virus in an attempted genocide against Africans. His comments created a nationally publicized controversy in 1988, and he was dismissed from his position as aide to Sawyer.

When, in 1990, Illinois Governor James Thompson signed an agreement to open an Israeli Aircraft Industries plant in Rockford, Cokely was an outspoken opponent. He argued that Black leaders in Illinois should oppose Israeli war industries because of their military support for the apartheid system in South Africa.

==&quot;Our Roots Run Deep&quot; appearance==
Cokely gained the national spotlight again in 1996 after he was scheduled to speak at &quot;Our Roots Run Deep&quot;, a Black History Month lecture series in New York City hosted by the Warner Music Group. Also scheduled were Al Sharpton, Jimmy Castor, Hannibal Lokumbe, Dick Gregory, Conrad Tillard, and Mauricelm-Lei Millere, both prominent Nation of Islam members. The Jewish Defense Organization objected, organizing a call-in campaign to Warner Brothers and threatening a boycott. The Anti-Defamation League and the &quot;New York Post&quot; also objected to Cokely (as well as Sharpton and Tiller/Muhammad) speaking at the event. Warner removed Cokely, Millere, and Tillard without issuing a press release.
